For me they have had a sensational first half because they have a great team in front of them. team but I am sure that many players want to recover right now, get to the locker room and gain strength for a second half that will be equally or more intense because I think Barça will increase the pace."

Sergi Roberto arrives and is doing the best for Barça in the first half. Fully recovered after those knee problems \"Now the public stands up to applaud the work of Víctor Sánchez."

He tries to talk to the referee and tries to explain what which from their point of view is a mistake in reverse."

And we see here Neymar's very good unmarking. There is no outside of play. But here defining is very difficult. And he has the quality to look for option B that both Messi and Suárez had."
