    "input": "\n    Bayern Munich 7 - 0 Shakhtar\n\nFirst Half:\n\n0:0 Comment: the first leg. Surely it will be a different story tonight, Alan?\n0:4 Comment: Don't say that, you can't give it to me. We watched the game and it really was poor.\n0:8 Comment: We had a chance to get away from it but it really wasn't a very good play.\n0:11 Comment: To be fair, I think Shakhtar did well just to mar the game, to be honest.\n0:14 Comment: It was marred even more to the fact that Pep Guardiola lost Xabi Alonso and had to shuffle the pack tonight.\n0:19 Comment: But in terms of attacking, you've got to think that Bayern have got plenty of reserve.\n0:24 Comment: I think they've scored, I think since that game, I think they've conceded a couple of goals.\n0:28 Comment: They just want to hand over the weekend, one before that to Cologne.\n0:31 Comment: They've scored 15, so certainly big, big favourites to win this evening.\n0:35 Comment: They know it's a big game, it's a big crowd, they expect goals tonight.\n0:38 Comment: More importantly, they expect Bayern to be in the next round of the Champions League.\n0:43 Comment: Bayern hoping to reach the quarter-finals of the Champions League for a record 14th time.\n0:49 Comment: It would be one more than Manchester United.\n0:53 Comment: Gerard Dorteng.\n0:56 Comment: Nastian Feinsteiger with the captain's armband, although Philipp Lahm is on the bench for Bayern tonight, injured in November.\n1:4 Comment: Fractured an ankle.\n1:8 Comment: That certainly is good news.\n1:9 Comment: A fellow just catches him near Maraguzza.\n1:11 Comment: That's certainly good news for Bayern, isn't it?\n1:13 Comment: Because considering, if they do progress in the competition, you know how important Philipp Lahm is.\n1:18 Comment: Not just the way they play, but certainly in terms of the captain and the team and what he brings to the team.\n1:23 Comment: So good news to see him back to nearly full fitness.\n1:26 Comment: But he'll be used this evening, so it'll depend on the whole thing.\n1:29 Comment: But that's why they have to bring him on.\n1:34 Comment: Ceaușescu has been in charge of Shakhtar Donetsk for quite a while.\n1:39 Comment: It's the 11th season now, the 69-year-old Romanian.\n1:46 Comment: Ribéry.\n1:52 Comment: Halibut.\n1:55 Comment: And again.\n1:58 Comment: Halibut making decent progress.\n2:0 Comment: He evaded Robben, nearly came to Muller.\n2:3 Comment: But instead Tyson.\n2:5 Comment: I don't actually think he really didn't want to play it to Aaron Robben.\n2:8 Comment: Aaron just got in the road as he was meant to go all the way out to the right-hand side.\n2:14 Comment: The top scorer.\n2:15 Comment: He's got to get a chance.\n2:17 Comment: Robben and Ribéry.\n2:18 Comment: It cuts him as he brought down.\n2:20 Comment: It is a penalty already.\n2:22 Comment: Roy Cullen points to the spot.\n2:24 Comment: And Bayern have the chance to start in style.\n2:28 Comment: Did you ever think about it there, Ian?\n2:29 Comment: The referee, I think you did.\n2:31 Comment: But it's absolutely no question, it looks as though the contact...\n2:33 Comment: You can see they're saying there was absolutely none whatsoever.\n2:36 Comment: Oh, and it's a red card.\n2:39 Comment: Sensational start to this match.\n2:44 Comment: Shakhtar Donetsk.\n2:47 Comment: Not only conceding a penalty so early, but also down to 10 men.\n2:54 Comment: That's incredible. Really incredible.\n2:56 Comment: I thought for a minute he was just wondering, what's the contact?\n2:58 Comment: Let's see, lovely little tune.\n3:0 Comment: Götze goes through.\n3:1 Comment: He's saying when he goes to make the contact that he swings and actually misses.\n3:5 Comment: He just takes him away.\n3:6 Comment: You've got to see, it looks as though Kupcha is saying, I didn't touch him.\n3:9 Comment: I didn't touch him at all.\n3:10 Comment: Götze looks as though he's gone to ground early, but that is a real blow, red card.\n3:15 Comment: Really, really hard on Shakhtar.\n3:17 Comment: It does look as if there wasn't a lot of contact.\n3:20 Comment: Maybe just enough to put him off balance.\n3:23 Comment: What a chance this is for Munich.\n3:25 Comment: Kupcha has taken the long walk.\n3:26 Comment: Thomas Muller takes the short walk here.\n3:29 Comment: And Muller scores, as he often does.\n3:34 Comment: Bayern Munich are up to a storming start as they look to book a quarter-final.\n3:41 Comment: It's way too early to say it like it's out, but oh my goodness, that is going to be tough.\n3:45 Comment: Really tough for Shakhtar.\n3:47 Comment: Don't yet snow, down to ten men.\n3:50 Comment: Good composure by Thomas Muller.\n3:52 Comment: He's scored in the last four or five games.\n3:54 Comment: Good stuff.\n3:55 Comment: You know it's what important that is to make sure he converts the penalty to give Bayern the advantage.\n4:2 Comment: Of course, not only the advantage of an extra man, it's just going to be so difficult for Shakhtar.\n4:8 Comment: It really is.\n4:11 Comment: Seven penalties out of seven for Thomas Muller this season.\n4:14 Comment: His last miss was against Arsenal.\n4:17 Comment: Last season.\n4:19 Comment: That will do for starters for Bayern Munich.\n4:22 Comment: And Shakhtar down to ten men.\n4:28 Comment: Kupcha seeing red.\n4:31 Comment: This could be a long night for the Ukrainian champions.\n4:35 Comment: He's scored a penalty in Sampdoria as well.\n4:37 Comment: He's pretty used to taking them.\n4:39 Comment: He's hugely confident.\n4:42 Comment: I'm just coming back to the challenge from Kupcha.\n4:44 Comment: I'm really unconvinced that he made contact.\n4:46 Comment: It is quite a rash challenge and it's deep in the box.\n4:49 Comment: It certainly looks as if he's impeded Götze when he hits the deck.\n4:54 Comment: Let's give the referee no choice.\n4:57 Comment: Thomas Kupcha looking for some sort of response here with Luis Adriano.\n5:2 Comment: And it is a corner off Götze.\n5:8 Comment: Shakhtar looking to make something happen here.\n5:23 Comment: And they have got another corner as Luis Adriano challenged.\n5:27 Comment: He's unlucky. He does get a contact on.\n5:29 Comment: I think he does win the header and it comes up the head eventually of the Bayern defender.\n5:32 Comment: I'm just going to wait. There's a couple of balls in here.\n5:35 Comment: He could have probably booked them, couldn't he?\n5:37 Comment: I think a red card would have been more than sufficient.\n5:42 Comment: It's Dario Serna to deliver this corner.\n5:49 Comment: Rebry is away now.\n5:51 Comment: It might just open up.\n5:55 Comment: He's made Muller work for that a bit.\n5:57 Comment: But only a bit.\n5:59 Comment: Tyson on defensive watch.\n6:5 Comment: Robin.\n6:9 Comment: Rebry with the miss kick.\n6:12 Comment: You don't see that too often.\n6:13 Comment: Lovely skill earlier on, wasn't he?\n6:15 Comment: He was trying to build the play up.\n6:17 Comment: A little bit of a swing and a miss.\n6:22 Comment: I genuinely think a red card is really, really harsh there.\n6:25 Comment: It's really, really harsh.\n6:26 Comment: It's a lovely execution.\n6:28 Comment: I just think the Scottish referee has gone way over the top there with the red card.\n6:31 Comment: I'm not going to say it's the last one.\n6:32 Comment: Really, a red card too early on in the game.\n6:34 Comment: It's such an important game as well.\n6:36 Comment: Incredible.\n6:47 Comment: Schweinsteiger.\n6:51 Comment: Rebry.\n6:52 Comment: Alaba making moves down that left side.\n6:57 Comment: Gertzer and Rebry linking up here.\n6:59 Comment: Alaba has moved inside.\n7:2 Comment: Gertzer finds Alaba.\n7:3 Comment: But it sticks with Piatto.\n7:6 Comment: I think you've already seen the way the game is going to go tonight.\n7:8 Comment: Because basically Mario Gertzer can just go where he wants to go.\n7:11 Comment: And he's going to be really difficult to pick up.\n7:15 Comment: Shakhtar's coming through.\n7:20 Comment: Rebry.\n7:21 Comment: It's Lewandowski.\n7:24 Comment: Forced a little wide.\n7:25 Comment: Alaba.\n7:27 Comment: Forced a little wide.\n7:28 Comment: And Robben.\n7:30 Comment: Couldn't quite latch on to it to force it in.\n7:34 Comment: Brilliant play from Lewandowski.\n7:37 Comment: If Robben had a full head of hair I think he would have got that.\n7:41 Comment: Great play from Lewandowski.\n7:42 Comment: A little dink over.\n7:43 Comment: He doesn't go to score there.\n7:44 Comment: Oh, my goodness.\n7:45 Comment: I would imagine Robben thinks he's got this.\n7:47 Comment: But he just seems to skip away from him.\n7:49 Comment: Just on the bounce there.\n7:50 Comment: Just picks up a bit of pace.\n7:52 Comment: Beyond Aaron Robben.\n7:54 Comment: I think Moses had a wonderful chance.\n7:56 Comment: I don't think they'll have to wait too long to see another one.\n7:59 Comment: It's going to be a change.\n8:2 Comment: Shakhtar's best laid plans.\n8:5 Comment: Pretty much ripped by that early red card.\n8:12 Comment: Going to bring on Sherhide Krelitson.\n8:20 Comment: He has replaced Tyson.\n8:21 Comment: Tyson was one of their best players in the first leg.\n8:23 Comment: It's a really disappointing.\n8:25 Comment: I'm not going to go on about it now.\n8:27 Comment: It's happened.\n8:28 Comment: The Bayern obviously advantage.\n8:29 Comment: I think they've been really hard done to.\n8:30 Comment: That change quite simply means that...\n8:34 Comment: The KSK are saying,\n8:35 Comment: we might try and hit you on the break.\n8:36 Comment: We're certainly not going to beat Final 6.\n8:38 Comment: Which they still might be regardless.\n8:40 Comment: He is one of the players, Tyson, for Shakhtar.\n8:42 Comment: If they're going to do well in the game,\n8:44 Comment: he'll be part of it.\n8:45 Comment: Now, unfortunately, he's going to sit out and watch.\n8:47 Comment: Oh, my goodness.\n8:48 Comment: 80 plus minutes.\n8:49 Comment: Shame.\n8:51 Comment: You do feel for Tyson.\n8:56 Comment: This game rather short-lived in this wonderful arena.\n8:59 Comment: After that red card for Kucher.\n9:2 Comment: Thomas Müller dispatched the penalty.\n9:15 Comment: The only way we could have gotten two penalties tonight,\n9:17 Comment: would have been if it had remained goalless.\n9:19 Comment: But it hasn't been a nil-nil draw here for three years.\n9:22 Comment: Bayern tend not to do them.\n9:24 Comment: There's not many.\n9:25 Comment: I can't even remember the last time there was.\n9:27 Comment: I'm sure it was a long, long time ago.\n9:30 Comment: What did you say, three years ago?\n9:31 Comment: Indeed.\n9:32 Comment: Long time, eh?\n9:33 Comment: Long, long time.\n9:35 Comment: That's why the first leg of this game,\n9:37 Comment: this time was a surprising scoreline.\n9:45 Comment: Schweinsteiger.\n9:50 Comment: Halber.\n9:58 Comment: Halber, Ribéry.\n10:4 Comment: Ribéry progressing.\n10:19 Comment: It's a really, really well worked.\n10:20 Comment: Basically, what it is,\n10:21 Comment: Thomas Müller just comes a way out,\n10:23 Comment: and they just give it to the near post,\n10:24 Comment: and it's a direct lead back in the middle.\n10:26 Comment: And it's a really, really well worked.\n10:41 Comment: It's a really, really well worked.\n10:42 Comment: Basically, what it is,\n10:43 Comment: Thomas Müller just comes a way out,\n10:45 Comment: and they just give it to the near post,\n10:46 Comment: and it's a direct lead back in the middle.\n10:48 Comment: And it's a really, really well worked.\n11:1 Comment: He probably blasted them in every time on the training.\n11:3 Comment: Yeah, he probably did.\n11:4 Comment: He's probably right.\n11:5 Comment: Guaranteed.\n11:7 Comment: He knows he just got a little bit over excited there,\n11:9 Comment: because it really was a well worked front kick.\n11:26 Comment: This is where they have to be really careful.\n11:28 Comment: You can see, obviously,\n11:29 Comment: massive pressure on the ball.\n11:31 Comment: Not letting him out.\n11:32 Comment: There's only one way he can go,\n11:33 Comment: and that is to go long.\n11:34 Comment: Watch this here.\n11:35 Comment: Oh, what?\n11:38 Comment: Oh, my goodness.\n11:39 Comment: He's had a shocker there.\n11:40 Comment: That was almost,\n11:41 Comment: he's almost stood up.\n11:42 Comment: That's almost a shank.\n11:43 Comment: Isn't it?\n11:44 Comment: It really is.\n11:45 Comment: That's almost straight in his own net.\n11:46 Comment: I was going to say,\n11:47 Comment: the only place he can go is long.\n11:48 Comment: I certainly didn't think for one minute\n11:49 Comment: he was going to be trying to get the right back in.\n11:51 Comment: Incidentally,\n11:52 Comment: who would have been under massive pressure\n11:53 Comment: taking under control,\n11:54 Comment: because it was coming at him at 500 miles an hour.\n11:57 Comment: He could never do that again.\n11:58 Comment: If he tried, you would hope.\n12:1 Comment: Bayern gifted a corner by Piatov.\n12:7 Comment: It's Goetze to take this.\n12:11 Comment: Robben trying to keep it alive.\n12:18 Comment: Foul by Max Stuber.\n12:21 Comment: He returned recently after the best part of two years out injured.\n12:25 Comment: Fish and ligament damage.\n12:28 Comment: Fred.\n12:33 Comment: Douglas Costa.\n12:37 Comment: Fred has lost it to Goetze.\n12:39 Comment: Bayern will surge forward again.\n12:47 Comment: Robben.\n12:50 Comment: Muller.\n12:58 Comment: Schweinsteiger.\n13:1 Comment: Touch from Ribery made Alaba backtrack slightly.\n13:5 Comment: He didn't want the touch, did he?\n13:7 Comment: I don't think he realised that Alaba was on his way.\n13:10 Comment: He thought he'd have to cancel.\n13:16 Comment: Ribery.\n13:24 Comment: Coutinho for Robben.\n13:29 Comment: Ribery.\n13:35 Comment: Alaba.\n13:38 Comment: Corner for Bayern.\n13:39 Comment: Good ball, wasn't it?\n13:40 Comment: That teaser into near post.\n13:42 Comment: They've got to make sure the defender gets a header in.\n13:45 Comment: Either that or a flick on from Thomas Muller.\n13:47 Comment: Or Levent Dosti.\n13:48 Comment: Either or, he's going to be in there for those little teasing crosses.\n13:52 Comment: They've tried the corner again.\n13:54 Comment: This is becoming a familiar sight.\n13:56 Comment: Goetze taking corners from here.\n14:4 Comment: Goetze delivers.\n14:8 Comment: Boateng.\n14:9 Comment: It's Ribery.\n14:11 Comment: It's cleared by Dario Serna in the nick of time.\n14:18 Comment: Fred now, a potential breakout here for Shakhtar Donetsk.\n14:23 Comment: Terrific challenge from Boateng.\n14:25 Comment: It was a brilliant challenge.\n14:26 Comment: We've got to see the touch from Fred originally.\n14:28 Comment: To set up that little breakaway was an absolute beauty.\n14:31 Comment: But Boateng's, he's spoiled everything.\n14:33 Comment: I think Fred might have thought, hey, what a minute, I've got a real chance.\n14:36 Comment: I've only got one on one here.\n14:37 Comment: But the big guy, great stuff from Jerome Boateng.\n14:41 Comment: Goetze.\n14:45 Comment: Alaba.\n14:47 Comment: It's Ribery.\n14:50 Comment: Robben.\n14:53 Comment: Shakhtar.\n14:55 Comment: Living dangerously with their 10 men.\n14:57 Comment: There's Bayern Munich, look for a quick second.\n15:1 Comment: Ribery.\n15:5 Comment: Determined to get his shot away.\n15:8 Comment: Robben.\n15:13 Comment: It's broken kindly here to Alaba.\n15:16 Comment: Neither here nor there.\n15:18 Comment: From the Austrian.\n15:19 Comment: It was too much there, wasn't it?\n15:21 Comment: We are pegged down.\n15:22 Comment: Shakhtar, even with the opportunity to get out, they haven't got it.\n15:25 Comment: Just missed times this now.\n15:27 Comment: Okay, that's the only arm, but for goodness sake, we can't be giving a penalty for something like that.\n15:31 Comment: Probably should have done better, someone of his quality.\n15:34 Comment: Doesn't quite get the left leg through quick enough.\n15:38 Comment: But again, another half chance for Bayern.\n15:40 Comment: I don't know what we've got, 15 minutes of play time.\n15:42 Comment: I think we may be looking at 3 or 4 tonight.\n15:52 Comment: Ribery.\n15:55 Comment: Lewandowski.\n16:1 Comment: Lewandowski, he didn't hang around.\n16:5 Comment: Ribery.\n16:8 Comment: Götze.\n16:11 Comment: Two congested in there.\n16:16 Comment: Gone back by Alaba.\n16:18 Comment: Not happy with the touch on, was it?\n16:20 Comment: Alex Tix here, I said he was bundled off.\n16:22 Comment: Again, I think upper body strength.\n16:24 Comment: David Alaba is a different player from 2 or 3 years ago.\n16:30 Comment: Lewandowski.\n16:32 Comment: I think if Bayern do get another one before 20 minutes, I think psychologically that just may be about it.\n16:37 Comment: Ribery in.\n16:38 Comment: The flag was up, 4 offside against Müller.\n16:42 Comment: They're going to have to be better, Bayern.\n16:44 Comment: I know it's going to be, against the 10 men it's probably going to be huge favourites over the exercise.\n16:50 Comment: Robben, they're going to have to be absolutely on the button here.\n16:53 Comment: They're going to make a change as well, maybe Robben's injured.\n16:55 Comment: That was just where it was.\n16:58 Comment: I sent to him.\n17:0 Comment: He's OK.\n17:3 Comment: Ruda was waiting to come on.\n17:7 Comment: He shows you Pep Guardiola just doesn't want to take a chance with someone like Aaron Robben.\n17:13 Comment: Because he will be one of the first names on the team if they're going to get to the end of this competition, you may think.\n17:22 Comment: So Ruda is going to come on.\n17:27 Comment: I just see the reaction of Aaron Robben.\n17:30 Comment: He is taking off.\n17:33 Comment: Goal.\n17:41 Comment: Halibut.\n17:50 Comment: Stegen, Schweinsteiger.\n17:56 Comment: Bayern happy to buy their time here.\n18:2 Comment: Ribéry.\n18:5 Comment: Ribéry returns it here to Lewandowski.\n18:8 Comment: It's away by Rakinski.\n18:10 Comment: Really well done, really well Rakinski there.\n18:13 Comment: Really good start.\n18:14 Comment: Again just a given goal from Lewandowski and Ribéry.\n18:17 Comment: Ribéry just puts it down the channel and he's not that happy about it.\n18:21 Comment: Obviously he doesn't want to make sure, just the top of his hamstring there.\n18:26 Comment: No need to take a chance tonight.\n18:27 Comment: Bayern already huge favourites to win, even bigger now.\n18:30 Comment: 1-0 up against 10 men.\n18:31 Comment: There's still a good 70 minutes to play.\n18:37 Comment: They're doing this for Sebastian Roda as he replaces Halibut.\n18:41 Comment: I mean it's most used sub this season.\n18:43 Comment: He's on for the 16th time.\n18:46 Comment: New arrival for this season from Eintracht Frankfurt.\n18:57 Comment: It's a good opportunity for him isn't it, Sebastian Roda?\n19:1 Comment: They're probably thinking, come on now.\n19:4 Comment: Tune in for the next one, he might have a chance to score a goal here.\n19:15 Comment: Boateng.\n19:18 Comment: Muffinia.\n19:27 Comment: He's found Steiger now.\n19:28 Comment: Roda.\n19:31 Comment: Steiger!\n19:39 Comment: It's tough for Shakhtar.\n19:40 Comment: Do we commit? Do we go and really press the ball?\n19:42 Comment: And if we do, do we get picked off?\n19:48 Comment: That's where they have to be better.\n19:49 Comment: That's what I was talking about.\n19:50 Comment: It's that kind of little ball that really should be no more than routine.\n19:53 Comment: Rather than trying to force it and make sure it gets to feet.\n19:57 Comment: And then go and put Shakhtar under a bit of pressure.\n19:59 Comment: Just over the last ten minutes, they haven't been particularly fantastic enough.\n20:2 Comment: If there were plenty of ballers, you would probably think 30-odd yards from goal.\n20:4 Comment: But that little killer pass, so far anyway, just hasn't been there.\n20:11 Comment: Bayern Munich have only lost two of their last 34 matches to Manchester City.\n20:16 Comment: Wolfsburg, who are the nearest team to them in the Bundesliga.\n20:19 Comment: Although not really that close, 11 points behind.\n20:22 Comment: Goethe.\n20:24 Comment: Alaba.\n20:27 Comment: A pass being applauded and appreciated by the Bayern faithful.\n20:33 Comment: Figener returns it to Schweinsteiger.\n20:36 Comment: Here's Ribéry.\n20:39 Comment: Alaba!\n20:41 Comment: Barrios certainly made the challenge, but it's another corner.\n20:44 Comment: I think Ribéry is just going to take one more step in the inside and the right.\n20:47 Comment: He knows that Alaba has got such pace, he thought he'd just give him and he can sting it across the box.\n20:53 Comment: And like you said, another corner.\n20:58 Comment: Ribéry trying to return that to Alaba.\n21:4 Comment: Söder.\n21:11 Comment: Alaba.\n21:19 Comment: Figener.\n21:21 Comment: Alaba.\n21:34 Comment: I say, the Chesky will feel rather hard done by it, losing the man to that early red card.\n21:41 Comment: Kucher.\n21:45 Comment: It's hard enough with 11 men against Bayern.\n21:49 Comment: Alaba.\n21:50 Comment: Ribéry.\n21:58 Comment: I mean, this generally was a nil-nil the way the first game went.\n22:2 Comment: Crocs, you know, still really in the balance, wasn't it? Particularly, I mean, even if you look at last night, my goodness, obviously Real Madrid losing it home to Schalke.\n22:9 Comment: You know, some strange things can happen, but that certainly doesn't look as if there'll be a big shock this evening, not the way the game's going in the first, what, 20 odd minutes.\n22:18 Comment: Alaba.\n22:53 Comment: Ewandowski, Ribéry takes over.\n22:57 Comment: Alaba.\n23:0 Comment: Kroos.\n23:2 Comment: Lewandowski off the post!\n23:4 Comment: It should have been a second goal there, but Bayern Munich.\n23:11 Comment: Well for someone like Lewandowski, that's like an open goal.\n23:47 Comment: For someone like Robert Lewandowski, to be honest, it was probably just like missing an open goal, because he is just so good.\n23:53 Comment: That would normally be despised.\n23:56 Comment: Better than to cause that to happen.\n23:58 Comment: The latest in a series of Bayern Munich corners, it's Goethe once more to deliver.\n24:4 Comment: Ribéry.\n24:11 Comment: Goethe.\n24:12 Comment: Go on, go on.\n24:15 Comment: Go on, Sterling!\n24:16 Comment: Blocked by Serna.\n24:18 Comment: Tim by Fred.\n24:20 Comment: Sienoff gives his challenge as well.\n24:24 Comment: He's done well, kept possession for the team.\n24:26 Comment: Give him it back. Yep, good play.\n24:32 Comment: What a cross he did that time.\n24:33 Comment: He's just worked really, really hard to keep possession.\n24:38 Comment: Fred then just a little giving going in, tried to switch the play.\n24:42 Comment: Obviously, they give the ball back.\n24:44 Comment: It's probably just going to be the rest of the next 71 minutes that we're going to have as well.\n24:48 Comment: It's going to be the same.\n24:50 Comment: Alaba.\n24:52 Comment: Grossly overhit by Alaba, but just thought for a moment Muffini might get to that.\n24:57 Comment: That's a couple of times he's done that, isn't it?\n24:58 Comment: In a really good position.\n25:0 Comment: And just put way too much on it.\n25:5 Comment: Guardiola won the Champions League twice with Barcelona.\n25:10 Comment: Actually lose to Sartor once in the Nou Camp, although it was in the final group game after they'd already qualified in 2008.\n25:30 Comment: Just seeing where Manuel Neuer is there, he might get further and further and further towards that half-way line\n25:35 Comment: because he gets more and more and more of this iron-dominated position.\n25:39 Comment: He'll be wanting to do something, presumably.\n25:42 Comment: Alaba.\n25:45 Comment: It's a casual return from Muller.\n25:48 Comment: The yellow card coming out, a bit bad about that for Badstuber.\n25:51 Comment: It's crazy, isn't it, really?\n25:52 Comment: Because you'll have to be really careful.\n25:53 Comment: What you don't want to do, obviously, is pick up two yellow cards tonight.\n25:59 Comment: And you divide this for not enough alone.\n26:2 Comment: Because you need to make the challenge.\n26:3 Comment: So the yellow card will be a lot.\n26:10 Comment: First yellow card of the contest to Håga Badstuber.\n26:13 Comment: We have had a red.\n26:14 Comment: Alexander Kuscher sent off for Michail Vyacheslav's side.\n26:18 Comment: Thomas Muller scored the resulting penalty.\n26:33 Comment: The next time he gives his goalkeeper a touch.\n26:49 Comment: Boateng.\n26:51 Comment: There's two teams crossing paths for the first time ever this season in these two rounds of 16 legs.\n27:36 Comment: Rufinia.\n27:41 Comment: Come back to Ribéry, who sent the pass over there in the first place.\n27:46 Comment: Goalkeeper frantically diverting that away with his foot.\n27:49 Comment: He's done brilliant as well, because I thought at one point that he was going to sneak beyond him.\n27:53 Comment: And he just gets enough of it.\n27:55 Comment: That's due a couple of defenders as well.\n27:56 Comment: Once on his left foot, drills it low and hard.\n28:0 Comment: Well done the goalkeeper.\n28:1 Comment: Leg and arm and then leg.\n28:3 Comment: Anywhere, anywhere.\n28:5 Comment: Clear.\n28:6 Comment: Any which way you can.\n28:16 Comment: Hooked on by Götze to Lewandowski.\n28:19 Comment: Muller through the middle.\n28:20 Comment: Rufinia arrives.\n28:23 Comment: Muller!\n28:24 Comment: Straight at the keeper.\n28:26 Comment: Sona does just enough.\n28:27 Comment: He does really well there, Sona, the captain.\n28:31 Comment: Just gets enough contact.\n28:33 Comment: Just as he was heading the ball target.\n28:39 Comment: That's a free kick for Douglas Costa.\n28:43 Comment: And it's a free kick for the goalkeeper.\n28:45 Comment: That's a free kick for Douglas Costa.\n29:3 Comment: Fred.\n29:5 Comment: Steered away from Luis Adriano.\n29:14 Comment: 5-7.\n29:15 Comment: Luis knows how many against Mati Borisov.\n29:17 Comment: He's got eight or nine goals already in this competition.\n29:20 Comment: But there are too many opportunities for him this evening, I think.\n29:26 Comment: Yep, that could be the loneliest man on the planet tonight.\n29:29 Comment: Nisalaba.\n29:33 Comment: Riebering.\n29:36 Comment: Boateng.\n29:38 Comment: Rufinia.\n29:45 Comment: Badstuber.\n29:58 Comment: Riebering returns it.\n30:0 Comment: Badstuber.\n30:3 Comment: Schweinsteiger.\n30:6 Comment: Rufinia.\n30:12 Comment: Riebering.\n30:14 Comment: Evaded Götze.\n30:16 Comment: Struggling, aren't they?\n30:19 Comment: Gives them the sorry.\n30:20 Comment: Drove it a little bit too hard and probably told them\n30:23 Comment: they should have taken a touch.\n30:25 Comment: Just struggling a little bit.\n30:26 Comment: There's the header and you've just seen\n30:28 Comment: you've just seen Sona.\n30:29 Comment: Thomas Muller's not happy.\n30:30 Comment: He thinks there's been a push.\n30:31 Comment: But I think Sona does really well there.\n30:33 Comment: Just gets enough contact.\n30:35 Comment: To stop Thomas Muller having a completely free header.\n30:44 Comment: Maybe a daunting task for the 10 men of Schachtar.\n30:48 Comment: They've gone through half an hour with only conceding one.\n30:54 Comment: Schweinsteiger.\n30:57 Comment: I don't know about Schweinsteiger because if he goes to deck\n31:0 Comment: Stefan Enkel might be picking up a wicket.\n31:3 Comment: Roda.\n31:4 Comment: Another corner for Bayern Munich.\n31:9 Comment: Toschera who we normally see in offensive roles\n31:11 Comment: having to do his bit at the back.\n31:35 Comment: It's Mario Götze then to try again.\n31:37 Comment: Lewandowski.\n31:39 Comment: Boateng.\n31:41 Comment: To be fair though.\n31:43 Comment: He's come down at a bit of a height.\n31:45 Comment: At least the defenders are out of it.\n31:47 Comment: I know they've made sure he doesn't get a clean sweep.\n31:56 Comment: Second goal is proving elusive for Pep Guardiola's side.\n31:59 Comment: After the\n32:1 Comment: goal that he scored.\n32:3 Comment: He's got a bit of a head.\n32:8 Comment: After\n32:10 Comment: the quickest red card in Champions League history.\n32:13 Comment: 2 minutes 39 seconds for Alexander Kutcher.\n32:17 Comment: As long as it stays like this I think you're quite right.\n32:20 Comment: 32 minutes played. Bayern naturally have had\n32:22 Comment: most of the possession etc. etc.\n32:24 Comment: Which you would expect now.\n32:26 Comment: But they haven't managed to get that elusive second goal.\n32:28 Comment: Which to be absolutely honest with you.\n32:29 Comment: You can't just expect to\n32:31 Comment: stroll through a Champions League game regardless against 10 men.\n32:34 Comment: Whoever it is you play.\n32:35 Comment: And not think that Shakhtar won't have sunk in above the goal.\n32:38 Comment: And that's the opportunity within the next.\n32:40 Comment: 60 odd minutes.\n32:41 Comment: Just under.\n32:46 Comment: Road up for Ribéry.\n32:51 Comment: And again.\n32:52 Comment: Cross from Ribéry.\n32:55 Comment: Muller.\n33:1 Comment: Boateng has stayed up.\n33:3 Comment: Having gone involved there.\n33:5 Comment: Mario Götze.\n33:7 Comment: Boateng.\n33:9 Comment: What a chance here for Lewandowski.\n33:12 Comment: And Boateng.\n33:14 Comment: Has put it in.\n33:16 Comment: It's been a while coming that second goal.\n33:20 Comment: But Bayern Munich.\n33:23 Comment: Are most definitely on course.\n33:25 Comment: For the last eight.\n33:28 Comment: It's a scrappy, scrappy goal.\n33:30 Comment: We were thinking it was going to be a real good pass.\n33:32 Comment: And one or two touches.\n33:33 Comment: The defeation build up was good.\n33:35 Comment: We've got to say that in 67, Shakhtar eventually, eventually after.\n33:40 Comment: I think it was Muller, wasn't it?\n33:41 Comment: He was completely free in the middle.\n33:43 Comment: For a header back.\n33:44 Comment: Comes back, sets Lewandowski.\n33:45 Comment: Takes a touch.\n33:46 Comment: Good save.\n33:47 Comment: Pops perfectly.\n33:48 Comment: Perfectly to Jerome Boateng.\n33:49 Comment: Can't believe his luck.\n33:52 Comment: And eventually they get that elusive second goal.\n33:54 Comment: Lovely little touch from Muller.\n33:55 Comment: Good play.\n33:56 Comment: Götze.\n33:57 Comment: It's a good save by the goalkeeper.\n33:58 Comment: But not enough on it.\n33:59 Comment: Jerome Boateng.\n34:0 Comment: Jerome on the spot.\n34:1 Comment: Can't believe his luck.\n34:4 Comment: And you would think this is no more known in a mere formality of a game.\n34:9 Comment: Than it still is in the Champions League.\n34:11 Comment: Well, they have been toiling in their quest for a second goal.\n34:13 Comment: But it's come in rather scrappy fashion.\n34:16 Comment: Unlike them.\n34:18 Comment: Jerome Boateng's only other goal this season was the winner against his former club.\n34:22 Comment: Manchester City in the group stage.\n34:29 Comment: And 1-1 of course.\n34:30 Comment: As a scoreline would have put Shakhtar through.\n34:32 Comment: So that's come as a little bit of a relief for Bayern.\n34:35 Comment: Although I'm sure they felt it would happen eventually.\n34:38 Comment: Yeah, absolutely.\n34:39 Comment: No question about it.\n34:43 Comment: Certainly looking at one point as if it was going to be pretty unlikely.\n34:45 Comment: Shakhtar might, might get to half time just with a 1.\n34:50 Comment: But like I said earlier on, this is really looking like a 3, a 4, maybe even a 5 now.\n34:55 Comment: I think that really will knock the stuffing out of Shakhtar.\n34:59 Comment: Lewandowski.\n35:2 Comment: Götze.\n35:5 Comment: It's Alaba.\n35:7 Comment: It's Muller.\n35:8 Comment: It's Wally.\n35:9 Comment: And looked for all the world while that was going in.\n35:12 Comment: We've got a great view.\n35:13 Comment: Looking right behind that.\n35:14 Comment: That looks as if it's in.\n35:16 Comment: Watch this.\n35:17 Comment: Turns.\n35:18 Comment: Knows where the goal is.\n35:19 Comment: I think it's in there.\n35:21 Comment: Oh my goodness.\n35:22 Comment: And Lewandowski.\n35:23 Comment: It's only a hair away from just deflecting it beyond.\n35:27 Comment: Bayern knows it's going to be a long night in Bayerntown, doesn't it?\n35:30 Comment: Another chance.\n35:32 Comment: Alaba.\n35:47 Comment: That's Dubanow.\n35:52 Comment: Refinha.\n35:53 Comment: We'll never really know whether it would have been a contest after that.\n36:3 Comment: Red card in the third minute.\n36:7 Comment: That's really disappointing.\n36:8 Comment: I thought this might be a bit of a test for Bayern this evening.\n36:10 Comment: I know they're not the best team in the Champions League by any means, Shakhtar,\n36:12 Comment: but defensively they've been pretty good.\n36:14 Comment: And I think there was a...\n36:16 Comment: Broden out for Götze.\n36:18 Comment: There was a start like something the last four away games, five away games.\n36:22 Comment: They hadn't conceded a lot of goals, Shakhtar, albeit, to be fair,\n36:25 Comment: Götze, Ribery.\n36:29 Comment: Götze.\n36:32 Comment: They were a little too intricate.\n36:33 Comment: Within the group stages, I was going to say, you know, the top two groups,\n36:37 Comment: the Athletic Bilbao were poor and Baty obviously weren't very good.\n36:40 Comment: They haven't conceded a lot of goals, specifically.\n36:43 Comment: So I think it's going to be a long night.\n36:45 Comment: It's a long night for Bayern, I think.\n36:49 Comment: There's Adriano getting involved with Boateng now.\n36:53 Comment: There's Douglas Costa as well.\n36:55 Comment: I don't know whether he's gone past him and elbowed him.\n36:58 Comment: We'll get a better look again.\n37:0 Comment: Douglas Costa certainly played with an edge to his game, shall we say, in the first leg.\n37:6 Comment: This will be interesting.\n37:8 Comment: You can see right away Jerome Boateng has grabbed\n37:11 Comment: Douglas Costa to say, no, I'm not having that.\n37:14 Comment: And Ribery is still lying on the deck.\n37:15 Comment: So we can only presume that when Costa has gone past him,\n37:17 Comment: this is a red incident, if he thinks this is intentional, it's an elbow.\n37:22 Comment: Yellow cards.\n37:24 Comment: Slash by Willie Cotton.\n37:27 Comment: So Douglas Costa booked just for a moment.\n37:29 Comment: He might have been holding his breath.\n37:32 Comment: I'm presuming it's with the two of them squaring up to each other that he's only been booked.\n37:37 Comment: And it's not for the instance that Ribery is on the deck for.\n37:40 Comment: He's obviously then booked.\n37:41 Comment: Let's have a better look here.\n37:43 Comment: Watch Ribery on the ball now.\n37:45 Comment: Costa goes past him.\n37:47 Comment: Oh, hang on a minute.\n37:48 Comment: He doesn't, I mean, he just bumps into him.\n37:49 Comment: And I don't think it's as bad as that, specifically.\n37:52 Comment: And that was why Jerome Boateng wasn't happy, because Costa\n37:56 Comment: has simply gone straight into the back of Ribery.\n37:58 Comment: And that's why Ribery hit the deck.\n38:5 Comment: Yellow cards then for Boateng and Costa.\n38:9 Comment: Well, that can only mean that the referee hasn't seen Costa hitting Ribery for sure.\n38:13 Comment: Otherwise, he'd have given them a straight red there, surely.\n38:17 Comment: Sawhead for Frank Ribery.\n38:25 Comment: He's having a word with the fourth official.\n38:33 Comment: He certainly did put it about in that first leg, didn't he?\n38:35 Comment: I mean, to be fair, he actually played quite well too.\n38:39 Comment: He's saying sorry.\n38:44 Comment: Ribery waiting to come back on.\n38:50 Comment: Trying to stagger.\n38:52 Comment: He's having a little word with Ribery, too.\n38:55 Comment: Keep an eye on that one.\n39:1 Comment: I see just Thomas Muller just going over to Ribery, because he's just had another word with Costa.\n39:5 Comment: We just need to calm down.\n39:7 Comment: We're buying our way ahead here.\n39:9 Comment: We don't need to be picking on any silly bootkicker, or doing anything crazy.\n39:18 Comment: As you can see, it's predictably one-sided, even more so after that early red for Schapter.\n39:24 Comment: Schapter.\n39:32 Comment: It's a bit of a scream to Ribery, just to kill it a bit.\n39:37 Comment: Although Ribery's already gone out his earshot and gone all the way over to the other side, almost.\n39:45 Comment: Alaba.\n39:49 Comment: Gets it.\n39:51 Comment: Good ball.\n39:55 Comment: Alaba finding Rafinha.\n39:58 Comment: Didn't deliver quite so well.\n39:59 Comment: Goalkeeper toiling.\n40:2 Comment: Well done, Skipper.\n40:3 Comment: Good player, Dario Sone, isn't he?\n40:6 Comment: Good character.\n40:7 Comment: And we'll need to have big time at the back to make sure this doesn't finish 5 or 6.\n40:13 Comment: Player he would think considered a bit loose.\n40:16 Comment: He has taken some chances here.\n40:18 Comment: Goalkeeper playing at the top.\n40:21 Comment: He has, because that's a terrible pass.\n40:23 Comment: I don't even think that Sone was expecting to get it to be a mistake.\n40:28 Comment: He's just got to have a word with him.\n40:29 Comment: He's keeping and keeping and keeping on here.\n40:32 Comment: That's why Zagreb needs to go over and just help the situation here.\n40:37 Comment: Because Ribery's just losing the plot a lot.\n40:39 Comment: Zagreb had at the moment, because he feels hard done too.\n40:41 Comment: Because he didn't really do anything to instigate the Douglas Costa challenge on him.\n40:56 Comment: Lewandowski, taken away by Fred.\n41:0 Comment: Here's Adriano, back to Fred.\n41:3 Comment: And he's got it.\n41:4 Comment: Taken away by Fred.\n41:7 Comment: Here's Adriano, back to Fred.\n41:10 Comment: Now by Lewandowski.\n41:25 Comment: Rakiczki.\n41:28 Comment: Poteng hit it off his own man, Rafinha.\n41:31 Comment: To Sierra.\n41:32 Comment: Survived a stumble.\n41:35 Comment: Trying to sneak it through to Douglas Costa, but nothing doing.\n41:43 Comment: Got a touch.\n41:45 Comment: And he's moving into the middle now.\n41:52 Comment: Can't get behind that from Lewandowski.\n41:55 Comment: I think he did look up and think he might put this into Thomas Muller.\n41:58 Comment: But it was just a couple of yards behind him.\n42:0 Comment: He probably did the best thing there.\n42:2 Comment: Seeing as the next striker, it was an opportunity to have a striker on target.\n42:18 Comment: Alaba.\n42:26 Comment: Good flip.\n42:28 Comment: Schmein's dagger.\n42:31 Comment: Rafinha.\n42:33 Comment: Lewandowski can't get near it.\n42:35 Comment: Darius Serna hooking away to Douglas Costa.\n42:39 Comment: Alaba.\n42:42 Comment: Foul on Fred by that man again.\n42:45 Comment: Oliveri.\n42:48 Comment: Maybe just enough contact for him, just to hold Fred off the ball.\n42:52 Comment: Get a better look here.\n42:53 Comment: It's one of six and half a dozen.\n42:55 Comment: You can just see that little pull back there.\n42:57 Comment: It was enough for Fred to draw the foul.\n43:1 Comment: A couple of minutes to go until half-time.\n43:20 Comment: Botek tidies up.\n43:22 Comment: Nguyet away to Alaba.\n43:31 Comment: Rafa.\n43:42 Comment: They just don't have the same cutting edge down the right-hand side, do they, when Robben goes off?\n43:45 Comment: It's not been the same since Roda's come on.\n43:47 Comment: He's done okay.\n43:48 Comment: He plays a lot of stuff, maybe more infield.\n43:51 Comment: They don't have the same width on the right-hand side.\n43:53 Comment: I'm looking to get Rafinha, who's the furthest man, top of the screen, down the right-hand side now.\n43:59 Comment: They just lose a little something down the right when Robben's not there.\n44:3 Comment: Lewandowski.\n44:5 Comment: Rafinha for Schweinsteiger.\n44:8 Comment: Bayern fancy another goal before the break.\n44:11 Comment: Final minute of the half.\n44:18 Comment: Here's Adriano.\n44:21 Comment: He's been doing plenty of defensive work, but he has secured a throw for Shakhtar.\n44:29 Comment: He's got it.\n44:44 Comment: Lewandowski.\n44:45 Comment: Trying to tee that up for Rivere, but Rav runs successfully.\n44:49 Comment: It's one back by Alaba, though.\n44:58 Comment: Half-time.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: It is Bayern Munich who get the second half going here and we're in a very comfortable position.\n0:6 Comment: Two goals up against 10 men.\n0:12 Comment: There must be a good chance they'll add to that and they might not hang about as they're on the\n0:16 Comment: front foot already in this second half. They did lose Arjen Robben to a hamstring tweak in\n0:24 Comment: the first half. Sebastian Roda came on in his place.\n0:34 Comment: Ribery's cross.\n0:40 Comment: Came off Ribery's hand.\n0:46 Comment: He's probably sufficiently calmed down now. He got a bit irate in the first half didn't he?\n0:51 Comment: A challenge from Douglas Costa.\n0:54 Comment: He had a few words to say about it but he's had a cup of tea and he looks a little bit\n0:58 Comment: happier now in the second half.\n1:1 Comment: Bayern Munich won the Champions League in 2013 when they beat Borussia Dortmund.\n1:6 Comment: Having lost to Chelsea here the year before.\n1:12 Comment: They went out in the semi-finals last season when Real Madrid thumped them here but they haven't lost here since.\n1:17 Comment: That really hurt last year as well.\n1:23 Comment: It surprised a lot of people. It certainly was to people in Munich.\n1:26 Comment: They thought they might run off to turn the ball over but they weren't.\n1:28 Comment: Just beaten out completely across last year.\n1:30 Comment: They've got to make sure that is not in the game.\n1:36 Comment: That is given against Real.\n1:40 Comment: It's gone down pretty easy.\n1:47 Comment: They've got a look here.\n1:54 Comment: They've only suffered four defeats in 28 matches this season.\n1:59 Comment: They rather well say the least to avoid one here.\n2:4 Comment: It's turned into a hard shift.\n2:13 Comment: Here's Fred Dutt.\n2:15 Comment: Just imagine if they were to win goal or goal.\n2:22 Comment: It's going to make things a little bit more nervous.\n2:24 Comment: We're talking about a hard time. Has he got anybody on the pace to bring on?\n2:30 Comment: Obviously, the leader, James Tyson, gone off early on and Fred Silva has come on.\n2:36 Comment: In terms of attacking, I don't think he doesn't have enough of that.\n2:40 Comment: It's going to make any difference.\n2:42 Comment: He's got to keep forward and back. Maybe just one in front of the back four.\n2:47 Comment: He can go 3-1. Maybe try and get something at the other end.\n2:53 Comment: The skipper's down.\n2:55 Comment: Darius Senna.\n2:59 Comment: Colliding there with Götze.\n3:1 Comment: They didn't move enough, did they?\n3:5 Comment: Maybe just got him right on the side of the boot.\n3:9 Comment: I think it was his heel.\n3:12 Comment: If he's pulled his calf, he can come down.\n3:18 Comment: To be honest, probably Jacques Toss, psychologically, might have already.\n3:26 Comment: He's going to give it a go.\n3:28 Comment: He'll have to go off the field first.\n3:32 Comment: There doesn't seem to be that much contact. It was a little bit 50-50.\n3:35 Comment: He's obviously come out. It's one of the worst.\n3:38 Comment: Caliber.\n3:40 Comment: Ribery.\n3:44 Comment: Götze.\n3:50 Comment: Fred was trying to give him a hard time, but Ribery got involved.\n3:53 Comment: And again!\n3:56 Comment: It's a third goal for Bayern Munich early in the second half.\n4:2 Comment: Ribery scores it.\n4:4 Comment: And now they're in a rush to secure that corner final goal.\n4:8 Comment: You don't need to watch any of it, do you?\n4:10 Comment: It's a great goal from Frank Ribery.\n4:12 Comment: To be absolutely honest with you, he's good football.\n4:14 Comment: Patient play from Götze on the right-hand side.\n4:17 Comment: Eventually releases Ribery.\n4:20 Comment: Somebody must have said he's looking a bit heavy.\n4:23 Comment: He's still at the bottom. He's jumping out.\n4:25 Comment: You can see little ball in. To be very Jerome Boateng, he plays a big part in it.\n4:28 Comment: Little give and go. Drill. Far corner.\n4:32 Comment: It's just all too easy for Bayern.\n4:34 Comment: Good play from Jerome Boateng as to give it back.\n4:37 Comment: He probably doesn't miss very often from there, but he does a few now.\n4:42 Comment: Ribery's fourth goal in the last seven games in his 299th match for Bayern Munich.\n4:49 Comment: A tidy finish, indeed.\n4:53 Comment: Now he's got one.\n4:55 Comment: He might be looking for another one.\n4:58 Comment: He knows the problem he's got now, Lukas Kuck.\n5:1 Comment: You don't want to be getting thought six and seven because\n5:3 Comment: Bayern are obviously getting another one.\n5:5 Comment: They're either going to cruise it or everybody that's got a goal, he's going to want another one.\n5:11 Comment: Including Lewandowski, who hasn't actually got one yet.\n5:13 Comment: He will definitely, but definitely, look to be scoring this evening.\n5:19 Comment: Schweinsteiger. Alaba.\n5:25 Comment: Here is Lewandowski.\n5:27 Comment: No foul.\n5:41 Comment: They're probably taking this one.\n5:43 Comment: I'm trying to get them something, but anything.\n5:45 Comment: This is going to be a long, long four-attack.\n5:54 Comment: Ribery, can he get to this?\n5:57 Comment: He did.\n5:58 Comment: It's another one.\n6:2 Comment: The ten men of Shakhtar, predictably, are crumbling.\n6:13 Comment: Bayern have this second of the game.\n6:15 Comment: Too easy again, isn't it?\n6:17 Comment: I did say they looked a little bit shell-shocked.\n6:21 Comment: He knows it's done and dusted now.\n6:23 Comment: If he even did a half-time or two.\n6:25 Comment: He does really well here, Ribery.\n6:26 Comment: He just has to catch it, just and no more, doesn't he?\n6:29 Comment: He's the goalkeeper again, he's just a tad unlucky, because he gets a big finger on it.\n6:33 Comment: All he does is, unfortunately, divert it off his own defender to Thomas Muller.\n6:37 Comment: Muller again, rapid to react.\n6:41 Comment: Side foot, definitely not out of play.\n6:43 Comment: Hits the defender, nothing 13 can do about it.\n6:47 Comment: Vasilije Shevchuk straight to Thomas Muller.\n6:50 Comment: Open goal, right foot, 4-0.\n6:53 Comment: It would be 6 or 7.\n6:57 Comment: You really wouldn't want to be a Shakhtar player at the moment with so long left.\n7:3 Comment: Is that reaction not for one minute, that Muller was going to take him off?\n7:8 Comment: You just want to go home now, have you?\n7:23 Comment: Absolutely.\n7:24 Comment: I was going to say, had it been a group game, regardless of last 16,\n7:28 Comment: you've got a position where Bayern are flying,\n7:33 Comment: you're obviously, in terms of numbers, one better off.\n7:37 Comment: Shakhtar are completely and utterly done and dusted.\n7:40 Comment: You've got Muller who's on a hat-trick, Lewandowski hasn't scored yet.\n7:44 Comment: Red Bull's got one, which means they'll want two.\n7:47 Comment: It's not as if they're going to take a four, but that's Shakhtar's biggest problem.\n7:51 Comment: If they've had a little bit in the game, and it's over 2.5 goals,\n7:54 Comment: you can relax. It's over 3.5 and imagine, if they're going big,\n7:57 Comment: you want Bayern to get another one.\n7:59 Comment: But certainly in terms of them going to be in the next Champions League status.\n8:4 Comment: This is the goal.\n8:5 Comment: A little bit of play beforehand with Mario Götze,\n8:8 Comment: a little flick behind, was excellent play.\n8:11 Comment: A little given goal.\n8:13 Comment: I can't believe it was that, it was a normal goal.\n8:20 Comment: It doesn't get much easier than this in the Champions League.\n8:26 Comment: Certainly in the knockout stage.\n8:34 Comment: Götze.\n8:38 Comment: Livery returns it.\n8:39 Comment: Now Schweinsteiger.\n8:45 Comment: Livery.\n8:49 Comment: Turn by Lewandowski.\n8:50 Comment: Alaba.\n8:54 Comment: Götze.\n9:4 Comment: I can't imagine there'll be a rush to come on the Shakhtar vent.\n9:10 Comment: I'm just watching them hiding behind Dante in case they get the call from along the touchline.\n9:16 Comment: I'll get him warm up, but I'll hide behind Dante, he's the biggest.\n9:22 Comment: Zinner's through.\n9:25 Comment: Sierra.\n9:26 Comment: Alaba.\n9:28 Comment: Support clearance, Stepanenko onto it.\n9:31 Comment: To Sierra.\n9:32 Comment: Zinner.\n9:35 Comment: On the way through to Luis Adriano.\n9:39 Comment: Simpson sends that in.\n9:41 Comment: It dribbles just wide for a corner.\n9:44 Comment: And it's a goal.\n9:53 Comment: It dribbles just wide for a corner.\n9:56 Comment: I was unlucky, I thought he'd done it. I really did.\n9:58 Comment: Just the slightest of touches from Adriano.\n10:3 Comment: He almost gets this.\n10:4 Comment: A nice little ball in and he just about gets in front of the defender, but just not quite enough.\n10:11 Comment: Bayern could be on for a classic counter-attack here.\n10:17 Comment: Shakhtar well outnumbered, desperately trying to get back.\n10:20 Comment: Ribery is held up by Fred on the board as well.\n10:24 Comment: He's done a bit of that tonight.\n10:25 Comment: He's done really, really well.\n10:27 Comment: He certainly wasn't favoured by any means.\n10:29 Comment: He's actually got a bit of pace, Fred, you know.\n10:31 Comment: He's pretty quick.\n10:32 Comment: I think that helped him here big time.\n10:34 Comment: He's done really well, actually, over the two legs.\n10:36 Comment: I know he's been happy in the O's.\n10:40 Comment: His position to get the ball this evening has been not that often, but anything he's been asked to do.\n10:46 Comment: Certainly the defensive mode has been excellent.\n10:50 Comment: He's got a bit of a stride, too.\n10:59 Comment: Only ten minutes into the second half.\n11:1 Comment: Bayern Munich four-nil up.\n11:3 Comment: They look in no mood to declare yet.\n11:7 Comment: Ribery.\n11:15 Comment: Schweinsteiger.\n11:20 Comment: Götze takes over.\n11:26 Comment: Here's Adriano.\n11:28 Comment: Shadowed here by Roda.\n11:32 Comment: Lachitsky.\n11:35 Comment: Ribery hobbling.\n11:41 Comment: Could have been that one if he wanted to.\n11:45 Comment: Left-hand side, maybe bring him on left back, throw Alaba forwards.\n11:48 Comment: Probably for set-up.\n11:53 Comment: A great turn to run it off.\n12:0 Comment: This is a bit of a concern for him.\n12:1 Comment: It's on the upper body.\n12:3 Comment: Can he allow him to do this?\n12:4 Comment: Is he going to be able to do something?\n12:18 Comment: Stuber.\n12:20 Comment: Ruffinia.\n12:26 Comment: Stephanieko is down and hurt.\n12:33 Comment: He's in a bit of pain as well.\n12:35 Comment: He's taken one now.\n12:42 Comment: The referee in the middle of the picture there put a big park tonight.\n12:44 Comment: This is a man that runs into him, isn't it?\n12:47 Comment: Lachitsky.\n12:50 Comment: Has nothing to do with any Bayern player.\n12:54 Comment: It's a big call from William Colham.\n12:56 Comment: Wasn't it early on in the game?\n12:57 Comment: On that red card, straight red as well.\n12:59 Comment: That will be the change.\n13:3 Comment: Juan Bernat, a sign from Valencia last summer.\n13:14 Comment: Stephanieko receiving lengthy treatment here.\n13:22 Comment: The referee's game is over but he's made a contribution to the cause with that third goal.\n13:27 Comment: Perfectly placed into the bottom corner.\n13:31 Comment: It's a bit of motion in there.\n13:32 Comment: A kick in the ankle, wasn't it?\n13:35 Comment: Probably right on the bone.\n13:36 Comment: It'd be sore but it'd be alright.\n13:38 Comment: Get a better look here.\n13:39 Comment: So body, upper strength.\n13:40 Comment: Is he just going to look?\n13:41 Comment: Right there.\n13:44 Comment: A little kick on the ankle.\n13:45 Comment: Right on the bone.\n13:46 Comment: It's a sore one.\n13:48 Comment: You'll feel a lot better every time you see that.\n13:51 Comment: That was his parting shot from Grieber.\n13:55 Comment: Here's a face by Bernat.\n13:58 Comment: Some good hands, Dr. Miller-Wolfhardt there, the famous doctor.\n14:3 Comment: Bayern and Angelo.\n14:14 Comment: Bernat has been a regular starter since his move from Valencia.\n14:18 Comment: Stephanieko is back on his feet.\n14:29 Comment: Almost an hour played in Munich.\n14:35 Comment: It's a question really of how many Bayern fans...\n14:38 Comment: That little break in play was maybe just what Shakhtar needed.\n14:42 Comment: Bayern were really motored at one point.\n14:44 Comment: Every time they got the ball, they were looking to go forward.\n14:47 Comment: That little kill in play might just settle everybody down\n14:51 Comment: and realise that they don't really need to do an awful lot more Bayern.\n15:8 Comment: Half an hour to go.\n15:10 Comment: Might feel that longer for Shakhtar.\n15:15 Comment: Fred, intercepted by Roda.\n15:18 Comment: Schoensteiger now onto it.\n15:20 Comment: Here is Bernat just on.\n15:22 Comment: Halibut to his left.\n15:24 Comment: Lewandowski ahead of him.\n15:27 Comment: He's lucky, it's a nice little run in a dink forward.\n15:29 Comment: I thought he was going to play out to the left.\n15:30 Comment: He just tries to play it, Lewandowski, and he was offside.\n15:33 Comment: I didn't know that because he just didn't quite take control of it.\n15:35 Comment: Little dink through, just offside.\n15:42 Comment: Bayern Munich have now scored four goals or more, 12 times this season.\n15:49 Comment: You asked exactly what you were saying, before we started.\n15:51 Comment: We looked at the starting, let's go front five then.\n15:54 Comment: Lewandowski, Robben, Ribery, Götze, Willer.\n15:57 Comment: We were just looking at the starting five.\n16:0 Comment: Lewandowski, Robben, Ribery, Götze, Willer.\n16:4 Comment: Schoensteiger needs to get involved.\n16:5 Comment: It's a pretty formidable front end that they've got.\n16:11 Comment: Halibut.\n16:15 Comment: Götze.\n16:18 Comment: Darius Söner trying to dig that one out.\n16:21 Comment: Only as far as Halibut though.\n16:22 Comment: Götze.\n16:26 Comment: Bernat.\n16:27 Comment: Picking up with Roda nicely.\n16:28 Comment: Progressing very nicely.\n16:31 Comment: Bernat off to make the save.\n16:36 Comment: I don't know how much he knows of it,\n16:37 Comment: but it's because this goes between his legs,\n16:39 Comment: and somehow manages not to end up in the back of the net.\n16:41 Comment: Lovely little drop of the right shoulder, drills it.\n16:44 Comment: Just off the heel.\n16:45 Comment: Does really well, really, really well.\n16:52 Comment: Bernat almost making a startling impact,\n16:54 Comment: having just been pitched in by Pep Guardiola.\n16:58 Comment: Götze.\n17:24 Comment: Affini with the cross.\n17:26 Comment: It's Bad Stuber this time.\n17:29 Comment: It's showtime in the Allianz Arena.\n17:32 Comment: 5-0, possibly counting.\n17:36 Comment: He was only one I thought might not have scored today.\n17:39 Comment: It's a great header, isn't it?\n17:40 Comment: It's good play, again, patient play.\n17:43 Comment: They're getting more tired, Shakhtar,\n17:44 Comment: they're leaving bigger spaces in those wider areas.\n17:47 Comment: And all he's done is put the ball into the near post.\n17:51 Comment: Bad Stuber.\n17:52 Comment: Attacking the header.\n17:53 Comment: Goalkeeper gets a little bit of it.\n17:55 Comment: Good, powerful header.\n17:56 Comment: A little bit, not enough.\n17:58 Comment: And an unlikely scorer makes it 5-0.\n18:6 Comment: Bad Stuber,\n18:8 Comment: who's had a game injury for nearly two years,\n18:12 Comment: scores only his second goal for Bayern Munich.\n18:15 Comment: Scores only his second goal for Bayern Munich.\n18:21 Comment: Götze's a good header,\n18:22 Comment: he's got the ball in from Affini as well.\n18:24 Comment: He just comes away from defenders.\n18:26 Comment: They've chucked it.\n18:27 Comment: You've got to pick up,\n18:28 Comment: you've got to go to your marker there.\n18:29 Comment: But as soon as he gets away,\n18:30 Comment: he's a free header.\n18:32 Comment: There's nothing really the goalkeeper can do about it,\n18:33 Comment: albeit he's got a hand to it.\n18:35 Comment: Power in the header.\n18:38 Comment: That's not for Bad Stuber to go.\n18:40 Comment: Did you just say his record?\n18:42 Comment: He's got one in 800 games,\n18:44 Comment: he doesn't get a lot.\n18:51 Comment: This is the only goal for Bayern Munich in 2009.\n18:56 Comment: I knew it would be quite a long time.\n18:58 Comment: I think he's been in a horrendous injury,\n19:0 Comment: not only one but two.\n19:2 Comment: It's a reoccurrence of the same injury,\n19:4 Comment: and it's fantastic to see him come back,\n19:5 Comment: it really is.\n19:6 Comment: Good news.\n19:8 Comment: He was suspended for the 2012 final against Chelsea,\n19:10 Comment: injured against Borussia Dortmund the year after his only due.\n19:13 Comment: A final appearance perhaps,\n19:15 Comment: a lot of work to be done before that will happen,\n19:18 Comment: but Bayern's work is pretty much done for the night,\n19:22 Comment: it's just a question of how many they fancy scoring.\n19:31 Comment: They're heading for their worst defeat in Europe.\n19:36 Comment: It's just heart-wrenching on them to be fair.\n19:38 Comment: They would have been happy with a 0-0 in the first leg,\n19:40 Comment: maybe could have scored actually,\n19:41 Comment: albeit there wasn't too many chances.\n19:43 Comment: Coming into the game,\n19:45 Comment: they'd certainly be looking forward to it,\n19:47 Comment: because if they'd have scored first,\n19:49 Comment: that would have had Munich right on the back foot.\n19:51 Comment: And over here for Roda,\n19:53 Comment: just didn't quite manage to smuggle that through.\n19:56 Comment: He was unlucky,\n19:58 Comment: I don't want to lay it all on William Colm's doorstep,\n20:2 Comment: but he did play a big part,\n20:4 Comment: giving the red card instead of a yellow.\n20:6 Comment: There's going to be one more change, Dante.\n20:11 Comment: Halibut trying to slide that through to Muller.\n20:15 Comment: Still no goal for Lewandowski yet.\n20:24 Comment: Douglas Costa.\n20:28 Comment: Skipped away from Rafinha,\n20:30 Comment: but his cross was too far away from Luis Adriano.\n20:33 Comment: He's unlucky, it's a good ball in,\n20:35 Comment: he just moved it too much,\n20:37 Comment: and Luis Adriano took it.\n20:39 Comment: Most of the game he's been chasing shadows,\n20:41 Comment: and just didn't quite anticipate that little ball.\n20:43 Comment: Matt Stuber's done enough,\n20:45 Comment: gets a goal, plays an hour.\n20:48 Comment: His tenth appearance of the season.\n20:51 Comment: A very rare goal for Hogland, Matt Stuber.\n20:55 Comment: Dante will come on.\n20:57 Comment: Dante, who was almost subbed off for half an hour\n20:59 Comment: against Hanover on the weekend,\n21:1 Comment: when Guardiola changed the attack on the three at the back.\n21:4 Comment: And he's got a chance to score.\n21:5 Comment: Guardiola changed the attack on the three at the back.\n21:12 Comment: A good one here for Matt Stuber after\n21:15 Comment: 20 months out with bruciate ligament damage.\n21:19 Comment: He's done well tonight, he's got a goal,\n21:23 Comment: he'll be feeling absolutely high, high, high for sure.\n21:28 Comment: It's an opportunity to give Dante a nice little run out,\n21:31 Comment: who will be needed towards the end of the season,\n21:33 Comment: presumably to the end of this competition as well.\n21:36 Comment: Gets up, Bernat's cross, collected by Piatov.\n21:53 Comment: Foul by Dante.\n22:3 Comment: They're all smiles on the bench and Philipp Lahm won't be needed tonight,\n22:7 Comment: but he'll be back to play his part in the run-in.\n22:15 Comment: Bullock.\n22:17 Comment: Look at the space here for Lewandowski.\n22:25 Comment: He's determined to give a shot away, but that wasn't really an option.\n22:28 Comment: Schweinsteiger.\n22:30 Comment: It's road up.\n22:32 Comment: It's almost too easy for Bayern.\n22:34 Comment: He just took too much time on the ball there, didn't he?\n22:36 Comment: He's got to move it quick.\n22:38 Comment: As soon as it comes in, it's one touch and it's got to go.\n22:40 Comment: Maximum two touches around the box.\n22:42 Comment: Like you say, he probably thought it was too easy and there was no one on him.\n22:45 Comment: And again, actually, it was Fred who was back,\n22:48 Comment: making sure he didn't get all his own way.\n22:52 Comment: At least Douglas Costa has been a little quieter,\n22:55 Comment: which is good news for Shakhtar.\n22:56 Comment: Yellow card for him.\n22:58 Comment: In the bath.\n23:13 Comment: Lewandowski, unable to set up Götze.\n23:16 Comment: Dario Sane is going to have to take it away.\n23:19 Comment: Trante around.\n23:21 Comment: And it's in.\n23:22 Comment: Seriously.\n23:26 Comment: We should log that.\n23:28 Comment: Because I can't remember Mario Götze ever really\n23:30 Comment: making that much of a challenge with a real free kick.\n23:33 Comment: But we're going to have to change that.\n23:35 Comment: Teixeira will be replaced here by another Brazilian,\n23:38 Comment: El Senhor, who's in his second spell with Shakhtar.\n23:41 Comment: Actually, one more time.\n23:43 Comment: And it's in.\n23:51 Comment: Shakhtar actually won the UEFA Cup in his first spell back in 2009.\n24:1 Comment: The Brazilians, from middle to front for Shakhtar,\n24:5 Comment: never really given a chance to show what they can do.\n24:7 Comment: Tonight,\n24:9 Comment: you'd find they were down to ten men so early.\n24:16 Comment: There's a limitation for them now, although\n24:17 Comment: sometimes it's hard to even limit that against Bayern Munich.\n24:21 Comment: I wonder what the first goal said to El Senhor when he came on.\n24:24 Comment: Go and enjoy it and get six goals.\n24:32 Comment: It's a bit of a struggle for them second half, isn't it?\n24:34 Comment: They are getting training, they're a little tired.\n24:36 Comment: There's been many chances, but\n24:38 Comment: giving the ball away and just giving it back to Bayern\n24:41 Comment: have been on the back foot for most of the second half.\n24:44 Comment: They have been on the back foot for most of the second half.\n24:58 Comment: Schweinsteiger.\n25:7 Comment: Raphinha.\n25:14 Comment: Halibut.\n25:24 Comment: Side against Lewandowski.\n25:37 Comment: They're both in, aren't they?\n25:39 Comment: Long jump and high jump.\n25:41 Comment: Kipar.\n25:44 Comment: That's expensive, that camera, isn't it?\n25:46 Comment: Fantastic.\n25:49 Comment: It would be a toss-up to see who costs the most.\n25:59 Comment: With a throw by Schweinsteiger.\n26:11 Comment: Burnett.\n26:14 Comment: Schweinsteiger.\n26:18 Comment: Boateng.\n26:25 Comment: Here's Burnett.\n26:40 Comment: Raphinha.\n26:44 Comment: Halibut.\n26:46 Comment: Lewandowski.\n26:48 Comment: To put his name on the score sheet.\n26:50 Comment: Will he now?\n26:52 Comment: Skirting a few issues.\n26:54 Comment: It's just a little ejection of pace, I think he's the only one.\n26:58 Comment: He says, come on, hurry up.\n27:0 Comment: And he'll get himself a goal.\n27:2 Comment: Too many bodies there.\n27:4 Comment: It's a bit of a struggle for them second half, isn't it?\n27:6 Comment: They're both in, aren't they?\n27:8 Comment: It's a bit of a struggle for them second half, isn't it?\n27:10 Comment: They're both in, aren't they?\n27:12 Comment: It's a bit of a struggle for them second half, isn't it?\n27:14 Comment: Slalom quite well through them, but just too many.\n27:20 Comment: Goetze.\n27:22 Comment: With a sense of purpose.\n27:24 Comment: Breaks down.\n27:27 Comment: Costa.\n27:41 Comment: Another foul by Goetze.\n27:44 Comment: Someone else a careful hit there.\n27:47 Comment: There was enough contact for it to be a foul.\n27:56 Comment: He's not happy about something again, is he?\n28:1 Comment: And that's the end of that Mr. Mignolet face on the wall.\n28:3 Comment: There's another little jab as well.\n28:6 Comment: It's not a fun game for him to be unhappy about something.\n28:14 Comment: Goetze.\n28:17 Comment: Mullah.\n28:19 Comment: Atric, very...\n28:21 Comment: Unable to...\n28:23 Comment: Quite bring that under control.\n28:27 Comment: Stepanenko.\n28:29 Comment: Senior for Douglas Costa.\n28:34 Comment: Goetze.\n28:36 Comment: Mullah.\n28:38 Comment: Atric, very...\n28:40 Comment: Unable to...\n28:42 Comment: Quite bring that under control.\n28:44 Comment: Douglas Costa.\n29:5 Comment: Goetze.\n29:7 Comment: Svein Snage with a quick switch here.\n29:9 Comment: What a chance now for Lewandowski!\n29:12 Comment: He's got it!\n29:14 Comment: He's got his goal!\n29:16 Comment: And about time too.\n29:18 Comment: An exhibition of goals from Bayern Munich.\n29:22 Comment: 6-0.\n29:24 Comment: That's a lovely pass.\n29:26 Comment: They've just got a line of sight before they get any more time.\n29:31 Comment: Not for one minute he'd miss his chance because the ball's coming down and he'll only chase it perfectly to go forward.\n29:37 Comment: This is the ball.\n29:39 Comment: Definitely on sight this time.\n29:41 Comment: Just that little touch there just drops down on top of him.\n29:42 Comment: Still can't do anything about it certainly because if he fouls him he knows it's a red card.\n29:48 Comment: Lewandowski just keeps him behind him and squeezes it against the goalie.\n29:52 Comment: Just gets a hand to it.\n29:54 Comment: Not enough to stop it going in.\n29:56 Comment: 6-0.\n29:58 Comment: I did say there'd be a few goals now but this is a shame.\n30:1 Comment: Still 15 minutes to go.\n30:3 Comment: Lewandowski finally gets him on the act.\n30:5 Comment: There's 20th Champions League goal in 36 matches in this competition.\n30:11 Comment: A rather reasonable return.\n30:13 Comment: Yeah, he'd be really happy.\n30:15 Comment: Really, really happy Pet Guardiola because there's nothing better as a coach than to see your striker hit the back of the net.\n30:21 Comment: And that's exactly what he wanted tonight.\n30:24 Comment: And just as we said with 15 minutes or whatever to go, I certainly would have put it past him to think I won another one.\n30:34 Comment: I won another one.\n30:42 Comment: Kvitsov allowed back on after treatment.\n30:45 Comment: Shakhtar forlorn figures and they have been for a while.\n30:54 Comment: I just said shame there, that was probably the wrong way to describe it I suppose.\n30:58 Comment: I do feel for Shakhtar a little bit because they've never really had the opportunity to be in the game and have a sustained pressure on Bayern with a full complement of players.\n31:7 Comment: As much as Bayern are obviously delighted, a lot of neutrals will be unhappy with the way it's been just so one-sided.\n31:14 Comment: We never really got to see the best of Shakhtar if they could have put Bayern under any sort of pressure this evening whatsoever.\n31:25 Comment: Schweinsteiger.\n31:28 Comment: He's coasting through the game tonight, it's absolutely coasting through the game.\n31:34 Comment: Never under pressure, he's a friend of the player.\n31:41 Comment: Rafinha.\n31:46 Comment: Schweinsteiger.\n31:51 Comment: Corotta.\n31:58 Comment: Rafinha.\n32:10 Comment: Halibut.\n32:14 Comment: Goetze here.\n32:16 Comment: Back heel from Muller didn't work out but I suppose when you're 16 up you can try those things.\n32:23 Comment: Luis Adriano.\n32:28 Comment: Fred.\n32:32 Comment: Douglas Costa.\n32:38 Comment: Oh dear, the sun's up tonight.\n32:40 Comment: Yeah a little bit.\n32:42 Comment: I thought for one minute Douglas Costa was going to try and have a dig and send us a kind of goal out of there as well.\n32:48 Comment: Douglas Costa is being replaced here by Wellington Nem who came on in the first leg, 8 on.\n32:58 Comment: So we're trying to use all their sides now.\n33:3 Comment: I don't like to be substituted but I imagine Douglas Costa's quite happy.\n33:8 Comment: It's been a real tough one for him, just chasing shadows in the middle of the park most of the time.\n33:14 Comment: And some of them's have probably made the time now.\n33:28 Comment: Schweinsteiger.\n33:43 Comment: Dante.\n33:50 Comment: You can almost feel Shakhtar's pain.\n33:53 Comment: It certainly hasn't been easy has it?\n33:58 Comment: Probably I'm just looking to the left here, it's only 79 minutes, there's still quite a way to go for them to eventually be distinguished.\n34:12 Comment: Wellington Nem.\n34:22 Comment: Kitsky goes long.\n34:25 Comment: I don't know why he was angling for a rare touch there.\n34:28 Comment: He's surprised he's not going in a solo lead.\n34:32 Comment: Monarch.\n34:35 Comment: He could still compete at Hat-Trick.\n34:45 Comment: Marouda.\n34:48 Comment: He's got a bit of a run in there.\n34:56 Comment: Back by Shakhtar, but not for long.\n34:59 Comment: Moura.\n35:14 Comment: Schweinsteiger.\n35:22 Comment: Rafinha.\n35:24 Comment: Marouda.\n35:32 Comment: Boateng.\n35:38 Comment: Lewandowski.\n35:39 Comment: Showing some urgency here.\n35:43 Comment: Quite a set up Muller though, after the free kick.\n35:45 Comment: He's got a bit of a run in there.\n35:51 Comment: I think Cerner, he goes for the one-two.\n35:55 Comment: I think Cerner just holds his arm up and goes right into him.\n35:59 Comment: You get a better look and you see the replay.\n36:1 Comment: Little one.\n36:3 Comment: Well there's an arm and he just makes sure he doesn't go past him.\n36:5 Comment: So it's Kritsov.\n36:10 Comment: He's alright.\n36:11 Comment: He's motioning to the referee that Cerner was an elbow in his face.\n36:15 Comment: But he was right.\n36:29 Comment: He's making sure he wasn't going anywhere.\n36:32 Comment: Shakhtar nearly waiting to be put out of their misery,\n36:34 Comment: which might not be complete yet if Bayern are to add to their six goals.\n36:39 Comment: To be fair, in the last five minutes or so, it's looked a little bit\n36:44 Comment: paceless and it won't be really time that the ball goes to Lewandowski.\n36:47 Comment: There's maybe things quicken up as he probably tries to get himself in a position\n36:50 Comment: where he might nick another one.\n36:51 Comment: It might be this chance.\n36:53 Comment: It's Roda.\n36:55 Comment: He's got a run in there.\n37:0 Comment: It's Roda.\n37:1 Comment: Muller for the hat-trick.\n37:2 Comment: That's it, wide.\n37:4 Comment: Chance.\n37:5 Comment: Really good chance.\n37:6 Comment: Just try to steer it in the near post.\n37:7 Comment: Good ball from Sebastian Roda.\n37:10 Comment: Intelligent play.\n37:11 Comment: Looks up.\n37:12 Comment: Sees the near post run.\n37:13 Comment: Lovely ball in.\n37:14 Comment: They were lucky.\n37:30 Comment: Well done.\n37:34 Comment: Pulled up by Luis Adriano.\n37:36 Comment: Treading out.\n37:37 Comment: Shevchuk.\n37:40 Comment: Maybe a glimpse of goal here.\n37:42 Comment: He decides to go for it himself.\n37:53 Comment: There's another one for a moment.\n37:55 Comment: He digs it out.\n37:56 Comment: Steers high.\n37:58 Comment: He scored in the league last month, Shevchuk.\n38:0 Comment: It was his first goal for three and a half years.\n38:2 Comment: He's obviously feeling confident.\n38:5 Comment: His head it is of goal scoring.\n38:8 Comment: Roda.\n38:23 Comment: Gutser.\n38:25 Comment: Lewandowski has cracked that one.\n38:28 Comment: Wide.\n38:38 Comment: If they scored six, they could have been close to double figures.\n38:42 Comment: Van Dijk.\n38:54 Comment: Van Dijk has now scored 97 goals this season.\n38:57 Comment: They weren't at their best in the first leg.\n39:0 Comment: In Lviv, a goal of Struor.\n39:3 Comment: They haven't had to really be at their best tonight after Shakhtar went down to ten men so early.\n39:9 Comment: It's been a stroll.\n39:26 Comment: It might have been anyway.\n39:28 Comment: But Shakhtar will say that you never know what they've ever meant.\n39:33 Comment: For more of the game anyway.\n39:37 Comment:

    "summary": "**Bayern Munich vs. Shakhtar Donetsk: A Masterclass in Dominance**\n\nIn a riveting Champions League round of 16 clash at the Allianz Arena, Bayern Munich showcased their footballing prowess with a resounding 7-0 victory over Shakhtar Donetsk. The Bavarian giants left nothing to chance, dismantling their Ukrainian opponents with a potent mix of precision, power, and relentless attacking football.\n\nFrom the outset, it was apparent that Bayern had come prepared to rectify the shortcomings of their goalless first leg. Shakhtar, on the other hand, faced an uphill battle almost immediately. Within the first moments of the game, Thomas Muller converted a penalty, and Shakhtar's Alexander Kucher was shown a red card, reducing the visitors to ten men. This early setback for Shakhtar set the tone for the rest of the match.\n\n**The Early Blow: The Game-Changing Penalty**\n\nRight from kickoff, Bayern Munich asserted their dominance with fluid ball movement and high pressure. The first major incident occurred when Mario Götze was brought down in the box by Kucher. The referee immediately pointed to the spot, and after a brief consultation, showed Kucher a straight red card for the foul. It was a harsh decision, considering the minimal contact, but it was enough to put Shakhtar on the back foot.\n\nThomas Muller stepped up confidently to take the penalty and slotted it home with ease, giving Bayern a 1-0 lead and leaving Shakhtar to play with ten men for nearly the entire match. Bayern's advantage was not just in terms of the scoreline but also in numbers, and they wasted no time in exploiting this.\n\n**First Half: Bayern Continues to Press**\n\nDespite being a man down, Shakhtar showed brief moments of resilience, with Luis Adriano trying to make something happen for his team. However, Bayern's relentless pressure and superior passing kept the visitors largely pegged back.\n\nBayern's attack, led by the likes of Franck Ribery, Robert Lewandowski, and Arjen Robben, created numerous opportunities. Robben’s evening was cut short due to a hamstring tweak, leading to an early substitution with Sebastian Roda, yet the Bavarians maintained their intensity.\n\nMoment after moment, Bayern's attacking unit probed Shakhtar’s defense. Muller's intuitive positioning and work rate, combined with the creativity of Ribery and Götze, constantly threatened to increase the lead. However, Shakhtar's defense, marshaled by Dario Serna and Yaroslav Rakitskiy, managed to contain Bayern’s onslaught to some extent.\n\n**Scrappy Second Goal: Boateng Pounces**\n\nJust as it seemed that Bayern might have to be content with a slim halftime lead, Jerome Boateng added a second goal in a somewhat scrappy fashion. After a flurry in the box and a series of attempts, Boateng scrambled the ball over the line following a rebound off the goalkeeper’s save from Lewandowski’s initial shot. It was not a typical Bayern goal, marked by their usual finesse, but it was effective nonetheless.\n\n**Second Half: Rampant Bayern**\n\nAs the second half commenced, Bayern wasted no time in asserting their control over the match. They displayed a high tempo and immaculate ball control, continuously stretching Shakhtar's defense. Franck Ribery, who had been fiery and slightly flustered during moments in the first half due to a challenge from Douglas Costa, channeled his energy productively. Within minutes of the restart, Ribery was on the scoresheet. After a clever interchange with Götze and Boateng, Ribery drilled the ball into the far corner, making it 3-0.\n\nBayern seemed unrelenting in their pursuit of goals. Ribery, brimming with confidence, laid on an assist for Muller to score the fourth. Ribery's quick feet and precise passing opened up space, and Muller, showing his predatory instincts, was on hand to tap home from close range. This goal further demoralized an already deflated Shakhtar side.\n\n**No Mercy: Adding to the Tally**\n\nBayern's fifth goal came through a somewhat unexpected source, as Holger Badstuber, who had recently returned from nearly two years out due to injury, rose highest to meet a Rafinha cross and head the ball past Piatov. It was a rewarding moment for the defender, marking only his second goal for Bayern and symbolizing his successful return from injury turmoil.\n\nRobert Lewandowski, who had been eagerly prowling for a goal, finally made his mark by scoring Bayern's sixth. The Polish striker exhibited his poise and finishing prowess, deftly maneuvering past Shakhtar defenders and calmly slotting the ball past Piatov.\n\nMario Götze sealed the scoring emphatically, netting Bayern’s seventh goal after combining beautifully with his fellow attackers. His clinical finish cemented the rout and provided a fitting end to a dominant performance.\n\n**Shakhtar’s Fruitless Efforts**\n\nShakhtar Donetsk managed fleeting moments of respite, occasionally venturing into Bayern's half. Luis Adriano and Fred tried to spark a revival, but against such a formidable opponent and being numerically disadvantaged, their efforts were in vain. Each Shakhtar offensive move was quickly nullified by Bayern’s disciplined defense and the imposing presence of Manuel Neuer.\n\nThe Ukrainian side's rare forays down Bayern's flanks were swiftly dealt with, and their attempts from set pieces bore no fruit. As time ticked away, Shakhtar's frustration grew, epitomized by fleeting skirmishes and yellow cards, including one for Douglas Costa, whose earlier incident with Ribery had already created a tense atmosphere.\n\n**A Night of Redemption and Celebration**\n\nFor Bayern Munich, it was a night of demonstration, not just of their unmatched footballing abilities but also their mental resilience. The disappointment of the first leg and the sting of past Champions League exits, particularly against Real Madrid, seemed to be driving them forward with relentless determination.\n\nThe Allianz Arena bore witness to a masterful display, as Bayern Munich broke records and reaffirmed their status as genuine contenders for the Champions League title. The Bavarians, led tactically by Pep Guardiola, ground Shakhtar into submission and celebrated a monumental 7-0 victory.\n\nBayern's performance was a statement of intent to the rest of Europe. With key players firing on all cylinders and others like Philipp Lahm waiting in the wings for a return from injury, Bayern Munich looked poised for a deep run in the competition.\n\nAs the final whistle blew, the players received a standing ovation from the home crowd. It was an evening where everything clicked for Bayern Munich, from the tactical setup to individual brilliance and collective harmony. They had not only booked their place in the quarter-finals but had done so in a manner that left a lasting impression on the footballing world."
