experiment.\n29:56 Comment: Schaltoff, Javi Garcia, Lombards.\n30:10 Comment: Hulck against Bender, not enough for a free kick here either, so Hulck a bit\n30:25 Comment: I think he is now unnerved and Witsel allows himself to be half violent\n30:30 Comment: here against Schalano.\n30:31 Comment: It looked like there was a bit of intent behind it from the Belgian.\n30:38 Comment: Yes.\n31:9 Comment: That's a good ball.\n31:19 Comment: There we have Bender's little nudge again.\n31:24 Comment: For me, he is right to let the game continue.\n31:28 Comment: Marienko Rondon is ready below.\n31:31 Comment: He will come soon.\n31:39 Comment: The team doesn't have a minute left.\n31:56 Comment: Double substitution.\n32:0 Comment: This will be uncomfortable for him too.\n32:4

how it is.\n33:14 Comment: Quite important, because Crescito would have been up and away.\n33:18 Comment: Now the double substitution.\n33:23 Comment: Kerzhakov leaves the field.\n33:26 Comment: For the beginner.\n33:27 Comment: So now Rondon is going in front.\n33:32 Comment: And Rias Sanze, midfielder, will also come.\n33:40 Comment: And Dani, the captain, has to go.\n33:44 Comment: Had a few really good scenes in the first half when he was able to set up Kerschakow.\n33:50 Comment: But in the second round it was still pretty submerged.\n33:53 Comment: The Portuguese almost logically.\n33:56 Comment: So leaves the place.\n33:57 Comment: Captain's Bindel.\n33:57 Comment: Passed on to Lombards.\n34:11 Comment: Leno, no problem.\n34:22 Comment: Free kick by Crescito.\n34:26 Comment: So, there it is again...\n34:27 Comment: Spalch, the same spot on the face.\n34:36 Comment: So he really has to hold on here now.\n34:38 Comment: Against Rondon.\n34:40 Comment: Just caught him again.\n34:42 Comment: Number 34, Dani.\n34:45 Comment: While player number 5, Alexander Prisak, is also substituted.\n34:51 Comment: And then again.\n34:57 Comment: And then he is...\n34:58 Comment: Yes, I think he hit Bönisch's shoulder.\n35:2 Comment: Now Crescito has some problem.\n35:10 Comment: And things are getting a bit more hectic.\n35:12 Comment: Everything was a child’s birthday for Leverkusen compared to the game in the Bundesliga last\n35:18 Comment: at Hamburger SV.\n35:19 Comment: But Zenit's nerves are now frayed.\n35:23 Comment: Slowly but surely.\n35:24 Comment: Ten minutes before the end.\n35:25 Comment: At the state of Leberkusen.\n35:26 Comment: When the score was 0-2.\n35:28 Comment: Crescito.\n35:29 Comment: There with Bender.\n35:30 Comment: Then Schalano Lolo joins in.\n35:33 Comment: He should also refrain from doing that.\n35:35 Comment: Leverkusen has also had a small discipline problem in recent weeks.\n35:46 Comment: Five expulsions in three different competitions.\n35:50 Comment: Most recently in Hamburg they got away without being sent off.\n35:55 Comment: Donati was probably pretty close.\n35:57 Comment: They also have the most fouls of all teams in the Champions League so far.\n36:4 Comment: Belarabi also sees yellow.\n36:5 Comment: Shatov too.\n36:10 Comment: So after only one yellow card in the first half, there is now\n36:20 Comment: a few more here.\n36:21 Comment: No HSV Leverkusen dimension.\n36:23 Comment: But 5 warning now.\n36:24 Comment: The warning now in total.\n36:38 Comment: Everything plays into Bayer's hands as time is running out after a 2-0 lead.\n36:44 Comment: By the way, they have never lost in the Champions League.\n36:46 Comment: But of course the goal must be to take the three points here.\n36:54 Comment: Janko, Janko, Janko, Janko, Janko, Janko, Janko, Janko, Janko, Janko, Janko, Janko, Janko.\n37:3 Comment: Prelude to Hulk.\n37:11 Comment: Here against Bender.\n37:20 Comment: Marjanko, the Spaniard, actually sees almost everything correctly.\n37:24 Comment: A little petty at the beginning, but perhaps in order not to let it get harsh,\n37:34 Comment: then here in the second half one or the other scene is mostly right,\n37:37 Comment: but also let it run more generously, especially against Hulk.\n37:41 Comment: This personally unnerved him a little bit.\n37:45 Comment: Rondon, the new guy.\n37:48 Comment: Rondon again, gets stuck on Bender.\n37:54 Comment: Lombard, Skaray.\n37:58 Comment: Two measly shots on goal from Zenit St. Petersburg in the second half.\n38:3 Comment: They had the opportunities in the first round.\n38:4 Comment: Donati, Son.\n38:9 Comment: Inspired by his two goals.\n38:12 Comment: At least get the corner out.\n38:17 Comment: Incidentally, just like in the first leg, Bayer scored twice within five minutes.\n38:24 Comment: In the first leg, in the 58th and 63rd minutes, it was Donati and Papadopoulos.\n38:30 Comment: Today 68th and 73rd. Twice Sunday.\n38:52 Comment: Corner already, Nolo.\n38:54 Comment: Third goal.\n38:54 Comment: Now there would be a little space.\n39:8 Comment: Schattdorf is complicated, have to wait.\n39:11 Comment: Hulck, this time it's a free kick for Zenit.\n39:23 Comment: Waited for the advantage, it fizzled out.\n39:25 Comment: There is the prelude by Kießling.\n39:41 Comment: And again this excellent free kick trick, just as deliberate, great from Bellarabi, Son\n39:51 Comment: and Chalanolu.\n39:52 Comment: And Kießling, who at least gets a goal contribution here again with this fine\n39:59 Comment: Pass to the South Korean.\n40:1 Comment: Once right, once left, 2-0 Leverkusen.\n40:6 Comment: Rondon.\n40:7 Comment: That was it.\n40:12 Comment: Toprak, Donati helps.\n40:15 Comment: There was quite a move there in the first few meters, Rondon.\n40:21 Comment: Toprak can be happy that Donati is coming to help.\n40:26 Comment: He has now played his way into the team with a really good performance on the right\n40:34 Comment: has.\n40:35 Comment: That was it.\n40:47 Comment: Valery Pene.\n40:48 Comment: That was really an interest and a real depth.\n40:55 Comment: But

Comment: Yellow again.\n41:14 Comment: Aschavin is also coming to Zenit.\n41:17 Comment: The great old Andrei Aschavin.\n41:28 Comment: Toronto Don for Kershakov is of course nonsense.\n41:31 Comment: We already had this change before.\n41:36 Comment: Andrei Aschavi is 33 years old now.\n41:40 Comment: The first time in the league.\n41:43 Comment: And now it's the third.\n41:46 Comment: Third short appearance in this Champions League season.\n41:50 Comment: Even in the league, he mostly comes off the bench.\n41:59 Comment: Shatov has left the square.\n42:2 Comment: Now it's only 3 minutes normally.\n42:6 Comment: Drimic.\n42:7 Comment: A lot will go wrong,\n42:10 Comment: if Leverkusen does not leave the field as winners.\n42:13 Comment: Bellarabi, Son.\n42:18 Comment: Well done, Drimic.\n42:25 Comment: Still Drimic.\n42:27 Comment: Now he could play it at some point.\n42:30 Comment: Donati, Drimic, Shalanolu.\n42:32 Comment: Of course, Son is now missing as a passing option,\n42:34 Comment: who has picked himself up again.\n42:37 Comment: Oh, Oh, Rene, if this is so daughterì\n42:54 Comment: Dvistavored image.\n42:56 Comment: We are\n43:0 Comment: Gecion.\n43:1

Initiate this yourself and then Rian's handself.\n43:35 Comment: All clean.\n43:37 Comment: Witzel is offside and does not intervene in the game.\n43:40 Comment: Class done by Jose Rondon.\n43:43

    "summary": "The thrilling Champions League encounter between Zenit Saint Petersburg and Bayer Leverkusen culminated in a dramatic and hard-fought 2-1 victory for Bayer. The game was played with high intensity and saw shifts in momentum, tactical adjustments, and key performances that defined the outcome.\n\nIn the first half, Bayer Leverkusen set the tone early, with an aggressive, attacking mindset. Leverkusen's Heung-Min Son was a constant threat, moving fluidly from left to right. Hulk, the powerful forward from Zenit, encountered Leverkusen's defender Jedvaj early, as Zenit sought to press high and catch Leverkusen off guard. Jedvaj, however, dealt with Hulk well initially. Leverkusen, under Roger Schmidt's instructions, deployed an extremely high defensive line, with almost every player positioned in Zenit's half.\n\nSpahic and Toprak were sturdy at the back for Leverkusen, regularly clearing the ball and marking Zenit’s forwards effectively. A notable incident happened around the third minute when there was a foul by Toprak, disrupting Zenit's attacking flow. However, the match tempo soon picked up again, with both teams vying for midfield control.\n\nLeverkusen’s attacking trident—Bellarabi on the right, Son on the left, and Brandt centrally—showed fluid movement but struggled to break through Zenit’s defensive setup in the early minutes. A highlight of the half was Hulk's fierce free-kick, which crashed against the post, demonstrating Zenit’s potential for danger from set pieces. This was the closest either team came to scoring during the first quarter of the match.\n\nLeverkusen had their own chances too; notably, around the eighth minute, Bellarabi had an opportunity on the rebound but decided to pass rather than shoot, missing what could have been a scoring chance. Defensive midfielder Bender and his counterparts were pivotal in breaking down Zenit’s offensive plays. As the half progressed, both teams exhibited defensive resilience. Spahic received treatment for an injury but gamely continued, showing the gritty nature of the confrontation.\n\nAnother defensive highlight for Leverkusen came from Jedvaj, who, despite being young, managed to keep Hulk at bay effectively until his substitution later in the game. Bellarabi, who alternated his positions frequently, tried to carve open Zenit’s defense with darting runs and clever positioning. By the midway point of the half, Leverkusen's possession statistics were dominating, hovering around 60%, but their passing accuracy was markedly low.\n\nZenit's key players like Witsel and Danny pushed forward but found Leverkusen’s defense, marshaled by goalie Leno, difficult to breach. The first half ended with a poignant sense of what might have been for both sides, particularly for Zenit, who had clearly missed several opportunities, the most significant being Hulk’s initial free-kick which hit the post.\n\nThe second half kicked off with both teams energetically pursuing a breakthrough. Leverkusen continued their aggressive press, forcing Zenit to play cautiously. Spahic, still nursing his fatigue, continued to push forward but was replaced by Boenisch later due to injury concerns. This substitution turned out to be crucial as Boenisch brought fresh legs to the Leverkusen defense.\n\nBayer capitalized on their tactical shifts and persistence at the 68th minute when a well-rehearsed free-kick paid dividends. Schala Noglu took a crafty free kick, leaving Zenit’s defense flatfooted. Son reacted swiftly and slotted the ball clinically into the bottom corner to break the deadlock. This was Son's first goal of the night, and it injected a vital boost of confidence into the team.\n\nThe game was now in Leverkusen’s favor, and they maintained the offensive pressure. Just five minutes later, the ball again found Son after an impressive setup by Kiessling. Son tore through Zenit’s defense with his electrifying pace, controlled the pass beautifully, and lobbed the ball over the onrushing goalkeeper, doubling Leverkusen's lead. This second blow left Zenit scrambling for composure as the German side’s confidence surged.\n\nZenit’s attempts to retaliate were evident, with Hulk and Rondon mounting persistent but ultimately fruitless attacks. Leverkusen’s defense stayed resolute, with Toprak and Bender excelling in their responsibilities to thwart Zenit's forward push. The tactical acumen of Leverkusen shone through as they transitioned to a more defensive setup, effectively safeguarding their two-goal advantage.\n\nWith time running out, Zenit introduced Ashavin, hoping for a last-ditch alteration to their offensive dynamism. Their perseverance paid off as they managed to pull one goal back. In the 89th minute, a well-crafted play saw Rondon slot in a goal past Leno. The goal led to a tense finale, with Zenit throwing everything they had at their opponents. \n\nLeverkusen held their ground as the clock ticked into injury time. The German side made a strategic final substitution with Robbie Cruz coming on to reinforce the midfield. Despite Zenit's relentless pressure in the dying minutes, Leverkusen held firm, exhibiting commendable discipline and tactical awareness. Their defense proved impenetrable, securing a well-earned victory.\n\nLeverkusen’s tactical evolution throughout the game was commendable. Initially opting for an aggressive high press, they adapted to a more balanced approach as the game progressed. Their execution of set-piece strategies highlighted their preparation and ingenuity. For Zenit, despite their initial dominance in possession and the early fervent attempts, the inability to convert opportunities into goals proved detrimental.\n\nThis victory placed Leverkusen in a strong position in their Champions League group, underscoring their intent to make a significant impact in the competition. Zenit, conversely, faced an uphill battle to secure qualification, needing to refine their offensive strategies and conversion rate in subsequent matches.\n\nIn conclusion, the match was characterized by tactical proficiency, disciplined defending, and moments of individual brilliance, notably from Leverkusen's Son. The game’s dynamic shifts and ultimate outcome reflected the competitive spirit and strategic depth emblematic of top-tier European football."
