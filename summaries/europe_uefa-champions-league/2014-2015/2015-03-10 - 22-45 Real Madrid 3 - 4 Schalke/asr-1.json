the\n9:47 Comment: country\n9:47 Comment: the team is down to the middle of the road\n9:50 Comment: you think he's going to get there\n9:53 Comment: Rovalie of Germany\n9:56 Comment: it's only cross is the one that sits in the middle from Madrid and I'm a big fan\n10:0 Comment: of him and he's got the ball at his feet he really does keep his team ticking\n10:3 Comment: over very well but you can run past him can run beyond him he's never gonna stay\n10:7 Comment: with anybody who really puts their head down and motors around Madrid still\n10:11 Comment: leading on aggregate courtesy there's first like Elson Cristiano Ronaldo from\n10:17 Comment: Bale finding Kedira.\n10:27 Comment: Moran.\n10:30 Comment: Now Quentral.\n10:33 Comment: Edson Moura's pulled out wide to that left-hand side.\n10:38 Comment: Isco.\n10:41 Comment: Ronaldo coming deep looking for the ball.\n10:44 Comment: He hasn't seen a great deal of it so far.\n10:46 Comment: Can't really see that either.\n10:48 Comment: Quentral's pass was poor but Isco was running pipe.\n10:52 Comment: It's a fine challenge by Gerva Des.\n10:54 Comment: Opportunity now for Bale.\n10:56 Comment: Is that a sign of the times?\n10:59 Comment: Because normally you would expect to see Gareth Bale swing that left foot and make an attempt on goal.\n11:5 Comment: Steady look for a rather nervous pass.\n11:8 Comment: Here's Barnetta with the cross.\n11:10 Comment: Choupo-Moting is there and Herc has a chance and hits it straight.\n11:13 Comment: That can see as the flag is up.\n11:15 Comment: It wouldn't have been a good idea.\n11:16 Comment: That's not counted.\n11:17 Comment: But again, Real Madrid were dismantled.\n11:19 Comment: Certainly were.\n11:20 Comment: Getting good numbers forward, Schalke.\n11:23 Comment: Again here you can see the flag's quite rightly going up there on Choupo-Moting.\n11:27 Comment: He's already just strayed a yard offside but the drop back is decent.\n11:32 Comment: If they can keep that back line tight themselves and deny Real Madrid,\n11:37 Comment: they're going to have more opportunities here.\n11:42 Comment: Come back to Gareth Bale, Clive.\n11:44 Comment: He's cut the times already when he's picked the ball up.\n11:45 Comment: Just think he needs to be a little bit more spontaneous and just get out the man directly in front of him.\n11:52 Comment: Take him on.\n11:53 Comment: He can run beyond most.\n11:54 Comment: He can beat most.\n11:55 Comment: A couple of times already now when he's got the ball.\n11:57 Comment: He's just immediately looking just to drop it off and give it to somebody else.\n12:0 Comment: He was jeered a couple of times during January for being too selfish for not passing.\n12:9 Comment: Maybe those whistles are still ringing in his ears.\n12:12 Comment: Although he nearly scored from 50 yards at the weekend.\n12:14 Comment: He did.\n12:15 Comment: Hit the post from way out.\n12:26 Comment: So far Real Madrid's problems are not so much in attack as in defence.\n12:33 Comment: Pepe's being out-injured.\n12:37 Comment: His usual running mate Sergio Ramos is still out-injured.\n12:44 Comment: The other guy that can be down-injured is Mourinho.\n12:46 Comment: He's got something really good with 對\n12:49 Comment: He's all about giving hatten in those\n13:1 Comment: The ball's really stuck like a candy canu in here for us.\n13:3 Comment: Harangas 있�avalde beauty\n13:12 Comment: He only gets past classic niñoseee.\n13:13 Comment: below as well to find Benzema\n13:18 Comment: now bail Stasic just about caught up with him\n13:22 Comment: challenging the end had to get something on that\n13:36 Comment: his first five months of the job have been a success Shaka were 12th in the\n13:40 Comment: table when he took over in October they're now fifth\n13:48 Comment: until our\n13:52 Comment: to promoting until our just wouldn't quite run for him\n13:59 Comment: and they defending less than convincing\n14:3 Comment: you can sense the anxiety the frustration on the tourists is that's\n14:6 Comment: exactly what Roberto Di Matteo would have wanted from his team\n14:10 Comment: quarter now coming up to the quarter now Mark haven't conceded and starting to pose a bit of a\n14:15 Comment: consistent threat\n14:26 Comment: Fuchs will take the throw in it's a hot one isn't it around with a header away\n14:31 Comment: it actually sailed over the two blue shirts at the near post\n14:35 Comment: Fuchs is in the lead\n14:40 Comment: he's going to get the ball\n14:42 Comment: while net up\n14:43 Comment: Hürger\n14:44 Comment: here's Huntelaar\n14:48 Comment: maybe just one pass too many\n14:51 Comment: just think he could have maybe let that run across his body hitting himself have a shot himself with his left foot there\n14:56 Comment: good play again\n14:57 Comment: that's been a goal in the other match for the last 16 this evening in Portugal\n15:6 Comment: Porto won Basel nil\n15:8 Comment: Porto lead 2-1 on aggregate\n15:10 Comment: Rahimi the scorer\n15:12 Comment: Juppe Moting with the cross\n15:14 Comment: Pepe with the header away\n15:16 Comment: this goes past a little ambitious\n15:26 Comment: Porto 2-1\n15:39 Comment: for Teo\n15:41 Comment: mirrors\n15:49 Comment: ot 01\n15:50 Comment: pushing\n16:2 Comment: Stassic\n16:3 Comment: ير\n16:6 Comment: Stassic\n16:7 Comment: and Pepe\n16:8 Comment: andgel\n16:8 Comment: Altepu\n16:9 Comment: Maier into Huntelaar.\n16:11 Comment: It's cut out by Isco.\n16:14 Comment: Dangerous, those cross-field passes.\n16:21 Comment: Nastasic here actually made his Manchester City debut\n16:23 Comment: on this ground three years ago in a Champions League game.\n16:28 Comment: In a back three, funnily enough, under Roberto Mancini.\n16:30 Comment: But injuries and changes in personnel.\n16:34 Comment: The Etihad saw him lose his place.\n16:37 Comment: And this is a fresh start for him on loan since January to Schalke.\n16:48 Comment: Isco.\n16:49 Comment: It was an eye over the needle ball and Pervinus saw it and got it.\n16:52 Comment: Can't really get the front boys involved enough yet, can they, Madrid?\n16:57 Comment: I have to bear in mind, of course, that they are 2-0 up.\n17:0 Comment: This is Max Maier.\n17:2 Comment: He's a precocious talent.\n17:4 Comment: He's 19 years of age.\n17:7 Comment: Already capped by Germany.\n17:9 Comment: He won't be happy with how far he was allowed to run.\n17:12 Comment: He won't be happy with the start that his team have made this evening.\n17:16 Comment: Because this has happened time and time again.\n17:17 Comment: When that ball is picked up and it's loose and there's a blue shirt that grabs it.\n17:22 Comment: Those players are committed.\n17:23 Comment: They're pouring forward.\n17:25 Comment: They're looking like they're starting to stretch, Real Madrid here.\n17:28 Comment: A couple of good girls in the Bundesliga at the weekend, Maier.\n17:31 Comment: So he's confident.\n17:37 Comment: Woutelaar.\n17:39 Comment: Choupo-Moting.\n17:42 Comment: Berger.\n17:44 Comment: Maier.\n17:45 Comment: Play around the round Madrid midfield at times.\n17:48 Comment: It's a little strong from Choupo-Moting and Guarnetti won't catch it.\n17:56 Comment: He's the one at the moment set forward.\n17:57 Comment: Choupo-Moting just needs to just tighten up a little bit with balls that are coming into him.\n18:3 Comment: And by the way, just dropping them off.\n18:5 Comment: Just needs to make sure that...\n18:7 Comment: He's as sharp as some of his teammates.\n18:9 Comment: It's been a good start for the visitors.\n18:28 Comment: Roberto Di Matteo couldn't be forgiven for having one eye on Saturday's Bundesliga match in Berlin, given the aggregate score.\n18:36 Comment: They're giving it a go.\n18:38 Comment: Real Madrid have one eye on the Champions League final in Berlin.\n18:48 Comment: Barnetta.\n18:52 Comment: Berger.\n18:54 Comment: He's a little bit more intent about Schalke at the moment.\n18:56 Comment: Barnetta.\n18:57 Comment: Can that buy for Real?\n18:58 Comment: Just two of these challenges a little half-hearted.\n19:0 Comment: Yeah.\n19:1 Comment: They certainly are.\n19:3 Comment: Just there, Barnetta.\n19:4 Comment: Didn't need to maybe take the extra touch.\n19:5 Comment: Couldn't have crossed it.\n19:6 Comment: That was the challenge, initially, for Neustadter on Isco.\n19:8 Comment: Yeah.\n19:9 Comment: We have to factor in the fact that Madrid are two up, but again, the start hasn't been good.\n19:10 Comment: It's a little flat.\n19:11 Comment: See very little of Ronaldo and Bale running the opposition and creating and making things happen.\n19:12 Comment: Look at the moment.\n19:13 Comment: Kadeer has hardly had a kick.\n19:14 Comment: Kroos and Isco are fighting to try and dominate.\n19:15 Comment: It's a bit difficult, but it is what it is.\n19:16 Comment: It's not worth it.\n19:17 Comment: It's a big challenge.\n19:18 Comment: And it's a big challenge.\n19:19 Comment: We have to make sure that the Real Madrid team can win this, but it's a big challenge.\n19:20 Comment: But we have to make sure that they can win this.\n19:21 Comment: That was the challenge.\n19:23 Comment: Initially, from Neustadter on Isco.\n19:24 Comment: of Ronaldo and Bale running the opposition and creating and making things happen.\n19:30 Comment: At the moment, Khedira's hardly had a kick, Kroos and\n19:34 Comment: Ishko are fighting to try and dominate possession.\n19:38 Comment: When Schalke pick it up and run in these little pockets here, they look dangerous.\n19:41 Comment: Here's Max Meyer again.\n19:45 Comment: Gianchia Barnetta, Untala let it run, it's a chance for Fuchs,\n19:50 Comment: and it's Schalke who take the lead.\n19:54 Comment: Well, nobody read this part of the script.\n19:58 Comment: Christian Fuchs fires in the goal, which now asks a genuine question mark of Real Madrid,\n20:6 Comment: because the aggregate lead has just been halved.\n20:9 Comment: Great goal, thoroughly deserved. Couldn't have timed it more perfect than that, honestly.\n20:15 Comment: To see out that first 10, 15 minutes and then to strike themselves on 20 minutes,\n20:19 Comment: absolutely perfect.\n20:21 Comment: And then, the goalkeeper, who's been waiting for this for a long time,\n20:24 Comment: and he's got a good shot, and he's got a good shot.\n20:25 Comment: Got good numbers in the box again.\n20:27 Comment: Got men over, Madrid labouring back into position, coasting and plodding back.\n20:32 Comment: Christian Fuchs does have a really strong left foot.\n20:35 Comment: He hits that hard, because he has, should perhaps do better,\n20:38 Comment: I think he thinks it's maybe going across him.\n20:40 Comment: By the time he's reacted, it's just hit his hands and it's flown in the back of the net.\n20:43 Comment: But they thoroughly deserved that.\n20:45 Comment: Now they have to really believe and keep their foot to the floor,\n20:48 Comment: because this could be a very big night for them.\n20:54 Comment: It was rather pat-a-cake goalkeeping by Icar Casillas.\n20:58 Comment: He was exposed by the man in front of him, no doubt about that.\n21:1 Comment: He would have needed a good save to keep it out.\n21:6 Comment: But Fuchs has scored a rare goal in the weekend win over Hoffenheim in Germany,\n21:13 Comment: and scored what could be a famous goal in the Bernabeu.\n21:24 Comment: He measurable to put the ball in that corner too.\n21:26 Comment: Which is always good, because he's usually going to give the ball the right way.\n21:30 Comment: It runs right through the net as cent��이 fielder.\n21:34 Comment: Gustav D\n21:54 Comment: hasn't kicked a ball in Agri for four months.\n22:4 Comment: Herbides.\n22:6 Comment: Barnetta.\n22:10 Comment: Neustetter.\n22:16 Comment: Herber was just a little hemmed in.\n22:24 Comment: Barnetta.\n22:33 Comment: Barnetta's got in behind Real Madrid here.\n22:35 Comment: He's cut it back to Huntelaar.\n22:37 Comment: And now Max Maia with a chance.\n22:38 Comment: It's charged down.\n22:40 Comment: Rather anxiously by Sami Khedira.\n22:42 Comment: It's all Schalke at the moment.\n22:46 Comment: Herger.\n22:46 Comment: Maia finding space at will.\n22:49 Comment: Crossed by Barnetta.\n22:51 Comment: Dealt with by Varane.\n22:52 Comment: But again, Real Madrid.\n22:54 Comment: Defending at the stretch.\n23:0 Comment: Pepe trying to get his team moving.\n23:3 Comment: Terrible pass.\n23:4 Comment: Dostoevsky couldn't quite cut it out.\n23:6 Comment: It is.\n23:7 Comment: Throwing to Real Madrid.\n23:11 Comment: That was that little touchback.\n23:12 Comment: Just touched the arm, isn't it?\n23:13 Comment: Yeah.\n23:15 Comment: It's caught the arm of Sami Khedira.\n23:17 Comment: He didn't travel very far.\n23:18 Comment: There was no intent.\n23:24 Comment: Ronaldo finding Bale.\n23:39 Comment: The whistles are because Choupo-Moting is down injured in the Real Madrid half.\n23:45 Comment: Crosses from Quentral.\n23:49 Comment: Dealt with by Fuchs, the goalscorer.\n23:53 Comment: And it's a goal.\n23:54 Comment: There is a problem with the Schalke striker, Eric Maxim Choupo-Moting.\n24:2 Comment: He mentioned the referee this evening.\n24:5 Comment: He's the experienced Slovenian Damius Skomina.\n24:8 Comment: Not for me, Clive.\n24:9 Comment: It's too close.\n24:10 Comment: He's rolled up off his foot.\n24:13 Comment: You've got no idea what's coming off your foot like that.\n24:15 Comment: No, no, no.\n24:19 Comment: This is Choupo-Moting.\n24:20 Comment: Maybe just catches one there on his ankle here.\n24:23 Comment: Throwes through the corner.\n24:24 Comment: Oh, it's a good header.\n24:25 Comment: And a really, really important goal for you-know-who.\n24:28 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo scores.\n24:31 Comment: A little bit of sanity.\n24:33 Comment: Returns to the burnabout.\n24:36 Comment: Carlo Ancelotti's go-to man.\n24:40 Comment: Makes it 40 for the season again.\n24:42 Comment: He's scored over 50 in each of the last four seasons here.\n24:45 Comment: Great lead.\n24:46 Comment: Stunning header, that is.\n24:48 Comment: This is marked seriously close there.\n24:50 Comment: Not close enough from Matip.\n24:52 Comment: But...\n24:53 Comment: Here is Ronaldo on the back post.\n24:55 Comment: For Velem Reuter.\n24:57 Comment: Ronaldo just leaps and hangs above everybody else gloriously to get his team back in it.\n25:3 Comment: Don't look too pleased about it, does he?\n25:6 Comment: But he has now put himself in a position where nobody has scored more goals in the history of European club football than Cristiano Ronaldo.\n25:14 Comment: That's his 77th in UEFA's major competitions.\n25:19 Comment: One more, the little Messi.\n25:21 Comment: .\n25:22 Comment: That's an important one as well, because they haven't started this game at all.\n25:26 Comment: But they're right back in it now, and that may have just settled the nerves,\n25:28 Comment: because you could start to feel the tension on the terraces here amongst the fans,\n25:33 Comment: not happy with what they're seeing every time the ball goes backwards.\n25:36 Comment: They let the players know about it, and they've not found it easy in the opening 25 minutes,\n25:41 Comment: but they'll feel a lot better about themselves now.\n25:44 Comment: The Chalcolid lasted just four minutes,\n25:46 Comment: and Cristiano Ronaldo can score all kinds of goals.\n25:49 Comment: He's reminding us of his car in the air.\n26:5 Comment: I assume his reaction was something to do with their low-key performance so far.\n26:14 Comment: He looked aggravated rather than joyous.\n26:19 Comment: Real Madrid have a two-goal aggregate lead again.\n26:38 Comment: He's played in eight Champions League games this season now,\n26:42 Comment: Ronaldo has scored in seven of them.\n26:44 Comment: Bale is offside.\n26:46 Comment: It's the main stage in club football.\n26:49 Comment: He just seems to rise to the occasion.\n26:53 Comment: He's up close there.\n26:54 Comment: Brilliant header.\n26:56 Comment: Man on the near post, but how about on that back stick?\n27:0 Comment: Some header there.\n27:2 Comment: The message, too, will come again next week against Manchester City.\n27:4 Comment: We are witnessing a unique football rivalry,\n27:7 Comment: two of the most gifted individuals in the history of the game,\n27:10 Comment: on stage at the same time.\n27:12 Comment: Personal jewel within a team game.\n27:16 Comment: Bale.\n27:19 Comment: He didn't quite squeeze the cross beyond Llewellyn-Royton.\n27:25 Comment: Again there, reluctance from Gareth Bale to maybe deliver that first time across the box.\n27:31 Comment: And he slowed it down and set the defender up.\n27:33 Comment: He didn't ever convince you that he was going to get beyond him.\n27:35 Comment: .\n28:19 Comment: teenager\n28:27 Comment: Bale, Khedira\n28:30 Comment: now they're calling for it in the air again\n28:33 Comment: not even he will be able to connect with that one\n28:39 Comment: Olshaka lost Klasian Utala to injury in the first half of the first leg and\n28:45 Comment: they're gonna lose his sprite partner Eric Choupo-Moting this time\n28:52 Comment: and his replacement Nivoise Sané just 19 years of age\n28:59 Comment: is coming on for a European debut\n29:15 Comment: Fuchs jumped with arms raised they didn't catch Armalar\n29:32 Comment: straight arm rather than point of the elbow I

Cristiano Ronaldo.\n33:36 Comment: Bends him up.\n33:39 Comment: Close.\n33:44 Comment: Bale.\n34:3 Comment: Through there, didn't he?\n34:5 Comment: Hit the Stasic.\n34:10 Comment: Kroos fed into Bale again.\n34:12 Comment: Again going for goal.\n34:13 Comment: Just turned Melon-Roy to go down.\n34:14 Comment: Behind him.\n34:15 Comment: That's better.\n34:18 Comment: Decent first touch.\n34:21 Comment: Perhaps someone would be right to hit that.\n34:23 Comment: Just doesn't really catch it.\n34:27 Comment: He's done eight games without a goal, Gareth Bale.\n34:34 Comment: That has really been the story of the first half.\n34:37 Comment: Certainly the first 20 minutes, Schalke carried as much, if not a greater threat than their vaunted opponents.\n34:44 Comment: Just took the lead.\n34:46 Comment: The lead that lasted just four minutes.\n34:56 Comment: Kroos.\n34:56 Comment: Bends him up.\n34:58 Comment: Isco making a run.\n34:59 Comment: And now Cristiano Ronaldo, who is onside.\n35:2 Comment: Completely miscued.\n35:4 Comment: He doesn't run kindly for Bale.\n35:7 Comment: We don't see that very often.\n35:9 Comment: Actually, I think if Gareth Bale had just kept going now, he might have gotten the end of that mishit.\n35:14 Comment: Ronaldo is onside as you say because he scuffs it.\n35:16 Comment: I think everyone's so used to seeing him hit the target,\n35:18 Comment: make the goalkeeper work.\n35:20 Comment: Just don't back it up and follow it in.\n35:38 Comment: Fuchs.\n35:40 Comment: Sané.\n35:44 Comment: Roy Steader.\n35:46 Comment: Now Barnetta.\n35:48 Comment: Perga.\n35:52 Comment: Varane went out to him.\n35:54 Comment: He's having a problem.\n35:56 Comment: Footballing centre-back, Rafael Varane.\n36:1 Comment: Can't find the pass for Bale though.\n36:14 Comment: Sané.\n36:26 Comment: Centred it quite well.\n36:44 Comment: Pogba.\n36:56 Comment: Herve does.\n36:58 Comment: Maia.\n37:0 Comment: Quite had it under control.\n37:2 Comment: It's a poor-for-quant trial though.\n37:10 Comment: Herve does his home.\n37:12 Comment: Herga.\n37:13 Comment: Tony.\n37:15 Comment: Maia to Fuchs.\n37:19 Comment: Roy Steader.\n37:21 Comment: Lifted in towards Huntelaar.\n37:27 Comment: Just a fraction too heavy for him, wasn't it?\n37:29 Comment: He's actually just peeled off into a fair bit of space there, Huntelaar.\n37:38 Comment: So just called in the face by Sané.\n37:41 Comment: He was mad, hadn't he?\n37:43 Comment: lı\n37:52 Comment: tempted.\n38:0 Comment: Sané.\n38:3 Comment: Ooh, the back pass is rather correlous.\n38:5 Comment: And Huntelaar got to it.\n38:7 Comment: Just couldn't quite guard it on target.\n38:9 Comment: They really blame Kasias for that.\n38:11 Comment: He's played into trouble by the back pass.\n38:13 Comment: Rafa Varane is a very relieved man.\n38:17 Comment: Isco.\n38:27 Comment: Fabio Quantrall, Isco.\n38:30 Comment: He's at the edge of the penalty area, just not coming off.\n38:34 Comment: Oh.\n38:42 Comment: Kroos, lifted in towards Ronaldo, but over-hit.\n38:58 Comment: There's a chance for Buntola!\n39:0 Comment: Oh, it's beautifully struck.\n39:2 Comment: Oh, what a save by Rafa.\n39:4 Comment: Rattle the angle.\n39:6 Comment: This is Sané.\n39:8 Comment: Good move there, Fuchs, the goalscorer here, was involved.\n39:11 Comment: And Buntola almost scoring against one of his former clubs.\n39:15 Comment: Great strike, wasn't it? Really good play, good football.\n39:18 Comment: Good movement from Buntola, very unlucky.\n39:23 Comment: He's just composed himself again, actually, since.\n39:28 Comment: Buntola again, he's set up Max Maier!\n39:30 Comment: Buntola!\n39:32 Comment: Yep.\n39:33 Comment: And Xhaka reaches it.\n39:34 Comment: He'll take the lead!\n39:38 Comment: Klaas Jan Buntola scores for the first time in 2015.\n39:43 Comment: A goal that will mean so much to him.\n39:45 Comment: He had six unhappy months here as a Real Madrid player.\n39:48 Comment: He's happy at the moment.\n39:50 Comment: He was so unlucky with his initial strike, wasn't he?\n39:52 Comment: That one from Maier is palmed again from Casillas.\n39:55 Comment: I don't think the goalkeeping is particularly strong.\n39:58 Comment: He's just dropped it straight back into the path of the centre-forward,\n40:1 Comment: who just smashes it in the back of the net.\n40:3 Comment: The top-class keeper, you'd expect more from Casillas there.\n40:6 Comment: Given the benefit of the doubt with the first one that was hit hard at him,\n40:9 Comment: but not that one.\n40:10 Comment: It's poor goalkeeping.\n40:14 Comment: Buntola came here in 2009 at the start of the year\n40:18 Comment: because Ruben Nistroy was out injured at the time.\n40:20 Comment: There was a change of president soon after his arrival,\n40:23 Comment: a change of coach just before.\n40:25 Comment: He actually scored eight goals in six games for Juan de Ramos\n40:28 Comment: when he was given his chance in the February of that year,\n40:31 Comment: but he didn't score again for Real Madrid.\n40:34 Comment: In that summer, Manuel Pellegrini came\n40:37 Comment: and Florentino Perez splashed out on Cristiano Ronaldo,\n40:41 Comment: Karim Benzema, and Buntola was gone to the land.\n40:46 Comment: But he's back.\n40:48 Comment: Once they get Max Maier, number seven, Gleipziger,\n40:52 Comment: once they get him in the hole and just playing a little bit in and around Kroos,\n40:55 Comment: in behind Khedira, he's clever.\n40:58 Comment: He gets in a little bit of good areas.\n41:1 Comment: He starts linking and knitting things together.\n41:3 Comment: They had that little spell after Ronaldo's header.\n41:6 Comment: They just lost their impetus, their momentum.\n41:9 Comment: As I mentioned, they've composed themselves, got it back.\n41:12 Comment: In a great position again here.\n41:14 Comment: It's just whether they really believe they can go on and get through this time\n41:18 Comment: because at the moment, from what I'm seeing, they've nothing to fear here.\n41:23 Comment: And here they come again with Fuchs.\n41:28 Comment: It's blocked by Alvaloa.\n41:31 Comment: And he knows that they're really only a goal away from taking the lead in this tie.\n41:37 Comment: As if they could score a third here.\n41:41 Comment: The away goal would effectively give them the advantage of the three away goals.\n41:47 Comment: Got to score the third one here.\n41:51 Comment: And they have a corner.\n42:1 Comment: Nothing going on in there.\n42:5 Comment: Pepe getting involved with Hovedes.\n42:9 Comment: Not like Pepe.\n42:15 Comment: Watching you is the referee's response to that.\n42:18 Comment: His disciplinary record's been excellent this season.\n42:21 Comment: So far.\n42:22 Comment: Corner by Barnetta.\n42:24 Comment: Towards Salah.\n42:26 Comment: Two-way by Isco, but anxiously.\n42:29 Comment: And it's got back onside.\n42:35 Comment: Spooked away by Alvaloa.\n42:44 Comment: Chewing a little more vigorously than he was at kick-off.\n42:47 Comment: Carlo Ancelotti.\n42:50 Comment: This was the back pass from Ferrandi.\n42:52 Comment: He just hits back a little bit blind.\n42:54 Comment: That was again before the...\n42:55 Comment: the Humphalar goal.\n42:57 Comment: Just about got away with that.\n42:59 Comment: And he hit the woodwork in between that.\n43:1 Comment: And the goal he did score.\n43:4 Comment: Cooks with another of his long throws.\n43:8 Comment: Headed by Pepe.\n43:10 Comment: Patrol from Isco.\n43:12 Comment: Escape from Isco.\n43:13 Comment: Benzema to his left.\n43:14 Comment: Ronaldo to his right.\n43:16 Comment: Carrying Benzema.\n43:19 Comment: He's going to go in alone.\n43:21 Comment: And it's probably the wrong decision.\n43:27 Comment: Gareth Bale.\n43:29 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo.\n43:35 Comment: Now Sami Khedira.\n43:38 Comment: He's gone for goal himself.\n43:39 Comment: I think Bellaroyter just got a hand on that.\n43:41 Comment: Did.\n43:42 Comment: And Herbert is, I think, was there just to...\n43:43 Comment: head it back up in the air.\n43:45 Comment: To go behind it.\n43:46 Comment: To have a chance to hook it away.\n43:51 Comment: Cross from Khedira.\n43:53 Comment: The goalkeeper gets a hand on it.\n43:55 Comment: Between them, they manage to deal with it.\n43:59 Comment: Real Madrid have won their last 11 home games in the Champions League.\n44:7 Comment: By their very high standards tonight, they looked ordinary.\n44:10 Comment: It was a...\n44:12 Comment: a goal out of nothing that got them back into this tie.\n44:14 Comment: They've got plenty to think about now.\n44:21 Comment: Alba lower to Bale.\n44:26 Comment: Stasic is there.\n44:29 Comment: He's trying to cross it to that Forest post a tiny bit.\n44:36 Comment: Who is that?\n44:37 Comment: Firstly, they look like�\n44:41 Comment: 能够打 Данил Д regulatoryрат\n44:43 Comment: з Games bowler\n44:50 Comment: and they shy away the rest of

Comment: He's just lacking confidence, Clive.\n2:53 Comment: He's having that little spell where every decision you make is the wrong one.\n2:56 Comment: You knock a ball in early, you should have had an extra touch,\n2:59 Comment: and vice versa, it's just not happening for him.\n3:1 Comment: He's got to keep going and get through it.\n3:5 Comment: Isco has found Ronaldo at the same time as Varsky.\n3:8 Comment: And here's Isco.\n3:10 Comment: He lost his footing as he went for goal.\n3:14 Comment: It's a deflection, so a quarter kick.\n3:26 Comment: It's a free kick for his troubles, too.\n3:46 Comment: Confident in coming and grabbing it, isn't he, the goalkeeper?\n3:48 Comment: He's not standing there waiting for people to deal with it.\n3:51 Comment: It's always good to see that.\n3:53 Comment: Just comes out of his hands at the last moment there.\n3:56 Comment: He's a little bit fortunate, maybe, to get a free kick there.\n3:59 Comment: He's not that much contact.\n4:2 Comment: Yeah, I think it was his collision with the planet\n4:5 Comment: rather than with Benzema, which shook it out of his hands.\n4:8 Comment: That's the Japanese World Cup right back at Sudoshida.\n4:13 Comment: Shaka.\n4:19 Comment: And without half a dozen first-team players, one reason or another,\n4:24 Comment: so not too much choice for Roberto.\n4:26 Comment: No Di Matteo on the bench, but they have.\n4:28 Comment: And on the corner here.\n4:49 Comment: It's easy enough for Shaka to find Fuchs there.\n4:54 Comment: Barnett is onside.\n4:55 Comment: It's a way by Renaud.\n4:56 Comment: Now can Isco and Benzema conjure a counter-attack?\n4:59 Comment: There's your answer.\n5:1 Comment: Clumsy from Benzema.\n5:3 Comment: Poor ball.\n5:5 Comment: Timing of the pass as well.\n5:7 Comment: Unless the series goes, they'll be able to pinch it back.\n5:9 Comment: It's done as well as anybody for Real Madrid.\n5:13 Comment: Benzema's played it behind Bale.\n5:15 Comment: They're not connecting, those three.\n5:17 Comment: It's a man.\n5:25 Comment: It's amazing to think where they were through September, October and November.\n5:29 Comment: 22 consecutive wins.\n5:32 Comment: Incredible run they were having at that point.\n5:35 Comment: Everything was flowing so naturally, so freely.\n5:38 Comment: It's amazing how quick it turns and when it disappears.\n5:40 Comment: When that confidence goes.\n5:42 Comment: That rhythm that you've got just seems to disappear.\n5:45 Comment: It's very, very tough to get it back.\n5:47 Comment: It's that winter break that interrupted them.\n5:49 Comment: It's overrated, winter break.\n6:25 Comment: A clear push by Les Tassets, Sean Pail.\n6:33 Comment: Schalke are interested in signing him permanently.\n6:47 Comment: Quintra.\n6:49 Comment: Pins him up.\n6:53 Comment: There's Fabio Quintra.\n6:55 Comment: It's run for Benzema, a run kindly.\n6:57 Comment: And Karim Benzema, surely!\n7:0 Comment: Real Madrid take the lead for the first time on the night.\n7:5 Comment: Karim Benzema has got the goal.\n7:8 Comment: 20 for the season, for the fifth season in a row for him.\n7:13 Comment: And maybe that will unlock the gates.\n7:20 Comment: Real Madrid have a clear three-goal aggregate lead.\n7:23 Comment: We start here, Benzema.\n7:25 Comment: Benzema is just there, close to being offside.\n7:27 Comment: Ferry just gets the benefit of the doubt.\n7:29 Comment: One or two little ricochets.\n7:30 Comment: Yep, full kindly for him.\n7:31 Comment: But then he's got the composure to have that extra touch there.\n7:35 Comment: And again there.\n7:37 Comment: To just bring the goalkeeper under the ball.\n7:41 Comment: Eventually just leaves himself with an empty net just to pop it in.\n7:45 Comment: A little bit of good fortune, but good persistence from Benzema.\n7:48 Comment: He's not had the greatest night.\n7:49 Comment: Not been easy for him up there.\n7:51 Comment: Gets himself a goal.\n7:52 Comment: And that's half a dozen.\n7:55 Comment: There is 20 goals for the season in this competition.\n7:59 Comment: Karim Benzema has a fantastic goal-scoring record in the Champions League.\n8:3 Comment: 42 in 61 games.\n8:7 Comment: And he's actually knocking on the door of the top 10 of the all-time Champions League goal scorers now.\n8:18 Comment: Most ever, Arne Slid in there.\n8:19 Comment: Wasn't a lot of control about the challenge.\n8:21 Comment: Again, it's because he's got his foot up a bit.\n8:22 Comment: I think Clive is...\n8:25 Comment: The reason why the referee maybe wants to have a little word.\n8:36 Comment: He's getting in there first in the challenge, wasn't he?\n8:38 Comment: He's just getting momentum.\n8:41 Comment: All you can do about that when you commit to a challenge.\n8:45 Comment: Schalke need three goals now, so...\n8:49 Comment: A little bit of the realism has returned to the tie.\n8:53 Comment: And Real Madrid...\n8:54 Comment: Relax.\n8:57 Comment: Start to enjoy the night.\n9:1 Comment: Like Quetzal was holding there, that might just be...\n9:10 Comment: In the British playable this season...\n9:14 Comment: There's no start of the season.\n9:16 Comment: Thinking that…\n9:19 Comment: After this match, we have got to make sure the Blues answer.\n9:21 Comment: And of course, what they do is the right thing.\n9:23 Comment: Who is René again?\n9:23 Comment: He's already pointy. He would be a surfer. He was the best bringing back.\n9:23 Comment: He's already a surfer. He's already a surfer. I'm telling you.\n9:24 Comment: By Frank Faijn. He's a die shot guy. He answers every quarter. He's a die shot guy. He's a die Bolsonaro. He's a die shot guy.\n9:24 Comment: Luka Modric has completed his warm-up and is ready to return.\n9:42 Comment: Sané.\n9:49 Comment: Slesic to Matic.\n9:51 Comment: The other game in the last 16 this evening.\n9:55 Comment: Porto now have a clear lead.\n9:56 Comment: 2-0 they lead on the night against Basel.\n10:0 Comment: And then they drag out 3-1 on aggregate.\n10:2 Comment: We're going to see highlights of that game on ITV at 10.40 this evening.\n10:7 Comment: Along with the reaction from here.\n10:10 Comment: It's been a pretty extraordinary night so far in the Bernabeu.\n10:13 Comment: 10.40 ITV.\n10:19 Comment: Barnetta.\n10:21 Comment: Got away from Quintral.\n10:23 Comment: Huntelaar has always just lacked that extra yard of pace.\n10:27 Comment: I mean Pepe's quick.\n10:28 Comment: He's good like that.\n10:30 Comment: Barnetta did really well with the pass to Huntelaar.\n10:32 Comment: It was a poor one.\n10:33 Comment: It always favoured the centre-half.\n10:38 Comment: It's been a crazy evening.\n10:39 Comment: Just concentrate on your delivery here.\n10:42 Comment: Put it into a good area.\n10:44 Comment: Put a pass up for scoring again.\n10:51 Comment: Fuchs with the corner.\n10:53 Comment: Casillas rather poor, did he?\n10:55 Comment: This is Matip.\n11:8 Comment: It's a terrific ball from Neustadter.\n11:10 Comment: Fuchs has found Sané.\n11:12

Bernabeu.\n11:25 Comment: And the 19-year-old has just fired Roberto Di Matteo's team\n11:29 Comment: back on terms.\n11:30 Comment: They need two more.\n11:31 Comment: Really good football though, the way they kept the ball.\n11:33 Comment: It went out to Christian Fuchs who ended up just dropping it into Sané.\n11:37 Comment: Great finish.\n11:38 Comment: Really, really good finish.\n11:39 Comment: That's a clever little ball.\n11:40 Comment: And here, it takes a bit of time.\n11:42 Comment: He knows exactly what he wants to do.\n11:43 Comment: Goalkeeper again.\n11:44 Comment: Any danger of him getting near something this evening?\n11:46 Comment: I'm not sure.\n11:48 Comment: That's a good goal.\n11:49 Comment: Great goal.\n11:51 Comment: Can we say it again?\n11:52 Comment:

Comment: Well they've managed to peg the initial lead back but...\n33:36 Comment: It's not been a good performance from them.\n33:38 Comment: That pay only as far as Fuchs.\n33:40 Comment: I see a field there.\n33:44 Comment: Capably enough.\n33:46 Comment: They're going to have to find some gears between now and when is it?\n33:52 Comment: Glasgow, 12 days?\n33:53 Comment: Saturday week.\n33:54 Comment: Yeah.\n33:55 Comment: They have to find an edge to their game.\n33:57 Comment: It's all been a little bit...\n33:57 Comment: It's been a little bit...\n33:59 Comment: One-paced.\n34:0 Comment: Roy mentioned at half-time about the fact that because they had that lead yet.\n34:4 Comment: I think that's true.\n34:5 Comment: I think because they already came here tonight with two goals in their back pocket.\n34:9 Comment: It does perhaps take the sting out of the game initially but...\n34:14 Comment: I just think they were slow in that first 20 minutes.\n34:16 Comment: Predictable.\n34:17 Comment: And wide open as well.\n34:18 Comment: And easily got at.\n34:25 Comment: Ronaldo inviting Alvaloa to come forward.\n34:29 Comment: A little frustrated that the cross didn't come in earlier.\n34:32 Comment: It's a good ball from Kroos.\n34:36 Comment: Not good control from Isco.\n34:38 Comment: .\n35:27 Comment: Gretzky.\n35:39 Comment: It's an interesting ball, too, towards Walter-Large.\n35:42 Comment: Slightly overhead.\n35:46 Comment: Couldn't quite keep it in, either.\n35:50 Comment: Lucky just a fraction too big for him, wasn't it, that?\n35:53 Comment: That ball from Gretzky was the right idea.\n35:57 Comment: It's the tail of the tape.\n36:9 Comment: Nothing much to choose between the two teams.\n36:19 Comment: Gretzky did just catch Modric.\n36:25 Comment: Actually made it into the preliminary round.\n36:28 Comment: Preliminary.\n36:29 Comment: He said that.\n36:30 Comment: World Cup squad, Gretzky.\n36:34 Comment: He turned 20

Comment: thinking he might want to hit the byline and cross it.\n37:56 Comment: Instead, he dips back onto his right foot.\n37:59 Comment: He's got the ability to do that.\n38:0 Comment: That's exactly what he's trying to do.\n38:3 Comment: Goalkeeper's always struggling, but...\n38:6 Comment: just wide.\n38:8 Comment: Porto will be in the quarter-final draw in ten days' time.\n38:12 Comment: They now lead by four goals to nil,\n38:14 Comment: and by five goals to one on aggregate against Basel.\n38:18 Comment: Highlights of that, and indeed this game on ITV at 10.40 this

Dynamo Kyiv.\n38:33 Comment: Good signal at 7.45 on ITV.\n38:36 Comment: And if you want to see the Wolfsburg-Inter Milan game at the same stage,\n38:39 Comment: that's on ITV4 a little earlier.\n38:51 Comment: Modric made a challenge, but it might come for Untala.\n38:54 Comment: Oh! It's in!\n38:56 Comment: He's got another.\n38:58 Comment: And Xhaka have got another lead.\n39:1 Comment: And they're one away...\n39:4 Comment: from winning this tie, would you believe?\n39:7 Comment: Klaas-Jan Untala smashes it in off the crossbar.\n39:12 Comment: An inadvertent pass from Luka Modric.\n39:14 Comment: Now...\n39:16 Comment: Great finish.\n39:18 Comment: If he takes that a yard further, Pepe will catch him,\n39:20 Comment: cos he's so quick across the ground.\n39:22 Comment: Yeah, there's a bit of good fortune here.\n39:24 Comment: The pass from Sané, look, it just...\n39:25 Comment: Luka Modric just gets a toe on it, puts Untala in.\n39:28 Comment: Hey, but what a strike. Brilliant effort.\n39:31 Comment: We criticise Casillas for some of the others, not that one.\n39:33 Comment: It's not getting anywhere near that.\n39:36 Comment: Real Madrid's aggregate lead is 5-4.\n39:40 Comment: But if Xhaka were to find one more unanswered goal,\n39:44 Comment: they would knock Real Madrid out of this competition on away goals.\n39:48 Comment: Real Madrid unbeaten in the Champions League at the Bernabeu since 2011.\n39:55 Comment: But they've got to get the ball out of the way.\n39:57 Comment: Klaas-Jan Untala, one of the old boys,\n40:0 Comment: has scored two of the four Xhaka goals.\n40:6 Comment: Just now need to get it wide and get it in that box.\n40:13 Comment: Take a chance.\n40:14 Comment: Gamble with your midfield runs.\n40:16 Comment: Just get in there, just trust someone to put it in the box\n40:18 Comment: with a little bit of pace on it.\n40:20 Comment: Something just might drop for you on the edges anywhere.\n40:25 Comment: I think Xhaka have just acquired some new fans in Barcelona and Munich\n40:29 Comment: and West London and one or two other places\n40:32 Comment: because it would be a sensational result.\n40:35 Comment: Put it in the box.\n40:37 Comment: Christian Fuchs there, he's looking for a little clever ball to the byline.\n40:40 Comment: Put it in there.\n40:43 Comment: This is the goal again, he hits it ever so well.\n40:46 Comment: Great finish.\n40:53 Comment: He's the oldest player in this team now.\n40:54 Comment: So much experience, at least 70 counts for Holland.\n40:57 Comment: His career stalled here and in Milan,\n41:0 Comment: but he's found himself in Germany, found lots and lots of goals.\n41:9 Comment: Goretzka, good feet.\n41:12 Comment: Sané.\n41:14 Comment: Blocked by Modric.\n41:18 Comment: Mervedes.\n41:21 Comment: And it's in.\n41:22 Comment: That's a good one.\n41:24 Comment: That's clever from Maia.\n41:26 Comment: Here's Sané, away from Modric.\n41:28 Comment: Sané shot!\n41:29 Comment: And Casillas had to save it.\n41:31 Comment: Poured away for a throw in.\n41:34 Comment: Good play.\n41:36 Comment: Good effort there from Sané that time.\n41:38 Comment: Casillas has enough about him to deal with it.\n41:41 Comment: Scoops it away from his goal.\n41:44 Comment: No team has ever lost a Champions League home leg by two clear goals\n41:48 Comment: and survived in the second leg.\n41:52 Comment: Punch by Casillas.\n41:53 Comment: Volley from Maia.\n42:4 Comment: Good kick there.\n42:7 Comment: This was the shot from Sané again.\n42:12 Comment: This is not that time.\n42:17 Comment: Also making sure he gets it well away from the goal into any onrushing Puchac.\n42:23 Comment: I've got a few pals who like a flutter on the correct score.\n42:42 Comment: Anybody out there have Real Madrid 3, Schalke 4 tonight?\n42:47 Comment: It's not over yet.\n42:53 Comment: Neymar into the path of Sané.\n42:57 Comment: Casillas is coming eventually.\n43:2 Comment: Turns there, Sané again trying to come back onto his left foot.\n43:5 Comment: He's his strongest.\n43:6 Comment: Just sometimes you've got to go with the other foot, take a chance.\n43:10 Comment: He let that run across his body.\n43:12 Comment: Would have had a shot at Casillas.\n43:16 Comment: Roberto Di Matteo's run to the final with Chelsea three years ago\n43:20 Comment: was all about brinksmanship.\n43:23 Comment: He'd likely win some unlikely positions.\n43:26 Comment: This would cap the lot.\n43:29 Comment: He knows it.\n43:33 Comment: These are a critical few minutes for Real Madrid's season.\n43:47 Comment: Goal kept.\n43:49 Comment: It's the worst person you want to let have the ball there in that moment.\n43:52 Comment: The goalkeeper.\n43:53 Comment: He can transfer it.\n43:54 Comment: Pretty quickly he's decided to put it down and play.\n43:57 Comment: He might regret that.\n43:59 Comment: Full marks to them all for making the trip from Germany\n44:2 Comment: in what seemed like a pretty hopeless mission.\n44:5 Comment: It's not hopeless at the moment.\n44:7 Comment: Untelar.\n44:8 Comment: Sané.\n44:11 Comment: He's kept the ball and found Maier.\n44:14 Comment: It's just cut out by Pepe.\n44:16 Comment: It was bound for Goretzka.\n44:18 Comment: Maier again.\n44:20 Comment: Header away by Pepe once more.\n44:23 Comment: Kept alive by Fuchs.\n44:25 Comment: Maier's onside.\n44:27 Comment: Last of the 90 minutes.\n44:33 Comment: Nastasic.\n44:34 Comment: In towards Untelar.\n44:36 Comment: This is Hervédez!\n44:38 Comment: And he forced the save.\n44:41 Comment: And Casillas, who's had some bad moments tonight,\n44:43 Comment: has had a couple of very good ones\n44:44 Comment: when Real Madrid have really needed him.\n44:47 Comment: Great leap from Untelar as well.\n44:49 Comment: Knocking it back to Hervédez.\n44:51 Comment: He's done well getting in there.\n44:53 Comment: That's not his speciality, his forte, that.\n44:55 Comment: He's sort of leaning away from it.\n44:56 Comment: He's got to hit it because of the pressure he's under from Nacho.\n44:59 Comment: But good leap from Untelar.\n45:2 Comment:

    "summary": "The clash between Real Madrid and Schalke at the Santiago Bernabeu was a seven-goal thriller that will be remembered for its intensity and unexpected twists. A night that began with anticipation of routine home win for Real Madrid turned into a dramatic contest teetering on a knife-edge until the final whistle.\n\nThe match kicked off with both teams initially feeling each other out. Confidence oozed from Real Madrid as they came into this game with an aggregate lead from the first leg. Their form at home had been impeccable up to this point, scoring in every home game yet this season. Schalke, meanwhile, required at least a three-goal victory to overturn the deficit and achieve what seemed to be a near-impossible task.\n\nIn the opening few minutes, Schalke pressured the Real Madrid defense, with Choupo-Moting and Huntelaar trying to ask questions of the home side’s backline. Displays of interplay and some well-constructed moves hinted that Schalke were not here just to fulfil a fixture. Neustetter, typically solid for Schalke, was immediately under pressure from Kroos, allowing Gareth Bale an early chance to stretch his legs, though support from Isco was mistimed.\n\nThe narrative soon emerged: Real Madrid's front three of Bale, Ronaldo, and Benzema, heavily favoured to dominate, were crucial in deciding the match's outcome. However, the team's play in the opening exchanges lacked the fluidity expected of them. Kroos, one among Madrid's key players, seemed industrious but struggled to impose his usual high standard of control over the game's tempo.\n\nSchalke demonstrated some fighting spirit early on. Huerger, embarking on a bold run down the wing, failed to produce an effective cross. The promising situations continued to falter just before fruition, as Real's defensive giants Pepe and Varane managed intermittent showcases of resilience.\n\nThen, the first taste of the extraordinary nature of this match emerged. Christian Fuchs found the back of the net with a smashing left-foot strike that capitulated past Casillas. The Schalke fans erupted, and their team believed as the aggregate scoreline tightened.\n\nHowever, Real Madrid's attacking prowess reared its inevitable head. Cristiano Ronaldo, showcasing his exceptional aerial ability, delivered an exquisite header to restore parity. This goal ensured that Ronaldo continued his sequence of having scored in multiple Champions League fixtures and cemented his position as one of the leading scorers in European club football. For a brief moment, order was restored as the home side recalibrated their approach.\n\nNonetheless, Schalke were unyielding. The visitors struck again through Huntelaar, whose persistence paid off. Schalke's movement in tight spaces, initiated by Max Maia, left Real Madrid's defense exposed. His initial shot was parried by Casillas, only for Huntelaar to slot the rebound. The Germans were back in the game, questioning Real Madrid's defensive frailties.\n\nIn response, Real Madrid’s Karim Benzema churned out an imperative reply. In the orchestrated move, sprinkled with fortune, Benzema displayed his composure close to goal, doubling Madrid’s lead on aggregate. Yet, Schalke's indomitable spirit echoed a haunting realization through the Santiago Bernabeu - especially when the teenage substitute Leroy Sané netted the visitors’ third with a brilliantly taken shot, capitalizing on a well-crafted build-up play involving Neustadter and Fuchs. This made it 3-3 on the night.\n\nThe enthralling pendulum swung back and forth almost hypnotically. Cristiano Ronaldo, once more using his aerial prowess, scored another vital header. This reestablished Madrid's leadership and demonstrated Ronaldo's adroit knack for decisive goals. The magnificent delivery from Quentral and Ronaldo's extraordinary leap conjured an effort that again showcased the game's all-consuming drama.\n\nAs the second half commenced, Schalke remained undeterred. Real Madrid circulated the ball with intent, integrating playmaker Luka Modric who was returning after a four-month injury layoff. His presence began knitting together Real's midfield, providing a semblance of rhythm.\n\nHowever, a momentarily lapsed concentration saw Schalke equalize again when Klaas-Jan Huntelaar ferociously hammered a strike that rattled past Casillas, hitting the underside of the bar. This goal was born from a quick turnover, featuring young Sané's creative interchange.\n\nClose to the denouement, the tension was electric. Schalke, despite requiring only one more goal to advance on away goals, faced Real Madrid's seasoned resilience in the final minutes. The nervous energy of the Bernabeu crowd was palpable. Each intervention by Pepe, Varane, or Alvaro Arbeloa was met with immense relief or anxiety.\n\nWith time ticking away, the situation reached its climactic apex when Schalke swarmed the Madrid goal, and Casillas' relatively beleaguered hands managed a save that arguably positioned him momentarily as Real’s beacon amid chaos. His saves from Huntelaar and another from a stretching Hervédez effort provided the last line of defiance.\n\nThe final whistle saw Real Madrid narrowly advance to the Champions League quarterfinals with a 5-4 aggregate, though losing 3-4 on the night. The holders' journey forward was fraught with a realization of their vulnerabilities – particularly an unstable defense – despite the new-age Lev Yashin contributions of Casillas, the lethal incursions by Ronaldo, and glimpses into the importance of mid-season reinforcements like Modric.\n\nThe players soaked up the adulation and relief of their fans. It was a night that Schalke, although gallant in their effort, could not secure a miraculous escape from elimination. For Real Madrid, it wasn't the performance that assured loyal supporters ahead of their \"El Clasico\" date with Barcelona but it was unquestionably an awakening to the demanding grind that lay ahead if silverware was to be assured. The narrative of this unforgettable night, etched indelibly in the annals of European football, reiterated the thin margins that persist between triumph and despair."
