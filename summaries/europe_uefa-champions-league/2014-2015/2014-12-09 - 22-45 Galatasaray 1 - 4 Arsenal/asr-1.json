defender.\n6:52 Comment: Justice is about to pull the trigger.\n6:55 Comment: A bit of pressure on him.\n7:0 Comment: The initial blast was from the full-back Tellez.\n7:4 Comment: And then the wide effort was from the centre-half, Hakan Valter.\n7:8 Comment: He did score a goal.\n7:10 Comment: Consolation in the defeat of Dortmund.\n7:13 Comment: Never really looked like scoring now for one reason or another.\n7:22 Comment: And Doчтоvic has got bah in the papers.\n7:26 Comment: But the Sanrio oh.\n7:27 Comment: Well played.\n7:29 Comment: Showtimes on City had they scored a great goal

him so far.\n8:41 Comment: And as we've got with the Arsenal front three,\n8:43 Comment: which it is really the goalscorer Podolski on the left.\n8:46 Comment: Sunogo is the one through the middle.\n8:47 Comment: Joel Campbell out on the right.\n8:52 Comment: To get back is Sneijder.\n8:54 Comment: Touches it to Tellez.\n9:2 Comment: The combative Felipe Melo.\n9:5 Comment: In the World Cup in South Africa for Brazil.\n9:10 Comment: Sneijder very nearly unlocked the door there, didn't he?\n9:13 Comment: I'll tell you what, better touch there when he's in there.\n9:18 Comment: Really good ball over the top to Bullitt.\n9:22 Comment: And that's the early effort from Sneijder.\n9:24 Comment: It's the early effort from Sneijder.\n9:38 Comment: Pretty wretched campaign on many levels for Galatasaray.\n9:44 Comment: The only point they've earned so far came here on the opening game against Anderlecht.\n9:48 Comment: It was Burak Yilmaz who scored an equalizer deep into Storch.\n9:52 Comment: A great stoppage time at the end of the match.\n9:57 Comment: Since then it's been four successive defeats.\n10:2 Comment: Many of them putting thumping ones, including that one

Arsenal lead 2-0 in Istanbul yeah it's\n10:27 Comment: a terrific run from Oxlade-Chamberlain when he he picks it up he draws two defenders to the ball\n10:33 Comment: this is the tackle from Badowski Galatasaray looking for a free kick referee I think made\n10:40 Comment: the right decision Ramsey takes the extra touch on his left side back across the keeper\n10:46 Comment: and Arsenal just about

tackle I'm not happy about.\n14:52 Comment: Flamini does come in right there.\n15:8 Comment: The other card for Maggio Flamini.\n15:10 Comment: No complaints about that.\n15:12 Comment: It was a 2-0 defeat for Arsenal this time last year,\n15:18 Comment: and they lost the player who started as the holding midfielder,\n15:21 Comment: a true ill-disciplined Mikel Arteta.\n15:23 Comment: Sent off.\n15:25 Comment: It's a lot tighter group situation for them this time, 12 months ago.\n15:30 Comment: They got the 12 points they went into the game with,\n15:33 Comment: and they conceded one more to Napoli, went down to 10 men.\n15:36 Comment: And they'd have been out.\n15:38 Comment: Dortmund and Rafa Benitez's side would have gone through.\n15:42 Comment: And that was certainly the case of the player running into the back of the Arsenal defender.\n15:48 Comment: Yeah, that's good defending by Flamini.\n15:54 Comment: Podolski.\n15:55 Comment: Moultoulou trying to get back at him.\n15:58 Comment: And make sure luck doing so.\n16:1 Comment: It's an undoubted edge to proceedings, though, isn't it?\n16:5 Comment: Shoot back.\n16:6 Comment: Here's Sneijder.\n16:12 Comment: And Moultoulou.\n16:15 Comment: I'll show you what I've got.\n16:17 Comment: I'll show you what he's trying to do, whether he's trying to score\n16:19 Comment: or whether he's trying to knock across into the back post.\n16:23 Comment: This is the Flamini block here.\n16:26 Comment: Good defending, if you ask me.\n16:34 Comment: Missed the incident with Ramsey on the far side.\n16:42 Comment: And he's got a really strong start.\n17:5 Comment: Picks the pass to Debussy, but the Frenchman was offside.\n17:7 Comment: Oh, it's a pity.\n17:9 Comment: Completely unmarked here, Debussy coming off the wide area.\n17:12 Comment: Just needed a fraction out there.\n17:20 Comment: Three long months without the services of Mathieu Debussy.\n17:23 Comment: It's a timely return for him.\n17:28 Comment: Some positive news on the injury front.\n17:37 Comment: Harry Chandler.\n17:42 Comment: I think he's better in.\n17:46 Comment: That's down to Wesley Sneijder.\n17:50 Comment: Sneijder's cross.\n17:51 Comment: Chambers patrolling the near post.\n17:53 Comment: And it's Hasaray getting the corner.\n17:55 Comment: Yeah.\n17:55 Comment: I mean, I don't think Debussy has to head the ball at the back post.\n17:58 Comment: If he gets a shout to leave it, it's going to play there.\n18:2 Comment: Operating the multi-ball system here, and Arsenal could have been caught napping from the short corner.\n18:6 Comment: As it is, it's a long-range effort from Mello.\n18:9 Comment: Farswijk.\n18:10 Comment: Yeah.\n18:10 Comment: Maybe the best ever.\n18:11 Comment: They've come up with so far.\n18:11 Comment: far been pretty poor so far\n18:21 Comment: never really a problem there for shesney is it\n18:29 Comment: was the one blot on the landscape in terms of the previous meeting which\n18:33 Comment: happened on the second match day of the group at the emirates\n18:37 Comment: stadium was vojtech shesney's rushing blood to the head he gave away\n18:40 Comment: a penalty missing the next game suspended because\n18:45 Comment: of the resulting red\n18:54 Comment: ramsey\n18:59 Comment: tarik chandell ensured it couldn't find his target podolsky\n19:4 Comment: muttalut\n19:6 Comment: snake chamberlain\n19:10 Comment: back here for podolsky this time he rifles it against the crossbar\n19:16 Comment: yeah it's a really good effort from podolsky he's got a problem here trying\n19:20 Comment: to stay on side you see him checking his run here as he\n19:24 Comment: gets the reverse from from chamberlain and by that time he's gonna he's gonna\n19:28 Comment: drag it onto stronger food decent effort though\n19:33 Comment: well it's constantly said isn't it that lucas podolsky\n19:36 Comment: is the best finisher at the club and it's one of the great sights when\n19:39 Comment: watching arsenal is him getting one on his left foot like that\n19:43 Comment: the power he generates\n19:47 Comment: so\n20:9 Comment: \n20:39 Comment: a

Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n21:12 Comment: Bruma's on the move.\n21:14 Comment: This is Baruch Yilmaz.\n21:16 Comment: And he got the winner against Manchester United.\n21:19 Comment: That was the penalty against Arsenal.\n21:25 Comment: Tarek Shamdar.\n21:28 Comment: That is off Baruch Yilmaz.\n21:30 Comment: Through to Wesley Sneijder.\n21:32 Comment: That out of source by Campbell.\n21:36 Comment: First chance for Joel Campbell to stretch his legs.\n21:39 Comment: Very good looking pass to Yaya Sanogo.\n21:43 Comment: Looks to finish it.\n21:44 Comment: Might well have come off the hands of the defender, Semmy.\n21:47 Comment: Yeah, he didn't do much wrong, Sanogo, did he?\n21:50 Comment: Really good run from Campbell.\n21:52 Comment: Released the ball at the right time.\n21:55 Comment: Sanogo did well to open the target up for himself.\n22:7 Comment: Good, Yilmaz.\n22:9 Comment: Sure luck.\n22:26 Comment: If you compare the two sides to the one that met at the Emirates back in September,\n22:34 Comment: it's pretty different.\n22:36 Comment: Both sides changing six of the starting eleven for this one.\n22:39 Comment: For one.\n22:39 Comment: reason or another Aaron Ramsey\n22:44 Comment: Podolsky before today this season in the League Cup defeated home to South\n22:52 Comment: Hampton terrific performance from Arsenal so far against the side you're\n22:57 Comment: going really well under the new coach\n23:2 Comment: Podolsky sliding it through to Hector Bellerin that was the intent he was out\n23:7 Comment: quickly enough Sinan Bolat yeah I think he's given offside good idea again\n23:13 Comment: they really have stretched them in the channel so far Arsenal\n23:37 Comment: 6-ニーズ\n24:0 Comment: Bruma and he's come across to cover Bruma showed too much of that to Callum Chambers\n24:7 Comment: Richelak\n24:11 Comment: it's chammed out\n24:15 Comment: Boulut\n24:23 Comment: was he offside here? yeah maybe half a yard just gone a little bit earlier\n24:37 Comment: Tellez\n24:40 Comment: that's proof\n24:42 Comment: that's been a loss, heavily outnumbered here Boulut\n24:46 Comment: that's the effort from Sanogo\n24:48 Comment: I don't think he's ever going to get a penalty for that\n24:50 Comment: he did really well at opening the target up for himself\n25:1 Comment: looks like Chamberlain is enjoying the central role\n25:4 Comment: the width provided here by Campbell\n25:7 Comment: nearly got it through to Aaron Ramsey\n25:23 Comment: despite all their troubles they're going pretty well Galatasaray in the Turkish league\n25:27 Comment: anything other than first spot is seen as disappointing failure\n25:31 Comment: such as the expectation here\n25:33 Comment: that one point off the lead of their city rivals Besiktas\n25:37 Comment: here's Podolski\n25:38 Comment: Ramsey\n25:42 Comment: Campbell wants it\n25:43 Comment: and the blocks from Tellez\n25:44 Comment: yeah so many options here Aaron Ramsey couldn't make up his mind\n25:48 Comment: I think Joe Campbell telling him that he wanted a little bit earlier than he got it\n26:3 Comment: Arsenal do have a corner though\n26:7 Comment: 編\n26:35 Comment: if they're going to allow Mertesacker to get a run at it.\n26:54 Comment: What a terrible pass.\n26:55 Comment: Gifted straight to Sanogo.\n26:57 Comment: Here's Aaron Ramsey.\n26:59 Comment: Now Lukasz Podolski.\n27:1 Comment: Side netting this time.\n27:2 Comment: Decent save.\n27:3 Comment: Yeah, again, the setup is really good there.\n27:6 Comment: Instead of going with the top of his foot,\n27:8 Comment: he goes with the inside that time,\n27:9 Comment: just trying to find the inside of the near post.\n27:13 Comment: Goalkeeper did well.\n27:16 Comment: Probably expecting this to go back across him.\n27:21 Comment: It's always said, isn't it,\n27:22 Comment: that the goalkeeper should keep it out of the near post,\n27:24 Comment: but it's quite something when it's Lukasz Podolski striking it.\n27:29 Comment: Just as everything seemed to be going according to plan for Arsenal,\n27:32 Comment: they need to...\n27:33 Comment: Matt, call for the physio.\n27:35 Comment: The player down.\n27:45 Comment: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n27:53 Comment: It appeared to be immediate concern,\n27:55 Comment: the way that so many of the Arsenal players went and surrounded him.\n27:57 Comment: He's been terrific so far.\n27:59 Comment: He and Aaron Ramsey have run the game so far.\n28:3 Comment: Some running repairs for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain\n28:7 Comment: on the sideline as Campbell takes.\n28:13 Comment: Ramsey.\n28:14 Comment: Oh!\n28:17 Comment: You do not hit them much better than that.\n28:20 Comment: What a spectacular strike from Aaron Ramsey.\n28:24 Comment: Yeah, totally outrageous.\n28:27 Comment: Made it look easy, didn't he?\n28:28 Comment: On the half-volley, anything but.\n28:30 Comment: And then he's caught it absolutely flush.\n28:33 Comment: And I didn't do much wrong to think they've got it safe.\n28:40 Comment: And what a half-volley that is.\n28:46 Comment: Oh, right on the money.\n28:47 Comment: Fabulous finish.\n28:50 Comment: Sums up this Arsenal performance so far.\n28:52 Comment: It really has been top draw from Arsene Wenger's side.\n28:55 Comment: Oh, maybe got it just before it hit the ground.\n29:3 Comment: It makes Vic\n29:4 Comment: even more difficult, 샘\n29:14 Comment: One-man wouldn't ever think about –\n29:15 Comment: And it may be true.\n29:16 Comment: Please Sportsuurman and his hat off to him.\n29:17 Comment: I can see it.\n29:18 Comment: He's really held onto hardball.\n29:20 Comment: ciello\n29:23 Comment: h Quandthere � symbo unser verstand\n29:31 Comment: that lifestyle as well as medical needs and a small iron ghazn to do that.\n29:32 Comment: He's losing so much of himself.\n29:33 Comment: one of the scenarios that did seem more unlikely at the start of play here in terms of Arsenal\n29:47 Comment: finishing top of the group is Dortmund drawing at home and Arsenal wiping out the goal deficit\n29:51 Comment: well they're halfway to doing that at the moment they wouldn't rule out the way this game is going\n29:56 Comment: would you they score six here and it finishes as it is in Dortmund Arsenal's goal difference\n30:3 Comment: will take them above the Germans into top spot\n30:5 Comment: another scenario that's a little easier on the mathematics side of things\n30:16 Comment: is an Arsenal win here which now looks a formality although we said that against Anderlecht didn't we\n30:22 Comment: the Dortmund defeat in the way that they've been going recently even though they did have a home\n30:28 Comment: win last time out we never know quite what to expect from Jurgen Klopp's side at the moment\n30:33 Comment: as the new\n30:48 Comment: at the campeon\n30:48 Comment: die\n30:51 Comment: a\n30:52 Comment: in\n30:57 Comment: we\n30:58 Comment:

he sees it coming, manages to get his feet off the ground.\n33:28 Comment: He's got a shot in there from Yaya Sonogo.\n33:46 Comment: Pop out Galatasa, right?\n33:58 Comment: Aaron Ramsey's goal against Stoke at the weekend was his first in 16 matches.\n34:10 Comment: Now he has two inside half an hour here.\n34:15 Comment: Here's Bruma, now by Debussy.\n34:18 Comment: I'm not quite sure why Debussy's arguing there.\n34:21 Comment: It's a clear free kick and it's certainly within range.\n34:24 Comment: I'd be surprised if Schneider doesn't have this.\n34:27 Comment: I'm not quite sure why.\n34:28 Comment: Can't never say it was foot.\n34:58 Comment: I think he gets the dip he's looking for, but never really a threat to Chesney's right-hand post.\n35:20 Comment: Strike, strike, strike!\n35:28 Comment: Whip to Le sp.\n35:30 Comment: With Chesney.\n35:31 Comment: Foul.\n35:32 Comment: Glos.\n35:33 Comment: Four-on.\n35:34 Comment: Three-on.\n35:36 Comment: Treb кли

sums up Arsenal's attitude in this game so far.\n36:22 Comment: Not playing like a team that have already qualified.\n36:28 Comment: First half they played like a team with a point to prove, haven't they?\n36:31 Comment: Yeah, they've done that.\n36:33 Comment: What a half it's had Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n36:52 Comment: Guilmes.\n36:54 Comment: Adi Chandal.\n36:56 Comment: Ahead of the

back.\n39:28 Comment: Ramsey takes the distance on the punch from Sinan Bolat.\n39:40 Comment: That's a really good ball from Ramsey.\n39:41 Comment: He's looking for somebody to get across the front of the keeper.\n39:58 Comment: Campbell, Ramsey, back to Campbell.\n40:3 Comment: It's really well worked.\n40:5 Comment: It's very close to an Arsenal fourth.\n40:7 Comment: What a good first touch he takes.\n40:10 Comment: The ball's slightly behind him,\n40:12 Comment: but he managed to get it out of his feet with his first touch.\n40:15 Comment: To open up the target.\n40:19 Comment: Good save from the keeper again.\n40:28 Comment: John Campbell, the man who has now played\n40:32 Comment: marginally over an hour of first-team football for Arsenal this season.\n40:37 Comment: He's on corner kick duties here.\n40:39 Comment: One of his best.\n40:42 Comment: Oxlade-Chamberlain has a swing at it.\n40:44 Comment: Yeah, asking a bit too much for two to fly into the top corner, isn't it?\n40:48 Comment: But both Oxlade-Chamberlain and Ramsey, for me,\n40:51 Comment: have been absolutely top draws so far.\n40:58 Comment: Hello, intercepts.\n41:10 Comment: Schneider.\n41:13 Comment: Experienced heads in this side,\n41:14 Comment: and Schneider trying to curl it into that top corner.\n41:18 Comment: Yeah, it's a good effort.\n41:20 Comment: Always moving away from the post.\n41:25

though.\n41:40 Comment: Podolski.\n41:42 Comment: Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n41:43 Comment: Taken away from him by Melo.\n41:47 Comment: He's surprised to see Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain penalised there.\n41:50 Comment: He did have his hands on Felipe Melo.\n41:58 Comment: And the 31-year-old Brazilian is certainly a combative character.\n42:5 Comment: In the heart of that Galatasaray midfield.\n42:8 Comment: Leggy run from Sunogo.\n42:9 Comment: He could be in big trouble here.\n42:10 Comment: Tariq chammed out.\n42:11 Comment: I don't think by any stretch it's a goal-scoring opportunity,\n42:14 Comment: but it's certainly a yellow card.\n42:15 Comment: Yeah, I knew what he was doing.\n42:16 Comment: It's a foul that he has to make, isn't it?\n42:18 Comment: .\n42:46 Comment: Another good delivery by Ramsey.\n42:48 Comment: .\n42:51 Comment: Well, it's a measure of the confidence of Adam Ramsey,\n42:54 Comment: the way he knocked it in there with the outside of his foot.\n42:57 Comment: .\n42:58 Comment: delivery.\n42:59 Comment: Chambers dealing with the threat of the recumbent as well.\n43:22 Comment: Looks like Chamberlain's lost out.\n43:24 Comment: Tonight we said that.\n43:28 Comment: This places his pass to Debussy.\n43:33 Comment: Looks like Chamberlain.\n43:35 Comment: Debussy.\n43:37 Comment: Campbell.\n43:46 Comment: Campbell, Sunogo.\n43:49 Comment: Here's Aaron Ramsey trying to thread it through.\n43:52 Comment: Very congested central defensive area there.\n43:54 Comment: That's a good one for Galatasaray.\n44:24 Comment: It's going to be a good one.\n44:26 Comment: That's a good one for Galatasaray.\n44:28 Comment: Canalski.\n44:36 Comment: Looks like Chamberlain.\n44:44 Comment: .\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: That was in the FA Cup against Coventry back in January.\n0:10 Comment: So Arsene Wenger clearly feeling that the battle is won, there's no evidence to suggest otherwise.\n0:16 Comment: And it's time to blood a couple of youngsters.\n0:19 Comment: I've got a sense of surprise, no disrespect to the kids, but...\n0:24 Comment: Having watched Arsenal destroy this team in the first half, getting six isn't outwith the realms of possibility, is it?\n0:38 Comment: Mainsley, Maitland, Niles, one over six foot, he's slotted into the Flamini role.\n0:44 Comment: Just in front of the Arsenal back four.\n0:48 Comment: Zelenayev, as it stands, at the back, just behind Nya-Nya Sonogo.\n1:6 Comment: We're hoping we'll try to get word for you, the reason for Aaron Ramsey being taken off at half-time.\n1:11 Comment: Surely he'd love to have stayed on and pushed on for his first Arsenal hat-trick.\n1:15 Comment: Certainly didn't look to be an injury to the midfielder.\n1:45 Comment: Schneider.\n2:1 Comment: Melo.\n2:4 Comment: Czolak.\n2:5 Comment: Now Bruma.\n2:16 Comment: Mouton-Tolk making an immediate impact.\n2:20 Comment: A real tester for Szczęsny.\n2:27 Comment: Campbell.\n2:33 Comment: Gives it

Mainsley, Maitland, Niles.\n3:0 Comment: At the start of play, Arsenal's average age is 24.\n3:5 Comment: That will have dropped by a few years now with the introduction of the two teams.\n3:12 Comment: Uchakin.\n3:21 Comment: Joel Campbell caught plenty of Uchakin there.\n3:23 Comment: Apologise.\n3:25 Comment: I'm sure the referee saw it.\n3:26 Comment: Certainly didn't feel it merited.\n3:29 Comment: Free kick.\n3:31 Comment: Here's Bruma.\n3:39 Comment: Melo.\n3:43 Comment: Mouton-Tolk.\n3:49 Comment: That effort from Uchakin.\n3:52 Comment: Yeah, he's a little bit distracted there.\n3:54 Comment: He's got a runner on his outside.\n3:56 Comment: He's caught two against one.\n3:58 Comment: That's why he can't go to the ball.\n4:0 Comment: He's really got to back off here, the full-back.\n4:13 Comment: Offside flag goes up against Yaya Sonogo.\n4:30 Comment: The news that could really make Arsenal's night, of course, is that it comes in from the Westfalenstadion.\n4:35 Comment: Anderlecht have taken an unlikely lead.\n4:37 Comment: It's still Goalless there.\n4:43 Comment: It's not always the defensive side that delights Arsene Wenger.\n4:47 Comment: But after what happened at the weekend, he delighted coming away from here with a clean sheet as well.\n4:56 Comment: Next up, of course, in the Premier League on Saturday, Saturday evening, is the visit of Newcastle.\n5:3 Comment: Much of the powder kept dry for that.\n5:8 Comment: Aaron Ramsey withdrawn.\n5:13 Comment: They're starting to get frustrated. Wesley Schneider.\n5:16 Comment: Not quite the force he was a few seasons ago, is he?\n5:21 Comment: He went all the way, Jose Mourinho, into Milan in 2010.\n5:26 Comment: Across from Tellez, looking for Umut Bulut.\n5:28 Comment: Out by Chambers.\n5:42 Comment: Altentop.\n5:45 Comment: With Mello.\n5:54 Comment: Zelalem.\n5:56 Comment: Sonogo.\n5:59 Comment: Schneider has it back for Galatasaray.\n6:3 Comment: It's another of those who's been around the European block.\n6:6 Comment: Hamid Altentop.\n6:8 Comment: One of his previous clubs, Bayern Munich.\n6:13 Comment: Celebrated his 32nd birthday yesterday.\n6:27 Comment: He's still very old with some of the company he's keeping and the Arsenal youngsters coming up.\n6:32 Comment: He's half his age.\n6:42 Comment: This is the first bump in the road for Hamza Hamzoglu, the former Galatasaray midfielder since he took over here.\n7:2 Comment: Two good and much needed wins, one in the Turkish Cup competition, one in the league in his previous two matches in charge.\n7:12 Comment: After the first half performance here, the second half would appear to be about just saving face.\n7:32 Comment: Bruma.\n7:34 Comment: Altentop on the overlap.\n7:43 Comment: Mello.\n7:46 Comment: Altentop.\n7:49 Comment: It should be Sheznews ball but it's out by Chambers.\n7:53 Comment: Campbell has gifted it to Kolchak.\n7:57 Comment: Now Wesley.\n8:1 Comment: Now the touch in the build-up was the Schneider of all there, wasn't it?\n8:5 Comment: Yeah, the first touch.\n8:7 Comment: Takes him away from Campbell here.\n8:9 Comment: Again the target is open, more than decent effort.\n8:39 Comment: Just had some work from the Arsenal camp over the half-time substitutions.\n8:51 Comment: Aaron Ramsey may well have been complaining of a tight hamstring at half-time, so he understandably not risked.\n8:58 Comment: Martial Flamini having been booked.\n9:3 Comment: A few flare moments in the first half in terms of flare-ups between players, so he's taken out as a precaution with Mikel Arteta injured.\n9:27 Comment: Bruma.\n9:29 Comment: Altentop.\n9:41 Comment: Bruma.\n9:45 Comment: Chalak.\n9:46 Comment: Schneider.\n9:49 Comment: Can Kolchak in?\n9:58 Comment: Machidin's challenge on Kodushy.\n10:2 Comment: It's given the Galatasaray supporters something to get their teeth into, they haven't had much tonight.\n10:27 Comment: Umut Bulut.\n10:40 Comment: Telez.\n10:43 Comment: Get the feet of the full-back.\n10:44 Comment: Looks to feed Bruma.\n10:46 Comment: Hooked away by Bellerin.\n10:48 Comment: Torres Melo.\n10:50 Comment: Altentop.\n10:58 Comment: Bruma.\n11:2 Comment: Melo.\n11:3 Comment: From distance, blocked away by Matusaka.\n11:6 Comment: Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n11:7 Comment: A wrestle away from Melo.\n11:8 Comment: Terrific.\n11:9 Comment: Leaving Melo on the deck and he was pulled back there by Semmy.\n11:12 Comment: He'll be in trouble.\n11:13 Comment: Yeah, he's too strong for his opponent now.\n11:17 Comment: They really found him impossible to handle tonight, Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n11:21 Comment: Terrific change of pace.\n11:22 Comment: Great strength of his as well.\n11:27 Comment: He's just run through them at times, run through the midfield.\n11:34 Comment: Melo is supposed to be a midfield hard man.\n11:37 Comment: He was out-muscled by the Ocs there in no uncertain terms.\n11:43 Comment: The enforcer for Galatasaray, ending up on the deck.\n11:51 Comment: Delelam.\n11:52 Comment: Showing a touch of confidence.\n11:58 Comment: Now Campbell.\n12:0 Comment: Also looking for the free kick.\n12:1 Comment: Should have had one.\n12:28 Comment: Good run from Hector Bellerin.\n12:33 Comment: Out in top.\n12:37 Comment: As news comes in from Dortmund.\n12:40 Comment: That Chiro Immobile has given Jürgen Klopp's side the lead.\n12:44 Comment: The Italian scoring.\n12:46 Comment: Which means that all Arsenal's work here will be in vain.\n12:49 Comment: Dortmund will be confirmed as it stands.\n12:52 Comment: As group winners and Arsenal yet again.\n12:54 Comment: Will go through in second place.\n12:57 Comment: For the fifth time in six seasons.\n13:25 Comment: Arsenal set up in their zonal marking.\n13:27 Comment: Chambers attacks the ball.\n13:31 Comment: About the sort of position where Aaron Ramsey scored that goal.\n13:35 Comment: It's played out by Czolak.\n13:39 Comment: Schneider.\n13:41 Comment: Inch perfect for Bruma.\n13:43 Comment: And then he's got a chance to score.\n13:46 Comment: And it's a goal.\n13:51 Comment: Schneider.\n13:53 Comment: Inch perfect for Bruma.\n13:56 Comment: It's proof.\n13:57 Comment: We've got three in the box.\n13:59 Comment: And he's missed every one of them out there.\n14:14 Comment: Alex Tellez.\n14:16 Comment: Schneider.\n14:18 Comment: Back to Tellez.\n14:20 Comment: Debussy getting that spot on.\n14:25 Comment: Well, Sam Ingerfeld the worst when he saw his French fullback go to ground.\n14:28 Comment: But he.\n14:30 Comment: Absolutely inch perfect.\n14:31 Comment: Getting the ball.\n14:36 Comment: Oshakin.\n14:40 Comment: Never really a problem.\n14:41 Comment: Might have been a problem.\n14:42 Comment: Had Chambers got something on it.\n14:43 Comment: Could have deflected it.\n14:44 Comment: Made it more awkward.\n14:46 Comment: They look up a better side.\n14:48 Comment: Yes.\n14:49 Comment: Second half so far.\n14:50 Comment: But.\n14:52 Comment: I think Arsenal have changed down again.\n14:55 Comment: The horse has bolted as far as Galatasaray are concerned.\n15:4 Comment: Certainly since Lucas Podolski blasted Arsenal into that third minute lead.\n15:8 Comment: And perhaps even before that.\n15:10 Comment: Never really looked a force in the match.\n15:12 Comment: After 29 minutes they were three down.\n15:18 Comment: They remain as we pass the hour mark.\n15:32 Comment: Pretty crude by Mello on Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n15:34 Comment: It's given Campbell a chance to go on a really good run forward before he's brought down by Semmy.\n15:40 Comment: That is a close one.\n15:41 Comment: Semmy had been booked for a bad challenge a moment ago.\n15:45 Comment: If the free kick had been given would probably have had to have been booked again.\n15:48 Comment: Yeah.\n15:49 Comment: But this thing now and again Joe Campbell's got to lift his head a little bit quicker.\n15:51 Comment: He had Podolski in the left hand side.\n16:2 Comment: Oshakin.\n16:9 Comment: The two substitutes that Hamza Hamzalou sent on at half time have been lively haven't they?\n16:17 Comment: Yes in Oshakan down this left hand side and coming from the right area of defence into midfield.\n16:22 Comment: Hamid Alton top.\n16:40 Comment: Maitland-Niles to Podolski.\n16:53 Comment: Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n16:58 Comment: Bellerin.\n17:0 Comment: The 19 year old back to the 17 year old Maitland-Niles.\n17:10 Comment: There are good times and bad times to give a youngster a taste of first team action.\n17:15 Comment: This coming to the former category.\n17:19 Comment: Well I think any Champions League experience for a 17 year old is priceless Bill.\n17:24 Comment: It is a great opportunity 3-0 up to give them a taste of it.\n17:33 Comment: Campbell.\n17:40 Comment: Chamberlain showing a composed touch again.\n17:49 Comment: In the way by Maitland-Niles.\n17:51 Comment: There is some way to making up for it.\n17:56 Comment: There is a gap in behind Debussy for Schneider.\n18:0 Comment: Schneider, Umut Bulut, bad first touch, Bruma.\n18:4 Comment: I think Wesley Schneider wanted it back.\n18:10 Comment: I just wonder whether Arsene Wenger is going to have to make his third substitution sooner rather than later.\n18:16 Comment: Matu Debussy who hasn't played any first team football since he got injured against Manchester City just about three months ago.\n18:24 Comment: Looked very leggy chasing back there.\n18:26 Comment: Yeah when the possession turned over he was on the wrong side of the ball and he was really struggling to get back.\n18:31 Comment: No offside flag here against Yaya Sonogu.\n18:33 Comment: It stays down.\n18:35 Comment: Option to bound. Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n18:37 Comment: Couldn't quite take it cleanly first time.\n18:43 Comment: Still battling on.\n18:55 Comment: Galatasaray 3-0 down at home.\n18:58 Comment: Careering towards their fifth consecutive Champions League defeat which would be the first time in the same season that's ever happened to them but still.\n19:5 Comment: Wonderful atmosphere.\n19:6 Comment: Yeah it's remarkable the way this crowd have stuck with them isn't it? 3-0 down.\n19:15 Comment: Del Alente is possessed by Bruma.\n19:18 Comment: Umut Bulut looking for Schneider.\n19:21 Comment: Good strength for Schneider to hold off Debussy.\n19:23 Comment: Belerin back on the cover.\n19:27 Comment: Debussy will pick up a yellow card.\n19:30 Comment: Another tug I think on Schneider there.\n19:33 Comment: He is feeling this pace.\n19:35 Comment: Debussy.\n19:44 Comment: Always wrong side there. Couldn't make a tackle with his foot.\n19:48 Comment: And a card for Lucas Podolsky as well.\n19:50 Comment: Must have been for something he said to the Spanish referee.\n20:17 Comment: Delivery duties on this one will fall to Hammett out in top.\n20:26 Comment: Nochikhin. It's loose.\n20:28 Comment: What a saving challenge that is by Per Murtazaka.\n20:32 Comment: Galatasaray man already wheeling away in celebration before the long leg of the Arsenal captain denied him.\n20:38 Comment: Del Alente. Nochikhin.\n20:44 Comment: Cholak.\n20:46 Comment: Bruma.\n20:48 Comment: Murtazaka clips it behind for a corner.\n20:51 Comment: They're responding to this wonderful atmosphere at the home side.\n20:53 Comment: Yeah they almost got lucky.\n20:54 Comment: They got really fortunate deflection there off the free kick.\n20:57 Comment: Murtazaka did well.\n21:0 Comment: Did well again there to hit the ball.\n21:2 Comment: And it's a goal.\n21:3 Comment: In comes the cross again.\n21:7 Comment: And out in top.\n21:10 Comment: Nowhere near troubling.\n21:11 Comment: Boise X. Sharesney.\n21:12 Comment: They'll desperately want a clean sheet tonight.\n21:14 Comment: Particularly the two Arsenal centre backs who come in.\n21:18 Comment: Rightly so for so much criticism after the Stoke game.\n21:22 Comment: They'll be desperately looking for a clean sheet.\n21:24 Comment: And they will.\n21:31 Comment: After the Stoke game.\n21:33 Comment: They'll be desperate to go off here with a clean sheet tonight.\n21:42 Comment: Cholak.\n21:43 Comment: To Schneider.\n21:46 Comment: At the moment Arsenal having to work to keep that clean sheet intact.\n21:51 Comment: Especially giving away by Sanogo on that occasion.\n22:1 Comment: Melo.\n22:21 Comment: Nesin Ocakur, Wesley Sneijder.\n22:24 Comment: Chalked into the ground.\n22:27 Comment: Trying to cut cross I think.\n22:32 Comment: This lot are remarkable the way they've stuck behind the team tonight.\n22:38 Comment: Terrific support.\n23:31 Comment: In terms of options to change things from the bench, Sanvengers left themselves short.\n23:41 Comment: Here's Bruma.\n23:48 Comment: Cholak to Alcantar.\n23:54 Comment: Now by Debussy.\n24:1 Comment: Sunogo.\n24:3 Comment: You can feel he needed to hold it there.\n24:23 Comment: Just coming back at Arsenal a little too regularly.\n24:26 Comment: Melo.\n24:38 Comment: And Rachel Lach.\n24:40 Comment: And Alcantar.\n24:44 Comment: Umut Bulut.\n24:47 Comment: Debussy bravely in.\n24:49 Comment: Democic in.\n24:56 Comment: It's like Chamberlain.\n25:6 Comment: Joe Campbell.\n25:19 Comment: Debussy.\n25:26 Comment: Umut.\n25:27 Comment: Telling himself about Joe Campbell and Galatasaray rather curiously getting the throw in.\n25:31 Comment: Asenger throwing the ball down in disgust at that decision.\n25:56 Comment: Melo.\n26:12 Comment: Melo dispossessing Zellermann.\n26:14 Comment: Heine-Sneijder.\n26:17 Comment: Nashin Occiki.\n26:20 Comment: Tellers outside.\n26:22 Comment: Two in the middle here.\n26:23 Comment: If Tellers can get it right.\n26:24 Comment: Now by Chambers.\n26:31 Comment: Zellermann.\n26:32 Comment: To Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n26:33 Comment: No brakes on here.\n26:37 Comment: Joe Campbell.\n26:39 Comment: Podolsky has a hand up on the far side.\n26:41 Comment: Again Joe Campbell can get his head up.\n26:43 Comment: That's the problem.\n26:44 Comment: Just on too many occasions tonight he hasn't lifted his head.\n26:47 Comment: Again he had a few options.\n26:48 Comment: The terrific feet can go past defenders.\n26:52 Comment: And again he should be looking for the pass.\n26:58 Comment: His chances have been so few and far between for Arsenal this season.\n27:2 Comment: Perhaps you can.\n27:4 Comment: See why he's keen to impress perhaps a little too keen.\n27:10 Comment: One department where it is level pegging.\n27:12 Comment: Level pegging.\n27:20 Comment: Debussy too strong in the challenge for Occiki.\n27:23 Comment: Joe Campbell.\n27:28 Comment: Must be too much of a tiring Debussy.\n27:32 Comment: Yeah he's in Teltebion half isn't he Debussy.\n27:35 Comment: Strong rumors coming out of this club that they've been looking at Joe Campbell as a possible bit of January business.\n27:43 Comment: Strengthen their forward line as they concentrate on domestic matters.\n27:47 Comment: They're short of finishing bottom of course.\n27:49 Comment: Anderlecht knew before tonight whatever happened that they'd have the Europa League place from this group.\n27:55 Comment: Well it looks a bit much better player than Bruma.\n27:57 Comment: He's had no joy on either side of the pitch tonight for Galatasaray.\n28:17 Comment: He's slipped awkwardly.\n28:19 Comment: He's OK though.\n28:21 Comment: Out in top.\n28:30 Comment: Terrific chance isn't it.\n28:32 Comment: Not quite sure why.\n28:33 Comment: Alticin doesn't hit it himself.\n28:36 Comment: But he's got plenty of time there.\n28:38 Comment: He's got plenty of time.\n28:47 Comment: Alticin doesn't hit it himself.\n28:49 Comment: But he's got plenty of time there to get that on target.\n28:54 Comment: That's poor.\n29:0 Comment: I've seen tonight the fondness that Hamed Alcintop has for getting forward.\n29:6 Comment: I'm surprised that he's only scored one goal for Galatasaray which did come in the Champions League a few seasons ago.\n29:11 Comment: Against Schalke.\n29:14 Comment: Here's LLM.\n29:15 Comment: Roxley, Chamberlain.\n29:18 Comment: Martintop back in defensive mode.\n29:23 Comment: Poulut.\n29:44 Comment: Bruma.\n29:46 Comment: Mello.\n29:48 Comment: And Telus.\n29:54 Comment: Bruma.\n30:0 Comment: Michalak.\n30:5 Comment: Bruma.\n30:9 Comment: Chiquita, Schneider.\n30:11 Comment: Mello.\n30:13 Comment: And Telus.\n30:24 Comment: Mello.\n30:32 Comment: And Telus.\n30:33 Comment: Inching forward before Telus finally puts a cross that is more than comfortable for Szczesny.\n30:41 Comment: And looks for Sonogo.\n30:43 Comment: Yeah, it's a good idea from the keeper.\n30:45 Comment: Acknowledgement there from Sonogo, just trying to get him away as early as possible here on the left.\n30:49 Comment: And a little bit of a lead on the left.\n31:19 Comment: And a good dribble thrown on.\n31:29 Comment: And Olcan Adin comes on and replaces the young Portuguese Bruma.\n31:34 Comment: Bruma.\n31:46 Comment: Roxley, Chamberlain.\n31:47 Comment: I fancy a shot. Steady fields.\n31:49 Comment: Keats, Campbell.\n31:54 Comment: Podolski trying to bring it down.\n31:55 Comment: The referee spotted a nudge in there.\n32:34 Comment: Ochekin.\n32:45 Comment: Ocona has slotted in it right back incidentally.\n32:48 Comment: Mello.\n32:51 Comment: Telus.\n32:54 Comment: Ocona there to scoop it into the path of Schneider.\n32:59 Comment: Ochekin to tee it up.\n33:1 Comment: Arsenal in a bit of a mess.\n33:2 Comment: But it's out by Maitland-Niles.\n33:6 Comment: Out in top.\n33:9 Comment: Ocona glances it away.\n33:11 Comment: They've got a little bit of a problem on the left-hand side, Arsenal.\n33:14 Comment: No stop on the crosses coming in.\n33:16 Comment: Joe Campbell should sit in there at the moment.\n33:19 Comment: Give a little bit of protection.\n33:21 Comment: Here we go again.\n33:22 Comment: Mello's got him behind Ocona.\n33:24 Comment: Still going Mello.\n33:26 Comment: Schneider, just about blocked away.\n33:28 Comment: Taken

otherwise.\n37:19 Comment: But Mertesacker at the moment is making no effort at all to get them up the pitch, that back four.\n37:29 Comment: We've got the 17-year-old debutant, Stefan Ocona, right

course.\n38:25 Comment: Life and hope, where before there was none.\n38:28 Comment: Or little.\n38:42 Comment: Just as Arsenal would not want to be judged by their performance on Saturday,\n38:47 Comment: I think we can judge what they've given tonight in their first half.\n38:50 Comment: In the second, as Davey was saying, they have dropped off and played much more within themselves.\n38:56 Comment: Those two half-time changes which we gather were precautionary.\n38:59 Comment: Perhaps his tight hamstring and Mathieu Flamini, the way that the injuries are in midfield at the moment.\n39:6 Comment: Taking off as a precaution so he wasn't sent off here.\n39:12 Comment: Much a kid.\n39:13 Comment: Behind off Chambers.\n39:15 Comment: Ocona just showing them too much of the outside

surprised if he doesn't take this on.\n40:44 Comment: The last Champions League goal of the season.\n40:47 Comment: The last Champions League goal he scored was here last year to knock out Juventus.\n40:51 Comment: This one won't carry such importance if he gets it in.\n41:1 Comment: Hitting the target, but...\n41:2 Comment: Kosek Szczesny would have been very disappointed.\n41:4 Comment: Had that done anything, that could have been a different goal.\n41:9 Comment: Szalak.\n41:10 Comment: There to Sakisera.\n41:17 Comment: And Richalak again.\n41:20 Comment: That's not block was effective enough.\n41:22 Comment: He's given the free kick just outside the penalty area here.\n41:25 Comment: Handball from Mertesak.\n41:26 Comment: Yeah, I think it's harsh when the ball has travelled such a short distance.\n41:33 Comment: I don't think there was any intent.\n41:41 Comment: Maybe he felt his hand was unnaturally high.\n41:44 Comment: That's the only reason he could give that.\n42:14 Comment: Schneider.\n42:24 Comment: Schneider!\n42:26 Comment: That is a Schneider special.\n42:30 Comment: We've seen some strikes tonight.\n42:32 Comment: And Wesley Schneider gets it on the act with a Galatasaray consolation.\n42:36 Comment: Yeah, it's a fabulous strike from Schneider.\n42:38 Comment: I think to be...\n42:39 Comment: To be fair to Szczesny, you can't see the ball being struck there.\n42:46 Comment: You've got 1, 2, 3, 5 in the wall there.\n42:48 Comment: Can't see it being struck.\n42:49 Comment: It's Szczesny's side of the goal.\n42:52 Comment: I don't think you can blame him.\n42:53 Comment: It's such a good strike.\n42:54 Comment: Right inside the post.\n42:56 Comment: At long last, we see the very best of Wesley Schneider.\n43:0 Comment: What doesn't come across in the slow-motion replays\n43:3 Comment: is the pace with which he hit it.\n43:5 Comment: Said it was the sort of range that could require a blaster.\n43:8 Comment: He certainly delivered that.\n43:12 Comment: They're not quite empty-handed, at least the Galatasaray support\n43:15 Comment: who've been pretty magnificent in terms of constant singing throughout the match.\n43:22 Comment: They'll have something to talk about in the cafes and bars around the stadium.\n43:35 Comment: There's no clean sheet for Arsenal.\n43:40 Comment: It is a final day win, and that is a rarity.\n43:47 Comment: They've lost their last three final group games.\n43:50 Comment: They haven't actually won away from home\n43:54 Comment: since 1999 in the final group game.\n43:58 Comment: At least that is one statistic that is rewritten in the history of football.\n44:2 Comment: At least that is one statistic that is rewritten tonight.\n44:9 Comment: That unhappy habit, although many would take it a finishing second,\n44:13 Comment: and that's guaranteeing one of the big guns, the first-place finishers, will continue.\n44:21 Comment: Having said that, the last time Arsenal did finish top of the group,\n44:24 Comment: they drew AC Milan and in the following game lost 4-0 away from home.\n44:28 Comment: There are no guarantees, of course.\n44:30 Comment: It is more often than not a

    "summary": "In a pulsating UEFA Champions League encounter held at the raucous Türk Telekom Stadium in Istanbul, Arsenal emerged triumphant with a commanding 4-1 victory over Galatasaray. This match was the culmination of a roller-coaster campaign for Arsenal, who displayed both frailties and brilliance throughout the group stages. Their performance against Galatasaray, however, was a resounding exhibition of their offensive prowess and tactical discipline.\n\nThe game kicked off with both sides looking to assert their dominance early. Galatasaray started with a mixture of seasoned internationals and youthful exuberance, while Arsenal fielded a side that, despite some rotation, oozed quality and promise. \n\n#### First Half\n\nArsenal began the game with a sense of purpose, immediately pressing Galatasaray and exploiting spaces down the flanks. The early exchanges saw Arsenal probing the Turkish defense, with Lukas Podolski and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain particularly influential. It was Podolski who drew first blood in the third minute, unleashing a thunderous left-footed strike from an acute angle that left the Turkish goalkeeper, Sinan Bolat, grasping at thin air. This goal set the tone for Arsenal’s first-half dominance.\n\nGalatasaray attempted to mount a response, looking to their key playmaker Wesley Sneijder to orchestrate their attacks. Sneijder managed to create a few half-chances, threading the ball through to their top scorer Burak Yilmaz, but the Arsenal defense, marshaled by Per Mertesacker and the returning Mathieu Debuchy, held firm. \n\nArsenal's fluid attacking play continued to cause problems for the home side. In the twelfth minute, a sublime piece of play involving Oxlade-Chamberlain and Aaron Ramsey widened the visitors' lead. Oxlade-Chamberlain’s powerful run drew the attention of two defenders before he smartly laid the ball into Ramsey's path. The Welshman took a touch to settle himself before coolly slotting the ball into the bottom corner of the net, doubling Arsenal's advantage.\n\nGalatasaray found themselves constantly on the back foot, their efforts to disrupt Arsenal’s rhythm proving ineffective. Arsenal’s young full-back Hector Bellerin and midfielder Aaron Ramsey continued to play with incisive intent, linking up frequently and exploiting the wide areas. In the 29th minute, Arsenal effectively sealed the game with a moment of sheer brilliance from Ramsey, who collected a clearance outside the box. With a one-time half-volley, Ramsey struck the ball with such purity and power that it rocketed into the top corner, leaving Bolat stationary. This extraordinary goal put Arsenal 3-0 ahead and effectively silenced the Galatasaray faithful.\n\nGalatasaray’s defensive cohesion seemed to crumble whenever Arsenal pushed forward. Even though the home side had sporadic moments of promise, particularly through Sneijder and Bruma, they were unable to produce anything meaningful to trouble Wojciech Szczesny in the Arsenal goal. The half ended with Arsenal comfortably in command.\n\n#### Second Half\n\nThe second half began with Arsene Wenger making strategic changes, introducing youthful talents Ainsley Maitland-Niles and Gedion Zelalem. This signaled a slight shift in Arsenal's approach, intending to manage the game rather than relentlessly attack. Despite this, Arsenal’s offensive quality wasn't entirely diminished. \n\nGalatasaray came into the second half with more urgency, trying to salvage some pride in front of their supporters. They introduced Hamid Altintop and Okan to add some stability and creativity to their midfield. Early sight of goal came for the hosts when Bruma's fierce shot tested Szczesny, but the Polish goalkeeper was equal to the task. \n\nArsenal, however, continued to threaten on the counter. The pace and directness of Oxlade-Chamberlain and Campbell kept the Galatasaray defense worried. In one such instance, Oxlade-Chamberlain powered through the Galatasaray midfield, only to be brought down cynically by Semih Kaya, who received a booking for his troubles.\n\nAs the game settled into its concluding stage, a speculative effort by Altintop and set-piece deliveries from Sneijder began to test the Arsenal defense anew. Mertesacker and Chambers remained resolute, repelling numerous crosses and long balls that Galatasaray launched into the area.\n\nIn the 87th minute, the Turkish side found some consolation through a sumptuous free-kick by Wesley Sneijder. Afforded space just outside the box, Sneijder curled the ball with precision and pace, past the outstretched arms of Szczesny, finally giving the home fans something to cheer about.\n\nAs the game drew to a close, Arsenal didn't take their foot off the pedal completely. Deep into stoppage time, they showcased their ruthlessness one last time. With a swift breakaway, Lukas Podolski found himself in acres of space on the left, and with characteristic aplomb, he sealed the victory by slotting the ball past Bolat for his second goal of the evening. His celebration encapsulated Arsenal's night - a mixture of relief, delight, and renewed confidence. This goal underlined Podolski’s potency in front of goal and capped off an excellent performance.\n\nArsenal’s win saw them finish the group stages on a high note, albeit just short of topping their group due to Borussia Dortmund winning their simultaneous fixture. Nonetheless, Wenger could take immense satisfaction from the comprehensive performance his team had put in. They had not only secured a comfortable win against a storied European side but had done so in style, demonstrating the attacking verve and solidity that would need to be the hallmark of their campaign going forward.\n\nFrom the clinical finishes of Podolski and Ramsey to the youthful exuberance of Bellerin and Zelalem, Arsenal's mix of experience and youth flourished on the night. Ramsey's stunning volley, in particular, would be remembered as one of the highlights of the Champions League this season.\n\nDespite some disarray in their season, this match showed the potential within Wenger's squad when they are allowed to play with freedom and confidence. With the knockout stages on the horizon, the Arsenal faithful could dare to dream again, inspired by this glittering performance under the Istanbul lights."
