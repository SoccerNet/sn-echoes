up.\n21:43 Comment: Of course it was okay there.\n21:45 Comment: In the Portuguese league.\n21:47 Comment: They have an average of well over 40,000.\n21:51 Comment: In the Champions League there are a full 10,000 fewer.\n21:54 Comment: And that is certainly not only due to the away fans, but also simply because many Portuguese people simply cannot afford it.\n22:2 Comment: Artur's excursion is not punished, but at least there is a corner.\n22:17 Comment: The second for Bayer.\n22:24 Comment: Olfes.\n22:26 Comment: That was really well received, Artur.\n22:31 Comment: There wasn't enough power in the header for him to have to follow up.\n22:34 Comment: He has to anyway, but here comes Olfes.\n22:37 Comment: And if he hits him with his forehead instead of his shoulder, then Artur will have some bigger problems to solve.\n22:47 Comment: The Lay.\n23:6 Comment: They solved that well again, but then there is Spaj.\n23:17 Comment: There she goes.\n23:27 Comment: Almeida and Thiago.\n23:31 Comment: Against two men.\n23:33 Comment: This goes a little too easily past Bönisch and Bellarabi.\n23:39 Comment: Because he's been playing on the left side for a few more minutes now.\n23:43 Comment: So he seems to be on the team with Robby Kroos after all...\n23:46 Comment: Duration of changing sides.\n23:55 Comment: Rätzi.\n23:57 Comment: It's going to be very tight now.\n23:59 Comment:

Nevertheless, next corner for Benfica.\n27:10 Comment: If you see Moulagion on the left,\n27:20 Comment: This leads to two questions.\n27:21 Comment: What happened in Hamburg with that\n27:23 Comment: where one has not seen him play in this form.\n27:27 Comment: In a complicated situation.\n27:29 Comment: What does Benfica want with Marcel Jansen?\n27:33 Comment: The rumor came up today.\n27:34 Comment: That was in the Portuguese daily newspaper.\n27:36 Comment: That people are very interested in that.\n27:37 Comment: Possibly already during the winter break.\n27:39 Comment: But Moulagion is not a regular player on the left side.\n27:47 Comment: There are a few others,\n27:49 Comment: which have so far been preferred by Jorge Jesus.\n27:53 Comment: When you see him acting like this here.\n27:55 Comment: There must still be a lot up his sleeve.\n27:58 Comment: Where does Marcel Jansen fit in?\n28:0 Comment: I don't have to solve this.\n28:1 Comment: Those responsible here have to solve this.\n28:3 Comment: Maybe there is nothing to this story at all.\n28:9 Comment: We at least asked the Benfica officials.\n28:17 Comment: And they didn't want to comment on it in any way.\n28:21 Comment: And you now have the evening to interpret it or leave it alone.\n28:32 Comment: Frequently.\n28:34 Comment: That is not enough.\n28:35 Comment: For nothing.\n28:37 Comment: Except for a corner.\n28:38 Comment: But he also had...\n28:39 Comment: He doesn't have much to do there either.\n28:41 Comment: It's good that Leverkusen is at the front again.\n29:5 Comment: Completely different variant.\n29:6 Comment: Castro.\n29:9 Comment: Consistency.\n29:16 Comment: Realization.\n29:17 Comment: 1.\n29:21 Comment: 2.\n29:21 Comment: 3.\n29:23 Comment: Goal by Alderweireld.\n29:25 Comment:

There's already a bit too much.\n30:11 Comment: That's a good thing.\n30:19 Comment: Now let’s take a closer look at Hilbert.\n30:23 Comment: Good this way.\n30:27 Comment: And there too,\n30:29 Comment: and also there,\n30:33 Comment: networked.\n30:35 Comment: Robbie Cruz vs Almeida.\n30:37 Comment: He almost stumbled there.\n30:41 Comment: This is unpleasant again.\n30:45 Comment: Hilbert loses the ball.\n30:49 Comment: This left side works really well.\n30:53 Comment: And if Olajon plays the ball earlier,\n30:55 Comment: then it becomes even more dangerous.\n30:57 Comment: Then it becomes even more dangerous.\n30:59 Comment: He lost track of the playback.\n31:3 Comment: And now he's really getting a beating from Dele.\n31:7 Comment: Quite rightly so.\n31:11 Comment: That was like Sandro Lopez,\n31:13 Comment: who then didn't let him go.\n31:15 Comment: Who then didn't let him go.\n31:17 Comment: With everything that was still possible.\n31:19 Comment: The hands were out there, but...\n31:23 Comment: Nothing is enough\n31:25 Comment: for a penalty,\n31:27 Comment: although he is already pretty serious about it\n31:29 Comment: against Drimic.\n31:35 Comment: Now the next Leverkusen player\n31:37 Comment: fully.\n31:39 Comment: Due.\n31:41 Comment: Even though Toprak complains,\n31:43 Comment: that he was there in the header duel...\n31:45 Comment: Header duel, what am I saying...\n31:49 Comment: Was hit in a ground duel.\n31:53 Comment: But that he holds on to Dele,\n31:55 Comment: is of course undisputed.\n31:57 Comment: And he's just trying to break free somehow.\n32:1 Comment: So, even if it hurts Toprak.\n32:3 Comment: Assault?\n32:5 Comment: No.\n32:7 Comment: Yellow? Yes.\n32:23 Comment: Again played well and smoothly.\n32:25 Comment: And now Bellarabi is hanging\n32:29 Comment: on his opponent.\n32:31 Comment: And if Kulbakov\n32:33 Comment: and if Kulbakov\n32:35 Comment: as he now continues his line,\n32:37 Comment: then it is actually due.\n32:43 Comment: At the moment, however,\n32:45 Comment: doesn't look like that yet.\n32:47 Comment: But that they can all play football really well,\n32:49 Comment: What happened in the first leg\n32:51 Comment: rather not seen at all,\n32:53 Comment: or only sporadically,\n32:55 Comment: we get that here today\n32:57 Comment: presented.\n32:59 Comment: In the first 30 minutes or so.\n33:3 Comment: There are now 33.\n33:5 Comment: In a strong initial phase.\n33:9 Comment: Hart-Leverkusen is approved,\n33:11 Comment: that Benfica really came into play here.\n33:15 Comment: While Leno had to\n33:19 Comment: not more often than in this scene\n33:23 Comment: intervene with Olajon and Lima.\n33:25 Comment: But what is not, can still become.\n33:27 Comment: While now 30 meters\n33:31 Comment: between him and the ball.\n33:35 Comment: And that was a Cristiano Ronaldo attempt,\n33:39 Comment: the way Thiago ran there.\n33:43 Comment: Also Portuguese, 24 years old,\n33:47 Comment: came from Manchester United in the summer.\n33:51 Comment: Manchester United has now this year\n33:55 Comment: nothing to do with the Champions League.\n33:59 Comment: But FC Bayern,\n34:1 Comment: nothing to do with the Champions League.\n34:5 Comment: And that is what is so important today.\n34:9 Comment: And many others too.\n34:13 Comment: Bayern against Moscow.\n34:17 Comment: And of course Schalke at Maribor.\n34:19 Comment: And we all keep our fingers crossed.\n34:23 Comment: At least I do that,\n34:25 Comment: that Schalke might still succeed,\n34:27 Comment: to advance to the round of 16.\n34:31 Comment: A much-sung-about one in this first half of the season.\n34:35 Comment: Karim Bellarabi is also quite right,\n34:37 Comment: because it is at a consistently high level\n34:39 Comment: radiates danger.\n34:41 Comment: Leverkusen's best goalscorer this season\n34:43 Comment: is in the league with seven goals.\n34:47 Comment: But overall it is much\n34:49 Comment: near Leverkusen.\n34:51 Comment: In the beginning, it often seemed a bit\n34:55 Comment: Can be improved in terms of balance.\n34:59 Comment: But now it is a good idea\n35:1 Comment: that it is a good idea\n35:3 Comment: that it will be a nice game.\n35:7 Comment: But that is the case now,\n35:9 Comment: that it is likely\n35:11 Comment: is a good idea,\n35:13 Comment: that it is a bit\n35:15 Comment: a little bit\n35:21 Comment: is a good idea.\n35:25 Comment: The action is fine.\n35:27 Comment: Christiane.\n35:35 Comment: For the action here.\n35:37 Comment: Quite rightly so.\n35:39 Comment: A quick thought again about Roger Schmidt.\n35:42 Comment: He says,\n35:44 Comment: Chalanolu, Bellarabi, Son and Kießling up front.\n35:47 Comment: In the early stages of the season.\n35:49 Comment: They made the headlines.\n35:51 Comment: What also makes me very happy,\n35:53 Comment: that they worked into the ball.\n35:55 Comment: The central defence with Toprak\n35:57 Comment: has increased continuously.\n35:59 Comment: The interaction between Gonzalo Castro,\n36:1 Comment: whether he was injured, Rolfes, Reinhards, Bender.\n36:3 Comment: Even though he was injured.\n36:5 Comment: All of this has become more and more clear-cut over the course of the first half of the season.\n36:8 Comment: And not least because of this.\n36:10 Comment: Leverkusen has the 4th best defense in the Bundesliga.\n36:12 Comment: And in the Champions League.\n36:14 Comment: The fewest

Luisandro Lopez was moving his arm.\n37:13 Comment: You losers.\n37:14 Comment: And then gets the free kick...\n37:17 Comment: It's always a story like that.\n37:19 Comment: DH ZSALAN technology is trying to get the ball.\n37:22 Comment: and like Sandro Lopez comes from behind and presses him in the back.\n37:26 Comment: So I whistled the other way around, but Kulberkow decides and not me.\n37:43 Comment: Rolfes.\n37:52 Comment: But again a questioning look from Toprak towards the referee,\n38:3 Comment: because the lay worked with his arm backwards.\n38:10 Comment: Lima.\n38:19 Comment: Caesar.\n38:22 Comment: Rolfes.\n38:28 Comment: Chalanolo.\n38:31 Comment: There is no one outside here.\n38:33 Comment: And then he breaks off.\n38:37 Comment: Good opening by

good.\n42:20 Comment: But that's what we see.\n42:23 Comment: This is what we see.\n42:26 Comment: The ball was not in play.\n42:29 Comment: Maybe in the end.\n42:32 Comment: But he has already reached that point.\n42:36 Comment: Leno realized early on that he didn’t have to go there.\n42:41 Comment: I think that was Thiago.\n42:43 Comment: This is what you cannot see.\n42:52 Comment: He

first by Josep Drimic.\n44:12 Comment: Who, of course, has a hard time against Lisandro Lopez and against Cesar.\n44:19 Comment: Here he comes to the conclusion, it is too central.\n44:23 Comment: But otherwise he has few options because both Bellarabi on the outside and Kroos on the outside are not doing enough.\n44:33 Comment: And Schalan Nolo is well handled by Benfica.\n44:36 Comment: And Leverkusen just has difficulties in opening the game.\n44:43 Comment: That's why there are hardly any opportunities in the first half.\n44:52 Comment: Let’s end this part now.\n44:54 Comment: So I wouldn't be surprised if Kolbarkov gets there right on time.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Bayer in black from right to left with Chalanolu, otherwise unchanged\n0:6 Comment: Bellarabi in the direction of Julian Brandt, so a jumpy start to this second half\n0:16 Comment: We saw that an hour ago, too, that Bayer came into the game well here\n0:21 Comment: and then suddenly after about 10 minutes something was missing in the game\n0:28 Comment: against the ball, but also in the game with the ball, there is Julian Brandt, who first appears on the left side\n0:33 Comment: Bellarabi right, Trimic central\n0:37 Comment: Brandt is also one of those who have been out for a few weeks during the first half of the season\n0:49 Comment: suffered a torn ligament, lost his rhythm and had little playing time\n0:55 Comment: and can now compete in the second round\n0:57 Comment: move\n0:58 Comment: and I can also recommend that for the remaining games of this first half of the

Comment: Groenish\n1:34 Comment: Hilbert\n1:41 Comment: Castro\n1:45 Comment: Bellarabi\n1:57 Comment: The idea was good, but the pass to Schalanolu was too inaccurate\n2:15 Comment: Performing with fun, joy, enthusiasm for the game and still showing consistency, that was Roger Schmidt's goal before this game\n2:25 Comment: That was Roger Schmidt’s instructions before this game\n2:26 Comment: So the desire, joy, even the joy of running, we had that at Bayer 04 in the first half, then he didn't see it that way at the end\n2:38 Comment: Drilic’s start brings at least a few meters of space and the throw-in from Bönisch\n3:12 Comment: Shalanolu\n3:22 Comment: This was not a good solution from Arthur Bayer in possession of the ball\n3:34 Comment: Thiago still gets the ball, but Bönisch is alert\n3:46 Comment: Brandt\n3:50 Comment: Bönisch has the good acceleration and speed to then cause some confusion in the defense at Benfica\n4:2 Comment: Bela Rabi not offside\n4:4 Comment:

reason.\n5:13 Comment: Outside of Benfica, Leverkusen have scored in the first half\n5:16 Comment: a good opportunity.\n5:18 Comment: That's a good ball.\n5:44 Comment: Two balls on the field.\n5:47 Comment: That's a good ball.\n5:53 Comment: Hilbert’s comment again.\n5:57 Comment: First goal.\n6:1 Comment: Trimic's idea was to use fire.\n6:10 Comment: By the way, he was born in the region, in the greater Lisbon area.\n6:16 Comment: He is a father.\n6:19 Comment: He was also a professional, but at Sporting.\n6:22 Comment: But that didn’t stop anyone at Benfica from\n6:25 Comment: to hire him as head coach in 2009.\n6:28 Comment: With great success.\n6:30 Comment: Jorge Jesus won 8 titles with Benfica.\n6:38 Comment: Trimic.\n6:40 Comment: He makes it more complicated than

Netherlands.\n8:27 Comment: Almeida.\n8:36 Comment: It runs out in times.\n8:40 Comment: He would have to end up at Leverkusen.\n8:42 Comment: That's how it is.\n8:44 Comment: With loss.\n8:48 Comment: Yes, that was the\n8:53 Comment: I canrix and Rhindse\n9:1 Comment: not utilize.\n9:6 Comment: It is Ise Sebu who passed away.\n9:11 Comment: That's a very good point.\n9:14 Comment: Both teams won the European Cup.\n9:18 Comment: Because he is such a big idol,\n9:21 Comment: Even after decades they still wear in his honor\n9:25 Comment: until next January 5th this mourning ribbon.\n9:28 Comment: Here in front of the stadium, by the way,\n9:31 Comment: there is a statue.\n9:33 Comment: There are hundreds of devotional items there.\n9:36 Comment: From scarves to photography.\n9:38 Comment: The two have indeed\n9:41 Comment: with their own enemies.\n9:44 Comment: This is how Eusebio is venerated here.\n9:57 Comment: My descendants,\n9:59 Comment: not personal descendants,\n10:2 Comment: but those who wear the jersey with the eagle on it,\n10:6 Comment: did not make it,\n10:8 Comment: because it's the Eureka games.\n10:11 Comment: This is a major drawback,\n10:13 Comment: what Benfica has been carrying with it through the decades.\n10:17 Comment: Reached finals again and again,\n10:19 Comment: whether in the national championship competition\n10:21 Comment: or Champions League or Europa League.\n10:24 Comment: Again and again it wasn't enough.\n10:27 Comment: Which brings us to the topic of the Bela Gutmann curse.\n10:30 Comment: Bela Gutmann, coach here at Benfica in the early 1960s,\n10:34 Comment: responsible for these great successes with Eusebio.\n10:38 Comment: He demanded a salary increase,\n10:41 Comment: which was not granted to him.\n10:43 Comment: He went in anger and said,\n10:45 Comment: you will not win anything internationally for the next 100 years.\n10:49 Comment: So far he has been right.\n10:52 Comment: Whoever wins the Champions League this season,\n10:55 Comment: there are easier questions to answer.\n10:58 Comment: Now let’s see what happens with the draw.\n11:1 Comment: You can watch this live from us next Monday.\n11:4 Comment: Kai Dittmann will accompany you there.\n11:6 Comment: If you dare to take a little look ahead.\n11:9 Comment: In any case, this will be a very difficult task for Bayer Leverkusen.\n11:13 Comment: Whether group winner or group runner-up.\n11:16 Comment: There are so many good ones in there.\n11:21 Comment: At the moment Leverkusen is still first in the group.\n11:24 Comment: 0 to 0.\n11:27 Comment: It is still in the other position.\n11:30 Comment: But participation is not yet that good.\n11:32 Comment: It's not that good yet.\n11:35 Comment: But it's not that good yet.\n11:38 Comment: 0 to 0.\n11:41 Comment: It is still in the other position.\n11:44 Comment: It's not that good yet.\n11:47 Comment: But if you look at what is happening in the Champions League\n11:51 Comment: and what's going on with the group runners-up.\n11:54 Comment: Barcelona could come.\n11:57 Comment: Arsenal FC could come here.\n11:59 Comment: Manchester City.\n12:1 Comment: Liverpool.\n12:3 Comment: Liverpool were still in business before this matchday.\n12:7 Comment: Juventus Turin.\n12:11 Comment: I wanted to talk to Rudi Völler yesterday.\n12:15 Comment: I'll tell you right away what he said.\n12:18 Comment: Now comes Hilbert.\n12:20 Comment: Goal kick.\n12:22 Comment: Leverkusen claims a corner.\n12:25 Comment: Doesn't exist.\n12:27 Comment: Rudi Völler stood there yesterday at the final training and said,\n12:29 Comment: he wouldn't have won it.\n12:31 Comment: He didn't win it.\n12:33 Comment: It does matter whether you win or finish second in your group.\n12:37 Comment: But when I look at what is still going on there\n12:41 Comment: and what could happen to us as group winners,\n12:45 Comment: then there have certainly been years\n12:48 Comment: where it was more attractive to come first.\n12:51 Comment: Nevertheless, Leverkusen wants that.\n12:54 Comment: At the beginning of this second half, it looks more like that again.\n12:57 Comment: It is a typical example of\n13:0 Comment: which didn't go well in the first half either.\n13:3 Comment: A good duel from Boenisch.\n13:6 Comment: And then a passport comes out of it,\n13:9 Comment: which Bellarabi simply cannot control.\n13:12 Comment: Gate Park.\n13:14 Comment: That's a good tackle from Boenisch.\n13:17 Comment: And then a passport comes out of it,\n13:20 Comment: which Bellarabi simply cannot control.\n13:23 Comment: Gate Park.\n13:27 Comment: And then a passport comes out of it,\n13:30 Comment: which Bellarabi simply cannot control.\n13:33 Comment: Gate Park.\n14:11 Comment: Thiago-san.\n14:14 Comment: Bellarabi against Thiago.\n14:16 Comment: That was a very good ball.\n14:23 Comment: He welcomed him mightily.\n14:35 Comment: Bellarabi for the second time.\n14:38 Comment: It's a serious conversation.\n14:46 Comment: It's a pretty good ball.\n14:50 Comment: Shala Nolo.\n15:14 Comment: Benfica is ready.\n15:16

it.\n17:16 Comment: Bellarabi.\n17:18 Comment: Caglanolo.\n17:20 Comment: It is too complicated.\n17:22 Comment: Brandt has made the space smaller.\n17:25 Comment: He ran in from outside.\n17:27 Comment: And then Drimic almost stood on his foot.\n17:30 Comment: This is how Leverkusen is discovered.\n17:32 Comment: It's not so easy back there.\n17:34 Comment: Now comes a ball.\n17:36 Comment: A resistance.\n17:38 Comment: This is how Leverkusen\n17:40 Comment: not drive it into dissolution.\n18:4 Comment: Existed.\n18:28 Comment: Luzandra Lopez.\n18:34 Comment: Here would have been an opportunity to really cause confusion with something quick.\n18:38 Comment: But Toprak had no opportunity to play forward any faster.\n18:46 Comment: It also has to do with a bit of freshness, which may be missing in some people.\n18:50 Comment: Bellarabi's cross.\n19:1 Comment: And Eintracht Braunschweig.\n19:2 Comment: Come on, put the game into practice.\n19:4 Comment: This is a very good game.\n19:4 Comment: He was supposed to collect it.\n19:6 Comment: Then he returned to Leverkusen in a system where the new coach saw many, many opportunities for him.\n19:13 Comment: Over the summer, during the preparations, he managed to take on a lot of what Holger Schmidt wanted from him.\n19:20 Comment: Feels incredibly comfortable in this very offensive system, which also focuses on playing against the ball.\n19:30 Comment: But it requires a lot of willingness to run.\n19:34 Comment: Lots of mental freshness.\n19:38 Comment: And for a young player who is not yet used to this rhythm every three or four days and then also with the national team, which Bellarabi also managed.\n19:47 Comment: It's tough.\n19:48 Comment: There he is again.\n19:49 Comment: On the left side now.\n19:51 Comment: And now?\n19:53 Comment: What now?\n19:54 Comment: Rolfes.\n19:58 Comment: Bellarabi again.\n19:59 Comment: Rolfes.\n20:11 Comment: Monaco leads against St. Petersburg.\n20:19 Comment: This shifts the balance in this group to Bayern’s disadvantage.\n20:26 Comment: Currently only second in the group.\n20:30 Comment: Monaco 11 points, Leverkusen 10.\n20:34 Comment: If Leverkusen wins here, Monaco can fight as hard as it wants.\n20:39 Comment: But Bayer is still one goal away from achieving this.\n20:57 Comment: Or already?\n21:0 Comment: Pizza.\n21:4 Comment: Oh, Sparge right at Olajon's feet and he starts dribbling again.\n21:15 Comment: It almost looked to me as if the ball had already been out.\n21:18 Comment: But if I interpret the gesture correctly, then Jorge Gildos also asks himself,\n21:24 Comment: Why not try scoring a goal at some point.\n21:32 Comment: Adesat.\n21:34 Comment: Olajon.\n21:38 Comment: Fifth back ball from Leno.\n21:41 Comment: Sovereign.\n21:52 Comment: Getting the ball to the target quickly is also difficult.\n21:57 Comment: So even after 20 minutes in this second half\n22:2 Comment: Leverkusen is not able to consistently register in the game.\n22:9 Comment: Every now and then it flashes up, at the beginning of each half.\n22:15 Comment: But that sustainability would have been played on Arthur’s goal,\n22:20 Comment: with sufficient accuracy, that is not the case.\n22:28 Comment: Brandt.\n22:32 Comment: That was better.\n22:34 Comment: Castro.\n22:35 Comment: Support is available now too.\n22:37 Comment: Hilbert is coming.\n22:44 Comment: Toprak.\n22:47 Comment: That was not a good idea.\n22:54 Comment: Breley.\n22:56 Comment: Olajon.\n22:58 Comment: Bönisch.\n23:0 Comment: It was important that he got it.\n23:2 Comment: Olajon.\n23:2 Comment: And Gonzalo Castro must have hurt himself badly.\n23:8 Comment: Immediately indicated that he needed help.\n23:16 Comment: Ulbarkov is now making inquiries.\n23:19 Comment: That is the situation.\n23:22 Comment: So it was a lot of risky hitting the ball from behind.\n23:26 Comment: Christante but then in the final phase also Gonzalo Castro.\n23:32 Comment: And now he's coming back to the gate.\n23:34 Comment: Who resists, but now.\n23:36 Comment: Yes.\n23:44 Comment: Is it even standing?\n23:45 Comment: I am not looking at Jorge Gisdus or Burka Schmidt,\n23:50 Comment: but beyond the monitor, what is going on with Gonzalo Castro.\n23:53 Comment: Now he has recovered enough that he can at least trot off the field on his own.\n24:2 Comment: Training studies are all well and good.\n24:4 Comment: We have no influence over that now.\n24:5 Comment: What is more important for Leverkusen now is whether things can continue with Gonzalo Castro or not.\n24:14 Comment: So for the moment it looks better than I first thought.\n24:19 Comment: Has he already recovered from his injuries this season?\n24:25 Comment: Muscle fiber is a stubborn one.\n24:27 Comment: That was what made him happy for a few weeks on the sidelines.\n25:2 Comment: But then it also depends on accuracy.\n25:5 Comment: And now there is the next change.\n25:10 Comment: Sip Trimic goes down.\n25:14 Comment: What should one do with this appearance now?\n25:18 Comment: He himself certainly hoped that it would be enough for more than a frown.\n25:24 Comment: So the question is, can the Kiesling then also displace it, yes or no.\n25:28 Comment: There are obviously fans of Son everywhere.\n25:32 Comment: But it wasn’t Kiesling who came, but Neumann Son.\n25:42 Comment: Now out on the left, Bellarabi is central.\n25:46 Comment: But that will surely mix up nicely over the next few minutes.\n25:50 Comment: Sun.\n25:52 Comment: Offside Bellarabi.\n25:54 Comment: It is the wrong decision to send him into the sprint again over such a short distance.\n25:58 Comment: That can't happen.\n25:59 Comment: And.\n26:2 Comment: Such.\n26:5 Comment: Decisions.\n26:6 Comment: There is just not enough space for him to really pick up speed again,\n26:9 Comment: the ball comes there in time.\n26:11 Comment: decision of this kind.\n26:13 Comment: Leverkusen made a wrong decision in their attacking game.\n26:16 Comment: That's when things get really interesting.\n26:18 Comment: Hit too often.\n26:32 Comment: There was Jarno.\n26:33 Comment: Lisa.\n26:35 Comment: At that time Avi screening with first time usando.\n26:40 Comment: Qadar is a member of Beleah Falters.\n26:46 Comment: Now at the moment still

Let's look at the end of this action.\n27:19 Comment: Taliska Spahic scores.\n27:23 Comment: Unhappy.\n27:32 Comment: That's a good ball.\n27:36 Comment: He has a good ball.\n27:44 Comment: He is trying to position a real traditional club.\n27:48 Comment: In Portugal they are top.\n27:52 Comment: Just like Leverkusen.\n27:56 Comment: Founded in 1904.\n28:0 Comment: 33 times Portuguese

    "summary": "In a match devoid of goals, Benfica and Bayer Leverkusen came face to face in the first leg of the Champions League round of 16. The game, played at Benfica’s Estádio da Luz, was a keenly contested affair, with both teams giving their all but ultimately ending in a 0-0 draw. From the very beginning, it was clear that both teams were determined to assert their authority and dominate the proceedings, albeit without yielding the desired result.\n\nThe match began with Benfica and Bayer Leverkusen keen on showcasing their intent. Benfica started the game with a notable comment regarding their aspiration: \"In the round of 16, but we want to be in first place. That requires commitment and enthusiasm.\" This statement set the tone for their approach throughout the game. Bayer Leverkusen, meanwhile, donned their classic all-black kit for the first half and kicked off in their typical dynamic style, moving from left to right.\n\nEarly in the game, Leverkusen’s Bönisch provided a good ball, highlighting the visitors' early offensive mindset. As the match progressed, Leverkusen’s strategy became evident with their central defenders, Spahic and Toprak, frequently moving forward, even into Benfica’s half, indicating their aggressive approach. Despite these forward surges, Leverkusen remained disciplined defensively, as characterized by Rolfes’s steady presence in midfield.\n\nBenfica, under the experienced guidance of Jorge Jesus, who has been their head coach for six years, were keen to silence critics who lamented their quiet exit from the group stage. The juxtaposition of the two clubs’ mental states was stark; while Benfica faced internal dissatisfaction, Leverkusen appeared confident and content, even though their participation in the round of 16 had already been confirmed well before the fifth game.\n\nThe first half was characterized by several notable plays and exchanges. Missteps like Hilfert’s bad pass and duels such as the one involving Ola Jon showcased the ebb and flow of control between the two teams. Leverkusen experienced moments of offensive flair interrupted by Benfica’s solid defensive efforts. Notably, an impressive tackle from Castro demonstrated Leverkusen’s determination to regain possession. Various players like Kopac, Spahic, and Rolfes played pivotal roles in maintaining Leverkusen’s structure.\n\nThe night saw a spectacle unfolding under the Lisbon sky, with Leverkusen attacking yet also facing tactical fouls, such as the one on Derley. Benfica, despite several attempts, struggled to break through Leverkusen’s disciplined backline. One significant occurrence was downtime used by Jorge Jesus to make crucial tactical decisions, underscoring the importance of strategic adjustments in such a high-stakes game.\n\nAs the clock ticked toward halftime, Benfica’s offensive drives, including a noteworthy challenge from Lima, failed to yield goals. An unfortunate miss from Lima, who found himself unable to convert a close-range opportunity, marked a frustrating culmination of seemingly promising attempts. The resolve to keep out goals was reciprocated by Leverkusen's defensive strategies, including the notable consistency of their backline.\n\nMeanwhile, Leverkusen's efforts were reflected in the energy and speed they brought into their offensive moves. They frequently attempted to outpace Benfica’s defense, with moves led by figures like Bellarabi and Chalanolu. Yet, despite these efforts, the accuracy and final touches often fell short, preventing the breaking of the deadlock.\n\nThe halftime break offered little respite, as the game’s intensity only escalated in the second half. Both teams returned to the pitch with Bayer Leverkusen continuing their black attire but now attacking from right to left. As the second half unfolded, Brandt, who had been out due to injury earlier in the season, made an immediate impact by appearing on the left wing. His inclusion alongside Bellarabi and Trimic indicated a shift towards a more aggressive posture by Leverkusen.\n\nEarly in the second half, Leverkusen sought to capitalise on Benfica’s occasional lapses. Bellarabi and Brandt, moving fluidly between wings and central positions, consistently tested Benfica’s defensive resolve. Such attempts generated moments of uncertainty within Benfica’s ranks, but the elusive breakthrough remained outside their grasp. Drilic’s movements created some space, although ensuing efforts did not culminate in any firm scoring opportunities.\n\nRoger Schmidt’s Leverkusen emphasized maintaining enthusiasm and consistency, traits visibly lacking as the game progressed into the second half. An indication of Leverkusen’s tactical troubles was seen when Arthur Bayer’s possession mishandles presented intermittent openings to Benfica. Despite this, Benfica could not exploit these moments adequately, with only sporadic threats emerging from their offense.\n\nThe clash maintained its tactical intensity, highlighted by strong defensive stands, such as Hilbert's robust duels and Castros checking runs. Benfica's offence, led by Olajon and supported by the likes of Almeida, had glimmers of creativity but regularly faltered in delivering that final decisive pass or shot.\n\nThe struggle for dominance continued unabated with players consistently engaging in gritty battles across the midfield and defensive thirds. Balls into the box often resulted in contested headers and crowded blocks, with chances popping up frequently, yet conversion remaining elusive. Both sides showcased commendable physicality and tactical discipline but equally displayed deficiencies in breaking the deadlock.\n\nOne of the most intense moments in the second half saw Bellarabi in a duel against Thiago, reflecting both the persistent and contentious nature of the game. Insertions and substitutions like that of Anderson Taliska for Benfica tried to freshen up the ranks and rekindle offensive efforts but met with stout resistance from Leverkusen, mirroring the deadlocked nature of the game.\n\nDespite such efforts, both teams remained locked in a tactical stalemate. Determined counter-presses and strategic positioning were evident with quick transitions often highlighting the lapses and defensive recoveries from both sides. Significant moves like those from Boenisch and the noteworthy efforts of Bellarabi further punctuated these periods but ultimately did not alter the scoreboard.\n\nAs the match drew closer to its end, players like Hilbert and Taliska continued to be the focal points of their team’s attempts. Leverkusen managed to keep the clean sheet intact, with Arnold's solid performance between the sticks and defensive stability proving crucial.\n\nThe closing stages of the match were marked by intensified efforts from Benfica, pushing for that elusive goal. Thiago's attempts on goal were frustrated by timed blocks and the swift recoveries of Leverkusen's backline.\n\nMoreover, a pivotal incident saw Toprak receiving a second yellow and thus a red card, a disadvantage that could have tipped the balance but for the timing towards match end. This incident exemplified the rough, stop-start nature of the contest where moments of indiscipline punctuated the tactical battles on the field.\n\nDespite a valiant push from both ends towards the game’s conclusion, neither side managed to find the back of the net. Benfica's frustrations were palpable as key opportunities slipped away, reflective of their overall European campaign’s pain points.\n\nLeverkusen’s persistence in their defensive and sporadic offensive surges highlighted their ability to adapt under high pressure but also their need for sharper offensive output. As the final whistle blew, the scoreline of 0-0 remained, a testament to both teams' solid defensive tactics but also their offensive inefficiencies on this crucial European night.\n\nIn summary, the match was a detailed chess game of tactical maneuvers, pressing battles, critical saves, and crucial misfires. Both Benfica and Leverkusen had moments of near breakthroughs but lacked that final quality needed to clinch the win. The second leg promises much more as both sides will look to rectify their offensive shortcomings while holding firm defensively. As the draw looms, the anticipation only grows for what could be a decisive finish in the return fixture."
