    "summary": "The match between Bayer Leverkusen and AtlÃ©tico Madrid started off on a cautious note, with both teams evidently trying to ease into the game. AtlÃ©tico Madrid got things underway with the kick-off, but the initial few minutes were mostly characterized by throw-ins and clearances. Bayer Leverkusen appeared slightly more aggressive in the initial 10 minutes, pressing forward and attempting to disrupt AtlÃ©tico's gameplay.\n\nAt 11 minutes into the game, Bayer Leverkusen had their first real opportunity when Heung-Min Son delivered a sweet cross into the box, which Hakan Calhanoglu attempted to convert. However, AtlÃ©tico's defense was vigilant, managing to intercept the ball. Just moments later, Calhanoglu sent another lovely cross into the penalty area, but once again, the visitors' defense cleared it brilliantly, resulting in a corner for Bayer Leverkusen. Calhanoglu took the corner but overhit it, and none of his teammates could capitalize on it.\n\nA significant moment came at the 13-minute mark when Emir Spahic unleashed a quick strike towards the bottom right corner inside the penalty area. Despite beating the goalkeeper, one of the AtlÃ©tico defenders performed a crucial goal-line clearance, denying Bayer Leverkusen the opening goal. This raised the intensity on the field, and Bayer Leverkusen continued to apply pressure with successive throw-ins and crosses, but AtlÃ©tico's defense held firm.\n\nAt around the 15th minute, Josip DrmiÄ‡ of Bayer Leverkusen was first to the rebound and sent a goalward header, which was blocked, creating a significant escape for AtlÃ©tico. Shortly after, Gonzalo Castroâ€™s sliding tackle on an opponent drew the referee's attention, resulting in a caution but no card.\n\nThe game saw its first booking at the 22nd minute when Tiago of AtlÃ©tico Madrid was cautioned for a foul committed earlier. The match then paused briefly when Saul of AtlÃ©tico picked up a knock, necessitating the physio's intrusion to check on him. Bayer Leverkusen continued to dominate possession. Hakan Calhanoglu expertly delivered a long pass to Heung-Min Son, who advanced menacingly before Emir Spahic unleashed a long-range shot that rattled the crossbar. This momentum kept the home fans on their toes.\n\nAtlÃ©tico's attack could not stay idle as they responded with attempts of their own. Antoine Griezmann floated in crosses, and Diego Godin attempted a shot from the edge but failed to slice through Bayer Leverkusenâ€™s well-guarded lines. The halftime saw multiple interruptions with various fouls and free-kicks managed by both teams but no significant threats materialized.
