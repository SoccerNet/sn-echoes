Very good Turkish there.\n12:25 Comment: Mario Mansu cleared the ball, which Moyá had probably also taken, but the Croatian did very well to get it out from under the sticks.\n12:32 Comment: And yet I get the feeling that Cholo is scolding him for perhaps not having cleared that ball in the corner kick previously with a header.\n12:40 Comment: And he was taking the piss out of Manchuco and it seemed like he didn't understand anything, right?

She has taken a blow in painful territory.\n13:42 Comment: Arda recovers little by little when she goes to take Wendel out.\n13:55 Comment: Dermis playing behind on Belarabi. Belarabi who accompanies the ball playing on the side.\n13:59 Comment: Pay attention to Hilbert's exit there.\n14:2 Comment: Bender. Brena Saúl. Shipping to the half moon. Tiago has played. Bender again. Tiago to the jump.\n14:9 Comment: Ball again to Bender. Saul's anticipation. Good help from Mansuquich to get the ball towards the wing.\n14:16 Comment: Atlético de Madrid. Burn Turán. Arda tries to leave. From the ground he wants to recover.\n14:22 Comment: And it says online that the ball is for Bayern Leverkusen.\n14:25 Comment: Spites.\n14:32 Comment: Castro. He asks Bender out. Opening towards the band. Gonzalo Castro receives again and plays inside.\n14:39 Comment: Parason. Wall attempt. Clear Miranda. The ball goes directly out and Bayern Leverkusen will serve again from the side.\n14:54 Comment: For my taste, Michael comes to Atlético de Madrid in defensive tasks but he still needs to handle the ball.\n15:0 Comment: Well, what he's doing now is visiting.\n15:2 Comment: To say that it is loose. She has played Siqueira. Tiago. Ball to the half moon. Clear Saúl. Now yes. Difficulties in the Atlético de Madrid area.\n15:13 Comment: Yes, he has to be resisting for the moment. She's not playing anything. Nothing. He has not made a single play with five passes.\n15:21 Comment: Man, we're not seeing any cracks either. We've seen that last play, right? But I'm not really liking how Atlético de Madrid is playing.\n15:29 Comment: What he is doing is slowing down the countered team.\n15:32 Comment: On the contrary, they will get in the way for a while and not make it easy for the locals. But Atlético de Madrid is more of a team than that.\n15:39 Comment: That's what I meant, right? That he has probably come away with the lesson well learned of being solid and not conceding.\n15:46 Comment: And at the moment he is so dedicated to that role that until now he has not achieved Atlético's usual game with danger on the opposite goal.\n15:54 Comment: What a kick Gaby took there from Gonzalo Castro in the dispute with the ball.\n15:59 Comment: Well, the banal offensive game is not...\n16:2 Comment: The banal is not eliminating any game. That is to say, he was not even preparing the play in the center of the field.\n16:6 Comment: The thing is, no, I don't like Atlético de Madrid with the ball. Without the ball he is doing well, well. Good.\n16:13 Comment: The first quarter of an hour has already passed. We are in the 16th minute of the match when Atlético de Madrid is going to serve through Miranda.\n16:20 Comment: And they're not going to eliminate it right now, right?\n16:23 Comment: There goes the shot up looking for Mansukic. He has won the ball with his head. He wants to protect her from Wendel. She does it.\n16:30 Comment: The throw-in for...\n16:32 Comment: Bayern Leverkusen.\n16:33 Comment: Atlético de Madrid is going to try to lock him down, corner Bayern.\n16:40 Comment: Gonzalo Castro above. Look, there is no option because the ball has gone out.\n16:45 Comment: Now the throw-in for Atlético.\n16:49 Comment: Juanfran will take out.\n16:55 Comment: Juanfran is going to take out. He does it short on Arda Turán. Put your leg in there.\n17:1 Comment: Again.\n17:2 Comment: Gonzalo Castro. And the throw-in for Atlético was practically in the same place as the previous one.\n17:8 Comment: Burn. Return for Juanfran. There's Arda. Towards there in the background. Cut out. He steps on it. He hides her again.\n17:15 Comment: Corner kick.\n17:19 Comment: It is very good. It is very good.\n17:24 Comment: When they keep the boats on their feet it's much better, right?\n17:32 Comment: There online he said it was a corner kick. And a corner that Atlético de Madrid is going to take.\n17:38 Comment: Godin. Shortly he takes it to Arda. There goes the launch. He hasn't come out. The rejection. Attention.\n17:44 Comment: For Saúl, he has to become strong because there is no option to lose it to Bayern's attack.\n17:50 Comment: Atlético does it well. Burn Turán. Saúl is a little slow. The ball remains with Bende. The attention to his departure.\n17:55 Comment: Thiago comes quickly to cover. And he manages to prevent Chalanoglu from starting the counterattack.\n18:2 Comment: Huge anger for Saúl by Cholo Simérez in that loss of the ball.\n18:5 Comment: Then Atlético de Madrid recovered the ball again. But the red and white coach had placed a lot of emphasis on losing the ball in those positions.\n18:13 Comment: Ball to Hilbert. Antoine Griezmann closes there. In the center touching Spites. Castro stays to start.\n18:20 Comment: He comes up short to ask for the ball. They are now in the central circle. He comes out on the left wing for Bende. Bend the back on Son.\n18:28 Comment: Lots of ground now for Bayern's midfield.\n18:31 Comment: Bayern.\n18:32 Comment: And Leverkusen with Atlético de Madrid setting up a line of four. And Thiago between the two. He stays in a 4-1-4-1 to defend.\n18:41 Comment: The ball for Castro's position. Castro looking for a diagonal towards Hilbert's area. Hilbert arrives. How badly Siqueira has measured. Godin. I think I took a goal kick.\n18:54 Comment: Yes, I think so too.\n18:55 Comment: Kick goal.\n18:56 Comment: Siqueira didn't measure it wrong. It's just that she didn't measure it.\n19:0 Comment: Neither good nor bad.\n19:2 Comment: Goal kick. Godín won the ball.\n19:6 Comment: And he goes from fight to fight and I shoot because it's my turn. Now for Siqueira, logically. Only Simeone.\n19:10 Comment: Moyán prepares me to hit the ball.\n19:17 Comment: He makes a gesture as if looking at Simeone to say how do I serve. Well, long. This is how the Atlético de Madrid coach wants his teammate to put the ball into play.\n19:30 Comment: The mattress set. Ball up. What a push for Mandzukic. And look, it's difficult to move such a big guy.\n19:39 Comment: Yes, by Gonzalo Castro. He has seen that by height he was not going to beat him by any means. He stuck his elbow in. Clear push. Foul for Atlético de Madrid.\n19:46 Comment: Siqueira was angry because he was passing by. From Cholo Simeone.\n19:52 Comment: Yes, now from very close because I was just passing by that position close to the red team's bench.\n19:57 Comment: Javi is going to put the ball in hand.\n19:58 Comment: Yes, now from very close because I was just passing by that position close to the red team's bench.\n19:59 Comment: Javi is going to put the ball in motion. 19 for 20 in the first half.\n20:3 Comment: At Gavi launch. Siqueira. How well it has gone now. Siqueira can put it on. You will lose control.\n20:11 Comment: Too much. One more touch.\n20:13 Comment: The last check was left over. And it's a corner kick. At least Atlético de Madrid manages to keep the ball.\n20:19 Comment: Well, looking at Godín. They go up. That's always good news.\n20:24 Comment: I do not know if…\n20:25 Comment: There are some players who have problems with their boots. I think it's Diego Godín.\n20:27 Comment: I think they are broken.\n20:29 Comment: Yes Yes. That seems because she was attracting attention. The prop has come out. There is Cholo Simeone talking to him from a distance.\n20:35 Comment: He is ready to change and yes, he has problems with the Godín boots.\n20:38 Comment: Yes, to top off the one you see, obviously there is no need to change them. But here Godín goes on an adventure.\n20:43 Comment: Ball looking for the far post. It remains loose. Miranda crashes in front of the area. Saul. They run over him.\n20:50 Comment: That's a mistake, right?\n20:51 Comment: Well, it seemed clear to me that it was missing. Attention at the exit. What danger does it carry?\n20:54 Comment: There is also a tactical foul from Atlético de Madrid along the way. Bela Lavi wants to wear it. Let's go Gavi.\n20:58 Comment: Gavi who arrives before Son arrives. And he now serves the ball too short. The ball for Gonzalo Castro.\n21:5 Comment: Castro who controls the ball. He opens it for Dermic's side exit. Siqueira touched the head. He's going to get to Mandzukic.\n21:13 Comment: The backheel for Griezmann. To the bulk.\n21:16 Comment: Well, well, well, well, well, well.\n21:19 Comment: Bender who takes the ball away due to the permissiveness of referee Antoine Griezmann. Gonzalo Castro plays.\n21:28 Comment: This delivery for Bender. And Bender. Short the band towards Hilbert's position.\n21:39 Comment: Put your foot in there to steal it again for Atlético.\n21:45 Comment: That is, much less that entry than the previous one.\n21:50 Comment: Well, it costs...\n21:51 Comment: Ah, that's for Thiago. Yes, for Thiago. If she is also pointing it out, she had let him continue.\n21:55 Comment: The foul is that one, that counterattack by Ricardo that we were talking about, that he had made a hit. What they have provided.\n21:56 Comment: That is the lack. So there is nothing. This is the lack. This is the lack, this is the lack. That is the lack. That is the lack. The lack That is the lack. It is the lack. It is the lack. It is the lack. It is the lack. It is the lack. It is the lack.

Carlos, I lost count on that play\n35:22 Comment: of how many footballs they played.\n35:23 Comment: I think he is the last one to arrive.\n35:26 Comment: He's not even making a gesture\n35:27 Comment: to Cholo Simeone as if he had problems.\n35:30 Comment: Yes, it is stretching.\n35:32 Comment: And well, at the moment he tells him to calm down.\n35:34 Comment: But Jesús Gámez is already

to walk around with cramps.\n35:46 Comment: against Belarabi.\n35:47 Comment: That he is a guy, that he is a spark.\n35:50 Comment: Godín launches.\n35:52 Comment: Ball to the penalty spot.\n35:54 Comment: That's where Papadopoulos came from.\n35:56 Comment: The ball.\n35:56 Comment: Belarabi who puts her under.\n35:58 Comment: Try to get big.\n35:59 Comment: And Thiago doesn't get it.\n36:0

cut.\n36:7 Comment: Miranda puts it long.\n36:8 Comment: Manchukis cannot participate\n36:10 Comment: because it came from offside.\n36:11 Comment: You don't miss the role of Godín.\n36:13 Comment: Godín is intercepting everything.\n36:15 Comment: It's been impressive for the team.\n36:17 Comment: Once again, we would say.\n36:20 Comment: The truth is that Godín's performance\n36:22 Comment: In this Atlético de Madrid it is superlative.\n36:25 Comment: I touch it.\n36:26 Comment: Manchukis who do not believe that Saúl cannot arrive.\n36:28 Comment: Attention to the center.\n36:29 Comment:

makes.\n36:49 Comment: But Jesús Gámez is going to enter shortly.\n36:54 Comment: Take out Moyan.\n36:55 Comment: Long ball.\n36:56 Comment: Up towards Arda's head.\n36:58 Comment: It burns that it doesn't arrive.\n37:0 Comment: Throw-in\n37:2 Comment: And Gámez is ready to jump.\n37:4 Comment: What I don't know is why the fourth official is not as active as he should be.\n37:10 Comment: Ball back.\n37:10 Comment: Log.\n37:11 Comment: Leno touches the ball.\n37:12 Comment: And Siqueira is saying that I'm fine.\n37:14 Comment: He says, yes, I don't care if you are fine.\n37:15 Comment:

already been made.\n37:31 Comment: Jesús Gámez is going to enter.\n37:33 Comment: Siqueira leaves the field of play in the first change of the game.\n37:35 Comment: It's also not just about being with you, but about the uncertainty that it generates around all of your colleagues.\n37:41 Comment: Know if he is there or not, also taking into account the dance partner he has, which is Belarabi.\n37:47 Comment: Gámez enters practically without warming up.\n37:50 Comment: But what happens is that it doesn't matter if Siqueira tells him it's right or wrong.\n37:54 Comment: The coach wants to change him.\n37:56 Comment: Griezmann to the fight.\n37:58 Comment: Papadopoulos jumped.\n38:0 Comment: He took the ballot out.\n38:1 Comment: Throw-in\n38:1 Comment: 38 match.\n38:9 Comment: Gámez is going

band.\n38:56 Comment: Wendel who clears.\n38:57 Comment: That ball goes out.\n38:58 Comment: This was a clear opportunity to pierce the net of Leverkusen's goal.\n39:5 Comment: And the red-and-white fans who have practically not been heard in the entire first half wake up with this occasion, almost Griezmann's chance.\n39:13 Comment: Wendel goes to the ground to prevent Juanfran's arrival.\n39:16 Comment: It is curious or almost unheard of to see Luz de Madrid come second in a melee.\n39:24 Comment: With the ball, Arda held it phenomenally.\n39:26 Comment: Gabi Arda another cut from the Turk.\n39:29 Comment: He keeps hiding it.\n39:30 Comment: Now throw a heeled pipe.\n39:31 Comment: It doesn't come out.\n39:32 Comment: Gabi can take it.\n39:34 Comment: The rejection.\n39:35 Comment:

he'd love to get on the field now, wouldn't he?\n39:51 Comment: Saúl is not there, huh?\n39:52 Comment: Saúl is not there either, eh?\n39:53 Comment: No this.\n39:54 Comment: As Raúl García told him a few minutes ago to warm up just in case.\n39:57 Comment: It seems that he made a gesture to her.\n39:58 Comment: Saúl is not finished.\n40:0 Comment: However, I would say that since he received the blow, Saúl is doing his best.\n40:7 Comment: But physically he must have problems and cannot enter now.\n40:11 Comment: He's making the effort to try to get there, but what he's more or less doing is getting in the way.\n40:15 Comment: The ball for Papadopoulos.\n40:18 Comment: He touched the ball backwards over Hilbert's position.\n40:21 Comment: He has Belarabi glued to the touchline and Hilbert tries.\n40:24 Comment: Solo against Gámez.\n40:25 Comment: Throw-in for Bayern Leverkusen.\n40:28 Comment: Keep warming up.\n40:29 Comment: Well, you are now receiving instructions.\n40:30 Comment:

over.\n40:35 Comment: Well, bad luck for Atlético de Madrid.\n40:38 Comment: Two decisions that Cholo Simeone has to make as a result of the circumstances and not the progress of the game.\n40:44 Comment: Touch the ball back to Hilbert on Castro.\n40:48 Comment: Castro short on Spáez.\n40:49 Comment: There goes Castro de Mansukic.\n40:51 Comment: Shift into the position of...\n40:53 Comment: Bento.\n40:54 Comment: Sell.\n40:55 Comment: Vendel is in your way.\n40:56 Comment: Arda Turán leaves it short.\n40:58 Comment: Thiago takes it for Griezmann.\n40:59 Comment: Thiago again.\n41:0 Comment: How good now for Griezmann.\n41:1 Comment: Griezmann who cuts.\n41:2 Comment: It goes.\n41:3 Comment: He plays it up for Mansukic.\n41:4 Comment: On the other side is Arda Turán.\n41:5 Comment: Spáez comes with an advantage to close.\n41:8 Comment: The...\n41:9 Comment: It's just impressive.\n41:11 Comment: Is awesome.\n41:12 Comment: The tickets to the package.\n41:14 Comment:

down.\n41:29 Comment: And that change will be made shortly.\n41:31 Comment: They are not team tickets.\n41:33 Comment: It's not that that tackle on Mansukic is going to hurt him.\n41:35 Comment: I don't want to give more seriousness to what it is.\n41:37 Comment: But they are not tickets that you see in a soccer game.\n41:40 Comment: It's a clumsy entry.\n41:42 Comment: Exact.\n41:43 Comment: It means that they are single versus married entries.\n41:46 Comment: Because it is bulk.\n41:47 Comment: There is no option.\n41:48 Comment: You don't enter like that with the body.\n41:50 Comment: Well, Saúl is leaving the field of play.\n41:52 Comment: Enter Raúl García.\n41:52 Comment: Yeah.\n41:53 Comment: Raúl García, Ricardo.\n41:54 Comment: Second conditional change now for Atlético de Madrid.\n41:56 Comment: And with these two changes, Siqueira left due to injury.\n41:58 Comment: Well, now it's hard for him to even breathe and leave the field of play.\n42:1 Comment: Hope he doesn't go to the hospital.\n42:3 Comment: Hope Saúl doesn't go to the hospital directly.\n42:5 Comment: Because the two bulls are taking him off the field with some alarm.\n42:9 Comment: Pay attention to Gaby's shot into the area.\n42:11 Comment: Godín who rises.\n42:12 Comment: It falls to Griezmann.\n42:13 Comment: The low inside the area.\n42:14 Comment: He puts it back.\n42:15 Comment: Clear the

Comment: There, pay attention that they have collided.\n3:39 Comment: It is a team that exploits the space in front of it, it is a team that has to be in motion,\n3:45 Comment: Moving forward, when it's your turn to think and design, you don't have any more difficulties, let's say,\n3:53 Comment: But that, exploiting the space in front of you in a counterattack, does have its danger.\n3:58

Comment: Miranda fights well, avoiding the arrival from the mecho.\n7:6 Comment: How do you want to stage a complete coup with Arda Turán?\n7:10 Comment: Moyán did not realize that it was Arda Turán,

his attention.\n10:31 Comment: There he has already taken the ball to Atlético, this time Manchuky couldn't kill it for Arda,\n10:37 Comment: Who applauds you, throw-in for Bayern Leverkusen.\n10:40 Comment: 10 minutes of this second half and if we have played as little as in the first, that is, almost nothing.\n10:46 Comment: Well, I can understand that some German fan can say, hey, I don't see Leti Madrid being that good,\n10:52 Comment: Because he is not playing well, now Bayern Leverkusen has very few records.\n10:58 Comment: Attention there to Belarabi who is very fast, Belarabi leaves,

second half and reaches Bayern Leverkusen's goal.\n11:17 Comment: Now Atlético de Madrid has to get back to what it does, which is playing football,\n11:21 Comment: Because he has to score to win the match against Bayern Leverkusen.\n11:30 Comment: Belarabi seemed like he was out of options, but the one who solves it is Calhanoglu in that extraordinary way.\n11:37 Comment: Well, it's very disappointing Carlos, the fact that Bayern Leverkusen scored,\n11:42 Comment: because my part is that it is a team with so few records, that it is really a matter of counterattacks,\n11:50 Comment: In this play, in the last section of the play we see the repetition there,\n11:57 Comment: There is no one really to blame for Atlético de Madrid,\n12:0 Comment: But it's his fault that he lost the ball in his own court in a terrible way,\n12:5 Comment: The whole game is a divided ball and the divided balls,\n12:10 Comment: Atlético de Madrid is runner-up in all its battles.\n12:13 Comment: Ah, the

now it's going to cost you the cardboard.\n12:29 Comment: Now yes, I had caught his attention in the previous play and now with this foul,\n12:32 Comment: Even if it's just for repetition, I've put that yellow cardboard on it,\n12:35 Comment: Cholo Simeone tried to raise the spirits of his players with harangues, with applause,\n12:39 Comment: Caviz Bajo, the Atlético de Madrid players were going to serve from the center, it looks bad.\n12:44 Comment: Well, he has to raise his head at Atlético de Madrid,\n12:47 Comment: Because he certainly hasn't managed to play much so far in the game.\n12:51 Comment: And these are not exactly Bayern Munich,\n12:56 Comment: few records but they are winning 1-0.\n13:0 Comment: The one who has seen yellow cardboard comes, Papa Paulos also has it,\n13:5 Comment: Gaby is going to take out.\n13:10 Comment: There goes Gaby's shot, far post, Godín attacks the ball, it is loose,\n13:15 Comment: With your hand, right?

who has to...\n13:35 Comment: My mother, my mother, no, no, he took a goal kick.\n13:43 Comment: Let's see the first one, Michael.\n13:49 Comment: There, there, I think that's where Wendel goes with his thigh to play the ball,\n13:54 Comment: and therefore the assistant is probably right,\n13:58 Comment: What doesn't get right are the Atlético de Madrid players all protesting\n14:1 Comment: and not coming back, and then Sones's has been much clearer,\n14:3 Comment: But he gave a goal kick.\n14:6 Comment: Bela Rabi is a friend, the counterattack itself was very frank and very good for Bayern,\n14:10 Comment: And I sent him a watermelon, uff, there we breathed a little deeper.\n14:18 Comment: Well, he is saving Atlético de Madrid,\n14:21 Comment: In that counterattack it could have been 2 to 0,\n14:25 Comment: And that would have looked bad for Cholo Simeone's team,\n14:28 Comment: Yes, Atlético de Madrid is one goal away from scoring definitively\n14:30 Comment: In the qualifying match, pay attention to Godín's entrance,\n14:34 Comment: Godín has made an entrance that will cost him the yellow card.\n14:38 Comment: And not play the next game.\n14:46 Comment: There he seems to tell him the first mistake I make, and he shows me the yellow card,\n14:50 Comment: They have been doing one after the other, but the fact is that Diego Godín,\n14:54 Comment: important loss for the second leg at the Vicente Carreras.\n14:57 Comment: It gave me the sensation that he was lifting, indeed, he was lifting his foot a lot.\n15:0 Comment: It's the first one, it can't be that entry, it's a yellow entry.\n15:4 Comment: The entry is very high, it is difficult for Diego Godín to get the yellow card.\n15:10 Comment: 15 minutes into the second half and Atlético de Madrid is down 0 on the scoreboard,\n15:15 Comment: Chalanooglu's goal.\n15:18 Comment: And in addition to that news, the other next thing is that he has to start playing at some point\n15:24 Comment: If you want to get something out of here, because really with the ball at your feet\n15:26 Comment: Cholo Simeone's team practically does not get Banar plays.\n15:39 Comment: A play that the Leverkusen team is going to look for, very tight.\n15:45 Comment: Chalanooglu can put her in the center.\n15:50 Comment: Two men theoretically hiding from Moyá what the action is going to be like.\n15:57 Comment: That's Chalanooglu who puts it in, the ball goes to Gonzalo Castro, ball into the area, Gámez clears.\n16:4 Comment: Bayer Leverkusen's action was very elaborate, they released that ball that reached Godín.\n16:10 Comment: He has to avoid now and Juanfran has come out with the ball under control.\n16:14 Comment: Juanfran's launch above.\n16:16 Comment: He headed Son, Spaich takes it.\n16:20 Comment: Atlético de Madrid still cannot find a way to exit in an orderly manner.\n16:23 Comment: Chalanooglu, pay attention to the wall, it comes with everything.\n16:26 Comment: Tiago rejects it well for Chalanooglu, it is Godín who wins it.\n16:30 Comment: Tiago takes it out, delivers it to Gaby.\n16:32 Comment: Gaby is very asleep at the game.\n16:35 Comment: Sleepy.\n16:38 Comment: She's having a kind of Gaby day.\n16:41 Comment: Atlético de Madrid has come out with the value of the movement.\n16:44 Comment: Yellow Card for Bender.\n16:49 Comment: Torres is going to enter.\n16:51 Comment: Well, it's good that Torres comes in, but the issue is sending the ball to someone up high.\n16:58 Comment: The ball doesn't go up.\n17:0 Comment: The ball doesn't reach the top, so that doesn't solve much.\n17:4 Comment: The problem is that he doesn't generate play in the center of the field.\n17:7 Comment: A foul was committed against Godín.\n17:12 Comment: As the Bayer Leverkusen players complained that Godín had stepped on.\n17:15 Comment: But once the foul had been made on the Uruguayan defender of Atlético de Madrid.\n17:22 Comment: Throw-in for Atlético.\n17:26 Comment: Take advantage of Cholo to talk with Fernando Torres.\n17:30 Comment: He pats it and is ready to enter.\n17:32 Comment: Let's see what relief Cholo Simeone puts on the field today.\n17:36 Comment:

and the counterattack comes again.\n17:47 Comment: Son is coming with the ball.\n17:49 Comment: They are the one Godín had the step to stop him.\n17:52 Comment: Chalanooglu opens, the ball to the sideline for Belarabi.\n17:55 Comment: Belarabi for Chalanooglu with Son.\n17:57 Comment: Bayer Leverkusen stops.\n18:2 Comment: Castro puts a ball up for Dermic.\n18:5 Comment: The ball goes to Atlético de Madrid.\n18:7 Comment: Boyá, stand up.\n18:8 Comment: The ball goes to Atlético de Madrid.\n18:10 Comment: Boyá plays with Juanfran.\n18:13 Comment: Fenas has managed to get past midfield.\n18:16 Comment: Juanfran without the contribution of the sides.\n18:20 Comment: Atlético de Madrid is having little ball in the opponent's field.\n18:24 Comment: Well, the full-backs Carlos, like Juanfran, can't go up because he doesn't have the ball in the midfield.\n18:31 Comment: When the ball goes to midfield you can progress because you have possession.\n18:35 Comment: But without possession it is very difficult for a side to go up.\n18:39 Comment: Well, there's the change.\n18:41 Comment: Arda Turán leaves the field of play.\n18:43 Comment: Fernando Torres is going to come in, the third and last change at Atlético de Madrid.\n18:46 Comment: It burns Turán who is going to the heifer.\n18:49 Comment: Raúl García on the right, Griezmann on the left and Torres and Mandzukic

on either side.\n19:32 Comment: Because they're not ones to get excited about either.\n19:36 Comment: And I am very disappointed that a team that merely counterattacks when Pierre Bruni is missing,\n19:43 Comment: This is enough to make Atlético de Madrid have a bad time.\n19:47 Comment: He's going to take out Gilbert.\n19:49 Comment: Heading by Chalanooglu, the scorer of the

    "summary": "In the high-intensity Champions League clash between Bayer Leverkusen and Atlético de Madrid at the BayArena, Bayer Leverkusen emerged victorious with a narrow yet significant 1-0 triumph. The match, an encounter marked by fierce play, tactical duels, and moments of notable physical aggression, highlighted the stark contrast in the performances of both teams.\n\nThe first half began with Bayer Leverkusen initiating proceedings aggressively, immediately pushing forward and attempting to dominate the midfield. Atlético de Madrid, renowned for their disciplined defensive structure, found themselves under pressure early on. Within the first few minutes, the game saw both teams involved in robust physical play, as Antoine Griezmann and Mario Mandzukic for Atlético, and Gonzalo Castro and Emir Spahić for Leverkusen battled hard for midfield control. \n\nDespite some pressing from Leverkusen, Atlético's defense, led by Diego Godín and Miranda, held firm. The interplay between Gabi, Arda Turan, and Saul Niguez in the midfield created some fleeting openings, but Leverkusen's high pressure and quick recoveries disrupted these efforts. Barging challenges and tactical fouls became a frequent sight, exemplifying the physical and tactical duel unfurling on the pitch.\n\nAs the half progressed, the match was characterized by a series of abortive attacks from both sides. Leverkusen's presses often led to long clearances by Atlético, resulting in divided balls—situations where possession changed hands frequently. Key players like Castro and Spahić engaged in numerous aerial and ground duels with Mandzukic and Griezmann, ensuring the play remained disjointed and fractious.\n\nA pivotal moment arose when Saul Niguez took a heavy blow to his midsection, impacting his ribs. Although initially attempting to continue, it soon became evident the injury was severe, leading to his substitution by Raúl García in the 41st minute. This substitution, coupled with Atlético's struggle to maintain sustained possession, began to emphasize the tactical stalemate between the two outfits.\n\nBayer's physical approach, heavily influenced by Roger Schmidt's instructions, saw continuous fouling disrupting Atlético's rhythm. On the flip side, Diego Simeone's men were forced more often into reactive play rather than dictating the tempo. As halftime approached, the scoreline remained goalless, but the intensity and sting of the competition were unmistakable.\n\nThe second half began with Bayer Leverkusen seeking to translate their dominance into concrete opportunities. Within minutes, they pressed forward, leveraging quick combinations between their midfield and attack. Karim Bellarabi began to assert more influence, making incisive runs and challenging Atlético's backline.\n\nIn the 56th minute, the breakthrough came for Bayer. Bellarabi’s cut inside the box and subsequent square pass found Hakan Çalhanoğlu, who rifled a superb shot past Moya, giving Bayer the lead. The goal was a testament to Bellarabi’s vision and Çalhanoğlu’s precise finishing, catching Atlético’s defense off-guard.\n\nWith the lead, Bayer continued to challenge Atlético's resilience. They consistently targeted physical duels, pushing Atlético to their limits. Diego Godín's frustration grew apparent with a high challenge on a Bayer player, earning him a yellow card and ruling him out for the return leg. This booking exemplified Atlético's mounting difficulty in containing Bayer's aggressive playstyle.\n\nAdding to Atlético’s woes, Tiago Mendes, already on a booking, committed an untimely foul on Bellarabi in the 76th minute, resulting in a second yellow and subsequent red card. Reduced to ten men, Atlético's task grew increasingly arduous, not just for the current match but projecting the implications into the return leg as well.\n\nThroughout the remainder of the match, Atlético's attempts to level the score featured long balls aimed at Mandzukic and substitutions to inject fresh energy. However, Bayer’s organized defense, coupled with the leadership from players like Gonzalo Castro and Emir Spahić, nullified these efforts.\n\nBayer's own substitutions, including the introduction of Simon Rolfes for Lars Bender and Stefan Kiessling for Josip Drmic, consolidated their midfield and attack. Kiessling, although coming off a bout of flu, provided a robust presence upfront. These changes ensured Bayer retained tactical superiority, forcing Atlético into defensive postures and reducing their counter-attacking threats.\n\nTowards the end, Fernando Torres’s introduction alongside Griezmann offered a glimmer of hope. Torres, however, found himself isolated, often receiving long, hopeful clearances rather than strategic through-balls. Despite some semblance of threat during set-pieces, including a potentially dangerous moment with Torres and Godín near Bayer’s goal, the conclusive strike eluded Atlético.\n\nThe final moments saw Bayer maintaining possession intelligently, frustrating Atlético’s attempts to regain control. The closing whistle marked a hard-earned but deserved victory for Bayer Leverkusen. Atlético, despite their disciplined defensive approach, were unable to muster the attacking prowess required to break down Bayer’s organized lines.\n\nThis encounter was a vivid example of contrasting football philosophies clashing on the grand European stage. Bayer's aggressive pressing and quick transitions proved decisive against an Atlético side that, despite its resolute defense, struggled to impose its typically rigid and structured gameplay. As Leverkusen celebrated their home victory, the tie remained delicately poised with all eyes set on the return leg at the Vicente Calderon, where Atlético would need a definitive response to overturn the deficit and progress in the competition."
