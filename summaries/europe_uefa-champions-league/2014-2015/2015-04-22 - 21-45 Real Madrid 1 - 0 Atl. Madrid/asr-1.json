Atletico when they withdraw and do concede a little bit of space.\n1:42 Comment: I was asking a lot from the player who doesn't score too many goals.\n1:45 Comment: Played plenty of football in his debut season and played it well.\n1:51 Comment: We saw Carlo Ancelotti.\n1:53 Comment: A real contrast in characters in the two dugouts.\n1:56 Comment: Ancelotti calm at least on the outside.\n1:59 Comment: Diego Simeone a bundle of restless energy.\n2:2 Comment: He got himself into trouble again at the weekend.\n2:5 Comment: When Atletico went away to Deportivo La Coruña he was sent to the stands.\n2:12 Comment: What you see is what you get with him.\n2:18 Comment: Ramos wins the challenge.\n2:20 Comment: Pepe.\n2:22 Comment: Here's James Rodriguez.\n2:26 Comment: And here's the goal.\n2:30 Comment: The same thing with Javier Hernandez.\n2:33 Comment: He's only making his seventh start.\n2:36 Comment: And come here at the beginning of the season on loan from Manchester United.\n2:39 Comment: Only his second of this calendar year.\n2:42 Comment: And he's not really been hiding his disappointment.\n2:45 Comment: No. And he doesn't link the play.\n2:47 Comment: He's not that kind of player in the way that Benzema is.\n2:53 Comment: That's not a strength of his.\n2:54 Comment: He'll be trying to get him behind.\n2:55 Comment: But of course Atletico won't leave much space for the Mexican.\n3:2 Comment: It's going to have this kind of pattern, isn't it?\n3:4 Comment: Allowing Real Madrid possession.\n3:6 Comment: They just slot into their shape.\n3:9 Comment: Atletico.\n3:17 Comment: Real Madrid scored nine goals in the three previous Champions League games.\n3:21 Comment: Before the goalless draw at the Vicente Calderon.\n3:26 Comment: But Atletico managed just one.\n3:30 Comment: Not through a round of 16 via a penalty shootout.\n3:38 Comment: Here's Fabio Contreras getting a chance of some first team football.\n3:41 Comment: After a pretty patchy season from his point of view.\n3:44 Comment: Because of the suspension from Marcelo.\n3:51 Comment: Dani Carvajal.\n3:58 Comment: Pressure put on young Saúl.\n3:59 Comment: It's a big ask for him.\n4:4 Comment: And a referee.\n4:6 Comment: He will have some tight judgment calls, you feel.\n4:10 Comment: Could be who is the most successful side in influencing him.\n4:14 Comment: He wasn't influenced then.\n4:15 Comment: It's a throw to Atletico.\n4:16 Comment: Not a free kick to Javier Hernandez and Real Madrid.\n4:20 Comment: I think that's fair enough.\n4:21 Comment: But when you're reffing any game involving Atletico.\n4:24 Comment: You know you're going to have to keep your eyes peeled.\n4:26 Comment: You cannot take your eyes off this for a second.\n4:28 Comment: Because the individual battles.\n4:32 Comment: The niggly fouls.\n4:35 Comment: They never stop.\n4:38 Comment: Touched off by Adeturan to Saúl.\n4:42 Comment: Muzsukic has gone on through the middle.\n4:43 Comment: But the ball is not coming his way.\n4:46 Comment: And there's an incident here.\n4:48 Comment: Which has left Sergio Ramos.\n4:50 Comment: This is a little bit of what I was hinting about a few moments ago.\n4:57 Comment: Yeah.\n5:0 Comment: I don't know how intentional that was.\n5:1 Comment: But he certainly did catch him.\n5:4 Comment: Probably not enough to have him writhing in agony though.\n5:9 Comment: He's going to be important though in the middle of the park there.\n5:11 Comment: Starting on the right.\n5:13 Comment: Contesting those loose balls.\n5:18 Comment: Just six miles apart.\n5:19 Comment: The two clubs in this Spanish capital.\n5:24 Comment: In European football terms.\n5:25 Comment: Real are on a different planet though.\n5:28 Comment: Ten times the winners of a trophy.\n5:29 Comment: Which has never been in Atletico's hands.\n5:33 Comment: Just the two finals last year and 40 years prior to that.\n5:35 Comment: When they were very very close on both occasions.\n5:39 Comment: And now they're going to be a little bit more difficult.\n5:42 Comment: Because they're going to be a little bit more\n5:44 Comment: close on both occasions.\n5:58 Comment: And it's Varane.\n6:0 Comment: He's been playing very well recently.\n6:1 Comment: Despite a knee problem.\n6:5 Comment: Miranda with the header away.\n6:15 Comment: The foul count might be interesting come the end of the evening.\n6:21 Comment: Well it's in Atletico's favour.\n6:24 Comment: If the game becomes disrupted.\n6:27 Comment: If Real can't find their rhythm.\n6:29 Comment: That's what they do best.\n6:30 Comment: The visitors.\n6:33 Comment: Could be a night for patience for the home team here.\n6:37 Comment: Trusting in the talent.\n6:42 Comment: Miranda with the free kick.\n6:45 Comment: Sergio Ramos going for it with Dani Carvajal.\n6:49 Comment: Hernandez gets it down.\n6:50 Comment: Takes it a little bit into trouble.\n6:54 Comment: And that's been broadcast live to Javier Hernandez's home country Mexico.\n6:59 Comment: In the middle of the day with a time difference.\n7:4 Comment: A little bit of interest there.\n7:6 Comment: They haven't seen too much of him.\n7:8 Comment: Playing for this famous club.\n7:14 Comment: Kroos.\n7:15 Comment: Varane.\n7:26 Comment: Certainly in the first leg.\n7:28 Comment: Real Madrid started better.\n7:31 Comment: Than the opposition.\n7:33 Comment: Certainly in the second half when really they.\n7:35 Comment: Started to believe in themselves.\n7:36 Comment: Atletico.\n7:39 Comment: It takes more than a season of good results.\n7:41 Comment: To change.\n7:43 Comment: Prevailing.\n7:45 Comment: Psychology between certainly the sets of supporters.\n7:49 Comment: So difficult to find that extra pass.\n7:51 Comment: 30 yards from goal.\n7:53 Comment: That's where they will miss Luka Modric.\n7:55 Comment: And where Isco's got to play his part.\n7:58 Comment: Carvajal.\n8:0 Comment: The.\n8:1 Comment: Crafted.\n8:2 Comment: Pass infield towards James Rodriguez.\n8:4 Comment: Remember Tiago many of you from his.\n8:6 Comment: Time at Chelsea.\n8:7 Comment: The first.\n8:9 Comment: Time at Chelsea.\n8:10 Comment: Time around for Jose Mourinho.\n8:18 Comment: Forward by.\n8:19 Comment: Jesus Gammas Griezmann.\n8:21 Comment: Pursuing.\n8:23 Comment: Well he can get the team up Griezmann with his pace.\n8:26 Comment: On the counter he's.\n8:27 Comment: He's the outlet.\n8:35 Comment: Kroos.\n8:37 Comment: Now Isco.\n8:41 Comment: By Sal in the first place.\n8:44 Comment: And.\n8:45 Comment: The careless one from Manzuka.\n8:47 Comment: To.\n8:49 Comment: In the wars in the first game.\n8:52 Comment: Also.\n8:53 Comment: A bit lucky to stay on the pitch.\n8:55 Comment: He lost the plot for a while.\n8:57 Comment: Still blood in the cause.\n8:59 Comment: Almost saw.\n9:0 Comment: The same color on a card.\n9:7 Comment: Nice touch by.\n9:8 Comment: Rodriguez.\n9:9 Comment:

Ronaldo.\n9:23 Comment: Trying to.\n9:26 Comment: Put an impact on the game from distance.\n9:28 Comment: Yeah harder to run coming right across the pitch from that.\n9:31 Comment: Position on the right.\n9:33 Comment: Truck in his man.\n9:35 Comment: And.\n9:36 Comment: It's a good point you made Alan about.\n9:38 Comment: Sergio Ramos just covering when Danny Carvajal goes forward.\n9:40 Comment: Because he is.\n9:43 Comment: A definite weapon in these circumstances.\n9:45 Comment: I guess both fullbacks are.\n9:47 Comment: Yeah.\n9:48 Comment: Carlo Ancelotti.\n9:51 Comment: It's been a.\n9:52 Comment: Slow start from the home team.\n9:55 Comment: With the absentees.\n9:57 Comment: I think that's going to hamper them against this.\n9:59 Comment: Really resilient.\n10:1

fifth consecutive season.\n10:46 Comment: Unheard of figures really.\n10:49 Comment: And by Carvajal.\n10:51 Comment: It's good.\n10:53 Comment: Movement from.\n10:54 Comment: Javier Hernandez to get

Comment: The player.\n11:19 Comment: Hernandez in here.\n11:22 Comment: He's quick to apologize.\n11:24 Comment: It wasn't just the wrong option.\n11:26 Comment: It was a.\n11:27 Comment: Poor attempt at the wrong option.\n11:28 Comment: Well it always looks worse.\n11:30 Comment: I mean.\n11:31 Comment: It struck me hard and low.\n11:33 Comment: He might have given.\n11:34 Comment: Black something to think about here.\n11:36 Comment: Maybe there weren't too many.\n11:38 Comment: Other alternatives for him to cut it back.\n11:39 Comment: No there were a couple.\n11:41 Comment: Emerging on the edge of the box.\n11:42 Comment: But I don't think either was an easy picker.\n11:52 Comment: Codine is captaining the team tonight with Gabby.\n11:54 Comment: Having been left out.\n11:56 Comment: His cocaine.\n11:58 Comment: With Gabby out.\n11:59 Comment: He's moved to a more central.\n12:1 Comment: Midfield role for Simeone.\n12:9 Comment: Real Madrid.\n12:10 Comment: Looking for.\n12:12

Comment: By Ronaldo.\n12:30 Comment: Met by Miranda.\n12:32 Comment: Down by Veran.\n12:34 Comment: And only go to extra time if it's nil.\n12:36 Comment: Again here after 90 minutes.\n12:39 Comment: There has never been in the Champions League time.\n12:42 Comment: A game that's had no goals from.\n12:44 Comment: Both legs including the.\n12:46 Comment: Extra time that comes obviously from the second game.\n12:48 Comment: And I can't imagine.\n12:50 Comment: That he's been able to.\n12:52 Comment: Get a win.\n12:53 Comment: In the Champions League.\n12:55 Comment: And.\n12:56 Comment: Obviously from the second game.\n12:58 Comment: I get one here.\n13:0 Comment: Any score.\n13:2 Comment: Would be decided in 90 minutes.\n13:3 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo.\n13:6 Comment: In a central position.\n13:8 Comment: Not finding the target.\n13:9 Comment: A little mistake there from Atletico.\n13:13 Comment: He's dragging his shot.\n13:19 Comment: In these.\n13:20 Comment: Seven meetings this season with Atletico.\n13:22 Comment: He's only scored a couple of times.\n13:23 Comment: So he's.\n13:24 Comment: Way down on his normal average.\n13:26 Comment: Against the opposition that he faces tonight.\n13:28 Comment: Normal ratio.\n13:30 Comment: But I failed to score in only one of the last 86 here.\n13:33 Comment: Well Madrid and that was against.\n13:35 Comment: The team the plane tonight.\n13:44 Comment: Where.\n13:45 Comment: Atletico are very effective.\n13:46 Comment: Is it set pieces but they need to get them.\n13:48 Comment: A bit further up the pitch in this one.\n13:50 Comment: Yeah they've got a few routines up the sleeve.\n13:52 Comment: And they.\n13:54 Comment: Scored.\n13:55 Comment: The weekend from a.\n13:57 Comment: Set piece Griezmann eventually.\n13:59 Comment: But a great overhead kick.\n14:4 Comment: 35 of 89 goals in all competition this season.\n14:7 Comment: Have come from research.\n14:10 Comment: Okay.\n14:12 Comment: Tiago.\n14:15 Comment: Wasn't involved in the first game.\n14:17 Comment: Previously been sent off against by a Leiber.\n14:19 Comment: Cousin.\n14:21 Comment: Around the 16.\n14:23 Comment: To add nearly bit then.\n14:25 Comment: I just saw the opportunity to maybe leave a little bit on his\n14:27 Comment: opponent there.\n14:34 Comment: I'm in a little step.\n14:38 Comment: Having.\n14:40 Comment: Gamus in the side he has got a very long throw and.\n14:43 Comment: This is a set piece.\n14:46 Comment: Some threat to Real Madrid.\n14:48 Comment: Yeah they would have talked about this for Madrid.\n14:50 Comment: Beforehand.\n14:51 Comment: Dealing with it.\n14:55 Comment: Only partially away.\n14:57 Comment: To see us.\n14:58 Comment: Okay.\n15:0 Comment: Couldn't hit the target on the follow-up.\n15:3 Comment: Yeah worrying moments.\n15:5 Comment: These kind of set pieces.\n15:6 Comment: The CS could have actually come and caught it.\n15:8 Comment: I don't think that most of the show.\n15:15 Comment: Let's go pressing a bit higher this time.\n15:22 Comment: That's been a message from Simi.\n15:23 Comment: Any with all that semaphore.\n15:30 Comment: Sergio Ramos.\n15:32 Comment: On from for Ryan.\n15:34 Comment: Is go.\n15:43 Comment: Around.\n15:46 Comment: Everyone behind the ball for Atletico.\n15:52 Comment: And it's Rodriguez.\n15:55 Comment: Switch of play.\n15:56 Comment: They shuttle across in the red and white stripes.\n16:1 Comment: Miranda.\n16:2 Comment: To make that header.\n16:5 Comment: And Saul.\n16:10 Comment: Pepe.\n16:15 Comment: One fan to go for.\n16:17 Comment: Swales throw.\n16:19 Comment: In a hurry to take it difficult to be a little more direct.\n16:22 Comment: Without Benzema in the team.\n16:30 Comment: Interception by Tiago but he couldn't trigger a counter-attack.\n16:40 Comment: For these kind of nights at around 78,000.\n16:49 Comment: Football stadium with so much history.\n16:52 Comment: Hello, Angelotti.\n16:53 Comment: In effect, lost his job at Chelsea.\n16:56 Comment: And he went down to the Champions League at this stage to Manchester United.\n17:0 Comment: Another local affair if you like within the same country.\n17:6 Comment: Javier Hernandez was an opponent then.\n17:12 Comment: And as Rodriguez gets there.\n17:14 Comment: Will be a fortunate break.\n17:15 Comment: Ronaldo to his right.\n17:17 Comment: Hernandez waiting in the middle.\n17:19 Comment: Isco getting in as well.\n17:25 Comment: Back to Carvajal.\n17:27 Comment: Room for Sergio Ramos.\n17:32 Comment: Contral puts it in first time.\n17:39 Comment: This is gone in.\n17:40 Comment: I think it was Faber.\n17:42 Comment: Sergio Ramos.\n17:46 Comment: Trying to find the back of the net in the Champions League against Atletico Madrid again.\n17:50 Comment: Yeah, well, he'll be trying to do that from that midfield position.\n17:53 Comment: When the ball goes wide.\n17:55 Comment: Get next to Hernandez.\n17:56 Comment: Give him a bit of aerial power.\n18:2 Comment: And they do get men behind the ball at Atletico so quickly.\n18:5 Comment: You saw that there.\n18:11 Comment: Godin.\n18:16 Comment: Thiago.\n18:25 Comment: One front.\n18:27 Comment: He started his career with Real Madrid.\n18:30 Comment: Had a sprinkling of first team appearances.\n18:34 Comment: He and Dani Carvajal, the other right back, are jostling for that berth in Spanish national team at the moment.\n18:41 Comment: Did come off the hand, that left one front.\n18:43 Comment: See why Contral was annoyed.\n18:57 Comment: Taude Turan.\n18:59 Comment: Who is.\n19:1 Comment: Leading in the aggression stakes for Atletico at the moment.\n19:4 Comment: Yeah, it wasn't so much an elbow as an arm off, but.\n19:7 Comment: Taude Turan, I think, knew where his opponent was there.\n19:13 Comment: And towards Godin.\n19:14 Comment: He did get a touch.\n19:21 Comment: A little bit of a hopeful.\n19:23 Comment: Shout for a handoff.\n19:25 Comment: And a goal.\n19:30 Comment: A little bit of a hopeful.\n19:32 Comment: Shout for a handball.\n19:36 Comment: And Contral.\n19:38 Comment: Did his job well.\n19:39 Comment: Obviously.\n19:42 Comment: Yeah, it was hopeful as well.\n19:44 Comment: Throw in.\n19:48 Comment: Also.\n19:51 Comment: Ronaldo with a job to come out and help him deal with it.\n19:57 Comment: Koke.\n20:1 Comment: Well, it was an interesting goal.\n20:2 Comment: If it had got the own Danica Baha from.\n20:5 Comment: The French international.\n20:7 Comment: Nice little spell.\n20:8 Comment: They do well to make to keep the ball.\n20:10 Comment: They pen you in.\n20:11 Comment: Keep the ball alive in that final third.\n20:18 Comment: Could it be.\n20:20 Comment: The set piece factor for Atletico Madrid.\n20:26 Comment: How many bodies for them to see us here.\n20:29 Comment: Any.\n20:30 Comment: Kind of flick.\n20:31 Comment: Could take it in.\n20:34 Comment: The Turan going for it.\n20:35 Comment: The jumps were a bit untidy out by Isco.\n20:45 Comment: Overhead.\n20:50 Comment: He could see us continues to hold down his place here.\n20:55 Comment: An issue of course when Jose Mourinho was the manager.\n20:58 Comment: The move.\n21:4 Comment: Another aerial challenge.\n21:8 Comment: Officials have to rule about the.\n21:10 Comment: Arm use for elevation news for anything else.\n21:12 Comment: In fact, it's the.\n21:14 Comment: The shoulder.\n21:15 Comment: Ronaldo.\n21:16 Comment: Yeah, he just does a little half turn.\n21:18 Comment: To lean into Gamers there.\n21:22 Comment: Who's not shine coming forward himself he'll stand up for\n21:25 Comment: himself.\n21:28 Comment: I think Carlo Ancelotti knows that if it is an all-out battle here his team might come\n21:34 Comment: off second best.\n21:35 Comment: What they haven't been able to do in all these meetings this season is really impose the\n21:44 Comment: individual talent that they have.\n21:48 Comment: He says it's the best squad in the world.\n21:49 Comment: Well, not the best set of results in the world against their rivals here in Madrid in Simeone's\n21:56 Comment: style.\n22:0 Comment: Because they play the same eleven quite often week after week, Madrid, then you have one\n22:4 Comment: or two changes, one or two injuries and it can disturb your flow, your rhythm.\n22:10 Comment: Yes, that's a bit of an issue here at the moment, playing the same team time and time\n22:15 Comment: again.\n22:16 Comment: The suggestion is that there's presidential pressure on Ancelotti to do that.\n22:20 Comment: The national coach of Croatia has been complaining about Modric playing too often and he's got\n22:25 Comment: an injury due to overloads in his club career.\n22:32 Comment: Thiago, Koke, Godin.\n22:39 Comment: I thought he was fouled as he played it forward.\n22:48 Comment: The referee is shaking his head, I'm not sure he saw the last bit of contact.\n22:54 Comment: Good by Godin again, met by Dani Carvajal.\n22:56 Comment: Given away by Ronaldo.\n22:59 Comment: Harder to run.\n23:0 Comment: Feeling the way into the game now at Letico.\n23:5 Comment: I'd be pleased if we were able to get these first halves panned out so far at least.\n23:10 Comment: Jesus Gammas, flag stays down.\n23:12 Comment: Koke, only a couple to try and pick out with a cutback.\n23:18 Comment: A build up play.\n23:20 Comment: Carried a hint of danger that time.\n23:24 Comment: Lovely little run from Koke and Carvajal was alert to it.\n23:28 Comment: A big throw.\n23:31 Comment: It's been shaped up for him.\n23:40 Comment: They're just waiting for Godin to get in there.\n23:42 Comment: Mandzukic waiting, hands on hips.\n23:45 Comment: Godin is a bit of a decoy.\n23:51 Comment: Miranda, Griezmann might be offside here.\n23:56 Comment: Flag stays down.\n24:1 Comment: Running into trouble.\n24:4 Comment: Carried by Pepe.\n24:9 Comment: Well it's tense.\n24:10 Comment: It's leading to some tackles, some challenges that need extra scrutiny.\n24:16 Comment: But it's so gripping because of the context that the match is in, not just because it's\n24:25 Comment: a derby.\n24:26 Comment: Haven't yet got Mandzukic into the game.\n24:30 Comment: It's a local match with global interest.\n24:36 Comment: The team here known simply as Madrid against Atletico.\n24:47 Comment: Isco.\n24:50 Comment: Kroos.\n24:53 Comment: The ball stayed in the air a while.\n25:5 Comment: Pressure on Isco.\n25:6 Comment: We talk about Benzema and Bale and Modric but they're going to miss Marcelo, aren't\n25:11 Comment: they, with his attacking flare down that left-hand side.\n25:14 Comment: He did score in the Champions League final of course but you tend to forget he came on\n25:19 Comment: for Coentrow who started the game.\n25:26 Comment: Griezmann doing his defensive job but nowhere to plant the header except into the terrain\n25:30 Comment: of Pepe.\n25:31 Comment: Ronaldo.\n25:32 Comment: Blocked off.\n25:33 Comment: Free kick.\n25:34 Comment: And then a game they split in the right leg across.\n25:46 Comment: He's going nowhere there.\n25:48 Comment: Ronaldo.\n25:49 Comment: Certainly shooting distance.\n25:52 Comment: It'll be James Rodriguez if it's the left footer.\n25:59 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo has the right of seniority from pretty much any angle that he wants.\n26:4 Comment: And there aren't many angles that he doesn't want.\n26:7 Comment: You don't get 50 goals by passing up opportunities but very few of them have come directly from\n26:14 Comment: free kicks this season.\n26:16 Comment: The Colombian star of the World Cup in Brazil earned himself a move to matches like this.\n26:22 Comment: James Rodriguez.\n26:23 Comment: The ball isn't quite where the spray was.\n26:30 Comment: So the drummer is on hold for an extra second or two.\n26:34 Comment: But is this the breakthrough moment for Real Madrid?\n26:38 Comment: James Rodriguez teased us a little bit in the end.\n26:43 Comment: Didn't quite get his boot up to round it in the way that he would have liked to find\n26:49 Comment: that top nine.\n26:50 Comment: Ronaldo will be saying I'll have the next one.\n26:55 Comment: Thank you very much.\n26:56 Comment: Manzoukic.\n27:12 Comment: Sergio Ramos.\n27:13 Comment: Ramos just dropping in to contest that ball into Manzoukic.\n27:18 Comment: Manzoukic of course has a winning goal in the Champions League to his name for\n27:23 Comment: Bayern against Dortmund.\n27:26 Comment: Bayern who got through the semi-finals in swashbuckling style\n27:31 Comment: last night.\n27:39 Comment: That's pretty much as it was in the first leg and as it has been in most of the games\n27:44 Comment: recently between\n27:47 Comment: Real and Atletico.\n27:53 Comment: A lot of talk here as to who the Bayern coach Pep Guardiola is going to be facing in the\n27:59 Comment: semi-finals.\n28:1 Comment: It could be Barcelona.\n28:4 Comment: It could of course be Real Madrid if they can overcome this hurdle.\n28:7 Comment: But at the moment they're in trouble.\n28:9 Comment: And Casillas has to make the first\n28:14 Comment: really decent save and it came from Jesus Gamas.\n28:18 Comment: Yeah just a loose touch and no surprise there.\n28:20 Comment: I wonder how long before the referee is going to start taking sterner action.\n28:24 Comment: He's got to be totally convinced that it's a\n28:27 Comment: genuine assault and not play acting.\n28:30 Comment: Yeah we've had\n28:31 Comment: three or four kind of arms onto the face into the body.\n28:39 Comment: It's a bit of a struggle.\n28:46 Comment: Into the body.\n28:52 Comment: Not a bad effort from the left back finding himself in a\n28:55 Comment: right sided position with his right foot.\n28:59 Comment: He's a left back.\n29:0 Comment: A right footed left back so\n29:2 Comment: can sometimes\n29:4 Comment: be a bit awkward.\n29:7 Comment: Sergio Ramos.\n29:9 Comment: The left footed left back Fabio Contral.\n29:16 Comment: The left footed left back.\n29:18 Comment: Pepe.\n29:22 Comment: A bit careless from Ronaldo.\n29:32 Comment: Saúl who lost it and is annoyed with himself for doing so.\n29:37 Comment: Homeside back on the ball again.\n29:46 Comment: Sergio Ramos.\n29:48 Comment: Kroos.\n29:50 Comment: Played off by\n29:52 Comment: Javier Hernandez who\n29:53 Comment: made a run in behind straight away for a return pass.\n29:58 Comment: Isco.\n30:1 Comment: Kroos.\n30:6 Comment: A clean header.\n30:9 Comment: And Hernandez would have been wheeling away celebrating a goal.\n30:12 Comment: It's a corner though.\n30:13 Comment: It's a rare occasion actually that\n30:15 Comment: Javier Hernandez just got in between the lines\n30:17 Comment: behind that midfield to deliver a good ball.\n30:25 Comment: Intriguing thing done by Pepe here.\n30:34 Comment: That surely is going to get a card.\n30:43 Comment: Yeah.\n30:47 Comment: The fan alone deserve one.\n30:49 Comment: Let alone the\n30:50 Comment: totting up that might have been going on in the referee's mind.\n30:55 Comment: You're not going past if the ball's going past.\n30:57 Comment: You're not following it.\n30:58 Comment: Tony Kroos.\n31:7 Comment: I think we know what's coming this time.\n31:9 Comment: Yes, we've seen him\n31:11 Comment: take him on\n31:12 Comment: from even further away than this.\n31:14 Comment: I mean he's asking an awful lot but\n31:17 Comment: Far away that was it.\n31:20 Comment: Good movement in the box from Hernandez.\n31:22 Comment: He's always sharp in those\n31:24 Comment: circumstances.\n31:28 Comment: So we're just past the half hour mark.\n31:31 Comment: Of the\n31:33 Comment: second leg of this quarterfinal.\n31:34 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo\n31:35 Comment: and Oblak who've made several saves\n31:37 Comment: in the first leg at this point\n31:39 Comment: has to keep that one out.\n31:40 Comment: There's another corner\n31:42 Comment: for Real Madrid.\n31:43 Comment: A clever effort.\n31:44 Comment: Didn't try and put too much on it.\n31:45 Comment: Ronaldo\n31:47 Comment: almost intentionally made the ball bounce in front of the keeper.\n31:57 Comment: Back by Kroos.\n31:59 Comment: Probably didn't need the intervention\n32:2 Comment: of Mandzukic.\n32:3 Comment: Yeah, I don't think he was sure what was around him and if in doubt.\n32:7 Comment: Short corner this time.\n32:8 Comment: Most of that\n32:10 Comment: 82 and a half minutes has belonged\n32:13 Comment: territorially to Real Madrid.\n32:16 Comment: The quarterfinal is still awaiting its first goal.\n32:20 Comment: It's a goal.\n32:43 Comment: Pepe.\n32:44 Comment: Baran.\n32:46 Comment: It's a goal.\n32:50 Comment: Ronaldo.\n32:52 Comment: It's a goal.\n32:54 Comment: A little bit of space for his team.\n32:57 Comment: Isco to Kroos.\n32:59 Comment: It's a goal.\n33:0 Comment: Dangerous agreement\n33:2 Comment: might have gone for that.\n33:3 Comment: I think he felt that the angle on the ball was always going to defeat\n33:7 Comment: the intent of Danny Carvajal to cut it back and he was right\n33:10 Comment: but it was a little bit risky.\n33:13 Comment: Yeah, it's a typical Ronaldo effort that.\n33:18 Comment: Rob Lutt doing well to push it away into safety.\n33:23 Comment: But it is going to be a night for patience you suspect here.\n33:26 Comment: Maybe too many chances going begging.\n33:28 Comment: Manzukic for the most part has been confined to that just to\n33:32 Comment: click on clearances.\n33:37 Comment: Rao start again.\n33:38 Comment: Working all the way.\n33:44 Comment: I think he's getting picked on another.\n33:47 Comment: Arm off his compliance.\n33:49 Comment: It's a goal.\n34:6 Comment: Arm off his complaining about.\n34:10 Comment: The only shirt being pulled by Miranda.\n34:12 Comment: I don't think there was anything too much more than that.\n34:14 Comment: But again, it's something the referee could have dealt with\n34:16 Comment: but he's probably calling it even.\n34:28 Comment: Real have scored in the last 22 home games in the Champions League.\n34:33 Comment: Since Barcelona stopped them four years ago.\n34:36 Comment: They're against Atletico keeping a clean sheet here.\n34:44 Comment: I'll be pretty pleased to think it's gone as we expected it to go.\n34:50 Comment: Trying to get his own back there.\n34:58 Comment: Briefman.\n35:1 Comment: Back by Thiago.\n35:2 Comment: The Uruguayan who defied England, of course, in Brazil.\n35:8 Comment: Far short of a year ago now.\n35:11 Comment: Lucky to stay on the pitch in that game.\n35:14 Comment: Memory serves me right.\n35:26 Comment: Miranda.\n35:32 Comment: Miranda wins it in the air.\n35:34 Comment: Collected by one front.\n35:39 Comment: Griezmann.\n35:45 Comment: Moses Gomes.\n35:47 Comment: Koke.\n35:54 Comment: Chance of letting go.\n35:57 Comment: Open Real up here.\n35:58 Comment: Mandzukic.\n36:0 Comment: More meaningful variety.\n36:4 Comment: One front sneak behind Isco there.\n36:6 Comment: Wasn't quite sure where his man was.\n36:16 Comment: Getting any sympathy from the German referee.\n36:25 Comment: Thiago.\n36:28 Comment: The only tentative side from Saúl.\n36:31 Comment: Certainly not from Ronaldo with the back heel.\n36:35 Comment: Hernandez.\n36:42 Comment: Miranda will claim that he just ran into him.\n36:47 Comment: Quite often the defender does get penalised there and sometimes you have to have sympathy.\n36:52 Comment: Because he isn't obliged to get out of the way.\n36:54 Comment: Whether he steps across or not.\n37:0 Comment: I think he did.\n37:6 Comment: That one wasn't a foul.\n37:11 Comment: The one given in favour of Javier Hernandez.\n37:14 Comment: Could be a crucial one.\n37:15 Comment: Or black going for it and getting it.\n37:17 Comment: It wasn't an easy one.\n37:19 Comment: Certainly not a routine take.\n37:21 Comment: Excellent.\n37:25 Comment: Little composure from the young goalkeeper.\n37:29 Comment: There's a bit of a gap there.\n37:31 Comment: But it's not a big one.\n37:33 Comment: It's a bit of a gap.\n37:39 Comment: But it's a bit of a gap.\n37:41 Comment: It's a bit of a gap.\n37:49 Comment: All sorts going on around him.\n37:56 Comment: He's doing a great job, Sergio Vamos from those long kicks, standing in front of Mandzukic.\n38:6 Comment: Certainly the ball was played.\n38:7 Comment: Here is Mandzukic trying to ease it on to Griezmann.\n38:15 Comment: It's given against James Rodriguez.\n38:24 Comment: Just trying to roll his man.\n38:27 Comment: In a position that Gareth Bale\n38:29 Comment: perhaps been occupying\n38:31 Comment: had he not got hurt just a couple of minutes into\n38:34 Comment: the game on Saturday\n38:36 Comment: here against Malaga.\n38:37 Comment: The more whistles from the ref, the better as far as Atletico are concerned.\n38:42 Comment: They'd be content with a stop start game.\n38:44 Comment: It's the assistant who helped him then.\n38:48 Comment: Fernandez.\n38:52 Comment: And then the goalkeeper,\n38:54 Comment: who's been a great help.\n38:56 Comment: He's been a great help.\n38:58 Comment: And then the goalkeeper\n39:0 Comment: who's been a great help.\n39:1 Comment: And then the goalkeeper\n39:3 Comment: who's been a great help.\n39:4 Comment: Fernandez\n39:7 Comment: is guilty of the push.\n39:13 Comment: And Ancelotti having a word with the fourth official.\n39:17 Comment: Diego Simeone as always having words with his players.\n39:24 Comment: Saul is there.\n39:26 Comment: Mandzukic is there.\n39:28 Comment: Croquet takes.\n39:34 Comment: Macias\n39:36 Comment: making sure he dropped down safely enough.\n39:43 Comment: A lot of predictions, Alan\n39:45 Comment: from the media pack here, which is huge, incidentally.\n39:49 Comment: But this would go all the way\n39:51 Comment: in terms of extra time and maybe penalties.\n39:56 Comment: It's got that look about it at the moment, but\n39:58 Comment: still early days.\n40:4 Comment: So it was an experience against an old campaigner like\n40:8 Comment: Sergio Ramos\n40:10 Comment: might be exploited.\n40:17 Comment: It's wise enough\n40:20 Comment: to go back in\n40:22 Comment: apologetic vein, certainly in the eyes of the referee.\n40:26 Comment: They do it again.\n40:34 Comment: Just take an exception to that challenge from Saul.\n40:39 Comment: I don't think there's much in it, really.\n40:43 Comment: Here's Varane.\n40:53 Comment: Pepe.\n40:56 Comment: Dani Carvajal\n40:59 Comment: blocked off by Griezmann\n41:0 Comment: doing his\n41:2 Comment: defensively. That's been pointed out to him by Simeone\n41:5 Comment: has left him out\n41:7 Comment: on one notable occasion this season, saying it wasn't his\n41:10 Comment: usual self. What he meant was he wasn't working hard enough.\n41:13 Comment: It was nearly an excellent ball from Pepe\n41:17 Comment: Hernandez.\n41:21 Comment: Sergio Ramos has got into the box.\n41:23 Comment: James is in there as well.\n41:24 Comment: This time late in the half when concentration might just waver.\n41:33 Comment: Ramos' version of a\n41:35 Comment: longish throw.\n41:39 Comment: Manzukic\n41:41 Comment: was helping out\n41:43 Comment: in the back.\n41:45 Comment: He's got a\n41:47 Comment: good\n41:49 Comment: Manzukic\n41:51 Comment: was helping out. Griezmann is the furthest forward and he's had to\n41:55 Comment: cover a lot of ground to get there.\n41:58 Comment: Pepe.\n42:5 Comment: James Rodriguez\n42:7 Comment: just got there in the pass.\n42:12 Comment: He tempted\n42:14 Comment: Ardo Turan and I think if he hadn't been booked\n42:16 Comment: he might have gone for that.\n42:18 Comment: Nice work by\n42:20 Comment: Javier Hernandez. First time from Ronaldo.\n42:22 Comment: Put the pressure on Juan Fran beyond the far post\n42:25 Comment: to play safe at the expense of a corner.\n42:27 Comment: He's put it in the area, hasn't he?\n42:29 Comment: And he's asking why there's nobody filling that gap.\n42:34 Comment: Up come Pepe. Up comes\n42:37 Comment: Varane.\n42:39 Comment: And Sergio Ramos\n42:41 Comment: who got a little nick on it.\n42:42 Comment: Kroos.\n42:56 Comment: It wasn't worth it.\n42:58 Comment: He's got\n43:0 Comment: a\n43:2 Comment: good\n43:4 Comment: run.\n43:6 Comment: He's got\n43:8 Comment: a good\n43:10 Comment: run.\n43:12 Comment: Pass ball out wide from Sergio Ramos.\n43:15 Comment: Taking his\n43:17 Comment: midfield job tonight into playmaking territory.\n43:24 Comment: Kroos.\n43:25 Comment: Ramos again.\n43:36 Comment: Ardo Turan preventing the corner.\n43:38 Comment: Have a turn by Thiago.\n43:41 Comment: And\n43:43 Comment: the ball was stolen and\n43:45 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo\n43:47 Comment: that's the kind of mistake that you get late in the half.\n43:50 Comment: And Ronaldo really with the best chance of the half to\n43:54 Comment: give Real Madrid the advantage.\n43:57 Comment: There's Mandzukic\n43:59 Comment: opening up his body and allowing\n44:1 Comment: the ball to be nicked off him.\n44:5 Comment: I know Atlético Madrid\n44:6 Comment: are good in the air but\n44:8 Comment: Real have got plenty\n44:10 Comment: of ammunition themselves.\n44:14 Comment: That's another good stop for Mo Black.\n44:16 Comment: Gets down quickly to his left.\n44:19 Comment: Having said that\n44:21 Comment: you'd maybe expect Ronaldo to be buried in that one.\n44:27 Comment: We'll see whether Oblak's heroics\n44:29 Comment: at this time of the season gets him into the Slovenian side\n44:32 Comment: to play England.\n44:33 Comment: Which is\n44:35 Comment: an international that will be played right at the end of this\n44:37 Comment: season.\n44:38 Comment: In Ljubljana.\n44:40 Comment: June the 14th.\n44:43 Comment: Champions League final will have\n44:45 Comment: come and gone by then.\n44:46 Comment: Whether Oblak will be in it.\n44:49 Comment: I'm going to find out a bit about that tonight.\n44:51 Comment: He's certainly working hard\n44:53 Comment: for his own cause and that of Atlético Madrid.\n44:56 Comment: He's a fine goalkeeper.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:30 Comment: against Chelsea, Nil-Nil and the Calderon 3-1 to Atletico at Stamford Bridge.\n0:34 Comment: As they were going off at halftime Sergio Ramos was urging the crowd to play their\n0:40 Comment: part to turn up the volume.\n0:45 Comment: We might be in for a long night here.\n1:0 Comment: Atletico are unbeaten in their last nine matches.\n1:12 Comment: Real have only lost nine games all season but four of them to tonight's opponents.\n1:30 Comment: One from with the throat.\n1:37 Comment: Alderteran losing out.\n1:42 Comment: Isco Hernandez making good ground here.\n1:49 Comment: Beaten in the end in the chase by Miranda.\n1:56 Comment: The local sports paper here was saying that writing that this is the biggest game of Javier\n2:4 Comment: Hernandez his career.\n2:8 Comment: It's only the biggest game of his Real Madrid career which is seemingly coming to an end\n2:16 Comment: after this season but it might end of course in Berlin.\n2:22 Comment: And the Champions League final takes place.\n2:28 Comment: Sergio Ramos.\n2:32 Comment: Javier Contra remember in for the suspended Marcella.\n2:37 Comment: Moran.\n2:42 Comment: What have you made Alan of this experiment if you can call it that of\n2:45 Comment: Sergio Ramos playing in midfield.\n2:48 Comment: Forced upon Ancelotti he would probably say.\n2:51 Comment: I think it's worked okay I mean defensively he's done a job just dropping in front of\n2:56 Comment: Mandzukic making it difficult for the centre forward he's got himself in the box up the\n3:0 Comment: other end.\n3:3 Comment: Isco on the side and just wide it really was a well-created chance for Javier Hernandez.\n3:11 Comment: His movement in those circumstances is excellent his finishing is normally a little bit I know\n3:16 Comment: it was only just wide but in matches like this.\n3:19 Comment: Well they missed they missed that kind of passing up now the kind that Modric can provide\n3:22 Comment: you.\n3:23 Comment: James Rodriguez in the middle is asking for the ball but he's well entitled to swing\n3:27 Comment: his boot at that.\n3:30 Comment: Lovely pass by Isco.\n3:34 Comment: Another chance goes begging.\n3:37 Comment: But the volume is being turned up now.\n3:38 Comment: Thiago.\n3:41 Comment: Griezmann.\n3:44 Comment: Jesus Gomes.\n3:49 Comment: Koke.\n3:52 Comment: Now Griezmann.\n4:0 Comment: Mandzukic going towards it.\n4:6 Comment: Griezmann.\n4:9 Comment: I might get it back here.\n4:12 Comment: A challenge there that it's only had the three thousand the minority in the stadium questioning\n4:19 Comment: the referees to that might have been a penalty decision in their favour.\n4:26 Comment: Hernandez Rodriguez.\n4:36 Comment: Now by Kroos.\n4:40 Comment: Isco.\n4:42 Comment: Three times as many passes from way out.\n4:54 Comment: I might argue three times as many tackles from Atletico.\n5:3 Comment: Well the ref letting some of these challenges go.\n5:6 Comment: Sergio Ramos on Arditurán.\n5:9 Comment: He didn't appeal for pen two for Sifo-Slik.\n5:11 Comment: Arditurán.\n5:14 Comment: Here's Ronaldo.\n5:16 Comment: No.\n5:32 Comment: Tapey.\n5:43 Comment: Rodriguez.\n5:44 Comment: Isco.\n5:46 Comment: I don't know if it had a crack of me once but in the end it's too long thinking about it.\n5:55 Comment: Beran trying to keep the pressure on.\n5:58 Comment: Looking for Dani Carvajal on the angle of the deck for the ball leading to a corner.\n6:6 Comment: He's trying to build up a head of steam here on the home team.\n6:10 Comment: Beran had that header that came close in the first half.\n6:13 Comment: Pepe going towards the near post.\n6:14 Comment: They're piling in.\n6:17 Comment: That's a good ball in that was beat the first man.\n6:23 Comment: Isco.\n6:26 Comment: There'll be another corner.\n6:36 Comment: Looking for the referee to see where it's going to be taken from.\n6:45 Comment: Well that last ball threatened to make the breakthrough from that far side.\n6:50 Comment: It's time.\n6:52 Comment: Variation.\n6:55 Comment: Hasn't come off in the first place.\n6:57 Comment: Atletico can push out.\n7:1 Comment: And they can't really get out at the moment.\n7:15 Comment: They don't get flustered though do they when they are forced to defend.\n7:19 Comment: They play like this so often.\n7:21 Comment: Everybody knows their individual jobs.\n7:24 Comment: It's the modus operandi of Simeone.\n7:33 Comment: Who gets mentioned of course when any big jobs become available.\n7:36 Comment: But he's just committed himself to Atletico Madrid for a longer period.\n7:40 Comment: He's clearly happy here.\n7:43 Comment: He rules the boost.\n7:45 Comment: He's the boss.\n7:57 Comment: Beran.\n8:0 Comment: Isco.\n8:11 Comment: Can't try well forward but there's no way back to Isco.\n8:18 Comment: Picked on by Gabi.\n8:20 Comment: Cleverly dealt with by Kroos.\n8:21 Comment: Helped out by Isco.\n8:22 Comment: Nice flick from Sergio Ramos.\n8:24 Comment: Crowd enjoying this.\n8:25 Comment: Feeling that Real Madrid are getting ever closer to the breakthrough here.\n8:29 Comment: But Javier Hernandez has got ahead of the ball.\n8:34 Comment: He claims he was pushed ahead of the ball.\n8:37 Comment: They've certainly upped the tempo.\n8:38 Comment: Real Madrid.\n8:40 Comment: Quickened up the passing.\n8:44 Comment: Miranda just doing enough as they so often do in these aerial challenges.\n8:48 Comment: And he knew what he was doing there.\n8:50 Comment: The defender.\n8:54 Comment: Shoving the back to put him off.\n8:58 Comment: He was always struggling to get goal side Miranda.\n9:2 Comment: So he did the only thing available to him.\n9:4 Comment: The three games here that Atletico played this season.\n9:7 Comment: 1-1 in the Spanish Super Cup.\n9:10 Comment: Which they won over two legs.\n9:11 Comment: 2-2 in the Copa del Rey.\n9:13 Comment: A couple of goals from Fernando Torres on the bench tonight.\n9:16 Comment: They got through in the Copa del Rey as well.\n9:19 Comment: And a 2-1 to Atletico in La Liga.\n9:34 Comment: There are some very tough competitors out there.\n9:39 Comment: Who do not want to give any ground.\n9:46 Comment: Pepe and Sergio Ramos have a long charge sheet down the years.\n9:53 Comment: Important they don't get sucked in over Real Madrid to petty spots.\n9:57 Comment: They've just started the second half pretty well.\n10:1 Comment: They want to continue in that vein.\n10:3 Comment: Concentrate on the football.\n10:6 Comment: 10 more goalless minutes.\n10:9 Comment: Into the second half of the second leg.\n10:17 Comment: That's the rock and the hard place at the moment.\n10:31 Comment: A little bit risky from Sergio Ramos.\n10:34 Comment: A deflection helped him in the end.\n10:37 Comment: Pantrout wanting to go long into the run of Ronaldo.\n10:43 Comment: An expensive flick from an expensive player.\n10:46 Comment: It's not so much a poor final ball.\n10:48 Comment: It's pit awful searing.\n10:53 Comment: In the most part they kept Ronaldo and their players,\n11:3 Comment: Not even the attention,\n11:9 Comment: And not even his player tried at the moment,\n11:14 Comment: Found him.\n11:16 Comment: out of those danger areas he had that one chance didn't he that he couldn't take\n11:22 Comment: that's the best chance of the games\n11:28 Comment: late in the first half\n11:30 Comment: so\n11:46 Comment: here he was in london recently playing for brazil at the emirates against chile\n11:59 Comment: Thiago.\n12:8 Comment: Amid some spite, there's been some nice touches of good\n12:12 Comment: sportsmanship as well. We shouldn't go unnoticed one by\n12:15 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo apologizing for the foul.\n12:21 Comment: Gabby, Griezmann, Thiago, in steps Pepe.\n12:27 Comment: Koke telling Gamis that he should be further up the field.\n12:34 Comment: Thank you for picking up the ball for the throw and it\n12:38 Comment: wasn't Gamis' to get really. It was clearly a Real ball.\n12:41 Comment: He's not made much of that coming together. He's back in\n12:46 Comment: position and Real Madrid are back on the ball again.\n12:50 Comment: As they have been for most of the evening.\n12:54 Comment: Isco.\n12:59 Comment: Ronaldo.\n13:3 Comment: That wasn't the worst cross by any means. He thought twice\n13:5 Comment: about it. Put it in the second time of thinking. Yeah, it's\n13:9 Comment: good ball and Thiago couldn't take any chances there. Couple\n13:12 Comment: of men behind him wearing white.\n13:25 Comment: Trying to get to the near post. We're trying to put some\n13:28 Comment: blocks on here.\n13:33 Comment: The likes of Iran could come in and make contact. He's strong\n13:36 Comment: in these kind of situations. Always under pressure but he\n13:40 Comment: does get a clean header on it. Takes the weight off by heading\n13:44 Comment: it down into the ground.\n13:55 Comment: Thiago. Caught in possession by Kroos. Hernandez.\n14:3 Comment: Always looking infield with his left foot from that right hand\n14:7 Comment: side but there was room that he'd vacated that Carvajal was\n14:12 Comment: trying to exploit.\n14:17 Comment: Artatura. Gabi.\n14:24 Comment: A little bit of a respite for those at the back for Atletico.\n14:28 Comment: Midfield men get on the ball. Mike Thiago here.\n14:41 Comment: Driesman.\n14:46 Comment: Well, goalkeeper started to come and Peran is in the end\n14:50 Comment: not going to take any risk with Mandzukic around. No, he dealt\n14:53 Comment: with it well then. Really did. Raul Garcia limbering up.\n14:57 Comment: Another of the stalwarts for Simeone.\n15:6 Comment: Casillas really, you could see that his defender was in charge.\n15:9 Comment: Still came out though.\n15:14 Comment: And again, you feel if Atletico are going to get the goal, of\n15:17 Comment: course, an away goal and a 1-1 draw would take them through.\n15:22 Comment: Exploitation of a set piece here would put them\n15:27 Comment: ahead on anger. It's another corner on the far side. They\n15:30 Comment: might try and get Raul Garcia on for this. He's really good in\n15:33 Comment: the air.\n15:36 Comment: Appealing for a bit of shirt pulling. Go Dean.\n15:51 Comment: Can the crowd Casillas?\n15:58 Comment: Put back.\n16:2 Comment: Behind by Crosbutt.\n16:6 Comment: I must say so of the assistant behind the goal, I think. Well,\n16:9 Comment: that's what they're keeping an eye on these kind of scuffles.\n16:12 Comment: That's what they should be anyway, the extra officials.\n16:15 Comment: There's plenty to keep your eye on.\n16:22 Comment: It's amazing defenders who dish it out in their own penalty\n16:27 Comment: area. Go up to the other end to try and get a goal and then\n16:30 Comment: complain it's being done to them.\n16:38 Comment: Ronaldo, bit of hesitation by Juanfran. He could let Real\n16:42 Comment: Madrid in here. Back to Ronaldo again.\n16:51 Comment: Sergio Ramos, great position he took up. Good contact too but\n16:56 Comment: it flew straight at Oblak. He's having a good game, Ramos.\n17:4 Comment: Just backpedaling slightly. Really trouble Oblak from that\n17:9 Comment: distance. Scored over 50 goals for Real Madrid.\n17:17 Comment: Gabby.\n17:24 Comment: Griezmann.\n17:28 Comment: Gabby again. Had a two-round trying to sneak in and maybe\n17:31 Comment: at least get a corner out of this. He's again over laboring\n17:37 Comment: the point. A significant setup for Atletico. Pick the bones\n17:44 Comment: out of that.\n18:1 Comment: Now Garcia still waits.\n18:8 Comment: What a great strike that was by Gabby. Went far enough for us\n18:12 Comment: to start thinking where it might have ended up.\n18:16 Comment: Kroos. Sergio Ramos pressed by Griezmann. Runs for Amos\n18:22 Comment: Rodriguez and then\n18:25 Comment: Dani Carvajal.\n18:33 Comment: Ronaldo staying for the moment more on the left. He's trying\n18:36 Comment: to get the ball I think and he has done once or twice on this\n18:39 Comment: side.\n18:42 Comment: Ramos.\n18:46 Comment: Heran.\n18:53 Comment: Pepe. Sergio Ramos. An intricate from Real Madrid.\n18:59 Comment: The missing players of course capable of embroidering a match\n19:5 Comment: a little bit better than some of their understudies.\n19:9 Comment: Get the free kick get out and we'll make their change now.\n19:12 Comment: Really good defending on that side. Hazus Gamis. Preventing\n19:17 Comment: the overlap. Well, it's Griezmann is coming off. A 23 goal\n19:23 Comment: outstanding player. 38% of their goals in the year 2015 he's\n19:28 Comment: got.\n19:31 Comment: He's been.\n19:35 Comment: Taken off sacrifice you might say. And a bite his tongue I\n19:40 Comment: think. Yeah. It's not a game you want to be replaced in if\n19:44 Comment: you're Griezmann. It's a game you want to settle with your\n19:46 Comment: skill. It's not been through a lack of work right effort from\n19:51 Comment: the Frenchman. He's got up and down and he gives you that place\n19:57 Comment: Yeah. And he did accept the handshake from Simeone. I think\n20:1 Comment: it'd be a dangerous thing not to do that.\n20:15 Comment: Certainly been kept out to pretty much of harm's way by\n20:19 Comment: Real Madrid Atletico.\n20:24 Comment: Disappointed he indicated that no one was backing up just going\n20:27 Comment: to that second ball and if he didn't win it cleanly it might\n20:30 Comment: have dropped and would have dropped into a slot for an\n20:34 Comment: ambitious midfield player. He's gone.\n20:45 Comment: I'm proud. Pepper.\n20:53 Comment: Passing here not too much of a problem. From here on. He needs\n20:59 Comment: to be crafted with great skill and it was by Horan then.\n21:5 Comment: Ronaldo. Well. It was a clear shooting opportunity and he\n21:11 Comment: might have damaged himself in this setting it. Yeah. All\n21:15 Comment: could want to strike cleanly that.\n21:22 Comment: Spinning on to it. Almost a case of trying too hard.\n21:28 Comment: Hit it too hard.\n21:32 Comment: Jolted the knee.\n21:39 Comment: Crisply on Cocaine. Sergio Ramos.\n21:46 Comment: He's enjoying this freedom further up the pitch. He\n21:50 Comment: often lifts them of course. One of the strong voices in the\n21:55 Comment: dressing room you can be sure of that.\n22:5 Comment: His teeth. His team have got to do that.\n22:12 Comment: In from Pepe.\n22:21 Comment: Three quarters of the way through the 90 minutes. It is\n22:26 Comment: still Real Mil Atletico Nil.\n22:35 Comment: Seems to have run that off now.\n22:43 Comment: And Raul Garcia brings. Plenty of similar\n22:49 Comment: qualities to the game. He's a scrapper. He's a big man.\n22:57 Comment: Plays probably made his name in attacking midfield play but\n23:0 Comment: often gets pushed right up front.\n23:5 Comment: Superb in the air.\n23:10 Comment: Here's Tiago. One front. Gabby did well.\n23:19 Comment: Wasn't an easy one for Pepe to clear. He's made good contact\n23:23 Comment: really. Contrario just committed himself out on that left\n23:27 Comment: side.\n23:31 Comment: Remember, Carlo Ancelotti's team concede. They would need to\n23:36 Comment: score two to go through.\n23:42 Comment: Hernandez.\n23:46 Comment: Here's Arditura. Juanfran.\n23:53 Comment: Arditura again. Oh, it was a lovely run from Cockett.\n23:59 Comment: Beautifully found.\n24:4 Comment: Just hoping he could steer it wider the goalkeeper rather than\n24:7 Comment: straight at him. They kick the moments when to attack\n24:11 Comment: Letico almost sit there. A rare effort on target. Not an easy\n24:15 Comment: header for Cockett.\n24:23 Comment: Sergio Ramos.\n24:29 Comment: Ronaldo running into trouble.\n24:34 Comment: Coco likewise has given it away. What's tipping as it so often\n24:40 Comment: can. When Ronaldo makes that extravagant type of contact but\n24:45 Comment: he's still feeling something. Yeah, maybe a little grimace.\n25:0 Comment: Marocco can't keep it.\n25:5 Comment: Contral early and cleverly to Ronaldo. Another example of\n25:12 Comment: when the attacker thinks there's an opening. Immediately, that\n25:18 Comment: space is shut down. Well, I think Hernandez was the only\n25:22 Comment: ball for him really.\n25:28 Comment: As I said, it wasn't an easy header at all. Manzuki saying,\n25:33 Comment: why didn't you back at it on for me but eyes in the back of\n25:36 Comment: the head came to mind.\n25:44 Comment: Raul Garcia. Manzukić.\n25:51 Comment: Rodriguez.\n26:2 Comment: James Rodriguez.\n26:9 Comment: The ultimate clash of fine margins.\n26:16 Comment: Deep into the eighth meeting between these two this season\n26:21 Comment: and Real Madrid still looking for a moment to give them a\n26:25 Comment: first victory. But a very prized victory in these\n26:29 Comment: circumstances. Just looking at his bench. Carlo Ancelotti\n26:34 Comment: hasn't got a great deal of options in terms of strikers.\n26:40 Comment: With the spite of injuries he's had.\n26:50 Comment: Sergio Ramos. Working with Isco.\n26:59 Comment: James Rodriguez who scored coming in played a couple of\n27:4 Comment: one twos and scored spectacularly at the weekend. Using\n27:7 Comment: his left foot from the right.\n27:22 Comment: Koke.\n27:27 Comment: Manzukić. And there again. Go left here.\n27:36 Comment: Pepe. Get some help from Varane.\n27:43 Comment: Another combustible moment.\n27:50 Comment: Garcia was at the heart of it. He's trying to get away from it.\n27:54 Comment: Referee might want to have a conversation.\n28:0 Comment: There's a wild swipe.\n28:15 Comment: He's had another excellent game. The center half.\n28:20 Comment: Strong in the air. Good distribution. Very composed.\n28:30 Comment: If it's shown to Raul Garcia he will miss the first leg of the\n28:34 Comment: semi-final. If of course they get there.\n28:40 Comment: Nowhere near the ball.\n28:46 Comment: He's booked Pepe as well.\n28:51 Comment: He's shoving off Raul Garcia. I think that was fought.\n28:55 Comment: Incidentally it's the third yellow card that gets you into\n28:59 Comment: trouble. It's not the case for Pepe.\n29:3 Comment: And not to serve a suspension in the next game like Raul Garcia is.\n29:7 Comment: The others are all wiped out. So Pepe shouldn't be inconvenienced\n29:11 Comment: by that unless of course he gets another yellow in this game.\n29:15 Comment: It's an attempt by UEFA to make sure that we don't have a\n29:20 Comment: final with a lot of players suspended.\n29:27 Comment: Here is Pepe.\n29:31 Comment: There was a spell 15 minutes or so ago. It looked like Real Madrid were\n29:35 Comment: really reaching the sort of level that they obviously need to beat\n29:39 Comment: this obdurate opponent. It's dropped off a bit since then\n29:43 Comment: hasn't it? It has. They've tried to maintain that intensity\n29:47 Comment: but it's not easy because Atletico just like a sponge they\n29:53 Comment: take it all and then they'll attack. They've been attacking in a measured way.\n29:57 Comment: They don't throw men forward too many men. Wonderful ball to Manzukic\n30:1 Comment: by Raul Garcia. Always a danger when a defender and goalkeeper get close\n30:6 Comment: to each other as Pepe and Casillas did then.\n30:10 Comment: You see the central midfielders. Adam Arder Turan who has been booked remember.\n30:17 Comment: And he gets a second booking. And there's a change in the dynamics here.\n30:23 Comment: Atletico down to 10 men.\n30:30 Comment: That's a classic case of the bouncing ball. He puts his foot up and does Sergio Ramos catch his studs.\n30:39 Comment: And Ramos is always going to make sure the referee knows about that challenge.\n30:45 Comment: He's already thinking how he's going to deal with the depletion.\n30:53 Comment: It's a silly challenge to make because you're the one leading with your studs.\n31:0 Comment: When you're on the yellow card.\n31:5 Comment: He thought he was going to be given the benefit of the doubt.\n31:11 Comment: And you can see the shock that followed.\n31:14 Comment: They do play close to the edge at Atletico Madrid but they haven't had many players sent off in their Champions League time.\n31:20 Comment: Thiago went in the last round and now at a significant time.\n31:29 Comment: Because Real Madrid have this extra man.\n31:34 Comment: Even if they need extra time, it will probably count.\n31:37 Comment: More an extra time.\n31:39 Comment: 14 minutes away from the slowest walk off the pitch in history.\n31:43 Comment: This one.\n31:45 Comment: But if they were attacking cautiously before, it's going to be even more so now.\n32:3 Comment: It's more a pat of consolation than sympathy for a bad decision.\n32:9 Comment: I think Simeone would have seen that coming.\n32:13 Comment: The kind of player himself who had some problems like that.\n32:17 Comment: Remember he was the nemesis of David Beckham in St. Etienne all those years ago.\n32:21 Comment: Playing for Argentina against England.\n32:32 Comment: Of course it's never straightforward.\n32:36 Comment: 11 against 10.\n32:41 Comment: Given what's been going on between these two clubs throughout the season at regular intervals.\n32:46 Comment: Real Madrid must feel that this is their chance for a win on their CV.\n32:54 Comment: And Ronaldo not far away from getting his head to provide that.\n32:59 Comment: Well you wouldn't expect it to be any easier to break down this Atletico team.\n33:5 Comment: If anything they've become even more stubborn.\n33:13 Comment: It's a fair way out to start thinking about playing for penalties.\n33:17 Comment: I think he's doing it.\n33:22 Comment: Mal Garcia just dropping in on the right here.\n33:29 Comment: Oh, it's Mandzukic. He's having a conversation as the game goes on with the assistant.\n33:33 Comment: Down beneath us. That leaves him one extra man light.\n33:36 Comment: He's recognised his responsibilities now.\n33:43 Comment: You can feel the extra optimism around the Bernabeu.\n33:47 Comment: And the fans are cheering.\n33:54 Comment: You can feel the extra optimism around the Bernabeu.\n34:4 Comment: High foot again but in the penalty area.\n34:6 Comment: So easy to give. Here's Sergio Ramos.\n34:8 Comment: On the burst. On the spin.\n34:14 Comment: And counter-attacking is going to be a pretty lonely job for any Atletico player.\n34:25 Comment: James Rodriguez.\n34:27 Comment: Hernandez!\n34:32 Comment: It's still 0-0.\n34:37 Comment: Another chance goes back in. Not an easy one but he does well to stay strong.\n34:45 Comment: Here's Isco. Making the angle better.\n34:48 Comment: And then the technique not so good.\n34:55 Comment: He's done the hard part.\n34:58 Comment: Oblak comes out well to close down the angle and get a touch on it.\n35:2 Comment: Again, it's good goalkeeping. He has a little glance at him.\n35:5 Comment: Hernandez.\n35:9 Comment: Strong play.\n35:12 Comment: Just right to stay on his feet.\n35:14 Comment: Strong play by somebody who...\n35:16 Comment: ...earns his living scoring goals.\n35:19 Comment: That's what he's all about.\n35:21 Comment: I still wouldn't bet against him being the...\n35:24 Comment: ...man who comes up with the decider here.\n35:29 Comment: That's why he probably doesn't start. He didn't start regularly at Manchester United.\n35:32 Comment: He hasn't been starting regularly for Mexico as much as in the past now.\n35:37 Comment: They ask more of a striker than just goals.\n35:48 Comment: Sergio Ramos.\n35:50 Comment: And he's got a chance.\n35:55 Comment: Dani Carvajal.\n35:59 Comment: That's...\n36:0 Comment: ...Nemes Rodriguez. Not really needing to be so ambitious but any...\n36:4 Comment: ...little deflection.\n36:5 Comment: Oblak still...\n36:7 Comment: ...pulling out the barricades in brilliant fashion.\n36:9 Comment: Can do no wrong.\n36:12 Comment: Really off his line quickly to close down Hernandez, that previous one.\n36:21 Comment: Mandzukic.\n36:24 Comment: Raul Garcia.\n36:28 Comment: Connected by Tiago.\n36:33 Comment: He's caught ahead of the ball.\n36:36 Comment: What a chance that was.\n36:39 Comment: To play Javier Hernandez in again.\n36:46 Comment: Just forced the issue.\n36:48 Comment: Cut the pass.\n36:50 Comment: Rodriguez.\n36:57 Comment: Kabe.\n36:59 Comment: Tiago.\n37:5 Comment: Isco stepping in.\n37:15 Comment: Contral.\n37:18 Comment: Ronaldo in the middle.\n37:20 Comment: Peran.\n37:21 Comment: Steps forward.\n37:25 Comment: Go right.\n37:26 Comment: To the left. Back to the right.\n37:32 Comment: Sergio Ramos.\n37:34 Comment: It's another go at it.\n37:36 Comment: Ooh, Oblak needed to be told.\n37:38 Comment: There was no Real Madrid player anywhere near him.\n37:41 Comment: No, first thing really he's done wrong over the two legs.\n37:45 Comment: He needed a show.\n37:46 Comment: One front could see the picture.\n37:49 Comment: I don't know whether there was a deflection on the ball that he thought he was saving a corner.\n37:52 Comment: I don't know. Anyway, it is a corner now.\n38:1 Comment: Kabe.\n38:8 Comment: Wow, but again the assistant...\n38:10 Comment: ...actually on the line there had a very good view of it.\n38:12 Comment: Much better than the goalkeeper.\n38:14 Comment: And a very good view of it.\n38:15 Comment: Much better than any of us and much better than the referee.\n38:18 Comment: Well, they should be getting those right.\n38:24 Comment: All the Real Madrid players convinced.\n38:26 Comment: And it should have been another corner. We can't tell from that angle.\n38:44 Comment: There has been a lot of posturing and a lot of competing for the ball.\n38:49 Comment: But I have seen worse contests.\n38:52 Comment: In terms of over-aggression.\n38:54 Comment: It's Pepe's shot for the corner.\n38:55 Comment: But yeah, obviously the assistant thought it came off a Real boot.\n39:0 Comment: Well, they're all having a little drink now down by the dugout.\n39:3 Comment: Those Real players.\n39:5 Comment: Interesting to see whether...\n39:7 Comment: ...Carlo Ancelotti does make a change as we approach the 90 minutes.\n39:12 Comment: And prepare for extra time.\n39:15 Comment: Six minutes past stoppage time.\n39:17 Comment: There would be a good chunk of that I would have thought.\n39:28 Comment: And we're going to bring on...\n39:30 Comment: ...José María Jiménez.\n39:35 Comment: In this quest, I think, for penalties.\n39:44 Comment: It's really not going to help us make the decision.\n39:46 Comment: But it's already been made by...\n39:49 Comment: ...the assistant behind the line.\n39:51 Comment: And it's...\n39:53 Comment: ...Manzucchi.\n39:55 Comment: What was it?\n39:56 Comment: Oh, it's five.\n39:59 Comment: Thiago.\n40:11 Comment: Thiago having a look.\n40:12 Comment: His number was up.\n40:15 Comment: Well, he's a centre-half normally, isn't he?\n40:17 Comment: Jiménez, whether he's...\n40:18 Comment: He played against England...\n40:20 Comment: ...in San Paolo.\n40:22 Comment: And Suárez...\n40:23 Comment: ...played well.\n40:27 Comment: It's only 20.\n40:29 Comment: It's only his third appearance against Real Madrid.\n40:31 Comment: But he has scored a goal against them.\n40:34 Comment: And they've gone with the extra central defender.\n40:37 Comment: Three at the back now.\n40:44 Comment: So, Raúl García is definitely...\n40:47 Comment: ...in midfield.\n40:48 Comment: Just leaving Manzucchi.\n40:50 Comment: Trying to keep...\n40:51 Comment: ...Real Madrid occupied.\n40:57 Comment: Ronaldo.\n41:1 Comment: Ooh, that's an interesting one there.\n41:6 Comment: Inside the area, Isco fell out.\n41:8 Comment: I think the challenge was in.\n41:10 Comment: Well, Juanfran was the man.\n41:12 Comment: And I think he might have been worried for a second there.\n41:15 Comment: Stretching for the ball.\n41:21 Comment: Pepe.\n41:29 Comment: Hernández.\n41:33 Comment: It should be Oblaks, and it is.\n41:34 Comment: It wasn't.\n41:37 Comment: Automatically the goalkeeper's ball.\n41:42 Comment: Is the Isco incident.\n41:48 Comment: Put the brakes on, Juanfran.\n41:49 Comment: Yeah, he did.\n41:50 Comment: And then Isco goes over his legs, but no pen.\n42:7 Comment: Ronaldo.\n42:9 Comment: He's in.\n42:11 Comment: Javier Hernández.\n42:13 Comment: The ball is in, eventually.\n42:22 Comment: They finally managed it.\n42:26 Comment: Atlético's stiff resistance is broken.\n42:31 Comment: We've got to give great credit to that man.\n42:35 Comment: 50 goals this season.\n42:38 Comment: But when it mattered...\n42:40 Comment: He played the sensible pass.\n42:41 Comment: The right pass in the circumstances.\n42:45 Comment: To give that boy a tap-in.\n42:49 Comment: It is 895 days since he last scored in the Champions League.\n42:55 Comment: That was for Manchester United against Braga.\n42:59 Comment: And he wasn't going to miss that one.\n43:2 Comment: It's a lovely little one-two with James.\n43:4 Comment: Always got his head up on the stretch.\n43:6 Comment: There you go. Put that one in.\n43:9 Comment: And he does.\n43:10 Comment: And what a time to create and score a goal here.\n43:13 Comment: In the tightest of games.\n43:16 Comment: That might just decide it.\n43:20 Comment: The celebration tells you how hard Real Madrid have worked.\n43:23 Comment: That's just a night.\n43:24 Comment: Let alone over the other sevens against Atlético this season.\n43:30 Comment: Huge relief around this stadium.\n43:32 Comment: But...\n43:35 Comment: If they were to concede and Atlético are going to throw everything at it, of course.\n43:39 Comment: 1-1 would put them through.\n43:43 Comment: Well, just as he's put on three centre-halves.\n43:45 Comment: Jiménez now going up top.\n43:46 Comment: He's getting...\n43:47 Comment: Trying to challenge for the ball there.\n43:49 Comment: And that's the moment that can change all the smiles off the Real faces.\n43:55 Comment: There cannot be extra time, of course.\n44:2 Comment: All right, we've got a scuffle on the far side.\n44:10 Comment: And there's...\n44:11 Comment: Is at the bottom of the scuffle.\n44:13 Comment: He's got cramp, I think.\n44:24 Comment: Atlético will not leave here without a fight.\n44:26 Comment: I can tell you that.\n44:29 Comment: Quite literally.\n44:32 Comment: But what a moment.\n44:33 Comment: What a moment.\n44:38 Comment: But what a moment for Javier Hernández.\n44:41 Comment: Who's been a bit part player at best here.\n44:44 Comment: Frustration has been written over his features.\n44:48 Comment: He made a goal for Ronaldo at the same end of the stadium.\n44:51 Comment: In quite similar fashion on Saturday.\n44:53 Comment: And didn't really celebrate his part in the goal.\n44:58 Comment: It's because he's gone down with cramp and the Atlético players wanting to get up.\n45:2 Comment: That's what the fuss was about.\n45:7 Comment: It was Raul Garcia, couldn't keep it down.\n45:13 Comment: Just a burst into the box.\n45:16 Comment: And for a change, they do find the spare man.\n45:18 Comment: It's not happened often.\n45:28 Comment: And his green eyes look up.\n45:31 Comment: In celebration.\n45:35 Comment: And he's going to be replaced by...\n45:39 Comment: ...Jesse.\n45:42 Comment: Who is an attacker.\n45:44 Comment: Elia Remendi is also down there.\n45:48 Comment: Well, Simeone, you know, I mean...\n45:51 Comment: That's how it goes with substitutions.\n45:53 Comment: He must be kicking himself.\n45:54 Comment: He just put on...\n45:55 Comment: ...him and Ez the young centre-half.\n45:57 Comment: And here we would dearly

gain.\n46:36 Comment: Here in Spain.\n46:44 Comment: The next issue is the...\n46:47 Comment: ...the ball for added time.\n46:48 Comment: It hasn't gone up yet, has it?\n46:53 Comment: Maybe should have done.\n46:54 Comment: No, it's about to now.\n46:56 Comment: I think.\n46:58 Comment: Oh, that's it.\n47:2 Comment: Talking five, I think.\n47:14 Comment: There's still time for Atletico

    "summary": "The dynamic clash between Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid, with Real Madrid eventually triumphing with a solitary goal, unfolded under the star-studded lights of the Santiago Bernabeu in an atmosphere thick with anticipation. From the very first touch of the ball, it was clear that the evening would be a roller-coaster of emotions for fans and players alike. The first half encompassed a relentless battle of strategies, individual brilliance, and tactical resilience from both teams.\n\nIn the opening minutes, Real Madrid attempted to exploit any gaps in Atletico’s well-drilled defense. The game saw an early attempt by Real Madrid to get in behind the rigid Atletico defense, but a cross from a substantial distance by Real resulted in nothing noteworthy as it flew wide. This approach hinted at the challenge Real Madrid faced in trying to penetrate a side well-known for their defensive astuteness under Diego Simeone’s guidance. \n\nSergio Ramos, operating with his usual combativeness, won a crucial challenge early on, followed by decisive touches from Pepe and efforts from James Rodriguez to inject creativity into Real Madrid’s forward play. The game witnessed an optimistic effort from Javier Hernandez, aiming to claim his stake as a starter despite irregular appearances. Throughout his loan stint from Manchester United, chances had been sparse, leaving Hernandez with much to prove on such a grand stage. \n\nAtletico, ever the masters of tactical discipline, were content to absorb pressure, limiting Real Madrid’s fluidity and rhythm by keeping their compact shape. In response, Real Madrid had phases where their impressive statistics shone through - nine goals in the previous three Champions League games contrasted sharply against Atletico’s sole goal achieved via a penalty shootout triumph in the round of 16. Regardless, it was plain to see that goals were a scarce commodity against a team whose hallmark was defensive solidity.\n\nReal Madrid sought to leverage the inclusion of Fabio Coentrao, filling in due to Marcelo's suspension, hoping for creative sparks on the flanks. Despite Real's attempts to control the tempo, the disruptive nature of Atletico’s game plan—rooted deeply in tight marking, physical contests, and calculated fouls—aimed to break any developing momentum for the home side. \n\nThis high-stakes tussle also had its share of bruising encounters. An incident involving Sergio Ramos left him writhing, indicating the intense physical battles shaping the game. The combative spirit was palpable, epitomized by the likes of Mario Mandzukic in Atletico’s forward lines, who relentlessly grappled with Real’s defenders. The duel between Ronaldo and Atletico's defenders was particularly gripping, as the prolific forward tried to create an impact from the wings and occasionally from a central position, though with limited success.\n\nPersistence combined with defensive acumen defined Real’s play, with players like Varane and Pepe, each playing through physical concerns, showcasing their reliability at the back. By easing Atletico’s opportunities, they endeavored to maintain possession and launch attacks through Danny Carvajal's overlapping runs and crosses, hoping to find an elusive breakthrough.\n\nAdmittedly, the challenges of breaking down Atletico’s defensive lines were palpable, even for a side brimming with talent. Without Luka Modric’s midfield machinations, the onus was on Isco to step up and fill the creative void, even as the team missed the attacking prowess brought by Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema. Real Madrid’s tactical adjustments highlighted the adaptability Carlo Ancelotti required from his team, as the articulate passing of Kroos and the incisive dribbling of James Rodriguez attempted to pierce Atletico’s rearguard.\n\nIn contrast, Atletico’s offensive forays were more measured yet dangerous in their simplicity. The threat posed by Griezmann’s pace on counters was evident, serving as a reminder of Atletico's capacity to exploit transitions rapidly. Atletico’s set-piece threats remained constants, although they struggled to manufacture clear-cut chances within the opening exchanges.\n\nAs the game progressed beyond the early minutes, the anticipation for a breakthrough became tangible. Both sets of supporters voiced their passionate support for their respective teams, creating a fervent atmosphere that underscored the high stakes.\n\nReal Madrid’s intermittent spells of control were punctuated by efforts that either failed to find their target or were thwarted by the resolute Oblak in Atletico’s goal.
