standard captain, Dirac.\n5:34 Comment: Oh, brilliant play from Santi Cazorla when he picks this ball up,\n5:37 Comment: little one-two, he's in round the back,\n5:39 Comment: he's not got much to pick out, he's tried to play it into the path of Danny Welbeck,\n5:43 Comment: he never really made an angle for him,\n5:46 Comment: he just put it into an area where he thought Welbeck might get the last touch on it.\n5:49 Comment: Brilliant play, once again.\n5:50 Comment: And a cross again from Cazorla,\n5:51 Comment: it was a fantastic time here at Arsenal the last few weeks.\n5:56 Comment:

Comment: It's really played as a two-and-every,\n6:52 Comment: Kokeland and Cazorla playing a little bit deeper,\n6:54 Comment: and no-one from Monaco has been asked to pick him up.\n6:58 Comment: Welbeck trying to get in there.\n7:1 Comment: The referee sees a problem with a challenge of Danny Welbeck,\n7:5 Comment: and it's a free kick to Monaco.\n7:7 Comment: No need either there, George, was there?\n7:8 Comment: Eldersson was under real pressure going towards his own goal there.\n7:12 Comment: At best he would have kicked out for a throw into Arsenal.\n7:15 Comment: Welbeck just pushing the back there, relieved the pressure.\n7:18 Comment: And...\n7:19 Comment: The fact that the overcoat is missing will tell you\n7:22 Comment: it's a pleasant enough evening in north London.\n7:25 Comment: Monaco's free kick to be taken by the Croatian international goalkeeper,\n7:30 Comment: Daniel Suicic.\n7:32 Comment: Ever present in the Monaco team this season.\n7:38 Comment:

decision there.\n8:24 Comment: The referee looked at his assistant for some help.\n8:27 Comment: He wasn't going to point one direction or the other,\n8:30 Comment: and eventually gave Arsenal the throw, and it was.\n8:45 Comment: And...\n8:46 Comment: It's Bellarine,\n8:50 Comment: Bertha Zacker.\n8:56 Comment: And for Koscielny.\n9:0 Comment: Arsene Wenger indicating it's a 180-minute game.\n9:4 Comment: Gibbs' touch was rather heavy.\n9:6 Comment: Wallace able to intervene.\n9:8 Comment: It's a 180-minute game, he said.\n9:10 Comment: You don't need to do it all in one night.\n9:12 Comment: But, obviously, it would be helpful if they get...\n9:16 Comment: created for themselves a decent cushion to take to Monaco...\n9:21 Comment: in three weeks.\n9:22 Comment: The crowd love that, you know, when they see Alexis Sanchez chasing back,\n9:25 Comment: when they've given the ball away.\n9:27 Comment: Wins back possession, the ball starts off,\n9:29 Comment: another attack for Arsenal, really gets the crowd behind him.\n9:32 Comment: And it's good moving earlier on there.\n9:34 Comment: When Sanchez comes infield, he leaves that space for Kieran Gibbs to run into.\n9:38 Comment: Derard, the skipper for Monaco, didn't go with him on that occasion.\n9:43 Comment: Now a cover for Subasic.\n9:46 Comment: Petticoza, the goalkeeper for the Croatian side.\n9:49 Comment: He was the Croatian goalkeeper until he retired.\n9:52 Comment: Now this is the man, Daniel Subasic.\n9:58 Comment: Martial.\n10:2 Comment: Kondopia.\n10:6 Comment: Girard.\n10:8 Comment: Campiño.\n10:11 Comment: And there's the ball.\n10:12 Comment: The ball is in the net.\n10:13 Comment: It's a good ball.\n10:14 Comment: Petticoza's shot.\n10:16 Comment: The left-back, Eldersang.\n10:18 Comment: Berbatov.\n10:19 Comment: Eldersang.\n10:23 Comment: Campiño.\n10:26 Comment: And that will drive the coach mad because they're about retaining possession.\n10:30 Comment: Silver the top for him.\n10:32 Comment: And that's out.\n10:33 Comment: And again, the officials look at each other.\n10:36 Comment: And finally the referee says it's a corner to Arsenal.\n10:39 Comment: Yeah, I thought it was.\n10:40 Comment: I mean, you just see the coming together here between Wallace and Ozil.\n10:44 Comment: They got the last touch quickly.\n10:45 Comment: Towards Giroud.\n10:46 Comment: And out for a goal kick.\n10:47 Comment: Yeah, Arsenal do do this.\n10:48 Comment: I've seen them in the FA Cup match against Middlesbrough where they get good movement off the ball.\n10:53 Comment: Take the corner kick quickly.\n10:55 Comment: You can see that the Monaco defence weren't really picking up.\n10:59 Comment: Giroud.\n11:0 Comment: Arsenal only had two players in the box on that occasion.\n11:2 Comment: There's the ball over the top from Alexis Sanchez.\n11:4 Comment: Good movement from Ozil initially.\n11:6 Comment: I think they were trying to claim handball there.\n11:8 Comment: I don't think the referee could see it from that angle anyway, could he?\n11:11 Comment: I mean, he's got no view whatsoever.\n11:13 Comment: He's looking for his assistant.\n11:15 Comment: Trying to help him out.\n11:16 Comment: If there was handball, I don't think there was.\n11:22 Comment: I have to say, it's the strangest thing.\n11:24 Comment: They set up the assistant referees on diagonals.\n11:27 Comment: And then they put the assistant assistant, the fifth man, the fourth man, on the same side as the assistant referee.\n11:35 Comment: So there's a blank space exactly where you were saying.\n11:39 Comment: Yeah.\n11:40 Comment: It's a very strange way to set it up.\n11:41 Comment: Well, you have to ask a UEFA about that, John.\n11:44 Comment: You said the championship derby player has never been the poem in the realm because it doesn't look like they are.\n11:51 Comment: No.\n11:52 Comment: Pepe Lobel.\n11:54 Comment: Pregnant.\n11:55 Comment: He was the coach, myells.\n11:59 Comment: I don't know where that flyer came from.\n12:3 Comment: Your wife is in France.\n12:5 Comment: What?\n12:6 Comment: I'm seeing應該 like était il ground sjogo.\n12:8 Comment: Ce n'est rien.\n12:10 Comment: So that's a Bayern driver, alright.\n12:12 Comment: Rosa.\n12:13 Comment: but they got away with it.\n12:15 Comment: Bellerin got away with that too.\n12:18 Comment: Yeah, it wasn't very good there, was it, from Wallace?\n12:20 Comment: Went back towards his goalkeeper,\n12:21 Comment: who read the situation well to come out and help him out.\n12:24 Comment: But they kept the ball there reasonably OK,\n12:26 Comment: but without going anywhere.\n12:27 Comment: And ends up back at Super 6,\n12:28 Comment: and it's just a long, hopeful ball downfield\n12:30 Comment: trying to pick out Martial.\n12:31 Comment: Just give the ball away back to Arsenal,\n12:33 Comment: which could be very costly for them.\n12:40 Comment: Referee having words, not quite sure why,\n12:44 Comment: maybe a little this incident.\n12:47 Comment: Angierou.\n12:49 Comment: Abdenoore.\n12:50 Comment: Just looked like two lads competing for the ball,\n12:52 Comment: didn't see a great deal wrong with the challenger from Abdenoore.\n12:55 Comment: Angierou.\n12:58 Comment: Mertesacker.\n13:0 Comment: Coquelin.\n13:1 Comment: Found its way to Cazorla.\n13:4 Comment: Back to Mertesacker.\n13:11 Comment: Coquelin.\n13:13 Comment: In goes Patinho.\n13:24 Comment: It's Wallace.\n13:28 Comment: Touré.\n13:34 Comment: Touré sweeping the cross.\n13:37 Comment: Martial on it.\n13:38 Comment: Mertesacker.\n13:38 Comment: Back then with Aldous.\n13:43 Comment: Martial.\n13:43 Comment: poor ball in wasn't it\n13:48 Comment: best bit of play we've seen from\n13:50 Comment: Monaco they changed\n13:51 Comment: the direction of the play there from that right hand side\n13:54 Comment: over to the left very well\n13:56 Comment: indeed you've seen that Bellerin got\n13:57 Comment: caught too close to the two centre\n13:59 Comment: there was a lot of space for Martial\n14:1 Comment: over this left hand side if he holds his position\n14:4 Comment: he could get good possession\n14:5 Comment: for Monaco and relieve some of the pressure that's\n14:7 Comment: on the back four\n14:8 Comment: meanwhile a whistle from the German referee and it's a free kick\n14:18 Comment: Monaco\n14:26 Comment: forward goes Abdenour\n14:28 Comment: they don't give many away Monaco\n14:32 Comment: nor do they score many\n14:34 Comment: but that has created\n14:36 Comment: a great record for them\n14:38 Comment: four goals scored one against in the group\n14:40 Comment: as they won their group\n14:42 Comment: dangerously in there flags up though\n14:47 Comment: but they can't\n14:48 Comment: they just won the two\n14:50 Comment: Monaco players just straight into an\n14:52 Comment: offside position and Arsenal as you can\n14:54 Comment: see don't mind Mark who plays Zono\n14:56 Comment: maybe between three or four of them in offside\n14:58 Comment: positions there when it was delivered in\n15:0 Comment: the assistant's flag went up quite late but he was\n15:2 Comment: offside\n15:3 Comment: Monaco don't tend to\n15:8 Comment: play as they do in the game but they do play as they do in the game\n15:8 Comment: they do play as they do in the game\n15:9 Comment: they don't concede many they've won defeat in their\n15:14 Comment: 17 matches they won't group see the\n15:17 Comment: qualifying group scoring only four goals\n15:20 Comment: but conceding only one so that's their\n15:24 Comment: style this is for Arsenal to break down\n15:37 Comment: long from a speed of towards the end of the game\n15:50 Comment: which makes Spielberg angry\n15:52 Comment: was here set in front of the back for his\n15:52 Comment: was here set in front of the back for his interest on this kicked out by not the\n15:54 Comment: interest on this kicked out by not the\n15:55 Comment: interest on this kicked out by not the true centre-或者 challenge is you do\n15:58 Comment: true centre- neutrality\n15:58 Comment: true centre- neutrality in here it's actually Fabinho\n16:1 Comment: in here it's actually Fabinho this is long for martial martial\n16:3 Comment: this is long for martial martial\n16:5 Comment: martial school show me gets it away\n16:8 Comment: How often have we seen that over the years?\n16:10 Comment: Berbatov frustrated\n16:11 Comment: by an assistant referee's flag.\n16:16 Comment: We can see now, look at how Monaco are trying to pressurise Arsenal\n16:19 Comment: not to play out into midfield.\n16:22 Comment: They're going to make Oshpina kick it downfield\n16:23 Comment: and then they should win these aerial challenges more often.\n16:26 Comment: They look like they're better in the air, Monaco,\n16:30 Comment: than the Arsenal players.\n16:31 Comment: I've seen so far, Arsenal trying to play their normal passing game\n16:34 Comment: just can't quite get space at the moment.\n16:37 Comment: It's all right in these areas, but it's further up the field\n16:39 Comment: that they just struggle.\n16:41 Comment: Gasola.\n16:42 Comment: Mertensacker.\n16:45 Comment: Koscielny.\n16:53 Comment: Football, of course, is just about\n16:55 Comment: moving in sin flair, but it's about organisation.\n16:58 Comment: Monaco are very well organised.\n17:1 Comment: Arsenal will know that.\n17:3 Comment: Know that from their recent record.\n17:6 Comment: Arsenal.\n17:7 Comment: Sly.\n17:7 Comment: Move forward.\n17:8 Comment: But then spins off Welbeck.\n17:12 Comment: Monaco have it again.\n17:13 Comment: Berbatov.\n17:15 Comment: Welbeck should really stay a bit wider, George.\n17:17 Comment: I think he's getting in the way.\n17:18 Comment: You know, with Oseo playing a little bit higher up the field as well,\n17:21 Comment: closer to Giroud,\n17:23 Comment: there's no-one really wide on this right-hand side.\n17:26 Comment: Bellerin hasn't really got forward as often as he would like\n17:29 Comment: because he's got two players there.\n17:30 Comment: He's got Martial, who's pinning him back.\n17:32 Comment: You've also got Elders in the left full-back.\n17:34 Comment: But Welbeck wants to go infield all the time\n17:36 Comment: rather than trying to stay a bit wider.\n17:37 Comment: He doesn't spread the play for Arsenal.\n17:40 Comment: It's Koscielny.\n17:42 Comment: Gibbs.\n17:58 Comment: It's a bit like the Highbury Library\n18:1 Comment: in the Emirates Stadium at the moment.\n18:2 Comment: Not too much for the Arsenal fans to get enthused about\n18:6 Comment: as we\n18:7 Comment: move to 18 minutes.\n18:11 Comment: But of course,\n18:13 Comment: there's more than one way to skin a cat.\n18:16 Comment: Winning the Champions League is not\n18:18 Comment: about one way of playing or another.\n18:21 Comment: It's about adapting to circumstances.\n18:23 Comment: Welbeck.\n18:26 Comment: Oseo.\n18:28 Comment: That was\n18:29 Comment: Bellerin who lost control of it\n18:31 Comment: and he's given away the free kick.\n18:32 Comment: That was better.\n18:34 Comment: Koscielny made a run forward, got in between the midfield and\n18:37 Comment: the back four of Monaco.\n18:39 Comment: Played the ball into Bellerin.\n18:41 Comment: Eldersen come back with a challenge.\n18:44 Comment: I think he just clipped Oseo.\n18:45 Comment: There's the ball forward from Oseo.\n18:46 Comment: Trying to pick out Bellerin.\n18:47 Comment: Monaco defender came across and he just clipped him.\n18:51 Comment: Went over.\n18:52 Comment: Referee.\n18:53 Comment: Giving Monaco the free kick.\n18:54 Comment: But you're quite right.\n18:55 Comment: The stadium, George, is very quiet, very subdued at the moment.\n18:58 Comment: And Arsenal, there's no real pace to their game.\n19:3 Comment: And here comes Berbatov.\n19:7 Comment: Moutinho.\n19:9 Comment: Ending at nothing.\n19:11 Comment: Just an apology there to Berbatov.\n19:13 Comment: I don't know why.\n19:13 Comment: I mean, this is what was there to be taken.\n19:15 Comment: Just didn't quite catch it in the manner he would like.\n19:24 Comment: Arsenal do have a magnificent record in the Champions League,\n19:26 Comment: but they have gone out of the stage in the last four seasons.\n19:30 Comment: They get out of the group and then they can't quite take it that stage further.\n19:35 Comment: This is the big ask.\n19:37 Comment: Of Arsene Wenger's team.\n19:39 Comment: Can they move on from here?\n19:41 Comment: And they've got, I suppose, a decent draw.\n19:44 Comment: Monaco wouldn't be one of the heavyweights.\n19:48 Comment: And deemed to be such.\n19:50 Comment: Manchester City have Barcelona last night.\n19:53 Comment: But, yeah.\n19:55 Comment: Arsenal have got to make more of an impression than they're doing.\n19:59 Comment: That was a lovely piece of defending there from Koscielny\n20:1 Comment: because it was a great ball in from Turi, the young full-back,\n20:3 Comment: came forward down the right-hand side.\n20:5 Comment: Wasn't too many. Monaco played. It was a great ball in from Turi, the young full-back, came forward down the right-hand side.\n20:7 Comment: Only one really was Berbatov,\n20:9 Comment: but Koscielny came back with a fantastic covering edit.\n20:12 Comment: And it was just a slight push there from a Monaco player to give away the free kick.\n20:16 Comment: He's been in good form recently, Koscielny.\n20:18 Comment: Azaz Mertizaka, performing a very good partnership this season, the two-cent half.\n20:25 Comment: This is... back with Wallace.\n20:30 Comment: Subasic.\n20:36 Comment: Berbatov got the better of Mertizaka there.\n20:45 Comment: Perhaps an opportunity for Martial.\n20:50 Comment: Girard.\n20:55 Comment: He's pressured by Kokel Abbot.\n20:58 Comment: He's detained the possession.\n21:1 Comment: And now it's Abdi Noor.\n21:6 Comment: Abdi Noor still.\n21:7 Comment: Abdi Noor.\n21:8 Comment: Ooh, a little chip in there.\n21:10 Comment: Was he looking for Berbatov?\n21:11 Comment: He certainly was. George was a great run from the centre-half, wasn't he?\n21:14 Comment: He's in the ball again.\n21:16 Comment: But here goes Welbeck.\n21:19 Comment: Oh, poor ball.\n21:22 Comment: Turi, cut it.\n21:27 Comment: Elderson.\n21:30 Comment: Martial.\n21:32 Comment: Seeking Berbatov.\n21:35 Comment: He's tumbled under the challenge.\n21:36 Comment: Gipps.\n21:40 Comment: He has the guile, but the guile wasn't enough there.\n21:50 Comment: Cazorla.\n21:53 Comment: Welbeck.\n22:4 Comment: Caplan.\n22:6 Comment: Sanchez.\n22:8 Comment: Of whom not much has been seen so far.\n22:11 Comment: But here he goes.\n22:12 Comment: Alexis Sanchez.\n22:14 Comment: Little trip there.\n22:17 Comment: Bellerin couldn't get there.\n22:19 Comment: And it ends as a corner kick to Arsenal.\n22:21 Comment: I thought it was a free kick.\n22:22 Comment: We've got to be honest.\n22:23 Comment: I thought the challenge there from Bellerin.\n22:26 Comment: And Elderson.\n22:27 Comment: Certainly didn't play the ball on that occasion.\n22:30 Comment: Just a slight injury there, I think, to Danny Welbeck.\n22:32 Comment: He's just gone down.\n22:33 Comment: Arsenal playing it too slowly, George.\n22:36 Comment: Taking too many touches.\n22:38 Comment: I think they need to sharpen things up.\n22:39 Comment: One and two touch.\n22:40 Comment: Make the ball move a bit quicker, a little bit more often.\n22:43 Comment: Keep their width and get some crosses into the box.\n22:46 Comment: They haven't really done enough of that.\n22:47 Comment: There's the injury, slight injury to Welbeck.\n22:50 Comment: I think it was Fabinho who came across and made the challenge.\n22:52 Comment: Just there.\n22:52 Comment: That little...\n22:53 Comment: Just stuck his leg out.\n22:55 Comment: Yeah, Bellerin.\n22:56 Comment: Certainly Elderson went over the top of it.\n22:59 Comment: More often than not, you get a free kick for that.\n23:0 Comment: But referees give Arsenal this corner.\n23:3 Comment: But...\n23:7 Comment: Be taken by Sanchez.\n23:14 Comment: Oh, got a touch from Giroud.\n23:17 Comment: But...\n23:18 Comment: Under pressure from Wallace.\n23:21 Comment: He couldn't direct it on...\n23:22 Comment: Yeah, there was plenty of Monaco players in and around.\n23:24 Comment: He was only Arsenal player.\n23:25 Comment: You could see two or three players there.\n23:27 Comment: Wallace being one.\n23:29 Comment: Obdeneu being another, as well as Bebetov.\n23:33 Comment: Just going to...\n23:33 Comment: He's going to get his head around the target there.\n23:34 Comment: Giroud.\n23:38 Comment: Eight in his last 11 games, Olivier Giroud.\n23:41 Comment: And assists as well.\n23:44 Comment: And then come back from injury.\n23:48 Comment: In the best form for a long time.\n23:52 Comment: His lay-off.\n23:53 Comment: Welbeck.\n23:57 Comment: Stumble from Dani Welbeck.\n23:58 Comment: And the referee says foul.\n24:3 Comment: Will he be able to ferm?\n24:5 Comment: Sorry, shall we say?\n24:6 Comment: Oh!\n24:7 Comment: offs to archery NoMeand's bestker.\n24:10 Comment: For the first time here as I said he did work the ball for the right bit

Comment: the goalie\n33:47 Comment: because I think when he goes in\n33:48 Comment: closer to Giroud\n33:49 Comment: what happens is\n33:50 Comment: is Elderson\n33:50 Comment: the left

what Leonardo Jardim would have wanted.\n38:31 Comment: Monaco don't give much away and they pick off the odd goal here and there.\n38:37 Comment: And now Arsenal, having not really threatened,\n38:39 Comment: are really up against it.\n38:41 Comment: You've got to win that 50-50, though.\n38:43 Comment: On that left-hand side there, when Welbeck was in with Turi,\n38:46 Comment: you've got to make sure you go in there with your full force,\n38:49 Comment: make sure you come out with the ball.\n38:51 Comment: He sort of pulled his leg out of the way.\n38:54 Comment: Ball was played from Turi into Moutinho, onto Kondogbia,\n38:57 Comment: strike came in and a huge deflection off Mertesacker.\n39:1 Comment: It went flying past Ospina and the Arsenal goal.\n39:5 Comment: We're hoping that goal might try and liven Arsenal up,\n39:8 Comment: because the crowd here have been very subdued so far.\n39:11 Comment: I think they've been in the game for more than 40 minutes or so.\n39:14 Comment: But it's almost as if Arsenal weren't expecting that to happen,\n39:18 Comment: that this was going to be routine, that Monaco don't score much.\n39:23 Comment: It's up to Arsenal to wake it up here.\n39:25 Comment: And maybe they will.\n39:27 Comment: To thaw that, no.\n39:28 Comment: Wallace cuts it out.\n39:32 Comment: It's not as if they weren't warned.\n39:34 Comment: We all knew Monaco don't score many.\n39:36 Comment: They won the group.\n39:39 Comment: The qualifying group see by scoring four goals and conceding one in six matches.\n39:45 Comment: So it's not as if they're a flamboyant team.\n39:49 Comment: Fenn will give nothing away and score the odd one.\n39:55 Comment: That was Giroud, but he was never in control of the header.\n39:58 Comment: Yeah, he was under a bit of pressure there when the ball was delivered in,\n40:1 Comment: not a free header for him.\n40:3 Comment: Ellison was the closest to him, just lobbed in there from Gibbs, 50-50.\n40:8 Comment: Very unusual to score from that distance, from a standing jump.\n40:12 Comment: He looks a worried man at the moment, Arsene Wenger.\n40:15 Comment: He said this was the match that would show that they were on the up.\n40:19 Comment: And you'd have to say in the first 40 minutes it doesn't look like they're on the up.\n40:23 Comment: Well, I just showed you on the graphic, they've not had one shot on target so far,\n40:27 Comment: Arsenal in the 40-plus minutes that they've played so far.\n40:33 Comment: Ten wins in their last 12.\n40:35 Comment: They're up against a team fourth in the French league,\n40:37 Comment: who defend well, and they've offered nothing, and they're 1-0 down.\n40:42 Comment: And of course in the context of a two-leg knockout,\n40:46 Comment: and away goal's been conceded, and this is seriously serious for Arsenal.\n40:55 Comment: Well, Sanchez.\n41:1 Comment: Monaco with bodies back, five players swarming around.\n41:6 Comment: So tight.\n41:7 Comment: There's so many players in and around that area,\n41:9 Comment: what a poor challenge from Coquelin on Kentucky.\n41:14 Comment: Guero Card.\n41:20 Comment: I just think his control lets him down there,\n41:23 Comment: as soon as he comes forward there, he's committed to the challenge,\n41:26 Comment: and certainly caught the Monaco midfield player.\n41:29 Comment: A quick rash challenge here from Coquelin.\n41:35 Comment: So the German referee.\n41:37 Comment: He brings out the notebook.\n41:39 Comment: Brandishes the card.\n41:41 Comment: Francis Coquelin is the first to go in the book.\n41:45 Comment: Just look flat, Arsenal, don't they?\n41:51 Comment: In the last couple of games, they defended well at the weekend against Crystal Palace.\n41:55 Comment: Going forward, they weren't particularly that good.\n41:57 Comment: The game before that against Middlesbrough here,\n42:1 Comment: the last home game that they had in the FA Cup,\n42:3 Comment: they were terrific.\n42:5 Comment: They played with great pace.\n42:6 Comment: The movement was terrific.\n42:8 Comment: Passed the ball quickly, sharply.\n42:10 Comment: They never gave Middlesbrough a chance in the game,\n42:12 Comment: but from the first whistle tonight,\n42:14 Comment: they've been a bit low key.\n42:16 Comment: But doesn't that say it, Ray?\n42:18 Comment: Middlesbrough, Championship team.\n42:20 Comment: Crystal Palace, recovering Premier League team.\n42:22 Comment: Monaco, fourth in La Ligue.\n42:26 Comment: And a team that won its group in the Champions League.\n42:30 Comment: Results are deceptive.\n42:32 Comment: They haven't done much, but they're a cut above.\n42:34 Comment: They're a cut above.\n42:36 Comment: And Arsenal are average at the moment.\n42:38 Comment: And certainly on tonight's evidence,\n42:40 Comment: they're very average.\n42:44 Comment: Martial.\n42:52 Comment: And Benoit.\n42:54 Comment: And Wallace.\n42:56 Comment: Toure.\n42:58 Comment: Gibbs steps in.\n43:2 Comment: And Arsenal with Sanchez.\n43:4 Comment: Cazorla.\n43:6 Comment: And one voice shouts Arsenal around us.\n43:8 Comment: And that tells you everything.\n43:10 Comment: The crowd is not enthused by what it's seeing.\n43:12 Comment: The team is not giving it anything.\n43:14 Comment: It's a blank night in London.\n43:16 Comment: Well, Arsenal are trying to manoeuvre players around\n43:18 Comment: and trying to find positions to get in possession.\n43:20 Comment: But look how deep Alexis Sanchez is going.\n43:22 Comment: Whereas you look at the Monaco players,\n43:24 Comment: they stay in the positions.\n43:26 Comment: They're very disciplined, in fairness to them.\n43:28 Comment: Got very good shape to them.\n43:30 Comment: Arsenal struggling to play through them,\n43:32 Comment: but they're very disciplined.\n43:34 Comment: I think because they're taking too many touches.\n43:36 Comment: And I don't think the shape of the Arsenal team\n43:38 Comment: is helping matters at the moment.\n43:40 Comment: And they don't have a spark.\n43:42 Comment: There's nobody there sparking.\n43:44 Comment: Well, the ones you normally look at\n43:46 Comment: are Cazorla in midfield.\n43:48 Comment: I mean, he's had a couple of runs.\n43:50 Comment: I think he's maybe playing just a little bit deeper than normal.\n43:52 Comment: And Alexis Sanchez, he's the one where his pace\n43:54 Comment: and the way that he normally closes down\n43:56 Comment: and everyone feeds off his enthusiasm\n43:58 Comment: hasn't quite happened for Arsenal in this first half.\n44:0 Comment: And the first half,\n44:2 Comment: they're going to be a bit more aggressive.\n44:4 Comment: forward shout\n44:6 Comment: teacher\n44:19 Comment: opened

Arsenal\n44:36 Comment: and there's two Monaco players\n44:38 Comment: in and around him that's a really\n44:39 Comment: dreadful challenge there for Elderson\n44:42 Comment: nowhere near the ball\n44:43 Comment: trying to win the ball\n44:45 Comment: this could be a good end to the first half for Arsenal\n44:47 Comment: if they can get in from this set play with Cazorla\n44:50 Comment: and the big boys are up\n45:1 Comment: Merda Zakhar\n45:2 Comment: joining Giroud\n45:3 Comment: Sheldon in there too\n45:9 Comment: Cazorla will take the free kick\n45:11 Comment: referee will sort things out\n45:14 Comment: before the free kick is taken\n45:16 Comment: I just think there's a slight problem\n45:18 Comment: between Giroud and Abdel Nour\n45:20 Comment: the referee just having a quiet word with him\n45:28 Comment: and\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: half starts and you just wonder where it's going to come from for Arsenal\n0:5 Comment: because unless something has been said in the dressing room at half time that\n0:9 Comment: will actually fire them. They were out early, Monaco didn't come till later when\n0:14 Comment: they came. It was a round chorus of boos from the Arsenal fans but that's about it\n0:20 Comment: because Arsenal fans haven't been cheering their own team. That's been the\n0:24 Comment: loudest they've been when they booed Monaco out for the second half. It's all\n0:28 Comment: very strange in North London tonight. Can Arsenal lift it in the 45 minutes that remain here?\n0:33 Comment: Sanchez! Sanchez... there was a chance there for Giroud but it's gone wide.\n0:41 Comment: I think it's a bad miss, George. Great play from Sanchez, lovely little pass in behind the defender.\n0:48 Comment: He's fired it across, his favourite to get there, Giroud, it's on his right foot.\n0:52 Comment: Abdelnaour goes across to try and close him down, he does well, fires it in and that is a\n0:57 Comment: complete miss kick. You can see that Wallace has missed it, he's took his eye off it.\n1:2 Comment: That is a very, very good chance for Giroud and you can tell by his reaction.\n1:6 Comment: That should have been 1-1.\n1:10 Comment: A player who scored eight in his last eleven.\n1:14 Comment: The talk is he's in form but that was not the action of a striker in form.\n1:20 Comment: Gerrard, referee, blows the whistle, gives the free kick to Monaco.\n1:27 Comment: And consider the passion that was evident in the clash last night of Manchester City and Barcelona\n1:45 Comment: and Juventus and Borussia Dortmund, Arsenal are just lacking some fire.\n1:52 Comment: It's Kieran Gibbs.\n1:57 Comment: To Shelney, to Sola, to Tottenham.\n2:5 Comment: To Sola, to Tottenham.\n2:22 Comment: And with Sanchez, nobody in that particular space.\n2:28 Comment: Wallace is able to clear to Toure.\n2:32 Comment: That's better for Arsenal, isn't it?\n2:37 Comment: The start of the second half, a bit more purposeful.\n2:40 Comment: Seeing Bellerin get forward down that right-hand side, it was a decent ball to try and pick up Giroud,\n2:44 Comment: who left it and felt that Alexis Sanchez was coming in behind him in a better position, but he wasn't.\n2:50 Comment: It's Gibbs now.\n3:0 Comment: Giroud's attempted lay-off, Monaco have dealt with that.\n3:5 Comment: See there, that's where he's got to hold it up.\n3:7 Comment: That's perfect there, throwing from Gibbs into the feet of Giroud, he's got to hold the defender off.\n3:12 Comment: He's bossing the ball, trying to turn if he wants to, or he can lay it off to one of his teammates.\n3:18 Comment: Sanchez was allowed a defender to muscle him off the ball there.\n3:23 Comment: Katsura.\n3:26 Comment: Mergezaker.\n3:30 Comment: Gozier.\n3:36 Comment: He went no, and he gave the ball away.\n3:42 Comment: Napier.\n3:44 Comment: Come back to Mergezaker.\n3:48 Comment: There's Giroud.\n3:51 Comment: Interception.\n3:53 Comment: Fabinho on the way.\n3:56 Comment: Mergezaker's head.\n3:58 Comment: Michel Neuner.\n4:0 Comment: Fabinho was the one who intercepted.\n4:6 Comment: Well back.\n4:7 Comment: Gibbs.\n4:10 Comment: A bit more purposeful at Arsenal, but a heavy touch and a foul by Gibbs.\n4:14 Comment: Yeah, they just can't find that final ball, can they?\n4:17 Comment: That was a decent build-up play for Arsenal, Wilbeck heavily involved.\n4:21 Comment: Gibbs getting forward from the left-back position.\n4:23 Comment: Just here, there's a really heavy touch there.\n4:26 Comment: You can see Wallace has read it really well, came across the Monaco defender.\n4:31 Comment: Gibbs gave him away, he missed that one there.\n4:44 Comment: Mergezaker.\n4:47 Comment: Now, the shoot for Fabinho.\n4:50 Comment: Feed by Martial.\n4:57 Comment: Berpitov.\n5:0 Comment: Gavisson.\n5:2 Comment: Berpitov.\n5:5 Comment: Wallace.\n5:11 Comment: Toure.\n5:12 Comment: No pressure there from Wilbeck and Arsenal get the ball back through the throw-in.\n5:17 Comment: Now Cazorla.\n5:22 Comment: And the challenge by Fabinho is deemed a foul, so Arsenal have the free kick.\n5:26 Comment: Well, they certainly try to up the tempo, the Arsenal players.\n5:28 Comment: The closing down has been much better at the start of the second half than it was in that first half.\n5:33 Comment: Cazorla maybe took a little bit too long to make up his mind what he's going to do in possession there.\n5:38 Comment: And certainly from this set play, could pose a problem or two for this Monaco defence.\n5:57 Comment: So the opponent has been moved back.\n6:1 Comment: Mbira, the Moroccan who's captaining Monaco tonight in the absence of Toure.\n6:11 Comment: And Arsenal have the free kick.\n6:12 Comment: Cazorla, swing it in there.\n6:14 Comment: Oh, that was a great opportunity.\n6:18 Comment: As Giroud thumps the ground in dismay.\n6:20 Comment: Well, he's had two excellent chances, hasn't he?\n6:22 Comment: Quick succession.\n6:23 Comment: Across the area, is he offside?\n6:25 Comment: He did look, he was ahead of the last defender there.\n6:29 Comment: The assistant's flag didn't go up from the far side there.\n6:31 Comment: He's got to get this on target.\n6:33 Comment: He's got above everyone.\n6:35 Comment: His body shape wasn't quite right.\n6:38 Comment: He's a bit wider the target.\n6:39 Comment: Should have done a bit better there, Giroud.\n6:41 Comment: Arsenal certainly ask more questions, they look more threatened at the start of the second half.\n6:45 Comment: Obviously the words from Arsene Wenger at half-time was,\n6:48 Comment: obviously, up the tempo, pass it quicker, don't take too many touches in possession of the ball.\n6:53 Comment: And they have just made a slight change.\n6:55 Comment: Alexi Sanchez going on that right-hand side of a front three.\n6:59 Comment: We will be coming closer to this left-hand side.\n7:2 Comment: Scartola.\n7:6 Comment: Beck.\n7:8 Comment: Gibbs.\n7:10 Comment: Coquelin.\n7:13 Comment: Angled towards Bellarine.\n7:17 Comment: Sanchez.\n7:18 Comment: Sanchez again.\n7:20 Comment: Chance for Bellarine, maybe?\n7:23 Comment: Where is he?\n7:26 Comment: Sanchez.\n7:27 Comment: He's wanted too much.\n7:33 Comment: Oh.\n7:35 Comment: Chance now for Martial.\n7:37 Comment: Bebertov.\n7:40 Comment: Oh, that's it.\n7:41 Comment: That's Arsenal in deep, deep trouble.\n7:47 Comment: What a goal.\n7:48 Comment: What a breakout.\n7:50 Comment: And the former Spurs man makes it doubly painful for Arsenal.\n7:54 Comment: That all came about, George, with Alexi Sanchez losing the ball inside the opposition's penalty area.\n8:1 Comment: There, watch Fabinho.\n8:3 Comment: Strength, determination holding off Alexi Sanchez.\n8:6 Comment: I don't know where Mertesacker's going, but when you come in that close to your opposition pit,\n8:10 Comment: you've got to win the ball.\n8:12 Comment: And he didn't.\n8:13 Comment: Fabinho onto Martial, onto Dimitar Bebertov.\n8:16 Comment: He never looked like he was missing.\n8:18 Comment: What is Arsenal doing there?\n8:19 Comment: Look how high they've been cut upfield.\n8:21 Comment: Martial, lovely ball onto Bebertov.\n8:24 Comment: He didn't look like he was going to miss, did he?\n8:26 Comment: How much would he have enjoyed this?\n8:28 Comment: A former Tottenham player back in north London against Arsenal.\n8:32 Comment: That's a superb finish in the stadium.\n8:35 Comment: From the home fans' point of view, a deathly silence at the moment.\n8:39 Comment: For that man on your screen there, absolute joy to see his team 2-0 up.\n8:44 Comment: Bebertov was never going to miss.\n8:46 Comment: It was dreadful.\n8:48 Comment: And schoolboy Hauler, really, if you think about it, you're on the attack.\n8:52 Comment: How do you concede a goal from an attack?\n8:54 Comment: But they've done it. They're 2-0 down now.\n8:56 Comment: And they are in deep, deep trouble, Arsenal.\n8:59 Comment: They lost to Barcelona at this stage, to Milan at this stage, and twice to Bayern Munich.\n9:6 Comment: But they'd have thought that they would have got past Monaco.\n9:9 Comment: But now they're 2-0 down in the home leg.\n9:13 Comment: And this is abject.\n9:16 Comment: When you think where they had the ball,\n9:18 Comment: inside Monaco's penalty area, a challenge from Fabinho on Alexi Sanchez.\n9:24 Comment: He shouldn't be allowed to go the length of the field uncontested.\n9:27 Comment: No-one got anywhere near them.\n9:29 Comment: I'm not sure what Mertesacker was trying to do.\n9:31 Comment: As if he said, Martial's not a threat, I'm going to go in and try and win the ball.\n9:35 Comment: He got nowhere near Fabinho, he's just played a simple ball in behind.\n9:40 Comment: Fair play to Martial, got his head up to see Bebetov in a better position.\n9:43 Comment: Good ball, and it was an expert finish from Bebetov.\n9:48 Comment: I'll put it in the context of the group stage.\n9:52 Comment: Monaco 1-1, 6 games, 4 goals.\n9:56 Comment: One round of 16-leg, 2 goals.\n9:59 Comment: Arsenal have written themselves a chapter of ignominy.\n10:4 Comment: Unless they can bring themselves back from that, it has been appalling.\n10:10 Comment: Home leg, 2-0 down to a team nobody fancies as a challenger in the Champions League.\n10:17 Comment: This is the match that Arsene Wenger said Arsenal would show that they were back,\n10:21 Comment: they were challengers, that they were on a great run of form.\n10:25 Comment: Which 10 wins in the last 12 would suggest they are, but they're not.\n10:30 Comment: You can just see a few heads at the moment, not quite there.\n10:34 Comment: I've just seen Alexi Sanchez possession, he played the ball into Wilbeck,\n10:37 Comment: Wilbeck was complaining it was too high, a few heads have gone down.\n10:43 Comment: And the Arsenal players, I know we've got a skill there from Subicic,\n10:46 Comment: just taking it away from Danny Wilbeck.\n10:48 Comment: This is a big 34 minutes for Arsenal left in this game,\n10:52 Comment: to try and get themselves back into this tie.\n10:58 Comment: Giroud.\n11:0 Comment: Awful.\n11:6 Comment: Hear the crowd, they're excited, the crowd's there forever.\n11:10 Comment: At times like this you also start to wonder,\n11:13 Comment: although it's not the same players over all the years,\n11:16 Comment: but he's been here a long time, Arsene Wenger,\n11:19 Comment: has he been saying things too often?\n11:21 Comment: Have they heard it all before?\n11:23 Comment: They started the second half 1-0 down, lifting it,\n11:27 Comment: Theo Wolcott maybe, is he coming on to lift things?\n11:30 Comment: They certainly need something.\n11:33 Comment: Sanchez.\n11:35 Comment: Oh, Giroud!\n11:39 Comment: What a miss this is, George.\n11:41 Comment: He didn't look confident at the time,\n11:43 Comment: this is a man who's scored eight goals in his last few matches.\n11:46 Comment: 8-11.\n11:47 Comment: Yeah, 8-11.\n11:48 Comment: Really good strike from Alexi Sanchez,\n11:51 Comment: the goalkeeper has pammed it back into the middle of the goal,\n11:54 Comment: leaning back, how many could have done anything?\n11:57 Comment: He just lifted it with his right foot over the top of the goalkeeper,\n12:0 Comment: he was already committed to making the save,\n12:2 Comment: he wasn't getting back up in time as you can see there.\n12:4 Comment: All you've got to do is make sure you get it on target.\n12:6 Comment: That's three opportunities and that's the best of the three.\n12:10 Comment: He's had six in all, he's not hit the target once.\n12:13 Comment: I am no psychologist, but I'm looking at a football team\n12:17 Comment: that I think has no belief in itself.\n12:22 Comment: Arsenal 0-2 Monaco.\n12:25 Comment: What now, Arsene?\n12:36 Comment: At the top level of football, George,\n12:38 Comment: if you're trying to win big tournaments,\n12:40 Comment: and this is as big as you get in Europe,\n12:42 Comment: when you see that challenge between Wallace and Giroud,\n12:44 Comment: you've got to make sure you defend properly.\n12:46 Comment: You can have all the positions that you like,\n12:49 Comment: but when there's a changeover position,\n12:51 Comment: you have to be in good covering positions,\n12:53 Comment: and he was at Mertizak.\n12:54 Comment: I'm not sure what he was trying to do there,\n12:56 Comment: but he was trying to win the ball.\n12:57 Comment: Watch here, you see how he's allowed Martial to get in behind him.\n13:2 Comment: He's come infield, he's caught in no-man's land.\n13:5 Comment: Look at all those red shirts trying to get back.\n13:7 Comment: A bare-but-tough, brilliant finish.\n13:9 Comment: Wasn't going to miss from there,\n13:10 Comment: but to go the length of the field in the manner that they did,\n13:13 Comment: without anyone from Arsenal getting anywhere near him,\n13:15 Comment: is dreadful defending.\n13:18 Comment: It's dreadful front to back.\n13:22 Comment: It's really, really abject, what Arsenal have put on tonight.\n13:27 Comment: And it's no surprise that in the 59th minute,\n13:30 Comment: they are 2-0 down at home to Monaco,\n13:32 Comment: fourth in the French League.\n13:39 Comment: You're quite right about Theo Walcott,\n13:41 Comment: he's just down in the technical area at the moment,\n13:43 Comment: and he will be brought on as soon as the ball goes out of play for the next time.\n13:48 Comment: And they might need just his genuine pace to try and in behind,\n13:51 Comment: try and stretch the game.\n13:54 Comment: Sanchez puts Kondobierg up there first.\n13:58 Comment: Tied it up by Abgenoer,\n14:1 Comment: and away by Subasic.\n14:4 Comment: Bare-but-tough.\n14:9 Comment: Arsenal's throw.\n14:13 Comment: Here's the substitution.\n14:15 Comment: It's Theo Walcott for Giroud.\n14:18 Comment: Now, that says a lot too.\n14:22 Comment: The talisman, the man who's in form,\n14:25 Comment: and he's been pretty awful tonight.\n14:28 Comment: You say that, George, and he's missed a few chances,\n14:30 Comment: but at least he's been in there, he's the only one.\n14:32 Comment: I've not seen Wilbeck in them positions.\n14:35 Comment: I've not seen Alexis Sanchez today in the positions to miss the chance,\n14:38 Comment: he's been in there.\n14:42 Comment: This one's Theo Walcott.\n14:43 Comment: Kocoulin, caught in possession, Koshelny sorts out.\n14:49 Comment: Now, this is the time, this is the half hour\n14:51 Comment: that the Arsenal players have to show\n14:54 Comment: the pride, the belief, the ability\n14:59 Comment: for something that's lacking\n15:2 Comment: that can lift them above the fourth team in the French League.\n15:8 Comment: And Salah, he's got to be in there.\n15:11 Comment: And salvage some pride.\n15:15 Comment: And on the evidence of the hour that's gone,\n15:17 Comment: you'd have to say that's unlikely to evolve.\n15:25 Comment: Berbatov.\n15:29 Comment: Threaded the ball beautifully through for Giroud.\n15:32 Comment: Giroud.\n15:34 Comment: Oh, wonderful.\n15:37 Comment: And it took a speed at the end.\n15:40 Comment: To make the save.\n15:42 Comment: To deny Martial.\n15:45 Comment: Brilliant play, George, wasn't it?\n15:46 Comment: Lovely.\n15:48 Comment: Martinho.\n15:49 Comment: Yeah, Martinho, little flick here into Martial.\n15:51 Comment: I tell you what Spinha's done brilliantly,\n15:52 Comment: how quickly he narrowed the angle.\n15:54 Comment: Look how close, he's virtually on top of Martial\n15:57 Comment: as he took the strike on with his right foot,\n15:58 Comment: gave him no room to try and curl the ball beyond the keeper there.\n16:3 Comment: Very good goalkeeper, he's kept his side in at 3-0,\n16:5 Comment: he couldn't see no way back for Arsenal.\n16:7 Comment: He didn't even get into that second leg.\n16:9 Comment: Here's the corner.\n16:12 Comment: First for Monaco on the hour.\n16:15 Comment: The threat is still there,\n16:16 Comment: can you imagine how they're feeling now?\n16:17 Comment: Confidence sky high.\n16:19 Comment: 2-0 up for the Emirates.\n16:26 Comment: Fabinho.\n16:28 Comment: Wallace.\n16:32 Comment: And forward they come once more.\n16:34 Comment: Tinho.\n16:36 Comment: I tell you what, what an effort that is.\n16:37 Comment: What a ball as well, cross-field ball.\n16:39 Comment: It was Thuri who picked him out with a 60-70 yard ball\n16:42 Comment: straight onto the chest.\n16:44 Comment: Martinho cuts in inside Bellarine.\n16:47 Comment: Wasn't too far away, that lovely controlled volley here from Martinho.\n16:56 Comment: They look more likely to get a third at the moment\n16:57 Comment: than Arsenal do to get a goal to try and get back into the tie.\n17:1 Comment: They've been usually impressive,\n17:2 Comment: we said how good they are defensively,\n17:5 Comment: we talked before the game, George,\n17:7 Comment: about this last six games we've only conceded one goal.\n17:10 Comment: The evidence is out there.\n17:12 Comment: The shape that they get back into,\n17:14 Comment: the work rate from them,\n17:15 Comment: the discipline that they've shown,\n17:17 Comment: and then to hit Arsenal on the counter-attack\n17:19 Comment: the manner that they have to get the two goals\n17:21 Comment: has been very good.\n17:22 Comment: From an away team, coming here,\n17:24 Comment: which is not an easy place to come,\n17:25 Comment: the Emirates have made it look a lot easier.\n17:31 Comment: Smertinsdaker.\n17:40 Comment: Mthola.\n17:44 Comment: Gives back.\n17:46 Comment: Sanchez.\n17:48 Comment: Urziel.\n17:53 Comment: Coquelin.\n17:54 Comment: And again it breaks down.\n17:58 Comment: Advantage played, it was a foul,\n17:59 Comment: and now they come forward again.\n18:2 Comment: Giroud looking for Berbatov.\n18:4 Comment: Smertinsdaker cuts him out.\n18:5 Comment: Berbatov goes down.\n18:6 Comment: Smertinsdaker sorts it out.\n18:8 Comment: Kisheldi's there to assist.\n18:10 Comment: And off it goes to Pellerin.\n18:12 Comment: They look so vulnerable on the counter-attack,\n18:13 Comment: Arsenal, they're trying to push him in forward.\n18:15 Comment: Both full-backs are getting in advanced positions.\n18:18 Comment: But how easy it is to break out for Monaco.\n18:21 Comment: Berbatov, he's shown a better pace today.\n18:24 Comment: I didn't think he had anymore.\n18:26 Comment: He's worked extremely hard,\n18:27 Comment: he's picked up some very good positions.\n18:30 Comment: And obviously that goal will be one that he'll remember forever.\n18:33 Comment: Against these old North London rivals.\n18:38 Comment: Smertinsdaker.\n18:40 Comment: Tie again.\n18:42 Comment: Sanchez.\n18:48 Comment: Walcott's in there.\n18:50 Comment: And again!\n18:52 Comment: Welbeck this time over the bar.\n18:54 Comment: He's got to go high though, what a ball.\n18:56 Comment: My initial reaction, I thought Walcott was offside\n18:58 Comment: when this ball was delivered.\n18:59 Comment: It looked very, very tight there.\n19:1 Comment: Oh, I mean it is very tight indeed.\n19:4 Comment: Very unlucky, the decency by Subicic.\n19:6 Comment: And then there's a strike coming in from Danny Welbeck.\n19:9 Comment: I think it actually came off Walcott,\n19:10 Comment: who was on the ground just here.\n19:12 Comment: It was a hit, Walcott took over the top of the crossbar.\n19:14 Comment: I think that was going into the back of the net.\n19:17 Comment: And eventually Walcott got in the way.\n19:19 Comment: You know, they make the point that the big leagues,\n19:22 Comment: was it in Spain?\n19:24 Comment: Spain in the Premier League now.\n19:26 Comment: And France has no profile as a big league.\n19:30 Comment: This is the team that's fourth in France.\n19:34 Comment: And they are in complete charge of this Champions League tie\n19:39 Comment: against Arsenal.\n19:41 Comment: Fourth in the French League, third in the Premier League.\n19:45 Comment: And they are in the Premier League.\n19:47 Comment: Third in the Premier League.\n19:49 Comment: And Monaco are in complete control.\n19:52 Comment: And Arsenal have no answer.\n19:57 Comment: And this is a team that we know can defend,\n20:1 Comment: but they've also shown they can score.\n20:5 Comment: Counter-attack, Arsenal no answer.\n20:9 Comment: 65 minutes, 2-0 down.\n20:11 Comment: Home leg.\n20:17 Comment: Oh, back again.\n20:24 Comment: And the danger is not away yet.\n20:28 Comment: What is Bichoni doing there?\n20:30 Comment: I mean, that's dreadful from his point of view.\n20:32 Comment: He's trying to play his way out of an area\n20:34 Comment: where he shouldn't be doing it.\n20:36 Comment: Look, when he comes in, I think he sees Theo Walcott.\n20:38 Comment: It's a dangerous ball.\n20:40 Comment: Monaco's picked it up, and I just think one or two of the players\n20:43 Comment: were in each other's way there,\n20:44 Comment: because there was a definite chance there.\n20:47 Comment: Oh, once again down to Arsenal's poor play out from the back there.\n20:52 Comment: Mertizakker.\n20:59 Comment: Those are the visiting fans, and why wouldn't they do that?\n21:4 Comment: Red and white, the normal colours of Monaco.\n21:9 Comment: In their away strip tonight against the red and white of Arsenal.\n21:12 Comment: Berbatov.\n21:22 Comment: They just look so composed, and don't look under any kind of pressure at all.\n21:25 Comment: I mean, play a bad ball, fine, to throw into Arsenal,\n21:28 Comment: but nobody's getting excited.\n21:30 Comment: It's gone out of play, they'll start again.\n21:33 Comment: They all know their jobs, though, George, that's the thing.\n21:35 Comment: You know, obviously, you've had a lot of good results like they have recently.\n21:38 Comment: Danny Wobbeck.\n21:44 Comment: Sanchez.\n21:47 Comment: Sanchez still.\n21:53 Comment: Forlorn dive.\n21:58 Comment: Arsenal still in possession, Kieran Gibbs.\n22:9 Comment: Lost the possession in a tight situation,\n22:11 Comment: and Monaco break free once more.\n22:19 Comment: Foot was high.\n22:20 Comment: It was, Berlind who came across from the right-back position.\n22:24 Comment: Good build-up play from Monaco there,\n22:27 Comment: Turi into the midfield area.\n22:31 Comment: Kondogbia, little ball in, lovely little flighty ball in to Berbatov,\n22:35 Comment: Berbatov for Bellerin, come across with a challenge.\n22:39 Comment: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's coming on as we watch the challenge again.\n22:47 Comment: On for Kokeland.\n22:50 Comment: Second change for Arsenal.\n22:54 Comment: As things become increasingly desperate.\n22:58 Comment: Well, it's not a natural position for Oxlade-Chamberlain to play as the deep-line midfield player,\n23:2 Comment: we've seen him on the right wing, left wing, playing in the number 10 position,\n23:6 Comment: as an attacking midfielder, I've not really seen him play as the disciplined player.\n23:13 Comment: Cazorla.\n23:14 Comment: Here he is, Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n23:16 Comment: Lovely lay-off there from Ozil, but didn't quite work out.\n23:27 Comment: Berbatov couldn't win it, Oxlade-Chamberlain in there battling and winning it.\n23:31 Comment: Oxlade-Chamberlain, oh, that was nearly a very, very good ball.\n23:35 Comment: Wolcott was in there, but Credit Suisic.\n23:38 Comment: Yeah, good run again, he got in a little bit early with a similar run.\n23:43 Comment: Theo Wolcott on this occasion, the goalkeeper read it very, very quickly,\n23:47 Comment: as he got into that position to help out his full-back.\n23:50 Comment: Elderson who got caught ball-watching once again, he's just got to get his body shape a little bit better,\n23:54 Comment: where he can see the ball and Wolcott rather than getting too tight to the Arsenal winger.\n24:0 Comment: Berbatov.\n24:4 Comment: Fabinho.\n24:7 Comment: Abdelnour.\n24:10 Comment: Elderson.\n24:13 Comment: Monaco just look comfortable, they don't bother.\n24:16 Comment: Well, the 2-0 up does make it easier, but you go back to the chances that Arsenal created,\n24:21 Comment: the 3-4, Olivier Giroud, the right-footed shot at the near post,\n24:26 Comment: where he should have done better, the header, where he couldn't really get his body angles right,\n24:31 Comment: and he headed it wide of the target.\n24:33 Comment: But the third one, all he had to do was lift it over the top of the goalkeeper,\n24:36 Comment: which would have got Arsenal back into it, and after that he had the chance for Wilbeck\n24:40 Comment: when he hit Theo Wolcott when he was on the ground.\n24:42 Comment: They are game-changing moments, they've got to take some of these chances,\n24:46 Comment: which were very good chances at that.\n24:50 Comment: Arsenal have a bad result, Champions League against a French opposition,\n24:55 Comment: that was Oxlade-Chamberlain back to defend there.\n25:0 Comment: Once again, that's Ospina here, Arsenal trying to play the way out of a dangerous situation,\n25:5 Comment: look at Ospina, tries to play into Oxlade-Chamberlain,\n25:8 Comment: he lays it off poorly to Mertesacker, Martinho's on to it,\n25:12 Comment: he's done well to come back and make the coming challenge.\n25:20 Comment: FANS SHOUT OUT\n25:29 Comment: Arsenal get away with a goal kick.\n25:31 Comment: 20 minutes to go, two goals to the bar.\n25:35 Comment: They definitely need one, in my opinion, between now and the end of the game,\n25:39 Comment: to take into that second leg, I think 2-0 will be a real struggle for Arsenal,\n25:43 Comment: they'll definitely win by three clear goals, or 2-0 will take them into...\n25:48 Comment: ...added on time, 30 minutes, if they could win 2-0 over there,\n25:51 Comment: if the scoreline remains the same here.\n25:56 Comment: They're in trouble again.\n26:0 Comment: Yeah, they had that defeat to Auxerre when they were a force in France, back here.\n26:10 Comment: I remember a pretty abject performance against Manchester United,\n26:14 Comment: on occasion in the Champions League, when the two English teams met head-to-head,\n26:20 Comment: but this is becoming something of a...\n26:26 Comment: ...too regular for Arsenal.\n26:28 Comment: Well, I watched Arsenal, as I say, against Crystal Palace on Saturday,\n26:31 Comment: and what kept them in the game was the two centre-halves,\n26:33 Comment: Mertesacker and Gushel, who played extremely well,\n26:35 Comment: made very few mistakes in the game, whereas today,\n26:38 Comment: they're making countless mistakes.\n26:44 Comment: Kibbs attempting a cross.\n26:48 Comment: Forward come Monaco.\n26:52 Comment: We're back to the old argument about how good is the Premier League,\n26:55 Comment: and what does a performance against Crystal Palace actually mean,\n26:58 Comment: when you've got a Monaco on a Wednesday night?\n27:2 Comment: 2-0 down at home, Champions League, 18 minutes to go.\n27:6 Comment: First leg, and a trip to Monaco in three weeks to come.\n27:10 Comment: Sanchez trying to thread through.\n27:14 Comment: It's Gibbs.\n27:17 Comment: Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n27:22 Comment: Ozil.\n27:28 Comment: Come out to Gibbs.\n27:33 Comment: Ketora.\n27:36 Comment: Mertesacker.\n27:40 Comment: Finally, a come-on Arsenal chant rises around the Emirates.\n27:46 Comment: And immediately dies in its throat.\n27:49 Comment: Even the crowd doesn't believe.\n27:51 Comment: Ketora.\n27:54 Comment: Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n27:56 Comment: Oxlade-Chamberlain still.\n27:59 Comment: But the vast ranks of the Monaco defence sort that out.\n28:2 Comment: And off they come on a counter-attack.\n28:4 Comment: And now it is one against three, and it's a free kick.\n28:9 Comment: And the card is coming out.\n28:11 Comment: And it's a yellow card for Hector Bellerin.\n28:15 Comment: What a run though from Martial.\n28:17 Comment: Genuine pace.\n28:19 Comment: Bellerin is quite quick himself, he couldn't keep up with the Monaco left winger.\n28:23 Comment: Little tug of the shirt, cynical foul.\n28:25 Comment: I mean, he was through, we just met Mertesacker,\n28:28 Comment: the lone Arsenal player in front of him,\n28:30 Comment: so he was a hugely important challenger from Bellerin.\n28:32 Comment: He couldn't afford to be one-on-one with Mertesacker,\n28:35 Comment: who certainly would have the pace to beat the Arsenal centre-half.\n28:38 Comment: They really believe here.\n28:41 Comment: Monaco, they could get a third.\n28:55 Comment: Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n28:58 Comment: Back in chase goes Walcott.\n29:2 Comment: Comfy challenge there by Abdelnour.\n29:9 Comment: Walcott not happy with the challenge there.\n29:11 Comment: Took pace with him there, didn't he?\n29:13 Comment: Abdelnour covered his full-back well there, the centre-half.\n29:17 Comment: There's a challenge coming in.\n29:19 Comment: It was a 50-50 ball, wasn't it?\n29:33 Comment: Monaco making a change.\n29:35 Comment: Divatar Bebertov coming off.\n29:38 Comment: And in his place...\n29:41 Comment: Yannick Pereira Carrasco.\n29:51 Comment: I think he'll remember this, won't he, George? Bebertov?\n29:54 Comment: Oh, he will.\n29:55 Comment: With a smile, he doesn't smile too often, that man,\n29:57 Comment: I never tell him, but he was a clear smile as he came off there,\n30:0 Comment: extremely hard for his side tonight.\n30:2 Comment: Excellent performance from him.\n30:5 Comment: Belgium, nationality, but Portuguese and Spanish antecedents.\n30:12 Comment: 21-year-old striker.\n30:23 Comment: It just looks like they've had a slight change with Bebertov coming off,\n30:26 Comment: because Martial has been playing all of the game over on that left-hand side,\n30:29 Comment: and the midfield has come into a more central role.\n30:31 Comment: And Carrasco is an out-and-out wide player, so he's gone over to the left-hand side.\n30:40 Comment: Dirar running it back.\n30:44 Comment: I think there was a flying elbow there on Pissola.\n30:47 Comment: I don't think there was any intent at all there from Dirar.\n30:51 Comment: Pissola just looked like he lost possession of the ball,\n30:53 Comment: there was a little coming together just here when he gets it there.\n30:56 Comment: Heavy touch, and the arm comes around.\n30:58 Comment: I don't think there was any intent there, he's just tried to hold off the man.\n31:4 Comment: Back on his feet, Pissola.\n31:26 Comment: Pissola.\n31:31 Comment: Salonga to Reid.\n31:34 Comment: Gets it.\n31:43 Comment: Run away again.\n31:48 Comment: Continued.\n31:51 Comment: Dopia.\n31:56 Comment: Spina.\n31:58 Comment: Not a bad effort there from Martial, was it?\n32:0 Comment: Coming to the field there, took the strike on.\n32:3 Comment: Went towards the near post of Spina, his position was very good.\n32:19 Comment: He's played well tonight, you know, Mantegna.\n32:21 Comment: Mantegna.\n32:23 Comment: Picks up some really good positions.\n32:25 Comment: Very good possession of the ball, does it nice and simply,\n32:28 Comment: but always makes himself available.\n32:39 Comment: Now here they come again.\n32:41 Comment: A lead-off by Martial.\n32:47 Comment: Dopia.\n32:49 Comment: Fabinho.\n32:52 Comment: Enjoying themselves down in the goal.\n32:54 Comment: Moutinho.\n32:57 Comment: Toure.\n33:1 Comment: Girard.\n33:7 Comment: Kieran Gibbs.\n33:8 Comment: Girard challenges, throwing his to Arsenal.\n33:10 Comment: Great attitude they've got, haven't they?\n33:12 Comment: They were just exemplified there by the skipper, Girard.\n33:16 Comment: Went for a little one-two there, wasn't the best ball back to him.\n33:19 Comment: He went and closed down Kieran Gibbs,\n33:21 Comment: not allowing him any time and possession of the ball there.\n33:24 Comment: So aware of closing down the space.\n33:27 Comment: This is Ozil.\n33:31 Comment: He's challenged.\n33:32 Comment: Tortola.\n33:33 Comment: He's lost it.\n33:34 Comment: And now, well, it's not a proper counter-attack\n33:38 Comment: because they don't have the men.\n33:40 Comment: Arsenal have men back, but Monaco have the possession.\n33:44 Comment: Fabinho.\n33:46 Comment: Martial.\n33:47 Comment: Fabinho.\n33:54 Comment: Touring with Arsenal now.\n33:59 Comment: Arsenal look legged, George, don't they?\n34:1 Comment: They just look like they've got no energy about it.\n34:14 Comment: Monaco just able to retain the possession with some ease.\n34:20 Comment: And they don't have to do it because they're 2-0 up.\n34:23 Comment: Two away goals if it comes to 2-0.\n34:27 Comment: And Monaco, they just need one.\n34:32 Comment: They've worked hard for it and they're\n34:35 Comment: ten minutes away from a famous victory in the Emirates Stadium.\n34:40 Comment: And a night of some dignity for Arsenal, you'd have to say.\n34:45 Comment: Well, Arsenal haven't lost too many here.\n34:46 Comment: I mean, they lost to Manchester United in the league,\n34:48 Comment: they lost to Southampton in the league cup.\n34:50 Comment: But that's about it.\n34:51 Comment: That just shows you the size of the performance from Monaco this evening.\n34:55 Comment: That's exactly it.\n34:56 Comment: Two defeats at home this season.\n35:5 Comment: And away they come with the ball again.\n35:7 Comment: There was a chance but...\n35:10 Comment: Martial can't get involved, he was in an offside position.\n35:12 Comment: But how high up Arsenal were, they were virtually two yards inside their own half.\n35:15 Comment: There was so much grass to play the ball into.\n35:18 Comment: Martial was doing his level best to try and stay onside.\n35:21 Comment: He thought Moutinho took too long to play the ball forward.\n35:23 Comment: But a half-decent ball earlier, and he was through one-on-one with a goalkeeper.\n35:28 Comment: Arsenal are taking a lot of risks at the moment defensively.\n35:32 Comment: And they're in search of a goal here.\n35:35 Comment: And there's a gutter corner as...\n35:38 Comment: Monaco defend rather desperately.\n35:41 Comment: Yeah, I think it was Kondogbia who just came back there to take off the toes of Alexi Sanchez.\n35:45 Comment: He thought he was going to get a strike there.\n35:47 Comment: Thomas Rosicky.\n35:52 Comment: The ball leaves, and Rosicky goes on.\n35:56 Comment: He looks hugely disappointed, doesn't he?\n35:58 Comment: He's only just taken his place on the bench there.\n36:1 Comment: I'm sure there's all the Arsenal players that just haven't performed tonight.\n36:7 Comment: And a change for Monaco too.\n36:9 Comment: Sees the introduction of Levin Kursawa, who's played in the Champions League.\n36:15 Comment: Taking the place of Dierar, who was the captain of the team.\n36:18 Comment: And he's got a chance to get a strike.\n36:20 Comment: Kursawa, who's played in the Champions League.\n36:23 Comment: Taking the place of Dierar, who was the captain tonight.\n36:33 Comment: This is just a case of what we have, we hold.\n36:36 Comment: Yeah, another defender coming on, George, in place of a midfield player.\n36:39 Comment: So they're just going to...\n36:41 Comment: Probably can go to the back five now.\n36:43 Comment: Just to keep this 2-0 scoreline that they've got with what, eight minutes or so left in the game.\n36:51 Comment: And the corner.\n36:53 Comment: Gave the chance there to Sanchez, but he couldn't convert it.\n36:58 Comment: That was a decent chance as well.\n37:0 Comment: You can see he got away from his marker, Fabinho got caught by a little flick on from the Monaco player.\n37:5 Comment: Just couldn't connect in the manner that he would like there.\n37:8 Comment: There's the flick on, comes to him, has to take it quickly.\n37:11 Comment: Never really looked set as he went wide of the target.\n37:14 Comment: You can see the frustration once again from another Arsenal striker.\n37:21 Comment: Gives forward.\n37:24 Comment: A bit too quick by Wallace.\n37:27 Comment: Tied up, Subashich.\n37:33 Comment: Elderson, out of him.\n37:35 Comment: Throw to Arsenal.\n37:37 Comment: Brzezinski.\n37:43 Comment: Koscielny.\n37:45 Comment: Brzezinski.\n37:51 Comment: Composure by the new man, Ferreira Carrasco.\n37:56 Comment: Forward they come again.\n37:59 Comment: Kurzawa.\n38:2 Comment: Just on the pitches to substitute.\n38:10 Comment: He's gone out the throat.\n38:12 Comment: Monaco's throat.\n38:15 Comment: You can see now, not over-committing at all.\n38:18 Comment: They've got the two centre-halves back there.\n38:21 Comment: Abdelnoor alongside Wallace and Thuri, the right full-back.\n38:25 Comment: They're only up against Wilbeck.\n38:27 Comment: Three back there against one Arsenal player.\n38:30 Comment: He's trying to run the clock down with six minutes left.\n38:35 Comment: So Martial comes off.\n38:38 Comment: Afton making a fair impression himself, it has to be said.\n38:44 Comment: I think he's been excellent, I really do.\n38:46 Comment: I think he's been a huge influence in the game for Monaco.\n38:50 Comment: Bernardo Silva scored the winner at Nice weekend.\n38:56 Comment: Comes on to take his place for the last few minutes.\n39:1 Comment: The substitution is then complete on both sides.\n39:8 Comment: And Arsenal can't even play their way out of defence satisfactorily.\n39:14 Comment: That was Kondopje.\n39:20 Comment: Kurzawa.\n39:23 Comment: Kuznicki.\n39:27 Comment: But hasn't gone out.\n39:30 Comment: And there's the ball.\n39:36 Comment: And Mertesacker wins it back.\n39:40 Comment: Sack.\n39:41 Comment: On by Ozil.\n39:45 Comment: And a great flourish from Arsenal perhaps.\n39:47 Comment: Walcott.\n39:49 Comment: Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n39:54 Comment: He looks a decent centre-half, doesn't he?\n39:56 Comment: Abdelnoor.\n39:57 Comment: Very competitive.\n40:0 Comment: Very quick indeed as well.\n40:1 Comment: Kept pace with Walcott earlier on, which is never easy.\n40:4 Comment: And there, kept his eye on the ball all the way with the challenge on Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n40:11 Comment: Arsenal in the corner.\n40:13 Comment: Simicic with the punch away.\n40:20 Comment: Wonderful skill to break free and now it's, well, two on four.\n40:25 Comment: Monaco have got clear.\n40:27 Comment: That's Ferreira Carrasco.\n40:30 Comment: I'll tell you what, there was an opportunity there for Ferreira Carrasco if he'd got his head up.\n40:34 Comment: Here's another one of the substitute Silva.\n40:36 Comment: They made a great run to support.\n40:38 Comment: Once again from an Arsenal set play.\n40:40 Comment: They give it away, they break quickly.\n40:42 Comment: And that could have been another chance for Monaco to get another goal in this game.\n40:48 Comment: If he could have got his head up and picked out that pass over to the right-hand side.\n40:54 Comment: Into the final five minutes we go.\n41:7 Comment: Arsenal pinned back in their own corner.\n41:12 Comment: And unable to retain the possession.\n41:15 Comment: And a yellow card for Mesut Ozil.\n41:18 Comment: And a throw in to Monaco.\n41:22 Comment: Well, he wasn't happy with the decision by the referee.\n41:24 Comment: He felt it should have been a throw in to Arsenal.\n41:27 Comment: And then he just threw the ball into the ground.\n41:29 Comment: Which probably typifies the way that Arsenal played tonight for me.\n41:33 Comment: I thought Arsenal would go through quite comfortably over the two legs.\n41:37 Comment: And really did.\n41:38 Comment: Some of the form I've seen from them recently and some of the play that I've seen from them.\n41:42 Comment: I thought this could be a good tie for them.\n41:44 Comment: But all credit to Monaco.\n41:46 Comment: I think their shape has been excellent.\n41:49 Comment: They've hit Arsenal on the counter-attack.\n41:51 Comment: They've got the goals at the right time.\n41:52 Comment: And Arsenal just haven't played.\n41:55 Comment: There's not been an Arsenal player you've looked at tonight who you would say has played anywhere near the level expected of him.\n42:1 Comment: It's been a sad night for Arsene Wenger.\n42:3 Comment: Against a team that employed him for seven years in the 90s.\n42:7 Comment: 80s and 90s.\n42:10 Comment: He must be feeling the frustration he felt as his time in Monaco came to an end.\n42:14 Comment: The longest serving Premier League manager.\n42:16 Comment: Now looking at a performance that he will never forget.\n42:21 Comment: Silva.\n42:22 Comment: Dispossessed.\n42:24 Comment: And Sanchez comes away with the ball.\n42:31 Comment: Well, that's hitting hope really, isn't it?\n42:33 Comment: You don't see that from Arsenal too often, do you?\n42:35 Comment: Where they're just hitting long, hopeful balls downfield to pick out players.\n42:38 Comment: But that's what they're resorting to at the moment.\n42:41 Comment: We've seen it two or three occasions, trying to hit diagonals, trying to hit Danny Wilbeck with long balls, which isn't the Arsenal way.\n42:47 Comment: They are a passing team.\n42:48 Comment: The passing has been off, the movement has been there.\n42:52 Comment: They've defended poorly, given away two really soft goals.\n42:56 Comment: The players not making right decisions, not going in, committed to win the ball.\n43:0 Comment: And credit to Monaco when the chances presented themselves, they were clinical.\n43:5 Comment: And that's the way it is.\n43:6 Comment: And it's been a famous night for Monaco, you have to say.\n43:10 Comment: Within the final two minutes, plus whatever the German referee adds on.\n43:15 Comment: But it's been pretty awful from Arsenal.\n43:20 Comment: And the silence in the Emirates confirms that.\n43:24 Comment: No enthusiasm at all.\n43:26 Comment: Lots of empty seats now.\n43:28 Comment: And the fans are going to be there.\n43:31 Comment: Confirms that.\n43:32 Comment: No enthusiasm at all.\n43:34 Comment: Lots of empty seats now as they've gone home.\n43:38 Comment: A bit of desperate singing.\n43:40 Comment: As Akshay Chamberlain tries to make his way through.\n43:46 Comment: But it's been Monaco's night, and here goes Carrasco.\n43:52 Comment: Carrasco.\n43:54 Comment: Straight at Ospina.\n43:56 Comment: There was an opportunity to make it three.\n43:58 Comment: Silva was in there, George.\n44:0 Comment: Once again, for me, he's taken the wrong option.\n44:3 Comment: He had someone he could have just squared the ball to.\n44:5 Comment: But once again, Arsenal on the attack, give the ball away.\n44:8 Comment: One pass, and they're straight through on goal.\n44:12 Comment: It's Gibbs.\n44:18 Comment: Sanchez.\n44:20 Comment: Again, the ball's given away.\n44:21 Comment: Chimney here for Sanchez.\n44:23 Comment: And it's a corner.\n44:25 Comment: As we move into stoppage time.\n44:27 Comment: Well, this is it.\n44:28 Comment: This is maybe the last chance for Arsenal.\n44:30 Comment: The last, what, 20 seconds of the 90.\n44:32 Comment: And then they had it on time.\n44:34 Comment: They've got, but they certainly need to take something into the second leg.\n44:37 Comment: Poor corner.\n44:38 Comment: But another one they get.\n44:41 Comment: 2-1 wouldn't be too bad.\n44:43 Comment: 2-0 is pretty obvious.\n44:45 Comment: But it's a corner.\n44:47 Comment: And it's a corner.\n44:49 Comment: 2-0 is pretty awful.\n44:57 Comment: Sanchez.\n44:59 Comment: Urziel.\n45:4 Comment: Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n45:6 Comment: Oh, he's got one back!\n45:10 Comment: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n45:12 Comment: As the ball goes up to save, four additional minutes.\n45:16 Comment: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n45:18 Comment: Out of nothing, gets Arsenal a lifeline.\n45:21 Comment: I'll tell you what, what a good finish.\n45:22 Comment: Not particularly good defending from Monaco on this occasion.\n45:28 Comment: Konduktio was the one that came out and really sold himself there too.\n45:32 Comment: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain should have just held his ground.\n45:34 Comment: But that is a wonderful finish.\n45:36 Comment: You can see Subhasinchi, the goalkeeper, trying his level best to keep it out.\n45:39 Comment: But no chance as it nestled in that far corner.\n45:42 Comment: And four added on minutes now.\n45:44 Comment: But this is looking a little bit better for Arsenal at 2-1.\n45:50 Comment: You have to say, it's hardly what they've deserved.\n45:53 Comment: But it's not necessarily what you deserve, but what you get.\n45:57 Comment: And now they're in a much, much, much better position.\n46:1 Comment: Think of Manchester City last night.\n46:3 Comment: Think of Joe Hart's save and Messi's miss.\n46:6 Comment: And it stayed at 2-1 and it's still alive.\n46:9 Comment: At 2-1 for Arsenal.\n46:12 Comment: Even as a deficit, it's possible.\n46:16 Comment: 2-0 was difficult. 2-1 is slightly less so.\n46:20 Comment: You also have to factor in the chances that they missed.\n46:23 Comment: That will give them a bit of encouragement for that second leg\n46:25 Comment: that they did have opportunities against Monaco.\n46:29 Comment: Carrasco, Moutinho, and now Silva.\n46:36 Comment: And you think just before that Monaco had a chance to make it three.\n46:40 Comment: But Carrasco was greedy.\n46:45 Comment: Still going for the third, they get a free kick.\n46:49 Comment: Foul on Kozawa.\n46:50 Comment: Yeah, Charles Kevin, I think Ruzicki was in there alongside Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n46:57 Comment: You see when he picks the ball up, I'm not sure he knows exactly where he's going,\n47:0 Comment: but there's the collision between Ruzicki and Kosovac.\n47:5 Comment: And this is a good chance for them.\n47:8 Comment: How they would love to get a third goal to take into that second leg, Monaco.\n47:13 Comment: I think Carrasco, George, looks like he wants to take the shot on from this distance.\n47:17 Comment: I'm not sure it's the easiest.\n47:19 Comment: It's quite a play out, good foot, 25-28 yards out.\n47:23 Comment: Oshpina has to make sure he gets his wall right here.\n47:30 Comment: Colombian World Cup goalkeeper has it all set up.\n47:34 Comment: The shaving foam has been applied to the pitch.\n47:37 Comment: And here comes the free kick as we approach the end of the third minute of additional time.\n47:42 Comment: The goalkeeper spilled it, but not that it mattered.\n47:45 Comment: Carrasco's shot was never going to beat him.\n47:48 Comment: One last attack for Arsenal.\n47:54 Comment: Monaco struggle to repel it.\n47:57 Comment: It's all become a bit frantic.\n47:59 Comment: One more minute of additional time.\n48:0 Comment: Sanchez, out for a throw to Arsenal.\n48:6 Comment: Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n48:10 Comment: Couldn't quite control it.\n48:14 Comment: A Monaco break, and it's Carrasco.\n48:17 Comment: Carrasco.\n48:18 Comment: Oh, it's 3-1!\n48:21 Comment: Oh, that's a disaster for Arsenal.\n48:24 Comment: Having got it back to Monaco.\n48:26 Comment: Another counter-attack.\n48:28 Comment: And Monaco score three in one game.\n48:32 Comment: Incredible finish from Carrasco.\n48:34 Comment: But once again, what are Arsenal doing?\n48:36 Comment: They lose possession.\n48:38 Comment: Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n48:40 Comment: But one passer again.\n48:42 Comment: Here, look how high up the field they are.\n48:44 Comment: No one on the cover.\n48:46 Comment: There's a challenge coming on.\n48:48 Comment: Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n48:50 Comment: Fernando Silva with a little ball in.\n48:52 Comment: And it's a goal.\n48:53 Comment: Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n48:55 Comment: Fernando Silva with a little ball in to Carrasco.\n48:57 Comment: There's no one back there.\n48:59 Comment: You're looking, where's Koscielny?\n49:1 Comment: Where's Mertesacker?\n49:3 Comment: There's the strike coming in from Carrasco.\n49:5 Comment: Across Oshpina, into that far corner.\n49:7 Comment: Off the post.\n49:9 Comment: And what a scoreline for Monaco.\n49:11 Comment: We said the ground was empty in the early of Georgia 2-0.\n49:13 Comment: Well, now, you're looking around here,\n49:15 Comment: there's so many empty seats.\n49:17 Comment: Arsenal fans have got up, walking out the stadium.\n49:19 Comment: Just can't quite believe what's happened in the last few minutes.\n49:21 Comment: You've just got your...\n    \n\n

    "summary": "In what was expected to be a riveting clash, Arsenal played hosts to Monaco at the Emirates Stadium in North London, a night that promised to showcase Arsenal's upward trajectory in European football under Arsène Wenger. However, the 1-3 loss against the French side left the Gunners and their faithful reeling, caught in a whirlwind of missed chances, defensive errors, and Monaco's clinical counter-attacking prowess.\n\nFrom the outset, the atmosphere within the Emirates was charged with anticipation. Arsenal, 12 points adrift of Chelsea in the Premier League, sought solace and momentum through the Champions League, needing to go beyond the last 16—a stage at which they had stalled for the past four seasons. The ground buzzed with expectancy, and for the home fans, North London's night couldn't have looked brighter.\n\nArsenal began the first half with an air of determination. A swift move in the second minute saw Danny Welbeck's effort fizz just over the bar after a fine ball over the top wasn't properly dealt with by Monaco's defense. It was a sign of things to come, but also a prelude to what would become a frustrating evening. Monaco's structure stood rigid and resolute, a defense that had conceded merely one goal in their last six matches under the tutelage of Leonardo Jardim.\n\nAs Arsenal pushed, the sleek combination of passes between Olivier Giroud, Mesut Özil, and Kieran Gibbs began to define their approach. However, despite their intricate play and movement, the final decisive ball eluded them repeatedly. There was a notable attempt from Gibbs to find Welbeck with a delightful cross, but once again, Abdennour marshaled the Monaco defense with precision, thwarting Arsenal's attacking endeavors.\n\nDimitar Berbatov, a figure of notoriety owing to his Spurs past, found himself on the receiving end of several boos from the Arsenal faithful. Yet, Monaco remained unfazed, transitioning efficiently between defense and attack, creating a sense of unpredictability that seemed to unnerve the Gunners.\n\nDefensively, Arsenal's Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker managed to hold off several forays from Monaco, yet an ominous aura loomed as the French team slowly grew into the game. Arsenal's attempts continued with Koscielny finding freedom on the left and Alexis Sanchez hustling, winning back possession but still unable to carve out the finisher that the home crowd yearned for.\n\nMidway through the first half, a harsh reality began to surface for Arsenal. They probed incessantly but lacked the spark needed to breach Monaco's disciplined rear guard. Fabinho, Kondogbia, and Moutinho relentlessly closed down spaces, leaving Arsène Wenger's side bereft of options.\n\nIn the 37th minute, a moment of calamity befell Arsenal. Geoffrey Kondogbia found himself with space and time at a significant distance from goal. A fierce strike took a cruel deflection off Mertesacker, leaving David Ospina rooted as the ball crashed into the net. This surprising turn of events highlighted Arsenal's vulnerabilities, showing that Monaco did not need much to punish their opponents, and the Emirates fell into a subdued silence—one that would deepen as the night progressed.\n\nPost-halftime, the Gunners emerged from the tunnel seemingly rejuvenated. Within minutes, Alexis Sanchez, injecting some early energy, combined neatly with Giroud, but Giroud's subsequent miss from close range left spectators in disbelief. The French striker, usually so clinical, skewed his effort wide—a hallmark of nerves and pressure that began to permeate through Arsenal's play.\n\nArsenal continued to dominate possession, but as they pressed for an equalizer, they left themselves exposed. Monaco capitalized, and in the 53rd minute, a lethal counter-attack saw Anthony Martial slicing through the Arsenal midfield. His pass found Berbatov, whose composed finish doubled Monaco's lead. The Emirates was stunned into silence once more as the former Tottenham Hotspur man slotted the ball home with clinical precision, compounding Arsenal's mounting woes.\n\nGiroud had chances again, but his profligacy became a repeated and painful theme. Each miss added to the somber atmosphere enveloping the Emirates. Arsène Wenger, clearly agitated on the sidelines, knew a window was closing rapidly. Even with substitutions introducing Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, desperation was evident in Arsenal's play, marked by hurried passes and rushed shots, none more so than when Walcott inadvertently blocked a goal-bound effort from Welbeck.\n\nAs time ticked on, Monaco's compact defensive formation held firm under the increasing Arsenal pressure. For every probing run by Sanchez or incisive pass from Özil, Monaco had an answer. Alexis Sanchez found himself dispossessed time and again, with Fabinho and Wallace making critical blocks. The sense of urgency became palpable in Arsenal's ranks—a need to salvage something from the game.\n\nIn the 90th minute, as hope dwindled, Arsenal's persistence bore some fruit. Oxlade-Chamberlain was gifted a chance and curled a brilliant strike into the top corner, reigniting a flicker of hope. Now at 2-1, it seemed Arsenal might just have a lifeline to hold on to. The stadium, sensing a momentous shift, roared back to life.\n\nBut tragedy, and a testament to their frailty on this night, struck in stoppage time. With Arsenal pushing forward in search of another, they were caught yet again on the break. This time, it was Yannick Ferreira-Carrasco who sped through and delivered the damning blow with a clinical strike past Ospina to make it 3-1.\n\nIn those final moments, Carrasco's goal felt like the final nail—a punctuation mark on a night where Arsenal’s defensive frailties were mercilessly exploited. The Gunners trudged off the pitch with heads bowed, knowing they had not only been outplayed but outthought and outfought in every decisive moment by a Monaco side that executed their game plan to perfection. The significant away goals left the Gunners with a mountainous task in the return leg, needing at least three goals to overturn the disaster they had orchestrated this night.\n\nAs the fog of despair settled over the Emirates, questions about Arsenal's mettle and their aspirations on the European stage became all but unavoidable. They had lost to Barcelona, Milan, and twice to Bayern Munich at this stage in previous years. Yet this loss, at home, to a side perceived as underdogs, struck differently—a sobering reminder of the levels Arsenal needed to attain if they were to ever regain their former European glory."
