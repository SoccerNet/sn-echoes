think that's the big thing today\n1:10 Comment: the selection of Xhaka and Aguero up front I really do because already we've seen busquets\n1:15 Comment: picking the ball up with nobody nearing Manchester City will be outnumbered in midfield no doubt about\n1:20 Comment: that the fact we've got two up front Messi seeking out Neymar and Vincent Kompany only\n1:26 Comment: just caught up\n1:27 Comment: sensation and it's the final 2-2.\n1:29 Comment: Then abilities of the one on one be wahr\n1:32 Comment: b Gotta put that in there\n1:33 Comment: at the back to the top right here\n1:36 Comment: right over the top toring contender meant at 1 1\n1:38 Comment: with over the starting position Hamid\n1:50 Comment: Sergi\n1:52 Comment: 16 scoring球\n1:56 Comment: Here's Sergio Aguero, now Samir Nasr.\n2:1 Comment: Aguero trying to get free.\n2:7 Comment: Attacked though by Javier Mascherano,\n2:9 Comment: playing alongside Gerard Pique at the heart of the Barcelona defence.\n2:19 Comment: Aguero looking fit and sharp again.\n2:21 Comment: He's got a good shot.\n2:25 Comment: Neymar though to Suarez.\n2:31 Comment: Just gets with time again, Iniesta.\n2:34 Comment: Rakitic.\n2:37 Comment: Dani Alves inevitably will get forward a lot down that right-hand side,\n2:41 Comment: just tossed in towards the head of Luis Suarez.\n2:44 Comment: I think Manchester City will settle for that all night.\n2:47 Comment: Yeah, the thing is, Milner and Fernando are going to need some help in the midfield,\n2:50 Comment: and that means Nasri.\n2:51 Comment: And Silva tucking in nice and narrow,\n2:53 Comment: but all that does is just free up the full-backs for Barcelona.\n2:56 Comment: And Dani Alves does not need any invitation to get forward.\n3:0 Comment: Obviously hurt Manchester City last year in the same fixture,\n3:4 Comment: scored a goal and was dominant down that right-hand side.\n3:8 Comment: It has been said that City paid Barcelona too much respect a year ago\n3:11 Comment: when Alvaro Negredo was the lone frontman.\n3:13 Comment: Sergio Aguero was an absentee,\n3:15 Comment: Samir Nasri wasn't fit enough to start either.\n3:19 Comment: But more often than not,\n3:20 Comment: the charge levelled at City is that they've been too bold in the Champions League\n3:24 Comment: with their two-man strike force.\n3:33 Comment: City have got to get the ball to ring Checo and Aguero into the game first.\n3:40 Comment: It's all about information, Clive, it's all about passing people on,\n3:44 Comment: because you're not going to be stuck to the same player in midfield,\n3:47 Comment: you're going to have to switch from side to side.\n3:49 Comment: When one becomes free, you've got to move over, talking to each other.\n3:54 Comment: Touching Suarez was a little heavy, Busquets there rescued it for Jordi Alba,\n3:58 Comment: here's Iniesta.\n4:2 Comment: Neymar.\n4:8 Comment: Jordi Alba on the overlap here.\n4:13 Comment: Fluffed his lines.\n4:15 Comment: Luis Enrique is the coach of Barcelona, like Pep Guardiola\n4:22 Comment: and some of his most successful predecessors, a former Barcelona player.\n4:27 Comment: That counted for little when his head was on the chopping block\n4:30 Comment: at the start of the year.\n4:32 Comment: He's the third Barca coach in as many seasons.\n4:41 Comment: David Silva.\n4:42 Comment: Galtrici.\n4:48 Comment: A little hop coming to Sergio Aguero and he couldn't bring it under control.\n4:51 Comment: Suarez has done well, here's Messi.\n4:53 Comment: Now Rakitic.\n4:57 Comment: Just behind Iniesta and falls conveniently for Nasri.\n5:0 Comment: Here's Checo getting involved for virtually the first time.\n5:5 Comment: Fouled by Mascherano.\n5:7 Comment: Referee tonight is the experienced German Felix Brick.\n5:11 Comment: Manuel Pellegrini was unhappy with last year's referee from Sweden.\n5:20 Comment: Brick had charge of the Europa League final last year,\n5:22 Comment: so he's one of UEFA's top men.\n5:28 Comment: Feature of City's play as well from them wide areas when they've got the ball\n5:31 Comment: is that Nasri and Silva will come in field.\n5:35 Comment: And so they'll have men around the ball,\n5:37 Comment: but it's then, can they find the pass over the top for Aguero?\n5:41 Comment: Pass was just on there, Aguero was onside, but Grischi hesitated.\n5:54 Comment: James Milner has recovered from a knee injury to play towards Checo.\n5:58 Comment: And he's reached it, Checo's volley against Pique.\n6:1 Comment: Court holder won beautifully with his left foot here against Newcastle on Saturday.\n6:5 Comment: He's clapping for the ball because it's the right ball,\n6:7 Comment: he's just under-hit slightly from Milner,\n6:9 Comment: but got a lucky bounce.\n6:10 Comment: Got a lucky bounce and got his shot away.\n6:12 Comment: That's what we've got to do, getting his space in midfield,\n6:15 Comment: just knock the ball over the top for Aguero and Checo.\n6:29 Comment: City's final preparations could hardly have gone better,\n6:32 Comment: two games in the last two weeks, two wins, nine goals.\n6:36 Comment: Ouch.\n6:37 Comment: Barcelona beaten at the weekend, beaten at home by mid-table Malaga.\n6:44 Comment: They did beat City home and away a year ago,\n6:47 Comment: there is a gap in pedigree in this competition.\n6:50 Comment: And Checo will just need a moment.\n6:54 Comment: I don't know why, exactly, right there.\n6:57 Comment: Right at the belly button, I think.\n7:4 Comment: It's quite cold.\n7:7 Comment: Here's Community, ready at 5m.\n7:10 Comment: That's the treffen크�mekweselze,\n7:13 Comment: í\n7:33 Comment: There we go.\n7:34 Comment: And here's Aguero suddenly on the attack.\n7:38 Comment: It's called a free kick.\n7:39 Comment: Mascherano went to ground.\n7:41 Comment: Free kick in a dense position.\n7:44 Comment: Really clever play from Aguero.\n7:46 Comment: Just slows his run down and takes it away from Mascherano.\n7:49 Comment: Invites the tackle.\n7:51 Comment: Mascherano's shaking his hand, but there's no doubt about it.\n7:55 Comment: There's the contact, it's a free kick.\n8:4 Comment: Well, that's a big test of the evening coming the way of Marc-Andre Testega.\n8:11 Comment: And the volunteers, James Milner,\n8:14 Comment: who scored a terrific free kick here against Hull City the week before last.\n8:21 Comment: He spotted the ball.\n8:22 Comment: Sami Nasri is volunteering.\n8:24 Comment: David Silva's involved too.\n8:26 Comment: Should suit the right footer.\n8:28 Comment: Milner looks favourite here.\n8:34 Comment: Manchester City looking for liftoff.\n8:49 Comment: It's James Milner.\n8:51 Comment: He went low, maybe hoping the wall would jump.\n8:55 Comment: Aguero back on the ball.\n8:57 Comment: Not able to lick the salvo letter this time.\n9:0 Comment: This looks like an American football-type block.\n9:4 Comment: That by Aguero.\n9:6 Comment: He thought he was tricked.\n9:7 Comment: Throw in given.\n9:25 Comment: Neymar.\n9:30 Comment: PK to Dani Alves.\n9:34 Comment: He's got the ball.\n9:35 Comment: David Silva having to chase him back.\n9:39 Comment: Messi's escaped Milner.\n9:42 Comment: And given it straight to Salvo Leto.\n9:51 Comment: Silva.\n9:56 Comment: Milner to Fernando.\n9:57 Comment: Then Mimes haschied it.\n10:6 Comment: Benoist down, remaining on goal.\n10:9 Comment: Handed sent to Frey.\n10:10 Comment: Re Kirby.\n10:13 Comment: Telling Mr Sabna confiedm,\n10:15 Comment: didn't see it coming.\n10:20 Comment: Realised it would go best with a non-aimer.\n10:22 Comment: a fourth-aller on St avalanche.\n10:24 Comment: It's a penalty minute.\n10:25 Comment: till is half about it.\n10:26 Comment: Masha on it.\n10:32 Comment: Now Jordi Alba.\n10:35 Comment: Iniesta.\n10:38 Comment: Busquets.\n10:47 Comment: Messi getting it back from Dani Alves, being pursued by Gartlici.\n10:51 Comment: This is Iniesta.\n10:52 Comment: Now Neymar.\n10:54 Comment: He's got away from Sabaleta, but he's fed it into Messi,\n10:56 Comment: and it's a really good sliding challenge by Martin Demichelis,\n10:59 Comment: and it needed to be.\n11:1 Comment: What a touch from Neymar.\n11:3 Comment: He just sucked Sabaleta towards him, thought he was tight enough,\n11:6 Comment: but he wasn't.\n11:6 Comment: Little touch inside, he's already in the box.\n11:9 Comment: Great little ball to Messi.\n11:11 Comment: Neymar again running free, and the flag is up against Luis Suarez.\n11:18 Comment: Martin Demichelis hasn't played for two and a half weeks.\n11:24 Comment: Here's the touch.\n11:25 Comment: Bang.\n11:25 Comment: Inside of him.\n11:27 Comment: Defender can't do anything about that.\n11:28 Comment: That's just brilliant.\n11:31 Comment: He only played 53 minutes, you'll recall, of last year's meeting,\n11:35 Comment: before being red-carded.\n11:37 Comment: With a foul on Messi, which led to the penalty.\n11:40 Comment: Which led to the Barcelona victory.\n11:49 Comment: Fernando caught in possession by Rakitic, and here goes Luis Suarez.\n11:53 Comment: He has got support.\n11:55 Comment: Suarez.\n11:55 Comment: Looking for Rakitic.\n11:57 Comment: Demichelis in the way.\n11:58 Comment: Suarez going for goal.\n11:59 Comment: It's to Sainetti.\n12:1 Comment: He's caught in two minds, I think.\n12:3 Comment: I think he just ran out of pace, Suarez.\n12:5 Comment: Just couldn't quite get back down the outside.\n12:8 Comment: Cut back.\n12:9 Comment: Bad mistake.\n12:10 Comment: Rakitic really tight.\n12:12 Comment: Just here.\n12:13 Comment: Company does well to get back.\n12:16 Comment: It's a poor ball for him.\n12:18 Comment: That's a poor shot for him as well.\n12:21 Comment: This Barcelona career hasn't quite taken off.\n12:23 Comment: He had to wait until late October,\n12:25 Comment: for his debut, because of the ban carried over from his World Cup finals headlines.\n12:36 Comment: Dzeko has found Nasri.\n12:41 Comment: Dzeko has found a cross.\n12:43 Comment: And found Pica.\n12:48 Comment: Neymar linking with Suarez.\n12:50 Comment: Not a good pass.\n12:51 Comment: Klici seizes upon it.\n12:53 Comment: Gets it back from David Silva.\n12:55 Comment: He's tied.\n13:4 Comment: Elves.\n13:10 Comment: A pass along the throat.\n13:14 Comment: And I have seen Champions League games, in the last few years,\n13:16 Comment: were ten minutes in, you wonder whether the opponents\n13:19 Comment: are ever going to get a kick of the ball.\n13:21 Comment: Manchester City have been rights in this.\n13:22 Comment: This started really well, actually.\n13:24 Comment: It took the game to adapt.\n13:25 Comment: Barcelona.\n13:28 Comment: We've got a high tempo.\n13:30 Comment: The movement in midfield when they haven't\n13:31 Comment: got the ball is really good.\n13:34 Comment: Just got to break on them a little\n13:36 Comment: bit quicker when you get the ball.\n13:37 Comment: Easier said than done. Barcelona down to\n13:39 Comment: 10 at the moment. Neymar's off the field receiving\n13:41 Comment: treatment. Aguero to Milner.\n13:45 Comment: Quite sure what he had\n13:47 Comment: in mind there.\n13:49 Comment: Came back into full training yesterday after\n13:51 Comment: nursing a knee problem\n13:52 Comment: for a week or so. James Milner.\n13:55 Comment: Problem for Neymar\n13:57 Comment: seems to be more to do with\n13:59 Comment: the thread on his tyres.\n14:8 Comment: The other game being played\n14:9 Comment: in the Champions League this evening is in\n14:11 Comment: Turin and Carlos Temes\n14:13 Comment: has given Juventus the lead against\n14:15 Comment: Borussia Dortmund. Juventus 1, Borussia Dortmund\n14:17 Comment: 0.\n14:25 Comment: Extra\n14:25 Comment: man in midfield not been that evident for\n14:27 Comment: Barcelona as yet. Dzeko just dropping off\n14:29 Comment: Aguero, taking him in turns just to try\n14:31 Comment: and fill that gap that Busquets is trying to get into.\n14:34 Comment: That allows\n14:35 Comment: Fernando and Milner to pick\n14:37 Comment: Rakitic up and Iniesta.\n14:40 Comment: And the back four can look after\n14:41 Comment: them three up top.\n14:43 Comment: All the better with that.\n14:52 Comment: It's\n14:53 Comment: much as he may\n14:53 Comment: have to almost accept little\n14:55 Comment: lulls in play where Barcelona do dominate the ball.\n14:59 Comment: Just keep their shape, keep their patience,\n15:1 Comment: wait their moment and get involved again.\n15:4 Comment: I think the atmosphere here has been better than we've had in games gone past.\n15:10 Comment: They've got to try and keep the crowd entertained because that certainly does help.\n15:15 Comment: Typical Barcelona possession statistics.\n15:23 Comment: Messi in towards the end.\n15:24 Comment: A little bit of a pass by Di Paglia.\n15:24 Comment: It's a very good pass.\n15:26 Comment: It might break through again and he's scored.\n15:29 Comment: Luis Suarez back on English soil.\n15:32 Comment: Gives Barcelona\n15:33 Comment: the breakthrough with 16 minutes played.\n15:38 Comment: Ball fell very, very kindly for him.\n15:41 Comment: But he made the most of his fortune.\n15:44 Comment: And Manuel Pellegrini's team have got to come from behind again.\n15:50 Comment: Well, he just gets lucky.\n15:52 Comment: He tries to flick the ball on and it hits company\n15:54 Comment: and bounces.\n15:55 Comment: Straight back to him.\n15:56 Comment: And then he just swings that left foot on it.\n15:58 Comment: Great finish.\n15:59 Comment: Bart, no chance.\n16:0 Comment: Comes at him really quick and low.\n16:3 Comment: You have to say the bounce is lucky,\n16:4 Comment: but those three who play up front make their own luck.\n16:11 Comment: Delightful Luis Enrique,\n16:13 Comment: but nothing like the delight that he will be feeling now.\n16:17 Comment: He's got a tremendous goal in a league game last week,\n16:20 Comment: a scissors kick,\n16:21 Comment: which just announced his talent,\n16:25 Comment: and that's to the Barcelona public.\n16:27 Comment: But that is the best moment yet in Luis Suarez's short Barcelona career.\n16:34 Comment: And away goal.\n16:37 Comment: We talked about before, staying in the tie.\n16:40 Comment: Obviously, they conceded a goal right in the 90th minute last year for a 2-0 defeat.\n16:47 Comment: Got to stay in the game.\n16:50 Comment: Aguero.\n16:55 Comment: Silva back to Milner.\n16:57 Comment: Here's Nazri.\n17:0 Comment: It's a good ball towards Aguero.\n17:2 Comment: Just a little too tall for him.\n17:4 Comment: Made by Dani Alves.\n17:6 Comment: Demichelis is there.\n17:9 Comment: Clici caught in possession by Messi.\n17:13 Comment: Trying to play Neymar in.\n17:16 Comment: See how much quicker Barcelona are prepared to play the ball forward\n17:20 Comment: than we've seen in previous years.\n17:21 Comment: Nice.\n17:25 Comment: Good catcher attacking team now.\n17:26 Comment: It's really obvious, isn't it?\n17:27 Comment: Because a few years ago, they didn't really have anybody to play the ball up to, did they?\n17:31 Comment: False number nine, Fabregas playing up there.\n17:34 Comment: Now all of a sudden they've got three players.\n17:36 Comment: They can mix it up as well.\n17:37 Comment: One can go right and left, they can swap it around.\n17:41 Comment: That ball up to them, they all sort of converge into the same area and play off each other.\n17:51 Comment: Zabaleta couldn't resist.\n17:52 Comment: He got the ball.\n17:53 Comment: Here's Fernando.\n17:54 Comment: Now Dzeko.\n17:55 Comment: Can't get past Mascherano.\n17:58 Comment: He has to tidy his up.\n18:1 Comment: Neymar in the wars.\n18:2 Comment: There's a flag up against Luis Suarez.\n18:10 Comment: Man City have got to try and get the ball right, Clive.\n18:12 Comment: You know, when you've got that cross just then, it looked dangerous.\n18:16 Comment: Get the ball wide.\n18:16 Comment: It's very difficult when you're trying to play narrow when you haven't got the ball.\n18:19 Comment: As soon as you win it, you've got five players, Nasri, Silva, your full backs.\n18:23 Comment: You've got to try and get wide and feed the two strikers.\n18:26 Comment: You're playing with two up front for a reason.\n18:28 Comment: Give them something to feed off.\n18:36 Comment: Already you feel the ties on a knife edge because the second Barcelona goal will be so damaging now.\n18:48 Comment: Luis Suarez's first goal at the Etihad.\n18:53 Comment: It's only his tenth match in the Champions League, which you believe.\n18:59 Comment: Now we've played in the competition for Liverpool.\n19:2 Comment: We've got a start on it with Ajax.\n19:5 Comment: And now he can feel confident.\n19:8 Comment: A lot more Champions League appearances to come with Barcelona.\n19:16 Comment: Busquets winning the ball from Nasri.\n19:18 Comment: Messi.\n19:21 Comment: That was good.\n19:23 Comment: That's brilliant play.\n19:25 Comment: Here's Dani Alves.\n19:29 Comment: Clipped towards Suarez.\n19:31 Comment: Oh, it hit Neymar.\n19:32 Comment: Almost fell kindly for Messi again.\n19:35 Comment: Brilliant link-up play from Messi.\n19:38 Comment: And Alves, he knew the ball was going to come to him eventually, so Alves just kept his run going.\n19:43 Comment: Messi turned inside.\n19:46 Comment: Great ball.\n19:48 Comment: Aguero.\n19:51 Comment: Nasri.\n19:51 Comment: Nobody wide to the right.\n19:53 Comment: Only Klici up on this left-hand side.\n19:56 Comment: Now Dzeko.\n20:0 Comment: David Silva.\n20:1 Comment: Klici.\n20:3 Comment: Three blue shirts in the box.\n20:5 Comment: One of them, Dzeko!\n20:7 Comment: Well, then there is a vulnerability.\n20:9 Comment: Maybe it is at the heart of that Barcelona defence when the ball's in the air.\n20:13 Comment: Well, they don't like crosses in the box, as simple as that, so give them what they don't like.\n20:17 Comment: Get the ball wide, as I said.\n20:19 Comment: Could be full-backs, could be wide players.\n20:21 Comment: You get a chance to cross it, cross it.\n20:23 Comment: In the night's other Champions League game, Juventus won, Borussia Dortmund won.\n20:28 Comment: Marco Reus has cancelled that Tevez goal.\n20:33 Comment: Company winning the ball from Suarez.\n20:35 Comment: German referee giving the game every chance.\n20:39 Comment: He's prepared to see full-blooded challenges.\n20:42 Comment: David Chalice's pass has been picked up by Messi.\n20:46 Comment: Here's Suarez.\n20:53 Comment: Jordi Alba.\n20:55 Comment: Little high for Messi, but Dani Alba's the other full-back's out.\n21:1 Comment: Almost passed it back to the left-back.\n21:5 Comment: Five players forward there as well, Barcelona.\n21:9 Comment: Both full-backs at the same time.\n21:11 Comment: So disheartening from a back four when you've done pretty much everything right.\n21:17 Comment: They haven't given Barcelona a sniff, really.\n21:19 Comment: And all of a sudden, lucky rebound.\n21:21 Comment: 1-0 down.\n21:23 Comment: Like, this is where the furs in the smell, right?\n21:28 Comment: Sensational flatter.\n21:30 Comment: See, Mourinho, you Si!\n21:32 Comment: Here goes Alberto Abique!\n21:32 Comment: Kanime too, right?\n21:35 Comment: Well done!\n21:43 Comment: They've found entendeu Porto here.\n21:45 Comment: Personal Messi here.\n21:50 Comment: Dani Alba.\n21:51 Comment: Minyo certificado here.\n21:53 Comment: and Nasri, Jordi Alba deals with it.\n21:56 Comment: Neymar helps him on his way.\n21:58 Comment: One back though by Fernando.\n22:5 Comment: Can't be done first by Jordi Alba and then by Seraph Pique.\n22:8 Comment: Here's Neymar.\n22:9 Comment: And Barcelona now have the luxury of just taking some of the sting out of the game.\n22:27 Comment: Starting to consolidate on the lead that Luis Suarez has given them.\n22:36 Comment: Mascherano.\n22:38 Comment: Carrying the flag.\n22:39 Comment: Here's Neymar.\n22:42 Comment: Iniesta.\n22:50 Comment: Busquets.\n22:53 Comment: So many options for the man in possession.\n23:1 Comment: Lots of pointing going on in the midfield of Manchester City.\n23:4 Comment: But not a lot of marking.\n23:5 Comment: Got to engage the ball a little bit more.\n23:7 Comment: Yes, they're tired.\n23:8 Comment: They haven't had the ball.\n23:9 Comment: For a while.\n23:10 Comment: They're five yards off.\n23:12 Comment: That's not close enough.\n23:14 Comment: Pique resisting.\n23:16 Comment: Xhaka's attentions.\n23:19 Comment: Messi.\n23:27 Comment: Neymar.\n23:46 Comment: Help.\n23:54 Comment: Get out.\n23:54 Comment: Neymar.\n24:4 Comment: It's going to play with a bit of SWA proposal.\n24:7 Comment: Se Batman, alright now.\n24:8 Comment: It's been break down.\n24:8 Comment: After this are we seeing nobody together.\n24:8 Comment: Next up Nile S центral.\n24:8 Comment: the clear flag was up he was offside that was about 100 passes wasn't it\n24:18 Comment: in the end when the ball comes in he just wandered offside\n24:24 Comment: it's no good having a blue shirt in front of the yellow shirt if you don't then go to the ball\n24:28 Comment: because he'll just pick any pass he wants and then you're going on your own\n24:32 Comment: you've got to go in twos and threes you can't close down on your own\n24:38 Comment: so\n24:59 Comment: south india strolled against newcastle here brought\n25:1 Comment: manchester city their first clean sheet of 2015.\n25:7 Comment: barcelona had scored 35\n25:8 Comment: four goals in their last 10 games it's the kind of average that they found since the turn of the year\n25:19 Comment: and it's ominous with an early breakthrough to build on\n25:28 Comment: name up luis suarez has got it behind company it's a good stop that by joe hart\n25:35 Comment: it's a really good save from joe hart he's really quick off his line but\n25:38 Comment: such a simple ball

be marked tight from throw-ins.\n28:57 Comment: Just five yards off every single player on the pitch.\n29:0 Comment: Just chasing shadows at the moment.\n29:10 Comment: It's a tiring game to play without the ball, isn't it?\n29:12 Comment: It is, and I think, you know, you've got two up front,\n29:14 Comment: so you're going to be outnumbered in midfield.\n29:16 Comment: But if you are going to be outnumbered,\n29:18 Comment: then hit a couple of balls over the top to the two you've got up top.\n29:21 Comment: Or get the ball wide and get the ball in the box where you've got an extra man.\n29:31 Comment: Rakitic.\n29:34 Comment: Messi.\n29:37 Comment: Now Jordi Alba.\n29:41 Comment: Oh, it's brilliant, Suarez has got another.\n29:43 Comment: Manchester City totally undone.\n29:46 Comment: Luis Suarez has struck twice in the opening half an hour.\n29:51 Comment: And already this Champions League tie is drifting beyond the home team.\n29:57 Comment: 2-0 to Barcelona.\n29:59 Comment: Well, Suarez will get the credit for the goal, quite rightly so,\n30:2 Comment: but Magic Man Messi, what a pair of feet he's got on him.\n30:6 Comment: Well, one foot, he's left one. Watch this.\n30:9 Comment: Just absolutely brilliant. Gets the ball, close control.\n30:12 Comment: Three, four players, plays a perfect pass up and then just waits.\n30:15 Comment: Suarez runs across his defender.\n30:18 Comment: Dimitrescu should come to the near post to try and cut anything up,\n30:22 Comment: but he just waits.\n30:24 Comment: And Suarez just nips in between.\n30:28 Comment: You have to say, you feel the tie is already done.\n30:33 Comment: Jordi Alba had a lot of time there to pick that cross for Suarez.\n30:39 Comment: But it was Lionel Messi's initial incursion.\n30:42 Comment: Which put Manchester City on the back foot.\n30:54 Comment: And scored in each of the last two group games,\n30:57 Comment: Luis Suarez are now registering here in the knockout phase.\n31:4 Comment: Not in double figures yet for Barcelona,\n31:6 Comment: but he might be by the end of the night.\n31:8 Comment: He might be by the end of the half.\n31:10 Comment: Almost stolen away from Demichelis there.\n31:18 Comment: Pellegrini's got some work to do at half-time.\n31:20 Comment: Hopefully they get to half-time at 2-0.\n31:23 Comment: Because the way it's going,\n31:26 Comment: Barcelona are completely dominating possession like we thought they would.\n31:30 Comment: And here's Neymar, in on Hart.\n31:32 Comment: Lobb-Gorwood's sub-letter in control of the situation,\n31:36 Comment: but Barcelona are in control of the game.\n31:40 Comment: Iniesta.\n31:48 Comment: The players are making run beyond the back four,\n31:50 Comment: because the man on the ball has got so much time to play any pass he wants.\n31:55 Comment: He can pick and choose when he plays the pass,\n31:57 Comment: so they're timing the runs perfectly\n31:59 Comment: to get behind the back four of Man City.\n32:1 Comment: Put pressure on the ball.\n32:5 Comment: And having started the game with two fours,\n32:7 Comment: I suppose there's no way now to go back.\n32:10 Comment: In order just to try to get a foothold in midfield and keep the score down.\n32:16 Comment: You've got to change it, Clive.\n32:17 Comment: You can't carry on doing the same mistakes,\n32:19 Comment: because, yes, they're working hard,\n32:21 Comment: but they're working hard to a point.\n32:22 Comment: They're keeping everything in front of them, Man City,\n32:24 Comment: but not engaging the player on the ball.\n32:26 Comment: So he's picking any pass he wants to play.\n32:28 Comment: And Barcelona are 2-0 up,\n32:30 Comment: and really could be anything before half-time.\n32:33 Comment: Really could.\n32:34 Comment: His team forced a mistake there,\n32:36 Comment: but Barcelona have won it back quickly,\n32:38 Comment: and Messi has found Suarez,\n32:40 Comment: and here's Jordi Alba.\n32:43 Comment: So smooth coming forward.\n32:45 Comment: Neymar cut up by Kompany.\n32:48 Comment: David Silva having to try and help out.\n32:51 Comment: He's done really well because he was surrounded.\n32:57 Comment: He was just clipped there by Suarez,\n32:59 Comment: the referee gave it a chance,\n33:1 Comment: and then brought play back.\n33:3 Comment: So Juve won, Dortmund won in the night's other game,\n33:6 Comment: and there will be highlights of that,\n33:8 Comment: and indeed this game on ITV,\n33:9 Comment: at 10.40 this evening.\n33:11 Comment: And on Thursday we've got live football from the Europa League,\n33:15 Comment: starting with Liverpool in action in Turkey at 5.30,\n33:19 Comment: and then Everton from 7.45,\n33:22 Comment: both of those on ITV4.\n33:25 Comment: CHANTING\n33:41 Comment: David Silva.\n33:43 Comment: Here's Xhaka.\n33:45 Comment: CHANTING\n33:49 Comment: Just a correction to the information I just gave you,\n33:51 Comment: the Everton game against Young Boys is actually on ITV,\n33:55 Comment: the main channel here from 7.45 on Thursday.\n33:58 Comment: Liverpool on ITV4 at Tito.\n34:0 Comment: CHANTING\n34:5 Comment: Well, they've got to try and make challenges,\n34:7 Comment: they've got to try and impose themselves on the games,\n34:9 Comment: Abeleta's that kind of character.\n34:12 Comment: He has been the one who's been tight on Neymar quite often.\n34:16 Comment: The rest of them in midfield are just looking over the shoulder about who's going to go first,\n34:21 Comment: and in the end no-one's going to the ball,\n34:23 Comment: and no-one's following up behind, and they're just going outrun.\n34:26 Comment: Messi just running away from Klichy with the ball.\n34:30 Comment: Unable to play, Iniesta in.\n34:32 Comment: The one that's profited from some loose play from Kompany.\n34:37 Comment: They almost need the half-time whistle here,\n34:39 Comment: Manchester City, they look a bit groggy.\n34:42 Comment: They need the floodlights to go out, that's what they need.\n34:48 Comment: But he will have to change it, Cali Green, at half-time,\n34:50 Comment: and have to change the midfield set-up.\n34:59 Comment: Barcelona's dominance on the line.\n35:7 Comment: Kupi, Kupi, Kupi!\n35:18 Comment: Rakitic to Busquets, now Messi.\n35:23 Comment: Here's Neymar.\n35:25 Comment: He's played in Messi this time, still in on Messi.\n35:29 Comment: Good stop by Joe Hart, he's having to be alert and courageous here, the England keeper.\n35:33 Comment: Absolutely brilliant again.\n35:35 Comment: He just carries on his run.\n35:37 Comment: Almost the perfect ball for him, but Joe Hart does well,\n35:40 Comment: really quick off his line, spots the danger.\n35:44 Comment: Spreads himself.\n36:1 Comment: Klichy.\n36:2 Comment: He's got the ball, he's got the ball.\n36:4 Comment: He's got the ball.\n36:6 Comment: Headed by Pique.\n36:9 Comment: Rakitic was caught in possession.\n36:13 Comment: In the Blig by Nye.\n36:15 Comment: The yellow shirts are back on the ball.\n36:18 Comment: Manchester City haven't hit the ball over the top of the bat for Barcelona once yet.\n36:24 Comment: You've got Pique and Mascherano, and know for a fact they don't like to run back to their own goals,\n36:28 Comment: because I didn't as a defender, you don't want to do that.\n36:30 Comment: So why wouldn't you hit a few more?\n36:31 Comment: So why wouldn't you hit a few over the top?\n36:35 Comment: Mascherano allowed to come forward.\n36:36 Comment: Demichelis with the interception.\n36:46 Comment: Nuno losing the ball.\n36:47 Comment: Iniesta.\n36:48 Comment: Suarez has made the diagonal run.\n37:1 Comment: Jota is on the set.\n37:10 Comment: The lap from Rakitic.\n37:12 Comment: Messy.\n37:19 Comment: The brilliance is catching.\n37:22 Comment: Look how much time each player has got on the ball.\n37:27 Comment: Yes, Zabaleta got in a challenge again there on Neymar.\n37:31 Comment: FANS ROAR\n37:47 Comment: One by Demichelis, one by Dani Alves.\n37:52 Comment: Messi...\n37:53 Comment: slipped into Dani Alves, he tried to return the ball to Lionel Messi,\n37:58 Comment: but Milner came between them.\n37:59 Comment: Aguero.\n38:1 Comment: Manchester City give themselves a lift before half-time.\n38:4 Comment: Edin Dzeko.\n38:7 Comment: Perfectly time-challenged by Gerard Pique.\n38:11 Comment: And David Silva's been penalised.\n38:23 Comment: Just couldn't quite get enough men forward on City on that break,\n38:27 Comment: that's the trouble, you spend all the time chasing the ball.\n38:29 Comment: When you do get it, you haven't got the energy to get up the pitch.\n38:37 Comment: A little spin in the casino, doesn't seem to have affected Pique all that much.\n38:43 Comment: Maybe we should all try it.\n38:50 Comment: Neymar.\n38:52 Comment: One back by Fernando.\n38:59 Comment: David Silva.\n39:0 Comment: Here's Dzeko.\n39:1 Comment: That's drifted out to that left-hand side a lot, Edin Dzeko.\n39:6 Comment: It's down its way to Clichy.\n39:8 Comment: Mascherano attacking the ball, David Silva's got it back.\n39:12 Comment: Way by Jordi Alba as far as James Milner.\n39:15 Comment: Alba riding his luck, Dzeko with the shot, blocked by Pique,\n39:19 Comment: survives the handball appeals.\n39:25 Comment: He was just inside the box.\n39:27 Comment: Big appeals as well from Dzeko.\n39:29 Comment: Here's Rakitic.\n39:30 Comment: And now Lionel Messi going clear.\n39:36 Comment: Kompany got to the wall.\n39:37 Comment: Maybe Messi just stood on it.\n39:39 Comment: It's been a while, the challenge for Rakitic on Kompany.\n39:46 Comment: Maybe Manchester City just need the game to run a bit of a fever.\n40:0 Comment: Milner to Clichy.\n40:4 Comment: That's a dreadful cross from a very good position.\n40:7 Comment: Yeah, he'll be really disappointed with himself there.\n40:10 Comment: Good position, time to look up.\n40:13 Comment: Awful cross.\n40:14 Comment: This is the shot from Dzeko.\n40:18 Comment: Ooh.\n40:19 Comment: He hit his arm, there's no doubt about that.\n40:22 Comment: Can he get out of the way of that?\n40:24 Comment: I don't think that's handball, to be honest with you.\n40:26 Comment: It's right on the edge.\n40:27 Comment: Yeah.\n40:28 Comment: Well, I think he probably would have been outside anyway, but...\n40:33 Comment: Super slow-mo, it looks like it's not going that fast.\n40:36 Comment: He literally...\n40:38 Comment: didn't look like he moved his arm towards the ball.\n40:41 Comment: He had a card for that rather wild mischallenge by Rakitic downfield\n40:45 Comment: a moment or two ago.\n40:51 Comment: Yeah, almost instinctively led towards the flight of the ball.\n40:55 Comment: Oh!\n40:56 Comment: Yes!\n40:58 Comment: And that's the end of the match.\n40:59 Comment: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n41:0 Comment: And Manchester City are in need of a break.\n41:16 Comment: Company dealing with Suarez.\n41:21 Comment: And his two goals are the difference so far.\n41:24 Comment: Well, one of the differences.\n41:28 Comment: Nazri Di Clici.\n41:36 Comment: Silva.\n41:37 Comment: Clici.\n41:40 Comment: David Silva.\n41:45 Comment: James Milner.\n41:46 Comment: Clipped in towards Zabaleta.\n41:48 Comment: Jordi Alba did pretty well, actually, and Zabaleta fouled him.\n41:54 Comment: He did well, Alba, following his...\n41:56 Comment: opposition full-back.\n41:59 Comment: He kept his eye on the ball,\n42:0 Comment: rendered himself a free-kick.\n42:2 Comment: Good tracking from the full-back.\n42:4 Comment: You wouldn't put them in your World XI, any of the back four, for Barcelona,\n42:8 Comment: but when you've got the ball for as much as they have in a half,\n42:10 Comment: you don't do much defending, do they?\n42:12 Comment: Roy Hodgson's World Player of the Year there.\n42:14 Comment: Really?\n42:15 Comment: He's not mine.\n42:18 Comment: Had a good year, Javier Mascherano, for club and country.\n42:22 Comment: And he's having a good night.\n42:26 Comment: He's got a good season.\n42:29 Comment: Offside.\n42:35 Comment: Just feel as if City have let them off the hook, though, at the back.\n42:38 Comment: They haven't tested them at all.\n42:43 Comment: It's easier said than done, I understand that.\n42:45 Comment: It looks easy from here when you say close the ball down, press the ball,\n42:49 Comment: et cetera, but at least try.\n42:51 Comment: It seems a long time ago now,\n42:56 Comment: but the first 12, 15 minutes went pretty well for Manchester City.\n43:0 Comment: Luis Suarez did get a big slice of luck in the way the ball fell for him\n43:5 Comment: to take his first goal superbly.\n43:8 Comment: But it's been one-way traffic since then.\n43:15 Comment: Oh, it's a kind bounce off Milner now for Dani Alves.\n43:22 Comment: And Joe Hart has somehow helped it onto the crossbar.\n43:27 Comment: I think he's given a goal kick.\n43:29 Comment: Well, that was nearly genius from Dani Alves.\n43:32 Comment: He gets lucky with the rebound off Milner,\n43:34 Comment: but he definitely means this for a little chip.\n43:38 Comment: Straight off the top of the crossbar and he owes it as well.\n43:42 Comment: And Hart couldn't reach it.\n43:51 Comment: But admittedly, at the end of the hole and coming back on vale,\n43:54 Comment: H objections to had stopped.\n43:56 Comment: But admittedly, at the end of the hole and coming back on vale,\n43:57 Comment: and then watching from the bottom of the green light,\n44:0 Comment: it's two thirds of chroma and that about racing into him.\n44:4 Comment: So there's nothing wrong about seeing a start from a drive-by,\n44:7 Comment: but just having a goodly night's rest,\n44:10 Comment: dried off saved Simeone Hill ,\n44:13 Comment: and then, on the other hand,\n44:15 Comment: in a trial at Arles area.\n44:16 Comment: Not too sure he got too much on it.\n44:31 Comment: There's a free-kick situation where you would think that Manchester City\n44:34 Comment: would just take the opportunity to get the ball into the box.\n44:37 Comment: It might not be particularly scientific,\n44:39 Comment: but they've got to ask some questions of Barcelona somehow.\n44:46 Comment: Milner seeking out Aguero, it's a good ball.\n44:58 Comment: Here's Nasri!\n45:0 Comment: Might come for Aguero.\n45:2 Comment: Jordi Alba got to him.\n45:6 Comment: Corner kick.\n45:7 Comment: Now it's a big finish for the half of Manchester City.\n45:9 Comment: It's a big finish.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Let's go to Lee Dixon and Clive Tilsley\n0:3 Comment: Manchester City have just lost a little of their\n0:6 Comment: invincibility\n0:7 Comment: Home more than a little tonight as many defeats as wins in this competition since the start of last season\n0:15 Comment: But an early corner here\n0:17 Comment: This is their 21st home match of this season already five losses\n0:22 Comment: Middlesbrough have won his CSKA Moscow of one here Stoke Newcastle\n0:30 Comment: and\n0:32 Comment: They've got a chance to get a shot on goal\n0:34 Comment: I think he missed it but it fell\n0:36 Comment: Kindly in the box\n0:40 Comment: Did get a touch on it\n0:42 Comment: Just couldn't take control of it least it's a chance to maybe get a shot on goal\n0:51 Comment: And\n0:53 Comment: He's got a chance to get a shot on goal\n1:0 Comment: So it's a chance to take control of the game\n1:2 Comment: He's got a chance to get a shot on goal\n1:4 Comment: Come on\n1:6 Comment: He's got a chance to get a shot on goal\n1:8 Comment: Come on\n1:10 Comment: Towards the head of Shekhar again PK up above him\n1:15 Comment: Now sorry\n1:21 Comment: Tishy\n1:29 Comment: FANS ROAR\n1:35 Comment: Zabaleta to Fernando.\n1:44 Comment: Klici.\n1:46 Comment: Into Aguero.\n1:48 Comment: He's gathered that in well.\n1:51 Comment: Corner kick conceded by Javier Mascherano.\n1:59 Comment: It's a good one.\n2:7 Comment: Silva with the corner.\n2:9 Comment: Swarczeko!\n2:11 Comment: One more encouragement in the opening couple of minutes of this second half\n2:15 Comment: than there was in much of the first.\n2:17 Comment: Well, the quality on the corner has been better already.\n2:20 Comment: In the post on three occasions in the first half.\n2:26 Comment: No change in personnel,\n2:28 Comment: but there has to be a change in our side.\n2:29 Comment: City are going to play in this second half.\n2:31 Comment: Got to be more direct.\n2:33 Comment: More balls over the top.\n2:35 Comment: Sounds simple, but got to get possession.\n2:38 Comment: We've had that in the first five or six minutes of this half.\n2:48 Comment: Messi's taken a chance and lost the ball.\n2:50 Comment: Fernando.\n2:51 Comment: Klici.\n2:54 Comment: Manchester City forcing one or two errors.\n2:56 Comment: Heading to Sheko.\n2:57 Comment: Slip through to David Silva.\n2:59 Comment: Cut back here to Samir Nasri.\n3:1 Comment: Great block by Mascherano.\n3:4 Comment: Now Klici.\n3:5 Comment: Tossed in towards Sheko.\n3:7 Comment: Hook goes down looking for a penalty.\n3:9 Comment: And is told to get to his feet.\n3:14 Comment: Rakitic trying to fire it forward towards Suarez.\n3:17 Comment: Manchester City pressure.\n3:22 Comment: Fernando.\n3:23 Comment: He's got the ball.\n3:25 Comment: Fernando.\n3:26 Comment: Nasri.\n3:32 Comment: Sheko.\n3:35 Comment: Hits a corner.\n3:37 Comment: Came off the chest of midriff of Gerard Piqué.\n3:41 Comment: This is Nasri's shot.\n3:42 Comment: Great little pass from Silva to pull it back to him on the edge of the box.\n3:46 Comment: And a good block from Mascherano.\n3:48 Comment: Get the quality of this corner right.\n3:50 Comment: Put him under pressure again.\n3:53 Comment: Silva takes.\n3:54 Comment: In towards Kompany.\n3:55 Comment: Sheko!\n3:56 Comment: Oh, what a chance.\n3:57 Comment: What a chance.\n3:58 Comment: Just a yard either side of Ter Stegen and surely he would have scored.\n4:4 Comment: Well, Kompany getting to the near post again.\n4:6 Comment: The flick on and there he is standing still.\n4:8 Comment: Because he's standing still, he can't get enough power into it.\n4:11 Comment: Straight at the goalkeeper.\n4:13 Comment: What a big miss.\n4:18 Comment: This sets it now or never for Manchester City.\n4:21 Comment: They have some momentum.\n4:24 Comment: But Lionel Messi has the ball.\n4:27 Comment: It's pushed over by Kompany who is straining to get to Lionel Messi.\n4:54 Comment: He's got the ball.\n5:4 Comment: Three in Hart's walk.\n5:5 Comment: Messi has Piqué forward from the back.\n5:12 Comment: Lionel Messi headed by Milner.\n5:16 Comment: Comes in from Sheko but the referee won't play on.\n5:22 Comment: Piqué.\n5:32 Comment: There's an intensity from Manchester City this first few minutes of the second half.\n5:37 Comment: They've got a build on that.\n5:39 Comment: They're not used to not having the ball, Barcelona.\n5:43 Comment: Watch the game, please.\n5:52 Comment: A brief break.\n5:56 Comment: As the crowd goes to the to the

well there.\n6:10 Comment: Messi had made an absolutely sublime run off the back of him.\n6:13 Comment: Picked out by Suarez, and just enough on the centre-back.\n6:16 Comment: Look at that run, just off the back of his number.\n6:20 Comment: in the end\n6:20 Comment: there's been an element of brinksmanship about this\n6:24 Comment: entire Champions League campaign\n6:26 Comment: for Manchester

started that attack\n8:38 Comment: with a with a tackle but he did aguero just can't get his foot right around it enough\n8:43 Comment: to say again thought it was worth a dive and it was\n8:47 Comment: really close good play from man city pressing high winning the ball back in the last third\n8:59 Comment: messy\n9:3 Comment: iniesta\n9:7 Comment: never frightened to go back to come forward again\n9:17 Comment: control over the ball equals control over the game for barcelona\n9:29 Comment: barcelona\n9:33 Comment: messi\n9:37 Comment: just opened up for him trying to nut it into the

Comment: junior\n10:30 Comment: probably score from this now\n10:31 Comment: i've lost it here's aflower\n10:33 Comment: Aguero, just as they are getting a little bit of pressure on the ball now.\n10:38 Comment: Dzeko into the path of Klici.\n10:42 Comment: Dzeko has gone on, it's a terrific pass from Klici,\n10:45 Comment: good cover from Gerard Piquet.\n10:48 Comment: The Barcelona are being stretched for the first time all night.\n10:51 Comment: Really good play from Dzeko, didn't do that once in the first half.\n10:55 Comment: He laid the ball off and he pointed into the corner and said,\n10:57 Comment: put it round the back of the full-back and I'll chase it, and he did.\n11:3 Comment: David Silva with the corner.\n11:8 Comment: Headed by Suarez.\n11:14 Comment: Milius' foot was a little high.\n11:33 Comment: Two centre-backs are forward, but with Nasri and Silva over the ball,\n11:41 Comment: Ter Stegen bracing himself for the possibility of an attempt on his goal.\n11:47 Comment: Silva's just going to touch it and just give himself a bit of a better angle\n11:50 Comment: to try and whip it into that far post.\n11:57 Comment: Towards Dzeko again, in goes Demichelis.\n12:1 Comment: No one forces a save at least.\n12:3 Comment: He's got a good free kick.\n12:4 Comment: Yeah, decent free kick.\n12:5 Comment: Just gave himself that little bit of extra width\n12:8 Comment: to get the ball and the angle behind the back four.\n12:12 Comment: Fabulous clear from Ter Stegen.\n12:14 Comment: Messi here has said that he's better on the ball than he is.\n12:17 Comment: I'm not really sure about that, but he is.\n12:20 Comment: Rather, his fellow countryman, Manuel Neuer, is a goalkeeper who likes to play.\n12:25 Comment: Here's Dani Alves.\n12:26 Comment: Well seen by Demichelis.\n12:31 Comment: Dzeko.\n12:32 Comment: Lord.\n12:33 Comment: Mascherano in, but the decision's gone the other way.\n12:38 Comment: He's got to get in front of Mascherano then.\n12:41 Comment: The reason why he gives a free kick away,\n12:42 Comment: because he allows the centre-back in front of him.\n12:45 Comment: And then he wrestles.\n12:46 Comment: It's a free kick, but he should be stronger than that.\n12:49 Comment: Hold the ball up, bring your midfield players into play.\n12:55 Comment: Suarez.\n12:57 Comment: Just beyond Rakitic, but he got to

Comment: Quality of the ball into the box.\n17:1 Comment: Just one goal, just a base camp for the climb above.\n17:8 Comment: Milner.\n17:9 Comment: Easy enough for Pique.\n17:17 Comment: Nice and easy.\n17:26 Comment: That's a good kick.\n17:40 Comment: Manchester City certainly have forced the issue more since the break.\n17:45 Comment: Jordi Alba.\n17:47 Comment: Neymar giving Zabaleta the slip momentarily, but he gets some help from Fernandinho.\n18:4 Comment: One by Rakitic.\n18:6 Comment: One back by Demichelis.\n18:9 Comment: Dani Alves.\n18:10 Comment: Ivan Rakitic.\n18:13 Comment: Andres Iniesta.\n18:16 Comment: Puzo.\n18:18 Comment: Jordi Alba.\n18:26 Comment: I wonder if they ever get bored of passing to each other.\n18:34 Comment: I'm sure they never get bored of watching it.\n18:38 Comment: Rakitic.\n18:40 Comment: Somehow found a way past Demichelis.\n18:42 Comment: Steps away from Fernandinho and then had a bit of a rush of blood.\n18:47 Comment: Fernandinho's a

but for his intervention City would surely have scored.\n20:15 Comment: Well he knew it as well.\n20:16 Comment: And that's why he flung himself.\n20:16 Comment: Last ditch, he knows he's just got to cover that near post area,\n20:20 Comment: and there he does, misses the ball, it's a goal.\n20:23 Comment: Really good defending from Pique.\n20:29 Comment: David Silva not picked up.\n20:31 Comment:

space here for Suarez.\n20:57 Comment: They do have to take some chances, they have to get something for the remainder of this game.\n21:2 Comment: Well, you do, because there's no difference between 2-0 and 3-0,\n21:6 Comment: because you feel that Barcelona at home are probably going to score.\n21:9 Comment: So they've got to take a chance, they need a goal tonight.\n21:16 Comment: Iniesta.\n21:31 Comment: Dani Alves into Luis Suarez, a turn-pass not up to standard.\n21:41 Comment: Fernandinho.\n21:46 Comment: Week in and a half time.\n22:6 Comment: Here comes Cechis.\n22:8

Comment: Hope for Manchester City.\n23:26 Comment: And inevitably it's provided by Sergio Agüero.\n23:31 Comment: Still a quarter of the first leg to go.\n23:34 Comment: And Manchester City have arrived in the tie.\n23:38 Comment: Barcelona had a little bit of luck with their first goal.\n23:41 Comment: The City just get the rub of the green here as the ball bounces down to Granada.\n23:45 Comment: It's a great little ball in there.\n23:47 Comment: Just here.\n23:48 Comment: Little backflip.\n23:49 Comment: And then the title doesn't come in.\n23:50 Comment: And Agüero pounces on it.\n23:52 Comment: What a finish that is.\n23:53 Comment: Just lifts it into the top corner of the net.\n24:0 Comment: His 98th Manchester City goal.\n24:2 Comment: He's his sixth in this competition this season.\n24:7 Comment: Just needs two in the last ten minutes to complete the hat trick like he did against Bayern Munich here in November.\n24:15 Comment: The City have got some concentrating to do first.\n24:18 Comment: Jordi Alba.\n24:20 Comment: Stopped by Pablo Zabaleta.\n24:25 Comment: And they did Silva a disservice there.\n24:27 Comment: I thought he was in a tackle.\n24:28 Comment: The ball bounced to Agüero.\n24:30 Comment: But it's a great little flick for him.\n24:32 Comment: Just played it in the path.\n24:34 Comment: Stuck his foot in.\n24:36 Comment: Just got it away from the defender, Pique, I think he was.\n24:38 Comment: And then the finish was sublime.\n24:43 Comment: Only one out.\n24:44 Comment: Come on, Agüero.\n24:45 Comment: Ring on three.\n24:49 Comment: Lionel Messi.\n24:50 Comment: It's a great ball.\n24:51 Comment: Suarez is offside.\n24:52 Comment: Flag is up.\n24:54 Comment: Yeah, he just went too early.\n25:6 Comment: This is the little touch from Silva.\n25:7 Comment: Just played in the outside of his left.\n25:9 Comment: And Agüero.\n25:10 Comment: So sharp in the box.\n25:12 Comment: Well, he hardly played any part in the tie last year.\n25:15 Comment: He came on in the second half or managed 45 minutes of the second leg, I should say, in the new cap.\n25:23 Comment: It was never fit.\n25:24 Comment: It's a foul by company on Suarez.\n25:26 Comment: Jeremy Mathieu, the French international, is a bit of a rare example of that.\n25:31 Comment: He's got a bit of a chance.\n25:43 Comment: He's a bit of a rarity for Barcelona.\n25:44 Comment: He's tall.\n25:45 Comment: They're bringing him on in place of Ivan Rakitic.\n25:54 Comment: He wasn't let back.\n25:55 Comment: He's a center back these days.\n25:56 Comment: Mathieu, it maybe means Mascherano moving into the midfield.\n26:5 Comment: Here is Mathieu.\n26:7 Comment: He's got a good shot.\n26:8 Comment: Yeah.\n26:9 Comment: Go, go, go!\n26:13 Comment: Aguero.\n26:14 Comment: Found by Savaletta.\n26:19 Comment: Tagged by Mascherano.\n26:24 Comment: Biscuit's taking a chance, he's been dispossessed,\n26:26 Comment: Boni!\n26:28 Comment: Fernandinho won the ball and Boni just never set himself with a shot.\n26:34 Comment: Well, it's a different team now, they're pressing really high up,\n26:38 Comment: they're just getting each other's way.\n26:40 Comment: Both trying to get the ball but the intensity in that last third\n26:43 Comment: has just gone up a notch.\n26:55 Comment: You have to give City credit based on the fact they didn't change the system\n26:59 Comment: and yet they changed the performance.\n27:1 Comment: Pellegrini stuck with the 4-4-2,\n27:3 Comment: but they're still in the lead.\n27:4 Comment: They've been so much better in the second half.\n27:16 Comment: Messi.\n27:18 Comment: Savaletta first two.\n27:30 Comment: You mentioned quite early in the night about keeping the crowd involved,\n27:34 Comment: keeping the volume pumped up, keeping the atmosphere special,\n27:39 Comment: and now it is again.\n27:41 Comment: Now there's a little bit of belief about the City faithful on and off the field.\n27:46 Comment: Messi halted.\n27:50 Comment: It's a little moral victory.\n27:54 Comment: Just look at the difference in the closing down.\n27:56 Comment: Yes, that's a foul.\n27:58 Comment: Pliessi has the yellow card and he's now going to get another.\n28:2 Comment: He's off.\n28:4 Comment: In both legs last year, Manchester City finished with ten men.\n28:9 Comment: Di Michele is here, Savaletta in the Nou Camp.\n28:12 Comment: And it's the same story here.\n28:14 Comment: They played 50 minutes against Barcelona with ten men a year ago.\n28:18 Comment: And they're going to have to play the last 17 here, a man like.\n28:24 Comment: He's just missed the ball.\n28:26 Comment: Intensity, the occasion.\n28:28 Comment: Everybody's getting tighter a lot quicker.\n28:32 Comment: Hens are going to rush into tackle.\n28:34 Comment: The referee's seen that as a yellow card.\n28:36 Comment: He's missed the ball.\n28:40 Comment: Such a shame, because it's just building up that pressure on Barcelona.\n28:47 Comment: So will that change Manchester City's approach?\n28:49 Comment: Do they take 2-1 if they can now?\n28:52 Comment: Or are they still pressed for an equaliser?\n28:55 Comment: I think you have to consolidate, because if you start pressing with ten men,\n29:0 Comment: this side will just pick you off.\n29:2 Comment: And what you don't want to do is lose three and four.\n29:4 Comment: So you have to do it like you're in the back of the net.\n29:6 Comment: Still in the tie at 2-1.\n29:9 Comment: Dani Alves has been replaced at right-back by his fellow Brazilian international Adriano.\n29:17 Comment: Dani Alves may be heading out of Barcelona,\n29:20 Comment: but in the final year of his contract,\n29:22 Comment: they haven't offered him a renewal as yet.\n29:28 Comment: He didn't seem too pleased about coming off.\n29:34 Comment: Busquets\n29:43 Comment: Messi\n29:45 Comment: Here is Adriano\n30:0 Comment: I'm sure James Milne will\n30:1 Comment: well he's playing left back against Messi now\n30:3 Comment: in his third position of the night\n30:7 Comment: I'd say Komarov is not on the bench\n30:15 Comment: Jordi Alba\n30:23 Comment: Suarez\n30:24 Comment: Jordi Alba\n30:25 Comment: oh what a tackle that is by Zabaleta\n30:28 Comment: Jordi Alba is convinced he should have a penalty\n30:30 Comment: Zabaleta seemed to get the ball\n30:32 Comment: he was coming in\n30:33 Comment: from behind\n30:34 Comment: he had to get it right\n30:36 Comment: he'd been beaten once\n30:38 Comment: and he just got back\n30:39 Comment: it's a great title\n30:40 Comment: David Silva\n30:45 Comment: couldn't keep his feet\n30:46 Comment: what a challenge by Zabaleta\n30:48 Comment: there are going to be some desperate hairy moments\n30:54 Comment: in these last 15 minutes\n30:55 Comment: you know that\n30:56 Comment: Macri Sania is about to come on\n31:3 Comment: he's got to think positive\n31:9 Comment: first half\n31:10 Comment: it felt as if Barcelona had three extra men\n31:13 Comment: so they've only got one extra man\n31:14 Comment: so it's a bonus\n31:16 Comment: they have revved up and produced a performance\n31:23 Comment: since the break Manchester City\n31:24 Comment: Neymar\n31:28 Comment: Adriano\n31:31 Comment: Neymar\n31:36 Comment: Alba arriving late in the day\n31:37 Comment: he's onside\n31:38 Comment:

Comment: goes to the far post\n31:49 Comment: Alba just picks out Messi\n31:52 Comment: and in the end\n31:53 Comment: Joe Hart just has to flick it over\n31:55 Comment: just wets his sleep a little bit\n31:58 Comment: Man City\n31:58 Comment: David Silva will have to be sacrificed\n32:2 Comment: so that\n32:2 Comment: Manchester City can keep their shape at the back\n32:5 Comment: and have\n32:8 Comment: two conventional full backs on the field\n32:15 Comment: and this one goes to number three\n32:17 Comment: the backer is Sanja\n32:21 Comment: this is a response to the red card for Garclushi\n32:24 Comment: he's been figured for the last three and a half weeks Sanja\n32:31 Comment: Sanja\n32:45 Comment: Neymar can't lift it beyond Milda\n32:46 Comment: company clear\n32:48

Comment: Kompany's on the way.\n33:43 Comment: Fernandinho.\n33:44 Comment: Towards his captain's head.\n33:46 Comment: Matteo just eased him under the ball.\n33:54 Comment: Busquets has lost it.\n33:55 Comment: Here's Kompany.\n33:56 Comment: Bonny just put an arm up and maybe pulled Busquets back.\n34:1 Comment: I think Busquets had already lost it.\n34:2 Comment: He's lost the ball.\n34:3 Comment: Yeah, I think you're right.\n34:5 Comment: The line's been flagged as well.\n34:6 Comment: He's lost the ball there and it just pushes him off balance.\n34:9 Comment: I'm sure there's too much in that.\n34:13 Comment: Dani Alves substituted a moment ago.\n34:17 Comment: It's not a decision that he totally agreed with, I don't think.\n34:24 Comment: It's a member of the Greater Manchester Constabulary.\n34:26 Comment: Constabulary just go away there.\n34:28 Comment: Neymar's off.\n34:30 Comment: Pedro's on.\n34:32 Comment: Pedro's off.\n34:36 Comment: Dani Alves is

in\n35:50 Comment: So what's going on here?\n35:51 Comment: It was a coming together between Busquets and Demichelis\n35:54 Comment: which Felix Brick wants to\n35:56 Comment: deal with\n36:26 Comment: Rechts sideways, the goal is to factory\n36:33 Comment: The Sting stand a 1-0 win for City and the Nou Airbnb\n36:37 Comment: time would not be enough because of the away goals rule.\n36:44 Comment: Quick kick here.\n36:46 Comment: As you can hear from the ironic cheers for Manchester City.\n36:58 Comment: Pellegrini on the sideline, just telling all his players to get forward.\n37:7

Comment: He's being penalised.\n37:52 Comment: It does give Barcelona that extra little dimension, though, the ball behind.\n37:56 Comment: He's always looking on the shoulder of the defender.\n37:58 Comment: Can he get the ball in the space behind?\n38:1 Comment: His midfield players know that.\n38:2 Comment: I don't think they've had that too much in the past.\n38:5 Comment: Kompany.\n38:10 Comment: Two critical first-half goals from Suarez tonight.\n38:15 Comment: Got a little bit of luck with the first, got a second bite as the ball fell to him\n38:19 Comment: and then set up by Jordi Alba, slid in from close range.\n38:25 Comment: Maybe a second bite isn't quite the right choice of words.\n38:29 Comment: Here's Messi.\n38:32 Comment: Iniesta.\n38:35 Comment: Pedro.\n38:41 Comment: Onside Jordi Alba.\n38:43 Comment: So too Pedro.\n38:45 Comment: This is Adriano.\n38:48 Comment: Blocked by Devecelis.\n38:50 Comment: Busquets.\n38:51 Comment: Easy for Hart.\n38:56 Comment: Behind

the game about\n41:9 Comment: not showing Barcelona too much respect and attacking them\n41:13 Comment: and getting stuck into them, it just felt like a little bit overawed\n41:17 Comment: by the occasion again in that first half.\n41:20 Comment: They didn't really do anything that resembled a game plan of that.\n41:25 Comment: The second half's been better, but then obviously down to ten men.\n41:30 Comment: It's a greater intensity, a greater intent about Manchester City\n41:32 Comment: since the break.\n41:33 Comment: And you can hear that in the crowd as well.\n41:47 Comment: Messi.\n41:49 Comment: Headed by Zabaleta, he's rather perilous.\n41:53 Comment: There's some company reacted, it is a corner, cheap corner.\n41:58 Comment: Great little run again by Messi, put that ball all down with his left foot.\n42:2 Comment: Probably easier, head it was back to Joe Hart.\n42:7 Comment: Barcelona corner, probably go back to the halfway line again.\n42:10 Comment: Certainly won't be rushing to take it, that's for sure.\n42:14 Comment: CHEERING AND APPLAUSE\n42:16 Comment: Go on, go on, go on!\n42:30 Comment: Give it to Messi.\n42:32 Comment: Go on, go on, go on!\n42:36

    "summary": "In a riveting encounter that brought the Etihad Stadium alive, Manchester City hosted Barcelona in a Champions League clash that would be remembered for its intensity and electrifying moments. The game saw the English side looking to break new ground and secure a spot in the last 16, something they narrowly missed achieving the previous year when Barcelona stood in their way. With hopes high and an air of anticipation enveloping the stadium, the match kicked off with Manchester City displaying intent and vigor, aiming to match their Spanish counterparts stride for stride.\n\nThe excitement began immediately after kickoff, with Manchester City showing a keen desire to dictate the pace. Their ambition was clear—after being thwarted at this same stage by the same opposition last year, they were determined to demonstrate their growth and capability. The big talking point ahead of the game was the selection dilemma facing Barcelona, specifically in goal. The young German keeper, Marc-André ter Stegen, was given the nod, a decision that raised many eyebrows considering the presence of the more experienced Claudio Bravo. This gave an added storyline to the match, as all eyes were on whether ter Stegen could deliver under the immense pressure of the Champions League knockout stage.\n\nAs the match settled into a rhythm, it became evident that Barcelona’s midfield, anchored by the ever-reliable Sergio Busquets and orchestrated by Andres Iniesta, would play a crucial role. Early exchanges were a tussle for control in the midfield, with City’s reliance on the creative flair of David Silva and the industrious James Milner. Despite not having the majority of possession, City threatened through the directness of Sergio Agüero and Edin Džeko up front, who looked lively and dangerous.\n\nThe breakthrough came after 16 minutes, setting the stage for what would be an enthralling first half. Following a fortunate bounce that favored Luis Suárez after a deflection off Vincent Kompany, the Uruguayan striker was quick to pounce, slotting the ball past Joe Hart to give Barcelona the lead. It was a sharp reminder of the relentless quality possessed by Barcelona’s front line, which also included Lionel Messi and Neymar. The goal seemed to inject even more urgency into their play, as they sought to capitalize on their early advantage. Suárez’s strike silenced the home crowd momentarily, as the collective air of expectation turned into a tense atmosphere of realization that their team had another mountain to climb.\n\nCity’s response was formidable though; they knew the significance of staying in contention ahead of the second leg at Camp Nou. Silva and Nasri linked up well to create openings, though the final product was often lacking, thwarted by Barcelona’s compact and disciplined defense led by Gerard Piqué. By the 30th minute, however, Suárez doubled the lead. A sweeping move saw Jordi Alba deliver a precise cross into the path of the striker, who made no mistake from close range. Suárez’s clinical finish was yet another testament to his acuity in front of goal, making it a daunting 2-0 deficit for Manchester City.\n\nAt this juncture, City found themselves needing to recalibrate their approach. The strategic battle saw Pellegrini urging his men to push forward and maintain high defensive lines, adapting a more aggressive posture to disrupt Barcelona’s midfield dominance. These efforts yielded few significant threats initially, as Barcelona’s tiki-taka philosophy came to the fore, efficiently retaining possession and methodically probing for further weaknesses in the City defense. Joe Hart had to be alert, making some crucial interventions to deny Messi and Neymar.\n\nThe Etihad faithful were given a glimmer of hope just before halftime. City managed to carve out a couple of decent chances through set-pieces but were unable to convert. The overarching feeling as the players trudged off for halftime was one of needing a dramatic improvement to avoid a repeat of last year’s disappointment.\n\nThe second half was ignited with a renewed sense of urgency from Manchester City. They pressed higher, forced Barcelona into errors, and, importantly, started to get a grip on possession in key areas of the pitch. A well-worked move almost brought immediate results, with Samir Nasri’s shot being blocked superbly by Mascherano. A subsequent Silva corner fell invitingly for Džeko, who could only direct his header straight at ter Stegen.\n\nCity’s tenacity was finally rewarded in the 69th minute. A combination of clever interplay and a touch of fortune saw the ball find Agüero, who lifted it precisely into the top corner, leaving ter Stegen with no chance. This goal, Agüero’s sixth in the competition for the season, injected renewed hope and fervor into the City ranks, as well as the home supporters.\n\nThe intensity of the match didn’t let up. Barcelona, sensing the shift in momentum, responded by applying pressure of their own, orchestrated masterfully by Messi, who was at the heart of most of their forward thrusts. Jordi Alba’s overlapping runs and Suarez’s unyielding movement kept City’s defense on their toes. A critical sliding tackle by Zabaleta on Alba inside the box epitomized City’s resolute defensive work in the face of Barcelona’s relentless attacks.\n\nAs the clock ticked down, the drama intensified. In the 85th minute, a contentious decision saw Gael Clichy receive a second yellow card for a challenge on Dani Alves, reducing City to ten men and significantly altering the tactical landscape of the match. This forced Pellegrini to sacrifice Silva for the defensive stability brought on by Bacary Sagna. The decision also necessitated a tactical reshuffle with Milner moving to left-back and Fernandinho dropping deeper to offer protection.\n\nThe closing stages of the game saw Barcelona assert their numerical advantage, but Manchester City's defense remained defiant. In a moment that could have sealed City's fate, Lionel Messi earned a penalty in the dying moments of added time. It was a chance for the Argentinian maestro to put the tie virtually out of sight with a third goal. But in a twist of fate, his effort was superbly saved by Joe Hart, and Messi's follow-up header went wide of the post. This miss allowed City to leave the field with their heads held high and a sense of what might have been salvaged from Joe Hart’s heroics.\n\nIn the end, the scoreboard read Manchester City 1 - 2 Barcelona, reflecting a hard-fought contest where City showed immense character, particularly in the second half. The tie was balanced precariously, with City needing a strong performance in the return leg to advance. Barcelona, buoyed by the advantage but wary of their opponent’s resilience, would prepare to defend their lead at Camp Nou.\n\nThis game was emblematic of high-stakes Champions League football—packed with tactical battles, moments of individual brilliance, and the sheer unpredictability that the sport often delivers. For Manchester City, it was a mixed bag, showing progression and the need for further refinement, while for Barcelona, it was another step towards asserting their dominance on the European stage."
