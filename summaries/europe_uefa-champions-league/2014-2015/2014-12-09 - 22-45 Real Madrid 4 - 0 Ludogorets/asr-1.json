Comment: but the president\n14:57 Comment: what was said\n15:1 Comment: the lot is possible\n15:3 Comment: and the c THIS\n15:6 Comment: had\n15:8 Comment:  the\n15:10 Comment: quarter hours\n15:13 Comment: from Direta\n15:19 Comment:  and\n15:20 Comment: The challenge of the week, the challenge of the week, the challenge of the week, the challenge of the week,\n15:27 Comment: the challenge of the week, the challenge of the week, the challenge of the week, the challenge of the week,\n15:49 Comment: The German, Iván Como, hung up motorcycles there for three or four months from Madrid,\n15:53 Comment: including Varane, who when he rises is a marvel,\n15:56 Comment: He's already meter ninety-one, meter ninety-two,\n15:58 Comment: On top of that he has a sensational jump, it's a great thing when Rafael Varane jumps.\n16:3 Comment: The ball goes to Dani Avalo, in front of him,\n16:6 Comment: When well concentrated, the help of Nacho who was recovering position and ball at the same time,\n16:11 Comment: with the same price.\n16:14 Comment: And that was the chance that Isco missed, great pass from Asier Illa-Ramén.\n16:20 Comment: Stoyano held up well.\n16:21 Comment: Stoyano turned out well, yes, he missed the first Champions League game,\n16:23 Comment: But he was stuck because they expelled him, well, so he could become a goalkeeper,\n16:26 Comment: They expelled him in the Esteagua game.\n16:29 Comment: But hey, that's an undisputed goalkeeper, in fact he had a pretty good game.\n16:33 Comment: In fact, against Real Madrid in Sofia, there, this was quite good.\n16:37 Comment: Yes, he made a bridge, yes, it was great.\n16:39 Comment: Isco, Isco, near the baseline, he shot to the center, he pressed him well there,\n16:43 Comment: Junior Caixara was the one who cleared, he recovered with a goal, he crossed with a goal.\n16:48 Comment: Jordan Minnef's clearance, Marcelinho turns well,\n16:51 Comment: He withstands the entrance of Toni Kroos and Marcelinho withstands it very well.\n16:54 Comment: Good end for Misi-Jan, danger in this against Ludo Gómez.\n16:58 Comment: Misi-Jan on the edge of the area, he has a shot from there, Keylor Navas clears.\n17:3 Comment: But again he has deployed himself well there, searching, especially searching the sides quite well, Misi-Jan\n17:7 Comment: and Alex Andrós appearing on the right in some plays.\n17:10 Comment: He has little possession of the ball, but when it arrived, it arrived well, twice, three times for Ludo Gómez.\n17:17 Comment: Let's go to that repetition of the last action, missing Isco.\n17:21 Comment: The play starts from a bad counter-attack, which the centre-backs reject very easily,\n17:26 Comment: It is one of the problems of this type of centers, at the moment we have two or three shelters and cons, all of them quite bad.\n17:32 Comment: There is a very good pass on the right for Cristiano Ronaldo, Ronaldo receives it, Ronaldo's cross,\n17:36 Comment: He hit Jordan Pineda and another corner for Real Madrid, they have already lost count, 5-6.\n17:41 Comment: Madrid is giving a feeling of permanent danger in the corners,\n17:44 Comment: He has three, practically all the ones he has had, I think there is danger, putting the cross there.\n17:48 Comment: The headers he has.\n17:51 Comment: I would be surprised if Madrid did it in a play like that, also because of how Ludo Gómez is defending.\n17:55 Comment: Barat with Nacho, with Cristiano Ronaldo, with Bale, with Chicharito and with setters like Toni Kroos,\n18:0 Comment: Although he was slow now, he jumped on Jordan Minez, so another corner kick.\n18:6 Comment: Now the white team, let's go to Carlos Ancelotti on the wing, handing out instructions, making gestures, the Italian.\n18:13 Comment: Yes, telling Álvaro Arbeloa and Coentran that they are the men who make them be very attentive in case of the contras.\n18:17 Comment: With Toni Kroos' effort, Gareth Bale's goal, disallowed.\n18:24 Comment: This was almost a miracle, it wasn't a goal, because it's red.\n18:29 Comment: We suppose there will be something like that, of course, the play was not very fast.\n18:32 Comment: Marcelinho red. Marcelinho red.\n18:36 Comment: Ludo Gómez is left with ten.\n18:40 Comment: All that remains of the game.\n18:42 Comment: It wasn't a goal, but it was almost better for Madrid, it was a penalty, on top of that the rival is left with ten.\n18:46 Comment: Well, better for Cristiano, he stops having the option of throwing it, because Gareth Bale was saying that he would have at least scored the goal,\n18:51 Comment: But hey, almost better for Madrid for the expulsion, because obviously, from now on,\n18:57 Comment: Ludo Gómez is going to play with one less man, there is Marcelinho asking the referee for explanations.\n19:1 Comment: It's a hostel.\n19:2 Comment: We'll see the play, but yes.\n19:3 Comment: He's a nice inn, a guy from Marcelinho.\n19:5 Comment: And cheer up, impressive, Rafael Varane's jump too, by the way.\n19:10 Comment: There is no doubt, and Ronaldo is looking for his 72nd goal in the Champions League.\n19:14 Comment: He is tied with Raúl González Blanco, and we have to get back on our feet.\n19:17 Comment: And Raúl can break the tie and put himself two behind Messi for the moment.\n19:24 Comment: Almost, almost a Zamorana.\n19:26 Comment: Marcelinho who is already leaving the field of play.\n19:28 Comment: The Bulgarian coach who shakes his hand, and there he is expelled.\n19:32 Comment: And the penalty that Cristiano Ronaldo is going to take.\n19:37 Comment: The goalkeeper Stoyanov.\n19:39 Comment: It's a good penalty.\n19:40 Comment: Well, he already stopped one on the way, we'll see today.\n19:42 Comment:  Cristiano Ronaldo...\n19:44 Comment:  Goal.\n19:47 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo's goal.\n19:50 Comment: Ronaldo 1-0 for Real Madrid.\n19:52 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo's 72nd goal in the Champions League.\n19:57 Comment: And let's see how the game is.\n19:59 Comment: Ricardo, how many goals has ICR7 finished with?\n20:2 Comment: Well, that's how it is, with one less Ludo Górez, who was already having problems defending.\n20:7 Comment: And Madrid was not shining too much.\n20:9 Comment: He opened the can again, today again with a penalty, as he did the weekend against Celta as well.\n20:13 Comment: A penalty, with greater controversy than the penalty.\n20:16 Comment: Penalty, this much clearer from Martelino for Ludo Górez.\n20:19 Comment: Madrid is ahead 1-0 and the Bulgarian team is almost one less behind Lopanenka.\n20:24 Comment: Martinez was going to tell you that the penalty would have been signed by Sergio Ramos.\n20:27 Comment: Yes, yes, almost to Lopanenka he told me.\n20:29 Comment: And what Ricardo said, what we were commenting on, is that Madrid doesn't...\n20:32 Comment: It's a pretty soft game, I wasn't...\n20:34 Comment: He is playing slowly, but there is a sense of danger, especially in the corners where he was serving a cross.\n20:39 Comment: And well, it was just like that.\n20:41 Comment: In other words, Varane jumped quite alone.\n20:43 Comment: Apart from the jump he has, he has jumped alone.\n20:45 Comment: And the game opens quickly and I think that with 10 in Ludo Górez, it will be enough to survive with dignity today.\n20:51 Comment: Yes, because if Real Madrid doesn't let up, Ludo Górez from Rasgrad could get a sack.\n21:1 Comment: Ball that Asier Iyarramendi is playing.\n21:4 Comment: Playing a very good game so far in these 21 minutes.\n21:7 Comment: Yes, I'm liking Iyarramendi, how it's showing, what's appearing.\n21:11 Comment: The two, three passes he made were also dangerous.\n21:15 Comment:  Come on!\n21:21 Comment: Nacho, look for Isco.\n21:24 Comment: Long send by Isco looking for Cristiano, who is not offside.\n21:27 Comment: Control Cristiano, Cristiano's center.\n21:29 Comment: Too strong for Chicharito to arrive.\n21:32 Comment: Isco's ball, magnificent too.\n21:34 Comment: That change of game of many meters and great precision from Iscoman.\n21:38 Comment: I haven't seen any change in the game from Toni Kroos, who is also a specialist in that.\n21:41 Comment: But they are footballers capable of, in a single touch, in a single pass,\n21:47 Comment: develop a defense, which is what happened on this play.\n21:54 Comment: Well, Ludo Górez is playing.\n21:57 Comment: Jordan Binez.\n22:0 Comment: Misic Jan.\n22:5 Comment: The expulsion of Marcelinho.\n22:6 Comment: There has been a change of positions between Dani Abalo and Misic Jan.\n22:9 Comment: Dani Abalo, who was up front, has now gone to the left wing.\n22:11 Comment: Misic Jan is the one who is now occupying Marcelinho's position.\n22:16 Comment: As a midfielder, Ludo Górez is not really left without a point now.\n22:22 Comment: Marcelinho was not playing in that position.\n22:24 Comment: Yes, Dani Abalo, who, as I say, has gone to the left.\n22:26 Comment: Yes, and Madrid have clearly switched to 4-4-2 right now.\n22:28 Comment: They have been playing in a very clear 4-4-2 for a few minutes now, with Cristiano and Chicharito at the two forwards.\n22:33 Comment: Isco on the left, Bale on the right in a line of four in midfield, very clear.\n22:37 Comment: Isco receives the pass from Toni Kroos.\n22:39 Comment: Isco on the inside, driving, has a pass to the left and gives it.\n22:44 Comment: Chicharito was the former Manchester United player, on loan at Real Madrid this season.\n22:50 Comment: Kroos tries his luck, Toni Kroos's shot hits Ronaldo's post.\n22:54 Comment: Out of blue, out of blue.\n22:56 Comment: He hit the wind, in any case he had shot the goalkeeper, come on Cristiano Ronaldo, Toni Kroos hit the post.\n23:2 Comment: Very serious error by Stoyanov in Toni Kroos' shot.\n23:7 Comment: We are going to see there the effectively illegal situation of Cristiano Ronaldo in clear offside.\n23:12 Comment: The goal probably wouldn't have been worth it, because logically, although he doesn't touch the ball, he is in the middle of the ball's trajectory with Stoyanov.\n23:21 Comment: The doubtful Goretz was saved from the second.\n23:25 Comment: Illaramendi, that plan.\n23:29 Comment: Dedicated Illaramendi, serving good minutes.\n23:33 Comment: Asier Illaramendi.\n23:37 Comment: What he has to do is take advantage of this opportunity due to the circumstances, due to Luka Modric's injury, James' injury.\n23:46 Comment: And well, the situation between injuries and the fact that he has not just renewed, that it seems that he is not going to continue, Sami Khedira's situation is very strange.\n23:56 Comment: Opening by Gareth Bale, for Fabio Coentrao.\n23:59 Comment: Coentrao, the play is tough Coentrao.\n24:3 Comment: Junior Caizara closed, throw-in for Carlo Ancelotti's team.\n24:7 Comment: The problem that Illaramendi had is that Diego, playing as a center midfielder, was really a bit of a possible substitute for Xavi Alonso, who obviously won't be around much longer.\n24:16 Comment: And in the end, where he is playing and where he can have minutes is no longer as a center midfielder, but accompanying the center midfielder, which is why it is very difficult for him to have minutes in more games in that position, because there are really players who are quite superior to him in that position.\n24:28 Comment: But it's very difficult.\n24:30 Comment: Cross for Illaramendi precisely.\n24:33 Comment: Even James himself is adapting to that position.\n24:37 Comment: Rafael Varane, with Isco.\n24:42 Comment: Isco drives, with his hair at his feet.\n24:45 Comment: He comes with Arbeloa, this opening to Illaramendi.\n24:48 Comment: The pass for Bale.\n24:51 Comment: Chicharito, who also wanted to send the ball to Cristiano, recovers well, pay attention to Illaramendi.\n24:55 Comment: Ronaldo who has the second, Ronaldo who turns for the shot, falls, in the end nothing happens.\n25:0 Comment: After Tabillo, Chicharito tries to arrive, Real Madrid recovers again with that delivery from Coentrao.\n25:5 Comment: Another good ball from Illaramendi.\n25:7 Comment: The best of the match for me.\n25:9 Comment: He's playing a good game.\n25:10 Comment: The corner kick, another one for Real Madrid.\n25:15 Comment: In a hurry, there we see Ludo Gómez's coach, Giorgi Dermentiev.\n25:21 Comment: No wonder, he is happy at the Bernabéu, although Madrid is not playing for anything, but only because of the potential it has.\n25:28 Comment: Isco playing.\n25:30 Comment: He can't find her, he didn't get along with Coentrao, he gets Misyan back.\n25:35 Comment: A lot of effort ahead, Misyan also got too far ahead of the ball and was attentive to Sierra.\n25:38 Comment: Illaramendi.\n25:41 Comment: Keylor Navas for Rafael Varane.\n25:44 Comment: The ball falls, Varane for Toni Kroos.\n25:49 Comment: 4-4-1 in defensive phase.\n25:51 Comment: Ludo Gómez now leaving Misyan up.\n25:54 Comment: Watch out for that ball in front, Chicharito wanted to turn, but he read the card well in this case.\n25:59 Comment: Junior Caizara, Misyan clears the ball, he holds the ball.\n26:3 Comment: Illaramendi is also there covering holes.\n26:5 Comment: Avoid the out-of-band Illaramendi.\n26:9 Comment: No, he says no, the assistant says no.\n26:12 Comment: And the throw-in therefore yes for Ludo Gómez.\n26:15 Comment: Ronaldo's chance, and Terziyev jumped on him.\n26:18 Comment: I wasn't going to touch him, I wasn't going to give him a penalty.\n26:21 Comment: And neither does the Portuguese claim.\n26:26 Comment: Throw-in for Cosmin Motti.\n26:31 Comment: With Fabio Espiño.\n26:32 Comment: Dyakov in this case is the one who left Terziyev.\n26:37 Comment: And then the captain, Diakov.\n26:41 Comment: Terziyev.\n26:43 Comment: Mikhail Aleksandrov.\n26:46 Comment: Then Misyan arrives.\n26:50 Comment: Misyan, before Nkae, before Varane.\n26:54 Comment:  There is nothing.\n26:56 Comment: Misyan timidly claims.\n26:58 Comment: He hasn't heard anything from the referee, also French, like Misyan and Varane.\n27:3 Comment: Mikhail Aleksandrov.\n27:7 Comment: Ball back for Terziyev.\n27:15 Comment: Ludo Gómez takes it easy.\n27:17 Comment: What he doesn't want is to lose a ball that Carrion hires, how deadly, from Real Madrid.\n27:21 Comment: And receive the second.\n27:24 Comment: It's Fabio Espiño.\n27:25 Comment: It slows down Portuguese.\n27:27 Comment: Hawthorn for Stoyanov.\n27:31 Comment: Jump Nacho.\n27:33 Comment: The youth player clears, directing the ball to another youth player.\n27:36 Comment: Alvaro Arbeloa.\n27:38 Comment: Guillerme Mendy.\n27:40 Comment: Real Sociedad youth player Pedro, looking for Gareth Bale.\n27:42 Comment: He left Bale.\n27:44 Comment: On the front, I was looking for Cristiano, Chicharito tries to get there, he can't.\n27:48 Comment: Ludo Gómez's player, Cosmin Motti, is better placed.\n27:51 Comment:  Espino.\n27:52 Comment: It's very difficult for Messi to leave Ludo Gómez.\n27:55 Comment: It's going to be a permanent step back, or a long ball, it's practically impossible for me to get out of there.\n28:0 Comment: And Madrid is not very aggressive in its pressure either.\n28:3 Comment: It's high, but no, it's a really soft game in every sense.\n28:8 Comment: Clear goalkeeper Stoyanov.\n28:11 Comment: Head back, Mishit Jan.\n28:13 Comment: He's going to get Sierra and Ramendi back, in this case with luck, but there he was, well placed.\n28:16 Comment: And the previous pass to Gareth Bale.\n28:18 Comment: He had a very, very, very clear pass to the left for CR7.\n28:22 Comment: He was running and fell for the shot, but he hit it quite badly, very in the middle at Gareth Bale.\n28:26 Comment: But another ball from Illa-Ramendi.\n28:28 Comment:  Yeah.\n28:30 Comment: Another ball recovered and another ball well played by Illa-Ramendi.\n28:33 Comment: That long cross pass from Dani Abalo was well played.\n28:37 Comment: Spurs opening, which cannot be done.\n28:39 Comment: And the ball, that can't be done.\n28:42 Comment: Another long cross pass from Dani Abalo.\n28:45 Comment: Spurs Opening.\n28:49 Comment: Center Mikhail Aleksandrov.\n28:53 Comment: Well, for now, Aleksandrov.\n28:55 Comment: To Sengar, because until the other Aleksandrov, who is a central defender, plays today.\n28:59 Comment: Aleksandrov.\n29:2 Comment: Playing Aleksandrov, who has played in both midfield positions, almost as a winger, today he is on the right, which is the most natural for him.\n29:8 Comment: Yes, but he has played, as I said before, on both wings.\n29:9 Comment: Misid Jan has also played on both wings.\n29:12 Comment: In both the Bulgarian League matches and the previous five Champions League matches.\n29:19 Comment:  Both.\n29:21 Comment: The previous one, but this water, Bucharest.\n29:23 Comment: That is the fall of Misid Jan, from Varane, a few minutes ago.\n29:31 Comment: Well, I think it's missing.\n29:33 Comment: And I don't know if it's...\n29:35 Comment: If it was Gareth Bale's shot.\n29:36 Comment: I don't know if outside or inside, but I think there is... It's Rafael Varane's lack.\n29:42 Comment: I don't know if it was on the same line, therefore it would be a penalty.\n29:45 Comment: Or it would have been a penalty, which Turpen didn't whistle.\n29:50 Comment: Visco.\n29:53 Comment: Visco for Kroos.\n29:57 Comment: I imagine, Ricardo Sierra, I don't know if you have knowledge there, you have heard something,\n30:1 Comment: In the second half, victory is on track for Madrid while resting.\n30:6 Comment: Tony Kroos, for the load of minutes he takes and for how important he is.\n30:9 Comment: In theory, let's see, because Tony Kroos is playing practically every game.\n30:15 Comment: Even the player himself has already said that he has that accumulation of games.\n30:18 Comment: There is Álvaro Medrán, who already played the Cup match, he played practically the entire match,\n30:23 Comment: The Real Madrid youth player, and let's see if he decides to give him a rest.\n30:26 Comment: Everything indicates that yes, he can be given a rest in the second half.\n30:30 Comment: If someone is sure to play minutes and have minutes in the second 45 minutes of the game, it will be Gesen.\n30:36 Comment: It is very interesting to see her, more of a pure center midfielder, and Medrán, who is a player who also deploys well up top,\n30:41 Comment: And he is a fairly offensive player, playing forward.\n30:45 Comment: It is an option and Gesen, of course, I am convinced that we are going to see it.\n30:48 Comment: As we saw him against Cornellar, he appeared and scored a goal.\n30:53 Comment: Let's go to Misyt Jan.\n30:59 Comment: Daniel Álvaro in the fall.\n31:1 Comment: Daniel Álvaro in the fall, yes.\n31:3 Comment: Daniel Álvaro in the fall, it could have been done for many years.\n31:6 Comment: At first it seems like he's putting his hand on his shoulder, I don't know if it's on his shoulder or his chest,\n31:9 Comment: But in the fall a lot of damage was done to the player.\n31:11 Comment: I was in the race running, I think it was Arbeloa who was going to close, or even Rafael Varane.\n31:15 Comment: He collided with him in the fall. Well, there are Daniel Álvaro's gestures of pain.\n31:18 Comment: It's with Arbeloa.\n31:20 Comment: Yes, it collides with Arbeloa.\n31:23 Comment: And right practically on the divide.\n31:24 Comment: On the divide.\n31:28 Comment: Next, he twitches, it's on the grass, Dani Ávalo, who is already recovering.\n31:35 Comment: With Gareth Bale passing by him and he's fine, he makes the ok gesture.\n31:39 Comment: Fortunately the Galician recovers.\n31:41 Comment: With his ribs, he stuck to the ground.\n31:43 Comment: He was making the gesture, indicating Gareth Bale, also Arbeloa, who apologizes for the distance.\n31:47 Comment: Ricardo, who was speaking before Cristiano with Coentrao, is fixed.\n31:49 Comment: I think Coentrao is still telling him that he has to go further.\n31:53 Comment: It's a fairly comfortable match for Madrid, they have practically not appeared near the area.\n31:56 Comment: Well, probably because the full-backs today, neither Coentrao nor Arbeloa, are not supporting the attack in any of the plays.\n32:3 Comment: The four wingers that Madrid has, although Nacho can play there too, are like the defense.\n32:8 Comment: But of the four full-backs, the two least offensive.\n32:11 Comment: Arbeloa and Coentrao.\n32:13 Comment: Yes, because it's curious the other day due to circumstances, due to James' injury, Real Madrid ended up playing with Coentrao, with Marcelo, with Carvalho.\n32:19 Comment: And with Arbeloa.\n32:21 Comment: But it is true that Coentrao and Arbeloa were full-backs and Marcelo and Carvalho were playing inside.\n32:25 Comment: Those solutions that Carlito Ancelotti has to improvise.\n32:30 Comment: The injuries. Ball for Misi-Jan.\n32:33 Comment: In front of Dani Abalo, remember well there, Misi-Jan, once and twice.\n32:37 Comment: Good action, good maneuver by Misi-Jan.\n32:39 Comment: They have two or three good plays, Misi-Jan.\n32:41 Comment: Abalo too, now I think he will appear a little less, probably too.\n32:45 Comment: That is the clash, yes, between Arbeloa and Dani Abalo.\n32:49 Comment: It's been a couple of minutes now. Now Rafael Varane anticipates Misi-Jan.\n33:0 Comment: The gesture there, Carlo Ancelotti's plan.\n33:8 Comment: What does he have left in his contract this season and another until 2016.\n33:12 Comment: It seems that its renewal for one or two more years is close.\n33:18 Comment: In principle it seems that it would be for one more. It would therefore extend until 2017.\n33:24 Comment: Carlo Ancelotti. This is his second season at Real Madrid.\n33:28 Comment: In the first, as is known, he won two titles.\n33:31 Comment: The tenth, the European Cup and the Cup.\n33:37 Comment: With an intercepted cut, that pass by Illa-Ramendi.\n33:41 Comment: Disco for the Cuban team.\n33:44 Comment: Real Madrid throw-in.\n33:46 Comment: Almost 34 of the first half at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.\n33:49 Comment: 1-0. The leader, super leader of this group B, wins.\n33:52 Comment: Looking for and so far achieving their sixth victory in six games.\n33:57 Comment: Looking for and at the moment achieving his nineteenth consecutive victory\n34:2 Comment: beating Fran Rijkaard's Barcelona.\n34:5 Comment: Chicharito looking to uncheck.\n34:7 Comment: Chicharito couldn't receive that pass from Ronaldo.\n34:10 Comment: He has been greatly blamed because the shipment was not necessary.\n34:12 Comment: But good unchecking of Chicharito. That is also one of his main qualities.\n34:16 Comment: The mobility, the unmarking, that makes it really good.\n34:19 Comment: The headbutt, of course.\n34:21 Comment: Let's see what ground Jordan Minefe has ahead of him.\n34:24 Comment: The left side turns to center with the right.\n34:27 Comment: Clear Rafael Varane.\n34:29 Comment: It's his leg. Minefe is right-footed although he usually plays more on the left side.\n34:31 Comment: In the national team he also sometimes plays it on the right.\n34:33 Comment: And in Ludo Górez at right back.\n34:35 Comment: But he's pretty settled on the left.\n34:37 Comment: In fact with the former coach already, Luvo Pérez.\n34:38 Comment: When we were in Bulgaria, in the former coach's era,\n34:41 Comment: And now he's gone, he was indisputable on the left wing.\n34:44 Comment:  Same here.\n34:46 Comment: Zirilla, Ramendi, Toni Kroos.\n34:50 Comment: Chicharito receives from his back.\n34:52 Comment: I thought he was going to turn to give the pass to Ronaldo,\n34:54 Comment: But the teachers at Ludo Górez did not allow it.\n34:56 Comment: In this case, the same uncle was Ronaldo.\n34:58 Comment: Ronaldo looking for 2-0.\n35:0 Comment: He wants to give it to Arbeloa, who was offside.\n35:2 Comment: Also Arbeloa was offside the entire play.\n35:4 Comment: That's why it took a while for Cristiano to give the pass, but he couldn't form anymore.\n35:6 Comment: Arbeloa.\n35:36 Comment: Caizara's second goal, impossible for Mijail Aleksandrov.\n35:40 Comment: It has been played before, the very clear offside of Álvaro Arbeloa.\n35:47 Comment: Rafael Varane, Toni Kroos.\n35:54 Comment: Visco.\n35:56 Comment: They tell me, by the way, that Toni Kroos is already absolutely convinced and happy,\n36:0 Comment: and he wants to continue playing in that position for the rest of his career.\n36:3 Comment: That he loves playing there and that he doesn't even consider playing in the future.\n36:7 Comment: It's a quick reconversion, because of course it's always been about playing higher up.\n36:11 Comment: Although it is true that at Bayern Munich we already read some games in which this position came.\n36:16 Comment: And in the German team, I remember years ago, even two or three years ago,\n36:22 Comment: Some games he played as a center midfielder and I wasn't convinced in that position three or four years ago,\n36:26 Comment: But it has evolved a lot.\n36:28 Comment: And he is playing a leading role in almost every game.\n36:30 Comment:  Yes, definitely.\n36:31 Comment: That's what he says, that he takes much greater contact with the ball, that he is the protagonist.\n36:34 Comment: Let's see, who wants to be the protagonist of the second one.\n36:37 Comment: Another good ball from Illa-Ramendi.\n36:39 Comment: I really think it's the best of the first half.\n36:42 Comment: For me without any doubt. I don't know how you see it, Ricardo, if you also agree with that line.\n36:45 Comment: Well, it seems to me that he is the most connected of all.\n36:47 Comment: It seems to me that perhaps he is the one who has to prove the most, he is faster, he is more alive and then he is more accurate.\n36:52 Comment: Illa-Ramendi was often missed, but with those passes we are seeing,\n36:56 Comment: Those deep filtered passes, the one he put in today is certainly very successful.\n36:59 Comment: Taking advantage of these minutes, this first part that has eight minutes left, the Toni Kroos video.\n37:7 Comment: To the crossbar and goal.\n37:9 Comment: Real Madrid's second, Gareth Bale.\n37:13 Comment: Goal pass, that glove on his right foot, Toni Kroos. 2-0 Bale.\n37:19 Comment: Every run in Madrid is the majority of Ludo Górez's nightmares, Ricardo. It's tremendous.\n37:23 Comment: Yes, and again to Gareth Bale who managed to finish.\n37:27 Comment: The truth is that the goal judge was very attentive, the ball clearly went in, it bounced into the goal.\n37:32 Comment: He was the one who told the referee that the ball was going in, but he is creating a lot of danger.\n37:35 Comment: In addition to the fact that the number of corner kicks is affecting Real Madrid a lot.\n37:38 Comment: There's the second, both of the night, the work of Gareth Bale.\n37:41 Comment: There is no doubt, the ball clearly bounced in and Gareth Bale clearly won over.\n37:47 Comment: Well, doing well what we said.\n37:48 Comment: He knows everyone who has seen him at Madrid, especially at Tottenham, who is a great header.\n37:51 Comment: It's a very powerful jump, he's an athlete.\n37:54 Comment: Of course it is, it is.\n37:56 Comment: That of Cristiano who is also.\n37:58 Comment: You pressed the displayed time, but...\n38:0 Comment: The great header Bale is what you say, he is an athlete, he is a player who is physically super gifted.\n38:4 Comment: And in this type of games it also shows it.\n38:7 Comment: And then of course, as Toni Kroos has stated.\n38:9 Comment: He gave accounts like this in the World Cup to his colleagues in the Mannschaft.\n38:13 Comment: Now, having said that, the truth is that he defends the runners quite poorly in Ludo Górez.\n38:16 Comment: Because as much as the runners in Madrid are very good, they are all finishing him off, one after another.\n38:20 Comment: And then it's good Estolano, who takes the ball from the rebound and looks at the assistant and says, no, no, it didn't go in.\n38:25 Comment: He sneaked in.\n38:27 Comment: It didn't work.\n38:29 Comment: It wasn't necessary, Hawkeye.\n38:31 Comment: Well, 2-0 is on track.\n38:33 Comment: The triumph of Real Madrid looking for the nineteenth in a row.\n38:36 Comment: Well, this is it...\n38:38 Comment: I think it's more in good solos, I consider Madrid a little more.\n38:41 Comment: Because coaches like to have a margin of safety, one more franjezurea.\n38:44 Comment: Let's see that Corner shot, Keiro Navas.\n38:47 Comment: Very good shot by Fabio Espiño.\n38:50 Comment: The Portuguese who was close to closing the gap.\n38:53 Comment: I say that this would be good to give even more minutes than planned to Geseo, to Álvaro Medrán, for example.\n38:59 Comment: Corner kick for Ludo Górez.\n39:2 Comment:  It is the first one.\n39:4 Comment: The Ras Grat team.\n39:7 Comment: The Sierr Moti.\n39:10 Comment: And Sinja.\n39:11 Comment: They are the best ones on this team.\n39:13 Comment: The 11 he has on the grass today.\n39:16 Comment: The 3rd incorporated Alexandrov.\n39:18 Comment: The ball that remains in the front is very short.\n39:20 Comment: Dani Avalo, Avalo, Avalo.\n39:22 Comment:  Dani Avalo cut the ball off and shot very high, very wide.\n39:27 Comment: It's very good for Real Madrid.\n39:29 Comment: Espino hits him well, yes.\n39:35 Comment: I know the penguins from Madagascar.\n39:37 Comment: The movie, right?\n39:39 Comment:  Yes of course.\n39:41 Comment: Well, if you go back to the second part, Anicet Abel.\n39:44 Comment: Sit down, Ricardo, if you're not sitting down.\n39:47 Comment: Andriana Antenaina.\n39:49 Comment: What is your last name?\n39:52 Comment: That last name is a danger for a narrator.\n39:55 Comment: The center that didn't reach Chicharito.\n39:59 Comment: It's not in the call.\n40:3 Comment:  Yes Yes.\n40:5 Comment: Because it doesn't fit, they put the whole name Anicet Abel.\n40:8 Comment: It's the 12th, the 12th.\n40:9 Comment: Anicet Abel, the last name doesn't fit.\n40:12 Comment: Andriana Antenaina.\n40:14 Comment: It's much easier that way.\n40:17 Comment: It's Santiguaba, Kelo Navas.\n40:19 Comment: Very religious, believing, Kelo Navas, after having deflected Corne's shot.\n40:23 Comment: By Fabio Espiño.\n40:33 Comment: Last minutes of the first part.\n40:35 Comment: We are at 41 with this 2-0 for Real Madrid.\n40:38 Comment: Gareth Bale, Toni Kroos.\n40:40 Comment: Them for Isco.\n40:43 Comment: Inside Isco, that was the pass for Gareth Bale.\n40:46 Comment: The little dolphin Chicharito.\n40:50 Comment: A little selfish from Bale.\n40:52 Comment: And it's the second time.\n40:54 Comment: Before there was one in which I had a clear pass to Cristiano.\n40:57 Comment: He apologizes for Gareth Bale's gesture now towards Chicharito.\n40:59 Comment: Carlos Ancelotti, the boss in the center.\n41:2 Comment: On the right the Englishman Paul Clement.\n41:5 Comment: Be careful that it was Ancelotti's at Chelsea and PSG.\n41:8 Comment: At Real Madrid for Isco.\n41:12 Comment: It's fantastic for Gareth Bale.\n41:14 Comment: He has the support of Cristiano.\n41:16 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo on the front.\n41:18 Comment: He has it in shot from there in Cerraban.\n41:20 Comment: Toni Kroos supports himself.\n41:22 Comment: There is a very clear pass to the left, but...\n41:24 Comment:  Nothing can be done.\n41:25 Comment: That's what Toni Kroos did wrong.\n41:27 Comment: It came from the left quite unmarked.\n41:29 Comment: Coentrao.\n41:31 Comment: The German made the best option there.\n41:34 Comment: Isco preparing for Toni Kroos.\n41:36 Comment: He has a shot from there.\n41:38 Comment: Come in too.\n41:40 Comment: This could be good for Ronaldo.\n41:42 Comment: Ronaldo.\n41:44 Comment: He jumped on Junior Caixara.\n41:46 Comment: To quickly recover there Coentrao.\n41:48 Comment: Press the Portuguese.\n41:50 Comment: Try to hold on.\n41:52 Comment: Ludo Goretz does it.\n41:53 Comment: Ahead is Mikhail Aleksandrov\n41:55 Comment: trying to receive the pass.\n41:57 Comment:  We will see.\n41:59 Comment: Driving.\n42:1 Comment: Fabius Piño is listing here.\n42:3 Comment: Help is coming to Misin Jan.\n42:5 Comment: Fabius Piño.\n42:9 Comment: Leave Fabius Piño behind for Captain Diakov.\n42:15 Comment: Okay, Isco.\n42:17 Comment: Well plugged in.\n42:19 Comment: I always say it's something I really\n42:21 Comment: That defensive capacity is what the team is doing.\n42:23 Comment: And what I used to be was an even more complete player.\n42:25 Comment: He told me a few weeks ago or not,\n42:27 Comment: Ancelotti,\n42:29 Comment: What if he got to play Clarence Seedorf?\n42:31 Comment: a great worker\n42:33 Comment: and that he sacrificed himself,\n42:35 Comment: Well, I was going to have it easier with Isco.\n42:38 Comment: The first albero in Real Madrid.\n42:40 Comment: Take out

Comment: They noticed that detail for me.\n43:5 Comment: Ludo Goretz moving the ball.\n43:8 Comment: Last minute and a half plus discount\n43:10 Comment: in this first part.\n43:12 Comment: Sixth

Tiakov.\n43:27 Comment:  Espino.\n43:29 Comment: The ball went wide to Fabio Espiño.\n43:34 Comment: The minute Goretz plays with one less since the play of the first goal.\n43:37 Comment: Marcelinho's penalty, carrying the red card.\n43:40 Comment: That was in the 20th minute. In the 38th minute Bale scored the second.\n43:44 Comment: And that's where we are.\n43:46 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo, rebound that favors Isco. Dragging the ball, baseline, Isco's center.\n43:51 Comment: He couldn't reach Arbeloa. The ball went over him, but Bale recovered it.\n43:58 Comment:  Gareth Bale.\n44:0 Comment: The ball chair for Sier Illarramente and Vasco controls.\n44:3 Comment: It was now in a balloon.\n44:5 Comment: Good cut from Bale.

He goes up.\n44:38 Comment: Headbutt to Rafael Varane.\n44:39 Comment: That's Gareth Bale's previous move.\n44:45 Comment: Well, the Madrid match is obvious.\n44:47 Comment: The game is very slow, it really shows that there is no practice in the game,\n44:49 Comment: There is no tension.\n44:50 Comment: And still 2-0 and it could have been worse for Ludo Hores.\n44:53 Comment: The best Illarramente.

opening\n29:54 Comment: Coming into action again, he asks for the ball in front\n29:57 Comment: Isco finally gets to him, he doesn't control clearly, Isco doesn't control first, Ludo Górez repositions himself in defense\n30:3 Comment: and Jarramendi with CR7, CR72 in Champions.\n30:9 Comment: Ronaldo's opening, Gesé goes to double Arbeloa, the pass for Arbeloa, Arbeloa crosses back, Yakov's interception.\n30:19 Comment: Ludo Górez cutting off the exit.\n30:21 Comment: He is waiting to receive on the right wing and Dani Abalo receives a pass from Junior Caizara.\n30:31 Comment: Van Der Zon appears, very heeled, the ball that does not come out, Rafael Varana attacks him.\n30:37 Comment: She left the action, she was left with no room for maneuver, Junior kick's a da.\n30:44 Comment: Navas has fallen a bit.\n30:51 Comment: Madrid we see the 5 measure, a Queremovelo-Marcelo production without problems, a Gareth Bale marquete.\n30:58 Comment: It's heeling, lifting the ball, he has the support behind Gesé, trying to overwhelm there, Bale does it, the play went well, the center not so much.\n31:7 Comment: It was difficult, he fell to the right for the center, it is true that he is not correct but he still tries, he always offers himself.\n31:14 Comment: There is Cristiano with that gesture, he is a little desperate.\n31:19 Comment: I think Cristiano is being aware that he is losing an opportunity to follow his command, really.\n31:25 Comment: Because of course, the game, the rivals are very inferior with Hormel, I don't think they are doing much either, because they are not the teammates, or Bale in this case.\n31:36 Comment: Ronaldo shot, just as the ball came to him, Chicharito recovers, Chicharito crosses back looking for Bale, the pass does not arrive, Ronaldo misses the ball on the side.\n31:50 Comment: Gesé and Ronaldo, pointing to the ball that was going over the side.\n32:5 Comment: La Junior Caixara, leaves behind Nordea Nantenaina, Aniceta Bel.\n32:16 Comment: Anderson, finishes with Dani Abalo, Rob Anderson, behind for Aniceta Bel, the shot of the Madagascar player that goes wide to the right of the current, Ilon Abas.\n32:28 Comment: He was playing his position in the center midfield, he is a player who sometimes deploys a little more in attack, today it is logically impossible to do so, but hey, he is more or less in his place.\n32:37 Comment: At the same time it is Atires Villar, Gareth Bale, three among the three goals including the second goal.\n32:42 Comment: Eight shots from Gareth Bale.\n32:45 Comment: Some of them could have become, with a better option, a ride, a companion, one of the eight.\n32:52 Comment: A couple of them in the first part.\n32:56 Comment: Villarramenti, Bale.\n33:1 Comment: Gareth Bale to Marcelo, back for the Welshman.\n33:9 Comment: Isco, back to Rafael Varane.\n33:13 Comment: Nacho, Nacho look for Isco.\n33:21 Comment: Ronaldo distributes for Marcelo.\n33:25 Comment: Marcelo not with that height, that ends in one more corner of the many that Real Madrid is having today.\n33:31 Comment: It's a better tercif.\n33:33 Comment: That's Ronaldo's gesture after Gareth Bale's shot that wasn't crossed minutes ago.\n33:40 Comment: That must be it, corner kick.\n33:43 Comment: Arbeloa, twice the cutter.\n33:46 Comment: Did you work ball?\n33:47 Comment: Yes, he gave it.\n33:48 Comment: Goal from Arbeloa, goal from Real Madrid to Arbeloa who smiles with his face.\n33:53 Comment: Arbeloa, Arbeloa, Arbeloa.\n33:57 Comment: Goal from Arbeloa, goal from Real Madrid to Arbeloa who smiles.\n34:3 Comment: He is not very used to scoring goals against Arbeloa and it was difficult for him because he had both.\n34:8 Comment: I don't know if he gave the second or the first.\n34:10 Comment: I think he comes in first.\n34:11 Comment: The first one from here seemed to me to be safe.\n34:13 Comment: Let's watch the replay.\n34:15 Comment: Arbeloa, Arbeloa.\n34:16 Comment: He deserved it, he was reaching the cup quite a bit.\n34:18 Comment: I was causing trouble.\n34:20 Comment: Arbeloa's correct position.\n34:21 Comment: This is where it comes in.\n34:23 Comment: Arbeloa's goal.\n34:29 Comment: Yes, it seems so, totally.\n34:30 Comment:  It looks like it is.\n34:31 Comment: It goes in completely, that's how the Linier saw it.\n34:33 Comment: The Linier, the goal referee.\n34:35 Comment: The referee 3-0.\n34:36 Comment: The second hits between the hand and the club.\n34:39 Comment: Arbeloa, Real Madrid's third.\n34:44 Comment: Arbeloa's goal, the applause of the public.\n34:46 Comment: The second part of Arbeloa has gone up much more, Ricardo.\n34:49 Comment: I enjoy those climbs, this goal.\n34:51 Comment: He was rewarded for that goal.\n34:53 Comment: The third goal scored in the Champions League by the Real Madrid winger.\n34:57 Comment: After a corner kick, creating a lot of danger.\n35:0 Comment: But I think that Arbeloa's own celebration has even been cold.\n35:4 Comment: Because it seemed like it didn't fit in that first instance.\n35:8 Comment: It took a while for the referee to realize that he also gave the goal to the fans.\n35:12 Comment: It was cold, but the goal raised the score.\n35:14 Comment: Third, as we say, for Arbeloa in the Champions League.\n35:17 Comment: And the third for Real Madrid tonight.\n35:19 Comment: The three goals in three corners.\n35:21 Comment: The first, which is the penalty, which is in a corner.\n35:23 Comment: The second, directly from the corner.\n35:25 Comment:  And this one too.\n35:27 Comment: What happened with Ludovorec today was...\n35:29 Comment: On top of that, they are capable of...\n35:31 Comment: Arbeloa is not offside.\n35:33 Comment: What a nuisance the vision, Chicharito, to the goalkeeper.\n35:37 Comment: It's on Ludovorec's side.\n35:39 Comment: When Gareth Bale starts, he wants to be the Cardiff bomb.\n35:41 Comment: The shot, Gareth Bale's shot.\n35:43 Comment: And another corner.\n35:45 Comment: Bale, who is left there, lying on the ground.\n35:47 Comment: He's bleeding. He got hurt.\n35:49 Comment: He's bleeding from his nose, it looks like Gareth Bale.\n35:53 Comment: A slap there, the Ludovorec player.\n35:55 Comment: Ter Sief.\n35:57 Comment: Ter Sief, yes, when falling.\n35:59 Comment: Just the move, there is no bad intention.\n36:1 Comment: I think he got hit on the nose.\n36:3 Comment: Yes, it's bleeding.\n36:5 Comment: With his shoulder, it seems like he hits him with his shoulder.\n36:7 Comment: And the fall, and there's Gareth Bale bleeding.\n36:9 Comment: Yes, but it's going to turn out well, too.\n36:11 Comment: As seen on replay.\n36:13 Comment: When you fall with your right arm you hit it.\n36:19 Comment: Well, the Welshman is being served.\n36:23 Comment: Interruption, therefore, at the Bernabéu.\n36:25 Comment: The central player born in Cardiff.\n36:29 Comment: Álvaro Medrán is now ready to enter the field.\n36:31 Comment: Let's see if that was Ancelotti's idea, to remove Gareth Bale.\n36:33 Comment: Or change your mind.\n36:35 Comment: Because until they close the lock,\n36:37 Comment: He will not be able to enter the field of play.\n36:39 Comment: If his head has been dirty, probably,\n36:41 Comment: Let's see if the substituted player is Gareth Bale.\n36:43 Comment: But Álvaro Medrán is ready to enter.\n36:49 Comment: When morsing, it seems like too much.\n36:51 Comment: When falling, it seems like a lot when falling.\n36:53 Comment: We will try to keep the play for the goal.\n36:55 Comment: Looking at it, it's okay, it's limited.\n36:57 Comment: The signing is ahead, but I don't think so...\n37:1 Comment: It's not usually that much, really.\n37:3 Comment: About football, the truth is that you have a little left...\n37:5 Comment: I think it has arrived.\n37:9 Comment: You don't have to worry about the signing,\n37:11 Comment: which is set before him.\n37:15 Comment: Well, Bale has retired, Álvaro Medrán has remained.\n37:17 Comment: I don't know if he planned to remove Bale.\n37:19 Comment: I think maybe he planned to remove...\n37:21 Comment: Maybe Isco and put Medrán next to Jaramillo,\n37:23 Comment:  oh well.\n37:25 Comment: Well, a few minutes, not many.\n37:27 Comment: The discount is much greater, Álvaro Medrán will have about 11-12.\n37:29 Comment: The Córdoban...\n37:33 Comment: There Gareth Bale retires.\n37:37 Comment: Isco's corner kick.\n37:39 Comment: Now that one is well defended by Ter Sieff.\n37:41 Comment: The redial from afar was from Álvaro Medrán.\n37:45 Comment: The first intervention of the youth squad.\n37:47 Comment:  20 years.\n37:53 Comment: He is now fully incorporated into the first team,\n37:55 Comment: At least until Luka Modric reappears.\n37:57 Comment: We'll see if until Luka Silva arrives, we'll have to see.\n38:3 Comment: A fall, but nothing punishable, for Junior Kicksada.\n38:7 Comment: It's the end of the game.\n38:9 Comment: This group B is going to end.\n38:13 Comment: Madrid is going to start, or it is going to end as it started,\n38:15 Comment: winning, and how it has continued throughout the group.\n38:19 Comment: By winning all six games, they will be the first team in the history of the Champions League\n38:21 Comment: to win all six group games in two consecutive seasons.\n38:25 Comment: The 2011-2012.\n38:27 Comment: And in a few minutes it will be official in 2014-2015.\n38:33 Comment: In the end it is a group that is quite comfortable for Madrid,\n38:35 Comment: But Liverpool have not lived up to the task, far from it, in the group.\n38:39 Comment: Madrid overwhelmed him there at Anfield, and they won here.\n38:41 Comment: A game in which there was, I think he came out with all the substitutes, many substitutes.\n38:45 Comment: I think the first leg was the turning point for Madrid.\n38:47 Comment: That's where the high started to hit, huh?\n38:49 Comment:  Yes I agree.\n38:51 Comment: Towards the stars, right?

    "summary": "On a chilly night at the iconic Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, Real Madrid displayed their incredible prowess against Ludogorets, securing a comprehensive 4-0 victory in the final group stage match of the Champions League. The backdrop was electric, with Madrid seeking their sixth consecutive win in the group phase and aiming to etch themselves into the history books by becoming the first team to do so in two separate seasons.\n\nThe first half commenced with an initial setup phase that saw both sides grappling to control possession. Real Madrid started with Keylor Navas in goal, a back four comprising Arbeloa, Varane, Nacho, and Coentrao, and a midfield trio with Illarramendi, Kroos, and Isco. Bale and Ronaldo flanked Chicharito up front.\n\nIn the early exchanges, Real Madrid rapidly asserted their dominance. The midfield, particularly through Toni Kroos and Illarramendi, orchestrated the play with precision. Cristiano Ronaldo, ever the attacking threat, was closely marked by the Ludogorets defense, yet managed to carve out the first significant chance, linking up brilliantly with Gareth Bale. Gareth Bale's majestic runs and deft touches consistently troubled the Bulgarian side. In fact, Bale had a specular shot that caught the eye, albeit narrowly going above the crossbar.\n\nLudogorets, although pressed back, demonstrated grit and compactness in defense, hoping to make their forward forays count through counterattacks led by Dani Ávalo and Marcelinho. However, their efforts were stymied by a well-marshalled Real Madrid defense, especially anchored by Varane's bright performance.\n\nThe tidal wave of Madrid pressure eventually paid off in a manner that felt almost inevitable. A series of corner kicks, expertly delivered by Kroos, brought about chaos in the Ludogorets penalty area. During one such instance, a header from Gareth Bale clattered onto Arbeloa who, tangled amidst the confusion, forced a clearance resulting in another corner. \n\nReal Madrid’s relentless corner routines bore fruit in a somewhat dramatic twist. Following another dangerous corner, Gareth Bale’s attempted header was intercepted with a crude challenge by Marcelinho, leading to his immediate red card. The resulting penalty was dispatched with ease by Cristiano Ronaldo, bringing his tally to 72 in the Champions League—a feat that drew him level with the legendary Raúl.\n\nThis goal changed the dynamics entirely, with Ludogorets forced into cautious retreat. The Bulgarian side, now reduced to 10 men, struggled to cope with the incessant pressure from the home team. It wasn’t long before the second goal came via a beautifully crafted play once again initiated by Kroos; his inch-perfect cross found Gareth Bale who, unmarked, powered a header into the net. The assistant referee confirmed that the ball had crossed the line, ensuring Madrid’s two-goal cushion.\n\nThe remainder of the first half saw Real Madrid comfortably maintaining their lead, their midfield trio efficiently recycling possession and probing for further weaknesses in the Ludogorets defense. Despite several attempts, including a stunning drive from distance by Kroos that rattled the post, the score remained 2-0 at half-time.\n\nThe second half began with Real Madrid bringing the same intensity. The home team’s control was unwavering, with Isco providing flair and Ronaldo striving to increase his record-setting tally of Champions League goals. A swap in Ludogorets’ forward positions was noted, with Dani Ávalo moving up as the main striker and Misidjan covering the left flank, hoping to change their fortunes.\n\nReal Madrid fans were treated to the return of fitness sensation Jesé Rodríguez, who was subbed in early for Toni Kroos, causing a tactical shift that saw Madrid almost adopting a 4-4-2 formation. Jesé’s entry infused fresh energy, immediately connecting well with Ronaldo and Bale.\n\nEfforts from Real Madrid continued to pour in with Marcelo also being introduced to bolster the attack from the left-back position. His link-ups with Ronaldo created additional avenues for goal-scoring opportunities. On the other hand, Ludogorets, anchored mainly by their stoic goalkeeper Stoyanov, managed to valiantly fend off Madrid’s rampant attacks for a considerable duration of the second half.\n\nThe bulging pressure finally erupted into a third goal through an unexpected source—Álvaro Arbeloa. In another surging corner routine, Arbeloa found himself perfectly positioned to convert the rebound, ensuring that Real Madrid were well and truly out of sight. Ludogorets struggled to mount any significant counter, mostly confined to sporadic isolated runs which were readily intercepted by Madrid’s defence.\n\nA moment of concern flashed briefly when Gareth Bale suffered a nosebleed after a collision with Terziev. Despite blood trickling down, Bale’s resilience saw him continue after receiving swift medical attention but was substituted soon after for Álvaro Medrán.\n\nIn these closing stages, the emerging youth talent Medrán took the spotlight. Exuding confidence from the onset, he capitalized on a ball delivered inside the box and dispatched Real Madrid’s fourth with a shot that took a deflection, leaving Stoyanov helpless. \n\nGese also exhibited his sharp prowess showing no signs of the injury layoff as he dribbled confidently past defenders, ensuring the crowd was given a glimpse of his past scintillating form. The latter period was characterized by sustained Madrid pressure, nearly every move orchestrated by a midfield led by an ever-energetic Isco but also balanced by Medrán’s firm presence.\n\nIn the concluding moments, Ludogorets showed some stubborn resistance but by then it was more about Madrid controlling the clock. As the referee blew the final whistle the scoreline read a commanding 4-0 to Real Madrid, sealing an impeccable group stage run marked by triumphs in all six matches. \n\nReal Madrid’s elegant display showcased their depth, tactical versatility, and knack for securing crucial victories with ease. Above all, they manifested their intention for retaining European glory, an intent firmly reinforced with this emphatic victory over Ludogorets. The Santiago Bernabéu roared in unison, every corner of the stadium buzzing with a sense of historic accomplishment as the world’s spotlight rested on Madrid, the unyielding giants of Europe."
