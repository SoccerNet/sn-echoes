the competition in 2010.\n0:9 Comment: But for Juve themselves, it's their first semi-final since 2003, when they beat Real\n0:15 Comment: Madrid at this stage, only to lose to Carlo Ancelotti's AC Milan in the final.\n0:21 Comment: Yeah, it is a huge night for the Italian team.\n0:26 Comment: Clearly marks their return to the top table of European football, where they were so used\n0:31 Comment: to dining in years gone by.\n0:34 Comment: Interesting to see their approach here tonight.\n0:38 Comment: Juventus, clearly they want to take the initiative in front of their own fans, but the target\n0:45 Comment: is just to make sure you're still in this tight, going to Madrid against what is clearly\n0:50 Comment: the favourites.\n0:51 Comment: And here's an early opportunity for Vidal, who goes down.\n0:55 Comment: It was a clearance from Casillas that had put Real Madrid under pressure in the first\n1:0 Comment: place.\n1:1 Comment: He found a lot of space there, didn't he?\n1:4 Comment: That's a lack of concentration.\n1:6 Comment: Not just from Casillas, but from one or two teammates as well.\n1:11 Comment: Got closed down quickly though.\n1:16 Comment: Arturo Vidal was the man who delivered the league title with a header against Sampdoria\n1:21 Comment: at the weekend.\n1:22 Comment: But no time for celebration of that.\n1:27 Comment: It is proving their worth in Europe that's the objective now.\n1:31 Comment: Vidal who gives away the free kick.\n1:43 Comment: This was the moment.\n1:47 Comment: They do well to close him down.\n1:55 Comment: Sergio Ramos who got a couple of goals in last season's semi-final.\n1:59 Comment: James Rodriguez who takes the kick.\n2:8 Comment: And it's caught by Gianluigi Buffon.\n2:12 Comment: The two goalkeepers, the only survivors from the semi-final between these two 12 years\n2:18 Comment: ago.\n2:19 Comment: And Buffon saved a key penalty in that match from Luis Figo that helped Juventus to progress\n2:27 Comment: to the final.\n2:28 Comment: Yeah, I wonder whether they might go with the back three as Allegri has done on several\n2:34 Comment: occasions.\n2:35 Comment: But a back four tonight for Juventus.\n2:39 Comment: Huge experience in the middle there with Chiellini and Pannucci.\n2:42 Comment: Got a good relationship.\n2:44 Comment: That pair might need it at times here tonight.\n2:48 Comment: Barzali, the man to miss out.\n2:52 Comment: Here's Carlos Tevez.\n2:53 Comment: And a decent strike at Iker Casillas.\n3:5 Comment: He's the talisman for Juventus.\n3:8 Comment: Tevez is the man that can get them going on the front foot.\n3:15 Comment: Here's Andrea Pirlo.\n3:18 Comment: Now Chiellini to Evra.\n3:26 Comment: This is Vidal.\n3:27 Comment: Just beyond the reach of Alvaro Morata.\n3:35 Comment: Pepe and Varane just have a little conversation there.\n3:49 Comment: Here is Pepe.\n3:50 Comment: And now the Frenchman Raphael Varane.\n3:55 Comment: To Marcelo.\n3:59 Comment: Here's James.\n4:4 Comment: Back to him from Carvajal.\n4:9 Comment: Storaro trying to fend him off.\n4:14 Comment: This is Tony Kroos.\n4:17 Comment: Varane.\n4:20 Comment: Marcelo.\n4:29 Comment: Vidal.\n4:32 Comment: Tevez took it on the turn.\n4:34 Comment: Now Morata.\n4:39 Comment: Who started at a really nice tempo this match.\n4:43 Comment: Both sides seen plenty of the ball.\n4:45 Comment: Yellow losing out to Gareth Bale who's got Ronaldo as an option.\n4:50 Comment: And Marchisio has ended up seeing a free kick.\n4:56 Comment: And Benucci takes a yellow card for that challenge.\n5:0 Comment: Martin Atkinson clearly feeling it was a deliberate attempt to stop the counter.\n5:5 Comment: I think it's an honest attempt at the ball.\n5:7 Comment: Looking at it.\n5:8 Comment: But Bale's feet a little too quick for him.\n5:12 Comment: But this is dangerous territory.\n5:14 Comment: Ronaldo nowhere near as successful from his free kicks this season as he has been.\n5:19 Comment: But he'll be taking this one.\n5:22 Comment: He's alive.\n5:29 Comment: And Celotti hoping that his talisman Ronaldo can offer early hope here for Real Madrid.\n5:38 Comment: Bale an alternative option.\n5:41 Comment: But normally from this kind of range there's only one man.\n5:51 Comment: Ronaldo strikes it against the wall.\n5:54 Comment: There's a good wall.\n5:56 Comment: A little jump allowed the defender to get his head on it.\n6:6 Comment: There's the Swiss international.\n6:8 Comment: Lichtsteiner.\n6:15 Comment: Towards Morata.\n6:18 Comment: He got the better of Pepe and goes for the lob.\n6:20 Comment: And Casillas in a position to take it.\n6:24 Comment: Well for a second there it looked like it was going to float over Casillas.\n6:27 Comment: But they have looked uncertain at the back early on for Real Madrid.\n6:35 Comment: They haven't got really.\n6:36 Comment: I mean Tevez is no slouch.\n6:37 Comment: But Morata's not going to run away from those two centre-backs I don't think.\n6:41 Comment: He hasn't got that kind of pace.\n6:48 Comment: They haven't conceded an away goal in the Champions League, Real Madrid, since the very first group phase match against Ludo Garretts.\n6:58 Comment: Ramos who gave the ball away though then.\n7:2 Comment: Here's Pirlo.\n7:4 Comment: Now Chiellini to Bonucci.\n7:8 Comment: Here's Marchisio.\n7:12 Comment: Chiellini.\n7:17 Comment: Lichtsteiner.\n7:22 Comment: Vidal.\n7:23 Comment: Pirlo.\n7:25 Comment: Chiellini.\n7:26 Comment: Now Evra.\n7:37 Comment: Arturo Vidal.\n7:38 Comment: This is Pirlo.\n7:40 Comment: It's composed play this from the hosts.\n7:43 Comment: Lichtsteiner.\n7:46 Comment: Back to him from Marchisio.\n7:50 Comment: And Tevez has found the gap.\n7:52 Comment: And it's turned in by Morata.\n7:56 Comment: Alvaro Morata comes back to haunt his former club.\n8:0 Comment: And as that came out from Casillas, he was in the right place to turn it home.\n8:5 Comment: He doesn't celebrate but there's plenty of cause for celebration here for Juventus with that early breakthrough.\n8:11 Comment: Well that's the channel that they've been causing problems early on here.\n8:15 Comment: Down that right hand side.\n8:17 Comment: With Vidal.\n8:20 Comment: And Marcelo just haven't got it together.\n8:22 Comment: Look at the size of the gap there.\n8:24 Comment: Marcelo's got to tuck in.\n8:26 Comment: They're appealing for offside but he wasn't.\n8:28 Comment: It certainly wasn't.\n8:32 Comment: And it reflects the good, positive start that they've enjoyed to this match Juve.\n8:45 Comment: It's a good enough strike that from Tevez to ask the question of Casillas and he cannot come up with the answer.\n8:59 Comment: First away goal in the Champions League.\n9:2 Comment: That Real Madrid have conceded in over seven and a half hours of football.\n9:12 Comment: Carlo Ancelotti said in the build up to this game he had no regrets about letting Alvaro Morata who was a finalist with Real Madrid last season go to Juventus.\n9:23 Comment: I wonder if he's having a rethink now.\n9:28 Comment: That's his first season really as a regular.\n9:32 Comment: Sounds like he's enjoyed it and he would have enjoyed that moment even though he didn't celebrate it.\n9:43 Comment: Disco.\n9:45 Comment: Now Marcelo.\n9:49 Comment: Beyond the reach of James with a cross.\n9:56 Comment: Very shaky start for Ancelotti's team defensively.\n10:0 Comment: A huge gap there between centre half and full back.\n10:15 Comment: Here's Vidal.\n10:20 Comment: Morata has won it from Varane.\n10:26 Comment: Ramos was covering there.\n10:37 Comment: Gross.\n10:40 Comment: Here's Carvajal.\n10:46 Comment: Ronaldo the target.\n10:51 Comment: Behind by Bonucci.\n10:52 Comment: Yeah, if you know he conceded a corner there Bonucci had a chance to put it out for a throw in.\n10:58 Comment: And you've got people like Sergio Ramos attacking the ball, Pepe.\n11:4 Comment: Varane's a big lad too just looking to see whether he's gone up.\n11:10 Comment: Now a threat just over the head of Bale.\n11:16 Comment: Here's Isco.\n11:23 Comment: One of the two closing him down.\n11:40 Comment: Marcelo.\n11:42 Comment: Isco.\n11:46 Comment: It's Tony Kroos who has a go.\n11:48 Comment: And Buffon has to help that one round.\n11:51 Comment: Well for someone with such a good shot from distance, Tony Kroos doesn't score enough goals but he's testing Buffon here.\n11:58 Comment: And looks on target.\n12:12 Comment: Kroos with a corner.\n12:16 Comment: Cleared by Vidal.\n12:21 Comment: Here's Isco.\n12:26 Comment: Kroos.\n12:29 Comment: Isco again.\n12:34 Comment: In from James.\n12:44 Comment: Here's the moment again.\n12:45 Comment: Through the legs of Varane making it difficult for Casillas that.\n12:50 Comment: The finish certainly wasn't though.\n12:53 Comment: Simple as it comes from Marata.\n12:58 Comment: 12th goal of the season for the former Real Madrid man.\n13:7 Comment: Max Allegri who's won the title in his first season in charge here.\n13:11 Comment: The same during his spell as coach at Milan.\n13:16 Comment: They weren't keen on him when he first arrived were they?\n13:20 Comment: No he was a very unpopular successor to Antonio Conte.\n13:34 Comment: Here's Pirlo.\n13:38 Comment: Now Vidal.\n13:42 Comment: Chiellini.\n13:46 Comment: Ebra.\n13:54 Comment: Marcello coming under pressure.\n13:57 Comment: Straight away from Marata.\n14:3 Comment: There was an intensity about Juve straight from the off here.\n14:6 Comment: Yep.\n14:9 Comment: Certainly got at that.\n14:10 Comment: Real Madrid back four.\n14:14 Comment: Straight away with a lot of aggression and intent.\n14:24 Comment: Pirlo.\n14:26 Comment: On by Storaro.\n14:31 Comment: Now Carvajal.\n14:33 Comment: On by James.\n14:36 Comment: This is Isco.\n14:39 Comment: Marcello.\n14:41 Comment: Isco with Ramos up to his right.\n14:43 Comment: Has a go anyway.\n14:53 Comment: Well this Juventus team knows how to defend.\n14:57 Comment: The quality of Chiellini and Pernucci.\n15:1 Comment: Huge experience of course with Buffon, Patrice Ebra, Nick Steiner as well.\n15:6 Comment: So, it will make it difficult for the visitors here.\n15:9 Comment: You can bet your life they won't be giving any presents away.\n15:15 Comment: They've grown into this competition as it's gone on Juventus.\n15:18 Comment: They're the only one of the semi-finalists not to have won their group.\n15:22 Comment: They were three points behind the group winners Atletico.\n15:25 Comment: They lost there and against Olympiacos.\n15:27 Comment: Two of their three victories in the group were against Malmo.\n15:31 Comment: Certainly against Dortmund and against Monaco.\n15:34 Comment: They've earned their spurs and they haven't let in a goal in the last three games in the competition.\n15:43 Comment: Here's Pepe.\n15:47 Comment: Now Dani Carvajal.\n15:53 Comment: This is Tevez.\n15:58 Comment: Vidal.\n16:3 Comment: Moved wide by Marchisio to Licksteiner.\n16:9 Comment: Marcello for the throw in.\n16:12 Comment: Getting those two full backs forward at every opportunity.\n16:15 Comment: No lack of adventure there when they get the ball Juventus.\n16:26 Comment: Here's Morata.\n16:37 Comment: He's penalised for backing him.\n16:42 Comment: Here's Marcello.\n17:4 Comment: Morata.\n17:7 Comment: Now Isco.\n17:13 Comment: Marcello.\n17:23 Comment: This is Pepe.\n17:27 Comment: Ramos under pressure this time and Storaro has won it.\n17:30 Comment: He's got two moving to his right.\n17:32 Comment: He's pulled it back for Carlos Tevez.\n17:36 Comment: And off the outside of the post in the end although the ball, I think the flag had gone off for offside.\n17:41 Comment: He was way off but they're getting caught in possession, Real Madrid.\n17:44 Comment: Picking the moments to close down Juve and doing it really well.\n17:49 Comment: Tevez having a go from distance this time.\n17:56 Comment: They've got the tails up here.\n17:59 Comment: A perfect start for them.\n18:6 Comment: Here's Marcello.\n18:32 Comment: Here's Chiellini.\n18:36 Comment: Marad.\n18:43 Comment: Bale's touch to Marcello.\n18:49 Comment: A free kick against Marquizio.\n19:6 Comment: You certainly want to see more from his attacking players than he has done so far in Chiellini.\n19:15 Comment: Kroos.\n19:18 Comment: Khamis with the ball in.\n19:20 Comment: And a header over by Varane.\n19:23 Comment: He's done it really well there.\n19:26 Comment: With the central defender in amongst a clutch of black and white shirts.\n19:37 Comment: Marata to Tevez.\n19:40 Comment: Vidal.\n19:43 Comment: Now Lichtsteiner.\n19:49 Comment: Marquizio.\n19:52 Comment: Not the ball Tevez was needing.\n19:58 Comment: Disko.\n20:1 Comment: Ronaldo.\n20:5 Comment: It's a good idea, a decent run from Gareth Bale.\n20:20 Comment: He's kept a good tempo to it, Juventus.\n20:23 Comment: Keen to build on this good early start, that breakthrough goal in the ninth minute.\n20:28 Comment: For Marata against his former rivals, Real Madrid.\n20:33 Comment: And it has rattled the visitors, you can see that in their body language at times when they're asked to defend.\n20:43 Comment: Real Madrid destroyed the then holders by Munich in last season's semi-final.\n20:50 Comment: They know only too well just how difficult it is to retain this crown.\n20:53 Comment: It's never been done in the Champions League era.\n20:57 Comment: And of course they've got their La Liga title challenge to think of too, which complicates matters.\n21:3 Comment: Unlike Juventus.\n21:6 Comment: And it's two points behind Barcelona with three games left.\n21:10 Comment: They did have a tough old game at Sevilla at the weekend.\n21:14 Comment: I know one or two didn't play in that match, but a lot of them out here in the stadium,\n21:19 Comment: they're going to be very, very focused.\n21:23 Comment: I know one or two didn't play in that match, but a lot of them out here tonight did.\n21:29 Comment: Had to put a lot into it physically to get the 3-2 win.\n21:34 Comment: They're being chased down and harried all the time by this Juventus team,\n21:38 Comment: who've rightly got a bit of a swagger about them with the title already in the bag.\n21:43 Comment: You saw there Andrea Pirlo going all the way, it's clearly a tactic they've chosen to adopt.\n21:49 Comment: To try and squeeze Real Madrid in their own half.\n21:55 Comment: Here's Bale.\n21:57 Comment: Ramos.\n22:0 Comment: Carvajal.\n22:5 Comment: Bale.\n22:10 Comment: Marcelo.\n22:12 Comment: Now Isco.\n22:16 Comment: Marcelo's cross.\n22:20 Comment: Ronaldo applauds the intent, even though the supply wasn't necessarily what he wanted.\n22:31 Comment: Here's Pirlo.\n22:36 Comment: Ebra.\n22:41 Comment: Pirlo going long, looking for Morata, who's in a battle with Varane.\n22:47 Comment: He's doing well up top there, Morata, with his positioning, with the runs that he's making.\n22:52 Comment: Offering a target to his team-mates.\n22:55 Comment: And on slotted round to Cristiano, Ronaldo stayed onside but couldn't get it on target.\n23:0 Comment: Now talk about offering a target, it's a fantastic run and an equally good pass from Isco.\n23:6 Comment: They try and hold the line, Uwe at the back there.\n23:9 Comment: Ronaldo.\n23:15 Comment: Ronaldo has scored in the semifinals for the last three years running.\n23:18 Comment: This is Real Madrid's fifth consecutive appearance at this stage of the competition.\n23:26 Comment: It equals a club record, they also appeared in the first five semifinals of the European Cup.\n23:32 Comment: And still one short of Barcelona's record that ended last year.\n23:40 Comment: This is Pirlo.\n23:46 Comment: And Lichtsteiner has got away from Marcelo and from Isco as well.\n23:53 Comment: But they've got to sort out that side of the defence, Marcelo.\n23:57 Comment: Has been less than effective defensively early on here, and that's the avenue where they're constantly getting some joy.\n24:9 Comment: Marcelo who was absent through injury in last season's semifinal, although he did return to score in the final itself.\n24:26 Comment: Here's Pepe.\n24:28 Comment: Now Tony Crows who was part of the Bayern team that was destroyed by Real Madrid in last season's semi.\n24:34 Comment: Now Isco.\n24:41 Comment: Marcelo.\n24:44 Comment: Ramos tried to drag it back, but he's got away from the goal.\n24:49 Comment: Marcelo.\n24:52 Comment: Ramos tried to drag it back and fooled himself.\n24:57 Comment: And then comes back to nick it away from Morata.\n25:0 Comment: Yeah, that's the disadvantage to playing Ramos in the middle of the park.\n25:3 Comment: He did a great job against Atletico in a more defensive minded capacity, but when he's asked to be creative, to play a quick pass, maybe he's not the best at that.\n25:18 Comment: Tony Crows.\n25:25 Comment: Isco.\n25:30 Comment: James Rodriguez.\n25:35 Comment: Carvajal.\n25:41 Comment: Varane.\n25:43 Comment: Marcelo.\n25:48 Comment: Varane.\n25:53 Comment: Ramos.\n25:59 Comment: Isco.\n26:1 Comment: James.\n26:3 Comment: Manages to feed Carvajal.\n26:5 Comment: It's a good return ball as well to James.\n26:7 Comment: Ronaldo!\n26:8 Comment: Who else?\n26:10 Comment: The man on the spot obliges.\n26:13 Comment: One all.\n26:14 Comment: Just a bit of quality.\n26:17 Comment: In fact, a lot of quality displayed by James Rodriguez there.\n26:23 Comment: Lovely work down the right hand side.\n26:26 Comment: And he puts it on a plate for his teammate.\n26:30 Comment: It's just what they needed because they have it at sixes and sevens at times.\n26:37 Comment: You really wouldn't expect that from a player like that.\n26:39 Comment: You really wouldn't expect Ronaldo to get that kind of spice in the box.\n26:44 Comment: But he did and he wasn't going to miss that.\n27:1 Comment: Ronaldo to the goals.\n27:2 Comment: It is Hat-Trick against Sevilla at the weekend.\n27:4 Comment: We're headers.\n27:5 Comment: And Hedsey wins again.\n27:6 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo.\n27:8 Comment: Goal number 54.\n27:10 Comment: Of a remarkably prolific season again.\n27:24 Comment: Patrice Evra, his former Manchester United teammate, must feel devastated\n27:27 Comment: because after the start that you've been so close to winning,\n27:30 Comment: you've been so close to losing.\n27:31 Comment: That feels like a real slap in the face for them.\n27:36 Comment: Tevez.\n27:38 Comment: Here is Evra.\n27:51 Comment: Chiellini.\n28:6 Comment: Back by Pepe.\n28:8 Comment: That should certainly settle them.\n28:13 Comment: The reigning champions.\n28:14 Comment: It was a bit of an unusually nervous start for them.\n28:21 Comment: They can give any team trouble when they get going with the talent that they've got.\n28:27 Comment: Ronaldo looking more like his live wire self again now.\n28:31 Comment: Visibly lifted by that goal.\n28:39 Comment: Pepe.\n28:41 Comment: Ramos.\n28:44 Comment: Here's Carvajal.\n28:47 Comment: Now James who had such a big part to play in that equalising goal.\n28:50 Comment: And he's involved again here.\n28:52 Comment: Just giving Bale a little too much to do there\n28:55 Comment: against Benucci.\n28:57 Comment: Although Bale's claiming he'd run it over the byline.\n29:2 Comment: The linesman didn't look like he was going to give it until Gareth Bale appealed.\n29:6 Comment: I'm sure that's not the case.\n29:8 Comment: The important thing is,\n29:11 Comment: it was over the line I think.\n29:13 Comment: The important thing is they've got themselves a corner here.\n29:17 Comment: And they're on the front foot.\n29:26 Comment: Cleared by Marchisio.\n29:30 Comment: Back in by Carvajal.\n29:35 Comment: Pepe and Ronaldo in each other's way and Varane was in the thick of it as well.\n29:44 Comment: Here's Isco.\n29:46 Comment: Measured ball from Pirlo to Morata.\n29:52 Comment: Now Tevez.\n29:54 Comment: Just shows too much of that to Pepe.\n30:0 Comment: You start seeing Real Madrid winning more individual battles than they were.\n30:5 Comment: First 15-20.\n30:8 Comment: And now they're going to be in the back of the net.\n30:10 Comment: Individual battles than they were.\n30:13 Comment: First 15-20.\n30:26 Comment: Isco.\n30:29 Comment: Ronaldo.\n30:30 Comment: Here's Vidal.\n30:32 Comment: Now Lichsteiner.\n30:40 Comment: Tevez.\n30:42 Comment: Here's Ebra.\n30:50 Comment: Pirlo.\n30:53 Comment: And now,\n30:55 Comment: the two-goal lead.\n30:57 Comment: Pirlo.\n31:2 Comment: Vidal.\n31:11 Comment: Pirlo.\n31:25 Comment: Carlo Ancelotti, who managed Pirlo at Milan.\n31:29 Comment: In a very successful partnership.\n31:35 Comment: Pirlo hoping to sign off his Italian career with a third Champions League success.\n31:43 Comment: First going down, caught by Marchisio.\n31:53 Comment: Here's Isco.\n31:59 Comment: Ronaldo.\n32:5 Comment: Ramos.\n32:9 Comment: Cleared by Ebra. This is Storaro.\n32:13 Comment: Ebra.\n32:18 Comment: Here's Chiellini.\n32:26 Comment: Lichsteiner.\n32:42 Comment: He's trying to find the feet again.\n32:45 Comment: Juventus, they were knocked back by the equaliser.\n32:55 Comment: Here's Marchisio.\n32:58 Comment: Tevez.\n33:5 Comment: Vidal.\n33:7 Comment: Tevez.\n33:8 Comment: Vidal.\n33:11 Comment: Vidal just trying to slide it through and there was nothing really to aim at.\n33:16 Comment: Pirlo.\n33:18 Comment: Looking to pick out Lichsteiner, who does well to win the header.\n33:22 Comment: Tevez goes for it.\n33:24 Comment: Kept in by Marcelo. Here's Isco.\n33:27 Comment: As Real Madrid look to respond.\n33:31 Comment: Marcelo ends up giving it away to Arturo Vidal.\n33:35 Comment: You'd expect it better there on the counter.\n33:39 Comment: And now it's Juventus themselves countering.\n33:41 Comment: Tevez.\n33:44 Comment: Marchisio.\n33:46 Comment: Opts to shoot.\n33:51 Comment: Casillas asking why he wasn't closed down because...\n33:55 Comment: Marchisio is just one of several that can hit them from those kind of distances.\n33:59 Comment: In fact, you've got them on both sides.\n34:9 Comment: It's a good game though, there's nothing cagey about it.\n34:14 Comment: Which can often happen in the first leg of...\n34:17 Comment: these matches in the knockout phase.\n34:38 Comment: Wide of Carvajal but he got a touch to give Madrid the throw-in.\n34:49 Comment: Now James.\n34:54 Comment: Here's Marcelo.\n34:59 Comment: Isco.\n35:2 Comment: And again.\n35:9 Comment: Come back by Lichsteiner for Marchisio but...\n35:13 Comment: Isco endeavouring to try and retrieve it.\n35:15 Comment: And five of the last six years including the last three in a row, the teams that have reached the final did play the home leg of their semi-final first.\n35:43 Comment: I think if Juventus some room for encouragement.\n36:4 Comment: Tevez just tried to turn that one around the back.\n36:8 Comment: He's taking a chance, it was a blind ball.\n36:12 Comment: Benucci.\n36:17 Comment: It's Badao.\n36:19 Comment: Picks out Carlos Tevez.\n36:23 Comment: And brings the free kick this time from Isco's challenge.\n36:35 Comment: He doesn't quite get his foot on the ball, Isco.\n36:43 Comment: Here's Pirlo.\n36:47 Comment: Kizia going in to challenge Marcelo who's expecting a free kick.\n37:4 Comment: He'll be feeling a bit happier now.\n37:6 Comment: What a nervous start to the match from the reigning European champions.\n37:37 Comment: Here's Marata.\n37:41 Comment: Well he stopped an expectation of being given the free kick and did get it.\n37:46 Comment: Just before that Ronaldo thought he was fouled, he's having a word with Martin Atkinson now.\n38:1 Comment: Was a shove in the back from Lichsteiner without question.\n38:4 Comment: The left right on the spot as well.\n38:11 Comment: Here's Benucci.\n38:14 Comment: On by Vidal.\n38:16 Comment: Storaro.\n38:19 Comment: Embrace

defending when Real Madrid have got the ball almost on their own.\n40:1 Comment: On the halfway line.\n40:4 Comment: Here's Pepe.\n40:8 Comment: Ever a sliding in against Carvajal and then losing out

it's a goal.\n40:30 Comment: Isco.\n40:31 Comment: And Marcelo on the follow up after.\n40:33 Comment: James had had the initial effort.\n40:37 Comment: James.\n40:38 Comment: Sat underneath the crossbar.\n40:40 Comment: He's wondering how on earth he didn't score there.\n40:45 Comment: On the stretch but even so.\n40:48 Comment: What a chance.\n40:51 Comment: Isco's been excellent this first half.\n40:54 Comment: He thinks he's set up their second goal here.\n41:1 Comment: So close to a second and how James would have deserved it.\n41:7 Comment: It was his moment of quality that set up the equalizing goal for Cristiano Ronaldo.\n41:14 Comment: With his head.\n41:16 Comment: And James could have had a headed goal of his own there.\n41:31 Comment: He'll be brought back for the original free kick.\n41:52 Comment: Barquizio.\n42:0 Comment: It's been a busy first half for Martin Atkinson.\n42:5 Comment: It's been a good half to watch this.\n42:17 Comment: Here's Lichtsteiner.\n42:20 Comment: Pirlo.\n42:23 Comment: Barquizio.\n42:25 Comment: And it's a goal.\n42:26 Comment: Barquizio.\n42:33 Comment: Around with a header away.\n42:35 Comment: Vidal.\n42:37

And it's a goal.\n43:18 Comment: They do depend on those two fullbacks to give them some width.\n43:21 Comment: Juventus with that system that they adopt.\n43:24 Comment: Quite a narrow midfield.\n43:34 Comment: Here's Varane under pressure from Morata.\n43:38 Comment: That wasn't right in the area.\n43:40 Comment: That was just inside.\n43:43 Comment: Looked a foul.\n43:46 Comment: We've got the extra official behind the goal.\n43:52 Comment: And he got the ball.\n43:53 Comment: He got the ball but he had a chance to deal with that Varane.\n43:57 Comment: And he took a chance.\n44:0 Comment: He dallyed in possession.\n44:9 Comment: Final minutes of the half.\n44:10 Comment: Half in which serious questions have been asked\n44:15 Comment: of the ten times European champions.\n44:25 Comment: Now taken down by\n44:27 Comment: Stefan Lichtsteiner.\n44:29 Comment: And a cheap one to concede just before half time.\n44:31 Comment: Chance for Real Madrid to\n44:33 Comment: pump one forward here if they\n44:36 Comment: are of a mind to.\n44:38 Comment: Lichtsteiner.\n44:42 Comment: A more deliberate approach as they look for James Rodriguez.\n44:46 Comment: It's cleared by Patrice Ebra.\n44:49 Comment: Here's Pepe.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: one is not a bad result actually against Real Madrid but it's important for them\n0:2 Comment: to not concede any more goals this is the most important thing they should\n0:5 Comment: play it smartly actually. Okay Eric thanks back to Rob Hawthorne and Alan Smith.\n0:9 Comment: As well as twice in the home match in that group which Real Madrid won.\n0:19 Comment: Juventus made a positive start to the first half and will be looking to do\n0:24 Comment: likewise again here. This is Pirlo.\n0:30 Comment: Now Lichtsteiner.\n0:34 Comment: Pirlo.\n0:38 Comment: Tony Kroos.\n0:41 Comment: Ramos his third start in four matches in a midfield role. Now Carvajal.\n0:51 Comment: Ramos closed down by Tevez who caught him.\n0:56 Comment: There's a silly one from Carlos Tevez there.\n1:4 Comment: But they want to be aggressive try and hunt down the ball in the way that they\n1:6 Comment: did in the first half successfully.\n1:11 Comment: The yellow card then for Carlos Tevez.\n1:15 Comment: Now Juventus will feel that they they need another goal here to take to the Bernabeu.\n1:32 Comment: Incidentally with the yellow cards there is an amnesty now in place so that\n1:36 Comment: all those accrued previously in the competition are wiped out.\n1:40 Comment: To try and avoid the situation Real Madrid found themselves in\n1:43 Comment: last year when Xabi Alonso was suspended from the final.\n1:49 Comment: All played through the middle and Tevez who's just been booked was\n1:53 Comment: the man there for Juve trying to get on the end of it.\n1:58 Comment: Yeah they closed the gap quickly there. Fernand Pepe in the way that they did\n2:2 Comment: early on in this match. Hidal pushes it on to Carlos Tevez and\n2:6 Comment: it's straight at Casillas.\n2:10 Comment: Well he's the man most likely for Juventus.\n2:15 Comment: Sevilla's top scorer, a man in form.\n2:20 Comment: One short of his 50th goal for Juventus now Carlos Tevez\n2:25 Comment: who's already scored as many goals in the Champions League\n2:28 Comment: this season as he had in all five of his previous campaigns put together.\n2:34 Comment: Marcelo.\n2:42 Comment: Control from Tony Kroos. Here's Carvajal.\n2:50 Comment: James Rodriguez to Ramos.\n2:55 Comment: Kroos.\n2:58 Comment: Marcelo aiming one in for Ronaldo. Floats past he and Chiellini and Ebre.\n3:3 Comment: I don't know if Chiellini let that go. It's a beautifully\n3:7 Comment: floated ball that. No I don't think he could have got to it.\n3:13 Comment: James Rodriguez putting the pressure on there but Buffon\n3:17 Comment: dealt with it calmly enough.\n3:27 Comment: Here's Pepe.\n3:49 Comment: Ramos under pressure from Pirlo who gives away the free kick.\n3:57 Comment: This time it's Doraro who gives away the free kick and Ramos less than enamored with that challenge.\n4:27 Comment: The best kick out there.\n4:41 Comment: Put in a bit of pressure.\n4:49 Comment: It's a good ball from Varane to Carvajal or very nearly was. Couldn't quite keep it in.\n4:57 Comment: That's a good ball.\n5:5 Comment: Here's Giorgio Chiellini.\n5:11 Comment: Chiellini.\n5:23 Comment: Bonucci.\n5:29 Comment: Here's Ebre. He's fallen here for Morata.\n5:38 Comment: By Pepe. Marcicio was putting the pressure on.\n5:44 Comment: Here's Bale.\n5:53 Comment: He's done well to buy that one Ronaldo.\n6:8 Comment: Just close.\n6:14 Comment: Vidal.\n6:20 Comment: Here's Chiellini.\n6:34 Comment: Vidal.\n6:42 Comment: Here's Chiellini.\n6:50 Comment: Carvajal is giving away the free kick.\n6:54 Comment: Trying to help Doraro back to his feet.\n6:56 Comment: He steamed in to try and win the ball and Storoa.\n7:0 Comment: He saw the challenge coming.\n7:4 Comment: It's been a few niggly fouls though at the start of the second half.\n7:7 Comment: It hasn't had the free flowing aspect to it that the first did.\n7:14 Comment: Here's Morata.\n7:23 Comment: Pirlo.\n7:30 Comment: Chiellini.\n7:34 Comment: Ebre.\n7:38 Comment: Vidal trying to leave that behind for Storaro.\n7:41 Comment: Still manages to salvage it.\n7:43 Comment: Morata's touch.\n7:45 Comment: Tevez.\n7:47 Comment: And swept clear in the end by Marcelo.\n7:53 Comment: Yeah, he's just running to traffic there.\n7:55 Comment: Tevez.\n7:56 Comment: I don't know if he had any clear idea of what he wanted to do with it.\n7:59 Comment: A good first time lay off by his strike partner, Morata.\n8:8 Comment: Here's Pirlo.\n8:11 Comment: Ebre.\n8:13 Comment: Morata.\n8:17 Comment: Cleared by James.\n8:20 Comment: And here's Marcelo.\n8:24 Comment: Isco.\n8:30 Comment: There's a touch from Lichtsteiner taking him down.\n8:34 Comment: And giving Real Madrid the free kick.\n8:38 Comment: It doesn't take much for players to go down.\n8:42 Comment: A bit unlucky there, Lichtsteiner.\n8:48 Comment: Storaro had committed himself to the challenge.\n8:51 Comment: And ends up giving away a free kick.\n8:52 Comment: This time for catching James Rodriguez.\n8:59 Comment: The arched eyebrow.\n9:4 Comment: The familiar expression of Carlo Ancelotti, one-time Juventus coach.\n9:8 Comment: This free kick too far out even for Ronaldo to try his luck.\n9:28 Comment: Cruz with the kick.\n9:34 Comment: Helped away by Benucci.\n9:38 Comment: They are formidable in the air by Real Madrid.\n9:55 Comment: As well as that man.\n9:58 Comment: Plenty more besides that can attack the ball with real aggression.\n10:5 Comment: Cruz with the corner.\n10:11 Comment: Marcelo.\n10:13 Comment: Certainly a forceful blast from him.\n10:15 Comment: But the break sets up Juventus.\n10:17 Comment: Tevez with Morata moving to his right having been tripped.\n10:20 Comment: He has to go alone here, Tevez.\n10:23 Comment: Carvajal holds him up and the referee points to the spot.\n10:27 Comment: To Carvajal's disbelief.\n10:30 Comment: Martin Atkinson in no doubt gives the penalty.\n10:33 Comment: And Juventus asking if further action should be taken against the defender.\n10:37 Comment: We've had several incidents in this second half.\n10:42 Comment: Where there's been a little bit of contact.\n10:44 Comment: And the player involved has not hesitated to go down.\n10:48 Comment: I get the feeling that was the case with Carlos Tevez here.\n10:53 Comment: But having said that, Carvajal, he makes the challenge.\n10:57 Comment: Tries to get around the corner and he doesn't get the ball.\n11:1 Comment: I think Martin Atkinson from a distance has made the right challenge.\n11:6 Comment: And the right decision, I beg your pardon.\n11:8 Comment: I don't think he got any help from his assistant either.\n11:11 Comment: He was really quick to blow his whistle to point to the spot.\n11:16 Comment: Despite a penalty being given away to Juventus player who's been booked.\n11:21 Comment: Arturo Vidal had too much to say for himself.\n11:24 Comment: And it looks like Marcelo has now followed him into the book.\n11:28 Comment: Presumably for protesting the decision.\n11:32 Comment: But what a huge moment in this tie.\n11:41 Comment: Carlos Tevez looking for his 50th goal for Juventus.\n11:47 Comment: Facing up to Ike Casillas.\n11:57 Comment: Tevez restores the Juventus lead.\n12:1 Comment: He brings up his half century of goals for the club.\n12:6 Comment: And has them back on the road to the final in Berlin.\n12:11 Comment: He's a player of huge experience.\n12:13 Comment: And as I mentioned before, a player in great form.\n12:20 Comment: How important might that goal be?\n12:22 Comment: I said they would have felt they really did need a second to take to the Bernabeu.\n12:28 Comment: If they can retain this lead.\n12:30 Comment: He gambles on Casillas.\n12:32 Comment: Dive in one way.\n12:36 Comment: And his gamble pays off.\n12:43 Comment: He couldn't look.\n12:44 Comment: He knew from the reaction where that ball had ended up.\n12:50 Comment: Casillas could do nothing about it.\n12:52 Comment: And the champions are back under pressure.\n12:55 Comment: And trailing again here.\n13:0 Comment: The Juventus front two both registering.\n13:3 Comment: Tevez, a former Manchester United teammate of this man, Cristiano Ronaldo.\n13:9 Comment: Together when they won the Champions League back in 2008.\n13:12 Comment: When Tevez actually scored from the spot in the shootout.\n13:15 Comment: And it's another big penalty tonight.\n13:18 Comment: From Carlos Tevez that is to Juventus' advantage.\n13:23 Comment: It's a funny one that because it was two against two.\n13:25 Comment: And if Marcelo hadn't have tripped Marata.\n13:28 Comment: The dynamics of it might have been a bit different.\n13:30 Comment: In the end Tevez had no choice but to take on Carvajal.\n13:35 Comment: And I bet he's glad he did.\n13:39 Comment: Ramos.\n13:46 Comment: And again Sergio Ramos.\n13:48 Comment: Ronaldo.\n13:52 Comment: Marcelo.\n14:2 Comment: Lichtsteiner hoping to watch it out.\n14:8 Comment: Ramos.\n14:10 Comment: So\n14:53 Comment: Left behind by Tevez for Patrice Ebra.\n15:0 Comment: Just for a moment then Carvajal.\n15:2 Comment: Must have had another moment of doubt.\n15:5 Comment: Yeah, just trying to avoid the contact as they cross paths here.\n15:10 Comment: A lot of the Juventus players no doubt asking that Carvajal perhaps should have been sent off there.\n15:20 Comment: Pirlo with a corner.\n15:24 Comment: Back in from Marchisio and...\n15:30 Comment: ...all taken by Casillas.\n15:53 Comment: Moran.\n16:11 Comment: Give it away to Pirlo.\n16:16 Comment: Here's Ebra.\n16:25 Comment: Bonucci.\n16:34 Comment: Ebra.\n16:40 Comment: Vidal waiting for men to arrive in the middle.\n16:44 Comment: Storaro's shot.\n17:5 Comment: And Ancelotti's going to revert to his favoured 4-3-3 with Hernandez about to come on.\n17:19 Comment: Down the middle aim towards Vidal who went down very theatrically indeed.\n17:28 Comment: He did take a chance though Carvajal.\n17:33 Comment: He did have arms on Vidal.\n17:38 Comment: So here comes the changes. Real Madrid send for the man who was the hero of their emergence from the quarterfinal.\n17:45 Comment: Javier Hernandez coming on for Isco.\n18:2 Comment: Hernandez straight into it.\n18:7 Comment: Looks for Bale.\n18:10 Comment: Driven across by Ramos.\n18:12 Comment: And Ronaldo couldn't have been very far from applying a touch to that.\n18:17 Comment: Well they all looked across at the linesman thinking the flag might have gone up here.\n18:23 Comment: It shouldn't have.\n18:26 Comment: Oh dear oh dear.\n18:30 Comment: A new hair's breadth away from getting a good contact.\n18:35 Comment: And you'll know now that Benucci was playing them on.\n18:40 Comment: Going to bring on another defender now Max Allegri.\n18:43 Comment: Barzagli is the player who's going to come on which suggests they might revert to a back 3 as Storaro is the man coming off.\n18:58 Comment: Drop Vidal.\n19:0 Comment: Back a touch.\n19:27 Comment: It would be a fantastic result to achieve this 2-1 against the reigning champions.\n19:31 Comment: They'd take it all day long and for Allegri's substitution you suspect that he would.\n19:50 Comment: Puyol with a really loose ball.\n19:58 Comment: Here's James.\n20:3 Comment: Ronaldo.\n20:7 Comment: It's Tony Kroos.\n20:10 Comment: Blocked by Vidal.\n20:11 Comment: He's in there again against Marcelo but Kroos.\n20:14 Comment: Finds Carvajal.\n20:19 Comment: Passed it across by Bale just beyond the reach of the stretching Cristiano Ronaldo.\n20:26 Comment: Bale will be drifting onto this right hand side a bit more now in this revised system.\n20:42 Comment: Chiellini taking no prisoners, getting a cut on the eye for his troubles.\n20:53 Comment: Chiellini was sent off in the match last season for an elbowing offence against Cristiano Ronaldo but he's the winded one here.\n21:5 Comment: Yeah, they'll be happy to take the time here as well.\n21:8 Comment: Try and take the heat out of the occasion, out of the Real Madrid fight back.\n21:20 Comment: Carlo Ancelotti who developed a reputation as bridesmaid rather than bride in his time at Juventus.\n21:25 Comment: In a couple of seasons they finished runners up giving away a nine point lead on one occasion.\n21:42 Comment: He was the coach of Juventus when they let a two nil lead slip against Manchester United in the semi finals of this competition when United were on their way to winning the treble.\n22:12 Comment: He is that type of defender, Chiellini. He suits the bandage round the head I think.\n22:24 Comment: Very much in the Terry Butcher mould.\n22:30 Comment: Really well worked. Real Madrid goal that could do with another bit of inspiration now.\n22:44 Comment: He needs another shirt, won't he?\n22:49 Comment: And shorts.\n22:54 Comment: And t-shirt.\n22:57 Comment: Just get him a new wardrobe.\n23:7 Comment: Vidal.\n23:10 Comment: Morata.\n23:22 Comment: Here's Marcelo.\n23:34 Comment: Real Madrid made hay at the weekend against a severe team reduced in number by a player who'd gone off injured and spent nine minutes off the pitch before he returned, by which time Ronaldo had helped himself to a couple of goals.\n23:48 Comment: Ramos' passing hasn't been quite on tonight.\n23:51 Comment: One or two cross field balls not finding the mark.\n23:57 Comment: Certainly that move to put the vice captain into midfield hasn't been as successful here as it has in previous matches, particularly that quarter final against Atletico.\n24:14 Comment: Here's Benucci.\n24:16 Comment: Now Morata.\n24:20 Comment: Marquizio.\n24:26 Comment: McSteiner with a cross.\n24:29 Comment: Not passed for Randa, not passed Pepe.\n24:54 Comment: Morata for Tevez.\n25:2 Comment: Vidal.\n25:4 Comment: Pirlo.\n25:7 Comment: McSteiner with a header across. Will it fall here for Morata?\n25:10 Comment: Does his best to rescue it for Tevez but Pepe away.\n25:13 Comment: Only to Pirlo.\n25:17 Comment: This is Ebreh.\n25:20 Comment: We haven't seen Pirlo being able to ping those little balls in towards the front lads too often.\n25:25 Comment: We saw an example there though.\n25:41 Comment: Kick conceded by Patrice Ebreh.\n26:1 Comment: McSteiner's boot too high for Martin Atkinson's liking.\n26:12 Comment: Here's Carvajal.\n26:18 Comment: James Rodriguez.\n26:20 Comment: Marcelo.\n26:24 Comment: Here's Tevez trying to help it on to the evident frustration of James.\n26:29 Comment: Cleared by Marquizio. Here's Morata.\n26:32 Comment: Two breaking to his right. Tevez and Vidal.\n26:39 Comment: Here's Pirlo.\n26:42 Comment: Now Lichsteiner.\n26:48 Comment: Not quite on the same wavelength.\n26:55 Comment: Barzali.\n26:56 Comment: Trying to keep up with Javier Hernandez.\n27:0 Comment: Chiellini steps in.\n27:2 Comment: It's a poor ball from Hernandez.\n27:11 Comment: Chiellini will make the most of the situation, take his time.\n27:35 Comment: Here's Pepe.\n27:40 Comment: Marcelo.\n27:50 Comment: Ramos. Too deep.\n27:52 Comment: That's an example of how it's been for Sergio Ramos tonight.\n27:57 Comment: In terms of his passing.\n28:18 Comment: Here's Kroos.\n28:25 Comment: Ramos this time finding Tony Kroos.\n28:29 Comment: Ronaldo. Here's Hernandez.\n28:36 Comment: Bale with the ball across.\n28:40 Comment: And Kroos.\n28:44 Comment: Sat up temptingly for him.\n28:52 Comment: I think Juventus will be pleased, Allegri will be pleased with the way his team has handled the situation since going a goal ahead.\n29:6 Comment: Lost just one of 17 home matches in Europe since this ground was redeveloped.\n29:14 Comment: Become a hard outfit to beat here.\n29:18 Comment: Marcelo. Now Hernandez.\n29:25 Comment: Morata.\n29:27 Comment: He's got nowhere to go here.\n29:29 Comment: He's got to come back.\n29:31 Comment: He's done well to get the foul.\n29:33 Comment: Carvajal was lucky to escape further action for giving away the penalty.\n29:36 Comment: Has been shown a yellow card now.\n30:33 Comment: Into the final quarter of an hour here.\n30:36 Comment: Juventus looking to hold on to what would be an invaluable first leg lead.\n30:43 Comment: On the six previous occasions they've played the home leg of their semifinal first in this competition.\n30:48 Comment: They have won the match and the only time they lost the tie was back in 1978 against Bruges.\n30:57 Comment: It would leave the tie on a knife edge.\n31:3 Comment: Carvajal with a cross.\n31:8 Comment: Back across by Ramos. Will it fall here for Hernandez?\n31:15 Comment: Pepe.\n31:17 Comment: Kroos.\n31:20 Comment: Marcelo. Hernandez.\n31:24 Comment: James with the ball in.\n31:27 Comment: Away by Vannucci.\n31:28 Comment: Got that extra central defender now.\n31:35 Comment: Morata losing out.\n31:39 Comment: Evra's header.\n31:42 Comment: Bale.\n31:43 Comment: Ramos.\n31:46 Comment: Back across by Bale.\n31:49 Comment: Hernandez leapt for it.\n31:50 Comment: It's come all the way out though to Tony Kroos.\n31:53 Comment: Now Varane.\n31:55 Comment: James.\n32:0 Comment: Ronaldo went for it but Chiellini managed to get up ahead of him.\n32:4 Comment: Vital touch but you can see Juventus they've set the stall out now for these last 15 minutes.\n32:11 Comment: Try and see out this lead.\n32:24 Comment: Morata is going to come off having scored against his old club.\n32:29 Comment: He's done well though hasn't he?\n32:31 Comment: He has done well, played with a lot of intelligence.\n32:34 Comment: And another player coming on familiar to Real Madrid in Fernando Llorente.\n32:45 Comment: Spaniard who has scored seven goals against them in his career including both the group stage matches last season.\n32:54 Comment: Also scored a league winner against them for Athletic Bilbao, his former club.\n32:59 Comment: But the immediate task is to defend a corner.\n33:3 Comment: Kroos takes it and it was in there towards Gareth Bale.\n33:7 Comment: Enough bodies there though for Juventus for now.\n33:10 Comment: Here's James.\n33:13 Comment: All the way out to Carvajal.\n33:19 Comment: Back in by Marcelo.\n33:22 Comment: Away by Vidal.\n33:25 Comment: And here's Carlos Tevez.\n33:33 Comment: He's got to be delighted with the way his players have set about the tactical plan, the way that they've worked.\n33:49 Comment: Just want to keep up that work ethic now for the last 10 minutes or so.\n33:58 Comment: Of course it's still only taken a 1-0 win in the Bernabeu for the home team to go through with the away goal tonight.\n34:4 Comment: But certainly something for the Italians to hold on to.\n34:17 Comment: The stereotype of Italian teams is to be defensively sound.\n34:23 Comment: Benucci took a bit of a risk there and could have come unstuck.\n34:31 Comment: No harm done for now though. Here's Lichtsteiner.\n34:38 Comment: Pirlo.\n34:41 Comment: Marchisio.\n34:44 Comment: Llorente.\n34:48 Comment: Marchisio trying to stretch Carvajal but can't get it beyond him to Ebre.\n34:55 Comment: Kroos.\n34:58 Comment: Now Bale.\n35:2 Comment: At the moment Real Madrid failing to come up with anything particularly creative.\n35:7 Comment: They've lobbed some balls into the box that have been meat and drink for the Juventus defenders.\n35:13 Comment: Need to do better.\n35:17 Comment: Kroos.\n35:53 Comment: Pepe.\n36:2 Comment: Tussle between Hernandez and Chiellini.\n36:8 Comment: Here's Pirlo.\n36:11 Comment: Well for once he lost out to James and here's Javier Hernandez.\n36:14 Comment: James.\n36:17 Comment: Ramos.\n36:20 Comment: Not the first time we've seen that.\n36:23 Comment: Ramos.\n36:26 Comment: Not the first time we've seen that.\n36:29 Comment: Ramos.\n36:35 Comment: Not the first time we've seen that.\n36:41 Comment: Fanciotti's thinking about\n36:44 Comment: Fanciotti's thinking about another change.\n37:2 Comment: So we've got a couple of bits of this\n37:5 Comment: So we've got a couple of bits of this first leg left.\n37:12 Comment: Carvajal.\n37:41 Comment: They do miss Luka Modric.\n37:47 Comment: Somebody to\n37:50 Comment: somebody to pick the pass.\n37:54 Comment: Now they'd love to get Benzema back as well.\n37:56 Comment: Now they'd love to get Benzema back as well. Whether they will be able to.\n37:59 Comment: Whether they will be able to.\n37:59 Comment: Whether they will be able to. For next week's second leg. I'm not so sure.\n38:1 Comment: For next week's second leg. I'm not so sure.\n38:1 Comment: For next week's second leg. I'm not so sure. He's been out for a while hasn't he?\n38:2 Comment: He's been out for a while hasn't he?\n38:2 Comment: He's been out for a while hasn't he? I know he's back in training but\n38:4 Comment: I know he's back in training but\n38:4 Comment: I know he's back in training but might be asking a lot.\n38:8 Comment: might be asking a lot.\n38:8 Comment: might be asking a lot. It's only an option that Ancelotti would\n38:10 Comment: at his disposal.\n38:13 Comment: at his disposal. Can the players he's got out there\n38:14 Comment: Can the players he's got out there get them level here?\n38:16 Comment: get them level here? Marcelo's ball in.\n38:18 Comment: Marcelo's ball in. Away by Bernucci.\n38:22 Comment: Away by Bernucci. Hernandez goes down.\n38:25 Comment: Hernandez goes down. Looking to claim for a push by\n38:27 Comment: Looking to claim for a push by\n38:27 Comment: Looking to claim for a push by Lichtsteiner who was not very\n38:29 Comment: Lichtsteiner who was not very impressed with that fall.\n38:39 Comment: Run.\n38:50 Comment: Fail.\n38:55 Comment: Cava.\n39:0 Comment: La Mica\n39:3 Comment: Now Pepe. James.\n39:17 Comment: James. Ramos.\n39:20 Comment: Ramos. Tony Crows.\n39:23 Comment: Tony Crows. When it sprang off him.\n39:26 Comment: When it sprang off him. To win it back.\n39:29 Comment: To win it back. To win it back.\n39:29 Comment: To win it back. And then James draws for himself a\n39:32 Comment: Now Juventus soaking it up comfortably, easily at the moment.\n39:46 Comment: It certainly hasn't been Real Madrid at the best tonight.

    "summary": "In a thrilling Champions League semi-final first leg clash between Juventus and Real Madrid, Juventus managed to edge out their Spanish arch-rivals with a spirited 2-1 victory at their home turf. The game was filled with intense action, strategic plays, and moments that kept fans on the edge of their seats.\n\nThe match began with a historical reflection, marking Juventus’s first appearance in the semi-final since 2003, igniting hopes to repeat the success of their past glories. Real Madrid, reigning champions and clear favorites, were challenged by Juventus’s ferocious start. Consequently, in an effort to set the pace and energy of the match, both teams deployed strategic and calculated play from the very first whistle.\n\nE: The early minutes saw Juventus take the initiative, creating pressure on Real Madrid’s defense. An opportunity emerged for Arturo Vidal, who found space but couldn't capitalize, leading to a free kick awarded to Real Madrid. The veteran James Rodriguez took the set-piece, but it was comfortably gathered by Juventus's legendary goalkeeper, Gianluigi Buffon.\n\nCom. The Juventus defense, marshalled by Chiellini and Bonucci, was particularly notable for their wealth of experience and steely resolve in shutting down early Real Madrid advances. Juventus employed a formation with a back-four, showcasing a well-coordinated defensive line.\n\nAs the hosts sought to dominate possession, their forward movements led to quick exchanges between Carlos Tevez, Andrea Pirlo, and the industrious Vidal, trying to unlock Real Madrid’s defenses. By the ninth minute, Juventus's persistent pressure paid dividends. Lichsteiner played a pivotal role advancing forward, combining well down the right flank frequently.\n\nE: Alvaro Morata further harried the Real Madrid backline, proving his worth. It was Morata who scored the opening goal in the ninth minute, pouncing on a deflected save from Casillas, striking against his former club. Morata’s clinical touch echoed the intense atmosphere in the stadium, as Juventus supporters erupted with joy, appreciating the tactical execution provided by Maximiliano Allegri’s side.\n\nCom. Despite Real Madrid's defensive resilience, moments of uncertainty, especially with Marcelo losing his positional bearings, created vulnerabilities that Juventus sought to exploit.\n\nThe goal motivated Juventus further, keeping the pressure high, with dynamic movements and precise passes through midfield generals Pirlo and Vidal. Real Madrid seemed rattled initially, yet with a team possessing the likes of Ronaldo and James, they soon settled back into their rhythm.\n\nIn the 27th minute, Real Madrid found themselves back in the game. A sublime sequence of play led to James Rodriguez setting up Cristiano Ronaldo, who expertly headed home the equalizer. Ronaldo's goal, surpassing his tally from the weekend, emphasized his unmatched instincts in high-stakes matches. This reenergized Real Madrid, demonstrating why they were the reigning champions.\n\nCom. The goal from Ronaldo changed the dynamic, offering Carlo Ancelotti's side a crucial lifeline. It also restored confidence among the players, including the likes of Bale, who had looked subdued in the initial phase.\n\nAs the first half progressed, Juventus's defensive discipline returned, effectively containing Real Madrid's attacking threats. The contest continued in a balanced manner, with occasional tactical fouls breaking the play, ensuring that neither side could capitalize readily.\n\nE: Just before the halftime whistle, Real Madrid came close to taking the lead. An expertly delivered cross by James, met by Marcelo at the far post, saw the ball narrowly miss, rattling Juventus's defense. Buffon kept his composure, nullifying further efforts, and ensuring a balanced scoreline at the break.\n\nThe second half mirrored the intensity of the first. Juventus resumed with a ferocious pace, determined not to let their guard down. Tevez, their talisman upfront, tirelessly chased every ball, encapsulating the spirit of Juventus on the night.\n\nE: In the 57th minute, a defining moment arrived. Carlos Tevez drove purposefully into the Real Madrid penalty area, drawing a challenge from Carvajal. The contact was enough for the referee to point to the spot, awarding Juventus a golden opportunity to retake the lead. Tevez stepped up and, with a confident strike, sent Casillas the wrong way, restoring Juventus’s advantage.\n\nCom. The goal was electric, sparking hopes among the Juventus faithful and putting Real Madrid under immense pressure once more. Casillas’s frustration was evident, as the penalty incident had been contentious in perception.\n\nWith the scoreline at 2-1, Real Madrid fought valiantly to find another equalizer. Ancelotti switched tactics, bringing on Javier Hernandez to add extra firepower to the attack. Hernandez’s introduction caused immediate ripple effects, his fresh legs and sharp movement creating additional worries for Juventus's backline.\n\nCom. Juventus's impeccable defensive organization, combined with Buffon’s leadership, stood firm against Los Blancos' relentless pressure. Despite Ramos’s valiant efforts in midfield and Ronaldo’s prowess upfront, Juventus managed to hold their lines effectively.\n\nReal Madrid’s continuous probing saw moments of near breakthroughs. A cross from Ramos almost connected cleanly with Ronaldo, narrowly escaping another headed goal. Juventus responded with tactical substitutions, including the introduction of Barzagli, aiming to fortify their defense and preserve the lead.\n\nE: In the closing stages, Carlos Tevez was substituted for Roberto Pereira, the Argentine's tireless work making a significant impact throughout his time on the pitch. Meanwhile, Gareth Bale was replaced by Jesse for Real Madrid, as the Spanish side desperately searched for an equalizer.\n\nDespite Real Madrid throwing everything forward in the frantic final minutes, Juventus defended resolutely. The tactical discipline of Juventus was evident as they thwarted every Real Madrid advance, clearing crosses and blocking shots with steely determination.\n\nCom. The Italian outfit’s ability to stifle space and limit opportunities encapsulated a masterclass in defending, with Chiellini and Bonucci instrumental in orchestrating these critical phases of play.\n\nAs the final whistle blew, the scoreline remained 2-1 in favor of Juventus, giving them a vital, albeit narrow, advantage going into the second leg at the Bernabeu. Juventus had triumphed against the odds, through a collective team effort and tactical acumen, laying the groundwork for what promises to be an exhilarating return leg in Spain.\n\nE: Reflecting on the match, Juventus’s victory underscored their resurgence on the European stage, a team seasoned with experience and youth showing they could hold their own against Europe’s elite. For Real Madrid, the game highlighted areas needing address, particularly in defensive coordination and dealing with high-press situations.\n\nIn summary, the semi-final clash between Juventus and Real Madrid at Juventus Stadium provided football fans with a compelling spectacle, contrasting strategies, pivotal moments, and thrilling football. The first leg has set the stage for a blockbuster second leg, where legacies are made and dreams shattered on the grandest stage of European football."
