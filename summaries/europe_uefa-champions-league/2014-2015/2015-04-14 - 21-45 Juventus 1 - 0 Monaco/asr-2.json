    "input": "\n    Juventus 1 - 0 Monaco\n\nFirst Half:\n\n0:0 Comment: of opportunity, one to be grasped over a decade since either club have graced a Champions League\n0:6 Comment: semi-final. Now is the time for one of them. Monaco in their change strip tonight, which I can tell\n0:14 Comment: you has gone down well in the commentary box because it gives us half a chance of deciphering\n0:17 Comment: their numbers. Looking forward to a good game Dan, I think these are two counter-attacking sides but\n0:25 Comment: undoubtedly I think it's up to Juve in this home leg to take the game to Monaco but we see well\n0:31 Comment: from that first leg at the Emirates what they did to Arsenal on the counter-attack so it's\n0:35 Comment: going to be very interesting tonight but I don't think you'll see this Juve side underestimating\n0:40 Comment: them as Arsenal did and there's the main man just dropping back into that position between the\n0:46 Comment: centre-backs to start everything off. Here's Morata looking to make progress up against\n0:51 Comment: Radji and Carvalho got across, here's Pereira. Juventus getting on the front foot pretty quickly.\n1:3 Comment: The two negative voices in the press conference yesterday suggesting that it might be a rather\n1:12 Comment: cagey encounter but Juventus is perhaps giving the lie to that.\n1:20 Comment: Here is Patrice Evra. Morata, now Pirlo losing out to Kondogbia.\n1:32 Comment: Carrasco, left-hand side just made his international debut for Belgium.\n1:38 Comment: Martial.\n1:45 Comment: We know they've got the confidence to hit teams on the break, Monaco, and get back into that shape as quickly as possible but two different shapes and that's what makes for better games for me.\n1:56 Comment: If they're playing exactly the same shape then it's just matching up man for man but it's the diamond system against a 4-3-3 if you like.\n2:4 Comment: It can get a little bit more technical if you want to explain a 4-3-3 but it always remains a 4-3-3 to me.\n2:10 Comment: But the diamond of Juve is there to be seen.\n2:14 Comment: Fabinho with a ball that was always asking too much of Carrasco but some really promising signs for Monaco in possession there.\n2:23 Comment: This is Littsteiner. A right back of relentless running from Switzerland.\n2:31 Comment: Morata, Fabinho in the way. Playing in central midfield as he did at Arsenal but he is a right back by trade.\n2:39 Comment: Here's Tevez.\n2:47 Comment: Morata and Tevez were devastating against Dortmund. The way they hit them on the break.\n2:52 Comment: Tonight's going to be a different game. They're going to be sitting deep Monaco.\n2:55 Comment: There's not going to be a lot of space in behind. The space in behind was which Morata exploited brilliantly in those games.\n3:2 Comment: Tonight he's going to have a lot more ball to his feet with his back to play and bringing other people into it.\n3:8 Comment: It's a different type of game for him tonight. It's interesting to see how he adapts.\n3:11 Comment: Dortmund aside with a very different approach.\n3:15 Comment: Tevez finding no way through and finding no sympathy from the officials.\n3:21 Comment: Martial who can often pop up on that left hand side.\n3:27 Comment: Often starts in that position when Berbatov is playing.\n3:31 Comment: And that's why he's likened to Thierry Henry who started his days on the left hand side and cut in.\n3:37 Comment: And then obviously was put up front as Martial is playing at the moment.\n3:41 Comment: But they sort of favoured that left hand side. Drift over to the left hand side.\n3:45 Comment: Cutting in on that right foot.\n3:47 Comment: And on Reeve to devastate and affect him.\n3:50 Comment: In my opinion he's probably one of the best in the Premier League that we've seen.\n3:55 Comment: I'm sure an interested spectator tonight with two of his old clubs locking horns.\n4:4 Comment: That was Licksteiner.\n4:5 Comment: Tevez.\n4:7 Comment: Marchisio.\n4:9 Comment: He'll get it back for Morata.\n4:10 Comment: Such a stylish figure in that midfield.\n4:13 Comment: Marchisio.\n4:14 Comment: This is Evra.\n4:17 Comment: Vidal finding Tevez.\n4:20 Comment: Evra.\n4:24 Comment: Might sit up nicely for Tevez.\n4:26 Comment: And between them Kondogbia and Abdono got in the way of it.\n4:30 Comment: But no way out.\n4:32 Comment: The young man at the heart of the midfield giving it away.\n4:35 Comment: And here's Tevez.\n4:38 Comment: Pirlo.\n4:39 Comment: Or Morata in space and the flag stayed down.\n4:42 Comment: And a golden chance passes Juventus by.\n4:45 Comment: There were numbers in the middle.\n4:47 Comment: I think Tevez is having a go at him.\n4:49 Comment: I think he's offside actually. He gets away with it.\n4:52 Comment: But that one's got to go for that far post and low.\n4:54 Comment: Now if you drag it wide.\n4:57 Comment: And Tevez may run it in at the far post.\n5:0 Comment: But could have even had a little bit more awareness and brought it down.\n5:4 Comment: That was a difficult volley.\n5:5 Comment: First chance of the game and a good one at that.\n5:12 Comment: Tevez very much the kingpin.\n5:15 Comment: In an attacking sense.\n5:18 Comment: And Jo√£o Moutinho.\n5:19 Comment: Likewise for Monaco.\n5:21 Comment: The favoured son if you like.\n5:23 Comment: Under Leonardo Jardim.\n5:29 Comment: Lichtsteiner.\n5:35 Comment: Pirlo.\n5:37 Comment: Vidal.\n5:41 Comment: A sweat for Evra.\n5:44 Comment: Vidal arriving.\n5:46 Comment: Duran's got to be careful.\n5:51 Comment: Tevez.\n5:52 Comment: Trying to work shooting space.\n5:57 Comment: And he's got it.\n5:59 Comment: And it's in.\n6:2 Comment: Tevez.\n6:6 Comment: Well excellent strike there with the ball.\n6:7 Comment: Carlos Tevez.\n6:8 Comment: You can't give him that shooting space outside the area.\n6:10 Comment: Good stop. First stop.\n6:14 Comment: Subhasichi goes down low to his right.\n6:16 Comment: Takes it quite cleanly.\n6:17 Comment: But cannot give Tevez time and space outside that area.\n6:21 Comment: It's a very good strike with the ball.\n6:22 Comment: Very clean striker.\n6:26 Comment: Juve certainly making the early running.\n6:32 Comment: Dera.\n6:35 Comment: And here's Radji.\n6:39 Comment: Certainly looking forward to this night.\n6:42 Comment: Andrea Radji.\n6:44 Comment: To seek his footballing fortunes away from the motherland.\n6:53 Comment: And Vidal getting the foul.\n6:54 Comment: Trying to wind the crowd up.\n6:55 Comment: Get them going.\n6:57 Comment: Inspirational figure, Vidal.\n6:59 Comment: He plays left-hand side of that diamond.\n7:1 Comment: Would play right actually if Pogba was fit.\n7:3 Comment: But Pogba not being fit.\n7:5 Comment: Switches over to the left-hand side.\n7:6 Comment: Makisio over to the right-hand side.\n7:8 Comment: They've got big parts to play in that diamond.\n7:10 Comment: Left and right-hand side of it.\n7:12 Comment: Because they've got to be the legs for Pierlog.\n7:15 Comment: Not only have they got to be supporting him midfield.\n7:17 Comment: But helping the full-back as well when he comes under pressure.\n7:22 Comment: Makisio keeping Chiellini honest.\n7:32 Comment: And it's away.\n7:35 Comment: Abinho finding Kondogbia.\n7:39 Comment: Shooting chance maybe.\n7:43 Comment: There was no danger of Kuzawa passing that one up.\n7:47 Comment: Well struck it well.\n7:48 Comment: Too high but it's a good strike.\n7:49 Comment: He's trying to cut across the ball which he succeeds in doing.\n7:52 Comment: But doesn't keep it low enough to trouble the keeper.\n7:56 Comment: And it's away.\n7:57 Comment: He's trying to cut across the ball which he succeeds in doing.\n7:58 Comment: But doesn't keep it low enough to trouble the keeper.\n8:7 Comment: Can't escape Vidal's clutches.\n8:12 Comment: By Fabinho.\n8:18 Comment: Tevez.\n8:20 Comment: Here's Bonucci.\n8:27 Comment: It's Pereira.\n8:31 Comment: Breaker the ball.\n8:32 Comment: Threatened to favour him for a moment.\n8:33 Comment: But Carvalho sweeps up for Monaco.\n8:39 Comment: I mentioned there was a slight injury scare over him.\n8:41 Comment: But all the experience he has at his disposal will be vital tonight.\n8:47 Comment: For the team from the Principality.\n8:48 Comment: Champions League winner we shouldn't forget with Porto.\n8:51 Comment: 11 seasons ago now.\n8:53 Comment: Marcial.\n8:58 Comment: He's got Bonucci for company.\n8:59 Comment: Carrasco with a chance here.\n9:2 Comment: And Buffon with major business to attend to.\n9:6 Comment: But a real let off for Juventus in the end.\n9:11 Comment: And here's Tevez at the other end.\n9:14 Comment: All those who said it would be cagey having to eat their words.\n9:17 Comment: This is Pereira.\n9:18 Comment: Such an inviting ball.\n9:21 Comment: Great start to the game.\n9:23 Comment: Should be one up for me, Monaco.\n9:26 Comment: Carrasco should score there.\n9:27 Comment: As Marcial set him up.\n9:29 Comment: He was talking about Thierry Henry.\n9:30 Comment: That was very Thierry Henry-esque.\n9:32 Comment: Cutting in and setting him up with a lovely slid pass with the right foot.\n9:36 Comment: Carrasco had time to get it wider than that of Buffon.\n9:38 Comment: Good stop but he should have scored.\n9:41 Comment: And he did.\n9:43 Comment: And he's got a chance.\n9:44 Comment: He's got time to get it wider than that of Buffon.\n9:46 Comment: Good stop but he should have scored, I feel.\n9:52 Comment: A few let-offs at either end in the early stages here.\n9:57 Comment: Marata.\n9:58 Comment: Lichtsteiner.\n10:1 Comment: Tipped in ball again.\n10:2 Comment: No takers.\n10:6 Comment: Here is Carrasco.\n10:8 Comment: Maybe in a mood to atone.\n10:14 Comment: And a shooting chance.\n10:15 Comment: It got a nick.\n10:16 Comment: And Buffon busy again.\n10:19 Comment: Well, two decent stops already from Buffon.\n10:21 Comment: There's a little nick that he was talking about.\n10:23 Comment: Made it loop slightly on Buffon.\n10:26 Comment: Not really a problem.\n10:27 Comment: Got it away.\n10:28 Comment: There's the chance for Carrasco.\n10:29 Comment: That should be wide of Buffon.\n10:32 Comment: Quite close to him, isn't it?\n10:33 Comment: And there's the ball slid across the area up the other end already.\n10:36 Comment: We've had some good half chances.\n10:38 Comment: But that one's got to be wider than that.\n10:40 Comment: Straight at him.\n10:41 Comment: Only way it's going to beat him if it goes under him.\n10:43 Comment: There wasn't enough pace for that.\n10:45 Comment: We'll wait and see if they live to regret not taking that opportunity.\n10:48 Comment: But they've got another one here.\n10:54 Comment: A really dangerous corner from Moutinho.\n10:57 Comment: Here's Fabinho.\n11:3 Comment: Forward by Radji.\n11:5 Comment: Moutinho.\n11:7 Comment: Kondogbia.\n11:8 Comment: Now Dira.\n11:10 Comment: Step inside nicely.\n11:13 Comment: Carrasco will let fly.\n11:16 Comment: If Patrice ever knew all about that.\n11:18 Comment: Good spell for Monaco.\n11:19 Comment: Dira.\n11:22 Comment: Moutinho has dug it out.\n11:24 Comment: Maciel.\n11:30 Comment: Well, there's enough already to suggest that they're a force going forward, Monaco.\n11:34 Comment: Three quick strikers.\n11:35 Comment: Going to give problems, I think, for Juventus if they commit too many players forward.\n11:39 Comment: And they leave those full backs and centre-backs isolated.\n11:43 Comment: And they've got the ability to beat them one-on-one.\n11:46 Comment: 12 in the last five away games.\n11:48 Comment: Monaco.\n11:50 Comment: Crept into the top three in Ligue 1 this weekend.\n11:54 Comment: With that away victory at Caen.\n11:56 Comment: Confidence maybe as high as it's been all season.\n12:1 Comment: Here's Fabinho.\n12:2 Comment: Confidence maybe as high as it's been all season.\n12:4 Comment: Here's Marcizio.\n12:8 Comment: Evra.\n12:12 Comment: Marcizio.\n12:17 Comment: Unlucky from Marcizio and trying to slip Evra in there.\n12:21 Comment: But Evra is going to have to provide that width.\n12:24 Comment: He was offside anyway.\n12:25 Comment: But full-backs Licksteiner on one side.\n12:28 Comment: Evra on the other.\n12:29 Comment: Got to provide the width with the diamond system.\n12:31 Comment: And get as far up the pitch as possible.\n12:32 Comment: But it's going to leave you isolated as it is on this occasion.\n12:36 Comment: Look, you can see defenders backpedalling already.\n12:39 Comment: It's well set up, isn't it, by Marcial and Carrasco.\n12:42 Comment: I think that's got to be wider of the keeper than that.\n12:49 Comment: Evra winning that one.\n12:50 Comment: Says he's never worked so hard as he has this season.\n12:53 Comment: Patrick Severin.\n12:58 Comment: As you suggested, a lot of people said to him\n13:0 Comment: Serie A would be easy in comparison.\n13:2 Comment: But he feels it has not proved to be the case.\n13:4 Comment: I thought you meant he was doing a bit of cab driving on the side then or something.\n13:10 Comment: Only you would think that, Tony.\n13:12 Comment: Here's Tevez.\n13:14 Comment: Now Vidal.\n13:17 Comment: I thought about it.\n13:18 Comment: Here's Pirlo.\n13:22 Comment: Tevez.\n13:25 Comment: Here's Marcial.\n13:27 Comment: On for Carrasco again.\n13:31 Comment: Trying to get the better of Chiellini.\n13:34 Comment: Keeps a foothold after that pitfall slip against\n13:38 Comment: Mauricio Dortmund in the previous round.\n13:40 Comment: Which in the end didn't cost him particularly dear.\n13:42 Comment: Although it presented a goal to Marco Reus on a plate.\n13:46 Comment: Well, it had a fair bit to do with the finish, mind you.\n13:49 Comment: Yeah, good finish.\n13:50 Comment: It was a big, big slip at the end.\n13:52 Comment: Good finish.\n13:53 Comment: It was a big, big slip at the back though, wasn't it?\n13:55 Comment: Can't afford those tonight.\n14:13 Comment: Schicksteiner.\n14:15 Comment: Mauricio.\n14:18 Comment: Pirlo.\n14:20 Comment: And Radar not quite working at full pelt.\n14:23 Comment: This is Dira.\n14:27 Comment: Monaco certainly looking capable of asking some searching questions here.\n14:31 Comment: Moutinho.\n14:32 Comment: We're at the shooting space.\n14:36 Comment: Well, there's that quick counter-attack again.\n14:37 Comment: You can't afford to give the ball away.\n14:39 Comment: Particularly if you're the last man like Pirlo is in that diamond formation that they play.\n14:44 Comment: You give the ball away, the opposition is straight into your back four.\n14:49 Comment: Mixed and match this season.\n14:50 Comment: Juventus, the diamond, the 4-3-3 and they've played a fair chunk of the season with a back three.\n14:57 Comment: Morata.\n15:2 Comment: Pereira beaten to it by Abdo Nour.\n15:5 Comment: Tunisia.\n15:10 Comment: Carrasco.\n15:14 Comment: Known in some quarters as Ferreira Carrasco, as it is on the UEFA team sheet.\n15:18 Comment: But he has to be referred to as Carrasco.\n15:22 Comment: It's his father's name.\n15:34 Comment: Max Allegri.\n15:37 Comment: Described by the Juventus players as much more of a tactician and a man-manager than his predecessor, Conte.\n15:44 Comment: Conte, who is very much in terms of his strength a motivator.\n15:57 Comment: Pirlo.\n16:2 Comment: That's a couple of stray balls in the space of minutes then.\n16:4 Comment: That's very unlike Pirlo.\n16:6 Comment: Derra gets an opportunity.\n16:8 Comment: Carrasco will have to retrieve here.\n16:14 Comment: Some of the home supporters more than a little bit restless.\n16:18 Comment: Guzawa.\n16:20 Comment: Useful looking cross.\n16:25 Comment: And well, an almighty inquest going on amongst the Juventus defenders.\n16:31 Comment: That's what happens if you give the ball away.\n16:34 Comment: Particularly in this Dijmo formation, if you give it away cheaply, then you're chasing 60, 70 yards back to your own goal.\n16:53 Comment: Radji had got to the far post and it was a decent headed opportunity for the Juventus defenders.\n16:59 Comment: Radji had got to the far post and it was a decent headed opportunity for Guzawa.\n17:6 Comment: Guzawa got in between defenders there and having done that really, you've got to fancy yourself to hit the target.\n17:10 Comment: Look.\n17:12 Comment: Maybe just going slightly back on himself, but he's climbed high enough for me.\n17:15 Comment: That's got to hit the target.\n17:20 Comment: Another major Monaco chance.\n17:29 Comment: Some needing to be reminded that Juventus are playing in black and white stripes.\n17:35 Comment: Certainly quiet in the crowd a little bit. There's a few murmurs of discontent going around.\n17:43 Comment: Dura beaten to it by Evra.\n17:45 Comment: Here's Vidal.\n17:47 Comment: Again, it's catching isn't it, this sloppiness.\n17:50 Comment: Gondogbia, Benucci.\n17:51 Comment: Authentically winning the first challenge.\n17:54 Comment: Hoping to...\n17:57 Comment: Rouse the rabble.\n18:5 Comment: Forward by Radji.\n18:10 Comment: Benucci and now Lichtsteiner.\n18:22 Comment: Puyolov.\n18:28 Comment: Chiellini.\n18:36 Comment: Well, after a bright start from Juve, they've kind of hit the buffers here, haven't they?\n18:41 Comment: A little bit uncertain.\n18:44 Comment: Sticking a bit of a rat.\n18:47 Comment: Marchisio.\n18:48 Comment: Marata.\n18:57 Comment: Monaco will certainly be more pleased with their work after 19 minutes in the Juventus stadium.\n19:2 Comment: This is Carrasco.\n19:5 Comment: Martial wants it.\n19:8 Comment: Martial has it.\n19:17 Comment: A bit of a shade risky, wasn't it?\n19:19 Comment: Pass back there from Evra, just a couple of yards.\n19:22 Comment: But I mean, Buffon, if any goalkeeper is super confident on the deck, is him, isn't it?\n19:26 Comment: Just plays out to his full backs all the time.\n19:29 Comment: Watch this, look. No panic from Buffon.\n19:31 Comment: I have it back.\n19:33 Comment: Control on the half-volley.\n19:35 Comment: There's complete confidence in your keeper.\n19:36 Comment: He just looked like he had a cigar in one hand and a glass of champagne in the other.\n19:41 Comment: He's been a great goalkeeper over the years, hasn't he?\n19:44 Comment: And I just think that he just exudes confidence.\n19:48 Comment: He's not finished yet. Wants to play in the next World Cup.\n19:51 Comment: He'll be 40 years of age.\n19:53 Comment: I wouldn't even say it's his performances, you know, saves and crosses that he comes out for that stands him apart.\n19:59 Comment: But it's the confidence that he exudes into a back four.\n20:7 Comment: We might have expected that scoreline, but the nature of the first 20 minutes has been something of a surprise and a very welcome one.\n20:16 Comment: Yeah, first 10 went to Juve and then Monaco have settled down and they got into their own sort of game and imposed it upon Juve.\n20:26 Comment: And at the moment, you can see they're starting to press a little bit higher up the pitch, which is significant.\n20:31 Comment: Early on, they were sitting back a little and just starting to press a little bit higher.\n20:46 Comment: Marquezio. Lichtsteiner.\n20:50 Comment: On for Morata.\n20:52 Comment: Abdonnoor.\n21:2 Comment: Pereira.\n21:5 Comment: A change out of Kozawa.\n21:21 Comment: Tough guys at the back for Juventus. Chiellini and Bonucci.\n21:27 Comment: It's a foul on Marquezio.\n21:28 Comment: Here's Chiellini.\n21:31 Comment: Tough guys, but you wouldn't mind leaving them on the ball.\n21:34 Comment: You know, you're better off picking up Pirlo and letting those two boys have it, Bonucci and Chiellini.\n21:39 Comment: They're not really going to hurt you with incisive passes between the lines.\n21:46 Comment: Marquezio.\n21:50 Comment: Pereira.\n21:53 Comment: Kozawa cool.\n21:55 Comment: Here's Di Rai.\n21:59 Comment: Good harrying. It's a gift, though, for Tevez.\n22:2 Comment: You can't afford to be giving him that kind of latitude.\n22:9 Comment: If he'd done so, he should have got his shot away there, Tevez.\n22:12 Comment: First time they've really nicked the ball off of Monaco in a deep situation.\n22:15 Comment: Evra.\n22:28 Comment: Chiellini.\n22:52 Comment: Chiellini's under that.\n22:59 Comment: Lost out there to Di Rai.\n23:3 Comment: A tigerish player, Arturo Vidal.\n23:9 Comment: Just getting back to what Allegri describes as top condition.\n23:12 Comment: Had that knee problem before the World Cup.\n23:15 Comment: Played in the World Cup. Probably against advice, but...\n23:19 Comment: He says he's put himself through the pain barrier plenty of times in the last year or so.\n23:28 Comment: Here's Bonucci.\n23:30 Comment: He's been a tough guy. He's not that long ago he was confronted by a gun-wielding robber in a car dealers.\n23:35 Comment: It was after his watch. All the robber got was a punch in the face.\n23:44 Comment: And she laid him out, I'm told.\n23:47 Comment: I don't know whether that's bravery or stupidity.\n23:54 Comment: Certainly fits the tough guy image.\n23:58 Comment: Licksteiner.\n24:8 Comment: There's no better shot of Monaco's shape here.\n24:10 Comment: You can see the shape, look how hard it is to break down.\n24:14 Comment: Licksteiner.\n24:18 Comment: Their organisation is impressive.\n24:22 Comment: Kuzawa.\n24:28 Comment: Pereira.\n24:33 Comment: Door shut by Radji.\n24:35 Comment: Help will be provided by Vidal.\n24:40 Comment: Not the best of strikes from Vidal.\n24:42 Comment: But great ball out to Pereira from...\n24:46 Comment: Pirlo, the first one. And that was the first time he's really...\n24:49 Comment: Hit a pass over 10-15 yards at his target.\n24:53 Comment: It looks like it's going to take a real good pass like that to break down this defence.\n24:59 Comment: Whose shape with the defence and the midfield in front of it is going to be very, very difficult to break down.\n25:5 Comment: Probably won't surprise you to learn that they do have the best defence in French football this season.\n25:12 Comment: French football well represented at the sharp end in the Champions League this season.\n25:19 Comment: With Paris Saint-Germain in action tomorrow.\n25:22 Comment: And the French team.\n25:28 Comment: Left for Tevez.\n25:31 Comment: Pereira trying to latch on to it.\n25:34 Comment: Carvalho finding himself under pressure.\n25:42 Comment: Evra.\n25:45 Comment: Tevez.\n25:47 Comment: And again.\n25:49 Comment: Marquizio.\n25:53 Comment: Now Pereira.\n25:55 Comment: They've upped the ante a little, Juve.\n25:57 Comment: Marquizio.\n25:59 Comment: Oh, a chance on here!\n26:1 Comment: And Tevez.\n26:3 Comment: A picture of disappointment.\n26:6 Comment: Well, if there's anyone you want a volley falling to on the far post with a technique like he has, it's Carlos Tevez.\n26:12 Comment: And that really was a poor volley.\n26:15 Comment: Just hit it into the ground.\n26:17 Comment: Straight at superstition. It was just an easy take.\n26:20 Comment: What a chance.\n26:22 Comment: Last time, really, he's been picked out in a spot like that.\n26:25 Comment: We've seen Morata earlier on missing a volley.\n26:27 Comment: But this one's easier.\n26:29 Comment: It's on his strong side, on his right foot.\n26:31 Comment: Look at this for a poor technique.\n26:33 Comment: Straight into the ground.\n26:35 Comment: Very, very unlike Carlos Tevez.\n26:37 Comment: Normally so sure in front of goal.\n26:40 Comment: Especially when he has to make those clean strikes.\n26:46 Comment: A few warning signs for Leonardo Jardim.\n26:53 Comment: That's Panucci.\n26:57 Comment: Tevez.\n27:1 Comment: Vidal.\n27:9 Comment: Moving outside him.\n27:11 Comment: This is Morata.\n27:13 Comment: Tevez.\n27:16 Comment: Licksteiner.\n27:19 Comment: Pirlo.\n27:23 Comment: Morata.\n27:25 Comment: Pereira.\n27:27 Comment: On for Licksteiner.\n27:29 Comment: Morata's gone near.\n27:31 Comment: Abdenoir sensed where the danger was.\n27:34 Comment: Better football using the full-back in the end as the whip, as we said,\n27:38 Comment: with that diamond system.\n27:40 Comment: Cross comes fizzing in, but again, very well defended.\n27:43 Comment: This time by Abdenoir, who got there on that near post.\n27:45 Comment: We do have\n27:47 Comment: interesting set-piece routine, which works for them sometimes with Panucci.\n27:52 Comment: Abdenoir\n27:54 Comment: beats the aforementioned to it.\n27:57 Comment: He just pulls off and they pull it back to the edge of the box and he\n28:0 Comment: smashes it in.\n28:2 Comment: I've seen them do that quite a few times.\n28:4 Comment: Center back with a goal threat.\n28:6 Comment: Pirlo's ball.\n28:8 Comment: Subashich's hands.\n28:11 Comment: And the ball is in.\n28:12 Comment: Subashich's hands.\n28:19 Comment: Here's the ball from Licksteiner.\n28:21 Comment: Here's the defending from Abdenoir.\n28:23 Comment: Not only that, but Cavallo's close behind him as well, so Morata's not\n28:27 Comment: got much of a chance of getting on to that one.\n28:34 Comment: Pereira.\n28:38 Comment: Kondopier got there first, but there's Everett.\n28:41 Comment: Pirlo\n28:43 Comment: is going to be penalised. Just giving it a beat there, the referee.\n28:49 Comment: Not the best of tacklers, Pirlo.\n28:51 Comment: Sometimes their strength can become their weakness because he's not the\n28:55 Comment: best defender at the base of that diamond.\n28:57 Comment: Great in possession,\n28:59 Comment: but not really going to do a lot for you in the defending sense.\n29:7 Comment: Morata.\n29:11 Comment: Short change Tevez, but it'll fall for Vidal.\n29:16 Comment: Morata should have really\n29:18 Comment: taken it on himself, or\n29:20 Comment: Fed Tevez, who he tried to do, but it went to\n29:25 Comment: Vidal, and he's tried a curler in the top corner and he's put it right over, but\n29:29 Comment: just a little bit hasty.\n29:32 Comment: Excellent against Dortmund when they had their chances.\n29:35 Comment: Morata and Tevez on the break like that, they always pick the final pass.\n29:38 Comment: Just a little bit hasty tonight.\n29:40 Comment: Understandable.\n29:48 Comment: Stakes rise, don't they, Dan?\n29:50 Comment: Every stage we get through.\n29:54 Comment: It's the top players who put those chances away and\n29:57 Comment: make those final passes as well.\n30:2 Comment: Better last ten minutes from Juventus.\n30:11 Comment: Such\n30:13 Comment: is the recognition for Monaco.\n30:15 Comment: Monaco's achievement in putting Arsenal out, but\n30:18 Comment: there's been some debate, at least\n30:20 Comment: in some quarters, about just who are the favourites\n30:23 Comment: this evening.\n30:27 Comment: There is huge pressure on the men in black and white.\n30:29 Comment: It's Marchisio's strike.\n30:32 Comment: They'd be happy for him to fire away from there.\n30:35 Comment: I'd like to see Marchisio and\n30:37 Comment: Vidal, who\n30:38 Comment: had a shot a couple of minutes earlier, but\n30:41 Comment: don't mind them having pops from that range.\n30:43 Comment: Just got to try and work the ball deeper into that penalty area\n30:45 Comment: and get their shots away.\n30:53 Comment: He's shirt like a second skin for\n30:56 Comment: Claudio Marchisio.\n31:0 Comment: He's been with the club since he was seven, barring a short\n31:3 Comment: loan spell at Empoli.\n31:5 Comment: He's given away\n31:6 Comment: a malaise of...\n31:9 Comment: Well, it's Carrasco who will hit it.\n31:12 Comment: More stem from\n31:14 Comment: cheap concession of possession again, which has been a problem\n31:16 Comment: tonight.\n31:18 Comment: I think Buffon's alerting them to that sloppy play.\n31:22 Comment: Carrasco\n31:24 Comment: pulls his shot wide, you can see there, but Buffon unhappy.\n31:32 Comment: I'm sure I'm not alerting\n31:34 Comment: any scouts, chairman or\n31:36 Comment: managers, but\n31:37 Comment: Buffon did say his one regret in his career is that he hasn't\n31:40 Comment: played in the Premier League.\n31:47 Comment: All the way there for Moutinho and here's Martial.\n31:51 Comment: Into traffic.\n31:53 Comment: Went the wrong way.\n31:54 Comment: He went into the traffic, rather than going on the outside there.\n31:57 Comment: He had a good chance.\n32:3 Comment: Abdonour's show of dissent has displeased the referee.\n32:13 Comment: Got sympathy for him there because I think Morata kind of made\n32:16 Comment: a back.\n32:17 Comment: Wasn't really going to go for the header, so Abdonour had to\n32:20 Comment: come over the top of him.\n32:21 Comment: It looked worse than what it was.\n32:33 Comment: Lichsteiner.\n32:37 Comment: Tangled there with Carrasco, the tug of the shirt penalised.\n32:42 Comment: Quickly on with it, Morata.\n32:48 Comment: Kondogbia brings it away.\n32:51 Comment: Carrasco.\n32:55 Comment: Not much in the way of support.\n33:4 Comment: Carrasco.\n33:6 Comment: Too keen to commit too many numbers.\n33:12 Comment: The mindset was summed up by Nabil Dera this afternoon.\n33:17 Comment: A few words for our French colleagues and said we'll be\n33:21 Comment: happy if it's Juventus 0 at the end.\n33:28 Comment: They've certainly shown it could be something different.\n33:33 Comment: Another end of the scoreline.\n33:43 Comment: Mind you, he also said he'd be willing to play in goal tonight.\n33:48 Comment: If it got him a place in the team, that was ever likely to\n33:50 Comment: happen.\n33:57 Comment: Tevez.\n33:59 Comment: That was unlucky, that final pass to Tevez was a little bit\n34:3 Comment: heavy there.\n34:5 Comment: Just trying to position themselves in the pockets.\n34:10 Comment: Just a matter of seeing that pass a little bit earlier.\n34:13 Comment: The top players can see that.\n34:15 Comment: The earlier you're past two in that position, the easier it is.\n34:18 Comment: Then you can turn and start getting out of back four.\n34:21 Comment: They haven't really passed the ball as well as they can do\n34:24 Comment: tonight, they haven't zipped it about like when they're at their\n34:27 Comment: best in this system that they play.\n34:29 Comment: They can get it into the feet and down the sides of central\n34:32 Comment: defenders really well, but haven't really hit their strats yet.\n34:42 Comment: Such is their dominance domestically.\n34:44 Comment: They've got a lot of players in the back.\n34:48 Comment: Such is their dominance domestically that it is now in\n34:51 Comment: this competition where really their season has to be measured.\n35:2 Comment: Eight finals in this competition.\n35:5 Comment: Including the European Cup era.\n35:8 Comment: Just the two victories though.\n35:18 Comment: They've got a lot of players in the back.\n35:34 Comment: Diderot may be into trouble.\n35:36 Comment: Vidal, Marquezio.\n35:38 Comment: Pielo.\n35:42 Comment: Schoen for Patryk Zebra.\n35:47 Comment: And Vidal, who is far able to win it back.\n35:49 Comment: Has played a couple of games at right back this season.\n35:52 Comment: The Monaco winger.\n35:54 Comment: Very early on in the season it must be said.\n35:58 Comment: Quite a while.\n36:3 Comment: Turned on there by Vidal.\n36:5 Comment: And proving very difficult to break down.\n36:7 Comment: They've got to pass this ball quicker.\n36:10 Comment: If they're going to break down this Monaco team.\n36:12 Comment: Very difficult.\n36:14 Comment: Marquezio.\n36:16 Comment: On for Lichtsteiner.\n36:18 Comment: Those passes and then the final one.\n36:20 Comment: You're trying to deliver into that last third.\n36:22 Comment: Goes astray and it's a waste.\n36:24 Comment: And it's a waste.\n36:40 Comment: I want to give them up Lichtsteiner was christened\n36:42 Comment: Forrest Gump by one of our\n36:44 Comment: Italian TV colleagues.\n36:46 Comment: Because he just runs forever.\n36:53 Comment: Tevez.\n36:57 Comment: Robbed by Condogbia.\n37:1 Comment: A free kick for his pains.\n37:4 Comment: Very clear indeed.\n37:12 Comment: I'm frustrated is his own inability to keep hold of the\n37:16 Comment: ball in that tight situation there.\n37:18 Comment: Tevez.\n37:20 Comment: Not seen the best of him yet tonight.\n37:24 Comment: Glorious opportunity on the volley.\n37:26 Comment: One you would expect him to put away no problems.\n37:32 Comment: Marquezio.\n37:34 Comment: There is Carvalho.\n37:39 Comment: Love a tackle.\n37:46 Comment: Marinho, disciple.\n37:48 Comment: Not always sweetness and light.\n37:50 Comment: That relationship I can recall.\n37:52 Comment: Some puppets have been\n37:59 Comment: A very good relationship I can recall.\n38:1 Comment: Some public criticism\n38:3 Comment: From his manager when he was left out at one stage.\n38:6 Comment: Chelsea.\n38:18 Comment: Tevez.\n38:21 Comment: Vidal.\n38:24 Comment: On for Lichtsteiner again.\n38:29 Comment: Orozco willing to do the dirty work as well and now we look for Marcial\n38:33 Comment: It's the plow alone for oh here up against Kealini\n38:37 Comment: Or when Marcial threatened to win the battle\n38:43 Comment: Marcial had to\n38:44 Comment: Beating the pace for Kealini there. I think he gets a little bit lucky you can see he's\n38:49 Comment: Desperate to try and not let him cut across him and there's a bit of a tangle\n38:54 Comment: I think he might be fortunate he got away with it\n38:56 Comment: Marcial's definitely got the beat in a place for it. This is Nick Steiner, Pereira\n39:4 Comment: Nick Steiner again\n39:10 Comment: Tevez\n39:13 Comment: Pereira will get there first and see off Kuzawa\n39:17 Comment: Beyond Nick Steiner, it's Evra coming in\n39:22 Comment: There are probably few players they'd want on the end of that, less\n39:26 Comment: Patrice Evra. He's blazed it over the top hasn't he? Just leant back on impact here\n39:31 Comment: It was a good opportunity for Evra\n39:34 Comment: Certainly hit the target\n39:35 Comment: You could see he's trying to get across him\n39:37 Comment: I don't think it was a foul\n39:38 Comment: But you could see he had the beat in the pace of him. Kealini's leaning into him. That's cute defending really\n39:48 Comment: If he knows he's got the beat in the pace for him all he's got to do is not get shoulder-to-shoulder with him\n39:53 Comment: Then you've got a problem. You've beaten him for pace, you've got to go a little bit wider around him\n40:0 Comment: Untidy though\n40:5 Comment: Vidal\n40:8 Comment: Here's Evra. He's not had the greatest goal-scoring record\n40:14 Comment: In his career, although strangely enough he began in Italian football as a striker or a winger\n40:20 Comment: A few lower division clubs, Marsala and Monza, famous for their sporting exploits\n40:33 Comment: Forgetting of course that he is playing against his former employers this evening\n40:38 Comment: Viratio with a great shot there on Fabinho\n41:1 Comment: De Roos\n41:8 Comment: Parfum by Vidal\n41:14 Comment: Morata\n41:19 Comment: Marquezio\n41:21 Comment: One of the Vidal's after that\n41:24 Comment: Tevez\n41:26 Comment: Pereira\n41:28 Comment: Get on the end of it. Derar did\n41:31 Comment: Under feverish pressure\n41:33 Comment: You have the perfect view of\n41:36 Comment: That scenario and Juve do get the decision\n41:45 Comment: Forward by Chiellini\n41:50 Comment: Morata trying to get it under his spell. Foul by Moutinho\n41:58 Comment: Untidy stage of the game\n42:0 Comment: You've I end up getting a foul from Morata, but there was a couple of niggly little challenges going in there\n42:30 Comment: Only one candidate here\n42:37 Comment: You think he's maybe a little bit too far out through one of these dipping shots, but you may have a go\n42:42 Comment: He let a clip it to the back\n42:44 Comment: It was Kuzawa's header. Vidal arriving with interest\n42:47 Comment: Tevez\n42:49 Comment: He's got it\n43:5 Comment: Stolen back by Carrasco, but not for long and\n43:8 Comment: We're going to set up a bit of a base camp here Juve. Vidal\n43:12 Comment: As we close in on the break the Juventus Stadium the first leg of this Champions League quarterfinal\n43:25 Comment: Licksteiner the Swiss\n43:27 Comment: Tevez on for Licksteiner again, Kozawa tidies up Carrasco\n43:35 Comment: trying to find a way out but only presented it to Vidal\n43:41 Comment: Good choice of pass but he's over it again, they're just getting a little bit anxious in those final passes\n43:45 Comment: because Morata had peeled off very well there but\n43:49 Comment: Vidal was a bit heavy with the pass again\n43:57 Comment: Pelo\n44:10 Comment: Markizio\n44:18 Comment: Subasic\n44:20 Comment: Number one for club and country, Croatia\n44:22 Comment: Tevez, beautiful ball for Vidal, this is the moment\n44:32 Comment: In the end Vidal's reaction tells the story\n44:36 Comment: Another huge chance\n44:38 Comment: Great ball from Tevez outside of the foot, Vidal takes the first touch well\n44:42 Comment: Couldn't be better but leans back on impact, look there you see\n44:45 Comment: He's trying to curl it for that far corner but just leans back on impact and that's over the top\n44:50 Comment: Great ball from Carlos Tevez, great spot on the outside of his foot\n44:54 Comment: First touch was superb Vidal but the second, well he knows he should have scored\n\nSecond Half:\n0:31 Comment: Just going forward, Vidal just missed one in that inside left position\n0:35 Comment: for a great outside of the football from Tevez, but on the other hand, there was enough going the other way,\n0:40 Comment: midway through that half for Monaco, particularly the Carrasco chance,\n0:44 Comment: which should keep Juve on their toes, because it's going to be a close one, this one.\n0:51 Comment: And certainly the pitch in the second leg is certainly not going to be as lovely as this one.\n1:0 Comment: Here's Chiellini.\n1:10 Comment: Bonucci. Lichtstein.\n1:16 Comment: That's what I was showing for it, was quick to intercept.\n1:24 Comment: What do you think Allegri's halftime thoughts would have been, Tony?\n1:28 Comment: More on patience and keeping the ball better in possession and moving it quicker, I think.\n1:34 Comment: Every time they've moved it quickly, they've looked like they can cut Monaco open.\n1:38 Comment: So the passing and the incisiveness of passing, I think he would have emphasised.\n1:45 Comment: And be careful on the break in particular with Martial, you know, just leaving themselves maybe two on two now and again.\n1:51 Comment: But pleased.\n1:57 Comment: Dirac. Bonucci has to get that right.\n2:6 Comment: It pops up a little bit awkwardly, that's why he had to deal with it like that.\n2:11 Comment: Sometimes you're better off stooping to head those ones away.\n2:17 Comment: Conceded a corner, Kagawa had a free header in the first half.\n2:21 Comment: Kagawa, sorry, had a free header, came up from the corner after watching there.\n2:25 Comment: You can see there he is, the three, got in between defenders.\n2:29 Comment: Maybe too busy watching other players.\n2:34 Comment: Familiar presence of Carvalho as well.\n2:37 Comment: Kondogbia's gone to the near. Carvalho's coming in and Raci as well.\n2:52 Comment: He's got his head to it, hard to keep it down when you're having your shirt tugged at the same time.\n2:57 Comment: But just part and parcel of corner kicks in the Champions League this season.\n3:6 Comment: A little touch of concern against Dirac who's down.\n3:9 Comment: Well he was last to come out, wasn't he, in the first half.\n3:12 Comment: You see him limping a little bit as he was coming out the tunnel.\n3:15 Comment: Maybe this is just a problem reoccurring.\n3:22 Comment: Well they've had a couple of injury scares coming into this game.\n3:30 Comment: Might go like for like here, bring on a quick, pacey winger who works terrifically hard.\n3:36 Comment: Might bring Berbatov on.\n3:41 Comment: I can see Bernhard Silva, I'm sorry to disappoint you Tony,\n3:45 Comment: but Bernhard Silva getting ready for a quick entrance.\n3:53 Comment: Berbatov may have a part to play but it'll never be that one.\n3:58 Comment: Funnily enough I remember their season together at Manchester United\n4:4 Comment: and some of the statistics suggested that Berbatov actually covered more ground in an average game than Tevez did,\n4:10 Comment: which certainly surprised me.\n4:16 Comment: Here's Zevre, now Vidal.\n4:21 Comment: Tevez, Vidal.\n4:27 Comment: Good strike but never really going to give Subhasich a problem, especially at that height.\n4:33 Comment: Straight down the barrel really, easy pickings.\n4:36 Comment: Martinho, here's Martial.\n4:43 Comment: Kicked off there by Patrick Severett.\n4:51 Comment: Morata.\n4:55 Comment: Going at them with real purpose here but Abdonour shuts the door.\n5:0 Comment: Chiao's thought as he got to the last defender, Abdonour, he maybe could have gone across him to the right-hand side but...\n5:7 Comment: Again, good driving run from Morata and good defending from the last defender, Abdonour.\n5:18 Comment: Little change.\n5:20 Comment: Can be made.\n5:26 Comment: Leonardo Silva.\n5:29 Comment: He made his debut for Portugal.\n5:31 Comment: Benucci coming in.\n5:36 Comment: Alarm bells ringing for Monaco.\n5:42 Comment: And it's a goal.\n5:44 Comment: Alarm bells ringing for Monaco.\n5:52 Comment: Buffon's gone a-wandering. He is the coolest man in Turin.\n5:57 Comment: He's the best outfield player, isn't he? He's remarkably calm, isn't he, Buffon?\n6:1 Comment: That was a good opportunity for Chiellini, he was going to get a touch on that near post and indeed when he missed it, Tevez on the far.\n6:14 Comment: Piela.\n6:18 Comment: Here's Benucci.\n6:28 Comment: Tevez.\n6:36 Comment: Pereira. Great work.\n6:43 Comment: Kondogbia away.\n6:47 Comment: Chiellini making that his. Lichtsteiner.\n6:52 Comment: Here's Kuzawa.\n6:55 Comment: Squeeze applied by Arturo Vidal, more than that, but...\n6:59 Comment: Nothing wrong with the challenge. Here's Vidal again.\n7:3 Comment: Tevez.\n7:6 Comment: Piela.\n7:8 Comment: Pereira.\n7:10 Comment: And the substitute Silva getting a very important challenge in, in the end.\n7:15 Comment: Well, it looks like the more inspirational team talk may have been Allegri's at half-time, they've come out of the blocks, haven't they, Juve?\n7:21 Comment: They need to keep this little bit of pace and possession up.\n7:24 Comment: Just trying to lure a little bit too much and not getting their shots away on target there.\n7:28 Comment: A couple of good opportunities, but...\n7:32 Comment: They put and they score when they have this domination.\n7:34 Comment: Tevez gets there first, but Abdonur with another very important challenge.\n7:47 Comment: Last touch came off of Tevez there. Abdonur got a touch onto Tevez and away for a goal kick.\n7:55 Comment: They'll be screaming if this one goes in.\n8:2 Comment: Subasic, justice.\n8:5 Comment: Ensuring that there are no hard luck stories, not about that anyway.\n8:8 Comment: This is really promising, it's Carrasco, and Silva has an opportunity here.\n8:16 Comment: Buffon making sure, always had it covered.\n8:20 Comment: Oh, great throw out, wasn't it?\n8:22 Comment: The keeper, Subasic, Carrasco sets up Silva, this has got to go across the keeper.\n8:27 Comment: You're never, ever going to beat him on that near post.\n8:29 Comment: Never, ever. Has to go across him.\n8:32 Comment: Great opportunity wasted.\n8:34 Comment: But a threat on the counter.\n8:37 Comment: Very evident again. What have they got from this set piece?\n8:43 Comment: Oh, and some attempted acrobatics from Martial, who feels desperately that they should have a corner.\n8:52 Comment: I think that was actually going in the side netting, but Buffon made sure.\n8:58 Comment: But had to go across him. What an opportunity.\n9:2 Comment: Again on the break, that's why it's making for a good game.\n9:11 Comment: Great example for all goalies, when you've caught a ball from a corner, you are the first line of attack.\n9:16 Comment: Great throw out it was to Carrasco.\n9:19 Comment: One of the best passes of the game, if you like.\n9:22 Comment: That was a throw out, a super throw out, right to his feet.\n9:27 Comment: It can be as good as any pass.\n9:31 Comment: Pirlo, the pass master, looking for Morata.\n9:34 Comment: And Carvalho, with the protests of a guilty man.\n9:41 Comment: I thought it was a foul, I must admit. It was a great ball from Pirlo.\n9:46 Comment: Was it inside, was it outside the area, was it denying a goal scoring opportunity?\n9:50 Comment: Has he given a foul? I think the referee is a little bit unclear.\n9:54 Comment: At the moment, yellow card, Carvalho gets away with it.\n9:58 Comment: Great ball from Pirlo, the first ball that he's looked to hit over the top of the two centre-backs.\n10:5 Comment: There you go, he's onside.\n10:7 Comment: Across comes Carvalho, he's clipped his heels. It's a foul.\n10:11 Comment: He may not have intentionally done it, but he's clipped his heels.\n10:13 Comment: Is he denying a goal scoring opportunity? To me, yes.\n10:17 Comment: Morata is just about to bring that down.\n10:19 Comment: Maybe the attentions of Abdelnaour saved him there, coming back on it.\n10:24 Comment: But he's indefinitely in front of him.\n10:29 Comment: Well, Jardim, a touch Rufo, but Vidal has claimed this one.\n10:38 Comment: Crucial moment in the tie.\n10:40 Comment: He scored from the penalty spot against Chiesaena earlier this season.\n10:45 Comment: And in the heat of a tour in Derby against Torino.\n10:50 Comment: I've got to give credit, I think, for the ball from Pirlo, Dan.\n10:52 Comment: It was a great ball. Those are the ones, if you are slightly out of position,\n10:56 Comment: and he's got time on the ball, he'll find you out of position and he'll find that pass.\n11:0 Comment: It was a great ball.\n11:2 Comment: Subhasich, for his part, has produced two penalty saves in the French League this season.\n11:10 Comment: Crucial moment in this quarterfinal.\n11:26 Comment: Juventus take charge.\n11:30 Comment: An emphatic penalty from Arturo Vidal.\n11:35 Comment: And they rejoice at the breakthrough.\n11:37 Comment: Well, great description, Dan. Emphatic, and it was.\n11:40 Comment: Because if he goes the right way, he's not saving this one.\n11:43 Comment: Subhasich, Vidal, he's gone high and he's gone wide.\n11:48 Comment: No keeper can go across and at that height.\n11:51 Comment: Look at that, there's no saving that if you go the right way.\n11:54 Comment: Super confidence and a great finish.\n11:59 Comment: Try and save it when he's going that high.\n12:8 Comment: Confidence is the word and it abounds for Arturo Vidal.\n12:12 Comment: Fully fit and in terms of his form, he's flying.\n12:17 Comment: And what a crucial moment.\n12:37 Comment: Can Dogbia hassle it off by Marata?\n12:44 Comment: Vidal, Evra.\n12:49 Comment: Some wondered whether or not Pirlo was quite ready for the fight.\n12:54 Comment: But that pull has showed that if it is any kind of gamble,\n12:58 Comment: and he has been on the border of fitness for a week or two,\n13:1 Comment: then it certainly paid off.\n13:3 Comment: Well, you only need one ball, Dan, and he's hit two tonight.\n13:7 Comment: One from Marata earlier on, on the volley.\n13:9 Comment: Great ball. And that one there.\n13:11 Comment: Spotted that they were a yard out of position, the centre-backs,\n13:14 Comment: picked the pass.\n13:17 Comment: An extra spring in the step, but...\n13:20 Comment: ...locked in Marquinhos there.\n13:23 Comment: It's important now that Monaco stand firm,\n13:27 Comment: that they keep their heads, because...\n13:32 Comment: ...any offensives get in the mood.\n13:35 Comment: Just any kids watching the game of football now, Dan,\n13:38 Comment: just thinking about being athletes, having body beautifuls and everything,\n13:42 Comment: just watching for his passing ability, Pirlo,\n13:44 Comment: that there's still room for football.\n13:46 Comment: There's still room for him to be a bit more aggressive.\n13:49 Comment: Passing ability, Pirlo, that there's still room for footballers.\n13:53 Comment: Always will be. Passes of the ball, few and far between now.\n13:56 Comment: They were just two or three in every team,\n13:59 Comment: but now the way Pirlo plays,\n14:2 Comment: they're becoming a little bit extinct, players like Pirlo.\n14:5 Comment: But just watch.\n14:7 Comment: If you've got time, don't go down to the gym.\n14:10 Comment: When you're a professional footballer,\n14:12 Comment: just spend a little bit of time passing the ball.\n14:15 Comment: A little bit more time passing the ball.\n14:17 Comment: If you've become half as good as him, you'll be good,\n14:20 Comment: because what a passer the boy is.\n14:24 Comment: In the days of athletes in football at the moment,\n14:27 Comment: no-one ever replaces a passer.\n14:48 Comment: Kozawa.\n14:50 Comment: Carrasco.\n14:53 Comment: Kozawa.\n15:3 Comment: What would be the Monaco message now?\n15:7 Comment: They can't change. They can't change the way they play.\n15:9 Comment: They can't come out and all of a sudden start going at you.\n15:13 Comment: This is...\n15:15 Comment: One-nil's not bad, is it?\n15:17 Comment: It's a different proposition on their pitch.\n15:19 Comment: We've mentioned it before.\n15:20 Comment: Bubbly pitch.\n15:23 Comment: A car park, if you like.\n15:25 Comment: It used to be a car park.\n15:27 Comment: But it's not the best of surfaces,\n15:29 Comment: and they're used to playing on it.\n15:32 Comment: I thought Juventus played better in the away leg\n15:35 Comment: against Dortmund than they did at home.\n15:37 Comment: So, still going to be an interesting tie.\n15:40 Comment: You wouldn't want Juve to run away a bit, though.\n15:42 Comment: You want to keep it honest, keep it nice and keen\n15:46 Comment: for us viewing the second leg.\n15:48 Comment: In eight days' time.\n15:51 Comment: In the Principality.\n15:54 Comment: One thing's for sure, after what they've been through\n15:56 Comment: in the knockout stages so far,\n15:58 Comment: no-one is going to write them off.\n16:1 Comment: They were in many quarters ahead of the tie with Arsenal.\n16:3 Comment: Indeed, they used an article from the Daily Mail, no less,\n16:7 Comment: as a motivational tool in the dressing room\n16:9 Comment: before that game at the Emirates.\n16:11 Comment: Here's what they think of us, lads. You show them.\n16:16 Comment: Here's Silva.\n16:22 Comment: Fabinho.\n16:23 Comment: I think there's a chance he had just before that, Silva, as well.\n16:27 Comment: I wonder if he'd be ruining this

Morata, you don't see that in many textbooks.\n18:48 Comment: There's the ball over the top, there's the clip.\n18:56 Comment: Very, very close to being just outside, wasn't it?\n19:0 Comment: But this is an emphatic, as you described it, penalty.\n19:3 Comment: Top corner, no stopping those.\n19:8 Comment: Claiming it was outside, it was very, very close.\n19:14 Comment: What a ball, what a ball.\n19:16 Comment: And what a penalty, because you have to be, you said it,\n19:19 Comment: you have to be confident, because it can so easily go wrong.\n19:23 Comment: I thought Scherer was the best of those\n19:25 Comment: when he was hitting it across the goalkeeper.\n19:27 Comment: He hits it with power, pace.\n19:30 Comment: Hits it with a bit of, like, curving away as well,\n19:33 Comment: but he hits it high, more importantly.\n19:35 Comment: When a keeper went that way, they can't go across and high.\n19:38 Comment: Could have some confidence to do it, though.\n19:44 Comment:

There's the clip there.\n20:28 Comment: I thought the first one was just outside.\n20:30 Comment: If you have a look at it again, it was just there.\n20:33 Comment: There's the clip.\n20:34 Comment: Yes, just maybe, just outside.\n20:38 Comment: But because he's fallen quite a way in,\n20:40 Comment: and of course the referee and the assistant have given it,\n20:45 Comment: but what a close call.\n20:48 Comment: And at a pace, it's very, very difficult.\n20:50 Comment: Obviously, we've had that slowed down.\n20:52 Comment: But when it's at a pace, it's very difficult.\n20:58 Comment: I

his day, a joy to watch.\n27:13 Comment: The game is very much played on his terms there, isn't it?\n27:15 Comment: Great touch. He's got a brilliant touch.\n27:17 Comment: Some of the things he was doing over here with Spurs, Man United and Fulham.\n27:22 Comment: Many a time at the commentary point, sort of drooling over some of the touches when he just pulls them out of the sky.\n27:27 Comment: That's his party piece on the instep.\n27:30 Comment: Pulls them out of the sky, kills them stone dead.\n27:33 Comment: Important to have the legs around him, though, to make the most of that talent that he's got.\n27:39 Comment: Nice shot.\n27:42 Comment: And you've got to put up with his antics when you don't give him the ball.\n27:50 Comment: Not slow to point it out.\n27:53 Comment: He did reveal a t-shirt once.\n27:55 Comment: Fulham keep calm and pass me the ball, wasn't he?\n27:57 Comment: Yeah, I don't think that went down too well in the dressing room.\n28:1 Comment: It was Pirlo.\n28:2 Comment: Tevez.\n28:3 Comment: The other lads had t-shirts saying, liven up and run about at times.\n28:9 Comment: You knew he could get this.\n28:12 Comment: Carvalho is the skipper.\n28:14 Comment: Since Radji's departure.\n28:22 Comment: Flipped out of play.\n28:32 Comment: Well, we've been graced by the presence of greatness for 73 minutes.\n28:43 Comment: And another who's returned from the treatment room, Andrea Barzagli, will come on.\n28:47 Comment: And that should herald a change of shape.\n28:53 Comment: Central defender.\n28:56 Comment: Barzagli, Bonucci and Chiellini have been probably the foremost exponents of a back three in football in recent years.\n29:4 Comment: This is Ebret.\n29:7 Comment: Suggesting that Lebre is thinking one's enough.\n29:11 Comment: If they come on to us in the second leg, we've got the ability to hit them on the break.\n29:15 Comment: Because they've got to come and score a goal.\n29:21 Comment: Cat and mouse going on.\n29:25 Comment: You see the Uwe coach and current national team coach Antonio Conte looking on with interest.\n29:31 Comment: Andrea Pirlo, still

Comment: I think the team needs to know what they want to do at this stage.\n32:19 Comment: Whether Juve want to pass on for another goal or Monaco want to try and get that away goal and go for it.\n32:27 Comment: Just seem a little bit stuck at the moment between the two.\n32:30 Comment: Both teams are just a little bit unsure whether to push on.\n32:35 Comment: History would suggest they will need more than one Juventus.\n32:39 Comment: They have never won a Champions League or European Cup match in France.\n32:43 Comment: They've lost every single one they have played.\n32:48

appetite for the game.\n33:29 Comment: Sometimes not the most graceful or technical but his appetite, sheer appetite for the game and hunger for the work is just infectious within the team, isn't it?\n33:39 Comment: In Chile he's known as the warrior and you can see why.\n33:41 Comment: He gets the crowd going as well.\n33:44 Comment: Here's Vidal again.\n33:46 Comment: Licksteiner.\n33:48

Comment: Look, you've got to get across him.\n34:6 Comment: You've got to get in there.\n34:8 Comment: Fabinho's kind of just waiting on it.\n34:10 Comment: He just didn't attack the ball himself.\n34:13 Comment: Trying to silver platter that, isn't it?\n34:15 Comment: Really is.\n34:20 Comment: Abdonald taking care of Bonucci.\n34:29 Comment: Trying that corner with him that always seems to work.\n34:32 Comment: Marchisio.\n34:37 Comment: Pass forward by Bazali to Tevez.\n34:42 Comment: Around the corner Vidal will get after this with his second favourite.\n34:49 Comment: Stop him giving it everything.\n34:51 Comment: He'll run anything down, won't he?\n34:56 Comment: He looks like a warrior as well, doesn't he?\n35:0 Comment: The warrior's got to be a bit more aggressive.\n35:2 Comment: He looks like a warrior as well, doesn't he?\n35:5 Comment: He's got the war paint on.\n35:12 Comment: Moutinho.\n35:17 Comment: Here's Kuzawa.\n35:19 Comment: Carrasco.\n35:22 Comment: There are moments you look back on in matches.\n35:25 Comment: Carrasco's chance in the first half.\n35:27 Comment: Silva's chance in the second half.\n35:28 Comment: Kuzawa's header from a set piece in the first half as well.\n35:37 Comment: If, is a big word in football.\n35:41 Comment: Some good half chances for Monaco.\n35:43 Comment: But you have to say, Juve have had the better chances.\n35:46 Comment: Vidal, Morata, Tevez.\n35:49 Comment: They had really good chances that they didn't convert.\n35:55 Comment: The scoreline's about right at the moment.\n35:59 Comment: It's not often that you say that in football either.\n36:3 Comment: Buffon under sufficient pressure there to only find touch.\n36:6 Comment: We've seen how cool he can be with

one of his better games.\n37:11 Comment: I think the second leg might suit him a little bit more if Monaco come on.\n37:14 Comment: And he's got that little bit of a pace to get him behind on the breakaways.\n37:18 Comment: Looks like he's feeling a little bit of an injury there.\n37:24 Comment: Matri straight into the action.\n37:25 Comment: Scored a very important goal in the Coppa Italia last week in Florence.\n37:30 Comment: Chavez wanted to take charge in that situation.\n37:34 Comment: Hidalgo looking to give Abdonal nowhere to go.\n37:35 Comment: But he did well.\n37:36 Comment:

Martial has stolen it back.\n37:54 Comment: Well, they're not finished yet, Monaco.\n37:57 Comment: He dumped him over the hoardings there with that little shoulder barge.\n38:2 Comment: Choose your enemies with greater care, I would suggest, Monsieur Martial.\n38:6 Comment: Monsieur Martial.\n38:15 Comment: Kondogbia.\n38:31 Comment: Don't want it back.\n38:32 Comment: Surprise, surprise.\n38:33 Comment: Here's Pereira.\n38:37 Comment: Advantage played and a good one.\n38:41 Comment: Looking for Chavez.\n38:43 Comment: Coppa Italia was looking for a flag.\n38:46 Comment: Chavez played Carlos Chavez.\n38:47 Comment: He knows if he hits that across, there's no one in there.\n38:50 Comment: So he's just either playing for a nutmeg or a deflection to keep the ball at that end of the corner.\n38:56 Comment: I think the way that they played this last little stage of the game, they're happy with a 1-0.\n39:2 Comment: A little debate about whether there was an offside there once the advantage had been played.\n39:19 Comment: Three certainly with the right idea.\n39:23 Comment: Eichstain is attacking this.\n39:25 Comment: Into it.\n39:28 Comment: By Abdenour.\n39:30 Comment: That was Barzagli's ball for Tevez.\n39:33 Comment: On for Vidal.\n39:36 Comment: Abdenour there in time.\n39:39 Comment: Well, it's in the gist of Vidal's complaint there.\n39:43 Comment: I wonder if there's any credence behind it.\n39:45 Comment: Great little ball from Tevez.\n39:51 Comment: No, that's off the knee.\n40:0 Comment: Dimitri with the spin.\n40:3 Comment: Pereira.\n40:7 Comment:

    "summary": "In the high-stakes UEFA Champions League quarter-final, Juventus faced off against Monaco at the Juventus Stadium, Turin. The match, highly anticipated by fans and pundits alike, promised a fascinating clash of styles, with Juventus' disciplined defense and tactical nous up against Monaco's dynamic counter-attacking prowess. The match unfolded across two intense halves, replete with tactical battles, near-misses, and a decisive strike that settled the contest.\n\n### **First Half:**\n\nThe game began with an air of anticipation, both teams fully aware of the opportunity to advance in the prestigious tournament. As the clock ticked, Juventus immediately announced their intentions with a quick shift to the front foot. Alvaro Morata looked to create early pressure, battling against Monaco's Andrea Raggi and Ricardo Carvalho, but it was evident from early exchanges that Monaco‚Äôs defense was well-organized and not to be underestimated.\n\nThe early stages saw Juventus showing positive intent. Carlos Tevez and Morata, who had been devastating against Borussia Dortmund in the previous round, seemed keen to rekindle that form. However, they soon realized Monaco was not giving them the space behind the defense they had exploited so effectively against Dortmund. Instead, the game required them to adapt to receiving the ball to feet and link-up play.\n\nMonaco, wearing their change strip, executed their counter-attacking strategy to fine measure. Yannick Ferreira Carrasco, recently having made his debut for Belgium, along with Anthony Martial, presented immediate threats on the flanks. Martial, often compared to French legend Thierry Henry, exhibited his characteristic style, playing wide and cutting inside onto his right, causing the Juventus defense some early headaches.\n\nThe Juve midfield, orchestrated by Andrea Pirlo, sought to dominate possession. Claudio Marchisio, Patrice Evra, and Arturo Vidal provided support, constantly interchanging positions and seeking to penetrate the compact Monaco defense. At one stage, Pirlo found Morata in space, his well-timed run escaping the attentions of Monaco's back four, but the chance went begging as the flag stayed down and the final effort failed to trouble the goal. \n\nCarlos Tevez, central to Juventus‚Äô attacking movement, conjured an impressive strike from just outside the area, only to be matched by a sharp save from Danijel Subasic, Monaco's croatian goalkeeper. Subasic‚Äôs dive low to his right demonstrated the kind of form that had seen him become a cornerstone of Monaco‚Äôs resilient defense, arguably the best in French football this season.\n\nJuventus' defensive solidity was tested by Monaco's swift counter-attacks. Martial and Carrasco were repeatedly fed by Geoffrey Kondogbia and Jo√£o Moutinho, who, with their combination of physicality and finesse, carved openings. Notably, Carrasco found space following some intricate play with Martial, only for Gianluigi Buffon to pull off a top-drawer save, solidifying his moniker as one of the game's greatest custodians.\n\nDespite early control, Juventus displayed occasional hesitation, highlighted by a series of uncharacteristic misplaced passes from Pirlo. The seasoned maestro, crucial to Juve's tactical framework, faced a spell of uncommon inconsistency in possession, allowing Monaco to gain intermittent control and create half-chances. \n\nYet, the first half ended goalless, with both teams ruing missed opportunities. While Juventus had showcased moments of attacking flair, Monaco had demonstrated plenty of threat on the counter, reminding everyone why they were no pushovers in this elite competition. Both defensive units were largely successful in stifling the opposing threats, setting the stage for a gripping second half.\n\n### **Second Half:**\n\nThe second half began with the same energy and tactical discipline both teams exhibited in the first. Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri would have asked for more patience and precision in possession, urging his team to maintain high pressing and capitalize on Monaco's defensive errors. Meanwhile, Leonardo Jardim stressed the importance of holding the defensive line and capitalizing on the counter when possible.\n\nMonaco immediately faced a setback as Nabil Dirar suffered an injury, paving the way for Bernardo Silva to step into the action. Juventus saw this as an opportunity to press further, and it wasn‚Äôt long before they enforced their dominance with swift, incisive passing. \n\nIn the 9th minute of the second half, an intelligently clipped ball over the top from Pirlo found Morata, who was brought down by Ricardo Carvalho as he was closing in on goal. The referee awarded a penalty after a moment of deliberation. Arturo Vidal took responsibility, and, with supreme confidence, sent Subasic the wrong way with an emphatic strike into the top corner, giving Juventus a much-deserved lead.\n\nThe breakthrough invigorated Juventus, who sought to press their advantage. Vidal, already instrumental in midfield, was relentless in his endeavor. His contagious energy and battling displays highlighted why he was known as ‚Äòthe warrior‚Äô back in Chile. Juventus continued to push, with Evra and Lichtsteiner providing width, while Tevez and Morata tried to exploit any spaces in Monaco‚Äôs back line. \n\nMonaco, though behind, did not buckle under pressure. They continued to pose significant threats on the break. Carrasco and Silva, with their direct running and flair, with deeply positioned Martial, made darting runs causing problems for Juventus' defense. It was evident every time they made forays that Buffon had to stay alert, just as he did when Silva had an opportunity but could not beat him at his near post. \n\nIn response, Allegri changed Juventus‚Äô shape, bringing on Andrea Barzagli to form a back three with Bonucci and Chiellini, a formation that had served Juventus well throughout the season. This tactical tweak ensured defensive solidity as they sought to see out the game with their slender lead.\n\nAs the clock ticked, Monaco looked to their bench seeking inspiration, introducing Dimitar Berbatov. Immediately, the Bulgarian striker, known for his deft touch and creative playing style, provided a focal point. On one occasion, he rose above Juventus‚Äô defense for a glancing header that narrowly missed the target ‚Äì a clear reminder of his enduring quality.\n\nDespite Monaco‚Äôs best efforts, including ventures forward and some late intense pressing, Juventus held firm. Every probing run by Monaco was met with disciplined defending by Juventus, particularly from Bonucci and Chiellini. Even as Juve defended deeper, they remained potent on the counter, guided by Tevez‚Äôs elusiveness and Vidal‚Äôs unyielding energy.\n\nThe final stages saw a persistent Juventus negate further Monaco threats, ensuring they carried their slender lead back to the principality. Alessandro Matri replaced Morata, and Stefano Sturaro came on for Pereira, further solidifying the structure and tiring Monaco attackers.\n\nThe match ended 1-0 in favour of Juventus. This victory was testament to their tactical discipline, individual brilliance, and an unwavering defense marshaled by Buffon‚Äôs experience and leadership. Vidal‚Äôs penalty had given them the edge they needed, but it was their collective performance that secured the crucial first-leg lead.\n\nMonaco, while leaving Turin defeated, had shown enough quality and resilience to believe the tie was far from over. Given their performances, particularly in the counter-attacks and their ability to press Juventus' defense, the return leg promised to be just as enthralling.\n\nThe Juventus faithful left the stadium buoyant, recognizing the team's effort against a youthful, energetic Monaco side. The game had underlined the fine margins that define success at this level, setting up an enticing second-leg encounter in Monaco."
