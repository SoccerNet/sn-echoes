role the last couple of months.\n5:56 Comment: That's my only concern about the start in honour.\n5:59 Comment: The fact that if Ramsey was playing in there alongside Coquelin\n6:2 Comment: and Cazorla had been more of a 10,\n6:3 Comment: I think he's been exceptional there the last couple of months for Arsenal.\n6:9 Comment: Have you left Ozil out at the starting XI?\n6:11 Comment: Yeah, I would have done, I would have played Ramsey.\n6:14 Comment: Aaron Ramsey's always liable to get a goal for you.\n6:16 Comment: It's that sort of night, you need someone now.\n6:18 Comment: Listen, Mesut Ozil more than capable.\n6:20 Comment: If he's up for it, if he's on it, he gets involved.\n6:29 Comment: It just would have freed Cazorla up a little bit\n6:32 Comment: and I just think he's their best number 10.\n6:34 Comment: All the array of talent they've got when he plays in that little pocket,\n6:37 Comment: I think he's better than any of the other guys.\n6:40 Comment: I see Sanchez just unable to hold on to the ball.\n6:54 Comment: Nantesaka not taking any chances.\n6:57 Comment: David Ospina, the Arsenal goalkeeper,\n6:59 Comment: knows this part of the Cote

Comment: than...\n7:29 Comment: Martial who shielded the ball well with his body\n7:31 Comment: and drew the foul.\n7:33 Comment: He's never getting there, Copeland, not that one.\n7:37 Comment: You're right, Martial just steps across a little bit.\n7:39 Comment: He's very aware of the fact that Copeland's going to come flying in.\n7:42 Comment: Just puts his body in the way.\n7:44 Comment: You say draws the foul,\n7:45 Comment: but it's been a confident start for Monaco.\n7:47 Comment: No signs of them wanting to sit and hang on to what they had.\n7:51 Comment: Committing people forward.\n7:53 Comment: They've started bright.\n7:59 Comment: Rooney rows forward to do that,\n8:1 Comment: Rooney, Rooney, Rooney.\n8:4 Comment: acha!\n8:5 Comment: Rooney, Rooney, Rooney.\n8:7

Rooney, Rooney...\n8:27 Comment: Artem the Greek was\n8:27 Comment: torquing in his pre-match.\n8:28 Comment: Rooney, Rooney, Rooney...\n8:29 Comment: interview about the tempo of the Arsenal performance.\n8:35 Comment: They actually played quite brightly for five or ten minutes of the first game,\n8:38 Comment: but then that tempo dropped, the speed of the passing dropped,\n8:44 Comment: and Monaco started to make themselves at home in the game.\n8:52 Comment: You can see how Nick has asked a lot of Monreal.\n8:59 Comment: Protected by Fabinho.\n9:24 Comment: A little news from Castellani, I'm sure Desacro and Ospina will sort it out.\n9:29 Comment: But it's a bit of a surprise.\n9:30 Comment: We're going to see a bit of a surprise from the manager of BVB,\n9:33 Comment: who is in front of Giroud.\n9:34 Comment: Bellerin with the header forward, but that's a little too strong.\n9:38 Comment: Daniel Subasic, the Croatian number one, is the Monaco goalkeeper.\n9:52 Comment: Effortless control from Berbatov.\n9:56 Comment: The best of passes.\n9:58 Comment: And it's a goal from the manager of BVB.\n10:8 Comment: Ten minutes gone and no reeling roads yet from Arsenal.\n10:11 Comment: Really managed to get hold of the ball and have a sustained little spell\n10:17 Comment: where they're knocking it about and keeping it and finding Mesut Ozil.\n10:20 Comment: Getting him on the half-turn where he can perhaps just run off the back of Kondogba\n10:23 Comment: and maybe look to link up with Giroud or Sanchez-Wilbeck.\n10:28 Comment: Monaco's defensive stubbornness has been well chronicled.\n10:31 Comment: Least goals conceded in the French League,\n10:34 Comment: least goals conceded in the Champions League this season.\n10:38 Comment: Nobody's scored three goals here against them for three and a half years.\n10:41 Comment: Nobody's done it in Europe since a Tony Yeboah hat-trick\n10:45 Comment: from Leeds United in 1995.\n10:53 Comment: Arsene Wenger's message, we've got to give a lie to all of these statistics.\n10:58 Comment: And I think they're all right.\n11:0 Comment: There are a lot of them, though.\n11:2 Comment: APPLAUSE\n11:15 Comment: Pizarro given straight to Cazorla.\n11:21 Comment: Poppelaan switched to Monreal.\n11:25 Comment: Wilbeck coming infield.\n11:28 Comment: Salzburg header towards L bride.\n11:30 Comment: powerfullyԟ\n11:31 Comment: and I say back to Ronaldo,\n11:33 Comment: that another point for Jose Martínez.\n11:44 Comment: As you can follow one of these statistics kinds of analyzing\n11:48 Comment: out what they are doing.\n11:49 Comment: Give me one second so I can show Englishpot.\n11:51 Comment: 93K告诉 BoxingExpect Trophy such high numbers.\n11:54 Comment: There's no road to go that the perfects can fly into.\n11:56 Comment: I'm sorry, there's noでは to go out of here today.\n11:58 Comment: have a nid de la d' in there, a throw in's been given.\n12:7 Comment: Sanchez just losing the ball under his feet.\n12:12 Comment: Coquelin to Monreal, who seems to be free man for Arsenal,\n12:17 Comment: coming forward down that left-hand side.\n12:19 Comment: Each time he's got it, though, so far,\n12:21 Comment: he's had a little look in front of him\n12:23 Comment: and then checked back and started again.\n12:28 Comment: Which is OK, if he doesn't feel it's right, then keep the ball.\n12:31 Comment: Of course, at some point,\n12:33 Comment: they want to try and get it in those wider areas to Welbeck or Sanchez\n12:36 Comment: and let them get at the full-backs.\n12:38 Comment: Someone's got to start trying to commit somebody\n12:40 Comment: in order to free up some space for somebody else.\n12:42 Comment: Coquelin to Giroud.\n12:45 Comment: So much disguise on Coquelin's pass at full.\n12:48 Comment: This fellow countryman.\n12:56 Comment: Good save, I don't know, Monaco.\n12:58 Comment: I don't know what they're doing.\n13:0 Comment: Nobody committing, nobody diving, nobody selling themselves,\n13:2 Comment: putting themselves out of the game.\n13:6 Comment: A good output for 4-4-2.\n13:8 Comment: That's essentially what it is.\n13:11 Comment: Moutinho just drops back in there\n13:13 Comment: and protects the other two central midfielders when he needs to.\n13:17 Comment: What they're basically saying is, when Arsenal have got the ball,\n13:19 Comment: what have you got? How can you break us down?\n13:21 Comment: Come on, that's a good area for Ozil.\n13:24 Comment: That's it, Ozil.\n13:25 Comment: Dropping in to Alexis Sanchez.\n13:28 Comment: And away might have to Nour.\n13:37 Comment: Coquelin.\n13:38 Comment: Sanchez.\n13:40 Comment: Bellerin's got forward here.\n13:42 Comment: That's a tempting cross towards Giroud!\n13:44 Comment: He did it!\n13:46 Comment: He wasn't too far away.\n13:47 Comment: It's a good climb by Olivier Giroud\n13:49 Comment: and a searching ball from Hector Bellerin.\n13:51 Comment: Great run from the right-back.\n13:53 Comment: Lovely cross, stands it up, gives Giroud a chance.\n13:55 Comment: Something to attack.\n13:56 Comment: That's it.\n13:58 Comment: And he's all over Wallace there. He's stronger.\n14:2 Comment: He's unlucky.\n14:3 Comment: He's just backpedalling a little bit to really get on top of that.\n14:6 Comment: But good play.\n14:9 Comment: He had three good chances in the first 15 minutes\n14:12 Comment: of the second half of the first leg.\n14:14 Comment: Didn't hit the target with any of them.\n14:16 Comment: And he was substituted after a nut.\n14:25 Comment: He is the kind of striker who will keep coming back for more.\n14:27 Comment: Oh, he is.\n14:28 Comment: Fabulous goal at the weekend as well.\n14:30 Comment: That's better, wasn't it?\n14:31 Comment: Starting with those who were just in a little pocket of space.\n14:34 Comment: The quick switch from left to right.\n14:36 Comment: And then the right-back's on his way.\n14:38 Comment: He waits for Sanchez.\n14:39 Comment: Lovely cross and a good opportunity.\n14:41 Comment: More of that.\n14:43 Comment: First of the evening for Arsenal.\n14:45 Comment: That's part of 15 minutes' play.\n14:47 Comment: Alexis Sanchez is just putting on the new boots.\n14:49 Comment: He's got a good shot.\n14:57 Comment: And he's just putting on the new boots.\n14:58 Comment: This will effectively be 10 men for the moment.\n15:23 Comment: Giroud with the header on.\n15:25 Comment: participated by Kuzawa to Lallon, Martial\n15:36 Comment: Kuzawa quickly forward to Ozil, and it's quickly out to him\n15:42

cut back\n16:14 Comment: Just a little bit too far, the last touch Danny Welbeck, yeah just got away from him a little bit\n16:19 Comment: It's the semblance of Arsenal pressure growing here\n16:33 Comment: Giroud finding some space\n16:37 Comment: And Drogba finding him\n16:42 Comment: But back in the end really conflicts for Ozil\n16:49 Comment: Only the ball is left for Ozil\n16:50 Comment:

Kosala, quick from Ka'sala into the path of Ozil\n17:4 Comment: early forward towards Alexi Sanchez, just cut out by Kozawa\n17:7 Comment: Could he have travelled about Ozil…\n17:8 Comment: I think he gets the ball there like that early off because Santi Kosala turn and run into the space yourself commit somebody, draw somebody out\n17:10 Comment: the end it smothered the cross but couple of tight passes there we saw in\n17:14 Comment: the middle of the park it freed up Mesut Ozil driving at the space\n17:21 Comment: getting the ball back quickly now getting at Monaco more quickly\n17:28

him\n18:44 Comment: those were coming a little deeper finally pose all our little further\n18:48 Comment: forward\n18:49 Comment: Giroud\n18:51 Comment: we won blue shirt in the box you were trying to get beyond Wallace but it's\n18:53 Comment: Cazorla to strike, there were half-hearted handball appeals.\n19:0 Comment: Santi Cazorla did find a little bit of space there just outside the box\n19:3 Comment: and Olivier Giroud found him.\n19:5 Comment: Good play from Giroud.\n19:9 Comment: Gets him across and wouldn't pull it past Santi Cazorla\n19:11 Comment: to make the goalkeeper work with that one,\n19:13 Comment: but he does well there, the centre-forward.\n19:15 Comment: He's battling away, just clips that one back.\n19:19 Comment: Appeal was a half-hearted one, he hit him straight on the foot.\n19:23 Comment: Better though, better control of the ball,\n19:30 Comment: the game dictating the tempo of the game at the moment,\n19:33 Comment: which to a degree you can understand,\n19:34 Comment: the fact that Monaco, with their lead, with their advantage,\n19:37 Comment: don't have to go busting a gut,\n19:39 Comment: they don't have to go exposing any areas of the field to Arsenal,\n19:42 Comment: but they're doing all right, they've been better with it,\n19:45 Comment: I think, the last ten minutes.\n19:53 Comment: They are a contain and counter team, Monaco, that's how they are set up.\n20:1 Comment: And the tie is set up for them in that respect.\n20:7 Comment: Yeah, Cazorla's been caught in possession and here's Alexis Sanchez.\n20:12 Comment: Now Mesut Ozil.\n20:14 Comment: Olivier Giroud trying to turn, turning into Wallace.\n20:19 Comment: Moutinho's given it away though.\n20:22 Comment: Bellerin to Sanchez.\n20:23 Comment: Here's the man down in the box.\n20:28 Comment: Space for Cazorla.\n20:31 Comment: Away but rather anxiously by Wallace.\n20:36 Comment: Olivier Giroud just, I think on that one there,\n20:39 Comment: just trying to get a shot away in the box and in it up.\n20:42 Comment: Glover in the boot.\n20:43 Comment: Studs on someone's boot and hurt himself.\n20:47 Comment: So he runs that one off.\n20:54 Comment: Exactly, take

Descente near the end of the first leg\n21:32 Comment: and it really just summed up his night.\n21:34 Comment: Could that be Bono?\n21:36 Comment: You two, the half-time turn?\n21:42 Comment: Sanchez.\n21:45 Comment: Giroud.\n21:47 Comment: Monreal.\n21:48 Comment: Good day, little boy!\n21:50 Comment: On the way back, Abdeno.\n21:53 Comment: Consola.\n22:2 Comment: Well given.\n22:4 Comment: Unnecessary run there from Giroud.\n22:6 Comment: It was popped up off Monreal.\n22:8 Comment: He's got nowhere to go with it.\n22:10 Comment: Full-back Delightly.\n22:12 Comment: He gets flattered and just drops to the floor.\n22:14 Comment: Gets a free kick.\n22:15 Comment: Gives his team a chance to put it in the box.\n22:23 Comment: And it's a free kick.\n22:30 Comment: Consola with a free kick.\n22:32 Comment: It's heading down and Koscielny is at the bar.\n22:34 Comment: Flag's up anyway.\n22:36 Comment: Wouldn't have counted.\n22:38 Comment: More at Koscielny.\n22:40 Comment: Denied by crossbar and flag.\n22:44 Comment: I think in the end Koscielny's delighted to see the flag.\n22:47 Comment: Yeah, it was a good one. It was a sharp one.\n22:49 Comment: It's come off a Monaco head.\n22:50 Comment: Oh, that's good play.\n22:51 Comment: Do you know it has?\n22:52 Comment: It's a good shot.\n22:53 Comment: It's come off Abtenaar.\n22:55 Comment: It has to be a conscious touch back in order to play the player onside.\n23:0 Comment: So the flag is correct.\n23:2 Comment: It's a tough one to see that as well for the officials.\n23:4 Comment: That is, but...\n23:6 Comment: Good spot, sir.\n23:22 Comment: Toulala.\n23:26 Comment: Koscielny.\n23:28 Comment: Kondokia.\n23:30 Comment: Toulala.\n23:31 Comment: Lost it.\n23:32 Comment: And here's Alexis Sanchez.\n23:36 Comment: Options right and left.\n23:38 Comment: Trying to feed it in to Welbeck.\n23:40 Comment: He's got there ahead of the goalkeeper.\n23:42 Comment: But he just couldn't quite bring it under control.\n23:46 Comment: The last ten minutes have been good for Arsenal.\n23:52 Comment: And Kondokia trying to run Monaco back down the field.\n23:57 Comment: Sanchez stuck to him.\n23:58 Comment: And he has been penalised.\n24:0 Comment: Come on, come on.\n24:9 Comment: Come on.\n24:40 Comment: Giroud.\n24:43 Comment: Just couldn't quite catch it with Fabinho's pass.\n24:50 Comment: Can he solve it?\n24:52 Comment: Just to be absolutely clear, the laws do stress that the touch has to be deliberate.\n24:57 Comment: A missed head does not play an opponent onside.\n25:9 Comment: Ruling Monaco travel to North London for the first leg.\n25:14 Comment: It's what you'd call a celebrity supporter.\n25:18 Comment: Arsenal have got Dara O'Brien and Debo O'Leary.\n25:20 Comment: Monaco have got Prince Albert II.\n25:22 Comment: Both good operators and top guys, but not royalty.\n25:36 Comment: That's Sanchez.\n25:40 Comment: And towards Bellary.\n25:42 Comment: Kusawa reacted well.\n25:43 Comment: Lucky.\n25:44 Comment: Important they get those little combinations going if they can.\n25:47 Comment: Both sides, really.\n25:48 Comment: Not seeing so much of it from World Cup and Mono Real,\n25:50 Comment: but potential certainly down the right.\n25:52 Comment: Side with Bellerin and Sanchez.\n25:54 Comment: Marseille.\n25:58 Comment: Troubletini.\n26:1 Comment: Cammini.\n26:7 Comment: There's another hopeful ball into the box.\n26:9 Comment: Bellerin hasn't quite seen it off.\n26:11 Comment: This is Berbatov.\n26:12 Comment: Oh!\n26:29 Comment: 0 Could not see\n26:32 Comment: paste it ¤ar.\n26:33 Comment: winner to Hamid Ashraf Robira Zahid\n26:36 Comment: best 1-1 equalizer,\n26:47 Comment: estranged the kit.\n26:48 Comment: But even if the Americans do lose with this,\n26:51 Comment: Aquroot잭\n26:51 Comment: but even if the Americans do lose with this,\n26:51 Comment: Cazorla.\n27:0 Comment: Two of those combinations between Sanchez and Cazorla,\n27:5 Comment: and Ozil starting to open some doors.\n27:7 Comment: Here is Alexis Sanchez, Giroud, Sanchez.\n27:11 Comment: It's a searching ball, which Wallace responded well to.\n27:15 Comment: Yeah, good play again, sharp little give-and-go.\n27:18 Comment: Just the ball from Sanchez, was just cut back a bit, Danny Wilbert,\n27:20 Comment: I think wanted it wide across the six-yard line.\n27:27 Comment: Cazorla.\n27:28 Comment: And it by Abdelour this time, Berbatov, into the path of Giroud.\n27:39 Comment: To Lallot.\n27:42 Comment: Kabilia.\n27:50 Comment: Good work by Bellerin.\n28:1 Comment: And far by Marseille.\n28:3 Comment: One other game being played this evening in the competition,\n28:6 Comment: and Atletico Madrid have taken the lead on the night against Bayer Leverkusen,\n28:11 Comment: and that tie is now locked at 1-1 on aggregate.\n28:14 Comment: Goal!\n28:29 Comment: Well played.\n28:33 Comment: Unreal.\n28:36 Comment: Giroud.\n28:44 Comment: Strong young man, Jeffrey Kondofia,\n28:46 Comment: and was just caught right there by Olivier Giroud,\n28:49 Comment: I think has been given.\n28:50 Comment: hands.\n28:52 Comment: hands.

Berber top with the header on.\n29:20 Comment: John Routinho, well found by Fabinho.\n29:29 Comment: Martial.\n29:31 Comment: That's really good work by Alexis Sanchez.\n29:41 Comment: I think Mesut Ozil is one of those players as well, Clive.\n29:43 Comment: You've got to keep him involved.\n29:44 Comment: I think to be at his best, he's one of those.\n29:48 Comment: Look there, he's just looking, he's shrugging his shoulders a bit.\n29:51 Comment: I think there's been one or two times when they could have given it to him.\n29:53 Comment: That's better.\n29:54 Comment: Got to keep the ball with him.\n29:56 Comment: Got to keep him feeling like he's right at the centre of things, at the hub of it.\n29:59 Comment: To get the best out of him, I don't think he's one of those that can drift and be that influential here and there.\n30:4 Comment: Football coaches talk about players who recycle the ball.\n30:7 Comment: That's what Ozil does.\n30:9 Comment: Well, he almost lends it to you to get it back like that, just to try to keep the attack moving.\n30:13 Comment: Giroud into Cazorla.\n30:15 Comment: Now Alexis Sanchez.\n30:17 Comment: He's towards the...\n30:18 Comment: Danny Welbeck.\n30:19 Comment: Olivier Giroud trying to turn.\n30:22 Comment: Still not out of this.\n30:24 Comment: There's a goal kick in the end.\n30:26 Comment: Just little sights of goal for Arsenal.\n30:28 Comment: Lucky.\n30:29 Comment: Good play again down this right side.\n30:31 Comment: Deep across this time.\n30:31 Comment: Welbeck doing exactly the right thing, just putting it back in the pot.\n30:35 Comment: Giroud trying to make something of it.\n30:37 Comment: He's batting away against Abdenor and Wallace.\n30:39 Comment: He's not favourite there at all.\n30:41 Comment: May even be a little bit over-enthusiastic with that one.\n30:45 Comment: Because Wallace was panicking about what to do with that.\n30:48 Comment: But he's got to keep believing, just got to keep going.\n30:52 Comment: And hope that one of those little headers back across the goal might just drop.\n30:55 Comment: And someone can turn and hook it in.\n30:58 Comment: Just one before half-time would make such a big difference for Arsenal.\n31:7 Comment: Two of the three they scored at the weekend against West Ham came in the last ten minutes.\n31:12 Comment: As long as they're making some real progress in the match, they can keep their heads up.\n31:16 Comment: And here's Welbeck making progress down the field.\n31:18 Comment: Down the flank.\n31:20 Comment: Lucky.\n31:22 Comment: Sean Curzio with a clean pair of heels there.\n31:23 Comment: Danny Welbeck just again, that final touch.\n31:26 Comment: Before he picks his head up just a little bit heavy.\n31:30 Comment: He's just switched over to the right side at the moment.\n31:32 Comment: Danny Welbeck, Sanchez over to the left.\n31:34 Comment: Maybe just to see if he can get involved in the game a little bit more.\n31:37 Comment: Arsenal's right side has been more profitable.\n31:44 Comment: Abdenor put Giroud under pressure in the...\n31:48 Comment: Tunisian centre-back didn't have too many options down the field.\n31:51 Comment: And Monaco are surrounding the ball quite cheaply on occasions.\n31:54 Comment: And they've got Jean Moutinho and Berbatov.\n31:56 Comment: They're not going to run anybody.\n31:57 Comment: So if there's pressure on that ball, then Murtasaka, Koscielny expected to go nice and tight to those forward players.\n32:4 Comment: Make sure that they can't have the ball into feet easy.\n32:18 Comment: Arsenal's grip on the game is growing.\n32:20 Comment: There's nothing to show for it as yet.\n32:22 Comment: Maybe Danny Welbeck can steal something here.\n32:25 Comment: Just ran away from him.\n32:30 Comment: Too low.\n32:33 Comment: Don't know where to find Berbatov.\n32:34 Comment: Martial.\n32:37 Comment: Probably one-two off Murtasaka there.\n32:40 Comment: Good reaction from Koscielny.\n32:44 Comment: Actually, if the ball from Martial had been a little bit firmer to Giroud,\n32:47 Comment: he'd have made a good little...\n32:48 Comment: That was a better spell there for Monaco.\n32:52 Comment: Sharp passes.\n32:52 Comment: A little bit of glass from Berbatov.\n32:54 Comment: Releasing Martial.\n32:57 Comment: Ball in behind.\n32:57 Comment: Well seen from Koscielny.\n33:3 Comment: Arsenal are going to have to take a punch or two.\n33:5 Comment: They're going to have to, of course, respect the fact that the opponent's going to have the ball in decent areas from time to time.\n33:10 Comment: They've got to defend it.\n33:12 Comment: Be thorough with the way that they defend.\n33:13 Comment: I think that was a shot from Berbatov.\n33:18 Comment: It was a shot from Berbatov.\n33:23 Comment: Ozil.\n33:23 Comment: Lifted to Gazzola.\n33:30 Comment: Monreal.\n33:44 Comment: Ozil see more of the ball.\n33:46 Comment: Alexis Sanchez on the left.\n33:48 Comment: hand side.\n33:53 Comment: Stolen back momentarily\n33:54 Comment: by Cazorla.\n33:58 Comment: Again, pressure on Abdenour as he clears.\n34:3 Comment: Martial's made\n34:4 Comment: something out of nothing there.\n34:7 Comment: He's gone arseholes right.\n34:9 Comment: Surprised him.\n34:11 Comment: And me.\n34:18 Comment: There's a\n34:40 Comment: part of\n34:42 Comment: Monreal's run.\n34:44 Comment: He's kept it in.\n34:46 Comment: Nacho Monreal, still going.\n34:48 Comment: Oh.\n34:50 Comment: Almost in the way.\n34:53 Comment: Oh dear, did great\n34:54 Comment: there, the left back, and then put the final ball\n34:56 Comment: in, the delivery was poor.\n34:59 Comment: Cazorla to Welbeck.\n35:0 Comment: Slips on to Olivier Giroud.\n35:2 Comment: He got there ahead of the goalkeeper\n35:4 Comment: and made a block. Giroud!\n35:7 Comment: One for Arsenal.\n35:9 Comment: Two more needed.\n35:12 Comment: 55 minutes to find\n35:14 Comment: them, and Olivier Giroud,\n35:16 Comment: who's their chief culprit\n35:18 Comment: in front of goal in the first leg,\n35:20 Comment: has struck first.\n35:21 Comment: Not even\n35:22 Comment: a semblance of a smile.\n35:24 Comment: They've got work to do.\n35:25 Comment: Great finish.\n35:27 Comment: You know, this got away from Arsenal players\n35:28 Comment: three or four occasions, hasn't it, in this first\n35:30 Comment: first half, and even there you're thinking\n35:32 Comment: it's gonna get away from Olivier Giroud.\n35:34 Comment: But you know what, when it comes back to him,\n35:35 Comment: he gets a little bit of good fortune,\n35:37 Comment: but the finish is terrific. Off his weaker foot.\n35:40 Comment: You know, that's not an easy one.\n35:42 Comment: That's not an easy one, that's on the half.\n35:43 Comment: Well, he can sky that, you can miscue that,\n35:45 Comment: but he puts it straight to the roof of the net.\n35:48 Comment: Perfect.\n35:49 Comment: Absolutely perfect for Arsenal, that is.\n35:51 Comment: And I think they've deserved it.\n35:53 Comment: They've deserved their lead.\n35:54 Comment: They've been the better team.\n35:55 Comment: First ten minutes, yeah.\n35:56 Comment: Monaco look good, but since then,\n35:58 Comment: it's been all Arsenal for me.\n36:0 Comment: Well back.\n36:3 Comment: He's pushed it too far in front of him again.\n36:5 Comment: Martial.\n36:9 Comment: I mean, I really spoke about the pitch before the game,\n36:11 Comment: but I obviously had a look at it.\n36:12 Comment: That seemed to be bobbling and running away from one or two,\n36:14 Comment: even there, Martial, that one.\n36:16 Comment: I can't tell you.\n36:18 Comment: I mean, it's been up until that goal going in for Arsenal.\n36:20 Comment: It's just been a little bit of care needed in the last third,\n36:23 Comment: but it's a big moment that is on the night,\n36:25 Comment: because that just sows a little seed of doubt\n36:28 Comment: in Monaco players' minds.\n36:31 Comment: Well, back to the run.\n36:32 Comment: Olivier Giroud's 15th goal of the season,\n36:35 Comment: the first in the Champions League,\n36:37 Comment: largely because of injury.\n36:38 Comment: He wasn't involved in the group stages.\n36:40 Comment: Seven goals in his last eight games.\n36:45 Comment: One blot on that record.\n36:48 Comment: His first leg performance.\n36:52 Comment: He's starting to make some amends.\n36:57 Comment: He's won the ball well there.\n36:59 Comment: Terrific.\n37:0 Comment: Mesut Ozil.\n37:1 Comment: Arsenal don't want this half to end now.\n37:4 Comment: Alexis Sanchez.\n37:5 Comment: In towards Giroud.\n37:6 Comment: Good header.\n37:7 Comment: Welbeck struck it and it just hit Abdenoor.\n37:10 Comment: He knew nothing about it.\n37:11 Comment: Danny Welbeck shot on target,\n37:13 Comment: but somehow,\n37:14 Comment: Ayman Abdenoor blocked it.\n37:16 Comment: He's pissed it as well, hasn't he?\n37:17 Comment: Danny Welbeck.\n37:18 Comment: He has it.\n37:19 Comment: It's very sweet.\n37:20 Comment: Watch this.\n37:21 Comment: Bang.\n37:22 Comment: He's hit that goalkeeper scrambling.\n37:24 Comment: Abdenoor, as you say, Clive,\n37:26 Comment: already on the floor.\n37:27 Comment: Just gets something on it.\n37:29 Comment: Crawls past the post.\n37:32 Comment: Monaco on the ropes a bit here.\n37:35 Comment: Kozula with the corner.\n37:37 Comment: Just over the head of the flying Murtisaka.\n37:47 Comment: Got to keep their concentration.\n37:49 Comment: Bellarine's lost it.\n37:50 Comment: Well done.\n37:51 Comment: That's good cover from Monreal as Giroud threatened to escape.\n38:2 Comment: Kozula well played.\n38:7 Comment: And the second goal that Monaco have missed.\n38:8 Comment: That's a good one.\n38:17 Comment: That was the only goal that Monaco have conceded in their last 13 home matches.\n38:20 Comment: So difficult it is to score against this team.\n39:16 Comment: Oh, the loose pass, but Alexis Sanchez did well, and Welbeck's gone on here.\n39:20 Comment: There's too much on it for Giroud.\n39:22 Comment: He's going at the sort of speed there, really, Danny Webber, go on your own.\n39:25 Comment: Maybe take the ball yourself, have a shot, just try to fire it into Giroud, and it's too quick.\n39:31 Comment: But Ibertov can't hold it out.\n39:34 Comment: Cacioni.\n39:35 Comment: Real momentum now for Arsenal.\n39:38 Comment: Alexis Sanchez.\n39:42 Comment: They're challenged by Tullo Lalland, and the referee's nose has come off, yeah.\n39:46 Comment: Can bring it away.\n39:52 Comment: Anthony Martial.\n39:54 Comment: João Moutinho.\n40:0 Comment: Arsenal's appetite to hunt the ball down is really good at the moment.\n40:5 Comment: A little too good in Giroud's case, a little too eager.\n40:12 Comment: There's the strike from Danny Welbeck.\n40:14 Comment: The goalkeeper.\n40:16 Comment: Actually in spooling to his right.\n40:17 Comment: Looks like he would have saved it.\n40:18 Comment: Abdel Nour's got eyes on the ball.\n40:20 Comment: Abdel Nour could easily have deflected it beyond the goalkeeper, though, couldn't he?\n40:23 Comment: Could easily have done it.\n40:24 Comment: There's a problem, though, for Sely, with the header away, as far as Diroc.\n40:28 Comment: Now Fabinho.\n40:32 Comment: It's good work by Kokolows, had a good game.\n40:35 Comment: Ozil, up towards Giroud.\n40:37 Comment: Goal!\n40:53 Comment: That's it.\n40:54 Comment: Take that collective breather but take it with the ball.\n40:56 Comment: Keep it across the back if you have to.\n41:0 Comment: Ozil's forced it forward.\n41:5 Comment: Welbeck's done well to retain that.\n41:9 Comment: Giroud.\n41:10 Comment: Ozil had gone on, it actually comes through Welbeck.\n41:13 Comment: Now Nacho Monreal.\n41:14 Comment: Alexi Sanchez.\n41:15 Comment: Wellbeck.\n41:22 Comment: It's all the slip to Ozil, into Giroud, onto Wellbeck.\n41:26 Comment: Really good football from Arsenal.\n41:27 Comment: Wallace's clearance blocked by Giroud.\n41:30 Comment: Still Alexis Sanchez.\n41:32 Comment: Now down he goes, referee's right there.\n41:34 Comment: He's going to book the Arsenal player, I think.\n41:36 Comment: He is.\n41:38 Comment: Referee could not have been closer there.\n41:41 Comment: And he's going to show the yellow card to Alexis Sanchez for diving.\n41:45 Comment: As soon as he picked it up, he was driving out the opponent.\n41:48 Comment: Driving into the space, into the box.\n41:52 Comment: And the defender's the wrong side of him.\n41:54 Comment: You always wonder if he's having a slight nibble.\n41:55 Comment: I mean, he's furious at that.\n41:56 Comment: It's almost an insult to him, the fact that he's been accused of that.\n42:0 Comment: Referee was right there and was very quick with it.\n42:6 Comment: Again, there's almost like a little bit of contact.\n42:8 Comment: Whether it's enough to actually send him to the floor, who knows.\n42:12 Comment: When you're running at speed, it doesn't take a lot to put yourself...\n42:15 Comment: Sanchez's legs came together, didn't they?\n42:18 Comment: Whether that was deliberate or not, I think is highly debatable.\n42:22 Comment: Trying to sneak one in with his hand on the weekend against West Ham United.\n42:26 Comment: So, that was a trick or two.\n42:30 Comment: Don't think it was a penalty.\n42:31 Comment: It doesn't have to be a yellow card, though.\n42:32 Comment: No, exactly.\n42:33 Comment: It doesn't always have to be accused of diving.\n42:37 Comment: Sometimes you can get a little...\n42:38 Comment: That's not enough for a definite foul.\n42:40 Comment: It's enough to maybe just disturb your run.\n42:45 Comment: You don't need to bebreviable again and again when you do get a penalty.\n42:48 Comment: They've both been seen\n43:14 Comment: on the pitch.\n43:14 Comment: They've both been seen on the pitch.\n43:15 Comment: and the ball is in the air.\n43:19 Comment: The ball is in the air.\n43:47 Comment: The 2 2 2 2 2 2 2\n43:49 Comment: The ball is in the air.\n44:5 Comment: That's it by Mertesacker.\n44:10 Comment: That's all it's a Monreal.\n44:21 Comment: And very well asked for a play from here, really well.\n44:24 Comment: Easy walks in front of him, but...\n44:28 Comment: As long as they concentrate now for the remainder of the half,\n44:30 Comment: and they go in, they've got one in their back pocket,\n44:32 Comment: that's all they could have asked for.\n44:34 Comment: We know that Monaco are well organised, they're sharp,\n44:38 Comment: they're quite hungry themselves.\n44:40 Comment: And now it's because they've got the bottle to hang on second half.\n44:43 Comment: Can they do it for another 45 minutes?\n44:45 Comment: It's all about impetus, and Arsenal have got that impetus.\n44:47 Comment: They're heading in the right direction.\n44:49 Comment: Got a way to go yet.\n44:55 Comment: Kozula, well bent.\n44:58 Comment: And a slick belly.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: the millionaires. I don't know anybody who lives in Monaco. Ken Bates.\n0:7 Comment: Here's a problem, Marseille has caught Bellarine in possession.\n0:12 Comment: Pass to Berbatov, cut up by Murtisaka and then lost and a little bit of a sloppy\n0:17 Comment: start to the second half but Arsenal can get Mubi again with Monreal. On by Giroud,\n0:24 Comment: here's Alexis Sanchez, Danny Welbeck's up with him, squeeze back towards Welbeck\n0:29 Comment: and come for Giroud. Had a bit of an instant lash at it, he thinks it should be a corner,\n0:34 Comment: referee's giving him a goal kick. Great little glance on that wasn't it for Sanchez who's\n0:39 Comment: fighting to get it out of his feet, it's not the greatest ball but it ends up\n0:42 Comment: dropping for Giroud, yes he's under pressure, might be better taking a touch there.\n0:46 Comment: He's coming back out or turning it onto his left foot, giving himself a better\n0:49 Comment: opportunity. Might have come off Wallace.\n0:57 Comment: There's gonna be a bit of a thrill ride this section.\n0:59 Comment: Second half, I'm sure Arsenal will have one or two alarms and they've got to live with that now.\n1:15 Comment: David Ospina here, has been a spectator for most of the first period.\n1:29 Comment: He's got a good chance of winning the game, he's got a good chance of winning the game.\n1:37 Comment: Just to underline Arsene Wenger's options for the bench, Aaron Ramsey and Theo Walcott are both amongst the substitutes.\n1:45 Comment: The other player who might just lend an attacking option on this left-hand side is Kieran Gibbs, who's a bit more attack minded than Monreal.\n1:53 Comment: Come on!\n2:2 Comment: Kieran Gibbs, who just fell over there with Gabriel and the others.\n2:3 Comment: He just fell over there.\n2:4 Comment: With Mathieu Flamini.\n2:5 Comment: He just turns out there, calls a lot and just drops to the floor.\n2:8 Comment: Not giving any contact at all.\n2:15 Comment: Goal!\n2:28 Comment: KASIELNY, OZIL.\n2:37 Comment: POKLAN STAIN WELL TO RETAIN THE BALL THERE.\n2:40 Comment: KOZOLA ENTER THE PATH OF BELARINE.\n2:48 Comment: KOZOLA KEEPING ARSENAL TICKING OVER.\n2:52 Comment: STILL A LITTLE TOO MUCH ON THAT FOR OZIL.\n2:58 Comment: MANAGED TO GET TO THE BYELINE OF BOTH SIDES DURING THAT FIRST 45 MINUTES.\n3:4 Comment: BUT IT FELT BETTER.\n3:5 Comment: IT FELT MORE NATURAL ON THE RIGHT SIDE.\n3:8 Comment: I HOPE BELARINE CONTINUES TO, AT THE RIGHT TIME, MAKE HIMSELF AVAILABLE.\n3:12 Comment: LOOK TO GET ROUND DANNY WELBECK, WHO'S IN FRONT OF HIM AT THE MOMENT.\n3:14 Comment: HE IS A DANGEROUS PLAYER.\n3:17 Comment: HE'S VERY KEEN, ENTHUSIASTIC, HE'S QUICK.\n3:20 Comment: HE GETS TO THE BYELINE.\n3:21 Comment: HE CAN STAND UP A DECENT CROSS AS WELL.\n3:23 Comment: GOOD WORK AGAIN BY KOZOLA.\n3:27 Comment: KOSZOLA.\n3:28 Comment: OZIL AND ALEXIS SAMPSON WORKING IN A TIGHT SPACE.\n3:32 Comment: AND GERRAUD OFF TO WELBECK.\n3:34 Comment: AND HERE'S MESSEN OZIL, EARLY IN, CORNER KICKOFF TO LILLA.\n3:38 Comment: TRIED TO DELIVER IT EARLY.\n3:40 Comment: HE'S GOT TO HAVE PINPOINT ACCURACY REQUIRED.\n3:43 Comment: HE DOESN'T REALLY MAKE THE CROSS, OZIL.\n3:45 Comment: BUT AGAIN, A LOVELY ONE-TOUCH FOOTBALL\n3:49 Comment: THAT'S SYNONYMOUS WITH HIS ARSENAL TEAM.\n3:57 Comment: OZIL WITH THE CROSS.\n3:58 Comment: ALL THE WAY.\n3:59 Comment: HE'S GOT TO TURN THE RING IN THE CORNER TOWARDS KOSELNY.\n4:2 Comment: ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE BELLARY.\n4:6 Comment: KOSELNY JUMPING WITH THE GOAL-KEEPER.\n4:9 Comment: SILVER SIX INCHES.\n4:58 Comment: off\n5:3 Comment: His annual tackle count may be in single figures, but that was a good one\n5:10 Comment: Routinho to Dirac\n5:13 Comment: Can't retain the ball\n5:19 Comment: It's well worked again by Arsenal\n5:22 Comment: Passing has got better and better as the game has gone on\n5:24 Comment: Cazorla towards Giroud, cut out by Dirac\n5:29 Comment: now Ozil\n5:34 Comment: It's been Alexis Sanchez at the second time of asking and here's Cazorla well seen by Cazorla\n5:45 Comment: Wallace under pressure though. Yeah under pressure giving it straight back\n5:51 Comment: Ozil\n5:54 Comment: It's on the same wavelength as Alexis Sanchez looking to the referee\n6:4 Comment: They're only able to really get out through their wide men\n6:6 Comment: Giroud and Martial\n6:8 Comment: Just considering at half time how much longer Leonardo Jardim perseveres with Berbatov and Jean Moutinho\n6:14 Comment: They're two very good experienced players, of course, but not the quickest\n6:18 Comment: They don't have that out ball, they don't have that Koscielny and Mertesacker\n6:21 Comment: haven't got that\n6:22 Comment: panic of that threat something knocked him behind\n6:24 Comment: them\n6:25 Comment: Martial scored two goals as the main striker here on Friday in a league match\n6:29 Comment: He can play in that position and he's young and quick and athletic\n6:36 Comment: Alexis Sanchez\n6:39 Comment: Danny Welbeck\n6:43 Comment: Alexis Sanchez there was a late challenge there by Condovia and it's a free kick and I think it's going to be a yellow card for\n6:51 Comment: Jeffrey Condovia\n6:54 Comment: Danny Welbeck Sanchez trying to plan in to go little one-two\n7:2 Comment: Welbeck nearly got in\n7:4 Comment: You see from this angle that he catches him Condovia as late as never they never get in there\n7:13 Comment: Chance this\n7:20 Comment: He only had a couple of saves to make during the first leg he's been\n7:23 Comment: far and away the busier keeper tonight Daniel Subasic\n7:26 Comment: Cam Urzel or Sanchez keeping busy here\n7:31 Comment: He's the favorite\n7:35 Comment: A lot of bodies in that room as well goalkeeper having to move a long way across his goal to make sure he can see the ball\n7:46 Comment: It's going to be Mesut Urzel towards the top corner and Subasic just helped him on its way\n7:53 Comment: Can do no more Urzel good strike\n7:55 Comment: Free kick\n7:57 Comment: He's going to have to have been able to hit it a wee bit harder yeah right into that top corner but\n8:1 Comment: Passed the goalkeeper a question forces him to make a save\n8:10 Comment: Urzel with a corner in towards Koscielny good defending by Wallis\n8:14 Comment: Such good defending from João Moutinho\n8:17 Comment: It's a clever ball from Koscielny\n8:19 Comment: Urzel\n8:23 Comment: The top two of his defensive duties again\n8:27 Comment: Again\n8:39 Comment: He got a bit of pressure on Abdenoah he's just going to serve it forward nobody expecting it looking for it\n8:44 Comment: Certainly there Dierar or Martial off the other side one of them can take a chance just bend the run a little bit\n8:52 Comment: Offer something\n8:54 Comment: As soon as a little bit of pressure is applied they're just giving it straight back to Arsenal\n9:1 Comment: It's important that Arsenal picked up where they left off at the end of the first half and they've done that in the main\n9:7 Comment: It's the one goal from Olivier Giroud after 36 minutes two more needed well back\n9:15 Comment: They're inspired by Wallis as again anywhere will do\n9:22 Comment: Urzel to Alexis Sanchez\n9:42 Comment: Back to Bellary\n9:45 Comment: Sanchez, Urzel\n9:50 Comment: Go, go!\n9:51 Comment: He's got to fight him now\n9:52 Comment: I think Torres Monreal who made a late run into the box\n9:54 Comment: Did actually, did make a good run the left back\n9:57 Comment: Not sure whether that ball from Urzel was for Danny Welbeck or the full back but\n10:1 Comment: Between the two of them\n10:4 Comment: A mistake from Coquelin\n10:5 Comment: Here's Kondogbia\n10:7 Comment: Trying to profit\n10:8 Comment: He slipped it through, Giroud's offside flag went up belatedly but did go up\n10:13 Comment: It's good play from Kondogbia\n10:15 Comment: First time Coquelin sort of made a little mistake and\n10:19 Comment: Kondogbia's run into the space\n10:20 Comment: It was a sharp flag and I tell you what\n10:22 Comment: Very, very, very close\n10:24 Comment: Always difficult that when you've got defenders coming out holding the line\n10:27 Comment: And someone flying through 100 mile an hour\n10:29 Comment: Difficult\n10:36 Comment: Urzel, Alexis Sanchez\n10:41 Comment: Bowled to the ground by Martial\n10:43 Comment: Another free kick in a promising position\n10:46 Comment: Well, Urzel moments ago had one from pretty much the same team\n10:49 Comment: And he's in pretty much the same sort of spot\n10:52 Comment: So he knows what's required\n10:53 Comment: Little bit more pace on this one if it's to be him again\n10:56 Comment: Good run from Sanchez, positive run\n10:59 Comment: That side suits the left footer Mesut Urzel\n11:2 Comment: But I think this might be Alexis Sanchez's turn or\n11:4 Comment: Maybe Santa Cazorla\n11:6 Comment: Not quite sure whether he's right footed or left footed\n11:19 Comment: I don't know\n11:20 Comment: It seems quite a long way out\n11:22 Comment: But that does give you an advantage in terms of going for it\n11:25 Comment: In terms of really trying to hit it with genuine pace to get it over the wall\n11:28 Comment: You know you can get it back under the bar and it's not a problem\n11:35 Comment: It's Cazorla\n11:36 Comment: It's in towards the heads\n11:37 Comment: And it's well defended\n11:41 Comment: A lot of respect there\n11:42 Comment: Just got some good shots\n11:43 Comment: And it's a good one\n11:44 Comment: And that's the end of the match\n11:45 Comment: We'll be back to you on Sunday\n11:46 Comment: See you then\n11:47 Comment: Bye bye\n11:49 Comment: Something on it\n11:51 Comment: Balbino's kept it in\n11:53 Comment: Found Berbatov\n11:54 Comment: That's a beautiful touch for Toulonop\n11:56 Comment: It's not such a good touch\n12:0 Comment: And the Monaco skipper atoned for his error\n12:4 Comment: Girard to Berbatov\n12:9 Comment: It's a clever exchange with Girard\n12:11 Comment: Here's Berbatov\n12:13 Comment: It's floated towards Martial\n12:18 Comment: Support from Kovacic\n12:19 Comment: Cazorla\n12:20 Comment: In towards Dira\n12:21 Comment: Important header by Casaldi\n12:23 Comment: Very important\n12:24 Comment: Berbatov\n12:25 Comment: Casaldi again\n12:29 Comment: Alexis Sanchez just tacked by Jérémie Toulonop\n12:34 Comment: Bellerin doing well\n12:36 Comment: Martial\n12:40 Comment: Once again Casaldi in the way\n12:44 Comment: And that's a poor

Comment: In towards Giroud but it's easy enough for Sigur Seç.\n19:47 Comment: And that has clipped up just a little bit too much from Hector Bellerin.\n19:51 Comment: He really got to try and wrap his foot around it, be brave and really go for it.

accelerating.\n22:12 Comment: Olivier Giroud.\n22:15 Comment: Cazorla got back there.\n22:22 Comment: He's got a feeling of a real cup tie now.\n22:24 Comment: Arsenal have lost a little bit of their control of the game but\n22:27 Comment: it's inevitable as we tick into the final quarter of the second leg.\n22:31 Comment: And also with the change they've made.\n22:33 Comment: It was a positive one.\n22:35 Comment: Aaron Ramsey looking to get up there alongside Giroud and get into the box.\n22:39 Comment: So they're going to be a little bit light in midfield when they lose it.\n22:47 Comment: Cazorla.\n22:50 Comment: Bellerin.\n22:52 Comment: Alexis Sanchez.\n22:54 Comment: Aaron Ramsey.\n22:55 Comment: Chance to shoot for Ramsey.\n22:57 Comment: Just took it too far and Wallace

Comment: Ozil down the side for Giroud.\n23:14 Comment: Wallace did enough.\n23:18 Comment: Charles moments ago for Aaron Ramsey wasn't it?\n23:22 Comment: Sanchez give him the ball and could have given it straight back.\n23:26 Comment: Instead of that he took a touch and he did everything right apart from just moving it onto his right peg and hit it.\n23:37 Comment: Another change coming for Monaco.\n23:41 Comment: That's the end of Dimitar Berbatov's evening.\n23:47 Comment: His replacement will be under-15 Bernardo.\n23:52 Comment: Silva.\n23:53 Comment: He's an attacking midfield player who's been named in the provisional Portuguese national squad for the first time in the last week.\n24:3 Comment: He's a regular in the number 10 position for Monaco.\n24:13 Comment: He's a ball player rather than a runner.\n24:17 Comment: Giroud also on the national sector.\n24:19 Comment: He's a deal on this match.\n24:20 Comment: He's been seeded for a few minutes.\n24:22 Comment: After an hour long slow whistle.\n24:24 Comment: Thank you.\n24:32 Comment: He resisted the temptation, didn't he, Leonardo Jardim, of putting a flyer up the front.\n24:36 Comment: I think he wants to have that pace in the wide areas where he feels Arsenal are more of a threat.\n24:42 Comment: Walcott stripped off and ready to come out.\n24:45 Comment: Goal!\n24:52 Comment: Goal for Arsenal!\n24:53 Comment: Goal for Barcelona!\n25:13 Comment: You can see the clock ticking down.\n25:14 Comment: And you can get a little bit anxious and start serving your foot a little bit too quick.\n25:17

goalkeeper\n27:35 Comment: now free kick\n27:37 Comment: Arsenal have got to keep the cool somehow however on just those last two moments\n27:42 Comment: see this was that run from Ferreira Carrasco earlier when he knocked it\n27:46 Comment: right across the six yard box thankfully no one on the end of it we'll see\n27:50 Comment: whether this was a back pass or is this just a toe in I think that is a control\n27:53 Comment: one back to it I think he knows exactly what he's doing there totally agree\n27:59 Comment: it's not one of those you just sort of just try and get there and you block it\n28:2 Comment: ends up going back to your goalie.\n28:5 Comment: I think he puts about two yards on his line when he caught it\n28:7 Comment: would have been a very interesting free kick\n28:13

get back recover try and deal with the free kick\n29:44 Comment: two more on a yellow card then it just gives them a little bit more of a decision to make\n29:50 Comment: There's a free kick.\n30:1

minds.\n32:40 Comment: Herrera Carrasco trying to escape.\n32:42 Comment: I think Monreal will get it in these wider areas.\n32:44 Comment: Particularly Monreal.\n32:45 Comment: He had an opportunity.\n32:46 Comment: You've got to take somebody on and try and get across him.\n32:48 Comment: Monreal.\n32:49 Comment: If you're going to go through the eye of a needle,\n32:51 Comment:

Comment: Yes.\n33:17 Comment: Two down.\n33:18 Comment: One for Goff.\n33:19 Comment: A little over 11 minutes left for Arsenal to find a goal to make Champions League history\n33:30 Comment: because Aaron Ramsey's goal has put them on the brink.\n33:33 Comment: Brilliant. Fantastic ball that is. Great run from Monreal. Cuts it back. Walcott is very unlucky.\n33:39 Comment: What a poor clearance that is from Curzon. A really poor clearance.\n33:43 Comment: Drops right at the feet of Aaron Ramsey. This time he does get it out onto that right peg\n33:48 Comment: and gives Super City no chance whatsoever. Now they will panic.\n33:54 Comment: When you've scored an extra-time FA Cup final winner, I'm not sure I could call it...\n33:58 Comment: Happy St Patrick's Day, Bonner. I'm not sure I could call it Aaron Ramsey's most important goal for Arsenal.\n34:3 Comment: But I think it's second right now.\n34:7 Comment: Oh, it's a big goal.\n34:9 Comment: And here is the goal scorer.\n34:18 Comment: Well done.\n34:27 Comment: Well, they've been here before. Three years ago, a goal away against Milan.\n34:31 Comment: Two years ago, a goal away against Bayern Munich.\n34:35 Comment: Cazorla's lost it. Here's Ferreira Carrasco.\n34:39 Comment: Moran Cassiani. Rugged and resolute. Wins it back.\n34:48 Comment: Here goes Theo Walcott.\n35:13 Comment: Well done.\n35:18 Comment: Giroud trying to break out.\n35:24 Comment: Ferreira Carrasco is onside this time.\n35:36 Comment: Good work by Cazorla.\n35:40 Comment: Alexis Sanchez.\n35:43 Comment: That must be a foul.\n35:44 Comment: There by Fabinho.\n35:45 Comment: It has to be.\n35:47 Comment: He's not interested.\n35:56 Comment: How might that get up?\n35:58 Comment: Let's just give a little give and go there.\n35:59 Comment: Look, he's been blatantly body checked.\n36:2 Comment: But the reason why he's not getting that is because he has hit the floor once or twice.\n36:6 Comment: Might have been debatable, that one.\n36:7 Comment: Not even a doubt about it.\n36:9 Comment: You can understand Arsene Wenger's frustration there.\n36:12 Comment: Because again, it's not just the foul.\n36:15 Comment: It's the situation that he denies.\n36:16 Comment: That was a good little give and go there.\n36:18 Comment: They're in behind him.\n36:20 Comment: Giroud.\n36:21 Comment: Turn back to Ramsey again.\n36:26 Comment: Desperate defending.\n36:29 Comment: Moutinho up towards Ferreira Carrasco.\n36:32 Comment: They don't know what they're doing now, honestly.\n36:34 Comment: They want to keep the ball, but they can't.\n36:36 Comment: They want to get it to their wide men.\n36:38 Comment: There's a blue

    "summary": "Under the floodlights at the Stade Louis II, Monaco hosted Arsenal in what promised to be an intense encounter, following their first-leg triumph in the UEFA Champions League Round of 16. Monaco arrived with a substantial 3-1 advantage from their stellar performance at the Emirates, requiring Arsenal to score at least three times without reply to secure passage to the next stage. It was a tall order, but the Gunners took to the field brimming with determination and hope.\n\nFrom the outset, Monaco and Arsenal showed their intent to dominate proceedings. Within the first minute, Arsenal's Olivier Giroud, Danny Welbeck, and Alexis Sanchez positioned themselves strategically, clearly eager to convert chances into goals. Arsenal had demonstrated good form in their previous matches, winning seven out of their last eight games. They kept alive the optimism of reversing the deficit against a disciplined Monaco side, who had rested experienced striker Dimitar Berbatov to ensure freshness for this decisive leg.\n\nThe early exchanges saw Monaco earning a free kick due to Berbatov's foul on Francis Coquelin. Nacho Monreal, returning to the side after missing the first leg, re-established himself quickly. Yet, it was Marcia and Kuzawa of Monaco who opened the initial wave of attacks, pushing Arsenal onto the back foot. Giroud had his moments too, trying to assert dominance in the early stages with quick runs and holding play alongside Sanchez and Welbeck.\n\nWith only a few minutes into the match, it was evident Arsenal sought to unsettle Monaco. Moutinho and Berbatov combined well, almost creating early opportunities, but Arsenal's defense was alert. Giroud tried to link up play, but Monaco's resilience was evident. They often encountered Arsenal's pressure with calmness, efficiently handling offensive threats while waiting to pounce through counter-attacks.\n\nThe pitch, discussed during the build-up due to its historical criticisms, seemed in good shape. Both teams maneuvered effectively, though it would've favored Arsenal's quick passing more had it been watered further. Twice Bellerin executed commendable runs down the flank, delivering crosses that nearly connected with the lurking Giroud, indicating the Gunners' strategy to leverage pace and width.\n\nAs Arsenal grew into the game, there was a discernible pattern of interchanging passes into Monreal on the left. However, every time Monreal checked back rather than pressing forward aggressively, indicating a more cautious approach to maintain possession. Meanwhile, Monaco's compact defensive setup showed why they had the best defensive record in Ligue 1 and in the Champions League—drastically limiting space for Arsenal's creative playmakers like Mesut Ozil and Santi Cazorla.\n\nMoments of intense pressure from Monaco briefly disrupted Arsenal's momentum. Nonetheless, Arsenal consistently found ways to push through. Around the 13-minute mark, Giroud's physicality earned space in Monaco's box, allowing opportunities for Cazorla and Sanchez to capitalize, although Monaco's backline managed to stave off imminent threats.\n\nA turning point came when Berbatov, demonstrating his trademark calmness, managed to help create space and opportunities for Monaco. Yet, Arsenal's defense stood resilient, marshaled effectively by Laurent Koscielny and Per Mertesacker. Arsenal's need for goals pushed them higher up the pitch, risking additional gaps for Monaco to exploit on the break.\n\nDespite continuous waves from Arsenal, a clear sight of goal was hard to come by. By the 24th minute, Giroud attempted to capitalize on a cross, but his shot flew just wide. Several chances later, it was apparent Arsenal was wrestling against Monaco’s well-organized block. Giroud and Danny Welbeck’s work rate was commendable but often thwarted by Monaco’s unyielding defense.\n\nThe persistence eventually paid off around the 36-minute mark when Arsenal clinched the lead. It started with a well-executed move from Alexis Sanchez and Monreal narrowly evading Monaco's defenders. Giroud, despite an initial effort being blocked, kept his composure, driving the ball high into the net from a tight angle. The strike reignited Arsenal's hopes, though Giroud's celebration was muted—fully aware of the task remaining with two more needed goals.\n\nMonaco reacted by clamping down further defensively. For the remainder of the first half, Arsenal kept probing, with Bellerin providing an excellent cross into the box towards Giroud, only for the header to go narrowly over. Shortly before half-time, Sanchez had a promising drive, attempting to connect with Giroud again, but was called for an indiscretion, earning himself a yellow card for simulation. \n\nThe second half commenced much as the first ended, with Arsenal pushing against a resolute Monaco defense. Immediately, Arsenal nearly caught Monaco off-guard, but Giroud's ambitious attempt under pressure was off-target. Moments later, a subtle glance from Giroud freed Sanchez who battled to create space for Welbeck, highlighting Arsenal's determination.\n\nHowever, Monaco's counterattacking threat loomed—Ospina remained mostly untroubled during the first period but was ever-ready. As the minutes ticked by, Wenger’s willingness to capitalize on his bench’s depth saw the introduction of Aaron Ramsey and Theo Walcott, players who added both pace and goal-scoring acumen—a clear signal of Arsenal’s intent.\n\nIn the 53rd minute, a splendid effort from Mesut Ozil from a free-kick forced the best out of Subasic, which merely emphasized Arsenal's willingness to challenge Monaco’s custodian. Further on, great play by Cazorla nearly opened up Monaco again but their defensive prowess held firm.\n\nBy the hour mark, Arsenal's pressing continued, with Cazorla and Sanchez constantly testing Monaco’s resolve. However, the hosts also managed moments of ascendancy, notably through Kondogbia’s quick interplay and Martial's dangerous runs before he was substituted for Ferreira Carrasco—Monaco’s scorer from the first leg.\n\nA turning point came about 78 minutes before the end. Arsenal's unrelenting assault yielded dividends as Aaron Ramsey, who'd been injecting dynamism since coming on, doubled their lead. A Ricochet fell kindly for Ramsey after a brilliant move involving Walcott striking the post, and the Welshman slotted it home coolly to set up a thrilling finale.\n\nWith adrenaline surging, Arsenal knew they were just one goal away from achieving their improbable dream. The pace only quickened as Gibbs provided additional thrusts down the left, and Walcott’s introduction added relentless speed.\n\nAs the game edged towards the closing stages, Arsenal’s tempo never waned. They continued pressuring Monaco's defence, earning critical set-pieces and maintaining possession high up the pitch. The final minutes were a whirlwind of attacking fervor and defensive desperation.\n\nUltimately, despite Arsenal’s gallant charge, the final whistle drew an end to their Champions League aspirations for the season. They had fallen just short needing that third elusive goal to force extra time. The night ended with Monaco progressing but not without scars as Arsenal’s relentless effort had undoubtedly imposed significant strains.\n\nAs so frequently has been the case in recent times, Arsenal's European fate was to be decided by marginal defeats and stoic resistance from disciplined opponents. For Monaco, jubilation and reflected glory on a hard-earned progression—a tribute to their meticulous preparation and defensive solidity over the two legs. For Arsenal, however, there were commendable positives to draw upon, setting the foundations for future encounters on the grand continental stage."
