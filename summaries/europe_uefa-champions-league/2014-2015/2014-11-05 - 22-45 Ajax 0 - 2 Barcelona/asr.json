They're hoping to turn around their Champions League season.\n0:31 Comment: Barcelona hoping to advance to the knockout stages with two games to spare.\n0:36 Comment: But you just see these two giants of European football.\n0:42 Comment: The two names, Terry, have all kinds of theatrical possibilities, don't they?\n0:50 Comment: Yes, you can see slick passing from both teams.\n0:54 Comment: The problem is that Ajax will be forced into playing on the counter-attack.\n0:59 Comment: In general, Ajax dominate possession, but they're not going to do that against Barcelona.\n1:10 Comment: Suarez to Messi.\n1:13 Comment: They're going to have to end this development.\n1:17 Comment: Moisander in the heart of the Ajax defence.\n1:20 Comment: The goalkeeper is Silisson.\n1:22 Comment: There was a course in goal for Holland when they humiliated Spain in the World Cup finals in the summer.\n1:31 Comment: The former Barcelona man is in charge of Ajax, of course.\n1:35 Comment: Frank de Boer played with Luis Enrique.\n1:39 Comment: They were together for a number of years under Bobby Robson.\n1:43 Comment: Another new cap.\n1:47 Comment: Great first-time ball, Messi.\n1:53 Comment: Got away there from the central defender, Veltman.\n1:56 Comment: It was a wonderful first touch from Xavi to take the ball away from the Ajax player, Serrero.\n2:5 Comment: That's the perfect pass to Messi.\n2:9 Comment: We know about the possibilities when we have a front three of Messi, Neymar and Suarez.\n2:23 Comment: I assume they have to start firing together.\n2:27 Comment: Since they've been together, only Neymar has scored out of the three of them.\n2:31 Comment: That was in that defeat against Real.\n2:33 Comment: Great ball through.\n2:34 Comment: Messi maybe not expecting it.\n2:37 Comment: He should be getting passes from an even greater level now that Suarez is his supporting act.\n2:44 Comment: It's going to be interesting to see how they line up.\n2:47 Comment: They've started with Suarez on the right, Messi in the middle.\n2:50 Comment: Neymar on the left.\n2:51 Comment: You can see Suarez has already drifted infield.\n2:54 Comment: He's playing closer to Lionel Messi.\n2:56 Comment: Neymar is still staying predominantly on the left side.\n3:7 Comment: Gazi, back to Nanry.\n3:15 Comment: This is Marta, selective ahead of Gerard Pique.\n3:20 Comment: Who's against?\n3:23 Comment: Must be a dream for a midfielder when you look ahead and you've got those three to aim for.\n3:28 Comment: Messi, cute ball.\n3:30 Comment: Alba plays it in.\n3:31 Comment: Neymar is offside.\n3:36 Comment: Good height defensive line.\n3:38 Comment: He's working to an extent.\n3:40 Comment: Three times almost Barcelona have broken through.\n3:43 Comment: They persevere with a quick pass in which they're going to Barcelona.\n3:47 Comment: Make sure the pass is delivered at the right time, the run is made at the right time.\n3:52 Comment: So it is the right decision.\n3:55 Comment: As Neymar finishes off that move.\n3:58 Comment: Gordiola is just a shade offside.\n4:7 Comment: It's a risky tactic.\n4:8 Comment: You have to make sure there's pressure on the ball.\n4:10 Comment: That's not always going to be the case with the Barcelona midfield.\n4:13 Comment: The racketeers, Busquets and Xavi.\n4:16 Comment: Therefore, you feel you do have to drop off.\n4:18 Comment: Sinisan there.\n4:20 Comment: Picks up the knock.\n4:23 Comment: He stayed down after colliding with Lionel Messi.\n4:25 Comment: That's why the referee stopped the game.\n4:27 Comment: But he's hobbling back on.\n4:31 Comment: Not too often that Messi leaves his mark.\n4:34 Comment: Not too often that Messi leaves his mark on the goalkeeper.\n4:37 Comment: It's a good sign for Barcelona.\n4:38 Comment: That is showing intensity there in terms of closing down, winning the ball.\n4:42 Comment: As high up the pitch as possible.\n4:45 Comment: Boilesen.\n4:48 Comment: There's Juri Alba.\n4:50 Comment: Busquets.\n4:53 Comment: Emi Ester of course for Barcelona tonight.\n4:58 Comment: Nursing an injury.\n5:1 Comment: A calf problem.\n5:3 Comment: Ian Matthew left at home.\n5:9 Comment: It's a great pass there from Ter Stegen under pressure.\n5:12 Comment: That is one of the big reasons why Barcelona invested so much money in buying the young German goalkeeper.\n5:19 Comment: Which we haven't seen as much from Claudio Brome.\n5:21 Comment: Despite him doing really well in terms of just being a normal goalkeeper.\n5:24 Comment: Which is something that Victor Valdez was particularly good at.\n5:28 Comment: Ter Stegen seems to have similar attributes when it comes to passing the ball out the back.\n5:33 Comment: Alba.\n5:46 Comment: Nursey Torsen.\n5:48 Comment: Tries to weave his way through Rakitic.\n5:50 Comment: Chomey aids the Ajax striker.\n5:54 Comment: Serrano.\n5:56 Comment: Van Rijn.\n5:58 Comment: Now El Ghazi.\n5:59 Comment: El Ghazi.\n6:2 Comment: He doesn't like to run and defend.\n6:3 Comment: If Busquets has gone over as the extra cover.\n6:14 Comment: Xavi started the season pretty much as an extra at Barcelona.\n6:17 Comment: But in recent weeks Luis Enrique has called upon the club captain to show some leadership.\n6:30 Comment: Schurner.\n6:34 Comment: He makes sure he's down the right hand side.\n6:47 Comment: Clarence looking for Sigt Torsen.\n6:49 Comment: That is awkwardly.\n6:53 Comment: Uncertain clearance.\n6:55 Comment: Danny Alves doesn't get it out of him.\n6:58 Comment: Van Ander.\n7:0 Comment: The goalkeeper takes his time.\n7:2 Comment: Marc-Andr√© Ter Stegen.\n7:4 Comment: A new Barcelona was signing him for the best part of the last 12 months.\n7:8 Comment: Expected him to be the undisputed number one.\n7:11 Comment: But Claudia Bravo has been an exceptional former.\n7:15 Comment: Of course with the first eight league matches without conceding a goal.\n7:19 Comment: So Ter Stegen is the champion striker.\n7:22 Comment: Preparation.\n7:24 Comment: Claudia Bravo certainly taking his chance.\n7:27 Comment: The referee not liking the challenge there from Mascherano.\n7:31 Comment: It's again a case sometimes of how the laws translate into different footballing languages in the Premier League.\n7:38 Comment: And it's a bit of a challenge for the referee to be able to do that.\n7:46 Comment: And it's a bit of a case sometimes of how the laws translate into different footballing languages in the Premier League.\n7:51 Comment: I think Mascherano would have been applauded for that challenge.\n7:54 Comment: But the Portuguese referee saw the challenge from the Argentinian on the Dutch player to be illegal.\n8:5 Comment: I think it was a foul.\n8:6 Comment: Whatever law there's applied to the game it was a side foot challenge.\n8:9 Comment: It was a hard challenge.\n8:10 Comment: A hard challenge.\n8:12 Comment: More often than not when you get a player that shows more determination in the challenge than the other player.\n8:17 Comment: The referee deems that to be unfair.\n8:19 Comment: It is unfair on Mascherano.\n8:21 Comment: It was a good challenge. Side of the foot. Won the ball cleanly.\n8:24 Comment: Just good determined play from the Argentine.\n8:27 Comment: No surprise there though.\n8:33 Comment: Xherano.\n8:34 Comment: Zing Thorsen.\n8:36 Comment: Down the out of air.\n8:37 Comment: He's been forced to defend a little more than he's not been comfortable with.\n8:42 Comment: And his push gets...\n8:45 Comment: ...into a little lucky to come away from the referee.\n8:49 Comment: Oh. He's going car crazy in the early minutes of this game.\n8:55 Comment: El Garci looks puzzled as to why he's received the first caution for Ajax.\n9:1 Comment: Strong challenge.\n9:3 Comment: And a foul.\n9:5 Comment: But some of the two fouls we've had so far haven't warranted yellow cards.\n9:9 Comment: Which is a worry I have to admit.\n9:11 Comment: This early in the game.\n9:16 Comment: I'm pretty sure we're not going to see a dirty game tonight between these two teams.\n9:21 Comment: It's not really the nature of either side is it?\n9:24 Comment: As a referee you'd look at this game and probably think...\n9:27 Comment: I can referee this with some common sense.\n9:31 Comment: I'm not going to have to lay down the law in the early stages of the game.\n9:33 Comment: See Busquets pick up an injury at the weekend with blood to his mouth.\n9:37 Comment: He did take a bang on the back of the head.\n9:41 Comment: I've said many times before it's a contact sport.\n9:43 Comment: It's an occupational hazard as a footballer.\n9:46 Comment: You do get bumps and bruises.\n9:48 Comment: And that shouldn't have been a yellow card for either Mascherano or El Garci.\n9:55 Comment: They've got a good little spell from Ajax though.\n9:56 Comment: They've got the ball up the pitch.\n9:57 Comment: That's where they want to be.\n9:58 Comment: They've winked this big Killes Hill.\n10:0 Comment: Barcelona will always be in disarray.\n10:3 Comment: They've got a very good defence.\n10:5 Comment: A very strong midfield line-up from Barcelona tonight.\n10:7 Comment: A world class attacking trio.\n10:10 Comment: Ajax will still believe if they can get the back four.\n10:12 Comment: That's where their best opportunity lies.\n10:15 Comment: To get there at pace and speed.\n10:17 Comment: And the enthusiasm to keep the ball in the danger area.\n10:19 Comment: Will give them their best chance of winning this game.\n10:21 Comment: Not the usual Ajax style.\n10:23 Comment: That's the style I think they're approaching tonight.\n10:28 Comment: Ten minutes gone.\n10:29 Comment: The game is yet to explode into action.\n10:33 Comment: Busquets dishes the ball out.\n10:36 Comment: Now we have to take it.\n10:42 Comment: Willis.\n10:44 Comment: Back to Silas.\n10:49 Comment: Good days. Busquets is back in the action.\n10:52 Comment: Doesn't help when there are 50,000 Dutch supporters whistling around your ears.\n10:58 Comment: I'm surprised at the situation with Barcelona in terms of pressing higher up the pitch.\n11:4 Comment: Xavi wants to do it.\n11:5 Comment: Messi at the moment doesn't look too interested.\n11:7 Comment: Suarez and Neymar drop in deep really quick.\n11:9 Comment: They're allying Ajax to play the ball out quite easily from the back into midfield.\n11:14 Comment: That will suit Ajax.\n11:16 Comment: Ajax will always try to play out the back.\n11:17 Comment: If you press up the pitch you've got a really good chance of winning the ball back.\n11:22 Comment: Barcelona not appearing to be in a good position.\n11:25 Comment: Barcelona not appearing to be doing that at the moment.\n11:29 Comment: You don't want Suarez and Neymar playing in left-back and right-back positions.\n11:34 Comment: It's a very laid-back approach from the Catalan club so far.\n11:44 Comment: A bit of soul-searching going on between Luis Enrique and his players.\n11:49 Comment: They dominated the game against Celta at the weekend.\n11:51 Comment: They hit the woodwork on four occasions but they didn't score.\n11:56 Comment: Luis Enrique's old club beat them by one goal to nil.\n11:59 Comment: Leaves them in fourth place in the Spanish standings.\n12:7 Comment: It's never a good day when Barcelona are two points behind Real Madrid.\n12:11 Comment: If you support this club...\n12:15 Comment: ...the club is.\n12:21 Comment: Suarez.\n12:27 Comment: Neymar has hardly had a kick at the ball so far.\n12:32 Comment: Here's Xavi.\n12:34 Comment: To Rakitic.\n12:35 Comment: Maybe Barcelona feel they can just click into gear at will.\n12:41 Comment: Rakitic again.\n12:43 Comment: Alba with space.\n12:45 Comment: They're not blessed with tall players in the centre so they try to take the low route.\n12:50 Comment: Silasen.\n12:51 Comment: Does he have a challenger for those kinds of catches?\n13:0 Comment: It's a timely challenge by Veltman on Neymar.\n13:2 Comment: Although I thought Neymar made the wrong choice with his touch.\n13:5 Comment: Taking him towards the Ajax defender.\n13:8 Comment: He's probably got Neymar running at him with the ball in the 18-yard box.\n13:11 Comment: But a really good challenge by Veltman.\n13:19 Comment: Guardiola.\n13:20 Comment: I saw the pass which was Eiffel Gazi.\n13:26 Comment: And Xavi.\n13:27 Comment: His 144th appearance in the Champions League.\n13:35 Comment: Alves.\n13:36 Comment: Suarez.\n13:43 Comment: And a goal.\n13:45 Comment: Well, I think the two teams are familiar with each other but it's been a timid start by both sides.\n14:0 Comment: Nobody yet willing to take a major chance.\n14:4 Comment: Electrified again.\n14:6 Comment: Challenge from behind by Boisenda.\n14:9 Comment: Boisenda.\n14:13 Comment: I actually think the Hanks are taking a little bit of a leap in the opening.\n14:16 Comment: Almost 15 minutes.\n14:18 Comment: First five minutes as you'd expect from Barcelona.\n14:22 Comment: A quick pass in.\n14:23 Comment: Xavi on the ball.\n14:26 Comment: Slowly but surely the Hanks are making more than even a fair.\n14:40 Comment: Suarez.\n14:43 Comment: Suarez going to be drawn that long distance centre forward to join Barcelona and end up\n14:47 Comment: slightly disgruntled that they're playing on the wing.\n14:53 Comment: The ball inside by...\n14:56 Comment: ...Torsen.\n14:58 Comment: Often comes a man who hasn't truly entered the Barcelona penalty area so far.\n15:2 Comment: Ajax.\n15:6 Comment: Here's Rakitic.\n15:7 Comment: Here's Rakitic who's broken from his midfield role and tidying up.\n15:16 Comment: He's sat down.\n15:20 Comment: Valerian.\n15:24 Comment: This is Barcelona pressing now, trying to push Ajax back.\n15:29 Comment: Here's Zeverikay off the bench.\n15:32 Comment: Attempting to stir his players up.\n15:34 Comment: De Boer.\n15:36 Comment: Nervously heads back to a seat alongside Dennis Bergkamp.\n15:43 Comment: The fact that Xavi is the one instigating the high pressing game suggests that that\n15:47 Comment: is the instruction from Luis Enrique.\n15:51 Comment: Three forwards for Barcelona.\n15:52 Comment: I'm not prepared to do that.\n15:53 Comment: I'm not sure how to do it.\n15:54 Comment: Neymar.\n15:56 Comment: Rakitic has made a brilliant run.\n15:57 Comment: Well, trying to pass on the responsibility.\n15:59 Comment: I suppose that is the temptation when you look up and you see Messi, Suarez and Neymar\n16:4 Comment: anticipating a pass.\n16:6 Comment: They choose not to be greedy.\n16:9 Comment: Sometimes greed is good.\n16:11 Comment: I think Luis Suarez has been guilty in his first two games of playing a little bit too polite.\n16:16 Comment: Instead of being the love he was when he was at Liverpool and Ajax and being quite, I wouldn't\n16:20 Comment: say selfish, but single-minded when it comes to finishing off chances, going direct to a goal.\n16:25 Comment: He's been looking up in a polite way, trying to find Messi, trying to find Neymar.\n16:31 Comment: He's a dilemma for Luis Enrique.\n16:33 Comment: You see Neymar on the right side now.\n16:35 Comment: He has to get the balance right with the front three.\n16:44 Comment: So they're not playing a pretty dangerous game.\n16:50 Comment: We talk about total football for Ajax and they're playing it from the back.\n16:53 Comment: Now El Ghazi.\n16:55 Comment: Dwarfing his marker, Alba.\n16:57 Comment: He's passed it.\n16:58 Comment: He's passed it, runs into Mascherano.\n17:1 Comment: As well to keep the ball out.\n17:3 Comment: Dani Alves with a timid clearance.\n17:6 Comment: And Ter Stegen watches the shots of Lucas Anderson go awfully close.\n17:10 Comment: Brilliant football.\n17:11 Comment: Good hard pressing from Barcelona but Ajax stick to their principles.\n17:15 Comment: They've got their way out, works it up the pitch.\n17:18 Comment: It's a decent effort from Lucas Anderson and Ter Stegen has it covered.\n17:22 Comment: And Guy's falling to his post.\n17:25 Comment: A terrific play from the young likes too.\n17:27 Comment: Especially Sarrero.\n17:29 Comment: They've been cheered on.\n17:30 Comment: There is Anderson.\n17:32 Comment: El Ghazi drops the shoulder.\n17:35 Comment: Falls to the floor.\n17:36 Comment: The referee ably placed to tick him off.\n17:41 Comment: He was booked earlier on.\n17:43 Comment: He's maybe a little bit cautious.\n17:44 Comment: The referee hasn't seemed fit to caution him there for simulation.\n17:55 Comment: Best inclination.\n17:56 Comment: It was a dive.\n17:57 Comment: He would normally pick up a yellow card.\n18:0 Comment: It would have been Haas.\n18:1 Comment: Because of the first yellow.\n18:2 Comment: It would have been El Ghazi.\n18:3 Comment: They're looking quite worried anyway.\n18:5 Comment: Taken very quickly by Barcelona.\n18:7 Comment: Not allowing Ajax to sit back or to readjust.\n18:11 Comment: Neymar back on his feet.\n18:13 Comment: Look, he has three prowling around him.\n18:17 Comment: Jordi Alba.\n18:19 Comment: Mascherano.\n18:25 Comment: Alves.\n18:35 Comment: A free-held whistle.\n18:37 Comment: Advantage is taken by Luis Suarez.\n18:39 Comment: Enters the penalty.\n18:40 Comment: Everybody knows well from his days as an Ajax player.\n18:44 Comment: Orlis Sinclairs.\n18:48 Comment: It's been a very laid-back start from Barcelona.\n18:51 Comment: Suarez.\n18:53 Comment: Lionel Messi.\n18:54 Comment: Neymar.\n18:55 Comment: Teases it up for Messi.\n18:57 Comment: Messi can't quite take it into his tiny stride.\n19:1 Comment: All good here for Ajax.\n19:3 Comment: Simonsson.\n19:5 Comment: Screaming for the ball.\n19:6 Comment: To poor Clarence and Veltman.\n19:12 Comment: Xavi.\n19:18 Comment: Thomas Lemann trying to increase the heat on Ajax.\n19:22 Comment: Messi.\n19:24 Comment: Suarez.\n19:27 Comment: Alves.\n19:32 Comment: Rakitic.\n19:37 Comment: All 11 Ajax players back behind the ball.\n19:41 Comment: Mascherano.\n19:44 Comment: Kewpess.\n19:45 Comment: Alba couldn't control it.\n19:53 Comment: Now Bartra.\n19:54 Comment: The surprise inclusion for Barcelona tonight.\n19:58 Comment: Good ball from him.\n20:0 Comment: Jordi Alba.\n20:4 Comment: Intense concentration being kept by Ajax.\n20:7 Comment: Heads the 0-0 scoreline.\n20:11 Comment: Almost looks like Barcelona have been stirred into action since that near-miss from Anderson.\n20:15 Comment: Play in the attacking half of the pitch now for Barcelona.\n20:18 Comment: All the Ajax players back behind the ball.\n20:21 Comment: And Darze and Shona on defensive duties.\n20:24 Comment: Sigtorsen being slightly left isolated up front.\n20:29 Comment: Rakitic.\n20:31 Comment: It's a great defence putting ball.\n20:34 Comment: Van Rinklares.\n20:35 Comment: Two were offside but not Neymar who the pass was intended for.\n20:40 Comment: Now Messi.\n20:42 Comment: Easy for Boylisson.\n20:49 Comment: Sigtorsen.\n20:52 Comment: Lovely ball to Van Rink.\n20:53 Comment: Alba stands his ground.\n20:58 Comment: Ricardo Van Rink.\n21:0 Comment: And the ball is in.\n21:2 Comment: And it's in.\n21:8 Comment: Ricardo Van Rink.\n21:10 Comment: To Shona.\n21:12 Comment: Now there's a spring in the step of the left side.\n21:15 Comment: Brilliant run.\n21:16 Comment: He was just willing somebody to foul him in the area there, Lucas Anderson.\n21:20 Comment: But Barcelona kept their cool.\n21:21 Comment: Lionel Messi.\n21:24 Comment: Neymar.\n21:25 Comment: Had gone just a step or two too early.\n21:29 Comment: It's been a brilliant passage of play.\n21:31 Comment: We did have a stoppage for about three or four minutes.\n21:33 Comment: And both teams showing great technical qualities.\n21:36 Comment: Neymar has to do better than that.\n21:39 Comment: Can't just make that run in there and hope.\n21:41 Comment: You have to make sure you're onside.\n21:42 Comment: Half a pitch to run into.\n21:44 Comment: More pace than the defender.\n21:47 Comment: You should have done better there, Neymar.\n21:51 Comment: And a wonderful game of football.\n21:54 Comment: With the emphasis on the football.\n21:57 Comment: Pure passing.\n21:59 Comment: The team has followed imagination.\n22:6 Comment: Free warm scoreline in the first game.\n22:8 Comment: Didn't tell the whole story.\n22:10 Comment: Marsler didn't have that.\n22:12 Comment: Bit of a scare later on when Luis Enrique\n22:15 Comment: threw on some of the youngsters.\n22:17 Comment: Took off the big names with\n22:19 Comment: El Gran Classico in mind.\n22:24 Comment: Marsler only got the third goal four minutes into stoppage time.\n22:29 Comment: Wilson.\n22:31 Comment: And he's got the ball.\n22:33 Comment: Wilson.\n22:35 Comment: Off the ball from Serrero.\n22:39 Comment: Shona.\n22:46 Comment: Well, he's the one player under Frank de Boer\n22:48 Comment: who's been given a little bit of a licence\n22:49 Comment: to roam about the pitch a little bit more freely.\n22:52 Comment: Sigtorsen is the centre forward.\n22:54 Comment: El Garc√≠a staying to the right side of attack.\n22:57 Comment: Shona is a player that likes to drift around.\n23:0 Comment: Not playing in the number 10 positions.\n23:2 Comment: Mainly on the left side.\n23:4 Comment: When they're out of possession.\n23:5 Comment: When they're in possession, he can drift about\n23:7 Comment: find little bits of space.\n23:10 Comment: He has an eye for goal.\n23:11 Comment: A player at Barcelona has to be aware of.\n23:17 Comment: Alves.\n23:23 Comment: It's an interesting reception that the Ajax supporters\n23:25 Comment: have given to Luis Su√°rez.\n23:26 Comment: There's no booing.\n23:28 Comment: No turning on their former player.\n23:29 Comment: But they're enjoying it when he's been to the ball\n23:31 Comment: by one of their defenders.\n23:44 Comment: Ajax really in need of a win to keep their chances\n23:47 Comment: in advancing alive.\n23:52 Comment: Last season they finished third in the group\n23:54 Comment: as they did in 2012 when they were drawn with\n23:57 Comment: Real Madrid and Lyon.\n24:2 Comment: Last time they made it out of the group stages\n24:5 Comment: was back in 2005-2006.\n24:8 Comment: They got to the round of 16.\n24:11 Comment: What is this young team capable of?\n24:14 Comment: Defending by Bertrand.\n24:18 Comment: Mascherano.\n24:32 Comment: Serrero.\n24:36 Comment: Deltman.\n24:39 Comment: Moisander.\n24:47 Comment: Abuelas.\n24:50 Comment: A game of patience being played here.\n24:52 Comment: Waiting for Barcelona to maybe lose their shape.\n24:55 Comment: Sigtorsson lays it on.\n24:58 Comment: Now Anderson.\n24:59 Comment: Can he go left or right?\n25:1 Comment: It's a long way around to try and get a shot on goal.\n25:6 Comment: Try a foul ball but certainly came off the rear\n25:8 Comment: of the Barcelona defender.\n25:12 Comment: Serrero.\n25:14 Comment: A good period of pressure this from Ajax.\n25:18 Comment: Klaassen puts it into a dangerous area\n25:20 Comment: but it has to be said, brilliant defending\n25:22 Comment: by Jordi Alba.\n25:30 Comment: Now Barca, poor clearance.\n25:33 Comment: Charged down by Mascherano.\n25:37 Comment: And they crack the Barcelona code here.\n25:38 Comment: Excellent football in Ter Stegen.\n25:41 Comment: A tidy stop to keep out Klaassen.\n25:46 Comment: By far the best chance of the game so far.\n25:53 Comment: This Ajax, they're setting the pace.\n25:55 Comment: Absolutely brilliant.\n25:58 Comment: Slightly uncertain in the first few minutes of the game\n26:0 Comment: but they're grinding stature, they're grinding belief.\n26:5 Comment: Some good attempts on goal.\n26:6 Comment: The crowd are on their feet, enjoying every single minute\n26:8 Comment: of this match.\n26:10 Comment: It's now Barcelona on the back foot.\n26:13 Comment: David Klaassen goes for the one-two,\n26:14 Comment: ends up with a dip in left foot volley.\n26:17 Comment: A tidy save from Ter Stegen.\n26:22 Comment: Gliding football from Ajax.\n26:24 Comment: Chavis.\n26:28 Comment: Suarez, caught in possession, gives the ball away.\n26:32 Comment: Alba to the rescue once more for Barcelona\n26:34 Comment: with El Ghazi flying in at speed.\n26:44 Comment: Barcelona have had nine clean sheets so far this season\n26:47 Comment: in the 13 games they've played\n26:49 Comment: and they're having to rely on their defensive stability\n26:52 Comment: at the moment.\n27:2 Comment: Great ball.\n27:8 Comment: El Ghazi, when he'd beaten the first man,\n27:10 Comment: needed a bit more strength and maybe a little bit more belief\n27:13 Comment: in his own abilities.\n27:16 Comment: Here's Dani Alves, he's not short of belief.\n27:23 Comment: Back to Moisander to Silisson.\n27:28 Comment: I don't think we're going to see either of these goalkeepers\n27:30 Comment: poof the ball out of their hands during the course of this evening.\n27:34 Comment: They're going to caress the ball 40 yards like that, though.\n27:39 Comment: Past Lerner.\n27:41 Comment: And forward through Rakitic.\n27:44 Comment: Now Lionel Messi.\n27:47 Comment: Are these front three players being too polite?\n27:50 Comment: Maybe you have to be a little more greedy, Terry.\n27:53 Comment: Yeah, I just think that the system doesn't suit them at the moment.\n27:56 Comment: Suarez just filled in as Dani Alves went forward,\n27:59 Comment: as right back, he's standing in the right back position.\n28:2 Comment: He looks like he's labouring at the moment,\n28:4 Comment: I'm not sure whether it's an injury or just\n28:6 Comment: he can't get enough air into his lungs.\n28:8 Comment: Lack of playing time over the recent months.\n28:11 Comment: But he's having to think, he's not playing on instinct,\n28:13 Comment: he's having to think about his position in the team\n28:15 Comment: as a right-sided midfield player, almost.\n28:18 Comment: I still think they should play Messi off of Neymar and Suarez\n28:22 Comment: and give Messi that freedom to play wherever he wants.\n28:26 Comment: Suarez brilliantly turns his man.\n28:30 Comment: Maybe the deflection from George Edmond.\n28:33 Comment: He looks a completely different animal in that centre-forward position, doesn't he?\n28:36 Comment: He doesn't have to think, it's all on instinct.\n28:38 Comment: It's a natural play from Luis Suarez.\n28:40 Comment: He's playing on the right side of the midfield.\n28:42 Comment: You see the attempts from distance and appeals for a penalty.\n28:45 Comment: Half-hearted appeals, I think, from Van Nistelrijks.\n28:48 Comment: He's always travelling at some speed, isn't he?\n28:51 Comment: Difficult one for the referee in a split second to judge whether it's a deliberate handball\n28:55 Comment: or whether it's actually a handball.\n29:2 Comment: The fans don't have no-hands advantage, we say that every week.\n29:6 Comment: So they need some imagination from the other players.\n29:10 Comment: They need set-pieces.\n29:13 Comment: Alves.\n29:15 Comment: Overhits it.\n29:16 Comment: A bit of a panic in the Ajax defence.\n29:20 Comment: Messi. Across the six.\n29:22 Comment: Simonsson scoops it out.\n29:25 Comment: Clearance completed by Andersen.\n29:29 Comment: Mascherano is the stay-at-home defender back to Stegen.\n29:40 Comment: Suarez.\n29:42 Comment: Alves.\n29:43 Comment: To Busquets.\n29:47 Comment: Messi.\n29:52 Comment: Messi threads it through.\n29:54 Comment: Albers made the run.\n29:56 Comment: Excellent angles by Silisson.\n29:57 Comment: Studies ground.\n29:59 Comment: Simonson.\n30:1 Comment: He's got it.\n30:7 Comment: Excellent angles by Silisson.\n30:8 Comment: Studies ground.\n30:10 Comment: Top-class goalkeeping from a Dutch number one.\n30:13 Comment: Good football all round, isn't it?\n30:15 Comment: Great pass from Messi, great movement from Jordi Haaland.\n30:17 Comment: Super goalkeeping from Silisson.\n30:26 Comment: So much to enjoy in this game, isn't it?\n30:27 Comment: The technique, the skills of both sets of players.\n30:30 Comment: There's not one player out there who's not comfortable on the ball.\n30:34 Comment: They're working hard to try and deny each other.\n30:36 Comment: The closing down is superb from both teams.\n30:41 Comment: It means that skilled players have to make sure they're first touched.\n30:45 Comment: It's absolutely perfect.\n30:47 Comment: That's been the case for the majority of this first half.\n30:51 Comment: Javi.\n30:53 Comment: Great adjustment from Jordi Haaland.\n30:58 Comment: This Barcelona team just needs a little bit of fine-tuning.\n31:3 Comment: Look at that for the goalkeeper.\n31:4 Comment: Kept his ground.\n31:6 Comment: Tremendous keeping from Silisson.\n31:10 Comment: There's no luck about that, was there?\n31:11 Comment: He read the attempt from Albert to the near post.\n31:15 Comment: Stuck out his right foot.\n31:33 Comment: El Ghazi.\n31:35 Comment: Face to face with Jordi Haaland.\n31:40 Comment: Javi had a nibble.\n31:41 Comment: Albert kicks away.\n31:44 Comment: They all look surprised when Ajax get the decision.\n31:50 Comment: The Barcelona players claim is that El Ghazi has the ball stuck in between his legs.\n31:56 Comment: I still don't think there's enough reason there for him to do that.\n31:59 Comment: A cheap set-piece to go away, isn't it?\n32:9 Comment: Javi as captain, of course, is able to ask the referee for his interpretation of the situation.\n32:18 Comment: The referee is not happy with the way the game has gone.\n32:21 Comment: It's not a good game.\n32:31 Comment: Ajax certainly have a height advantage.\n32:34 Comment: Two central defenders have come up from the back.\n32:36 Comment: Veltman and Moisander.\n32:39 Comment: Trying to find some space.\n32:43 Comment: Moisander is doing the tango with Dani Alves.\n32:50 Comment: Here he comes.\n32:52 Comment: I have to say, he was good defending too.\n32:55 Comment: And now, though, Gazi has gone down, trying to draw the referee's attention.\n32:59 Comment: It's a rather theatrical fall in there.\n33:3 Comment: Ter Stegen shows no sympathy for the Ajax striker.\n33:7 Comment: Barcelona attack is up to the referee, of course, to stop the play.\n33:12 Comment: There's Neymar.\n33:13 Comment: He's taken down in full flight.\n33:15 Comment: And now the referee will become focus of the attention of the players and the angry Ajax supporters.\n33:22 Comment: Schur is trying to make the point that it's a head injury.\n33:25 Comment: This was so predictable that Veltman was going to do it.\n33:27 Comment: Barcelona don't kick the ball out.\n33:30 Comment: Ajax think it's unsportsmanlike behaviour.\n33:34 Comment: Veltman just takes down Neymar.\n33:37 Comment: It was an awkward collision at the other end from the set-piece.\n33:39 Comment: There's a couple of Barcelona players.\n33:41 Comment: El Ghazi was involved in that little bumping.\n33:44 Comment: It was accidental.\n33:49 Comment: It's the player who almost gets on the end of the cross.\n33:51 Comment: And he just misses out.\n33:53 Comment: Maybe a shirt-pull from Jordi Alba.\n33:55 Comment: It's a collision.\n33:57 Comment: Neymar's boot does come up and strike the forehead of El Ghazi.\n34:1 Comment: You can see a little mark on his forehead.\n34:5 Comment: The referee chose the player.\n34:6 Comment: The break was on for Barcelona.\n34:8 Comment: And it was predictable that Ajax were going to bring them down before they got to the penalty box.\n34:13 Comment: He's back in position now. El Ghazi.\n34:15 Comment: Shoot option for the team.\n34:17 Comment: It's a really similar face to him.\n34:20 Comment: But Joel Veltman will miss the next game against Paris Saint-Germain.\n34:31 Comment: I don't know if it's a wise thing to put a player who's just been claiming he's had a head injury 90 yards up the field as your central brick in the wall.\n34:43 Comment: I'm in for it.\n34:45 Comment: He's making a big deal here, isn't he?\n34:47 Comment: The referee, like you saw, their arm's in the right position.\n34:49 Comment: He's going to obviously be looking for a handball.\n34:55 Comment: Lionel Messi is on the verge of a European record.\n35:0 Comment: Messi trips him in there and the men will save him.\n35:3 Comment: Sillerson again.\n35:4 Comment: A cross to Neymar.\n35:6 Comment: There's a little bit of ball juggling in his own time.\n35:10 Comment: Alves over the top.\n35:13 Comment: Sillerson comes a long way.\n35:15 Comment: He's stolen off him by Barca.\n35:17 Comment: Messi heads it towards goal.\n35:19 Comment: Not the tidiest goal that Lionel Messi's ever going to score.\n35:24 Comment: But the edges to win one of Raul's Champions League record.\n35:30 Comment: And Sillerson, the keeper, must take some of the blame.\n35:32 Comment: I think he takes the majority of the blame.\n35:34 Comment: It's a decent set piece from Messi.\n35:37 Comment: Sillerson, the fast laner, keeps the ball in the danger area.\n35:41 Comment: You do have to believe here.\n35:43 Comment: Messi's offside.\n35:44 Comment: The player who eventually scores the goal.\n35:46 Comment: Barca goes up with the goalkeeper.\n35:48 Comment: Doesn't give it up.\n35:49 Comment: Sillerson makes the mistake.\n35:50 Comment: Barca hooks it back into the box.\n35:52 Comment: Messi outjumps the bigger, stronger defenders.\n35:55 Comment: And somehow finds the back of the net.\n36:2 Comment: Lionel Messi's 70th goal.\n36:5 Comment: In Champions League football in 90 matches.\n36:13 Comment: Just for the record, his last hat-trick in the Champions League\n36:16 Comment: was September last season against Ajax.\n36:24 Comment: That's five, the play's up.\n36:29 Comment: Of course, the free kick coming as a result.\n36:31 Comment: The fast laner counter-attack.\n36:33 Comment: When Ajax had a man down in the fast-learner penalty area.\n36:44 Comment: Serrero.\n36:48 Comment: Olesen.\n36:52 Comment: Anderson.\n36:57 Comment: Serrero's making things happen in midfield.\n36:59 Comment: Boca with a header.\n37:1 Comment: There's an arm being lifted upon him.\n37:5 Comment: The whistle's aimed at the Portuguese referee.\n37:14 Comment: It was a high-bit for the City Torsen.\n37:16 Comment: The nature of the goal.\n37:18 Comment: 75 for supporters up.\n37:19 Comment: It's 5-0 Ajax team up as well.\n37:22 Comment: Still believe strongly that the fast laner should have kicked the ball out.\n37:26 Comment: Which resulted in the free kick.\n37:27 Comment: But there was some considerable play after that, wasn't there?\n37:31 Comment: This is encouraging for El Ghazi, who went down a few moments ago.\n37:36 Comment: With a head injury.\n37:38 Comment: And of course, if there's any doubt,\n37:40 Comment: the referee's going to instruct them to take him off.\n37:46 Comment: A call for the medical men.\n37:58 Comment: For the moment, it's going to be 10-0 because\n38:1 Comment: Jordi Alvarez\n38:3 Comment: came to have some treatment\n38:5 Comment: but not to his ankle.\n38:8 Comment: It can't be that serious because every arm who would be the obvious replacement\n38:12 Comment: is still sitting wrapped up on the third row\n38:15 Comment: of the Barcelona bench.\n38:27 Comment: It's tough on Ajax to be the goal behind.\n38:29 Comment: Not your usual Barcelona type goal, is it?\n38:33 Comment: Good determination shown from Bartra initially\n38:35 Comment: to not give it up when it would have been an easy catch for Silisson.\n38:40 Comment: Still amazed at this. He somehow managed to get it past the goal.\n38:42 Comment: Was that an attempt from van Rijn on the goal line?\n38:47 Comment: He didn't look like he had enough power to find the back of the net\n38:49 Comment: but somehow he did.\n38:55 Comment: Bartra.\n38:57 Comment: Oh, that's messy.\n38:58 Comment: That's what he did in the clash.\n39:0 Comment: What a very loose challenge from Moisander.\n39:4 Comment: Another one who's\n39:6 Comment: taking risks. He follows Veltman\n39:9 Comment: and El Guardi to the referee's\n39:11 Comment: little black book.\n39:16 Comment: That's a nicely challenged, that.\n39:18 Comment: The referee in a good position.\n39:21 Comment: There was a little deflection of the referee, wasn't there?\n39:23 Comment: In that little bit of play.\n39:28 Comment: They've put the helmet themselves down, Ajax.\n39:37 Comment: The captain of Finland.\n39:40 Comment: And of course the captain of Ajax.\n39:43 Comment: Moisander's in trouble. This is Cech.\n39:46 Comment: Neymar.\n39:57 Comment: How many times over the years have we said\n39:58 Comment: they have a little messy goal\n39:59 Comment: and it's between the two sides?\n40:3 Comment: 70 times.\n40:13 Comment: I could say 408 times\n40:14 Comment: because that's how many times\n40:15 Comment: he's scored in his career.\n40:17 Comment: And he's got to be careful\n40:18 Comment: not to get too close to the goal.\n40:20 Comment: He's got to be careful\n40:21 Comment: not to get too close to the goal.\n40:23 Comment: He's got to be careful\n40:24 Comment: not to get too close to the goal.\n40:25 Comment: 408 goals he's scored in his career\n40:27 Comment: for club and country.\n40:28 Comment: 408 goals.\n40:30 Comment: I think it was 408.\n40:31 Comment: I know it was there or thereabouts.\n40:39 Comment: Giuliano.\n40:40 Comment: To Neymar.\n40:46 Comment: A touch too tactile\n40:47 Comment: for the referee's eye.\n40:52 Comment: It's a little bit too tight here,\n40:53 Comment: doesn't it?\n40:54 Comment: assists with the niggling challenges from behind.\n41:1 Comment: Messi.\n41:2 Comment: I believe.\n41:4 Comment: I believe a defender's in his wake.\n41:7 Comment: Rakitic.\n41:10 Comment: Messi.\n41:14 Comment: There's a nervous moment for two.\n41:17 Comment: Set to half, I think Jordi Alba, if the referee is\n41:21 Comment: going to be consistent, he's going to show the card.\n41:30 Comment: He pulls his possession there to Klu Klux now from Klaassen.\n41:34 Comment: No need to do that.\n41:35 Comment: I mean, they're still so far away from the goal, aren't they?\n41:37 Comment: It's not as if he's, there's an obvious counter attack on.\n41:40 Comment: Just stand your feet, chase the player back.\n41:42 Comment: He's a quick player, Jordi Alba.\n41:50 Comment: I need to look to their older, more experienced players.\n41:58 Comment: There aren't many of them.\n42:0 Comment: Very young side.\n42:1 Comment: Messi inside Suarez.\n42:3 Comment: He'll turn loose ball very quickly.\n42:5 Comment: Xavi to Neymar.\n42:9 Comment: Second goal of the half time could destroy Ajax.\n42:15 Comment: Neymar.\n42:21 Comment: The boy missing his down.\n42:23 Comment: It's with Berton Neymar, I think he was slowly played down,\n42:25 Comment: trying to draw to the referee's attention there.\n42:30 Comment: Now will his teammates stop play to allow him to receive treatment\n42:34 Comment: or is he just trying to bring to the referee's attention\n42:37 Comment: a strong challenge if this gets...\n42:39 Comment: Yeah, I don't think there's anything wrong there.\n42:41 Comment: We've got a significant setback.\n42:42 Comment: He was up and I think, in my view,\n42:44 Comment: I think he was trying to draw the referee's attention.\n42:51 Comment: It's a test of the sportsmanship of the Burs team.\n42:58 Comment: Mascherano.\n43:1 Comment: Teres Degan has made one tidy save in the first half.\n43:6 Comment: Suarez.\n43:9 Comment: Van Rijn.\n43:14 Comment: Sarrasini.\n43:15 Comment: Brilliant save from Breaking.\n43:18 Comment: But then a dreadful mistake.\n43:21 Comment: A bit to give Barca over the goal.\n43:35 Comment: Teres Degan, the goalkeeper, throwing a dummy\n43:37 Comment: and then delivering a fine 45-yard pass.\n43:41 Comment: It's the modern game, isn't it?\n43:42 Comment: We're looking at the statistics and...\n43:45 Comment: Silisson.\n43:46 Comment: But here is Neymar taking on off-comers.\n43:48 Comment: Brilliant tackle by Velden.\n43:52 Comment: Silisson, in the first two games of the competition, Terry,\n43:55 Comment: covered 10 kilometres.\n43:58 Comment: That's the modern-day goalkeeper for you.\n44:2 Comment: Two of the brightest young goalkeepers in the world.\n44:5 Comment: He's a youngster, he's a youngster.\n44:8 Comment: Two of the brightest young goalkeepers as well.\n44:11 Comment: Great skill from Neymar, one of the brightest young players\n44:13 Comment: in world football.\n44:15 Comment: An excellent challenge from Veltman.\n44:18 Comment: To deny the Brazilian.\n44:21 Comment: A remarkable thing with Teres Degan is he's two-footed as well.\n44:24 Comment: So he'll do that left foot and right foot.\n44:33 Comment: Lionel Messi.\n44:38 Comment: And supporters whistling.\n44:41 Comment: The first half to be brought to an end.\n44:48 Comment: Daniel Alves.\n44:51 Comment: He's doubly angry.\n44:52 Comment: First of all, he thought he got the ball, and secondly,\n44:54 Comment: he didn't think it was worthy of a yellow card.\n44:59 Comment: But he does get the ball, and the question is,\n45:0 Comment: does he go through the back of Sch√ºrrle to get the ball?\n45:3 Comment: And he probably just sticks his foot through his legs.\n45:4 Comment: There might be in the...\n45:6 Comment: Yes, OK, it's a foul, it's a challenge from behind.\n45:8 Comment: But is that worthy of a yellow?\n45:9 Comment: No, I don't think any of them have been...\n45:11 Comment: Oh, no, there's been one or two obvious yellow cards, isn't there?\n45:16 Comment: One from Moissan at the chase back, I think.\n45:20 Comment: Jordi Alves tugged on the jersey as well.\n45:22 Comment: It was an obvious yellow card.\n45:26 Comment: One minute added.\n45:34 Comment: And supporters raise their voices,\n45:36 Comment: hoping the players can raise their games.\n45:40 Comment: And behind that, Boilesen.\n45:43 Comment: Rakitic, he's had a quiet first half.\n45:49 Comment: A lot of positives for Ajax,\n45:51 Comment: as the game is advanced by a lot.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: I'm not quite sure whether a rendition of a Bob Marley hit is going to stare the Ajax players into action in the second half.\n0:10 Comment: But they now need to find their rhythm to beat this Messi-inspired Barcelona team.\n0:18 Comment: Any chances of advancement slipping away from the Dutch champions?\n0:24 Comment: In need of inspiration, as El Ghazi had his moments in the first half.\n0:30 Comment: Is Enrique down on the touchline firing his players up?\n0:34 Comment: He knows that the adjurable side Ajax they took it of course into stoppage time when they went to the Nou Camp a few weeks ago.\n0:47 Comment: They don't want to go out of the Champions League at the group stages yet again.\n0:51 Comment: Seem to perennially finish third in the groups.\n0:53 Comment: It's a big night for Ajax. Lots of young players. Don't play with any fear.\n0:59 Comment: I thought they were apprehensive in the first five or ten minutes of the game.\n1:2 Comment: But they're a youthful bunch. So they'll go in the full 90 minutes.\n1:6 Comment: As long as they're in this game, they'll go and get the next goal.\n1:10 Comment: It's still a chance for Ajax to get something from this type.\n1:17 Comment: It's a tough group though for Ajax against Barcelona and PSG.\n1:53 Comment: A goalkeeper in terms of being an outfield player, he'll make mistakes.\n1:57 Comment: That's going to be the commentator's curse now, don't you think?\n2:3 Comment: Luis Suarez still seeking his first goal for Barcelona.\n2:8 Comment: Lionel Messi.\n2:12 Comment: Taking himself into double figures for the season. Threads it for Suarez.\n2:17 Comment: Winning the battle. This is Marco Werdman.\n2:21 Comment: The problem for Ajax is the two central defenders.\n2:26 Comment: Werdman and Moissan, both on a yellow card.\n2:33 Comment: Werdman was sent off in the corresponding fixture last season, wasn't he?\n2:36 Comment: So I'm sure it is going through his mind.\n2:42 Comment: Busquets.\n2:51 Comment: It's not very often you see Barcelona outpatched in a game.\n2:56 Comment: That's a terrible header from Van Rijn. Gives the corner away for no reason whatsoever.\n3:5 Comment: Difficult header, wasn't it? To find his way back to his goalkeeper, Cillessen, from Ricardo Van Rijn.\n3:21 Comment: That's the view for Xabi Hernandez.\n3:25 Comment: He flies it towards a penalty spot.\n3:29 Comment: Mascherano.\n3:32 Comment: Correao.\n3:40 Comment: Alves.\n3:51 Comment: Barcelona using the full expanse of the Amsterdam Arena.\n3:59 Comment: Now Alba, quick into the pace.\n4:2 Comment: Neymar.\n4:5 Comment: Nice touch. Neymar gets through the two defenders, somehow tries to sneak it on the blind side of the keeper.\n4:14 Comment: Here's a referee, might have given the free kick against Neymar.\n4:16 Comment: Not sure why though, I mean he's two defenders up against him, he does put his arms out but he's pushed and bumped by both of those defenders.\n4:29 Comment: I think he's the best man in the circle when they play big in the middle as well.\n4:31 Comment: It could be the answer to their centre-back problems if Claudio Bravo kicks him out of the team, that's for much longer.\n4:37 Comment: Claudio Bravo, the other goalkeeper's useful.\n4:39 Comment: If I remember, he actually scored a goal in his Real Sociedad days.\n4:42 Comment: A winning free kick in the second division.\n4:47 Comment: Against Gymnastic.\n4:52 Comment: Brilliant movement from the back from Barcelona.\n4:55 Comment: Suarez makes his move, draws the defender.\n5:0 Comment: But Veltman has just been a little bit sharper than Luis Suarez in his third game for Barcelona.\n5:6 Comment: He's first in the Champions League of course.\n5:9 Comment: Mascherano.\n5:11 Comment: Alves.\n5:14 Comment: Football played with ease from Barcelona.\n5:16 Comment: Rakitic fires it across.\n5:18 Comment: Van der Rijn, taking no risks.\n5:22 Comment: Van den Loop.\n5:24 Comment: Van der Loop.\n5:35 Comment: Suarez.\n5:38 Comment: Finding it a bit easier, aren't they, Barcelona, in the second half to put their way through.\n5:44 Comment: Good fielding to attack with a bit more space.\n5:52 Comment: Mascherano.\n5:55 Comment: Marc Bartra.\n5:58 Comment: Le Paul.\n5:59 Comment: Suarez.\n6:1 Comment: As you can see, still struggling for that match fitness.\n6:6 Comment: Van der Loop.\n6:11 Comment: Najat's insistent on playing the ball out from deep in defence.\n6:15 Comment: It's been too successful as the game has progressed.\n6:21 Comment: Sigtorsson runs into a maze.\n6:24 Comment: Frustrating for our leading scorer.\n6:28 Comment: He's had a few chances tonight.\n6:29 Comment: Now he jostles into position in the penalty area.\n6:35 Comment: Serrero.\n6:37 Comment: Delgazi.\n6:47 Comment: Orlisson cheaply gives the ball away.\n6:50 Comment: There's Rakitic.\n6:54 Comment: Serrero.\n6:56 Comment: Demayax regain their belief.\n7:1 Comment: Well, the passing has just let them down.\n7:4 Comment: It's their trademark, of course.\n7:12 Comment: Here's the trademark from Messi, beating defenders.\n7:15 Comment: Looks pleading at the referee.\n7:16 Comment: Ball keeps rolling.\n7:18 Comment: Messi gets another chance to run.\n7:20 Comment: Chani.\n7:22 Comment: Alves.\n7:24 Comment: Oisit to the far post where Neymar is waiting for any bits and pieces.\n7:34 Comment: Delgazi.\n7:35 Comment: Gifts it to Mascherano.\n7:43 Comment: Delgazi does well there.\n7:44 Comment: A little bit of skill, not the first we've seen from him this evening.\n7:52 Comment: Serrero.\n7:54 Comment: Delgazi.\n7:56 Comment: Serrero.\n7:58 Comment: Delgazi.\n8:0 Comment: Serrero.\n8:8 Comment: That was a tall, talented player, Anwar El Ghazi.\n8:14 Comment: Plays for the under-21s.\n8:15 Comment: Not a very successful Dutch under-21 edition at the moment.\n8:19 Comment: They lost against Portugal in the playoffs for the Euros next summer.\n8:25 Comment: 5-4.\n8:26 Comment: 7-4 in aggregate.\n8:32 Comment: Busquets.\n8:36 Comment: Mascherano.\n8:40 Comment: Limping along there is Lassie Sch√∂rner.\n8:44 Comment: Who's just taken a knock.\n8:45 Comment: I think he needs attention.\n8:47 Comment: Just a case of running through the paint barrier.\n8:51 Comment: Again, it's not the first time we've seen Ben Ryan do that to Neymar this evening.\n8:54 Comment: He's getting away with it at the moment.\n8:55 Comment: No yellow card for the Dutch full-back.\n8:58 Comment: Paying really close attention to Neymar so far.\n9:0 Comment: So good for the Ajax number two.\n9:6 Comment: Busquets.\n9:9 Comment: Alba.\n9:10 Comment: Little teaser for Neymar.\n9:16 Comment: It's been a persistent fowler.\n9:19 Comment: Ricardo Van Rien.\n9:22 Comment: Persistent fowler, Ricardo Van Rien.\n9:28 Comment: The referee was throwing the cards around in the first half.\n9:34 Comment: I hope he's had a word with himself.\n9:37 Comment: Pedro Porzenko.\n9:43 Comment: Xavi.\n9:45 Comment: He's been a bit too much good defending by Moussa Ndoubou, sticking at his feet.\n9:52 Comment: Weltzmann.\n10:1 Comment: Xavi.\n10:6 Comment: Neymar, waiting for a gap to appear.\n10:9 Comment: Defenders stand off Messi and he couldn't quite find Neymar.\n10:13 Comment: Just bubbling under the surface for Barca at the moment.\n10:16 Comment: Alba committed men forwards here.\n10:18 Comment: But Stegen is way out of his area.\n10:23 Comment: There was a collision between Jordi Alba and El Ghazi.\n10:27 Comment: But maybe the referee believing that El Ghazi stood no chance of actually reaching the ball.\n10:35 Comment: Alba certainly wasn't doing anything to get out of the way of the tall winger.\n10:39 Comment: I think El Ghazi, there was play for the back.\n10:41 Comment: He's gone down once or twice on other occasions and a little bit too easily.\n10:45 Comment: Perhaps the referee didn't trust him on that one.\n10:48 Comment: Slightly surprised also, I have to say, that Messi had so much time on that and didn't turn and go for goal himself.\n10:53 Comment: I think he was a bit surprised himself at how much space he actually had before he laid the ball off to Neymar.\n11:1 Comment: Here's Messi.\n11:2 Comment: Xavi.\n11:5 Comment: Xavi flips it in towards Lionel Messi.\n11:8 Comment: Balls to Neymar.\n11:10 Comment: Defenders stay strong.\n11:15 Comment: Oh, listen, the left-back has come all the way across the backfoot.\n11:18 Comment: A little dishevelled at the moment, Ajax. Suarez tries to turn his man.\n11:28 Comment: Almost a man gone.\n11:29 Comment: I wonder if Luis Enrique is considering making change.\n11:35 Comment: Well, that was the collision.\n11:38 Comment: I think the first little part of the collision is El Ghazi.\n11:42 Comment: El Ghazi, but then Jordi Alba reacts and sticks a leg out and certainly trips him.\n11:49 Comment: An unpleasant reaction from Anwar El Ghazi.\n11:58 Comment: Sinked Orson.\n12:0 Comment: Cerrero.\n12:5 Comment: Now Boylis.\n12:7 Comment: Nice movement from Ajax. Can they stretch Barcelona?\n12:12 Comment: Boylis and continues. This is Shona.\n12:17 Comment: Closed down by Dani Alves. Shona slips the Brazilian marker.\n12:21 Comment: Nice lay-off. Excellent movement, this, from Ajax.\n12:23 Comment: Oh, they're out Barcelona-ing Barcelona here.\n12:26 Comment: But Jordi Alba to the rescue.\n12:29 Comment: That's happened several times at Barcelona tonight.\n12:31 Comment: But scintillating football.\n12:33 Comment: First time really that Shona has been influenced and attacked.\n12:36 Comment: Two occasions, he looked to his right, played the ball to his left, quick pass in.\n12:40 Comment: Cracking stuff for Ajax.\n12:44 Comment: Movement from Messi.\n12:46 Comment: Puskets.\n12:54 Comment: Rakitic.\n12:55 Comment: Going to get a run in the team if Iniesta continues to be a threat.\n12:59 Comment: Rakitic.\n13:0 Comment: Going to get a run in the team if Iniesta continues to struggle with the injury which has kept him out tonight.\n13:10 Comment: Mascherano.\n13:17 Comment: Puskets.\n13:18 Comment: Messi.\n13:19 Comment: Passed one, brilliantly to Luis Suarez.\n13:21 Comment: Massive chance for Suarez to get off the mark for Barcelona.\n13:25 Comment: But credit to the keeper.\n13:27 Comment: And Steven Lengelmessie can't score on the follow-up.\n13:32 Comment: Almost.\n13:34 Comment: But Suarez is getting warm-up.\n13:36 Comment: He should score, shouldn't he?\n13:38 Comment: That's the best chance of the game for either team.\n13:40 Comment: One-on-one versus the goalkeeper.\n13:42 Comment: Doesn't really sort his feet out, or get it out of his feet.\n13:44 Comment: Close control. Good save from Sinister.\n13:47 Comment: Messi tries to shape it in towards that far post with a bit of curl.\n13:52 Comment: Not to say good goalkeeping from the Ajax keeper.\n13:55 Comment: Frustration continues for Luis Suarez.\n14:4 Comment: Not going to finish the game off with less than an hour gone.\n14:9 Comment: I think a completely match fits Luis Suarez.\n14:12 Comment: May have scored the first time.\n14:13 Comment: May also have scored on the rebound that came back to him.\n14:19 Comment: But over 100 days out, his footballing reflexes are not at the sharpest.\n14:26 Comment: Good.\n14:40 Comment: Albert Neymar. Brilliant turn.\n14:45 Comment: All right, linking with him again.\n14:48 Comment: He surely has to be one challenge away from a caution now on the totting-up system.\n14:55 Comment: It is ridiculous when you see some of the offences the other players have been instantly booked for.\n15:3 Comment: He's getting away with it, I'm not so sure.\n15:5 Comment: Xavi is thinking along the same lines as us.\n15:21 Comment: A line drawn by the referee.\n15:25 Comment: A last free kick.\n15:27 Comment: 10 minutes before half-time.\n15:29 Comment: Barcelona fashioned a goal.\n15:41 Comment: Barcelona contempt to slow the game down to their walking pace.\n15:46 Comment: Look at that from Busquets, turned into the traffic.\n15:50 Comment: Neymar.\n15:52 Comment: Messi ahead of him.\n15:54 Comment: Screaming for the ball is Xavi.\n15:55 Comment: Trumpeter off for Cillessen.\n15:59 Comment: Great play from Busquets though, wasn't it?\n16:1 Comment: One of the reasons why he's one of the best in the world in that position.\n16:4 Comment: Prepared to receive the ball under pressure.\n16:6 Comment: Xavi.\n16:7 Comment: Decent strike.\n16:9 Comment: Strike to the goalkeeper Cillessen.\n16:12 Comment: In Sorrera, wasn't it, with the challenge?\n16:14 Comment: Busquets just shook him off and turned him quite easily.\n16:19 Comment: There's the danger. Step across, block the ball off.\n16:23 Comment: That was quite an art, wasn't it, from Busquets?\n16:25 Comment: Perfect shielding.\n16:27 Comment: Textbook shielding from the Spanish midfield man.\n16:31 Comment: He's been good tonight, Busquets. One or two critics.\n16:34 Comment: The last couple of games in particular he hasn't played particularly well.\n16:39 Comment: But at the top of his game tonight.\n16:44 Comment: Well, time to change.\n16:45 Comment: Sigtorsen.\n16:46 Comment: Sigtorsen hasn't really figured in the game.\n16:50 Comment: So Ajax bring on one of the youngsters, 20-year-old Milik,\n16:55 Comment: who's actually their leading scorer.\n16:58 Comment: He's scored four goals in his last three matches.\n17:1 Comment: Polish international on loan from Bayer Leverkusen.\n17:5 Comment: Now, can he turn the course of the game?\n17:12 Comment: I think it was really a toss-up between him and Sigtorsen\n17:15 Comment: who started the game tonight.\n17:18 Comment: Just over an hour played. One goal deficit.\n17:21 Comment: Frank de Boer makes the change.\n17:27 Comment: He's changed the emphasis of Ajax's play.\n17:31 Comment: This is Klasen.\n17:32 Comment: He's in a quiet second half, charged down by Jordi Alba.\n17:38 Comment: He might be a little bit more mobile, Milik.\n17:41 Comment: And Sigtorsen.\n17:43 Comment: So far, it's been pretty comfortable.\n17:45 Comment: I'm not sure I'm not a mild barker.\n17:51 Comment: Can they get a head of Steve Ajax in the last third of the game?\n18:0 Comment: Neymar.\n18:13 Comment: If it stays like this, of course, Barcelona will go on to nine points.\n18:17 Comment: Ajax would stay on two.\n18:20 Comment: The most they could get in the group would be eight,\n18:22 Comment: so they'd be dependent on Harry Sanderman getting a bad result\n18:26 Comment: against Apoel in the other game in the group tonight.\n18:32 Comment: The group half could all be wrapped up\n18:35 Comment: as Ajax finds some inspiration.\n18:39 Comment: Neymar.\n18:40 Comment: A little backspin on the ball.\n18:42 Comment: Fine take from Luis Suarez.\n18:44 Comment: Oh, and he passed it on.\n18:46 Comment: Luis Suarez and the all-red Liverpool kit\n18:48 Comment: would have lofted that over the goalkeeper.\n18:50 Comment: We both agree, and everybody watching at home will agree as well.\n18:54 Comment: He's trying to win friends, but he's not influencing games.\n18:58 Comment: He's playing more central in this half,\n19:0 Comment: and he's being involved in the game more.\n19:3 Comment: He's got a lot of confidence in his players.\n19:5 Comment: He's been involved in the game more.\n19:8 Comment: His lack of fitness in that first half position he had\n19:10 Comment: when he was up and down the right flank,\n19:12 Comment: tracking back, getting forward,\n19:14 Comment: he didn't have any sharpness left when he needed it in the final third.\n19:17 Comment: He's not going to do that as much.\n19:18 Comment: We've seen Messi drift out onto the right.\n19:20 Comment: Suarez is playing in that centre-forward position.\n19:23 Comment: He has two chances now.\n19:24 Comment: One he missed and one he passed up.\n19:29 Comment: Suarez has had two great chances to wrap the game up for Barcelona.\n19:36 Comment: Mascherano.\n19:38 Comment: Suarez to Neymar.\n19:41 Comment: Neymar to Xavi.\n19:44 Comment: Messi.\n19:47 Comment: Lost it towards Neymar.\n19:48 Comment: A lot for the Brazilian to do.\n19:50 Comment: Fun football being played by Barcelona.\n19:53 Comment: That one down, a misplaced pass from Xavi.\n19:57 Comment: Nelgazi.\n19:59 Comment: A bit of a stretch for Busquets.\n20:8 Comment: 20 minutes.\n20:10 Comment: They've flown by in the second half.\n20:13 Comment: No change in the scoreline.\n20:17 Comment: Neymar.\n20:26 Comment: No change in the scoreline.\n20:29 Comment: Better from Ajax.\n20:32 Comment: Nelgazi, wheeled on by the home supporters.\n20:35 Comment: Draws Mascherano.\n20:39 Comment: He wanted to cross the ball in hand,\n20:40 Comment: but I think it would have been better advised to have taken on Mascherano.\n20:50 Comment: Mascherano would be quite thankful he didn't just look the ball past him and run.\n20:57 Comment: They've got a corner, Ajax.\n20:59 Comment: An opportunity for the heavyweights to join the attack here.\n21:26 Comment: They have some tall players, Ajax, in situations like this.\n21:30 Comment: Distinct advantage over Barcelona.\n21:34 Comment: Not throwing players into the right positions.\n21:37 Comment: Suarez, who was the defender for Barcelona.\n21:42 Comment: Mascherano fires it in, free header!\n21:45 Comment: What a major chance that was.\n21:48 Comment: The substitute with virtually his first touch of the game.\n21:52 Comment: And freedom in the Barcelona penalty area.\n21:55 Comment: Did he have too much time?\n21:57 Comment: He tries to be so deliberate,\n21:58 Comment: but just flips it outside of the post.\n22:0 Comment: It's really unlucky.\n22:2 Comment: He wants to try and generate the power.\n22:4 Comment: He's putting it in the right direction to look it across to Stegen.\n22:7 Comment: All he knows is he has to get the power beyond it,\n22:8 Comment: otherwise he isn't going to beat the keeper.\n22:11 Comment: He's just inches away from getting the equaliser.\n22:13 Comment: A chance of a lifetime to score against Barcelona for\n22:17 Comment: Arkadiusz Milik, Polish international.\n22:20 Comment: There's Neymar.\n22:23 Comment: To Suarez.\n22:25 Comment: Rakitic joins the party.\n22:28 Comment: Messi.\n22:32 Comment: He's got the ball.\n22:47 Comment: Brilliant to Suarez.\n22:49 Comment: Messi through again.\n22:51 Comment: Van Rijn.\n22:53 Comment: Ahead of Neymar.\n22:55 Comment: Suarez is down.\n22:57 Comment: Taking a heavy fall.\n22:59 Comment: I actually thought it was a foul and should have been a free kick.\n23:1 Comment: The referee tried to allow the advantage\n23:3 Comment: and I thought he could have blown the whistle quick enough\n23:7 Comment: to have brought it back and gave Barcelona the free kick.\n23:9 Comment: Messi plays a little give and go on the edge of the box.\n23:12 Comment: He's planted into the back by Veltman.\n23:18 Comment: Mascherano.\n23:22 Comment: Classic sweeping up from the Argentinian international.\n23:34 Comment: Serrero lays it back.\n23:39 Comment: Van Rijn.\n23:41 Comment: Locked by Alba.\n24:9 Comment: Jami.\n24:11 Comment: Neymar.\n24:14 Comment: Rakitic.\n24:16 Comment: Good out by Van Rijn.\n24:28 Comment: Busquets.\n24:39 Comment: They're not renowned for changing style, are they?\n24:41 Comment: Even being a goal behind.\n24:43 Comment: You do get the feeling that Frank de Boer has to do something.\n24:48 Comment: Try and get some more players up the pitch\n24:50 Comment: before Barcelona do get the second goal.\n24:52 Comment: It's too late.\n24:54 Comment: It might be a time for Frank de Boer to gamble.\n24:57 Comment: Look at the hunger of Lionel Messi.\n24:59 Comment: Starts this run virtually inside his own half\n25:2 Comment: and was taken out in full flight.\n25:5 Comment: The card is coming.\n25:9 Comment: Hits the second yellow.\n25:14 Comment: And he knew as soon as he caught Lionel Messi\n25:17 Comment: that he was going to walk the plank for the second year in a row\n25:20 Comment: against Barcelona, Joel Veltman.\n25:25 Comment: Just as I was saying,\n25:26 Comment: he might have to be brave and make a change before it's too late.\n25:29 Comment: That might be the case now.\n25:31 Comment: Max down to ten men.\n25:32 Comment: A clear second yellow card for Joel Veltman.\n25:43 Comment: It was good determination shown by Lionel Messi, wasn't it?\n25:46 Comment: And the driving run.\n25:47 Comment: I don't think he was going to be polite at the end of that run, was he?\n25:49 Comment: He was going for goal.\n25:52 Comment: Well, he was going to catch it with Rown in style then, wasn't he?\n25:54 Comment: You could see it was ticking through his mind.\n26:0 Comment: Last year Ajax managed to beat Barcelona here\n26:4 Comment: despite Veltman getting sent off.\n26:8 Comment: But the odds so stacked against them now.\n26:11 Comment: Lionel Messi.\n26:14 Comment: Doesn't get the dip on the ball.\n26:16 Comment: Even if it was on target at that pace,\n26:18 Comment: I think Sillerson would have saved it quite comfortably.\n26:23 Comment: The circumstances are different though.\n26:25 Comment: That was match day five.\n26:26 Comment: Barcelona had already qualified for the next stages.\n26:29 Comment: They still have to make sure Barcelona\n26:31 Comment: can beat them.\n26:33 Comment: And they have to make sure they can beat them.\n26:38 Comment: And they have to make sure Barcelona\n26:39 Comment: can compete against PSG\n26:42 Comment: and get out of this group as quickly as possible\n26:44 Comment: and aim for top spot.\n26:48 Comment: Ridaval has to make a change.\n26:52 Comment: Jadot.\n26:54 Comment: Ridaval comes on.\n26:56 Comment: 18 years of age.\n26:59 Comment: Wasn't actually born.\n27:0 Comment: The only player to play for Ajax's senior side now.\n27:4 Comment: Wasn't actually born the last time they won\n27:8 Comment: the top European trophy back in 1995.\n27:26 Comment: Odds stacked against Ajax.\n27:29 Comment: Can they dig deep?\n27:31 Comment: Suarez.\n27:33 Comment: Here's Xavi.\n27:35 Comment: In the first game of course,\n27:38 Comment: Barcelona had\n27:40 Comment: the Cl√°sico looming.\n27:43 Comment: And Luis Enrique opted\n27:46 Comment: to throw on some of the younger players.\n27:49 Comment: Take some of the big names\n27:51 Comment: out of the frame.\n27:53 Comment: No suggestions he's going to\n27:56 Comment: throw substitutes on. Maybe.\n27:58 Comment: This is seen as a tough\n28:1 Comment: training exercise\n28:2 Comment: for Enrique.\n28:4 Comment: Especially for the likes of Luis Suarez\n28:7 Comment: who's searching for match fitness.\n28:9 Comment: No better way to get it than playing 90 minutes\n28:11 Comment: against a top European team.\n28:13 Comment: Exactly. But you do have to be careful\n28:15 Comment: the last 10-15 minutes that\n28:17 Comment: the player that's been out for a long while\n28:19 Comment: doesn't pick up an injury. Suarez won't want to come off.\n28:21 Comment: He'll think there's a goal here for him.\n28:23 Comment: He travelled to Almeria,\n28:25 Comment: lowly Almeria, at the weekend.\n28:27 Comment: Slightly different from the Cl√°sico.\n28:29 Comment: Alves.\n28:30 Comment: Rakitic.\n28:32 Comment: And there's work to be done. It's only 1-0.\n28:34 Comment: There's not two or three goals ahead.\n28:36 Comment: We have to finish this game off.\n28:39 Comment: The inevitable flag\n28:41 Comment: catches out Dani Alves.\n28:52 Comment: He isn't offside, is he?\n28:55 Comment: A little of that evidence.\n29:0 Comment: A little appreciation for the\n29:2 Comment: talents of Neymar from\n29:4 Comment: the Ajax supporters.\n29:12 Comment: And a very able\n29:14 Comment: replacement\n29:15 Comment: in Pedro. Maybe he doesn't have the trickery\n29:18 Comment: but has the drive and the danger.\n29:20 Comment: Pedro Rodr√≠guez.\n29:31 Comment: Well, listen.\n29:35 Comment: Bounced off the ball.\n29:37 Comment: Referee held his whistle.\n29:39 Comment: Excellent officiating.\n29:44 Comment: It's a little more difficult to find players\n29:46 Comment: when you're a man down Ajax.\n29:48 Comment: But it's a good thing.\n29:50 Comment: It's a good thing.\n30:1 Comment: Now, everybody has to put in that extra work\n30:3 Comment: to try and stop Messi.\n30:5 Comment: And away he goes again.\n30:7 Comment: First touch for Pedro.\n30:8 Comment: Fires it in.

He's one behind Messi.\n31:22 Comment: That will matter.\n31:24 Comment: That's going to go nip and tuck, isn't it?\n31:25 Comment: For a good few years, hopefully.\n31:28 Comment: It's kind of history repeating itself.\n31:30 Comment: He got a hat-trick against Ajax\n31:32 Comment: last season.\n31:34 Comment: Lionel Messi is looking for a hat-trick now.\n31:36 Comment: Suarez also seeking his first goal.\n31:38 Comment: Credit to Pedro.\n31:40 Comment: He came on and created the goal.\n31:42 Comment: Brilliantly.\n31:44 Comment: And credit to Luis Enrique.\n31:46 Comment: He's had a trouble a couple of weeks,\n31:48 Comment: but a substitution works out for him.\n31:50 Comment: Maybe the general is getting lucky here.\n31:52 Comment: And he's got a goal.\n32:0 Comment: You have to remember, that's Pedro's weaker foot.\n32:2 Comment: And he crossed that with his left foot.\n32:4 Comment: And the second thought whipped it in.\n32:6 Comment: Inch perfect.\n32:14 Comment: Messi again is lurking.\n32:16 Comment: Defenders.\n32:18 Comment: Dan Blink.\n32:24 Comment: Rakitic.\n32:28 Comment: Messi.\n32:30 Comment: Gives it through.\n32:32 Comment: Suarez.\n32:34 Comment: And he's ankle-tapped.\n32:36 Comment: The referee may be short.\n32:38 Comment: That was a touch of fatigue from Luis Suarez.\n32:45 Comment: Certainly a touch of fatigue from Ajax now, isn't it?\n32:48 Comment: General behind.\n32:50 Comment: Down to 10 men.\n32:53 Comment: The team in the old central defender.\n32:55 Comment: And the goalkeeper.\n32:56 Comment: The team in the old central defender.\n32:58 Comment: Playing against Lionel Messi.\n33:0 Comment: Luis Suarez.\n33:3 Comment: Raido.

tackle from the substitute, Densville.\n37:0 Comment: The cross in, Suarez fights with his own man, Pedro, to get to the ball.\n37:6 Comment: Pedro's going to have a slightly better trajectory.\n37:9 Comment: I'm happy for goals like that, they're missing for obvious reasons.\n37:12 Comment: Luis Suarez wants to get his first goal for Barcelona.\n37:14 Comment: Pedro hasn't been amongst the goals

    "summary": "In an evening clash at the Amsterdam Arena, Barcelona squared off against Ajax in a Champions League group stage match that was paramount for both teams. With Barcelona aiming to cement their place in the knockout stages and Ajax fighting to keep their qualification dreams alive, the stakes were high. The Catalan giants, featuring the formidable trio of Suarez, Messi, and Neymar, were keen to break their winless run that had persisted since the trio's unification. Ajax, under Frank de Boer's tutelage, hoped to capitalize on their home advantage and turn the tide in their favor.\n\nAs the first half got underway, it was evident that Barcelona was keen to dominate possession and impose their attacking prowess. Immediately, the slick passing and fluid movement of Barcelona‚Äôs front three began to test the Ajax defense. However, a well-organized defensive line from Ajax, led by Moisander and Veltman, initially managed to contain the visitors. The sequence of passes between Suarez, Messi, and Neymar showcased the potential lethalness of their partnership, but clear-cut chances were few and far between in the early exchanges.\n\nAjax, known for their possession-based style, found themselves forced into playing on the counter-attack due to Barcelona's dominance. The home side tried to build from the back with Silisson, their reliable goalkeeper, playing a crucial role in their ball distribution. As the game progressed, Ajax slowly grew into the match, with players like Serrero, Van Rijn, and El Ghazi showing sparks of brilliance. A notable moment came when El Ghazi demonstrated his skill, beating defenders and creating space, highlighting the attacking threat Ajax possessed.\n\nDespite Ajax's valiant efforts in both defense and sporadic attacks, it was Barcelona who drew first blood. A lapse in concentration from Silisson, who collided with Messi during an aerial duel, allowed Marc Bartra to capitalise on the loose ball. Messi, ever the predator, managed to outjump the taller defenders to head the ball into the net, marking his 70th goal in Champions League football. This goal exemplified Barcelona's determination and Messi's unmatched poaching instincts, giving them a crucial lead before halftime.\n\nThe first half ended with Ajax feeling somewhat hard done by the nature of the goal. There was frustration among the Ajax players and supporters, particularly as they believed that Barcelona should have kicked the ball out when El Ghazi was down injured moments before the goal. Nonetheless, the teams went into the break with the scoreline favoring the visitors 1-0, leaving Ajax with everything to do in the second half.\n\nThe second half began with high expectations from both sets of fans. Ajax needed inspiration and momentum to find their way back into the match, while Barcelona aimed to extend their lead and secure the three points. Early in the half, Ajax showed aggression and tenacity, pushing Barcelona back. The resilience from Barcelona's backline, particularly through the likes of Mascherano and Alba, continued to thwart Ajax‚Äôs attempts at an equalizer.\n\nAs time ticked on, Ajax‚Äôs persistence almost paid off. Their substitute, Milik, who had come on for Sigtorsson, found himself unmarked in the penalty area with a free header, only to hit it just wide of the post. This miss exemplified Ajax's night ‚Äî moments of brilliance shadowed by missed opportunities. On the other hand, Barcelona's fluid play and technical superiority began to shine through. A series of clever passes and intricate play almost culminated in a second goal for the visitors, but Cillessen made several crucial saves to keep Ajax in the game.\n\nHowever, the mounting pressure from Barcelona eventually took its toll on Ajax's defense. Veltman, who had been walking a disciplinary tightrope after being booked earlier, was sent off following a second yellow card for a cynical foul on Messi. This dismissal compounded Ajax‚Äôs woes and left them with an uphill task of trying to salvage the game with ten men. Any hopes that Ajax had of forcing a comeback were effectively dashed.\n\nBarcelona made strategic changes, with Pedro replacing Neymar and immediately making an impact. Just minutes after coming onto the pitch, Pedro delivered a precise cross into the box, where Messi, driven by his quest for a record, pounced between the defenders to score his second goal of the night. This strike not only doubled Barcelona‚Äôs lead but also brought Messi level with Raul as the all-time top scorer in Champions League history with 71 goals.\n\nThe bolstered lead allowed Barcelona to switch to cruise control. They maintained their possession and controlled the pace of the game, forcing Ajax to chase shadows for much of the remainder. Rafinha came on for Rakitic, aiming to garner some valuable European experience, while Adriano replaced Dani Alves, ensuring a fresh set of legs to see the game out.\n\nDespite the valiant efforts from the Amsterdam side, it was clear that Barcelona‚Äôs superior quality and tactical nous were too much to handle. The final stages saw a composed performance from the visitors as they effectively managed the game, nullifying any threats posed by Ajax. Barcelona‚Äôs relentless pressing high up the pitch, combined with their possession-based game, ensured that they limited Ajax‚Äôs opportunities to a minimum.\n\nAs the match drew to a close, Messi nearly had his hat-trick, only to be denied by the vigilant Cillessen. The Dutch goalkeeper, despite his earlier error, made several key saves to avoid further embarrassment for his side. The final whistle marked a 2-0 victory for Barcelona, a result that provided a much-needed boost to their Champions League campaign. Ajax, on the other hand, faced an uphill struggle to advance from the group stage, lamenting missed opportunities and moments of ill-discipline.\n\nIn summary, the match was a testament to Barcelona's class and the brilliance of Lionel Messi. The Argentine maestro's two goals not only secured the win for his team but also etched his name into the annals of football history once more. For Ajax, it was a night of what-ifs, as their valiant effort was undone by Barcelona‚Äôs efficiency and a moment of indiscipline. The game showcased the beauty of football, blending intricate skill with tactical astuteness, and ultimately highlighted why Barcelona remains a powerhouse in European football."
