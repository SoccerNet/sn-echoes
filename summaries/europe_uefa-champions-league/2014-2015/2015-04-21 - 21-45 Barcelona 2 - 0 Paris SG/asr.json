Vanderveel\n5:53 Comment: Vakinios\n5:58 Comment: you mentioned Rob the position that pastore is playing I think he's playing\n6:1 Comment: slightly deeper to try and give PSG back four somewhere to play the ball if he\n6:6 Comment: plays up alongside him in a minute so don't they want to play those long\n6:8 Comment: forward balls and give possession away cheaply so pastore is dropping deeper\n6:11 Comment: just an alternative to the back ball just to play into midfield into his feet\n6:17 Comment: Vanderveel trying to help out defensively but takes a little too long\n6:19 Comment: Cavani trying to help out defensively but takes a little too long\n6:23 Comment: Lionel Messi down\n6:26 Comment: Messi who remarkably scored his four hundredth goal\n6:30 Comment: for Barcelona

Comment: the pre-match handshake and Iniesta too sought out Ibrahimovic in the tunnel\n7:33 Comment: before the match\n7:36 Comment: long from Pastore that will frustrate Ibrahimovic and he is the kind of player\n7:42 Comment: who you wonder coming into a game like this whether it will be a night of\n7:46 Comment: inspiration or a night of frustration it's one of those players that really\n7:49

nobody\n8:51 Comment: no\n8:52 Comment: I mean\n8:52 Comment: Just one motion\n8:52 Comment: you and they'll be in behind you but it's the way that they can flip barcelona from\n8:56 Comment: playing high tempo football to just keeping the ball so well\n9:2 Comment: neymar\n9:6 Comment: was just working in too tight an area there with jordi alba\n9:14 Comment: this team may not be able to look forward to the semi-finals in\n9:18 Comment: nil on friday unless they can manufacture a remarkable comeback in this quarterfinal time\n9:27 Comment: but if they can't strike\n9:30 Comment: see where it takes them try and make barcelona a little bit nervous\n9:34 Comment: the own goal from jeremy matthew in the first leg may well turn out to be crucial\n9:44 Comment: a story\n9:48 Comment:

He's out of contract to Barcelona. There's been a lot of talk of him\n10:30 Comment: moving to Paris moved on by Messi to Iniesta\n10:34 Comment: and Marquinhos\n10:36 Comment: put it away in a fashion, but\n10:39 Comment: Maxwell still under pressure loses out to Alves back from Iniesta to Busquets\n10:45 Comment: at Rakitic\n10:48 Comment: away by van der Waal\n10:53 Comment: Just listen to the home crowd as well. They do really enjoy the Barcelona\n10:57 Comment: Method of closing the opposition down as well\n10:59 Comment: They love to see Messi in full flow and Suarez scoring goals where they look to see their team\n11:3 Comment: We're really hard off the ball as they did that win it back so so quickly\n11:8 Comment: It was that kind of pressure that earned them their breakthrough goal in Paris\n11:16 Comment: Here's Suarez\n11:18 Comment: Now Alves\n11:20 Comment: Messi\n11:22 Comment: Maxwell\n11:24 Comment: Having it run back to\n11:26 Comment: Sirigu\n11:28 Comment: Just a bit of a misunderstanding normally between Messi and Dani Alves they\n11:32 Comment: They do understand each other really well\n11:34 Comment: He just actually put his head down Dani Alves and ran forward and Messi was trying to pick him out with that forward ball and\n11:40 Comment: Alves didn't know it was coming\n11:42 Comment: De Jongo\n11:47 Comment: With that finger he's advised for last time\n11:48 Comment: De Jongo\n12:17 Comment: And Messi.\n12:20 Comment: Blocked by Maxwell.\n12:22 Comment: Dani Alves.\n12:23 Comment: Messi.\n12:24 Comment: Alves plays it in.\n12:25 Comment: It got a slight nick off Luis, which favoured the goalkeeper.\n12:32 Comment: PSG haven't been able to venture too far out of their own half so far.\n12:37 Comment: With any great conviction.\n12:40 Comment: And again they lose out.\n12:43 Comment: Pique.\n12:44 Comment: I think they'll probably look at Luis and Maxwell too.\n12:47 Comment: They're back four for PSG.\n12:48 Comment: They haven't really got an option.\n12:49 Comment: There is only Ibrahimovic.\n12:51 Comment: He's marked by two centre-halves.\n12:52 Comment: There's no long forward ball.\n12:53 Comment: So they're having to jab it into midfield.\n12:55 Comment: That's what Barcelona want them to do.\n12:57 Comment: That's why they're winning the ball back time and again.\n12:59 Comment: Look at this for a run from Andres Iniesta.\n13:2 Comment: Carried it such a long way.\n13:4 Comment: Beautiful ball.\n13:5 Comment: Neymar has done it again.\n13:8 Comment: Fourth game against PSG this season.\n13:11 Comment: And he's scored in every one.\n13:14 Comment: And just as he got the breakthrough goal in Paris, he's done it.\n13:18 Comment: But huge credit there to Andres Iniesta.\n13:21 Comment: Laurent Blanc is crestfallen.\n13:23 Comment: And his team are heading out.\n13:25 Comment: This is absolutely sensational.\n13:28 Comment: The balance, the footwork, the pace of Iniesta.\n13:30 Comment: And then at the crucial point, it's releasing the pass.\n13:33 Comment: He does so much himself, but he doesn't try and overdo it.\n13:36 Comment: He sees Neymar's move off the ball.\n13:37 Comment: The weight of the pass is outstanding.\n13:39 Comment: First touch from Neymar, as you would expect from the best, is superb.\n13:43 Comment: And then there's only going to be.\n13:44 Comment: And he's going to have to do one result once he controls it.\n13:46 Comment: He's going to dance past the goalkeeper and tuck it away.\n13:48 Comment: But it's just brilliant from Iniesta.\n13:50 Comment: But then the trust, the movement off the ball from Neymar.\n13:52 Comment: He knows a good pass is coming his way.\n13:54 Comment: And he tucks it away so, so easily.\n13:56 Comment: And a devastating blow to PSG's hopes.\n13:58 Comment: First goal of the Champions League this season for Neymar.\n14:5 Comment: Four of them against Paris Saint-Germain.\n14:14 Comment: Naturally transformer the\n14:18 Comment: Champions League is exactly what needs to be done and where there is no waiting.\n14:22 Comment: He has got all highest numbers on thedrawal at the crowd's level.\n14:24 Comment: Ins Carroll, we have everything on our fiz Piguta into the press record for the Tottenham.\n14:27 Comment: We've got commitment of five minutes as things take a big change.\n14:29 Comment: And we're doing exactly what one bringing the ball to the whole agent,\n14:31 Comment: why he's one of our best and why PSG he's one of our most great assistants.\n14:35 Comment: And then it goesowe chop **** to the Fire Institute.\n14:37 Comment: Parag לה.\n14:38 Comment: Finally violence.\n14:40 Comment: Dahme to his own.\n14:41 Comment: As你 кстати\n14:42 Comment: Boust me to go xxx.\n14:44 Comment: not only a goal in Barcelona a goal in Munich too and it's gone to Bayern\n14:53 Comment: Thiago 1-0 they still trail 3-2 on aggregate\n14:58 Comment: cut at the heart of PSG with that run well it must be a joy for the Barcelona midfielders or\n15:5 Comment: maybe Messi when he comes deep and picks up possession because the movement off the ball\n15:9 Comment: we saw it with Neymar there we see it time and again with Suarez you've always got an option\n15:12 Comment: to go forward and if you play a decent pass invariably an opportunity is going to come your way\n15:18 Comment: it's funny because right at the start of that breakout it looked as though Barcelona themselves\n15:24 Comment: had been a bit sloppy with the ball played by Javier Mascherano but they got themselves out\n15:28 Comment: of that little difficulty and boy did they take advantage can PSG strike back Ibrahimović\n15:34 Comment: looking for another former Barcelona man in Maxwell calmly dealt with by Barcelona's German\n15:41 Comment: goalkeeper\n15:42 Comment: yeah it's very important that Ter Stegen comes off his goal line Ibrahimović of course is the\n15:47 Comment: focal point and every time PSG are in wide positions they will look to knock those crosses\n15:51 Comment: in towards the big striker so the keeper's got to come and deal with it at times come off his\n15:54 Comment: line as he did there and catch comfortably here's Verratti Pastore\n16:2 Comment: Maxwell\n16:7 Comment: oh the\n16:12 Comment: corner fag didn't do him any favours there\n16:14 Comment: when he looks out well again you see Iniesta picks the ball up halfway inside his own half\n16:20 Comment: and you think well surely we're not in that much trouble we can't conceive from that type of\n16:24 Comment: position but it's just outstanding balance and vision from Iniesta that's why he is one of the\n16:29 Comment: world's great players and when you're a centre forward playing with Iniesta you know you can\n16:32 Comment: make a run he will find you with a pass and then it's down to your first touch and your balance\n16:37 Comment: yourself and your finishing ability and we know Neymar this season has been sensational in that\n16:41 Comment: regard it was a stunning goal\n16:42 Comment: Neymar the man who rounded it off but huge credit for it will go to Iniesta who's won this competition three times already\n16:54 Comment: there's Ibrahimović\n17:2 Comment: back from Maxwell to Zlatan Ibrahimović\n17:8 Comment: this is Pastore\n17:10 Comment: Maxwell with the touch to Matuidi\n17:12 Comment: and he's got it\n17:44 Comment: Iniesta's header\n17:45 Comment: now Alba\n17:48 Comment: Mascherano\n17:53 Comment: to Dani Alves\n17:56 Comment: Rakitic\n17:58 Comment: Messi\n18:0 Comment: aimed for Neymar\n18:3 Comment: and Van der Veel in the way\n18:7 Comment: that's hit too heavily at Neymar by\n18:9 Comment: Jordi Alba\n18:10 Comment: that's hit too heavily at Neymar by\n18:13 Comment: Matuidi\n18:24 Comment: Here's Pastore\n18:29 Comment: Alves winning the header\n18:35 Comment: Van der Veel\n18:39 Comment: Matuidi\n18:42 Comment: Cavani\n18:48 Comment: Cavani with the effort that was\n18:51 Comment: blocked by Iniesta\n18:52 Comment: Matuidi couldn't take it around\n18:55 Comment: Alba who steadfast\n18:57 Comment: in his resistance\n18:59 Comment: Verratti\n19:1 Comment: very well under pressure\n19:4 Comment: tries to clip it into Matuidi's path\n19:9 Comment: recovered by Alba\n19:11 Comment: there's an opportunity there\n19:12 Comment: it's a great forward ball actually\n19:14 Comment: and Matuidi could have possibly taken it first time\n19:16 Comment: felt he had time to take it down\n19:17 Comment: Jordi Alba on the cover\n19:19 Comment: gave him a problem there\n19:21 Comment: needed to really just put his foot through the ball Matuidi\n19:23 Comment: here's Pastore\n19:26 Comment: Cabaye\n19:28 Comment: Maxwell\n19:33 Comment: Matuidi\n19:43 Comment: Cavani leaves it for Javier Pastore\n19:45 Comment: and that's a poor slice from Pique\n19:49 Comment: got away with it\n19:51 Comment: Pastore caught in two mines then perhaps\n19:53 Comment: really again as you said with Matuidi\n19:55 Comment: when that ball breaks your way sometimes you've got to think about taking it first time\n19:58 Comment: you take a touch\n19:59 Comment: guaranteed you're going to get closed down especially in the penalty area\n20:2 Comment: so try and get your shot away early\n20:11 Comment: here's Busquets\n20:19 Comment: now Alves\n20:35 Comment: Messi\n20:37 Comment: Iniesta\n20:39 Comment: Pique\n20:40 Comment: kalau\n20:59 Comment: here's\n21:0 Comment: Alves\n21:2 Comment: looking for a way through\n21:3 Comment: Messi controlling it for Iniesta\n21:8 Comment: Miss Estoril\n21:10 Comment: see Iniesta controls it falls for Suarez tried to steer it out to Neymar\n21:15 Comment: Iniesta goes into an area where there was no Barcelona player coolly dealt\n21:19 Comment: with by Maxwell\n21:33 Comment: PK having to try and hold up Blaise Matuidi and Matuidi thought he shrugged\n21:38 Comment: him off then\n21:45 Comment: Alves Iniesta\n21:56 Comment: Neymar\n22:4 Comment: Mascherano Rakitic\n22:8 Comment: Messi away from Verratti wide of Maxwell out to Dani Alves\n22:19 Comment: Messi that's a wonderful piece of work from Luis Suarez great movement\n22:25 Comment: initially to get on the end of the cross from Alves and then you said within the\n22:29 Comment: Esther for Neymar the appreciation of what surrounds you the layoff here from\n22:32 Comment: Suarez to Messi is brilliant normally from that type of position Messi would\n22:36 Comment: get his foot over the top of the ball this is a chance earlier for a little bit of a win for Messi.\n22:38 Comment: Messi would get his foot over the top of the ball this is a chance earlier for a little bit of a win for Messi.\n22:39 Comment: Pastore just nerves at the back there always tends to be nerves at the back\n22:42 Comment: with Barcelona they do give you opportunities even if it is claiming a\n22:47 Comment: back pass for this but it's just a very very poor clearance from PK\n22:55 Comment: Bayern Munich have reduced the deficit already 3-3 on aggregate now they've only\n23:0 Comment: played 21 minutes in the Allianz Jerome Boateng with a second\n23:8 Comment:

Ibrahimovic\n26:10 Comment: pretty much one way at the moment trying to get more involved in the game Ibrahimovic\n26:15 Comment: so dropping deep that means Cavani's then I think is a true centre forward\n26:19 Comment: so some flexibility in that PSG attack the trouble is that they can't really\n26:22 Comment: get the ball up to the two attacking players most potent attacking players in the game\n26:25 Comment: attacking players for them is the pressure all over the field certainly in\n26:29 Comment: the PSG half is just too intense they can't get a decent quality pass forward\n26:33

giving it away to Neymar\n28:24 Comment: and then comes Iniesta.\n28:36 Comment: Went to ground fairly easy in Iniesta but when he's in possession he just glides over the surface, always a danger.\n28:54 Comment: Seen against then by Neymar but it is going to be just a warning for him.\n28:59 Comment: You don't like to see it, Johan Cabaye going over there and trying to get Neymar booked for that challenge but when you play a high pressing game\n29:5 Comment: sometimes you're going to give fouls away, you're going to run the risk of being booked but\n29:8 Comment: there's no foul there and Iniesta goes to ground far too easily and\n29:11 Comment: I think he just got up and got on with it, didn't try and kid the referee at all.\n29:18 Comment: Ibrahimovic climbing with Pique, there's Alves, now Busquets.\n29:21 Comment: Busquets.\n29:26 Comment: Iniesta.\n29:29 Comment: In slides Verratti, if there is a question mark over his game it is the defensive side of it.\n29:35 Comment: Sometimes the timing of his challenges, he's served quite a few suspensions already this season including the first leg of this tie.\n29:42 Comment: I think he's had four domestic lands but he's a very, very good player.\n29:44 Comment: He's actually started this game particularly well but every time he's in possession, Verratti, he's under pressure.\n29:49 Comment: Gets away from one and there's another Barcelona player closing him down so he has to play well.\n29:53 Comment: Just to get his passes away.\n29:58 Comment: Suarez.\n30:4 Comment: Rakitic.\n30:9 Comment: Now fouled by Busquets.\n30:10 Comment: Referee Fodji got the ball.\n30:13 Comment: Here's Messi.\n30:16 Comment: Iniesta.\n30:20 Comment: Neymar.\n30:22 Comment: Now Rakitic.\n30:23 Comment: Neymar.\n30:30 Comment: Sturridge.\n30:35 Comment: This ball's taken on by Pascual Busquets.\n30:36 Comment: I think even one or two of the Barcelona players were a little surprised the free kick wasn't given.\n30:40 Comment: Sure Busquets didn't got the ball.\n30:40 Comment: Maybe the way that Pascual went to ground theatrically there was an awful lot of contact on him, certainly not as serious as he made it look.\n30:48 Comment: That's maybe why the referee just played on.\n30:50 Comment: Now Busquets got the ball.\n30:51 Comment: Yep.\n30:51 Comment: Pascual.\n30:52 Comment: Busquets loved the ball.\n30:52 Comment: He makes a good門.\n30:52 Comment: having not had the decision in his favour.\n30:56 Comment: This free kick has been given against him,\n30:58 Comment: but rather than talk his way into trouble,\n30:59 Comment: he'd be best out of there as quickly as possible.\n31:2 Comment: Just pure frustration.\n31:3 Comment: He feels he should have picked up a free kick earlier.\n31:5 Comment: He was fouled, clearly fouled.\n31:6 Comment: Referee got that one wrong.\n31:8 Comment: That is a problem when you lose possession to Barcelona.\n31:10 Comment: You go up chasing it, trying to make amends,\n31:13 Comment: trying to make the referee's mind up for him.\n31:15 Comment: Just so clever.\n31:16 Comment: And Eymar moves that ball so quickly,\n31:17 Comment: eventually give a foul away,\n31:18 Comment: and he's fortunate not to be booked.\n31:22 Comment: Alba.\n31:42 Comment: Mascherano.\n31:50 Comment: Now Pique.\n31:52 Comment: Marquinhos.\n32:10 Comment: Here's Verratti.\n32:22 Comment: Pastore.\n32:26 Comment: Vanderveel.\n32:31 Comment: One back by Iniesta.\n32:34 Comment: Suarez has Messi up ahead.\n32:37 Comment: Busquets pushing it back through to Luis Suarez.\n32:40 Comment: He gets another bite at it.\n32:43 Comment: Feeds Neymar.\n32:44 Comment: Messi just hanging back this time.\n32:45 Comment: Alba's in the middle too.\n32:49 Comment: Again, retreat by Barcelona.\n32:52 Comment: No thought on Suarez's mind of letting PSG break out.\n33:0 Comment: Alves.\n33:10 Comment: Away from Maxwell and bent in.\n33:12 Comment: And it's a second.\n33:15 Comment: A second for Neymar.\n33:17 Comment: A second on the night for Barcelona,\n33:20 Comment: who are heading now,\n33:22 Comment: unstoppably,\n33:23 Comment: to the semi-finals of the Champions League.\n33:27 Comment: Well, there's some question over defending once again from PSG,\n33:30 Comment: but it's a wonderful ball in from Dani Alves.\n33:32 Comment: And one thing that Neymar does here,\n33:34 Comment: he knows all the paces on the cross.\n33:36 Comment: He doesn't try and have it too firmly.\n33:37 Comment: He just redirects it, just guides it into that far corner.\n33:40 Comment: He just goes in between those far too easily.\n33:43 Comment: A player of that talent with the finishing ability he's got,\n33:45 Comment: you can't align this time and space.\n33:47 Comment: David Luiz caught ball watching,\n33:49 Comment: has no idea where Neymar is.\n33:51 Comment: He's just got to keep going.\n33:52 Comment: It's just a lovely glancing header,\n33:53 Comment: because all the paces on the ball in.\n34:15 Comment: That is a devastating blow to PSG.\n34:18 Comment: Administered by a man who has been\n34:22 Comment: very much the thorn in their flesh\n34:24 Comment: in the Champions League this season.\n34:25 Comment: As soon as you see Dani Alves step in field there,\n34:27 Comment: David Luiz, he can't be looking at the ball.\n34:29 Comment: He has to think, well, a decent ball is going to come in here.\n34:31 Comment: Where is Neymar?\n34:32 Comment: And he just gets off his shoulder far too easily.\n34:35 Comment: Van der Veel isn't round on the cover,\n34:37 Comment: but he would be expecting the centre-half\n34:38 Comment: to deal with that situation a lot better.\n34:40 Comment: An experienced centre-half like Luiz\n34:41 Comment: and getting caught ball watching against Barcelona is a no-no.\n34:48 Comment: Well, he'll look at him now and surely feel that the game is up.\n34:52 Comment: Certainly in the Champions League,\n34:54 Comment: possibly even for his managerial tenure.\n34:57 Comment: Such are the high stakes on games in this competition\n35:0 Comment: for the coach of PSG with the money that has been spent.\n35:3 Comment: It will look bleak for Laurent Blanc,\n35:6 Comment: even though there is still a domestic treble there to be won.\n35:10 Comment: I think being successful in France is one thing,\n35:12 Comment: but when you spend the type of money PSG have,\n35:14 Comment: it's expected that you'll push on like Manchester City,\n35:17 Comment: push on in Europe, and it's not really happened this season.\n35:20 Comment: That said, they're up against very,\n35:21 Comment: very good opposition here.\n35:23 Comment: And even before a ball was kicked in the tyre,\n35:25 Comment: they would have been struggling maybe to expect themselves to go through.\n35:29 Comment: That's how it's proved.\n35:32 Comment: Here's Alves, whose quality of service was responsible for that second Barcelona goal.\n35:37 Comment: Rakitic, Alves, Rakitic,\n35:41 Comment: playing neatly between the two of them as they look for more inroads here.\n35:45 Comment: Stopped by David Luiz, but still PSG find it difficult to break out.\n35:51 Comment: Look how the strikers had to come to get involved in Cavani.\n35:59 Comment: Well, that is the problem in many ways with Ibrahimovic in the side.\n36:1 Comment: You just don't have that out.\n36:3 Comment: Remember Bayern Munich have scored seven on two occasions in the Champions League.\n36:8 Comment: They've just got another.\n36:9 Comment: They're 4-0 up on the ninth, 5-3 on aggregate against Porto.\n36:14 Comment: They need to score twice to get back in this game.\n36:17 Comment: That was Thomas Müller.\n36:21 Comment: Pastore.\n36:27 Comment: Ibrahimovic.\n36:39 Comment: Peratti.\n36:49 Comment: Maxwell given too much to do.\n36:51 Comment: And then,\n36:53 Comment: Neymar.\n36:54 Comment: Neymar's goals the difference.\n36:57 Comment: Here's Luiz.\n37:10 Comment: A five-point lead.\n37:12 Comment: Neymar.\n37:22 Comment: And finally,\n37:23 Comment: He's got a 5-1 aggregate advantage and still no let up in the work rate from Barcelona.\n37:30 Comment: Messi's the man who wins it back this time.\n37:33 Comment: Now, Rakitic.\n37:41 Comment: Pique.\n37:44 Comment: N'Ester.\n37:47 Comment: He's in the Ester.\n37:50 Comment: Neymar.\n37:51 Comment: Neymar, Alba, Busquets, Dani Alves, Messi, Neymar wins the corner.\n38:11 Comment: PSG did well there just to close ranks and stop that cross coming in from Neymar because they were at sixes and sevens.\n38:18 Comment: It was a flowing move from Barcelona. Messi just slowed things down slightly.\n38:22 Comment: Gave the French side time just to regroup and organise themselves.\n38:30 Comment: Well, that is the concern for PSG, that it could now be a case of how many.\n38:42 Comment: Rakitic with the corner, which was in for Pique, who was in a battle with David Luiz.\n38:48 Comment: He's got a good shot, but he's got a bad one.\n38:52 Comment: Certainly not an easy header, an away swinger like this, beyond the near post, running away from goal.\n38:56 Comment: Difficult to just flick it.\n38:58 Comment: Nearly need to do what Neymar did, just flick it on its way.\n39:1 Comment: But with Luiz in close attendance, that would have been a difficult goal to score.\n39:14 Comment: Iniesta found himself out.\n39:16 Comment: Well, he found his way out of the way.\n39:18 Comment: He found his way out of one tight spot, only to be faced by Verratti.\n39:23 Comment: This is Ibrahimovic, Cavani, Ibrahimovic, Matuidi.\n39:28 Comment: Verratti forced wider than he would have wanted.\n39:31 Comment: And it's cleared by Alba.\n39:35 Comment: Pandeville.\n39:40 Comment: Verratti.\n39:46 Comment: Cavani looking for Cavani.\n39:48 Comment: But is a copy that Werner can't.\n39:50 Comment: De Gea wouldn't have brought.\n39:51 Comment: And especially if it wasn't for the guy between me.\n39:53 Comment: And also, perhaps because Jurgen\n40:14 Comment: .\n40:15 Comment: A shot which Lolson couldn't.\n40:18 Comment: try and lobby and if they've been on target the weight was certainly in the shot just way off target\n40:22 Comment: take my temperature bayern are now five nil up on the night levendowski's got\n40:45 Comment: a second six three they lead\n40:56 Comment: Matt weedy\n41:2 Comment: Maxwell's cross cleared by Mascherano pastore\n41:10 Comment: just off balance there's no real movement from Ibrahimovic the ball\n41:14 Comment: breaks wide to Maxwell is clearly gonna cross\n41:15 Comment: it the strikers just caught on his heels he's got to be making a move across\n41:20 Comment: defenders because those crosses clearly gonna be aimed his way\n41:28 Comment: candles of the champions league as a player

Comment: in the end it is cleared by Cavani\n42:29 Comment: it is fantastic to be a fullback in this Barcelona side\n42:33 Comment: because the trust is there\n42:34 Comment: you know that Rakitic and Iniesta are going to keep the ball\n42:36 Comment: so you can just power on forward\n42:38 Comment: knowing the ball is going to come your way\n42:39 Comment: you're not going to expect to lose possession\n42:41 Comment: you have to run 60 yards back\n42:43 Comment: and do some defending\n42:44 Comment: you just push on really\n42:45 Comment: and play the ball\n42:45 Comment: and play as a winger\n42:46 Comment: Cavani is still not 10 yards away\n42:51 Comment: Rakitic with the corner\n42:58 Comment: he's away\n43:6 Comment: there's Cavani\n43:10 Comment: I'm not sure what he was

that's why they keep winning the ball back so quickly\n43:29 Comment: you look at it sometimes don't you\n43:42 Comment: you think they must be playing with an extra man\n43:43 Comment: you look at it

We haven't really seen an awful lot of\n6:4 Comment: Messi or Suarez.

There's that flexibility in attack.\n7:25 Comment: And they're all different types of player as well which I think helps\n7:28 Comment: Luis Enrique in terms of how his team go about breaking the opposition down.\n7:41 Comment: Xavi.\n7:46 Comment: The frustration getting the better of Yohan Kabay.\n7:51 Comment: Barcelona just getting up and getting on with it and Messi trying to play in\n7:55 Comment: Luis Suarez. Cleared by Maxwell.\n8:0 Comment: And they raise the tempo like that. There could be real fear in the hearts of\n8:5 Comment: the Paris Saint-Germain defenders.\n8:7 Comment: Here's Suarez. Away by David Luiz.\n8:12 Comment: Struck by Verratti against Sergio Busquets.\n8:15 Comment: Has to try and negotiate his way out of this and does.\n8:20 Comment: Astore tried to get it on. Broken up by Xavi.\n8:33 Comment: Here's Pique.\n8:37 Comment: The Scots.\n8:53 Comment: Busquets.\n8:59 Comment: Struck down by Verratti who's only just back from a Champions League suspension.\n9:3 Comment: Gets away without a card this time.\n9:6 Comment: He does like a challenge for Verratti. It's just the quick footwork here of Busquets\n9:9 Comment: to get away from him.\n9:11 Comment: As you go to ground you really get off to win the ball. This is clever work from Verratti.\n9:14 Comment: He has his own penalty area.\n9:17 Comment: He's a bundle of energy. You've got to be careful in the Champions League with your challenges.\n9:22 Comment: Another challenge from Barcelona. The second time that\n9:26 Comment: Luis Enrique has looked to his bench and he sends on\n9:29 Comment: Sergi Roberto for his second Champions League appearance of the season.\n9:33 Comment: He played in the group stage win over Apoel back in September.\n9:38 Comment: The young midfielder.\n9:49 Comment: Xavi.\n9:54 Comment: Off the ball.\n9:58 Comment: Testing the referee's patience.\n10:1 Comment: Two challenges in a short space of time from Johan Cabaye.\n10:4 Comment: Just the cleverness again. The footwork of Xavi.\n10:7 Comment: We saw it with Busquets early and Verratti.\n10:9 Comment: He just moved that ball so quickly. You're tempted in.\n10:11 Comment: You think it's there to be won. It's a wait.\n10:24 Comment: Cabaye.\n10:28 Comment: Ibrahimovic.\n10:30 Comment: Astore.\n10:33 Comment: Latwidi.\n10:40 Comment: Verratti.\n10:46 Comment: Astore.\n11:1 Comment: A good ball for the faithful who've travelled.\n11:15 Comment: I think from a pure footballing perspective.\n11:18 Comment: It is always a pleasure to watch Barcelona play.\n11:21 Comment: It is. They've made it very comfortable for themselves both in the first leg and\n11:25 Comment: of course during the course of this game as well.\n11:26 Comment: Everything about their game is high tempo.\n11:28 Comment: When they're in possession, when they lose the ball, they close down quickly.\n11:31 Comment: It has been a feature of why Barcelona have been so good.\n11:34 Comment: Better than the rest.\n11:36 Comment: Years gone by and they look at a formidable outfit.\n11:39 Comment: I think any team who comes up against them in the semifinals and beyond\n11:43 Comment: they can have a big problem in trying to beat them.\n11:53 Comment: Here's Latwidi looking for Cavani with a cross.\n11:56 Comment: Cut up for now by Pique.\n12:0 Comment: Ibrahimovic.\n12:7 Comment: Van der Veel.\n12:11 Comment: Cabaye.\n12:15 Comment: Verratti.\n12:20 Comment: Maxwell.\n12:26 Comment: Kovacic.\n12:56 Comment: It's not quite as good as so far as though Barcelona are back.\n13:0 Comment: As we're more familiar with them.\n13:18 Comment: This is David Luiz.\n13:23 Comment: Maxwell.\n13:25 Comment: Going long for Ibrahimovic.\n13:30 Comment: Asherano went down.\n13:32 Comment: It is promptly back up again and he had to be.\n13:37 Comment: A risky ball that Pique deals with for now by clearing to Ibrahimovic.\n13:42 Comment: And it opens up for Verratti who strikes it wide.\n13:46 Comment: Well at the very least in that type of position Verratti has to hit the target.\n13:50 Comment: Good bit of play actually from Ibrahimovic just to actually release the pass.\n13:53 Comment:

Mascherano in the way.\n36:50 Comment: Mascherano read that situation brilliantly, he knew the cross was going to come in.\n36:53 Comment: He's just trying to stop Levetsey get to it.\n36:55 Comment: He doesn't worry about Lucas, he just worries about the ball and the path of the ball\n36:58 Comment: and makes sure when it's played he's there first.\n37:2 Comment: Has been a better second half from Paris Saint-Germain but with nothing to show for it still.\n37:9 Comment: And always the feeling that Barcelona are in control.\n37:12 Comment: Normally Barca average over 60% in terms of possession, they've not had that tonight.\n37:16 Comment: But PSG with a fair amount of the ball have done pretty much nothing with it.\n37:19 Comment: The story has won a corner for them.\n37:29 Comment: I think maybe a set piece might be a possible route to goal, they've got some big lads\n37:32 Comment: they can send up for the back.

    "summary": "Barcelona emerged victorious over Paris Saint-Germain with a 2-0 triumph, comfortably sealing their place in the Champions League semi-finals. It was the Catalan giants' 100th home match in the competition, and they certainly marked the occasion in style. \n\nThe game started with early domination from Barcelona. The match had barely kicked off when the sense of occasion was evident. Barcelona, who have lost just nine times in their previous 99 home matches in the Champions League, seemed determined to maintain their strong home record. Within the opening minutes, the immense task facing PSG was common knowledge. The Parisians needed a miracle to overturn their three-goal deficit from the first leg.\n\nJordi Alba found Neymar, who had scored in all three meetings between the clubs that season. It was clear from the outset that Barcelona's formidable attacking trio of Messi, Neymar, and Suarez would be key. With all three exhibiting their usual flair, the PSG defense, already with memories of a dreadful first leg, had their work cut out for them.\n\nPSG seemed aware of the historical odds stacked against them. Their attempts to break Barcelona's rhythm were evident early on. However, their efforts often resulted in risky challenges, notably David Luiz, who was booked in the opening minutes for a clumsy foul on Rakitic. Barcelona's high pressing game was a nightmare for PSG, forcing errors and turnovers in dangerous areas.\n\nThen came a moment of individual brilliance. Andres Iniesta, picking up the ball inside his own half, dodged several PSG players. His mesmerizing run ended with a perfectly timed pass to Neymar, who calmly slotted the ball past Sirigu. It was Neymar's fourth goal against PSG that season and all but settled the tie for Barcelona. Laurent Blanc's hope of a comeback started to look increasingly desperate.\n\nThe first half continued with Barcelona dominating possession and constantly pressing PSG high up the pitch. Dani Alves and Gerard Pique played crucial roles in maintaining this pressure. The PSG backline, frequently caught off-guard by the dynamic and fluid attacks from Barcelona, looked increasingly overwhelmed. Every loose touch or moment of hesitation by PSG was pounced upon by the alert Barcelona midfield and attack.\n\nDespite struggling to make an impact, PSG did have glimpses of chances. Zlatan Ibrahimović and Edinson Cavani found themselves isolated upfront often battling two or three defenders. Barcelona’s compact defense, marshaled by Mascherano and Pique, generally managed to contain the attackers. However, PSG's desire to play out from the back kept putting them under pressure, leading to turnovers and more Barcelona attacks.\n\nAs the halftime whistle blew, Barcelona led 1-0 on the night and 4-1 on aggregate. Any faint hopes PSG might have harbored of staging a comeback seemed dashed. It felt like Barcelona had one foot firmly placed in the semi-finals, and PSG were running out of ideas and time.\n\nThe second half began with a renewed sense of urgency from PSG. They pushed their lines higher and tried to get the ball into the box with more frequency. Edinson Cavani and Zlatan Ibrahimovic had a few chances but continuously came up against Barcelona's well-organized defense. Again and again, Barcelona’s back presented a well-drilled front with everyone closing down and winning the ball back with great teamwork.\n\nBarcelona's second goal came in the 34th minute of the second half. Dani Alves made a surging run down the right and delivered a beautiful cross into the box. Neymar, showing his predatory instincts, met the ball with a delicate header that floated past Sirigu into the far corner. The capacity crowd at Nou Camp erupted, knowing that it was not just another goal but a definitive message to the rest of Europe that Barcelona was in imperious form.\n\nNow trailing by two goals on the night and five on aggregate, PSG's challenge took on an air of resignation. It became clear that any sort of comeback was beyond their reach. Their play grew increasingly fragmented and disjointed, struggling to cope with Barcelona's relentless pressing and precise ball movement.\n\nThroughout the second half, Messi, despite not being on the score sheet, was a constant threat, pulling defenders out of position, creating space for others, and delivering those incisive passes that have become his hallmark. Luis Suarez also played his part, showing immense work rate and unselfish play that facilitated numerous Barcelona attacks.\n\nPSG tried to respond with changes. They brought in Lucas Moura and Adrian Rabiot to add more vigor and fresh legs to their midfield, but it was evident that the damage had been done. The fresh substitutions did briefly inject some energy, with Lucas Moura making some adventurous runs down the flanks, yet always stymied by determined Barcelona defending.\n\nIn the closing stages, Barcelona continued to control the game’s tempo, making full use of their impeccable ball retention skills. Territory seemed inconsequential—the ball was under Barcelona's control wherever it moved. Xavi, who was brought on in the second half, orchestrated the midfield like a maestro, directing play and ensuring the Parisians couldn’t establish any form of rhythm.\n\nAny PSG threats were met decisively. Mascherano was particularly noteworthy with crucial interceptions and well-timed tackles, ensuring PSG’s forays forward were cut short before they became genuine threats.\n\nBy the time the referee blew the final whistle, it was a comprehensive victory for Barcelona. They had won 2-0 on the night and 5-1 on aggregate. Neymar's double was the highlight, but it was the overall team performance, marked by coherence, discipline, and flair, which truly made the difference.\n\nThis victory sends a clear signal to the remaining teams in the competition: Barcelona are back to their best, combining their traditional style of high pressing, quick passing, and a formidable attacking trio. They are a team that can dominate games, dismantle defenses, and score goals from almost anywhere on the pitch. As they head into the semi-finals, their opponents will be well-aware that overcoming Barcelona will require something special.\n\nFor PSG, this match illustrated the gap that still exists between them and Europe’s elite. Though they can dominate domestically, competing with the likes of Barcelona showcases the need for further growth and strategy refinement. The defeat underlines the challenges of rising to the very top of European football—a pathway that requires more than just financial power but also strategic depth and consistency in performance.\n\nReflecting on the proceedings at Nou Camp, it was evident that Barcelona were not just playing for a semi-final spot but also communicating an integral part of their identity—relentless attack, cohesive team play, and a never-ending quest for excellence. This night's performance, commanding and clinical against a strong PSG side, is a testament to their resurgence and solidifies their status as one of Europe's teams to beat."
