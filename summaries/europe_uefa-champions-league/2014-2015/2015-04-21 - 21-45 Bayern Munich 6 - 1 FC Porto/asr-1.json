commentary last week,\n20:29 Comment: they were so good down the middle... Hang on a minute.\n20:32 Comment: Mola!\n20:33 Comment: Good strike, little deflection, just helped the goalkeeper take the sting off the shot.\n20:38 Comment: I was going to say, the only way I thought they were going to get in and around Porto\n20:42 Comment: was to use that width, and tonight they've got that,\n20:44 Comment: and to be fair, I don't think it's been five yards from the touchline,\n20:47 Comment: this left-hand side, just pulling the full-back out towards them,\n20:50 Comment: and that's given a couple of times down those inside right and left flanks\n20:53 Comment: for Lewandowski and Muller to make those kind of runs,\n20:56 Comment: and obviously on the right-hand side they'll be doing exactly the same\n21:1 Comment: with Thomas Muller at times, but again, here you go,\n21:4 Comment: Goetz, a wide right, Bernat down the left.\n21:7 Comment: Goetz, a support from Bernat,\n21:9 Comment: matching his run every inch of the way,\n21:11 Comment: across all the way through to Lahm.\n21:14 Comment: Connected behind for a Bayern Munich corner.\n21:17 Comment: Lewandowski complaining, he felt he was fouled in the build-up.\n21:21 Comment: I thought he's been fouled five or six times tonight,\n21:23 Comment: he's let it go.\n21:25 Comment: He was in the wars in the first leg, and he's going to be in the wars\n21:28 Comment: for the next 70-odd minutes as well, I'm afraid.\n21:32 Comment: Certainly, there's an amazing turnaround when you think that 3-1,\n21:35 Comment: and a lot of people are thinking, it's a tough one for Bayern,\n21:37 Comment: they couldn't have started the game any better,\n21:39 Comment: including, of course, that goal after 14 minutes.\n21:43 Comment: Xabi Alonso's delivery, attacked by Badstuber,\n21:46 Comment: and on by Boateng!\n21:52 Comment: 22 minutes played, and the deficit is wiped out.\n21:58 Comment: Bayern's electric start.\n22:1 Comment: 3-3 on aggregates.\n22:4 Comment: Sensational, absolutely sensational,\n22:6 Comment: they took a bit of a stick last week, Boateng,\n22:8 Comment: for getting conked for the third goal from Jackson Martinez.\n22:11 Comment: It was too quick for him, and tonight...\n22:14 Comment: It's his turn to be celebrating.\n22:17 Comment: Bubbling about the ball a bit,\n22:19 Comment: he gets up above everybody, gets enough on it.\n22:22 Comment: Fabiano's outstretched fingertips cannot keep the ball from getting out.\n22:26 Comment: Corner, one at the back post, Badstuber pops up!\n22:30 Comment: It's a great... He gets just enough, doesn't he?\n22:33 Comment: Just enough on it. It's a great header.\n22:36 Comment: Doesn't look as if there's anything Casemiro can do about it,\n22:38 Comment: as the ball comes back over, and he wins the header.\n22:41 Comment: Oh, agonising for the goalkeeper.\n22:44 Comment: Sensational for Boateng, look how high up he gets,\n22:47 Comment: gets a really good contact on the ball as well.\n22:51 Comment: Brilliant. Wow, what an opening, 20-odd minutes.\n22:57 Comment: You listen to a lot of people who say they don't need to go out and win it\n23:1 Comment: in the first 22 minutes or so, the first half of the first half,\n23:5 Comment: well, as it stands, that's exactly what they've done.\n23:8 Comment: It's a line that would see them go through as it stands on away goals.\n23:13 Comment: But you do sense that their goal-scoring business\n23:16 Comment: with the evening Bayern Munich is far from over yet.\n23:21 Comment: Xabi Alonso, Bernat.\n23:27 Comment: Cherezma's challenge, Bayern Munich's free kick.\n23:31 Comment: Lopetegui, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, keep your hands down,\n23:35 Comment: don't get dragged into it.\n23:37 Comment: Cherezma's had a little pop at him there,\n23:39 Comment: and he's really taken the bait.\n23:41 Comment: Really taken the bait.\n23:44 Comment: He'll probably book the both of them here.\n23:47 Comment: He didn't really have to get dragged into that, Bernat.\n23:52 Comment: Just watch this when he goes to ground, it's a foul.\n23:56 Comment: I don't know if he needs the extra roll as he looks up to the referee,\n23:59 Comment: and watch this.\n24:2 Comment: That's cheeky, and then the push comes in,\n24:5 Comment: just gets dragged in, takes the bait a little bit.\n24:12 Comment: Luckily for both of them, Martin Saez got on with it.\n24:20 Comment: Our players, I'm sure, would have been rolling around on the ground\n24:23 Comment: as a result of that push.\n24:25 Comment: Cherezma at least not bringing those particular skills into play.\n24:28 Comment: The atmosphere electric now in the Allianz.\n24:33 Comment: And Sturber's left footed delivery.\n24:37 Comment: Lahm.\n24:38 Comment: Boateng.\n24:44 Comment: That's where Bayern have been good tonight, Bill.\n24:46 Comment: The ball's come into the box and it's gone long.\n24:49 Comment: It's not been cleared distance-wise by a Porto player,\n24:52 Comment: it's been kept in play by a red shirt to keep the ball in the box.\n24:56 Comment: Just think, let's just say 30 minutes ago,\n24:59 Comment: Lopetegui was saying, don't lose a goal in the first half,\n25:2 Comment: keep everything nice and tight, we've got a two-goal cushion.\n25:6 Comment: 25 minutes into the game, all gone.\n25:11 Comment: The best-laid plans.\n25:13 Comment: Thiago.\n25:43 Comment: Of course, now got to this situation.\n25:46 Comment: It's Porto that's going to have to change their game play,\n25:49 Comment: their tactics, etc.\n25:51 Comment: If they're going to try and get back into the game,\n25:53 Comment: because Bayern will keep the ball at the back for as long as they want.\n25:56 Comment: It'll go left to right, and it'll come all the way back.\n25:59 Comment: They do not need to do any more in terms of goals.\n26:3 Comment: This is enough to take them through, of course.\n26:5 Comment: They'll probably look for more.\n26:7 Comment: But certainly they will dominate possession\n26:9 Comment: and dominate the way they play.\n26:12 Comment: The way the game will go,\n26:14 Comment: if Porto don't come out and try and change something else.\n26:24 Comment: Lahm.\n26:25 Comment: Moula.\n26:26 Comment: Lewandowski!\n26:32 Comment: What a night this is turning into for Bayern Munich.\n26:36 Comment: Belying the statistics and the history books,\n26:39 Comment: what's first-leg deficits do to you?\n26:42 Comment: They are running riots.\n26:45 Comment: The goal's magnificent.\n26:46 Comment: Philipp Lahm is just simply a world-class football player.\n26:50 Comment: He's a world champion, and what he does for this goal is magnificent.\n26:53 Comment: Falls long, he keeps it in,\n26:55 Comment: follies it exactly where he wants it,\n26:57 Comment: he knows that Moula's near the post,\n26:59 Comment: but Thomas Moula's touch to dink it up to an area\n27:2 Comment: that Lewandowski's in is superb.\n27:5 Comment: That's not a shot, that's lead-up for Lewandowski.\n27:8 Comment: And he does the rest cos he's that good.\n27:10 Comment: It's a magnificent goal, absolutely different class.\n27:13 Comment: You could have taken that straight off Seben Ostrasa,\n27:16 Comment: where the training ground is, cos that is how good it is.\n27:19 Comment: 3-0, and they deserve every bit of this,\n27:22 Comment: cos they have completely torn Porto apart in just under 30 minutes.\n27:27 Comment: Well, if you go from when Thiago gave them the lead on the night\n27:31 Comment: to when Lewandowski powered in that third...\n27:35 Comment: 13 minutes.\n27:57 Comment: Lewandowski going on the ground again,\n28:0 Comment: Martin Atkinson unoppressed again.\n28:4 Comment: Did you say they got seven against Sunday, Bill?\n28:8 Comment: Yeah, seven away at Roma, seven here against Shakhtar in the last knockout round.\n28:12 Comment: They're looking the mood again, don't they?\n28:14 Comment: Big time, and considering they don't have Robben,\n28:17 Comment: they don't have Ribery, they don't have David Alaba,\n28:20 Comment: Schweinsteiger's on the bench.\n28:22 Comment: There's plenty more that can come in and help the cause\n28:25 Comment: if they do manage to get to the next stage of the competition.\n28:27 Comment: You can see they are absolutely shell-shocked,\n28:29 Comment: they cannot believe what's happened.\n28:31 Comment: And this has been exactly what Guardiola was needing.\n28:34 Comment: After all, the internal things that's been going on at Bayern this week,\n28:38 Comment: all the troubles with the doctors, his decisions, etc.\n28:45 Comment: Right now that's all forgotten,\n28:47 Comment: and everybody's bouncing in the right direction.\n28:55 Comment: Goal!\n29:7 Comment: Despite all the euphoria around the stadium just now,\n29:11 Comment: just putting into context exactly where we lie,\n29:15 Comment: Porto needs to get a goal here,\n29:17 Comment: then that's the only scoreline that would take us to extra time.\n29:21 Comment: Goal!\n29:26 Comment: Karesma gets the corner.\n29:28 Comment: First one I think as well, isn't it?\n29:30 Comment: They haven't really been anywhere near...\n29:32 Comment: In fact, I genuinely don't remember Manuel Neuer even touching the ball,\n29:35 Comment: and he does normally like to come out 30 yards and goal,\n29:38 Comment: but I haven't even seen him do that yet.\n29:42 Comment: He may be pressed into some sort of action here.\n29:45 Comment: Goal!\n29:48 Comment: It's a Karesma delivery,\n29:50 Comment: towards Casemiro.\n29:55 Comment: Muller.\n29:57 Comment: And flooding forward, that was an important challenge made by Jackson Martinez.\n30:2 Comment: That's a good job he made it as well,\n30:4 Comment: because if Thomas Muller gets this and plays it into the path of Philipp Lahm,\n30:8 Comment: then they're gone again, Bayern.\n30:10 Comment: I was just about to say at the corner there,\n30:12 Comment: it's not a foul, it's a block from Martinez,\n30:15 Comment: and then just momentum between each other.\n30:19 Comment: I was going to say maybe a set piece at the corner is the only way\n30:22 Comment: they're going to manage to get any joy tonight,\n30:25 Comment: because in open play at the moment,\n30:28 Comment: there's no chance of Jackson Martinez,\n30:30 Comment: who's completely on his own,\n30:32 Comment: because Brahimi and Karesma are really in a five-man midfield,\n30:35 Comment: which is, at the moment in time,\n30:37 Comment: hardly getting any contact either.\n30:39 Comment: The way this one is playing out,\n30:41 Comment: as far as Porto's hopes in the match go,\n30:43 Comment: they've just got to get through to half-time\n30:45 Comment: without any further damage inflicted.\n30:47 Comment: Yeah, I think so, Bill.\n30:49 Comment: I think that's what Lopetegui will be thinking as well,\n30:52 Comment: his players are obviously hoping they might sneak something,\n30:55 Comment: but like I'm saying, in open play,\n30:57 Comment: it's not a chance for them to get away.\n30:59 Comment: It's a chance for them to get away.\n31:8 Comment: Sneak something, but like I'm saying,\n31:10 Comment: in open play at the moment Bayern are completely dominating possession.\n31:13 Comment: That kind of pass wasn't there last week.\n31:15 Comment: Nearly.\n31:16 Comment: Much better tonight from back and to middle, all to front.\n31:20 Comment: That's when Bayern really tear teams apart with that precise,\n31:23 Comment: quick passing, one in two touches,\n31:25 Comment: very difficult to close down.\n31:29 Comment: Salah by Rafinha, that was the intent.\n31:38 Comment: And it's not going to wait until half-time to make changes, Julen Lopetegui.\n31:54 Comment: Diego Reyes, who started the match ahead of Ricardo,\n31:58 Comment: there were thoughts that Ricardo would play a bit more.\n32:0 Comment: He's not going to play.\n32:7 Comment: There were thoughts that Ricardo would play.\n32:8 Comment: He must have picked up an injury here, Diego Reyes.\n32:10 Comment: It's a light-for-light swap.\n32:14 Comment: Or is it a case of twisted blood?\n32:16 Comment: Yeah, well, there's no way it can be light-for-light just because it's 3-0.\n32:20 Comment: It's got to be an injury for Diego Reyes.\n32:22 Comment: He may have picked up something at the weekend when he played centre-half.\n32:25 Comment: He's been called out of position immediately after introduction\n32:28 Comment: to allow Götze to get forward.\n32:32 Comment: Again Götze's position there.\n32:33 Comment: Thiago driving into that penalty area.\n32:36 Comment: Sorry about that, I was going to say Götze's position there.\n32:38 Comment: His start position way out on this touchline.\n32:41 Comment: You get someone as good as Boateng who can ping that 60-70 yard ball\n32:45 Comment: right onto his feet.\n32:46 Comment: Again, look, wide for Philipp Lahm, really dragging the full-backs out,\n32:50 Comment: giving so much more space within the 18-yard box\n32:53 Comment: to get it into somebody's feet.\n32:55 Comment: Good stuff from Bayern tonight.\n33:6 Comment: Mullah.\n33:27 Comment: Well, he spotted that one off the ball from Hector Herrera\n33:30 Comment: and whether for that one or for those that preceded it,\n33:33 Comment: it's a yellow card for the Mexican.\n33:35 Comment: Take your pick, take your pick.\n33:38 Comment: He's given them just over half an hour,\n33:40 Comment: he's said four or five of those.\n33:42 Comment: And eventually, he's miles late, isn't he?\n33:45 Comment: And clumsy.\n33:53 Comment: Götze.\n33:56 Comment: Keresma.\n33:59 Comment: No way out again for Porto.\n34:1 Comment: Thiago.\n34:2 Comment: Well, having just been penalised,\n34:5 Comment: Hector Herrera had a little nudge there,\n34:7 Comment: which saw the free kick taken a little too quickly.\n34:17 Comment: Lewandowski.\n34:21 Comment: That's his challenge, sure it comes to Xabi Alonso,\n34:24 Comment: now Lewandowski.\n34:25 Comment: Shoulder to shoulder is what Robert Lewandowski felt,\n34:28 Comment: Martin Atkinson felt a little differently.\n34:31 Comment: It looked as if it was a 50-50, doesn't it?\n34:33 Comment: Shoulder to shoulder.\n34:34 Comment: It's just that he was plenty strong enough to keep position.\n34:39 Comment: Martin's feeling a little bit sorry for him.\n34:44 Comment: He certainly lived up to expectations,\n34:45 Comment: he genuinely didn't know what way it was going to go.\n34:48 Comment: He spoke to him about it,\n34:49 Comment: he spoke to him about it,\n34:54 Comment: he spoke to a few people today that thought,\n34:56 Comment: you wouldn't be surprised if Bayern are three up by half-time.\n34:58 Comment: And my goodness, they're right.\n35:0 Comment: And in they come again, through Thomas Muller.\n35:3 Comment: Oh, it's gone in!\n35:7 Comment: This is Bayern's night, all right.\n35:18 Comment: Still ten minutes to play in the first half,\n35:20 Comment: and Bayern Munich lead by four goals to nil,\n35:23 Comment: 5-3 on aggregate.\n35:27 Comment: My goodness, absolutely incredible.\n35:29 Comment: Incredible.\n35:30 Comment: This is when you do know it is your night's strike.\n35:33 Comment: Oh, it's a wicked deflection,\n35:34 Comment: and even then the goalkeeper really probably could have\n35:36 Comment: cleared it.\n35:37 Comment: It's a hit off Bruno Martin, isn't it?\n35:40 Comment: I think off the big Dutch defender it does.\n35:42 Comment: And just there, oh,\n35:43 Comment: through the legs of the goalkeeper Fabiano,\n35:45 Comment: he cannot believe it.\n35:47 Comment: And Thomas Muller said,\n35:48 Comment: we don't need a miracle,\n35:49 Comment: we just need a really good performance.\n35:51 Comment: That's a miracle how that's ended up in the back of the net.\n35:53 Comment: It has.\n35:55 Comment: 35 minutes, 36 minutes.\n35:58 Comment: 4-0 Munich.\n36:10 Comment: Questions were asked of Bayern Munich,\n36:12 Comment: questions were asked of Pep Guardiola.\n36:15 Comment: They've been answered.\n36:18 Comment: Jackson Martinez looks in some trouble.\n36:20 Comment: He's going to need some attention by the look of things.\n36:25 Comment: They came to the home of the Bielkeller,\n36:27 Comment: hoping that there'd be a party for them afterwards.\n36:29 Comment: The Porto fans, as it is,\n36:32 Comment: sorrows will need to be drowned.\n36:35 Comment: They're completely shell-shocked, aren't they?\n36:37 Comment: It doesn't seem an awful lot in that one, does it?\n36:40 Comment: Nobody's been out for quite a while.\n36:42 Comment: Jackson Martinez.\n36:44 Comment: They've just put a little strain on him.\n36:45 Comment: He's all right.\n36:46 Comment: Good news for Porto.\n36:48 Comment: If they're going to get back into this game, somehow.\n36:53 Comment: Maybe they have to just revert to the tactics from last week.\n36:56 Comment: It's really press Bayern as high as they can,\n36:58 Comment: not let them come through them as easy as they have done.\n37:1 Comment: Try and win the ball in this kind of area.\n37:4 Comment: Brahimi.\n37:6 Comment: Muffinha matching his run.\n37:8 Comment: Taking it away from the Al-Jazeera.\n37:10 Comment: Torres.\n37:11 Comment: Jackson Martinez.\n37:13 Comment: Goes down.\n37:15 Comment: And is penalised for simulation.\n37:19 Comment: I think he's just looked for a little bit too much advantage there.\n37:23 Comment: I think he's expecting the challenge on him.\n37:28 Comment: Matt Matkinson is right on the spot.\n37:32 Comment: He's got a bit of a chance.\n37:36 Comment: He's got a chance.\n37:37 Comment: He's right on the spot.\n37:40 Comment: Get a better look here.\n37:41 Comment: Little turn away.\n37:42 Comment: Is it a touch on him?\n37:44 Comment: No.\n37:45 Comment: Spot on, referee.\n37:46 Comment: Absolutely spot on.\n37:47 Comment: Here's a little look back as well as though I've been fouled.\n37:51 Comment: No, you weren't.\n37:53 Comment: And won't be doing that again.\n38:7 Comment: Go on.\n38:24 Comment: Casemiro.\n38:26 Comment: Challenged by Thiago.\n38:29 Comment: Lahm.\n38:31 Comment: Muller.\n38:32 Comment: Lewandowski.\n38:34 Comment: And Bernat denied at the end by Keresma.\n38:37 Comment: One and two touch football.\n38:38 Comment: They really are one of the best\n38:42 Comment: Bayern.\n38:43 Comment: They really are.\n38:44 Comment: It's very difficult to try and keep the players.\n38:45 Comment: To be fair, it's a good job.\n38:47 Comment: He goes with Bernat there, the defender.\n38:49 Comment: If he doesn't, it's a shot on target again.\n38:53 Comment: Bad Stuber all the way up from the back\n38:57 Comment: to take this with his left peg as a corner.\n39:4 Comment: Keresma.\n39:9 Comment: Bad Stuber the intercept and now Bernat.\n39:17 Comment: Xabi Alonso.\n39:19 Comment: To Thiago.\n39:21 Comment: To Lahm.\n39:24 Comment: Thiago.\n39:27 Comment: Lahm.\n39:28 Comment: Makano couldn't clear.\n39:29 Comment: Muller hungrier to get there than Casemiro.\n39:31 Comment: Doing so well.\n39:32 Comment: Now Lewandowski.\n39:35 Comment: It's blistering from Bayern Munich.\n39:38 Comment: Porto quite simply blown away\n39:41 Comment: in a breathtaking first half.\n39:44 Comment: What a goal this is.\n39:45 Comment: What a goal.\n39:46 Comment: He is one of the best Lewandowski.\n39:48 Comment: All he needs is half a yard but it doesn't matter.\n39:51 Comment: He's got a great goal.\n40:19 Comment: And boom.\n40:20 Comment: Forget about diving for it.\n40:21 Comment: Between the legs of the defender.\n40:23 Comment: But the part Thomas Muller plays in it is absolutely different class.\n40:27 Comment: Oh, what a finish.\n40:29 Comment: What a finish.\n40:30 Comment: Five-nil Bayern.\n40:31 Comment: No extra time tonight, Bill.\n40:32 Comment: Not now.\n40:33 Comment: Added extra numbers on the scoreboard.\n40:34 Comment: That's about it.\n40:35 Comment: Possibly.\n40:36 Comment: What a start for Bayern.\n40:37 Comment: Even scoring after 14 minutes gets you back in the game.\n40:38 Comment: It just shows you psychologically I think that you're going to be able to do it.\n40:39 Comment: You're going to be able to do it.\n40:45 Comment: Even scoring after 14 minutes gets you back in the game.\n40:46 Comment: It just shows you psychologically I think that you're going to be able to do it.\n40:47 Comment: You're going to be able to do it.\n41:2 Comment: He's a lucky boy, Bill.\n41:12 Comment: That's a really bad challenge from Badstuber.\n41:14 Comment: That's a two-footer.\n41:18 Comment: Really bad challenge.\n41:19 Comment: Had a good game as well.\n41:20 Comment: He knows he's got a way with one there.\n41:22 Comment: Watch this one.\n41:23 Comment: Oh, my goodness me.\n41:26 Comment: If he doesn't get the ball first there, regardless of how the momentum takes him through to Karesma.\n41:31 Comment: It's hard not to argue that that's a dangerous challenge.\n41:33 Comment: Yeah, he shouldn't be tackling like that.\n41:35 Comment: He can go on one foot.\n41:36 Comment: He can go to the side.\n41:37 Comment: Karesma's not exactly going to come in and throw himself in at it.\n41:42 Comment: And I think Badstuber's been very, very lucky there.\n41:49 Comment: Oh, my God.\n41:50 Comment: Not even the control there, giving the ball back so quickly to Bayern.\n41:54 Comment: The free kick was really, really poorly executed there.\n41:58 Comment: Guys in the end of the box, you've got to get them in there.\n42:0 Comment: You try and flick it through to Maicon and he's trying to control it with his hip.\n42:4 Comment: They have completely and utterly psychologically been an incredible start.\n42:9 Comment: Absolutely unbelievable.\n42:13 Comment: 100 games in charge of Bayern coming up tonight for Pep Guardiola.\n42:18 Comment: Exactly the way that he'd want to mark it.\n42:23 Comment: His side turning on the style and doing it, as we touched on already,\n42:27 Comment: without all those key players, the two Rs, Robbery and...\n42:32 Comment: Robbery?\n42:33 Comment: Robben and Ribery. I'll combine them into one.\n42:35 Comment: This has not been robbery.\n42:38 Comment: Not yet, anyway.\n42:39 Comment: It might be robbery if Porto come back and win it 6-5, possibly,\n42:42 Comment: which I would doubt very much.\n42:44 Comment: But certainly you're right.\n42:45 Comment: Without the three main guys, he will get Schwansteig on the bench.\n42:49 Comment: This is still... People in Europe, all the other teams are going to look at the starting team sheet.\n42:54 Comment: It's not a huge big difference, apart from Dante in the first leg in Porto.\n42:58 Comment: They didn't play well, it was a good-going night for the Portuguese,\n43:1 Comment: but they have been quite simply blown away and it ain't finished yet.\n43:5 Comment: Here they come again. Moula looking for Lewandowski.\n43:9 Comment: Casemiro.\n43:29 Comment: Guerreiro's man.\n43:40 Comment: I can't believe I'm going to say this, but if Lewandowski gets the third one,\n43:44 Comment: I don't care if it's the next one minute or the next one,\n43:47 Comment: you take him off immediately, because he's done his bit now.\n43:50 Comment: It looks as though Bayern are heading to the semi-finals.\n43:52 Comment: They've got a big game at home in the weekend against Hertha Berlin,\n43:55 Comment: and they've got Dortmund in the cup semi-final at home here.\n43:58 Comment: Big game, that one.\n44:0 Comment: And they can actually win the league if it all goes their way in the weekend against Hertha.\n44:10 Comment: I'm going to say their attitude was perfect coming into the game.\n44:14 Comment: I knew they were up against it, I knew they had to move the ball quick.\n44:17 Comment: They certainly played better than they did in the first leg,\n44:20 Comment: and boy have they done that, there's that wide switch again.\n44:23 Comment: So much space for Munich tonight.\n44:26 Comment: Bayern Moula, alarm of the reception committee, Lewandowski.\n44:42 Comment: Now by Torres.\n44:48 Comment: One back by Xabi Alonso.\n44:51 Comment: Alarm.\n44:57 Comment: The lays are out, and we're not even at half-time yet.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: a touch of the ball, most of it was done defending\n0:2 Comment: because he's been chasing shadows, or should I say\n0:3 Comment: chasing a red shirt, and Bayern\n0:6 Comment: have got it spot on, they got the first goal\n0:8 Comment: and since then genuinely never looked back\n0:9 Comment: and the one in touch football tonight\n0:11 Comment: has been simply irresistible\n0:13 Comment: and right back into their stride\n0:16 Comment: Muller taking the shot\n0:17 Comment: Ricciardo caught out, gutter\n0:19 Comment: and for him that's a chance, he knows it\n0:24 Comment: you get a little\n0:25 Comment: fortune with a deflection to the back\n0:28 Comment: post, but what's this, this drop just nice on the\n0:29 Comment: volley and for someone as talented\n0:32 Comment: you'd expect him at least to hit the\n0:33 Comment: target, style was nice\n0:35 Comment: finish not quite the same\n0:38 Comment: that's Subha\n0:46 Comment: pressurised\n0:50 Comment: been able to do enough of that in the\n0:52 Comment: first half, put the pressure on Bayern at the back\n0:53 Comment: Martins Indy\n0:55 Comment: Brahimi\n0:57 Comment: first real time\n1:4 Comment: genuinely first real time\n1:7 Comment: in the match that they've got anywhere near the\n1:9 Comment: edge of the Bayern\n1:11 Comment: 18 yard box\n1:12 Comment: and even then there was just too many players\n1:15 Comment: in that central area for Brahimi to\n1:17 Comment: dance his way through\n1:24 Comment: that's something they've coped better with\n1:25 Comment: that long ball was used to\n1:27 Comment: a good effect\n1:27 Comment: in the first leg from Porto\n1:29 Comment: two centre halves tonight\n1:32 Comment: Nürburdanke dropped\n1:33 Comment: but Stuber in his place\n1:35 Comment: and Woutang kept his place\n1:37 Comment: he's bagged the goal and looked pretty solid\n1:39 Comment: Rafinha\n1:43 Comment: Thiago\n1:45 Comment: Götze\n1:47 Comment: Lewandowski and Müller\n1:56 Comment: offering just as much as possible for the first half\n1:57 Comment: all sc stret material\n2:10 Comment: K oder\n2:12 Comment: no\n2:14 Comment: to,\n2:15 Comment: prof submarine\n2:17 Comment: in elderly\n2:19 Comment: Blake\n2:23 Comment: Emerald\n2:23 Comment: the party\n2:25 Comment: Did Nummer\n2:27 Comment: Been able to knock out a German side over two legs of a European tie.\n2:34 Comment: That was very much on at kick-off.\n2:36 Comment: 22 minutes later, it was in shreds.\n2:39 Comment: My half-time in tatters.\n2:44 Comment: We shouldn't laugh, should we?\n2:45 Comment: They must be feeling pretty down and coming into the game\n2:48 Comment: pretty confident that they could sustain and defend better\n2:51 Comment: and really restrict Bayern to possession a good 35, 40 yards from goal.\n2:57 Comment: But the way Bayern played was simply fantastic.\n3:0 Comment: Guardiola's got it right, he's picked the right team.\n3:4 Comment: They have delivered.\n3:6 Comment: And I would imagine they haven't finished the scoring just yet.\n3:11 Comment: The five goals they have scored, as we touched on earlier,\n3:15 Comment: represents a match of their half-time scoreline in the Olympic Stadium in Rome.\n3:20 Comment: They went on to win that one 7-1.\n3:21 Comment: And also represents, five-nil down,\n3:27 Comment: the worst overall 90-minutes defeat that Porto have had in their European Cup history.\n3:41 Comment: It's the same start of the game, Bill,\n3:43 Comment: that home advantage in the Champions League is huge.\n3:46 Comment: It's genuinely huge.\n3:48 Comment: I certainly didn't think it would be this much of a difference.\n3:51 Comment: In only 40-odd minutes, or should I say 45 minutes of half-time in the 5-0 scoreline.\n3:57 Comment: Can this be paid really to any excitement we thought we might get\n4:0 Comment: in the last 15 minutes of the game when...\n4:3 Comment: I must admit, I did think it might be hanging in the balance.\n4:7 Comment: Well, we said it in the half-time analysis,\n4:9 Comment: but that goal inside the first quarter of an hour,\n4:11 Comment: the one that set them going, that Thiago Herra,\n4:14 Comment: absolutely crucial.\n4:16 Comment: It changed everything.\n4:16 Comment: Had they got Porto to 20, 25 minutes...\n4:20 Comment: Absolutely.\n4:20 Comment: ...and still hadn't conceded...\n4:21 Comment: ...he needed some nerves coming into play.\n4:24 Comment: I think it was pretty evident as well, Bill.\n4:25 Comment: When they got the first goal,\n4:27 Comment: actually, I thought Bayern were almost looking like\n4:28 Comment: there and then a yard quicker than Porto.\n4:31 Comment: You know, the decision-making, the passing, everything.\n4:34 Comment: The touch was better.\n4:35 Comment: And I think that's really put Porto on the back foot.\n4:39 Comment: Like I said as well, I'll say it again,\n4:41 Comment: psychologically, sometimes I've played in games\n4:43 Comment: when you just think, they just seem quicker, they just seem...\n4:48 Comment: You know, you're chasing your tail all the time,\n4:50 Comment: trying to get into the game,\n4:51 Comment: do something, trying to keep possession.\n4:55 Comment: But when Bayern are good, they're sensationally good.\n4:57 Comment: Yes!\n5:36 Comment: Martin Cindy...\n5:39 Comment: Rahimi...\n5:43 Comment: Ricciardo...\n5:47 Comment: The overlapping run for Maicon,\n5:49 Comment: having made up their brand,\n5:51 Comment: the ground he couldn't find the touch his first touches has got to be in the box there's not enough\n5:56 Comment: room beyond defender to take it past them i still see he's still doing a little bit of tactics\n6:6 Comment: well they've changed things a little bit in this second half haven't they put\n6:9 Comment: a you see

was only one goal with the huge slice of fortune\n8:17 Comment: from Muller from distance.\n8:18 Comment: Everything else was great football from Bayern.\n8:22 Comment: The possession has to be better.\n8:23 Comment: Move the ball quicker.\n8:24 Comment: Get it into areas where Bayern are struggling defensively.\n8:27 Comment: You've got to try and get it into those wider areas.\n8:29 Comment: Ricciardo's on in that right-hand side now.\n8:31 Comment: Been on the ball a couple of times.\n8:33 Comment: Giving the ball away there merely, that's what you don't want.\n8:35 Comment: Give it to Ricciardo.\n8:36 Comment: That's it. Try and move the ball into a position\n8:38 Comment: where you're going to at least look as if\n8:40 Comment: you're a Champions League team playing in the quarter-finals.\n9:2 Comment: Hector Herrera trying to invite Ricciardo forward.\n9:6 Comment: Oh, no!\n9:19 Comment: Ivan Marcano.\n9:22 Comment: Here's Martin Zindi.\n9:27 Comment: Marcano, the centre-half.\n9:30 Comment: Hector Herrera.\n9:36 Comment: Lewandowski.\n9:55 Comment: We talked about all the absentees for Bayern Munich.\n10:0 Comment: Alaba, Schweinsteiger, Robben and Ribery,\n10:3 Comment: among others, who've been missing for both legs.\n10:6 Comment: And, of course, the\n10:21 Comment: goalie, who's also been missing for both legs.\n10:21 Comment: He's a very, very good player.\n10:21 Comment: Really good player.\n10:21 Comment: I mean, he doesn't get many goals, does he?\n10:22 Comment: But certainly in terms of in the area where he plays to try and keep possession\n10:26 Comment: and make sure if you lose the ball, he's the one that's going to be\n10:29 Comment: biting around the ankles to try and get it back.\n10:31 Comment: He's been a very welcome return to the team,\n10:34 Comment: especially when there was obviously a few,\n10:36 Comment: missing like you already said.\n10:39 Comment: Keeps things ticking as well as he did there.\n10:41 Comment: Chance for Lewandowski.\n10:44 Comment: Now, Goethe.\n10:47 Comment: I think the other thing with him, Bill, is that I think Rolando trusts him.\n10:50 Comment: You know, he likes him.\n10:51 Comment: He trusts him.\n10:52 Comment: He knows he can do a good job for him in the middle of the park there.\n10:56 Comment: I think this is a foul.\n10:57 Comment: Better look here.\n10:58 Comment: Yeah, he's made no attempt to play the ball there, has he?\n11:6 Comment: Still the instructions come.\n11:12 Comment: Sort of manic instruction you'd expect with the match still tight.\n11:16 Comment: There's no let up from Bayern Munich.\n11:18 Comment: What does that tell you?\n11:19 Comment: Those pictures tell you.\n11:20 Comment: Five's good, but he doesn't want five.\n11:22 Comment: He wants six.\n11:22 Comment: He wants seven.\n11:23 Comment: He wants eight.\n11:25 Comment: He wants them to keep doing the right thing.\n11:26 Comment: He wants to keep the tempo high.\n11:28 Comment: And he wants players in the right position at the right time.\n11:32 Comment: It's a good opportunity, this.\n11:34 Comment: This is Goethe area.\n11:36 Comment: Goethe.\n11:41 Comment: There will probably be a few queuing up at 5-0 wanting to take a free kick.\n11:51 Comment: There they are.\n11:54 Comment: Out of that, who's taking it?\n11:57 Comment: Xabi Alonso.\n11:59 Comment: Surprised to say they're spoiled for choice from a situation such as this.\n12:4 Comment: Although it is far over.\n12:6 Comment: Bye.\n12:6 Comment: Xabi Alonso.\n12:12 Comment: Just doesn't quite get it to come down.\n12:14 Comment: Certainly going in that dangerous area.\n12:18 Comment: Posty stamped top left, but just can't quite get it to come down.\n12:21 Comment: Goal!\n13:6 Comment: A loose touch from Brahimi, allowed by a steal back.\n13:10 Comment: Lahm.\n13:25 Comment: I think that last little foray forward from Porto\n13:28 Comment: is exactly what's been missing tonight.\n13:30 Comment: Kind of 35 yards from goal\n13:31 Comment: and they get into a nice little area.\n13:34 Comment: Where the possession or the pass hasn't been good enough tonight.\n13:38 Comment: It's as though they've almost been scared to really throw men at Bayern.\n13:42 Comment: And they've been a little bit sparse when they get into those kind of areas.\n13:52 Comment: It would have been a big call from the coach, Julien Lopetegui,\n13:55 Comment: to adopt the same sort of high-pressing approach away here at Bayern\n13:59 Comment: as he did in the first leg.\n14:0 Comment: Well, they only did it a couple of times, didn't they,\n14:1 Comment: in the first 15 minutes when it was still 0-0.\n14:4 Comment: Or up to 14 minutes, I think it was.\n14:6 Comment: And they generally had played all right,\n14:8 Comment: but there was a huge attack, attack, attack from Bayern\n14:11 Comment: and the possession they had wasn't a matter of time, certainly.\n14:14 Comment: But they got the goal at such a good time\n14:17 Comment: that that gave Bayern even more momentum\n14:19 Comment: than the good momentum they'd started the game with.\n14:22 Comment: And I think, like we said already,\n14:24 Comment: it put Porto really on the back foot.\n14:25 Comment: And I think even from the front three, as it were,\n14:28 Comment: if you wanted to take Jackson Martinez, Brahimi and Karesma,\n14:34 Comment: who did such a good job in the first leg by pressing,\n14:37 Comment: including that help from the middle of the park,\n14:39 Comment: just simply got deeper and deeper and deeper.\n14:41 Comment: And there was no pressure put on Bayern after that.\n14:43 Comment: And Bayern certainly run out and decided to score almost at will.\n14:52 Comment: But you're right, Will,\n14:52 Comment: it would have been a big call to do exactly the same thing.\n14:55 Comment: It would certainly have been very, very open.\n14:58 Comment: But even then, playing the way he did,\n15:1 Comment: it simply wasn't enough, was it?\n15:2 Comment: Because Bayern are simply too good.\n15:4 Comment: They're going forward and make too many chances.\n15:9 Comment: Lovely one-touch stuff from Bayern Munich again.\n15:14 Comment: Bernat.\n15:15 Comment: Corner.\n15:20 Comment: Confident little player.\n15:21 Comment: Likes to get forward.\n15:24 Comment: Starts the game at left back,\n15:25 Comment: but he knows he can get into those forward areas.\n15:29 Comment: Good block from Neves.\n15:31 Comment: That's one a lot of admirers, actually, of Juan Bernat,\n15:33 Comment: with his...\n15:34 Comment: his performances for Bayern in the Bundesliga\n15:35 Comment: and in Europe this season.\n15:37 Comment: I was going to say, he hasn't missed many games, but...\n15:42 Comment: He's not just left back, he's played in the middle,\n15:45 Comment: he's played on the left-hand side,\n15:46 Comment: he's played out wide left when Ribery's maybe gone off\n15:49 Comment: and he's pushed further forward.\n15:51 Comment: He's certainly had a good season.\n15:53 Comment: And I guess I'm not happy with something.\n15:56 Comment: I'm not saying he's pulling it.\n16:1 Comment: Well, I've certainly seen the amusing side of...\n16:4 Comment: of Neves.\n16:4 Comment: What Herrera was saying.\n16:11 Comment: Boutin.\n16:13 Comment: That's it, trying to bring it down.\n16:15 Comment: It's unlucky.\n16:16 Comment: Just a little bit too much on it from Jérôme Boutin.\n16:19 Comment: It's well worked that.\n16:21 Comment: Let the ball come all the way out.\n16:24 Comment: Defenders are ball-watching.\n16:25 Comment: Try and get one of your little players in and beyond.\n16:27 Comment: What's he saying?\n16:28 Comment: What is he saying?\n16:30 Comment: I don't know.\n16:31 Comment: Hopefully it's still pretty intense, isn't it?\n16:34 Comment: switching to play\n16:36 Comment: some sort of managerial dance off\n16:43 Comment: I think it might have been\n16:58 Comment: Lewandowski\n16:58 Comment: wanted too much time on the ball there\n17:0 Comment: Bruno Martins, Indy\n17:1 Comment: Rafinha much more alert\n17:3 Comment: and there and encapsulated\n17:6 Comment: has really been the difference\n17:7 Comment: between the two sides tonight\n17:9 Comment: I like that word Bill\n17:10 Comment: I think that might be the one for tonight\n17:12 Comment: alert\n17:12 Comment: I think Bayern have been much more\n17:14 Comment: at it and alert tonight\n17:16 Comment: and I think they've been too sleepy Poto\n17:18 Comment: Muller\n17:20 Comment: how does that not go in\n17:22 Comment: Michael must have thought\n17:25 Comment: scored their own goal there\n17:26 Comment: that's a great ball into the box from Muller\n17:28 Comment: again\n17:30 Comment: one, two touch\n17:32 Comment: good stuff\n17:33 Comment: Muller stays onside\n17:34 Comment: drills this right across\n17:35 Comment: he does well Mike\n17:37 Comment: I don't know how much I knew about it right enough\n17:42 Comment: oh\n17:48 Comment: trousers are ripped\n17:49 Comment: that's the Wurst in Munich you know\n17:54 Comment: puts the weight on you\n18:3 Comment: Louise\n18:3 Comment: Su Estoy\n18:31 Comment: Rocksmart\n18:31 Comment: to swell up Bill\n18:32 Comment: I'm sure he can afford\n18:36 Comment: a new suit\n18:53 Comment: Martin Zinder\n18:54 Comment: not really been\n19:5 Comment: in the races tonight\n19:6 Comment: Porto\n19:6 Comment: a little disappointing\n19:7 Comment: from everyone that's\n19:8 Comment: travelled thinking\n19:9 Comment: this could be one of\n19:10 Comment: their biggest nights\n19:11 Comment: in Europe\n19:11 Comment: and it was\n19:13 Comment: pretty much put out\n19:14 Comment: after the first half hour\n19:16 Comment: Karl-Heinz Rummenigge\n19:17 Comment: on the right\n19:18 Comment: oh\n19:19 Comment: he's not happy either\n19:22 Comment: more gas gave him\n19:23 Comment: I think he said\n19:24 Comment: that means\n19:25 Comment: we need to keep\n19:26 Comment: the tempo up\n19:27 Comment: and therein lies\n19:31 Comment: one of the\n19:32 Comment: issues that\n19:33 Comment: as manager of\n19:34 Comment: Bayern Munich\n19:35 Comment: you have to deal with\n19:36 Comment: so many illustrious\n19:37 Comment: former players\n19:38 Comment: with an opinion\n19:39 Comment: yeah and with a\n19:40 Comment: history of being\n19:41 Comment: world class football\n19:42 Comment: players\n19:43 Comment: he's only just\n19:48 Comment: come on\n19:49 Comment: he's had a couple\n19:49 Comment: of bad tackles\n19:50 Comment: Ricardo\n19:50 Comment: and maybe let's just\n19:51 Comment: see\n19:51 Comment: could have timed\n19:53 Comment: them a little better\n19:53 Comment: as a yellow card\n19:56 Comment: for him\n20:2 Comment: and obsessed\n20:9 Comment: so\n20:13 Comment: am I\n20:15 Comment: thank Abel\n20:17 Comment: thank the\n20:20 Comment: media\n20:22 Comment: thank you\n20:23 Comment: Götze\n20:25 Comment: and that continues his run\n20:28 Comment: Götze slipped away from Casemiro\n20:32 Comment: he's been better tonight, much better Mario Götze\n20:34 Comment: that's what you expect of him\n20:36 Comment: taking those little areas inside those pockets\n20:38 Comment: where he's difficult to pick up\n20:39 Comment: keep possession, don't give it away\n20:41 Comment: down in the box there\n20:44 Comment: looking at Martin Atkinson for a penalty\n20:46 Comment: nothing given\n20:53 Comment: Oliver Torres\n21:23 Comment: a touch in the back of Brahimi by Boateng\n21:28 Comment: one change left available to Julien Lopetegui\n21:37 Comment: he's going to make it now\n21:39 Comment: and it's Brahimi who comes off\n21:41 Comment: amazing isn't it\n21:51 Comment: the two players we thought would cause\n21:52 Comment: Bayern a lot of problems tonight\n21:55 Comment: Carismo and Brahimi\n21:56 Comment: off after\n21:58 Comment: 67 minutes\n22:0 Comment: and it just simply hasn't gone for them at all tonight\n22:9 Comment: Ruben Neves\n22:10 Comment: here's Marcano\n22:13 Comment: and\n22:36 Comment: okay\n22:41 Comment: but we\n22:44 Comment: got 67\n22:45 Comment: going to\n22:47 Comment: 20 odd minutes\n22:49 Comment: to go\n22:49 Comment: pretty dejected\n22:52 Comment: Porto\n22:52 Comment: bench.\n22:59 Comment: Lewandowski.\n23:22 Comment: He looks to the far post.\n23:32 Comment: Ricciardo can't do anything with that.\n23:37 Comment: Any time they have got in a position today.\n23:41 Comment: He has done OK in the middle of the park.\n23:48 Comment: Picked up a booking.\n23:49 Comment: That was a good one.\n23:51 Comment: Well done, guys.\n23:52 Comment: He has been a good boy since then.\n23:54 Comment: He has put plenty of energy in.\n23:56 Comment: Any time they go in that kind of position,\n23:58 Comment: the cross hasn't been good enough,\n23:59 Comment: the pass hasn't been good enough.\n24:1 Comment: Probably the whole thing just hasn't been good enough\n24:4 Comment: for Porto tonight.\n24:5 Comment: It's a big step up coming to Munich,\n24:7 Comment: regardless of how much your lead might be.\n24:10 Comment: They were taught a very quick lesson in the first half.\n24:22 Comment: Lead in thisnost teacher will be?\n24:23 Comment: Not at all.\n24:34 Comment: Diago.\n24:36 Comment: Jotze.\n24:40 Comment: Evandro.\n24:43 Comment: Herrera carrying forward but not many going with him.\n24:46 Comment: but not many going with him.\n24:49 Comment: Marcano.\n24:50 Comment: Jackson Martínez.\n24:51 Comment: He's already been booked for simulation once, Jackson Martinez.\n24:56 Comment: Didn't look like there was too much contact there as he went to ground.\n24:59 Comment: Here's Ricciardo.\n25:3 Comment: Out by Lahm.\n25:7 Comment: Meccano.\n25:11 Comment: Oliver Torres.\n25:17 Comment: Meccano stopped it getting to Muller.\n25:19 Comment: Muller.\n25:29 Comment: Muller still on the way from Meccano.\n25:31 Comment: Meccano has brought down the German international.\n25:34 Comment: And out comes the card.\n25:37 Comment: I think he just read the situation there, Thomas Muller,\n25:40 Comment: and just got ahead of the big centre-half.\n25:43 Comment: There's no way he could let him just drive, drive beyond the halfway line.\n25:47 Comment: You can see he's got a proper grip there.\n25:49 Comment: Again, Martin Aikenson. He's had a good game tonight, Martin Aikenson.\n25:53 Comment: It's the right decision.\n25:56 Comment: Albeit the second half's been, to be fair, pretty easy for him to referee.\n26:0 Comment: His 5-0 at half-time almost.\n26:4 Comment: Comes the game, doesn't it?\n26:6 Comment: He's going to have a little bit of treatment.\n26:8 Comment: And Sebastian Roda looks as though he might be coming on.\n26:10 Comment: Did well on the first leg when he came on.\n26:13 Comment: He scored a cracker at the weekend in the win against Hoffenheim as well.\n26:17 Comment: Ronaldo!\n26:19 Comment: He'll add an energy to the midfield, for sure.\n26:26 Comment: Philipp Lahm doesn't look like he's too interested in what Pep Guardiola's got to say.\n26:30 Comment: He certainly gave him the shake-off there a little bit, didn't he?\n26:35 Comment: I think he was holding his groin a little bit there.\n26:37 Comment: That's not a good sign.\n26:39 Comment: The defence is not a department where they have too many options.\n26:45 Comment: Injury to Alaba.\n26:46 Comment: Off goes Rafinha.\n26:49 Comment: Philipp Lahm, of course, can drop back in.\n26:54 Comment: Sebastian Roda will go into midfield.\n27:3 Comment: Goethe.\n27:13 Comment: Ruben Neves.\n27:15 Comment: Mike Conn.\n27:16 Comment: Goal!\n27:18 Comment: pasa both...\n27:20 Comment: Pasa go all\n27:40 Comment: Jericho\n27:45 Comment: and Jackson Martinez is there to pounce\n27:51 Comment: consolation in the grand scheme of things\n27:56 Comment: but they have scored at the Allianz Arena\n27:58 Comment: Manuel Neuer will be absolutely spitting feathers\n28:3 Comment: he did not want to give a goal away\n28:4 Comment: it was the first real time that the possession has been better\n28:9 Comment: and he certainly used the ball into those wider areas\n28:11 Comment: and obviously Bayern have switched off\n28:13 Comment: he's probably just offside there Jackson Martinez\n28:16 Comment: good ball across into the box but\n28:17 Comment: he's maybe just a half yard offside\n28:20 Comment: but of course they say he's not contributing\n28:23 Comment: when the little ball is out to the right hand side\n28:25 Comment: nevertheless they get one back Porto\n28:28 Comment: 16 and a half minutes of normal time to play\n28:38 Comment: Porto may look at it\n28:40 Comment: but if they can get two more\n28:43 Comment: he'll catch up\n28:43 Comment: go through on the way goals\n28:44 Comment: a bit amazing wasn't it\n28:47 Comment: I suppose the opportunity there\n28:48 Comment: still got time\n28:51 Comment: rather unlikely\n28:53 Comment: but at least that was certainly better football from them\n28:56 Comment: albeit that Bayern will be kicking themselves\n28:59 Comment: and letting them get in\n29:2 Comment: just a little bit too easy\n29:3 Comment: I would think when asked about it afterwards\n29:8 Comment: Pep Guardiola would make a pretty strong case\n29:10 Comment: for it being offside against Jackson Martinez\n29:12 Comment: absolutely yeah\n29:12 Comment: I mean he's miles offside\n29:13 Comment: I mean I was going to say old school there\n29:17 Comment: my point being look if you're in the box\n29:19 Comment: and you're in that kind of position\n29:20 Comment: I don't care that fly's got to go up your offside\n29:23 Comment: end of\n29:23 Comment: it's ridiculous with this second phase thing\n29:26 Comment: Junon Lapetegui is appealing for a foul\n29:32 Comment: that's not going to be given\n29:33 Comment: well that goal from Porto\n29:37 Comment: just giving Bayern a little something to think about\n29:39 Comment: they're certainly playing with a little sprite\n29:43 Comment: a little extra injection in their step possibly\n29:47 Comment: maybe the thought of getting a couple more goals\n29:50 Comment: and doing the impossible\n29:51 Comment: might just be there for them maybe\n29:52 Comment: certainly the possession's been better\n29:56 Comment: and everything looks a little bit more hurried now\n29:58 Comment: it's a foul from Bad Stuber for sure\n30:13 Comment: a good night's game\n30:16 Comment: comes on\n30:21 Comment: 3-0\n30:23 Comment: 4-0\n30:23 Comment: 2-0\n30:25 Comment: 3-1\n30:28 Comment: and that annual goal\n30:30 Comment: at the closing of the next half\n30:32 Comment: 10 goals now in the two legs\n30:34 Comment: of a very entertaining tie\n30:36 Comment: All the seasons have\n30:38 Comment: been represented, really\n30:39 Comment: Bayern well off colour in the first\n30:41 Comment: Porto running right\n30:42 Comment: in the second\n30:43 Comment: small glimmer of hope for Porto\n30:48 Comment: another would make it interesting another would be sensational for for Porto and certainly for\n30:58 Comment: the last 15 minutes and certainly the way they're playing you're right there is a little step hang\n31:3 Comment: on a minute no foul Jackson Martinez still Jackson Martinez oh goodness gracious me\n31:13 Comment: very close to number two on the nine in quick succession for Jackson Martinez\n31:18 Comment: well he does fantastically well there it's originally just holding off the defender\n31:22 Comment: goes all the way around you see Bernat hits the deck that gives him the opportunity\n31:26 Comment: it's an angle he wants he's trying to get in the far corner he just pulls it a little wide\n31:31 Comment: all of a sudden\n31:32 Comment: you\n31:33 Comment: really got a really good chance there the tag we knows it was a great chance and\n31:40 Comment: Jackson Martinez having got one might I just thought I'm going to sneak another one in the\n31:43 Comment: corner here\n31:44 Comment: as far as Pep Guardiola is concerned the suit trousers are ripped the suit jacket's been\n31:53 Comment: discarded a quarter of an hour to play here to secure passage through to the semi-finals for\n32:1 Comment: Bayern Munich maintainers 100%\n32:3 Comment: final time\n32:7 Comment: the European competition是不是\n32:11 Comment: I got to say that this was an outstanding performance from junto\n32:12 Comment: Barça obviously but ya I will say thatnego\n32:19 Comment: this was a very good performance and setting all his record as manager European competition and not\n32:22 Comment: having gone out at this stage whether it be with Barcelona or and is one season with by thus

knees,\n41:56 Comment: and it's a completely mistimed challenge.\n41:59 Comment: He goes almost in with his knees and catches Thiago.\n42:2 Comment: Crazy challenge, isn't it?\n42:4 Comment: I think if he just goes in with one leg\n42:6 Comment: and tries to sweep it round, he'd probably got the ball.\n42:8 Comment: Two yellows is a red.\n42:11 Comment: If there was any doubt.\n42:16 Comment: He

    "summary": "The Allianz Arena was alive with anticipation as Bayern Munich hosted Porto in the second leg of their UEFA Champions League quarter-final clash. The atmosphere was electric, an unmistakable cauldron of noise fueling Bayern's quest to overturn a precarious first-leg deficit. Porto, in their dark blue kits, kicked off proceedings, but it was Bayern Munich who quickly asserted themselves on the pitch.\n\nFrom the very onset, Bayern Munich showcased their intent and intensity, knowing full well the significance of not exiting the Champions League at this stage for the first time in six seasons. There was an undeniable sense of urgency in their play as they sought to reclaim their standing in Europe.\n\nThe initial stages of the game saw Bayern monopolizing possession and applying relentless pressure. Manuel Neuer, despite being one of the world's best goalkeepers, cut a frustrated figure as Porto's Jackson Martinez tried to capitalize on any potential lapses from the Bayern defense. However, Neuer and his defenders were alert, ensuring that Porto's press didn't cause any early upsets. \n\nBayern's tactical setup saw Jerome Boateng attempting diagonal crosses to spread the play, often finding Juan Bernat or Mario Götze. This tactic kept Porto's defense on their toes and set the stage for Bayern’s offensive onslaught. In these early minutes, Bayern's defensive efforts were commendable too, with the likes of Rafinha and Xabi Alonso particularly proactive in nullifying Porto's counter-attacks.\n\nAs the minutes ticked by, the hosts began to show their attacking prowess. Bernat persistently advanced from his full-back position, and his interplay with Muller and Lewandowski started to expose cracks in Porto's defense. This relentless pressure culminated in a goal at the 14th minute with Thiago slotting home a precise header from Bernat's cross. The Allianz Arena erupted, aware that Bayern's comeback was well and truly on.\n\nThe early goal was more than just a scoreline change; it was a psychological blow to Porto. This was evident as Bayern continued to dominate possession and created multiple chances. The crowd, buoyed by the early strike, maintained their fervent support, ensuring that Bayern’s momentum never wavered.\n\nBy the 22nd minute, Bayern had drawn level on aggregate through a towering header from Jerome Boateng, capitalizing on a corner well-worked by Xabi Alonso. The German international rose above everyone else to connect with the cross, sending the ball past Porto's outstretched goalkeeper Fabiano. Bayern Munich had erased the two-goal deficit within 22 minutes of play, leaving Porto stunned and scrambling for composure.\n\nAs the first half progressed, Bayern Munich's fluid attack carved Porto open repeatedly. Lewandowski came close, hitting the post after some brilliant build-up play involving Thomas Muller. However, Bayern's persistent efforts soon paid off. The Polish striker found the net in the 26th minute, converting a sublime setup from Muller to put Munich ahead 3-0 on the night and 4-3 on aggregate. The combination play between Lahm, Muller, and Lewandowski for the goal was nothing short of spectacular, showcasing the attacking might and precision of Bayern’s frontline.\n\nThe tide of the game had wholly turned in Bayern's favor as they piled on more pressure, isolating Porto’s defenders, and exploiting the spaces. On the 36th minute, it was Thomas Muller himself who added to Porto's misery. His shot took a nasty deflection, catching Fabiano off guard and sending the ball agonizingly through the goalkeeper’s legs and into the net. Bayern Munich now led 4-0, translating to a 5-3 aggregate lead.\n\nThe first half concluded with Bayern Munich firmly in control and Porto left to rue their defensive lapses and inability to contain their opponents. Bayern's varied attacking strategies, industrious pressing, and defensive solidity rendered Porto powerless, resulting in an almost insurmountable deficit for the Portuguese side.\n\nThe second half commenced with Bayern Munich still riding high on their first-half dominance. Porto needed a miracle to overturn a four-goal deficit on the night, and it soon became clear that Bayern was not going to take their foot off the pedal.\n\nWhile Porto tried to press higher and create opportunities, Bayern's defensive rotation and structure held firm. Neuer was barely troubled, as Porto's attempts to penetrate through the flanks and centrally were thwarted repeatedly by an organized Bayern backline. All of Bayern's players, from full-backs Rafinha and Bernat to the defensive core of Boateng, Badstuber, and Alonso, displayed remarkable composure and tactical adherence.\n\nPorto did manage a brief foray into Bayern's half, bringing a semblance of threat as Brahimi and Jackson Martinez combined to test the defensive set-up of the hosts. However, Bayern's midfield, orchestrated superbly by Thiago and Alonso, regained control and pushed forward efficiently.\n\nIn the 57th minute, Bayern Munich added yet another goal, further cementing their dominance. Lewandowski received a precise cross, showcasing his predatory instincts as he steered the ball into the net, making it 5-0. The sheer clinical nature of Bayern’s attack illustrated the gulf in class on this high-stakes European night.\n\nPorto, desperate for a consolation, pushed forward with renewed intent but found Bayern's defense nearly impenetrable. It wasn’t until the 73rd minute that Porto managed to net a goal. Jackson Martinez capitalized on a rare lapse in Bayern’s defense, directing a cross from the right into the goal. While it was a minor solace, it did little to change the inevitability of Bayern’s triumph.\n\nIn the latter stages of the match, the tension briefly heightened as Porto tried to stir a comeback. However, their efforts were sporadic and lacked the incisiveness needed to breach Bayern’s resolute defense.\n\nTo cap off a near-perfect evening, Xabi Alonso scored a sublime free-kick in the 88th minute, curling the ball into the top corner and sealing Bayern Munich’s place in the semi-finals with a comprehensive 6-1 victory on the night, making it a staggering 7-4 on aggregate.\n\nAs the final whistle echoed through the Allianz Arena, it confirmed what had been an extraordinary turnaround. Bayern Munich had not only secured their place in the semi-finals but did so with an emphatic display of skill, resilience, and tactical brilliance. With this performance, they sent a strong message to the remaining teams in the competition, underlining their intent to reclaim European glory."
