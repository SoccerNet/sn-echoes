versus Sanchez probably wrong to compare\n30:19 Comment: Chambers rises it's Oxlade-Chamberlain who gives chase Tielemans there first\n30:26 Comment: some heads down young Tielemans looking a bit glum\n30:34 Comment: the manager horrible feeling for him game plan look to be going all right\n30:41 Comment: they were barking at the tree at one end\n30:46 Comment: but in three and a half minutes spell it's turning into a real tough night for\n30:52 Comment: them\n30:56 Comment: the ball to pick out Oxlade-Chamberlain\n31:0 Comment: that's a bomb did well get his body between man and ball there he sure did\n31:4 Comment: Oxlade-Chamberlain took a wonderful touch terrific ball to him again over the top\n31:8 Comment: of action pump\n31:10 Comment: that's a good one\n31:44 Comment: Delivery from Cazorla\n31:46 Comment: sent back where it came from\n31:56 Comment: FANS ROAR\n32:5 Comment: Murdasaka at the near post.\n32:7 Comment: And Dembele with time to clear.\n32:12 Comment: Well-worn routine at the near post.\n32:14 Comment: Flickon nearly paid dividends for Arsenal.\n32:16 Comment: They wanted to go here through Kozula.\n32:19 Comment: Murdasaka.\n32:26 Comment: A bit like a fish out of water there as all that intricate play was going on around him.\n32:33 Comment: Murdasaka, he's far better at trying to stop all that.\n32:45 Comment: Here's Pratt. Helps him onto Siriak.\n32:47 Comment: Back to Pratt.\n32:51 Comment: That's his shot away, but the block is by Callum Chambers.\n32:55 Comment: And it's a goal.\n32:56 Comment: A little careless from Arsenal again to allow that to develop.\n32:59 Comment: He's onto everything as quick as a flash, Pratt.\n33:1 Comment: And the one-two.\n33:3 Comment: Leaves a chance to open up.\n33:4 Comment: Surprised he cut back in, but when it came to him again,\n33:6 Comment: another deflection that could have gone anywhere from Chambers this time.\n33:11 Comment: Once again, Arsenal get away with a goal bound, as you could see.\n33:16 Comment: Delivery from Tielemans.\n33:18 Comment: Low trajectory that gave Arsenal plenty to think about.\n33:26 Comment: Terrific ball in, as you say.\n33:30 Comment: A lot of Arsenal shirts there, but the sheer pace and the power of Mbemba,\n33:34 Comment: who could keep Brzezinski a good knock.\n33:40 Comment: Another go with an outswinger.\n33:42 Comment: Couldn't find Mbemba.\n33:44 Comment: Alexis Sanchez trying to run it down, and Mbemba stops him.\n33:48 Comment: Pratt.\n33:52 Comment: Conte.\n33:56 Comment: Well read.\n33:58 Comment: As Anderlecht try and recover and try and put some nice passing moves together,\n34:2 Comment: some good balls into the box, but Arsenal just have to maintain the impetus now.\n34:6 Comment: Keep it.\n34:7 Comment: No dropping of spirits or dropping of aggression now.\n34:11 Comment: They've got this game well and truly by the scrub of the neck.\n34:14 Comment: The last thing they want to do is drop their standards\n34:17 Comment: and allow this Anderlecht team any sign of a way back in.\n34:22 Comment: I'm sure Arsene Wengel want to keep zipping it around, keep taking care.\n34:26 Comment: Here's Sampson.\n34:39 Comment: Gazzola.\n34:45 Comment: And that's it, Sanchez.\n34:47 Comment: Aaron Ramsey.\n34:54 Comment: The centre half coming forward.\n34:56 Comment: has made a sack

Comment: Should be able to keep this one in, in the corner,\n37:50 Comment: in front of the Anderlecht fans.\n37:55 Comment: Ramsey.\n37:56 Comment: Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n37:59 Comment: Going for goal and barring wide.\n38:1 Comment: Yeah, he's enjoying himself better now since he moved out on the left wing.\n38:4 Comment: Oxlade-Chamberlain confident enough to try from pretty far out,\n38:8 Comment: just didn't quite get the whip on the turn on it that he was looking for.\n38:11 Comment: But, scuffed the ground in truth.\n38:14 Comment: But this run earlier on, this was far better.\n38:18 Comment: You can see here, Van den Boer thinks he has it,\n38:20 Comment: but no, he just breezes past him.\n38:21 Comment: And this is where Welbeck makes the wrong decision.\n38:23 Comment: Had he stayed on the outside,\n38:25 Comment: I think he might have had a simple tap-in.\n38:41 Comment: Well, the items that are within Arsenal's control,\n38:44 Comment: and that is getting the three points here,\n38:46 Comment: going very much according to plan,\n38:48 Comment: that out with their control,\n38:50 Comment: and that is what's happening in the Westfalenstadion in Dortmund,\n38:53 Comment: also clicking into place.\n38:55 Comment: Marco Reus has given Dortmund the lead against Galatasaray.\n38:59 Comment: As it stands, Dortmund and Arsenal qualify tonight.\n39:3 Comment: And the remaining two games will be to see who comes out on top,\n39:8 Comment: particularly with Dortmund coming here next.\n39:10 Comment: That one, eh,\n39:11 Comment: is a real decider.\n39:17 Comment: It is if it stays like this, of course.\n39:29 Comment: Van den Boer.\n39:32 Comment: He's picked by Suriak.\n39:34 Comment: Here's Conte.\n39:38 Comment: Platt.\n39:41 Comment: He's picked by\n39:43 Comment: Van den Boer.\n39:43 Comment: Here he goes, here he goes, come on!\n39:45 Comment: Hachim Pong.\n39:49 Comment: Chesney can gather.\n39:51 Comment: Suriak was making a near-post run,\n39:53 Comment: but didn't arrive on the scene quite in time.\n39:55 Comment: The signs again that they can create things.\n39:59 Comment: Arteta dived in there and allowed that whole situation to develop.\n40:4 Comment: No offside flag here against Andy Welbeck.\n40:7 Comment: It's Welbeck!\n40:9 Comment: What a terrific control.\n40:11 Comment: Welbeck did ever so well to get it down and get himself a chance at goal.\n40:15 Comment: Lovely little flick past them.\n40:17 Comment: Two were operating so well together.\n40:19 Comment: But give him Bember credit here.\n40:21 Comment: Just as he gets against it, he's diving in and makes a critical challenge.\n40:26 Comment: Welbeck just makes his way towards goal, just about to hit the target,\n40:29 Comment: and Bember does really well.\n40:30 Comment: .\n40:43 Comment: And then Boer got his head on Arteta's,\n40:49 Comment: on Kozola's corner, I should say.\n41:3 Comment: Not so happy here, with his side at this particular point.\n41:6 Comment: It's before he came on the screen there.\n41:8 Comment: He was gesturing furiously.\n41:11 Comment: the big defender there for not\n41:12 Comment: controlling that ball and\n41:13 Comment: passing it.\n41:18 Comment: Chambers.\n41:29 Comment: Monreal.\n41:39 Comment: There's all that.\n41:47 Comment: From Alexis Sanchez which was\n41:49 Comment: read by contact.\n41:51 Comment: It's going to be a corner\n41:52 Comment: though.\n41:55 Comment: So bright isn't he looking for\n41:56 Comment: things.\n41:59 Comment: When he sees him he does things\n42:0 Comment: at a pace.\n42:1 Comment: The bull is our tether.\n42:3 Comment: He's calling him in the\n42:4 Comment: interview with Jeff Shrees\n42:5 Comment: before.\n42:7 Comment: More to.\n42:9

It's going to be an Arsenal freak.\n43:43 Comment: He also might have taken a knee into the base of the spine here\n43:45 Comment: as he turned.\n43:46 Comment: He's in a lot of pain there.\n43:48 Comment: That will be iced overnight.\n43:50 Comment: Just have a look here.\n43:52 Comment: He stretches there.\n43:54 Comment: Just at that point there he takes a real hard knock into the base\n43:56 Comment: of the spine.\n43:58 Comment: That's a sore one.\n44:2 Comment: It's been a stop start season, hasn't it, for Aaron Ramsey.\n44:8 Comment: Only just back from injury.\n44:11 Comment: Now he could do with a good run in the side to try and regain\n44:14 Comment: the consistency from last season, let alone the goals.\n44:18 Comment: As the lads have said in the studio beforehand, it's not all\n44:21 Comment: about goals.\n44:22 Comment: It's his link play, his work, and creating goals too.\n44:26 Comment: He's hard on himself.\n44:27 Comment: He keeps wanting more goals.\n44:29 Comment: Do you get the feeling with him he's not going to be able to\n44:32 Comment: do that?\n44:33 Comment: I think he's just going to force it a little bit at the moment\n44:35 Comment: to rediscover that form.\n44:36 Comment: Yes, I do.\n44:37 Comment: And there's no need really because he's a really important\n44:39 Comment: part of the team with all the other stuff he does.\n44:41 Comment: And they come, you know, to a player like him, they'll come\n44:44 Comment: maybe not so frequently as last year, but they'll come.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: the two goals in the space of four first half minutes doing the damage\n0:16 Comment: there's a lot of damage done down arsenal's right hand side and\n0:20 Comment: rather than put a striker on and try and get goals back out i think he just wanted to cut off a bit\n0:24 Comment: of the supply oxford chamberlain for a time did it on this right side he switched with cazorla and\n0:30 Comment: then he went back to the left side and then he went back to the right side and then he went back\n0:30 Comment: to the left side and then he went back to the right side and then he went back to the left side\n0:32 Comment: to plug the gap i think the young lad comes on\n0:40 Comment: tough test for him arsenal have their tails up\n0:43 Comment: and you'd expect them now to go on and enjoy this occasion and score more goals\n0:49 Comment: i'm sure the manager will hope and certainly steve bold will hope that it continues their run of\n0:54 Comment: clean sheets two in their last two games well they have had scares at the back\n1:0 Comment: should be able to keep the uh the door closed against an andalex side who have shown in\n1:5 Comment: flashes that they're capable of troubling arsenal they well have taken the lead before falling behind\n1:11 Comment: here sandy gazzola alexis sanchez he's taken his tally for arsenal goals to 11 and plays another\n1:23 Comment: wonderful pass into sandy gazzola danny welbeck just denied by the shuttle there's a slip there\n1:28 Comment: which may leave the door open and he's got the ball out of the net and he's got the ball out of the net\n1:29 Comment: for alexis sanchez\n1:33 Comment: and it's come to kieran gibbs who teased that off slate chamberlain\n1:38 Comment: action pong didn't know too much about that just flung his body at the ball it was enough\n1:43 Comment: for now anyway well so close there for arsenal you can see\n1:49 Comment: thanks as teammate for not being greedy and giving him the opportunity\n1:54 Comment: fullback somehow managed to block\n1:59 Comment: the net-kids well right now um\n2:14 Comment: what a treat\n2:28 Comment: so\n2:28 Comment: nice\n2:29 Comment: He's enjoying himself.\n2:31 Comment: Action Pomp pruning behind for an Arsenal corner.\n2:33 Comment: Yeah, did really well. Just lost the sub, Kaweah, so easily there.\n2:37 Comment: Action Pomp had to be really alert.\n2:59 Comment: Nobomata separate, the near post, the shafts.\n3:1 Comment: And Scholes runs all the way through to Nahar.\n3:5 Comment: Now Prats.\n3:7 Comment: Looking for Van den Boer, and Welbeck is back.\n3:9 Comment: The crowd appreciated that.\n3:11 Comment: Danny Welbeck running back 60 yards after that corner kick.\n3:14 Comment: Wins possession back for his teammates.\n3:16 Comment: And it's funny, we see Sanchez do things like that.\n3:19 Comment: It is rubbing off on this Arsenal team.\n3:21 Comment: They're all working so hard for each other.\n3:23 Comment: Some really good things happening on the clean sheet.\n3:27 Comment: Would crown it for them a bit, but it's not.\n3:29 Comment: They're going to be a bit of a challenge tonight.\n3:52 Comment: Sanchez.\n3:54 Comment: Ramsey.\n3:56 Comment: Mertesacker.\n3:59 Comment: Substitute Kaweah seeing a lot of traffic go down his side.\n4:2 Comment: A toe in that.\n4:4 Comment: This is Action Pomp.\n4:27 Comment: Ready for Arsenal to rush it.\n4:28 Comment: But they know another goal would close the door firmly on any Anderlecht hopes of a comeback.\n4:35 Comment: Such as they are.\n4:37 Comment: Alexis Sanchez connecting on his chest.\n4:40 Comment: Van den Boer across.\n4:42 Comment: This is Action Pomp.\n4:44 Comment: Terrific ball into him, wasn't it?\n4:46 Comment: Cazorla.\n4:47 Comment: Who played it, got it on his chest, but just one defender, too many around him.\n4:51 Comment: Such a potent try.\n4:53 Comment: Didn't look to be anything on there.\n4:55 Comment: Sanchez made his run and won the game.\n4:57 Comment: Once he was found, he caused all sorts of problems.\n5:2 Comment: There's a player coursing with confidence, coursing with quality at the moment.\n5:6 Comment: And making a real difference to Arsenal every time he's on the pitch.\n5:10 Comment: Watch that.\n5:11 Comment: Sublime, wasn't it?\n5:19 Comment: It sure was.\n5:20 Comment: Checkman overplayed that one.\n5:22 Comment: His chance earlier on, you can see, it looked as if everything had snuffed out.\n5:25 Comment: But...\n5:26 Comment: Christan falls over.\n5:28 Comment: And at this moment, as it plays itself in goal, it's a lovely pull back to him.\n5:34 Comment: And with his head turned, just diving in there, Action Pomp somehow...\n5:38 Comment: Keeps Oxlade-Chamberlain from adding to that one goal.\n5:41 Comment: He had no idea, but give him credit.\n5:44 Comment: He made a vital block.\n5:49 Comment: Cameron Gibbs, who took a wonderfully taken goal, didn't he, to equalise in Belgium.\n5:56 Comment: He's pulled back to pull back.\n5:58 Comment: Chambers to Gibbs, his first Champions League goal.\n6:0 Comment: This is a concern, meantime, for Anderlecht.\n6:3 Comment: They're short in the centre-half department.\n6:5 Comment: Olivier Deschacts, who's playing alongside the stricken Chancel and Bemba,\n6:9 Comment: is a left-back filling in with the harder defence.\n6:13 Comment: And despite giving away the penalty, and Bemba's probably their best defender in there.\n6:19 Comment: He's broken up one or two of the Arsenal attacks quite well.\n6:22 Comment: He's quick.\n6:24 Comment: He's definitely quicker...\n6:25 Comment: than his partner, Deschacts.\n6:27 Comment: And, yeah, it will be a worry if he can't play on.\n6:32 Comment: Does Anderlecht contemplate this?\n6:34 Comment: I wonder, does Arsene Wenger contemplate giving Theo Walcott a bit of game time?\n6:43 Comment: Well, he played an hour, Theo Walcott, for the under-21s.\n6:46 Comment: He got a good few minutes under his belt against Burnley at the weekend.\n6:51 Comment: Still 38 minutes to play here.\n6:53 Comment: You'd suspect that the next step is to get a good half-hour of action.\n6:58 Comment: Yeah, he did about 10 minutes at the weekend.\n7:0 Comment: Excited everybody.\n7:1 Comment: All that pace was still there.\n7:4 Comment: What an addition he'll be...\n7:7 Comment: to Arsenal's season.\n7:12 Comment: Well, it's not just tonight, but it's over the Grand Prix,\n7:15 Comment: that this is troublesome for Besnick Hasse, the Anderlecht coach.\n7:20 Comment: Bram Nighting, who is really the number one centre-half for the club,\n7:25 Comment: is out with a troublesome toe injury\n7:28 Comment: that was hardly seen in play since early September.\n7:31 Comment: Fabrice Nsikala, another of his go-to defenders,\n7:36 Comment: also out injured, hasn't really played for six weeks.\n7:39 Comment: And one thing you always want to know,\n7:42 Comment: when you're playing for the club,\n7:44 Comment: is that you're not always going to be playing for the club.\n7:47 Comment: And that's not the case.\n7:48 Comment: That's not the case.\n7:49 Comment: And one thing you note about the Anderlecht bench is the youth.\n7:53 Comment: One player, 22, the oldest, all the others 20 or under.\n7:58 Comment: 19-year-old Leander Dengonka, who came on late on\n8:3 Comment: in the previous meeting of Fortnite,\n8:5 Comment: who is going to come on here.\n8:17 Comment: The substitution is made.\n8:19 Comment: The Belgian is temporarily down to 10.\n8:28 Comment: Tiestan is filling in at centre-half for now\n8:31 Comment: until they can get on Leander Dengonka.\n8:40 Comment: It's a real test now for Anderlecht,\n8:42 Comment: all these young players.\n8:44 Comment: Whatever happens, they'll learn from this and they'll come on.\n8:47 Comment: But...\n8:48 Comment: Can they organise themselves to keep Arsenal shut out?\n8:52 Comment: They've got good spirit, good energy.\n8:54 Comment: Great to see so much youth on the pitch for them.\n8:57 Comment: You can't help feeling this is a golden opportunity\n8:59 Comment: for one or two of the Arsenal players, the likes of Welbeck.\n9:5 Comment: Ramsey.\n9:6 Comment: There should be chances for the rest of this game.\n9:10 Comment: Now playing against Arsenal with your full-strength defence,\n9:13 Comment: even though you are Belgian champions,\n9:16 Comment: here at the Emirates is one thing.\n9:17 Comment: Playing against them with a midfielder at centre-half\n9:20 Comment: and a left-back alongside him, quite another.\n9:30 Comment: Ramsey.\n9:32 Comment: Now Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n9:34 Comment: Looking for Welbeck.\n9:37 Comment: Ander Schaap did enough to stop him getting any power on the header.\n9:40 Comment: Yeah, I think he might have jumped a little early, you know.\n9:42 Comment: I think if he backed off a yard before he decided to make his jump,\n9:45 Comment: I think he might have had an easier chance.\n9:46 Comment: You can see he jumps.\n9:47 Comment: Instead of going back another yard, he stops and jumps, Danny.\n9:52 Comment: Lovely play from Arsenal.\n9:54 Comment: Just a delightful little ball from Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n9:57 Comment: He's just up a bit early.\n9:58 Comment: I think had he backed off, he might have had an easier opportunity.\n10:5 Comment: Borussia Dortmund's centre-half.\n10:7 Comment: Socrates Papastathopoulos has doubled Dortmund's lead\n10:10 Comment: at home to Galatasaray.\n10:12 Comment: So both the top two in this group have a two-goal cushion.\n10:15 Comment: And both are going through to the knockout phase as it stands.\n10:30 Comment: Groups, of course, go to a head-to-head record.\n10:32 Comment: Arsenal beaten in Dortmund by two goals to nil in the opening matchday.\n10:38 Comment: The number of goals, if they can beat Dortmund here,\n10:41 Comment: will be highly significant.\n10:43 Comment: Arsene Wenger, who's been a great player,\n10:45 Comment: to the Jashrees before the match.\n10:47 Comment: It was about getting through.\n10:48 Comment: Then they can contemplate winning the group\n10:50 Comment: and trying to avoid the big guns.\n10:53 Comment: Terrific play from Arsenal there, winning the ball back.\n10:57 Comment: Wrong decision there from Ramsey.\n10:58 Comment: But Sanchez started it off.\n10:59 Comment: Even though he wasn't the one who won it,\n11:1 Comment: he smiles at his teammate.\n11:4 Comment: But his constant hounding there,\n11:6 Comment: as Amelie looked to have good possession,\n11:8 Comment: teed it up nicely for Ramsey to benefit\n11:11 Comment: and nip in and get the ball back.\n11:13 Comment: And it's not...\n11:15 Comment: That often you say about an Arsenal team,\n11:17 Comment: hunting and packs and being so good off the ball,\n11:20 Comment: but that's what Sanchez also brings to this team.\n11:23 Comment: Those around them, they respond.\n11:40 Comment: We compare it to the last campaign,\n11:42 Comment: this one for Arsenal in the Champions League,\n11:43 Comment: and all the ones we've seen.\n11:44 Comment: And it's a good thing that they've been\n11:46 Comment: in the Champions League all the way to the final kick in Naples\n11:48 Comment: before they were assured of going through 12 points.\n11:52 Comment: Napoli getting 12 points and going out.\n11:54 Comment: Dortmund going through as group winners.\n11:59 Comment: They need that annual acquaintance with Arsenal.\n12:6 Comment: It's shaping up.\n12:7 Comment: It'll be the bottom two.\n12:8 Comment: And the left-hand Galatasaray playing for the Europa League.\n12:14 Comment: Ramsey is brought by Van den Boer.\n12:28 Comment: Fiesta.\n12:30 Comment: Alexis Sanchez has won it back now.\n12:32 Comment: Here comes Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n12:35 Comment: Oh, what a goal!\n12:39 Comment: Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is back in European business.\n12:42 Comment: And Arsenal are back.\n12:44 Comment: They are in cruise control.\n12:47 Comment: And he deserves it.\n12:48 Comment: He's been excellent all night.\n12:50 Comment: The pace he shows here to avail of, once again,\n12:53 Comment: Sanchez's defensive reaction to them losing the ball.\n12:57 Comment: Look, he wants it back so hard.\n12:59 Comment: He digs deep, gets a touch.\n13:1 Comment: Might be fortunate there wasn't a foul given.\n13:3 Comment: But at this point, there's so much more to do.\n13:5 Comment: Van den Boer, he simply ghost-passed him.\n13:7 Comment: And as Deschacq comes across,\n13:9 Comment: it's just a wonderfully guided pass into the far corner.\n13:12 Comment: Just watch this.\n13:13 Comment: He just ghost-passed Van den Boer.\n13:15 Comment: And at this point, looks up, and just before the challenge comes in,\n13:18 Comment: it's tucked in beautifully.\n13:22 Comment: Terrific for Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n13:25 Comment: He's a man in form.\n13:26 Comment: He's enjoyed every minute of this match tonight.\n13:29 Comment: Knew exactly what he was going to do.\n13:31 Comment: Goalkeeper, no chance.\n13:36 Comment: Old smiles for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Arsenal.\n13:41 Comment: Yeah, and he hugs it in.\n13:43 Comment: He's got his team-mate there,\n13:44 Comment: because his tenacity to win the ball might set that up for him.\n13:50 Comment: Someone should tell him they're 3-0 up.\n14:2 Comment: And Haas' persistence is rewarded.\n14:5 Comment: Pratt trying the back heel.\n14:7 Comment: And he finds it, Callum Chambers.\n14:9 Comment: Cazorla.\n14:11 Comment: Oxlade-Chamberlain.\n14:13 Comment: Alexis Sanchez.\n14:17 Comment: He'll keep it in.\n14:18 Comment: And run it then, Duncan.\n14:24 Comment: Ramsey.\n14:25 Comment: A silver ball run away from him into the glove.\n14:27 Comment: So Silvio Proto.\n14:29 Comment: Yeah, very nearly fell for Aaron Ramsey.\n14:31 Comment: Just on this side again.\n14:33 Comment: Oxlade-Chamberlain, he's given Van den Boer a thorough time\n14:35 Comment: since he moved back to the left.\n14:37 Comment: Goal!\n14:50 Comment: Looking at the side here,\n14:51 Comment: Arteta is making gestures to the bench.\n14:54 Comment: I think he's feeling a bit of a strain\n14:56 Comment: on the back of his left leg.\n14:59 Comment: He's already signalled a couple of times\n15:1 Comment: that he wants to come off.\n15:2 Comment: Maybe that's why Arsene was so upset looking.\n15:5 Comment: Van den Boer.\n15:6 Comment: Going through to Siriac.\n15:9 Comment: Match in port, and touch in, Van den Boer.\n15:17 Comment: Van de Ligt have a goal, Arsenal lose their clean sheet.\n15:22 Comment: Yeah, and they'll have to make a change here now below me as well,\n15:25 Comment: and Van den Boer, who defensively has been all at sea tonight,\n15:28 Comment: he kept up the pace with the move, he stayed up rather than run back,\n15:32 Comment: had a feeling his teammate was going to get the better of the Arsenal defender.\n15:37 Comment: He is offside, if you ask me.\n15:40 Comment: We'll see a far clearer position now at this point, yeah.\n15:43 Comment: I think he might be just offside.\n15:47 Comment: But it's a blow to Arsenal, the clean sheet they so desperately craved isn't theirs.\n15:52 Comment: Van den Boer relieved that the linesman hasn't flanked.\n15:57 Comment: And besides that goal, there's some substitutions happening on both sides.\n16:4 Comment: It's an injury in force one for Arsenal.\n16:7 Comment: It's a goal for Mikel Arteta.\n16:11 Comment: His stop-start season takes another turn towards the red light\n16:15 Comment: as Mathieu Flamini comes on and replaces him.\n16:19 Comment: A couple of clouds on the horizon for Arsenal in terms of back goal conceded\n16:23 Comment: and another injury collected.\n16:28 Comment: Yeah, and Anderlecht now bringing Mitrovic on.\n16:30 Comment: He's an out-and-out goalscorer, a young lad too,\n16:32 Comment: but he scored nine this season, so they'll be having a right goal now that they've got one back.\n16:37 Comment: He's been playing well, he's got a good game,\n16:39 Comment: and now he's on to you, Jürgen.\n16:41 Comment: Straight away, him and Matusak will come together.\n16:47 Comment: He's a feisty young player, only 20 years old.\n16:50 Comment: The Serbian.\n16:52 Comment: Most of those goals you were talking about now coming in the opening weeks of the season.\n16:55 Comment: He's had a bit of criticism recently from the coach.\n16:58 Comment: He's been left out of the side for a lack of application for being a little overweight.\n17:5 Comment: You'll just see a little bit of afters here.\n17:6 Comment: the second knocks it forward he's followed through and into I don't think\n17:11 Comment: it was that much of intention there from the center forward but he's just let\n17:16 Comment: America second oh he's not gonna back off the rest of the game\n17:22 Comment: it's terrific play again from Sanchez I mean everyone simply saying it every\n17:25 Comment: time he picks the ball up didn't look favor to be winning that taking it down\n17:31 Comment: and spreading across field passes tremendous things tonight\n17:36 Comment: that's where you look at Alexis Sanchez every time he gets the ball but he is a\n17:40 Comment: class of the way he's playing at the moment\n17:49 Comment: we also guys\n17:52 Comment: he was at the heart of the build-up\n17:56

Chamberlain's third before rifling home a quality second\n18:13 Comment: it's not to mention hitting the post and some sublime touches in between\n18:24 Comment: there's more evidence again just looking forward to closing into the corner here\n18:27 Comment: forcing the ball to be cleared\n18:30 Comment: the ball to be cleared\n18:32 Comment: and the ball to be cleared\n18:42 Comment: the 18 year old debutant\n18:46 Comment: to Pratt\n18:49 Comment: Mertesacker at full stretch and the left corner\n18:54 Comment: while having a go here the young Belgian side\n18:58 Comment: yes Mertesacker had to be really alert here\n19:0 Comment: Mertesacker had to be really alert here\n19:0 Comment: It's well worked between and he's trying to find that space between the goalkeeper in the center half for Mitovic to come into.\n19:7 Comment: Just some questions being asked now of Arsenal.\n19:24 Comment: He's a little happier now, isn't he?\n19:27 Comment: Side have got that goal, they've changed the formation, they'll have two up front now.\n19:30 Comment: Pratt will go up and join Mitovic.\n19:34 Comment: Sensing that his team have a little bit more left in them.\n19:43 Comment: Just over 25 minutes left to play, they've got time.\n19:48 Comment: Whether they can keep Arsenal out at the other end, well that's another matter.\n19:56 Comment: Fans are making a real racket here in the far corner.\n20:0 Comment: So...\n20:0 Comment: They're starting to try and drum a bit of belief into their team.\n20:22 Comment: Another sack up.\n20:24 Comment: A little bit of indecision.\n20:25 Comment: Pratt the beneficiary.\n20:28 Comment: Kawhi up.\n20:30 Comment: Quickie feed at Champagne.\n20:33 Comment: And it's behind by Flamini for a corner.\n20:35 Comment: Very important challenge again, this time from Flamini.\n20:39 Comment: Great switch from Pratt.\n20:40 Comment: They work it again, very similar to the last time.\n20:43 Comment: And as the ball comes across, Mitovic thinks he's in for a tap-in.\n20:47 Comment: His manager thought they were going to get a tap-in as well.\n20:51 Comment: Flamini does excellent.\n20:55 Comment: He's hit some wonderful corners in the 17-year-old Tielemans.\n20:58 Comment: But the last couple have been disappointing.\n21:0 Comment: When they've been looking to get a bit of momentum.\n21:3 Comment: Mitovic getting a clatter there from Oje Chesnik.\n21:7 Comment: Yeah, too easy for the goalkeeper.\n21:10 Comment: Mitovic rather acrobatically trying to get him the end of it.\n21:26 Comment: And Bonka.\n21:30 Comment: But Mitovic's got a big head.\n21:32 Comment: And he's got the ball.\n21:33 Comment: Mitovic's got the ball.\n21:34 Comment: And he's got the ball.\n21:38 Comment: And the possession starts to tell you that overall Arsenal are in control.\n21:43 Comment: Second half.\n21:43 Comment: A little bit more joy for Anderlecht.\n21:48 Comment: And the goal, of course, means a lot more joy to them.\n21:55 Comment: 3-0, I said Arsenal were in cruise control.\n21:57 Comment: You couldn't really see a way that Anderlecht would get back into it.\n22:0 Comment: Yes.\n22:0 Comment: they've lost a sender half

    "summary": "Arsenal played host to Anderlecht in a thrilling encounter that ended in a 3-3 draw, a match that greatly tested the emotions and resolve of everyone involved. The game was electric from the onset, charged with the historical context of a two-goal deficit comeback that Arsenal managed in 1970 against Anderlecht. The anticipation in the air was palpable, and the expectations were high for both teams to put forth an exhilarating contest.\n\nFrom the kick-off, it was clear that Arsenal's forward players were in good form, having come off two strong Premier League victories. The fans expected the trend to continue, given the wealth of attacking talent available to Arsene Wenger, particularly with Alexis Sanchez and Danny Welbeck showing excellent chemistry upfront.\n\nThe first significant mentioning goes to Monreal starting his fifth game in a row at center-half, deputizing for the injured Laurent Koscielny. Arsenal's defensive lineup also included Chambers, who made an early push down the right, linking up efficiently with Oxlade-Chamberlain and creating the first few ripples in Anderlecht's steadier waters.\n\nChances began to sprinkle intermittently with Ramsey finding his groove early on, linking play and pushing the ball into attacking spaces. A few defensive hiccups by Anderlecht, as well as crucial interceptions by their defense, kept the scoreline at nil-nil for the first quarter-hour despite some promising moves by Arsenal. Anderlecht's resilience during this period showed that they came to play and were not going to be mere spectators.\n\nAn early tangle in the box saw Mertesacker thwart an advancing attack with a crucial tackle, showing signs that Arsenal's defense, though rigged with makeshift arrangements, could handle the pressure. The game's first significant incident came from an aggressive advancement by Sanchez, only to be met by quick defensive organization by the Belgians.\n\nWith both sides probing for an opportunity, Anderlecht adopted a patient build-up style, trying to find a gap through Arsenal’s setup. Young talents like Tielemans and more experienced players like Vandenbora weaved neat passes attempting to press Arsenal's defensive line. Anderlecht's organized pressing from their backline saw many Arsenal attacks thwarted, and clearances made methodically.\n\nAs the minutes ticked, Arsenal began to wrestle back control, visibly imposing their rhythm on the game. Cazorla's technical wizardry was evident early on as he orchestrated several plays, laying the ball with pin-point crosses, which made the Anderlecht defenders scramble. A pivotal moment came when Nahar, the scorer from their previous clash, almost found the net again but fired wide under pressure from Mertesacker.\n\nSanchez’s relentless drive down the wings started to put Anderlecht on the back foot frequently, pushing them into deeper defensive formations. Every minute seemed to amplify the urgency on both sides as several chances went begging, the game stayed nail-bitely level.\n\nThe breakthrough came shortly as Chambers floated a perfect cross after a few intricate passes from Ramsey, allowing Welbeck a chance to pounce. However, mbemba's fantastic interception saw potential Arsenal advantages minimized. The brilliance and reactional defense by Anderlecht were in full display keeping Arsenal from capitalizing during these initial exchanges.\n\nThen, a sublime link-up play between Alexis Sanchez and Welbeck saw the latter nudged unfairly in the box, resulting in a penalty. Mikel Arteta stepped up to convert, calmly chipping it past the goalie, marking his 50th goal in English football. Arsenal had the lead, 1-0.\n\nThe confidence soared from here; Arsenal played with a zing that forced Anderlecht into errors. This dominance paid off swiftly when, after a deflected shot rebounded, Sanchez smashed an unstoppable volley that increased the gap to 2-0. The Emirates roared with approval.\n\nAs the half progressed, Arsenal looked to seal the game, and Oxlade-Chamberlain’s wonderful solo run, breezing past Vandenbora, slid a calculated strike into the far corner making it 3-0. It was apparent that Arsenal's rigorous pressing game was paying off as they continuously harried Anderlecht’s defense, disrupting their build-ups and generating opportunities.\n\nHowever, Anderlecht was far from being outclassed. In what felt like a sudden twist, an energized Anderlecht launched successive attacks. A lapse in Arsenal's defense saw Vandenbora capitalizing this time, pulling one back for the Belgians at the hem of a nicely threaded through ball, surprising Chesney. 3-1.\n\nAnother blow to Arsenal came when Arteta signaled for a substitution due to an injury, further unsettling the London club's core. To bolster, Flamini came in, but the sudden shift in momentum lingered.\n\nAnderlecht smelled vulnerability and kept pressing. Mitrovic, having come in as a substitute, made his presence felt almost immediately. He brought physicality that seemed to unnerve Arsenal's makeshift defense. Mitrovic, in a bold display, managed to win a penalty from a clumsy challenge, cooly slotted by Vandenbora to now make it a nervy 3-2.\n\nThe dynamic staging at Emirates now had fans at the edge of their seats, and as clouds loomed, reality sank for Arsenal’s complacency since the two-goal gap had been closed. Anderlecht, now playing with boosted morale, continued to besiege Arsenal’s half with frequent breaks.\n\nMitrovic became Anderlecht’s talisman drawing ever closer towards exploiting the tiring Arsenal's backline. His relentless push saw a diving header into the net, remarkably leveling things 3-3, a massive blow and dramatic turn of events, proving his shift influential.\n\nDespite last-ditch efforts to regain the lead, Arsenal struggled to consolidate their grip. Sanchez and Podolski orchestrated a few half-chances, but the stalwart defence of Anderlecht was just impenetrable by now. The final whistle confirmed a 3-3 stalemate leaving the Arsenal faithful in shock, reflecting on a night where victory seemed secure at intervals but eventually fizzled into what they might reflect on as lost points. \n\nArsenal would ponder this night significantly, given that managing a promising start to unravel by letting a composed Anderlecht side capitalize on defensive lapses, still shadows their otherwise stellar display of tactical and technical grandeur upfront. A game that enkindles why football remains untamed - full of passionate shifts and structural learnings."
