normal, but what is normal in football?\n11:35 Comment: For example, not the Boateng,\n11:37 Comment: who is so stable makes such a mistake.\n11:41 Comment: And then Neuer was busy again.\n11:49 Comment: Piazza.\n11:55 Comment: At least that should remind the Bayern defence once again,\n12:3 Comment: that the defenders are also and not only in the forward movement towards Dynamo's goal.\n12:19 Comment: Technically, this is quite impressive.\n12:21 Comment: Costa.\n12:30 Comment: He is good.\n12:33 Comment: Götze too careless in receiving the ball.\n12:38 Comment: Not that I have to correct everything right now.\n12:40 Comment: Bernat hits the ball and therefore we rightly let the game continue.\n12:48 Comment: Costa.\n12:50 Comment: Kosta, short corner.\n12:52 Comment: 1 to 0.\n12:54 Comment: Let’s stay with the question: what is normal in football?\n13:12 Comment: So it's normal that this is an impossible angle.\n13:15 Comment: It is normal that a defender like Martel cannot let himself get out of the way like that.\n13:19 Comment: Here Bernat hits the ball and then Zudani.\n13:21 Comment: In that respect, that is something that can be argued for.\n13:23 Comment: And Costa.\n13:24 Comment: So now Martel is watching him.\n13:29 Comment: And the corner belongs to Eduardo, of course.\n13:31 Comment: So, that is not untenable.\n13:33 Comment: This is very nicely done.\n13:34 Comment: This is done very confidently.\n13:37 Comment: It is not untenable.\n13:38 Comment: It doesn't matter anyway.\n13:39 Comment: Bayern are leading 1-0.\n13:44 Comment: And

staying halfway safe.\n14:38 Comment: First Dynamo duty at home.\n14:42 Comment: Anything under four goals doesn't count.\n14:53 Comment: Bayern attack very early, moving out wide.\n15:9 Comment: And Manuel Neuer can throw the ball as precisely as we have just seen.\n15:13 Comment: Except for Boateng's little wobble.\n15:17 Comment: Bayern are doing this for Dynamo in a shockingly humorless and serious way.\n15:23 Comment: Or the other way around, Bayern are enjoying their own game.\n15:32 Comment: This can be clearly seen.\n15:40 Comment: Kimmich, Goetze, Coman.\n15:46 Comment: This all happens so quickly.\n15:53 Comment: 3-0.\n15:53 Comment: 3-0 the corner.\n16:12 Comment: And that is not, as we always have to say, patiently playing around the Dynamo penalty area,\n16:19 Comment: but that is with a lot of pull towards the goal.\n16:22 Comment: Alaba.\n16:23 Comment: Philipp Lahm.\n16:31 Comment: Coman.\n16:40 Comment: Caravel.\n16:48 Comment: Now Alaba is making things a bit more exciting.\n16:53 Comment: During this time he tested 3 Uni-N positive geochemicals.\n16:57 Comment: Our FC Aad not this time.\n17:1 Comment: One must be happy with the thought, the A faux.\n17:4

Kimmich.\n22:41 Comment: Idol.\n22:44 Comment: But the Bavarians are really making this their business model.\n22:48 Comment: Götze loses the ball quite carelessly.\n22:50 Comment: Boateng commits a foul.\n22:52 Comment: Receives the yellow card.\n22:53 Comment: And almost immediately the score is 2-0.\n23:2 Comment: And as the boss, I think he's probably starting to think about it now.\n23:10 Comment: Half of the first half is over.\n23:11 Comment: It's 2 to 0.\n23:12 Comment: If you try something, you move back.\n23:16 Comment: Or do you say, come on, let's make this as painless as

There is no order at all on the outside anymore.\n24:18 Comment: Götze together with Coman.\n24:22 Comment: Yes, the shot is from 10 meters.\n24:24 Comment: And yet it looks like...\n24:28 Comment: He

although he wasn't forced to demonstrate his full abilities here.\n26:8 Comment: It's all very, very easy.\n26:14 Comment: Actually, they have a basic formation of four or five men.\n26:21 Comment: Five-man defense if Bayern come in right.\n26:24 Comment: Before that, three again.\n26:27 Comment: And actually they are close to each other.\n26:29 Comment: But Bayern keep getting between these chains and into these spaces.\n26:35 Comment: And then there is immediate panic.\n26:44 Comment: And the Bavarians are not willing to leave anything behind here.\n26:51 Comment: The ball wasn't in by Lewandowski.\n26:53 Comment: He is sure.\n26:55 Comment: And now it’s up to who decides.\n26:58 Comment: Yes, the goal judge.\n26:59 Comment: I mean, who is more beautiful.\n27:1 Comment: Why else is he standing back there?\n27:3 Comment: There you see, that's a fourth.\n27:5 Comment: Was, I think, the means of communication.\n27:9 Comment: A little bit about the speaking equipment.\n27:12

of a team, okay,\n27:38 Comment: who have remained unbeaten 45 times at home and in play.\n27:42 Comment: Does what she wants.\n27:43 Comment: Too strong at home, too weak away.\n27:49 Comment: 28 minutes.\n27:52 Comment: Lewandowski scores his next goal.\n27:56 Comment: I'm not going to count anymore, but we'll just put a line under it at the end.\n28:0 Comment: Let’s see what the Pole is up

problems.\n29:2 Comment: Alaba again.\n29:3 Comment: Dynamo's players, as you can see from their faces and their posture, are well served.\n29:20 Comment: Nobody wants to be made a fool of, so if you really go for it, you don't do it on the player with the ball with five men.\n29:33 Comment: Idol.\n29:42 Comment: Kimmich.\n29:44 Comment: Coman.\n29:50 Comment: Thiago, Isco, Isco.\n29:56 Comment: Idol.\n30:3 Comment: Then withdrew.\n30:7 Comment: I think it wasn't really that bad.\n30:11 Comment: But what they defend in the middle, Ademi and the young Benkovic, is quite adventurous.\n30:19 Comment: They duck their heads and jump up against each other.\n30:33 Comment: So, half an hour is over. Bayern are leading 4-0.\n30:40 Comment: It is, and this must be mentioned, quite impressive how seriously they take a game like this right from the start.\n30:50 Comment: And the other way around, Dynamo Zagreb is hopelessly overwhelmed at this level.\n30:59 Comment: Lewandowski.\n31:1 Comment: The Belarusian referee.\n31:3 Comment: Kupakow lets things run as best he can.\n31:7 Comment: It's also a fair game.\n31:8 Comment: And I hope it stays that way and that frustration doesn't break out among the Croatians.\n31:14 Comment: Boateng.\n31:20 Comment: Costa offside.\n31:22 Comment:

Outstanding like Costa.\n33:1 Comment: Well, apart from his dribbling and his crossing.\n33:5 Comment: It's outstanding how he keeps changing sides.\n33:8 Comment: And how he does it.\n33:10 Comment: How precise.\n33:13 Comment: Zudani.\n33:17 Comment: Kimmich.\n33:19 Comment: Applause from Guardiola Jung.\n33:27 Comment: Idol.\n33:28 Comment: Costas.\n33:31 Comment: Idol.\n33:39 Comment:

the Supercup after the meta-skewed match against Wolfsburg.\n34:31 Comment: Kulbakov, the referee, is doing a great job.\n34:33 Comment: See if there is an advantage.\n34:35 Comment: Now no one will.\n34:37 Comment: Then he won't whistle too early.\n34:39 Comment: Everything in a friendly manner.\n34:44 Comment: Because now Benkovic is coming out.\n34:51 Comment: It wasn't an offside foul.\n34:55 Comment: Well, OK.\n34:56 Comment: So I have to take all the praise back for Kulbakov.\n35:3 Comment: Benkovic was clearly the winner.\n35:6 Comment: Set up the check.\n35:10 Comment: And then Lewandowski went for the ball.\n35:12 Comment: But of course the foul happened before.\n35:14 Comment: Okay, so I claim that this scene will not decide this game either.\n35:22 Comment: Zudani.\n35:25 Comment: Machado.\n35:25 Comment: Oh.\n35:25 Comment: Then there are three men there.\n35:27 Comment: Thiago too.\n35:29 Comment: And Götze.\n35:29 Comment: Show exclamations.\n35:31

I tried that.\n36:13 Comment: Now 0-4 helps and it's making me look like mincemeat.\n36:19 Comment: Yes, all four goals.\n36:21 Comment: Costas, 13.\n36:25 Comment: Lewandowski.\n36:25 Comment:

    "summary": "On a crisp evening at the Allianz Arena, Bayern Munich clashed with Dynamo Zagreb in what turned out to be a dazzling display of athleticism and tactical prowess. The match ended in an emphatic 5-0 victory for the home side, which saw a blend of individual brilliance and cohesive team play that simply overwhelmed their Croatian counterparts.\n\nFrom the first whistle, Bayern Munich took control of the match with their characteristic high-pressing game and relentless attacking spirit. Dynamo Zagreb, traditionally strong on home turf but often struggling away, faced an uphill battle against the German giants. Bayern’s disciplined approach to the game was evident right from the initial moments, as they structured themselves with a formidable four, five, or even six-man defensive line when necessary, displaying the tactical versatility embedded by their manager.\n\nThe early stages of the match witnessed Bayern exploring the right-wing, orchestrated by the intelligent play of Joshua Kimmich. Kimmich’s keen eye for creating space and delivering pinpoint passes put Dynamo on the back foot almost immediately. His interplay with Thiago Alcantara and Douglas Costa on the wings added layers to Bayern’s offense. Costa, renowned for his agility and dribbling skills, was particularly involved in the thick of the action, keeping the Croatian defense constantly guessing.\n\nWithin just two minutes, the referee had already awarded a corner to Bayern, signaling their intent early on. Bayern Munich’s attacking efforts soon bore fruit as they registered their first shot on target. Thiago’s clever play, coupled with Costa’s ability to deliver quick crosses, was a testament to their tactical homework. Dynamo Zagreb struggled to contend with Bayern’s fluidity on the ball and were further hindered by defensive lapses, exemplified by various mistimed challenges and clearances.\n\nThe match's first goal came from Costa, whose technical skill and precise execution were on full display. With an assist from Bernat, Costa slid the ball past the Dynamo goalkeeper from what seemed like an impossible angle, setting the tone for the rest of the match. This goal was the result of Bayern’s incessant pressure and the coordination between the midfield and forward lines.\n\nDynamo Zagreb, despite being seasoned campaigners in the Croatian league, looked increasingly fragile against Bayern’s incessant attacks. Their captain, Antolic, was often overwhelmed by the quick transitions Bayern executed from defense to attack, struggling to contain the likes of Kimmich and Costa. Even their brief forays into Bayern’s half were quickly nullified by a rock-solid Bayern defense anchored by Jerome Boateng and David Alaba.\n\nThe Croatian team, although spirited, could not muster a consolidated offensive move that posed any real threat to Manuel Neuer’s goal. Bayern's second goal came soon after, further cementing their domination. Lewandowski, ever the prolific striker, made the most of a defensive error by Benkovic, one of Dynamo’s younger players. This goal showcased Lewandowski’s predatory instincts and Thiago’s creative prowess.\n\nThe realization that Bayern were playing at their own leisurely pace while maintaining a high level of efficiency began to sink in for Dynamo Zagreb. Guardiola’s side skillfully manipulated the tempo of the game, slowing it down or accelerating as they saw fit, often leaving Dynamo chasing shadows.\n\nThe third goal was a product of Bayern’s teamwork and quick passing. The young Kimmich was involved once again, this time linking up with Coman and Götze to breach Dynamo’s defense. It was a clear indication of Bayern’s attacking depth and versatility, with multiple players capable of stepping up and contributing to the scoreline.\n\nAs the half-time whistle approached, Bayern were in complete control. They had not only controlled possession but had also reduced Dynamo Zagreb to defensive spectators. The fourth goal before the break was another demonstration of Lewandowski’s finishing skills as he latched onto a through ball and made no mistake in finding the back of the net. The goal itself was a clear byproduct of Bayern’s high pressing game and ability to create turnovers in dangerous areas.\n\nThe halftime ended with a thunderous applause from the home crowd, not just for the scoreline but the sheer dominance exhibited by their team. Dynamo Zagreb, on the other hand, seemed shell-shocked and struggled to regroup.\n\nThe second half started with a hint of Dynamo’s improved resolve, but it was quickly snuffed out by Bayern’s structured play. Kimmich and Co. resumed their commanding performance shortly after the restart, firing a statement of intent towards any aspirations the Croatian side might have harbored. German efficiency and precision continued to dictate the tempo of the game.\n\nFurther adding to Dynamo's woes, Costa's relentless runs and constant positional exchanges with Thiago kept the visitors perpetually on the back foot. At one point, a tactical foul by Boateng led to a free kick, showcasing the occasional lapses in an otherwise flawless Bayern performance. Junior Fernandes of Dynamo Zagreb, one of their bright prospects, failed to capitalize on what were minimal chances created.\n\nAround the hour mark, Rafinha came in to replace Boateng, transitioning smoothly into the center-back role. The change did little to disrupt Bayern’s rhythm as they continued their relentless pursuit of goals. Götze, having previously been stationed on the flanks, drifted centrally and linked up play effectively. His positional versatility proved to be an asset, as seen in Bayern's progression up the field.\n\nBayern’s tactical superiority was once again in the spotlight when a slick movement down the right culminated in a goal for Müller. This was Bayern’s fifth and final goal of the night, a fitting testament to their clinical finishing. Despite the relentless attacking, Bayern maintained a disciplined defense, with Neuer required to make only a few saves throughout the match.\n\nDynamo Zagreb’s occasional attacking exploits never translated into legitimate scoring opportunities, largely due to the overwhelming presence of Bayern’s defense and midfield. Pivaric and Antolic were continuously thwarted by the combined efforts of Kimmich and Thiago, both of whom were instrumental in regaining possession and launching counter-attacks. \n\nAs the minutes ticked down, Bayern’s dominance remained unchallenged. Even in the closing stages, they showcased a professional approach, minimizing errors and maximizing ball control. The Croatian side, though spirited, were no match for the tactical and technical superiority of the Bavarian outfit. The isolated moments of resistance from Dynamo were duly nullified, and Bayern maintained their clean sheet with minimal fuss.\n\nThe final whistle was met with both a sigh of relief and a cheer of triumph from the Allianz Arena faithful. Bayern Munich’s 5-0 mauling of Dynamo Zagreb was a comprehensive performance that highlighted their prowess in all facets of the game. From defensive solidity to midfield creativity and attacking ruthlessness, Bayern showcased why they are one of Europe’s elite clubs.\n\nThrough this match, Bayern not only collected three points but also sent a strong message to their future opponents in the Champions League. Their ability to adapt, dominate possession, and convert opportunities into goals sets them apart as formidable contenders in this season's campaign. As for Dynamo Zagreb, this encounter served as a harsh reminder of the gulf in class between domestic dominance and the demands of European football. The Croatian side will have to regroup and learn from this experience as they continue their journey in the tournament."
