Monchengladbach 1 - 1 Juventus\n\nFirst Half:\n\n0:0 Comment: and we see how Lichsteiner does return after a cardiac operation that he passed\n0:8 Comment: defense of 4 therefore and Hernanes, as you said, appears in that midfield along with Estelaro\n0:16 Comment: and Borussia Monchengladbach is putting pressure on from the second zero\n0:20 Comment: Juve has lost the ball playing with that unusual clothing\n0:23 Comment: On the right are images on the left of André Schubert's German team\n0:28 Comment: without a doubt the man of fashion right now in German football\n0:31 Comment: It is true that the undisputed leader and the champion is surely Bayern Munich.\n0:35 Comment: but right now in Germany almost everyone is talking about this man\n0:38 Comment: The truth is that he was almost a brown man with this Borussia Monchengladbach\n0:44 Comment: Sometimes Javi's clichés are, in short, quite easily refuted.\n0:52 Comment: but there are other times when it seems that there is also some truth in them.\n0:57 Comment: No?\n0:58 Comment: Sometimes we have that image of the closed, more squared German, very very organized.\n1:4 Comment: too attached to the order we would say\n1:7 Comment: and in many cases this is not the case, but for example, note that the Monchengladbach board\n1:12 Comment: is still considering after these five consecutive games winning in the Bundesliga\n1:18 Comment: of having eliminated Schalke 04 and playing a good role in the Champions League in the two games he has directed\n1:22 Comment: André Schubert is still considered interim coach\n1:24 Comment: That is to say, André Schubert still does not know if when he reaches the final of the season\n1:28 Comment: Is he going to direct the coach to the reserve team again or not?\n1:33 Comment: There are beginning to be voices even from the few players from Rafael's Granitxaca\n1:39 Comment: good that he is obviously the coach who has to finish the season\n1:43 Comment: because he is the one they are meeting best with\n1:45 Comment: Be careful the first ball into the area the defense takes the shot up\n1:49 Comment: Patrice Debra had the opportunity there\n1:51 Comment: Well, incredible, but what does Schubert have to do to have absolute confidence?\n1:55 Comment: perhaps here is a small blow from this part of the season that is not as easy as is the case with André Schubert\n1:58 Comment: If André Schubert does not continue, then the first approach\n2:1 Comment: and Patrice Debra who had a great opportunity\n2:4 Comment: Be careful that Juve seeks to step into the opposite area from the second zero\n2:10 Comment: there goes the ball for Paulo Dybala\n2:12 Comment: Dybala stops short, how good the Argentine footballer is\n2:16 Comment: sent nerves in the German defense to the area\n2:19 Comment: Juve has started very well when it comes to trying to cool this boiler\n2:23 Comment: yes and with Dybala and Morata who are two extremely mobile attackers\n2:28 Comment: very participatory, very involved in the team's game\n2:33 Comment: especially Dybala, a very elegant player\n2:36 Comment: There we see how Hernández also appears a little like a hook behind the two men in point\n2:43 Comment: and we are also going to see Paul Pogba appear on many occasions\n2:47 Comment: who is a footballer who has gas to go and return\n2:51 Comment: to appear practically wherever you want\n2:54 Comment: Well, both in a defensive aspect but above all and especially\n2:58 Comment: reaching the opposite area with great danger\n3:1 Comment: three minutes a Paul Pogba who has not started the season well at all\n3:7 Comment: little by little it is reaching its best level again\n3:9 Comment: the level that everyone knows can give\n3:11 Comment: There is the French player with the ball on the side\n3:14 Comment: very open Álvaro Morata let's see what Morata is capable of doing\n3:17 Comment: He found a solution but Dahoud appeared there to take the leather\n3:21 Comment: Juventus continues to put a lot of pressure\n3:24 Comment: at the moment that effect of playing at home\n3:28 Comment: which is a little harder to do in season\n3:28 Comment: With this great fans it is not enough for Borussia Mönchengladbach\n3:30 Comment: thanks to the work of Juve\n3:32 Comment: and there first more or less controversial action\n3:34 Comment: Álvaro Domínguez even touched him with his arm\n3:37 Comment: although it didn't look so good\n3:39 Comment: yes, it didn't feel like it was voluntary\n3:42 Comment: and I'm not entirely sure what it was\n3:43 Comment: very obviously with the arm\n3:47 Comment: I don't know if there was also something there\n3:49 Comment: rather with the pectoral area\n3:52 Comment: It's curious because we already mentioned it in the Juventus Stadium match.\n3:56 Comment: Morata and the Juventus club\n3:58 Comment: and Domínguez are two people from Madrid with crossed lives\n4:1 Comment: both Morata and Domínguez\n4:6 Comment: They were in their past as youth players\n4:10 Comment: Let's prepare Rafael here\n4:11 Comment: watch the ball on the side\n4:13 Comment: Be careful, try to get there Rafael\n4:15 Comment: there is the 2 to number 11\n4:17 Comment: In front of him is Listeina\n4:18 Comment: Ibrahima Traoré receives\n4:19 Comment: first more or less dangerous action\n4:22 Comment: from Monchengladbach\n4:24 Comment: Juventus has solved the defensive action very well\n4:28 Comment: yes, I said that the two people from Madrid\n4:30 Comment: that today are seen in the faces\n4:31 Comment: Furthermore, you will see them quite often.\n4:33 Comment: because one centers the other forward\n4:35 Comment: they both came to triumph\n4:37 Comment: one in Madrid and another in Atleti\n4:39 Comment: in the teams in which they had not started\n4:41 Comment: precisely his career\n4:42 Comment: because as youth players\n4:43 Comment: Domínguez had been in Madrid\n4:45 Comment: and Alvaro Morata\n4:46 Comment: had also gone through the lower categories\n4:49 Comment: of Atlético de Madrid and Getafe\n4:52 Comment: so... well\n4:53 Comment: today both of us, Álvaros\n4:55 Comment: Dominguez and Morata\n4:56 Comment: faces are seen again\n4:58 Comment: Probably, I guess when the game is over they will hug each other.\n5:1 Comment: And in fact we have seen it just before going out onto the field of the game, the more than affectionate hug between the two protagonists.\n5:7 Comment: Well, now another action outside the Listeina area.\n5:11 Comment: Perhaps here the arm was clearly more detached, although it did not seem to be voluntary either.\n5:16 Comment: Yes, of course, the arm extended does not always imply what you say, it does not always imply voluntariness.\n5:23 Comment: I don't think the regulations say anything.\n5:24 Comment: Exactly, it speaks of a voluntary gesture, a gesture...\n5:30 Comment: Deliberate.\n5:31 Comment: Deliberate, correct, that's the exact word.\n5:35 Comment: Although obviously many referees sometimes confuse us all because they don't seem to have it clear.\n5:41 Comment: Yes, it's one of those black spots in the regulations that would probably help if they were finally closed, right?\n5:49 Comment: By the International Board.\n5:51 Comment: While a little of the decision of...\n5:54 Comment: It is also true from the referee that it is very difficult to regulate this and that there also has to be a part of the regulation that is interpretive by the referee.\n6:4 Comment: Six minutes the ball for Gran Ishaka.\n6:6 Comment: The Basel footballer plays.\n6:8 Comment: Ball to the Swede, Oscar Wendt.\n6:11 Comment: He stops dead and finds Rafael there.\n6:14 Comment: Rafael gains meters, Monche points out that control is very complicated for Stindel.\n6:18 Comment: But find a way out, Norbeit.\n6:20 Comment: There goes Ibrahima Traoré, it's going to be a nightmare for Ebrard for sure.\n6:23 Comment: How fast Traoré is!\n6:24 Comment: Yeah!\n6:24 Comment: Yes, Traoré!\n6:25 Comment: The ball looking there.\n6:27 Comment: Rafael took out the defense.\n6:29 Comment: Well, we see there one of the great attractions of the party.\n6:32 Comment: The Guinean international who will continually look for one-on-one.\n6:36 Comment: Yes, a player who has a lot of spirit to challenge, indeed, one on one, to overwhelm.\n6:45 Comment: Left-handed, playing on the right wing.\n6:47 Comment: We can already sense that in addition to arriving he is also going to look for a shot.\n6:52 Comment: Here we see the talascada.\n6:54 Comment: It is strong on the part of Hernanes, del Prophet, as this former Lazio and Inter player is nicknamed.\n7:4 Comment: Very good performances at Lazio, not so much at Inter.\n7:9 Comment: And I said that we are indeed going to see many offensive inclusions from Ibrahima Traoré,\n7:15 Comment: But he has also commented in the days prior to this match that he is not the footballer who loves defensive work the most,\n7:21 Comment: but what the team demands.\n7:23 Comment: And he will be there helping his side in this case to try to avoid numerical superiorities on the right wing.\n7:31 Comment: Care in recovery. There goes Dajud. Rafael is moving now. We'll see.\n7:35 Comment: Dajud is still there. The ball for Rafael. The ball finally goes to Buffon.\n7:39 Comment: The Monche Klapa who is starting to find spaces to run.\n7:43 Comment: Yes, I think that the international player with the German youth teams, although born in Syria, Mahmoud Aoud, made a mistake there.\n7:51 Comment: Because I had Traoré open and I think he was quite bad.\n7:53 Comment: And he has become freer, right? Just when he passed the ball to Rafael.\n7:58 Comment: Well, Licksteina also appeared. I think she would have been more likely to succeed on the counter if she had seen Ibrahima Traoré wide open.\n8:8 Comment: Traoré tries again. The ball goes to Claudio Marquisio in the center of the field, who loses immediately.\n8:14 Comment: There are many inaccuracies now on the part of Juventus.\n8:17 Comment: It seems that the Borussia Monche Klapa that they dreamed of at Borussia Park finally appears.\n8:21 Comment: Great Isaka is clearly becoming.\n8:23 Comment: With the handle of the match, the Basel footballer.\n8:27 Comment: An insulting youth and it is difficult to know where this man has his ceiling.\n8:33 Comment: There's Rafael. Rafael feinted with the shot. His position was very far away.\n8:37 Comment: The change of direction. Cut Patrice Ebrard.\n8:40 Comment: Juve now plays through Morata.\n8:43 Comment: Pol Pogba with Marquisio Esturaro.\n8:45 Comment: A priori Pol Pogba could have a little more freedom to seek to serve as a link to Dybala, Morata and Hernández.\n8:52 Comment: Yeah.\n8:53 Comment: It is clear what we were saying.\n8:55 Comment: Pol Pogba will appear with much more freedom than Esturaro and Marquisio.\n9:0 Comment: Marquisio probably another man who has evidently noticed.\n9:4 Comment: Like the entire Juve midfield.\n9:6 Comment: Well, the departure of men as important as Andrea Pirlo, like Arturo Vidal.\n9:11 Comment: And in a slightly more advanced phase still, Carlos Tevez.\n9:15 Comment: Three significant casualties that probably everyone in Turin could sense would be noticed.\n9:20 Comment: But I don't know if that much.\n9:21 Comment: As the team has really noticed.\n9:23 Comment: At this start of the season.\n9:25 Comment: Another offensive play now.\n9:27 Comment: The ball goes to the side.\n9:28 Comment: Norveig Law.\n9:29 Comment: Center to the area.\n9:30 Comment: Very past.\n9:31 Comment: Well, so much so that the opposing side is going to arrive at the end.\n9:33 Comment: It was Fabian Johnson who looked for the center first.\n9:36 Comment: Bonucci clears with serious difficulties.\n9:39 Comment: The German team is pushing really hard now.\n9:42 Comment: Álvaro Domínguez touched the ball on a throw-in.\n9:44 Comment: And the man from Madrid is not too happy with his clearance or his attempt to assist.\n9:51 Comment: Clearly.\n9:52 Comment: Aitor.\n9:52 Comment: Watching the ball.\n9:53 Comment: 9 minutes almost 10.\n9:54 Comment: This match seems to be very different from the one played in Italy.\n9:58 Comment: Yes, totally.\n9:59 Comment: We saw a very close game.\n10:1 Comment: Quite unpleasant for the neutral viewer.\n10:5 Comment: And especially on the part of...\n10:7 Comment: Be careful here.\n10:8 Comment: Anyway.\n10:9 Comment: Jan Soma.\n10:10 Comment: The risk he has taken.\n10:11 Comment: And how he has flirted there with the cardiovascular stability of Borussia Mönchengladbach fans.\n10:16 Comment: Well, I said that especially on the part of Borussia Mönchengladbach.\n10:21 Comment: That in Turin.\n10:22 Comment: I think he showed his most surly, most defensive side.\n10:27 Comment: Amarrategui.\n10:28 Comment: Yes, yes, totally.\n10:29 Comment: And Schubert himself recognized it, right?\n10:32 Comment: He has said that in fact in Italy they played a game to try to scratch that little spot.\n10:39 Comment: The move worked out for him.\n10:40 Comment: And today he was going to see a much happier face.\n10:43 Comment: There's Traoré.\n10:44 Comment: Cheerful as himself, without a doubt.\n10:45 Comment: Looking to surpass Patrice Brahe.\n10:47 Comment: Now he didn't get it.\n10:48 Comment: But he chases the ball immediately.\n10:50 Comment: You can see how hungry this player is.\n10:51 Comment: Brahe, evidently, is a fast man with all the skills in the world.\n10:57 Comment: Take out Buffon.\n10:58 Comment: Borussia Mönchengladbach is going to put pressure on the top.\n11:1 Comment: Watch out for Dahoud's recovery.\n11:3 Comment: The ball doesn't last long for Vecchia Signora.\n11:6 Comment: Andreas Christensen starts on the right side.\n11:9 Comment: Norbert.\n11:12 Comment: Follow 2 to number 6.\n11:14 Comment: Right now Juve is forcing the play.\n11:19 Comment: The German team, clearly dominating the match.\n11:23 Comment: Jan Sommer.\n11:24 Comment: Watch out for Sommer.\n11:25 Comment: Again, now he cuts over Morata.\n11:27 Comment: Come back again.\n11:28 Comment: There to play with the error Garrafal, the Swiss goalkeeper.\n11:31 Comment: He doesn't want to raffle a ball.\n11:33 Comment: And sometimes it's not a bad idea.\n11:35 Comment: Especially having Morata pressing.\n11:38 Comment: Okay, Dahoud giving out.\n11:40 Comment: He is always number one when looking for that pass from the goalkeeper.\n11:43 Comment: And now, Morata's goal.\n11:44 Comment: It's a Morata goal.\n11:48 Comment: The goalkeeper passes.\n11:51 Comment: There is Bra's fight now with Norbert.\n11:54 Comment: Hyper-offensive winger in these 11 minutes, almost 12.\n11:58 Comment: Yes, last week, without going any further, we saw another Swiss goalkeeper performing in Germany.\n12:4 Comment: To Burki, the Borussia Dortmund goalkeeper.\n12:8 Comment: That he suffered a goal in the German Cup precisely because of that, right?\n12:11 Comment: Because of that resistance that many times...\n12:14 Comment: Well, it's a trend.\n12:15 Comment: Right now it is no longer required only for goals.\n12:18 Comment: Not only the defenders, but also the goalkeepers have good footwork.\n12:23 Comment: And that requirement sometimes becomes almost dogma, right?\n12:26 Comment: When there are situations in which it seems the most logical and most convenient thing for the goalkeeper to simply remove the ball from him and remove the danger from his goal.\n12:37 Comment: But, well, on the part of the technicians it seems that...\n12:42 Comment: Or from some technicians it seems that there is an obligation to convert the deployment.\n12:46 Comment: The display of feet is anathema.\n12:49 Comment: And that often complicates life for both goalkeepers and centre-backs.\n12:52 Comment: Be careful here Pogba, he's doing well.\n12:54 Comment: Although in the end he ends up losing the ball.\n12:57 Comment: The leather for Stindel.\n12:58 Comment: Stindel plays short.\n13:0 Comment: Let's see the shot...\n13:1 Comment: Crossbar!\n13:4 Comment: What a missile!\n13:5 Comment: That crashed into Buffon's crossbar.\n13:8 Comment: They were almost celebrating the goal at Borussia Park.\n13:11 Comment: What a wonderful shot!\n13:12 Comment: Yes, I think it was Daúl, the young player, who is one of the...\n13:16 Comment: Few really trustworthy additions by Andrés Schubert.\n13:22 Comment: Clearly bringing this young player to the side of...\n13:25 Comment: There we see him effectively, next to Granit Xhaka in that double pivot.\n13:29 Comment: A player with a very good touch on the ball.\n13:31 Comment: And there we see him with a fantastic early shot.\n13:34 Comment: How you get all the effect by hitting with the slightly outside part of the boot.\n13:38 Comment: Well, a very good shot by Daúl.\n13:41 Comment: A fine player who is, I believe, showing very good form.\n13:45 Comment: In this start, in this good start to differentiate itself from the bad start that Borussia Mönchengladbach had.\n13:52 Comment: In this good start that Andrés Schubert's team is having.\n13:55 Comment: With this rebirth because it is a new and very different stage.\n14:1 Comment: What a wonderful shot!\n14:2 Comment: The goal undoubtedly deserved the goal from the Syrian footballer.\n14:6 Comment: Ball through the center of the field for Marquisio.\n14:9 Comment: There is a very important novelty for the other party.\n14:13 Comment: Seville 0-1 Madrid.\n14:15 Comment: Manchester City 2-14.\n14:17 Comment: Goals from Sterling and Fernandinho.\n14:19 Comment: That means Aitor, if I'm not mistaken, that if Juve wins there are two already classified with two days left.\n14:25 Comment: Yes, that is indeed the issue.\n14:29 Comment: If both City and Juve win, they both pass.\n14:33 Comment: And therefore Sevilla and Borussia Mönchengladbach would be in the fight for third place.\n14:40 Comment: Here we have repeated Daúl's shot again.\n14:45 Comment: Fifteen minutes.\n14:47 Comment: Gladbach plays.\n14:49 Comment: At the moment much better than Juve.\n14:51 Comment: When we see that Álvaro Morata is off the pitch.\n14:56 Comment: Ibrahima Traoré is still there on the 16th.\n14:59 Comment: The ball looking for Stindel.\n15:1 Comment: We'll see.\n15:2 Comment: Hunt the leather at the end on the 13th.\n15:3 Comment: Oscar Wendt is going to try the center.\n15:6 Comment: Traoré crosses the middle of the game.\n15:9 Comment: He goes to the opposite side.\n15:10 Comment: The center now easy in the hands of Gianluigi Buffon.\n15:14 Comment: Juve is there trying to change the storm as they can.\n15:20 Comment: At the moment Patrice Braga is clearly the one who suffers the most in the field of play.\n15:25 Comment: Chiellini with Buffon.\n15:26 Comment: Lars Stindel is going to pressure again.\n15:28 Comment: The entire Borussia Mönchengladbach looked to steal the ball from the beginning of the Italian team's play.\n15:35 Comment: Yes, it is now difficult for Massimiliano Allegri's team to find their way to Jansson's area.\n15:43 Comment: After having started with quite remarkable intensity with approaches to the Swiss goalkeeper's goal.\n15:53 Comment: Now we see what Borussia Mönchengladbach is like, as you say, especially on that right wing.\n15:59 Comment: Then he has two forwards up there who are quite unforward so to speak.\n16:3 Comment: Neither of them is clearly a reference.\n16:4 Comment: Rafael is the more forward of the two but he is a second striker.\n16:8 Comment: He is perhaps also a man of attachment.\n16:11 Comment: And Lars Stindel acted in everything.\n16:12 Comment: Yes, he is a second striker.\n16:13 Comment: But not as a striker, it's a bit of a reformulation.\n16:18 Comment: He gets quite close to the goal also because he is a man who can contribute work in pressing from very advanced positions.\n16:27 Comment: I think he has three goals in the Bundesliga.\n16:29 Comment: Rafael has five.\n16:31 Comment: And well, it is true that they are very mobile like Dybala and Morata in turn at Juventus.\n16:38 Comment: But it is also true that perhaps Borussia Mönchengladbach is missing a second line.\n16:42 Comment: That is to say, if we contrast the two three-quarter lines that the teams have, Juve clearly wins.\n16:50 Comment: They have men who can contribute goals like Hernanes with a very good shot.\n16:54 Comment: Pogba himself, who we have already said has a lot of arrival.\n16:56 Comment: Much more than Borussia Mönchengladbach.\n16:59 Comment: And the German team is trying with those weapons that have certainly been able to score a goal with Dahoud's tremendous shot.\n17:7 Comment: Almost 20 minutes.\n17:9 Comment: The ball on the side.\n17:10 Comment: There it's 20 minutes.\n17:11 Comment: Up there, Oscar Wendt joins.\n17:13 Comment: The center to the area.\n17:14 Comment: Note here the in and the error.\n17:15 Comment: There's Rafael.\n17:16 Comment: Rafael plays for the side.\n17:18 Comment: Goal!\n17:24 Comment: Fabian Johnson for Borussia Mönchengladbach.\n17:27 Comment: Rafael gave the shot to his partner.\n17:30 Comment: And on the 19th he did not waste the opportunity.\n17:33 Comment: The unstoppable cross shot for goalkeeper Gigi Buffon.\n17:37 Comment: He was chewing.\n17:38 Comment: It was smelling.\n17:39 Comment: Juve were suffering.\n17:40 Comment: Juve kisses the canvas.\n17:42 Comment: Borussia Mönchengladbach scores.\n17:44 Comment: Send a message.\n17:45 Comment: We want to stay alive in the fight.\n17:47 Comment: Tremendous mistake from a man like Chiellini who does not usually make those types of mistakes.\n17:53 Comment: Well, Gladbach was actually lurking around that approach.\n18:0 Comment: When we have seen here that it was Fabian Johnson who acted for the changed band.\n18:6 Comment: On the right side when he was hitting him on the left.\n18:9 Comment: Indeed the defense of Juventus is soft.\n18:12 Comment: Unbecoming of a team like Juventus Turin.\n18:15 Comment: And as we say, Fabian Johnson.\n18:17 Comment: Well, we were talking before about perhaps the little goal that that second line of men at Borussia Mönchengladbach had.\n18:24 Comment: Well, as soon as I mentioned this.\n18:26 Comment: The second line appears.\n18:27 Comment: In this case Fabian Johnson.\n18:29 Comment: He has only one goal this season in the Bundesliga.\n18:33 Comment: He is certainly not a particularly scoring player.\n18:36 Comment: But today he really saw a good game.\n18:38 Comment: Today he has seen a goal.\n18:40 Comment: Fabian Johnson was about to comment on it earlier.\n18:42 Comment: He was born in Munich.\n18:44 Comment: But like many players who are coming out right now.\n18:51 Comment: And they've been dating for a while now.\n18:53 Comment: He takes advantage of the fact that his father was an American soldier in a detachment in Germany.\n19:2 Comment: Well here again Jan Soma.\n19:4 Comment: Now he opts for the long punt.\n19:8 Comment: He takes advantage of the fact that his father is American to play for the United States national team.\n19:14 Comment: In which there is also a perfect connoisseur of German football such as Jürgen Klinsmann.\n19:19 Comment: There is also John Brooks, the center back of Lerta from Berlin.\n19:22 Comment: There is Julian Green, the young striker from Bayern Munich.\n19:27 Comment: And Fabian Johnson in the American team acts as a full-back.\n19:32 Comment: Here he actually acts as a winger.\n19:34 Comment: And well, he has added that first goal in his history in the Champions League.\n19:38 Comment: Esturaro plays.\n19:40 Comment: Almost 20 minutes of Juve's charge.\n19:43 Comment: The question now, aitors.\n19:45 Comment: Did Gladbach score too early?\n19:47 Comment: That is to say, Juve wakes up now and there are many minutes left.\n19:52 Comment: It's very complicated.\n19:54 Comment: Because you know what happens?\n19:56 Comment: That when a team is so, so, so, so, so involved in a good streak like Gladbach.\n20:0 Comment: In other words, right now it seems that probably with Fabian the team was clearly underperforming.\n20:7 Comment: But it's not like that.\n20:8 Comment: Gladbach is performing below its capabilities.\n20:11 Comment: I wouldn't dare say a percentage.\n20:13 Comment: But if we said even below 50%, probably no one could call us exaggerated.\n20:18 Comment: Now it's the opposite case.\n20:20 Comment: Now we see a team that is at 120, 130% of its capacity, of its possibilities.\n20:26 Comment: And probably the fact of having started winning only reinforces that positive trend even more.\n20:33 Comment: But well, yes.\n20:35 Comment: Clear.\n20:36 Comment: But it is a team that has a staff that is an old dog, that has a twisted fang, despite the fact that it has not started too well in Serie A.\n20:42 Comment: And he has 70 minutes ahead of him.\n20:44 Comment: He's pushing again.\n20:46 Comment: That's Tindel.\n20:47 Comment: The fight with Paul Pogba.\n20:49 Comment: Be careful, Gladbach takes the ball.\n20:51 Comment: Pogba's role.\n20:52 Comment: Let's see what the second one can fall.\n20:54 Comment: There's Traoré.\n20:55 Comment: Traoré can take the shot.\n20:56 Comment: Center.\n20:57 Comment: Back.\n20:58 Comment: Chiellini to corner.\n20:59 Comment: Well, Paul Pogba has this kind of thing sometimes, doesn't he?\n21:2 Comment: That perhaps he is so good that he tries maneuvers in the center of the field.\n21:5 Comment: What counterattacks like this can cost.\n21:7 Comment: If it is too good.\n21:9 Comment: He's very young too.\n21:10 Comment: Because even though we have been following him for a couple of seasons.\n21:13 Comment: Be careful here.\n21:14 Comment: Watch out for the shot.\n21:15 Comment: Buffon to corner.\n21:16 Comment: It's up to him to score the second.\n21:19 Comment: My goodness, how is Borussia Mönchengladbach?\n21:21 Comment: That's what I'm telling you, right?\n21:22 Comment: He scored the goal.\n21:23 Comment: It is true that Juve is perhaps taking a little too much notice of what we say about the psychological moment of both teams.\n21:28 Comment: While Juventus still hasn't finished cleaning up that doubtful start.\n21:33 Comment: On the other hand, Borussia Mönchengladbach has won.\n21:35 Comment: Right now everything you touch turns to gold, right?\n21:37 Comment: And with this 1-0, 46,000 people in the stadium.\n21:41 Comment: It's really there to mark the second, as you say.\n21:45 Comment: There the ball goes to the area.\n21:46 Comment: Beware of the possible auction.\n21:47 Comment: Chiellini clears up that he is having all the work in the world.\n21:50 Comment: Norvait.\n21:52 Comment: So far Chiellini has made a major mistake and saved the second with that great intervention.\n21:58 Comment: Play Oscar Gwent.\n21:59 Comment: Now we recap.\n22:0 Comment: The group would be with City.\n22:2 Comment: 9 points.\n22:3 Comment: Juve 7.\n22:4 Comment: Borussia Mönchengladbach.\n22:5 Comment: 4.\n22:6 Comment: Sevilla would be bottom with 3.\n22:8 Comment: Gladbach surviving that group of death and...\n22:12 Comment: And against all odds, Javi.\n22:14 Comment: And with a trip to Manchester in the next week.\n22:17 Comment: Obviously the German team is not going to be the favorite in Manchester, but who knows.\n22:25 Comment: Monchengladbach 1.\n22:30 Comment: Juventus 0.\n22:31 Comment: Remember the first three days of the Champions League.\n22:34 Comment: Only one point for the German team.\n22:36 Comment: And for example, only in the history of the Champions League, only one team has passed the round after losing the first three games.\n22:45 Comment: Gladbach tied 1, but only one team did it and it was Newcastle many years ago.\n22:49 Comment: There goes Norvait.\n22:50 Comment: Norvait's shot.\n22:52 Comment: In the hands of Gigi Buffon are the Juve men chasing shadows.\n22:57 Comment: Aid arrives late.\n22:58 Comment: At the moment Massimiliano Allegri's team is in a bit of chaos.\n23:2 Comment: Yes, there we see Norvait.\n23:3 Comment: Yes, there we see Norvait, who is a man who normally acts as a pivot, as a defensive pivot.\n23:11 Comment: But due to the absence of the team's two right backs, both Korb and Janske, he has had to resort.\n23:18 Comment: Look, even with...\n23:19 Comment: The fact is that the losses are not minor, because above all Patrick Herman is a very important player.\n23:25 Comment: In my opinion, I would say that he is the best gifted of the entire squad.\n23:30 Comment: André Hahn is also out.\n23:32 Comment: Let's see this action here first.\n23:33 Comment: Well, there is Tahut.\n23:34 Comment: The pass is not too good for incorporation.\n23:37 Comment: From Ibrahima Traoré, who has changed bands.\n23:40 Comment: Now the one who is going to suffer, Listeina.\n23:42 Comment: The leather is a little short.\n23:44 Comment: Borunchi gets the ball off his back right now.\n23:47 Comment: Juve breathes momentarily, because Norvait is there again.\n23:50 Comment: Watch out for the shot!\n23:51 Comment: Confidence is through the roof.\n23:53 Comment: And this boy, who, as you say, is not a usual right back.\n23:57 Comment: To me he seems like a lifelong player and a very good side.\n24:1 Comment: Yes Yes.\n24:2 Comment: Well, I insist, the casualties are numerous and have been even more during the previous days in the Bundesliga.\n24:10 Comment: And that adds even more to André Schubert's merit, doesn't it?\n24:15 Comment: In this almost miraculous resurrection of Borussia Mönchengladbach.\n24:21 Comment: He is missing Patrick Herman, who as I say is a very important man in this team's attack.\n24:26 Comment: It was already last year and it has been for the last few seasons.\n24:31 Comment: After the departure of Reus from Kruse last year, he will probably be the next player who will be very difficult for Borussia Mönchengladbach to retain.\n24:44 Comment: Let's see, there is no offside.\n24:46 Comment: They can kill Dybala.\n24:47 Comment: The rebounded ball will be a corner kick.\n24:49 Comment: Well, Juve's first big chance after those two good opening minutes.\n24:54 Comment: Yes, look here the leaked ball is not offside.\n24:58 Comment: It is Morata who assists his partner.\n25:0 Comment: He is a player who assists his teammate up top.\n25:2 Comment: As we say, very mobile players, very participative at the top.\n25:7 Comment: It is probably also necessary for Hernanes to take a step forward.\n25:10 Comment: Hernanes has probably seen his performance hindered by that little step backwards that he has drawn in his game.\n25:17 Comment: Watch out for the header, now Chiellini had the chance!\n25:21 Comment: That little step back that Hernanes has taken even in his disposition on the pitch.\n25:28 Comment: And closer to the rival goal, I think that is where this footballer really has to vindicate himself, who, above all, as I say, in Lazio left very good games.\n25:40 Comment: 25 minutes.\n25:42 Comment: The Vecchia Signora begins to appear at Borussia Park.\n25:45 Comment: There's Pol Pogba.\n25:47 Comment: He is going to play on the right looking for Paulo Dybala.\n25:50 Comment: The Argentine plays.\n25:52 Comment: Let's see the shot at Jan Sommer's hands.\n25:54 Comment: The game right now is much more balanced.\n25:56 Comment: We'll see!\n25:57 Comment: Much more balanced and it seems that Juventus is finally scaring the Swiss goalkeeper.\n26:3 Comment: Ibrahima Traoré comes out of the pressure very well there.\n26:6 Comment: The footballer who arrived from Stuttgart two seasons ago.\n26:9 Comment: Long ball.\n26:11 Comment: The dynamic has clearly changed right now with these two three long Juventus possessions.\n26:16 Comment: Yes, Juve has shaken off the pressure and that feeling of almost constant danger that it was having immediately after...\n26:25 Comment: ...of the goal of...\n26:26 Comment: ...of Fabian Johnson's goal.\n26:29 Comment: While Benoit Tremolina scored for Sevilla against City.\n26:32 Comment: 1-2.\n26:34 Comment: At the moment the English team is classified like this.\n26:37 Comment: Pol Pogba.\n26:40 Comment: Ball through the center of the field.\n26:42 Comment: Bonucci raises the ball.\n26:44 Comment: Dybala tries to play there with Álvaro Morata, with Marquís.\n26:49 Comment: It was the one who was off the hook in that area.\n26:51 Comment: Jan Sommer controls the situation.\n26:54 Comment: At the moment there are only goals in this Champions League group.\n26:59 Comment: The group of death, one of the most competitive.\n27:2 Comment: It was clear that it was going to be an exciting group and it is.\n27:5 Comment: Granit Xhaka quickly looks for Ibrahima Traoré.\n27:9 Comment: Following the evolution of the German team that did not deserve to lose against City.\n27:13 Comment: Then they tied with Juve and now they are beating them.\n27:15 Comment: Traore.\n27:16 Comment: Let's see Rafael.\n27:17 Comment: He turns around.\n27:18 Comment: The 2-11 is still there.\n27:19 Comment: The Brazilian plays the front.\n27:20 Comment: The shot.\n27:21 Comment: Xhaka up.\n27:22 Comment: Which has to be.\n27:23 Comment: What a shot this man also has with his left leg.\n27:26 Comment: The captain of Borussia Mönchengladbach, the heart of this team.\n27:29 Comment: These finishes with a medium-distance shot are very powerful and very good.\n27:35 Comment: The two from North and now the one from Granit Xhaka.\n27:38 Comment: They are missing out for very little.\n27:40 Comment: The men in Gladbach's midfield have a very sharp focus.\n27:46 Comment: And also thus avoiding the possibility of a counterattack by Juve.\n27:49 Comment: City needs a draw.\n27:52 Comment: A draw in this match means that their victory will make them directly a team in the next round.\n28:1 Comment: Or, as we have already said, it is Juve who wins.\n28:6 Comment: Almost half an hour.\n28:8 Comment: Well, that's the situation.\n28:10 Comment: This group D.\n28:12 Comment: What a good job Aitor is doing that man.\n28:15 Comment: Rafael is the great advantage that placing a man who is not a center forward gives you.\n28:20 Comment: As a more advanced man.\n28:21 Comment: That doesn't always look forward.\n28:23 Comment: Many times you look back and great options arrive.\n28:25 Comment: Be careful now.\n28:26 Comment: Let's see Patrice Ebrard.\n28:27 Comment: He's going to take out the center.\n28:28 Comment: Ball back for Paul Pogba.\n28:29 Comment: Pogba turns around.\n28:31 Comment: Be careful, Juve continues to insist there.\n28:33 Comment: It seems that it is impossible to get the shot off.\n28:35 Comment: Good recovery for the Germans.\n28:36 Comment: They look for the counter in the end.\n28:38 Comment: Leisteiner puts the ball to the side.\n28:40 Comment: Save Patrice Ebrard.\n28:44 Comment: There goes the French player.\n28:45 Comment: French connection in fact now with Paul Pogba.\n28:48 Comment: Patrice Ebrard puts the ball into the area.\n28:50 Comment: Paulo Dybala's shot.\n28:52 Comment: It's gone too far.\n28:58 Comment: Well, but we already see Juve combining.\n29:0 Comment: We have seen Patrice Ebrard on that wing also gaining a baseline.\n29:4 Comment: However, we have not seen Leisteiner do the same.\n29:7 Comment: But at least Patrice Ebrard has reached that bottom line.\n29:10 Comment: It is true that later that arrival has escaped him a little.\n29:14 Comment: With successive backward balls.\n29:17 Comment: With successive\n29:18 Comment: And that's it.\n29:20 Comment: Setbacks by first Pogba and then Hernanes.\n29:23 Comment: But Juve has effectively stopped the blow.\n29:26 Comment: Which I think is the most important thing after that situation in which Borussia Mönchengladbach has been seen with revs raised.\n29:35 Comment: After that Fabian Johnson goal.\n29:37 Comment: And well we commented on the absence.\n29:41 Comment: We have commented on the absence.\n29:43 Comment: Look here we continue to see the center backs and Jan Soma with some danger.\n29:48 Comment: With some risk when taking the ball.\n29:51 Comment: They certainly have incredible confidence in the Swiss goalkeeper.\n29:55 Comment: Yes and we said that in addition to Díaz because of that muscular overload.\n30:2 Comment: Well Andrea Barzagli isn't there either.\n30:5 Comment: A totally technical decision by Massimiliano Allegri.\n30:10 Comment: We also said that Dybala definitely gives you the feeling that he has won the game against Manu Kicic.\n30:16 Comment: In the position of Morata's companion.\n30:19 Comment: And well, that appearance there by Hernanes that we already saw in the game against Torino.\n30:26 Comment: Well, it also has to finish justifying itself.\n30:31 Comment: Because the person who has left out Massimiliano Allegri for the Brazilian to come in is Juan Cuadrado.\n30:37 Comment: Which is precisely the man who gave him victory in the Turin derby.\n30:41 Comment: And if things continue like this he will obviously have minutes throughout this game.\n30:45 Comment: If not there will be the second part for sure.\n30:47 Comment: There is Hernanes.\n30:48 Comment: Hernanes plays with Paul Pogba.\n30:50 Comment: The former United player advances.\n30:52 Comment: Center of the dangerous area.\n30:54 Comment: At the moment the center backs Christensen and Álvaro Domínguez are doing well.\n30:57 Comment: Pogba was fouled and they are demanding a yellow card due to the intensity of the foul.\n31:2 Comment: Not because of gravity.\n31:4 Comment: We have read again Chiellini's mistake as Raphael.\n31:7 Comment: There he had the opportunity to take the shot.\n31:9 Comment: But he chose the best option.\n31:11 Comment: It is obviously advantageous to say it now.\n31:13 Comment: Oh well.\n31:14 Comment: It was clearly the best option.\n31:16 Comment: Yes Yes Yes.\n31:17 Comment: Well, Chiellini's failure is a bit of what explains beyond the good action on the left wing.\n31:25 Comment: Rafael's good vision and of course the obvious success of Fabian Johnson as well.\n31:30 Comment: But all this would not have happened if Chiellini did not step on it when clearing the ball.\n31:36 Comment: Last quarter of an hour of the first part.\n31:39 Comment: Fabian Johnson gives three very valuable points to Borussia Monchengladbach.\n31:42 Comment: That would end up with four points.\n31:44 Comment: With six more at stake.\n31:45 Comment: The goal of reaching ten and hunting for one of those two Champions League places.\n31:49 Comment: If not the lesser prize obviously.\n31:51 Comment: Hunt for the third place that this team would continue to maintain in Europe.\n31:55 Comment: But in the Europa League and the last game would be against Sevilla in this stadium.\n32:0 Comment: Thirty-two minutes of meeting.\n32:2 Comment: Ball for the Turin team.\n32:5 Comment: Marseille is going to play.\n32:7 Comment: The Turin team.\n32:8 Comment: Marseille is going to play.\n32:9 Comment: The Turin team.\n32:11 Comment: Marquísio is going to play.\n32:17 Comment: There is Joy.\n32:18 Comment: A man who is difficult to tell if he is happy or sad.\n32:21 Comment: He always has that same gesture.\n32:23 Comment: Let's see the shot.\n32:24 Comment: Up now from Paulo Dybala.\n32:26 Comment: The stands.\n32:27 Comment: The Borussia Monchengladbach fans celebrate it.\n32:31 Comment: Although at least Paulo Dybala is appearing again and again.\n32:33 Comment: At the moment much more involved in the game than Álvaro Morata.\n32:36 Comment: He is also a very different forward.\n32:38 Comment: Much more mobile.\n32:39 Comment: Morata more finisher.\n32:40 Comment: Yeah.\n32:41 Comment: Yes it's true.\n32:42 Comment: But hey, Morata is not a player who functions autonomously and independently either.\n32:49 Comment: to the rest of the team's game.\n32:52 Comment: And it is true that today it is appearing a little.\n32:55 Comment: There has been a fraction of five minutes in which they have alternated.\n33:0 Comment: Dybala normally enters as a forward on the right, taking advantage of the fact that he is left-footed.\n33:5 Comment: Morata is ambidextrous.\n33:7 Comment: He handles both legs perfectly well.\n33:9 Comment: It appears on the left.\n33:11 Comment: They have alternated attacking the centre-backs in reverse, but now they are back together.\n33:16 Comment: positioned, I think, just as they started the game.\n33:20 Comment: And what we are seeing is that Juve once again has the position of the ball.\n33:24 Comment: That there has been a section of the game that has escaped him.\n33:28 Comment: Be careful with the shot now.\n33:29 Comment: The ball bounced into the hands of Jan Sommer.\n33:33 Comment: Without too many complications the Swiss goalkeeper catches the ball.\n33:37 Comment: Come on!\n33:38 Comment: Remember this Borussia Mönchengladbach that has risen from last position to fifth in the Bundesliga with those six consecutive wins.\n33:46 Comment: Being the most in-form team in the championship in these last six rounds because even Bayern has dropped a couple of points in these matches.\n33:54 Comment: It would certainly be quite interesting to see a match in Germany between Bayern and Mönchengladbach right now.\n34:4 Comment: Well look, it won't take long to happen.\n34:6 Comment: Specifically in four days.\n34:9 Comment: And also at Borussia Mönchengladbach's home.\n34:13 Comment: Man, he sensed that André Schubert's team won't arrive without knowing either defeat or a draw because if that's the case...\n34:23 Comment: What rivals do you have before?\n34:24 Comment: Well, first you have Ingolstadt, Hannover and Hoffenheim.\n34:27 Comment: So they certainly aren't complicated.\n34:29 Comment: Well, he could arrive with nine games in a row won.\n34:33 Comment: The record in Germany was six.\n34:34 Comment: And how was the match?\n34:35 Comment: Billy Entemann achieved it at Stuttgart in the 80s.\n34:41 Comment: He has already equaled it.\n34:42 Comment: André Schubert could now surpass him this day against Ingolstadt.\n34:47 Comment: And well, really look, therein lies the challenge.\n34:51 Comment: Let's see if they can get to the match against Pep Guardiola's Bayern with all their victories.\n34:56 Comment: It really would be spectacular.\n34:58 Comment: And indeed what we said before, right?\n35:1 Comment: What more does the board of this team need to definitively take the game away?\n35:4 Comment: To definitively remove the Interino, Interino last name from the coach label that André Schubert has, right?\n35:12 Comment: Maybe it has a psychological factor, right?\n35:15 Comment: That is, we are going to leave you the Interim role so that you can continue showing that you can not be one.\n35:20 Comment: No, notice that the newspaper Bill commented that he is quite sensational but he is usually quite well informed in sports.\n35:30 Comment: He commented that...\n35:32 Comment: That precisely what they expect is to see how he handles a defeat.\n35:36 Comment: That is, they are waiting to see how...\n35:38 Comment: Let a defeat come to see how André Schubert manages.\n35:40 Comment: That is, it is not all the product of a soufflé.\n35:43 Comment: That right now, since everything is going so well, this winning inertia covers up some of the shortcomings.\n35:49 Comment: Eye on the opportunity now for Gladbach.\n35:51 Comment: Escargüen arrived there. He thanks you for your assistance but it is very forced.\n35:54 Comment: Well, it is certainly one of the interesting stories right now in European football, eh?\n36:0 Comment: This situation is very interesting.\n36:1 Comment: This situation of André Schubert with Borussia Mönchengladbach.\n36:5 Comment: And we're all going to be waiting to see when that defeat comes and to see how he handles it.\n36:9 Comment: Let's see if everything collapses like a house of cards.\n36:13 Comment: Because always working with the wind in your favor, as many obviously know how to do, is more complicated when things go wrong.\n36:21 Comment: Yes, but of course, when he arrives they were already very crooked.\n36:25 Comment: You already passed, let's say, that exam because...\n36:30 Comment: The trial period of any employment contract.\n36:33 Comment: Sure, yes, yes.\n36:34 Comment: Well, now they still haven't made him permanent, they haven't made him a permanent contract.\n36:39 Comment: Well, he said, he joked that in reality all the technicians are actually interim.\n36:43 Comment: That is to say, what happens is that there in Germany they repeat the label a lot and it really is that they have that character of interim coach and they have not wanted to change this situation.\n36:58 Comment: And they probably won't until it arrives.\n36:59 Comment: They probably won't do it until the winter market break arrives.\n37:3 Comment: That there in Germany it is one month due to weather issues is a characteristic, a tradition in the Bundesliga.\n37:11 Comment: And probably, I insist, I do not think that the fact that they will remove that characteristic from André Schubert is going to happen.\n37:21 Comment: Almost 40 minutes City marks the third in Seville.\n37:29 Comment: While Juve tries to tie this match.\n37:32 Comment: How can the group be, spectacular, although obviously with very bad news for the Spanish team.\n37:41 Comment: Ball through the Chiellini defense center.\n37:45 Comment: Chiellini with Bonucci.\n37:48 Comment: Ena list, Juventus is now playing short.\n37:51 Comment: It is missing, although we do not know the destination, obviously, for a team like Sevilla to fall into this group.\n37:58 Comment: Well, if it hunts for third place in the Europa League, this could end in another European title, who knows.\n38:5 Comment: Man, it wouldn't be something that could be ruled out, of course, because he knows the competition perfectly.\n38:14 Comment: Well, let's wait, because it would perhaps be a bit cruel for this Sevilla team that had so many hopes for the Champions League.\n38:24 Comment: But really he was also unlucky with the draw.\n38:27 Comment: Because look at two teams like City and Juventus.\n38:32 Comment: Maybe he got the worst he could get from each bass drum.\n38:35 Comment: Yes Yes Yes.\n38:36 Comment: Keep an eye on the ball into the area, the ball rebounds.\n38:39 Comment: Be careful with the shot, what a spectacular hand now from Jan Sommer.\n38:43 Comment: With the incredible shot, jumping in a prodigious way by Patrice Bra.\n38:48 Comment: First, now, a great opportunity for Juve.\n38:51 Comment: Yes, a Patrice Bra that we are seeing, is joining in very successfully, gaining a baseline.\n38:57 Comment: Even participating in finishing positions.\n39:0 Comment: And here great hand from Jan Sommer.\n39:2 Comment: And great job by Paul Pogba bothering Bra to try and get that ball.\n39:7 Comment: The shot up now by Hernanes.\n39:11 Comment: This is a very different game, since the goal, Juve has gotten to work.\n39:16 Comment: And little by little he has equalized the match until he is superior in these last minutes.\n39:21 Comment: Let's see, because a footballer from the German team took a tremendous blow in that last play.\n39:27 Comment: If it's Kristiansen, no, not Kristiansen, sorry, because Domínguez is standing there.\n39:32 Comment: And clashing with Chiellini is not a dish of good taste.\n39:36 Comment: It is bad business, bad business to collide with Chiellini.\n39:40 Comment: Well, we take advantage of this circumstance to remember one of those stories that we love so much.\n39:44 Comment: In 71 Borussia Mönchengladbach, not here in this stadium because it is quite modern,\n39:49 Comment: in the old Bueckelberg, which was the former home of Mönchengladbach,\n39:55 Comment: he faced Inter, the great Inter of the late 60s, early 70s,\n40:2 Comment: and he scored 7 to 1, but it was of no use, it was in the old European Cup, of course,\n40:7 Comment: but it didn't help because a mentally ill person, a brainless person who was already in the stadiums at that time,\n40:13 Comment: He threw a soda can at Roberto Boniseña and the game was no good.\n40:21 Comment: UEFA invalidated the result and is winning 7 to 1.\n40:25 Comment: I insist, it is a completely closed score to have already sealed the tie in the first leg.\n40:32 Comment: They went to play the match in Milan, the second leg, and they had to play the first leg later in Berlin,\n40:39 Comment: and with such bad luck for the interests of Borussia Mönchengladbach that in the end the one who ended up passing was Inter Milan.\n40:46 Comment: But that 7 to 1 did leave quite a mark because, well, it was a Borussia Mönchengladbach team that in that year 71, I think, had won the second,\n40:54 Comment: but that 7 to 1 did leave quite a mark because, well, it was a Borussia Mönchengladbach team that in that year 71, I think, had won the second,\n40:55 Comment: Bundesliga of its history throughout the 70s, throughout that decade, despite the fact that Bayern Munich won three European Cups,\n41:2 Comment: The dominator in the Bundesliga, the dominator in Germany was this team, it was Borussia Mönchengladbach.\n41:7 Comment: Watch out for Pogba inside the area, the ball into the area, let's see...\n41:10 Comment: The opportunity, Isaac has risked a lot, but he has saved the delicate situation.\n41:16 Comment: Well, and Juventus continues to add arrivals, continues to add opportunities that it has probably already deserved, perhaps,\n41:24 Comment: maybe the tie, the equalizer, because, well, in the offensive phase we are seeing a Borussia Mönchengladbach\n41:32 Comment: that right now he is not able to find his wingmen, he is not able to find passing lines with Rafael, with Stindl,\n41:39 Comment: There we see how they go down to receive, in this case it was Stindl, and we see a much more serious Juve, much more solid, much more effective of course,\n41:50 Comment: in what we have seen at the beginning of the game.\n41:53 Comment: Be careful now Traoré, Traoré near the area, let's see what he decides, the ball is great, the shot goes high.\n41:59 Comment: The opportunity went to Borussia Mönchengladbach's limbo, and about that great story, Aitor, the truth is that you have to be very brainless\n42:6 Comment: to throw a can when your team is beating its rival, I don't justify that if your team is losing you do it, but it is more normal.\n42:14 Comment: Yes, winning 7 to 1.\n42:16 Comment: Why are you angry enough to throw an object at a player?\n42:20 Comment: Yes, also, well, in Germany obviously, in Italy, the party is called the partita de la latina, the party of the can, exactly the same in German as well,\n42:33 Comment: That is to say, it is a match that both football cultures, both in Germany and Italy, remember, and probably people, perhaps not our age,\n42:42 Comment: but yes, a little more experts, so to speak, yes, both in Germany and in Italy, they probably remember, from what I tell you,\n42:49 Comment: because it was a young team, that Borussia Mönchengladbach with Jupp Heynckes, with Bertie Vogt, then obviously Günther Netzer,\n43:0 Comment: important players, but that was still an almost unknown team in Europe, probably in some texts of the time it is said,\n43:10 Comment: Like the Inter players, they even underestimated that unknown Borussia Mönchengladbach a little, they had stayed in Cologne,\n43:18 Comment: simply...\n43:19 Comment: They went to Mönchengladbach for the game, they saw a small field, a rather ugly city as well, and they said, well, we're going to win this easily, well look, they led 7 to 1 in the 28th minute.\n43:29 Comment: Be careful the opportunity for Juventus, goal, what a great goal scored by Stefan Listiner, tremendous return for the Swiss footballer, what a wonderful way to hook that ball with his right leg to send it to the back of the net, great goal from Juventus, the assist already It was good, Listiner turned it into a work of art.\n43:49 Comment: The goal is something very important, the goal, the goal and a great game, but the Swiss player does not know if it is the first half, but I think it is the second half, the goal that was scored for the end of Juventus , now yes, it is the one of this party,\n43:57 Comment: the end of Juventus, but how they came back, how they overcame that Fabian Johnson goal, here Paul Pogba's pass, is a scandal, with the outside of the boot very, very touched so that it falls to the incorporation of Listiner,\n44:11 Comment: The Swiss player, the winger, impales directly, and he impales wonderfully, at the base of the post there is nothing Swiss can do.\n44:17 Comment: pole base, can't do anything\n44:19 Comment: his compatriot Jan Soma\n44:21 Comment: and we said, he was probably\n44:23 Comment: Juventus already deserves the tying goal\n44:26 Comment: has arrived just\n44:28 Comment: before the break\n44:29 Comment: and I think the scoreboard reflects well\n44:31 Comment: what is being an open match\n44:33 Comment: a party with alternate dominance\n44:36 Comment: with chances in both goals\n44:38 Comment: with a Borussia Mönchengladbach that has started\n44:40 Comment: very good, but probably\n44:42 Comment: Now it has deflated and seen how it too\n44:43 Comment: in front, be careful, he had a team\n44:46 Comment: seriously, he had a team of the most important\n44:48 Comment: of Europe, has the current finalist of the\n44:50 Comment: Champions League\n44:50 Comment: and well, maybe maybe\n44:53 Comment: Juve has\n44:56 Comment: overgrown\n44:58 Comment: for which Borussia Mönchengladbach has\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: the German team and there are 45 minutes left for one of the two\n0:4 Comment: achieve your goal at the time of the two are left more or less halfway if\n0:9 Comment: man it is clear that for the bag a lot in the lows\n0:13 Comment: Well, for both of us, victory is very necessary, but for him we will see here.\n0:18 Comment: daud was trying to filter that ball for glasbach really the victory because\n0:23 Comment: It would be the first time to add those three points in this phase of\n0:29 Comment: groups and really finish believing the chances that Cinderella\n0:34 Comment: of this group because it may have possibilities until the end of getting into\n0:39 Comment: In the next phase, the rebounded ball is taken away by doing the\n0:43 Comment: field the German team on the ball for Rafael Rafael wanted to run too much\n0:48

the opportunity for Klappbach,\n8:59 Comment: Let's see, the ball has to go back, it hasn't been good at all, looking for Traoré, as Norveit laments,\n9:5 Comment: who had all the time in the world, could have been a magical minute for the German team,\n9:11 Comment: We see the play as, the feeling is that Hernanes' action is tremendously dangerous,\n9:17 Comment: but I don't know if it was intentional to do harm.\n9:20 Comment: to the footballer of the German team.\n9:22 Comment: There's Dahoud, the shot above,\n9:25 Comment: well, complicated minutes now for Juve as they reorganize all this.\n9:29 Comment: Yes, we must effectively manage this absence of López, who was acting a little behind the\n9:35 Comment: of the two forwards, especially when Juve was in possession of the ball,\n9:39 Comment: Then he was also capable of inserting himself into the line of four in the center of the field without the ball,\n9:46 Comment: and we see how Álvaro Domínguez, well, fortunately,\n9:49 Comment: fully recovered from that split ball.\n9:51 Comment: I think that from the point of view of the referee, from the point of view of Bjorn Kuipers' referee,\n9:58 Comment: From the perspective he had, I think that above all he saw were Hernanes' two legs spread out.\n10:4 Comment: and a divided ball too tight to go, to attack it with the way Hernanes has done it.\n10:13 Comment: It is true that it does not have an impact, but it is also true that many times you not only have to assess whether there is an impact or not,\n10:19 Comment: but also the way in which you arrive, the intention.\n10:24 Comment: I do not appreciate intentionality on the part of Hernanes, but perhaps Kuipers has seen it from his position\n10:32 Comment: and in any case a red card that will also add more epicness to Juve's game.\n10:39 Comment: And Marquisio also saw the admonition.\n10:43 Comment: The German team tries it.\n10:44 Comment: The truth is that the outlook for them now is wonderful, it is now or never.\n10:47 Comment: They have to show victory.\n10:48 Comment: As they say, it's now or never. They have to show victory as they say.\n10:49 Comment: And the fans know it, they are cheering like never before.\n10:58 Comment: Juve seemed to have the match in their hands to seal their passage to the next round.\n11:2 Comment: Sometimes there are things that are beyond anyone's control.\n11:6 Comment: Let's see, Norveit takes the shot, the ball rebounds.\n11:8 Comment: Be careful, opportunity saves Juve.\n11:11 Comment: The Italian footballers are calling for offside.\n11:14 Comment: 56 minutes. There is the issue that is burning right now in Borussia Park.\n11:18 Comment: As we remember, the next matchday for Monche Klapach will be in this stadium against Sevilla.\n11:25 Comment: He will close the matter in Manchester.\n11:27 Comment: While Juve will play the next game at home against a City that could already be qualified.\n11:37 Comment: Still, playing like no other in that first place in the group.\n11:42 Comment: There goes Traore, the ball bounces.\n11:45 Comment: Rafael split leather wins.\n11:47 Comment: Rafael who loses.\n11:48 Comment: Morata, Morata looks for the counterattack.\n11:50 Comment: There's Morata.\n11:51 Comment: The ball goes to Polpock.\n11:52 Comment: The rebounded ball is going to go to the Madrid striker again.\n11:56 Comment: At the end of the moment, the one who is being key for the Madrid team in this match is Álvaro Domínguez, who has forced that expulsion.\n12:3 Comment: Yes, we have seen Morata participate perhaps less than expected.\n12:8 Comment: But it is also true that his movements are the ones that, along with Dybala's, are the ones that generate the gaps in many cases.\n12:15 Comment: The appearances of second-line men.\n12:18 Comment: As we have already mentioned, especially Polpock goes.\n12:21 Comment: The now absent Hernánez.\n12:25 Comment: Even the arrivals from the sides.\n12:29 Comment: Almost 60 minutes.\n12:31 Comment: The ball for Dahoud.\n12:32 Comment: If this ends like this, what a match we will have in this stadium against Sevilla to try to secure that Europa League place first.\n12:39 Comment: And then, why not, continue with some option.\n12:43 Comment: Christensen.\n12:44 Comment: Ball down the side.\n12:45 Comment: That shipment for Huenta was very long.\n12:46 Comment: In the end the Swede rectifies his position.\n12:48 Comment: Look for one against one.\n12:50 Comment: Impossible to surpass Estefanos Turaro now.\n12:53 Comment: Specialist in defensive facet.\n12:55 Comment: The former Genua.\n12:57 Comment: Beware of Dahoud.\n12:58 Comment: Dahoud the shot.\n12:59 Comment: Out.\n13:0 Comment: He was encouraged there, but he was not as fine as in the first half with that ball that hit the crossbar.\n13:5 Comment: Yes, he has also had another one before.\n13:6 Comment: Here we see if the ball ends up coming out or not.\n13:9 Comment: It seems like not completely.\n13:12 Comment: Here we are going to see it repeated in that action that Estefanos Turaro seemed to have done quite well.\n13:18 Comment: Quite controlled against Oscar Bent.\n13:22 Comment: The Swedish full-back of Borussia Mönchengladbach.\n13:24 Comment: And then, as you said, the shot of a...\n13:29 Comment: Again the actions back.\n13:31 Comment: Once again playing with fire by Borussia Mönchengladbach.\n13:35 Comment: Mahmoud Dahoud's shot that already had a pretty clear shot.\n13:38 Comment: He hit the crossbar in the first half and now in the second he also has two mid-range shots.\n13:44 Comment: We see that pattern repeated also by Gladbach.\n13:47 Comment: Looking for Borussia Mönchengladbach's hit.\n13:48 Comment: The beating of Borussia Mönchengladbach.\n13:48 Comment: And the beating of Borussia Mönchengladbach.\n13:48 Comment: On the part of Dahoud and Granit Xhaka, their two pivots.\n13:52 Comment: While Morata to his.\n13:53 Comment: Try to do the individual action because right now you are quite alone.\n13:56 Comment: Well, it has extracted oil.\n13:58 Comment: He has brought out something very positive.\n14:0 Comment: Out of nowhere, that foul on the edge of the area.\n14:3 Comment: And look who had to do it.\n14:5 Comment: Rafael, who is the other...\n14:7 Comment: The attacker on the other side who had to come and help the center back here, Christensen.\n14:12 Comment: A Morata who gives the impression that since Hernández has not been there, he has also had to take a bit of responsibility\n14:16 Comment: to lock, to connect.\n14:18 Comment: to act as a link\n14:19 Comment: with the center of the field\n14:21 Comment: of Juventus\n14:23 Comment: almost 60\n14:26 Comment: the opportunity for the Vecchia Signora\n14:28 Comment: with Paul Pogba at the launch\n14:29 Comment: Obviously anything can happen here\n14:31 Comment: Pirlo is no longer there, but alternatives\n14:34 Comment: Pogba has plenty of shots\n14:36 Comment: different from that of the Italian genius\n14:38 Comment: More powerful\n14:40 Comment: perhaps less specialist\n14:41 Comment: when it comes to overcoming the barrier and the ball goes down\n14:43 Comment: there goes Pogba, Pogba's shot\n14:46 Comment: very good\n14:46 Comment: to the side of the net\n14:49 Comment: almost some fans had already been heard\n14:52 Comment:

been more than one and more than two\n15:2 Comment: in the stadium and we see precisely the curve\n15:4 Comment: or the piece of bleacher\n15:6 Comment: in which the thousands are located\n15:8 Comment: of Juventine fans from Tifosi\n15:10 Comment: that\n15:11 Comment: I suppose they will be the ones who have sung clearly\n15:13 Comment: the no goal\n15:15 Comment: of\n15:16 Comment: by Paul

Mönchengladbach clears without too many complications\n15:30 Comment: leather for Buffon\n15:33 Comment: It's not going to rebuild anything.\n15:35 Comment: Allegri because he has obviously lost one of the attacking men\n15:39 Comment: although he is already prepared to enter Cuadrado\n15:42 Comment: If we have seen Cuadrado warm up at half-time too\n15:46 Comment: because it leads to

how to stop this, they knew how to equalize the match again\n16:59 Comment: The change is the following, Dybala goes from the field to the game\n17:1 Comment: It has been his last act of service, Juan

appeared and now we see how the one who has the ball is Rafael, that is, the players.\n20:28 Comment: who have to be in finishing positions and who appear to try to move a little\n20:34 Comment: The center backs appear between the lines to look for passing lines and drag them with their\n20:39 Comment: movement obviously to the men of the defense to open holes in a rearguard\n20:46 Comment: very populated as Juventina is and the Germans Christensen continue working on it\n20:53 Comment: but everything for Norbert in that almost Scandinavian defense with the exception of Domínguez from Madrid, keep an eye on the shot.\n21:4 Comment: had touched on a man the mammoth shot at the jester's hands if it were not the best shot with the\n21:10 Comment: Certainly daud is right-handed and hits here

For example, they have Joseph Termitz, who when attacking such a closed-in defense is perhaps the best idea. Well, To begin with, it is something that right now Monchengladbach does not have on the field of play, which is a reference forward.\n27:0 Comment: and\n27:1 Comment: It is also true that with such a well-populated defense, the appearance of them and\n27:9 Comment: termites would also look for a more direct, more vertical game cut also maybe look for the action\n27:17 Comment: aerial you also have a footballer like Jorgen Hazard, Eden's brother, who a little bit, well\n27:24 Comment: I would qualify this commitment to vertical play with a touch player with a lot of overflow on arrival\n27:30 Comment: also good you have you have men it is not clear what man by man what player by player is\n27:37 Comment: Obviously Juventus is clearly superior but for now today and it was also seen in the game\n27:42 Comment: of the juventus stadium the bolusio monchengladbach is knowing how to compete in this group stage of the\n27:48 Comment: champions league despite having started the season so badly and there doesn't seem to be that much difference\n27:53 Comment: between juve and clavaje on the field of play there it is take out combine with sunday\n28:0 Comment: with Micamar and ball to the left hanАvşar b经 and that is what they have been the\n28:7 Comment: há minuscule lack of trap and aa maritan inn and Schalkeonet Stockholm Rataszkiewski\n28:14 Comment: many of the this is the most Yankee club and to which lacida ir brutta was played that\n28:21 Comment: cared for with the vibrant peroavesa like the Rybo noaiah background but defense I do not come only premium\n28:25 Comment: anguished video and may jours Mahaha bad see white babe엽 brings a punt inция ac fera gets hammer\n28:26 Comment: all the goal zalacher ya lui fl לח\n28:29 Comment: veiled\n28:30 Comment: friend anh joke in the end it will be a square throw-in he is helping a lot to alistair in this band\n28:30 Comment: right.\n28:33 Comment: Yes, it is important, of course,\n28:35 Comment: to avoid those actions\n28:36 Comment: of numerical superiority.\n28:39 Comment: We constantly see what we have\n28:40 Comment: also noted before, right?\n28:42 Comment: As Rafael and Lars Stindel appear\n28:44 Comment: constantly leaving the area\n28:46 Comment: trying to drag your brand too\n28:48 Comment: but above all to participate in the\n28:50 Comment: action, but immediately\n28:52 Comment: when\n28:53 Comment: make a couple\n28:56 Comment: of touches, a combination on that front\n28:59 Comment: from the area, they come back again, they come back again.\n29:1 Comment: That is, practically a double job, right?\n29:2 Comment: To participate in the pregnancy\n29:5 Comment: of the play and also of trying\n29:6 Comment: to be present at the completion.\n29:8 Comment: And this is more than\n29:10 Comment: never a declaration of intent.\n29:13 Comment: Álvaro Morata leaves\n29:14 Comment: of the playing field.

Although we see that\n30:36 Comment: The Italian team also allows itself the luxury\n30:38 Comment: even pressing the outlet a little\n30:40 Comment: German ball.\n30:44 Comment: Let's go to Esturaro like\n30:46 Comment: first line of pressure together with Marquisio\n30:48 Comment: and Paul Pogba. And appears\n30:50 Comment: Listaina. Let's see how\n30:52 Comment: places the defense of\n30:54 Comment: three centrals with Chiellini, Bonucci,\n30:56 Comment: Barzagli and two wingers, Ebrard,\n30:58 Comment: Alistainer, who are going to be more than wingers\n31:0 Comment: sides.\n31:2 Comment: The ball for\n31:3 Comment: Monche Gladbach.\n31:7 Comment: Thinking Maximiliano Alegri,\n31:9 Comment: surely what you have not been able to\n31:10 Comment: win don't lose it.\n31:12 Comment: And even less in a group stage of the Champions League\n31:14 Comment: because in the end if you lose you give\n31:16 Comment: two life points to a direct rival.\n31:21 Comment: Saka.\n31:24 Comment: Yes, what ever\n31:24 Comment: you can't know either\n31:27 Comment: It is indeed what you have not gained, do not lose it,\n31:28 Comment: but what you haven't\n31:29 Comment: cattle you are also giving up\n31:33 Comment: maybe that's how to win it.\n31:35 Comment: Be careful with that ball into the area.\n31:37 Comment: Saka Buffon.\n31:38 Comment: Saka Buffon. What a save by the Italian guard.\n31:41 Comment: Bonucci had it with Monche Gladbach.\n31:44 Comment: It remains one of the\n31:45 Comment: great goalkeepers in the world. Gigi Buffon.\n31:48 Comment: The ball into the area. Clear\n31:49 Comment: now Chiellini. That is, this action\n31:51 Comment: for example that Lars Stindel has had in his\n31:53 Comment: front and probably\n31:55 Comment: if it had been\n31:56 Comment: another the archer,\n31:58 Comment: under the Juve sticks.\n32:1 Comment: Well, maybe I would have gone inside.\n32:3 Comment: I insist, the fact of strengthening yourself does not guarantee you at all\n32:7 Comment: and to shield yourself with so many offensive players\n32:9 Comment: so that this doesn't happen, right?\n32:11 Comment: That in the end there is a gap, a hole in the center of your defense\n32:15 Comment: and a player like Stindel appears, presents his forehead\n32:19 Comment: and see what reflexes the hand ball goalkeeper practically\n32:21 Comment: with the left foot.\n32:23 Comment: Gigi Buffon to avoid a goal that would make it very difficult for her\n32:28 Comment: the game against Juve.\n32:30 Comment: 77 minutes. What a moment we have had at Borussia Park\n32:35 Comment: with that intervention by one of the best goalkeepers in\n32:39 Comment: the last decade and the last almost 20 years\n32:42 Comment: in European football.\n32:44 Comment: Now Ebra, who has remained\n32:47 Comment: tremendously sore after that last play\n32:50 Comment: about 80% of the match.\n32:53 Comment: Juve has been saved\n32:55 Comment: that in the attempt to protect that point has been close,\n32:58 Comment: but worth the redundancy of losing all three.\n33:1 Comment: Knee now quite clear on Patrice Ebra's face.\n33:8 Comment: Although there is the tremendous nobility of Patrice Ebra\n33:20 Comment: saying nothing's wrong, I'm fine.\n33:22 Comment: 78 match. Borussia Mönchengladbach has less and less life left,\n33:25 Comment: that if we don't win the game, the game of the week,\n33:26 Comment: It is a game that has to be very difficult.\n33:28 Comment: And the game of the week this match\n33:30 Comment: would be virtually eliminated.\n33:32 Comment: Six points below Juve,\n33:34 Comment: seven below Manchester City.\n33:36 Comment: And Andrés Schubert who is currently going to reach the 80th minute\n33:41 Comment: without having introduced any freshmen to his team.\n33:44 Comment: It's also surprising.\n33:46 Comment: I don't know if he trusts a lot in this eleven,\n33:49 Comment: which really is practically the eleven that has been repeating\n33:52 Comment: since he's been a coach, right?\n33:54 Comment: With Ibrahima Traore and Fabian Johnson on the wing,\n33:57 Comment: Rafael Yestin de la Riva, the double pivot formed by Granit Xhaka\n34:1 Comment: and Mahmet Daoud.\n34:3 Comment: Well, there it is.\n34:5 Comment: Watch that inside ball now for Ben.\n34:7 Comment: Bonucci goes, the crossing, perfect.\n34:9 Comment: Well, to talk about Gladbach's losses we have to take into account\n34:12 Comment: that there is one less footballer than usual on the bench.\n34:16 Comment: Yes effectively.\n34:17 Comment: Yes, yes, it is another of the factors that tell us to what extent\n34:21 Comment: Schubert's thing has merit, this Borussia Mönchengladbach thing has merit,\n34:26 Comment: because he is missing André Hahn, who was a footballer who did start\n34:29 Comment: with Schubert also to see the door and to have importance,\n34:33 Comment: but he suffered a very hard, terrible foul on the part of Johannes Geis,\n34:38 Comment: Schalke 04 midfielder in the league match\n34:45 Comment: and well, he fractured the upper part of his tibia.\n34:49 Comment: We have already mentioned Patrick Herrmann, Nico Schulz, the center back,\n34:53 Comment: He also cannot participate due to lack of time.\n34:56 Comment: Due to a knee injury.\n34:58 Comment: Stranzel I think it is an injury to the bone of the eye orbit\n35:3 Comment: and then the two right backs, Janske and Korb, both also absent due to injury.\n35:7 Comment: Korb was in doubt, in the end he did not make it to this match,\n35:10 Comment: That's why we are seeing Havard Northwight, the Norwegian midfielder,\n35:14 Comment: having to act as a lane on that right side.\n35:17 Comment: Leather for Paul Pogba, try something frivolous again,\n35:22 Comment: In the end he ends up losing, he keeps pushing, however, it rains,\n35:25 Comment: but nothing happens.\n35:26 Comment: The ball on the right, good start from the Germans.\n35:29 Comment: They have 10 minutes to show that they can stay alive in the competition.\n35:36 Comment: Midfielder Mahmoud Ahou plays.\n35:40 Comment: At his side Rafael.\n35:42 Comment: Let's see, Rafael, Rafael, the inside ball is good.\n35:44 Comment: Be careful, let's see, Rafael, the divided ball, is finally taken by the Juve defense.\n35:49 Comment: There was a blow, they were timidly asking for a penalty\n35:53 Comment: when Paul Pogba throws the ball out for attention.\n35:55 Comment: Borussia Monchengladbach striker Lars Stindel.\n36:1 Comment: Yes, well, Rafael's filtered ball is fantastic.\n36:5 Comment: I don't know, I can't assess whether there really was a punishable action on the part of Chiellini.\n36:16 Comment: I insist, Rafael, we have already mentioned it, he is a player who, as a second striker,\n36:22 Comment: as a ball feeder for the team, for the Juve team,\n36:24 Comment: For a striker it is a real gift.\n36:27 Comment: Here at Gladbach he is having to do a bit of the double function of nourishing and finishing.\n36:33 Comment: He has five goals, he is the team's top scorer.\n36:36 Comment: But I insist that, for example, on the bench they have a player like Josip Dirmic,\n36:41 Comment: who arrived in the summer from Bayer Leverkusen, cost 10 million euros,\n36:44 Comment: which is a fairly important outlay for a team like Gladbach,\n36:46 Comment: which it does not have, because perhaps they do not have the economic power that, without going any further,\n36:52 Comment: Bayer Leverkusen itself.\n36:54 Comment: Bayer Leverkusen itself does have, because it has a large company behind it,\n36:57 Comment: or also in the case of Wolfsburg exactly the same,\n37:0 Comment: or Borussia Dortmund and Bayern for obvious reasons.\n37:4 Comment: It is not at that same level, at that same degree of economic capacity.\n37:11 Comment: And well, a significant outlay was made for Dirmic, it is not participating.\n37:15 Comment: But of course, who tells Andrés Schubert anything after the numbers he is achieving in this,\n37:22 Comment: Is this your first experience with Borussia Mönchengladbach?\n37:25 Comment: Of course I don't dare question any of their decisions, far from it.\n37:30 Comment: There's Sommer.\n37:32 Comment: Ball for Christensen, 82 minutes into the game.\n37:36 Comment: Álvaro Domínguez is in a rush for the German team.\n37:39 Comment: Juve is paying him with the same currency that Gladbach used in Turin.\n37:43 Comment: A very, very defensive approach.\n37:46 Comment: Although obviously now Juve says they have an excuse because they have a player sent off, Hernanes.\n37:52 Comment: Thorgan Hazard is going to join Borussia Mönchengladbach.\n37:56 Comment: Play Stindel.\n37:59 Comment: There Oscar Bent is asking for the ball.\n38:4 Comment: Play through the center of the field.\n38:6 Comment: Rafael falls asleep.\n38:8 Comment: Rafael finally finds the pass.\n38:10 Comment: Oscar Bent, the fumble.\n38:12 Comment: Right now Paul Pogba is taking it, who is looking for the counterattack.\n38:14 Comment: Juan Cuadrado is moving now.\n38:16 Comment: Pogba has to try individually because he was more alone than ever.\n38:19 Comment: Now he ends up losing, but perhaps he had no other choice but to try.\n38:21 Comment: The French footballer ends up slipping in his impulsive action to recover his position.\n38:28 Comment: Let's see, they go to the right.\n38:30 Comment: The center to the area.\n38:31 Comment: There is absolutely no one, although they have not notified the Juventino defender either.\n38:35 Comment: To Barçagli.\n38:37 Comment: There's Xhaka.\n38:40 Comment: Xhaka with Bent.\n38:41 Comment: The ball into the area.\n38:43 Comment: It is now impossible to penetrate that defense with Chiellini, Bonucci and Barçagli.\n38:47 Comment: They don't even come in there with a tank.\n38:49 Comment: No.\n38:50 Comment: If we already said that in the aerial game the Piedmontese team was clearly superior,\n38:57 Comment: Now that Barçagli has appeared, even more so.\n39:1 Comment: Furthermore, compared to men like Rafael or Lars Stindel, who are not particularly tall either.\n39:9 Comment: Ibrahim Atahore, for example, 1.72 m.\n39:11 Comment: Raphael, 1.74 m.\n39:13 Comment: Lars Stindel, 1.80 m.\n39:15 Comment: They would not stand out in that facet of the offensive game either.\n39:20 Comment: Authorize the change right now.\n39:22 Comment: Lars Stindel leaves the field of play.\n39:24 Comment: No, it is Fabian Jonsson in the end who retires, the scorer of the goal.\n39:28 Comment: This man who gave so much hope to his people is going to take his place right now.\n39:33 Comment: Thorgan Hazard in the first substitution for the Germans.\n39:36 Comment: Yes, in my opinion it changed a little too late perhaps.\n39:41 Comment: But hey, Thorgan Hazard will still have a short, scarce time to be able to show what he has.\n39:48 Comment: Demonstrate that he also has a place in the starting eleven.\n39:52 Comment: Although I insist that the starting eleven, the eleven that Andrés Schubert has in mind and with which he gives the impression that he has got it right, has certainly been the one he presented today.\n40:3 Comment: Last five minutes.\n40:6 Comment: Ball for Juve.\n40:7 Comment: Patrice Lebrun will take the throw from the throw-in.\n40:9 Comment: Look for Juan Cuadrado.\n40:11 Comment: Esturaro also moves.\n40:12 Comment: There is no passing line.\n40:13 Comment: Now the Colombian finally receives the team surrounded by four Gladbach players.\n40:17 Comment: The hot potato is passed on to the Juve footballers.\n40:19 Comment: In the end it seemed obvious that they were going to lose the ball.\n40:22 Comment: And Brahim Atroave who ends up winning the throw-in.\n40:26 Comment: While Juve obviously still has the alternative of making one more change to lose a little time.\n40:34 Comment: At least slow down the pace of the Germans.\n40:36 Comment: Although at the moment we see a team with spectacular craftsmanship.\n40:39 Comment: Juve is not suffering at all to maintain that 1-1 draw.\n40:43 Comment: We only remember the opportunity that ended with Buffon sending the ball to Atlético de Madrid.\n40:47 Comment: A corner.\n40:48 Comment: Only one in almost half an hour of absolute dominance.\n40:51 Comment: Saka plays on the right side.\n40:55 Comment: There goes the German team.\n40:57 Comment: Dahoud can take the shot.\n40:59 Comment: The shot hits a Juve footballer.\n41:1 Comment: It will be a corner kick.\n41:3 Comment: There is absolutely no nerve in Juve's defense.\n41:7 Comment: And Dahoud who was puffing after yet another shot with his left foot.\n41:15 Comment: Well, it's an alternative too.\n41:17 Comment: He's been searching actually.\n41:19 Comment: It is not an alternative that I have now.\n41:21 Comment: He has been constantly looking for the Gladbach, the mid-range shot.\n41:23 Comment: And look, Aitor, the desperation of the Germans who have given up on taking the long corner and have sought to start the play again.\n41:30 Comment: Yes Yes Yes.\n41:31 Comment: Because they are aware, as we said, that from the point of view of the aerial game there is a clear difference with respect to Juventus and especially with respect to Juventus' defense.\n41:42 Comment: And change in the Vecchia.\n41:44 Comment: Madam, the third is leaving the field for the game.\n41:46 Comment: Estefano Sturaro enters a footballer like Mario Lemina, the 22-year-old French player.\n41:53 Comment: Another of the new faces this season in the European runners-up.\n42:2 Comment: Player with a look tremendously similar to that of Paul Pogba.\n42:8 Comment: There we see the two of them in the center of the field.\n42:11 Comment: Pogba cuts back, looks to eliminate the ball inside the area.\n42:15 Comment: He is the only finisher right now.\n42:17 Comment: Pogba trying to win the throw-in.\n42:20 Comment: In the end he doesn't succeed, but it is incredible that in this 87th minute he can continue making those types of individual plays.\n42:26 Comment: Incredible physique of the French footballer.\n42:32 Comment: Sommer now does not see himself so pursued by Juve's forwards.\n42:36 Comment: Domínguez plays.\n42:38 Comment: Domínguez again with his goalkeeper, Jan Sommer.\n42:40 Comment: 87 minutes. If this ends like this, the Gladbach fans are going to leave.\n42:44 Comment: With tremendous disappointment.\n42:50 Comment: Saka has to look to the side.\n42:53 Comment: To Christensen.\n42:56 Comment: Saka asks for the ball again.\n42:57 Comment: The ball on the right.\n43:0 Comment: Impossible to continue moving forward.\n43:1 Comment: There we see how Juve's two lines are tilting towards where the ball goes.\n43:5 Comment: This seems practically automated and there is not a single defensive error.\n43:10 Comment: Yes, it's also interesting how Lickstein has been at the center.\n43:14 Comment: He oscillates between a more advanced position, almost like a winger.\n43:19 Comment: When Gladbach really gets very close to the mediations of the area.\n43:24 Comment: Then he gets in as fifth.\n43:26 Comment: Keep an eye on the ball hitting the crossbar. Now is the opportunity for Gladbach.\n43:29 Comment: Well, it seems that Gigi Buffon has come to attack.\n43:32 Comment: Another spectacular stop. The second in this match for the Italian.\n43:36 Comment: What a shot from Hazard.\n43:38 Comment: Center to the area.\n43:40 Comment: Watch out for Domínguez. Now the finishing touch.\n43:42 Comment: Save Chiellini.\n43:44 Comment: Well, this is Juve, this is the epic.\n43:46 Comment: What a way to defend everyone together.\n43:48 Comment: Yes Yes Yes.\n43:50 Comment: He said that Lickstein comes in as the fifth defenseman.\n43:54 Comment: Clearly to draw that line of five.\n43:58 Comment: And here we see after the action that it does seem that Thorgan Hazard was ahead.\n44:6 Comment: Which he had previously shot.\n44:8 Comment: And I don't know if it hits and therefore participates directly.\n44:12 Comment: In getting that ball out of Gigi Buffon's goal path.\n44:16 Comment: What is clear is that it hits the crossbar.\n44:18 Comment: Second crossbar that Gladbach has encountered tonight.\n44:22 Comment: Ball through the center. There goes Dahoud.\n44:25 Comment: Be careful, the German team is angry.\n44:27 Comment: There goes Stindel now.\n44:29 Comment: Cut out Stindel. Inside ball.\n44:31 Comment: Clear Lemina.\n44:33 Comment: Paul Pogba now appears to send the leather directly to Jan Sommer's domain.\n44:37 Comment: Now Juve is suffering.\n44:39 Comment: But it was predictable, obviously, against a Juve team.\n44:42 Comment: That he is capable of scoring as many goals in the last two months as Borussia Mönchengladbach.\n44:46 Comment: Xhaka looks for the right side.\n44:51 Comment: The ball for Thorgan Hazard.

    "summary": "On a chilly evening in Germany, Borussia Monchengladbach went head-to-head with Juventus at Borussia Park in a Champions League clash that would turn out to be highly competitive and intensely fought from start to finish. The match ended in a 1-1 draw, but the story that unfolded over the 90 minutes plus stoppage time was a tale of twists, turns, and pulsating football that had the fans on the edge of their seats.\n\nFrom the get-go, the anticipation in the air was palpable. Stephan Lichtsteiner's return to the field after a cardiac operation added an emotional layer to the match. Juventus, in an unusual kit, seemed slightly disjointed at the start, losing the ball early in the game, while Borussia Monchengladbach displayed immediate aggression, putting pressure on their Italian opponents from the first whistle.\n\nMonchengladbach, under the interim stewardship of André Schubert, came into the game with a point to prove. Schubert, a man of significant conversation in German football circles for his unexpected rise to the coaching ranks, had led his team to five consecutive Bundesliga victories. However, despite these successes, he remained an interim coach, with the board seemingly waiting to see how he would handle adversity before making a permanent decision. His players, however, clearly believed in him, and it showed in their early play as they sought to impose themselves on the game.\n\nThe German side's early dominance almost paid off when Juve's Patrice Evra found himself with a shooting opportunity inside the box, but his effort was not converted. Juve, anchoring their play through Argentine sensation Paulo Dybala and the mobile Álvaro Morata, then began to find their rhythm. The pair brought elegance and mobility to Juve's attacking play, constantly seeking to create chances and penetrate the Monchengladbach rearguard. Behind them, Paul Pogba was starting to showcase the combination of power and finesse that had made him one of European football's most coveted talents.\n\nDespite their increasing presence, Juve's early efforts to find a breakthrough were met by steadfast defending from Monchengladbach. The German side, known for their defensive discipline, held their lines well, intercepting passes, and squeezing spaces through the central areas. Meanwhile, on the rare occasion when the ball was lost, the swift Ibrahima Traoré and the energetic Dahoud were quick to drive forward, testing Juve's defensive shape and Gianluigi Buffon's alertness in goal.\n\nBorussia continued to push, and their persistence bore fruit in the 19th minute. Oscar Wendt's ball over from the left created chaos in the Juve defense. There was a miscommunication, and as the ball fell kindly to Rafael, he unselfishly played it across to his teammate Fabian Johnson. Johnson made no mistake, firing a well-placed shot past Buffon and into the back of the net, sending the home crowd into ecstasy and putting Monchengladbach ahead.\n\nFor Juve, the concession of the goal was a wake-up call. They ramped up their efforts, bringing more intensity to their play. Pogba, in particular, began to exert his influence more assertively, driving his team forward with his commanding presence. His efforts paid off just as the first half was drawing to a close. In a move that epitomized Juventus' resilience and quality, Pogba delivered an exquisite outside-of-the-boot pass into the path of Lichtsteiner. The Swiss fullback struck it first time, his shot curling beautifully into the net, evading the dive of his compatriot, Jan Sommer. It was a goal of immense beauty and technical precision, marking Lichtsteiner's triumphant return and leveling the score at a crucial juncture.\n\nThe equalizer set the stage for a tantalizing second half, where Juventus had to navigate 45 minutes with only 10 men after Hernanes received a straight red card in the 53rd minute. The Brazilian midfielder was adjudged to have made a dangerous tackle on Álvaro Domínguez, leaving Juve with a numerical disadvantage. The match dynamic shifted instantly, as Monchengladbach sought to capitalize on their one-man advantage.\n\nUrged on by their animated supporters, the German side launched wave after wave of attacks. Dahoud, Xhaka, and Rafael kept Buffon busy with several long-range shots and quick counter-attacks. However, Juventus, embodying the Italian defensive traditions, stood firm. Bonucci, Chiellini, and the recently introduced Barzagli marshaled the backline with characteristic solidity, while Buffon rolled back the years with some crucial saves, evoking memories of his prime.\n\nPaul Pogba, despite the reduced numbers, continued to be the heartbeat of Juventus' midfield. The Frenchman, with his combination of elegance and grit, carried significant responsibility, winning tackles, breaking up play, and driving forward with the ball at his feet. His individual brilliance offered Juventus the occasional respite and a chance to regroup amid the German onslaught.\n\nAs the match wore on, the tension mounted. Monchengladbach, despite their numerical advantage, struggled to breach the Juventus defensive wall. The Italians, experienced campaigners in European football, deployed all their tactical nous to frustrate their opponents and nullify their attacking threat. Time and again, Xhaka and Dahoud tried their luck from distance, only to be thwarted by Juventus' resolute defending or Buffon's safe hands.\n\nMonchengladbach coach André Schubert threw on Thorgan Hazard late in the game, hoping for a moment of magic from the Belgian. Hazard added some fresh impetus and dynamism to their attacks, and it almost paid off. In the final few minutes, a Hazard shot cannoned off the crossbar, with Buffon pulling off an outstanding save on the follow-up to deny Stindel. It was a moment that could have swung the match decidedly in the German team's favor, but Juventus' defensive resilience held firm.\n\nIn the dying moments, as Monchengladbach threw everything forward in search of a winner, Juventus dug deep, showing monumental collective effort to secure a point. They survived the late flurry of attacks and held on to a 1-1 draw, putting them within touching distance of qualification for the next round. For Monchengladbach, the draw felt more like a loss, knowing they had missed a golden opportunity to claim all three points against the group heavyweights.\n\nThe final whistle brought an end to an enthralling contest, leaving both teams to reflect on what was a night of high drama. Juventus, with their seasoned campaigners and defensive masterclass, managed to snatch a vital point away from home, showing why they remain one of Europe's elite. Monchengladbach, on the other hand, demonstrated commendable fighting spirit and tactical discipline, but lacked the clinical edge needed to claim victory and keep their hopes of advancing alive.\n\nIn conclusion, this 1-1 draw was a testament to the unpredictable and thrilling nature of the Champions League. It showcased the resilience of Juventus, even when down to ten men, and the potential of Borussia Monchengladbach under the interim guidance of André Schubert. It was a match filled with passion, skill, and dramatic twists, making it a memorable night for all those who witnessed it."
