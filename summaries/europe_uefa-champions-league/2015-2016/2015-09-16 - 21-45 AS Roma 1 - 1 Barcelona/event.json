The pressure finally paid off for Barcelona when they penetrated AS Roma's defense with a spectacular shot on target at 16:57, forcing the ball out, just a precursor to their ensuing goal.\n\n**20:00-30:00**\n\nBarcelona’s persistence bore fruit as they got another shot on goal at 20:21, and they succeeded in drawing first blood with a masterful goal. The AS Roma players were visibly shaken but determined to bounce back. They resumed the game with kickoff at 21:59, pushing higher up the pitch.\n\nAS Roma started to push back more determinedly. After a series of clearances and defensive maneuvers by both teams, Barcelona earned a corner at 25:50. Their subsequent plays, however, couldn't break the AS Roma defense again.

Barcelona then shot off target at 44:29, concluding a half defined by precise defending and moments of brilliant attack from both teams. The first 45 minutes ended with AS Roma and Barcelona locked at 1-1.\n\n### Second Half\n\n**45:00-55:00**\n\nThe second half kicked off with Barcelona in possession, looking eager to regain their lead.

The next few minutes were packed with dynamic play. Barcelona's attack faced resilience as AS Roma's defense held strong.

A yellow card awarded to Barcelona at 29:33 highlighted the defensive rigour both teams adopted to keep their goal intact. Each team's defenses were prominent even as they sought that elusive match-winning goal. Barcelona continued to pile on the pressure with corners resulting in off-target shots at 32:08.\n\n**85:00-90:00**\n\nThe final minutes were gripping.
