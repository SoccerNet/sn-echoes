    "input": "\n    Manchester United 1 - 0 CSKA\n\nFirst Half:\n\n0:0 Comment: expecting a little bit of pressure in this game\n0:30 Comment: and that pulled thigh muscle that caused him to go off at the weekend\n0:34 Comment: and means he's only a sub tonight\n0:36 Comment: he's a big plus for Manchester United going into this one\n0:39 Comment: well he's got a phenomenal goal scoring record in the Champions League\n0:42 Comment: and I must admit having watched him in the first game in Moscow\n0:45 Comment: I thought two players really stood out\n0:47 Comment: it was him, N'Gombia and also the right back Fernandes\n0:51 Comment: now Fernandes will bomb forward\n0:52 Comment: he does give you a chance going the other way though\n0:54 Comment: so it'll be interesting to see how aggressive he is going forward\n0:57 Comment: now he's playing at Old Trafford\n0:59 Comment: significantly Marcus Rojo who has taken off in Moscow\n1:2 Comment: who really struggled particularly first half against Fernandes\n1:5 Comment: he's starting again at left back tonight\n1:7 Comment: six on the trot now in terms of starts for the Argentine\n1:11 Comment: here's Shenikov playing it forward to one of the players who's come in tonight\n1:17 Comment: Milanov, there is Louis van Gaal\n1:20 Comment: who admitted after the draw at Palace on Saturday\n1:22 Comment: that he's still trying to find the right blend and balance for his front players\n1:26 Comment: seems to be trying to work out\n1:28 Comment: whether to go for the ball or not\n1:29 Comment: to play Martial off the left or through the middle\n1:31 Comment: Martial has started off tonight\n1:33 Comment: in a more central role it would appear\n1:36 Comment: here's Shenikov the left back\n1:40 Comment: who we saw in the first game will get forward when he can\n1:43 Comment: Zagoev is looking to play it through towards Moussa\n1:46 Comment: and Chris Smalling back there\n1:49 Comment: to tidy things up for Manchester United\n1:51 Comment: and Slotty though from David De Gea\n1:54 Comment: yeah not like him he's normally brilliant with his feet\n1:57 Comment: David De Gea the modern\n1:58 Comment: goalkeeper got to be good with your feet\n2:0 Comment: especially in a team like Manchester United that like to play out from the back\n2:3 Comment: just struggling to see what the Manchester United front line is here\n2:7 Comment: Martial is playing well he's playing quite far forward\n2:10 Comment: and quite central as you mentioned\n2:12 Comment: so is Wayne Rooney though\n2:13 Comment: Mata is actually on the right hand side with\n2:15 Comment: Lingard on the left\n2:17 Comment: so it's almost looking like a 4-4-2 formation at the moment\n2:28 Comment: and it's a game for the advance game\n2:34 Comment: as CSKA is certainly the form team coming into tonight's game\n2:38 Comment: one defeated eight matches\n2:39 Comment: they're nine points clear at the top of the Russian League\n2:42 Comment: they've had a couple of wins in a draw\n2:44 Comment: since they met Manchester United a couple of weeks ago\n2:53 Comment: there's Mata\n2:55 Comment: and now Jesse Lingard can get on the ball\n2:57 Comment: A fall here for Rooney!\n2:59 Comment: Well, he caught it well, couldn't quite steer it,\n3:2 Comment: but significantly, Michael, Louis van Gaal and the crowd in particular\n3:5 Comment: will be happy to see so many players trying to get forward.\n3:8 Comment: Yeah, that was brilliant from Manchester United, really sharp play.\n3:11 Comment: Fantastic ball in from Michael Carrick to start the move off into Wayne Rooney,\n3:16 Comment: and Wayne Rooney just killed the ball, it was bouncing up on him,\n3:19 Comment: but he killed the ball dead.\n3:20 Comment: Then they progressed to the left-hand side, get the ball in,\n3:22 Comment: and Rooney's unlucky in the end,\n3:23 Comment: but that's the sharpness that we want to see from Manchester United.\n3:27 Comment: Here's the Brazilian, Fernandes.\n3:32 Comment: And now Alexey Berezutski.\n3:34 Comment: No Vasily Berezutski tonight,\n3:36 Comment: he's not played since limping off in Moscow a fortnight ago.\n3:44 Comment: Could be an historic night for Wayne Rooney,\n3:46 Comment: who's had that first sighter of goal,\n3:48 Comment: four games without a goal for the Manchester United captain.\n3:52 Comment: He's one behind Dennis Law for second all-time\n3:55 Comment: on the Manchester United goal,\n3:57 Comment: scoring less than two behind Ruud van Nistelrooy\n3:59 Comment: for the most goals in European competition\n4:2 Comment: for a Manchester United player.\n4:17 Comment: Look at the space here for Daley Glynn to bring it forward.\n4:26 Comment: Martial,\n4:26 Comment: which neatly dunked at Jesse Lingard,\n4:28 Comment: and Martial's carried on running here.\n4:31 Comment: Now Marcus Rojo.\n4:34 Comment: Not quite the quality on the cross this time,\n4:36 Comment: that was easily cut out by Verne Bloom,\n4:37 Comment: and then played up towards Moussa.\n4:40 Comment: Chris Smalling in there quickly on the CSKA Moscow striker.\n4:44 Comment: Been a really nice tempo about Manchester United's start, Michael.\n4:48 Comment: Yeah, I don't think there's any surprise that CSKA are gonna try to sit back,\n4:52 Comment: play on the counter-attack, they've tried to play that at home actually,\n4:55 Comment: so they're gonna do it at home.\n4:56 Comment: They're certainly gonna do it away, as we mentioned,\n4:58 Comment: Manchester United looking pretty sharp already in this game.\n5:3 Comment: Makes it towards Rooney, and Akinfey have had to be alert.\n5:12 Comment: Little bit rocky, aren't they, early on, the Russian side,\n5:14 Comment: who started off with so much confidence in Moscow a couple of weeks ago.\n5:19 Comment: There is the coach, Leonid Slutsky,\n5:22 Comment: who's agreed to stay on as the Russian coach and combine the two jobs until after the European Cup,\n5:26 Comment: who's agreed to stay on as the European Cup,\n5:27 Comment: and who's done well with the national team since replacing Fabio Capello.\n5:32 Comment: And feels he can do both jobs, CSKA Moscow, and the coach of Russia as well.\n5:56 Comment: andplus, Madhhb disciplinarian y died soon after the08 I.\n6:1 Comment: audience streets.\n6:13 Comment: As Eco hes she's been wasting y'all's time on TV,\n6:16 Comment: many across the country who've voted on the song En Alliedo here.\n6:20 Comment: Ho lor, pro nazo,\n6:21 Comment: go on.\n6:22 Comment: Peter Scandas can,\n6:23 Comment: so as a være,\n6:24 Comment: who still appears forth in America,\n6:25 Comment: Mon sized palace of Mars,\n6:26 Comment: Now Lingard, Lingard's gonna try one himself,\n6:30 Comment: and it was a block made there by Mario Fernandes.\n6:33 Comment: Real signs of intent, though, early on from the home side.\n6:36 Comment: Yeah, well, I think it was a sign of intent straight away from the off,\n6:40 Comment: playing this formation.\n6:41 Comment: Definitely too central there, Martial and Rooney,\n6:44 Comment: so 4-4-2, not often you see that type of formation.\n6:46 Comment: Of course, Rooney and Martial will probably take it in turns,\n6:49 Comment: dropping deep, almost make it a 4-4-1-1 system,\n6:52 Comment: but it's a good start from United.\n6:54 Comment: It's Young who's retained his place at right-back\n6:57 Comment: after coming on at Crystal Palace\n6:59 Comment: and making one or two important interceptions and challenges.\n7:7 Comment: Rocco was looking to play that infield towards Lingard,\n7:10 Comment: and Shagoev can tidy things up for CSKA.\n7:16 Comment: Now here's Natko.\n7:19 Comment: Shanikov...\n7:22 Comment: ..infield towards the Bulgarian Milanov.\n7:24 Comment: And then Natko again.\n7:30 Comment: We did see, particularly first half in Moscow,\n7:32 Comment: how comfortable this CSKA side is on the ball,\n7:36 Comment: and they've got lots of experience, Michael, right the way through it,\n7:39 Comment: lots of players with plenty of international caps\n7:41 Comment: and maybe more significantly European experience too,\n7:44 Comment: as De Gea has to make his way forward following that back header from Chris Smalling.\n7:49 Comment: Yeah, I think a factor in the game out there was CSKA were...\n7:53 Comment: ..just almost letting Manchester United have the ball,\n7:56 Comment: but then when they pounced and when they won it,\n7:58 Comment: the first pass was forward and they broke, and they broke so fast.\n8:1 Comment: Obviously, Dombaya, he was one of the pivotal players in that,\n8:5 Comment: because he had so much pace up front.\n8:8 Comment: He's on the bench tonight with that tight thigh, as you mentioned, Aaron,\n8:11 Comment: but I still fancy they're gonna play a similar way.\n8:13 Comment: They are sitting back and just waiting to pounce.\n8:17 Comment: There's Michael Carrick, who's appearing in the group stage\n8:19 Comment: of the Champions League for the first time this season.\n8:23 Comment: FANS ROAR\n8:25 Comment: Now Rooney...\n8:27 Comment: Rooney can play, it's towards Lingard, and out comes Akinfea,\n8:30 Comment: by four for Rojo, and it was good goalkeeping in the end by the Russian international,\n8:35 Comment: who was alert there, not once but twice.\n8:37 Comment: Yeah, brilliant, Manchester United have just got numbers in attack,\n8:40 Comment: which is great to see.\n8:42 Comment: I wasn't sure it was a corner, it looked like a goal kick to me,\n8:46 Comment: but Manchester United, as we've mentioned already, plenty of intent.\n8:53 Comment: It's Daley Blinck, small link straight forward,\n8:55 Comment: instead it goes in towards Lingard, who's gonna try another one.\n8:59 Comment: There's certainly no shortage of confidence from young Jesse Lingard early on.\n9:4 Comment: Yeah, he's taken a couple of shots so far, here we see before,\n9:7 Comment: this is a lovely little position Wayne Rooney takes up.\n9:10 Comment: I think he's just offside, isn't he, Lingard?\n9:13 Comment: Goalkeeper does great there, but I think he smacks it into Rocco there,\n9:16 Comment: I don't know how the ball can come off the goalkeeper and go behind like that,\n9:20 Comment: but we'll soon see here.\n9:22 Comment: Great save that one.\n9:23 Comment: I think he gets there first with Rocco.\n9:32 Comment: Here's the experienced Ignacevic.\n9:36 Comment: Now Shenikov, those two play together regularly in the Russian national team.\n9:41 Comment: And then Milanov can make a run forward, Moussa waits in the penalty area.\n9:46 Comment: The interception made by Chris Smalling for Manchester United,\n9:49 Comment: then clipped away by Young, towards Anthony Martial,\n9:52 Comment: and...\n9:53 Comment: Oh, it's out.\n9:54 Comment: That's a rise for Ignacevic from Shakohev,\n9:57 Comment: and then Ignacevic just had a bit of a nibble at Anthony Martial,\n10:0 Comment: and that's a free kick to the home side.\n10:2 Comment: Brilliant play from Martial there.\n10:4 Comment: When you've got strength as a centre-forward, you can almost hold your ground,\n10:7 Comment: you're not dipping back into your own half, conceding ten yards,\n10:11 Comment: the ball gets played up to you, you hold your ground with your strength,\n10:14 Comment: gives your team time to breathe, and then when you hold the ball up like that,\n10:16 Comment: nick a foul, that's good work from a centre-forward.\n10:23 Comment: FULL-BACK FOOTBALL\n10:24 Comment: FALLING STAIRS\n10:25 Comment: Green falling steadily here at Old Trafford,\n10:26 Comment: which is just providing that natural sheen on the pitch and allowing the ball to zip around.\n10:30 Comment: FULL-BACK FOOTBALL\n10:32 Comment: Excellent ball out by Rooney to Marcus Rojo, who's got forward a lot early on,\n10:36 Comment: and he was dangerously in towards Lingard.\n10:38 Comment: FULL-BACK FOOTBALL\n10:39 Comment: Just half a yard or so in front of him,\n10:41 Comment: but it's been a feature of Manchester United's play so far, Michael.\n10:44 Comment: Rocco getting forward down the left.\n10:46 Comment: Yeah, and when you get your full-backs forward,\n10:48 Comment: it doesn't half give your team a lot of options,\n10:49 Comment: and I don't want to get carried away so early in the game,\n10:52 Comment: but I've watched Manchester United play, and I've seen them play a lot of times.\n10:53 Comment: I've watched them play a lot of times this season.\n10:55 Comment: This is as good as I've seen them start, really are looking sharp.\n10:58 Comment: FULL-BACK FOOTBALL\n11:16 Comment: Good news coming in from the other tie involving a Manchester side tonight,\n11:19 Comment: Sevilla nil, Manchester City two early on.\n11:22 Comment: Raheem Sterling is in the lead,\n11:25 Comment: and Fernandinho with the goals.\n11:27 Comment: As the group stands at the moment, it would be enough to see Manchester City safely through to the last 16.\n11:30 Comment: A really quick start made by Manuel Pellegrini's side in Spain.\n11:34 Comment: A quick start here by Manchester United too, but as yet without the reward of a goal.\n11:39 Comment: Manchester United two, but as yet without the reward of a goal.\n11:41 Comment: Martial just had a pull at Ignacevic's arm, which was spotted by the Polish referee.\n11:53 Comment: Had an eventful night two weeks ago in Moscow,\n11:56 Comment: Martial gave away the first-half penalty and then scored the equaliser in the second half,\n12:3 Comment: it's still a goal that Louis van Gaal talked about, the penalty given away by Martial,\n12:9 Comment: but young players will make mistakes of course from time to time.\n12:12 Comment: Yeah, he certainly redeemed himself, didn't he, that was such an important goal to get a draw there.\n12:17 Comment: You know, cos then they've got two home games now out of the last three,\n12:20 Comment: and they can win those in what is a...\n12:22 Comment: I'm not gonna say an easy group, but it's nothing special,\n12:25 Comment: you'd expect Manchester United to go through in this group.\n12:28 Comment: Two home games now, if they can get maximum points out of those two,\n12:31 Comment: that's gonna see them home and dry.\n12:34 Comment: If it goes towards Rooney, away by Berezutski,\n12:37 Comment: and then Lingard with the foul on Fernandes.\n12:52 Comment: weirdly 알았어\n13:5 Comment: Summing up the Judging equipments\n13:8 Comment: Redthing overall\n13:11 Comment: I don't think Greg scan through the zeker\n13:14 Comment: Summing up the Judging equipments\n13:17 Comment: It wasn't very this week.\n13:19 Comment: We're living if he wasn't in the matches today actually.\n13:21 Comment: It's on BT Sport ESPN.\n13:24 Comment: And then after that tonight, 10 o'clock, round up the night.\n13:26 Comment: All of the goals from around Europe in the Champions League.\n13:29 Comment: That's on BT Sport Europe from 10 o'clock.\n13:33 Comment: Always the best way to finish a night when you've watched the live game.\n13:40 Comment: Here's Bastian Schweinsteiger for Manchester United.\n13:44 Comment: Now Marcus Rojo.\n13:48 Comment: Schweinsteiger looking here for Ashley Young.\n13:51 Comment: Milanov was there for CSKA Moscow and then Smalling likewise for Manchester United.\n14:0 Comment: Here's Lingard who's been very lively so far.\n14:3 Comment: Now Anthony Martial.\n14:5 Comment: Fernandes across there with defending to do.\n14:8 Comment: As we saw in the first leg as well, Tosic is quickly on the scene to help out the full-back.\n14:13 Comment: They tend to get two around the Manchester United wingers when they've got the ball.\n14:17 Comment: It's a feature of CSKA Moscow's play in the first meeting.\n14:21 Comment: Two passing away on an extra goal.\n14:23 Comment: Little rush in fromitié of Rory Ehrman.\n14:32 Comment: Here is Rocco.\n14:33 Comment: Rooney starts to make the run into the middle.\n14:35 Comment: Martial is in there too.\n14:37 Comment: And that's Derek Becka from CSKA Moscow.\n14:48 Comment: He teaches a little bit ofmannishness too.\n14:50 Comment: He teaches.\n15:20 Comment: hasn't scored matter since he got the goal against Wolfsburg on that match day two for\n15:29 Comment: Manchester United but he was mighty close there to putting them in front his Schweinsteiger\n15:36 Comment: Manchester United seem to be camped inside the CSK Moscow half Carrick forward towards\n15:42 Comment: Martial the flag up against him yeah poor play for Martial there Carrick's got the ball he's\n15:50 Comment: looking for a forward pass one thing you can't be is offside second thing you're gonna be is\n15:53 Comment: alive to come and get the ball to feed just on his heels standing offside we see it here he's\n15:59 Comment: standing offside because they don't mind that so much but soon as you see Michael Carrick put his\n16:3 Comment: hat down you know he's got that reverse pass in his locker he's got to get on side and actually\n16:7 Comment: front open create something for him to hit\n16:20 Comment: away by young last touch there off Anthony Martial just wonder whether tactically van\n16:34 Comment: Carls gone for the 442 tonight Michael and a to make Manchester United more attacking but B to\n16:39 Comment: snuff out those forward runs of Fernandez from right back because he's so occupied out there\n16:43 Comment: defensively the Brazilian defender yeah it was always going to be interesting whether he was\n16:47 Comment: going to penetrate like he did on his home ground here they come again\n16:50 Comment: Manchester United with Manoa but one of them is ruined he pulls it back towards Lingard it might\n16:54 Comment: still fall here for Van Matta\n17:2 Comment: now Marcus Rojo he's going to try and try upon him and Matta was sniffing around as well\n17:11 Comment: yeah so many options today for Manchester United when they attack with bodies everywhere red shirts\n17:16 Comment: flooding in the box\n17:20 Comment: yeah yeah Troy\n17:34 Comment: you

game pla leva praisesgoros by Stt Amet-\n17:48 Comment: he's not quite fit enough to start.\n17:51 Comment: Yeah, and you mentioned Marcus Rocco, Darren,\n17:54 Comment: I think when you're a wide player, it really is a lot of cat and mouse.\n17:57 Comment: If you can get the full-back defending\n17:59 Comment: and don't give him a chance to attack and break forward\n18:2 Comment: and give him any confidence in that way,\n18:4 Comment: then you almost stifle it.\n18:6 Comment: The best way of defending is sometimes attacking,\n18:9 Comment: and that's what they're doing tonight, Manchester United,\n18:11 Comment: getting the full-backs forward.\n18:15 Comment: As good as he was going forward in Moscow,\n18:17 Comment: he was slightly shaky at times going the other way, wasn't he, Fernandes?\n18:29 Comment: Here's Daley Blins, who is alongside Chris Smalling again tonight,\n18:32 Comment: Phil Jones, back and available,\n18:35 Comment: and among the Manchester United substitutes.\n18:47 Comment: And now it's a straight-forward decision for the Polish referee,\n19:17 Comment: and now it's a straight-forward decision for the Polish referee,\n19:17 Comment: who passes the resulting yellow card.\n19:20 Comment: Yeah, Ashley Young, I think he was going to travel down the wing there,\n19:25 Comment: who's almost on his own against two, but fair play to him.\n19:28 Comment: He's won a free kick in a dangerous position,\n19:29 Comment: and he's got the full-back on a booking.\n19:33 Comment: Played here back in 2009, Shenikov, he was only 18,\n19:36 Comment: he deflected Antonio Valencia's goal\n19:38 Comment: to give Manchester United a 3-3 very late in that match.\n19:42 Comment: One of a handful of players still around the CSKA side who are here,\n19:46 Comment: six years in the league,\n19:47 Comment: two years to go.\n19:50 Comment: Smalling up for the free kick.\n19:53 Comment: Rojo is hovering as well.\n19:57 Comment: It's in by Mata,\n19:59 Comment: in the direction of Marcus Rojo,\n20:1 Comment: away by Shenikov.\n20:3 Comment: Here is Rojo.\n20:5 Comment: Shenikov gets a block on,\n20:7 Comment: and it's away by Natko for CSKA Moscow,\n20:11 Comment: and then given away by Michael Carrick,\n20:12 Comment: which will give Tosic, the former Manchester United player,\n20:15 Comment: a chance to come forward.\n20:17 Comment: And now Milanov,\n20:18 Comment: and across well,\n20:20 Comment: defensively,\n20:22 Comment: Ashley Young have covered a lot of ground together.\n20:25 Comment: One thing you don't do against counter-attacking teams\n20:27 Comment: is play square balls,\n20:28 Comment: and that's what Michael Carrick did there.\n20:30 Comment: It was his mistake, really, that set them off.\n20:34 Comment: Not like him, normally a really good protector of the ball,\n20:38 Comment: rarely gives the ball away.\n20:39 Comment: Nice!\n20:45 Comment: Milanov was lucky to play,\n20:47 Comment: but Rojo back in,\n20:48 Comment: and Smalling gets it away.\n20:50 Comment: Michael Carrick was saying in the build-up to the match,\n20:53 Comment: there's always a pivotal fixture in the group stage of the Champions League,\n20:55 Comment: and he feels that this is it for Manchester United this season.\n20:59 Comment: This is the pivotal game, one that they've got to win.\n21:1 Comment: Let's go!\n21:5 Comment: There's Anthony Martial,\n21:7 Comment: with Ignacevic sticking to him like glue,\n21:9 Comment: and conceding the throw-in to Manchester United.\n21:13 Comment: Let's go!\n21:15 Comment: One, two, three, four!\n21:16 Comment: He's perfect, but it's not,\n21:18 Comment: nice defence by Mania,\n21:19 Comment: you can tell that labour isales like an ice fl Jenkins,\n21:23

him\n21:50 Comment: that's his Tosic\n21:51 Comment: Tosic slow runs into Schweinsteiger\n21:54 Comment: Schweinsteiger looks to play forward quickly\n21:56 Comment: although too much on that\n21:58 Comment: towards Anthony Martial\n22:0 Comment: he had to play it quicker though Darren\n22:3 Comment: he could have played it quicker\n22:5 Comment: Martial was expecting him to\n22:7 Comment: and he almost just took an extra stride\n22:8 Comment: and then tried to chip it\n22:9 Comment: he didn't seem to know that Moussa was behind him\n22:12 Comment: I think the hair was alive to it\n22:14 Comment: he's done that about 3 or 4 times already\n22:16 Comment: Chris Small in this game\n22:18 Comment: keeps flicking the ball back to De Gea\n22:20 Comment: got away with it\n22:23 Comment: so 0-0 here\n22:32 Comment: and still 2-0 to Manchester City\n22:35 Comment: and Sevilla but Borussia Mönchengladbach\n22:37 Comment: are leading Juventus\n22:38 Comment: and the way the group stands Manchester City need to win\n22:41 Comment: and they need Juventus\n22:43 Comment: to avoid defeat against\n22:44 Comment: Borussia Mönchengladbach\n22:45 Comment: to qualify\n22:46 Comment: so Manchester City doing their bit at the moment\n22:50 Comment: Juventus up to now\n22:52 Comment: not keeping their side of the bargain\n22:55 Comment: away by Ignacevic\n23:7 Comment: Manchester City\n23:7 Comment: Manchester just emphasises Michael\n23:8 Comment: how dominant Manchester United have been early on\n23:11 Comment: 69% possession which is similar to what it was\n23:13 Comment: in Moscow\n23:14 Comment: a couple of weeks ago\n23:15 Comment: where they dominated the ball in that match too\n23:17 Comment: particularly second half\n23:18 Comment: but we're always used to seeing Manchester United\n23:20 Comment: dominating possession aren't we\n23:22 Comment: but tonight it just feels a little bit different\n23:24 Comment: they've got possession but\n23:25 Comment: they're actually looking to penetrate forward\n23:28 Comment: they're doing things a little bit quicker\n23:29 Comment: I'm surprised if\n23:31 Comment: Moscow hold on this half without conceding a goal\n23:35 Comment: because they are looking sharp\n23:44 Comment: it's\n23:47 Comment: it is and they'll Inter cast 0-0\n23:54 Comment: vice-champion\n23:57 Comment: now Manchester City 0-1\n23:58 Comment: they can't complain about it\n24:0 Comment: But they got away with this\n24:2 Comment: if they still have some decency\n24:4 Comment: Inter is young\n24:5 Comment: I'd say what we're looking for\n24:7 Comment: is titillation\n24:8 Comment: can they try things outside again\n24:9 Comment: they're looking Fel subjects\n24:11 Comment: these three players\n24:12 Comment: their first

appearance in Europe for them tonight.\n24:23 Comment: Now Young, looking to navigate his way beyond Milano.\n24:44 Comment: Lingard, who can have another run at Fernandes.\n24:47 Comment: Berezutski can get across for CSKA Moscow.\n24:58 Comment: Now Daley-Blind.\n25:1 Comment: Rojo was looking to play the ball in towards Lingard,\n25:4 Comment: and the last touch came off Fernandes.\n25:11 Comment: Great pass for the ball, Daley-Blind.\n25:13 Comment: He's a real good footballer.\n25:14 Comment: I know people question his defending,\n25:16 Comment: cos he's almost paced and not too big in size and strength,\n25:20 Comment: but when he's on the ball, his first touch and his passing ability are absolutely brilliant.\n25:25 Comment: Here we see again, he's just not scared to manipulate the ball in any way, even under pressure.\n25:40 Comment: Young to Rooney, and then Mata.\n25:43 Comment: He's just lost his footing in there.\n25:44 Comment: He was able to recover it quickly, but he's gonna fall in for Lingard.\n25:49 Comment: Couldn't quite get it down quickly enough, which...\n25:51 Comment: Remember Berezutski could partially clear.\n25:53 Comment: Now Marcus Rojo, with Fernandes across there.\n25:59 Comment: Schweinsteiger.\n26:1 Comment: Blind, who can step forward from centre-back.\n26:4 Comment: He's not really got anybody to mark back there.\n26:6 Comment: Rojo's got time to cross in towards Anthony Martial.\n26:11 Comment: And then the handball, I think it was, given against Basti and Schweinsteiger.\n26:14 Comment: Sevilla have pulled a goal back\n26:28 Comment: in the game against Manchester City\n26:31 Comment: tonight, Sterling and Fernandinho\n26:32 Comment: have given City a 2-0 lead, Tremolinas\n26:34 Comment: has pulled one back, so Sevilla\n26:36 Comment: 1, Manchester City\n26:38 Comment: 2, 0-0 here in the\n26:40 Comment: rain as Old Trafford, rain that's been steadily\n26:42 Comment: falling for quite some\n26:44 Comment: time and just one or two signs Michael in the last\n26:46 Comment: five minutes or so that one or two\n26:48 Comment: of the players might be starting to find it\n26:50 Comment: a wee bit slippy, Mata has\n26:52 Comment: on a couple of occasions just slipped a little bit when he's\n26:54 Comment: tried to accelerate\n27:9 Comment: A long ball sent forward by Blind\n27:11 Comment: looking to get Martial in\n27:12 Comment: away by Ignacevic\n27:14 Comment: there's Natko\n27:16 Comment: only manages to backheel it to Blind\n27:19 Comment: and now Lingard can set\n27:21 Comment: off on his way although showed too much of it\n27:23 Comment: for Fernandes but there was Blind\n27:25 Comment: quick as a flash to give it in back and then\n27:26 Comment: Lingard in towards Martial\n27:28 Comment: and the CSKA captain\n27:31 Comment: Akinfeyev off his line to claim it\n27:33 Comment: He's just overhitting a lot\n27:35 Comment: today Lingard so far, his pass\n27:37 Comment: there was overhit, his touch was\n27:38 Comment: too heavy\n27:40 Comment: he's run into trouble, look up\n27:42 Comment: a couple of times, just needs to sort his touch out\n27:57 Comment: Schweinsteiger on the move and gliding through them here\n27:59 Comment: and there he was caught Schweinsteiger\n28:1 Comment: the Polish referee looked initially if there was an advantage\n28:5 Comment: to Manchester United and when there wasn't\n28:7 Comment: he brought it back for the free kick but it was a good run wasn't it\n28:9 Comment: from Schweinsteiger, brilliant because everyone expects him to just\n28:12 Comment: pass the ball so a lot of the time\n28:14 Comment: people will think well let's not get too close to him\n28:16 Comment: because he's only going to pass it and only going to have to\n28:18 Comment: jog back into position but that time he saw the opening\n28:20 Comment: and brilliant play just not sure\n28:22 Comment: I suppose this isn't within range\n28:24 Comment: to go direct from Wayne Rooney\n28:26 Comment: fair old distance though on the angle\n28:30 Comment: I suppose Akinfeyev as well will be aware of the\n28:32 Comment: the skiddy surface as well if Rooney\n28:34 Comment: could pitch the ball\n28:36 Comment: anywhere in front of him\n28:38 Comment: it might be difficult to hold on a wet night\n28:40 Comment: Rooney's going to whip it in to one of the players who's going to be in the middle of the pitch\n28:42 Comment: it might be difficult to hold on a wet night\n28:44 Comment: and then Moorling and he didn't quite get the touch\n28:46 Comment: he was looking for\n28:48 Comment: if he had have done that might well\n28:50 Comment: have found its way in\n28:52 Comment: yeah they seem to keep quite a high line there Moscow\n28:54 Comment: they didn't really drop too far\n28:58 Comment: everyone just ducks underneath it\n29:0 Comment: it's a cracking ball\n29:2 Comment: I'm not quite sure what Chris Moorling's\n29:4 Comment: doing there and I can understand if he's a defender\n29:6 Comment: himself trying to duck out of it to leave it\n29:8 Comment: go for a goal kick but what is he doing\n29:10 Comment: surely got to have a little flip on it\n29:12 Comment: He had a good eye for goal against Wolfsburg when he got the win,\n29:15 Comment: but the finishing touch deserted him.\n29:17 Comment: He's flicked everything on so far,\n29:19 Comment: when he's at the back, back to Davide De Gea,\n29:22 Comment: so I'm not sure why he stopped flicking them on.\n29:27 Comment: Forward by Young towards Mata, away by Shenikov.\n29:33 Comment: Bulgarian Milanov, one of a couple of players who didn't feature\n29:37 Comment: in the first meeting between the sides.\n29:42 Comment: He's come off the bench 19 times already this season, the Bulgarian.\n29:47 Comment: He's usually used that way by Leonid Slutsky,\n29:49 Comment: but with injuries mounting for CSKA,\n29:52 Comment: they've had to make one or two changes tonight.\n29:59 Comment: Schweinsteiger.\n30:2 Comment: Rooney.\n30:6 Comment: And Michael Carrick.\n30:11 Comment: Young has got Mata.\n30:12 Comment: Mata supporting him, and Martial here in a more central position,\n30:16 Comment: then forced wide by the CSKA defenders,\n30:20 Comment: and he's just had a little pull there at Oleksii Berezutski,\n30:24 Comment: right in front of the assistant who gives the free kick to the Russian side.\n30:28 Comment: Yeah, no doubt he pulled the shirt, as you gather.\n30:32 Comment: There's the evidence, it doesn't do me to say that, does it?\n30:34 Comment: It's a difficult one to argue, that, isn't it?\n30:40 Comment: I think he just felt that he got a little tough,\n30:42 Comment: but the strength of the ball, he had three, four men round him,\n30:46 Comment: if he could just get that,\n30:48 Comment: when the ball comes to him,\n30:50 Comment: he can almost attract so many men forward,\n30:54 Comment: or all around him, he could then just release it,\n30:56 Comment: there's obviously going to be space elsewhere on the park.\n31:1 Comment: Tosic with a challenge on Rocco,\n31:3 Comment: three successive 0-0 draws for Manchester United for the first time in ten years,\n31:8 Comment: failing to score against City and Middlesbrough, Crystal Palace,\n31:12 Comment: and then the final four in the weekend,\n31:14 Comment: it's four draws in a row if you factor in the one in Moscow too.\n31:17 Comment: Despite all of the pressure they've been able to put on this CSKA side,\n31:21 Comment: still yet to be rewarded with a goal,\n31:23 Comment: really looked at by Marciali, and Shenikov across.\n31:28 Comment: Brilliant play again, I love that ball from Carrick,\n31:31 Comment: and when you've got two strikers you can start feeding off each other like that.\n31:35 Comment: Here's Mata, Mata into Young, it's promising,\n31:39 Comment: and it goes, it topples a long way, Jesse Lingard!\n31:42 Comment: All he needed was the accuracy at the end of it.\n31:49 Comment: Well, he's plenty lively enough so far, Lingard, but...\n31:52 Comment: His touch is just not there, this is brilliant,\n31:55 Comment: great touch there, great ball across the downfield,\n31:58 Comment: that touch is not good enough,\n32:0 Comment: that touch is not good enough, it almost drops the ball behind him and away from goal,\n32:5 Comment: he should be coming on to that either hit it first time,\n32:7 Comment: but it just skews backwards, he almost then has to hit it,\n32:11 Comment: leaning back, trying to hit the far corner.\n32:14 Comment: As I said, spotted it quite early on in the game, his touch is just not quite there yet.\n32:35 Comment: Lingard looking to take on Fernandes, and Rojo with a throw.\n32:40 Comment: Almost there.\n32:41 Comment: He's filled himself with the ball there, the Argentine.\n32:46 Comment: Now Natko, who can play it forward towards Moussa to get in behind them,\n32:49 Comment: because if he does they won't catch him, we saw that in the first game, didn't we?\n32:53 Comment: Yeah, and obviously when he's running against DailyBlind,\n32:56 Comment: then that's probably the one area they think Moscow can exploit.\n33:1 Comment: But in general it's been pretty cool, calm,\n33:4 Comment: we see the attempts on goal, it's been one-way traffic so far.\n33:9 Comment: They've got a win in Manchester last season,\n33:11 Comment: that's CSKA when they beat Manchester City.\n33:14 Comment: Although the man who got the two goals that night, Seydou Doumbia, is only on the bench,\n33:19 Comment: and it was aided significantly by the fact that Fernandinho and Yaya Toure were both sent off.\n33:25 Comment: The majority of that team that won at the Etihad last season are starting tonight.\n33:34 Comment: One of them here is Shakohev.\n33:37 Comment: Now Verne Bloem, the Swedish international.\n33:40 Comment: Fernandes.\n33:41 Comment: Probably forward for the first time from right back.\n33:49 Comment: There's Pontus Verne Bloem.\n33:52 Comment: I think that goes towards Milanov,\n33:54 Comment: and that bounced up awkwardly for Ashley Young,\n33:56 Comment: he's then caught by Shenykov,\n33:59 Comment: who of course is on a yellow card, already the Russian international.\n34:5 Comment: Yeah, brave boy making a foul there.\n34:8 Comment: I'm not saying it was a yellow card, but he's got to be careful.\n34:11 Comment: So early in the game, already booked, sticking his leg out like that,\n34:14 Comment: in an area that's not so dangerous.\n34:23 Comment: And Schweinsteiger, got time to turn.\n34:25 Comment: And Lingard, Rocco making that run beyond him, and Lingard spotted him.\n34:30 Comment: Rocco whips it in first time, only really matter to Emac.\n34:33 Comment: Shenykov away, now Carrick.\n34:37 Comment: Schweinsteiger spots Mata in space, and Shenykov was alive to it.\n34:41 Comment: And defends it effectively inside his own penalty area.\n35:2 Comment: To Lingard.\n35:4 Comment: Marcus Rocco, those two combining really well down the Manchester United left,\n35:7 Comment: here they are again, Rocco to Rooney.\n35:11 Comment: And Rooney, Rooney, Rooney.\n35:13 Comment: Now Ashley Young arrives on the scene.\n35:15 Comment: Three to pick out with the cross, in it goes from Young,\n35:18 Comment: stands up nicely!\n35:19 Comment: And it was there to be hit for Marcus Rocco,\n35:21 Comment: who can't believe he didn't hit the target.\n35:26 Comment: What a wonderful cross from Ashley Young.\n35:31 Comment: This is him, he's got a great cross with the ball,\n35:33 Comment: I'm just not sure why Rocco tries to leather that.\n35:37 Comment: It's coming like that, I think.\n35:41 Comment: Personally I would have gone with the side of my foot,\n35:43 Comment: I still think you can get a lot of power on the volley with the side of your foot,\n35:46 Comment: a lot more accuracy.\n35:48 Comment: He's obviously gone with the laces.\n35:50 Comment: And just, well, shinned it, shanked it, whatever which way you want,\n35:53 Comment: but it's not good, it's a left-back's finish, isn't it?\n35:57 Comment: Forward by Young, he's a growing threat in the match for Manchester United,\n36:1 Comment: getting forward with more regularity from right-back,\n36:4 Comment: and when he does do, tends to put some quality in,\n36:6 Comment: that's a good ball to Lingard, he's still going.\n36:9 Comment: Ignacevic there, and then Vernebloom,\n36:11 Comment: who was the player that it cannoned off,\n36:13 Comment: and it will be a Manchester United corner.\n36:18 Comment: Really encouraging, though, isn't it?\n36:20 Comment: We saw Rocco then hitting the ball wide,\n36:22 Comment: but he's in the six-yard box as a left-back.\n36:25 Comment: Manchester United are getting an awful lot of bodies forward,\n36:29 Comment: and if you do that, the ball's gonna drop to you at some point.\n36:35 Comment: Lingard's gonna have to take this corner,\n36:37 Comment: Smalling is up from the back, Rocco's in there too,\n36:40 Comment: instead it's away by Fenele,\n36:41 Comment: Hernandez...\n36:44 Comment: Moussa now with the possibility to take a run at Daily Blind,\n36:46 Comment: although he's completely lacking in support.\n36:50 Comment: Gave himself the free kick, following the foul by Blind.\n37:1 Comment: I think he rolled over quite a few times there,\n37:3 Comment: and when he realised Daily Blind wasn't gonna get a yellow card,\n37:5 Comment: then straight up onto his feet.\n37:9 Comment: Quick kick taken towards, certainly, the back, but...\n37:10 Comment: It's a good one.\n37:11 Comment: ...towards Milanov, away by Smalling.\n37:13 Comment: Plenty of time now for Ashley Young for Manchester United.\n37:20 Comment: Carrick up to Rooney,\n37:22 Comment: and they turn defence into attack really effectively and quickly there,\n37:25 Comment: Manchester United.\n37:26 Comment: Here's Lingard, and now Schweinsteiger.\n37:28 Comment: Fernandes over there, he got the last touch,\n37:32 Comment: Manchester United corner.\n37:34 Comment: Corner count starting to rise,\n37:36 Comment: and the pressure remaining on Akinfeyev's goal.\n37:40 Comment: Here's Lingard.\n37:48 Comment: Carrick floats one up towards Smalling, who is offside.\n37:54 Comment: Yeah, frustrating really, isn't it, you get a corner and you go back like that,\n37:57 Comment: the crowd sighing as well.\n38:0 Comment: Chris Smalling can see right across the line, he's offside.\n38:3 Comment: FANS SING\n38:8 Comment: JESUS CHRIST, JESUS CHRIST!\n38:11 Comment: Falster.\n38:13 Comment: Lind higher than Moussa.\n38:16 Comment: Schweinsteiger on the run again, Marseille,\n38:18 Comment: I think, he felt he was offside,\n38:20 Comment: hence why he didn't try and get on the end of that.\n38:22 Comment: Why is he offside now?\n38:24 Comment: Why is he standing in an offside position?\n38:26 Comment: If you're going to stand in an offside position during the course of play\n38:29 Comment: to try to stretch the team a bit more\n38:31 Comment: or stay in the blind spot\n38:33 Comment: so then get on and get running again, then fine.\n38:36 Comment: But don't be standing offside.\n38:38 Comment: someone's lifting their head up to pass to you.\n38:42 Comment: Manchester City have got a third goal, by the way.\n38:44 Comment: Wilfred Bonny has it.\n38:45 Comment: A severe one.\n38:47 Comment: Manchester City, three.\n38:49 Comment: Although the fact that Borussia Mönchengladbach are beating Juventus\n38:51 Comment: would mean that City would have to wait before securing qualification.\n38:58 Comment: It's smaller.\n38:59 Comment: For all Manchester United's pressure and possession,\n39:3 Comment: they haven't got a goal.\n39:6 Comment: Carrick forward towards Martial.\n39:8 Comment: He's looking to wriggle away from Ignacevic,\n39:10 Comment: and the bounce takes it to Rooney.\n39:13 Comment: And as soon as he gathered it, the flag went up.\n39:20 Comment: Martial again, just coming short, using his strength.\n39:24 Comment: Rooney's just making a run through, and as you can see, he is offside.\n39:28 Comment: I think there is a ricochet that comes off Martial,\n39:31 Comment: so it's come off his own play.\n39:32 Comment: I think it's a good call from the linesman.\n39:38 Comment: Come on, come on!\n39:58 Comment: Lingard challenged by Fernandes.\n40:1 Comment: Rocco then under pressure from Tosic.\n40:3 Comment: Oh!\n40:6 Comment: It's going to be a Manchester United free,\n40:8 Comment: and more Champions League action for you tomorrow night.\n40:10 Comment: Champions League tonight from half-past six.\n40:13 Comment: That's on BT Sport Europe HD.\n40:16 Comment: Bayern Munich versus Arsenal, half-past seven tomorrow,\n40:18 Comment: BT Sport Europe HD.\n40:20 Comment: And at the same time, Jose Mourinho back under the spotlight.\n40:23 Comment: Chelsea versus Dynamo Kiev.\n40:25 Comment: Seven o'clock, the coverage starts.\n40:27 Comment: BT Sport 2 HD.\n40:30 Comment: Two huge nights of Champions League action here on BT Sport.\n40:35 Comment: That's a foul there by Shagoev.\n40:38 Comment: I think the idea was that Shagoev would play further forward for CSKA Moscow tonight,\n40:43 Comment: but they've been so penned in by Manchester United,\n40:46 Comment: it's been just about as deep as he was in Moscow a fortnight ago.\n40:49 Comment: Yeah, it seems like Natko's been the one that's trying to get as close to the centre-forward as possible,\n40:54 Comment: but they've been very hard, they've hardly had the ball.\n40:57 Comment: He's been mainly helping his two centre-midfield partners out.\n41:1 Comment: It's Young forward again.\n41:3 Comment: Milanov was shadowing him.\n41:6 Comment: Now Michael Carrick.\n41:8 Comment: Rojo to Schweinsteiger.\n41:14 Comment: Lingard, who makes up for that inaccurate pass from the German.\n41:24 Comment: Challenging from Trotsich in the last touch-off.\n41:26 Comment: Rocco, that's a CSKA ball in there.\n41:28 Comment: There.\n41:38 Comment: There's Natko.\n41:43 Comment: Shagoev towards Wernblum.\n41:44 Comment: Didn't get there.\n41:45 Comment: Martial can have a run here against Berezutski.\n41:48 Comment: Too strong there for the Russian.\n41:51 Comment: Martial now looking to find a way through.\n41:52 Comment: Fernandes arrived to help out and was able to win it back for CSKA.\n41:58 Comment: Schweinsteiger's interception.\n41:59 Comment: Now Carrick to Mata.\n42:2 Comment: And then acrobatically away by Milanov.\n42:5 Comment: Smalling beats Moussa to it.\n42:7 Comment: And Young can take it.\n42:8 Comment: Young can take it.\n42:8 Comment: And then tiny things back up to Daley-Blint.\n42:20 Comment: Moussa did really well there.\n42:23 Comment: That was a very good ball from Davica Heyer.\n42:24 Comment: Now here's Anthony Martial.\n42:27 Comment: Wayne Rooney.\n42:35 Comment: Young.\n42:36 Comment: Mata.\n42:39 Comment: Schweinsteiger.\n42:42 Comment: And Lingard.\n42:44 Comment: Rocco is over there with him as always.\n42:47 Comment: Lingard's ball in.\n42:49 Comment: Nowhere near those who'd run in the middle.\n42:51 Comment: Now behind for a goal kick.\n42:54 Comment: Yeah, poor decision.\n42:56 Comment: It's gone a little bit flat, hasn't it?\n42:58 Comment: The second part of the first half.\n43:0 Comment: Still in total control.\n43:2 Comment: I think Louis van Gaal will be disappointed that that possession\n43:5 Comment: and that good start to the game.\n43:7 Comment: Hasn't been capitalised on.\n43:8 Comment: They've not been able to keep the tempo up, have they?\n43:11 Comment: They were playing much quicker in the opening 15 or 20 minutes.\n43:15 Comment: They've just been shackled that little bit more by CSKA.\n43:18 Comment: They were found a reliable defensive shape again.\n43:23 Comment: I do like the way they've used the width though on both sides, Darren.\n43:26 Comment: You know, that's a real hallmark of Manchester United teams over the years.\n43:29 Comment: Use the width, switch the play.\n43:32 Comment: In the last 10, 15 minutes, the opposition virtually out on their feet.\n43:36 Comment: They can't handle it.\n43:36 Comment: They score late on to win games.\n43:39 Comment: And they've done that tonight.\n43:40 Comment: They've really moved the ball in all kinds of angles.\n43:43 Comment: Ignacevic away.\n43:45 Comment: Still going strong in the Champions League at 36, the Russian international.\n43:51 Comment: It's a problem though, isn't it, Michael?\n43:52 Comment: Because when you look at the strength of this CSKA side,\n43:55 Comment: Akinfeyev, Ignacevic, Berezutski and Shenykov have all played numerous times together for Russia,\n44:1 Comment: and they've been together with CSKA for the bulk of their careers,\n44:5 Comment: and they've come here tonight.\n44:6 Comment: They've faced the Manchester United onslaught early on and got through it.\n44:10 Comment: Yeah, you're not going to walk over them.\n44:11 Comment: You're going to have to do something a little bit special to score a goal against them.\n44:18 Comment: Lingard beamed to by Fernandes.\n44:20 Comment: Here's Michael Carragher.\n44:22 Comment: Lingard, Rocco, Mata, Rudy and Martial waiting in the middle.\n44:28 Comment: Across hits Verne, Bloom, they'll get the corner, but...\n44:31 Comment: Rocco will feel it should have been better.\n44:33 Comment: Yeah, I feel it should have been better.\n44:35 Comment: Rocco...\n44:36 Comment: Convinced with his decision-making, not convinced with him on the ball,\n44:39 Comment: he's taken a touch there, Santa forward.\n44:42 Comment: As a Santa forward, you're just bursting to make a run with his first touch,\n44:46 Comment: as soon as he takes a touch it kills your run.\n44:50 Comment: Given away this time by Lingard.\n44:52 Comment: And that brings to an end of first half that saw Manchester United dominate,\n44:56 Comment: they started really well, taking the game to CSKA.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: the two teams in charge and they've got to find a way in the next 45 minutes to get a goal\n0:6 Comment: otherwise they make qualification for the knockout stages that much more difficult\n0:10 Comment: yeah this was their banker in many ways wasn't it they had to get three points here they'll feel as\n0:16 Comment: if they need to get three points and to be fair to them they've been the better side by far in the\n0:21 Comment: first half so I'm sure Louis van Gaal won't have had too many strong words to say one or two options\n0:27 Comment: off the bench if things aren't going well in 20 odd minutes. One thing we did see during the\n0:34 Comment: halftime interval was Seydou Doumbia warming up quite vigorously whether his arrival on the scene\n0:41 Comment: is not too far away we will find out. Here's Schweinsteiger for Manchester United, now Mata\n0:49 Comment: Ashley Young has come forward to join him and it goes towards Rooney and away by Ignacevic\n0:55 Comment: for CSKA Moscow\n0:57 Comment: and then Moussa concedes the Manchester United throw. Certainly looked as though Doumbia was\n1:2 Comment: preparing himself to come on Michael rather than just keep him warm at half-time he's still warming\n1:7 Comment: up now as well. Yeah he's obviously one to watch isn't he from Manchester United's point of view\n1:13 Comment: he's so fast he caused a lot of problems in the first half of the game. Wincard gets away from\n1:19 Comment: Fernandes and throws it through towards Rooney and it was a really important challenge in there by\n1:23 Comment: the veteran Ignacevic, Rooney was waiting behind him for a tap in.\n1:27 Comment: Yeah it was but only because Berezutski was, well his position was all at sea at the near post there.\n1:33 Comment: He should be covering that channel between goalkeeper and six yard box but he almost\n1:37 Comment: came out of it and needed his centre half partner to cover him.\n1:40 Comment: Smalling has gone forward for the corner which is taken by the Manchester United captain Rooney,\n1:44 Comment: travels a long way and for the second time in the game Marcus Rocco had a glorious opportunity.\n1:51 Comment: Yeah Manchester United left back has probably had the two best chances of the game, not sure whether\n1:56 Comment: he expected this to come through.\n1:57 Comment: Yeah Manchester United there you can see in the box\n2:1 Comment: they're charging him, I wouldn't say it's on purpose\n2:3 Comment: the box they're right next to him but he's ended up pretty much all alone in the middle of two CSKA defenders.\n2:18 Comment: The only thing that you would say is when someone's jumping\n2:20 Comment: ahead of you you can lose the sight of the ball or the flight of the ball\n2:24 Comment: left back and forwards.\n2:26 Comment: It's a good side isn't it?\n2:27 Comment: sign if he's managed to take one of the four.\n2:30 Comment: He's had two really good ones\n2:31 Comment: hasn't he? The volley in the first half\n2:33 Comment: and the header, which was a free header really\n2:35 Comment: at the start\n2:37 Comment: of the second half.\n2:45 Comment: Here's Young.\n2:51 Comment: Character blind.\n2:57 Comment: Towards Martial.

The one thing to do, one to try and avoid\n3:32 Comment: if they can, is going to Wolfsburg, going to\n3:34 Comment: Germany in the final round of\n3:36 Comment: group matches, needing something. That looks to be\n3:38 Comment: the trickiest of all the games that\n3:40 Comment: Manchester United have in the group.\n3:44 Comment: Here's Lingard.\n3:46 Comment: Now Rojo.\n3:48 Comment: Michael Carrick.\n3:53 Comment: Fernandes comes\n3:54 Comment: out to challenge Marcus\n3:56 Comment: Rojo. The Brazilian\n3:58 Comment: beats the Argentine this time,\n4:0 Comment: although young Jesse Lingard wins it\n4:2 Comment: back well for Manchester United.\n4:5 Comment: Now Carrick.\n4:8 Comment: Rojo.\n4:9 Comment: Tosic was the\n4:10 Comment: defender that time.\n4:13 Comment: Tosic again,\n4:14 Comment: although that benefits Michael Carrick\n4:16 Comment: who then couldn't take it with him.\n4:18 Comment: Fernandes was\n4:20 Comment: able to make the initial challenge\n4:22 Comment: and then allow it to roll out of play\n4:24 Comment: for a throw to CSKA.\n4:26 Comment: Moxley.\n4:26 Comment: Yeah, they're on the front foot\n4:28 Comment: though, Michael Carrick\n4:29 Comment: trying to just play the little one too as it happened.\n4:32 Comment: It came off the defender and he was still in there\n4:34 Comment: but I like the way they're winning the second ball here.\n4:37 Comment: In the first game\n4:38 Comment: Moscow were winning the ball and breaking\n4:40 Comment: on them but they're almost smothering every\n4:42 Comment: attack at the moment, Manchester United.\n4:44 Comment: There's Marcus Rojo who can cross\n4:46 Comment: first time and it goes towards Martial.\n4:49 Comment: He scored with the header two\n4:50 Comment: weeks ago and was\n4:52 Comment: climbing highest there for Manchester United\n4:54 Comment: but couldn't quite direct it.\n4:56 Comment: He had the running jump, didn't he?\n4:58 Comment: Had the momentum, bit of confidence,\n5:0 Comment: hadn't scored one, and the away lag.\n5:3 Comment: Did everything right, headed it down,\n5:4 Comment: skidded off the pitch but a bit too close to the goalkeeper.\n5:22 Comment: There's Mata.\n5:32 Comment: It's fine, Steigert.\n5:36 Comment: Rooney.\n5:38 Comment: And some space out wide here\n5:39 Comment: for Ashley Young. Shenikov\n5:41 Comment: across there for CSKA.\n5:44 Comment: Young manages to squeeze in the cross\n5:45 Comment: and that just took a little flick\n5:47 Comment: off the Russian defender. It's going to be a Manchester United\n5:49 Comment: corner.\n5:54 Comment: Yeah, pressure building again.\n5:56 Comment: I think they thought about a short corner here but they're going to go in long.\n6:1 Comment: Swung in by Juan Mata, in towards Rojo, fisted away to full for Lingard\n6:5 Comment: who couldn't quite get the shot in.\n6:7 Comment: It was Tosic niddling at him from behind and then Tosic\n6:11 Comment: able to block that cross in from Marcus Rojo as well.\n6:14 Comment: Lingard towards Rojo and the flag\n6:17 Comment: up on the far side.\n6:23 Comment: Well, strange way of trying to cross the ball from Rojo then.\n6:26 Comment: I wouldn't say he's the most perfect at crosses anyway,\n6:29 Comment: so strange to see him getting out the party tricks at nil-nil.\n6:33 Comment: As you see here, didn't quite work.\n6:48 Comment: I think of a couple of members of his Argentina\n6:52 Comment: national team who might have been more successful with that than Marcus Rojo.\n6:56 Comment: But all the same, he's been a real attacking source for Manchester United tonight.\n7:5 Comment: There's Carrick, looking to lift it in towards Jesse Lingard.\n7:9 Comment: And Igor Akinfeyev had read that from the word go and was out there waiting for the ball.\n7:14 Comment: Yeah, it was a great run from Lingard, just ran flat across the back four.\n7:18 Comment: And when you run flat across and you can actually see the passer of the ball,\n7:21 Comment: you're just waiting and waiting and waiting until he lifts his leg up\n7:24 Comment: and then you make your dart in.\n7:26 Comment: Really good run from Lingard.\n7:29 Comment: Tosic, not seen much of him as an attacking threat in the match so far,\n7:32 Comment: but he's on the move here with Daley Blind ahead of him.\n7:36 Comment: Zagarev, Moussa looking to play it through towards Milanov,\n7:39 Comment: and away there by Daley Blind for Manchester United.\n7:44 Comment: Napco, that was sloppy from him.\n7:46 Comment: Here's Anthony Martial, who can turn and run at them.\n7:48 Comment: And he's got Shennikov behind him, Rooney supporting him.\n7:52 Comment: And in the end he seems to get caught between two thoughts,\n7:54 Comment: and he gives the ball away to...\n7:56 Comment: Napco for CSKA Moscow.\n7:58 Comment: I just don't know why he was trying to pass it in that situation.\n8:1 Comment: He's running at Shennikov, who's already on a yellow card.\n8:4 Comment: Just that's the ideal opportunity, commit the man.\n8:7 Comment: There's Martial in a wide position who can run at Shennikov,\n8:10 Comment: and times his challenge... excellently.\n8:14 Comment: Manchester United, though, with yet another corner.\n8:22 Comment: One matter across to take this one, Smalling arrives.\n8:26 Comment: And it's a penalty area.\n8:27 Comment: Martial was the near-post target,\n8:30 Comment: and it was Fernandes this time with the challenge.\n8:37 Comment: Swung in by Mata again.\n8:39 Comment: Berezutski's clearance only fell to Anthony Martial.\n8:44 Comment: Here's Mata.\n8:46 Comment: Napco was in there for CSKA.\n8:51 Comment: There's Marcus Rojo.\n8:56 Comment: There's...\n8:57 Comment: Wehr.\n9:1 Comment: The CSKA Moscow substitution is about to be made.\n9:5 Comment: Seydou Doumbia the big threat, the man who scored for CSKA\n9:9 Comment: against Manchester United a couple of weeks ago,\n9:11 Comment: he's going to be coming on,\n9:13 Comment: and Napco, who's had very little influence on the game tonight,\n9:16 Comment: is going to be the player who goes off.\n9:18 Comment: Smalling with some defending to do in front of Moussa.\n9:26 Comment: Presume as well, Michael, that that change will mean that Moussa goes into a more familiar wide position,\n9:30 Comment: with Tosic on one side and him on the other, Seydou Doumbia through the middle.\n9:34 Comment: It's a more balanced look to CSKA now, isn't it?\n9:37 Comment: Yeah, he's the main man, isn't he? Main goal threat.\n9:41 Comment: And I'm sure if he didn't have that muscle scare, he would have started tonight.\n9:46 Comment: But it's probably a risk.\n9:48 Comment: You know, if they felt he was fully fit, then he would have been starting, so let's see how he gets on.\n9:54 Comment: He's the top scorer this season, with 11 goals.\n9:55 Comment: On loan from Roma.\n9:57 Comment: And he's got a remarkable scoring record in the Champions League,\n10:1 Comment: 16 goals in 20 games, which on a goals-per-game ratio is better than Messi and Ronaldo.\n10:7 Comment: They've both played significantly more matches, but all the same it's a decent sample size.\n10:12 Comment: Here's Lingard for Manchester United.\n10:15 Comment: Takes on Fernandes.\n10:17 Comment: Ignacevic was across there too, and Tosic can clear it away.\n10:21 Comment: Blind to Roja.\n10:23 Comment: Now Schweinsteiger.\n10:25 Comment: Lifted through towards Anthony Martial.\n10:29 Comment: Martial lets it run, but the flag was up against the young Frenchman.\n10:38 Comment: Yeah, he's been offside a few too many times from my liking today, Martial.\n10:43 Comment: And you can see he is offside.\n10:46 Comment: I don't want to blame him so much for that one, if I'm honest.\n10:49 Comment: You can't really see what the men behind you are doing.\n10:55 Comment: Look at Rabide!\n10:57 Comment: I schon doit!\n11:0 Comment: yourself\n11:8 Comment: St transport of\n11:22 Comment: Valentina\n11:25 Comment: There's Glynne.\n11:31 Comment: Martial.\n11:33 Comment: Martial away from Ignacevic, and then...\n11:40 Comment: Carrick tried to nick it back there from Moussa,\n11:43 Comment: and has conceded the free kick.\n11:45 Comment: Start to wonder, Michael, whether Louis van Gaal\n11:49 Comment: will be thinking about his own substitutions.\n11:52 Comment: If there's one man who could potentially come on\n11:53 Comment: and change the way the game's being played.\n11:56 Comment: He did this in Moscow in the first game, didn't he, Fellaini?\n11:58 Comment: Manchester United were a bigger threat around the penalty area\n12:1 Comment: when he was on against CSKA.\n12:3 Comment: Yeah, Louis van Gaal tends to turn to Fellaini, doesn't he?\n12:7 Comment: He's the impact substitution.\n12:9 Comment: He gives them that little bit different.\n12:11 Comment: The aerial prowess, the strength.\n12:15 Comment: He's obviously been told to go and get warmed up.\n12:19 Comment: Milan off to Moussa, it's going to fall here for Dumbia.\n12:21 Comment: Chris Smalling was able to get a really important...\n12:23 Comment: ...challenge him on the CSKA Moscow substitute.\n12:28 Comment: They might just have to sharpen up the concentration back there,\n12:30 Comment: the Manchester United defenders, now that Dumbia's off.\n12:33 Comment: I can't believe Dumbia didn't hit that one first time.\n12:36 Comment: He was just dropping perfectly on his left foot.\n12:38 Comment: All he had to do was strike through it,\n12:40 Comment: he would have got natural topspin on the ball.\n12:43 Comment: It's really surprising, a goal scorer like him,\n12:46 Comment: his eyes didn't light up when he had the opportunity.\n12:48 Comment: Here's Lingard, his eyes are lighting up on the run into the penalty area.\n12:51 Comment: Verne Bloom across.\n12:53 Comment: The penalty shirt was being pulled there by Pontus Verne Bloom.\n12:57 Comment: The Polish referee disagreed.\n13:1 Comment: Carrick to Martial, who was looking to play it forward quickly towards Rooney,\n13:4 Comment: and only picked out Ignatyevich.\n13:8 Comment: Not the greatest of lay-offs for Martial,\n13:9 Comment: but those balls that Michael Carrick just feeds into the centre-forwards\n13:13 Comment: are just poetry of motion, they're great to watch.\n13:16 Comment: He's got great vision and great disguise in his pass.\n13:20 Comment: He can be looking one way and just almost hook it around the corner into the striker's feet.\n13:23 Comment: It's a killer ball to defend.\n13:35 Comment: Here's Rojo.\n13:45 Comment: Carrick threading it forward towards Mata this time,\n13:47 Comment: although Shenykov could step in.\n13:51 Comment: Milanov here to Moussa.\n13:53 Comment: And there we see the acceleration from Moussa,\n13:56 Comment: in it goes towards Dumbia,\n13:58 Comment: and David De Gea had to step forward there,\n14:0 Comment: we've been talking about the pace tonight that Moussa's got.\n14:4 Comment: And now he can get isolated on the full-back,\n14:6 Comment: it could be a big problem for Manchester United.\n14:8 Comment: That was great football.\n14:11 Comment: Moussa, I've never seen pace like that for a long, long time.\n14:14 Comment: Chris Smalling is not slow, and he's absolutely skinned him.\n14:21 Comment: This is a little challenge early,\n14:23 Comment: when Lingard went through, you can see the shirt being pulled.\n14:27 Comment: Unless Lingard goes down, he's never gonna get a penalty there,\n14:30 Comment: referees just won't give it.\n14:33 Comment: Then it goes from Ashley Young,\n14:35 Comment: and away by Berezutski for CSKA Moscow,\n14:37 Comment: you can see why Lingard was asking the question, though, can't you?\n14:49 Comment: Here's Carrick.\n14:50 Comment: Now, Matip.\n14:58 Comment: Not quite the determination in this second half\n15:0 Comment: to get bodies in the penalty area for Manchester United,\n15:3 Comment: as we saw in the first.\n15:5 Comment: That's given away by Michael Carrick to Mario Fernandes.\n15:12 Comment: Lovely skill there by Dumbia, although read by Daley Blind.\n15:18 Comment: Changed the dynamic, though, hasn't it, now,\n15:19 Comment: with Moussa getting the support from Dumbia,\n15:21 Comment: two players who were very, very effective on the counter-attack.\n15:24 Comment: Yeah, they were lightning fast in the first game in Moscow.\n15:28 Comment: And there is a threat when you've got pace.\n15:30 Comment: No defender wants to defend against pace,\n15:32 Comment: it's the worst thing you can defend against.\n15:35 Comment: Manchester United just gotta keep possession,\n15:37 Comment: make sure they don't serve any bullets to Moscow now.\n15:40 Comment: There's Lingard.\n15:41 Comment: Started to open up for him, the door was closed, though, by Fernandes.\n15:46 Comment: Moussa challenged effectively by Michael Carrick, here's Choupo.\n15:49 Comment: And there's Jesse Lingard, Manchester United dominating the possession.\n15:52 Comment: Still looking for the breakthrough.\n15:55 Comment: Young.\n15:57 Comment: Mata.\n16:2 Comment: Now Rojo.\n16:4 Comment: Schweinsteiger.\n16:7 Comment: Out towards Ashley Young, who is offside.\n16:10 Comment: Yeah.\n16:11 Comment: Inexcusable.\n16:12 Comment: Really is inexcusable, I know he's saying he's not.\n16:15 Comment: I hope he's not for his sake, because it's really poor play if he is.\n16:19 Comment: He's looking right across and he is offside, it's poor play from Ashley Young.\n16:30 Comment: Interesting scoreline coming in in this group, Michael,\n16:32 Comment: Group D.\n16:33 Comment: PSV Eindhoven are 1-0 up against Wolfsburg,\n16:35 Comment: which would make a tight group even tighter.\n16:40 Comment: The start of the night, PSV Eindhoven were bottom with three points\n16:43 Comment: and Wolfsburg were top with six, so...\n16:46 Comment: If it stays like that,\n16:47 Comment: and this game stays at 0-0,\n16:50 Comment: then all of the sides of the group will be within a point of each other\n16:53 Comment: with a couple of games to go.\n16:56 Comment: He's got to try and find a way\n16:59 Comment: to get Manchester United the goal that they need,\n17:1 Comment: which could potentially tonight put them in control of Group B.\n17:7 Comment: Moussa's going to try it,\n17:8 Comment: and you'll need to be sharp to beat David de Gea from that kind of range.\n17:11 Comment: Yeah, you can see what he was thinking.\n17:13 Comment: And to be fair to David de Gea, he knew it.\n17:16 Comment: He knew he was a little bit out of his goal\n17:19 Comment: and made the sharp sprint back,\n17:21 Comment: and I think he had it covered even if he was onside.\n17:23 Comment: He tried one of those in the first game, didn't he?\n17:25 Comment: He had to backpedal and tip it over, David de Gea.\n17:32 Comment: Here's Rooney, he's been quiet tonight.\n17:37 Comment: Now Mata.\n17:41 Comment: Mata trying to move away from Milanoff, and he does do,\n17:43 Comment: and then Rooney lays it back into Mata,\n17:45 Comment: and the flag goes up.\n17:46 Comment: Hakenfeife was across anyway.\n17:53 Comment: More frustration, Michael, for Manchester United.\n17:56 Comment: Yeah, they're knocking on the door, aren't they?\n17:58 Comment: They're going to get the odd half chance.\n18:0 Comment: I mean, it's been the story of Manchester United season, really.\n18:3 Comment: We see Fellaini getting stripped.\n18:5 Comment: They can have a lot of possession, they can create one or two chances,\n18:8 Comment: they don't tear teams apart, though, do they?\n18:10 Comment: They don't really penetrate.\n18:12 Comment: And it's been the same story tonight.\n18:15 Comment: They've looked better to me on the eye so far,\n18:18 Comment: but they don't really look as if they're going to score at every attacking opportunity.\n18:23 Comment: Martial again, you know, he's got to learn to stand up and front up as players\n18:28 Comment: when they get the ball and they're looking for support.\n18:31 Comment: Zagarev, seems to be more desire from CSK Moscow to try and win the game since Dumbia came on.\n18:36 Comment: What Manchester United would give for a player with taste like Moussa\n18:40 Comment: would really bring a different dimension to what at times could be a pretty good team.\n18:45 Comment: And that's what we're seeing.\n18:47 Comment: We're seeing a plodding attacking side.\n18:49 Comment: We are hearing that Anthony Martial is going to be the player to come off when Fellaini comes on.\n18:59 Comment: Ojo beaten to it by Fernandes, and then Dumbia at the tossage, although he used an arm.\n19:15 Comment: But, you know, he's got to be prepared to run and announce what he can do or show sort of a\n19:16 Comment: goal-breaking.\n19:17 Comment: But I think FC cheesecake does there have been some practical tasks he or she has to go through\n19:21 Comment: with to see that he's not not\n19:29 Comment: Sure enough, Solon of action and things I get Rudy\n19:35 Comment: derzukski it's seen that won it back.\n19:36 Comment: Milanov can then bring it forward Rudy's fouled him.\n19:39 Comment: Run Li might not have that\n20:15 Comment: Fellaini's gonna come on and as you mentioned Darren, Martial coming off,\n20:20 Comment: I think that's quite surprising, you can hear what the crowd think of that as well.\n20:23 Comment: A few boos around, someone that's probably the likeliest goalscorer on the pitch to get one,\n20:31 Comment: and they brought him off, so I don't think it's strange that Fellaini's come on,\n20:36 Comment: I think it's strange that Martial's come off.\n20:38 Comment: It's Ignacevic to clear, we'll see what the introduction of Marouane Fellaini can do to the game,\n20:49 Comment: it led to a Manchester United equaliser in Moscow a fortnight ago, can it lead to a winning goal tonight?\n20:56 Comment: Both of these teams are wearing black armbands that you'll have noticed tonight,\n21:4 Comment: it's a mark of respect following the tragic crash of the Russian pass,\n21:8 Comment: a passenger plane in Egypt last Saturday which claimed the lives of 224 people,\n21:13 Comment: so respect being shown by both of these clubs here at Old Trafford tonight.\n21:23 Comment: Carrick looking for Marcus Rojo, the last touch came off Fernandes,\n21:30 Comment: there's Fellaini, Fellaini got that really important goal in the play-off against Club Bruges\n21:38 Comment: earlier in the game.\n21:38 Comment: It's Fellaini, Fellaini got that really important goal in the play-off against Club Bruges earlier in the game.\n21:41 Comment: Now Young.\n21:44 Comment: Forward it goes towards Lingard and away by Fernandes and then cleared by Tosic,\n21:49 Comment: and Tosic is caught as well by Rojo.\n21:53 Comment: Just over 23 minutes to go, Michael, and frustration and tension growing around Old Trafford.\n22:0 Comment: Yeah, I mean it's reasonably comfortable in terms of, at the other end,\n22:4 Comment: David De Gea's goal has not really been tested too much,\n22:8 Comment: but as you say, these fans are going to be slightly nervous now,\n22:13 Comment: they're expecting to come here and get the three points,\n22:15 Comment: still got a bit of time to do it.\n22:23 Comment: There's Carrick, of course the crowd that Michael's talking about have been brought up so much\n22:28 Comment: and attacking football and lots of goals, it's a different era,\n22:32 Comment: different philosophy from the manager,\n22:35 Comment: and at the moment it's a method of playing that's not bringing,\n22:37 Comment: goals with any regularity for Manchester United.\n22:41 Comment: Here's Carrick.\n22:48 Comment: And Schweinsteiger.\n22:50 Comment: Forward it goes towards Rooney, Rooney between defenders, still battling for it,\n22:55 Comment: looked at the referee for a penalty,\n22:57 Comment: Horry signals his corner.\n23:0 Comment: Well he did so well, holds the ball up with his chest,\n23:4 Comment: well it's probably with his arm actually, there's definitely a shirt pull,\n23:7 Comment: but he stays on his feet at that point and then goes down without being touched.\n23:11 Comment: He goes down as his shirt's being pulled, he might have got that one,\n23:14 Comment: but certainly not afterwards, once he stayed on his feet, that was the end of that.\n23:19 Comment: Manchester United with a corner at the Stretford end, Rooney out to take it.\n23:23 Comment: In it goes towards Fellaini, away by Wernblum, and then cleared further by Milanov.\n23:29 Comment: Only Ashley Young there to retrieve it.\n23:33 Comment: Forward towards Smalling, headed down by Smalling into what he hoped would be a dangerous area,\n23:37 Comment: and skidded through to Akinfea, who quickly wants to set CSKA Moscow on their way with Milanov.\n23:44 Comment: And now Moussa...\n23:47 Comment: ...the speed to accelerate away from Young, he was pulling at him.\n23:52 Comment: It's noticeable, Michael, that since we saw the acceleration from Moussa,\n23:55 Comment: whenever the ball goes forward, Ashley Young is as tight to him as he can possibly be.\n23:59 Comment: Yeah, you've got to do that with quick players.\n24:2 Comment: Make sure they don't spin off you to start with, and if they don't, then make sure they're tight,\n24:5 Comment: because if they turn and get a...\n24:7 Comment: ...a little run at you, then you're in big trouble.\n24:10 Comment: PSV Eindhoven leading.\n24:11 Comment: There could be a situation at the end of the game tonight where two sides have got six points,\n24:17 Comment: and two sides have got five points, and both of them will have a couple of games to play.\n24:22 Comment: Manchester United's final home matches against PSV, who beat them on Matchday 1,\n24:28 Comment: and they'll travel to Germany to take on Wolfsburg in the last round of group games.\n24:32 Comment: And all of the four sides still in with a very realistic chance of qualifying for the last six games.\n24:37 Comment: And of course of winning the group as well, which would enable Duke to avoid the big guns.\n24:42 Comment: Here's Rocha, dangerous ball in towards Fellaini, away though by Zagoev.\n24:49 Comment: Doumbier to Milanov, Moussa playing off the shoulder here of Blind.\n24:54 Comment: Fellaini did enough to stop the ball going his way, but here's Tosic.\n24:57 Comment: Tosic through towards Doumbier, and eventually a combination of Smalling and Blind able to get it away,\n25:3 Comment: but they weren't quite sure about that, were they, at the back, Manchester United?\n25:7 Comment: No.\n25:8 Comment: Moussa wins it back, here's Tosic, he had that spell here as a youngster, making it 20-10.\n25:20 Comment: Fernandes forward towards Moussa, away by Marcus Rojo, who's significantly taller.\n25:28 Comment: And Zagoev, the Russian international, tackle made on him by Ashley Young, and Fellaini.\n25:37 Comment: And here's Moussa, the first goal of the season for Manchester United.\n25:40 Comment: Lingard, crowd urging Manchester United forward.\n25:43 Comment: Less than 20 minutes to go, Lingard on the move.\n25:47 Comment: Mata and Rooney, here is Mata, can he tee up his captain?\n25:50 Comment: He can! Rooney once, Rooney twice, can't finish it.\n25:55 Comment: Zagoev able to get it away, will Manchester United have a better opportunity?\n26:4 Comment: Well, that's great play down the left-hand side there from Lingard,\n26:6 Comment: lovely little threatening pass, good run, two players made the same run.\n26:11 Comment: As you say, what an opportunity there, Wain could have just got his feet right.\n26:15 Comment: Well, Lingard.\n26:18 Comment: Fernandes got something on him.\n26:20 Comment: Mata, Rojo, Schweinsteiger.\n26:27 Comment: A yellow wall between Manchester United and Akinfeyev's goal.\n26:30 Comment: Fellaini.\n26:33 Comment: Shevnikov over there.\n26:35 Comment: Here's Berezutski who can clear, and then Milanov helps it away.\n26:40 Comment: What an opportunity for the Manchester United captain.\n26:42 Comment: Yeah, you can see what he was trying to do,\n26:44 Comment: just trying to shuffle it from left foot to right foot,\n26:46 Comment: cos he was under pressure, he couldn't shoot straight away,\n26:48 Comment: he would have got blocked.\n26:50 Comment: So he had the composure, he just couldn't quite get it out of his feet.\n26:54 Comment: Rooney to Lord Mata, Shevnikov there for CSKA.\n26:59 Comment: Now Ashley Young.\n27:2 Comment: Still Ashley Young.\n27:3 Comment: Shevnikov catches in.\n27:4 Comment: The referee has a look, hasn't made his mind up.\n27:7 Comment: Now he points for a goal kick.\n27:10 Comment: One or two in the Stretford end, Michael, thought that was a point for the penalty spot.\n27:17 Comment: Well, good feeling, I haven't seen it yet, only live, good feeling as that was a dive.\n27:24 Comment: Look, he's going down already, yeah, and he's thrown his leg into Shevnikov.\n27:29 Comment: We've seen that before from Ashley Young, I think the referee,\n27:33 Comment: and in fact his assistant behind the goal more likely,\n27:36 Comment: has got that one absolutely bob on.\n27:39 Comment: Had a really good think about it, didn't he, as well, before he made his decision.\n27:43 Comment: The correct decision.\n27:46 Comment: Here's Rooney, Memphis preparing to come on for Manchester United.\n27:51 Comment: Jesse Lingard, caught napping by Tosic, and then away by Ignacevic.\n27:56 Comment: How CSKA Moscow need his experience in what remains of the match, 17 minutes or so.\n28:3 Comment: Schweinsteiger forwards, Shevnikov, who always seems to be in the right place,\n28:7 Comment: doesn't he, defensively, his positional sense in the left-back is impeccable, isn't it?\n28:11 Comment: Yeah, he's obviously got booked early on in the game,\n28:15 Comment: but he's done really well since, as we see.\n28:18 Comment: Manchester United making another substitution,\n28:20 Comment: Memphis coming on for Mata this time.\n28:28 Comment: Memphis' best performances in the Manchester United shirt have been in this competition.\n28:33 Comment: The word was that he wouldn't be available tonight.\n28:37 Comment: Louis van Gaal explained the reasoning behind that to Dez before the match,\n28:40 Comment: and he's on now, Memphis,\n28:42 Comment: who was left out of the Dutch squad by Danny Blind,\n28:45 Comment: who said that he's one for the future but he's got to become more of a team player.\n28:50 Comment: Manchester United will take a moment of individual brilliance\n28:53 Comment: from the big-money summer signing tonight.\n28:58 Comment: He's come down onto the left-hand side as well, so...\n29:1 Comment: That means Lingard has gone out onto the right.\n29:5 Comment: Here is Memphis from Schweinsteiger,\n29:9 Comment: and it goes towards Fellaini, away by Berezinski,\n29:12 Comment: and then Michael Carrick on the volley, inches away!\n29:15 Comment: Sweetly struck from Michael Carrick, couldn't quite find the corner.\n29:20 Comment: Yeah, they build into momentum,\n29:22 Comment: Manchester United, you always thought, as the ball's dropping in the air,\n29:26 Comment: a little bit like someone like Paul Scholes,\n29:28 Comment: you just know that he's not going to hit this.\n29:31 Comment: Far off the target, he's got this in the locker all

in,\n30:4 Comment: but at this point you can't kick the ball through someone.\n30:7 Comment: The problem is he's got all his weight on his left-hand side\n30:10 Comment: and he's trying to bring the ball from left to right,\n30:13 Comment: so he almost needs to be a little bit more nimble on his feet\n30:16 Comment: to go shift it from one to the other.\n30:24 Comment: Away by Blind,\n30:26 Comment: Xhaka there forward towards Doumbier,\n30:29 Comment: here's Schweinsteiger,\n30:31 Comment: less than 15 minutes to go.\n30:35 Comment: Blind forward to Fellaini,\n30:37 Comment: now

deeper but not that deep.\n31:20 Comment: Looks awful when it happens, doesn't it, but...\n31:23 Comment: I can see what he's trying to do, whip it in with plenty of pace.\n31:26 Comment: When you do that sometimes it'll just bounce up a little bit high or...\n31:29 Comment: get a little bobble.\n31:31 Comment: And it'll make it look a bit stupid.\n31:33 Comment: So we're coming up, highlights

smothered, doesn't he, from De Gea.\n32:32 Comment: And nobody gives up, it's a brilliant save,\n32:35 Comment: and that's what top goalkeepers are all about,\n32:37 Comment: making themselves big, have not much to do all game,\n32:40 Comment: and then he goes and does that,\n32:41 Comment: and what about Chris Smalling and Ashley Young there?\n32:43 Comment: In goes the corner, Fellaini defends it,\n32:46 Comment: Memphis helps it off.\n32:48 Comment: There's Lingard.\n32:52 Comment: That was a heart-in-your-mouth moment for the Manchester United supporters,\n32:56 Comment: and for the players as well.\n32:58 Comment: Now, Dumbia is usually deadly in those situations.\n33:2 Comment: First De Gea, and then Smalling.\n33:5 Comment: The warning that Manchester United cannot switch off

Carrick.\n34:1 Comment: But that left Jesse Lingard.\n34:3 Comment: And I talk all the time about an early pass into the box,\n34:7 Comment: and that's exactly what centre-forwards need.\n34:10 Comment: And Lingard, he takes a risk.\n34:12 Comment: You have to take risks in the final third.\n34:15 Comment: And he plays an exquisite ball.\n34:17 Comment: Bang on to Wayne Rooney's head.\n34:20 Comment: People can doubt him, but he doesn't mess from that.\n34:23 Comment: Look at this for a ball.\n34:25 Comment: Absolutely perfect, and he thumps it past.\n34:27 Comment: Akinfeyev.\n34:29

Akinfeyev with a really good save.\n35:36 Comment: It's been an electric last couple of minutes,\n35:39 Comment: and it's Rose reverse from the goal.\n35:42 Comment: Now Rooney feeding Lingard, great little reverse pass.\n35:45 Comment: Lingard does pretty well.\n35:47 Comment: You'd expect the goalkeeper to save it, and he does.\n35:54 Comment: Here's Memphis.\n35:55 Comment: The

above Wolfsburg,\n37:2 Comment: who were trailing to PSV Eindhoven\n37:4 Comment: and put them very much in control of the group.\n37:10 Comment: And Milanov has stayed down.\n37:12 Comment: Referee allows the play to carry on.\n37:14 Comment: Lingard's ball in, and Akinfeyev with a comfortable play.\n37:23 Comment: Fellaini gets there first.\n37:40 Comment: Catches Zagarev in the process.\n37:42 Comment: I was looking, Michael, if you're a CSKA Moscow player,\n37:44 Comment: it's not a bad week to collect your air miles.\n37:47 Comment: I think it's something like a 3,200-mile round trip\n37:49 Comment: from Moscow to Manchester.\n37:51 Comment: Then they go to Krasnodar in a league game on Sunday,\n37:54 Comment: which is another 1,500 miles.\n37:56 Comment: So if any team can complain about travelling this week,\n38:0 Comment: it's CSKA Moscow, something like 5,000 miles\n38:3 Comment: to play two football matches.\n38:7 Comment: And they're trailing in this one.\n38:9 Comment: Zagarev through towards Dumbia.\n38:11 Comment: And David De Gea quickly spotted the danger.\n38:21 Comment: Oh, look out.\n38:42 Comment: And what a guy?\n38:48 Comment: Pretty good catch, eh?\n38:50 Comment: FULL-TIME WHISTLE\n38:54 Comment: Drill forward here towards Fernandes, who gets up above Marcus Rojo.\n38:58 Comment: Away by Blind.\n39:2 Comment: Rooney's done well, now he can test his pace against Alexey Berezutskiy.\n39:8 Comment: Schweinsteiger.\n39:12 Comment: Second goal would make certain.\n39:20 Comment: FULL-TIME WHISTLE\n39:29 Comment: Away by Fernandes, and then returned by Marcus Rojo.\n39:32 Comment: Rooney is going to be given offside here.\n39:38 Comment: The group as it stands, if you look at it,\n39:41 Comment: Manchester United, as it is at the moment, will be top on seven points.\n39:47 Comment: And then Wolfsburg and PSV Eindhoven level on six\n39:50 Comment: with CLB.\n39:50 Comment: CSKA Moscow bringing up the rear.\n39:53 Comment: Still plenty of work to do, but all of a sudden it looks...\n39:57 Comment: that much more comfortable for Louis van Gaal's side.\n40:10 Comment: And Danchenko is on for CSKA.\n40:13 Comment: Looking to get on the ball here too.\n40:15 Comment: Smalling with a tackle.\n40:20 Comment: Good ball, good ball.\n40:25 Comment: There is Danchenko.\n40:26 Comment: He was started at the weekend but was left out tonight.\n40:30 Comment: And Wernblum.\n40:31 Comment: Schweinsteiger trying to win it back, Wernblum too strong for him.\n40:35 Comment: Now Moussa.\n40:38 Comment: Wernblum with a shot, it's not

right.\n40:53 Comment: Virtually impossible to get past him, and then you see Young slipping.\n40:59 Comment: So then you get a slide from Chris Small and it just goes round the post.\n41:3 Comment:

best this season, but when you need a big goal and you need a big moment,\n41:19 Comment: When you need a big goal and you need a big moment,\n41:20 Comment: it's often been down the years, the Manchester United captain who stepped up to provide it.\n41:28 Comment: Louis van Gaal preparing his final change, he's going to send on Ander Herrera for what remains of the match.\n41:35 Comment: Manchester United with this 1-0 lead, a vital 1-0 lead as well in the context of Group B.\n41:44 Comment: We've got West Brom at home and Watford away in the Premier League, either side of the international break.\n41:49 Comment: Before the game here again.\n41:51 Comment: And now it's a 3-0 win against PSV Eindhoven in three weeks' time.\n41:57 Comment: Given away by Rooney to the dangerous Moussa,\n42:1 Comment: who wants to test his pace here against Marcus Rojo.\n42:5 Comment: You know how quick Moussa is, he did well there, Rojo, Michael.\n42:7 Comment: Yeah, he was always gaining, wasn't he, Moussa, but when you're a defender,\n42:11 Comment: you always get your goal side, you get that little head start, and he did well.\n42:14 Comment: You almost got to run round the defender as well as pass him, haven't you?\n42:18 Comment: Schweinsteiger to Rooney.\n42:20 Comment: He can turn, he needs some support,\n42:22 Comment: Doonbeer it is, of all people, back there winning the ball back for CSKA Moscow.\n42:36 Comment: That's Fernandes, who's been nothing like the threat as an attacking player,\n42:40 Comment: but he was the first time the sides met.\n42:43 Comment: And they're relying on his defensive duties tonight, the Brazilian.\n42:50 Comment: Santos Mour GOAL\n43:2 Comment: Smalling away.\n43:5 Comment: Lingard over there with Chernykov.\n43:12 Comment: And here's the last Manchester United change.\n43:15 Comment: And Amerika Herrera, the Spaniard is coming long.\n43:20 Comment: And Mastian Schweinsteiger, who's done a good job alongside Michael Carrick\n43:25 Comment: in central midfield tonight,\n43:27 Comment: is coming off to a standing ovation here at Old Trafford.\n43:32 Comment: Yeah, I think you're right, Darren, they have done a good job in there,\n43:35 Comment: because when you consider a lot of teams nowadays don't want to play the 4-4-2 formation\n43:39 Comment: because it leaves you a little bit empty in that midfield,\n43:42 Comment: but I think Michael Carrick and Schweinsteiger have handled the numbers of Moscow in there,\n43:48 Comment: they haven't looked outnumbered at all,\n43:50 Comment: in fact they've got their game going really well,\n43:52 Comment: and that's enabled the two strikers to have a little bit of freedom.\n44:1 Comment: TSV Eindhoven have got a second goal against Wolfsburg,\n44:4 Comment: so it looks as though the Dutch side are going to win that one.\n44:6 Comment: TSV Eindhoven leading Wolfsburg by two goals to nil,\n44:10 Comment: Manchester United leading here by a goal to nil,\n44:12 Comment: so they will end tonight,\n44:14 Comment: provided they can keep CSKA Moscow out for what remains of this match,\n44:18 Comment: the last few seconds plus three additional minutes,\n44:21 Comment: they'll be top of Group B with two games to go,\n44:24 Comment: a position that he's found himself in on numerous occasions down the years.\n44:30 Comment: The man sat next to him tonight will have been impressed by that save from David de Gea,\n44:34 Comment: and Eric Steele, who played such an important part in his development when he came here.\n44:38 Comment: Yeah, that's right, I know he had a big say in what goalkeeper they were going to choose\n44:43 Comment: following the retirement of Edwin van der Sar,\n44:47 Comment: and you'd have to say he's been a big fan of his.\n44:47 Comment: He's picked right, Hasni, what a goalkeeper this kid is.\n44:53 Comment: Manchester United can see the finish line,\n44:55 Comment: with that big goal from

    "summary": "It was a rainy and tense evening at Old Trafford where Manchester United faced off against CSKA Moscow in a crucial Champions League group stage match. Amidst the soaked atmosphere and the unyielding Old Trafford faithful, the Red Devils eventually managed to secure a hard-fought 1-0 victory, a result that put them in a strong position to advance to the knockout stages.\n\nFrom the very onset, it was clear this match carried weighty expectations. Right at the start, a minor tension in the Manchester United camp was noted due to the absence of some key starters, which left fans a bit apprehensive. However, with a striking lineup including Wayne Rooney and Anthony Martial, the home side pressed aggressively.\n\nIn the initial stages, both teams sought to establish their rhythm, and Manchester United's defense had a particularly shaky moment when David De Gea's clearance was unusual for his normally composed style. Despite that, the home team began to assert dominance in possession. The early strategy from the visitors seemed defensive, opting to play deep and trying to catch Manchester United on the counter, a tactic which had worked for them before.\n\nManchester United's front line repeatedly tested CSKA Moscow's defense. Lingard's agility and attempts on goal were relentless, while Martial played centrally, supported by Rooney and Juan Mata from the flanks. Despite the fluidity, the Russian side held their ground, marshaled effectively by their veteran defenders Ignacevic and Berezutski.\n\nAround the third-minute mark, Michael Carrick's accurate passing fed Rooney, emphasizing the immediate intent of the Red Devils to draw first blood. Rooney's attempts, though potent, lacked the required finish. The crowd's excitement bubbled as Rooney edged close to a historic record, just one goal behind Dennis Law's tally for Manchester United in all competitions and two away from Ruud van Nistelrooy’s European mark.\n\nCSKA Moscow, although largely pinned back, showcased their competence in ball handling through Milanov and Shagoev – both players doing their best to break United's fluid passing patterns. The tempo from Manchester United was intent, driven by frequent overlaps from their full-backs, Rojo and Young. Evidence of tactical flexibility appeared as United's manager seemed to mix formations, oscillating between a 4-4-2 and a variation that saw Rooney spend time in deeper central positions.\n\nWithin the first 20 minutes, CSKA Moscow's threat on the counter became evident, capitalizing on Manchester's forward surges. Tosic, a former Manchester United player, orchestrated these endeavours with precise link-ups. As the half progressed, CSKA held firm, denying United clear goal-scoring chances. With each failed attempt, frustration began to build within Old Trafford.\n\nRooney's pivotal moment came with a strong effort around the 35th minute, showing a hunger that characterized his performance throughout the match. United’s wide players, including Lingard, frequently found themselves in promising positions but lacked the cutting edge to break down the resilient CSKA defense. Fernandes, often aggressive in his forward drives from the right-back position, highlighted this duel, clashing multiple times with Lingard.\n\nTowards the end of the first half, one could argue that Manchester United was the dominant force. Their possession statistics proved favorable, yet, paradoxically, failed to yield the much-needed lead. The halftime whistle left Louis van Gaal's side unsatisfied but resolute, while CSKA Moscow was content holding on while hoping to capitalize on a break.\n\nAs the second half resumed, the stage was set for adjustments. CSKA Moscow introduced Seydou Doumbia, a known threat with an impressive goal ratio in the Champions League. His presence immediately added a sense of urgency and danger to the visiting side. Meanwhile, United maintained their offensive strategy, yet their build-up play occasionally fell flat, leading to some misplaced passes and turnovers.\n\nSchweinsteiger played an essential role, anchoring the midfield and frequently tried to quicken the attacks with incisive forward passes. Rooney, although quieter compared to his typically explosive form, remained key in orchestrating attacks. Another notable substitution was the introduction of Fellaini for Martial around the 70th minute. The move was initially met with some boos from the fans, questioning the removal of the dynamic French striker, but van Gaal’s strategy to inject physicality in the form of Fellaini would later prove pivotal.\n\nThe match reached a high pitch in the 76th minute when a CSKA counterattack almost yielded a goal. Doumbia found himself one-on-one with De Gea, but the Spanish goalkeeper showcased his legendary shot-stopping prowess. Moments later, Chris Smalling made a game-defining slide tackle, preventing Doumbia from scoring on the rebound. This defensive solidity perhaps injected a new burst of energy and determination into United's ranks.\n\nOnce the game restarted, it took only a few moments for Manchester United to finally break the deadlock. Carrick, instrumental in midfield control, released a perfectly weighted pass that found Jesse Lingard on the right. Demonstrating maturity beyond his years, Lingard delivered a finely-timed early cross into the box. Wayne Rooney, who had positioned himself expertly between the defenders, rose to meet the ball with a well-directed header, thumping it past the CSKA keeper. This goal not only gave United the lead but also saw Rooney equaling Dennis Law's goal-scoring record.\n\nManchester United’s forward momentum appeared revitalized post-goal. Lingard almost doubled the lead shortly after, producing another on-target effort saved by Akinfeyev. The Red Devils maintained sustained pressure, with the flirtation of doubling the lead ever present.\n\nThe introduction of Memphis provided additional sparks in wide areas, although some crosses evaded their intended targets, adding to the collective tension within Old Trafford. As the match edged closer towards its conclusion, Saint-Etienne's never-say-die attitude meant that the defensive pair of Smalling and Blind had to remain vigilant.\n\nNoch-paced action persisted till the final whistle. Manchester United’s astute ball retention and arresting play saw them earn a series of corners and maintain the general play. On the other hand, CSKA’s sporadic counters, led primarily by the lightning-fast Moussa, kept the United defense on high alert. Notably, Moussa's threat was mitigated primarily by some clever defending and positional sense from Rojo and Young.\n\nWhen the final whistle blew, relief mixed with jubilant applause swept across Old Trafford. Manchester United had managed to claim a crucial victory. The solitary goal by Rooney proved enough in a match characterized by defensive solidity from the visitors and dogged persistence from the hosts.\n\nOverall, Manchester United’s successful night hinged upon a combination of tactical discipline, crucial defensive interventions, and a moment of magic from their captain Wayne Rooney. This win propelled them to the top of the group standings, facilitating a more favorable position heading into the latter stages of the competition. The evening also highlighted the enduring match-winning prowess of their captain and the resilience of a team still gelling under new tactical paradigms."
