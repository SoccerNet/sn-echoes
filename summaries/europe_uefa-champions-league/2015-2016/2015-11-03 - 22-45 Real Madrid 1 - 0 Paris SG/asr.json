football on antenna 3\n0:37 Comment: The first ball for Paris Saint Germain, the Bernabéu is starting to whistle, ah!\n0:40 Comment: Of course, you have to put pressure on from the first minute, plus there are a lot of French fans, 4,000 have come here\n0:46 Comment: 4,000, it is the 5% that FIFA always reserves for rival fans and practically, well no, practically not, they have taken all the tickets\n0:55 Comment: Some have even come without a ticket, but evidently Paris Saint Germain has also taken the initiative for Real Madrid in the first round match\n1:4 Comment: And he has given those tickets in a nominative way, so that no one sneaks in, so that we don't want to be in a football stadium to await the party.\n1:14 Comment: Matuidi plays, version up, Iscol, ball goes again to David Luiz, plays to the left for Mascuel, ball on the wing, Paris Saint Germain hits\n1:19 Comment: Ball leaks, Matuidi comes there, frees up the space for Ibra, France's eleven are coming there now, he wants to play the ball there\n1:26 Comment: Therefore the procedure is for the Uruguayan, Gabbani recovers Real Madrid, Isco comes, stops him, the referee says there is no foul\n1:33 Comment: Thiago Mota recovers, essential in the Paris Saint Germain midfield\n1:36 Comment: A player who has an incredible performance, has gone further in his career, there was a moment when he was very damaged by injuries during his time at Barça.\n1:44 Comment: But right now he is an undisputed player, a player who is also a reference in the passing game, he does not lose the ball, he always passes, cuts, he partners very well with Marco Berratti\n1:52 Comment: Then in defense, he is in charge of the tactical foul\n1:54 Comment: Danger there between the lines, Ibaría, the ex-Madrid player, wins, plays the ball to the right, Aubrier comes, the ball is now in front of Marcelo, the referee says it is the ball for Madrid\n2:5 Comment: First two minutes of the game, Laurent Blanc was surprised by Real Madrid's departure at the Parc des Princes\n2:11 Comment: Let's see how Paris Saint Germain comes out, at the moment we already see the team quite high up, the lines very close together, Guti\n2:17 Comment: Yes, well, I think that is what has to be asked of all the teams, that the lines be together to be able to apply good pressure\n2:22 Comment: They are playing the ball very well, they feel comfortable with the ball, yes, with a fairly slow pace\n2:28 Comment: And Real Madrid also feels comfortable not having the ball, because what they want is that, to go on the counterattack.\n2:35 Comment: Try to ensure that they have a lot of the ball and that they have losses in the center of the field so that we can take advantage of them with Márquez's men, both Cristiano and Gesé\n2:43 Comment: He plays the ball, there it is, he wants to turn, Danilo puts the ball up, the Brazilian, this summer's new signing for Real Madrid on the right\n2:50 Comment: Ball for Kroos, harassed by Mota and foul in favor of Magribarcos\n2:54 Comment: Well, Paris Saint Germain is a team that is defined by very long possessions of the ball, always short passes, it is the team in the Champions League that makes the most passes\n3:1 Comment: And it is more precise, they have players all of them on good footing, PSG's challenge is always to find depth\n3:7 Comment: The ball for Casemiro who opens the wing, PSG's first hour, now Gesé comes, he scores 1-1, heads-up, now he's going to win it, Gesé is coming, how fast the Canario is\n3:17 Comment: Uriel perfectly wins on the side, Gesé holds on, Uriel who the other day played as a center back, throw-in for PSG\n3:24 Comment: Gesé is very fast, but also very alone, I think the team has to support, they have taken advantage of a mistake on our part in defense to make a counter-good\n3:34 Comment: I think we have to be careful, especially when we get the ball out, because we can't lose many balls there, because they have great players up front who can do us a lot of damage.\n3:42 Comment: Jurgen Klopp said that the best midfielder is pressure in the opposite field, if you recover in the opposite field, with the opponent open it is very easy to make the last pass, any elite player can do it\n3:52 Comment: That's why recovery, if you lack that midfielder that you could do perfectly, if you push, well, you can find something\n3:59 Comment: In today's football, Guti would be even more of a king than he already was, even though at that time he made those decisive passes\n4:5 Comment: By the way, he is in the box, we saw the king of Spain, a great shot, from Cristiano, harassed there now by Berratti, by Thiago Mota, pinning him and in the end he won the ball\n4:16 Comment: Rafa Guerrero says there is no foul, ball for PSG\n4:20 Comment: Indeed, we already said before that it lets you play a lot\n4:26 Comment: Ball that plays from the defense leaving Thiago Silva, we have already talked about... it seems that those who remain are Berratti and also Mota and the one who comes and goes with dynamism Guti is Matuidi\n4:36 Comment: Yes, yes, well, very well, as Marco says, they are looking for Modric's back, I think Casimiro has to be more attentive to coverage\n4:43 Comment: He has to be more attentive to the coverage because in the end he is the link that has to be there to solve all the problems that both Modric and Kroos may have.\n4:53 Comment: The two footballers who compete between Maxwell and Isco Alarcón have fallen there\n4:57 Comment: And Di María has received some whistles in the previous dangerous play, but quite a bit of indifference with the Argentine player at the Bernabéu on his return\n5:6 Comment: Regarding the Rafa Guerrero play\n5:8 Comment: Well, for me it is not enough to decree a maximum sentence, in addition he has tried to continue, he has continued and for me there is nothing, very good Clatenburg\n5:17 Comment: A Di María moment playing along the entire front of attack, a footballer who is also closing Lucas Moura's place in Paris Saint Germain\n5:26 Comment: And that's where Kevin Trapp, the German, plays the ball, the one who took Sirigu's job\n5:31 Comment: Paris Saint Germain also lacked that, a good goalkeeper, at least a guaranteed goalkeeper to fight in the playoffs.\n5:36 Comment: Rafael Varane plays the ball, the Frenchman comes, indisputable also for Didier Deschamps\n5:39 Comment: The ball that is played short, the ball that goes backwards\n5:41 Comment: The ball that goes backwards, there it comes to touch for Sergio Ramos, what a battle as we saw in the previous one with our teammates also making those videos\n5:47 Comment: In that battle with Ibra in the first round match at the Parc des Princes just a couple of weeks ago\n5:53 Comment: Modric plays the ball, Modric behind, the ball goes to Danilo\n5:56 Comment: Danilo in short for Isco, wants to put speed again for Modric, the two geniuses now understand\n5:59 Comment: The ball is played by the man from Malaga, he delays there, there was a foul by Berratti, the referee doesn't say anything\n6:3 Comment: The ball goes back to Varane, Varane plays it again for Ramos, Real Madrid wants to go out\n6:6 Comment: The Camero's oriented control is extraordinary, it puts the ball high\n6:8 Comment: And Cristiano Ronaldo comes to receive, he plays inside, now practically playing 9\n6:13 Comment: The ball goes back to Casemiro, Casemiro returns, ball to Kroos, Kroos to Cristiano\n6:17 Comment: Cristiano to the left, ball there for Marcelo, one more to add to the attack\n6:20 Comment: Delay for Toni Kroos, the German is going to make the change, in the end he plays short, the ball for Casemiro\n6:24 Comment: Two controls to get the ball to the Brazilian, he plays it up, the ball goes to Cristiano, he wants to face\n6:28 Comment: Here comes Cristiano, ball on his back, loss for Gesé, Gesé associates\n6:31 Comment: Gesé wants to shoot, the spill is closed well by David Luiz, the ball goes to Danilo\n6:34 Comment: Danilo with Modric, what an eternal play by Madrid\n6:36 Comment: Modric holds on, the Croatian touches it, ball for Toni Kroos, Kroos closed there by Thiago Mota\n6:41 Comment: Ball to the left, Paris Saint Germain does not come out, Marcelo attacks, plays the wall with Cristiano\n6:45 Comment: He cut the ball to Di María at the top of the area, the duel with Cristiano is going to take it\n6:49 Comment: The Argentine holds on, Alfirio touches it, the ball is behind Mota, the ball goes to Uriel\n6:53 Comment: Uriel who plays for Berratti, Berratti up, ball for Ibra, for those tala, he plays with his back calmly\n6:57 Comment: Ball goes to Berratti, it comes to Maltinidi, central circle, played by Paris Saint Germain\n7:1 Comment: Ball again from Berratti to the left, and Cavani and Paris Saint Germain now attack Benítez's Madrid\n7:6 Comment: That two teams in the pass, very difficult to take the ball from one team or another\n7:10 Comment: They start playing, looking closely, and both are very precise.\n7:14 Comment: It seems that Madrid wants to wear down Paris Saint Germain by running after the ball\n7:19 Comment: Yes, they both suffer a lot when they don't have the ball, it is very difficult for them to recover.\n7:23 Comment: I have missed Real Madrid a lot in recent years, in the European Cup\n7:26 Comment: Those first 15-20 strong minutes, where they press high, where they intimidate the rival\n7:32 Comment: Where if a goal can be undone, I have missed it a lot\n7:35 Comment: I think that before we went out with more desire\n7:39 Comment: I see Real Madrid as very cold in these first minutes\n7:45 Comment: It shows that perhaps the responsibility, as Guti says, now passes to Madrid in the next one\n7:48 Comment: As happened to Paris Saint Germain perhaps in their home in the Parc des Princes\n7:52 Comment: Ball goes back there again, by the way there was a goal from Manchester City, bad news\n7:54 Comment: For ours, first goal of the night also in Seville, in Nervión\n7:58 Comment: Then we will see the most extensive summary in Mega of that Sevilla FC, Manchester City\n8:3 Comment: At the moment 0-1, Gesee plays the ball, Gesee Rodríguez comes\n8:6 Comment: There he goes in, he puts it, he came out bitten by Masguer, he claims the corner kick\n8:11 Comment: And finally the referee gives it\n8:14 Comment: First, Liniers did not raise the flag and at the end the corner kick for Madrid\n8:19 Comment: Yes, well I think that Madrid has a problem\n8:21 Comment: We are arriving well on the wings, the teams are arriving well\n8:24 Comment: Isco is coming along well, Gesee is coming along well\n8:27 Comment: Cristiano is getting into the area well but then there is a bit of help from Modric and Kroos.\n8:32 Comment: Of that second line that also arrives, practically when they arrive they have no one to pass to\n8:37 Comment: Kroos puts it, ball to the penalty spot\n8:39 Comment: The aerial strength so far has not paid off in the first play\n8:42 Comment: Stopped ball by Madrid in the first half of which we are already 9 minutes into the game\n8:45 Comment: Live on Antena 3, ball behind, the ball goes to Isco again\n8:49 Comment: Isco with Marcelo, Marcelo steps, drags and plays again for Isco\n8:51 Comment: The man from Malaga on the left, Matuidi comes\n8:52 Comment: It's going to come out between the two inside, the Spanish international footballer is coming\n8:56 Comment: He plays for Marcelo, Marcelo plays it short, he comes to Casemiro first, he returns\n8:59 Comment: Rafael Barandes comes hanging on the corner play, ball for Ramos\n9:2 Comment: Playing as a winger, Orier takes it to the far post\n9:5 Comment: Berratti comes, puts his head in, ball for Matuidi, what a brownie, two against him\n9:9 Comment: And in the end the Frenchman throws her out\n9:11 Comment: Be careful, with blood, with blood\n9:13 Comment: Be careful that the blow is stopped by the referee, Rafa Guerrero, as is perspective\n9:16 Comment: As you say Guas, with blood in the small area\n9:18 Comment: From the blow that Isco has suffered\n9:19 Comment: Isco is bleeding from his head right now, as you can see.\n9:22 Comment: And it is with Orier with the right side\n9:25 Comment: Well, they were both looking at the ball from then on the collision\n9:29 Comment: And now always how complicated it is to have to sew or those types of details\n9:34 Comment: If there is a team with ten\n9:36 Comment: That is along with health, which seems that both are fine\n9:39 Comment: The main thing, look, is that when he turns around, Isco doesn't see it, nor does he see it.\n9:43 Comment: He is there, Isco looking at the ball and Orier when he is clearing, right Guti?\n9:46 Comment: Yes, something that happens when going to the pool\n9:49 Comment: I mean, in football and well, it's much easier now, right?\n9:52 Comment: Because now they are staples and they staple you in the moment, right?\n9:55 Comment: It was much more complicated before, right?\n9:57 Comment: The needle, the thread, the rope are over, right?\n9:59 Comment: According to the doctor's pulse, this is how your wound looked, right?\n10:3 Comment: What happens is that now the arbitration establishment is the punctilious one\n10:7 Comment: Because we must remember the case of Krikovia that in that Sevilla-Real Madrid\n10:11 Comment: He spent three, four minutes and if I remember correctly in Madrid he won all the goals, right?\n10:16 Comment: The gap is from Aupa, eh? Because it won't stop bleeding\n10:17 Comment: Benítez takes advantage to give instructions to Danilo and also speak with Luka Modric\n10:23 Comment: What Guti said about the arrivals of Kroos and Modric\n10:26 Comment: Maybe last year they had to be staggered, you always had to stay and you had to be cautious, careful\n10:32 Comment: Forgive me Marcos because we have news and negative news again\n10:35 Comment: Manchester City has just scored the second in Nervión\n10:38 Comment: It's not that they have more football, we saw it in the first round match at the Etihad\n10:44 Comment: But it has decisive players at the top.\n10:45 Comment: And also those who arrive, what Guti said\n10:48 Comment: Fernandinho scores the second for Manchester City\n10:50 Comment: Sevilla zero, Manchester City two, they have only just begun this\n10:54 Comment: The games are long, Juan, we will see if there is any luck and things go well\n10:59 Comment: We were commenting on Kroos and Modric with Casemiro joining the team\n11:3 Comment: From there they are released and the two can confront each other, one can step into the area\n11:10 Comment: The game now has to be more staggered and the three have to distribute the spaces\n11:13 Comment: Both Kroos and Modric knowing that Casemiro is the one who stays in the defensive pivot\n11:19 Comment: The game still resumes, for now\n11:21 Comment: Lucas Vázquez comes out to warm up in case Isco cannot continue\n11:26 Comment: Well, there we have the news on the sideline, on the field with Susana\n11:31 Comment: The warm-up of Lucas Vázquez, one of the favorites in this case also for Raja Benítez\n11:35 Comment: Given so much loss and how good a performance the Galician is giving him\n11:38 Comment: Very good, Lucas Vázquez plays the ball in the central circle Berratti\n11:40 Comment: Here comes the Italian, at the moment facing two, he wants to divide\n11:43 Comment: He does it with the ball playing to the right in front of Cristiano for Ángel Di María\n11:46 Comment: The ball for Tiago Silva, of the three center backs the one that worked best\n11:50 Comment: Or that at least better reliable performance is giving not only to your computer\n11:54 Comment: But also to the Brazilian team, Tiago Silva\n11:56 Comment: We already counted those days of those shin guards that Marcelo wore with Tiago Silva's initials\n12:2 Comment: What he gave to the Brazilian team\n12:4 Comment: Urier plays it from the right, Ramos takes it\n12:6 Comment: The ball goes to Marcelo again, Marcelo puts it up\n12:8 Comment: He plays for Cristiano, he leaves her with the shoulder\n12:10 Comment: What a ball for Jesús, he looks in the mirror of Luso\n12:12 Comment: Here comes Cristiano, Berratti takes it\n12:14 Comment: Be careful, he has been hurt\n12:17 Comment: They are still there with Isco\n12:19 Comment: Yes, right on the stairs of the locker room tunnel they are there assisting you\n12:24 Comment: Madrid has to control football, give Isco time to return to the field\n12:30 Comment: Because it is in the rock Urier, that continues\n12:33 Comment: He is a physically incredible footballer, he reaches the baseline very well, he occupies the entire wing and in individual duels.\n12:41 Comment: He is always a winger, but the other day for example against Rensu we saw him as a center back\n12:45 Comment: Marco Berratti has also hurt himself now\n12:48 Comment: I think it is the previous play there with Cristiano on the left wing and with Geseme, Susana\n12:53 Comment: Looks like a stomp or sprained ankle\n12:55 Comment: It seems back, this one goes\n12:57 Comment: It goes away, yes\n12:59 Comment: It seems back\n13:0 Comment: It goes away, it seems like the heel\n13:2 Comment: We'll see\n13:4 Comment: There, that twist with the...\n13:6 Comment: The left boot\n13:8 Comment: He has been a footballer... well, he is a footballer\n13:11 Comment: No, it was, it was\n13:13 Comment: But it seems to stay stuck there\n13:15 Comment: Yes, it seems that the foot stays and turns, I don't know what it could have\n13:21 Comment: The truth is that it has been a cold start, first because of Isco's injury and now because of Berratti's.\n13:27 Comment: Too many stops, that's good, I don't know who it benefits right now\n13:31 Comment: Well, remember that after this great game the leader of Podemos, Pablo Iglesias, visits Hormiguero 3.0 on Antena 3\n13:38 Comment: During the break we will connect with Pablo Motos to see how the preparations are going\n13:42 Comment: El Hormiguero wants to have fun, as the great Pablo Motos says\n13:45 Comment: Pablo Iglesias, the leader of Podemos\n13:47 Comment: During the break we are going to connect with our colleagues here at Antena 3\n13:50 Comment: Well, the thing about Isco continues, it seems that he is going to the locker room\n13:54 Comment: Berratti can't either\n13:55 Comment: He had to change his shirt because it was all stained with blood.\n13:59 Comment: They are now going to treat Marco Berratti here in the band and we will see if the two can continue\n14:4 Comment: It looks like it does, but let's see.\n14:6 Comment: What I say, Rafa Guerrero, the blood thing is in the norm\n14:11 Comment: But they will have the t-shirts there as close to hand as possible, right? So that the footballer does not waste time\n14:15 Comment: Yes, man, besides while you are being treated there has already been time to go for a\n14:19 Comment: But he has ordered him to change his shirt twice\n14:21 Comment: Friend, detail there that we have plenty of our referee Rafa Guerrero\n14:25 Comment: Danilo plays, ball behind, Modric comes, he lets it pass for Toni Kroos\n14:28 Comment: Toni Kroos, the footballer of reliable passing, useful\n14:32 Comment: It seems like Toni Kroos's start to the season so far\n14:35 Comment: Enter Berratti\n14:37 Comment: Well, yes, from less to more\n14:40 Comment: I think that in the last few games he is already finding his place a little bit within Real Madrid's game.\n14:46 Comment: And above all his physical form, right?\n14:47 Comment: It's true that it started out a little weak, but hey, I think it's normal.\n14:50 Comment: He had played many games and well, it's normal that he had some downturn, right?\n14:56 Comment: Look, the fourth referee is examining Isco again\n14:58 Comment: The third shirt, as Rafa Guerrero said, they had to change it again\n15:2 Comment: Well, they are also causing problems\n15:4 Comment: Isco is saying, well, now what's the problem?\n15:7 Comment: Madrid has been on the field for almost seven minutes without... with one less player\n15:12 Comment: He goes there, Berratti chases him, Varane, shoots there\n15:14 Comment: Berratti wants to take advantage of this advantage right now\n15:17 Comment: It has not been 100% because Berratti has also had to be treated\n15:21 Comment: And there we are seeing the image that our colleagues offer us for the third time\n15:25 Comment: And the pants too\n15:27 Comment: Careful\n15:29 Comment: Be careful, the ball is up, space is coming, offside\n15:31 Comment: Raise the flag, the race is now invalid\n15:36 Comment: The Madrid footballer, who has already returned to the field, Isco\n15:38 Comment: The man from Malaga, from Arroyo de la Miel, plays the ball, back for more, Paris Saint Germain returns\n15:42 Comment: At the moment he has Cavani ahead of him, who Berratti cannot\n15:45 Comment: can't, can't\n15:47 Comment: My goodness, what a start to the game\n15:49 Comment: No, no, it's broken\n15:51 Comment: The gesture is unmistakably from the Italian, Susana\n15:55 Comment: Yes, we started as...\n15:57 Comment: And prepared, in a rage\n15:59 Comment: The previous match here at the Bernabéu with Shakhtar, do you remember?\n16:2 Comment: That was also a trickle, a goal from the first half\n16:4 Comment: The previous match here at the Bernabéu with Shakhtar, do you remember?\n16:7 Comment: That was also a trickle, all the time with injuries\n16:10 Comment: Well, now, on the opposite side, at PSG, Berratti cannot continue\n16:15 Comment: Rabiot, about to enter\n16:18 Comment: The Marcos change is natural, to Rabiot, a footballer, a young French talent\n16:22 Comment: In the sub categories, there is a lot of football, right?\n16:25 Comment: Well, without a doubt, it is a natural change because Rabiot...\n16:29 Comment: Berratti is right-handed, Rabiot is left-handed\n16:30 Comment: Berratti is Italian, Rabiot is going to be one of the good French players\n16:34 Comment: And he has football and quality to be a footballer for a decade as a starter in this team.\n16:39 Comment: It has to go little by little, it has to grow, it has to dominate\n16:42 Comment: Last season simply against Barça, he lost a ball in his own half\n16:46 Comment: And it was 0-1 for Barça in the quarterfinals\n16:49 Comment: But he is a boy who has exquisite ball handling, who has distance and who has very good quality.\n16:54 Comment: Yes, it has a lot of arrival\n16:56 Comment: I think it is quality, I don't know\n16:58 Comment: I think it's quality, I don't know if it's up to Berratti\n17:2 Comment: What he is is a player who has much more arrival than Berratti\n17:5 Comment: Yes, more travel, more deployment, more attack\n17:8 Comment: Good footballer, Rabiot, footballer of the future\n17:11 Comment: Yes, I played ball up there, don't go see Arges\n17:14 Comment: Also opportunity to see him, I insist, in the sub categories of the French team\n17:18 Comment: Leading this new crop of footballers\n17:21 Comment: And now at the command of the Orang Blanc\n17:23 Comment: We will see if it also counts for Didier Deschamps in the future\n17:25 Comment: Because as Marcos Ibutti says, he is a footballer who has a lot to offer\n17:29 Comment: He plays the ball up, it comes to Masguel, he leaves it for no one directly outside\n17:33 Comment: Danilo lets the ball pass next to the Benítez and L'Orang Blanc benches\n17:37 Comment: Play the ball there for Varane, control with your right hand, with your left foot, with your right hand again\n17:41 Comment: He puts it with his left foot, the Frenchman is also exquisite with the ball taken from behind for Danilo\n17:45 Comment: The ball returns to Rafael Varane, he makes the change of front, ball to Marcelo\n17:48 Comment: He goes to control, he leaves her asleep, he comes to press upstairs, Iri María\n17:51 Comment: He puts it first into space, Gesé runs, advantage for PSG and throw-in\n17:56 Comment: He's going to put pressure, as Guti said, Madrid on top\n17:58 Comment: Yes, I should push a lot harder.\n18:0 Comment: We just saw a goal kick where Real Madrid put pressure on themselves.\n18:4 Comment: And we got the ball back right away.\n18:6 Comment: I think it is essential to carry the weight of the party a little.\n18:9 Comment: That Real Madrid is pressing higher\n18:11 Comment: Borussia Monchengladbach scores, I take the counterattack first now from PSG\n18:15 Comment: Ball into space for Cavani, Casemiro corrects\n18:18 Comment: The ball back for Keylor Navas\n18:20 Comment: Or they called it the locker room and they targeted Guas in the preview\n18:23 Comment: Keylor Paras, Marcelo plays there\n18:26 Comment: Gladbach scored against Juve as well as the group of Sevilla and City\n18:33 Comment: Play the ball up, ball for Donny Kroos\n18:35 Comment: Then you already know everything in mega\n18:37 Comment: Also the best summary of Astana Atlético de Madrid from Sevilla vs Manchester City\n18:42 Comment: Tomorrow from 7 pm the best images of the Valencia Club de Fútbol and FC Barcelona matches\n18:48 Comment: Everything in mega with Josep Pedrerol and the great team that accompanies football nights in mega\n18:55 Comment: The total Champions League, Rabiot plays the ball, Rabiot for Cavani, Cavani behind, the ball for Mascuel\n18:59 Comment: Control and touch up, Ibra comes, extends doing the catapult up there for Matuidi\n19:4 Comment: There is a foul, Matuidi already puts it into play, ball for Casemiro, Casemiro up\n19:10 Comment: Well Marcelo is going to arrive in space\n19:12 Comment: He slipped away\n19:13 Comment: I think the game has lost rhythm, I think the interruptions, right now the team that increases the intensity first can score the first goal\n19:22 Comment: Because I think that now they are both very imprecise, at a very slow pace, repeated passes, now we have to press again, press\n19:30 Comment: And I think that the team that finds the ball first, with a high pace, I think will have an advantage.\n19:36 Comment: Gladbach's goal is very important because it saves Sevilla from elimination\n19:40 Comment: Also be careful with that crossover of matches that we are also experiencing live while we comment on this great game between Real Madrid and PSG\n19:49 Comment: That at the moment it lacks rhythm, although the best actors are on stage, right now at the Bernabéu\n19:54 Comment: Rabiot plays the ball, offloads for Matuidi, pressure up Toni Kroos, the ball short again for Thiago Mota\n19:59 Comment: The ball up, point of this summer to reach Atlético de Madrid, what a hat now from Di María, it's going well now from Casemiro\n20:4 Comment: Be careful that the Fideo sneaks in, he puts it into space, Oriella comes, he can put the ball for Matuidi, Keylor Raba\n20:9 Comment: Uriel's pass was too tense, I think that center is not good there, if Matuidi leaves it more touched he can finish better\n20:19 Comment: And then also that the ball is very tense and on Matuidi's right foot, Matuidi is left-handed and that makes his shot very difficult.\n20:26 Comment: Yes, yes, he's doing poorly, I think that's why he doesn't finish well, but come on, PSG player, Di María player\n20:32 Comment: Which makes the Bernabéu start applauding, as if to say hey, let's wake up, right?\n20:39 Comment: Yes, he didn't like it at all, neither did Rafa Benítez, who quickly sat down to talk to his second, Antonio Gomez.\n20:44 Comment: The ball for Isco, by the way about Berratti, Guti may be soleo, we will see later the doctors who are the experts in this\n20:50 Comment: In the one that was like this, they did the ankle test, but it is true that back where the cebellum and soleus are inserted, the lower part gets trapped\n20:57 Comment: If it can be\n20:59 Comment: Ball for Thiago Silva, ball that plays to the right, the ball that now goes to Urier\n21:5 Comment: Serge Urier, ball to Rabiot, Rabiot returns to the side, Gesé is practically defending Madrid from behind the ball but still in three quarters of the field\n21:14 Comment: The defense practically next to the central circle, Varane, Ramos, Danilo and Marcelo, all very tight like the game, like this intersection on Antena 3\n21:23 Comment: Rabiot's ball to Masguel, Hold on, Step on, wait for now, throw the bait, no one falls\n21:29 Comment: And as Marcos said, there is a lot of precision in the field of passing and it also affects both, it takes time to recover.\n21:35 Comment: Well, but right now I think that that first shot by Paris Saint Germain, that shot by Matuidi\n21:40 Comment: Ball for Ibra, Ibra inside the area, mother of my life, the ball goes to the left of Keylor Navas who had stretched\n21:47 Comment: He didn't take all the Swede's bagel that I wanted to give him\n21:52 Comment: Great opportunity for Paris Saint Germain, Guti\n21:55 Comment: No, the truth is incredible and he looks for space, the only space he has to put it in seems to me to be through Sergio's legs.\n22:2 Comment: The truth is that it is incredible, I think they are a very talented team, they may be playing well, they may be playing badly.\n22:9 Comment: But they have the talent, on any occasion they can solve you or help a match\n22:14 Comment: And well, Madrid has to improve, it has to wake up and it has to start thinking that it has to win the game because it is very important to be first in the group.\n22:24 Comment: From there, as Guti says, from that goal that can come only through talent in a set-piece play, you manage in a different way, Marcos.\n22:30 Comment: Well, the first hit, as we announced, was from Paris Saint Germain and right now they are the ones who got in first after the break and now have that principle of strength\n22:38 Comment: Madrid has to move the ball faster, it has to tire Paris Saint Germain more and it has to look for more aggressive combinations that allow it to score goals.\n22:47 Comment: Decisive situations, sings the Bernabéu, at the moment they know that what they need is what they need, Vanilo puts pressure on David Luiz very high there\n22:53 Comment: The two Brazilians, both from the national team, play the ball for Masvel, another Brazilian\n22:57 Comment: Now playing on the left flank for Paris Saint Germain, Ibra's good friend puts him on pause.\n23:2 Comment: That he regretted because he has only scored one goal against Madrid with four different teams, it was with Barça\n23:8 Comment: He has played in so many good teams, it was normal that they would cross paths with Madrid along the way.\n23:12 Comment: The usual player winning leagues but in the Champions League he resists\n23:15 Comment: Ball to Di María, he wins the first duel and then Gesee comes to cover, Gasemir the ball that goes to the right, Orier in front of Marcelo, puts it...\n23:21 Comment: Cavani doesn't arrive, Isco appears, Isco against Matuidi, Isco holds on, he throws the ball up\n23:27 Comment: Cavani is coming to recover it, he is going to leave it to the man who is facing him, which is Masvel, he is already coming for the Uruguayan and there is Edinson Cavani\n23:33 Comment: Holds the ball, plays face to face, ball to Matuidi, first release to Masvel, Paris Saint Germain gains the advantage\n23:37 Comment: What a dangerous ball, it was killed perfectly, now Gasemiro, but Paris Saint Germain recovers\n23:40 Comment: Look at Rabiot, what a hat in front of Gasemiro, he plays for Orier, downloads for Rabiot\n23:44 Comment: Ball there, Madrid trying to smell it but at the moment Paris Saint Germain is dominating up there\n23:49 Comment: Ball to Orier, he wants to unbalance, he can look for the shot, ball to Di María, left-footed, out\n23:54 Comment: Madrid is not correcting Cristiano Ronaldo's position in defense well\n23:59 Comment: Right now Cristiano is on the left, Gese is the first striker and what Paris Saint Germain is doing is the ball to Di María\n24:6 Comment: With Di María he joins Orier, the two make two for one against Marcelo and from there they enter the kitchen again and again\n24:12 Comment: There the midfielders, if Cristiano and Gese stay up, have to correct in a line of four\n24:17 Comment: That Guti was looking for the back bar, Di María's shot, adjusting it there to the corner\n24:20 Comment: By the way, he just scored when talking about the French team, a Frenchman but from Sevilla at close range, Strémulina for the Nervión team\n24:28 Comment: At the moment Sevilla FC 1, Manchester City 2, then the best summary on Mega\n24:33 Comment: The ball that Ramos plays, Ramos who releases the ball, the ball that goes up there again so that he can try to take it in the duel\n24:43 Comment: Casemiro fell with Rabiot, foul in favor of Madrid\n24:45 Comment: Geese!\n24:50 Comment: The positions were exchanged, Modri ​​was giving the pass and Casemiro was a little ahead.\n24:56 Comment: They are very comfortable, they are going very well, Real Madrid is practically not pressing\n25:1 Comment: The arrivals of Uriel, the truth is that Marcelo's side is doing him a lot of damage to Real Madrid\n25:8 Comment: In the Parque de los Príncipes Gese returned with him, but today the players of the most advanced Madrid are not returning with Uriel\n25:13 Comment: And there the superiority is generated, a weak PSG band that Madrid has to exploit is Mascabane's\n25:21 Comment: And left wing there, there are situations for Madrid to make a difference\n25:24 Comment: In the dead ball the form is the same and is always for both teams.\n25:27 Comment: So let's see now, set pieces against Real Madrid\n25:29 Comment: You can look for Cristiano, Cristiano shoots, gets bitten, doesn't catch, but the second one does\n25:36 Comment: I said about the left wing because just before the clash between Uriel and Isco\n25:41 Comment: We saw Gese looking for one-on-one with Mascabane, the only situation in the game in which we saw him\n25:46 Comment: Because the rest of the game Gese is either a center forward or on the left wing\n25:50 Comment: And there Mascabane is the weakest PSG player in one-on-ones and Cabani does not like to defend backwards\n25:57 Comment: This is how the two technicians play in that area, in the Real Madrid band, in the Santiago Bernabéu, Susana Guas\n26:3 Comment: Yes, but Blanc applauds because he is more satisfied of course until the moment we come\n26:8 Comment: Ball for Real Madrid, Marcelo plays, Marcelo already on the field now in rival territory\n26:13 Comment: The ball is offloaded to Casemiro so as not to lose it, which is essential for both teams.\n26:16 Comment: Because footballers come to go out for speed, with space on the counter, they also feel comfortable in that version of the team\n26:22 Comment: Ball behind Marcelo's back, Rastraguanta steps on it, Rabiot, Marcelo comes to touch it\n26:26 Comment: Ball to the left, offload, now coming for Gese, Gese short, the ball for Toni Kroos\n26:30 Comment: Kroos in front of Modric who at the moment is intervening little and Madrid needs him\n26:33 Comment: Casemiro falls asleep, recovers the ball from Ibra, unloads the ball, plays the wall, triangulation to the UDI combat\n26:38 Comment: Now Casemiro is very attentive but commits a foul, says the referee, Lattenburg\n26:43 Comment: Well, it's one of the things that this footballer always does well, after a loss he either harasses you so that the opponent doesn't come out on the counterattack.\n26:51 Comment: Or it is necessary, and we see right now what the foul was for, all of Madrid behind the value line\n26:56 Comment: 27 of play at the Bernabéu and at the moment Guti you are not really liking the color you have\n27:2 Comment: No, especially because they have the power of the ball, they are coming out very easily, practically without any pressure from Real Madrid.\n27:10 Comment: Then they are arriving well and if players like Ibraimovic, like Di María, arrive well, then Madrid will have problems\n27:17 Comment: I think we have to throw the line of pressure much further forward and try to recover the ball much sooner.\n27:23 Comment: Because if not, I think Real Madrid is going to have a bad time, especially in this first half.\n27:26 Comment: Commenting with Guti, with Marcos, with Susana, with Rafa Guerrero, with you also through Atresplayer, from the multimedia application\n27:35 Comment: And you already know that later during the break we will also connect with our colleagues with Pablo Motos and el hormiguero 3.0\n27:40 Comment: He plays the ball up, it comes to Ibra, Ibra unloads, the ball goes to Di María, he wanted to release first, he demands a handball from Ramos\n27:45 Comment: And the referee, Rafa Guerrero, gives it to him, be careful\n27:48 Comment: No, there will be no cardboard for this action, eh\n27:52 Comment: Di María tries to surprise but he had an easy pass to Maswell who came in, Di María is hurting\n27:59 Comment: Every time he goes towards interior positions and receives between the lines\n28:3 Comment: Yes, they very easily overcome Real Madrid's line with a single pass they practically take away the entire Real Madrid midfield\n28:11 Comment: And they go straight for the defense, I think that is what we have to look for a little, that they are not so comfortable in the center of the field\n28:17 Comment: And don't let them turn around so comfortably\n28:18 Comment: In the other game of the group, Shakhtar 1, Malmo 0\n28:22 Comment: Ibrahimovic can shoot from there, of the last 30 fouls all have been saved by the goalkeeper\n28:28 Comment: He has scored a goal, 5 goals, but none of them have gone either to the barrier or to the clouds, the barrier seems too close\n28:33 Comment: Ibra is coming, he has also thrown it at Barça, outside\n28:37 Comment: That hit he has, practically ending with the inside, you have to have power to hit it like that\n28:44 Comment: After 30 she is the first one to shoot, out, eh\n28:46 Comment: Mother of my life, Guti, how closely that ball passed\n28:50 Comment: Yes, the truth is that it happened close, but Keylor was there, eh, Keylor's hands were there\n28:54 Comment: I don't know if it would have been a goal, I don't know if it would have been a goal if it went inside the ball, inside the goal\n29:0 Comment: Has at least 3 clear occasions\n29:2 Comment: What happens is that how dare Ibra from a distance\n29:5 Comment: Imposing, hierarchical footballer, only with his presence and the way he carries himself\n29:10 Comment: And especially when you have the confidence to be able to do everything you want, that's good, no one is going to tell you anything, I think that makes you braver, no, and try other types of things, no.\n29:23 Comment: Loramda was hit hard because in the 0-0 match at the Parque de los Príncipes he was the only one, or the last one to leave the top 3 on the court.\n29:31 Comment: Knowing that he did not have that area of ​​influence and that he was not playing near the Real Madrid area\n29:36 Comment: A very different match from the one we are watching, Ibra is playing in the central circle\n29:38 Comment: Opening to the right, he goes with Casemiro, he gave him the rub for what Benítez María left him, the profile he likes\n29:43 Comment: He leaves it for Urier, there is danger, he comes from the side, he leaves it behind\n29:46 Comment: There is no one, Casemiro takes it, the ball goes up, Isco does not arrive, he recovers the opening\n29:51 Comment: Isco from the hit, Guas is not there, Cavani comes, Cavani plays for Matuidi, Matuidi among several, offloads the ball, the white wall comes to defend\n29:58 Comment: Ball and Thiago Mota hangs, he is going to leave Urier, he wants to leave it, he kills it with his chest, Urier puts it, Keylor Navas\n30:4 Comment: He said, if Isco is not there, Isco is not there, Real Madrid is not there, the whole team is not there, they are arriving very well on Urier's side\n30:12 Comment: But also to say that... Marcelo yes, it seems that...\n30:18 Comment: Be careful that Ramos makes an indication to the bench, Guas, change\n30:22 Comment: Ramos is asking for change, Guas\n30:25 Comment: It was going to be said that it would be, come on, for Benítez the last thing he needed, for the man who rotates the least to get injured\n30:31 Comment: Come on, he doesn't rotate, along with Cristiano Ronaldo because he doesn't have a natural substitute\n30:36 Comment: And let's see what happens, Isco is now drinking water\n30:41 Comment: It's Marcelo, it's Marcelo, yes\n30:43 Comment: As we said, but because of the gesture we saw from Ramos asking for the change and for his teammate\n30:48 Comment: We have explained it from the beginning, but obviously it is Marcelo who makes that gesture\n30:51 Comment: No, it is Ramos who makes the gesture\n30:53 Comment: But for Marcelo\n30:55 Comment: For Marcelo, that is\n30:57 Comment: Let's see, because as Guas says, this Real Madrid is already quite burdened, the new Real Madrid of the meticulous coach and winner of titles like Rafa Benítez\n31:6 Comment: How much do you like to have everything well distributed, well organized, well placed?\n31:10 Comment: And of course the injuries are hindering him in this start, Ibra is coming\n31:13 Comment: Tell me Guas\n31:15 Comment: Now let's see how Marcelo reacts to this play, but come on, Nacho is warming up.\n31:21 Comment: But the situation is very strange, there cannot be a player who cannot sprint at the last of the line\n31:27 Comment: And breaks the offside line, Guti\n31:29 Comment: Yes, well, that moment either of going to the ground, or of going to the ground, because if not then the speed of the Paris-Saint Germain space can take advantage of it.\n31:37 Comment: Ball for Matuidi, the triangulation with Masguel, the baseline comes out, Varane goes to look for him, Masguel puts it in, penalty spot\n31:43 Comment: Ibra jumped in front of Ramos, he beat him, but in the end the ball went past both of them\n31:46 Comment: Marcelo plays, no, to say the least, he takes it and lets it go, he has to change it now, ready Guas, Nacho\n31:52 Comment: Yes, he lets the ball go because Marcelo, as we saw, that Sergio Ramos's gesture cannot continue\n31:58 Comment: Very bad news for Real Madrid, for Rafa Benítez, who has had 11 injuries so far this season\n32:5 Comment: Marcelo, key man, who leaves applauded, as you can see, people standing to say goodbye to the Brazilian\n32:12 Comment: Another one falls, Nacho enters\n32:13 Comment: Well, we assume that Marcelo is clearly breaking fibers and he will have noticed it and from then on that news was a footballer.\n32:21 Comment: As soon as you notice it, you already know what it is, it's not so much exploration, let them change you and see, right?\n32:28 Comment: I imagine that the shots will go there because he has neither gone to the ground nor asked for attention\n32:32 Comment: He has not made any attempt at anything, we have seen it through Ramos\n32:36 Comment: The Bernabéu sang his name when he left through that background\n32:39 Comment: You said Marcos that he himself must have noticed, if he knows his body, the footballer knows it, which is the clack, right?\n32:45 Comment: Yes, because if you have any type of doubt, if you don't get the whiplash, the stone so clear, then in the end you ask for medical attention\n32:53 Comment: Let's see what happens, I think it has to be something muscular that has noticed it and he has no doubt what it is.\n33:0 Comment: I wanted to ask you, Guti, because there is a Madrid-Barça in sight, right here around the corner\n33:4 Comment: Madrid loses a full-back but loses much more with Marcelo offensively, right?\n33:9 Comment: Much more, he is a full-back who defends well, who is important for the defense, he is a very important player on an offensive level for the team\n33:18 Comment: I think he is one of the fundamental pieces, not only for Benítez but for this Real Madrid\n33:22 Comment: And it's a shame, it's a shame that now the classic is coming and well, let's hope he can play\n33:28 Comment: But hey, Marcelo's face is complicated, it could be that he has a break.\n33:32 Comment: Box that Kroos falls, many in cotton, many caught with tweezers, the date is approaching\n33:37 Comment: Above all, the most important game they are playing right now, the most important game of the season for both of them, is this Real Madrid-Paris Saint Germain\n33:44 Comment: Where the leadership of the group is played, how much it can say in the crossroads, I insist, and what it is saying so much lately in the Champions League\n33:50 Comment: With the double value of the goals in the opposite field in the event of a tie in the tie and which also determines the approach of some coaches\n33:57 Comment: When they play the first game, the first leg at home\n33:59 Comment: Last season, without going any further, Paris Saint Germain played at the Camp Nou for first place\n34:5 Comment: Barça arrived with injuries and some problems, however that day Paris Saint Germain did not compete at its highest level\n34:11 Comment: Second in the group, round of 16 matchup against Chelsea, very tough tie, players suspended, injuries\n34:18 Comment: Pyrrhic story, loses many people for the next one\n34:21 Comment: That's it, and he reaches the quarterfinals very burdened and there he falls against a superior Barça\n34:24 Comment: It is not taking away merits from Barça, it is undoubtedly analyzing Paris Saint Germain itself\n34:26 Comment: Cross, cross, he came out bitten now by Thiago Silvia, he's coming back, because he did it well!\n34:32 Comment: Goal, goal, goal, goal!\n34:37 Comment: Nacho goal!\n34:40 Comment: From Real Madrid, play to win, this is the white team, my goodness\n34:46 Comment: He made a pass that ultimately died at the far post and ended up inside.\n34:51 Comment: This is also Real Madrid, Nacho's goal, Real Madrid scores, Real Madrid 1, Paris Saint Germain 0\n35:0 Comment: We said that Marcelo was a very important player for Real Madrid, well, the first ball that Nacho touches is a goal for Real Madrid\n35:8 Comment: The truth is that well, shit from the goalkeeper, who comes out, I don't know, where he goes or where he thinks he can catch the ball\n35:14 Comment: And the truth is that Nacho's shot is not easy, it is not at all easy as he puts it inside\n35:20 Comment: Marcos has something that many coaches claim, which Jurgen Klopp is also doing at Liverpool, which is shooting.\n35:26 Comment: Many teams do not shoot on goal, no, no, no, they generate but they do not shoot, here he shoots Cross, there is a rebound and they fight for it\n35:31 Comment: The Germans shoot a lot, so Cross usually shoots and is used to it, right?\n35:35 Comment: Because I face German teams, the truth is that they don't hesitate when they are outside the area\n35:39 Comment: I know that you have remembered that when you told Manu in the preview the Champions League, the European Cup, it brings back very good memories but also some bad ones.\n35:46 Comment: I know that you have remembered those assignments with Bayern\n35:49 Comment: Hey Guti, but do you think Nacho's shot was going on goal?\n35:52 Comment: Yes, I think so, I think it's intentional, I think he sees perfectly how the goalkeeper, I don't know, leaves the goal\n35:58 Comment: There was also, I think it was Gesé Marcos, right?\n36:0 Comment: Yes, I got there like a shot\n36:1 Comment: I get the impression that Trapp is very focused on Cross's shot, the moment he touches Thiago Silva, he goes in search of the ball\n36:11 Comment: I think that Nacho is not there at all in his field of vision and when he realizes it, he sees that Nacho is there\n36:15 Comment: It remains in no man's land\n36:17 Comment: And he slips a little, obviously he was already out of the play, I think he doesn't notice Nacho at any time.\n36:22 Comment: Look Rabiot! The shot on the stick! What quality of French!\n36:27 Comment: Control and shooting, incredible\n36:28 Comment: Adrián Rabiot, controlled and shot, connected the ball to the front\n36:32 Comment: Ball for Matuidi, this is not over, Nacho, it's just beginning\n36:35 Comment: What a strange game, but what a great game!\n36:37 Comment: David Luiz plays the ball, they go to the central circle, again for Thiago Silva, Marcos speaks\n36:41 Comment: No, we said that, I think that Trapp's mistake has had a very good season, only against Girondins de Bundeo was he a bad day\n36:48 Comment: However, this mistake hinders him, but Paris Saint Germain has gotten back into the game\n36:54 Comment: Masguel puts it with Rosca, it is good for Ibra, he jumped against Ramos, ahead now the clamp is also with Nacho\n37:0 Comment: Offside\n37:2 Comment: Ball for Real Madrid\n37:4 Comment: Instead of that goal having set them back or causing them to lose confidence or doubt, however, Paris Saint Germain is once again on top\n37:11 Comment: By the way, Manchester City also scored the third, Wilfred Boni scored 1-3\n37:20 Comment: The best summary then you already know about that Sevilla FC, Manchester City in mega, with Giuseppe Deroli and the entire team\n37:26 Comment: Starting at 10:30 and also from Astana Atlético de Madrid, all the details of this Real Madrid Paris Saint Germain\n37:31 Comment: And tomorrow the same of course with Valencia CF and FC Barcelona, ​​the 5\n37:38 Comment: Danilo plays there, Danilo inside, ball to Modric, the ball is recovered by Masguel, there could have been a foul on Isco, but the referee now lets the ball continue\n37:45 Comment: Cavani plays, Cavani for David Luiz, David Luiz playing short for Thiago Silva, Thiago Silva up, the error is also part of the game\n37:53 Comment: For one and for the other, here comes Rabiot, a connection has been made, it reminded me of that great goal you scored against Villarreal Guti\n38:0 Comment: Out of the area, out of the area and first\n38:2 Comment: Yes, yes, that was more complicated I think, but oh well\n38:6 Comment: Because you didn't directly control anymore\n38:7 Comment: Directly, directly volley\n38:10 Comment: The truth is that Madrid is having a lot of problems, I don't know if it is the team that is tired or lacks movement.\n38:18 Comment: Especially the players who do not have the ball, with a lot of lack of movement and well, it is difficult for them to have possession of the ball and the truth is that I see a very good PSG\n38:28 Comment: The perception is that Kroos, Modric, Casimiro are not supporting the midfield, PSG finds their back immediately and the superiority\n38:35 Comment: There are always four from PSG, three from Madrid and in that pass that surpasses the three, Madrid suffers\n38:42 Comment: Di María has it and as we say at the moment the best chances have been for PSG, the goal for Madrid was scored by Di María, second post, Ibra, put his head in, Cristiano took it out\n38:50 Comment: Keylor Navas flew there and the ball ended up in a goal kick\n38:55 Comment: Rabiot\n38:56 Comment: Did it fly? I get the sensation, I don't know, visually from here, from the cabin\n39:2 Comment: And he comes to play, oh no, I don't think so, he leaves directly, although Keylor Navas flew, he went well with sticks\n39:9 Comment: And there the head to Uriera and kickoff for Madrid\n39:12 Comment: In the simple comparison it is already seen that Rabiot is dull, right?\n39:15 Comment: Previous volley to the post, control and shot, this right leg comes very stiff and touching there almost without sliding\n39:23 Comment: And in the end the ball goes very far, tight shot Rabiot\n39:27 Comment: He plays the ball and Rabiot is returning with his left foot, in the end he cuts the ball, no, Ibra comes first, Ibra in front of Varane\n39:32 Comment: The two center backs will see who is going to look for it, play to the left for Maxwell, Maxwell makes a good run\n39:37 Comment: No one arrives, my goodness, what a move, one more time, knocking on the door of Costa Rican Keylor Navas\n39:45 Comment: Cavani has failed, not even he believes it\n39:47 Comment: The feeling that when he is going to shoot he loses sight of the ball, not closing his eyes, without a doubt, because in the end he is a good finisher, is done very well by Maxwell.\n39:55 Comment: But Cavani doesn't find the ball, then Ibrahimovic's thing is more difficult because Cavani was supposed to finish there and Ibrahimovic doesn't see when he gets to the ball.\n40:4 Comment: Just as Madrid was surprised 0-0 there in the Parc des Princes, Guti tonight at Paris Saint Germain is, as we said in the preview, talking to Manu, nothing about lambs, wolves and a pack\n40:15 Comment: They are playing very well, the truth is, they are playing much better than Real Madrid, it is true that this is football, an inaccuracy on the part of the goalkeeper, scoring a goal for Real Madrid, but if it is due to football and possession and arrivals, I think that At this moment PSG is one step above Real Madrid\n40:32 Comment: Lota from Matuidi, plays the ball for Thiago, Rabiot keeps it, he wanted to do it, blows the foul, Clatenburg from Casemiro who scratched, Rafa Guerrero is already down\n40:41 Comment: Correct, the school has been very good so far.\n40:45 Comment: We are going to comment on the previous ones, at the moment football is flowing more than in the first minutes, nothing to review Rafa\n40:52 Comment: No nothing, plus we already said that it is a quality of Clatenburg, letting play and letting play a lot, be careful\n40:59 Comment: Here comes Uriel, Uriel in front of Nacho, the scorer of the goal, comes Uriel, Uriel puts it one on one, Rafael Vanam takes the header from the area and directly from the field, throw-in for PSG\n41:10 Comment: Well, 42 of us entered now, I don't know the face that Benítez Guas has\n41:15 Comment: Well, he doesn't stop giving orders to his captain, Sergio Ramos, all the time.\n41:19 Comment: More than correcting than aiming offensively at Madrid, because Paris Saint Germain is arriving a lot, David Luiz puts his head, Madrid is winning the game, he leaves it with his chest there for Rabiot de Ibra\n41:30 Comment: Thiago Mota, the keeper, plays the ball inside, ball up, Matuidi wanted to do the rebound in front of Vanam who steals the ball, he can go up, Bernat Cristiano doesn't arrive, David Luiz cuts\n41:37 Comment: Start over, but all this is happening in the Madrid field, in the part of the field that Benítez's team defends\n41:44 Comment: There is Masguel, Masguel for Ibra, oriented control, he hides it, it does not reach Modric, he takes the ball back for Mota\n41:49 Comment: Mota, central circle for Thiago Silva, now in front of Rabiot\n41:53 Comment: Thiago Silva holds on, he already unloads for Di María, Di María is about to lose, at the last moment he released for the Brazilian\n41:58 Comment: It's David Luiz's turn, the ball goes to Masguel, he can put in another cross like the one before, he's very far away, the ball goes to Matuidi, Matuidi holds on, he drags Danilo with him\n42:4 Comment: But Danilo doesn't go, he stays, the ball goes to David Luiz and we start again\n42:9 Comment: Madrid has to gain meters, it has to push the defensive line up and the midfield has to press and reduce space and time to the ball holder.\n42:18 Comment: Because if not, Paris Saint Germain's ball conservation is relatively comfortable for players of such quality.\n42:24 Comment: And he crawls, he takes Cristiano, there Mota, unloads for Rabiot, now for David Luiz\n42:28 Comment: Two little guys, play the ball to the left, ball for Masguel, Danilo comes to meet him, ball inside for Cavani\n42:35 Comment: The footballers of the Parisian team seem to have more spark\n42:38 Comment: Yes, well, Real Madrid, above all, is a second late for everything and then the pressure is more on a player than on a team.\n42:45 Comment: I think that on the contrary, what they have to do is get together a little and try to pressure as a block.\n42:50 Comment: Either up or down, but try to press as a block\n42:53 Comment: Because if it is only one, it will be difficult for them to steal the ball because they are very quality players, it is very difficult for them to lose a ball.\n43:2 Comment: A lot of precision, as you say, the pass also has tension, it is very well directed\n43:6 Comment: Be careful Urier and Thiago Silva in the corner\n43:8 Comment: Well, let's see, as Marcos says in the scouting of the rival, Paris Saint Germain, Di María comes to put it there, second post David Luiz\n43:16 Comment: He put his boot in, the referee signals offside, but it's the lineman\n43:21 Comment: Yes, yes, it's online, the one in the background was watching if the ball went in or not\n43:25 Comment: The one who first pointed it out was Guti\n43:27 Comment: In the end that auction that was already invalidated\n43:29 Comment: Yes, because I wanted them to not shoot me a goal\n43:33 Comment: It is in the position of the fifth referee there, already how he raised the flag, as Guti said, before that circumstance arrived Rafa Guerrero\n43:41 Comment: Indeed, the referee was right again.\n43:44 Comment: and Guti\n43:45 Comment: It is one of the circumstances why coaches prefer not to have players in the posts.\n43:51 Comment: Because in the end they enable the second play, and if there are players on the posts, you have a situation of easy scoring against the goalkeeper.\n43:58 Comment: By not having players on the posts, you have to force the first shot first\n44:2 Comment: Well seen, because if you have two you already have it, and if you only have one and the goalkeeper stays, the one who falls to the crossbar below, you also have both in front of the ball, enabling the entire offensive line\n44:11 Comment: There is a foul in favor of Madrid, there may be Cardboard\n44:13 Comment: Yes, you will see it first\n44:15 Comment: The right back, the one who had the clash with Isco Alarcón\n44:20 Comment: First yellow for Serge Urier\n44:23 Comment: As Was says, the right back now, high whistle by Clatenburg\n44:27 Comment: We are practically out of time, how much would Rafa Guerrero have to add?\n44:31 Comment: I think it can go to two minutes, due to injury interruptions.\n44:35 Comment: Now let's see what he decrees\n44:38 Comment: What adds, or rather\n44:40 Comment: There is Toni Kroos, positioning the ball, never better said, with care, placing it as if he were a rugby kicker.\n44:46 Comment: There heeling back, marking well the steps that Toni Kroos, the German, wants to take\n44:51 Comment: Many finishers among them too, of course Sergio Ramos who is in an advanced position right now\n44:56 Comment: And Toni Kroos puts it in the middle of the game, David Luiz jumped before now, he didn't get to the ball, he puts it in with his head, he attracts it with the pot\n45:2 Comment: Paris Saint Germain takes her out, Isco Alarcón comes to fight, Madrid recovers, she plays for Modric\n45:6 Comment: Modric the dynamism, releases the ball there for Danilo, Danilo with Gese\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: The match is on the air, and the match is on the air, and the match is on the air, and the match is on the air, and the match is on the air, and the match is on the air, and the match is on the air, and the match is on the air, and the match is on

Comment: David Luiz wants to play the ball.\n1:26 Comment: A central defender who sometimes attacks better than defends,\n1:29 Comment: although we are talking about the elite and footballers with extraordinary talent\n1:32 Comment: to reach teams like Paris Saint Germain, Chelsea, or play in the Canarian team.\n1:38 Comment: Back ball, there he plays for Thiago Mota, making a close-up, makes the change,\n1:41 Comment: in the diagonal, he's not going to get there, Maxwell, he's going to a band for Madrid.\n1:45 Comment: He sends Benitez to warm up, Zako Vácic, Lucas Vázquez and Cherichev.\n1:49 Comment: The thing about David Luiz is that he's a player who relies on his physical qualities,\n1:54 Comment: and not on his tactical qualities.\n1:56 Comment: He often loses his place, he's very expeditious, he leaves the door open,\n2:0 Comment: and he's a player who, if he had the tactical level that Thiago Silva has in mind,\n2:6 Comment: it would be incredible. David Luiz still has that margin for improvement.\n2:10 Comment: Sector's second, he sends it 2-0 in the same group as Madrid and Paris Saint Germain.\n2:15 Comment: He sends it to Shakhtar, 2-0 against Malmo.\n2:20 Comment: I think Thiago Mota is complaining.\n2:22 Comment: Thiago Mota is complaining. Ramos asks him what's going on, Clatenburg.\n2:31 Comment: Casemiro Rafa Guerrero comes late in that cross against the Italian-Brazilian.\n2:36 Comment: Indeed, he comes in late and the yellow card has been played.\n2:41 Comment: He's warned that he won't lose the next one.\n2:43 Comment: Be careful, be careful. Di María comes in, Di María in the front. Keylor Páraz.\n2:49 Comment: Very good, Di María, beating Sergio Ramos in the back.\n2:52 Comment: While everyone was looking at Clatenburg, David Luiz, long ball, good control.\n2:57 Comment: And not such a good finish from Di María, who I think had room to get more inside\n3:2 Comment: and divide a little more and make Navas doubt. He took it well.\n3:6 Comment: Isco Modric, now it seems that Madrid are overwhelmed by this last one from Di María,\n3:9 Comment: who has started the second half as the first one here in the Bernabéu began.\n3:12 Comment: Or above all, as Marcos said, after the blow with Isco.\n3:15 Comment: Cristiano comes, shoots Cristiano. Good.\n3:18 Comment: I imagine that Laurent Blanc-Ouas is aiming at them, those that Paris Saint Germain is having.\n3:23 Comment: I don't know Benítez's face again in the start.\n3:26 Comment: Yes, the truth is that a little bit waiting, because Paris Saint Germain in the first half\n3:30 Comment: has had at least 5 or 6 very clear.\n3:34 Comment: Yes, but there is a change that is noticeable. Real Madrid is pressing very high.\n3:40 Comment: And that is important. They no longer take the ball out with such ease.\n3:45 Comment: But it is true that you have to be available, especially for David Luiz's long passes.\n3:53 Comment: He is a player who has a very good ball exit.\n3:56 Comment: He was now more. He fell in front of Rafael Barán.\n3:59 Comment: He plays the ball again up there. Toni Kroos behind the other 8, now from Thiago Mota.\n4:4 Comment: The ball in space. Isco runs there. The guy played in front of David Luiz.\n4:8 Comment: The Malaguyan fell behind Zabillado. He recovers the ball from Paris Saint Germain.\n4:11 Comment: He plays for Adrien Rabiot. Rabiot for Di María.\n4:14 Comment: Playing inside, ascending and detaching. Di María comes, puts it up.\n4:17 Comment: What a ball for Cavani and Keylor Navas.\n4:20 Comment: It was out of play.\n4:22 Comment: Yes, he had raised the battery, the assistant, Marcos.\n4:24 Comment: It was very strange that Cavani lost speed there.\n4:28 Comment: He was coming well, he was coming with time, but suddenly he stopped.\n4:32 Comment: And he was looking at the assistant with the flag up, right in front.\n4:37 Comment: Benítez's anger is at its peak right now.\n4:40 Comment: Madrid, Susana, I think Benítez, after having worked hard in the break,\n4:46 Comment: has to find recovery.\n4:48 Comment: Because with recovery he will have the counterattack and it is time to doubt Paris Saint Germain.\n4:52 Comment: It is also necessary that Modric and Kroos take the rhythm of the game and start to command.\n4:57 Comment: But I agree with what Buti says.\n4:58 Comment: The intention is to get out of the box.\n4:59 Comment: And above all, the way Madrid tries to pass the move that the English say,\n5:2 Comment: from the touch and move, touch and I'm leaving.\n5:4 Comment: It seems that Madrid and Buti are trying to practice now in the start of the second half.\n5:9 Comment: Yes, it is very important.\n5:10 Comment: And above all what Marcos says.\n5:12 Comment: I think that both Kroos and Modric take more prominence than they did in the first half.\n5:17 Comment: They are ahead of Casimiro, practically reinforcing that lead.\n5:22 Comment: Look, look, that's what Madrid is trying to do on the right.\n5:25 Comment: He wanted to put it, he cut the ball, Masuel, Modric recovers.\n5:28 Comment: Good was talking.\n5:29 Comment: Yes, because it is important to be able to get from behind and that players like Danilo\n5:36 Comment: have amplitude to the team.\n5:38 Comment: This is good for Isco.\n5:39 Comment: Isco with Cristiano, playing from nine, now as a back-up.\n5:41 Comment: Ball for Dani Kroos, face, play for Gesi.\n5:43 Comment: Peak of the area, Madrid attack, the release and for Isco.\n5:46 Comment: Isco holds on in front of two, the sandwich does not come out.\n5:48 Comment: Magalón, who recovers Rabiot, touches behind the ball for Kevin Trapp, who clears.\n5:54 Comment: Yes, well, and that we have that, entrances from the outside, amplitude and that the team\n5:58 Comment: gives another image, another image of having the ball and knowing what you want to play.\n6:3 Comment: It is very important.\n6:4 Comment: The sounds of the Bernabéu speak a lot.\n6:7 Comment: And we just saw precisely that kind of applause, not only of encouragement but also of approval\n6:12 Comment: to what Guti said, who is doing the team.\n6:15 Comment: Now Di María recovers, in the field, the electric Di María, playing on the right.\n6:20 Comment: Release for Diego Mota, short for Rabiot, well to pressure Toni Kroos.\n6:23 Comment: Central circle, ball for Paris Saint-Germain.\n6:25 Comment: They play left, Maxwell, short for Matuidi.\n6:28 Comment: The fuel does not seem to be exhausted.\n6:30 Comment: Touch back, ball for David Luiz, there are still minutes ahead and they have just come\n6:33 Comment: from the break where, as Marcos said, Rafa Benítez will have corrected and quite\n6:38 Comment: to his own.\n6:39 Comment: For this start, this start of the second, definitive assault.\n6:42 Comment: Two aspirants in Antena 3, in Atresmedia, Champions total, Real Madrid-Paris Saint-Germain.\n6:48 Comment: Play the ball, ball for Cavani, discharge for Matuidi.\n6:51 Comment: The break now for the French.\n6:53 Comment: Touch for Thiago Mota, ball for Rabiot.\n6:55 Comment: Rabiot towards his left profile, steps, drags, throws the ball to Madrid but does not come out.\n7:0 Comment: He knows he has to protect the space rather than looking for the ball.\n7:2 Comment: Jocard wins it, there on the left, Maxwell, to the first stick, banana, the ball reached Ibra.\n7:7 Comment: They are doing a very good thing, which is to have the ball, not rush, make Real Madrid\n7:13 Comment: get out of there and from there, yes, look for their backs.\n7:17 Comment: But in principle, they are controlling the game very well, not only in the first half\n7:21 Comment: but now in the second too.\n7:22 Comment: And Marcos, as you said, with that precision of pass that Paris Saint-Germain has, when\n7:25 Comment: he has it there, he has cornered, or let's say more, put in his field to Madrid.\n7:28 Comment: Wait, wait, wait, Di María, he put his head in the bar, does Madrid do well, protecting\n7:32 Comment: the space rather than going to look for the ball?\n7:34 Comment: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no\n8:4 Comment: It is a trap that he wants to play but he is doing it in his own stadium\n8:7 Comment: Paris Saint Germain also playing with Real Madrid's own public there\n8:12 Comment: Tacos, fly now from Isco who does not appear in the continuation for Cristiano\n8:16 Comment: take a band Thiago Silva, balloon for David Luiz, David Luiz like your idil\n8:21 Comment: Look at how the teammates approach even though David Luiz is unmarked\n8:26 Comment: They approach the unmarked support so that the pass is short\n8:29 Comment: I touch and I go, I always get closer, you have to pay attention to the distribution, look at a rhombus\n8:33 Comment: on the ball, in everything permanent triangles of Paris Saint Germain\n8:38 Comment: Now we see two open centre-backs, a half-centre, always a rhombus, always a\n8:43 Comment: triangle, from there Madrid chases shadows, the team is not comfortable\n8:47 Comment: Madrid in recovering the ball and it is wearing them down\n8:50 Comment: The support also comes, which appears in the space like Di María now, also released for Thiago Mota\n8:53 Comment: Ibra appears, Ibra in the sixth blue, he is going to try, outside\n8:56 Comment: Yes, this also happens a little because the two forwards are pressing high and the defense is too far back\n9:1 Comment: One of the good things would be that, that the defense would push the team forward\n9:7 Comment: because being so long there is always much more space and they are quality players\n9:11 Comment: and there will be many problems to recover the ball\n9:13 Comment: A very erroneous concept in today's football is that when a team concedes goals\n9:18 Comment: or in this case that he does not recover the ball, we look at the midfield and defense only\n9:23 Comment: 11 attack, 11 defend and from there the goal is a consequence of everyone's work\n9:28 Comment: the one who gets the ball well from behind and with an advantage and the clean sheet is the first\n9:33 Comment: striker who presses and squeezes the center backs and invites error\n9:36 Comment: We have news Guas, Marcelo appears on the bench\n9:38 Comment: Yes, he has sat down again with his leg raised, but as I said, there is discomfort in his hamstrings.\n9:43 Comment: He comes to play on the right, Danilo appears there now, Danilo whom Madrid also needs now\n9:48 Comment: in the absence of Marcelo with that rise, that long-range lane, ball there now Gese\n9:53 Comment: Cristiano is not going to arrive, Isco appears to prevent him from leaving, the man from Malaga succeeds\n9:58 Comment: He tries to attack Oriel who stays right on the side of the large area\n10:1 Comment: Isco comes, he goes in, he can search for the profile he likes\n10:3 Comment: The thread with his right leg, Baris Sanger-Benz cut the ball, it goes inside\n10:6 Comment: Thiago had the ball there forcefully, but in the end Thiago Mota lost the ball, Madrid recovers\n10:10 Comment: Gese plays, Gese for Danilo, Danilo puts it behind David Luiz, the rebound complains badly to Madrid\n10:16 Comment: Cristiano falls, two plays in the same, Isco comes, he got bitten, trap corner\n10:24 Comment: That's what Madrid has to do a little, press up, not let Baris Sanger-Benz leave\n10:29 Comment: and then they will have many more problems to have the ball and we will be\n10:32 Comment: much closer to the opponent's area to be able to create scoring opportunities\n10:35 Comment: 11 of the second half, try to hit and hit Real Madrid now\n10:40 Comment: Toni Kroos is going to try to take a corner, he goes there, people applaud him, sounds\n10:46 Comment: the screams, there it is, he wants to place it, marking that, the steps Kroos puts it, to the penalty spot\n10:54 Comment: Marani Ramos jumped, he takes it as a bicycle kick, now as a resource Cavani also, the ball goes to Danilo\n11:0 Comment: Madrid recovers in the Baris Sanger-Benz field, Modric comes to play, Modric playing to the right\n11:4 Comment: For Toni Kroos, Toni Kroos hides it in front of Ibra, he delays the ball, there the obligation is not to lose it\n11:8 Comment: Danilo plays trap, Keylor Navas comes out, Costa Ricense plays it to the left for Nacho\n11:13 Comment: Matuidi presses, the ball goes to Urier and Isco, no, it goes to the wing\n11:17 Comment: Madrid's support was slow, in the end that loss of balls due to the lack of support and reaching the position\n11:23 Comment: before the ball has to make the decision the player who has possession of the ball\n11:28 Comment: I agree with your comment about everyone attacking, everyone defending and Madrid is doing worse with the swarm\n11:32 Comment: As for the school of fish, go all together, for those coverages both in defense and also for support in attack\n11:38 Comment: Di María plays the ball, but now Baris Sanger-Benz tries, Cavani, peak of the area, puts it\n11:43 Comment: very passed, not even Ibra jumped, goal kick\n11:46 Comment: It is also true that Baris Sanger-Benz, superior in terms of play and possession\n11:51 Comment: reaching the front well, it is difficult for him to create scoring opportunities\n11:55 Comment: This second half has a lot more problems, man, and if Cavani is the one who has to put the center in\n11:59 Comment: Well, it will have many more problems, right? because he is an area player who has to do is finish\n12:3 Comment: The only thing that is happening down there while we see the leg and the hamstrings, as we told you, is a voice from Marcelo\n12:10 Comment: who has lost his smile, who never loses it normally, was in a very sweet moment, right?\n12:15 Comment: We will see the extent of the injury, we will tell it as always in the news of this house\n12:20 Comment: Remember that next comes the best summary of Sevilla FC, Manchester City\n12:25 Comment: and there will also be Atlético de Madrid-Cemega with Josep Pedrerol\n12:29 Comment: at 10:30, tomorrow too, the best summaries and details of the FC Barcelona and Valencia CF match\n12:37 Comment: And I also remind you that as soon as we finish our match, the great game, we will be able to enjoy it on Antena 3\n12:43 Comment: as we have also seen in that connection with Pablo Motos and his entire team\n12:46 Comment: of a special edition of Hormiguero 3.0 in which today the leader of Podemos visits and comes to have fun\n12:52 Comment: Paolo Iglesias and Can Lian Callao with that fusion between Ciudadanos and Podemos, right?\n13:0 Comment: He told us...\n13:1 Comment: Let's become citizens\n13:3 Comment: Let's see how people react\n13:5 Comment: There's Toni Kroos, Brog playing the ball for Varane\n13:8 Comment: Casemiro, now for Varane, Rabiot put pressure on him, the ball goes to the Frenchman, he comes out in front\n13:11 Comment: the master profile of the defense, touches the ball, higher and for Modric into space\n13:17 Comment: always advantage for Matuidi, oops Modric about to steal, scratch, door\n13:21 Comment: I still think that Paris-San Germán has the defensive hole on its left side\n13:26 Comment: I think Danilo has to punish and has to force Cavani to defend\n13:32 Comment: and Gesen's options in 1-1 against Urier, I think they are lower than in 1-1 against Masuel\n13:37 Comment: I think that Madrid has to find that 1-1, 2-1 duel that gives them confidence and unbalances a little Paris-San Germán that at the moment is comfortable\n13:48 Comment: Play, ball, there is Modric now keeping the ball with his back between four\n13:52 Comment: What a straw he has thrown at him but as a resource now for Toni Kroos, he fell asleep, Rabiot stole it, Urier arrives first now\n13:59 Comment: If you look at the player who has the ball, the Madrid player who has the ball is having a hard time\n14:4 Comment: because there are no movements and every time they have the ball they don't know who to give the ball to\n14:8 Comment: I think that's what it lacks a bit, movements and doing things much faster with a higher gear.\n14:13 Comment: It is also true that that 1-1 that we said about Masuel, be careful Ibra\n14:17 Comment: Ibra, Ibra, baseline, Van Ank picks it up, what a great game the Frenchman is doing so far\n14:24 Comment: For me, it is one of the best things about Real Madrid, the defensive line in general because I think they are holding up well to the attacks of the PSG players.\n14:34 Comment: He is the most used central defender and even ahead of Sergio Ramos\n14:37 Comment: the user is playing immediately, he is the one with the last pass, moving, touching between the lines\n14:42 Comment: He is doing everything and everything well, yes, yes, he is very confident\n14:45 Comment: We said in the preview that this Paris-San Germán is a team that is also enigmatic, indecipherable, you don't know what they are going to play.\n14:50 Comment: He has a lot of talent but let's see what face he had with Frecero and Bernabéu and at the moment he is measuring up\n14:54 Comment: in Madrid comes the counter, Gese, Gese, 2 for 2, Cristiano opens to leave the space, the other pass is bad, David Luiz arrived\n15:2 Comment: but Madrid tries, there Thiago Mota comes out from the cave now, he puts the ball to the right, Di María's back\n15:8 Comment: who controls next to the touchline where the two technicians are, this is the very even possession\n15:14 Comment: the general term of possession, Guti, you who are also a coach like Marcos, you have to see in which areas of the field you have possession\n15:20 Comment: Yes, yes, what you do with it is clear, I believe that they have been able to make their possession much more profitable than we have.\n15:29 Comment: ball up for Ibra, acrobatic Ramos, comes for Cavani, Varane takes it, Cavani rejects, goal kick\n15:35 Comment: Lucas Vázquez is going to be the second change for Benítez, a player who when he comes in does everything well\n15:40 Comment: Cristiano's best partner this season, Lucas Vázquez\n15:43 Comment: a player who helps the team a lot, defends, presses, who has a route and then has one for an offensive one\n15:50 Comment: that PSG left wing, without a doubt, Lucas Vázquez can do damage there\n15:56 Comment: The band is now where the Real Madrid players are warming up because James came out and received a good ovation from the public.\n16:3 Comment: Without a doubt, James is the player who can give Madrid that point of improvement and hierarchy in the game.\n16:11 Comment: because you were talking about possession, but the important thing is not who has possession or not, the important thing is who is in charge.\n16:17 Comment: PSG is in charge here, Madrid wins but PSG rules\n16:20 Comment: and sometimes possession even distorts that perception, there are teams that have more possession but do not govern the game\n16:27 Comment: I think people at home understand perfectly what we are talking about.\n16:31 Comment: There the ball and possession escape from Real Madrid now talking about that\n16:35 Comment: here the one in charge is Klateburg\n16:38 Comment: Klatenburg no?\n16:39 Comment: that's the one who rules\n16:41 Comment: has the last word, plays, rages, lets go\n16:45 Comment: Rafa always goes to the ground, he always goes to the ground, he goes to the tackle there\n16:49 Comment: That look is very reminiscent of Roberto Carlos in that type of actions, Guti\n16:54 Comment: when it goes to the ground, yes, it's true\n16:57 Comment: Well, there is a ball for Real Madrid on the wing, the change is ready, there is Lucas, Susana\n17:3 Comment: Yes, Lucas Vázquez is already prepared, we will see by whom, surely by Gesell, we will see\n17:9 Comment: by Gesell, that is\n17:11 Comment: Well, the public, there are people who do and there are people who don't, right?\n17:17 Comment: Yes, opinions are divided, right?\n17:19 Comment: yes, applause, whistles\n17:24 Comment: look, there is a change of wing, on Gesell's position, on the left Lucas Vázquez passes to the right\n17:32 Comment: And there I believe that Benítez's idea is what we announced, trying to unbalance Paris Saint Germain\n17:38 Comment: in situations on the left wing of Paris Saint Germain, right wing of Madrid\n17:42 Comment: Modric is coming, they are footballers who, although they do not play in the same position, do share the role\n17:48 Comment: the role, one against one, overflow, that speed, Modric plays the ball\n17:53 Comment: cries of Madrid, Madrid at the Bernabéu\n17:56 Comment: ball that plays there, comes between the lines, receiving Modric, the little Croatian holds it well, the great footballer\n18:2 Comment: Lucas Vázquez falls in the first, there is already a foul, which was caused by the youth player, the Galician\n18:8 Comment: 64 in the match, this continues Real Madrid 1, Paris Saint Germain 0\n18:18 Comment: first with Maxwell, first time overcome and forces a foul, how important it is in football apart from the touch, one for one\n18:24 Comment: That's why there are many teams, right Guti, when you are a coach you have to have both, people who touch but also people who overflow\n18:32 Comment: and do one on one to separate the defense\n18:34 Comment: man, of course, I believe that you have to have everything within a template, but really the important ones are the ones that unbalance\n18:42 Comment: Toni Kroos comes, sets the tone, is warm, second post for Isco's drop shot, easy for Trapp\n18:48 Comment: Kevin Trapp catches, as Laurent Blanc said in the first round match at Parc des Princes, it was him and his defense who saved Paris Saint Germain\n18:58 Comment: today they are Varane, the defense and Keylor Navas, in precision also those of Paris Saint Germain above\n19:4 Comment: Isco finished with his head and now we touch the gap that was made in the first half in case it had opened again\n19:12 Comment: because he fundamentally knows that he would have to leave the field of play again, there he plays the ball in the central circle\n19:17 Comment: Marcos Di María told him, playing the winner, the builder\n19:21 Comment: look, you can see perfectly the rhombus of the medullary, low vertex Mota, high vertex Di María and on one side Rabiota, on the other Matuidi\n19:29 Comment: In the end that forces Madrid to put many inside, when Paris Saint Germain puts many inside, they play the triangle on the outside as we see now\n19:36 Comment: Cabani, Cabani was looking for space, the ball is rejected, it falls to Maxwell again, he touches the defense, but his arms are raised saying that we are doing Isaac\n19:43 Comment: the corner kick for Paris Saint Germain and I thought I saw briefly, I don't know if it was Guas, that Isco was bleeding again\n19:49 Comment: Well, now I just have it on the other end, but it is true that what I said was that the gap was touching all the time, because in that auction\n19:56 Comment: Thanks guys, Susana can actually see herself in the rep, or rather in the short shot, that she is, she has bled again\n20:2 Comment: he just finished off with a header, of course, of course, that's why we said\n20:6 Comment: Paris Saint Germain's corner kicks come, near post, Cabani makes a kind of extension, Keylor comes, Nava, puts his fists in front of Ibra's head\n20:13 Comment: throw-in\n20:17 Comment: Rafa Guerrero would have to tell the referee that he must leave the field of play if he sees him\n20:21 Comment: If, at the moment that any of the five referees perceive it, it is going to leave, it has to dry\n20:27 Comment: and if he wipes it with the shirt, it would be the fourth shirt he would have to wear, but that is what the law and regulations contemplate\n20:34 Comment: well, Thiago Silva's ball, looking for David Luiz there, Cabani does not arrive either, well closed by Danilo\n20:40 Comment: and throw-in for Madrid, Isco, Guas, are watching on the bench\n20:44 Comment: but at the moment he doesn't ask for anything, nor does he offer anything\n20:47 Comment: And there the thing continues, opportunely for Madrid, I say, so that it does not ask for a footballer in this battle in which 11 against 11 is so important\n20:53 Comment: plays up, the pass to Cristiano is anticipated, Thiago Silva is currently very caged today\n20:57 Comment: Watch out for David Luiz's mistake, he took out Isco, Clatenburg comes with the card\n21:3 Comment: and yellow for the Brazilian\n21:6 Comment: These are David Luiz's mistakes, he wants to make a tense pass from behind without looking, like Michael Audrup\n21:13 Comment: and in the end it is a mistake and it is a possibility of counterattack and it could have been necessary because if not the Madrid player would leave alone\n21:18 Comment: Wait a second and Rafa Guerrero also explains it to us\n21:21 Comment: If it is indeed a completely fair card, it has been played there, well, if it were on another side of the field, maybe it would change color\n21:30 Comment: He was lucky that there were many meters left, but totally fair\n21:34 Comment: Now Clatenburg has seen Isco and has warned that he has to leave the field of play\n21:40 Comment: because they have to dry again the blood that is falling from his forehead there\n21:44 Comment: Kroos puts it, Sergio Ramos's acrobatic header even surpasses Adrián Rebelde\n21:50 Comment: The management of the blood, the rapa thing goes quickly, but in the first half we said it, be careful, be careful, offside\n21:58 Comment: We said it in the first half, in the end a player who has blood in today's football loses minutes, takes the team out of the game\n22:7 Comment: The management of that is complicated, I believe that it is an area that the regulations have to study, measure, facilitate\n22:15 Comment: and the coaches have to be fine in their decision\n22:18 Comment: There is an area for improvement without a doubt in the issue of decision and as Marcos says in refining that\n22:24 Comment: play Sergio Ramos, ball for Modric, Modric bear the present of Agomoto, fix where he is going to look now the Italian-Brazilian\n22:30 Comment: ball for the Croatian, he wants to touch, he puts the ball further back that goes to Keylor Navas, Paris Saint Germain also stretches\n22:37 Comment: Isco comes in and he didn't have to change his shirt because this time it didn't get stained\n22:41 Comment: We saw the Guti gesture in real time of the referee authorizing the entry but following the play\n22:46 Comment: yes, yes, the truth is that yes\n22:48 Comment: Right there, Rafa Guerrero saw him live as Clatenburg followed the play, but he made the gesture that you can enter without looking at him, he was looking at the ball.\n22:56 Comment: Indeed, but it is continually receiving information as well and the truth is that it is very good.\n23:2 Comment: the Rafa earpiece, the earpiece works and that's it\n23:6 Comment: like ours, Ricaría plays there playing the ball for Rabiot, tell me\n23:12 Comment: no, no, the earpiece works\n23:16 Comment: for Maxwell, Maxwell with Matuidi, Matuidi comes to put that ball up into space, he protects Madrid well and Cavani is offside\n23:24 Comment: Cavani's offside, Pepe also warms up\n23:28 Comment: There is one good thing that Real Madrid has done, which is to cool down PSG a little. It is true that they are having the ball but they are not getting there like in the first half.\n23:35 Comment: I think it is one of the good things he is doing but he lacks that, having possession, controlling the game a little and having more chances\n23:45 Comment: Let's hope that the entry of Luka Pázquez is good for Real Madrid\n23:49 Comment: Rafa Guerrero, we have seen the replay and I think it is Spitzter's who is ahead\n23:52 Comment: Real Madrid has been lucky now because it was not offside, Cavani was legal, the one who was offside was Ibra but he did not intervene in the play\n24:0 Comment: but he covers the line, I believe there, he is the first man he sees and he surely does not see Cavani in the background\n24:5 Comment: yes, but you can't shoot the first thing that moves\n24:9 Comment: plays the ball up, Madrid clears the ball, there is a throw-in for PSG, 70, we enter the last 20 minutes of the game\n24:18 Comment: and this continues, Real Madrid 1, PSG 0, ​​this is football in A3 media, life in 90 minutes\n24:24 Comment: Play the ball, it's David Luiz's turn, as Marcos said, he has this type of... he's so accomplished physically and technically.\n24:31 Comment: that from time to time there are these types of circumstances that have cost the yellow team, only the yellow team\n24:37 Comment: and that it could have been something more conisco in the rival's play\n24:40 Comment: yes, a player with incredible conditions but nevertheless sometimes makes unforced errors and that in football is a sin\n24:49 Comment: In the end it is to give life to the opposing team, goal options and well in the end it minimizes your performance although we have to say that David Luiz is at the top among the center backs\n25:1 Comment: the other, Di María, you always have to explain that thing because then with tweezers, Matuidi comes playing, Matuidi playing for Di María\n25:8 Comment: We always talk about the comparison with other centre-backs of his level and we talk about the elite whenever we talk about Ramos, Varane, Thiago Silva and company\n25:15 Comment: ball for Ibra, he plays, the triangulation works for PSG, he holds it, the Swede now gives him a little more pause, he plays of Balkan origin\n25:25 Comment: ball again, the Bosnian father and Croatian mother, ball for Thiago Silva, what a mix in the veins of Zlatan Ibrahimović\n25:33 Comment: ball for Thiago, speck for Matuidi, the boss of PSG, he is already going to Madrid there, ball between the lines for Ibra, bad control, that is news but it comes out in the end\n25:41 Comment: now in the takel with Varane who leaves his back exposed, ball to the front, Di María's header, clears the ball, Nacho\n25:50 Comment: However, PSG is missing one for one\n25:55 Comment: ball inside and Masguel appears, Masguel the left back playing messily there, let's see who wins the ball, Modri ​​has to come out to calm down a little\n26:2 Comment: and he doesn't get it clearly, Danilo comes, Ibra wins, the ball goes to Matuidi, the rebound doesn't come out, he goes to the front, the danger continues, Rabiot leaves it with his left foot for Di María\n26:11 Comment: Di María leaves it as a cue with the spur practically inside now, playing to the right for Urier, Urier wants to play it, he shoots at the Mago, Isco ate it, Urier comes\n26:19 Comment: Urier is going to beat him, bottom line, no, Nacho covered well, there is a foul\n26:24 Comment: Urier indeed, about Nacho, yes, Real Madrid too deep, too deep, even if he recovers the ball it is very difficult to get out, because they press very quickly\n26:34 Comment: and they have very few players ahead of them, I think they should give the team a little more, it is true that they are pressing well, it is true that they are reaching well with the ball\n26:44 Comment: but you have to be a little higher to not suffer so much, especially on the edge of the area\n26:48 Comment: However, I believe that Paris Saint Germain will not take long to look for changes on the white bench, if we talk about one for one, one is surely Lucas Moura, the great footballer, then the other option could be Pocho Labetsi\n27:2 Comment: Di María comes up with the ball, the one on one doesn't work, he covered him well, now Casemiro closes him who is called for a foul\n27:8 Comment: the Brazilian complained bitterly, key in this start of the season for Rafa Benítez and his Madrid, diminished, it must also be recognized with the injuries\n27:17 Comment: 12 already, 12 already in the season, 12 injured\n27:22 Comment: plays the ball again, especially spinal injuries, footballers like Benzema in his best moment, James in his best moment, Ramos\n27:32 Comment: That is to say, we are talking about footballers who not only because of talent but also Guti, because of their state of form and what they were doing for the team\n27:38 Comment: Yes, well, but that is what we have to praise right now for the Real Madrid squad, which with so many casualties the team is showing its face, not only here but also in Paris and in the league matches.\n27:48 Comment: the kids especially\n27:50 Comment: Cristiano comes, Cristiano on the right, Danilo sees the space well, the Brazilian does this well, his attack sum, he leaves the ball up there, ball for Lucas, David Luiz puts his arms behind\n27:58 Comment: second post, it looks like Isco, this is a good one, Isco shoots, catches Korné\n28:4 Comment: the best\n28:5 Comment: the best, on Madwell's side and arriving with Lucas Vázquez, they have a lot of problems, when they don't have the ball they have a lot of problems later to come back too\n28:14 Comment: Yes, because it is an offensive team, it is a team with the ball at the foot, stopping it and in the end in the returns, if you look at Guti, little occupation in the area and bad marks\n28:25 Comment: Isco tries to surprise there, punishing the near post, he also had the option of Cristiano going to Kroos when running\n28:30 Comment: Toni Kroos comes, Ibra to the first post, to cover with his meter 95, 97, the ball comes up, second post good left, Ramos appears, they ask him for a foul because he pushed Thiago\n28:44 Comment: correct\n28:47 Comment: we have our Rafa Guerrero, pointing out the controversy in real time\n28:54 Comment: That's it, it's time to stay up there and press higher with what Real Madrid is doing\n28:57 Comment: and look at Laurent Blanc's trap now, because he is prepared Susana Guas, Lucas Moura\n29:3 Comment: Yes, and he also told Laurent Blanc to hurry up and change and at Fabián to enter the field of play, Matuidi leaves\n29:13 Comment: Marcos analyzes it, Lucas's speed\n29:15 Comment: Well, it was predictable, we announced it a little while ago, I think that right now the idea of ​​the game changes a little, I think that Paris Saint Germain is going to start playing 4-4-2 on one side Di María on another Lucas\n29:25 Comment: double 9, Cavani, Ibrahimovic, one against Varane, another against Ramos, forcing Madrid to cover inside\n29:32 Comment: If you look right now there are almost 4 attackers from Paris Saint Germain, 4 defenders from Madrid, we will see a divided team, Paris Saint Germain will lose a little control in the midfield\n29:41 Comment: In the shot they saw of the goal kick from behind the goalkeeper's position it was not visible, but now in the general shot you can clearly see what Marcos is talking about about the 4 against 4\n29:51 Comment: the 2 on the wing and the 2 forwards to divide the Madrid defense, which at the moment, as Guti said, is impeccable, Lucas falls\n29:58 Comment: good Lucas Alcés\n30:0 Comment: If in this case it is important, when we were talking about 4 PSG players, 4 Madrid players, Casemiro's work is very important\n30:8 Comment: because he is the one who has to cover everyone, the 2 center backs cannot be with 2 forwards without having a lot of experience\n30:17 Comment: For him it is very important and for the team it is very important that he is there\n30:21 Comment: Look now David Luiz was trying to cut it because as you say you are on the edge of the precipice\n30:24 Comment: look look team game, now we are going to have street running situations\n30:28 Comment: give and take as we like football at the moment 76 of the game, it is still 1-0 for Real Madrid, playing for the leadership of the group in the Champions League\n30:36 Comment: These Champions total in antenna 3, in A3 medium, ball for Di María, Di María plays it short, central circle, offloads the ball to Diego Mota for Rabiot\n30:44 Comment: Rabiot playing the ball for Mas, goal for David Luiz, he already steps on the boundary, central line, puts it up, Ibra offside\n30:53 Comment: This is now going to be the round trip or at least that's how it is proposed with that change of putting Lucas Moura in for Matuidi\n31:1 Comment: as Marcos said\n31:3 Comment: and important as Guti Casemiro also pointed out in the aid to the 2 center backs\n31:8 Comment: and to the sides too because it is a 4 for 4, ball behind his back, David Luiz protects, Kevin Tra comes out\n31:14 Comment: I think that right now with the PSG change Madrid can have superiority inside, they can have the ball more and force PSG to defend\n31:23 Comment: in a split block, in a street race, back and forth, the team that is winning always does worse\n31:29 Comment: Therefore, although Madrid is a good team in this counterattack cartel\n31:33 Comment: I think I should not enter that game because it is always dangerous\n31:35 Comment: because also, as you say, it is 1-0 and the madness, the chaos perhaps benefits those who want to move and shake the tree\n31:41 Comment: Now Lucas Moura comes there from the left to do it, he tries 1 on 1, he protects him and the help comes to the side now Danilo, Lucas Vázquez\n31:47 Comment: ball for PSG, 2 on 2 is better for Lucas Moura, he can take the shot from the inside\n31:51 Comment: The Brazilian footballer holds on, it's up to Di María to pass, he threw at Uribe, but in the end he goes too long\n31:55 Comment: The French side appears, recovers, wants to put it...\n31:59 Comment: the French team and put his head into Ramos, from a corner kick\n32:2 Comment: about Lucas Moura, a top-level Brazilian player, 1 for 1, very fast\n32:10 Comment: international in all categories for Brazil and a jewel in the crown, a great signing from PSG\n32:17 Comment: He took it away from Manchester United at the last minute\n32:20 Comment: I was going to say it, intended by many in Europe, I agree with him... Palo is coming\n32:23 Comment: It was El Palo, the pole strain where he already flew and his hands flew, they came from Costa Rican Keylor Navas\n32:28 Comment: try again, what a pass with the outside, with the boot that Di María always handles, the left foot\n32:34 Comment: Thiago Silva recovers, now in front of Isco, Isco fuzzy, plays the ball\n32:38 Comment: He shoots Rabiot in the picador and rejects Nacho, ball behind his back, Ibra appears\n32:42 Comment: With him now he accompanies, Modric comes and I watch him cover up\n32:46 Comment: and the ball that is now going behind Lucas Vázquez's back, Lucas Moura recovers\n32:50 Comment: Barys Endermen is going to attack, rejects Madrid's defense, ball again for Maxwell\n32:54 Comment: now is when the team has to leave\n32:57 Comment: and now it is as Guti said, when the team has to throw the line and go upwards to avoid getting involved\n33:2 Comment: but to get stuck, not to sink against Keylor Navas' goal\n33:5 Comment: ball for Thiago Silva\n33:8 Comment: We would have to see, if we had the camera here like Guti\n33:11 Comment: and Marcos saying, as if they were in the band\n33:15 Comment: giving instructions from

Frenchman, the promise, play again\n33:39 Comment: there for Di María, he hides her, Isco comes looking for him now\n33:41 Comment: He does not scratch the ball, he is still in control of Barys Endermen now\n33:44 Comment: playing at the Bernabéu, almost 80 minutes into the game, Real Madrid 1-1 Barys Endermen 0\n33:48 Comment: ball that touches back, ball there for Rabiot\n33:52 Comment:

center of the Real Madrid field, accompanying Luka Modric, who now understands how to defend.\n36:41 Comment: The ball goes into space, Cavani comes, Ibra is in front, Di María is behind, Paris Saint Germain attacks.\n36:46 Comment: Look how Varane comes out to the side and Casimiro gets in there as a center back. The truth is that he does a very important job for the team on a defensive level.\n36:53 Comment: Di María plays the ball, who comes and touches and releases the ball again for Urier. He comes again for Di María, he drops the noodle again now for the side.\n37:2 Comment: The other day in the league match, which Di María decided precisely in the 75th minute, he played as a center back.\n37:8 Comment: Urier, not Di María.\n37:12 Comment: All the same phrase. Luka Mora is coming, I see that you are paying attention. Ball that Varane Luis is going to play.\n37:17 Comment: The ball practically goes over the center line and touches Diago Silva. Di María does it in the square to divide Madrid, who does not enter the trap.\n37:25 Comment: But possession and touch at the moment is for Paris Saint Germain. 83rd minute of play, ball for Ibra.\n37:29 Comment: Between the lines he receives, that's what he is for. He discharges the ball to the left, he wants to pass to Diego Mota.\n37:33 Comment: The ball goes to Lucas Moura, Di María finds it, but it comes to Rembig now to Mateo Kovacic.\n37:38 Comment: The ball behind his back came out. Danilo clears the ball straight out.\n37:43 Comment: Benítez Guas's face keeps talking.\n37:47 Comment: He is not convinced at all, because it is a very fair result.\n37:51 Comment: Yes, because I also believe that Madrid, when Paris Saint Germain has the ball, gradually loses meters.\n37:57 Comment: And in the end the entire team ends up backing down.\n37:59 Comment: We saw Benítez making the gesture to his team to leave.\n38:2 Comment: However, Paris Saint Germain is doing that very well.\n38:4 Comment: With the ball, he gradually gains tile meters.\n38:8 Comment: And in the end he ends up putting all of Madrid in their own area.\n38:19 Comment: Yes, they are warning you that they have to stay at the end of the game, the Paris Saint Germain fans.\n38:23 Comment: Yes, they are at the bottom, at the top, by the way.\n38:25 Comment: Today the tickets were between 50 and 75 euros.\n38:28 Comment: 4,000 Paris Saint Germain fans, Susana.\n38:32 Comment: Protected with a ball, which is a great moment for Madrid.\n38:35 Comment: Paris Saint Germain, Susana.\n38:37 Comment: Protected with a mesh, a net, so that they do not throw objects.\n38:40 Comment: It was a high-risk match and it's the worst, right?\n38:43 Comment: When you go to a stadium as a visitor, you then have to stay for an hour, an hour and a half, for safety.\n38:49 Comment: We said well, he painted the Bernabéu, a sector of the Bernabéu.\n38:52 Comment: It was the sector of the rival fans of the French visitor.\n38:55 Comment: Before the announcement over the public address system in French, so that they understand that they have to stay afterwards for security measures.\n39:1 Comment: Ball for Real Madrid.\n39:2 Comment: Nacho, not only because of the goal, but because after his entry, the truth is that we have seen few rises from Uribe.\n39:8 Comment: I think he is taking advantage of Marcelo's rise a little more to find that gap.\n39:13 Comment: But with Nacho he is having a hard time, honestly.\n39:16 Comment: It doesn't leave as much on your back. Nacho Buti is a footballer who makes very few mistakes, right?\n39:21 Comment: Everything he has to do on defense.\n39:23 Comment: Yes, he is a player who can adapt to any position in the defense.\n39:27 Comment: Left winger, right winger is brought in.\n39:29 Comment: And he always does it on a very high note, right?\n39:31 Comment: The truth is that that is important, right?\n39:33 Comment: Ball for Thiago Silva.\n39:34 Comment: Thiago Silva for Di María.\n39:37 Comment: As Marcos says, he is constantly intervening.\n39:39 Comment: He may be the player who has touched the ball the most times at PSG, or possibly in the game.\n39:42 Comment: Yes, definitely. In the first leg, Ibrahimovic was the radar.\n39:45 Comment: In this second leg it is Di María.\n39:47 Comment: Kroos plays, Madrid recovers.\n39:48 Comment: Balón for Mourinho.\n39:49 Comment: He wants to take her out, but he already has Rabiot on top of him.\n39:50 Comment: As Lolan Blanc knows.\n39:51 Comment: Ball back for Varane.\n39:53 Comment: Clear Varane.\n39:54 Comment: Ball up.\n39:55 Comment: Ball in raffle.\n39:56 Comment: That PSG wins.\n39:58 Comment: I don't see Cristiano.\n40:0 Comment: Today you are not having it, but you can have it at any time.\n40:2 Comment: But Blanc's defensive framework is evidently working.\n40:6 Comment: Good move for PSG.\n40:8 Comment: Look at the reed, it goes in for Di María.\n40:9 Comment: Danger!\n40:10 Comment: Danilo cut the ball, as Ibra arrived.\n40:13 Comment: Di María lost his balance.\n40:14 Comment: There is a moment there when he makes a feint and it seems that he leaves and then he loses his vertical,\n40:19 Comment: because his defense had been completely opened.\n40:22 Comment: It had the entire hallway.\n40:23 Comment: He lost the play, therefore, as Marcos said, the advantage in the play.\n40:27 Comment: There I serve for Keylor Navas.\n40:34 Comment: What confidence from a footballer who, by the way, has already reached the 80th minute.\n40:38 Comment: We are in 86, rather.\n40:40 Comment: He has just broken Emo's record in the Champions League as an unbeaten goalkeeper.\n40:47 Comment: In a greater number of minutes, in this case, with these 80 that he has already had, 86, Keylor Navas.\n40:54 Comment: Well, well, well it shouldn't be.\n40:56 Comment: When he tells Sergio that he has to get him out of the door, well, well, he doesn't have to be fine.\n41:0 Comment: The other day Kiko Kassi had to play.\n41:2 Comment: Against the palms, the Sports Union.\n41:4 Comment: Against the Sports Union, the palms.\n41:6 Comment: Only Madrid has received four goals.\n41:7 Comment: Three Keylors, one Kassi.\n41:10 Comment: Champions ball.\n41:12 Comment: They are currently at the zero goal.\n41:14 Comment: Also that of PSG, with one goal less in favor.\n41:18 Comment: That is why it is played in the free of the group, also because of the direct crossing between the two.\n41:20 Comment: That's why Matuidi said, in the preview, that any tie at one or more would favor him.\n41:24 Comment: Ball played to the left, Laurent Blanc's team comes.\n41:28 Comment: The world also plays the ball to the left.\n41:31 Comment: He puts it in, pass, Ramos cuts.\n41:33 Comment:

    "summary": "In a riveting encounter at the Santiago Bernabéu, Real Madrid faced Paris Saint-Germain in a high-stakes Champions League match that had the famed stadium buzzing with anticipation even before the whistle blew.\n\nThe game kicked off with a ceremonial start, with the Real Madrid President, Florentino Pérez, seen encouraging his players as they stepped onto the field. The fervor of the home crowd was palpable, with 4,000 PSG fans contributing to a vibrant yet tense atmosphere. The match quickly set into motion, with PSG seizing early control and testing the resolve of the home side. The French side's energy was manifesting in their extensive ball possession, spanning across the field, facilitated by their short passing game. \n\nBlaise Matuidi, in particular, was a gust of wind on the field, moving fluidly from his position and creating opportunities for Zlatan Ibrahimović and Edinson Cavani. Matuidi's efforts at hitting through the lines were a challenge the Madrid defense had to expertly nullify, with Isco and Danilo working perpetually to break PSG's rhythm. David Luiz's frequent advances into midfield added another layer of complexity to Madrid’s attempts to establish foothold in early stages.\n\nDespite the defensive diligence displayed by Real Madrid, the game saw moments of intensity and risk, especially when Ibrahimović cleverly freed space and pulled Real Madrid’s defense out of position. Lucas Moura too added an electric edge to PSG's attacks, keeping Marcelo and Varane on their toes. The game's physical nature was exemplified in numerous clashes and rapid play transitions.\n\nReal Madrid's primary strategy was centered around Cristiano Ronaldo and Jese, who sprang forward whenever PSG's midfield lingered in possession. Danilo, Madrid's summer signing, frequently joined these counters, providing rapid outlet downs on the right. Toni Kroos' midfield battle against Thiago Motta and Marco Verratti was a vivid subplot that defined much of the flow in the center of the field. \n\nWhile PSG maintained extensive ball possession, they struggled to convert this into concrete chances, with Real Madrid's backline, led by Sergio Ramos and Raphael Varane, displaying resolute composure. However, challenges emerged with growing frequency, as the lively interplay between Di María, Ibrahimović, and Matuidi stretched Madrid’s defensive shape. Madrid reeled back against these waves, instigated both by PSG’s precision in passes and Madrid’s own defensive recalcitrance to leave spaces behind.\n\nThe defensive discipline paid off defensively as Real Madrid weathered PSG's storms, and took full advantage heating up with counters, supported well by the pivotinCasemiro intercepting multiple Parisian moves. An abrupt halt came when Isco's airborne duel saw a clash with Serge Aurier that left the Madridista bleeding, prompting immediate medical attention, though not hindering his commitment towards the game.\n\nAs the halftime whistle beckoned, both sides had exchanged punches, tactical moves, and counter-moves of high footballing intellect, keeping the scoreline goalless yet steeped in potential, a powder keg waiting for a spark. But the second half only elevated the drama, revealing both teams’ intent clearer than before.\n\nDenouement unfolded when a pivotal substitution saw Marcelo withdraw due to an injury, putting Nacho into the fray. Nacho's impact was immediate and momentous, as just moments later, he capitalized on a mix-up in PSG's defense. Notably, Thiago Silva's header pivoted the ball awkwardly from Kroos’ shot, putting it within arm’s reach for goalie Kevin Trapp only for Nacho to dash in, striking home the rebound to give Real Madrid a critical 1-0 lead, much to the home crowd’s delirium.\n\nPost goal, the push from the French side was incessant; shots from Di María, acrobatic attempts from Ibra, and one powerful diagonal strike from Rabiot that crashed against Keylor Navas’ post showcased PSG’s furnace of talent but also arguably their offensive wastefulness. Every attack was met with disciplined Real defensive poise – Verane, Ramos, and an infield compactness, starring an omnipresent Casemiro, were defining hurdles before Navas’ steadfast goalkeeping.\n\nOn the tactical spectrum, Laurent Blanc re-shuffled his cards bringing in Lucas Moura aiming to escalate width play and Di María’s play reached higher dynamism; yet, Madrid countered well adapting, exemplified by Lucas Vázquez coming effectively post Jese’s exit, bringing energy and vital pressings.\n\nMadrid intermittent counters had emphasis as well when Cristiano Ronaldo, in tandem with Vázquez, sought always plunging PSG's rearguard into moments of acute stress. Lucas’ speed combined with intuitive play with Kroos and Modric allowed Madrid respite lay critical seconds and committing PSG to defensive adjustments – a reflective tale of football chess on display, laying moments of necessity against opponents' desperation.\n\nThe final electrifying minutes as Paris pressed harder missing close-range chances chased by Ibra, and their mortal blow almost landed leveler – Di María’s ripped free kick crashing onto the crossbar, echoing through Madrid’s basin. However, steady resilience saw Madrid’s throbbing hold to the end. The full time resulted a tactical Edinburgh clasping a significant 1-0 win to Madrid, hoisting much-needed group stage control.\n\nThe narrative thus painted a story of resilience, phased tactically timed breakthroughs, and above all, an undeterred stretching performance by a Real Madrid well in a balancing act between youth stepping up (Vázquez and Nacho) seasoned leadership (Ramos, Navas) under Rafa Benítez, withstanding an artful, versatile PSG who looked to run but failed, as a collaborative combative phase could strictly not convert.\n\nPost-match, this induced the crowd’s enduring applause well reflecting the significant win – as the Bernabéu audience bid their appreciations, knowing the night's conquest was well celebrated not just for numeric victory but mental preparedness, against a formidable PSG figuring minimal mistakes resulting therefrom stark advantage. Claudio’s men’s adherence thus was another tale recited beautifully, echoing throughout Europe’s grand showcase of footballing excellence."
