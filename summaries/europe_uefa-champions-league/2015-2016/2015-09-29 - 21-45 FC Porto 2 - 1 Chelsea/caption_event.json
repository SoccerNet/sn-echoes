    "summary": "FC Porto emerged victorious over Chelsea with a thrilling 2-1 win in a highly competitive UEFA Champions League group match. Played at the Estádio do Dragão, the game was an intriguing encounter filled with dramatic moments, high intensity, and impressive displays of individual skills from both teams.\n\n### First Half:\n\nThe match kicked off with FC Porto maintaining early possession and setting a quick tempo. Within the first couple of minutes, Chelsea managed to get the ball out of play, and both teams were engaged in a series of throw-ins, a reflection of the cautious approach each side adopted initially. FC Porto was the first to demonstrate an attacking threat. By the 1:40 mark, they made their first attempt on target, testing Chelsea's defense early.\n\nChelsea tried to find their rhythm but was caught offside at 2:55, leading to a series of indirect free-kicks and another attempt by Chelsea which got cleared away by FC Porto's defense. Chelsea managed their first shot on target at around 5:50, indicating their rising confidence as the match progressed. The tempo of the game was frenetic with exchanges of possession, and both defenses were put under significant pressure early on.\n\nAround the 11-minute mark, FC Porto's Danilo smashed a shot from 26 meters out that unfortunately went wide of the right post, resulting in Chelsea's goal kick. Chelsea retaliated with Pedro's effort on target around the 13th minute, but Iker Casillas, the FC Porto goalkeeper, was alert and managed a comfortable save. Diego Costa was caught offside a minute later, disrupting Chelsea's attacking play.\n\nThe game saw its first foul around the 14th minute committed by Chelsea, and the consequent free-kick by FC Porto led to a series of corner kicks and shots off target by FC Porto. Ruben Neves, who took multiple corners for Porto, saw his efforts intercepted by Chelsea’s resilient defense. This back-and-forth battle continued as FC Porto bravely blocked shots and Chelsea tried breaking through, resulting in several throw-ins and goal kicks.\n\nBruno Martins Indi received a yellow card for a late challenge on the 18:28 mark, increasing the tension in the game. Willian’s subsequent free-kick for Chelsea was cleared easily though, showing FC Porto’s defensive organization.\n\nFC Porto's efforts to break through Chelsea’s defense were relentless. By around the 23rd minute, Yacine Brahimi’s attempts to find his teammates with a pass were thwarted by Chelsea’s quick defense.\n\nA series of fouls and indirect free kicks interrupted the flow of the game. Yet another yellow card was issued, this time to Ivan Marcano at the 24:12 minute for bringing down an opponent. The pace of the game remained high with chances being created but not converted. Chelsea continued to press, with Diego Costa getting a shot off at around the 31:48 mark which was bravely blocked.\n\nThe first goal of the match came in the 38th minute. Yacine Brahimi of FC Porto zig-zagged his way inside the box, only to see his shot saved brilliantly by the Chelsea goalkeeper. However, the rebound fell favorably for Andre, who pounced on the opportunity and slotted it home to make it 1-0 to FC Porto.
