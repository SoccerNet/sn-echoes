manage in Turin?\n13:37 Comment: As I said, they really play completely differently.\n13:40 Comment: Then a few people complain again.\n13:40 Comment: But of course this is a big difference from the approach\n13:44 Comment: what FC Bayern is doing.\n13:45 Comment: And a winger of his quality is of course much, much better off in a system like the one in Munich,\n13:51 Comment: than the more

under control.\n16:52 Comment: Plays very seriously.\n16:54 Comment: And knows that Piraeus relies on quick counterattacks.\n16:59 Comment: They are wide awake.\n17:2 Comment: And otherwise very thoughtful and variable on the outside.\n17:5 Comment: Or rather, that’s how the two goals were scored.\n17:8 Comment: Long shot.\n17:9 Comment: Once Boateng, once Coman.\n17:11 Comment: And Costa put the rebound in.\n17:14 Comment: And after this sensational ball reception.\n17:16 Comment: Lewandowski's 2-0 is also fine.\n17:24 Comment: And that means we have to wait and see how things develop.\n17:33 Comment: But even if they lose, Olympia-Kos can still reach their 8th final today.\n17:39 Comment: Namely if Arsenal do not win the home game against Zagreb.\n17:49 Comment: If Bayern wins, they will be first in the group.\n17:54 Comment: And it is also clear that against Bayern, at that pace and in that form, a back four is not enough.\n18:7 Comment: No matter whether Bundesliga or Champions League.\n18:24 Comment: This is usually a very good step.\n18:26 Comment: But the ball is not that far.\n18:26 Comment: Now they will have to postpone again.\n18:28 Comment: Vidal.\n18:29 Comment: Coman.\n18:30 Comment: A little too pretty.\n18:36 Comment: But Costa has also learned defense here in the first three months.\n18:41 Comment: And not just because he lost the ball himself.\n18:43 Comment: Costas.\n18:44 Comment: Start.\n18:45 Comment: Coman.\n18:46 Comment: El Abdelawi is almost dizzy.\n18:54 Comment: And it's not even too late.\n18:56 Comment: That was a long shot position right now.\n19:6 Comment: Seals.\n19:7 Comment: He could give it a try.\n19:8 Comment: Seals.\n19:9 Comment: With Lahm.\n19:10 Comment: He has time.\n19:11 Comment: And there is

outstanding.\n19:24 Comment: I think all the strikers were involved in this attack in one action, right?\n19:28 Comment: Yes indeed.\n19:28 Comment: That's how it should be.\n19:31 Comment: If you're going to bring in five offensive players, then they should do something for their money.\n19:43 Comment: All right.\n19:43 Comment: It's already been 20 minutes, right?\n19:47 Comment: So.\n19:48 Comment: Seals included.\n19:48 Comment: He can do it again later.\n19:50 Comment: Now comes the slip-up.\n19:51 Comment: And then Coman.\n19:54 Comment: Now it will have to wait and see.\n19:55 Comment: New game situation.\n19:57 Comment: And everything is correct.\n19:58 Comment: No offside.\n20:5 Comment: Selfless.\n20:6 Comment: He could have done the header under Robben himself.\n20:9 Comment: But that's how he puts it in Müller.\n20:10 Comment: He says, man, if Lewandowski has five, I need five too.\n20:15 Comment: Now he has five.\n20:18 Comment: Yes indeed.\n20:19 Comment: That's where the template comes from.\n20:20 Comment: And we saw.\n20:22 Comment: Manuel Costa also says.\n20:24 Comment: All right.\n20:25 Comment: Phew, okay after ninety minutes.\n20:27 Comment: But after twenty.\n20:29 Comment: They had planned things quite differently here.\n20:53 Comment: Well.\n20:54 Comment: He wasn't hurt.\n21:3 Comment: This is a man who has convinced.\n21:7 Comment: But the half position, the eighth position,\n21:10 Comment: that doesn't make it bad.\n21:13 Comment: That doesn't make it bad.\n21:16 Comment: Robin Müller is still in.\n21:24 Comment: That doesn't make it bad.\n21:40 Comment: You can have fun right now.\n21:44 Comment: If Bayern win the ball again soon,\n21:48 Comment: Press your stopwatch and count along.\n21:52 Comment: In front of the gate.\n21:54 Comment: Try to recreate this in training in the district league.\n21:58 Comment: Then the goal.\n22:2 Comment: This is the madman.\n22:22 Comment: The man in the 16-meter space.\n22:45 Comment: The Swiss.\n22:56 Comment: There was already a lazy free kick situation.\n23:0 Comment: You look after 23 minutes,\n23:2 Comment: They really get into the fights, the Greeks.\n23:6 Comment: The Greeks.\n23:12 Comment: That was a half.\n23:28 Comment: How beautifully it went.\n23:32 Comment: There's Lewandowski and he gets him.\n23:36 Comment: It's totally crazy how he takes him with him.\n23:40 Comment: Super layer.\n23:44 Comment: Great start.\n23:48 Comment: And then Lewandowski with a number.\n23:50 Comment: That was a good ball.\n23:52 Comment: He wasn't quite ready yet.\n23:54 Comment: And in falling and pushing.\n23:56 Comment: Very close.\n24:6 Comment: Guardiola can hardly believe that it wasn't a goal.\n24:9 Comment: He has the goal.\n24:19 Comment: This is also Munich’s season.\n24:21 Comment: They look up from above.\n24:23 Comment: Not even half an hour has passed.\n24:25 Comment: 3-0 ahead.\n24:27 Comment: That still doesn't stop.\n24:29 Comment: One falls in from behind unnecessarily.\n24:31 Comment: So far, there is evidence that they have no intention of doing so.\n24:33 Comment: Both not.\n24:35 Comment: To drop one in the back and stop at the front.\n24:37 Comment: We got through the push.\n24:40 Comment: Nothing out.\n24:50 Comment: He brings it there.\n24:56 Comment: Wait, ignore Coman on the left.\n25:4 Comment: That gives Munich a throw-in.\n25:9 Comment: That was a good ball.\n25:16 Comment: He feels comfortable on the pitch,\n25:19 Comment: after he rightly complained about the grass in the arena\n25:22 Comment: complained to

than Madrid and Barcelona, ​​was really looking forward to this match.\n26:48 Comment: This is a more violent action in this game.\n27:48 Comment: Another topic in the Bundesliga before the season.\n27:51 Comment: There was speculation about the 22-year-old Swiss moving to Leverkusen or Mönchengladbach.\n28:15 Comment: We invite you.\n28:17 Comment: They persuade one of their...\n28:18 Comment: If you get your friends to take out a Sky subscription, we will give them 100 euros.\n28:24 Comment: And they say, but my friend is worth much more to me.\n28:26 Comment: You're right.\n28:27 Comment: Try calculating it the other way around.\n28:28 Comment: 100 euros and a subscription for your friend, that's pretty much the whole story.\n28:32 Comment: Everything I couldn’t tell you now is available at sky.de.\n28:48 Comment: Sp.- mãe.\n28:53 Comment: This is her reaction.\n28:55 Comment: Namaste.\n28:58 Comment: Johannes Donkitovic takes over the ball provider.\n29:1 Comment: The

between.\n30:8 Comment: A foul beforehand.\n30:16 Comment: Half an hour passed.\n30:18 Comment: And believe it or not, no goals have been scored in 10 minutes.\n30:21 Comment: The Munich player has not scored a goal for the longest period in this game.\n30:25 Comment: Joshua Kimmich is getting ready.\n30:31 Comment: Early in the evening.\n30:38 Comment: If he had a permanent position, I would tell him where to go.\n30:41 Comment: But since he plays for Vidal as well as in the half positions\n30:44 Comment: can probably play anywhere else,\n30:46 Comment: then I'll just wait.\n30:47 Comment: That's what I meant.\n30:48 Comment: One like that on Coman.\n30:49 Comment: Start.\n30:50 Comment: El Abdelawi in distress.\n30:53 Comment: Rafinha with time.\n30:59 Comment: Vidal.\n31:0

The Brazilian goes to the left.\n32:24 Comment: The Frenchman Coman goes to the right side.\n32:32 Comment: Comes to the trophy cantons.\n32:35 Comment: Nowiola and Lewandowski.\n32:52 Comment: Especially since Lewandowski is not relaxed.\n32:57 Comment: Wiedal denied a shot opportunity.\n33:2 Comment: Finja, Coman.\n33:9 Comment: And Müller isn’t giving that away either.\n33:12 Comment: He definitely wants it.\n33:14 Comment: It's getting a little inaccurate up there at the moment.\n33:16 Comment: Kimmich is there too.\n33:16 Comment: Vidal.\n33:20 Comment: But nonetheless, Munich's overwhelming superiority.\n33:24 Comment: And I already hinted at that earlier.\n33:26 Comment: Even a defeat would be enough for Olympia-Kos.\n33:32 Comment: But only if Arsenal don't win.\n33:40 Comment: And now that we have gone through the slow motion, I can tell you\n33:41 Comment: But they are 2-0 ahead.\n33:43 Comment: Team of Mesut Özil and Pert Mertesacker.\n33:48 Comment: And that means that Bayern, through group winners\n33:50 Comment: and a perfect final.\n33:57 Comment: Piraeus vs Arsenal.\n33:59 Comment: The Greeks won the game in London late with 3.\n34:2 Comment: Won 3-2.\n34:11 Comment: But even then a draw would be enough for Olympia-Kos.\n34:18 Comment: This is the status after half an hour.\n34:20 Comment: Not that you're saying I've already closed all the games.\n34:23 Comment: Not that one.\n34:32 Comment: But this is the situation after half an hour.\n34:35 Comment: And there it is again.\n34:35 Comment: And that’s where Müller sits.\n34:40 Comment: Lewandowski comes shortly.\n34:42 Comment: Coman is back again.\n34:45 Comment: And there is a corner.\n34:48 Comment: He didn't need any effort at all to get into this team, into this league.\n34:51

can understand if some players are angry and disappointed,\n35:31 Comment: when they don't play.\n35:32 Comment: But then they should think like Joshua Kimmich.\n35:34 Comment: He just keeps going and gives it his all in training.\n35:39 Comment: And he acts as if he were a regular player in terms of his attitude.\n35:43 Comment: This quote, he is almost like a son to me.\n35:45 Comment: Pep Guardiola about Joshua Kimmich.\n35:49 Comment: And with all the quality that it already brings.\n35:51 Comment: Of course, that makes you a bit wider at 20.\n35:55 Comment: And one with 38 a little bit slimmer.\n35:58 Comment: Markus Silva with fun, without fear.\n36:1 Comment: That was the requirement here.\n36:3 Comment: And now fear is without fun.\n36:4 Comment: You can still feel it.\n36:8

Lewandowski.\n36:38 Comment: And Lewandowski.\n36:46 Comment: Coman should do it himself.\n36:49 Comment: Well, then he'll just do it himself.\n36:50 Comment: Coman, Coman, lob, Lewandowski is there.\n36:53 Comment: Vidal.\n36:54 Comment: Two options.\n36:55 Comment: Kimmich.\n36:57 Comment: Yes.\n37:0 Comment: That fits.\n37:1 Comment: The precision has decreased a bit.\n37:2 Comment: The super pressure, but even now after 37 minutes still,\n37:8 Comment: when Bayern see the chance to win the ball quickly,\n37:11 Comment: then they snap.\n37:15 Comment: And from Pireus, apart from the immensely high shirt numbers 92, 99, 90 in front,\n37:21 Comment: nothing left to see.\n37:32 Comment: Müller, here too he is in between.\n37:34 Comment: It hurts.\n37:51 Comment: Seba.\n37:52

willingness to run is truly remarkable.\n38:55 Comment: Especially when the lead is 3-0.\n38:59 Comment: Everyone in motion.\n39:2 Comment: And with ball security.\n39:2 Comment: The ball is immediately captured and directed towards the opponent’s goal.\n39:15 Comment: Coman Müller runs in.\n39:16 Comment: And there is a lot of space.\n39:17 Comment: That's what I meant.\n39:18 Comment: They then move in.\n39:19 Comment: Space for Coman.\n39:20 Comment: Lahm is there too.\n39:21 Comment: This is the captain.\n39:22 Comment: So he brings in Lewandowski.\n39:24 Comment: Try with the

Comment: Abdelawi, Costa of course following, ball recovery, Vidal.\n40:40 Comment: That's too fast for Piriuz.\n41:1 Comment: The number of duels he's clearing these days is also unbelievable.\n41:7 Comment: Douglas Costa was only ever known as a super-fast winger during his time in Donetsk.\n41:14 Comment: Boateng gave it away, then committed the foul, which wasn't one.\n41:20 Comment: But it was still there from outside.\n41:24 Comment: The command for the foul, i.e. free kick, yellow card, was not the last man, Jerome Boateng.\n41:31 Comment: So, he let himself be tricked quite easily.\n41:40 Comment: Now it's too late, pushes him over, the yellow, the one from the 16-yard box, that's a free kick.\n41:51 Comment: And I am relatively sure that the decision was influenced from

Comment: This is going too smoothly for me now.\n25:10 Comment: He just knocks him over after that.\n25:12 Comment: And the ball is still in play.\n25:14 Comment: So from that point of view, there is nothing to show here.\n25:16 Comment: Not at all.\n25:18 Comment: I find it difficult to deal with red now, even though it is still a slap in the face.\n25:21 Comment: The ball was gone.\n25:22 Comment: So now, when everyone is complaining, I’m right there with them and I say,\n25:26 Comment: Eriksson completely misjudged this.\n25:29 Comment: Correct, it is a goal.\n25:32 Comment: But it's not true that Ricardo is still standing there.\n25:35 Comment: Undisturbed.\n25:36 Comment: And it doesn't work.\n25:51 Comment: 20 minutes left, the ball goes out because there are now another substitution.\n25:57 Comment: And it is not Kingsley Coman, whom they have restored,\n26:0 Comment: but for me it is the most striking man of the evening so far.\n26:5 Comment: Douglas Koster.\n26:5

    "summary": "Bayern Munich secured a dominating 4-0 victory over Olympiakos in a Champions League clash, showcasing their exceptional skills and strategic prowess. From the outset at the Allianz Arena, Bayern Munich demonstrated why they are a force to be reckoned with on the European stage, with both teams entering the match with distinct objectives. The Bavarians aimed to secure their spot as group leaders, while Olympiakos sought to bolster their chances of advancing past the group phase.\n\nAs the match kicked off, Bayern Munich, donning their iconic red jerseys, showed a sense of purpose immediately. The weather was typical for late November, with temperatures hovering around freezing, adding an extra layer of challenge for the players. The first few minutes saw Bayern asserting their dominance, pushing all their field players into the Greek half and quickly establishing their presence.\n\nBy the 8th minute, Bayern's relentless pressing paid off. Jerome Boateng, playing as an advanced defender, delivered a beautifully fluttering ball that found Douglas Costa in the right place at the right time. Costa, seizing the moment, executed a precise shot that saw the ball nestle into the net, giving Bayern a well-deserved 1-0 lead. This early goal set the tone for what was to be a masterclass in both offensive and defensive football from the Bavarians.\n\nOlympiakos, who entered the match with a perfect domestic record of 10 wins from 10 games, found themselves struggling to keep up with Bayern's pace and fluidity. The visitors, dressed in blue, repeatedly found their defensive lines stretched, particularly on the flanks where Arjen Robben and Kingsley Coman constantly threatened. \n\nBayern continued their onslaught, and in the 15th minute, another moment of brilliance unfolded. Kingsley Coman, on loan from Juventus, demonstrated why he is highly regarded with a deft movement on the left side. He found Robert Lewandowski, who, despite the attention of the Olympiakos defenders, managed to slot the ball home, doubling Bayern's lead to 2-0. The Polish striker's goal further disheartened the Greek side, who struggled to consolidate their defense.\n\nThroughout the first half, Bayern's strategy was evident. They exploited the wings, kept Olympiakos under constant pressure, and ensured that any offensive maneuvers by the Greek side were promptly neutralized. The midfield trio of Xabi Alonso, Arturo Vidal, and Thomas Müller provided stability and creativity, orchestrating plays and maintaining possession. The constant switching between high pressing and structured buildup kept Olympiakos guessing and off-balance.\n\nBy the 20th minute, Bayern's tactical planning bore more fruit. Thomas Müller, ever the poacher, was in the right place to capitalize on a well-crafted attack. Combining efforts from Costa and Coman, he found himself in front of goal and made no mistake, making it 3-0 for Bayern. The coordination and understanding among Bayern's attacking players were on full display, showcasing fluid passing and intelligent positioning.\n\nDespite being three goals down, Olympiakos tried to mount a response. Their efforts, however, were continuously thwarted by Bayern's rock-solid defense led by Boateng and Holger Badstuber. Manuel Neuer, acting as a sweeper-keeper, was ever alert to any threats, although the first half saw him more involved in distributing the ball and intercepting through passes than making saves.\n\nPep Guardiola's side remained disciplined and varied in their approach. The defense transitioned seamlessly into attack, with full-backs Philipp Lahm and Rafinha frequently pushing forward to support the wingers. Bayern's tactical flexibility was further demonstrated as Joshua Kimmich replaced Arjen Robben early in the second half due to a slight muscle concern for the Dutch winger, an example of Guardiola's cautious and calculated approach to player fitness.\n\nThe second half picked up right where the first half left off, with Bayern continuing their dominance. Kimmich slotted into the midfield, and Bayern maintained their high tempo. The game saw some robust exchanges, but Bayern's superior skill and technical ability kept them in control. Despite some attempts from Olympiakos, including a few forays into Bayern's half, they couldn’t penetrate the Bavarian defense.\n\nBayern's fourth and final goal came in the 85th minute. Kingsley Coman capped off a magnificent personal performance with a well-taken header, showcasing his aerial ability, an aspect perhaps surprising given his stature. The assist came from Joshua Kimmich, highlighting the strength in depth that Bayern possess, with Kimmich stepping up admirably in Robben's absence. \n\nOlympiakos' attempts to gain a foothold were stymied throughout. While they did create a couple of opportunities, Bayern's defensive discipline ensured that Neuer was rarely troubled. The Greek side, visibly dejected, struggled to form coherent attacks as the match progressed, and Bayern's relentless pressing and superior tactical setup left them chasing shadows.\n\nIn conclusion, Bayern Munich's 4-0 victory was a perfect representation of their prowess. With each goal, they showcased a blend of individual excellence and cohesive team play. The victory not only secured them the top spot in their group but also sent a clear message to their European rivals. Olympiakos, although well-beaten, had moments that displayed their potential, but they were ultimately overpowered by a significantly superior Bayern side.\n\nThroughout the game, Bayern's approach was methodical, their execution precise, and their dominance unquestionable. Each player's contribution was pivotal, from Neuer's sweeping to Coman's dynamism on the wing. The team's balance, between attack and defense, and the seamless transitions orchestrated by Guardiola, highlighted why Bayern Munich is a perpetual threat in any competition they participate in. \n\nThis match served as a testament to Bayern Munich's ability to rise to the occasion, executing strategies with clinical precision and underlining the depth and quality of their squad. It was a masterclass that left fans in awe and opponents wary of the challenge that Bayern presents on the grand European stage."
