Petersburg.\n0:8 Comment: Zenit are the only side boasting a 100% record to this point.\n0:13 Comment: Valencia might have the work cut out for them, but they did win their last away game 5-1\n0:19 Comment: at Celta Vigo.\n0:21 Comment: Three successive defeats on the travels prior to that, however.\n0:25 Comment: Let me say good evening to Chris Sutton.\n0:26 Comment: Chris, what are you expecting?\n0:28 Comment: I'm expecting a cagey start from both teams.\n0:32 Comment: Interesting to see how Zenit set up because Neto, naturally a defender, looks as if he's\n0:37 Comment: just sitting in front of the back four.\n0:40 Comment: Big night for that guy in the picture, Andres Villas-Boas, talking about trying to get the\n0:45 Comment: six wins of the first team since Spartak Moscow.\n0:48 Comment: But for Valencia, they've been erratic all season.\n0:53 Comment: Capabilities in the side, but a real vulnerability about them defensively.\n1:0 Comment: With Mustafi falling foul to injury at the weekend, it's a big night.\n1:6 Comment: Lombard's from the back, a head flick by Zyuba, and he's very effective in that regard.\n1:14 Comment: Talk about the players who make things happen for Zenit, you're really talking about Dani\n1:21 Comment: and Hulk and Zyuba.\n1:23 Comment: Hulk going after it, it's helped on its way by Dani.\n1:26 Comment: As Valencia try to string a few passes together, but there's Axel Witzel winning it back for\n1:32 Comment: Zenit.\n1:33 Comment: Yeah, I was going to say, it's a big night for Ruben Bezo, and he mustn't get sucked\n1:39 Comment: into a physical battle with Zyuba.\n1:41 Comment: I don't think he can cope with him aerially.\n1:44 Comment: Hulk was on the move, trying to work something with Oleg Shatov.\n1:50 Comment: Valencia try to knock it forward to Paco Alcacer.\n1:54 Comment: Eyebrows were raised when the team sheets were handed out, and number 37 over there\n1:58 Comment: on the left for Valencia in the starting line-up, Rafa Milla.\n2:4 Comment: It's his first appearance for the first team.\n2:9 Comment: Just 18, 18 years, 159 days.\n2:14 Comment: Second youngest Champions League debutant in Valencia history.\n2:18 Comment: It's a massive call.\n2:22 Comment: Nuno Espirito Santo.\n2:24 Comment: In fact, he's got Santi Mina on the bench, says that he's had faith with the young man.\n2:34 Comment: Nuno Espirito Santo, the man you were talking about, Chris.\n2:39 Comment: One or two question marks hovering over his future with Valencia.\n2:42 Comment: The white handkerchiefs were out in force at the end of the Las Palmas match on Saturday\n2:48 Comment: night.\n2:49 Comment: Alcacer trying to create space.\n2:57 Comment: First shot of the game.\n2:59 Comment: Paco Alcacer for Valencia.\n3:1 Comment: Alcacer, clever with his back to goal.\n3:3 Comment: Good ball in to his feet from Gomez.\n3:6 Comment: Lovely touch with that right foot to get away from Lombard.\n3:10 Comment: Doesn't really get the power which he desired with his left foot.\n3:20 Comment: The other early kick-off and a goal for Bate Borisov against Leverkusen.\n3:24 Comment: That game at the Borisov Arena, 450 miles to the south of here.\n3:36 Comment: Handball there from Gomez.\n3:40 Comment: Just anchoring that midfield with Witzel.\n3:43 Comment: I'd say that Zenit are more of a 4-2-3-1.\n3:47 Comment: Witzel's pass, he tried to link the play.\n3:52 Comment: To the near side, Domenico Criccito, the Italian left back, flicked in by Shattoff.\n4:1 Comment: There to control it, Aymen Abdenour in his first season with Valencia.\n4:6 Comment: The former Monaco man, Valencia defeated over two legs in the Champions League play-off round this season.\n4:20 Comment: Just going back to that Bate match, Mikhail Gordechuk.\n4:24 Comment: The goal for Bate, we're hearing a dreadful mistake from Bernd Lehder in the Leverkusen goal.\n4:32 Comment: Shattoff with the long throw.\n4:35 Comment: Abdenour had to react.\n4:38 Comment: Yes, a good weapon, the long throw.\n4:40 Comment: He's got a physical presence with Zuber, but he's not just a target type, he's intelligent.\n4:46 Comment: He can move in behind.\n4:49 Comment: He's got a pretty decent goal-scoring record as well.\n4:52 Comment: Easy to pick out Zuber in the middle of that crowd.\n4:58 Comment: Hulk will, if not try to find him, then another of the tall targets.\n5:3 Comment: Just drifting out.\n5:5 Comment: Expect a bit more for 60 million euros.\n5:10 Comment: Hans-Ul Witzel up for the set-piece as well.\n5:16 Comment: It's interesting to look at Zenit and the style of play, Chris.\n5:19 Comment: There are those who say that it amounts to waiting for the opposition to make a mistake\n5:26 Comment: Hulk and Dani, and this season, Zuber.\n5:30 Comment: I'm not one of those, it's about winning football and being effective.\n5:37 Comment: Feguli, that measured pass intended for Alcacer.\n5:42 Comment: Nothing wrong with the idea.\n5:44 Comment: Valencia are accomplished on the ball.\n5:47 Comment: Technical players in the middle of the park, Feguli, who's been linked with Manchester United and Chelsea.\n5:52 Comment: A lovely ball through, and Alcacer's clever with his movement.\n5:56 Comment: You don't play for Spain unless you're an intelligent player.\n5:59 Comment: You can see him trying to get in between the two centre-halves there.\n6:4 Comment: Here again is Safian Feguli.\n6:8 Comment: Algerian international.\n6:12 Comment: Against Russia at the last World Cup.\n6:15 Comment: That's what Hulk is all about.\n6:18 Comment: Cheers from the home crowd.\n6:21 Comment: Feguli there to mop up.\n6:23 Comment: Cancelo has the right back, he loses out to Hulk.\n6:28 Comment: He went on his way again.\n6:30 Comment: He's jousting with young Ruben Veso.\n6:36 Comment: That's what Hulk's about.\n6:37 Comment: We saw him in footage before the programme.\n6:41 Comment: A lot of quality, good dribbler, he's a powerhouse, a finisher.\n6:46 Comment: He's also got a good eye for a pass.\n6:48 Comment: Valencia's problem this season, Derek, is defensively.\n6:52 Comment: They've been weak at the weekend against Las Palmas.\n6:55 Comment: They were lucky to get away with the draw in the end.\n7:3 Comment: Hulk at 29.\n7:8 Comment: It really is a joy to watch.\n7:12 Comment: Andres Gomez.\n7:14 Comment: Patrick Innsmouth, player for Valencia.\n7:17 Comment: Previously with Benfica.\n7:21 Comment: Last season, Valencia on loan, that deal made permanent.\n7:26 Comment: Took that with quite a few during the summer.\n7:30 Comment: The link is there between Nuno, the Valencia coach, and super-agent Jorge Mendes.\n7:37 Comment: Nuno was his very first client quite a few years ago now.\n7:41 Comment: He was on the books at Deportivo.\n7:44 Comment: I think that's a disappointment for a lot of the Valencia supporters.\n7:47 Comment: â‚¬131m spent over the summer.\n7:51 Comment: Not much to show for a good finish last season in La Liga.\n7:55 Comment: Often when you buy potential,\n8:0 Comment: there's a tendency to be a little bit inconsistent with performances.\n8:3 Comment: And that's how it's panned out this season so far.\n8:7 Comment: Dani Parejo.\n8:9 Comment: He's feeding it back.\n8:11 Comment: Here's Joao Cancelo.\n8:14 Comment: A former Benfica player.\n8:15 Comment: He's under contract with Valencia until 2021.\n8:19 Comment: It seemed to be the policy in the summer to sign up\n8:22 Comment: as many of the younger players as possible\n8:25 Comment: for quite a few years.\n8:28 Comment: Now it does.\n8:30 Comment: You see Valencia have set up with a 4-3-3.\n8:35 Comment: Rafa Mir having that left touchline.\n8:39 Comment: Dani Parejo.\n8:41 Comment: And they give it to Andre Gomez.\n8:44 Comment: That block was in place for Zenit.\n8:46 Comment: Here's Witzel. The flick back to Dani.\n8:50 Comment: Axel Witzel showing for it again.\n8:53 Comment: Dani comes away with the ball.\n8:56 Comment: No way through against Ruben Veso.\n9:0 Comment: And that's what Zenit are about.\n9:3 Comment: Sucking Valencia in and trying to hit them at pace on the counter.\n9:6 Comment: Here's Feghali. Angle ball.\n9:12 Comment: Lombard's had to react. It's Feghali again.\n9:18 Comment: And it grinds to a halt for Los Che.\n9:22 Comment: No scoring. Nearly 10 minutes on the stopwatch in St. Petersburg.\n9:26 Comment: Valencia don't really have a physical presence to score\n9:30 Comment: off high crosses.\n9:32 Comment: Looking for clever movement.\n9:34 Comment: Giving goes in and around the box.\n9:42 Comment: It did wonder, Chris, about 4 at the back or 5 at the back for Zenit.\n9:45 Comment: You can see Neto there.\n9:47 Comment: He's in front of the 4.\n9:49 Comment: They have the flexibility to make him an extra defender.\n9:52 Comment: If need be, go with wingbacks.\n9:55 Comment: Yeah, that's right. They've got options.\n9:58 Comment: You see a lot of this.\n10:0 Comment: Valencia controlling the possession.\n10:3 Comment: For Zenit, it's simply about getting a result and going through.\n10:6 Comment: I know they'd like to win the game.\n10:9 Comment: 5 on the spin and maybe get to those 6 wins.\n10:13 Comment: But it's about going through and finishing top of the group is\n10:16 Comment: an advantage, I think, unless you're desperately unlucky.\n10:20 Comment: Stolmali ought to be an advantage.\n10:23 Comment: Vettel with the foul on Joao Cancela.\n10:28 Comment: Nuno just briefly off his seat.\n10:30 Comment: He had a name for himself as a coach at Rio Abreu and\n10:32 Comment: fashionable Portuguese club.\n10:35 Comment: Holding them to promotion and a cup final appearance.\n10:41 Comment: Abdeloua.\n10:44 Comment: Guyar, as usual, over there at left back.\n10:49 Comment: Another youngster.\n10:50 Comment: It is a very youthful Valencia team.\n10:54 Comment: It's Zenit who are just matching up with the 3 in the midfield.\n10:59 Comment: Rafa Milla against Igor Smolnikov, who couldn't quite find it.\n11:5 Comment: 27-year-old defender.\n11:12 Comment: And Yukov for Zenit.\n11:16 Comment: Missing his vast experience.\n11:20 Comment: They've got a player who's a vast experience himself,\n11:23 Comment: a Russian international.\n11:25 Comment: He can play up one on that right-hand side or at right back.\n11:30 Comment: He's got good options in the squad.\n11:34 Comment: Akeel Garai trying to release Hulk.\n11:38 Comment: Lombards from the back for Zenit.\n11:42 Comment: Hulk, Zane.\n11:45 Comment: Those two usually have an almost intuitive understanding.\n11:49 Comment: A feature of the team.\n11:52 Comment: A feature of Valencia's game is to get the full-backs on\n11:55 Comment: and play expansive football with Zenit.\n11:58 Comment: The full-backs will be more of a back support.\n12:0 Comment: You won't see them bombing on as much.\n12:2 Comment: They'll rely on the ability of Hulk and Shattoff to create.\n12:7 Comment: Zane enjoying a bit of space.\n12:9 Comment: Smolnikov.\n12:12 Comment: Strong header away by Abdeloua.\n12:14 Comment: Here is Witzel.\n12:18 Comment: Hulk.\n12:19 Comment: Now Crescito pops up in the attacking position.\n12:22 Comment: Perez-Dewt.\n12:23 Comment: Deflection there.\n12:25 Comment: And then cleared away at the vital moment.\n12:29 Comment: They had bodies back, Valencia.\n12:31 Comment: Good thing too from their point of view.\n12:33 Comment: There I was saying you won't see the full-backs on\n12:35 Comment: and Crescito gets on, gets a break of the ball there.\n12:38 Comment: A little deflection on the cross.\n12:41 Comment: Yaomi is found wanting there.\n12:44 Comment: It's good cover.\n12:47 Comment: Good position.\n12:48 Comment: Gaya on the line.\n12:53 Comment: Up with a corner.\n12:54 Comment: A little nick on its way through.\n12:58 Comment: Last-ditch defending earlier from Jose Gaya.\n13:3 Comment: Emerging talent.\n13:6 Comment: Hulk.\n13:10 Comment: There it ends for now as far as Zenit are concerned.\n13:13 Comment: I think Hulk is 100% sure.\n13:17 Comment: Looking across the line there.\n13:18 Comment: I think he is just half a yard offside.\n13:25 Comment: It would be interesting to see whether, I mean,\n13:28 Comment: Valencia would be happy with a point.\n13:30 Comment: I think there are all sorts of permutations.\n13:32 Comment: But a point certainly wouldn't be the worst thing for Valencia.\n13:37 Comment: It would still be in their favor.\n13:40 Comment: The worst thing for Valencia would still be in their hands\n13:43 Comment: going into the final game.\n13:48 Comment: Valencia very much on the get-watch.\n13:52 Comment: The other contenders in the group can't completely rule out\n13:56 Comment: Olympique Lyonnais, but it's just about the longest\n13:59 Comment: of long shots for them.\n14:3 Comment: Certainly the talk in the Valencia camp was\n14:5 Comment: they're here to win the game.\n14:6 Comment: As you said, pragmatism sometimes takes hold\n14:9 Comment: in the heat of battle, Chris.\n14:11 Comment: Yes, I think with Lyonnais, if they win tonight,\n14:13 Comment: they still have a chance.\n14:14 Comment: Because if they go to Valencia and beat them by two-click goals,\n14:17 Comment: but as long as Valencia don't win in Zenit.\n14:22 Comment: So I suppose both these teams just need to take care of themselves.\n14:26 Comment: Lombard's on the back, it's come to Hulk.\n14:29 Comment: Trying to time the pass.\n14:31 Comment: And Ubenvezo stretching out.\n14:34 Comment: Shattoff had to score for Zenit.\n14:39 Comment: There's no stopping Zenit St. Petersburg\n14:42 Comment: in this season's Champions League.\n14:46 Comment: But the defending was not of a very high standard.\n14:51 Comment: Oleg Shattoff with the goal for the home side.\n14:55 Comment: Well, we've spoken about Valencia's vulnerability at the back\n14:58 Comment: all season and once again completely exposed.\n15:2 Comment: Just a long hopeful ball in the first place.\n15:6 Comment: Ubenvezo doesn't get to grips with Zuber.\n15:8 Comment: And as it breaks, Shattoff on the half-turn.\n15:11 Comment: I just wondered whether he'd taken an extra touch.\n15:14 Comment: Which he didn't need to and he could have shot earlier.\n15:17 Comment: But when he gets turned, the touch sets him up.\n15:20 Comment: It's a composed finish into the corner.\n15:25 Comment: Masiomai.\n15:28 Comment: It's just the start. Zenit wandered and Valencia.\n15:32 Comment: A big job on the hands now.\n15:35 Comment: Second goal in this group stage for Oleg Shattoff.\n15:38 Comment: He's on target in the 2-1 victory over Ghent.\n15:43 Comment: Has been linked with Borussia Dortmund amongst other clubs.\n15:51 Comment: Valencia will be very disappointed with that concession.\n15:54 Comment: Yes, they will. But as I said in the first place, it was just a long ball.\n15:58 Comment: Ubenvezo got sucked underneath it.\n16:1 Comment: Zuber.\n16:2 Comment: And as the ball breaks, Hulk is aware enough to slide the ball through.\n16:9 Comment: And then it's all about the finish.\n16:11 Comment: Yellow card for Chrichito as he pulled back Joao Cancelo.\n16:18 Comment: No complaints there.\n16:21 Comment: A bit too close comfort there.\n16:25 Comment: I know it's cold.\n16:31 Comment: Looking for something to cling on to, apparently.\n16:33 Comment: Domenico Chrichito.\n16:36 Comment: Join Zenit back in 2011 from Genoa.\n16:39 Comment: Legacy of the Luciano Spalletti era.\n16:45 Comment: Here's Aqeel Garay. Zenit's Argentinian central defender.\n16:50 Comment: Whistle's gone. Sven-Odvar Moen.\n16:54 Comment: Right up with the action.\n16:56 Comment: I'm not so sure that Andrei Gomez will feel aggrieved there.\n17:0 Comment: Neto taking too long on the ball.\n17:3 Comment: Just lost that and goes down too easily for me.\n17:8 Comment: I think the referee's got that one wrong.\n17:11 Comment: Just before then you see the long straight ball into Alcacer.\n17:16 Comment: And Zenit will deal with that.\n17:19 Comment: Ubenvezo sucked under the ball.\n17:21 Comment: Doesn't read the flight of the ball well.\n17:24 Comment: And they get a little break.\n17:27 Comment: Nice pass in.\n17:28 Comment: That extra touch just sets him up.\n17:30 Comment: That's a nice finish.\n17:32 Comment: Just to the side of Yaume.\n17:36 Comment: To the corner.\n17:39 Comment: Oleg Shatsov who joins Zenit from Anzhi Mahatchkala in 2013.\n17:48 Comment: A spin of the turn by Thiba.\n17:50 Comment: And Valencia not looking very confident defensively.\n17:56 Comment: Down went Dani that time.\n18:0 Comment: We talked about the loss of Mustafi.\n18:4 Comment: Even with him in the side this season, it looked vulnerable, Derek.\n18:9 Comment: There's always going to be a tough ask.\n18:12 Comment: They've got two 21-year-olds, a 20-year-old at left back.\n18:16 Comment: And just Abdenal who's got the experience at 26.\n18:20 Comment: Zouba.\n18:24 Comment: Very important focal point.\n18:26 Comment: An attack. Now Dani and Hulk.\n18:28 Comment: Racing away again back towards Zouba.\n18:32 Comment: The flag was up.\n18:36 Comment: That must have been close just from Hulk's reaction.\n18:39 Comment: But what a wonderful pass from Dani.\n18:42 Comment: I think you can see quite clearly he's level.\n18:44 Comment: And he should be given the advantage.\n18:46 Comment: Great awareness.\n18:49 Comment: Zouba I'm sure would have fancied his chances from that range.\n18:52 Comment: That's what I like about Hulk as well.\n18:54 Comment: He's not just all about pace and power.\n18:56 Comment: He gets his head up, can pick a pass.\n19:0 Comment: I can feel slightly aggrieved there, Zenit.\n19:11 Comment: 1-0 to Zenit St. Petersburg on this UEFA Champions League Tuesday.\n19:16 Comment: Great to have you with us on BT Sport.\n19:20 Comment: With the early coverage.\n19:23 Comment: Hulk trying to keep his balance.\n19:27 Comment: Lombards and Witzel.\n19:30 Comment: Vacuum cleaner just in front of the defence.\n19:32 Comment: Nico Lombards back the way to Yuri Lodygin.\n19:37 Comment: And Zouba has brushed off him.\n19:39 Comment: Hulk returning the favour to Zouba.\n19:43 Comment: Zouba.\n19:44 Comment: Important tackle was by Ruben Vezo for Valencia.\n19:48 Comment: Here's Andre Gomez.\n19:51 Comment: Away by Smolnikov.\n19:57 Comment: Here's Dani.\n20:0 Comment: Captain playmaker.\n20:1 Comment: Could have got one for Witzel to win.\n20:3 Comment: Feguli.\n20:5 Comment: And offside.\n20:6 Comment: Alcacer.\n20:8 Comment: You can see Alcacer's bright.\n20:10 Comment: Not the quickest.\n20:11 Comment: Makes intelligent runs.\n20:14 Comment: That's exceptionally close.\n20:17 Comment: Just been half a yard in the end.\n20:20 Comment: He's a clever footballer.\n20:22 Comment: Valencia just aren't coping with Zouba's physicality.\n20:28 Comment: Vezo's getting sucked in to trying to fight him and getting drawn under the ball.\n20:32 Comment: At times if you're smaller and you can't win the ball,\n20:35 Comment: you should just drop off and pick the second one up.\n20:39 Comment: Off Zouba's head.\n20:41 Comment: Hulk.\n20:43 Comment: Feguli's there as a defender.\n20:44 Comment: He falls over.\n20:47 Comment: Krishita.\n20:50 Comment: Antonova.\n20:54 Comment: Rafa Mia just in front of the defence.\n20:58 Comment: Teenager in his first Valencia appearance.\n21:2 Comment: Smolnikov.\n21:3 Comment: I've noticed that Zenit in recent times have made a point of signing more Russian players.\n21:9 Comment: It's not a necessity because of the 6 plus 5 rule.\n21:13 Comment: Assisted upon by the Russian sports ministry.\n21:16 Comment: Six Russians only pictured any time.\n21:21 Comment: The Russian Premier League to help the national team.\n21:24 Comment: Here's Krishita, the Italian.\n21:27 Comment: And it comes off Ruben Vezo.\n21:30 Comment: Countless problems for Valencia at the back here.\n21:34 Comment: Wonderful interplay through the middle of the park.\n21:36 Comment: Krishita should get his head up there.\n21:38 Comment: Hulk furious with him.\n21:42 Comment: He just slid the ball.\n21:43 Comment: I think Hulk would have been 10-12 yards out.\n21:46 Comment: Poor decision.\n21:51 Comment: The latest Hulk corner.\n21:53 Comment: Delferd that time by Valencia.\n21:56 Comment: Here's Rafa Mia.\n22:0 Comment: Showing for it was Andre Gomez.\n22:5 Comment: Here's Feguli.\n22:8 Comment: Joao Cancelo.\n22:10 Comment: Deciding to run at his man.\n22:12 Comment: In this case, Oleg Shatov.\n22:16 Comment: He's going to have to counter back and then he's going to have to go.\n22:20 Comment: He's going to have to counter back Cancelo.\n22:26 Comment: Bounces off Dani Parejo.\n22:30 Comment: Free kick goes to Zenit.\n22:32 Comment: Valencia just a little bit disjointed at the moment.\n22:36 Comment: Poor decision making.\n22:42 Comment: Man will be a worried man.\n22:44 Comment: You know, Rito Santo.\n22:47 Comment: Under pressure.\n22:52 Comment: Big pressure back home.\n22:54 Comment: Big expectations.\n22:56 Comment: And his team this season just haven't been up to it.\n23:0 Comment: Dani Parejo again.\n23:3 Comment: Cut out by Lombard.\n23:4 Comment: Here's Hulk.\n23:6 Comment: Ziuba.\n23:8 Comment: Dani.\n23:10 Comment: Fluency from Zenit.\n23:12 Comment: And Dani takes on the shot.\n23:13 Comment: They've got problems at the back.\n23:14 Comment: Valencia.\n23:15 Comment: There comes a time when.\n23:17 Comment: OK.\n23:18 Comment: Zenit have counted well.\n23:19 Comment: They've won the ball back.\n23:21 Comment: See.\n23:22 Comment: Body's bursting forward.\n23:25 Comment: One of the defenders, Abdenal has to get up quicker there.\n23:28 Comment: Player of Dani's talent.\n23:30 Comment: Disappointed.\n23:31 Comment: Without effort.\n23:32 Comment: A free shot.\n23:38 Comment: And it's a goal.\n23:40 Comment: Zenit.\n23:44 Comment: You can see it on the electronic scoreboard.\n23:47 Comment: Out of sight of the pitch.\n23:48 Comment: One nil to Zenit.\n23:49 Comment: As they try to make it five out of five in the group.\n23:52 Comment: Already guaranteed to be in the knockout stages.\n23:55 Comment: But they want to win this section.\n23:59 Comment: Handball by Ziuba.\n24:2 Comment: I don't think he meant that.\n24:3 Comment: I think that's slightly harsh.\n24:6 Comment: He just can't get to grips with his physicality.\n24:8 Comment: His hold up play.\n24:10 Comment: Ziuba.\n24:12 Comment: He's a player who's arrived late on the scene.\n24:16 Comment: Best part of nine years at Spartak Moscow.\n24:18 Comment: Out on loan, did pretty well.\n24:22 Comment: This is a 27-year-old Muscovite.\n24:24 Comment: His career doesn't seem to be going anywhere fast.\n24:28 Comment: Really prospering here in St. Petersburg.\n24:34 Comment: Doing a pretty good job for the Russian national team as well.\n24:36 Comment: Their top scorer in European Championship qualifying with eight.\n24:40 Comment: Through the legs of Ziuba that time.\n24:44 Comment: Passed by Dani Parejo.\n24:51 Comment: AndrÃ© GÃ³mez.\n24:53 Comment: There's nothing sustained from Valencia.\n24:55 Comment: Here's Rafa Mia.\n24:59 Comment: Lombard's getting there ahead of Alcacer.\n25:3 Comment: AndrÃ© GÃ³mez.\n25:4 Comment: A flighted ball.\n25:6 Comment: Feguli.\n25:7 Comment: Got caught in two mines.\n25:9 Comment: Sofiane Feguli.\n25:15 Comment: Let us remind you that it's the UEFA Champions League tonight on the air.\n25:19 Comment: 6.30.\n25:21 Comment: BT Sport Europe.\n25:22 Comment: That'll get you ready for all the matches.\n25:26 Comment: That could be Tel Aviv against Chelsea.\n25:28 Comment: Is on BT Sport 2.\n25:30 Comment: Coverage

though.\n21:9 Comment: Referee's arm raised.\n21:10 Comment: And it won't count.\n21:12 Comment: And looked extraordinarily close.\n21:18 Comment: He's trying to get himself back in an onside position.\n21:21 Comment: But the assistant gets that one right.\n21:23 Comment: He's unlucky, Mina.\n21:25 Comment: Because he initially makes the run.\n21:26 Comment: He's offered that threat in behind.\n21:28 Comment: And when the ball didn't come, he tried to readjust.\n21:31 Comment: It's been better from Valencia.\n21:33 Comment: Looked more of a threat.\n21:40 Comment: As you mentioned, Phil Neville.\n21:41 Comment: Part of Nuno's coaching staff.\n21:46 Comment: It's not so long ago we were talking about Valencia being\n21:48 Comment: heavily in debt to the tune of what?\n21:50

me.\n29:29 Comment: That was absolutely brilliant.\n29:31 Comment: The interplay, the one-twos.\n29:33 Comment: And then the awareness at the end.\n29:36 Comment: Squaring it to Zyuba.\n29:39 Comment:

Comment: That little assist.\n29:51 Comment: And Zenit are absolutely flying now.\n29:54 Comment: Just wonderful awareness.\n29:55 Comment: At the end there to square it.\n30:1 Comment: Zyuba has five goals in as many group stage games.\n30:6 Comment: Joint top scorer with Cristiano Ronaldo.\n30:9 Comment: And there is the hypothetical table.\n30:12 Comment: Zenit on course to have 15 points when all is said and done.\n30:19 Comment: Valencia.\n30:21 Comment: Thought they might just have a sniff of something prior to the game.\n30:23 Comment: Santi Mina making an impact off the bench.\n30:26

not be in second place.\n31:11 Comment: At the end of business tonight.\n31:15 Comment: I think looking from Valencia's point of view.\n31:18 Comment: The last defeat against Ghent really set them back.\n31:21 Comment: On their heels.\n31:24 Comment: And now they needed to get something out of this game tonight.\n31:28 Comment: And they're going to have to rely on the other game.\n31:31 Comment: Leon against Ghent.\n31:33 Comment: Alexander Ryazantsev as they substitute.\n31:36 Comment: Talking tactics there with Andrei Vilas Boas.\n31:39 Comment: Towards Zyuba again.\n31:42 Comment: You can't really argue with five goals in five Champions League matches, can you?\n31:46 Comment: No, but he's just not about goal scoring.\n31:52 Comment: That was a bit ungainly.\n31:55 Comment: Danilo.\n31:57 Comment: Fell to the back of the net.\n31:59 Comment: And he's got a chance.\n32:6 Comment: Danilo.\n32:8 Comment: Fell by Witzel.\n32:10 Comment: And that's going to mean a suspension for Axel Witzel.\n32:14 Comment: I don't suppose he's all that bothered.\n32:17 Comment: Suspension come matchday six.\n32:22 Comment: The way things are going.\n32:24 Comment: It will be only of academic interest to Zenit.\n32:27 Comment: Yeah, absolutely.\n32:30 Comment: I wouldn't say he meant to get the yellow card.\n32:34 Comment: But if he could miss a game, better to miss one.\n32:37

Dani Parejo.\n32:55 Comment: The goalkeeper covering up.\n32:57 Comment: Lodzigin.\n33:1 Comment: Just again a little bit surprised at the set-up.\n33:3 Comment: Letting Figuli block the goalkeeper's

    "summary": "Zenit St. Petersburg secured a decisive 2-0 victory over Valencia in a UEFA Champions League match that underscored their dominance in the group stage. Valencia's vulnerabilities were on full display throughout the match, as Zenit took advantage of defensive frailties and showcased their effective, counter-attacking football.\n\nThe game kicked off to a backdrop where Zenit were one of the three teams, along with Real Madrid and Manchester City, assured a place in the last 16. Notably, Zenit entered the match boasting a 100% record in the group stage, a testament to their formidable form.\n\nAs the first half unfolded, Zenit's strategy quickly became clear. They set up with Neto, naturally a defender, positioned just in front of the back four, suggesting a cautious yet tactical approach to absorb pressure and strike on the counter. Valencia, on the other hand, were dealing with inconsistencies both in domestic and European competitions. Their victory in the previous away game against Celta Vigo was a highlight, but it was juxtaposed against successive defeats that highlighted their defensive vulnerabilities.\n\nThe initial phases saw both teams attempting to establish control, with Valencia's Paco Alcacer creating the first notable opportunity. Cleverly playing with his back to goal, Alcacer received a ball from Andre Gomez, but his left-footed shot lacked the power to trouble the Zenit goalkeeper.\n\nZenit, known for their disciplined defense and lethal counter-attacks, gradually started dictating the pace of the game. Their attacking trio of Dani, Hulk, and Zyuba began to find pockets of space. Hulk, in particular, was a constant menace, using his strength and dribbling skills to unsettle the Valencia defense. His duel with Ruben Vezo was a recurring theme, with the latter struggling to cope with Hulk's physicality and flair.\n\nValencia's decision to start the 18-year-old Rafa Mir raised eyebrows, given the magnitude of the match. In his debut appearance, Mir struggled to make a significant impact, often overwhelmed by Zenit's experienced defense. Nonetheless, Valencia did show moments of promise, with Feghali attempting to link up efficiently in midfield and create chances upfront.\n\nHowever, Zenit's tactical discipline paid dividends in the 15th minute when Oleg Shatov scored the opening goal, capitalizing on a defensive lapse from Valencia. Hulk played a crucial role in the build-up, displaying his vision and awareness by threading a pass through to Shatov, who composedly finished past the Valencia goalkeeper Yaume. This goal epitomized Zenit's clinical approach and Valencia's defensive frailties.\n\nAs the first half progressed, Zenit continued to press their advantage. They utilized the width of the pitch, with full-backs occasionally joining the attack, as seen when Domenico Criscito ventured forward, delivering crosses that created additional problems for Valencia's beleaguered defense. In another instance, Zenit almost doubled their lead when Dani managed to carve an opening, feeding the ball to Hulk, whose shot narrowly missed the target.\n\nDespite the goal, Valencia tried to regroup and find an equalizer before the break. Alcacer remained a potent threat with his intelligent movement, but the support from midfield was sporadic. Feghali provided some creative spark but often found himself isolated. As halftime approached, Valencia attempted to push forward but lacked the final pass or decisive touch to break down Zenit's resilient defense.\n\nThe second half saw Valencia come out with greater urgency, pressing Zenit higher up the pitch. This initial aggression, however, was met with a robust defensive display from Zenit, who absorbed the pressure and looked to counter at every opportunity. Valencia's woes were compounded by the relentless running and physical presence of Zyuba, who continually battled the defenders and provided a focal point for Zenit's attacks.\n\nZenit nearly extended their lead through a well-orchestrated move involving Dani, Witzel, and Criscito, but the final effort was thwarted. Nevertheless, Zenitâ€™s ability to transition swiftly from defense to attack kept the Valencia backline on its toes. Dani, the orchestrator of many of Zenit's attacks, was pivotal in maintaining the pace and distribution.\n\nValencia's struggles up front were evident, with the young Rafa Mir unable to shake off the Zenit defenders. Eventually, he was substituted for Santi Mina, who immediately made an impact. Mina's ability to hold the ball and make incisive runs added a new dimension to Valencia's attack, offering a glimmer of hope.\n\nHowever, Zenit's defense, marshaled by Garay and Lombards, remained steadfast. They dealt effectively with the crosses and through balls aimed at Alcacer and Feghali. Lorenzo's commanding presence was particularly pronounced during set-pieces, where he cleared threats with authority.\n\nThe pivotal moment came in the 74th minute when Hulk received the ball on the right, outpaced his marker, and delivered a crisp pass to Shatov, who set up a one-two with Dani. This combination left the Valencia defenders flat-footed, and Dani unselfishly squared the ball to Zyuba, who slotted it home to make it 2-0. It was a textbook counter-attack and a testament to Zenit's strategy of exploiting defensive lapses with swift, precise passing.\n\nValencia's task became insurmountable when Ruben Vezo was sent off for a last-man foul on Shatov. Down to ten men, Valencia's chances of staging a comeback dwindled. Zenit, sensing the opportunity to strengthen their grip, continued to press forward.\n\nHulk, enjoying the space afforded by the extra man, showcased his dribbling skills and came close to adding a third goal, but his shot was marginally wide. Despite the numerical disadvantage, Valencia continued to push forward, with Santi Mina creating a late chance, but Zenit's defense held firm.\n\nAs the final whistle blew, it was evident that Zenit had outplayed and outmaneuvered Valencia. Their disciplined approach, combined with clinical finishing and defensive resilience, affirmed their status as group leaders. The 2-0 scoreline reflected Zenit's superiority and Valencia's ongoing struggles, both in the Champions League and domestically.\n\nThis victory was not just about securing points but also a statement of intent from Zenit. Under Andre Villas-Boas, they have developed into a well-oiled machine capable of competing at the highest level. For Valencia, the road ahead looks challenging, with defensive issues to address and a need to find consistency to progress further in European competitions. \n\nZenitâ€™s triumph also highlighted the contributions of their key players. Dani's vision and ability to create chances, Hulk's physical presence and attacking prowess, and Zyuba's role as a focal point were instrumental in securing this win. With this victory, Zenit maintained their perfect record in the group stage, emphasizing their ambition to make a significant impact in the knockout rounds. \n\nIn summary, Zenit St. Petersburg's 2-0 win over Valencia was a comprehensive display of tactical acumen, defensive solidity, and clinical finishing. It underscored their credentials as serious contenders, while Valenciaâ€™s vulnerabilities and inconsistency were laid bare, signaling a need for introspection and improvement as they navigate the challenges ahead."
