Good pressure from Shakhtar. Ball for the Ukrainians.\n1:26 Comment: It is a competition of precision, that is why the best play, the players with the most quality, those who do not lose it.\n1:31 Comment: We are used to a Madrid of counterattack, but also to a Madrid of Tokyo Madrid that supports Antoni Kroos in Luka Modric.\n1:37 Comment: Between the two, the Paches always have more than 90% success rates. It is a guarantee for Madrid to be able to build a good attacking game.\n1:44 Comment: Piatos, I took that ball, the two centre-backs play it. Now, the ball goes to Rakitsky.\n1:49 Comment: Rakitsky plays to the right again for Oleksandr Kucher.\n1:53 Comment: The Ukrainian defense wants to come out at the moment in Madrid. It waits between short pitches. This is also news.\n1:58 Comment: This is what Rafa Meritez's Madrid also wants to do. Play to the right, ball to the side.\n2:2 Comment: Dario Serna, the Croatian veteran, is coming. Play the ball up front.\n2:5 Comment: He fell at the crossroads there with Sergio Ramos. Glaski is a wide ball for Real Madrid. Marcelo is going to take it.\n2:10 Comment: Marcelo puts it long. The play comes from there for Galei Beil. There's Galei.

Rafa Benítez asked him for all that.\n3:0 Comment: And if he also has a goal, then better for him and for the team.\n3:2 Comment: Last season James was in double figures in goals and assists.\n3:6 Comment: More than 10 in both fields. Isco was far behind.\n3:10 Comment: Important in magic, Isco creation in the last pass.\n3:13 Comment: But I think that with each goal he has to improve a little because he has the quality to do so.\n3:17 Comment: Look how Madrid has stolen, but Teixeira has also stolen.\n3:19 Comment: Now the Brazilian for Shakhtar. He plays to the right for Dario Serna who has a glove.\n3:22 Comment: He also puts the coroata up. Deep ball. He comes there with Marán.\n3:25 Comment: Marán crosses the line.

This is one of the things that Madrid cannot afford.\n3:37 Comment: Those defensive errors, especially at the beginning of the game where Real Madrid wants to have the ball,\n3:43 Comment: Get to the goal and not the opposite. Let Shakhtar be the one who arrives and who begins to see that things can be done at the Bernabéu.\n3:51 Comment: The 0-0 moment in the first 4 minutes of the game with the Santiago Bernabéu.\n3:55 Comment: Also the same result in Seville and in Istanbul with that Galatasaray Atlético de Madrid and Seville with a Semonche Clatbach.\n4:1 Comment: The best summaries then you know on Mega. These Champions total and there will be the most extensive summaries at 10:30 on Mega.\n4:10 Comment: There he plays the ball. Ball for Isco. He receives between the lines. He wants to shoot at the Mago. Isco holds on at the Alcón.\n4:15 Comment: He plays the ball again. Short for Cristiano inside. The ball comes up there for Bale.\n4:19 Comment: Bale for Toni. For Benzema. Again for Galet. Shakhtar cuts well. Fred comes out. Ball up.\n4:23 Comment: He's coming for Deiseir. Down on the counter. There he is in the central circle. He went down.\n4:27 Comment: That's Marriot. The ball to Kroos. But Rafa Guerrero says it's a foul and be careful.\n4:32 Comment: Well yes, I think the referee made a mistake because Kroos clearly took the ball.\n4:36 Comment: He wants it not to go away from the first moment but in fact for me there is no mistake.\n4:44 Comment: Marriot, Kroos down there. The referee Proata removed the foul.\n4:49 Comment: Screams from Madrid, Madrid in the Bernabéu stadium. Play the ball to the left. Acevedo is coming that way.\n4:53 Comment: The Brazilian goes for two but well. Carvajal covers him. He delays the ball. He plays for Varane.\n4:57 Comment: Good combination from the Frenchman. Again for Madrid's right back.\n4:59 Comment: He's inside the penalty spot. Sergio Ramos receives calmly. Drags. Plays the ball to the left for Marcelo.\n5:5 Comment: Madrid comes out playing the ball from behind for Toni Kroos.\n5:7 Comment: Both teams obsessed with having possession. So far we still haven't seen a long pass or a shot.\n5:13 Comment: There are no clearances. I think both teams are going to look for the strength of having the ball and making long attacks without losing value.\n5:21 Comment: It's going to be a power-to-power duel in that sense. About possession of the ball.\n5:25 Comment: What happens is that Uti obviously Madrid has to come out and rule in their stadium. He is now coming to the left.\n5:29 Comment: He plays between the line. He has the ball there for Cristiano. He's going to try. It crossed him. Back to Isaac.\n5:34 Comment: What does it mean for Madrid.\n5:35 Comment: Yes, Madrid has to rule wherever it is.\n5:38 Comment: What is clear is that I think they are very comfortable when Madrid has the ball and does not do it quickly.\n5:46 Comment: And then be careful with the counters. They have already come out a couple of times. This lack of Kroos that has prevented it. But they are coming out very well on the counter.\n5:53 Comment: Real Madrid puts it. Ball at the far post. Cristiano comes. Rafael's header.\n5:58 Comment: The ball is lost. Paris Saint Germain has just taken the lead in the Parc des Princes.\n6:2 Comment: Goal from Di María. Paris Saint Germain 1-0. The Real Madrid group.\n6:8 Comment: He wants to play the ball from there now. Manda Piatov.\n6:12 Comment: Shakhtar is also a scoring team. Because they have 17 goals in 7 games this season. They have only scored 5.\n6:19 Comment: Well, because it is a team that plays with quality, that has overflow. You have to look at Marlos. 8 dribbles on average per game.\n6:25 Comment: A player who dares to play Steyr. He is a goal scorer. He is the killer of this team. Therefore, Shakhtar is doing very well in attack.\n6:32 Comment: Be careful, Marlos is coming there. Marlos with a dud. He plays the ball to the right. Serna wants to score the ball.\n6:36 Comment: He's on the back line. Serna puts the ball in. He heads to Sergio Ramos's near post. He ruins Shakhtar's chance.\n6:42 Comment: Toni Kroos plays. He comes to put pressure on him. Fred very high. He discharges the ball to the left. He gains space.\n6:46 Comment: He sends it diagonally. What a change of front for Isco Alarcón. In the end the ball doesn't reach. It reaches Cristiano.\n6:51 Comment: He crossed Cebedo in the middle. Cebedo fights. He doesn't reach Cristiano. He hinders him just enough. Throw-in for Madrid.\n6:57 Comment: Well, at certain times when they lose the ball so high up, what they want is to put pressure on them so they don't go on the counterattack.\n7:2 Comment: I think they are very afraid of Real Madrid's counterattack and Real Madrid's quick exits.\n7:7 Comment: Illa, Illa, Illa. Juanito Maravilla at the Bernabéu.\n7:12 Comment: Minute 7. Play the ball there for Real Madrid's 7 now. Cristiano comes. He takes the ball to me. He breaks the far post.\n7:17 Comment: Marcelo up.\n7:20 Comment: This play exemplifies a bit of what Madrid's offensive distribution is like. We are seeing Marcelo when Kroos, Modric has the ball.\n7:27 Comment: Even the center backs, how he is on the wing, how Cristiano has freedom to move between the lines.\n7:32 Comment: And how Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema play that 2 for 2 with the centre-backs.\n7:39 Comment: To play the ball inside. The ball back again. Kuczer is coming to play.\n7:44 Comment: He plays for Serna. Serna for Kuczer. Karim Benzema comes to put pressure on him. Ball goes up. Ramos jumps. He now anticipates his pair Teixeira well.\n7:51 Comment: He plays the ball inside. Modric comes to put pressure on him. There is a foul on the Croatian. No, the referee, also of the same nationality, says no, it is the ball for Real Madrid.\n7:59 Comment: Toni Kroos plays the ball now.\n8:1 Comment: I also remind you that after this match you cannot miss the special anthill in which we will celebrate the tenth birthday of Trancas y Barrancas today with a cracker too.\n8:11 Comment: With Carlos Arguiñano, the anthill. Just after finishing this great game in the Champions League.\n8:16 Comment: Pablo Motos and his entire team. Play the ball up high. Ball there for Bale. Bale, but difficult for the Welshman to arrive. Ball for Shakhtar.\n8:22 Comment: Benítez and Luchescu don't sit on the bench at all and Rafa always has his notebook writing down everything.\n8:30 Comment: The two Rafas. No, Rafa Benítez and Rafa Guerrero. That's where the ball plays. It comes from the inside. There's Fred. Fred unloads to the right.\n8:36 Comment: Ball for Shakhtar. Teixeira is coming. They are in no hurry. He continues to touch the ball even in Real Madrid's field. Without complex. Luchescu's team plays.\n8:45 Comment: There playing behind. Ball to Teixeira. He makes the change to the left. The ball arrives for Rakiski. Rakiski pressured by Isco Alarcón. He holds the ball. He puts a deep pass behind Carvajal. Cebedo wins it. Cebedo . Out.\n8:58 Comment: Well, Rakiski's ball. A left-footed center back who has a very good long start. He has that breaking pass. A young promise of Ukrainian football who stayed a little bit.\n9:6 Comment: Now he is 25, 26 years old and he is already an established footballer in the team but without that excellent performance that everyone assumed.\n9:14 Comment: Carvajal stumbled on this play and was complaining about his boots.\n9:19 Comment: It is true what Manu, Matías and also Guti commented. With you already on the field Susana. It rained in the hours before the game. And that also makes the CFE feel faster.\n9:29 Comment: Isco plays the ball. Isco inside. For Benzema. Kevin Lole. It was bad. Ball. Bale didn't control it well. The ball was delayed behind. He wants to play the clearance again.\n9:37 Comment: Piató. The ball goes up. Saktar kills it. There's Barlos.\n9:41 Comment: I also remember Marcos. I remember that you also spoke to me back in the day when we were commenting on Samba Dones. That Saktar Dones in Douglas Costa's UEFA. And now at Bayern Munich.\n9:54 Comment: Yes, we had the opportunity to comment on Saktar in that final or in that UEFA title that they won in the sixth. And well, it was already a team with Mircea Luchescu at the helm where he was aiming for many Brazilians.\n10:9 Comment: And where they made the difference. Very talented players. Young people who are always looking for a transfer. A better future after succeeding at Saktar.\n10:19 Comment: Play the ball. Once again Saktar inside. Be careful here. The ball was divided. Isco was running but it came out well. Rakinski corrected from behind. He comes out on the wing. Ball for Madrid.\n10:29 Comment: Ball for Marcelo. Marcelo with Varane. Varane comes out of the cave. He fixes him centrally and comes to put pressure on him there. Now Saktar loses the ball to Guti. Madrid tries but right now they have a bone on top that also likes to play the ball and without complexes.\n10:51 Comment: Yes, Madrid is having a hard time and above all they are not being precise with the passes. I think that a lot of people accumulate on the inside, few people on the outside which makes football much more complicated. I think that Real Madrid He has to look for the wings a little more and above all take advantage of the rise of Marcelo, who I believe is a very important player on an offensive level for the team.\n11:9 Comment: Well, look, I was telling you just now, bless Sergio Ramos, who would surely convey that idea to Marcelo.\n11:15 Comment: He wants to play the ball. The ball goes back again. How well Modric crossed there. The ball that goes out on the wing will be for Saktar by the way. Mariano Sancho will also be our partner in the box where, by the way, King Don Juan is Carlos.\n11:31 Comment: And Kinski wants to play the ball. Kinski makes the change for Serna. The ball goes to Corata. He kills it with his chest, leaves it dead. What quality with the experience he has. He puts the ball up deep for Teixeira. Offside.\n11:44 Comment: First 12 minutes of the first half. This is 0-0 in Real Madrid's debut in the Champions League.\n11:50 Comment: Madrid has to be careful with the entrances of Aleste and Seira. Glazki, the striker, a reference 88. He is slow, perhaps he will not be able to overcome that line and attack the back of Madrid's defense.\n12:2 Comment: But nevertheless, the entry of Aleste and Seira can hurt Madrid. There, both Sergio Ramos and Varane have to be careful to protect their backs and also to be careful of Keylor Navas to be in front to provide cover for any imprecise pass.\n12:14 Comment: Toni Kroos's pass fell, talking about failing. And he recently received the award as best passer also in 2014 by the Federation of Football History and Statistics.\n12:25 Comment: With that percentage of success from the German who now touches the ball short. Plays for Modric, lets pass. Ball for Isco. Real Madrid comes in three quarters of the field. Plays to the right, comes Dani Carvajal. He gets up, the puts it. Penalty point, my goodness. Just like Gareth Bale was trying.\n12:39 Comment: Yes, well, a little bit what we were saying, that we had to take advantage of the wings. I think that both the rise of Carvajal and that of Marcelo is going to do a lot of damage to Sardar. And well, here we have seen the first chance of the Real Madrid and always coming for the band.\n12:53 Comment:  Ball that Galazqui plays again from above. Ball for Fred. There is the eight. Plays inside for Teixeira. Teixeira in Sancho for Cebedo. Between Brazilians facing the game. Back. Stepanenko now joins in there. Stepanenko inside for Fred He also comes to receive now between the lines. The ball is offloaded but the ball is going to reach Rakitsky. It touches Sartar. Back for Piatov.\n13:15 Comment: Sartar very comfortable. I think that Real Madrid has to take a step forward, they have to press more and try to steal the ball as soon as possible.\n13:22 Comment: There now Cristiano Ronaldo gets it. He plays the ball for Bale. Now on the left that mobility of the top four. With Isco, with Benzema, with Gareth Bale, with Cristiano who starts. He releases the ball for Benzema. Benzema comes. Sit goalkeeper Benzema. Up. Mother of my life.\n13:39 Comment: The roles have been changed. In this case it is Cristiano who gives the pass and Benzema the one who finishes. I don't know, afterwards he did everything very well except the shot. It is strange for Benzema that he goes to that occasion.\n13:53 Comment: Cristiano is very good between the lines looking for the back of the drivers and that great pass. I think that Benzema takes the ball too far out, he changes his pace and there he stays a little behind. He wants to orient his body first and He's already losing his goal.\n14:9 Comment: Very clear opportunity. At the moment Madrid is finding it easy to break Shakhtar inside in the few actions they have had. But above all they find inside when they open the field well, when they do it big and from there Shakhtar's defense Leave spaces inside.\n14:26 Comment: What you played and did so well inside, Guti, is precisely that, isn't it? Throwing the bait at your rival and then beating him back with that dry and tense pass.\n14:34 Comment: It's a bit of variety, especially if you have it. If you don't have it, it's very difficult to vary your attack, but if you have it, like in this case Madrid has it on the wings and also in the center, well, it's a little change and tell them now I'm going to come from the outside and when they are thinking that the team is going to continue going from the outside, go inside. I think that Real Madrid has to do it much more often than it does.\n14:55 Comment: What would you like to do right now to get down here for a while? I'd give it my all. I wish I could be there again.\n15:2 Comment: Well, I'll tell you one thing, from up here, you already saw football down there as you see it from up here, that's what's difficult.\n15:8 Comment: It seemed that way, but no, not really.\n15:12 Comment: Play the ball, I remember a great goal between you and Benzema, in Riazor.\n15:17 Comment:  We were there.\n15:19 Comment: Only Guti can think of that type of backheel, only in front of the goalkeeper. He plays the ball, comes from the left, puts the ball in, goes to the far post and Cristiano is there to impale, which Cristiano's loved one sees, with his left foot out.\n15:30 Comment: The good thing about managing both.\n15:32 Comment: Incredible control, incredible control. The shame is that the shot was not good, but the control is wonderful.\n15:39 Comment: Cristiano is truly in the finishing area, on top of that I think he has control already oriented to hit.\n15:47 Comment: If probably any other player would give three touches, he makes a reduction to two and is immediately ready to hit.\n15:55 Comment: But control at the level that very few people can do, not everyone can do.\n15:59 Comment: He plays the ball, it comes from behind and Rafael Varane is rectifying what the Frenchman does best.\n16:4 Comment: He delays the ball for Keylor, be careful Keylor, his control is gone. On the verge of dying, that ball almost took him off the stick.\n16:10 Comment: The murmur at the Bernabéu.\n16:12 Comment: People with their hands on their heads.\n16:14 Comment: For Sergio Ramos. Ramos short for Toni Kroos, he presses Fred high, the ball that hits him high comes to Garipeil's back.\n16:20 Comment: Galet holds on, he plays for Luka Modri, he wants to give him football, he holds on to Modri, he releases the ball to the right for Dani Carvajal.\n16:25 Comment: Isco is in front of him, he waits for the man from Malaga but he is going to play now on the side, he plays it up to the youth player, he throws himself there, near the top of the area, he recovers Cebedo for Shakhtar, ball inside.\n16:33 Comment: He wants to get out of there now, he wants to play the ball.\n16:37 Comment: The ball goes to the left for Marcelo, there is the shot that the Brazilian likes, Marcelo does not come, Marcelo puts the ball in, far post, it is not going to arrive.\n16:44 Comment: Gareth Bale runs to prevent it from coming out, the thoroughbred Galet gets it, he delays the ball there for Dani Carvajal, next to the peak he touches it short, the ball is coming,\n16:52 Comment: The goal from the ball to Isco, my goodness. There's Isco, in the chest, he hits the ball, it comes for Kroos, good shot, out.\n16:57 Comment: Madrid got a little further forward, pressed higher, recovered the ball earlier and well, I think that's what Real Madrid has to do.\n17:6 Comment: When a team loses and recovers quickly, that gives a lot of confidence. In the end you avoid the effort of having all the players defend 30-40 meters back again\n17:16 Comment: And you attack again, from there you link offensive actions and the talent ends up coming out.\n17:22 Comment: The ball goes over the side and I take this opportunity to remember that we have exclusive news.\n17:27 Comment: Next Tuesday at 10:30 pm Antena 3 premieres Mar de Plastico and I know that there are many of us, many of us waiting for this new bet on three-way series, quality series,\n17:36 Comment: A gripping police thriller that begins with the murder of a young woman in the bullrings of Almería.\n17:41 Comment: Don't forget the premiere of Mar de Plastico next Tuesday at 10:30 pm here on Antena 3.\n17:48 Comment: Luka Modric plays the ball, be careful there, Guas Gareth Bale has been hurt.\n17:52 Comment: Yes, but he hasn't whistled anything.\n17:54 Comment: Ball to the left, ball to Marcelo.\n17:56 Comment: Marcelo with Toni Kroos, they are now 11 against 11. Toni Kroos plays, ball to the right for Dani Carvajal.\n18:2 Comment: Tyson wins the match, Carvajal holds on, he releases the ball for Toni Kroos, the German champion is coming.\n18:6 Comment: Ball to the right for Isco, Isco controls, touches the ball up, soft for Gareth Bale who receives, wants to face, closes that side well now to Cebedo, the ball goes up.\n18:16 Comment: Isco found himself against the wall and recovered the ball from Shakhtar.\n18:21 Comment: Ball for Fred, Fred up, to the right and Atlético de Madrid just scored by the way.\n18:27 Comment: Griezmann, the little prince, the Frenchman has just scored Galatasaray 0-Atlético de Madrid 1.\n18:34 Comment: You know, the best summary in megabytes at 10:30.\n18:37 Comment: Play the ball inside, the ball is coming for Gareth Bale.\n18:40 Comment: Gareth Bale, plays short, ball for Modric, there the Croatian appears, he lets the other Croatian pass in the referee, ball up that he puts into space now for Benzema.\n18:49 Comment: Krakinski crossed paths and the ball died at Serna's feet.\n18:53 Comment: Touch back, again for Kucher, Kucher for Serna.\n18:56 Comment: In these 18 minutes, Gareth Bale's ease called tension, very comfortable playing, playing first, combining, even doing it in a small space, good Gareth Bale.\n19:6 Comment: And he has said that this year he feels like another player, that now he is finally comfortable.\n19:11 Comment: Received with his back turned, well Cristiano for Benzema, he plays for Marcelo Ninefondo, a mess was made, carom, he took a goal kick.\n19:17 Comment: We are seeing another novelty, that Real Madrid is practically playing with two forwards, both Benzema and Cristiano occupy that position and to me it looks more like a 4-4-2 than the system that Real Madrid was playing last year with Ancelotti.\n19:33 Comment: Well done Guti, because also when you come to receive with your back turned, you are throwing depth at the wall.\n19:38 Comment: Yes, I think so, if you play with two forwards that's what you have to do, one gets closer and the other moves away.\n19:43 Comment: I think that's what both Cristiano and Benzema are doing.\n19:47 Comment: Piatov takes the ball, the ball goes up, Ramos comes to jump, he always hits the mark there on Marlos, but the ball that goes towards the wing, Marcelo comes, Ramos touches again, the ball inside, Toni Kroos recovers \n19:57 Comment: This too, Marcos solidarity is fundamental in a team that wants to be a champion of something.\n20:2 Comment: Without a doubt, in the end there is a part that is very important, everyone going together, defending, attacking, playing as a team, it is a matter of mentality.\n20:10 Comment: What a ball for Cristiano, he crossed perfectly back there again, Guterr, the ball that goes to the left, Tyson comes to that race, Tyson against Varane, Varane holds, ball inside, Teixeira appears on the diagonal, he also takes to Ramos, offloads the ball, Rafael Varane recovers for Madrid.\n20:23 Comment: Varane's good recovery, but we saw last season that Real Madrid was a very long team, that the distance between the lines was excessive when the team did not have the ball and that in defensive returns the back line was often exposed. \n20:37 Comment: I believe that Benitez is working for a compact team that recovers, that always stays within 30-35 meters every time it does not have the ball and from there mobility and attack.\n20:45 Comment: Like now Carvajal, Carvajal comes, the pass in front of Acevedo, the Brazilian cuts him off, Acevedo is going to take it, he hides it, he is going to take it, they play it too, Carvajal is missing.\n20:55 Comment: They play it and they play it well, they come out quite well, when they overcome the pressure from Real Madrid you can see that they are a team with a lot of quality and a lot of danger.\n21:3 Comment: It is true that defensively, both Varane and Sergi are very good and they are not practically reaching Keylor's goal, but hey, it is a team that likes to play and that is a little making Real Madrid see that it is not going to be an easy game for them.\n21:19 Comment: Yes, it can also get him into that rhythm that interests him, so that few things happen, and he can also control the game through the ball and not just the score.\n21:27 Comment: At the moment 22 of the first half are live, these Champions total on Antena 3, Real Madrid 0, Shakhtar Tones 0.\n21:34 Comment: He plays the ball to the right, ball to Serna, Zaid goes up the right side, the Croatian offloads, ball to Teixeira, Teixeira comes to combine again inside for Tyson, the ball offloads to Fred.\n21:44 Comment: Look how they always look for Tyson, Teixeira, Fred, it's always the triangle, Marlos too.\n21:50 Comment: How little Galadzi participates, always the striker, focusing on center backs, but with very little participation among Brazilians the game goes.\n21:58 Comment: Ball to the right, touch again for Dario Serna, short for Fred, there is the delayed 8, from there you begin to see the three-quarter line of the court.\n22:4 Comment: He makes the change of front looking for Carvajal's back, the ball goes again to Cebedo, he kills it with his chest, they are going to face it, Carvajal is going hard against Cebedo tonight.\n22:11 Comment: Ball inside, there appears Tyson, Tyson with the ball, he unloads the ball there for Marlos, he wants to face, he has Fred behind him, he goes to unload, he does it again for Tyson.\n22:19 Comment: Tyson plays to the left for Stepanenko, Stepanenko for Cebedo, Cebedo inside, he comes to combine again for Tyson, Tyson for Cebedo, the godfather smells it, tries to play the ball, Shakhtar does it behind, delays for Rakinski. \n22:31 Comment: And this again, Pintos at the Bernabéu, wants me to look for the ball, but at the moment Shakhtar also knows how to play it.\n22:37 Comment: Increasingly angry, angry, Rafa Benítez.\n22:41 Comment: Ball that plays at the front of the area, Piatov comes, the balcony, from there the Ukrainian goal now comes out, he puts it up, long, looking for Ramos's back, he goes to jump, he puts his head into Ramos, Ramos fell, he recovers Marcelo.\n22:53 Comment: Marcelo against Marlos, he plays it up front, Cristiano wants to catch the divided ball, but Fred is going to take it, Shakhtar recovers.\n23:0 Comment: It is not easy to take the ball away from Shakhtar, it is easier to press them up high and perhaps take the ball away from the centre-backs, from the defenders at the start of the game, than from the players up front, because they all have a very high percentage of success in the Come on, they make good decisions.\n23:17 Comment: And look, Esteba, Guti, they are playing short and with very close passes, where there are almost no losses, because they always go with one or two touches.\n23:26 Comment: The Bernabéu doesn't stop cheering up, a great start for the debut in the Champions League, looking for the eleventh and the road starts today here at the Santiago Bernabéu, on the first day of this group A.\n23:35 Comment: Ranginski plays the ball, what a change of front, Marcelo cuts, the ball comes loose, directly to the wing.\n23:41 Comment: Well, Madrid has lost a little control of the game, now Shakhtar has it, and I think that is a little what is costing Benitez's Real Madrid.\n23:49 Comment: I know he's working hard and trying, but he's having a hard time getting the ball back.\n23:53 Comment: I think it's more individual than collective pressure, it's pressure from a single player and it makes it very difficult to steal from teams that have players of as much quality as Shakhtar.\n24:3 Comment: You who have been a very technical footballer, it is true that you also suffered a physical metamorphosis, you gained a lot of muscle since you started as a youth player in Madrid,\n24:12 Comment: But it is also difficult to change the morphology of a footballer, from being a player to being a great recovery player for a team.\n24:18 Comment: Yes, but they have to get used to that, today's football is like that, not only with quality can you play and in big teams like Real Madrid less so.\n24:25 Comment: I think that is what Modri ​​has understood, what Isco has understood, what James has understood, and that is why they have their minutes at Real Madrid.\n24:32 Comment: I think it is just as important to touch the ball and do it well as to press and steal the ball.\n24:38 Comment: Which coach pushed you the most in that?\n24:40 Comment: Fabio Capello was constantly telling me every day that I had to steal, that I had to press, that I had to hold my line, that I had to swing.\n24:49 Comment: The truth, every day.\n24:50 Comment: Obsessive about that. Well, by the way, Atlético de Madrid just scored the second, Griezmann also, the Frenchman Galatasaray zero, Atlético de Madrid two.\n25:0 Comment: You know, the mega summary at ten thirty at night on mega. Very extensive summary with all the plays.\n25:8 Comment: What a good player Antoine Griezmann is, how he is growing as a footballer. This could be his season and I'm sure that if he starts to follow the Champions League like this it can be tremendous.\n25:16 Comment: Take care of Fre, take care of Fre, play the ball to the right, Antoine Griezmann the little prince, keep an eye on the ball inside, let Teixeira pass, it was not understood there.\n25:23 Comment: Cristiano comes, Cristiano's passer wants to take it, he is waiting for the ball at the top, Isco played the ball, he was trying to look for Benzema and the ball is again a throw-in for Madrid.\n25:34 Comment: Hey Guti, is this rotation thing very, very important or is it a bit of a hassle?\n25:38 Comment: No, no, for me yes, for me it is very important. I think the most important thing for a team is to reach the end of the stage, not only in the IGA but in the Champions League with the players at the best level.\n25:51 Comment: And if you have not rotated and the player has played everything throughout the season, in that stretch the player is much more tired and that is where he loses the titles.\n25:59 Comment: A good example is Toni Kroos, who played practically everything and that's how he came out amazing.\n26:3 Comment: He arrived after a year and a half, as Was said, not only with his team with Bayern Munich but also with the German team until the World Cup final.\n26:11 Comment: But are you going to dare with Bale and Cristiano? Guti, wait, from now on the ball comes for Carvajal, Carvajal, he leaves it at the penalty spot, he cleared the ball to Rakinski, throw-in for Madrid.\n26:20 Comment: It's not that he dares, I think it's that the players understand that it has to be like this, and that is more difficult, making both Cristiano and Bale see that they have to rest in games to then be able to be at their best.\n26:34 Comment: I think it's very complicated for those types of players.\n26:36 Comment: They have to be selective, to then be strong in the big games.\n26:39 Comment: Play the ball, it comes as Marco says, shield to the opposite side, Teixeira comes, Teixeira goes to face Carvajal, Teixeira dances him inside the danger area, Shakhtar plays inside the area, he takes it to Kroos, Marcelo clears it.\n26:51 Comment: Kevin arrives at Shakhtar on the weak side, on the opposite side of the ball, we have a player from Madrid, Gareth Bale.\n26:57 Comment: Be careful, be careful, Was, because Gareth Bale is completely motionless, holding his left leg and the assistance is coming out, Was.\n27:5 Comment: Let's see, if the doctors say, yes.\n27:10 Comment: He seems like the twin to me, really.\n27:14 Comment: Let's see, let's see, because the alarms are going off in Madrid now.\n27:19 Comment: GC jumps in to warm up, just in case the Welshman can't continue.\n27:22 Comment: Here comes Carvajal, and Bale, we see that he is not active in the play, we see Benzema going to the penalty spot, but at no time do we see the Welshman start, he was already absolutely nailed.\n27:36 Comment: Look, they are telling him that if he changes, they are telling the Welshman that he changes, and as Was says, GC is already hot.\n27:43 Comment: The Bernabéu applauds him, he leaves the pitch visibly limping, come on.\n27:50 Comment: Look, he only eh, he alone Guti, Marcos, he realizes.\n27:55 Comment: It doesn't really look very good.\n27:57 Comment:  No.\n27:58 Comment: He pulls on his calf, I don't know if he has a calf or a solio, but hey, we want it to be nothing.\n28:3 Comment: The whip, the clack.\n28:4 Comment: Yes, he has been able to hear something, and well, the truth is that it is worrying for Real Madrid, especially in the state that Bale is in.\n28:11 Comment: Serna plays the ball, Serna inside for Teixeira, let's see because at the moment Was in Madrid is with 10.\n28:19 Comment:  Yeah.\n28:20 Comment: They continue to warm up several footballers, including as we quoted GC, but Garry Bale has not yet responded.\n28:26 Comment: GC is the first to warm up, Rafa Benítez.\n28:30 Comment: Yes, there is change, there is change.\n28:32 Comment: Well, the tablet is now ready, as Guti says, the tablet Was is now ready.\n28:36 Comment: The change forced by Alesir is being prepared and we will see the scope for the Welshman as well.\n28:40 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo plays, setback for Madrid.\n28:43 Comment: Almost half an hour of play, 0-0 at the Bernabéu, Cristiano tries, he stops, he slips, he skids, also the players in the center.\n28:48 Comment: He takes it to Cristiano, he cleared the ball to Stepanenko.\n28:50 Comment: It's going to be Mateo Kovácsic.\n28:52 Comment: Well, it's going to be another Croatian, Marcos, who you know well as Mateo Kovácsic.\n28:56 Comment: Yes, player from Inter, another 10 for Madrid's midfield.\n29:0 Comment: They were talking from Guti about the reconversion of Toni Kroos, Modric, Isco and James.\n29:5 Comment: Players who are midfielders before joining their team, with a good touch and little defensive work for Madrid.\n29:9 Comment: Right now they already work like everyone else, so they have a very high level of activity.\n29:12 Comment: And Kovácsic is a player who has a very good short pass, long pass, who has a shot on goal.\n29:17 Comment: He has quality, he is one more to have the ball and to walk there.\n29:21 Comment: To Juan Iaisco, Jorge Sotepatina. Goal, goal, goal, goal, goal, goal, goal, goal, goal, goal, goal, goal, goal.\n29:26 Comment: What a mistake.\n29:27 Comment: What a great rock, a great goal.\n29:29 Comment: From Karim the generous Benzema.\n29:32 Comment: Real Madrid scores.\n29:35 Comment: The ball hung by Isco, into the goal from the left.\n29:38 Comment: It doesn't block, Piato and Benzema.\n29:41 Comment: Take out your paw, hunt for the ball in the small area.\n29:44 Comment: Madrid scores first.\n29:47 Comment: It has uncertainty, you can't see it.\n29:50 Comment: You can't see, you can't see.\n29:55 Comment: Hunt the ball in the small area.\n29:58 Comment: Madrid scores first.\n30:0 Comment: 30 of the first part.\n30:2 Comment: Real Madrid 1-0 Satar.\n30:5 Comment: Good wing play, but Piatov's mistake.\n30:9 Comment: I think he measures up poorly there with Rakicki.\n30:12 Comment: And it pushes Karim Benzema who in the Champions League has other different numbers in terms of goalscorer in the league.\n30:18 Comment: In Champions you always plug in.\n30:20 Comment: In the Champions League.\n30:23 Comment: The truth is...\n30:25 Comment:  ...the goalkeeper...\n30:27 Comment: Let's see if this goal from Benzema gives us a little peace of mind and we can look at the game in a different way.\n30:32 Comment: Especially at Real Madrid, right?\n30:34 Comment: Have the ball a little more and try not to have as bad a time as I was having in the last few minutes.\n30:38 Comment: Rafa Benítez took advantage of that goal from Benzema to talk at length with Toni Kroos.\n30:44 Comment: Kovacic comes in, who debuted precisely against Madrid at the age of 17 in the Champions League with Dinamo Zagreb.\n30:50 Comment: However, there is nothing that punishes a team more than when you are with one more than conceding a goal.\n30:56 Comment: I think the goal came at a very bad time for Sactar because...\n31:0 Comment: ...right now they had a lead of one on the field and they should have played on that.\n31:5 Comment: The mistake condemns a bit and above all makes it easier for Kovacic because he can enter the field with another calmness, easy pass, continue and play.\n31:14 Comment: Because now the one who has to run after the ball is Sactar.\n31:17 Comment: And this truth, Nave Marcos, is the image of the injury at the moment that Gareth Bale realizes Guti.\n31:22 Comment: He just stops, he puts his hand there to the calf or the calf, as you say, we'll have to see too.\n31:28 Comment: But be careful, be careful, Madrid's counterattack is coming, there it is on the inside, Kovacic advances.\n31:31 Comment: The ball for Cristiano is short but Cristiano holds on, he now bumps into it in front of Stepanenko who commits a foul in favor of Real Madrid.\n31:39 Comment: And yellow cardboard.\n31:41 Comment: Yellow as Rafa Guerrero says.\n31:44 Comment: For Stepanenko the first of the match.\n31:47 Comment: And Guti saw Gareth's injury.\n31:50 Comment: Yes, they are clear situations where the footballer knows what has happened to him and tries to continue, what happens when he sees that he cannot.\n31:58 Comment: The truth is that it's a shame, I think that now that he was coming into the game more, he was getting a little more out of his football in that midfielder.\n32:6 Comment: The truth is that it is a significant loss for Real Madrid, let's hope it's a small thing and that he recovers as soon as possible.\n32:13 Comment: Let's see now how Piatov, the Ukrainian goalkeeper, also responds after the mistake that led to Real Madrid's first goal of the night.\n32:19 Comment: Cristiano is coming, the distance is approximately 25 meters.\n32:24 Comment: Mark with the spray, perfect now also the situation of the barrier where Tyson, Rakinski and also Fred are.\n32:32 Comment: For Sergio Ramos in a finishing situation.\n32:34 Comment: Claps at the Bernabéu as if it were a long jumper for Cristiano to accompany his career towards hitting.\n32:40 Comment: Behind Carvajal, on the left Modric, in front of Teixeira.\n32:46 Comment: They say the barrier is moving forward, Cristiano comes, hits the ball, rehearsed play.\n32:51 Comment: Ramos is complaining and now the referee is telling him not to jump.\n32:55 Comment: What a fight between Ramos and the referee.\n32:57 Comment: Darío Serna, I think he was grabbing him to fix him, nothing enough to be punishable.\n33:4 Comment: However, always there measuring.\n33:7 Comment: They both go and when you see Ramos is not going to arrive, he ends up falling but it is true that he is going to end up holding him.\n33:13 Comment: It was Serna, it was Estefanenko.\n33:15 Comment: Grabbing to fix what often entails is the penalty point.\n33:20 Comment: I already knew Rafa wasn't going to fight.\n33:21 Comment: It is to be established, but if you look closely, we do not have infections, but there is the regulation and then there is the Rafa Guerrero proposal.\n33:31 Comment: They never usually whistle her, much as Rafa wants to.\n33:34 Comment: Ball up, Marcelo controls.\n33:37 Comment: Well if not, 7 or 8 penalties as you say, right Rafa?\n33:40 Comment: Per game, ball to the left, here comes Isco.\n33:44 Comment: Playing for Modric, Modric up, Ramos.\n33:46 Comment: Here comes Isco.\n33:49 Comment: Playing for Modric, Modric up, Cristiano comes from behind, he released the ball first, which Kovacic does not control.\n33:55 Comment: Take back control, now Fred plays for Sacktardones.\n33:59 Comment: Ball for Tyson, Cebedo doubles him.\n34:1 Comment: Lodo Merenudo plays Tyson inside for Teixeira, he wants to start, Kovacic covers him now.\n34:6 Comment: Teixeira holds on, Kroos comes out, Toni Kroos recovers for Madrid.\n34:8 Comment: Good Toni Kroos in the help, right now Kovacic, Modric and Kroos.\n34:14 Comment: They make a kind of three players inside, although Kovacic is more on the right wing.\n34:19 Comment: Ball for Isco.\n34:21 Comment: Giving Isco a little freedom, as a midfielder, a little bit where he feels better.\n34:27 Comment: If you look closely, Guti's 4-4-2 is now clearer, although we see that Benzema and Cristiano play at different heights.\n34:33 Comment: Wait, wait, Cristiano is coming, as we were saying, of a different height now with Karim Benzema receiving from the inside.\n34:38 Comment: Karim Benzema released it for Isco, Fred cut it off, offloaded the ball to Serna.\n34:42 Comment: The ball that goes backwards, now captain Dario Serna touches, the Croatian comes, Karim Benzema presses up.\n34:47 Comment: Ball to Rakitsky, again to Dario Serna, they pick it up, they don't care about playing even inside their own area to touch it on the foot.\n34:53 Comment: Ball for Serna, he lost control a little, ball up, it comes to Marlos, Ramos cuts, Kroos recovers, plays for Modric.\n34:59 Comment: First of all, Madrid, Kovacic is there.\n35:0 Comment: The back ball for Cristiano that comes back well now for Kovacic, who goes to the rod, the Croatian comes.\n35:6 Comment: At what point Stepanenko caught the ball.\n35:8 Comment: Good help from Stepanenko, this is one of Kovacic's qualities, when driving he has a change of pace and acceleration.\n35:13 Comment: Central Rakitsky came out, that 44, ball again for Tyson, Tyson peaked from the area, ball for Acevedo, he wanted to dance to Carvajal who touched the ball and caused the goal kick.\n35:23 Comment: How quickly Shakhtar comes out.\n35:26 Comment: It comes out very quickly, yes, the truth is, Real Madrid is having a hard time recovering the ball in Shakhtar's field and when they come out, they come out especially on the side with great force and reach the top very well.\n35:40 Comment: How Stepanenko took a risk there with yellow cardboard, but how well he did it right on the front, on the limit, on the edge of the abyss.\n35:46 Comment: At the point of no return, Real Madrid's first touch in transition was a great play, the ball went to Carvajal.\n35:52 Comment: Carvajal wants to put the center in front of Acevedo now, who lowers his ass, plays the ball for Kovacic.\n35:57 Comment: This one inside, ball for Varane, look at the two Madrid centre-backs.\n36:0 Comment: There now appears Toni Kroos, playing in the rearmost corner, ball for Marcelo.\n36:4 Comment: Marcelo steps on, drags Madrid's glove for the moment, he wants to get Shakhtar out of that trap, out of that cage so that he can look for the ball and he doesn't.\n36:11 Comment: Note for Carvajal, Carvajal playing for Modric.\n36:14 Comment: Modric with Acevedo, offloads Modric, ball for Carvajal.\n36:17 Comment: The Croatian's mobility also comes for Benzema, on the verge of losing, the ball goes to Carvajal.\n36:21 Comment: The auto pass now in front of Acevedo, which blocked him, blocked his path and is a goal kick.\n36:29 Comment: Yes, Madrid is trying to stop the game a little more, have more possession, go from side to side, try to find spaces on the outside.\n36:37 Comment: But it is true that we have to do it with a little more speed.\n36:40 Comment: The speed is a little slow and they practically tilt a little, they get to the ball quickly.\n36:46 Comment: Now that people are also talking about the best player that one or the other has trained with, I ask you, and I also remember the words of Ronaldo Nazario back in the day when he arrived at the Madrid locker room where you were Guti, and he said that I had seen a footballer with your quality.\n37:0 Comment: Yes, the truth is that it surprised me, it surprised me and I liked it.\n37:4 Comment: For a player like Ronaldo Nazario to say it was incredible for me.\n37:8 Comment: I have always told him that with him he has been the player I have enjoyed the most, because the truth is that it made it easy for me that he could score balls for me to score a goal.\n37:19 Comment: What a shame about the injuries, because, and yet, look at everything Ronaldo achieved.\n37:23 Comment: Yes, look at everything that has been, it's true. If he had injured us so much, the truth is that it would have been much more.\n37:28 Comment: I think it's a bit of a pity that we, the people who have loved football, have had to not see him much longer and at a high level, which I think was something impressive when he was good.\n37:41 Comment:  The phenomenon.\n37:43 Comment: The phenomenon, yes sir. In the photo and also, as Guti says, reaching that level, even diminished.\n37:49 Comment: The only one in modern football who stood up to Cristiano and Messi in their one-goal-per-game goals.\n37:55 Comment: The phenomenon always marked.\n37:56 Comment: There's Teixeira. Teixeira up, ball now inside. Glascki comes to play, Ramos closes well, ball to the wing for Shakhtar.\n38:5 Comment: There are seven left until half-time, countdown for the moment at the Bernabéu. Real Madrid 1-1, goal from Karim Benzema. Shakhtar 2-0.\n38:14 Comment: First game of Real Madrid's debut in this Champions League, in total Champions League, in A3 medium.\n38:18 Comment: He wants to play the ball on the left and Shakhtar is looking for the option, but he can't find it, he takes it calmly, he gives Cebedo the ball for Teixeira.\n38:24 Comment: Return again for Cebedo, Cebedo for Teixeira, Kovacic also puts pressure there with Carvajal.\n38:31 Comment: 3 for 2, now it works out well for Shakhtar, peak of the area, receives the ball, Tyson plays.\n38:36 Comment: Ball there again for Tyson, Tyson inside, play for Stepanenko.\n38:40 Comment: Very ugly, you have to leave, at the moment Rakinski is trying, Benzema closed him down, Colegiero says he's missing.\n38:47 Comment: Let me remind you that Friday is approaching, filler 3, we will offer you the best plan, the look on your face sounds familiar to me,\n38:52 Comment: with a season full of great news, Lolita and Isai La Durcal together with Ángel Yasser, Carlos Latre among the jury.\n38:59 Comment: And we start with three luxury guests, Rocco, Angie and Jhun Barrera, your face sounds familiar to me, premiering this Friday at 10 pm on Antena 3.\n39:7 Comment: Tyson puts it, far post, Ramos jumped, he didn't arrive, goal kick.\n39:12 Comment: Moment 1-0 for Real Madrid, goal from Benzema and a change, the obligatory one from Garry Bale.\n39:18 Comment: We will see the extent of the muscle injury, without a doubt.\n39:22 Comment: The Croatian Kovacic, this summer's signing, has come in, Carvajal plays the ball, the ball is there for Kovacic.\n39:28 Comment: This one with Toni Kroos, Toni Kroos up top comes to receive Cristiano, playing again as Guti says, with his back turned, coming to receive and touch.\n39:35 Comment: Yes, but a lot of mobility there in the area between the lines, always looking there behind the pivots.\n39:41 Comment: We are perhaps seeing a very participative Christian inside.\n39:45 Comment: Yes, the truth is, we were not used to him going down so low to receive the ball.\n39:49 Comment: And we have practically not seen him on the wing, I think it is an important fact and I think what Benítez wants from Cristiano is for him to be close to the goal.\n39:57 Comment: Closer to the goal than a striker, I think there are few players there.\n40:2 Comment: Toni Kroos plays, Toni Kroos up, Kovacic is coming now, he was dragging the ball for Karim Benzema.\n40:7 Comment: The same Guti language, the one you spoke too, with those back-to-back passes.\n40:11 Comment: Marcelo comes, Marcelo puts it, the ball goes to the second goal, Carvajal appears, she comes dead, the ball goes to Modric, Modric lifts.\n40:17 Comment: Stepanenko has now put his foot down, Real Madrid and Shakhtar are competing at the front, Kovacic is coming.\n40:21 Comment: He puts his boot in, fresh, recovers again, ball for Kroos, Kroos up for Modric, he can put it together, out.\n40:27 Comment: Luka Modric's left foot, the second is about to fall.\n40:32 Comment: You applauded Modric at the Bernabéu and confirmed to me from Real Madrid that Gareth Bale is suffering from muscle discomfort in his left calf, he has been observed and ice has been applied.\n40:42 Comment: Tests, the day after tomorrow.\n40:43 Comment: Our colleagues in the mobile unit say that we will soon see that play in which Gareth Bale could be injured.\n40:49 Comment: Let's see if we can discern with that repetition and what a heel how Kovacic wanted to drag at first.\n40:55 Comment: However, in football today the easiest way to create a scoring chance is to recover the ball in the opposite field.\n41:2 Comment: Those two, three seconds, those two, three real touches, those two, three touches of the ball, are the ones that can do the most.\n41:8 Comment: That play by Modric, he opted for the shot but he had one more pass, he could go deep with it, there was numerical superiority of the Madrid players, attackers over defenders.\n41:16 Comment: It puts pressure on Cristiano. That's why, as Guti said, not all teams can do it, not all players are designed for that, for recovery.\n41:24 Comment: But in today's football it is key, it is the possibility of recovering the ball.\n41:28 Comment: It puts pressure on Cristiano. That's why, as Guti said, not all teams can do it, not all players are designed for that, for recovery.\n41:36 Comment: But in today's football it is key to win the ball in the opponent's field to have fewer meters towards the goal, to counter and also catch the team that loses the ball without retreating.\n41:48 Comment: Yes, the truth is, it is very important. I think that the work that Kovacic just did recovering that ball makes you see that not only...\n41:57 Comment: Careful Teixeira, Teixeira, Teixeira does... Oooh! Carvajal's rejection went straight to Korner.\n42:4 Comment: You don't just have to be good with the ball, right?\n42:6 Comment: There was offside. Offside, correct. Yes, yes, offside.\n42:10 Comment: That not only do you have to be good with the ball, but you also have to work for the team.\n42:14 Comment: And as Marcos said, it is very important to steal from the front, right? Because it takes away a lot of the effort you have to make behind and especially because you are much closer.\n42:22 Comment: With one pass, with two passes, you filter a ball to have a chance to score.\n42:27 Comment: And above all Esteban Aguti, be careful.\n42:30 Comment: It was Pera who comes again, there he recovers the ball again Esteban Enco, delays the ball for Cebedo.\n42:35 Comment: We are at 43, two left until half-time. Let's see how much the Croatian referee Iván Bebek adds.\n42:41 Comment: Above all, he said, when your teammate has the ball you have to open a passing lane for him.\n42:45 Comment: From there you have to separate yourself from him and open a space so that there can be a pass without the defender being able to recover.\n42:53 Comment: When your teammate loses the ball, you are open. That time you have from open to closed to close, if the opposing team has quality and takes advantage of it, there is no time to reach the defense.\n43:4 Comment: Therefore, it is recovering and opening the door for each goal.\n43:7 Comment: Sometimes it's a blink, like the one Kovacic did with that dragging backheel for Benzema.\n43:10 Comment: The Croatian Mateo Kovacic plays precisely. The ball is returned by Isco. He comes again, now inside, as he likes, the former Inter player disengages.\n43:17 Comment: He plays for Isco. Isco for Luka Modric. At the moment it is still 1-0 at the Bernabéu.\n43:24 Comment: Remember the best summaries later on Mega of this match between Galatasaray and Atlético de Madrid and Sevilla-Burussia-Mönchengladbach.\n43:30 Comment: Kroos plays the ball. Kroos again with Modric. Modric there for Sergio Ramos. Ramos appears. He plays to the left. Ball for Marcelo. Marcelo controls in two halves.\n43:37 Comment: Now he wants to leave Darío Serna. He wants to put the center in. Marcelo gets it. Ball for Cristiano. The ball stayed between his legs. It bounced directly off.\n43:46 Comment: Very difficult. Tense center. If it touches a defender it could even be a goal. I think that when he sees it coming he has it on him and there is no time to react.\n43:56 Comment: Look, this is the moment in which Bale falls to the ground after driving. If it is Guti's blow, perhaps it could be less than what we just saw.\n44:6 Comment: If it is a blow, it is difficult for the player to leave the game. If he has noticed any discomfort, it is clear that the doctors are not going to say anything until they do a test.\n44:17 Comment: But if you've noticed it, it's probably a break. As Susana said, as a precaution. Let's see the Argentine's reach.\n44:25 Comment: Yes, because he limped a lot. From our position it seemed like he was pointing at him.\n44:31 Comment: Ball for Benzema. Rakinski delays. What a mistake he threw at Piatov who takes it out of the way. The ball comes to Marlos. Ramos crossed the line. Band.\n44:39 Comment: I was telling the doctor about a hardening. That was the sensation. He makes the gesture. Maybe that's where it loads and it's the moment before the rupture. I don't know. We'll see.\n44:51 Comment: Ball has to do a sprint as we saw when driving under pressure from the Shakhtar player. Then he takes a hit with the player who is coming from his face.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: The truth is that it was a big unforeseen event for Real Madrid for two players who were at a high level.\n0:4 Comment: In addition, Varane came fresh because he was not a starter at Cornelly Alperta.\n0:9 Comment: In Cornelly Alperta. The second half begins on Antena 3, sixth Champions total.\n0:12 Comment: Toni Kroos plays the ball. The ball is there, precisely for Pepe, who touches his first ball.\n0:16 Comment: Touch to the right for Carvajal. Carvajal returns for Pepe.\n0:19 Comment: Regular couple with Sergio Ramos.\n0:22 Comment: The magician with Gonol's staff in length. She does it now parallel.\n0:24 Comment: Play there for Benzema, let the Frenchman do well now.\n0:27 Comment: Benzema hides the ball well. He wants to leave but he already has four Ukrainians on him.\n0:31 Comment: He touches the ball behind. Carvajal does it again. Ball for Pepe.\n0:34 Comment: Pepe now does change the front. He does it for Marcelo.\n0:37 Comment: Marcelo controls, starts, sleeps the ball. He plays it for Isco. Isco Alarcón comes to receive.\n0:41 Comment: Alarcón is leaving. There is the man from Malaga. He takes off, he chases him.\n0:44 Comment: Fred unloads the ball. Cristiano did not arrive. But Kovacic does now.\n0:47 Comment:  Kovacic drops the ball. Stepanenko's rejection. Not quite.\n0:50 Comment: Ball that Kovacic wins for Benzema.\n0:52 Comment: Benzema puts it in. Pjatov put it in his fist and takes the exact ball.\n0:57 Comment: Madrid is starting to push. How important is that pressure from above, that intensity and raising the level.\n1:3 Comment: Beware the cons.\n1:4 Comment: It's going to be an intense, entertaining second part. This is indicated above all by the data we gave.\n1:8 Comment: In the statistics, Balón-Guti possession. 52% for Real Madrid. 48% for Shakhtar in the first half.\n1:14 Comment: Yes, we have seen that Real Madrid has not had all the possession they would have liked.\n1:18 Comment: And well, I think that what Benitez surely asks of Real Madrid in this second half is that.\n1:25 Comment: That they have more possession, that they are longer and faster possessions.\n1:29 Comment: And above all, there are not so many turnovers.\n1:32 Comment: I think that Shakhtar is always taking that second play and it is one of the things that Real Madrid has to improve.\n1:38 Comment: The moment he recovers the ball, the second play is his.\n1:42 Comment: And be careful, Madrid only has one bullet left. Close it. At what point now for Shakhtar.\n1:45 Comment: Madrid recovers. Benzema is coming. It's 2 for 1.\n1:47 Comment: He's going to accompany Cristiano. He gives it to him.\n1:49 Comment: He doesn't quite get the Kucher ball out.\n1:51 Comment: Cristiano doesn't arrive either. He put his boot down there at Serna.\n1:54 Comment: And it is a foul in favor of Shakhtar.\n1:57 Comment: Too generous. I think he should have continued with the ball and tried to do something else.\n2:2 Comment: The truth is that Benzema pays close attention to Cristiano in every game.\n2:6 Comment: I think he should, apart from keeping an eye on Cristiano, play his football and score his goals.\n2:12 Comment: Well, he has equaled Ibra with that goal as the tenth top scorer in the Champions League.\n2:16 Comment: With 43 goals.\n2:18 Comment: And right away we're going to see an image. I'm going to ask her about it.\n2:20 Comment: Talking about injuries today at Real Madrid.\n2:22 Comment: An image that we are looking for precisely from the first part, as Guas said, by Rafael Varam.\n2:27 Comment: By the way, Sevilla is ahead.\n2:29 Comment: Gameiro, Kevin Gameiro, the French penalty kicker, puts Nervión's team ahead.\n2:34 Comment: The Ramón Sánchez Pijuan team advances. Then remember the best summary, the most comprehensive.\n2:39 Comment: In mega, at 10:30. Also later with the beach bar.\n2:42 Comment: This works, huh?\n2:43 Comment: At the moment our people are all winning.\n2:45 Comment:  Yes Yes.\n2:46 Comment: Atlético de Madrid in Turkey. Griezmann's two 0 to 2.\n2:49 Comment: Sevilla winning 1-0 at home against Borussia Monchengladbach.\n2:52 Comment: Be careful that the group of death is not just because of City and Juve.\n2:55 Comment: Also for Borussia Monchengladbach.\n2:57 Comment: And Real Madrid is also winning 1-0.\n2:59 Comment: But be careful, Benítez only has one bullet left if he has to make a change in these 45 minutes remaining until the end.\n3:5 Comment: A little less now.\n3:6 Comment: Play the ball inside Iseira. Unload the ball to the right for Dario Serna.\n3:10 Comment: The Croatian plays in front of Isco.\n3:12 Comment: For Estefanenko. The ball that goes again changed to the left.\n3:15 Comment: Ball that Rakinski receives. Rakinski sends it to the profile for Acevedo.\n3:19 Comment: Download the Brazilian. Play for Tyson.\n3:22 Comment: Tyson in the face on the diagonal. He stops at the last moment in front of Kovacic.\n3:25 Comment: Ball again for Acevedo. Acevedo back for Tyson.\n3:29 Comment: Tyson plays for Estefanenko. Estefanenko the one who corrects. He plays for Frey.\n3:32 Comment: The one who handles it. Ball up again for Iseira.\n3:34 Comment: At the moment the magic appears from the Brazilian in three quarters of the field.\n3:38 Comment: Touch and control. He puts her to sleep. How well Dario Serna does it.\n3:41 Comment: Ball to Frey. Returns to Serna. Shakhtar hides it.\n3:44 Comment: What capacity does Shakhtar have to move the ball from one side to the other.\n3:47 Comment: To terrify Madrid with pressure, with reduced space.\n3:49 Comment: And as soon as Madrid goes under pressure they change the playing area.\n3:52 Comment: And once again Shakhtar has to cross the border.\n3:55 Comment: At the moment in the last 30 meters Shakhtar can't find that pass.\n3:59 Comment: But in ball possession, in touch, they are doing very well.\n4:2 Comment: It's hard for Madrid to get the ball back.\n4:4 Comment: There's Marlos. Marlos is still hiding her.\n4:6 Comment: Now the Brazilian also plays more on the wing. But he does it inside for the Ukrainian team.\n4:9 Comment: He offloads the ball to Dario Serna. Dario Serna in front of Isco.\n4:12 Comment: Madrid, as Woody says, also has a hard time recovering. They do it in a haphazard way.\n4:15 Comment: But it's a mistake. And this is the... When they treat Varane there, he has a wound.\n4:20 Comment: In fact, it is a cut almost at the height of the ankle on the shin.\n4:25 Comment: Yes, maybe it's more out of caution or because I noticed something.\n4:30 Comment: What happens is that he has continued playing.\n4:32 Comment: That doesn't mean that the injury is not as serious as Bale's case.\n4:36 Comment: He was already lying on the grass saying I can't.\n4:38 Comment: That's where the ball plays. Marlos from Adigonal comes in front of Marcelo.\n4:41 Comment: Be careful, it can hurt the leg. Unload the ball on the front.\n4:43 Comment:  Gambettia snail. Fred comes to Marlos. Marlos hides her.\n4:46 Comment: But Madrid is coming now with Ramos. Ramos is leaving.\n4:48 Comment: What an entry by Stepanenko and he has cardboard.\n4:51 Comment: Yes, it's actually going to that street.\n4:53 Comment: And it has yellow cardboard.\n4:54 Comment: He's going out into the street.\n4:55 Comment: Second yellow for Stepanenko. Rojas goes out. He keeps 10 for Shakhtar.\n5:0 Comment: We mentioned it in the first half. It is the defensive pivot who is responsible for the tactical foul.\n5:5 Comment: Ramos, huh.\n5:6 Comment: And at the end very exposed.\n5:8 Comment: And be careful Ramos because in the fall the shoulder seems to have not only been bruised. Let's see.\n5:15 Comment: Rafa Guerrero, for you the second yellow is fair.\n5:17 Comment: For me, both are fair. The first and the second yellow.\n5:20 Comment: Therefore, the referee is very good at making this decision. Also important.\n5:25 Comment: The only ones in the game were Stepanenko, yes.\n5:27 Comment: Yes, he is the one who risks the most.\n5:28 Comment: And look out Ramos, he has obvious expressions of pain.\n5:32 Comment: Shoulder. They are moving his arm, his shoulder to see if he reacts.\n5:36 Comment: He continues lying on the ground while Benítez takes the opportunity to chat and give instructions to Isco.\n5:42 Comment: Guti falls completely off balance.\n5:45 Comment: Yes, it was a bad fall. Let's hope it's nothing.\n5:50 Comment: Because well, apart from the game and the importance of the three points, the importance of maintaining a squad.\n5:56 Comment: It would be the third injured in this game.\n5:59 Comment: Let's hope that's not the case.\n6:2 Comment: The Salta match is summarized in two actions.\n6:6 Comment: A mistake by the goalkeeper that represents Real Madrid's first goal.\n6:13 Comment: And then a mistake. What a player has to understand on the field when he has a yellow card is that he has to be more cautious.\n6:20 Comment: And in this case it has not been and it leaves Salta in trouble.\n6:24 Comment: He arrives late and that bitch Sergio Ramos knocks this gang down.\n6:30 Comment: Be careful if you put your hand and collarbone on your shoulder.\n6:32 Comment: Yes, he puts his hand on his shoulder. He goes off the pitch so they can continue treating him.\n6:38 Comment: And send Nacho, Rafa Benítez, to warm up. In addition, Encherichev is already there, and Casemiro is also there.\n6:44 Comment: He has it much more. He has already included Pepe as baran.\n6:48 Comment: It is always a problem for any coach to have to make all the changes forced by injury.\n6:53 Comment: Madrid would be left without the possibility of changing the dynamics of the match.\n6:58 Comment: Tactically, if things don't go quite well.\n7:0 Comment: Or that last change in the last 15-20 minutes that you want to give the game more speed.\n7:6 Comment: But if Ramos can't continue, Benítez would be condemned.\n7:10 Comment: We have also goto this broad and versatile template.\n7:13 Comment: It has players who can perform in various positions in case they have to change on the fly.\n7:19 Comment: But it is true, as Marcos says, that from the bench you can no longer surprise him.\n7:21 Comment: Ball for Isco. Isco plays for Modric.\n7:23 Comment: He receives between the lines, there Corata is more advanced now with the presence of his countryman who receives Kovacic.\n7:28 Comment: Almost at the same height in front of Toni Kroos, the three of them staggered.\n7:31 Comment: He plays for Isco, more of a midfielder.\n7:32 Comment: Isco is coming now in Bale's absence.\n7:34 Comment: In front of him are Benzema and Cristiano as two, nine.\n7:37 Comment: Kroos plays. The ball is there for Modric, who was trying to change direction by feinting with his body.\n7:42 Comment: Play for Ramos. Ramos up. Ball for Isco.\n7:45 Comment: Isco inside for Modric. Shakhtar doesn't move.\n7:47 Comment: Move the ball to Madrid. What happens! Modric puts it in!\n7:49 Comment: Cut to Zebedo Corner.\n7:51 Comment: Great. The truth is, right now is when Real Madrid has players to be vertical.\n7:56 Comment: To be a little more vertical and look for more scoring opportunities.\n8:0 Comment: I think that when both Modric, Kovacic and Isco are in that position,\n8:5 Comment: Having Benzema approach or Cristiano moving away is very good for them to try that last pass.\n8:10 Comment: The presence there of Mateo Kovacic. He tries to play the ball again.\n8:13 Comment: Luka Modric comes to Corata to set the bar.\n8:15 Comment: He put his boot in, took it out and scolded him along the way too.\n8:18 Comment: Tyson was there with his teammates on defense.\n8:21 Comment: Ball that Madrid recovers behind. Ball for Ramos.\n8:24 Comment: What happens is that Madrid is attacking with two forwards, Cristiano and Benzema.\n8:28 Comment: They are both fixing the two centre-backs. Be careful Benzema.\n8:31 Comment: Look, look, look Benzema is coming. Benzema recovers.\n8:33 Comment: The side of the area is already internal. Benzema comes. He fixes the center back.\n8:35 Comment: Benzema on the outside. Penalty point. Cristiano!\n8:38 Comment: They claim a penalty at the hands of the Shakhtar player and the referee now awards a penalty.\n8:47 Comment: At first the main referee did not signal it, but the goal line assistant warned through the microphone that it was a penalty.\n9:5 Comment: They are there to make decisions and they have made them there.\n9:10 Comment: Well, Cristiano saw it very clearly. You have already seen how he reacted when at first they had not called a penalty.\n9:15 Comment: Piatov goes to his right side 70% of the time.\n9:20 Comment: It's not a penalty.\n9:22 Comment: And it is Serna who also protests because he is the one who receives the penalty.\n9:26 Comment: Here comes Cristiano and as Marcos López says, he usually shoots to the right on the highest percentage of occasions.\n9:33 Comment: Cristiano comes. Arms his leg. Short run. Goal, goal, goal, goal, goal, goal, goal.\n9:39 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo's goal.\n9:46 Comment: Real Madrid scores the second. Cristiano does it with a penalty at the Bernabéu.\n9:52 Comment: Ten in the second half. Real Madrid two, Shak Cardones zero.\n9:59 Comment: A well-executed penalty and a penalty above the statistics.\n10:2 Comment: Cristiano has his preferred side, his left side, the goalkeeper's right.\n10:7 Comment: And Piatov throws himself there. Therefore, everything in order, everything predictable. Cristiano executes very well to the back bar.\n10:14 Comment: Benzema's play was wonderful. A player with so much class and so much quality.\n10:19 Comment: The truth is that he has practically done everything well.\n10:24 Comment: It's what he invented, Guti. What you invented.\n10:27 Comment:  Marvelous.\n10:28 Comment: What happens is that he is a center forward.\n10:30 Comment: Coming from that position it is much more difficult to see players or forwards with as much quality as Benzema.\n10:37 Comment: I think he is an unusual and difficult forward to watch.\n10:41 Comment: I think I could only play in this position, in this Real Madrid.\n10:45 Comment: Maybe you don't need so much goal because there is Cristiano who does it.\n10:49 Comment: That's why it's so necessary. I always say it's a nine with the soul of a ten.\n10:52 Comment: It seems like he has a ten in his heart.\n10:55 Comment: What I notice about Cristiano on the field when he plays with Benzema is that his face changes.\n10:59 Comment: I think he is super happy to find an ally like Benzema on the pitch.\n11:3 Comment: How he sees the gaps. The generous Karim Benzema. That's what his name means too.\n11:9 Comment: About the penalty I don't know what Rafa will think, but seeing the replays, clear back.\n11:14 Comment: What the Santos player said.\n11:16 Comment: Serna was right.\n11:18 Comment: He threw himself there and it is true that Serna risks a lot because he completely turns his back on Cristiano's play and shot.\n11:24 Comment: But in the last repetition that is seen from the position of Cristiano's shot, he turns his back.\n11:28 Comment: Sometimes Guti and the players are right when they tell you.\n11:33 Comment: Yes, but it's not easy, Rafa. It's not easy to see.\n11:36 Comment: The play is more complicated and the shot is more complicated.\n11:38 Comment:  Very complicated.\n11:40 Comment: Well, fire to Shakhtar.\n11:42 Comment: Antonio, second part doctor in Madrid.\n11:44 Comment: Severe blow to the left ankle.\n11:46 Comment: It has swollen because the studs have stuck in it and as Guti said, it is better to retire as a precaution.\n11:52 Comment: The cue hurts.\n11:54 Comment: Perhaps the blood and the pain because it must have touched a little nerve area.\n11:59 Comment: Well, the information that Susana Guas brings us there next to the benches.\n12:2 Comment: Privileged vision.\n12:4 Comment: Our companion on the grass plays the ball.\n12:7 Comment: The ball is there again for Fred.\n12:9 Comment: Download for Serna. Serna puts it in. What a ball!\n12:11 Comment:  That's good!\n12:12 Comment: Glascki didn't arrive, Franco hit the shot, but my goodness, what a ball Serna threw at him.\n12:17 Comment: Great cross. Glascki lacks speed to put his body in front of the ball and orient himself towards the goal.\n12:23 Comment: He arrives a second late and executes poorly.\n12:25 Comment: And wait because Real Madrid's toll in this debut in the Champions League is being quite expensive.\n12:29 Comment: Sergio Ramos asks for the change. He can't continue because of that blow to his shoulder and he came in prepared.\n12:35 Comment: In fact, Guas doesn't move. His elbow is practically bent.\n12:39 Comment: It is given to Guti as if it were a sling, but without having it attached and it does not move it.\n12:43 Comment: You can see that he is not moving his arm, that he is uncomfortable.\n12:47 Comment: It's probably out of caution too.\n12:49 Comment: And seeing that the game is 2-0, maybe it's best to rest and try to look ahead to the next day.\n12:57 Comment: History of Madrid is Paco Llorente-Gento against Porto in Las Santas.\n13:3 Comment: There arm, sling and running.\n13:6 Comment: Iscoi comes with the front. My God!\n13:9 Comment: Where the team from Malaga wanted to put it.\n13:12 Comment: The Bernabéu applauds and the Guas change comes.\n13:15 Comment: Because the captain of Real Madrid is leaving.\n13:18 Comment: We will also see what extent the injury may have.\n13:22 Comment: And now he kisses Marcelo while they exchange the captain's armband.\n13:26 Comment: It's just that arm, the one with the bracelet.\n13:29 Comment: The left arm, the left shoulder and the collarbone of Sergio Ramos that he practically carried.\n13:34 Comment: And that's the emotion.\n13:41 Comment: In that area of ​​the shoulder it is very important for balance in the race.\n13:44 Comment: Also during the race there is vibration and the vibration produces pain.\n13:48 Comment: It appears relevant in football but it is fundamental.\n13:52 Comment: If the clavicle shoulder is not doing well, it goes to Iscoi.\n13:55 Comment: Up, my mother, the one who wanted to throw Benzema there.\n13:58 Comment: Recovers own Iscoi.\n14:0 Comment: The man from Malaga was going from strength to strength in the second half.\n14:3 Comment: Playing further forward, the ball is there that you step on, it drags.\n14:6 Comment: He puts the ball up for Cristiano who gets hit from behind now.\n14:9 Comment: The referee, very close, whistles the foul in favor of Madrid.\n14:12 Comment: Clear foul by Kucher.\n14:15 Comment: Yes, Iscoi was much better in the second half.\n14:17 Comment: You can see that he is more liberated.\n14:19 Comment: When he plays on the wing he is much more concerned about being there.\n14:22 Comment: And here he plays more freely.\n14:24 Comment: He plays more where he likes.\n14:26 Comment: I think that if someone is a midfielder at Real Madrid,\n14:29 Comment: Apart from others like James who is not here now, it is Iscoi.\n14:32 Comment: I think he looks happy there.\n14:34 Comment: It's that hook, as Guti says.\n14:36 Comment: That position that you also developed when you played.\n14:39 Comment: And there is Cristiano Ronaldo commenting on the match with Guti,\n14:42 Comment: With Marcos López, with Susana Guas, with you too.\n14:44 Comment: Greetings to all of you who also follow us on Atletico.\n14:46 Comment: Christian is coming, the foul is good, outlined a little to the left.\n14:50 Comment: It's good for a right-hander now like Cristiano.\n14:52 Comment: Let's see if he throws the Tomahawk.\n14:54 Comment: There is the barrier, the wall of four.\n14:56 Comment: Madrid's two are also orange so the ball can pass through there.\n14:59 Comment: Iscoi rejected.\n15:0 Comment: A stick there too, Luka Modric.\n15:2 Comment: In the middle is Karim Benzema, Cristiano comes.\n15:6 Comment:  Out.\n15:8 Comment: It brushed against the roof of the goal.\n15:10 Comment:  But much.\n15:11 Comment: Good hit, tight.\n15:14 Comment: Precisely searching square in Pein interior.\n15:17 Comment: Good hit Christian, he hits really well.\n15:20 Comment: But Piatov had marked the play well.\n15:23 Comment: Yes, trademark.\n15:25 Comment: Cristiano's usual hitting, hard, strong and on top of that it goes down well.\n15:31 Comment: It's a complicated shot for Luso.\n15:35 Comment: It will even end up sometimes turning the leg, almost as if it were with the inside.\n15:41 Comment: That's where Keylor Navas plays the ball, he puts it up.\n15:44 Comment: We have barely mentioned him so far in the game.\n15:46 Comment: And Shakhtar is disputing Madrid for position.\n15:48 Comment: But for now Real Madrid 2 in the Champions League debut.\n15:50 Comment: In total Champions League, Shakhtar 0.\n15:52 Comment: First quarter of an hour of the second half.\n15:54 Comment: Ball up, but with three changes already made by Benítez.\n15:57 Comment: You can't lose one more footballer.\n15:58 Comment: He doesn't have any bullets left.\n16:0 Comment: All three due to injury.\n16:1 Comment: Marcelo is coming, Marcelo is there for Pepe.\n16:3 Comment: Madrid is finishing with two completely different centre-backs with which they started the game.\n16:7 Comment: In a few games that happened.\n16:10 Comment: Perhaps one of the unwritten rules of football for a coach is\n16:13 Comment: If the center backs work, don't change them in the game.\n16:17 Comment: But that's the usual thing, right?\n16:18 Comment: The thing is, this is something...\n16:20 Comment: Injuries, of course. That's why in the end I think it's a strange thing, right?\n16:23 Comment: That's football, huh?\n16:24 Comment:  That is.\n16:25 Comment: Isco is coming, Isco Bancarat.\n16:26 Comment: Isco on the diagonal in front of Serna.\n16:28 Comment: Download now Marcelo the way Marcelo likes it.\n16:30 Comment: The Brazilian ends up taking it, but now Fred also comes under pressure.\n16:33 Comment: In

throw-in!\n16:47 Comment: Okay, Rakinski.\n16:48 Comment: And I remind you that today after the game at Oligro 3.0\n16:51 Comment: They celebrate the birthday of Trancas and Barrancas by giving away a car.\n16:54 Comment: If they call you during the program and ask you what the password is, it's your birthday.\n16:57 Comment: Say it and the car will be yours.\n17:1 Comment: You know, huh?\n17:2

right, he wants to put the center in, Carvajal does it.\n17:16 Comment: It comes out bitten, it seemed like it was inside.\n17:18 Comment: Kovačić was about to steal there.\n17:20 Comment: They demand a hand now and the brave man paints a penalty.\n17:24 Comment: That has all the earmarks of being a hand, eh?\n17:27 Comment: Yes, but a lot of doubts, right?\n17:28 Comment: Because at first I think he thought it was from Carvajal, then he changed.\n17:32 Comment: Indeed, Guti.\n17:33 Comment: I don't know, too many doubts.\n17:34 Comment: Let's see, Rafa.\n17:35 Comment: Guti has said the thought correctly.\n17:37 Comment: He thinks to paint it against Madrid, but then he rectifies.\n17:41 Comment: I think you got the call too.\n17:43 Comment: The penalty is clear, on the other hand.\n17:45 Comment: Here it has come closer.\n17:47 Comment: There we see how he fails in the rejection, when he sees that Carvajal is going to take it.\n17:50 Comment: It's true that he grabs you with a tight arm.\n17:52 Comment: Cristiano is coming, Cristiano against Piatto.\n17:53 Comment: Cristiano, goal, goal, goal, goal, goal, goal, goal.\n17:55 Comment: Same side, same back bar.\n17:57

first penalty and has put it there, why change?\n18:37 Comment: I think Piatto played at 50%.\n18:40 Comment: He says, well, now I'm going to go to the other side.\n18:42 Comment: Let's see if he thinks the same as me.\n18:44 Comment: There always doubts, both the shooter and the goalkeeper.\n18:47 Comment: Will you throw it to me on the same side?\n18:49 Comment: And the forward will say, hey, are you going to go to the same side?\n18:52 Comment: In the end, well, you never know.\n18:54 Comment: Sometimes the one who endures the most wins there.\n18:55 Comment: Cristiano is already the

    "summary": "In a compelling Champions League encounter at the iconic Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, Real Madrid proved formidable against Ukrainian giants Shakhtar Donetsk, securing a dominant 4-0 victory in their group stage opener. The match saw Real Madrid, under the stewardship of Rafa Benítez, executing a tactically impressive performance complemented by moments of individual brilliance, against a Shakhtar side that struggled to gain a foothold.\n\nThe game began with Real Madrid asserting control right from the outset. The initial exchanges showcased the very essence of why Madrid is considered a powerhouse in European football. The defensive quartet, marshaled by Sergio Ramos and Raphaël Varane, exhibited calmness and precision in their ball distribution, often involving Keylor Navas, their dependable Costa Rican goalkeeper, in recycling possession. Dani Carvajal and Marcelo, the dynamic fullbacks, played pivotal roles in pushing Madrid forward, offering width and creativity down the flanks.\n\nDespite Madrid's dominance in possession, Shakhtar displayed resilience, pressing high and trying to disrupt Madrid's build-up play. However, Madrid's midfield trio of Luka Modrić, Toni Kroos, and the ever-elusive Isco proved too fluid for the Ukrainian press. Modrić and Kroos particularly stood out with their immaculate passing and ability to orchestrate play, ensuring that Madrid maintained their tempo and dictated the game.\n\nMadrid's first real threat came courtesy of Gareth Bale, who consistently troubled Shakhtar’s defence with his searing pace. His ability to stretch play and deliver pinpoint crosses was evident, drawing a save from Shakhtar’s goalkeeper Andriy Pyatov early into the game. This relentless pressure soon paid dividends as Madrid capitalized on a defensive mishap. Isco, showing a flash of brilliance, delivered a cross that caught Pyatov off-guard, allowing Karim Benzema to pounce and comfortably slot the ball home, giving Real Madrid a well-deserved lead.\n\nDespite being a goal down, Shakhtar did not capitulate. They continued to execute their passing game effectively, often building from the back and looking for openings in Madrid’s defence. However, it soon became apparent that Real Madrid’s meticulous preparation and strategic setup would be difficult to breach. Sergio Ramos and Raphaël Varane were imperious at the back, ably supported by the industrious Dani Carvajal and Marcelo, who were equally potent in defensive and offensive duties.\n\nA moment of drama unfolded when Shakhtar’s Taras Stepanenko received his marching orders. Having already been booked earlier in the match, his late challenge on Sergio Ramos saw him earn a second yellow card, reducing Shakhtar to 10 men. This incident not only served as a defensive blow to Shakhtar but also necessitated a tactical reshuffle that hampered their ability to attack with the same vigor.\n\nRafael Benítez’s men took full advantage of their numerical superiority. Cristiano Ronaldo, who had been relatively subdued up to that point, began to find more space and opportunities. After a handball in the area by Shakhtar’s Serhiy Kryvtsov, Ronaldo stepped up to dispatch the penalty with characteristic precision, doubling Madrid’s lead.\n\nMadrid continued to press with intensity, searching for more goals to ensure an unassailable lead. Their efforts bore fruit once again when another penalty was awarded after a foul on Dani Carvajal. Ronaldo, stepping up for the second time, converted confidently, thereby completing a brace and pushing Real Madrid further into a comfortable lead.\n\nThe second half saw more of the same dominance from Los Blancos. Gareth Bale, who was a constant thorn in the side of the Shakhtar defence, unfortunately, had to be substituted due to a calf injury. His replacement, Mateo Kovačić, seamlessly slotted into the midfield, offering a different dynamic with his energetic runs and precise passing.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo rounded off a spectacular individual performance by completing his hat-trick, benefiting from a rebound off a Marcelo shot which Pyatov failed to control. This goal not only secured the match-ball for Ronaldo but also underlined his predatory instincts inside the penalty box, ensuring Madrid finished the game on a high.\n\nShakhtar, to their credit, continued to play with spirit, seeking a consolation goal, but the Real Madrid defensive line held firm. Raphaël Varane, who had earlier been substituted due to injury concerns, was missed at the back, but Pepe and Nacho filled in admirably, ensuring defensive solidity. Madrid managed the game expertly, retaining possession and reducing the game to a procession in the final stages.\n\nThe victory was crucial for Real Madrid, not only in terms of points but also in setting a marker for their campaign in the Champions League. Their performance displayed a blend of tactical discipline and individual brilliance, hallmarks of any championship-winning side. Rafa Benítez would undoubtedly have been pleased with his side’s performance, considering the high stakes and the quality of opposition.\n\nFor Shakhtar Donetsk, the match was a harsh reminder of the levels required to compete against Europe’s elite. Despite demonstrating technical proficiency and tactical awareness, the gap in quality was evident, especially after being reduced to ten men. However, they showed enough resilience and skill to suggest they would be a tough opponent for any team in the group.\n\nIn summary, Real Madrid 4-0 Shakhtar was not just a scoreline but a statement of intent. The goals from Benzema and a hat-trick from Ronaldo were the highlights in a game where Real Madrid’s defensive organization and midfield control were equally commendable. The injuries to key players like Gareth Bale and Sergio Ramos were unfortunate, but the depth in Madrid's squad ensured that their quality did not drop significantly. This match, with its moments of drama and brilliance, encapsulated the very essence of Champions League football. Real Madrid had indeed set the tone for their European campaign with a performance that was every bit as impressive as the scoreline suggested.\n"
