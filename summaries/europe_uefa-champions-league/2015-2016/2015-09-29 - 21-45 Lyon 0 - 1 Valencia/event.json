    "summary": "In a tightly contested and fervently fought match, Valencia managed to edge out Lyon by a single goal, emerging victorious with a final scoreline of 1-0. The match, held at Lyon's home ground, was replete with moments of high tension, tactical fouling, and missed opportunities, reflecting the combative spirit both teams brought to the fore.\n\nThe first half began with Valencia taking the kick-off. Within the first minute, the ball was out of play, a precursor to the numerous stoppages that would mark the game. Lyon quickly gained possession, executing a throw-in at the 1:00 mark. The pace of the game was rapid, with both sides striving to establish dominance early on.\n\nValencia's aggressive approach led to the first foul of the game by Lyon at the 3:44 mark. The throw-ins and frequent stoppages continued as both teams struggled to maintain clean possession. By the 7:07 minute mark, Lyon had committed their first foul, and the see-saw battle in the midfield was evident.\n\nValencia capitalized on a direct free-kick awarded in the 8th minute, resulting in their first corner at the 8:31 mark. However, they squandered the opportunity, resulting in a shot off target. This pattern of missed chances would become a recurring theme for both teams throughout the match. Lyon's defense managed to clear the ball effectively, but continued infringement led to frequent interruptions.\n\nBy the 14th minute, Valencia was caught offside, giving Lyon an indirect free-kick, which led to subsequent fouling by Valencia. This turnover almost proved fruitful for Lyon, who managed a shot off target in the 15th minute following a short passage of play. Despite their efforts, Valencia's defense remained resolute, clearing the threat once again.\n\nThe match continued its physical trend with fouls and throw-ins disrupting the rhythm. A significant moment came in the 26th minute when Lyon earned a direct free-kick, resulting in a shot on target. The ensuing corner for Lyon, taken at 26:55, saw multiple attempts to penetrate Valencia's backline, but they eventually squandered another corner opportunity at the 27:22 mark.\n\nThe first half saw another brief period of sustained pressure from Lyon between the 30th and 35th minutes. They managed a shot off target at the 30:52 mark, and again after a short spell in Valencia's half. The relentless pressure saw Lyon earning another corner and multiple throw-ins, though they failed to convert these into tangible chances.\n\nWith the excitement gradually plateauing, Valencia managed a series of counter-offensives, resulting in shots off target in the 34th and 39th minutes. Just before the halftime whistle, an incredible sequence of events unfolded. Valencia mounted an offensive play culminating in a decisive shot on target at the 41:27 mark, resulting in the only goal of the match. This crucial goal shifted the momentum significantly towards Valencia. Their execution and finishing stood in stark contrast to Lyon’s earlier lackluster attempts, and the visiting side was visibly buoyed by their lead.\n\nThe first half ended with Lyon trying to regain control, evidenced by the substitution at the 44:03 mark. Despite their efforts, they couldn’t claw back into the game before the halftime whistle. The halftime score stood at Lyon 0-1 Valencia.\n\nThe second half began with Lyon taking the initiative from the kick-off. Determined to overturn their deficit, Lyon maintained pressure, creating a shot on target in the very first minute. The subsequent corner at the 2:02 mark once again embodied Lyon's offensive persistence, but this effort too went off target. Multiple attempts in the 3rd minute and again in the early stages of the half saw Lyon struggling to find the net as Valencia's defense held firm.\n\nValencia's tactical fouling saw them conceding free-kicks intermittently. At the 6:12 mark, Valencia's aggressive play earned them a yellow card, a reflection of the rising intensity and their efforts to disrupt Lyon's rhythm. Lyon's direct free-kick following this infringement saw another missed opportunity, as shots went off target at the 7:35 mark.\n\nThe competitive spirit of the game remained undiminished. Valencia managed to clear a dangerous ball in the 8th minute, but Lyon continued applying pressure. Despite this, no significant chances materialized from their multiple throw-ins and corners. The game’s rough-and-tumble nature saw another yellow card in the 15th minute, this time for Lyon, further underlining the match's rough edge.\n\nAs the match progressed into the mid-second half, both teams employed substitutions to bring fresh legs into the fray. Valencia, making a smart tactical substitution at the 13:51 mark, sought to defend their slender lead. The constant fouling and resulting free-kicks from both sides reflected the tense atmosphere as the match remained on a knife-edge.\n\nLyon, despite continuing to accrue shots off target and creating occasional shots on target, failed to breach Valencia's stout defense. By the 20th minute of the second half, the home side’s frustration became quite visible. The attempts were there, demonstrated by Lyon's persistent advances and another yellow card for Valencia at the 17:03 mark.\n\nThe closing stages of the game saw incessant efforts by Lyon to find an equalizer. There were significant flurries of activity in the final third, punctuated by corners and fouls from Valencia, who were content to defend their lead at all costs. Lyon brought on fresh substitutes around the 28th minute, aiming to inject new energy into their side, yet Valencia’s adept game management stymied Lyon's attacking impetus.\n\nLyon's sustained pressure, characterized by frequent attempts such as those seen at the 37:45 and 41:36 marks, resulted in several shots off target and on target. Despite chance after chance, including multiple corners in quick succession, Valencia's disciplined defense and remarkable goalkeeping maintained their clean sheet.\n\nThe dramatic nature of the game was highlighted further by a yellow card for Valencia right on the 45-minute mark of the second half, illustrating their strategic fouling to break up Lyon's rhythm as the clock wound down. The final minutes saw a frenetic pace, with Lyon launching one final offensive charge. Corners at the 46:03 and 46:21 marks showcased their determination, though each effort was met with resilient Valencia clearances.\n\nDespite Lyon's valiant efforts throughout the second half, the match concluded with Valencia maintaining their slender yet crucial lead. The final whistle blew, ending a game marked by aggressive play, numerous fouls, tactical substitutions, and defensive resilience by Valencia. In a game where missed chances and industrious defending defined the outcome, Valencia's lone goal in the first half proved to be the decisive factor, sealing their victory and leaving Lyon rueing their missed opportunities. The match stood as an exemplar of narrow margins in football, where one moment's quality can decisively shape the result."
