threat from set pieces\n22:2 Comment: The Turk put it by removing a suitcase from above\n22:4 Comment: If necessary\n22:6 Comment: Bayer Leverkusen scores\n22:9 Comment: by Roger Smith, the German team advances, Barça 0, Bayern Reverkusen 1.\n22:16 Comment: Saljahnoglu's set piece, he puts it well.\n22:19 Comment: And the first stick beats Mathieu, who doesn't jump.\n22:24 Comment: And Ter Stegen is in the middle zone of the goal and has no option.\n22:28 Comment: Saljahnoglu is a great hit.\n22:32 Comment: Very tight, the corner kick.\n22:36 Comment: And then Mathieu has the disadvantage along with Busquets, who acts as the first post.\n22:40 Comment: You get that interlace there.\n22:42 Comment: There he is telling you, he says that you have to take it because if not, two or three steps will come and it will be easy.\n22:48 Comment: But the center is great.\n22:50 Comment: When it falls in the middle it hurts you a lot.\n22:53 Comment: And as you say, wolf, it does a lot of damage because it is very well placed there.\n22:56 Comment: And with power.\n22:58 Comment: That must always be reflected.\n23:0 Comment: I didn't see a soft center, which gives you time to move and even activate.\n23:4 Comment: That is stressful and that it comes quickly.\n23:6 Comment: As now I wanted to score that ball for Chicharito, Bayern Leverkusen.\n23:9 Comment:  We'll see.\n23:10 Comment: I complained about that. Let's see how Barça reacts.\n23:12 Comment: No, how is Leverkusen?\n23:14 Comment: If he sniffs.\n23:15 Comment: Sorry, Susana, something there.\n23:17 Comment: No, no, what Piqué applauded for Barça's defense, well, for the team in general.\n23:22 Comment:  Let's see.\n23:23 Comment: Eye, eye, eye, up.\n23:25 Comment: And now the Barça footballer says Atkinson that there is nothing.\n23:29 Comment: It is very difficult for Atkinson to enter into these questions.\n23:34 Comment: It's very English school, Rafa.\n23:36 Comment: Absolutely, he lets us play a lot and he's also at the end of his career.\n23:40 Comment: He has a lot of experience. He seems like a great referee to me.\n23:44 Comment: He is going to be a referee who is not the type of match for one or the other.\n23:47 Comment: When it's fire, let's say, a little more to the limit.\n23:51 Comment: Not transferring the claim.\n23:54 Comment: You don't bet on calling too many fouls, right, Rafa?\n23:57 Comment: Correct. That's Martin Atkinson's refereeing.\n24:1 Comment: There he plays the ball, open the back to see Narvi how well Daniel has stolen it.\n24:4 Comment: He plays for Piqué, as Susana said, the one who encouraged the defense with applause.\n24:7 Comment: Now Luis Enrique is doing it too so they don't collapse.\n24:10 Comment: But his face already showed concern because of how many times Bayern was reaching Ter Stegen well.\n24:16 Comment: It's coming to the hairdo, be careful.\n24:18 Comment: Offside.\n24:19 Comment: We were watching the replay of the hit from Saljanoglu's position on the monitor.\n24:23 Comment:  Incredible.\n24:24 Comment: He hits him with a screw that if it doesn't touch his back,\n24:27 Comment: It's an Olympic goal.\n24:28 Comment: And the truth is that it makes her so tense, so strong, that type of ball,\n24:32 Comment: If it is touched by both an attacker and a defender, it is poisonous for the goalkeeper.\n24:36 Comment: I think that there the players who were on the near post mark,\n24:40 Comment: They have to fight to win that ball.\n24:42 Comment: It's a mistake, but maybe, as Marcos says, seeing how that center is doing, it's just a mess.\n24:48 Comment:  That's the truth.\n24:49 Comment: And if Matié doesn't forcefully take it to the near post, it will be difficult for...\n24:52 Comment: The brown one is the one that has been falling apart.\n24:54 Comment: If Matié doesn't forcefully take it to the near post, it will be difficult for...\n24:57 Comment: The brown one now for Donati, who seems to have hurt himself.\n24:59 Comment: And let's see if he can continue, because the gestures are serious, of pain in the left ankle.\n25:5 Comment: Yes, he takes his hand, as Guas says, to the boot.\n25:8 Comment: At the moment the Italian joins Roger Smith's side.\n25:13 Comment: And you let Pintos continue for that reason, right?\n25:16 Comment:  Yeah.\n25:17 Comment: Ball for Piqué.\n25:19 Comment: Piqué plays backwards, Berarabi comes to pressure him, Baratérez Teguen delays.\n25:23 Comment: Play for Mascherano.\n25:25 Comment: Around with the goals conceded, it's a set piece.\n25:30 Comment: Piqué is coming, there are minutes left and a lot of game ahead.\n25:33 Comment: This is the Champions League, on antenna 3.\n25:36 Comment: Resteguén plays the ball, ball to the left for Mascherano.\n25:40 Comment: The little boss plays, for now he's looking for the cock, it seems like Rakitic.\n25:43 Comment: But Barça is expanding too much, it doesn't try.\n25:45 Comment: Separating there, Matié winning on the side.\n25:48 Comment: It comes out on the wing.\n25:50 Comment: Now Neymar is coming inside to connect.\n25:54 Comment: Let's see what he has to do.\n25:56 Comment: Move the ball, move the ball until the ball reaches three quarters of the field.\n26:0 Comment: And there you do have to change the pace, accelerate.\n26:3 Comment: Maybe that's the best area to divide Bayer Leverkusen's defense.\n26:7 Comment: The distance between the defense and the average.\n26:10 Comment: Because the average is going to press forward, take that step.\n26:13 Comment: And there opens a gap that either Iniesta or Rakitic has to take advantage of.\n26:17 Comment: Or Neymar coming from the outside in.\n26:20 Comment: The only problem is that Luis Suárez cannot stretch Pappado Poblos.\n26:24 Comment: The centre-backs are trying to get closer to their centre-halves.\n26:29 Comment: It's like in a trap, in a clamp.\n26:31 Comment: Right now, yes, he's like caged.\n26:34 Comment: We already know that caging him is very difficult because he moves from one place to another.\n26:37 Comment: And let's see if it has any advantages.\n26:40 Comment: Look how he comes to get the ball now.\n26:42 Comment: In case one of the footballers like Piqué or Busquets gave it to him.\n26:45 Comment: As Lobo Carrasco says, play the ball on the balcony of the Ter Stegen area.\n26:48 Comment: Ball for Piqué.\n26:49 Comment: Piqué wants to go out with the ball under control for the moment.\n26:51 Comment: Hold on, throw that low pass now for Rakitic.\n26:53 Comment: In the central circle, the Croatian dominates, he puts it on top.\n26:56 Comment: Come up Mathieu, he can get Donati into trouble now.\n26:58 Comment: Mathieu is coming, hold on, Campbell's help is coming too.\n27:1 Comment: Everyone helps there Marcos, Campbell recovers.\n27:3 Comment: Well, Campbell helps a constant, very good.\n27:7 Comment: Ball for Iniesta, she's good, Iniesta is coming.\n27:9 Comment: He read it to you.\n27:10 Comment: Bayern Leverkusen short, the counter comes out, it's Aljanoglu.\n27:12 Comment: Ball for Belarabi.\n27:13 Comment: Belarabi has Chicharito up, the Mexican is going to receive.\n27:15 Comment: Chicharito highway, he's alone, it's Aljanoglu.\n27:18 Comment: Iniesta.\n27:20 Comment: Very well, be careful, they ask for the ball outside.\n27:23 Comment: They both collided.\n27:24 Comment: Yes, a shock.\n27:25 Comment: And they are both lying down, Guas.\n27:28 Comment: The medical service requests the assistance, the referee.\n27:33 Comment: Both those from Bayern and those from Barça come out.\n27:37 Comment:  We'll see.\n27:38 Comment: And this, Rafa Guerrero, is what the regulations say.\n27:41 Comment: When there is a blow to the head and both fall, the assists must be authorized immediately and the game must be stopped.\n27:45 Comment: Indeed, because no one is harmed because the assistance comes in and the field is taken care of.\n27:50 Comment: Because it's one from each team.\n27:51 Comment: Very well seen, Esteban.\n27:55 Comment: Well, for now Bayern Munich 4, Dinamo Zagreb 0.\n27:58 Comment: In addition to Sepad and Borisov 2, Rome 0.\n28:1 Comment: You know, then all the summaries.\n28:3 Comment: Everything follows the Champions League.\n28:5 Comment: The companions.\n28:8 Comment: And meanwhile, Guas is receiving instructions from Luis Enrique.\n28:11 Comment: Gerard Piqué crossed the entire field to go talk to Luis Enrique.\n28:15 Comment: Let's see how the game can be fixed in these last minutes of the first half.\n28:18 Comment: And by the way, he must also be worried seeing the match and the result.\n28:22 Comment: Leo Messi, who has come here, although they have told him to rest for four or five days.\n28:26 Comment: Well, he should be with his leg up, but in the locker room.\n28:28 Comment: I think that in order not to create too much, you can't do anything.\n28:30 Comment: He stayed there.\n28:31 Comment: Forgive me, but it reminded me of César Configo.\n28:33 Comment: That clash of the two Mascherano arriving with Belarabi.\n28:36 Comment: A lot of damage could have been done by either of the two, but it seems that the most damaged is Mascherano.\n28:40 Comment: Wolf, Marcos.\n28:41 Comment: Let's see how he recovers.\n28:43 Comment: His legs are trapped.\n28:44 Comment: It's turned yellow now, hasn't it?\n28:46 Comment: Yes, there it has a lot of influence if you wear an aluminum block, which I suppose they have made a mix.\n28:51 Comment: Maybe sometime.\n28:52 Comment: Well, we already know that the Champions League team, which is the one that has done the most damage.\n28:55 Comment: Let's see if the impact can overcome it.\n28:57 Comment: Because it stays more stuck in the grass.\n28:59 Comment: Yes, because if he contacts.\n29:1 Comment: Look, the ball comes so touched, so strong, with so much power that it is very difficult to make a decision in a game.\n29:8 Comment: What were you telling me, Guas, yellow?\n29:9 Comment: You two come in now.\n29:11 Comment: They had already left, to be attended to, they have both already entered.\n29:15 Comment: 11 against 11, as our partner says.\n29:17 Comment: Play the ball up.\n29:18 Comment: Ball for Mascherano.\n29:19 Comment: Let's see, the ball behind is being tested for Ter Stegen at the moment.\n29:21 Comment: Control with your thigh.\n29:22 Comment: This certainly makes the German a fable.\n29:25 Comment: Play for Piqué.\n29:27 Comment: Barça has to manage with Ter Stegen to divide Bayer Leverkusen from the first pressure.\n29:33 Comment: There are two strikers, three Barça players.\n29:35 Comment: Let's see if the field comes, because if not they are very comfortable at the moment, both Chicharito and Belarabi, covering the two center backs.\n29:41 Comment: And they are very on the edge themselves.\n29:42 Comment: Yes, and they have not realized that the Champions League team, which is the one that has damaged the most.\n29:47 Comment: And they are very on the limit, I insist, both one team and the other.\n29:50 Comment: When they release the ball, they rush the arrival of the man who is pressing too much.\n29:55 Comment: As long as they are imprecise in that type of centers, or they do not give it the necessary speed, as the Wolf says.\n30:0 Comment: There comes the error.\n30:2 Comment: It almost happened to Piqué now.\n30:5 Comment: Play the ball to Mascherano.\n30:6 Comment: He tells Piqué to go back to look for that space now and clarify the play.\n30:10 Comment: Ball again from Piqué for Ter Stegen.\n30:12 Comment: Another one to play back there.\n30:13 Comment: He's on the left and he's going to receive the ball.\n30:15 Comment: Barça playing now.\n30:17 Comment: He has to put the ball higher.\n30:19 Comment: He does it for Neymar.\n30:20 Comment: Neymar is coming to receive.\n30:21 Comment: Look at the position.\n30:22 Comment: There are four more.\n30:23 Comment: Take Bayer Leverkusen back.\n30:24 Comment: It comes out from inside Bender.\n30:25 Comment: Belarabi is not coming.\n30:26 Comment:  Busquets recovers the ball.\n30:27 Comment: He plays for Iniesta.\n30:28 Comment: He has Rakitic ahead of him.\n30:29 Comment: He's going to play higher and above.\n30:30 Comment: Now for Dani Alves.\n30:31 Comment: Control.\n30:32 Comment: It's going long.\n30:33 Comment: The Brazilian holds on.\n30:34 Comment: Face the Brazilian.\n30:35 Comment: And the Avigon comes inside.\n30:36 Comment: Bayer Leverkusen had to rectify it again back there.\n30:39 Comment: Kramer.\n30:40 Comment: Iniesta regains control.\n30:41 Comment:  Hold.\n30:42 Comment: He lifts the leather.\n30:43 Comment: What a ball.\n30:44 Comment: What a ball for Sandro.\n30:45 Comment: There is no offside.\n30:46 Comment: Sandro wants to put it on.\n30:47 Comment: Hold on Sandro.\n30:48 Comment:  Bottom line.\n30:49 Comment: The wire is coming.\n30:50 Comment: Tread.\n30:51 Comment: Drag.\n30:52 Comment: He wants to put the ball.\n30:53 Comment:  Keep dancing.\n30:54 Comment: You get two.\n30:55 Comment: Lock up.\n30:56 Comment: He lost the ball.\n30:57 Comment: Sandro suffers there.\n30:58 Comment: He doesn't have that one for one as an extreme player.\n30:59 Comment: Maybe on the left being direct and going inwards well, but on the right it suffers\n31:1 Comment: in that one for one.\n31:2 Comment: And what a resource for the genius Saljanoglu to get that ball off his back.\n31:5 Comment: He almost fell and almost created a problem.\n31:7 Comment: Then for Iniesta.\n31:9 Comment: The animal ball.\n31:10 Comment: Iniesta came years ago, but he continues the game by game.\n31:11 Comment: Yours mine.\n31:12 Comment: Let's see who wins it.\n31:13 Comment: Belarabi comes out again.\n31:14 Comment: It's him against the wall.\n31:15 Comment: Belarabi is coming.\n31:16 Comment:  The first.\n31:17 Comment: Very good Piqué maintaining the position, delaying, why force him to do this, just because\n31:23 Comment: He looks for it and dribbles it with enormous ease.\n31:26 Comment: There is a key to why Bayern Leverkusen always counterattacks.\n31:30 Comment: It's just that his two centre-halfs, Kramer, Wender, especially Wender, 90% of their passes are\n31:35 Comment:  forward.\n31:37 Comment: And that speaks of a player who, as he recovers, moves forward without remission.\n31:41 Comment: Gabi is very fast.\n31:43 Comment:  Very fast.\n31:44 Comment: It is not strange that he is a starter for Germany.\n31:46 Comment: Almost always in the qualifying phase it has been.\n31:48 Comment:  That is.\n31:49 Comment: Behind the wall.\n31:50 Comment: Unless the Belarabi is there.\n31:51 Comment: On the FC Barcelona bench, how much fuel can the footballers hold on to?\n31:55 Comment: Bayern Leverkusen.\n31:56 Comment: There is another line.\n31:57 Comment: By the way, my teammate Rafa Zobadero tells me that he just scored the third, the bat to the\n32:2 Comment: Rome.\n32:3 Comment: Yes, I came with many casualties to play the game and I'm sure they took advantage of that psychological advantage\n32:7 Comment: and on the field of play with the first goal.\n32:10 Comment: There's Daniel Alves.\n32:12 Comment: To be executed, but for now it has to wait for assistance to attend to the German footballer\n32:16 Comment: fallen near the front of the area.\n32:19 Comment: Leno, I'm going to tell you something Antonio, he plays as advanced as Ter Stegen.\n32:23 Comment: Yes, yes, it's Neuer school.\n32:25 Comment: The ball is in midfield, for example, circulating.\n32:28 Comment: The four of them shrink, close, that is, they go a little to join the midfielders\n32:33 Comment: and he is on the moon, on the crescent, sorry, of the large area.\n32:36 Comment: So if Barcelona is able to see, what happens is that there is no kicker to\n32:40 Comment: Take the shot from 50 meters and above all delay it.\n32:47 Comment: Well, here it goes...\n32:48 Comment: Javier Wendel from the pitch whistles to the Camp Nou fans so they don't get lost\n32:52 Comment:  so long.\n32:53 Comment: Of course, right now they're against you.\n32:55 Comment: Bayer Leverkusen's Brazilian full-back came out, ball in play, ball for Iniesta, play\n33:0 Comment: In three quarters of the field, ball behind for Mascherano.\n33:2 Comment: We have already passed the ball to Iniesta, he recovers it in his own half and crosses the boundary.\n33:7 Comment: It's in the Bayer Leverkusen field that is beginning to retreat.\n33:9 Comment: The minutes begin to pass.\n33:10 Comment: 34 of the first half live at the Camp Nou.\n33:13 Comment: This is the Champions League.\n33:14 Comment: Play the ball for the champion, Iniesta comes for Rakitic.\n33:18 Comment: There Wendel crossed paths.\n33:20 Comment: Clear Saljanoglu.\n33:21 Comment: The ball goes to Matié's back.\n33:23 Comment: Control your head directly there for Neymar.\n33:25 Comment: He puts it in front of Donati.\n33:26 Comment: Neymar is not arriving.\n33:29 Comment: Yeah, yeah, the couples part isn't working.\n33:31 Comment: Alves and Sandro are not having the harmony they want because Sandro has static\n33:35 Comment: Haggling problems.\n33:37 Comment: Not the same as when it is launched, because there it is a locomotive.\n33:40 Comment: And then, Neymar and Matié at the moment are not finding two-on-one advantages.\n33:45 Comment: Bayer Leverkusen wants to play that two against two now, ball for Rakitic.\n33:48 Comment:

you seen it?\n36:30 Comment: Have you taken it?\n36:31 Comment: Yes, it is very well located.\n36:32 Comment: Neymar accepts it well.\n36:33 Comment: Because Neymar opens both legs at the same time to try to make contact.\n36:37 Comment: That's what I saw in a first image as Atkinson could see.\n36:42 Comment:  That is.\n36:43 Comment: Spread one leg on each side, then you have to contact.\n36:46 Comment: But it's not a penalty.\n36:48 Comment: Very good referee.\n36:49 Comment: Yes, he does the one-two and then provokes that situation.\n36:52 Comment:  Correct.\n36:53 Comment: And this is the

quick action at that moment because it was so close.\n37:6 Comment: They were reflections there.\n37:8 Comment: Now receive.\n37:9 Comment: The value of stopping is also to stay strong.\n37:11 Comment: And not fall to one side.\n37:12 Comment:  That is.\n37:13 Comment: Don't get knocked down.\n37:15 Comment: Well, with this play in the Bayer Leverkusen area now.\n37:20 Comment: The previous

enormous ease.\n38:0 Comment: And it is because it brings together many players close to the ball.\n38:4 Comment: Careful with this one first.\n38:5 Comment: He's coming to see Neymar now.\n38:6

catch everything against him.\n38:36 Comment:  That is.\n38:37 Comment: I think he's looking for the wrong way.\n38:38 Comment: What happens is that football also has that point of fortune, not fortune.\n38:43 Comment: And they get it right there.\n38:44 Comment: Rakitic.\n38:45 Comment: Penalty point.\n38:46 Comment: The hanging ball from the corner kick.\n38:47 Comment: He stuck his head

the Ottoman advances.\n38:59 Comment: He can shoot.\n39:0 Comment: My mother.\n39:1 Comment:  Yes Yes Yes.\n39:2 Comment: You could see that he had the desire to unleash his big shot.\n39:5 Comment: Fortunately it went over the crossbar.\n39:8 Comment: But notice, or notice, rather, how few options Bayer Leverkusen gives against the counter.\n39:15 Comment: They finish them all.\n39:16 Comment: It goes with the whole clock, of course.\n39:18 Comment: There you can think, would I have another pass?\n39:20 Comment: Could you look for another move?\n39:21 Comment:  No.\n39:22 Comment: End the play.\n39:23 Comment: Barça starts again against eleven behind Balón.\n39:25 Comment: Loporto leads Chelsea 2-0.\n39:29 Comment: Then you know the summary in mega.\n39:31 Comment: All the summaries,

Football Club.\n39:40 Comment: Today, a very extensive summary of the Lyon-Valencia Olympics, which remains 0-0.\n39:46 Comment: Holding on to Nuno Espíritu's team also in France.\n39:48 Comment: Play the ball there for Mathieu.\n39:50 Comment: Mathieu starts at Bayer Leverkusen.\n39:52 Comment: We already promised intensity and we are having it.\n39:54 Comment: Here comes Neymar between the two.\n39:56 Comment: The guide is coming.\n39:57 Comment: Now it's a foul call, right?\n39:59 Comment: Yes, and cardboard.\n40:1 Comment: Yes, yellow cardboard.\n40:3 Comment: Very good Atkinson.\n40:6 Comment: For Bender, right?\n40:7 Comment:  Indeed.\n40:8 Comment: Looks like it's for Bender in the end.\n40:11 Comment: Barça needs one for one of Neymar.\n40:14 Comment: Well, the first for Bayer Leverkusen.\n40:16 Comment: You already saw it, Mascherano and Neymar.\n40:20 Comment: According to the official data from UEFA, from the Champions League, they also tell us.\n40:26 Comment: And it's clear, Rafa, because it's going away.\n40:27 Comment: It is very clear and also comes from an advantage that it has given.\n40:31 Comment: Referee Atkinson is, frankly, fine.\n40:35 Comment: At the moment he is getting it right.\n40:36 Comment: Palms.\n40:37 Comment: Watch out for Rakiti.\n40:39 Comment: One who is well and retires.\n40:42 Comment: Well, Messi is not there, but Neymar is there.\n40:44 Comment: And Rakiti, as Wolf says.\n40:46 Comment: Let's see whose fault it is.\n40:48 Comment: The Croatian's thread or the Brazilian's three-fingered shot.\n40:54 Comment:  We'll see.\n40:56 Comment: There, far away. Rakiti is coming.\n40:58 Comment: Leno.\n40:59 Comment: He saw her, he saw her.\n41:0 Comment: Yeah, yeah, it came out early and everything.\n41:2 Comment: Notice that it is, as I told you, impeccable so far in this first part.\n41:5 Comment: Bayer Leverkusen's scouting, Marcos, is impeccable.\n41:8 Comment: Well, I think he has the game very prepared,\n41:11 Comment: But above all what they are achieving is taking it at their own pace.\n41:13 Comment: That's why I say.\n41:14 Comment: Barça is trying to take the game at its own pace.\n41:17 Comment: With the position he is achieving it, 64%.\n41:19 Comment:  Careful.\n41:20 Comment: Be careful, Luis Suárez fell up there.\n41:22 Comment: Now paint the mistake.\n41:23 Comment: Charúa demands another eligible card from him.\n41:29 Comment: And the Camp Nou asks for it, Susana.\n41:32 Comment: Yes, the Camp Nou is starting to get tired of the continuous fouls, but it's not going to get rid of it.\n41:37 Comment: The ball has already been put in play.\n41:38 Comment: Encourage the smartest, the one who puts himself before anyone else.\n41:40 Comment: Ball for Daidei, Alves, Alves for Sandro.\n41:42 Comment: Down he threw himself.\n41:43 Comment: Bender cutting well back there, helping the side.\n41:46 Comment: The ball has come out.\n41:47 Comment: Ball for Barça on the wing.\n41:50 Comment: 42 match.\n41:51 Comment: Countdown, three left until halftime.\n41:54 Comment: Camp Nou, Barça zero, Bayer Leverkusen one.\n41:57 Comment: Well, Barça is dominating possession at the moment.\n42:0 Comment: However, I believe that in attack, in the opposite field, it needs greater participation from the full-backs,\n42:5 Comment: One for one for Neymar and for some footballer to appear between the lines,\n42:9 Comment: which is his main quality to divide the defense of a Bayer Leverkusen that is taking the game at its own pace.\n42:14 Comment: If you were Luis Enrique Lobo for the break.\n42:18 Comment: Let's see because the bench has seen that we don't have many chances,\n42:21 Comment: But for now I would emphasize that the players are doing things well.\n42:25 Comment: What happens is that at the moment FC Barcelona cannot tie Bayern,\n42:29 Comment: especially when he has the ball, the team.\n42:31 Comment: That's where we have to improve a lot.\n42:32 Comment: There's Neymar, Neymar puts the acceleration at the near post there.\n42:37 Comment: He stopped right almost at the baseline, now he rejected the Bayer Leverkusen defense.\n42:40 Comment: Also Mathieu, ball for the Germans.\n42:43 Comment: You know Marcos well, your time in Roma.\n42:46 Comment: There must be too many things going through his head.\n42:49 Comment: Well, I think he's looking for ways to help his team in the technical talk at half-time.\n42:56 Comment: I think that from a control of possession, that Barça is clear,\n43:0 Comment: Right now it is 64% and there is participation and play by Barça in the opposite field,\n43:5 Comment: They have to find the spaces.\n43:7 Comment: And I told you, greater participation from the sides.\n43:9 Comment: We are seeing that Neymar and Mathieu and on the left wing there is a greater presence,\n43:13 Comment: but also the game between the lines that is not appearing.\n43:15 Comment: And be careful that Feguli is ahead, Olympique de Lyon 0-1 Valencia.\n43:20 Comment: Feguli's goal also on the stroke of half-time.\n43:23 Comment: There, Susana, the fans were also protesting about the loss of time in Bayer Leverkusen's serve.\n43:27 Comment: Yes, for the serve, also for when there is an ugly tackle that is on the grass for too long, anyway.\n43:36 Comment: But it is true that the Barça bench is very fair.\n43:39 Comment: There is Masip, there is Douglas, Bartram, Munir, Jordi Alba, Sergi Roberto and Gumbau.\n43:44 Comment: We have to hurry more time and secondly Barcelona without the ball.\n43:49 Comment: At the moment they have much more control over the match, despite Barcelona's higher position, as we are saying, Bayer Leverkusen.\n43:57 Comment: Because every attack... Now I tell you, Bayer Leverkusen has practically reached the area ten times.\n44:3 Comment: That is something impossible to want to dominate and manage the statistics of a game.\n44:9 Comment: Of course, it's one thing to have possession, one thing to be ahead on the scoreboard and another thing to govern the game.\n44:14 Comment: Piqué wants to play there. Piqué up top, puts the ball in for Matié. Donati cuts the ball there.\n44:19 Comment: Donati puts it up, which is what Lobo asks of his team from Barça. Ball there for Kampl.\n44:23 Comment: Kampl holds on, Matié comes to him. The Slovenian turns, holds on with the ball, close to the boot.\n44:27 Comment: Now the little guy sneaks inside in front of Iniesta, what a ball put up.\n44:30 Comment: The defective one. The intention was good, he applauds, that's why the chicharito, Ter Stegen takes it. Ball for Piqué.\n44:36 Comment: Piqué, he wants to play it for Dani Alves. Camnobo in silence, Alves plays.\n44:41 Comment: Alves again for Rakitic, offload for Piqué, controls with his thigh.\n44:44 Comment: They are going to look for the play, the wingers open up, Sandro opens up, and so does Neymar.\n44:48 Comment: Further to the left, now Luis Suárez is coming in as the reference at the top.\n44:51 Comment: Even in a theoretical offside position and then leaving.\n44:55 Comment: And now start the play. Matié is not going to arrive. This is saying goodbye.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: It has arrived, that must be corrected if we want to tie and then dream of coming back. He started the\n0:5 Comment: second half on Antena 3. Ball and live, ball for Mathieu, play for Mascherano,\n0:9 Comment: Mascherano delays, plays horizontally rather for Gerard Piqué, Kuskets is coming,\n0:13 Comment: Like Cen, he has the air of confidence to play the triangulation of the pressure of two footballers\n0:18 Comment: Up top, they are going very, very hard, as Marcos said before the high pressure in the opponent's field,\n0:24 Comment: Something that Luis Enrique's Barça is also very good at, he did at the Calderón,\n0:27 Comment: We also discussed it with Manu Sánchez at half-time in the game, let's see what\n0:31 Comment: Barça responds, it comes up, the ball goes to Sandro, it doesn't arrive, Leno anticipates, Leno anticipates.\n0:37 Comment: It was good, it was good intention and it happened and the truth is that he couldn't control it, let's see if it works out\n0:42 Comment: pressure from Barcelona and forces the German team to make mistakes because they feel very comfortable,\n0:48 Comment: Not only because of the score but because he was able to set up, prepare and make, carry out the script\n0:55 Comment: of what he had taught. Play the ball to Barça, ball up, it comes there for Luis Suárez,\n0:58 Comment: He complains to Manu, Luis Suárez de Tag, who comes out with the ball under control, got stuck in a drempelín,\n1:2 Comment: But it holds there, the 19-year-old German centre-back takes it there, plays the ball to the right,\n1:8 Comment: We will see the play if we then have Reppe to be able to resolve the ball for Iniesta,\n1:12 Comment: Iniesta up again for Sandro, cuts the ball on the right Donati, ball up,\n1:15 Comment: He wanted to control Chicharito, Kuskets anticipates, now clearly hooked by him\n1:20 Comment: German footballer and there is a foul in favor of Barça. We have to see if Barça is capable of improving\n1:28 Comment: That pressure after losing to suffocate Bayer Leverkusen. Rafa Guerrero. Well yes, for me\n1:34 Comment: he intercepts the ball between his side and his arm, preventing it from passing, he was able to signal the foul by\n1:39 Comment: edge of the area. Play the ball, there is Mathieu, Mathieu comes to close Campbell, helping\n1:46 Comment: Later, plays inside, Barça doesn't get the ball back, Iniesta touches it now but just barely\n1:51 Comment: Time, Belarabi, hold the ball, Bacherano is coming and wants to delay, making him lose this Marcos.\n1:55 Comment: I think Luis Enrique's distribution is already tending towards two points, Luis Suárez, Sandro, Neymar\n2:2 Comment: Between the lines, it is what we had commented in the previous one, the triangle there to try to divide\n2:6 Comment: Two lines and we are seeing how Mathieu is already assuming that role as a winger. Be careful, in this distribution\n2:13 Comment: Barça cannot lose the ball because if not, they are very exposed on the counterattack.\n2:17 Comment: In addition, what the center has is a rhombus now, he lowered the ball up, there appears Belarabi, the ball leaves him again\n2:22 Comment: Go, perfect, Papacy Paulus. Yes, he knows how to use his arms because you have to know how to play with that and the\n2:29 Comment: The truth is that he gave the prohibition signal to Sandro who was fighting to hit the ball.\n2:35 Comment: That position of Neymar now Marcos is the one we also give to Rafinha, and we wish him one\n2:41 Comment: prompt recovery and hope that the knee injury you sustained returns in the best possible way\n2:46 Comment: Nainggolan in the Rome Olympic. That position behind the two forwards. Yes, it's the first\n2:51 Comment: Distribution of Luis Enrique's Barça is the Luis Enrique system, two forwards, a 10 behind,\n2:56 Comment: If someone takes videos and sees the first months of Luis Enrique until Noeta, they will always see two\n3:3 Comment: pointers and Messi behind the two forwards, looking for that interior triangle so that\n3:8 Comment: The full-backs are capable of unbalancing from the outside. They are trying to clone that way of\n3:14 Comment: To think what he has to try to gain superiority inside and look for the two center midfielders\n3:20 Comment: Bayern, instead of defending forward, defend backwards. Let there be some means for them and the\n3:24 Comment: Defense. But there is Neymar in that corridor that is in that clearing. They see him clearly there and now he is coming to receive.\n3:30 Comment: That's it, then why? Because the four defenders, I insist again, are doing a\n3:35 Comment: Perfect synchronized movement. Let's see if he is able to surprise and, above all, put a\n3:40 Comment: There is little fear in Barça's defensive line. There is one thing in this arrangement. Neymar has to be\n3:45 Comment: Aware that if he receives he cannot lose the ball. Messi guarantees that because there is\n3:51 Comment: I also see that Mati and Alves are very high right now and a loss leaves the three defenders\n3:57 Comment: Barça against those who arrive and we see that Bayern searches for them and arrives with many. Be careful Cambrou.\n4:1 Comment: The Cambrou begins to whistle Susana. Sound of wind. Machanolo plays because he sees that his team touches the ball behind calmly.\n4:8 Comment: Ball up for Luis Suárez. Impatience begins. Donati crosses him. In those half fouls he falls, charges.\n4:14 Comment: Who knows. That's where Campbell plays the ball. Campbell holds on. Mati comes to him. Campbell's great. He played inside.\n4:19 Comment: Ball for Werner. Kramer wanted to play up front. Mati recovers. The former government is on top again. Belarabi is coming.\n4:25 Comment: Belarabi is now looking closely to see who is there. He is going to give it to Chicharito. The one Bayern Leverkusen had.\n4:31 Comment: It goes from behind. Yes, but it was also presented to him from behind and he couldn't put his foot down properly because the ball was already left with his finishing leg.\n4:41 Comment: This is what we said about Esteban's losses. Right now in this system, possession of the ball, conservation of the ball until playing between the lines\n4:49 Comment: It has to be very clear because if Barça loses it is very exposed at the back.\n4:52 Comment: Barça is upping the ante. Bayern Leverkusen is holding on, on the verge of giving them another blow on the scoreboard.\n4:57 Comment: Rakitic recovers. There is one more to touch than Neymar but he doesn't quite reach it. Silo to Ziniesta. He narrowly saves the ball for Barça.\n5:3 Comment: 66% possession in the first half. 44 for Bayern Leverkusen. Play the ball inside. There it is. Hold the ball. Two up. Throw-in.\n5:12 Comment: Yes, yes. The one that strangles Barça is Bayern Leverkusen. That is being a real problem for the players who are there in the midfield as well.\n5:21 Comment: That is the repeated play of how he eats Matié's back with rage to give that ball to Chicharito. Very late.\n5:27 Comment: He handles the ball to Barça, the right wing. He plays back. He keeps it for Alves. He goes on top of him and regains control there.\n5:33 Comment: Mender. Chicharito leaves. The Mexican comes. Neymar is missing earlier, Rafa.\n5:38 Comment: Correct, yes. He understood that there was a previous fault. He understood that there was a fault, yes.\n5:44 Comment: Well, ball again for Iniesta. Iniesta in the lane he likes. He plays for Matié, the deeper winger. Matié puts it in, good ball.\n5:51 Comment: Straight into Leno's hands.\n5:53 Comment: Remember, Thursday live at 9 pm on Antena 3. Gloria Lomana interviews Mariano Rajoy. It is the first interview after the Catalan elections.\n6:3 Comment: This Thursday at 9 pm on Antena 3.\n6:7 Comment: Juan Carlos Unzue now got up to talk to Luis Enrique, but at the moment no player is warming up.\n6:13 Comment: Let's see, right now two of them just got up. Antonio, I don't know if you can see it better from the cabin.\n6:19 Comment: Yes, there are two. There are two from Barça warming up. Let's see, among them I think Jordi Alves is one of them. Let's see.\n6:26 Comment: Prepared, yes. Be careful. There it is.\n6:29 Comment: Be careful, he recovers. Sandro is coming! As I told you, he was looking for the corner, but he narrowly missed Sandro Ramírez.\n6:37 Comment: It's an outside instep. You never score a goal against Leno there. Notice that he has practically covered the entire goal.\n6:44 Comment: I liked it because the ball was low. You can't beat it, but it failed unfortunately.\n6:51 Comment: Sandro is one of the footballers, Marcos, who with barely any angles is capable of trying to find him.\n6:55 Comment: It was very difficult there and as we see the ball finally goes by a meter or two.\n6:59 Comment: You have to pay attention to the finish. Instead of putting in the outside instep, put in the toe.\n7:3 Comment: And in the end there, if you don't put three fingers in, the ball doesn't take that curve and then enter the side net.\n7:10 Comment: So I think he wants to hit the outside of the instep, he's going to be on the ball because you also have to see the speed.\n7:17 Comment: He has to correct the defense of Sanction Valley. He hardly has time.\n7:21 Comment: Roger Smith's first change is going to be Kissling. We imagine it will be a natural change for Chicharito.\n7:28 Comment: A footballer also to hold the ball up there when Everkusen has to play looking for counterattacks.\n7:34 Comment: Be careful, be careful. And Barça may be going to tip over. Campbell comes. Campbell up. He puts it there for Ben Arabi.\n7:40 Comment: Ter Stegen came out.\n7:42 Comment: Antonio has to play to that limit. He has to play risking positions because the ball behind his back is a big problem.\n7:49 Comment: Change is for Chicharito for sure.\n7:52 Comment: He comes there touching Campbell. Campbell to the right. Ball to Donati. Donati higher up.\n7:56 Comment: He comes arriving there. What is he? Bender. Bender who practically plays with his gebelo.\n8:2 Comment: Kramer. Ball up for Rakitic. Harassed by Saljanoglu.\n8:5 Comment: Saljanoglu, who by the way in the first half ran practically the same as Rakitic.\n8:11 Comment: He is the first Barça player. Ahead. Four ahead of Bayer Leverkusen.\n8:16 Comment: Campbell, Kramer, Bender and Ben Arabi. Almost seven kilometers, the four of them.\n8:21 Comment: Every game has its rhythms. But in Bayer Leverkusen, the first day against Bate Borisov,\n8:27 Comment: He ran 12 kilometers more as a team and as a collective than what he ran in Roma-Barça.\n8:34 Comment: It's a game that you win 4-1. A competitive game. It's a good record.\n8:38 Comment: Although each game has its own rhythm. It is being played at the speed of Bayer Leverkusen.\n8:42 Comment: And I think that is not good for Barça. That's why I wanted to interpret that data.\n8:45 Comment: It doesn't mean that by running more you're going to win more games.\n8:48 Comment: But you are taking the game to your field, Lobo.\n8:50 Comment: You can hold that for 90 minutes. Yes, yes. These people have very good physiques.\n8:54 Comment: Look, look. Listen to Camp Nou. Everything that smells like Real Madrid. I don't like it.\n9:2 Comment: José Evans Chicharito. The Mexican is whistled at the Camp Nou. Kislin enters, as Wash said.\n9:7 Comment: Two great scoring chances for Chicharito. I think it was a very good game collectively.\n9:12 Comment: Always giving a very good counterattack option for Chicharito.\n9:16 Comment: Kislin is an opposing player. Over 1.90 meters. Good aerial game.\n9:20 Comment: I think Bayer Leverkusen will try hard to go straight with Kislin.\n9:24 Comment: And thus avoid losses and actions that could allow Barça to counterattack.\n9:29 Comment: Let him be a bit of a buoy man to then give speed to those who are joining the counterattack.\n9:33 Comment: On the counterattack, as Marcos says. Ball up. Luis Suárez tries. Luis Suárez holds on.\n9:37 Comment: Kampel is coming. The Slovenian doesn't stop running and stealing and scratching.\n9:40 Comment: And he has achieved it again for Bayer Leverkusen. Rakitic is coming up.\n9:43 Comment: How timely Corata now is. Mascherano rectifies. Piqué delays. Ball for Ter Stegen.\n9:47 Comment: Kampel even gives him a hand in the pressure race. Ball up. Neymar falls.\n9:51 Comment: The referee is very close. He says there is nothing. Belarabi recovers. Ball for the Germans.\n9:56 Comment: Belarabi wants to put the center in and Kisling unchecks him. In the end it was Kramer.\n10:1 Comment: Bottom line. Goal kick.\n10:5 Comment: The Camp Nou crowd is starting to get angry. The minutes are passing. Barça loses at home.\n10:15 Comment: And a hat-trick, by the way, from Lewandowski. In Bayern's 5-0 win over Dinamo Zagreb.\n10:20 Comment: It's almost not news. The silent killer.\n10:23 Comment: The killer with a silencer, like the Pole could have done. He inoculates you and you don't even realize it.\n10:29 Comment: He puts it up. Tag scores with a header. The ball goes up. Now it's Wendel.\n10:34 Comment: The ball for Iniesta. The front. Iniesta holds on. It gives him oxygen. He plays for Daniel Alves.\n10:39 Comment: Daniel Alves steps on. He wants to score the ball. He does it for the man from Albacete. There is the man from La Mancha.\n10:43 Comment: Fountain Albilla puts it up. Cuts through. Tag. The ball is rejected.\n10:47 Comment: There may be inaccuracy. They get rid of it. Bayer Leverkusen doesn't want complications.\n10:50 Comment: Mascherano plays. Ball for Iniesta. Inside again. It's coming for Busquets.\n10:53 Comment: Delays for Mascherano. Plays for Piqué. Field for Barça. Long stride now from the centre-back.\n10:58 Comment: He puts it for Neymar. Between the lines, about to lose. Iniesta is coming. This Iniesta is good.\n11:2 Comment: Iniesta, Iniesta on the diagonal. Betaco holds on. Rakitic leaves it. The rejection. He hunts him. Out.\n11:11 Comment: Neymar.\n11:15 Comment: The public applauds because another one that almost didn't go in.\n11:18 Comment: Andrés Iniesta's play is anthological because he is already displaced so much that he has to make the last resort\n11:25 Comment: to get that drop shot.\n11:28 Comment: I recommend a hand there, but it didn't seem like it to me. It's on the face.\n11:36 Comment: It seemed from here. Well, here. Clarified by our referee Rafa Guerrero.\n11:41 Comment: Today, by the way, we saw your cucurella at the mini-stadium. Oh, cucurella.\n11:45 Comment: The youth Champions League. I love that one. I love football.\n11:54 Comment: The Barça youth team. That's where the ball plays for Mascherano. Mascherano holds on.\n11:58 Comment: He has the pressure of Ibel Arabi ahead of him. As Marcos said, he is a little ahead.\n12:3 Comment: Kislin, always holding in the center in case we have to go on the counterattack and give that first pass of oxygen\n12:9 Comment: His teammates to join in. Here he comes. He plays the ball up high, he doesn't deepen it for Kislin.\n12:13 Comment: It's his thing. The two cross paths. Right now, I think that with Kislin, Bayern Leverkusen\n12:18 Comment: He has to change the way he plays. Because if the first counterattack pass goes to Kislin,\n12:22 Comment: As if Chicharito were there, that is going to make Mascherano Piqué's recovery a lot easier\n12:27 Comment: and continue playing. The first pass for Kislin, as you say, is from the buoy, with his back turned to hold on.\n12:31 Comment: And in the counterattack action, he always unloads from the outside to a wing player to look for a cross for Kislin.\n12:37 Comment: Rakitic up for Barça, as Marco says, the central defender crosses and there is the ball.\n12:42 Comment: Corner kick. Goal kick, he says. Corner kick at the end.\n12:46 Comment: However, the assistant... Luis Enrique goes for it, because there is going to be a double change at Barça.\n12:52 Comment: From here I think one of them is Jordi Alba.\n12:55 Comment: Between the assistant and the fifth, who is there in the background, in the background game.\n13:0 Comment: Barça wants to put the ball in at the first stop, they put their head in, Wendel took it out.\n13:5 Comment: The ball that bounces in front of him, Kislin wants to put his body in, Kamper comes, the usual one is Slovenian,\n13:9 Comment: It seems like he doesn't run out of fuel, he keeps the ball, Kislin puts it up.\n13:13 Comment: Goral's is bad, it doesn't reach Belarabi and Sitter estegue. Munir and Jordi Alba.\n13:18 Comment: The changes are ready, as Guas, Munir and Jordi Alba say at Barça.\n13:21 Comment: They can't take out Wendel and Kramer, because what a great game they're having.\n13:27 Comment: What a good drop there, at least Luis Suárez stopped it, Tah crossed it, the side took it out.\n13:32 Comment: Tah, 19-year-old central player, is playing well.\n13:36 Comment: Right now I believe that Luis Enrique is looking to give a boost to both bands.\n13:40 Comment: Right wing probably with Munir, left wing with winger Jordi Alba,\n13:45 Comment: The defense always filters very well from the second line.\n13:47 Comment: Iniesta, Iniesta unloads, comes out of the cave, comes back playing, hitting the ball,\n13:51 Comment: Verse to León, dissipating well the little boss Bacherano, recovers the ball for FC Barcelona,\n13:54 Comment: He reverses inside the diagonal, Belarabi jumps on him, about to steal, Bacherano maintains,\n13:59 Comment: It's Neymar, delay for Busquets. He calms down a little and now throws the ball out,\n14:4 Comment: Because there is a footballer who is Iniesta, it seems like he complains.\n14:8 Comment: He's asking Sandro there to see how Andrés Iniesta is.\n14:14 Comment: Ask for change.\n14:15 Comment: He asked for the change, yes, just when they had prepared the Luminoso with the change of Jordi Alba for Rakitic,\n14:21 Comment: Andrés Iniesta asks for change.\n14:23 Comment: Luis Enrique de Unzué's face is full of symptoms.\n14:27 Comment: Like those of us who are here saying...\n14:29 Comment: And the Camp Nou also begins to breathe that murmur of what's happening?\n14:33 Comment: Apart from being the player he is, when you are going to make two changes, when you have a plan,\n14:38 Comment: Someone gets injured who didn't have to go out and it's a difficulty because you have to correct it as you go.\n14:42 Comment: It was Rakitic who was going to leave the field, Luis Enrique has to correct it.\n14:47 Comment: For Iniesta, injured, one more.\n14:50 Comment: Then Jordi Alba comes in.\n14:53 Comment: Yes, he will occupy the left wing in front.\n14:56 Comment: From Mati and Double on the side.\n14:58 Comment: In his time before that conversion to the side.\n15:2 Comment: In Valencia.\n15:3 Comment: And we'll see, he can be a three-man defense.\n15:7 Comment: And from there two wingers occupying the spaces well.\n15:10 Comment: And it seems that Rakitic is placed at the same height in the pivot as Busquets with Neymar.\n15:16 Comment: Again, always looking for Bender and Kramen's back.\n15:19 Comment: What happens is that the team can't find Neymar.\n15:21 Comment: Circumstances are stacking up against Barça right now,\n15:25 Comment: After Iniesta's player, by the way, he has had to leave the pitch now.\n15:29 Comment: The man who gave him some clarity and imbalance.\n15:33 Comment: A change that also forced what they had planned in the plans, as Marcos says and Lobo Carrasco says.\n15:37 Comment: Munir's is coming, Guas.\n15:39 Comment: Yes, Andrés Iniesta has to go directly to the locker room for treatment.\n15:43 Comment: And the second change is ready, Munir.\n15:46 Comment: But Wolf also realizes it perfectly.\n15:49 Comment: We immediately discussed it after the play, but the footballer knows it.\n15:52 Comment: Neymar is going to put the ball up.\n15:54 Comment: In the end the rejection again from the rear.\n15:56 Comment: Alves pockets it well, with the second touch he lifts it for Neymar looking for the back.\n16:0 Comment: He put Wendel in the boot.\n16:1 Comment: It came out slow.\n16:2 Comment:  Wolf.\n16:3 Comment:  Yes Yes.\n16:4 Comment: Honestly, in these circumstances we have to do something, we have to have a strong mentality to endure this departure of Iniesta.\n16:13 Comment: And we'll see if it doesn't have an impact on the team, because the truth is that now Bayern Leverkusen's level is going down.\n16:20 Comment: Eye Wolf, because Neymar complains.\n16:22 Comment: He's limping on his left leg.\n16:26 Comment: A plague or a jinx.\n16:28 Comment: Start of the season, but it's not just happening to Barça.\n16:32 Comment: It's not the only big thing that's happening to him at the moment.\n16:34 Comment: Kislik is coming.\n16:35 Comment: Kislik against Piqué, the two greats.\n16:37 Comment: Ball back, play to the side.\n16:38 Comment: Saljano comes, who wants to put the center in and invents the Turkish.\n16:40 Comment: My goodness, with your left foot on the same line.\n16:42 Comment: On the wire it was the band footballer who was trying to put that ball in there.\n16:48 Comment: El Harabi looking for Saljano.\n16:50 Comment: Take back control, Mascherano.\n16:52 Comment: He jumps on Wendel.\n16:53 Comment: Throw-in.\n16:54 Comment: Look, it touches just the back.\n16:56 Comment: Neymar lifts his pants.\n16:58 Comment: But it seems like a blow to me.\n16:59 Comment: Well, it's not the Guas change, eh?\n17:1 Comment: It doesn't change the plan.\n17:4 Comment: Yes, Sebas Andro who has had three opportunities.\n17:8 Comment: Leno didn't let him score the goal.\n17:12 Comment: Let's see Munir, how he behaves, especially if he has daring.\n17:15 Comment: Munir, who almost everyone thought was going to start, right?\n17:18 Comment: A footballer too, Marcos, who above all showed in his emergence here at FC Barcelona, ​​Olfato.\n17:25 Comment: Yes, a player who went straight for the goal, who was vertical and who had that intuition.\n17:31 Comment: As you say, that Smell, Esteba, in the area.\n17:34 Comment: I think that the pressure also, I think that it has also affected him that the difference between Munir and the three tenors is exaggerated.\n17:42 Comment: And never, at an early moment, especially when you are starting your professional career, can you overshadow him.\n17:50 Comment: Well, they are three incredible players.\n17:52 Comment: Look, Neymar is even now claiming Sanjanooglu's hand.\n17:54 Comment: And Atkinson has seen it, Rafa.\n17:56 Comment: Yes, it really bothered him.\n17:58 Comment: The verabrella for the Turk.\n17:59 Comment:  Correct.\n18:0

was the typical almost sandwich and that's sure it will hurt a little tomorrow, but now she can hold on.\n18:14 Comment: Neymar, Rakitic and Jeremy Martínez.\n18:16 Comment: Fighting with the referee for half a meter, because half a meter can mean that when the ball curves into the goal, right?\n18:23 Comment: The hand, as Rafa says, is no longer spoken of voluntariness, but of intentionality or...\n18:28 Comment: Yes, liberation.\n18:30 Comment: Of liberation, correct.\n18:31 Comment: Well, it's clearly...\n18:32 Comment: It's very liberal.\n18:34 Comment: ...Sanjanooglu running away from the pass, the pass that can cause a lot of damage to his defense.\n18:38 Comment: He is going to try it now between Neymar or Jeremy Martínez in the free kick approximately 10 meters from the edge of

the more wear and tear, the more errors, right Marcos?\n22:38 Comment: Obviously, technique always takes precedence and once fatigue sets in,\n22:43 Comment: You're always a second late, it's easier to make fouls.\n22:45 Comment: Especially there, Papadopoulos was very clear, there is a lack of tactics.\n22:49 Comment: The player couldn't pass there because he was the center back who had left the line\n22:53 Comment: and had left his defense unbalanced.\n22:55 Comment: He wants to play up there, Mascherano, Campbell recovers,\n22:58 Comment: He even plays it for Donati, Donati lifts, the ball goes up, Brandt comes.\n23:2 Comment: Brandt for Campbell, Campbell inside, he touches the ball again, there was Bender.\n23:6 Comment: Receive Julian Brandt, Brandt inside, for Bender, Bender there for Kislin,\n23:11 Comment: It's good but it's hard for him to start very quickly, the perfect Jordi Alba.\n23:15 Comment: The first three meters have nothing to do with Delaravi.\n23:18 Comment: Besides, he has 31 suits and Kislin, it's not his thing, Marcos wasn't his thing.\n23:22 Comment:  That is.\n23:23 Comment: But he's losing speed.\n23:24 Comment: Well, let's see how he compared his beginnings to Jürgen Klinsmann.\n23:27 Comment: That's where the ball plays, and Rudi Völler is still the man who commands a lot in this team.\n23:34 Comment: There the ball goes, it was offside.\n23:37 Comment: Ball for Bayer Leverkusen, I also take this opportunity to remind you that your face sounds familiar to me on Friday at 10 pm on Antena 3,\n23:45 Comment: Your face's new

straight out for Barça.\n24:19 Comment: 25 of the first half, this is still, 0-1.\n24:25 Comment: And that's Iniesta's injury, he looks like a crack, back there vice-femoral and hamstring at least.\n24:32 Comment: Yes, it seems that he is muscular, and he is also a player who already knows his body well and did not hesitate for a second to ask for the change.\n24:40 Comment: Let's hope

the napoleno in the face.\n25:21 Comment: That was a good one, yes.\n25:25 Comment: He wants to play the ball up, Wendel controls the ball, Wendel with his back is not going to reach Brandt, they are making more and more mistakes.\n25:35 Comment: The physical level has dropped and there the ball can roll with more guarantee of success.\n25:40 Comment: Sergi Roberto is going to be Luis Enrique's last change, now perhaps Iván Raquetich is leaving.\n25:46 Comment: My colleagues who are listening also say that evidently in the sixth, the sixth column on Fridays.\n25:51 Comment: Program that we cannot miss either, the sixth column, of course, great research work, journalism.\n25:57 Comment: This is the previous gesture and the piqué shot, always well placed.\n26:1 Comment: And change comes,

shape, in terms of physical condition, spark, confidence, it could be a good moment for Sergi Roberto.\n26:20 Comment: Let's see, he has come here to the left side, Cherano is going to work on the inside and Busquets on the right.\n26:27 Comment: There the ball plays, once again Barça, Sergi Roberto, the first target to touch, harassed by three, that's why he also regains control.\n26:33

Matíe puts it in, plays again in the central circle.\n27:3 Comment: Difficulties in control for Busquets, play back for Mascherano.\n27:6 Comment: The start is much easier because with Chicharito there is more spark in the pressure, be careful with this one.\n27:10 Comment: He comes up, Luis Suárez doesn't arrive, the German team cuts again, ball to encourage on the front, he can mess it up, there is a lot of noise, a white morale and in the end he has to take it out.\n27:19 Comment: Back there Papado Paulos.\n27:21 Comment: Up to four players, it was very difficult.\n27:23 Comment: It's time for individuality, right now positionally, tactically, Barça can't make a difference.\n27:29 Comment: Right now it is a start, a one for one, a player who generates space and a scoring chance where there is nothing.\n27:35 Comment: Enlivens the Camp Nou.\n27:36 Comment: And that's it, your team also needs the spirit, the ball plays there, the front comes, it falls there, Sergi Roberto appears, he puts the pass to the left, he can put the ball up there.\n27:45 Comment: Jordi Alba holds up well, but he lost the ball, the German team recovers it, sends it. The Germans are already throwing balls away.\n27:51 Comment: He was injured.\n27:55 Comment: The Camp Nou is whistling again, but now it seems that...\n27:59 Comment: Yes, the typical cramp.\n28:2 Comment: Marcos's twin gets on, he has to...\n28:8 Comment: To Donati, while Jordi Alba was already telling Atkinson about the waste of time.\n28:12 Comment: Donati, these types of actions are, well, very demanding Donati during the game, with a very high level of activity, always accompanying the attack.\n28:22 Comment: What happens here is worth remembering, minute 72, 0-1, your team wins, don't worry.\n28:31 Comment: I also remember that Valencia continues to win with a goal from Fegulí, almost on the stroke of half-time against the Olimpiade de León.\n28:37 Comment: León 0, Valencia 1, then the best summary in mega, with total Champions with the rest of the games.\n28:44 Comment: Tomorrow with Sevilla FC, Atlético de Madrid and Real Madrid.\n28:48 Comment: Campbell wins the ball, but in the end it reaches the domain, there was no prior foul.\n28:53 Comment: FC Barcelona is now in play, Jordi Alba comes a meter further back, Neymar throws, Neymar receives.\n28:58 Comment: Neymar makes a mess, but in the end he wants to come out ahead of Donati, who once again has another last effort, but he's already stiff.\n29:4 Comment: He's stiff, the ball is up, Jordi Alba appears, Jordi Alba can be good against Ta, he even throws the shot at Jordi Alba, who warms up.\n29:12 Comment: They both warm up, Ta and Jordi Alba, Papadopoulos also goes for Jordi Alba, he has to be separated by Luis Suárez who catches him...\n29:20 Comment: Suérez stays on the back of the head, and Luis Suárez moves Alba away so she doesn't get much hotter.\n29:30 Comment: And yellow, the Camp Nou shouts for Jordi Alba.\n29:35 Comment: There is an enormous difference in size, so Jordi Alba cannot enter there.\n29:39 Comment: But after the killing, it's not because of this, it's because...\n29:42 Comment: Then he gives a kind of answer, and thank goodness it wasn't so treacherous and it was left half-kept there.\n29:50 Comment: There was a ball to play for.\n29:51 Comment: It was an attack, so you have to be careful because now you have to be cold, don't let the anguish overcome you, and you have to be very careful.\n29:59 Comment: So there you have to be careful because now you have to be cold, don't let the anguish overcome you, and let's see what happens in this last quarter that is going to arrive.\n30:6 Comment: Rafa Guerrero.\n30:7 Comment: Well, he solved it with a yellow piece of cardboard, and we have to thank him because if you looked at it another way, as Lobo commented, it could have been a different color.\n30:15 Comment: I'm fine with Adkinson's decision.\n30:18 Comment: Gilbert Susana has come on, at right back for Donati.\n30:21 Comment: Donati left, who was just suffering from cramps here a few minutes ago.\n30:25 Comment: And it's not very over before playing either. If he hadn't been almost a starter, Gilbert's knee was affected by Marcos.\n30:31 Comment: Yes, it wasn't the last game due to injury. Well, this is the call. It is assumed that a wing player, older, 30 years old, with greater defensive value than Donati, is there to play,\n30:42 Comment: Inferior offensively, and a player who is the lord and master of Bayer Leverkusen's right back this season.\n30:50 Comment: Barça puts it in, of course they get the second ball.\n30:54 Comment: He missed it. Mixed, mixed, mixed. Bounce soon. That shot is not easy.\n31:0 Comment: Is Wass next door? Yes, yes, I'm right in front.\n31:3 Comment: And what he said... Yes, here I am in a privileged situation. What the Wolf said. It wasn't an easy shot, he missed it.\n31:10 Comment: The control seems good, but look. Now, launch quickly.\n31:13 Comment: It seems like the ball is skidding on the chest.\n31:16 Comment: Yes, what happens is that if you do it with your right, you normally have more confidence. He who is right-handed has much more security.\n31:21 Comment: He who is left-handed can do a mixed one, because of that automatism that you already have from birth.\n31:26 Comment: Yes, sir. That's the most difficult thing, Lobo, I'm serious. And I've always admired it about soccer players, the coordination in soccer.\n31:32 Comment: Yes, yes. That's why it's such a sport... In life, Esteban. It's important to be coordinated.\n31:37 Comment: The Wolf has obviously drunk them.\n31:40 Comment: The Wolf who slept at the Camp Nou. Of course, but apart from that, there was a lot of speed here. The more speed...\n31:46 Comment: Yes, it's true. I was right-handed from birth, actually.\n31:49 Comment: There you have it, Rafa Guerrero well targeted. The ball goes to the side, Barça plays it.\n31:54 Comment: 32 of the second half at the Camp Nou. Be careful as we enter the last quarter of an hour.\n31:59 Comment: And this is still Barça at zero. Bayern beats him in one. Caglioni is injured.\n32:4 Comment: It truncated some of Luis Enrique's plans and changes, who had started the second half with Neymar behind the two forwards of Luis Suárez and Sandro, who is no longer there.\n32:12 Comment: He has also made way for youth player Amunir.\n32:16 Comment: But Bayern has also known how, let's say, to hit the alarm button the moment it is caught by a player who can, let's say, destabilize or unbalance you.\n32:27 Comment: What Iniesta was when he was on the field of fire and especially Neymar. When Neymar has the ball, three or four come out like true wolves for him.\n32:36 Comment: Look at Amunir, look at Amunir. Barcelona needs and Amunir is there. The youth player appears at the end. He falls.\n32:41 Comment: And it's the ball again, on a goal kick. Nothing happened, but Amunir tried.\n32:46 Comment: He is also dragging his team along. The Camp Nou needs him. He is also there right now.\n32:52 Comment: It's with that silence that is cut off. Perdamir trying to cheer up his people.\n32:57 Comment: Last round for Barça. All eyes are on Neymar and Luis Suárez right now. Now is the time for geniuses.\n33:3 Comment: Yes, yes, but Bayern is there, Everkusen, and the moment Neymar catches it, you'll see.\n33:10 Comment: Look Kisling, that's why Roger Smith brought it on in the second half. Campbell again. He plays to the right.\n33:15 Comment: It seemed like it wasn't there, but it's still there. He puts it up for Julian Brown. Offside.\n33:18 Comment: Look at the change of plan with Kisling. As Leno takes Kisling directly, he prevents Barça's pressure from allowing him a recovery in the opposite field and a scoring chance.\n33:28 Comment: Bayern loses on the counterattack, but wins in a defensive situation. By changing forward for forward, you defend better. It is often the paradox in football.\n33:38 Comment: And there it is too, Mascherano plays. Mascherano for Mathieu. Mathieu, he already has two Germans on him.\n33:44 Comment: Ball for Neymar. Control aimed at Bender's back. It almost came out. Jordi Alba regained control. On the left side he put it in front.\n33:50 Comment: Luis Suárez controls it. He deceives Luis Suárez. He hooks Luis Suárez. The ball goes to Neymar. The dribble returns.\n33:55 Comment: It is repelled. It looks like a pinball because the ball does nothing but carom, but it doesn't go to the door.\n34:1 Comment: They look like they're coming out from under the grass. White, white, white.\n34:9 Comment: The Germans from Bayern Leverkusen are multiplying. They play the ball high, it comes from the right. They try to control, there is a foul.\n34:16 Comment: Correct. Afkinson already asks for a little distance. Neymar takes it. Very quickly he now wants to catch the German defense without reply.\n34:21 Comment: He plays to the right for Dani Alves. He makes the bicycle, throws at the Magician. The Brazilian holds on on the verge of losing.\n34:26 Comment: Mascherano appears, but also Neymar from above. Neymar is looking forward to the rest of the game.\n34:31 Comment:  Play to the right for Dani Alves. Shoot diagonally. Hold. Shoot the Magician. Steal Kisling. Get Saljah Noghlu back.\n34:37 Comment: He cuts the ball to the right, he wants to put the ball up there. He does it well now for Sergi Roberto.\n34:42 Comment: He goes towards the front. He can search. Jordi Alba does it. Barça opens the field. Jordi Alba sets it up.\n34:47 Comment: He takes it the second time. Goal, goal, goal, goal.\n34:53 Comment:  Goal...\n34:59 Comment: From the one who started the play, Sergi Roberto. Goal from Barça.\n35:5 Comment: The game tied, he had to insist, he had to persevere, but Barça scored\n35:13 Comment: he got the second barça 1 bayern everkusen 1 what a loss of\n35:20 Comment: saljanoğlu after a goal from sergi roberto counterattack exit in the zone\n35:25 Comment: right of Barça's attack from there to the quick ball to Jordi Alba arriving and\n35:29 Comment: Sergi Roberto's goal with his body position hinders the first shot\n35:35 Comment: Leno Leno makes the first mistake of the whole night, which is to leave the ball\n35:38 Comment: Logically there at the mercy of the auction, be careful with this one\n35:43 Comment: This is what mati and piqué have to do now\n35:47 Comment: 10 minutes wolf Marcos Susana\n35:51 Comment: very celebrated by the barça bench especially for luis enrique because that\n35:55 Comment: The goal didn't come, we didn't see Luis Enrique's fists-up gestures like when we did\n36:0 Comment: Goals as a player are a moment of tension right now, 10 minutes for him\n36:5 Comment: To win the Champions League match, Barça is vital. This is the Champions League on Antenna 3.\n36:11 Comment: the truck sings albis wants to put it up\n36:16 Comment: The assistant does not raise the flag, there is no offside that he comes to put in\n36:19 Comment: munir munir munir for luis suárez\n36:31 Comment: from barça\n36:34 Comment: mother of my life, what Luis Suárez has done with a great goal for the squad\n36:42 Comment: Breaking the German wall marks Luis Suárez Luis Suárez marks El Salteño a\n36:50 Comment: survivor barça 2 leberkusen 1 the gunman has just done well his\n36:59 Comment: nickname of first hit of internal commitment surprising unstoppable for\n37:3 Comment: Read a very fast action, good play by Munir, yes, but that's the execution.\n37:9 Comment: It's a genius, but if you don't execute quickly, you'll get white marks.

    "summary": "In a high-octane clash at the iconic Camp Nou, FC Barcelona managed to scrape out a hard-fought 2-1 victory against a resilient Bayer Leverkusen. The game unfolded with a dizzying pace, starting from the first whistle, setting the stage for a classic UEFA Champions League encounter that left fans on the edge of their seats until the very end.\n\nFrom the get-go, the game was an epitome of top-tier European football. FC Barcelona, guided by Luis Enrique from the sidelines, kicked off play, immediately looking to stamp their authority on the proceedings. In the opening seconds, Dani Alves got his first touch on the ball, looking to set the tone early. The ball was moved swiftly across the midfield by the intricate passing of Sergio Busquets and Gerard Piqué, who came forward, trying to set the tempo.\n\nBayer Leverkusen, however, were quick to counter the early pressure. Their high pressing game, something that has become a hallmark of Roger Schmidt's tenure, was evident from the outset. In fact, the German side’s intent to play in Barcelona’s half was clear as they initiated their first serious attack within the first minute, with Chicharito Hernandez lurking in the attacking third, always ready to exploit any defensive lapse.\n\nThe visitors’ approach bore fruit early as they consistently pushed Barcelona back, creating half-chances and giving the home side's defenders plenty to worry about. Kevin Kampl, the Slovenian, continually hassled the Barcelona defense with his dynamic play on the right flank, linking up effectively with Karim Bellarabi and Hakan Çalhanoğlu. This relentless pressure was complemented by the physicality and technical ability of Lars Bender and Christoph Kramer in midfield, who disrupted Barcelona’s rhythm repeatedly.\n\nIn the 21st minute, Bayer Leverkusen’s persistence was rewarded. Hakan Çalhanoğlu’s expertly taken corner found Kyriakos Papadopoulos who, evading his marker, Mathieu, nodded the ball past Ter Stegen. The Greek defender’s header was powerful and placed with precision into the net, giving the German side a deserved lead and silencing the Catalan supporters momentarily. It wasn't just the goal that was a statement; it was the manner in which it came, a perfectly executed set-piece showing tactical awareness and physical dominance.\n\nBarcelona’s response was characteristically determined yet fraught with challenges. The Blaugrana, missing the talismanic Lionel Messi due to injury, struggled to find their usual rhythm. Andres Iniesta, stepping into his customary role, tried orchestrating play from midfield, linking up with Neymar and Luis Suárez. However, Bayer Leverkusen's defensive setup was resolute. Bernd Leno, the German shot-stopper, was in imperious form, thwarting several attempts from Neymar and Suarez, denying Barcelona with saves that were as spectacular as they were crucial.\n\nDespite the growing frustration, Barcelona continued to probe, with Neymar, in particular, showing flashes of brilliance. His quick feet and sharp turns caused constant headaches for the Leverkusen defenders, but clear-cut chances were hard to come by. The first half concluded with Barcelona trailing and their supporters growing increasingly anxious.\n\nThe second half began with Barcelona making slight tactical adjustments to breach the German defense. Neymar was positioned behind the attacking duo of Luis Suárez and Sandro Ramirez, creating a triangular attacking setup aimed at piercing through Leverkusen’s rigid backline. Early into the half, Sandro had a chance to equalize but could only find the side netting under pressure from Leno and the closing defenders.\n\nFor Leverkusen, the substitution of Chicharito Hernandez for Stefan Kiessling marked a strategic shift. While Chicharito had been a constant threat with his movement and pace, Kiessling’s introduction signaled an intent to hold the ball up more, allowing his team to breathe amidst Barcelona’s growing pressure. This change, while aimed at stabilizing the game, inadvertently invited more Barcelona incursions.\n\nAn injury blow struck Barcelona in the midst of their offensive push as Andres Iniesta signaled he couldn’t continue, immediately requesting a substitution. This development forced a tactical rethink from Luis Enrique, who introduced Jordi Alba and Munir El Haddadi to inject more pace and width. Despite these modifications, the German side continued to remain compact in defense, frustrating the Catalans with disciplined defending and timely interceptions.\n\nThe turning point arrived in the 80th minute, fueled by persistence and a stroke of luck. Sergi Roberto, introduced earlier to provide more dynamism, capitalized on a rare error from the usually reliable Bernd Leno. In a scramble inside Leverkusen's box, Jordi Alba’s cross was inadequately dealt with, and Roberto was there to pounce, forcing the ball home amidst a chaotic sequence of deflections. The Camp Nou erupted in relief and jubilation as Barcelona found the equalizer.\n\nSensing the shift in momentum, Barcelona pressed vehemently for a winner. Barely a few minutes later, the breakthrough came through a moment of individual brilliance. Munir, who had proved his mettle since coming on, raced down the right wing slipping past his marker before delivering a precise cutback to Luis Suárez. The Uruguayan striker, with a deft touch and sheer audacity, rifled the ball into the top corner, a finish as emphatic as it was vital. The strike left Bernd Leno with no chance, propelling Barcelona into the lead, and sending the home fans into rapturous celebration.\n\nThe final minutes saw Leverkusen throwing men forward in desperate search of an equalizer, but the Barcelona defense, marshaled by Piqué and Mascherano, held firm. Ter Stegen's composure and command between the posts ensured that no further slip-ups occurred. The final whistle finalized Barcelona's comeback, a testament to their resilience and fighting spirit.\n\nLuis Enrique’s side had shown their capacity not just for beautiful football, but for grinding out results even when the odds seemed against them. Despite Bayer Leverkusen’s spirited display and tactical discipline, it was Barcelona’s indomitable will and moments of sheer class that secured them the three points. The victory, wrapped in the drama and edge-of-the-seat tension characteristic of such high stakes European nights, was a rallying cry for the Blaugrana faithful and a reminder of their club's enduring fighting spirit."
