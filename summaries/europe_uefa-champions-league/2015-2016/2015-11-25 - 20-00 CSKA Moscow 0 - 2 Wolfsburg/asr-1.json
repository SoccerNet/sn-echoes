that's the big thing for...\n6:19 Comment: Oh, there's Dost!\n6:22 Comment: Nigel Spackman was just alluding to. First cross the night for him, it gets the thumbs up, he couldn't find the target.\n6:29 Comment: No, but it's a good ball in, he just gets past the near post, he needs to flick that header, he gets too much on it,\n6:35 Comment: he can't direct it on target, he's just got to really flick it in there.\n6:39 Comment: This is Dumbier who's so good, and Moussa when they get on the ball.\n6:50 Comment: But coming back to Wolfsburg, they lost two games, they lost to PSV, then went home and lost to Mainz,\n6:56 Comment: but won at the weekend against Werder Bremen 6-0, you gain confidence from that, that's for sure,\n7:1 Comment: but they've got to bring it into the Champions League performances as well, because they are a good side.\n7:6 Comment: Here's Dost. It was worth a go, he got two of those six goals at the weekend.\n7:14 Comment: Against Bremen, they are now 29 from this league of games unbeaten at home.\n7:20 Comment: Yeah, very strongly at home, but not so strong on their travels, I think they've lost in the Champions League\n7:25 Comment: four or five away games in the Champions League, which just isn't good enough if you want to get through.\n7:29 Comment: Tonight they've got a great opportunity to win away from home and really have an excellent chance at home\n7:35 Comment: against Manchester United in the final game to go through.\n7:42 Comment: Kruiser, a delivery from him, good one for Miklasovic.\n7:53 Comment: At the moment, Moscow just can't get hold of the ball, they can't get any rhythm in their play,\n7:58 Comment: it's all Vukesberg, and I think that's because there's no pressure on the ball defensively,\n8:3 Comment: the two centre-backs are comfortable on it, picking out passes in the midfield\n8:6 Comment: and then getting down this left-hand side very well.\n8:11 Comment: Tosic back with the challenge.\n8:15 Comment: CSK, Moscow throw.\n8:16 Comment: They've given it away again, they were beaten 2-0 at home here at the weekend.\n8:35 Comment: Given the fact that until the first week of November they were 21 matches unbeaten in the Russian Premier League,\n8:40 Comment: that's why they've suffered such negative headlines in recent weeks.\n8:45 Comment: That was a lovely touch from Caliguri, Mario Fernandes all ends up.\n8:50 Comment: Lovely touch on the knee and then a little turn, head ball down,\n8:55 Comment: Fernandes, this is a good position now, wide free kick, Dante should come up for this as well,\n9:0 Comment: you've got Dos, they've got plenty of height, it's all about the delivery.\n9:10 Comment: Can they test Akinfayev?\n9:13 Comment: Villarino will be the Wolfsburg player to deliver this free kick,\n9:18 Comment: once the Italian referee has sorted something out inside the penalty area.\n9:25 Comment: In from Villarino then, Fernandes it was, he made the interception.\n9:30 Comment: Here's Moussa, can CSK, Moscow counter, they've got four up.\n9:37 Comment: He couldn't get round Trash.\n9:41 Comment: It is a free kick to Wolfsburg but the German team do have to be wary of that.\n9:46 Comment: Words from the free kick in, it wasn't the best of free kicks and suddenly it's cleared.\n9:50 Comment: And then on the counter attack, Moscow with the pace they've got in Moussa,\n9:53 Comment: but he didn't get his head up, he's on the break, he's got to get his head up and look for the runners off the ball.\n9:58 Comment: But it's just a wake-up call for Wolfsburg really.\n10:0 Comment: On the counter attack, Moscow have got good pace, good ability,\n10:5 Comment: but Moussa on this occasion overrun it, needs to get his head up and pick players out.\n10:10 Comment: Here he is again, the Nigerian international, 22 years of age.\n10:15 Comment: Milosevic with the long ball looking for Dumbia.\n10:19 Comment: So much resting on his shoulders, back at the club on loan from Roma.\n10:25 Comment: He's actually scored three of their four Champions League group stage goals.\n10:29 Comment: If you include the qualifiers, he's got six in six Champions League appearances for them this season.\n10:35 Comment: Yeah, very good record if you include the qualifiers as you say, Steve.\n10:39 Comment: But it didn't really work out for him at Roma, didn't really find any form there or goals.\n10:44 Comment: I just think maybe in Moscow it suits his game.\n10:47 Comment: He's the main man, he plays that lone striker role very well for them.\n10:51 Comment: He's got good mobility and he can score goals.\n10:53 Comment: Terrific vocal backing for CSKA tonight.\n10:58 Comment: All our supporters aware of the importance of this match\n11:2 Comment: in terms of extending their European journey this season.\n11:9 Comment: Trashed with the cross, cut out by Gusevic.\n11:13 Comment: It's interesting for me the tactics that Sluzny has decided to go with at home here.\n11:18 Comment: Really just needs him to be a bit more aggressive.\n11:21 Comment: Not really pressurising the ball in the middle of the park,\n11:24 Comment: just sitting on the edge of your own 18-yard box\n11:27 Comment: and trying not to leave too much space in behind.\n11:36 Comment: Wolfsburg looking comfortable in possession.\n11:39 Comment: Schäfer, eight years at the club.\n11:44 Comment: Continuing a left back in the absence of Ricardo Rodriguez.\n11:49 Comment: The men's half has stayed down after that challenge with Shilo Vogi.\n11:57 Comment: The referee didn't give a free kick for this.\n12:0 Comment: It's a play on.\n12:5 Comment: Shilo Vogi's gone down.\n12:7 Comment: A little clash of heads there but nothing malicious in it.\n12:11 Comment: I think it's just a cold night in the Champions League.\n12:13 Comment: He doesn't need the Spakman headband just yet.\n12:16 Comment: No, nobody needs that, that's for sure.\n12:19 Comment: A heated one might do tonight here in Moscow.\n12:24 Comment: Understandably, CSKA coach looking on pensively.\n12:32 Comment: Had to work extremely hard to get into this group stage.\n12:34 Comment: They beat both Sparta Prague and Sporting Lisbon.\n12:37 Comment: It's a very close game.\n12:38 Comment: Had to work extremely hard to get into this group stage.\n12:40 Comment: They beat both Sparta Prague and Sporting Lisbon.\n12:44 Comment: In qualifying, they are trying to avoid finishing bottom of their Champions League group for the third season running.\n12:56 Comment: It's surprising, their league form has been good up until recently as you touched on.\n13:2 Comment: And they brought that into the Champions League.\n13:4 Comment: Hard to beat but don't score enough goals at this level.\n13:7 Comment: I think it's Dumbiau who is really the main man but other players have got to come in with the goals as well.\n13:13 Comment: If you look at Tosic, he hasn't scored a goal in the Champions League.\n13:17 Comment: Milanov hasn't scored a goal in the Champions League either.\n13:20 Comment: So it just shows that maybe at this level, they are not quite up to the standard of maybe the top teams in the Champions League.\n13:27 Comment: But it's a shame that really they don't get into the knockout stages.\n13:38 Comment: Goal! Goal! Goal!\n13:46 Comment: On the way back to Benalio.\n13:48 Comment: January was a great seven years at Wolfsburg.\n13:51 Comment: A member of the team that won the Bundesliga and has competed in the Champions League.\n13:58 Comment: The likes of Edin Dzeko and Graffiti.\n14:1 Comment: Goal! Goal! Goal!\n14:4 Comment: They finished third in their group under Armin Paye.\n14:7 Comment: That particular campaign.\n14:10 Comment: It is actually six years to the day since these two met in that same campaign.\n14:15 Comment: CSK went by two goals to one that day.\n14:19 Comment: They certainly accept the repeat of that this evening.\n14:23 Comment: Goal! Goal! Goal!\n14:26 Comment: They haven't shown anything to us this evening so far that they are capable of winning this game.\n14:31 Comment: They really haven't put enough movement together.\n14:33 Comment: They haven't had enough controlled possession.\n14:35 Comment: It's been Wolfsburg who have been the better team.\n14:38 Comment: Knocking the ball around.\n14:40 Comment: But there hasn't been a lot of pressure on them.\n14:42 Comment: But when they've got it into wide areas so far, the quality into the box hasn't been good enough.\n14:47 Comment: They need to improve on that if they're going to break Moscow down.\n14:56 Comment: Goal! Goal! Goal!\n15:2 Comment: Nalda.\n15:3 Comment: Goal! Goal! Goal!\n15:8 Comment: They are obviously through to Makin Feyev.\n15:13 Comment: He hasn't kept a clean sheet in any of his last 35 Champions League appearances for CSK Moscow.\n15:20 Comment: They are obviously through to Makin Feyev.\n15:21 Comment: Goal! Goal! Goal!\n15:24 Comment: It's not the sort of stat you want when you're a goalkeeper, is it?\n15:27 Comment: Maybe.\n15:28 Comment: Goal! Goal! Goal!\n15:34 Comment: Very good.\n15:35 Comment: Goal! Goal! Goal!\n15:41 Comment: Comfortable for Dante.\n15:43 Comment: Goal! Goal! Goal!\n15:50 Comment: Good work from Kaliguri.\n15:54 Comment: Zagorov.\n15:57 Comment: Milanov.\n15:58 Comment: He was going for goal, blocked by Naldo.\n16:19 Comment: Tosic.\n16:23 Comment: Good pressing from Wolfsburg.\n16:26 Comment: Yeah, good pressing from Wolfsburg for sure, but Moscow just aren't moving the ball quick enough.\n16:31 Comment: They get a bit of possession and they end up going backwards with it rather than forwards with it.\n16:34 Comment: And then when they try and go forward, they give it away.\n16:37 Comment: So they really need to get a bit of rhythm in their play.\n16:40 Comment: They're really not looking confident on the ball at the moment.\n16:44 Comment: First yellow card of the evening.\n16:47 Comment: And it is for Moussa for that challenge.\n16:55 Comment: Yeah, it's a forwards challenge. Slid in from behind.\n16:59 Comment: Doesn't make contact with the ball.\n17:1 Comment: It's a yellow card tackle from behind.\n17:4 Comment: And a good situation, this again for Wolfsburg.\n17:7 Comment: But they've got a better quality on the delivery into the box from these free kicks.\n17:15 Comment: Moussa.\n17:18 Comment: Naldo.\n17:19 Comment: And Dante.\n17:20 Comment: Both forward.\n17:22 Comment: Obviously along with Dost.\n17:23 Comment: Delivered by Vieri and it was towards Naldo.\n17:27 Comment: And the flag was up.\n17:30 Comment: Just a nervous split second there for CSK Moscow.\n17:35 Comment: Well, it's a better ball into the box.\n17:39 Comment: It's header right, but it's a correct decision.\n17:42 Comment: It was definitely offside.\n17:46 Comment: Djulovic, I think it was, who was offside there, just straight off.\n17:58 Comment: Safely backed by Dante.\n18:2 Comment: He played CSK Moscow four times in the Champions League in his buying days.\n18:7 Comment: In all four meetings.\n18:12 Comment: Vieri.\n18:15 Comment: It's a goal.\n18:30 Comment: One by Dost.\n18:35 Comment: Just look a little anxious, the home team, don't they?\n18:38 Comment: Well, I think having lost the last three games in a row, losing it the weekend as well, 2-0 at home.\n18:44 Comment: Their confidence is very low at the moment.\n18:46 Comment: And the way the tactics is in this, they're not getting enough of the ball.\n18:50 Comment: And knocking the ball around, getting a bit of movement on it, getting confidence that way.\n18:53 Comment: Really, they're going quite direct at times.\n18:56 Comment: And then there's a 50-50 ball once you do that.\n18:59 Comment: Give it away once again.\n19:0 Comment: Now you're under pressure.\n19:2 Comment: You know, you can't get that confidence here.\n19:4 Comment: You've got to start moving the ball a bit quicker from back into the midfield.\n19:7 Comment: Get it into the forward position.\n19:8 Comment: A bit more movement off the ball and start to get some confidence that way.\n19:13 Comment: Mooson trying to get away from Trash.\n19:15 Comment: Unsuccessful on that occasion, but it's back with Wernblum.\n19:21 Comment: Tosich.\n19:25 Comment: Tosich again, very congested, no central areas.\n19:29 Comment: So many Wolfsburg bodies.\n19:30 Comment: So many Wolfsburg bodies back there.\n19:31 Comment: And then Dumbia committed the foul.\n19:36 Comment: They look dangerous when they get on those little balls.\n19:38 Comment: And they're trying to tow it into Dumbia and get runs off him.\n19:41 Comment: But it's very direct, really, until you get into this final third.\n19:45 Comment: Then they're trying to play it into each other here.\n19:47 Comment: It's good defending from Wolfsburg in the end.\n19:49 Comment: And then Dumbia gives the free kick away.\n19:51 Comment: But the crowd are even getting irritated now.\n19:53 Comment: You know, they're not seeing anything, any shots on goal.\n19:56 Comment: And they're not getting the ball.\n19:57 Comment: Kaliguri.\n19:59 Comment: Just lost his footing.\n20:2 Comment: The all-important moment.\n20:3 Comment: The man who gave Wolfsburg the lead at Old Trafford on matchday two.\n20:9 Comment: A reminder.\n20:11 Comment: Champions League tonight.\n20:12 Comment: All the build-up to all the remaining games from 6.30.\n20:15 Comment: With Gary and the team.\n20:17 Comment: They include Juventus, Manchester City, live on the pitch.\n20:20 Comment: And then the final third.\n20:25 Comment: Juventus, Manchester City, live on two.\n20:28 Comment: And then City try and win that group from 7 o'clock.\n20:30 Comment: And the other game in this group, Manchester United vs PSV.\n20:33 Comment: It's on BT Sport Europe from 7.30.\n20:37 Comment: And all the goals in the highlight show on BT Sport Europe from 10 o'clock tonight.\n20:43 Comment: And certainly in Wolfsburg's case, a victory would mean when PSV and Manchester United walk out at Old Trafford, that Wolfsburg would be leading Group B.\n21:2 Comment: Yeah, I think that's the psychological thing that Wolfsburg have got to do tonight.\n21:6 Comment: If they can win this, get top of the league, they can then have a nice flight home back to Germany.\n21:11 Comment: Knowing that whatever happens in Manchester tonight, they've got a chance of going through and a really good chance of going through.\n21:25 Comment: Manchester didn't quite keep that in.\n21:41 Comment: Now or never.\n21:55 Comment: Zagreb with the foul for CSKA, Sheila Fughi for Wolfsburg.\n22:4 Comment: Trash.\n22:6 Comment: It's a Wolfsburg throw.\n22:29 Comment: Nalder.\n22:36 Comment: To hit forward by Dante to Kruiser.\n22:49 Comment: Moussa helping back.\n22:53 Comment: Dumbia.\n22:54 Comment: Zagreb.\n22:56 Comment: The hosts want those two on the ball wherever possible.\n23:0 Comment: They weren't able to get the ball in.\n23:2 Comment: They weren't able to continue there, but Zagreb has it back.\n23:7 Comment: The early ball was a fraction too early.\n23:10 Comment: He did well to win the ball, then he's got to pick the pass.\n23:12 Comment: Really didn't need to play it so early.\n23:15 Comment: But Wolfsburg are trying to hit on the counter-attack.\n23:18 Comment: They're sitting back. The back four are staying back as a four.\n23:21 Comment: They're not really squeezing up, pushing Dost back towards his own goal.\n23:24 Comment: They're playing very deep.\n23:26 Comment: And then with their centre forward, Dumbia, he's playing so high up against the back four.\n23:30 Comment: The game is so spread.\n23:32 Comment: And Arnold in the middle of the park just keeps getting on the ball.\n23:34 Comment: No one's picking him up.\n23:36 Comment: I think tactically, second half, in Moscow, if they're going to go on and win this game,\n23:39 Comment: they're going to have to change it.\n23:40 Comment: They're going to have to squeeze the game higher up the park\n23:42 Comment: and get in touching distance of Dumbia, really, who's up there on his own.\n23:46 Comment: Although Moussa's trying to get up and support him.\n23:49 Comment: Really, most of the time, he's closing the ball.\n23:50 Comment: Nobody else is going with him.\n23:58 Comment: Christian Trash.\n23:59 Comment: Gilles Lafogue.\n24:5 Comment: Dante.\n24:7 Comment: Champions League winner, of course, with Bayern.\n24:14 Comment: The arena unable to get that under control.\n24:19 Comment: Leonis, all on the hosts here.\n24:24 Comment: Well, they know that they need to win this game, CSK.\n24:27 Comment: And really, they haven't come out in this first, what, 25 minutes now.\n24:32 Comment: They really haven't had a shot at goal.\n24:33 Comment: They haven't created anything.\n24:35 Comment: It's been Wolfsburg who have been more controlled possession,\n24:37 Comment: although they've had a couple of long-range efforts,\n24:39 Comment: and Dostetov, which was just wide.\n24:41 Comment: They haven't created an awful lot, but they've been much better in possession.\n24:45 Comment: And really, for Moscow to win this game,\n24:47 Comment: they've got to do an awful lot better than they've done so far in this opening 25 minutes.\n24:51 Comment: Given away by the Swedish international, Wernbluh.\n24:57 Comment: Fernandes is looking for the free kick, and Gianluca Rocci,\n25:0 Comment: the Italian referee, wasn't convinced enough to award one.\n25:22 Comment: Milanov, nice little turn away from Kaliguri.\n25:24 Comment: A little bit of space ahead of him as well.\n25:26 Comment: In towards Moussa Zagorev.\n25:33 Comment: Benalio had that covered.\n25:36 Comment: Yeah, just bending away from the goals.\n25:37 Comment: He feels he should have had a corner there, but the referee's having none of it.\n25:43 Comment: But he didn't get close down, decided to get into the box,\n25:46 Comment: put the ball in.\n25:47 Comment: Poor clearance when it comes out to Zagorev.\n25:52 Comment: It's off target.\n25:53 Comment: Don't think there's much of a deflection there.\n25:57 Comment: But I'm just looking and saying, well, they don't score enough goals, CSK,\n26:1 Comment: but they've only scored one goal from open play in the Champions League,\n26:6 Comment: and I think they've shown us why so far in this opening 26, 27 minutes.\n26:10 Comment: They've not created enough.\n26:11 Comment: In that final third, they've got lots of pace,\n26:13 Comment: but they really don't get their heads up and pick people out\n26:16 Comment: and have control possession in and around the box as well.\n26:21 Comment: They haven't managed a goal away from home yet.\n26:25 Comment: Manchester United or Wolfsburg,\n26:26 Comment: which wouldn't all go well going to Eindhoven on matchday six\n26:30 Comment: if we're only flicking hope still alive.\n26:35 Comment: You can see the amount of possession that Wolfsburg have had there as the away team.\n26:39 Comment: Yeah, it's like they're the home team, basically.\n26:42 Comment: It feels that way, that Wolfsburg are the home team, dictating play,\n26:46 Comment: getting plenty of possession at the back, being able to play out from the back,\n26:49 Comment: get it into Arnold in the middle of the park, who's under no pressure.\n26:53 Comment: And it's Moscow who are trying to soak up pressure\n26:55 Comment: and then hit with their pace on the counter-attack,\n26:57 Comment: but they haven't done that well enough yet\n26:59 Comment: to cause many problems for Wolfsburg defensively.\n27:13 Comment: Good challenge by Fernandes.\n27:15 Comment: He thought so, the referee didn't.\n27:20 Comment: What colour he was reaching for there.\n27:22 Comment: It's a yellow for the Brazilian full-back.\n27:26 Comment: But once you slide in and you're out of control and your studs are showing,\n27:30 Comment: there's only one thing the referee's going to do, he's going to show you a card.\n27:34 Comment: It was high, but I think a yellow card is the right decision.\n27:38 Comment: He slides in, he gets some of the ball as well.\n27:41 Comment: I think that's what he was complaining, he's got the ball.\n27:44 Comment: But I think from the other angle, the referee's angle,\n27:46 Comment: it looked like the studs were up,\n27:48 Comment: so maybe Fernandes is unfortunate to get a yellow card there.\n27:52 Comment: You could see what Dieter Hacking's interpretation was.\n27:57 Comment: That's one of the things that you don't want to see going out of the game,\n28:0 Comment: tackling, it's an art, it's a skill.\n28:3 Comment: And Fernandes then maybe winning the ball,\n28:7 Comment: but nowadays a lot of referees, a lot of assistants give free kicks for that.\n28:12 Comment: My initial thought on it was that it was a yellow card,\n28:14 Comment: that he's gone in with the studs showing,\n28:16 Comment: but he hadn't, he's gone in with the right tackle,\n28:19 Comment: with the top of his boot rather than the bottom of his boot.\n28:37 Comment: Kamosky just looking for that little bit of creativity.\n28:41 Comment: There's a ball hitting home, no-winner Fernandes.\n28:48 Comment: And it's two and he did win it back.\n28:54 Comment: Beresutski's ball.\n28:57 Comment: It's very scrappy at the moment, neither team can get it down and make passes.\n29:1 Comment: This man, Arnold, has tried his best.\n29:4 Comment: This is where Wolfsburg look dangerous, play it backwards, play it sideways,\n29:7 Comment: and then where do they go?\n29:9 Comment: Have they got the ability to break Moscow down,\n29:11 Comment: who are sitting so deep at the moment?\n29:16 Comment: And it's a goal.\n29:23 Comment: They're so deep at the moment.\n29:32 Comment: Nalda.\n29:41 Comment: Gets it back from trash.\n29:44 Comment: As you can see, every single CSKA Moscow player back inside their own half.\n29:50 Comment: Back on the ball now with Moussa.\n29:56 Comment: Nababkin.\n30:8 Comment: Again, possession given away cheaply.\n30:12 Comment: Kaniguri.\n30:16 Comment: To pick out Schaefer.\n30:20 Comment: Not so sure Dante wanted that.\n30:22 Comment: He tried to recover the situation.\n30:25 Comment: And then his central defensive partner, Naldo, was able to assist.\n30:29 Comment: Naldo did really well there, he didn't switch off, he came round,\n30:32 Comment: covered on it, but it's a poor pass back to Dante.\n30:35 Comment: And Dante, you can see why in recent weeks in top games,\n30:39 Comment: why Dante was released by, or let go by Bayern Munich.\n30:42 Comment: He's lost that yard of pace, and when that was played to him,\n30:44 Comment: he's really lunging to try and get something on that.\n30:47 Comment: And Dumbia, with his pace, putting it under pressure.\n30:49 Comment: And Naldo did well to cover round.\n30:51 Comment: Here's Dost, trying to flick that into the path of Kruiser.\n30:56 Comment: Or as Zizki got back for CSKA.\n31:2 Comment: Cruddle reaction there from Wernblum on Kaniguri.\n31:9 Comment: I think the referee just being sensible on it,\n31:11 Comment: other referees would have come down, he's just given him a talking to,\n31:14 Comment: saying don't do that.\n31:15 Comment: Other referees could have, for this kick out here,\n31:18 Comment: would have given him a yellow card, and some would have given him\n31:20 Comment: a red card for that.\n31:21 Comment: So very fortunate.\n31:22 Comment: The referee, I think, has handled it extremely well.\n31:24 Comment: We don't want to see players sent off, but just telling the player\n31:27 Comment: calm down, there's no need for that.\n31:34 Comment: Barazudzki.\n31:38 Comment: Straight to Kaniguri, and cleared by Trash.\n31:46 Comment: You get to match day five of the Champions League,\n31:48 Comment: and the goal is so great of the knockout stages,\n31:51 Comment: it is all about points, but suffice to say,\n31:55 Comment: so far I've had the performance tonight.\n32:1 Comment: Well, that's the thing, I think, at this stage,\n32:3 Comment: it's about winning the game.\n32:5 Comment: You're absolutely right, Steve, it doesn't matter how you play,\n32:7 Comment: you want to win it, but so far tonight, I have to say,\n32:9 Comment: Moscow haven't shown us anything to suggest they can win this game.\n32:13 Comment: Wolfsburg maybe a little bit more, but they've really,\n32:16 Comment: in that final third, in the last 10, 15 minutes,\n32:19 Comment: have not created anything either, so it's a really open game still,\n32:23 Comment: and it's someone who's going to make a mistake,\n32:25 Comment: or a bit of brilliance which might open this game up even further.\n32:30 Comment: Moussa.\n32:32 Comment: He won't be too far away if there is a positive scenario\n32:37 Comment: ensuing for CSK Moscow.\n32:40 Comment: Here's Kaniguri for Wolfsburg, positive run from him,\n32:43 Comment: early from Schaefer, very nearly picking out Bas Dost,\n32:48 Comment: awkward one for Akinfeyev.\n32:51 Comment: Yeah, Akinfeyev let it go in the end, I think if Dost maybe slides in,\n32:55 Comment: if he slides in, he might have actually scored,\n32:58 Comment: because the goalkeeper says, OK, it's going wide,\n33:1 Comment: if he slid in, he might have found the back of the net there.\n33:5 Comment: But experienced goalkeeping, Akinfeyev just lets it roll across\n33:9 Comment: for a goal kick.\n33:13 Comment: First time in the whole match at either end,\n33:15 Comment: we've seen an enticing cross delivered into the penalty area.\n33:21 Comment: Dunbier.\n33:24 Comment: Quick one from Moussa, might come back to the Nigerian international.\n33:28 Comment: And he can only find the side netting.\n33:32 Comment: Yeah, but it's out of nothing, they get a chance, Moussa,\n33:35 Comment: with his pace, a little flick round the corner, breaks for him,\n33:37 Comment: takes it on his chest, keeps it down well on that left foot,\n33:40 Comment: but just can't hit the target.\n33:43 Comment: Goalkeeper's got it covered, it is near post.\n33:46 Comment: But that's better from CSK Moscow, something out of nothing.\n33:58 Comment: Now actually unbeaten in their last four European games at home.\n34:6 Comment: They've beaten PSV this season, they've held Manchester United.\n34:13 Comment: And it's all about the win really, as far as the home team are concerned tonight.\n34:18 Comment: Here's Tosic, peripheral figure so far, Milanov.\n34:24 Comment: Went down easily, and he didn't convince Gianluca Rocchi.\n34:30 Comment: But that was a free kick.\n34:31 Comment: He was looking for the free kick instead of being more positive,\n34:34 Comment: he's looking for the touch and going down,\n34:36 Comment: the referee wasn't having any of it.\n34:38 Comment: It's way to play on.\n34:43 Comment: Fiorina.\n34:51 Comment: Arnold.\n34:57 Comment: Again, every player from CSK Moscow back inside their own half.\n35:7 Comment: Ten minutes to half-time, Caliguri.\n35:14 Comment: In from Schaefer, Dost trying to get there, neatly done!\n35:18 Comment: The shot in the end from Kruiser, beaten away by Akinfeyev.\n35:21 Comment: That's the best move of the game, down the left-hand side.\n35:23 Comment: Dante playing it wide, good movement.\n35:28 Comment: Good change of passes, Schaefer's cross in, laid off by Dost.\n35:32 Comment: And there's the shot coming in from Kruiser.\n35:34 Comment: Comfortable save from the goalkeeper, puts it out for the corner.\n35:41 Comment: Which Schaefer is going to deliver for Wolfsburg.\n35:48 Comment: Made it clear comfortably.\n35:51 Comment: By CSK Moscow.\n36:1 Comment: Akinfeyev's save there is the first one we've had this evening.\n36:6 Comment: Straight at him, dealt with it well.\n36:8 Comment: We want to see more of that, it was the best move of the game so far from Wolfsburg.\n36:22 Comment: Here's Trash.\n36:26 Comment: Blocked by Wernblum.\n36:34 Comment: Schiele-Verghi.\n36:39 Comment: Schaefer couldn't keep it in, rather frustratingly.\n36:42 Comment: Well, he should have done better, it's a lovely pass out to him.\n36:45 Comment: Takes his eye off the ball.\n36:47 Comment: This is the counter-attack from CSK.\n36:53 Comment: Milanov looking for the free kick, doesn't get it.\n36:56 Comment: I think the referee's been very sensible the way he's refereed this game tonight.\n37:0 Comment: It is slippery on top, you're going to get challenges in.\n37:2 Comment: But he's not giving anything unless they're called for.\n37:10 Comment: Just the one attempt on target so far, eight minutes to half-time.\n37:15 Comment: And the Russian capital.\n37:20 Comment: Dost, unable to hold that one.\n37:24 Comment: Now Moussa.\n37:26 Comment: Dumbia, trying to return the favour.\n37:29 Comment: Across came Dante.\n37:31 Comment: Dante did well there, but Dumbia should have put more pace on it.\n37:34 Comment: If he puts more pace on it and puts it in front of Moussa there, he's in on goal.\n37:40 Comment: Here's Kaliguri.\n37:45 Comment: He's got it.\n37:51 Comment: Sloppy from Schaefer.\n37:53 Comment: Wernblum for CSKA.\n37:58 Comment: And it's nowhere near Ahmed Moussa.\n38:1 Comment: It's all getting a bit scrappy at the moment.\n38:4 Comment: Both teams giving the ball away cheaply.\n38:7 Comment: I know the conditions don't help, but these players are quality players,\n38:11 Comment: they've got to concentrate, movement's got to be there.\n38:14 Comment: I'm just surprised at the tactics.\n38:16 Comment: I just hope that Moscow change their tactics second half and are a bit more positive\n38:20 Comment: and squeeze the game higher up the park and make Wolfsburg play around them\n38:24 Comment: or catch them in possession.\n38:26 Comment: Fiorina had made the run, back in favour, read the situation.\n38:34 Comment: Now Babkin.\n38:37 Comment: Moussa fouled by Trash.\n38:42 Comment: He's the one that potentially can open the Wolfsburg door, isn't he?\n38:46 Comment: Moussa's got good pace, he can run with the ball.\n38:49 Comment: He doesn't get his head up enough for me when he's running with the ball.\n38:52 Comment: He's one of those players who's got to learn, get your head up, look for the passes.\n38:56 Comment: With his pace he's always going to cause problems, but he's got to have an end product as well.\n39:2 Comment: Fernandes.\n39:6 Comment: Had a look.\n39:7 Comment: Dumbia.\n39:9 Comment: Cleared by Naldo.\n39:14 Comment: No foul on Fernandes.\n39:18 Comment: Assertive cross of the arms from the Italian official.\n39:25 Comment: Fiorina.\n39:36 Comment: Still got five minutes to half-time, but it's looking to me like both teams are saying,\n39:49 Comment: well, come on, let's get to half-time and get warmed up in the dressing room again, have a drink.\n39:56 Comment: Arnold.\n39:58 Comment: From Wolfsburg's point of view,\n40:2 Comment: they will probably be expecting Manchester United to win tonight, in which case, a draw here.\n40:8 Comment: I'd have them a point ahead of PSV in second,\n40:13 Comment: and with progression in their own hands,\n40:16 Comment: going into matchday six,\n40:18 Comment: they play Manchester United at home.\n40:24 Comment: We know how strong they are at home as well, on their day at home they can beat anybody,\n40:28 Comment: as they've shown in the last few years, but here tonight, they must be saying to themselves,\n40:33 Comment: hey, we've got a chance here to win three points,\n40:35 Comment: and Moscow haven't really caused us that many problems,\n40:37 Comment: we've just got to be more clinical and more patient,\n40:40 Comment: and we've got to be more patient and more patient and more patient,\n40:45 Comment: and Moscow haven't really caused us that many problems,\n40:47 Comment: we've just got to be more clinical and more precise in the final third.\n40:53 Comment: Here's Trash, into Fiorentina.\n41:0 Comment: Cruises delivery blocked by Nabamkin.\n41:9 Comment: Another Wolfsburg throw.\n41:16 Comment: And once more.\n41:25 Comment: Deeper one from Trash.\n41:27 Comment: Off the head of Fernandes, Wolfsburg corner.\n41:30 Comment: Well that's a better ball from Trash there, he's put him,\n41:33 Comment: a ball with plenty of height on it, looking for Dost, he overhits it,\n41:35 Comment: Fernandes deals with it at the back post, but it's out for the corner,\n41:38 Comment: and really, that's what Wolfsburg need to do more of,\n41:41 Comment: they're having this possession, but they've got to put a ball in the back post,\n41:44 Comment: but they've got to put a ball in the box now and again,\n41:46 Comment: to give that man a chance to get on the end of it.\n41:52 Comment: So Dost waits, Dante and Maldow in there as well.\n41:57 Comment: Schaefer with the Wolfsburg corner.\n42:0 Comment: Didn't reach Dost, and then the volley from Caliguri.\n42:5 Comment: I don't know what Caliguri was doing there, he could have just played it back wide,\n42:9 Comment: to the corner take up, keep the pressure on.\n42:12 Comment: That was the pass from Schaefer that put Dante in trouble.\n42:16 Comment: Yeah, very fortunate there to get away with it, Dante with his lack of pace,\n42:19 Comment: Dumbia with his pace getting on the end of it,\n42:22 Comment: but Ronaldo covered round really well, and Schaefer in the last 15 minutes or so\n42:26 Comment: has let the ball go under his foot, he's given possession away,\n42:29 Comment: and I think it all stems from that mistake he made there,\n42:31 Comment: which nearly gave the goal away.\n42:33 Comment: Seems to have lost his confidence a little bit,\n42:35 Comment: and now he's given three kicks away as well.\n42:41 Comment: That one on Tosic.\n42:55 Comment: Schaefer once more.\n43:1 Comment: Masevic with the header clear.\n43:11 Comment: 36 years of age now, Masevic.\n43:15 Comment: 11 years at the club, goes all the way back to his goalkeeper.\n43:31 Comment: Zaghaev,\n43:33 Comment: dispossessed by Villarino.\n43:35 Comment: Now Shilo Voghi for Wolfsburg.\n43:37 Comment: A little over a minute of normal time remaining in the first half,\n43:40 Comment: Caliguri showed too much of that to Fernandez.\n43:52 Comment: Schaefer thinks better of the back pass on that occasion.\n44:8 Comment: Neatly done by Mario Fernandez.\n44:12 Comment: The ball intended for Dumbia,\n44:15 Comment: might still be alive with Milanov.\n44:20 Comment: Zaghaev,\n44:23 Comment: that's a goal kick to Wolfsburg.\n44:25 Comment: Well that just sums up Moscow's first half, I think.\n44:30 Comment: Zaghaev's cross,\n44:32 Comment: poor cross goes straight out of play for a goal kick when they're in a good position.\n44:36 Comment: I think the managers can't wait to get their teams in at half time and go through a few things.\n44:41 Comment: Because this game is here for the taking for either of these sides.\n44:44 Comment: It looks more like Wolfsburg, the way they've passed the ball around without creating an awful lot.\n44:49 Comment: They look the more capable team, but this game is still wide open.\n44:53 Comment: And at half time I think the managers can get in there, the players change a few things, especially Moscow.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Wolfsburg moving, and remember a draw would technically keep CSK Moscow\n0:5 Comment: still potentially in the hunt, but really it is a victory that they need, and I'll ask you the same\n0:15 Comment: question as I did at the beginning of the game, would you expect a more positive approach from\n0:18 Comment: the host Nigel now? Well this is, the way they played in the first half is the way they played\n0:23 Comment: against Manchester United here, and I think they've played most of their games that way,\n0:27 Comment: trying to soak up pressure and hit on the counter-attack, even at home with the pace they\n0:31 Comment: have in it, but I just think if they want to win this game, they've got to change it tactically,\n0:35 Comment: they might stick the same way now, but you know, in the next 20 minutes or so, they've got to say\n0:41 Comment: okay, let's change it, let's really go for it, and try and squeeze the game higher up the pitch,\n0:47 Comment: but I'm not so sure they are capable of actually doing that Moscow.\n0:53 Comment: That's a good ball from Kruiser, offside flag again up,\n0:57 Comment: there is Vazin, a 26-year-old substitute, and cleared by Akinfeyev, off the head of Nalda,\n1:18 Comment: Tosic, Dumbia, crossing opportunity now for Fernandes, four in the penalty area,\n1:26 Comment: couldn't beat the first half,\n1:27 Comment: first defender Gilles Verghese,\n1:34 Comment: foot in there from Schäfer, but also from Wernblue, then Tosic, Dumbia,\n1:43 Comment: Dante's clearance,\n1:46 Comment: this is a little more positive from the host, Agaev,\n1:51 Comment: and then Moussa stopped by Trash.\n1:53 Comment: Maybe they have changed their tactics, it looks a lot more positive as you said,\n1:57 Comment: they are squeezing the game higher up, they have got this corner,\n2:0 Comment: so maybe they score their first goal in the second half of Champions League football this season,\n2:6 Comment: you never know.\n2:7 Comment: Certainly since they need to.\n2:12 Comment: It's Agaev's corner, disappointing one, had it cleared by Bastost,\n2:17 Comment: fouled by Kruiser.\n2:26 Comment: Kruiser just going in a bit,\n2:27 Comment: too tight,\n2:28 Comment: little push there,\n2:30 Comment: and this is a good situation now,\n2:32 Comment: they just had the corner,\n2:33 Comment: now they've got a really good opportunity from this free kick,\n2:36 Comment: to push the big men up,\n2:38 Comment: it's all about the delivery again,\n2:40 Comment: put a decent ball in there.\n2:50 Comment: Alain Segoev,\n2:51 Comment: who scored against Wolfsburg back in 2009,\n2:57 Comment: with a delivery,\n2:58 Comment: a punch from Bernalio,\n3:0 Comment: and there's a pail down in Wernbloom,\n3:3 Comment: inside the six yard box.\n3:7 Comment: Bernalio was claiming a free kick there himself as well,\n3:11 Comment: this is a much better ball in,\n3:13 Comment: no offside,\n3:15 Comment: Kieber comes and punches it,\n3:17 Comment: nothing wrong with that,\n3:19 Comment: punches it,\n3:21 Comment: and as it comes back in,\n3:23 Comment: the shot comes back in, he dives for it and saves it with his foot rather than his hands, but,\n3:27 Comment: it's a good bit of pressure at the start of the second half for Moscow.\n3:30 Comment: Wernbloom back on his feet,\n3:32 Comment: back in that penalty area for the corner,\n3:35 Comment: to be delivered by the same man,\n3:37 Comment: Segoev,\n3:38 Comment: towards that near post,\n3:40 Comment: cleared by Dost,\n3:42 Comment: Tosic.\n3:50 Comment: One of those teams,\n3:52 Comment: going to be a fit for CSKA Moscow,\n3:55 Comment: who,\n3:56 Comment: brought on Vazin at half time,\n3:59 Comment: Wolfsburg without,\n4:1 Comment: Luis Gustavo,\n4:3 Comment: Draxler not in the squad through injury,\n4:5 Comment: Scheller,\n4:7 Comment: amongst the substitutes available for Dieter Hacking and,\n4:11 Comment: Nikolas Bentner, who,\n4:15 Comment: is on the bench as well.\n4:18 Comment: Yeah, they've got Bentner who's scored a few goals,\n4:21 Comment: coming off the bench,\n4:24 Comment: recently,\n4:26 Comment: but,\n4:27 Comment: really can't get in,\n4:28 Comment: in the starting line-out, that's for sure.\n4:30 Comment: It's given away by Arnold to Moussa,\n4:32 Comment: Segoev,\n4:34 Comment: Moussa,\n4:35 Comment: unable to take that on his stride and keep it in.\n4:38 Comment: But the other surprising thing is that,\n4:40 Comment: Scheller, that big money move from Chelsea,\n4:43 Comment: back to,\n4:44 Comment: German football with Wolfsburg and,\n4:46 Comment: can't get in the team,\n4:47 Comment: and then you thought when De Bruyne moved on to,\n4:50 Comment: Man City, he would get in the team and,\n4:52 Comment: still not shown that,\n4:53 Comment: quality that he has,\n4:55 Comment: hopefully he'll get back to that,\n4:56 Comment: very soon,\n4:57 Comment: because Wolfsburg could do with him.\n4:59 Comment: And,\n5:0 Comment: Traxler, as we've all touched on,\n5:1 Comment: you know,\n5:2 Comment: over the last couple of seasons had a lot of injuries,\n5:4 Comment: but a quality player as well, but,\n5:6 Comment: they've all got the European Championships to,\n5:8 Comment: look forward to, trying,\n5:9 Comment: get in this team at Wolfsburg and,\n5:11 Comment: then get into the German national team for the,\n5:14 Comment: Euros.\n5:17 Comment: That's played by Schiller-Foege,\n5:21 Comment: he knows deep down he needs a goal.\n5:25 Comment: That was,\n5:26 Comment: Traxler's solo goal,\n5:29 Comment: back in September that won it for,\n5:31 Comment: Dieter Hecking's team,\n5:33 Comment: in Germany,\n5:34 Comment: that was all that separated,\n5:36 Comment: the two in their first meeting in Group B.\n5:41 Comment: Here's Caliguri,\n5:44 Comment: Kruiser,\n5:47 Comment: nicely weighted pass,\n5:48 Comment: into the path of Schaefer,\n5:50 Comment: Bastos waiting,\n5:52 Comment: Fernandes in the way,\n5:53 Comment: Wolfsburg corner.\n5:55 Comment: Fernandes did well, got across,\n5:56 Comment: but,\n5:57 Comment: just wanted to show you could have played that first time,\n5:59 Comment: it's a lovely ball played to him,\n6:0 Comment: between the,\n6:1 Comment: centre back and the right back,\n6:3 Comment: could he have played it first time in there for,\n6:5 Comment: Dost,\n6:6 Comment: but Fernandes came across,\n6:7 Comment: has led to this corner,\n6:9 Comment: for Wolfsburg.\n6:18 Comment: Once again the Cavalry are forward for it,\n6:23 Comment: didn't reach any of them,\n6:24 Comment: comfortably cleared by Mario Fernandes,\n6:29 Comment: who intercepts again,\n6:32 Comment: then finds Moussa,\n6:37 Comment: now Babkin,\n6:40 Comment: Mission International, Zagoweth,\n6:47 Comment: that should add a play by Christian Trasch,\n6:51 Comment: Zagoweth has got to do better with that pass there,\n6:53 Comment: he's got no pressure on him,\n6:54 Comment: trying to clip it in over the top,\n6:56 Comment: this was his free kick in,\n6:59 Comment: goalkeeper comes for it bravely,\n7:1 Comment: Benaglio,\n7:3 Comment: and then makes the save,\n7:5 Comment: so it's been a brighter start to the second half.\n7:8 Comment: Milanov,\n7:9 Comment: trying to step past Dante,\n7:11 Comment: Schaefer mopping up for Wolfsburg,\n7:16 Comment: last a little more intent,\n7:18 Comment: from the home team,\n7:19 Comment: Tosic,\n7:30 Comment: cleared by Dante.\n7:34 Comment: Zoran Tosic once more,\n7:35 Comment: the Serbian international,\n7:38 Comment: to Zagoweth,\n7:39 Comment: Good interception there from Arnold\n7:51 Comment: That's a handball\n7:56 Comment: by Caliguri\n7:58 Comment: Caliguri there\n8:0 Comment: the bounce of the ball did him\n8:2 Comment: but it's a chance of a really good counter-attack here for Wolfsburg\n8:7 Comment: but off his side, onto his arm, it's handball\n8:10 Comment: and Wolfsburg have really just got to get hold of the ball again now\n8:14 Comment: CSK have started really well this second half\n8:16 Comment: Wolfsburg need to get back to their passing and movement\n8:19 Comment: Moussa\n8:23 Comment: Moussa presumably initially was looking for Doonbeer\n8:30 Comment: I don't know what he was trying to do there\n8:33 Comment: I have to say\n8:34 Comment: Moussa's come inside, you look inside\n8:36 Comment: can you pick?\n8:37 Comment: Moussa, Doonbeer out\n8:37 Comment: can you have the shot yourself?\n8:39 Comment: I think in the end\n8:40 Comment: I think that was a shot\n8:42 Comment: and he got it horribly wrong\n8:43 Comment: Cilavone\n8:57 Comment: given away cheaply by Danta\n9:7 Comment: Cagaih couldn't quite get there ahead of Malde\n9:12 Comment: Viorena for Wolfsburg\n9:14 Comment: Arnold\n9:20 Comment: Wolfsburg corner\n9:28 Comment: can they get the delivery right for one of these?\n9:32 Comment: Well that's what they've got to do\n9:32 Comment: you've got to miss that man on the near\n9:34 Comment: on the near post\n9:35 Comment: you've got to give the likes of Dante and Dost\n9:37 Comment: a chance and now though they're all coming up you've got to put the ball\n9:41 Comment: with a bit of height in it away from the goalkeeper and attack the ball but\n9:45 Comment: you've got to make sure you miss that first man on the near post here I'd say\n9:50 Comment: the delivery from set plays have been really poor from both teams\n9:56 Comment: can it get any better here for Wolfsburg slightly but headed away by Wernblum\n10:3 Comment: now Moussa cleverly done Dumbier is up in support that's who he's looking for\n10:11 Comment: Trach with a very well timed challenge Trach did extremely well there he bided\n10:17 Comment: his time and had to slide in for it didn't commit himself too early it was\n10:21 Comment: really good defensive play from Trach there but again Moscow showing how\n10:26 Comment: dangerous with Moussa and Dumbier on the counter-attack with their pace and their\n10:31 Comment: movement this is when they look really dangerous\n10:33 Comment: you\n10:33 Comment: go\n10:45 Comment: Gilles-Lavogne\n10:50 Comment: here's Trach in a more attacking role Trach couldn't beat\n10:57 Comment: the Babkin but that's better for Wolfsburg down the right hand side\n11:0 Comment: getting four players into the box they're really now\n11:3 Comment: going for it to try and win this game as well so the game is really opening up\n11:7 Comment: we're still lacking that little bit of quality in and around the 18 yard box\n11:15 Comment: the arena was offside on that occasion\n11:26 Comment: last season's Champions League campaign came to an end for CSK Moscow against\n11:31 Comment: German opposition beaten by Bayern which was no disgrace at the time\n11:38 Comment: Wolfsburg win here exactly the same thing will happen to them\n11:44 Comment: there's still no real clear sighting of goal for either team\n11:56 Comment: four teams in Group B before matchday five separated by just\n12:1 Comment: the first half of the season and they're up 2-0 up to the last of the season to win the game\n12:1 Comment: three points remember Manchester United PSV to come later on from all traffic in this group\n12:9 Comment: trash with the ball in it'll drop to Arnold that was a better try from Max Arnold\n12:21 Comment: good skill from Arnold as well it's a difficult ball to control he gets it\n12:25 Comment: down and then hits it with his left foot keeps it down really well but Akinfeov what is it?\n12:31 Comment: all the way comfortable state for him in the end\n12:41 Comment: Fernandes\n12:47 Comment: no foul by Fernandes\n12:56 Comment: Moussa\n13:1 Comment: , he's got a good shot\n13:3 Comment: the quality of the passing hasn't improved his van bloem\n13:7 Comment: Boom beer\n13:9 Comment: Tosic wanted it, it was Milonov who had the shot in the end and it's a CSK Moscow corner\n13:16 Comment: yeah good pressure much higher up the park from CSK Moscow there's Fernandes who won the ball initially\n13:21 Comment: the shot comes in from Zagayev, it's deflected to the corner so asking a few questions now of Wolfsburg defensively in the game is going to be tough for them\n13:24 Comment: Fernandes who won the ball initially the shot comes in from Zagayev, he's deflected to the corner so asking a few questions now of Wolfsburg defensively in the game is going to be tough for them\n13:30 Comment: the game is end-to-end counter-attacking from both teams\n13:37 Comment: Tosic with the corner\n13:39 Comment: comfortable attack for Benalia\n13:42 Comment: quick throw as well nowhere near Dost\n13:46 Comment: yeah the delivery from the set play again from the corner there is far too\n13:49 Comment: much height on it not enough pace on it the goalkeeper\n13:52 Comment: comfortable save and then he panics and kicks it up the field really to settle\n13:56 Comment: things back down he's giving possession away again but it looks like surely the goalkeeper is going to be a bit more aggressive than he was before\n13:58 Comment: again but it looks like surely the goalkeeper is going to be a bit more aggressive than he was before\n14:0 Comment: Mike Schur is going to come on for Wolfsburg hopefully he can liven things up and maybe get a goal which when he's at Chelsea scored plenty of goals for them\n14:9 Comment: but spent too little time on the pitch\n14:15 Comment: Dumbia\n14:18 Comment: he's

from there\n14:45 Comment: Van Blum he could have kept it going out\n14:47 Comment: I think he's going to score from there to the right-hand side to Fernandes there\n14:49 Comment: to the right-hand side to Fernandes there but\n14:50 Comment: but good play from Dumbia\n14:53 Comment: with the shot in from\n14:56 Comment: distance from the room but not good enough this is Dumbia's goal\n14:59 Comment: with the shot in from the room but not good enough this is Dumbia's goal\n15:1 Comment: showing his trickery and his skill and his strength\n15:5 Comment: but this is going to be an important

it\n20:8 Comment: and I think when the tackle comes in it's a good tackle but I think it's just\n20:11 Comment: a court with the back of the hand from the defender as he makes the challenge\n20:14 Comment: and that's why he's gone down and see it here more clearly he turns on it just a\n20:21 Comment: little shoulder into the side of the head and those are a nasty one\n20:24 Comment: especially when you've just come in you've been not warmed up properly yet\n20:28 Comment: and just there catches him on the side of the head that's a nasty one\n20:31 Comment: it's very suits keep\n20:36

Akinfeyev\n21:54 Comment: really that's an own goal because that's going wide and he's knocked into the\n21:58 Comment: back of his net but Shirley won't mind Wolfsburg won't mind Hickling won't mind\n22:3 Comment: it's put them in the box seat here one nil up against the run of play he can't\n22:10 Comment: believe his luck Igor Akinfeyev for the 36th Champions\n22:15 Comment: League game in a row won't keep a clean sheet and this one is all his own doing\n22:20 Comment: yeah from that angle really he's got to do better but it's going wide from\n22:24 Comment: Shirley but really Shirley was gifted the chance to take on the shot in the\n22:28 Comment: first place for defending from CSK Moscow and then the goalkeeper Akinfeyev\n22:34 Comment: has gifted him the goal Tosic went to ground easily too easily for the Italian\n22:39 Comment: referees like that\n22:40 Comment: kick that goal less than five minutes after Tosic had hit the woodwork\n22:46 Comment: defining moments at

deserved a goal but it didn't end up in the back of\n22:58 Comment: the net and then suddenly on the counter-attack Shirley gets the\n23:3 Comment: opportunity and it's 1-0\n23:10 Comment: I'm sure Shirley will try and claim that goal not so sure it will be credited to\n23:19 Comment: him but Wolfsburg won't mind because as it stands they're top of Group B two\n23:24 Comment: points clear of Manchester United who take on PSV remember later this evening\n23:30 Comment: at Old Trafford and it would be a scoreline that would put CSK Moscow out\n23:36 Comment: of the Champions League at the group stage for the third season running for the third season running.\n23:40 Comment: Unless they can find a goal in the remaining 21 minutes\n23:47 Comment: Tosic Mooses onside can he get it across into the arms of Bernalio off the\n23:55 Comment: leg of Zagoweth I have to say they're riding their luck a little bit\n24:1 Comment: Wolfsburg and the one that hit the post from Tosic into the goalkeepers arms\n24:6 Comment: Shirley's goal or the goalkeeper's goal\n24:10 Comment: I should say and then that one there that could have gone anywhere and ends\n24:13 Comment: up back in the goalkeepers arms Bernalio picks that one up but it's all\n24:18 Comment: going Wolfsburg's way at the moment this is Mooses fires it across hits the\n24:26 Comment: defender and straight into the goalkeepers arms could have got ended up\n24:28 Comment: in the back of the net Zagoweth could have had a chance in on goal if the\n24:33 Comment: defender hadn't got on it\n24:37 Comment: Is Schaefer in advanced position we've tried to roll that off the net.\n24:39 Comment: It's a good chance for Wolfsburg to get the ball in the net.\n24:40 Comment: into dust\n24:44 Comment: just come back to Akinfeyev 94th game in Europe over 85 Russian caps 12\n24:52 Comment: years the number one at CSK Moscow can happen to the best of them yeah it can\n24:58 Comment: happen to the best but Akinfeyev has nobody else to blame but himself really\n25:3 Comment: because the shot was actually going wide he's down on it and really gets it\n25:7 Comment: horribly wrong\n25:9 Comment: and the ball is going to the left and one can rescue it at the other end Moosa\n25:12 Comment: blocked on that occasion 20 minutes to save their Champions League season here\n25:17 Comment: CSK Moscow\n25:20 Comment: Scherler in space Bastos up with him Scherler went alone it might still fall\n25:26 Comment: to Kruiser and Akinfeyev had read that situation quickly\n25:30 Comment: Akinfeyev did really well there but can't make up for their own goal but\n25:34 Comment: Scherler brought some energy into the Wolfsburg team he's running in behind the back four on the left side of the net.\n25:37 Comment: He's running in behind the back four on the left side of the net.\n25:39 Comment: On this opportunity should be picking out Dost or Kruise who's making the run he\n25:43 Comment: takes the shot on but at least he's giving them legs and running in behind\n25:47 Comment: and stretching the back four of CSK Moscow\n26:4 Comment: Viorena with the Wolfsburg corner\n26:9 Comment: towards Naldo won by Berezinski\n26:13 Comment: Milunov\n26:16 Comment: that is Scherler back to dispossess him\n26:18 Comment: that was a brilliant tackle from Scherler as well but this game is really opened up now\n26:23 Comment: Viorena thought he was offside there which is why he didn't try and latch on to the pass from Kruise\n26:34 Comment: What a position potentially Wolfsburg are in here\n26:37 Comment: Well if they win this\n26:39 Comment: The pressure goes on to Manchester United and PSV in the later kick off\n26:45 Comment: It just heightens the importance of the game really from Manchester United's point of view\n26:50 Comment: Dost is offside\n26:53 Comment: And a reminder all the build up to this evening's Champions League games the ones remaining with Gary Lineker and the team from 6.30 on BT Sport Europe\n27:2 Comment: with Champions League tonight featuring Juventus against Manchester City BT Sport 2 from 7 as Manchester City have won the game\n27:7 Comment: With Manchester City against

end on BT Sport Europe\n27:24 Comment: A big surprise for Manchester United\n27:28 Comment: Now is Nacho the Israel international\n27:37 Comment: rival is imminent from CSKA's point of view. Zagov.\n27:44 Comment: Shilofoge did well. Now the Russians have to take chances and they run the risk at\n27:49 Comment: the other end of being exploited.\n28:0 Comment: Dost.\n28:7 Comment: For Akinfeyev now you're desperately hoping something happens at the other end. You do\n28:15 Comment: not want the game and ultimately his team's Champions League campaign to be settled by\n28:21 Comment: that moment.\n28:22 Comment: No, but that's where goalkeepers, if they make a mistake, it's normally crucial. He's\n28:26 Comment: made that mistake, Akinfeyev, and it's cost his team so far. But can they get back into\n28:31 Comment: it? So far in the second half, they've looked a lot brighter than they have in the first\n28:36 Comment: half, but they haven't really accepted it.\n28:37 Comment: I think for that tossage goal had a clear-cut opportunity.\n28:40 Comment: Can't play Ronaldo. Early from Dante. Schürrle trying to get onto it.\n28:49 Comment: Basing just back in the nick of time.\n28:54 Comment: Well if Schürrle has a better touch there, he really is through. It's between the two\n28:57 Comment: centre-backs. Got his touch wrong and allowed the defender to get back on him. But he's\n29:1 Comment: come on, brought energy, and that's now what Moscow need. They need a substitution here\n29:6 Comment: from Nacho.\n29:7 Comment: To bring on something special for them to try and get back in this game.\n29:11 Comment: It's the left back, a Bamkin who's being sacrificed.\n29:14 Comment: Nacho, the midfield player, 27 years of age, in his second season in Russia. He actually\n29:23 Comment: started the game against Wolfsburg in Germany in September.\n29:27 Comment: A little over a quarter of an hour for the Russians to rescue this.\n29:34 Comment: It's a good ball.\n29:37 Comment: And he has it.\n29:38 Comment: Well, it's going to be a very, very good ball.\n29:39 Comment: It's a good ball.\n29:44 Comment: No foul on Tosic. Again, referee happy for the advantage to be applied.\n29:53 Comment: Nacho.\n29:54 Comment: To Goev.\n29:55 Comment: So congested in that central area.\n30:0 Comment: Yes, there's so many players in there, CSK Moscow players and Wolfsburg players, but,\n30:5 Comment: you know, they're so congested.\n30:6 Comment: players but really they've got to try and get the ball\n30:9 Comment: wide now Moscow and get\n30:10 Comment: crosses into the box, they're trying to play through the middle\n30:13 Comment: where Dante is very strong\n30:15 Comment: Naldo is very strong in there, they've really\n30:17 Comment: got to get it into wide and get crosses into the\n30:19 Comment: box, that's Tosic\n30:21 Comment: who's taking a dive there\n30:22 Comment: Schaefer's challenge came in but\n30:25 Comment: it didn't touch him, dives but\n30:26 Comment: the thing is now for Wolfsburg is the more\n30:29 Comment: Moscow, CSK Moscow\n30:30 Comment: push forward, it leaves the back door\n30:33 Comment: open for them, have they got the quality to\n30:35 Comment: go and get that second goal now\n30:36 Comment: I just wonder if\n30:48 Comment: Wolfsburg are looking, heckling are looking\n30:50 Comment: and say well do I take Dostov\n30:52 Comment: and bring Bentner on\n30:54 Comment: give me some fresh legs up front\n30:56 Comment: but does Bentner get hold of the ball enough\n30:59 Comment: and retain possession for you\n31:0 Comment: and allow the midfield players to break forward\n31:3 Comment: I'm not so sure\n31:3 Comment: ...\n31:26 Comment: .\n31:31 Comment: Zagovic\n31:33 Comment: breakdown the community\n31:36 Comment: Great evening everyone\n31:36 Comment: throwing stuff to everyday people\n31:36 Comment: Communication with Moussa.\n31:38 Comment: Strong challenge on Dost.\n31:41 Comment: Yeah, Dost did well there.\n31:42 Comment: He knew the challenge was coming in,\n31:43 Comment: so he took the touch and allowed the defender to come through him, really.\n31:47 Comment: That's there.\n31:47 Comment: Gets the free kick.\n31:48 Comment: Relieves the pressure on his team.\n31:51 Comment: Good play from the big centre-forward.\n32:6 Comment: Moussa.\n32:13 Comment: Pass in.\n32:25 Comment: Tito Hacking.\n32:28 Comment: Playing the second change.\n32:29 Comment: It isn't Bentner.\n32:31 Comment: Doesn't want to change in this scoreline, though.\n32:34 Comment: Well, Hacking knows that he's got to get it out there.\n32:36 Comment: Right tactically tonight, because, you know,\n32:39 Comment: four defeats in five away games in the Champions League.\n32:42 Comment: Obviously, he's tried things and they haven't worked.\n32:44 Comment: Tonight, they've won new up against Moscow here.\n32:47 Comment: Now he's got to make those substitutions\n32:49 Comment: and make sure his team wins and gets the three points out of this.\n32:55 Comment: Arnold.\n32:57 Comment: Into Schürrle.\n33:6 Comment: Given away by Max Arnold.\n33:12 Comment: Moussa.\n33:19 Comment: It is now or never, as far as CSK Moscow are concerned, in the Champions League.\n33:29 Comment: They need a goal.\n33:31 Comment: Fernandes.\n33:33 Comment: Trying to play the one-two as a goal.\n33:35 Comment: He's got there, Fernandes.\n33:36 Comment: Good challenge by Arnold.\n33:40 Comment: There's the Brazilian full-back again.\n33:43 Comment: Sheila Foggy.\n33:45 Comment: Went in with the challenge.\n33:46 Comment: It was a good challenge as well, and the referee was right on top of that.\n33:49 Comment: Saw it was a good challenge.\n33:57

    "summary": "On a freezing night in Moscow, with temperatures barely above zero, CSKA Moscow fought desperately to keep their Champions League dreams alive against a confident Wolfsburg side. The pivotal match commenced with a sense of urgency, especially for the hosts, who knew that anything less than a win would end their European journey for the season.\n\nThe match began with Wolfsburg showcasing the form that saw them thrash Werder Bremen 6-0 in the Bundesliga over the weekend. They started brightly, knocking the ball around with purpose. The absence of Luiz Gustavo due to injury was the only significant change for them, with Josuha Guilavogui stepping into midfield. On the other hand, CSKA Moscow had Seydou Doumbia, who had passed a late fitness test, a crucial inclusion given his significance in the team's performances this season. The home side was missing key player Vasili Berezutski at the heart of their defense, leaving his twin brother Aleksei to marshal the backline.\n\nFrom the outset, Wolfsburg executed a deliberate-game plan. They absorbed pressure, confident in their ability to strike effectively on the counter-attack. Early on, they managed to create opportunities through quick breaks, notably when Daniel Caligiuri broke free, though support was slow to arrive. Moscow, trying to exploit the pace and creativity of Ahmed Musa and Zoran Tosic, found it difficult to penetrate a well-organized Wolfsburg defense.\n\nAs the first half progressed, Wolfsburg's midfield, well-orchestrated by Maximilian Arnold, controlled the tempo. Although CSKA tried to build momentum, their attacks often broke down due to Wolfsburg's defensive solidity. The match saw its share of physicality, with intense challenges, particularly from Mario Fernandes, who rendered crucial interceptions and forward runs.\n\nThe game grew scrappy midway through the first half, with neither side able to build fluid passages of play. CSKA's best efforts came through individual brilliance rather than cohesive team movements. Wolfsburg, while dominant in possession, struggled to apply the final decisive ball. Attacks frequently fizzled out either due to misplaced passes or sturdy defensive interventions. Notably, Wolfsburg's crosses, aimed primarily at Bas Dost, were dealt with efficiently by Moscow's defense.\n\nAs halftime approached, Wolfsburg nearly capitalized on their well-constructed plays. Dost came close on a couple of occasions but was unable to convert. The highlight of the half from Wolfsburg was a neatly executed move down the left side, ending with Kruise's shot being saved expertly by Igor Akinfeev. CSKA Moscow, on the other hand, looked devoid of ideas, as their key players struggled to impose themselves on the game. The half ended goalless, with Wolfsburg appearing more likely to break the deadlock.\n\nThe second half saw a discernible shift in Moscow's approach. They began pressing higher up the pitch and created early pressure on the Wolfsburg defense. This change nearly paid dividends as Moscow earned corners and free-kicks in dangerous positions. From one such set-piece, a well-delivered ball by Alan Dzagoev was punched clear by Diego Benaglio, maintaining Wolfsburg's clean sheet.\n\nTensions in the match escalated as CSKA pushed forward. Musa and Doumbia combined well, but their efforts were either blocked or saved, illustrating the team's difficulties in making the most of their opportunities. Wolfsburg, in turn, started to exploit the spaces left by the advancing Russians. \n\nSubstitute André Schürrle made a significant impact upon his introduction; however, Wolfsburg's breakthrough came through an unfortunate error. A long ball over the top saw Schürrle get behind the defense. Although his initial effort seemed to be going wide, Akinfeev's attempt to save redirected the ball into his own net, awarding Wolfsburg the lead in a bizarre turn of events.\n\nThis goal proved a turning point, clearly knocking the wind out of CSKA. Despite their efforts, evident through Tosic's agonizing strike against the post, the home side couldn't capitalize. As the game opened up further, Wolfsburg looked increasingly dangerous on the break.\n\nIn the final quarter of the match, Wolfsburg sealed the victory. Schürrle, full of running and positive play, delivered a fantastic cross from the right, finding the back of the net from close range. His second goal of the night was a display of precision and composure, effectively ending CSKA’s resistance.\n\nThe closing moments saw Wolfsburg play with newfound confidence, maintaining control and nullifying any Moscow attempts to claw back into the game. Even a late cameo by Kirill Panchenko couldn’t change the outcome for CSKA Moscow. As the final whistle blew, Wolfsburg's 2-0 victory was a testament to their tactical discipline and clinical execution.\n\nCSKA Moscow now faces the bleak reality of another early exit from the Champions League. An unfortunate own goal by their captain and goalkeeper Akinfeev was a crucial moment, symbolizing the fine margins in top-level football. For Wolfsburg, the win puts them in a commanding position in Group B, leading the group temporarily and putting pressure on Manchester United and PSV ahead of their clash.\n\nThe match provided a comprehensive look at two teams with contrasting fortunes; Wolfsburg’s steady rise in confidence underpinned by their disciplined gameplay and CSKA's struggle to replicate their domestic form on the European stage. As Wolfsburg marched towards the knockout stages with renewed vigor, CSKA Moscow was left to ponder what might have been in a season of near misses.\n\nThe game in Moscow revealed the stark realities of football at the highest level — where moments of brilliance, tactical astuteness, and sometimes, an opponent's error, define the outcome. Wolfsburg’s journey continues with optimism, while CSKA must return to the drawing board to calibrate their strategies for future continental challenges."
