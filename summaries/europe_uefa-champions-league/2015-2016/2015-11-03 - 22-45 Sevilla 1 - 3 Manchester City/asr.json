tonight, if City become the first English team ever to win on this ground\n0:14 Comment: and Juventus avoid defeat in Mönchengladbach\n0:18 Comment: then the thick end of Group B's business will be polished off with two games to spare\n0:23 Comment: City would be through, they'd fly home without a care in the world\n0:27 Comment: but let's face it, City are more habitually in tune with edge of the seat melodrama than smoothness and comfort of passage\n0:35 Comment: and Roby this could be another edgy night\n0:38 Comment: certainly could be, I think it's a big night for Fernando and Fernandinho in the middle of the park\n0:43 Comment: just stay disciplined, protect your back floor, there's no need for you to go anywhere\n0:47 Comment: just play sensible football and let the front four attack\n0:51 Comment: Navas\n0:54 Comment: caught up by Llorente\n0:56 Comment: given back to Van Aert\n0:57 Comment: Fernandinho who had an instinctive thump and wasn't so very far away\n1:5 Comment: he's on the front foot, Fernandinho, you know, wasn't a great strike\n1:11 Comment: positive start for Manchester City\n1:19 Comment: interesting start, Peter, that not one of these outfield players for Manchester City in this year's\n1:24 Comment: Champions League has scored a goal\n1:27 Comment: it's true, City have benefited from a couple of own goals\n1:32 Comment: it has been, as I say, a melodramatic campaign so far\n1:36 Comment: of wins from behind and a defeat indeed from in front\n1:41 Comment: here's Wilfred Bonny\n1:43 Comment: and he's a yard the wrong side of the other post\n1:47 Comment: yeah again it's Fernandinho who's getting forward, you know, from that central area\n1:53 Comment: you know, he's breaking up play, that Bonny there on his favourite side of the post\n1:55 Comment: Bonny there on his favourite right foot\n1:59 Comment: just wasn't a clean strike\n2:2 Comment: keep around it, covered as you can see\n2:5 Comment: Bonny who's received a fair degree of public support from his manager over the last 48 hours or so\n2:10 Comment: after an exasperating Saturday afternoon\n2:13 Comment: full of shots off target\n2:16 Comment: Ibono\n2:18 Comment: over Benega\n2:21 Comment: by Koke\n2:22 Comment: that's a smart juggle\n2:29 Comment: for Kovac\n2:36 Comment: Benega\n2:40 Comment: Kovac the pole\n2:41 Comment: one of the man in the Sevilla team who have played every minute of every game so far this season\n2:45 Comment: Benega\n2:46 Comment: now that's got a touch\n2:48 Comment: Toure can sort it out\n2:49 Comment: here's Bonny\n2:52 Comment: caught by Ibono\n2:54 Comment: and he's still he's very keen\n2:55 Comment: good centre forward play, held the ball, looked well, used his strength\n2:58 Comment: but going back to that chance, I think it was a taller from that right hand side\n3:1 Comment: great bit of skill\n3:3 Comment: you know\n3:5 Comment: flicked it over Otamendi's end, just couldn't quite get under control, looked for the pull back but great skill\n3:13 Comment: Fernandinho, Kolarov's on his bike\n3:16 Comment: Kolarov's driven it in\n3:17 Comment: Bonny's set it back\n3:19 Comment: and Fernandinho's shot was straight down the throat of Sergio Rico\n3:27 Comment: getting forward again\n3:29 Comment: very attacking\n3:30 Comment: you know you expect him to sit next to Fernando but he's been given a licence to get forward\n3:36 Comment: that's a couple of shots he's had already so early in the game\n3:40 Comment: by Emery there, the coach of Sevilla, his 44th birthday today\n3:45 Comment: it's a bit of a 4-1-4-1 formation\n3:47 Comment: Fernando getting up there\n3:49 Comment: he's out with Torre\n3:50 Comment: Fernando's just the holding player looking to protect that back four\n3:54 Comment: Rulinas, Banega\n3:59 Comment: all worked out by Bakary Sanja\n4:5 Comment: he has played on this ground before, he was a substitute for Arsenal\n4:8 Comment: one of the last English Champions League visitors here\n4:13 Comment: some seven or eight years back\n4:19 Comment: not sure what Yaya Torre can do there\n4:21 Comment: Kogoliak has whacked the ball in for two yards\n4:28 Comment: he wants the free kick taken again\n4:35 Comment: Joe Hart has just two in his wall\n4:38 Comment: Sterling and Navas\n4:41 Comment: he's well aware of the threat posed by Jeven Kolopianka who hit his post that he had to had\n4:47 Comment: from a set-piece position\n4:50 Comment: not entirely dissimilar to this one\n5:4 Comment: Rami and Kolodziejczak both forward from centre-half\n5:7 Comment: Konopianka, Banega, Tremulinas\n5:12 Comment: Eva Banega\n5:13 Comment: out by Sanja\n5:17 Comment: it's a foul to snatch it back on his way back for Sevilla\n5:22 Comment: Rami, the 29-year-old French centre-half\n5:26 Comment: who was unfortunate enough to register for City\n5:29 Comment: in the first game between the two two weeks ago\n5:35 Comment: has this remarkable European record both with Valencia and now Sevilla\n5:40 Comment: and now, it's a foul\n5:41 Comment: it's a foul\n5:42 Comment: a foul\n5:49 Comment: looking to recover from back-to-back European defeats\n5:53 Comment: Sevilla has never lost three in a row\n5:56 Comment: in continental competition\n5:57 Comment: here's Kolorov for City\n6:0 Comment: faced by Ibora supported by Sterling\n6:5 Comment: holding for Fernandinho\n6:6 Comment: Olokun come away\n6:8 Comment: Banega's chasing\n6:9 Comment: Llorente's ahead of him\n6:11 Comment: this is Eva Banega for Sevilla\n6:14 Comment: running at Otamendi\n6:16 Comment: Llorente\n6:21 Comment: jammed up beyond Vitolo\n6:22 Comment: and scratched out by Sanja\n6:26 Comment: Boni\n6:27 Comment: Toure\n6:30 Comment: caught up by Prokofiak\n6:31 Comment: City's free kick\n6:33 Comment: What a pass it should play there\n6:35 Comment: first was it a penalty\n6:37 Comment: you know, and then\n6:38 Comment: if Fernandinho goes forward\n6:39 Comment: it's important that\n6:40 Comment: ja, ja, Toure\n6:41 Comment: there's a look there\n6:44 Comment: as you can see\n6:45 Comment: As you can see, he goes into the box, I think that's a penalty.\n6:47 Comment: I think he's caught in there, Fernandinho.\n6:50 Comment: I think that's a penalty from Ancelotti.\n6:52 Comment: Not given, but then, if he goes forwards,\n6:55 Comment: it's important that Yaya Torres sees he's gone forward,\n6:58 Comment: and he fills in the space next to Fernando,\n7:0 Comment: because Fernando becomes isolated,\n7:2 Comment: and you can see how quick the counter-attack from Sevilla was.\n7:9 Comment: Otamendi, Sanya, Navas.\n7:15 Comment: Born in Los Palacios, in the province of Seville.\n7:20 Comment: Made his first team debut for Sevilla 12 years ago this month.\n7:30 Comment: Of all the games on City's fixture list,\n7:32 Comment: this is the one he would most have wanted to play.\n7:33 Comment: He does so at the expense, perhaps surprisingly, of Kevin De Bruyne.\n7:37 Comment: Sanya, Fernando, Fernandinho,\n7:42 Comment: and Raheem Sterling scores for Manchester City!\n7:45 Comment: City!\n7:50 Comment: His first Champions League goal,\n7:53 Comment: and a huge one on their travels for City.\n8:0 Comment: What a pass from that man, Fernandinho, once again.\n8:4 Comment: He's been at the heart of all City's good play going forward,\n8:8 Comment: and it's the reverse pass inside the full-back,\n8:11 Comment: and you've got to say, Raheem Sterling on his weaker left foot,\n8:15 Comment: has just slid it past the goalkeeper,\n8:17 Comment: with a fantastic finish, his first Champions League goal.\n8:22 Comment: Brilliant play from Manchester City.\n8:24 Comment: And a slight change of ball made for the 4-1-4-1,\n8:27 Comment: as we're just watching the run from Sterling.\n8:30 Comment: He brings the full-back towards the ball and darts in behind.\n8:35 Comment: Looks at the goalkeeper,\n8:37 Comment: and then just slides it, side-footed.\n8:40 Comment: Great finish.\n8:42 Comment: Great start, Manchester City.\n8:45 Comment: Manchester City, lead on a ground where Sevilla,\n8:52 Comment: in the group stage of the Champions League,\n8:54 Comment: have won six and drawn one,\n8:56 Comment: where they have never been beaten in Champions League group stage football.\n9:1 Comment: Where they have won their last ten European matches.\n9:5 Comment: Banega.\n9:7 Comment: Sterling's off again, Fernandinho's through the middle,\n9:10 Comment: Bolle's waiting too, Rami is back-tettling,\n9:12 Comment: Sterling is kept wriggling,\n9:15 Comment: there's Kolarov, and he'll get another goal.\n9:21 Comment: Held up by Vitolo.\n9:24 Comment: And then eventually dispossessed by Koke.\n9:29 Comment: Vitolo.\n9:31 Comment: Here comes Fernando.\n9:33 Comment: Brilliant from Fernando there, but what a devastating attack again.\n9:36 Comment: The pace of Raheem Sterling, Kolarov on the overlap,\n9:39 Comment: I think he tried to just sneak it in the knee,\n9:41 Comment: opposed it to the goalkeeper, good save,\n9:43 Comment: but so many balls,\n9:44 Comment: but so many bodies forward.\n9:46 Comment: Manchester City, great start.\n9:52 Comment: And what it means is that Group D, as it stands,\n9:55 Comment: has Manchester City right on top,\n9:57 Comment: there's Konoplyanka with a deflected shot,\n9:59 Comment: Chamoulinas chasing, Sane can carry it away.\n10:2 Comment: If the evening stop now, City are through,\n10:5 Comment: with Juventus still 0-0 against Borussia Mönchengladbach.\n10:9 Comment: If City can win here, and Juventus,\n10:14 Comment: do anything other than lose, then City go through tonight.\n10:19 Comment: It is a very pretty picture, that.\n10:25 Comment: Koke, Sterling's worried it again, and got away from Rabi.\n10:29 Comment: Raheem Sterling, Wilfred Bodie, what a save!\n10:32 Comment: In second time, Fernando, 2-0 City!\n10:37 Comment: We've barely played ten minutes!\n10:40 Comment: And it's a goal!\n10:42 Comment: Beyond their wildest dreams!\n10:47 Comment: Raheem Sterling needing a big night, and he is having one.\n10:51 Comment: What play from the winger.\n10:54 Comment: Great drive into the box, and that man again, Fernandinho,\n10:58 Comment: who's been unbelievable in the opening ten minutes,\n11:1 Comment: but just look at this, the desire to get the ball back,\n11:4 Comment: great bit of skill, drives into the box,\n11:7 Comment: I thought his pull back to Borny was a bit too hard, good save,\n11:9 Comment: but then, Fernandinho's gambled.\n11:12 Comment: He thinks he's gonna land in an area where he can head into an empty net,\n11:15 Comment: and he does.\n11:17 Comment: And he puts it away, great header, good power in the neck muscles,\n11:21 Comment: 2-0 Manchester City, what a start.\n11:25 Comment: Between the goals, 2 minutes and 49 seconds.\n11:29 Comment: Fernandinho's first in the Champions League since scoring for Shakhtar Donetsk\n11:34 Comment: against Chelsea three years ago.\n11:36 Comment: And...\n11:39 Comment: After all the talk, talk supported by history and statistics\n11:45 Comment: of Sevilla's near impregnability on their own ground,\n11:49 Comment: have a look at that scoreline.\n11:53 Comment: Vitolo.\n11:55 Comment: Cushioned by Toure.\n11:57 Comment: Brought away by the score of Fernandinho.\n11:59 Comment: Roll forward for Toure.\n12:2 Comment: He's got Navas beyond him.\n12:5 Comment: Held up by Kolodziejczak.\n12:7 Comment: Jesus Navas.\n12:9 Comment: Oh!\n12:12 Comment: Posted out!\n12:13 Comment: And away by Iborra.\n12:16 Comment: I think that's either took a deflection or it's a wonderful save from Rico.\n12:21 Comment: It's Navas.\n12:22 Comment: He's put the left back up and he's moved the ball to the right,\n12:26 Comment: and he's smashed it.\n12:27 Comment: I think he's either took a deflection or the keeper's got a touch-up\n12:30 Comment: of the ball onto the post.\n12:31 Comment: What a start, Manchester City.\n12:35 Comment: Well...\n12:36 Comment: This, frankly, was inconceivable.\n12:39 Comment: Which isn't to underrate Manchester City.\n12:42 Comment: It simply laughs in the face of history, the way City have started here.\n12:47 Comment: This stuff just doesn't happen...\n12:50 Comment: ..on this ground.\n12:52 Comment: English clubs have always been second best,\n12:54 Comment: the English national team five or six years back was certainly second best.\n13:2 Comment: You've got to say, though, Peter, in the opening 15 minutes,\n13:5 Comment: tactically, the manager from Manchester City has got a spot on.\n13:9 Comment: He's not gone with two-hold in midfield, he's gone with one in Fernando,\n13:13 Comment: which allows Fernandinho to get up with Torre.\n13:16 Comment: The two wingers, Sterling and Navas, have stayed wide.\n13:21 Comment: Kenny was nearly onto it, Rami just got a start there,\n13:25 Comment: here's Vitolo...\n13:28 Comment: Koke...\n13:30 Comment: ...Bernagher.\n13:31 Comment: He's a smart little technician,\n13:33 Comment: went to Grover's cross against...\n13:35 Comment: But so far, brilliant Fernandinho.\n13:38 Comment: In for Llorente, held up by Otamendi.\n13:44 Comment: Koke.\n13:48 Comment: Beautiful feet from Vitolo, out by Kompany.\n13:53 Comment: Bernagher's gone to ground, referee saw no foul.\n13:57 Comment: What a header from the leader, the main man at the back, Kompany.\n14:0 Comment: Great position, sees the danger and gets a powerful header.\n14:4 Comment: Out of danger.\n14:9 Comment: Kolodziejczak.\n14:11 Comment: Semoulinas.\n14:16 Comment: Konoplyanka.\n14:20 Comment: Completed by Vitolo.\n14:22 Comment: Ippola.\n14:26 Comment: Trunch from Otamendi.\n14:31 Comment: And Il Rami.\n14:32 Comment: Vanega.\n14:39 Comment: Solow.\n14:40 Comment: Showed too much of it to Kompany.\n14:43 Comment: Never mind doing things in the last minute as City have,\n14:46 Comment: habitually in the Champions League this year.\n14:49 Comment: Done it all in the first ten here.\n14:51 Comment: But there's Llorente!\n14:54 Comment: Smart little nudge on by Ippola at the near post.\n14:57 Comment: And Fernando Llorente ought to have scored.\n14:59 Comment: Yeah, Joe Hart's running out to have a go at Korov.\n15:2 Comment: He wants him to stop the cross.\n15:4 Comment: But Otamendi's daydreaming.\n15:6 Comment: Kompany's gone to the first man.\n15:8 Comment: You must say that Llorente has to score.\n15:10 Comment: Here's the shot from Navas.\n15:13 Comment: As you can see, he took a slight deflection and a save from the goalkeeper onto the post.\n15:18 Comment: Brilliant save.\n15:21 Comment: Goal!\n15:25 Comment: Well, if you have just joined us, I can only say hard luck.\n15:28 Comment: Because you have missed one terrific first quarter of an hour here,\n15:31 Comment: in which Manchester City have scored twice,\n15:34 Comment: through Sterling and Fernandinho.\n15:35 Comment: They've hit the post, as you've just seen,\n15:37 Comment: through Jesus Navas.\n15:38 Comment: And they might easily just now also have conceded to Fernando Llorente.\n15:44 Comment: This is a sparkly Champions League night.\n15:52 Comment: Through by Kolodziejczak.\n15:53 Comment: Not as far as Vitolo.\n15:55 Comment: In again for Llorente.\n15:57 Comment: Vitolo.\n15:58 Comment: vemごしい.\n15:59 Comment: Taken away by Otamendi off the back of Fernando's tackle,\n16:3 Comment: with which the referee was satisfied.\n16:5 Comment: Here is Sterling.\n16:8 Comment: Toure.\n16:9 Comment: Navas wide.\n16:10 Comment: Sanya getting forward as well.\n16:14 Comment: Jesus Navas.\n16:16 Comment: Backary Sanya.\n16:17 Comment: Toure.\n16:19 Comment: Loops up off Kolodziejczak.\n16:20 Comment: Bode.\n16:24 Comment: What a tackle from Fernando, and he won the ball.\n16:27 Comment: a strong physical, which sets City up another counter-attack.\n16:34 Comment: And Yaya Torre, when the ball comes through in the box,\n16:36 Comment: he's just tried to swoop it in the far corner.\n16:39 Comment: Bonnie.\n16:42 Comment: Good block by Rami.\n16:44 Comment: Brave block.\n16:47 Comment: There were those who supposed that Manchester City were coming here for...\n16:52 Comment: a defensive draw.\n16:54 Comment: So much more than that, and what a good challenge, Robbie, you're right.\n16:57 Comment: Oh, shouldn't he have delivered that one?\n16:59 Comment: Falwell conceded it, really.\n17:21 Comment: Krikowplus.\n17:25 Comment: Nege.\n17:27 Comment: Foul for Sterling.\n17:39 Comment: One by Hart.\n17:41 Comment: That has to bring under his spell.\n17:57 Comment: FULL-BACK\n18:27 Comment: It's in by Koke, too much for Iborra.\n18:32 Comment: Here goes Sterling again.\n18:36 Comment: Actually, he's hitting green ahead of him,\n18:38 Comment: but he was denied the chance to pass by Koke's well-timed tackle.\n18:43 Comment: Koloplyanka.\n18:45 Comment: Chmulinas.\n18:46 Comment: And behind Ofsania for Sevilla's corner.\n18:49 Comment: Again, another fantastic header from Otamendi.\n18:51 Comment: He leaped well and what a header out to Sterling.\n18:54 Comment: He tried to go on another counter-attack,\n18:56 Comment: but it was a good one.\n18:57 Comment: Good tackle.\n18:58 Comment: City defending very well.\n18:59 Comment: Switched off once when Llorente should have scored.\n19:1 Comment: Other than that, it's been a very good display.\n19:3 Comment: One of the best opening 15 missed I've seen City play in Champions League football.\n19:9 Comment: Koloplyanka we know is a threat from these set-pieces.\n19:16 Comment: Iborra right on the goal line.\n19:19 Comment: Grunega whipping it into the near post.\n19:21 Comment: Toure was aware of the danger.\n19:24 Comment: Sterling's clearance is a shade weak.\n19:27 Comment: And now Silviainen.\n19:29 Comment: It might be a difficult 2- begitu\n19:34 Comment: Ball again by Koke.\n19:36 Comment: A heads-up in front of�\n19:38 Comment: Red by Nanas.\n19:39 Comment: Now by Dejes quan Quadri.\n19:47 Comment: Koloplyanka once more.\n19:49 Comment: A tremendous\n19:54 Comment: This time clear courageously from Makherov amongst不是 held feet.\n19:55 Comment: Fernandinho.\n19:56 Comment: Stirling.\n20:7 Comment: Llorente.\n20:11 Comment: Given back to Navas.\n20:17 Comment: It's a snap, As!\n20:18 Comment: It's a snap by Sergio Rico.\n20:21 Comment: He was allowed to run and run and run.\n20:24 Comment: Iborra, I think, was the one who tried to get as close to him as he could,\n20:26 Comment: but just let him get to the edge of the penalty area,\n20:29 Comment: straight across the goalkeeper.\n20:31 Comment: Decent save.\n20:32 Comment: But I must say, Fernandinho, Fernando, Yaya, Torre,\n20:34 Comment: are interchanging so, so well.\n20:36 Comment: If one goes, one fills in.\n20:38 Comment: Get him back, defend him well.\n20:40 Comment: Vanega.\n20:41 Comment: He's going to change a group.\n20:42 Comment: He'll tell you about that in just a second.\n20:44 Comment: Koke.\n20:46 Comment: Vanega.\n20:49 Comment: Too much for Llorente.\n20:50 Comment: There has been a goal.\n20:51 Comment: 1,200 miles north-east of here in Muxungladbach,\n20:53 Comment: Fabian Johnson has scored it for Borussia.\n20:56 Comment: Borussia Muxungladbach, they lead Juventus by 1-0.\n20:59 Comment: And what that means is that Manchester City would be deprived\n21:2 Comment: of the opportunity of going through tonight.\n21:5 Comment: Of course, there are counter-arguments.\n21:7 Comment: City want to win the group ultimately.\n21:9 Comment: It's good for them if Juventus lose points.\n21:11 Comment: But in terms of the immediacy of their qualification,\n21:14 Comment: that's a bump in the road.\n21:16 Comment: Borussia Muxungladbach 1-0 Juventus.\n21:26 Comment: EPIC!\n21:32 Comment: Maliga out.\n21:51 Comment: Engage.\n21:52 Comment: And you can see it there.\n21:54 Comment: We woke it up.\n21:55 Comment: Last four days.\n21:56 Comment: It's been a very good performance, 21 minutes gone,\n21:59 Comment: City in full control from a Sevilla point of view,\n22:2 Comment: I want to see more from Vanega,\n22:4 Comment: can up the anchor,\n22:5 Comment: and Vettola, who had a great bit of skill earlier on\n22:8 Comment: when he lifted the ball over Otamendi's head,\n22:10 Comment: other than that they've been very quiet.\n22:17 Comment: This is a Sevilla team which, despite its extraordinary\n22:19 Comment: and well-earned reputation for ferocity here at home in Europe,\n22:22 Comment: hasn't begun spectacularly domestically in La Liga.\n22:27 Comment: Here's Konoplyanka.\n22:31 Comment: Against Sanya, referee was ideally positioned,\n22:33 Comment: and took a view I think that that was ball to hand.\n22:38 Comment: Toure.\n22:40 Comment: Fernandinho alongside.\n22:42 Comment: Sterling ahead of him, body ahead of him.\n22:46 Comment: Kolorov here wide.\n22:50 Comment: Sterling.\n22:52 Comment: Wriggling Atibora who stayed on his feet,\n22:55 Comment: Otamendi can keep City on the front foot.\n22:57 Comment: Fernando.\n23:1 Comment: Sanya.\n23:3 Comment: Navas.\n23:9 Comment: Toure's foul.\n23:16 Comment: What can Sanya do there?\n23:19 Comment: His arm's in a natural position, Konoplyanka's whack,\n23:22 Comment: he's got the ball from two or three yards straight at his arm.\n23:26 Comment: I think the referee's got that spot on, no penalty.\n23:29 Comment: What can Sanya possibly do? His arm's in a natural position.\n23:32 Comment: Fernandinho.\n23:34 Comment: Sterling.\n23:36 Comment: Away from Rami.\n23:37 Comment: Fernandinho.\n23:40 Comment: Sterling.\n23:43 Comment: That's a decent tackle on him by Koke.\n23:49 Comment: Maneiga.\n23:54 Comment: Our times of Directed\n24:0 Comment: airean Syrophormimer.\n24:2 Comment: previous\n24:22 Comment: Fantastic skill from Koke, I think, on that right side.\n24:35 Comment: You know, again, Koloch just switched off,\n24:39 Comment: and Otamendi can't dive in there,\n24:41 Comment: but the presence of mind to dink it to the far post.\n24:47 Comment: But Tremolinos is unmarked.\n24:49 Comment: Sanya's got pushed in to try and cover the goal.\n24:54 Comment: You know, can Navas do a bit more and get back?\n24:56 Comment: But just see the presence of mind there.\n24:58 Comment: Johan spreads himself, he's dinked it to the back post.\n25:1 Comment: Sanya has to go into mark.\n25:4 Comment: Llorente, which leaves Tremolinos unmarked on the far post.\n25:10 Comment: Can Navas switch on a bit earlier?\n25:15 Comment: Johan exposed.\n25:17 Comment: And having conceded now,\n25:19 Comment: the...\n25:19 Comment: first goal that Benoit Tremolinos has ever scored\n25:22 Comment: for Sevilla,\n25:25 Comment: in his second season at the club since coming here\n25:27 Comment: from Bordeaux to replace Alberto Moreno,\n25:32 Comment: now of Liverpool.\n25:33 Comment: And there's a former Liverpool player in Raheem Sterling\n25:35 Comment: who is requiring some attention\n25:37 Comment: after a lightning-fast start to his game.\n25:45 Comment: Well, whichever way you look at this,\n25:47 Comment: it is...\n25:49 Comment: an enthralling watch.\n25:52 Comment: They've been a threat, you know, on their right-hand side.\n25:55 Comment: He's going to have to come off.\n25:56 Comment: I think they're preparing a change.\n25:58 Comment: Certainly the board was being prepared there by City.\n26:2 Comment: Sterling looks as though he's keen to try and carry on.\n26:7 Comment: City having to restart without him.\n26:13 Comment: You know, Sterling has hobbled back on.\n26:17 Comment: I'm not certain how sure he is about that.\n26:19 Comment: Time will tell.\n26:28 Comment: Tremolinos.\n26:34 Comment: Tackle on Konoplyanka.\n26:37 Comment: By Navas.\n26:41 Comment: Just a reminder that tonight,\n26:43 Comment: our Champions League Highlights programme\n26:45 Comment: is available for you on BT Sport Europe\n26:47 Comment: from 10 o'clock.\n26:49 Comment: 10 o'clock, BT Sport Europe,\n26:50 Comment: for the

Goalkeeper rooted.\n38:1 Comment: And you can hear Blue Moon.\n38:3 Comment: I tell you, this would be once in a Blue Moon.\n38:6 Comment: It's nice to see Navas actually pick somebody out in the penalty area.\n38:10 Comment: The amount of times I've seen him play when he gets into a great position in the final third,\n38:14 Comment: then his final ball is not good enough there.\n38:17 Comment: He looked at Bonny, picked him out.\n38:20 Comment: You know, and it was the weight of the pass to Bonny allowed him to hit it first time,\n38:25 Comment: so great wing play.\n38:27 Comment:

chance,\n39:30 Comment: that was becauseadt half a goal to woould have always been missed,\n39:33 Comment: to corner from Rami.\n39:35 Comment: I'll tell you what, Sterling, that's bravery.\n39:37 Comment: He's seen Rami come hurting and\n39:39 Comment: dives in, he skips past him\n39:41 Comment: and Kolorov, they have such\n39:43 Comment: good link-up on that left-hand side,\n39:45 Comment: Sterling and Kolorov.\n39:48 Comment: Brilliant play.\n39:55 Comment: Kolorov won the corner and will take it.\n39:57 Comment: Otamendi's in there,\n39:59 Comment: Toure's in there, so's Bonny.\n40:3

Comment: aware that they would probably have been flagged offside.\n22:12 Comment: I think they're a different team when Kompany plays,\n22:15 Comment: when he's not in the side,\n22:17 Comment: with the amount of goals they concede,\n22:19 Comment: they look vulnerable.\n22:21 Comment: At times, OK, yes, tonight,\n22:24 Comment: when Sevilla have attacked, they look dangerous,\n22:25 Comment: but when he's there, he's a calming influence.\n22:28 Comment: He organises, he pulls his full-backs in,\n22:32 Comment: and he pushes the line out where needs be.\n22:35 Comment: You know, he's a massive

    "summary": "In the electric atmosphere of Sevilla's Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium, Manchester City embarked on a mission that would define their Champions League campaign. Arriving as the first English team to potentially secure a victory on this formidable ground, City faced a Sevilla side defending an impeccable group stage home record. This confrontation, filled with drama and energy, unfolded with City's intent to cement their position in Group D.\n\nFrom the outset, there was noticeable tension and speculation regarding City's historical performance in high-stakes European fixtures. Several past European champions had faltered here, emphasizing the unique challenge Manchester City faced. This particular match also held significant weight as Group B's standings were influenced by concurrent results involving Juventus and Borussia Mönchengladbach.\n\nThe game commenced with a palpable buzz among the spectators, who bore witness to a disciplined but determined City side. Early exchanges highlighted the importance of midfield control, with Fernando and Fernandinho tasked with shielding the defense and maintaining discipline. Manchester City exhibited strategic prudence, allowing their front four the creative freedom to pressure Sevilla's backline. Fernandinho stood out with an eagerness to advance, notably within the opening ten minutes testing the waters with a resolute strike, though not causing major trouble.\n\nDespite City's momentum, the attacking threat from Sevilla constantly loomed. Yaya Toure and his compatriots needed to be wary of Sevilla's midfield maestro, Ever Banega, and the dexterous wing play of Konoplyanka. City's own Raheem Sterling, who made his Champions League debut, was consistently involved, showing early signs of intent with determined runs and interplay.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Manchester City broke the deadlock. Raheem Sterling found the net in the seventh minute after a series of fluid passes, concluding with a deft through-ball from Fernandinho. Sterling's perfectly placed shot with his left foot evaded Sergio Rico, sparking celebrations among the City camp. \n\nSevilla, stunned by the early setback, sought an immediate response. Their pursuit for an equalizer created spaces which City capitalized on efficiently. Within minutes, Fernandinho doubled City’s advantage, following a dynamic burst by Sterling. The young Englishman displayed remarkable pace and finesse, driving into the box and managing to keep the ball live for Fernandinho to head home from close range, elevating the scoreline to 2-0.\n\nAmidst the roaring chants and the flurry of activity on the pitch, Sevilla attempted to regroup. Their persistence bore fruit when Benoît Trémoulinas broke City's defensive line, leaping onto Konoplyanka's cross to slot one home near the 25-minute mark. This goal epitomized Sevilla's refusal to capitulate, reminding City of their vulnerability.\n\nThe real turning point arrived just before halftime. As Sevilla was refashioning their strategies, a powerful counter by City culminated in Wilfried Bonny's close-range finish, courtesy of a precise cutback from Jesus Navas. This third goal hammered a significant blow to Sevilla's morale, revitalizing City's prospects, and providing them with a crucial two-goal buffer.\n\nThe second half initiated with Sevilla adopting a more aggressive mindset. Grzegorz Krychowiak’s relentless pressing and Vítolo’s creative endeavors aimed to destabilize City's well-calibrated structure. Despite these efforts, City’s defensive unit, marshaled by Vincent Kompany, demonstrated resilient fortitude, rebuffing Sevilla’s advances with timely interceptions and disciplined coordination.\n\nManchester City exhibited tactical maturity with controlled possession and calculated plays. Kevin De Bruyne, introduced later in the game, added fresh impetus to City’s attacks. His interplay, particularly with Yaya Toure, emphasized City's depth and versatility. De Bruyne nearly added a fourth, only for his effort to be thwarted by Sergio Rico’s acrobatics.\n\nSevilla, relentless in their attempts to salvage something from the game, directed their thrusts through wide positions and set-pieces. Their inclusion of Ciro Immobile introduced a different threat, adding mobility and energy upfront. Despite this, opportunities were limited, with Joe Hart and his defense maintaining a vigilant watch.\n\nAs the match neared its climax, City’s coherence in both defense and attack culminated in a sense of inevitability regarding the result. The final minutes were managed with astuteness, ensuring minimal risk while exploring counter-attacking opportunities. Fabian Delph’s introduction marked his Champions League debut, symbolizing City’s strength across the squad.\n\nIn the closing stages, City continued to stifle Sevilla’s resurgence attempts, with strategic fouls and sustained possession frustrating the home side. The final whistle confirmed a historic 3-1 victory for Manchester City, marking their first win at this daunting venue and securing their place in the knockout stages with two games to spare. This result was celebrated, not only for its immediate significance but also as an affirmation of City’s evolving European credibility.\n\nThis triumph was born from a blend of tactical discipline, individual brilliance, and collective endeavor. Fernandinho’s all-encompassing performance, Sterling’s dynamic play, and the defensive solidity provided by Kompany and Otamendi encapsulated City's night. As they left the pitch, City had showcased a level of maturity and resilience that augurs well for their ambitions in Europe. This performance underlined their potential to not just compete but to thrive at the highest levels of continental football."
