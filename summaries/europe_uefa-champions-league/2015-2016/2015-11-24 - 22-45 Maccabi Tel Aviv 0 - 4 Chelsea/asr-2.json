before.\n6:0 Comment: 14 years ago in the UEFA Cup and fielded a very young team that was beaten.\n6:5 Comment: Under extenuating circumstances at the time.\n6:8 Comment: Costa, Alberman.\n6:12 Comment: Touch for Perez.\n6:13 Comment: Higuierbour.\n6:19 Comment: Ben Haim to Ward's, his namesake.\n6:21 Comment: Well read by Abderrahman.\n6:23 Comment: Touch for Fabregas.\n6:25 Comment: Azar.\n6:26 Comment: Away from Higuierbour.\n6:28 Comment: Away from Alberman, in for Oscar.\n6:31 Comment: Switched out by Garcia, came to Matic.\n6:34 Comment: Azpilicueta.\n6:37 Comment: Oscar.\n6:38 Comment: Azpilicueta!\n6:41 Comment: Without quite the inwhip he needed.\n6:44 Comment: Well Oscar I've already mentioned has taken up some great forward positions.\n6:48 Comment: Clever little back heel.\n6:51 Comment: And the execution from Azpilicueta, not quite as he would have wanted it but it was good play.\n6:56 Comment: He made the pass, followed the ball, found himself in plenty of space and just tried to bend it with his left foot into that far corner.\n7:5 Comment: You were asked about the surface before the game Trevor, quick word on that again.\n7:8 Comment: It's not so bad is it?\n7:10 Comment: No I think in England the surfaces are absolutely superb but this here is not a bad surface.\n7:15 Comment: When I think back to the 70s and the 80s some of the surfaces we used to play on, it's nice to see a bit of grass on the field.\n7:22 Comment: Here's Matic.\n7:27 Comment: Cahill.\n7:33 Comment: Azpilicueta closed down by Adi Urikan.\n7:38 Comment: Scored his first goal for the club at the weekend in a 3-0 away win on this ground.\n7:44 Comment: If you've just joined us you may not be entirely aware that this isn't the regular home ground for Maccabi Tel Aviv, we're 50 odd miles away from that.\n7:55 Comment: They play their Champions League games here simply because it's more capacious, almost more than 30,000.\n8:1 Comment: Albemar.\n8:4 Comment: Iggy Abort.\n8:6 Comment: Terence who's made a really busy start.\n8:9 Comment: Benhaim half a yard offside.\n8:22 Comment: Costa.\n8:24 Comment: Abogas.\n8:29 Comment: Matic.\n8:31 Comment: Sarr.\n8:45 Comment: Abogas.\n8:47 Comment: Matic.\n8:53 Comment: Matic missed out on the game but home to Maccabi Tel Aviv, that was a night you'll remember, Ruben Loftus-Cheek was at the time surprisingly included by Jose Mourinho.\n9:5 Comment: Shukster hasn't figured so much since.\n9:16 Comment: Haroosh for touch.\n9:19 Comment: Williams' throw.\n9:22 Comment: It's Ken Garcia.\n9:25 Comment: That's Pellegretta.\n9:32 Comment: Cahill and Terry reunited.\n9:34 Comment: Cahill has been involved in all four Champions League games, he started the first three but only played the final seconds in Kiev.\n9:47 Comment: Abogas caught on it by the eager Peretz again.\n9:49 Comment: Anything else tonight, Chelsea looking to repair their away form which has been particularly dismal of late.\n10:5 Comment: One away from Stamford Bridge who's doing so at Walsall in the League Cup at the end of September.\n10:10 Comment: That's Pellegretta.\n10:18 Comment: Hazard, Matic, Mosca, Costa, Baba.\n10:27 Comment: Fired across the face, it's reached Hazard.\n10:31 Comment: That's Pellegretta, Fabregas, broken up by Iggy Abort then Peretz.\n10:37 Comment: He's overdone it for Zahavi.\n10:41 Comment: Yes the pass was poor but once again there was another example of good possession from Chelsea.\n10:46 Comment: They lose the ball on the edge of the box.\n10:49 Comment: The home side are looking to spring on the counter attack trying to catch Chelsea.\n10:53 Comment: The away side Chelsea have to be very careful.\n10:55 Comment: It is a year this week, equivalent to Champions League night last year since Chelsea last won a European game away.\n11:9 Comment: They did so in fine style 5-0 at Schalke.\n11:15 Comment: They played pretty well in Kiev earlier in this campaign and were unfortunate to come away with just a goal, a straw.\n11:22 Comment: Beaten prior to that in Porto and remember their final group game is against Porto at the bridge.\n11:30 Comment: Early next month.\n11:34 Comment: They would prefer for there to be little or nothing on it.\n11:52 Comment: Cahill. Fabregas caught up by Iggy Abort who's a terrific athlete, covers ground.\n12:1 Comment: Eats it up.\n12:4 Comment: Raphilly quite having a word there with the referee and rightly so because there's no contact.\n12:10 Comment: Rikan fell to the floor looking to win a free kick.\n12:15 Comment: Willian.\n12:21 Comment: As I mentioned the pitch there are areas of it that are cutting up a little.\n12:25 Comment: Willian took a hefty divot out then.\n12:28 Comment: Oscar, Willian.\n12:31 Comment: Hazard.\n12:34 Comment: Pellegretta against Ben Haroosh.\n12:38 Comment: Sturdy start at left back.\n12:42 Comment: Fabregas, Costa.\n12:44 Comment: By Iggy Abort, cushioned by Zahavi.\n12:50 Comment: It's Al-Benhaim.\n12:56 Comment: Away from him by Oscar.\n13:5 Comment: Actually having welcomed the teams with massive passion.\n13:9 Comment: Somewhat quietened by the first near quarter of an hour or so.\n13:13 Comment: Perhaps a shade star struck.\n13:15 Comment: As I mentioned at the start the English Premier League is big business here.\n13:20 Comment: They absolutely gobble it up.\n13:22 Comment: Visit from Chelsea is very exciting for football fans in this city.\n13:33 Comment: Fabregas.\n13:36 Comment: Costa.\n13:38 Comment: As Pellegretta.\n13:40 Comment: Willian.\n13:42 Comment: Well watched by Garcia.\n13:52 Comment: Has good pedigree. He was born in Barcelona, grew up through the youth ranks at Espanyol, had time at Real Betis.\n14:4 Comment: Pellegretta's throw. Away by Garcia.\n14:8 Comment: Baba.\n14:12 Comment: Fabregas.\n14:15 Comment: Hazard. Willian's gone beyond him.\n14:17 Comment: Oscar's well advanced too.\n14:19 Comment: Hazard tried to pick out Oscar.\n14:21 Comment: Picked up the pieces ahead of Benhaim.\n14:24 Comment: Baba Rahman.\n14:28 Comment: Hazard.\n14:30 Comment: Matic.\n14:32 Comment: Fabregas.\n14:34 Comment: Hazard.\n14:40 Comment: Fabregas.\n14:43 Comment: Space for Baba.\n14:45 Comment: Bjorn Costa.\n14:47 Comment: By Albemont.\n14:49 Comment: Is Maccabi's most conservative midfield player.\n14:53 Comment: Spent a lot of time between the two centre halves.\n14:56 Comment: Costa.\n14:58 Comment: Fabregas. Hazard.\n15:0 Comment: Shoving his back from Iggy Abob.\n15:2 Comment: A Spanish referee was ideally positioned and didn't consider it a foul.\n15:7 Comment: Fabregas.\n15:9 Comment: Willian.\n15:11 Comment: Caught up by Rican.\n15:14 Comment: By Garcia.\n15:22 Comment: Well the first 15 minutes have passed and no Chelsea you can see is starting to get a foothold in this game.\n15:27 Comment: Dominating possession.\n15:33 Comment: Hazard.\n15:37 Comment: Matic.\n15:40 Comment: Hazard.\n15:46 Comment: Hold up by Peretz.\n15:50 Comment: Albemont.\n15:52 Comment: Team giveaway to Fabregas.\n15:54 Comment: Lovely touch from Hazard. Fabregas again. Willian wide of him.\n15:58 Comment: Albemont's strong tackle.\n16:3 Comment: Just as poor, poor clearance for Oscar.\n16:6 Comment: Costa.\n16:9 Comment: Came out to Azpilicueta.\n16:13 Comment: Couldn't pick a route past Rican.\n16:17 Comment: Chelsea have a player down.\n16:24 Comment: Meantime here's Sahavi.\n16:27 Comment: It's Oscar who's just about picked himself up now out of your picture and is\n16:32 Comment: hobbling in\n16:35 Comment: rather uncertain style back towards the halfway line.\n16:40 Comment: That was interesting because Rican was looking to try and put the boy out of play and\n16:44 Comment: he turned to his coach and he said you play on.\n16:47 Comment: He wasn't interested in the fact that Oscar was struggling on the floor.\n16:50 Comment: As it happens he was right because Oscar has got up and\n16:54 Comment: he looks fine.\n17:9 Comment: Four of us.\n17:11 Comment: He may know for Chelsea.\n17:13 Comment: Has always been a problem in the Champions League.\n17:15 Comment: They won it in 2012 after failing to win\n17:18 Comment: any of three away group games\n17:21 Comment: in that campaign.\n17:24 Comment: This is an away game they would be expected to win.\n17:28 Comment: Tel Aviv have done terrifically well\n17:31 Comment: just to be here. They began their qualifying campaign right back at the start of the season.\n17:34 Comment: against Maltese opponents.\n17:36 Comment: Their greatest achievement was to win a playoff against Basel of Switzerland which was against all odds and expectation.\n17:49 Comment: They came in firmly.\n17:51 Comment: Perhaps overly so at the back of Costa.\n17:54 Comment: As Pellequeta.\n17:57 Comment: And now it's a bit of a\n17:59 Comment: fall.\n18:1 Comment: Not quite sure exactly what he was trying to do.\n18:4 Comment: He's got a bit of a\n18:7 Comment: bit of a\n18:33 Comment: between Chelsea,\n18:35 Comment: Marseille and\n18:37 Comment: Pencal Ara,\n18:39 Comment: ..and\n18:41 Comment: Piscilla\n18:43 Comment: Muchina\n18:46 Comment: Now\n18:48 Comment: 엥\n18:52 Comment: Er\n18:54 Comment: Rajkovic is a Serbian only just turned 20. He's already a full international and\n19:1 Comment: has attracted scouts from many of the major clubs around Europe.\n19:15 Comment: It's Pellequeta. Oscar is onside. Ben Haroosh is very tight to him.\n19:22 Comment: He yields him a corner.\n19:28 Comment: Once again it was Oscar who was making that run to provide the opportunity for\n19:34 Comment: the pass in the forward area. His movement has been excellent. The type of\n19:39 Comment: movement I'd like to see more from Diego Costa. For me he's far too static Costa.\n19:46 Comment: Williams take is away for the line and then punt home for Chelsea by Gary Cahill.\n19:57 Comment: Rajkovic at full switch had kicked it out the first time but Gary Cahill was Johnny on the heel.\n20:7 Comment: The opposition's box so dangerous. You're absolutely right. Rajkovic so\n20:12 Comment: unfortunate. He makes a brilliant save. Pushes it against the post. But look how\n20:17 Comment: quick Gary Cahill was to respond. It was his header. He doesn't stand still.\n20:22 Comment: Gets on the end of the second one too.\n20:28 Comment: Brilliant piece of anticipation from the central defender. The type of anticipation\n20:34 Comment: you always associate with predators playing in the centre forward role.\n20:39 Comment: His first European goal since getting one in the last 16 against Paris Saint-Germain in the spring.\n20:46 Comment: The uplift that Jose Mourinho coached turn Gardner was looking for.\n20:52 Comment: Perhaps they're entitled to feel slightly greater alarm about the pitch than\n20:58 Comment: originally seemed the case. It looked superficially fine but as you saw there\n21:4 Comment: are great clumps of turf.\n21:9 Comment: Being driven out of place and back in.\n21:20 Comment: Just a reminder that to qualify tonight Chelsea need simply to achieve a better\n21:26 Comment: result than Dynamo Kiev achieve in Porto. So if Chelsea win and Kiev fail to win\n21:33 Comment: then Chelsea will qualify tonight.\n21:47 Comment: Back of Costa.\n21:50 Comment: Willian.\n22:6 Comment: Well done for Fabregas. Support now from Azar. Fabregas kept going.\n22:15 Comment: Into the arms of the goalkeeper. So there is confirmation of how a Group G looks\n22:20 Comment: now and from Chelsea's perspective it is a very healthy state of affairs for\n22:26 Comment: Slavica Yukanovic, the 47 year old coach of Maccabi Tel Aviv. If he loses he's out\n22:32 Comment: of Europe altogether. There remains a theoretical chance that Maccabi can\n22:37 Comment: finish third and go through to the Europa League knockout stages.\n22:42 Comment: The Champions League dream will end after matchday six.\n22:56 Comment: Sahavi. Run off it by Baba. He's got a fair bit of acreage ahead of him. Costa alongside\n23:4 Comment: of him and Azar now going past him.\n23:7 Comment: Leading past Peretz.\n23:15 Comment: It's tackled.\n23:22 Comment: Benhaye. Sahavi through the middle. Benhaye bit off all they could chew.\n23:31 Comment: That was better for Matic.\n23:36 Comment: Getting himself back. Making that all-important challenge.\n24:0 Comment: Iggy Abol.\n24:3 Comment: Between Willian and Azpilicueta who had it well read. Rick and Pendermin down by the corner.\n24:11 Comment: Under about our Champions League action tomorrow. After tonight's highlights\n24:16 Comment: which are on the BT Sport Europe at 10 o'clock with goals from all around the\n24:21 Comment: continent including Arsenal against Dinamo Zagreb, Barcelona, Roma. Tomorrow\n24:25 Comment: from 6.30, Champions League tonight also on BT Sport Europe. Teeing up our live\n24:30 Comment: games which are principally from 7 on BT Sport 2, Juventus against Manchester\n24:34 Comment: City and from 7.30 on BT Sport Europe, Manchester United against PSV Eindhoven.\n24:46 Comment: Cahill battling with Iggy Abol.\n24:52 Comment: 60% Chelsea possession just more.\n24:56 Comment: Gary Cahill after 20 minutes following up his own header.\n25:2 Comment: A header which had brought from Predrag Rajkovic. A serious save of the game.\n25:26 Comment: That's hard.\n25:35 Comment: Chelsea now couldn't afford to be soothed by that goal, by that lead.\n25:42 Comment: It's the back of a win on Saturday. They've won three in a row once this season and that\n25:47 Comment: little sequence began with the home game against Maccabi Tel Aviv in September.\n25:52 Comment: Here is Iggy Abol.\n25:54 Comment: We've gone for Perez.\n25:59 Comment: Perez does win a corner from Babac.\n26:8 Comment: John Terry caused himself problems there because he was first to that ball and he should have\n26:12 Comment: played safety first, tried to just drop it off to Afpeli Koueta. Really should have gone\n26:17 Comment: out for a throw-in. He gave possession away and immediately Maccabi attacked Chelsea and\n26:24 Comment: forced a corner.\n26:26 Comment: Which Ben Haim will take.\n26:30 Comment: Left two back Maccabi to deal with Azar. The rest are committed.\n26:37 Comment: Ben Haim has got horribly under that.\n26:42 Comment: Fabregas moved it on for Azar and then moved it on more progressively for Oscar, who's half the pitch to run into here.\n26:51 Comment: Costa for support, away from Ben Haim.\n26:57 Comment: Oscar.\n26:59 Comment: And away by Garcia.\n27:1 Comment: Rikan.\n27:5 Comment: Iggy Abol. He's a Harvey ahead of him.\n27:12 Comment: Rikan.\n27:40 Comment: It's a Harvey.\n27:42 Comment: Against Matich.\n27:47 Comment: Azar Nick from behind.\n28:0 Comment: Perez the offender.\n28:3 Comment: The foul was on Hazard in a more central position and at this moment, Hazard's actually swapped with Oscar.\n28:17 Comment: Iggy Abol.\n28:29 Comment: Tenacious running into Baba.\n28:34 Comment: That's lovely. Azar.\n28:39 Comment: Nicely spread for Willian.\n28:41 Comment: Matich.\n28:48 Comment: Willian.\n28:50 Comment: Spilicueta.\n28:52 Comment: Fabregas.\n29:8 Comment: Matich.\n29:11 Comment: Spilicueta.\n29:15 Comment: Oscar.\n29:18 Comment: Matich, that's lovely.\n29:20 Comment: Azar.\n29:22 Comment: Willian.\n29:27 Comment: Spilicueta.\n29:29 Comment: Costa!\n29:33 Comment: Great if it came off.\n29:35 Comment: That he made contact was an achievement in itself.\n29:39 Comment: Anywhere else on the pitch, you know, and this is given as a free kick against Diego Costa.\n29:44 Comment: For some reason, there are referees that allow that in the penalty box.\n29:48 Comment: It's a good build up from Chelsea.\n29:50 Comment: The initial ball from Matich picking out Hazard was quite brilliant.\n29:54 Comment: Lovely disguise on it. Unfortunately,\n29:57 Comment: Hazard in plenty of space. Didn't get that first touch right. Otherwise, he'd have been in for a goal scoring opportunity.\n30:3 Comment: Iggy Aboy.\n30:5 Comment: Sahavi.\n30:10 Comment: From Match. As Spilicueta.\n30:12 Comment: Came down off Perez.\n30:14 Comment: Silky touch again from Azar.\n30:16 Comment: Costa.\n30:22 Comment: Fabregas.\n30:24 Comment: Oscar.\n30:26 Comment: Willian.\n30:32 Comment: Oscar. Fabregas.\n30:34 Comment: Matich.\n30:38 Comment: Baba.\n30:44 Comment: Azar.\n30:55 Comment: Oscar. Azar. Oscar.\n30:59 Comment: Costa. Azar.\n31:3 Comment: Scraped away by Ben Haim.\n31:7 Comment: Chelsea are beginning to find a rhythm here, they're ticking.\n31:13 Comment: There are moments like that, Peter, when you can see the difference in quality between the two teams.\n31:17 Comment: They were chasing shadows there, Maccabi. Some brilliant interpassing from Chelsea.\n31:21 Comment: A pity they didn't finish it off with a goal.\n31:24 Comment: Fabregas. Azar.\n31:26 Comment: Oscar.\n31:28 Comment: They're starting to find themselves again.\n31:31 Comment: Jose Mourinho was talking about players rediscovering their confidence.\n31:35 Comment: It might be harrowing for some of these supporters if they can maintain this.\n31:40 Comment: Because it's becoming easy on the eye.\n31:46 Comment: Unless you're yellow-shirted.\n31:48 Comment: It's the quality of movement that the home side cannot cope with.\n31:52 Comment: Understandably so, they pass the ball better because they're all top international players.\n31:58 Comment: But it's the movement that the home side are finding very difficult to cope with.\n32:15 Comment: Ben Haim.\n32:17 Comment: Ben Harush.\n32:22 Comment: Garcia.\n32:32 Comment: García.\n32:34 Comment: Can't be telling me it's two centre-halves.\n32:36 Comment: Have both played high-level domestic football.\n32:39 Comment: Ben Haim in England and Garcia in Spain.\n32:45 Comment: Left out by Begovic, which gives me a chance to remind you,\n32:51 Comment: particularly if you're watching this game through Chelsea Blue Eyes,\n32:54 Comment: that you'll want to be with us on Sunday, no, it's Sunday,\n32:57 Comment: from 11.15 for our live offering from the Barclays Premier League this weekend.\n33:0 Comment: 11.15 from White Hart Lane, it's Tottenham against Chelsea on BT Sport 1.\n33:9 Comment: Tottenham might just about have got back from Azerbaijan by then.\n33:15 Comment: Zahavi.\n33:17 Comment: Ben Haim.\n33:19 Comment: Zahavi.\n33:21 Comment: Out by Terry.\n33:23 Comment: Good clearance from Fabregas, it's come to Dasa.\n33:27 Comment: Dasa's made a yard.\n33:29 Comment: Zahavi.\n33:31 Comment: Ben Haim.\n33:33 Comment: Out by Terry.\n33:35 Comment: And lashed back over by Ben Harush.\n33:37 Comment: And there was another example of Fabregas\n33:40 Comment: really showing lack of responsibility.\n33:43 Comment: It was a casual pass, given away far too easily.\n33:58 Comment: Terry getting the job done ruggedly.\n34:8 Comment: Eleven minutes until half-time, Chelsea broadly in command here.\n34:19 Comment: The win against Norwich was only their second in the last seven games.\n34:24 Comment: It is a season they hope under repair, certainly in need of repair.\n34:28 Comment: Here's Willian.\n34:32 Comment: Too clever for Garcia.\n34:34 Comment: Helps him over.\n34:37 Comment: Great pace shown from Willian.\n34:39 Comment: He got away easily from his marker.\n34:41 Comment: And he looked up and wanted to play the ball into the box.\n34:45 Comment: He wants to cross the ball here, but he broke so quickly\n34:48 Comment: that he didn't give a chance to any of his colleagues to get up with him.\n34:52 Comment: So it was pointless in putting it into the box, he had to check back on himself.\n34:56 Comment: Of course, all five of Willian's goals this season have come from direct free kicks,\n35:0 Comment: but principally from the other side of the penalty area,\n35:3 Comment: which favour his right-footed delivery.\n35:7 Comment: So instead he may be interested in the presence of Cahill and Terry and Matic.\n35:12 Comment: Just looking at Matic at the back post.\n35:14 Comment: He's actually moving now, but his marker was this small Elie Dassa.\n35:19 Comment: It's a bit of a mismatch, that.\n35:21 Comment: If Willian can get the ball in that area, he can.\n35:24 Comment: Willian can get the ball in that area.\n35:27 Comment: Willian does whip it in towards that back post.\n35:30 Comment: In fact, Matic was the closest player to it from a Chelsea perspective.\n35:34 Comment: Rajkovic applied a low punch.\n35:44 Comment: Fabregas.\n35:46 Comment: Dassa.\n36:2 Comment: It is their regular home pitch, this.\n36:5 Comment: Many of the Maccabi players will be familiar with it.\n36:8 Comment: It is the home ground of the Israeli national teams,\n36:12 Comment: where they've been playing their qualifiers for Euro 2016 in Wales.\n36:15 Comment: This group, Wales, were here not so very long ago.\n36:18 Comment: Has been a Degovic, Kepko, Bosnia-Herzegovina here also.\n36:24 Comment: The core of Israel's national team is in effect the Maccabi-Tel Aviv team.\n36:30 Comment: They are restricted to five foreigners in their squad.\n36:43 Comment: There's been a goal in Portugal,\n36:45 Comment: and probably not the one Chelsea would want to hear about.\n36:47 Comment: Yarmolenko scored a penalty for Kiev.\n36:50 Comment: It's Azar for Chelsea.\n36:54 Comment: That's Pellegritta.\n36:57 Comment: Out by Albermann.\n37:0 Comment: Matic.\n37:3 Comment: Willian.\n37:8 Comment: It's Pellegritta.\n37:12 Comment: Fabregas. Azar.\n37:14 Comment: Matic.\n37:16 Comment: Fabregas, touch from Costa. Here goes Azar.\n37:19 Comment: Fabregas. Costa!\n37:21 Comment: We're walking it in.\n37:24 Comment: Lovely football.\n37:26 Comment: Just a pity that Diego Costa couldn't get his shot away.\n37:29 Comment: It was a good challenge from the right full-back, Ali Dasa,\n37:31 Comment: made that all-important interception.\n37:33 Comment: Just as you felt with his left foot,\n37:35 Comment: Diego Costa was going to smash it into the roof of the net.\n37:39 Comment: Fabregas with the short corner for Azar,\n37:41 Comment: who let it roll for Baba!\n37:46 Comment: The crossbar by Amad.\n37:47 Comment: Let me just reiterate then the news I was bringing you.\n37:50 Comment: Porto nil, Dynamo Kiev one.\n37:53 Comment: If Kiev win that game in Portugal,\n37:56 Comment: that means that whatever Chelsea do tonight,\n37:59 Comment: it will go to the final day.\n38:8 Comment: Jose Mourinho's grimace might have applied to that news.\n38:13 Comment: Actually, it was a reaction to Baba Rahman's skewiff shot.\n38:23 Comment: Given away by Ben Haroosh.\n38:25 Comment: Fabregas.\n38:27 Comment: Willian.\n38:33 Comment: Beautiful skill, wasn't it, from Willian?\n38:36 Comment: He's a player that's absolutely oozing with confidence.\n38:38 Comment: It was nice that the home supporters actually appreciate what he did.\n38:43 Comment: It was a big round of applause.\n38:46 Comment: Tell Ben Haim.\n38:49 Comment: So Harvey through the middle.\n38:51 Comment: Baba Rahman made him check.\n38:57 Comment: So Harvey came deep in search of possession.\n39:1 Comment: Fabregas thwarted him.\n39:4 Comment: Mention the home supporters, Trevor.\n39:6 Comment: There is, as we saw beforehand in fairness down there,\n39:8 Comment: as well as a group of home supporters,\n39:11 Comment: several, I think perhaps as many as 100 Israelis in Chelsea blue.\n39:17 Comment: There are 950-odd official travelling Chelsea supporters,\n39:20 Comment: and there are many, many supporting them from their homeland.\n39:26 Comment: And it's nice, they're all sat together.\n39:28 Comment: It's not an issue in any sense at all.\n39:31 Comment: Ambience around the ground is extremely pleasant.\n39:41 Comment: Costa.\n39:45 Comment: Foul.\n39:46 Comment: Oh, red card!\n39:48 Comment: A red card!\n39:50 Comment: For Ben Haim.\n39:55 Comment: One thrust of his boot and he's walking.\n40:4 Comment: Well, the referee's reaction was instant,\n40:8 Comment: without contemplation.\n40:9 Comment: And John Terry, his former centre-back partner,\n40:13 Comment: is there to try and soothe the wound.\n40:15 Comment: But it was a shade wild.\n40:17 Comment: Just look at the reaction of Ben Haim.\n40:20 Comment: It's an absolute crude challenge.\n40:22 Comment: And the moment he does it, he knows what he's done.\n40:25 Comment: He actually puts his hands to his face,\n40:27 Comment: because he knows what the consequence is going to be.\n40:30 Comment: He turns around, and it's no surprise to him\n40:33 Comment: that the referee, rightly so, brandishes a red card.\n40:37 Comment: A moment of absolute madness by Ben Haim.\n40:41 Comment: A wild challenge and wild eyes.\n40:44 Comment: Eight years ago tonight, he was partnering John Terry\n40:48 Comment: at Pride Park Derby in a 2-0 win for Chelsea\n40:51 Comment: under Avram Grant.\n40:53 Comment: And here tonight, hosting Chelsea,\n40:56 Comment: he has dug himself a big hole.\n41:0 Comment: And indeed, dug a still deeper one\n41:3 Comment: for the ten he leaves behind.\n41:5 Comment: Trailing to the Premier League champions at home,\n41:9 Comment: and now a man short.\n41:18 Comment: Three and a half minutes, still half-time.\n41:21 Comment: Ambrogas with the free kick, aimed at Cahill.\n41:24 Comment: Matic was close to getting a toe on it.\n41:27 Comment: It was stolen off that toe at the expense of a corner.\n41:44 Comment: I can only imagine how you can't get a free kick\n41:47 Comment: I can only imagine how Yukanovic is feeling at this moment.\n41:49 Comment: Hard enough for the 11 players,\n41:51 Comment: an act of stupidity by the experienced Ben Haim.\n41:55 Comment: Williams ball in, away by now\n41:59 Comment: the only remaining Tel Ben Haim.\n42:2 Comment: There's only one Tel Ben Haim again.\n42:5 Comment: Fabregas, faced by Rikan.\n42:9 Comment: Hazard!\n42:12 Comment: Not a problem for Raikovic.\n42:17 Comment: Still can't get that goal.\n42:19 Comment: Hazard hasn't scored since following in his own\n42:22 Comment: saved penalty against Crystal Palace to win\n42:25 Comment: Mourinho the league in May.\n42:33 Comment: Perez.\n42:37 Comment: For the record, Rikan, I think Trevor has gone to left-back,\n42:40 Comment: has he, and Haruchin to centre-half.\n42:42 Comment: The other end there is Tel Ben Haim, failing to get past Babarama.\n42:47 Comment: Rikan did actually play a left-back in the domestic game\n42:50 Comment: on this ground.\n42:51 Comment: He's entirely familiar with the position.\n42:56 Comment: They have on their bed Chetan Tibi,\n42:58 Comment: centre-half at Stamford Bridge.\n42:59 Comment: Here's Oskar.\n43:3 Comment: Haruchin has got his work done.\n43:5 Comment: And it is another Chelsea corner.\n43:14 Comment: 90 seconds of the first half to play.\n43:17 Comment: Fabregas.\n43:28 Comment: Oskar run off it by Ben Haim.\n43:32 Comment: He's to hit forward for Rikan.\n43:34 Comment: And my left-back is by right wing all of a sudden.\n43:37 Comment: Just look down at the reaction of Mourinho when they went short there\n43:40 Comment: Chelsea from that corner.\n43:41 Comment: He was absolutely livid.\n43:43 Comment: He was probably thinking they'd just lost the centre-half.\n43:46 Comment: He's already scored one goal from a ball into the poundy box on a corner.\n43:49 Comment: Stick it in there rather than go short.\n43:57 Comment: This is some of that massage.\n43:59 Comment: He was livid, wasn't he?\n44:1 Comment: Absolutely spitting the Chelsea manager.\n44:5 Comment: But his team are in a position of considerable comfort now.\n44:10 Comment: We'll have to see how they can let it slip from this position.\n44:16 Comment: It's a goal.\n44:20 Comment: Cahill first to react to his own excellent downward header\n44:23 Comment: which brought an elastic save from Raikovic.\n44:26 Comment: Much sympathy for the young goalkeeper.\n44:38 Comment: Bigger ball.\n44:40 Comment: Dispossessed by Azpilicueta.\n44:42 Comment: Forward by Fabregas.\n44:43 Comment: Here's Azar.\n44:44 Comment: Run at Dassa.\n44:46 Comment: Roll it in for Willian.\n44:49 Comment: Fabregas.\n44:51 Comment: Azar.\n44:55 Comment: You see Diego Costa there.\n44:56 Comment: That's an example of what I'm talking about.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: sent out to warm up and we all anticipated that Remy was going to be\n0:3 Comment: brought on for Costa that hasn't happened though. No, certainly reading the\n0:9 Comment: body language of the Chelsea management as they made their way down the tunnel\n0:12 Comment: they weren't entirely satisfied with the first half, albeit that's everything\n0:20 Comment: would appear to be going Chelsea's way there might of course be some canny man\n0:25 Comment: management in there, if Jose Mourinho allowed his players to believe that the\n0:30 Comment: job was effectively done then that of course would render them vulnerable even\n0:36 Comment: so he is looking for improvement and 900 or so who traveled here would be\n0:41 Comment: optimistic of seeing more goals\n0:49 Comment: foul on Benhaim by Cahill who has scored a goal\n0:55 Comment: Cou expedition with Saturday those interact how's him\n0:59 Comment: unfolded and各位\n1:21 Comment: It's been looking a bit better this way about what the plans are for the three\n1:24 Comment: teams dentis who have 1,035 well, yeah, two big mniejnote News comprises end of the\n1:25 Comment: it has been looking a bit better this way about what the plans are for the three team\n1:25 Comment: it wide and Hazard can keep this in.\n1:28 Comment: Dazza has a job on now.\n1:30 Comment: Hazard wriggling towards\n1:31 Comment: him and looking to play in. Baba\n1:33 Comment: just got his feet wrong.\n1:36 Comment: Dazza carries it clear.\n1:38 Comment: You get the\n1:39 Comment: feeling, Peter, that if Chelsea were to score\n1:41 Comment: early at the start of this second half,\n1:43 Comment: this could be an avalanche of\n1:45 Comment: goals. Heard the\n1:47 Comment: boys talking at half-time about the possession\n1:49 Comment: stats. 70% in favour of Chelsea.\n1:51 Comment: Just leave it here as Matic\n1:53 Comment: is attacking again. Matic for Oscar\n1:55 Comment: who left it behind\n1:56 Comment: and was in any case offside.\n1:59 Comment: Yes, I fully understand the importance\n2:1 Comment: of possession. 70% is\n2:3 Comment: quite something. But the most important\n2:5 Comment: stat for me are the\n2:7 Comment: attempts on goal. That's where\n2:9 Comment: Chelsea, I think, let themselves down that first\n2:11 Comment: half. Just two attempts on\n2:13 Comment: goal. It's not good enough.\n2:17 Comment: If I'm not mistaken, those\n2:19 Comment: two attempts would be Cahill's header that was saved\n2:21 Comment: and his follow-up that went in.\n2:23 Comment: If they count separately. Well, there was a shot\n2:25 Comment: from Hazard, wasn't it? Outside the box, which\n2:27 Comment: was quite tame\n2:29 Comment: and the keeper made an easy save. Probably\n2:31 Comment: that was included amongst the two attempts on goal.\n2:34 Comment: Push at the back of\n2:35 Comment: Willian.\n2:41 Comment: Which once again looked\n2:42 Comment: penetrative.\n2:47 Comment: He who earned\n2:48 Comment: early penalty at home to Maccabi\n2:51 Comment: scored with a free kick and then\n2:52 Comment: hobbled off midway through the first\n2:55 Comment: half. Still running hard now.\n2:57 Comment: Defensively so to keep\n2:59 Comment: up with Tal Ben-Hain.\n3:1 Comment: And it's not a foul.\n3:2 Comment: Spanish referee is not the flavour of the\n3:5 Comment: day in this stadium.\n3:7 Comment: Ben-Haroosh now from\n3:12 Comment: centre-back since the sending off\n3:14 Comment: of Tal Ben-Hain.\n3:25 Comment: So Harvey.\n3:28 Comment: Higgy Bo.\n3:30 Comment: .\n4:24 Comment: It's a Super Bowl and Das is onside here and Begovic has had to make a terrific stop at his near post.\n4:34 Comment: Hazard looking at Begovic, Begovic looking at Hazard and Mourinho is absolutely fuming with Hazard.\n4:41 Comment: That's lack of responsibility. He's got to do a defensive job there, he allows El Hadassah to go forward.\n4:48 Comment: He could very easily have put this into the back of the net. There's just absolutely no excuse there from Hazard.\n4:59 Comment: So Javi with the corner, Costa with the header out, Fabregas with the clearance.\n5:3 Comment: In again by Dasa who I think couldn't believe the circumstance in which he found himself.\n5:9 Comment: That's a highish foot from Garcia. The flag is up either for that or because anyway he was offside.\n5:18 Comment: Smashing ball from Albon.\n5:21 Comment: It was a good ball but when you consider that Chelsea have got the extra man and that's irresponsible defending there from Hazard.\n5:31 Comment: In the past he's done that once or twice and that's why he's fallen out once or twice with Mourinho.\n5:46 Comment: Oscar.\n5:48 Comment: Flags up against Fabregas.\n5:59 Comment: It is peculiar to be watching a side, Chelsea in this case so evidently comfortable on the whole regardless of that recent alarm for their manager.\n6:9 Comment: And yet so obviously simmering with mild dissatisfaction that things aren't quite how they should be.\n6:16 Comment: Willian.\n6:18 Comment: She finds her value.\n6:19 Comment: And I am Во wanting to be there now.\n6:21 Comment: Answering 귀oke\n6:29 Comment: Weyので to Eugénie.\n6:41 Comment: Big as Guerin.\n6:43 Comment: nói WEY paragraph 2\n6:44 Comment: Ajah.\n6:45 Comment: Fresnelaan futura Melo Não.\n6:46 Comment: 곪� hàng\n6:47 Comment: Well, I can't believe that Hazard didn't go down there\n6:52 Comment: because clearly Iguobor was trailing him.\n6:55 Comment: He put his foot out, clearly caught Hazard.\n6:58 Comment: And Hazard was entitled to go to ground.\n7:0 Comment: The referee would have been forced to give a penalty.\n7:2 Comment: He was too honest for his own good there, Hazard.\n7:7 Comment: Here it is.\n7:8 Comment: Once he goes in the box, there it is.\n7:12 Comment: Should have gone over.\n7:13 Comment: Then he could have taken the penalty\n7:18 Comment: and got his first goal of the season.\n7:20 Comment: Yeah, provided he took a better penalty\n7:22 Comment: than he did against these opponents at Stamford Bridge.\n7:27 Comment: Forward by Peretz, on by Zahavi, chased by Ben Haim\n7:30 Comment: and nudged back, but twitchily by Azpilicueta.\n7:34 Comment: Begovic was closer at hand, I think, than he'd anticipated.\n7:42 Comment: Fabregas.\n7:43 Comment: It's a fine searching ball for Azpilicueta.\n7:47 Comment: Costa.\n7:49 Comment: Shaken off it by Ben Harouch.\n7:53 Comment: Peretz.\n7:54 Comment: I'll be telling you, we're playing with some belief here.\n8:0 Comment: Matic.\n8:1 Comment: The fact that they are pushing forward, looking for an equaliser,\n8:3 Comment: really will suit Chelsea,\n8:5 Comment: because they'll find more and more space to which they can exploit.\n8:9 Comment: Costa.\n8:10 Comment: Pulling his way to the byline.\n8:11 Comment: Couldn't keep the ball with him.\n8:13 Comment: Hickey ball.\n8:14 Comment: Zahavi.\n8:15 Comment: Dazzo's really gone on a long burst to keep that in play, all in vain.\n8:32 Comment: Fabregas.\n8:38 Comment: Hazard.\n8:43 Comment: Costa.\n8:46 Comment: Azpilicueta.\n8:47 Comment: Willian.\n8:53 Comment: On by Costa.\n8:54 Comment: Here's Matic.\n8:57 Comment: It's a sweet ball for Baba.\n9:0 Comment: Baba's pull back.\n9:3 Comment: And he'll get another go.\n9:5 Comment: Ball had rolled behind, and it is a goal kick.\n9:10 Comment: Excellent ball for Matic.\n9:12 Comment: Picking out the runner.\n9:13 Comment: Zagreb has the assist, with a fitting save.\n9:16 Comment: Babber.\n9:17 Comment: He looks off, waits for the movement,\n9:18 Comment: tries to pick out Hazard.\n9:21 Comment: Just not running for him, is it, at the moment?\n9:24 Comment: But there are already signs that, when Chelsea do break forward,\n9:27 Comment: that second goal is not too far away.\n9:31 Comment: I think the player who's going to benefit mostly from the fact that they are with an extra man\n9:34 Comment: is Fabregas.\n9:38 Comment: he's been allowed now just to slightly play,\n9:39 Comment: a little bit more advance than Matic.\n9:40 Comment: he's already made two very good runs,\n9:42 Comment: Don't be surprised if he gets on the score sheet.\n9:49 Comment: Jose Mourinho did quote yesterday in his press conference\n9:52 Comment: the example from last year of Maribor,\n9:56 Comment: who were the weak team in Chelsea's Champions League group.\n9:59 Comment: Maribor of Slovenia, who they thumped at Stamford Bridge\n10:2 Comment: but found much more cussed opponents on their own ground.\n10:6 Comment: Having won comfortably against Maccabi Tel Aviv at home,\n10:10 Comment: Mourinho warned that it might be a little different\n10:12 Comment: and despite their loss of a man,\n10:15 Comment: they're playing with genuine purpose here.\n10:18 Comment: Sahavi.\n10:21 Comment: Tel Benhaim.\n10:26 Comment: Benhaim's cross.\n10:28 Comment: Away by Matic.\n10:29 Comment: He'll get the chance to re-deliver.\n10:32 Comment: Not so much on it for Peretz and it's behind.\n10:40 Comment: Excited bit of play there for Benhaim.\n10:42 Comment: Which has certainly given the home supporters a bit of a lift.\n10:45 Comment: He literally turned Cahill not once but twice inside out.\n10:49 Comment: And the cross wasn't too bad either.\n10:51 Comment: Music to the ears of Slavica Jokanovic,\n10:55 Comment: who will be grateful for this understanding support.\n11:2 Comment: Noisier in arrears and a man down than they were at times\n11:6 Comment: at 0-0 and 11 a side.\n11:11 Comment: Jokanovic.\n11:18 Comment: So 1,\n11:20 Comment: Terry in that side 2.\n11:22 Comment: Bosnic, Lampard, Hasselbeck,\n11:24 Comment: Zola, Zendon.\n11:25 Comment: Jokanovic.\n11:26 Comment: FANS SING\n11:29 Comment: FWARD BY FABRICAS, CHASED BY ASPILICUETA,\n11:46 Comment: BIODOSCA AND KOSTA.\n11:48 Comment: And it fell kindly for Albemarle.\n11:51 Comment: And that's worth Chelsea getting success at the moment\n11:54 Comment: in wide areas, as you would expect,\n11:55 Comment: with the extra man, the two full-backs very much in prominence.\n11:59 Comment: We saw Baba a couple of minutes ago getting in behind\n12:2 Comment: quite easily from a good ball from Matic.\n12:5 Comment: And on that occasion, I think it was Fabregas with a pass,\n12:8 Comment: picking out the forward run of Aspilicueta.\n12:25 Comment: FANS SING\n14:55 Comment: Rika.\n15:13 Comment: Saved by Cahill.\n15:16 Comment: That's what a throw for Chelsea.\n15:19 Comment: Well, the best compliment I can tell you,\n15:21 Comment: Maccabi Tel Aviv at this moment,\n15:23 Comment: is that you wouldn't know that they're actually playing\n15:25 Comment: with a man short.\n15:26 Comment: When you consider that they're pointless,\n15:28 Comment: I mentioned earlier,\n15:29 Comment: possibly the worst team amongst the 32\n15:31 Comment: in this Champions League,\n15:33 Comment: Chelsea should be far, far more dominant\n15:35 Comment: than what they are at this moment.\n15:38 Comment: Here's Baba, seeking to change that dynamic.\n15:41 Comment: Garcia away from in front of Costa.\n15:42 Comment: Here's a Chelsea corner.\n15:51 Comment: Joe Willian is labouring across to take.\n15:55 Comment: Costa closest to the young goalkeeper.\n15:58 Comment: Now, Oscar going to tread on his toes.\n16:2 Comment: Terry on the edge of the six-yard box.\n16:4 Comment: Matic behind him.\n16:9 Comment: Elias Piliqueta's been left behind.\n16:11 Comment: And there are two or three little subplots\n16:15 Comment: developing inside the six-yard box.\n16:25 Comment: Willian's delivery.\n16:27 Comment: Goalkeeper got hands on it.\n16:33 Comment: Here for his clearance.\n16:35 Comment: Cahill had retreated to take it back.\n16:37 Comment: Fabregas has eased it in.\n16:38 Comment: Garcia away.\n16:40 Comment: Hazard!\n16:41 Comment: Oh, brilliant save.\n16:42 Comment: What a reaction from Rajkovic.\n16:45 Comment: Great bit of action, wasn't it?\n16:47 Comment: Superb effort from Hazard.\n16:49 Comment: And an equally good save from Rajkovic.\n16:55 Comment: Willian.\n16:57 Comment: Oscar.\n16:58 Comment: Hazard.\n17:2 Comment: That was ball in.\n17:4 Comment: And Rajkovic reacted to Hazard.\n17:5 Comment: Piliqueta with a further quite brilliant block.\n17:10 Comment: Fabregas has it back.\n17:14 Comment: Hazard.\n17:15 Comment: Piliqueta.\n17:17 Comment: Fabregas.\n17:19 Comment: Couldn't set it back for Hazard.\n17:21 Comment: And Rikian emerges.\n17:23 Comment: And Zahavi is onside here.\n17:25 Comment: And...\n17:26 Comment: Zahavi!\n17:31 Comment: Begovic applied a finger.\n17:33 Comment: What a save that was from Begovic.\n17:35 Comment: Zahavi strikes it.\n17:36 Comment: He thinks he's scored.\n17:39 Comment: He would have done it if it wasn't for a brilliant finger\n17:41 Comment: save from Begovic.\n17:43 Comment: But how could Chelsea get done on the counter-attack?\n17:49 Comment: That is a fine save.\n17:51 Comment: After two at the other end.\n17:55 Comment: Well, there are two players in the Mokavi Tel Aviv side\n18:1 Comment: of whom the major scouts are most aware.\n18:6 Comment: The goalkeeper and the centre-forward.\n18:7 Comment: And we've seen a flash of them both in the last minute or so.\n18:11 Comment: The young Serbian keeper, brilliantly acrobatic and firm-wristed.\n18:15 Comment: And the somewhat more experienced Erhan Zahavi,\n18:20 Comment: the striker and captain, speeding forward on the counter-attack\n18:26 Comment: and bringing a brilliant, brilliant save from Begovic.\n18:42 Comment: Benhaim.\n18:44 Comment: Begovic kicks it off and gets rid.\n18:49 Comment: Azhar.\n18:50 Comment: Oscar.\n19:4 Comment: Willian.\n19:11 Comment: Oscar tackled fairly by Igiobor.\n19:18 Comment: Matic.\n19:20 Comment: Fabregas.\n19:23 Comment: Azhar.\n19:26 Comment: Aimed beyond Costa.\n19:28 Comment: Out in the air by Benharush.\n19:30 Comment: Cleared by Garcia.\n19:31 Comment: Willian can keep it alive.\n19:34 Comment: Fabregas.\n19:37 Comment: Kicked off by Rikan.\n19:39 Comment: Tal Benhaim.\n19:42 Comment: Igiobor.\n19:44 Comment: Foul by Matic.\n19:46 Comment: Oh, that was a bit harsh.\n19:46 Comment: I think Matic made a good challenge there.\n19:49 Comment: Chelsea, we're in a...\n19:50 Comment: excellent situation with Matic about to free up Hazard.\n19:56 Comment: It's a good tackle, isn't it?\n19:57 Comment: I think it's a good tackle.\n19:58 Comment: I think the referee has got most things right tonight.\n20:0 Comment: But not on that occasion.\n20:2 Comment: I think Mr Mourinho agrees with me.\n20:5 Comment: He does.\n20:6 Comment: And there has been a further development in Porto.\n20:9 Comment: Porto nil.\n20:9 Comment: Dinamo Kiev two.\n20:11 Comment: Gonzalez the goal scorer.\n20:13 Comment: Mistake, I'm told, by Iker Casillas in a Porto goal.\n20:17 Comment: And what that means is, regardless of Chelsea's,\n20:20 Comment: the likely victory here tonight, though by no means certain,\n20:23 Comment: regardless, nothing will be decided this evening.\n20:26 Comment: The whole of the Group G denouement\n20:31 Comment: is going to be saved for matchday six\n20:33 Comment: when Dinamo Kiev are at home to Maccabi Tel Aviv\n20:37 Comment: and Chelsea are at home to Porto.\n20:46 Comment: Reminder that tonight from 10 o'clock on BT,\n20:50 Comment: BT Sport Europe.\n20:51 Comment: We have highlights from all the way around Europe,\n20:53 Comment: including, of course, the Arsenal game,\n20:55 Comment: Barcelona-Roma and several other significant matches.\n20:58 Comment: 10 o'clock, BT Sport Europe tonight.\n21:0 Comment: Tomorrow, half past six, Champions League tonight on BT Sport Europe,\n21:4 Comment: preparing you for our live game.\n21:5 Comment: Seven o'clock, Juventus against Manchester City.\n21:8 Comment: It's all about winning the group for City.\n21:9 Comment: BT Sport two.\n21:10 Comment: 7.30, Manchester United, PSV, BT Sport Europe.\n21:14 Comment: Manchester United qualify if they win.\n21:20 Comment: 2-0.\n21:21 Comment: PSV, 3-0.\n21:23 Comment: 2-0, 2-0.\n21:24 Comment: 2-0.\n21:28 Comment: 2-0, 2-0.\n21:29 Comment: Another careless pass given away there by Hazard,\n21:32 Comment: and it brought another furious reaction from Mourinho,\n21:35 Comment: who quickly signalled to Petro to get warmed up.\n21:39 Comment: Just keep your eye on that to see if he brings Hazard off.\n21:42 Comment: 2-0.\n21:43 Comment: But Mourinho, understandably so, is not happy.\n21:47 Comment: 2-0.\n21:50 Comment: And there is indeed movement on the Chelsea bench.\n21:55 Comment: Iggy Ball.\n21:56 Comment: Alba Man.\n21:59 Comment: Outsteps has Pilaqueta.\n22:1 Comment: In goes Alba Man again.\n22:2 Comment: Ben Harouch.\n22:5 Comment: Just more than a quarter of the game to play.\n22:8 Comment: I can see the fourth official's board,\n22:10 Comment: and I think I saw a red number 10,\n22:11 Comment: which means Hazard could be for the hook at any moment.\n22:15 Comment: That is a stress subject to confirmation.\n22:18 Comment: It's not confirmed.\n22:20 Comment: Just a little eavesdropping glimpse I got.\n22:23 Comment: Here's Fabregas.\n22:24 Comment: Pedro it is who's going to come on.\n22:28 Comment: Ben Harouch comes across.\n22:30 Comment: Fabregas has gone to ground.\n22:31 Comment: Chelsea have a free kick.\n22:38 Comment: And here is the change.\n22:41 Comment: And yes, it is Hazard who is being replaced, Trevor.\n22:47 Comment: Well, we couldn't have a better position than what we are.\n22:49 Comment: We're direct.\n22:50 Comment: We're directly behind the technical area.\n22:52 Comment: And I've been watching Jose Mourinho, his antics,\n22:56 Comment: and he's not been happy all match.\n22:58 Comment: And the moment that Hazard gave that ball away,\n23:2 Comment: he immediately signalled to Pedro to get warmed up.\n23:5 Comment: I have to say, I think it's a little bit harsh.\n23:11 Comment: Well, Chelsea do have sufficient strength\n23:14 Comment: to throw on a three-times Champions League winner\n23:16 Comment: as their substitute.\n23:20 Comment: But they need to go on and get the ball back.\n23:22 Comment: And I think that's why they need to go on.\n23:23 Comment: They need to play at full power.\n23:24 Comment: That's why they need to play at full power.\n23:25 Comment: It's a great performance.\n23:26 Comment: And it's a great performance.\n23:26 Comment: That's a great performance.\n23:26 Comment: It's a great performance.\n23:26 Comment: That's only started one Champions League game this season.\n23:29 Comment: That was in Porto.\n23:32 Comment: That was Pedro.\n23:35 Comment: He is a reigning champion.\n23:39 Comment: Come on.\n23:39 Comment: It's a substitute against Juventus in May's final.\n23:45 Comment: I don't think I'm wrong in saying that with ten men,\n23:49 Comment: Maccabi Tel Aviv...\n23:49 Comment: played better in the second half than they actually did in the first.\n23:52 Comment: And I think that so much of football is actually in the mind.\n23:56 Comment: And quite clearly, they've come out in the second half\n23:58 Comment: with nothing to lose, a man short.\n24:2 Comment: Fabregas over the top for Costa, that's out of the way.\n24:5 Comment: And they just totally freed themselves up.\n24:7 Comment: They played without any fear at all.\n24:9 Comment: They were tense in the first half.\n24:11 Comment: Second half, they just played with total freedom.\n24:14 Comment: Fabregas, William, challenged by Olbermann, free kick.\n24:18 Comment: And this is in William's 8-1 position.\n24:32 Comment: Pretty clear body check.\n24:37 Comment: And if William were given permission to pick the ball up and put it down,\n24:42 Comment: he probably wouldn't put it down very far from here.\n24:45 Comment: Chelsea are looking to get the trainer on\n24:47 Comment: because Johnson...\n24:48 Comment: Terry looks to be in a little bit of discomfort there.\n24:51 Comment: It's unusual to see him on the floor.\n24:53 Comment: And it wouldn't surprise me if he has to come off.\n24:59 Comment: Sometimes has a problem with his back, doesn't he?\n25:2 Comment: It was hard off the back of that moment\n25:5 Comment: when he had got up the field and was contesting possession ruggedly.\n25:9 Comment: Here it is with Olbermann.\n25:12 Comment: Went over and it was a jarring fall at the base of his spine.\n25:18 Comment: He's got a little bit of a problem with his back.\n25:26 Comment: He's clearly fallen awkwardly and done himself a little bit of damage.\n25:29 Comment: I can't quite see where the problem is, but...\n25:32 Comment: They are going to replace him. Kurt Zouma's been called in.\n25:35 Comment: And John Terry's coming off.\n25:42 Comment: A chance to enjoy the acrobatics of Greg Rijkovic.\n25:46 Comment: I think a close call.\n25:47 Comment: And a quarter from Azpilicueta. That's an even better save.\n25:52 Comment: But Rijkovic matched it.\n25:54 Comment: And then eyeball to eyeball.\n25:56 Comment: With the air hand, Zahavi.\n26:0 Comment: That's not a pretty picture for Chelsea supporters.\n26:4 Comment: John Terry needing help off the field.\n26:17 Comment: And Kurt Zouma is his replacement.\n26:31 Comment: This is certainly an unscheduled change for Jose Mourinho.\n26:36 Comment: It ought to be remotely disruptive.\n26:40 Comment: But...\n26:42 Comment: Number five, Zouma.\n26:44 Comment: You may be hoping that...\n26:46 Comment: John Terry's problem...\n26:48 Comment: doesn't stretch beyond this evening.\n26:54 Comment: Its impact.\n26:57 Comment: So, William behind the dead ball.\n26:59 Comment: That was entirely predictable.\n27:5 Comment: Just left of centre.\n27:7 Comment: Which is where he'd want it.\n27:10 Comment: Five direct free kicks have borne fruit for him this season.\n27:14 Comment: One of those against these opponents.\n27:15 Comment: William.\n27:17 Comment: Gorgeous.\n27:19 Comment: It's what he does.\n27:21 Comment: Chelsea's specialist.\n27:23 Comment: Comes up with the goods again.\n27:27 Comment: Rijkovic without an earthly.\n27:29 Comment: And Chelsea now surely with the points.\n27:31 Comment: And they're going to be the finalists.\n27:33 Comment: And it's a good one.\n27:43 Comment: Fernandinhoarez into the fourth quarter never steps up.\n27:46 Comment: G når ed projectile\n28:10 Comment: He knows the talk.\n28:11 Comment: or actually sit and watch it.\n28:15 Comment: He can't get near it.\n28:17 Comment: Absolutely brilliant.\n28:19 Comment: Top class, Willian.\n28:21 Comment: And Willian has now scored with a set-piece\n28:23 Comment: in four of five Champions League games this season.\n28:27 Comment: Home and away against Maccabi in Porto\n28:30 Comment: and at home to Dinamo Kiev.\n28:34 Comment: Somebody said before the game,\n28:35 Comment: where would they have been without him this year?\n28:37 Comment: But it feels altogether more comfortable now.\n28:46 Comment: Dress-up.\n28:48 Comment: Wrestling with Baba,\n28:52 Comment: who is deemed to have fouled him.\n29:7 Comment: He's been excellent, hasn't he?\n29:8 Comment: Elidasa in this second half.\n29:10 Comment: More so than the first half.\n29:13 Comment: He's got forward on numerous occasions\n29:15 Comment: down this right-hand side.\n29:18 Comment: I think that's one of the reasons\n29:19 Comment: why Mourinho has brought Pedron\n29:21 Comment: to play on this left-hand side,\n29:24 Comment: just to try and track the runs.\n29:26 Comment: I mean, on this occasion, it was Baba,\n29:28 Comment: a recognised left-back,\n29:29 Comment: but he couldn't do it.\n29:31 Comment: He's fouled Elidasa\n29:33 Comment: and gives the home side a chance\n29:35 Comment: of responding.\n29:37 Comment: That's second goal.\n29:42 Comment: Rikhan with whip.\n29:44 Comment: Zouma in the way.\n29:46 Comment: Benhaim, Rikhan into the crowd.\n29:49 Comment: Came out to Albemont.\n29:53 Comment: Benhaim was still wandering back\n29:54 Comment: from an offside position.\n29:57 Comment: Well, he has every reason\n29:58 Comment: to feel pride\n30:0 Comment: in the performance of certainly his ten men.\n30:3 Comment: No doubt he feels considerable irritation\n30:6 Comment: at...\n30:8 Comment: the contribution of the 11th.\n30:10 Comment: Tal Benhaim, who was sent off\n30:11 Comment: for the most ridiculous kick\n30:13 Comment: towards the end of the first half.\n30:16 Comment: They've shown great fibre.\n30:18 Comment: The 21 times champions of Israel,\n30:21 Comment: certainly the most decorated club in this land.\n30:24 Comment: Champions the last three years.\n30:28 Comment: After a solid enough start.\n30:29 Comment: Leaders of their league\n30:30 Comment: after the weekend results again.\n30:34 Comment: Azpilicueta.\n30:37 Comment: And here comes Fabregas.\n30:39 Comment: And here comes Dassa.\n30:42 Comment: Fabregas, Oscar.\n30:46 Comment: He became Dassa.\n30:49 Comment: Beautifully flighty ball from Fabregas.\n30:52 Comment: Picking out Oscar.\n30:53 Comment: But why did Oscar try and flick it off\n30:55 Comment: to a colleague who wasn't anywhere near him?\n30:58 Comment: He had the option of either hitting it on the volley\n31:0 Comment: or having a touch and finishing off.\n31:5 Comment: Pedro.\n31:7 Comment: Baba, pace on the cross, 3-0 Chelsea.\n31:13 Comment: Oscar scurrying in to put the result beyond all doubt.\n31:19 Comment: Finally, they've put Maccabi away.\n31:23 Comment: Well, crosses don't come any better than this.\n31:27 Comment: Curled around the defender, plenty of pace.\n31:31 Comment: So inviting for forwards to get on the end of it.\n31:34 Comment: Have a look at this for a cross.\n31:37 Comment: After 77...\n31:38 Comment: Centre the goal, Oscar meets it, full on with his head,\n31:42 Comment: just has to make good contact, directed towards goal,\n31:46 Comment: and he doesn't make any mistake at all.\n31:49 Comment: Missed an opportunity some 60 seconds ago,\n31:51 Comment: but he makes up for it with that bullet header.\n31:55 Comment: And Chelsea now are running away with this game,\n31:58 Comment: as we anticipated after the sending off of Ben Aïm.\n32:3 Comment: And Oscar has his first goal.\n32:5 Comment: For ten weeks.\n32:8 Comment: Therefore, his first goal since last he scored against Maccabi Tel Aviv,\n32:12 Comment: with their second penalty of that night at Stamford Bridge.\n32:22 Comment: And having done themselves proud,\n32:24 Comment: now I wonder whether actually Maccabi Tel Aviv would be glad to hear the final whistle,\n32:28 Comment: because there could be a punishing quarter of an hour ahead for them here.\n32:31 Comment: Here we go.\n32:33 Comment: Here's Chelsea.\n32:35 Comment: In the mood to polish things up.\n32:39 Comment: Just a reminder, if Chelsea win, which they surely will,\n32:42 Comment: and also Dinamo Kiev win,\n32:46 Comment: then the whole thing goes to the final day,\n32:48 Comment: and more or less all things are still possible.\n32:50 Comment: Of course, Maccabi Tel Aviv are out of it altogether.\n32:56 Comment: Chelsea have one final change to make,\n32:59 Comment: and Willian, I'm certain there's no reflection on his performance,\n33:3 Comment: rather it is a reflection of the need,\n33:6 Comment: to keep him fresh for White Hart Lane on Sunday.\n33:8 Comment: Willian is being withdrawn,\n33:11 Comment: and Loic Remy is going to play the last 12 minutes in his stead.\n33:18 Comment: Don't forget that that's first Chelsea game.\n33:22 Comment: Willian, presumably included,\n33:23 Comment: is live for you on BT Sport 1 on Sunday from 11.15.\n33:35 Comment: Rikan.\n33:35 Comment: He buys a Harvey.\n33:53 Comment: Fabregas.\n33:55 Comment: Oscar.\n33:55 Comment: Rika.\n34:0 Comment: Baba.\n34:5 Comment: ,\n34:7 Comment: Rika.\n34:8 Comment: Delicious cross from the left back.\n34:9 Comment: Those are the local Chelsea fans to whom I was referring earlier.\n34:15 Comment: Thrilled for them to see their club on their territory.\n34:21 Comment: We've started the game with two Tel Ben Haim's.\n34:23 Comment: We're going to finish it with neither of them.\n34:26 Comment: This one being replaced by Aiden Ben Bassat,\n34:32 Comment: who has played a lot of football.\n34:35 Comment: He's had a lot of his career in France, actually,\n34:37 Comment: most recently with Toulouse.\n34:40 Comment: That's a very good international goal scoring record.\n34:43 Comment: Better for Israel, actually, than his club of late.\n34:46 Comment: Seven goals in 13 caps.\n34:49 Comment: Pedro.\n34:54 Comment: Oldham on the way.\n34:58 Comment: Zahavi.\n35:1 Comment: With the number nine on, you might see Zahavi play from a little bit further away.\n35:3 Comment: Zahavi.\n35:6 Comment: A little deeper.\n35:10 Comment: Alongside Ben Bassat.\n35:13 Comment: Ben Harouch.\n35:17 Comment: Zahavi.\n35:19 Comment: Igbo.\n35:21 Comment: Perez.\n35:23 Comment: Dassa.\n35:28 Comment: Igbo.\n35:35 Comment: That's a...\n35:42 Comment: Spotted by Azpilicueta.\n35:45 Comment: Yes, it was a good interception.\n35:47 Comment: He's done that on numerous occasions this evening.\n35:49 Comment: He's looked very lively.\n35:51 Comment: Azpilicueta probably benefited from not playing at the weekend.\n35:56 Comment: Abregas for Costa.\n35:59 Comment: He's burst his way through Diego Costa.\n36:1 Comment: Having it taken off his toe by Garcia.\n36:11 Comment: It's all against Norwich on Saturday.\n36:14 Comment: Followed six games without a goal.\n36:27 Comment: So this Group G is building up into quite a climate.\n36:30 Comment: Yes.\n36:31 Comment: And Chelsea against Porto at Stamford Bridge\n36:34 Comment: Wednesday 9th December.\n36:36 Comment: It's quite a game now.\n36:38 Comment: All sorts of permutations will be available\n36:41 Comment: with Dynamo Kiev keeping themselves in the equation too.\n36:44 Comment: Porto 10, Chelsea 10, Kiev 8.\n36:47 Comment: One game to play.\n36:49 Comment: His game...\n36:51 Comment: From his point of view, merely for decoration.\n36:54 Comment: Oscar having finished him off with that header.\n37:1 Comment: That's it.\n37:4 Comment: Chelsea and Porto will be hoping that Maccabi Tel Aviv\n37:8 Comment: put in a shift when they go to Kiev for that game\n37:12 Comment: because that result could have a bearing\n37:16 Comment: on the fortunes of one or the other.\n37:31 Comment: It will be job well and\n37:49 Comment: simply and what a draw it's going to be.\n37:51 Comment: And again we can't be stood all day\n37:54 Comment: and he's with Democrats.\n37:57 Comment: And there's Jerry Fajardo.\n37:58 Comment: It's easy to say and let Ma борe be like his fromdock.\n38:0 Comment: Oscar\n38:3 Comment: Baba\n38:5 Comment: wrapped his foot round it\n38:7 Comment: Costa went in\n38:8 Comment: Ben Harush was strong in the challenge\n38:10 Comment: necessarily so\n38:11 Comment: that was an example there\n38:15 Comment: where Baba\n38:16 Comment: running to the byline at speed\n38:19 Comment: could only put that ball in one area\n38:20 Comment: that was at the near post\n38:22 Comment: once again I was looking at Diego Costa\n38:24 Comment: he was motionless\n38:25 Comment: he's got to be breaking his neck to get across that front post\n38:29 Comment: Pedro\n38:30 Comment: Fabregas\n38:32 Comment: he's kept going\n38:35 Comment: on Ben Harush\n38:36 Comment: it's yellow\n38:38 Comment: I wonder too Trevor\n38:40 Comment: what a stupid challenge\n38:41 Comment: 3-0 up with what 10 minutes to go\n38:44 Comment: it clearly goes up the ball here\n38:47 Comment: watch this\n38:52 Comment: once you put your studs up like that\n38:54 Comment: you're asking for trouble\n38:56 Comment: just a booking for\n38:59 Comment: Cesc Fabregas\n39:0 Comment: he's quickly off the scene of the crime\n39:5 Comment: I think the Spanish referee did him a huge favour there\n39:10 Comment: another change for the home side\n39:15 Comment: Gal Alverman has had\n39:17 Comment: a very efficient\n39:20 Comment: sturdy game in holding midfield\n39:22 Comment: and gives way to a European\n39:25 Comment: debutant here 25 year old\n39:27 Comment: Shlomi Azulay\n39:29 Comment: who is just back from a period\n39:31 Comment: on the sidelines injured\n39:33 Comment: a new signing from Betar Jerusalem\n39:35 Comment: second sub\n39:36 Comment: for Maccabi Tel Aviv\n39:38 Comment: number 16\n39:39 Comment: Shlomi Azulay\n39:40 Comment: replaced number 6\n39:42 Comment: Gal Alverman\n39:44 Comment: Baba\n39:59 Comment: with дети Perez\n40:2 Comment: kick off the 19th minute\n40:5 Comment: pass luckily\n40:6 Comment: Ben Bassat\n40:11 Comment: he Beast\n40:15 Comment: he's away\n40:21 Comment: tonight\n40:25 Comment: that's Piri Picueta\n40:26 Comment: proved it\n40:27 Comment: Ben Bassat\n40:29 Comment: Fabregas\n40:34 Comment: Remy\n40:38 Comment: Petro\n40:45 Comment: decent crowd\n40:47 Comment: from the moment you saw the keeper\n40:52 Comment: Rijkaard scurrying across that goal\n40:54 Comment: you realise that this is going to be\n40:57 Comment: close to number four\n40:58 Comment: looking at the keeper's position\n41:6 Comment: I think if it had been on target\n41:7 Comment: I think he would have made the save to be fair\n41:9 Comment: he's been quite impressive tonight the goalkeeper\n41:12 Comment: they considered it a real coup\n41:16 Comment: when they got him from Red Star Belgrade\n41:18 Comment: because some headline\n41:20 Comment: clubs were in the mix\n41:22 Comment: but\n41:22 Comment: he knew he'd get a first team chance here\n41:26 Comment: and a chance to shine\n41:28 Comment: on this sort of stage\n41:29 Comment: and he certainly has shone\n41:30 Comment: goalkeeper\n41:35 Comment: who was part of the Serbian team\n41:37 Comment: that won the under 20 World Cup in New Zealand\n41:39 Comment: this year\n41:41 Comment: he was voted the best goalkeeper in that tournament\n41:43 Comment: Rijkaard has had his moments too\n41:53 Comment: you might remember\n41:54 Comment: Rijkaard the young goalkeeper\n41:56 Comment: to whom I'm referring was quite lucky\n41:58 Comment: to stay on inside the first five minutes\n42:0 Comment: at Stamford Bridge\n42:0 Comment: when he brought down Willian\n42:2 Comment: for the penalty that Hazard missed\n42:4 Comment: Fabregas\n42:27 Comment: it's a beautifully steered ball\n42:29 Comment: that's Piliqueta\n42:35 Comment: Fabregas\n42:37 Comment: Matic\n42:41 Comment: Fabregas\n42:45 Comment: Pedro\n42:47 Comment: sweet feet from Pedro\n42:50 Comment: he's wide again\n42:53 Comment: I was about to say that Pedro really should have played the 1-2 with Oscar\n42:56 Comment: who refused to put Oscar out there\n42:57 Comment: but then the shot\n43:1 Comment: has the goalkeeper on his heels\n43:3 Comment: wrong footed\n43:5 Comment: and he very nearly made it four\n43:8 Comment: he's looked sharp hasn't he Pedro since he's come on\n43:11 Comment: there he has he's impacted favourably\n43:15 Comment: this last substitution is probably to allow Eran Zahavi his\n43:20 Comment: personal ovation\n43:22 Comment: as he makes his way off after having played a captain's innings\n43:25 Comment: difficult to see here though\n43:27 Comment: but such a wasting team\n43:29 Comment: and motorable circumstances\n43:31 Comment: to be replaced for what remains of it by Barak Izzaki\n43:35 Comment: another Israeli international\n43:38 Comment: trailer\n43:40 Comment: Scott\n43:46 Comment: video\n43:55 Comment: remained unreal for kids small disabilities\n43:56 Comment: because you a little mute what I giving to you there there got you here you needle like

time\n45:6 Comment: disappointment there on the face of Diego Costa because he got on the end of\n45:10 Comment: that cross and his first touch was excellent which set him up for the shot\n45:14 Comment: but equally good was the block from Ben Harush watch this good defending\n45:22 Comment: very well since going in at centre-half in extremis when the Ben Hain was sent\n45:26 Comment:

    "summary": "In a Champions League group-stage match, Maccabi Tel Aviv hosted Chelsea, with Chelsea securing a dominant 4-0 victory. The game unfolded amid scenic conditions near Mount Carmel, with both teams steeped in European ambitions. Chelsea, aiming to qualify for the knockout stages with a win, faced a Maccabi Tel Aviv side struggling to find form in the tournament.\n\nFrom the opening whistle, Chelsea asserted their dominance. The initial exchanges saw Chelsea maintaining possession and searching for openings against a resolute yet tactically inferior Maccabi side. Maccabi's early attempt at putting Chelsea under pressure came from Dor Peretz's header, which overshot the target. This minor scare was dealt with efficiently by John Terry and Gary Cahill, Chelsea's stalwart central defenders, reuniting for this match.\n\nThe 20-year-old Dor Peretz, an emerging talent in Israeli football who had recently made his full international debut, showcased his potential early on but was unable to convert this into a tangible threat. On the other side, Chelsea's composure on a slightly worn pitch began to show dividends as their passing and movement started unlocking Maccabi's defense.\n\nChelsea's first significant opportunity came through a flowing move involving Fabregas, Azpilicueta, and Oscar. The notable interplay among the Chelsea players reflected their increasing control over the game. As Fabregas and Hazard orchestrated the midfield, a neat backheel from Oscar to Azpilicueta almost bore fruit, only for the execution to fall slightly short.\n\nEden Hazard, playing on the left, struggled to find the net as his goal drought for the season continued. His missed penalty in the earlier home game against Maccabi Tel Aviv lingered in memory, and this night proved to be no redemption. Despite this, the fluidity and persistence of Chelsea's attack were evident. Hazard, Oscar, and Costa continually interchanged positions, keeping Maccabi's defenders incessantly occupied.\n\nAs the game progressed, Chelsea's growing comfort was encapsulated in their controlled yet penetrating play. However, it wasn't until the 20-minute mark that they found the breakthrough. From a high-quality delivery by Willian, Gary Cahill’s initial header forced an excellent save from goalkeeper Predrag Rajkovic, only for Cahill to react quickest and convert the rebound. This gave Chelsea a well-deserved lead and further settled their play.\n\nDespite the setback, Maccabi Tel Aviv attempted to respond, primarily through quick counter-attacks. Their efforts often left them exposed at the back, with Chelsea looking to exploit these moments. A particularly notable counter-attack saw Eden Hazard break free, his progress indicative of Chelsea's principal strategy—capitalizing on Maccabi's defensive lapses.\n\nMaccabi’s aggression, albeit misplaced, led to a crucial turning point close to halftime. Tal Ben Haim, a familiar name for Chelsea fans from his previous stint with the Blues, saw red for a reckless challenge on Diego Costa. This left Maccabi Tel Aviv to navigate the remainder of the match with ten men. The sending-off unequivocally tilted the game further in Chelsea's favor.\n\nThe second half began with Chelsea evidently dissatisfied with just a one-goal lead and seeking to capitalize on their numerical advantage. Eden Hazard, although under scrutiny for his defensive lapses, remained a critical part of Chelsea's attacking maneuvers. A spell of increased Maccabi pressure bore fleeting fruit as Elia Dasa found himself with a clear opportunity, only to be thwarted by a vigilant Begovic.\n\nChelsea's mounting pressure paid off when Oscar set up Baba Rahman, whose shot cannoned off the crossbar in a sequence demonstrating Chelsea's relentless forward movement. Rajkovic, the young Serbian goalkeeper, continued to impress with his reflexes, but it was clear the resilience of Maccabi was waning under sustained Chelsea pressure.\n\nAs the game grew older, Fabregas and Hazard’s interplay further fragmented Maccabi's defense. A quintessential moment saw Hazard weaved through the defense, spotting Willian, whose cross narrowly missed Oscar. The near miss was symptomatic of Chelsea's growing dominance and augured more goals.\n\nIn the 76th minute, Chelsea struck again through a magnificent free-kick from Willian. Positioned to the left of the center, his curling shot left Rajkovic rooted to the spot, clinching a 2-0 lead and confirming Chelsea’s command. This set-piece proficiency underlined Willian's value to Chelsea this season, especially in the Champions League.\n\nWith the game opening up further, Chelsea introduced fresh legs, Pedro replacing an underwhelming Hazard. The substitution paid instant dividends. Within minutes, Baba Rahman’s precise cross found Oscar, who finished with a clinical header to make it 3-0. The nature of the cross and its finish underscored Chelsea’s superior technical skills and tactical execution.\n\nMaccabi Tel Aviv, deflated but not entirely out of spirit, continued to press and pieced together some promising sequences. Heran Zahavi, the captain, epitomized their effort and drew a fine save from Begovic. Yet, Chelsea, buoyed by their lead, absorbed these attacks, transitioning back to offensive play smoothly.\n\nThe final minutes saw Chelsea driving forward, utilizing their full strength and squad depth to maintain pressure on the beleaguered Maccabi defense. Zouma's late header from a corner sealed the 4-0 victory. His towering presence and the power of his header reflected Chelsea’s dominance from set-pieces—a theme recurrent throughout the game.\n\nIn summary, Chelsea's comprehensive victory was fashioned through disciplined defense, tactical midfield control, and clinical finishing, particularly from set-plays. Willian’s contributions, Fabregas’s midfield mastery, and the defensive stability provided by Terry and Cahill paved the way for a comfortable win. The result ensured that Chelsea remained in a strong position to advance from the group stage, while Maccabi Tel Aviv faced the continuation of their challenging European campaign."
