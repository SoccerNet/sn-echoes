    "summary": "On a brisk evening, football fans were treated to a captivating encounter as Chelsea faced off against Maccabi Tel Aviv at Bloomfield Stadium. The match, full of pulsating action, ended with a resounding victory for Chelsea, much to the dismay of the home crowd. Chelsea, the visitors, dominated the proceedings from the start and showcased why they are regarded as one of the top teams in European football. Here's a detailed account of how the match unfolded, minute by minute, highlighting key moments and player performances that led to the final scoreline of 0-4 in favor of Chelsea.\n\nThe game kicked off with Chelsea taking the initiative right from the start. With only 15 seconds into the match, the visitors set the tone by drawing a foul from the Maccabi Tel Aviv players. The referee awarded Chelsea an indirect free-kick, signaling their intent to control the game early on. The first few minutes were characterized by a series of throw-ins and clearances as both teams tried to find their rhythm.\n\nIn the 4th minute, Maccabi Tel Aviv registered the first shot of the game, albeit off-target. This was promptly followed by a clearance from Chelsea, who were alert to the attacking threat posed by the home side. Maccabi Tel Aviv's early aggressiveness was met with a sound defensive strategy from Chelsea, who efficiently neutralized their opponent’s advances. \n\nChelsea's patience began to pay off as they started to establish their presence in Maccabi's half. Despite a series of fouls and indirect free-kicks dominating the early exchanges, Chelsea managed to carve out the first clear opportunity in the 14th minute. Willian sent a killer pass into the box, but Diego Costa was unable to capitalize, losing possession to the opposition defense.\n\nThe visitors continued their probing attacks and were rewarded in the 20th minute. Gary Cahill rose above the Maccabi defense to connect with a well-delivered corner kick. Though the keeper managed to parry his header onto the left post, Cahill was quick to react, netting the rebound to give Chelsea their opening goal. With this goal, Chelsea took a 1-0 lead, setting the stage for what would be an eventful first half.\n\nFollowing the goal, Maccabi Tel Aviv attempted to regain control, hoping to find an equalizer. However, their efforts were repeatedly thwarted by a resolute Chelsea defense. As the first half progressed, Chelsea continued to dominate possession and create openings, though Maccabi Tel Aviv did manage some sporadic forays into Chelsea's territory.\n\nDiego Costa and Eden Hazard were at the heart of Chelsea's attacking moves, both players showcasing their skills and creating numerous chances. However, Maccabi Tel Aviv’s defense, despite being under immense pressure, managed to hold firm for most of the first half.\n\nAs halftime approached, tensions flared with Maccabi Tel Aviv being reduced to ten men. Tal Ben Haim received his marching orders after a reckless foul, drastically tipping the scales in favor of Chelsea. This red card further emboldened Chelsea, who piled on the pressure in the dying minutes of the first half but were unable to add to their score before the break.\n\nThe second half began with Maccabi Tel Aviv kicking off and immediately trying to establish an attacking foothold. However, Chelsea’s superior numbers and tactical acumen soon became evident.
