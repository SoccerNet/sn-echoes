black Bayer uniform, yellow boots.\n0:22 Comment: Go.\n0:24 Comment: Hilbert with the ball.\n0:26 Comment: Bayer failed to score in its last two matches in the German championship.\n0:29 Comment: So it's understandable that Roger Schmidt would like to see attacking football today.\n0:37 Comment: Kampl with the ball.\n0:38 Comment: It looks like he will play in midfield today with Bender.\n0:43 Comment: That is how it is.\n0:44 Comment: Although we know Kampl more as an attacking humback.\n0:47 Comment: But Roger Schmidt knows him better than anyone.\n0:51 Comment: Kampl, in fact, became famous playing for his Salzburg.\n0:57 Comment: He scored a lot there.\n0:58 Comment: Well, here we go.\n0:59 Comment: Today Kampl makes his debut in the main lineup.\n1:2 Comment: Wendall walked forward.\n1:3 Comment: Brazilian on the left flank.\n1:5 Comment: Plays Belorabi.\n1:7 Comment: Belorabi on the left, as we see, turns out to be.\n1:10 Comment: Also atypical for this football player.\n1:13 Comment: More often than not, Belorabi still plays as a right attacking player.\n1:19 Comment: Bayer intercepts the ball.\n1:21 Comment: Kampl failed.\n1:23 Comment: Dmir Mehmedi, in my opinion, was unable to catch this ball now.\n1:27 Comment: It seems like it was.\n1:29 Comment: Quite a convenient transfer, but, in my opinion, I didn’t understand my partner.\n1:34 Comment: By the way, what kind of teamwork this Bayer squad may lack.\n1:37 Comment: Mehmedi, Hernandez, Kampl.\n1:40 Comment: These are all newbies.\n1:43 Comment: They did not play at Bayer last season.\n1:46 Comment: Blueberry.\n1:47 Comment: The goalkeeper, who has been defending Bate's goal since 2014, clears the ball.\n1:52 Comment: Before that he played for Neman.\n1:54 Comment: Recognized as the best

play.\n2:15 Comment: The central defender is also injured.\n2:19 Comment: These are the losses.\n2:20 Comment: Well, Hyun Minsung, as we know, left for Tottenham in England.\n2:24 Comment: The pass from Hilbert is beautifully played.\n2:26 Comment: There is no offside.\n2:27 Comment: There is no Belorabi.\n2:28 Comment: There is an offsite.\n2:29 Comment: Still, he recorded an offside position.\n2:32 Comment: The arbitrator who works on this line.\n2:34 Comment: Namely Mario Dix.\n2:37 Comment: Belorabi is in an offside position, of course.\n2:41 Comment: Well, many believe that Bata will be in this group...\n2:46 Comment: Well, I'm ready for an unenviable role.\n2:48 Comment: Still, Barcelona, ​​Roma, Bayer.\n2:51 Comment: But we know that Belarusian football players are much more than capable of surprises.\n2:57 Comment: AND...\n2:58 Comment: The most famous...\n2:59 Comment: The most famous victory in the history of Bate.\n3:0 Comment: This is, of course, a win for Bayern.\n3:2 Comment: In the same season when Bayern won everything.\n3:5 Comment: And this was her only defeat in the Champions League.\n3:9 Comment: After this, Munich won the trophy in 2013.\n3:13 Comment: Roberto Gilbert with the ball on the right flank.\n3:15 Comment: Five with a defender.\n3:16 Comment: The transmission does not go through with Hilbert.\n3:19 Comment: So far everything is fine in defense at Bate.\n3:20 Comment: Gilberta gives the ball back.\n3:24 Comment: It was Mehmedi.\n3:25 Comment: Next was Hilbert.\n3:28 Comment: Papadopoulos.\n3:29 Comment: Chalkhan corner.\n3:32 Comment: Bayer moved to control the ball.\n3:35 Comment: Again Chalhan corner.\n3:36 Comment: Pass to Chicharita.\n3:38 Comment: The ball jumps out.\n3:40 Comment: The football players cannot fight back.\n3:41 Comment: Bate.\n3:42 Comment: And the score becomes 1-0.\n3:44 Comment: Admir Mehmedi opened the scoring in the match with a very beautiful and deft strike.\n3:49 Comment: 1-0.\n3:51 Comment: Yes, Barone suddenly panicked.\n3:54 Comment: At Bate...\n3:55 Comment: The transmission seemed to have come from Chicharit.\n3:59 Comment: Not entirely accurate, but the defenders were unable to clear the ball.\n4:4 Comment: And Admir Mehmedi is right there.\n4:6 Comment: Let's see how things unfolded here.\n4:8 Comment: Dubra seems to be following Hernandez, but misses him.\n4:13 Comment: Here's a pass.\n4:13 Comment: And here, look.\n4:15 Comment: Yes, a very bad mistake.\n4:17 Comment: Who among the Belarusian football players allowed it?\n4:20 Comment: It was none other than Ilya Alekseevich.\n4:24 Comment: Bate also has a loss.\n4:28 Comment: Vitaly Rodionov is absent today.\n4:30 Comment: And this is the team’s top scorer in the Belarusian championship.\n4:34 Comment: He scored 9 goals there.\n4:36 Comment: So today Signevich is at the forefront of the attack.\n4:39 Comment: Immediately Bate walks forward.\n4:40 Comment: And now the moment arises.\n4:42 Comment: Broadcast.\n4:44 Comment: Lenu takes the ball.\n4:46 Comment: It was Gordeichuk who was on the left flank.\n4:49 Comment: Quick goal.\n4:50 Comment: We saw a quick goal in the fourth minute by Admir Mehmedi.\n4:53 Comment: Opened an account.\n4:54 Comment: He scored beautifully, you can’t say anything.\n4:56 Comment: Chernik did not expect this.\n4:58 Comment: Well, after all, Alekseevich made a rather serious mistake there.\n5:8 Comment: He should have kicked the ball out.\n5:9 Comment: Campol.\n5:10 Comment: Let's see how the Belarusians react to this missed goal.\n5:13 Comment: Bayer, of course, takes the ball for themselves.\n5:18 Comment: Apadopoulos.\n5:20 Comment: There.\n5:22 Comment: Good pass.\n5:23 Comment: Chicharit.\n5:26 Comment: Rotation will have to be used one way or another.\n5:28 Comment: Roger Schmidt, if he wants to successfully fight on two fronts.\n5:33 Comment: Well, perhaps the changes are not so much explained by this rotation,\n5:37 Comment: as much as with the coach’s dissatisfaction with the quality of the team’s play in the last match.\n5:43 Comment: Bate, by the way, also failed to win the Belarusian championship in his last match,\n5:46 Comment: where he, however, is a clear and unconditional leader.\n5:50 Comment: Chalhan Oglu did not strike, but now it’s too late.\n5:53 Comment: Belorabi.\n5:54 Comment: Campol.\n5:55 Comment: Pass to Hilbert.\n5:58 Comment: No, such a transfer does not take place.\n6:0 Comment: So, Bate failed to win against Shakhtar.\n6:4 Comment: For many this was unexpected.\n6:8 Comment: But still, they probably kept the Champions League match in mind.\n6:15 Comment: Soligorsk football players managed to win back in this match.\n6:19 Comment: 1-1.\n6:19 Comment: It's over.\n6:20 Comment: The only goal was scored by Stasevich.\n6:21 Comment: Rodionov did not play in the last matches.\n6:28 Comment: Regarding the Champions League qualifying tournament,\n6:33 Comment: then Bate beat Belograd partisans Gordeichuk Stasevich twice here and Zhavnerchik here.\n6:45 Comment: They answered.\n6:47 Comment: True, Zhavnerchik sent his own goal.\n6:49 Comment: Partisan won 2-1 at home.\n6:52 Comment: But Bate passed thanks to a goal scored against someone else.\n6:58 Comment: In this field.\n6:59 Comment: Before that there were matches with Videoton, which were also very difficult.\n7:2 Comment: There Nikulich scored the winning goal in the 82nd minute of the last return match.\n7:8 Comment: However, the 0-0 score suited Bate too.\n7:11 Comment: And in the very first round, which Bate participated in, Dundalk was beaten.\n7:17 Comment: And again, not without a fight.\n7:19 Comment: Every time, the Belarusian football players went forward through the battle, through the torment.\n7:28 Comment: Well, now, while they are, of course, defending, Bayer has complete control of the initiative.\n7:33 Comment: Campol, Papadopoulos, Wendall.\n7:38 Comment: Bayer has a very young defense, I must say.\n7:42 Comment: Its center is especially striking here.\n7:46 Comment: It's rare to see such young central defenders.\n7:50 Comment: Papadopoulos is 23 years old, and Jonathan Tai is 19.\n7:54 Comment: Add here Wendal, 22 years old, and only Hilbert.\n7:58 Comment: That is, it is responsible for experience.\n8:1 Comment: He has already celebrated his 30th birthday.\n8:5 Comment: Well, here's Bate's attack.\n8:7 Comment: Goal kick.\n8:10 Comment: I tried and tried to get to this ball here.\n8:17 Comment: Mladenovic, left back.\n8:19 Comment: But we are once again shown Alekseevich’s mistake.\n8:21 Comment: And, of course, a very beautiful blow from Admir Mehmed.\n8:25 Comment: Here you see Chalkhanuglu.\n8:27 Comment: I fought and forced Alekseevich to make this mistake in many ways.\n8:40 Comment: Mehmedev played for Freiburg last year.\n8:42 Comment: But last season, unlike the previous one, he didn’t have such a great time.\n8:46 Comment: And yet he still deserved an invitation to Liverkusen.\n8:49 Comment: For him, this is, of course, career growth.\n8:51 Comment: Freiburg were eliminated after all.\n8:52 Comment: Well, Mehmede scored a very important goal against Lazio, of course.\n8:57 Comment: When Bayer lost 0-1 in Rome.\n9:1 Comment: And here is the second ball, the winning one in this pair.\n9:7 Comment: Mehmede actually scored at the very beginning of the second half.\n9:11 Comment: A beautiful blow to the neighbor.\n9:13 Comment: Now he opens the scoring with a Bayer goal in this Champions League.\n9:18 Comment: Campol.\n9:18 Comment: So far, only the Liverkusen players have the ball.\n9:23 Comment: Campol gives back.\n9:25 Comment: This is Bernt Lena.\n9:27 Comment: He simply kicks the ball forward.\n9:34 Comment: Mehmed.\n9:35 Comment: Hilbert.\n9:37 Comment: Chicharitto.\n9:38 Comment: New Hilbert.\n9:39 Comment: Transfer to Calhanoglu.\n9:41 Comment: He is in possession of the ball.\n9:42 Comment: Calhanoglu plays Kamplya.\n9:46 Comment: Now Wendl.\n9:47 Comment: Calhanoglu on the flank.\n9:49 Comment: But his left is not very working.\n9:51 Comment: It is necessary to always shift it under his right.\n9:53 Comment: Pass to Kampl.\n9:54 Comment: Campol in the penalty area.\n9:55 Comment: Lumbago!\n9:56 Comment: And dangerous!\n9:57 Comment: What a cool moment!\n9:58 Comment: Chernik helps out.\n9:59 Comment: They were already ready to close this transmission.\n10:1 Comment: Liverkusen people.\n10:2 Comment: Mehmedi.\n10:3 Comment: Bayer goes to score the second goal.\n10:5 Comment: A free kick should be awarded here.\n10:7 Comment: Of course.\n10:12 Comment: Shot down.\n10:12 Comment: A Bayer player is shot down.\n10:14 Comment: Well, now, of course, was a very dangerous moment.\n10:16 Comment: Great.\n10:17 Comment: Bayer carried out this attack well.\n10:20 Comment: The previous episode shows us this.\n10:23 Comment: Kampl's shot.\n10:24 Comment: And Chernik still plays ahead of the curve.\n10:26 Comment: And this, of course, is not only for Bayer.\n10:26 Comment: This is already the previous episode.\n10:27 Comment: And Chichorita was already ready to put the ball into the goal.\n10:30 Comment: Well, this is a foul that Gordiychuk committed on Mehmedi.\n10:35 Comment: Wendal is at the ball.\n10:36 Comment: And Calhanoglu.\n10:37 Comment: Eleven minutes.\n10:38 Comment: 1-0.\n10:39 Comment: Bayer is ahead.\n10:40 Comment: And, of course, Alexander Gleb dominates on the field.\n10:44 Comment: He played here.\n10:45 Comment: And Bayerin, of course, scored against Bayer as part of Stuttgart.\n10:50 Comment: Oh, Calhanoglu's leg has gone.\n10:53 Comment: Blueberry.\n10:54 Comment: Maybe Bate has a counterattack.\n10:55 Comment: The ball flies forward.\n10:56 Comment: Campol is mistaken.\n10:58 Comment: Yes Yes Yes.\n10:59 Comment: Belarusian football players control the ball.\n11:1 Comment: Wendal.\n11:2 Comment: Belorabi.\n11:4 Comment: What does the judge show?\n11:6 Comment: Violation by the player Bate.\n11:13 Comment: Yes, Wendal was hit in the leg here.\n11:16 Comment: It was Alexander Gleb.\n11:19 Comment: A legend, one might say, of Belarusian football.\n11:24 Comment: The man who played...\n11:26 Comment: In Stuttgart, including in the Champions League.\n11:29 Comment: Who played in Arsenal, in Barcelona.\n11:33 Comment: There are few of these, of course, in Belarus.\n11:34 Comment: But now the attack on the right flank is developing.\n11:39 Comment: Stasevich.\n11:40 Comment: The team captain goes forward.\n11:42 Comment: Innings.\n11:43 Comment: Corner kick.\n11:44 Comment: Yes.\n11:45 Comment: The ball went away from Papadopoulos.\n11:47 Comment: And at the 12th minute, or rather, almost until the 13th, the Belarusian football players will take a corner kick.\n11:54 Comment: Well, actually, the first time, in my opinion, they reached Baev’s gate.\n12:4 Comment: Number 13. This is the powerful Nikolai Signevich, the center forward.\n12:9 Comment: But team captain Stasevich will serve.\n12:15 Comment: Canopy.\n12:16 Comment: And a twist kick. And a goal.\n12:19 Comment: Bernd Lehn was unlucky because he seemed to react to this blow.\n12:22 Comment: But it’s very inappropriate for him and useful for Belarusians.\n12:27 Comment: Hilbert set himself up for this ball.\n12:29 Comment: And here the rebound was not in Baev’s favor.\n12:33 Comment: So, one-on-one, with the very first shot, the first approach, it turns out that Bate manages to score on goal.\n12:39 Comment: Yes, Chalhan Uglu won the fight here.\n12:42 Comment: Number 19 Milunovic, central defender.\n12:45 Comment: In general, it was a strange exchange.\n12:47 Comment: Chalhan Uglu, to put it mildly, does not play brilliantly with his head.\n12:49 Comment: But the blow is not so dangerous.\n12:50 Comment: Ready.\n12:51 Comment: Lena was ready for his reflection, if not for the helpfully substituted part of Robert Hilbert’s body.\n13:0 Comment: It didn’t hit my hand, but on the other hand, even if it did, what difference would it make?\n13:5 Comment: A goal is a goal.\n13:6 Comment: Well, just like that, one-on-one. The teams quickly exchanged batted balls.\n13:10 Comment: Already by the 13th minute it was one-on-one.\n13:16 Comment: So the fun began.\n13:21 Comment: Bayer continues to attack.\n13:24 Comment: He will try to pretend that nothing happened.\n13:26 Comment: Good temperature in Liverkusen.\n13:29 Comment: 18-17 degrees.\n13:31 Comment: True, it is quite humid.\n13:33 Comment: But it's already raining in Europe.\n13:35 Comment: In many cities yesterday we saw rain in almost all Champions League matches.\n13:40 Comment: Belarus, this is a violation, yes.\n13:43 Comment: He's wrong. Mladenovic was first on the ball.\n13:46 Comment: And the German national team player knocked him down.\n13:49 Comment: Belorabiya played mainly in the lineup in the meeting with the Polish team.\n13:54 Comment: This is Nemanja Milunovic, yes.\n13:59 Comment: The same football player to whose account the ball was recorded.\n14:2 Comment: Because, of course, there is no own goal here.\n14:4 Comment: Just a ricochet. Calhanoglu, a little later about Milunovich.\n14:7 Comment: But this program was read.\n14:9 Comment: Milunovich is 26 years old.\n14:14 Comment: Well, now the main game.\n14:17 Comment: Playing.\n14:18 Comment: Now the main defender is, of course, Batte.\n14:21 Comment: The team has been greatly updated.\n14:23 Comment: Well, compared, let’s say, with the golden times of Viktor Goncharenko.\n14:27 Comment: And here is another attack by Batte Hilbert.\n14:29 Comment: In general, it must be said that the position of right back,\n14:32 Comment: regardless of the fact that in this case any rebound,\n14:36 Comment: this is of course an accident\n14:38 Comment: in Bayra it is not the strongest.\n14:44 Comment: Because...\n14:46 Comment: E2, if he played, would, of course, be more interesting here than Hilbert.\n14:53 Comment: Well, Giulio Donati fell out of Jerro Schmidt’s confidence.\n14:57 Comment: And very rarely goes out on the floor.\n15:0 Comment: Dmitry Baga.\n15:2 Comment: By the time he was 25, he had already played in the Champions League.\n15:10 Comment: He has played 3-4 matches in total in tournaments with the UFA and 12 in the Champions League.\n15:16 Comment: It is clear that it is impossible to compete with Alexander Gleb here.\n15:19 Comment: He has 53 matches in the Champions League alone.\n15:26 Comment: Bayer with the ball.\n15:27 Comment: Belorabi.\n15:28 Comment: Pass forward.\n15:29 Comment: Chicharrito.\n15:30 Comment: Places the body.\n15:32 Comment: Can't break through it.\n15:36 Comment: Mehmedi.\n15:39 Comment: One more transfer.\n15:40 Comment: Belorabi.\n15:41 Comment: Chicharrito.\n15:42 Comment: Belorabi falls.\n15:43 Comment: Judge.\n15:44 Comment: Play.\n15:45 Comment: The referee from Holland, Makkele, shows the play.\n15:50 Comment: It was a difficult situation.\n15:52 Comment: Belorabi holds his leg.\n15:55 Comment: Complains about injustice.\n15:57 Comment: Let's get a look.\n15:59 Comment: Firstly, Chicharrito was offside.\n16:2 Comment: This time.\n16:4 Comment: Well, this is an ambiguous episode.\n16:7 Comment: It seems to me that Belorabi also grabbed his opponent.\n16:11 Comment: So I think the referee is right.\n16:14 Comment: The fact that he did not award a penalty.\n16:16 Comment: But the fact that the offside position was not recorded.\n16:18 Comment: If he didn’t record the networks, then he’s wrong.\n16:20 Comment: It was offside.\n16:22 Comment: 17th minute.\n16:23 Comment: Bayer Baten.\n16:24 Comment: 1-1.\n16:26 Comment: Veteran Alexander Volochko still remains on the team.\n16:30 Comment: Well, like a veteran.\n16:31 Comment: He's not yet 30.\n16:33 Comment: But now he is no longer a player in the main team.\n16:37 Comment: Well, Alexander Lekhtorovich was even included in the application.\n16:47 Comment: That is, take, of course, Dmitry Lekhtorovich, a 37-year-old midfielder who, of course, was the leader of Baten for many years.\n16:58 Comment: Well, the team is changing gradually.\n17:0 Comment: Another coach, not Viktor Goncharenko, but Alexander Ermakovich leads the team.\n17:5 Comment: And then the transfer.\n17:7 Comment: Wendell.\n17:8 Comment: By the way, it was a simple ball.\n17:10 Comment: The download was not very pleasant for a Brazilian.\n17:13 Comment: Rudy Feller.\n17:15 Comment: The main person when it comes to managing Bayer's sports affairs.\n17:20 Comment: It doesn't concern finances.\n17:22 Comment: He is in charge of managing the club.\n17:25 Comment: All transfer matters, all this, of course, goes to him.\n17:35 Comment: 18th minute.\n17:42 Comment: Kampel.\n17:44 Comment: Pass to Jonathan Ta.\n17:49 Comment: This is another newbie.\n17:51 Comment: He came from Hamburg, but played for Fortuna for the last season.\n17:56 Comment: He was captain of the German junior team.\n18:2 Comment: There they show the goal again.\n18:4 Comment: Well, we probably won’t consider anything new here.\n18:7 Comment: Roberto Gilbert set himself up unsuccessfully.\n18:10 Comment: And the warm-up was unsuccessful.\n18:11 Comment: It is not clear why Chalkhan Oglu was next to the huge defender.\n18:15 Comment: Not at all famous for his head butt.\n18:18 Comment: Moreover, on most passes into someone else’s penalty area, he is the recipient.\n18:23 Comment: He performs these transmissions himself, but does not receive them at all.\n18:28 Comment: Wendell connects.\n18:30 Comment: Pass.\n18:31 Comment: Chalhan Oglu.\n18:32 Comment: tackle.\n18:33 Comment: I did.\n18:34 Comment: Save the ball.\n18:35 Comment: Yes, I managed to keep it with my team.\n18:37 Comment: Papadopoulos.\n18:38 Comment: Pass to Roberto Gilbert.\n18:41 Comment: He is waiting for there to be options to play.\n18:46 Comment: Right now the Liverkusen team lacks movement.\n18:50 Comment: Campol.\n18:51 Comment: Almost lost the ball, but still there was a violation on the part of Signevich.\n18:58 Comment: Got it.\n19:4 Comment: Wendell.\n19:5 Comment: Chalhan Oglu.\n19:6 Comment: Translation to the right.\n19:7 Comment: Hilbert.\n19:8 Comment: Belorabi is reopening.\n19:9 Comment: Hilbert plays with Mehmedi.\n19:10 Comment: He's with the ball again.\n19:15 Comment: Lumbago.\n19:16 Comment: The defenders play reliably, but Byron's attack is not there\n19:23 Comment: finished.\n19:24 Comment: Once again Hilbert tries to give it back.\n19:28 Comment: Papadopoulos.\n19:29 Comment: And the Liverkusen team is moving forward.\n19:30 Comment: Bender.\n19:31 Comment: I missed my step a little now.\n19:32 Comment: Where is she?\n19:33 Comment: Hernandez took a step, but the defenders also became nervous.\n19:37 Comment: They probably could have played more reliably.\n19:38 Comment: They just knocked the ball out.\n19:41 Comment: Well, Chicharit’s mutual understanding with his partners, of course, is not at an ideal level yet.\n19:46 Comment: He did not go through the third season with the team.\n19:48 Comment: I arrived just as the window was closing.\n19:50 Comment: Innings!\n19:51 Comment: The ball is kicked out.\n19:53 Comment: Feandal!\n19:55 Comment: To the breach.\n19:55 Comment: I went to leave the goalkeeper already.\n19:57 Comment: Chernik hesitated a little.\n19:59 Comment: And his partner had to simply knock the ball out of the way.\n20:3 Comment: Yes, when Bayer starts attacking at a high tempo,\n20:7 Comment: He slightly panics at Bate's defenses.\n20:11 Comment: It's not healthy.\n20:15 Comment: You won't be able to score from every corner.\n20:20 Comment: Belorabin.\n20:22 Comment: Hilbert.\n20:24 Comment: As we see, the Liverkusen team puts a very sharp emphasis on the right flank.\n20:28 Comment: Belorabin is there, and Mehmedi is always there.\n20:33 Comment: On the left, in fact, the entire edge is given to Feandal, but sometimes Shalhanugu ends up there.\n20:43 Comment: Since Mehmedi and Belorabin are constantly putting pressure on Mladenovic on the left flank.\n20:48 Comment: Hilbert also supports the attack.\n20:55 Comment: Well, look.\n20:57 Comment: Mehmedi is on the right flank, and Belorabin is also somewhere there.\n21:2 Comment: Nine.\n21:4 Comment: I have never seen such a game from Liverkusen.\n21:7 Comment: But the pass was very bad to Belorabin.\n21:9 Comment: Very strong, very inaccurate.\n21:15 Comment: The formation proposed on the official UEFA website is\n21:20 Comment: it is usually agreed upon with a team representative so that there is no confusion in the schedule.\n21:25 Comment: It implied that Belorabin and Mehmedi would operate on the flanks, but on different ones.\n21:30 Comment: And they are still on one.\n21:31 Comment: This is interesting.\n21:33 Comment: Despite the fact that Campo Liebender holds the center of the field, as, in fact, was stated.\n21:38 Comment: That is, it turns out that there are two players on the right, and none on the left.\n21:41 Comment: It's amazing, but it's true.\n21:44 Comment: Now Belorabin was essentially playing the role of a second striker.\n21:48 Comment: And Mehmedi was closer to the right flank.\n21:54 Comment: That is, we can rather call Belorabin the team’s second striker for now.\n21:59 Comment: Yes.\n21:59 Comment: Yes, we see it was invented by Roger Schmidt.\n22:3 Comment: Yes.\n22:4 Comment: He had not practiced such things before in Livercuse.\n22:8 Comment: Bayer almost always played in a 4-2-3-1 formation.\n22:14 Comment: Today we see something new.\n22:22 Comment: Bender.\n22:26 Comment: Pass to Hilbert.\n22:27 Comment: Bender.\n22:29 Comment: Strong pass to Mehmedi.\n22:31 Comment: That ball was shortened.\n22:33 Comment: They keep trying to play tricks here.\n22:35 Comment: But Batte is now defending with the whole team.\n22:37 Comment: Of course, you can’t open this casket that easily.\n22:44 Comment: Moreover, Bayer is primarily about speed.\n22:48 Comment: Positional play of the ball is not the strongest side of the team's game.\n22:56 Comment: Alexander Ermakovich, Batte's head coach, was Viktor Goncharenko's assistant.\n23:3 Comment: But before that, in fact, Batte was a football player for a long time.\n23:6 Comment: That is, it was such a bet on continuity.\n23:9 Comment: Made.\n23:12 Comment: Mehmedi.\n23:13 Comment: Doesn't work.\n23:14 Comment: The program was too readable.\n23:16 Comment: True, Bayer immediately enters the fight.\n23:17 Comment: This is his signature pressure.\n23:18 Comment: Chalkhan corner.\n23:19 Comment: Left.\n23:21 Comment: Wendal.\n23:22 Comment: Bayer is famous for its ability to win the ball back immediately after a loss.\n23:26 Comment: This pressure is when all the players come into the fight and try to immediately win the ball.\n23:33 Comment: It is very important.\n23:35 Comment: What Roger Schmidt instilled in the team, and what was not there before in Liverkusen.\n23:40 Comment: It’s as if he transported the team from the 20th century straight into the 21st century.\n23:44 Comment: Many people regarded it this way.\n23:47 Comment: In just a few months, he radically changed the team's game.\n23:50 Comment: Well, Roger Schmidt is generally a very interesting person.\n23:54 Comment: A rather atypical biography, I must say.\n23:57 Comment: Well, it's not unusual that he wasn't a famous football player and then became a coach.\n24:2 Comment: No.\n24:3 Comment: If that were all, then you wouldn’t be able to tell much about such people.\n24:10 Comment: It is clear that many coaches were not famous football players.\n24:13 Comment: Take, for example, Jurgen Klop, who was a rather mediocre player.\n24:21 Comment: Bate with the ball.\n24:24 Comment: Mladenovic connected and goes to the center.\n24:26 Comment: Good pass.\n24:28 Comment: There was no handball here to show the referee.\n24:31 Comment: And the draw was not bad.\n24:32 Comment: Now.\n24:33 Comment: The Belarusians also showed that they know how to put pressure.\n24:36 Comment: Right flank attack.\n24:38 Comment: Polyakov, right back.\n24:40 Comment: Canopy.\n24:41 Comment: Another corner.\n24:42 Comment: The first one was earned in approximately the same way.\n24:46 Comment: OK then.\n24:46 Comment: Then about Schmidt a little later.\n24:49 Comment: Here's the transmission.\n24:51 Comment: Jonathan Ta's hand was pinned, so it was probably difficult to count on a penalty here.\n24:59 Comment: It would not have been prescribed.\n25:1 Comment: But one more corner.\n25:3 Comment: Why not.\n25:4 Comment: Where is Milunovich?\n25:7 Comment: Where is Dubra?\n25:9 Comment: Batysh defender.\n25:10 Comment: Innings.\n25:11 Comment: This time Papadopolos kicks the ball out.\n25:14 Comment: And now, in my opinion, this is a conservative option.\n25:21 Comment: They are trying to choose.\n25:22 Comment: Borisov and Batu lose the ball.\n25:24 Comment: The worst possible moment.\n25:25 Comment: Bayer's attack began.\n25:26 Comment: Exit to the gate.\n25:27 Comment: Mehmedi!\n25:28 Comment: The Swiss misses the chance to take Bayer to the penalty spot.\n25:30 Comment: Batysh.\n25:33 Comment: The battle!\n25:35 Comment: Let's turn the ball forward.\n25:36 Comment: Yes, now the mistake should have cost the players\n25:37 Comment: Bate.\n25:38 Comment: Gleb didn’t understand what to do, the speed is already the same\n25:42 Comment: not when I was young.\n25:44 Comment: And, you see, not without breaking the rules.\n25:47 Comment: It’s even possible that Belarabi took the ball away.\n25:48 Comment: But this is his style, constant movement, wonderful passing.\n25:51 Comment: And Mehmedi shoots, but he misses.\n25:54 Comment: The Bate players are lucky now, no doubt.\n25:59 Comment: They gave us the ball themselves.\n26:1 Comment: Who else will do it, like Alexander Gleb.\n26:2 Comment: Alexander Gleb.\n26:4 Comment: Now Bate's attack.\n26:6 Comment: An attempt to throw behind the back.\n26:8 Comment: Hilbert and the long diagonal\n26:10 Comment: It’s just not clear to whom.\n26:16 Comment: So, a little about Roger Schmit.\n26:18 Comment: Interestingly, it's quite early\n26:20 Comment: ending his career due to injuries,\n26:22 Comment: he went to study\n26:24 Comment: and received\n26:26 Comment: engineering diploma\n26:27 Comment: in mechanics.\n26:29 Comment: And what’s more, I didn’t just get a diploma,\n26:31 Comment: he began to work in his specialty.\n26:34 Comment: That is, everything\n26:35 Comment: football career is over.\n26:38 Comment: AND\n26:39 Comment: need to earn money\n26:41 Comment: honest work, sweat and blood\n26:43 Comment: it turns out.\n26:45 Comment: But somehow it happened\n26:47 Comment: that they didn’t forget about him.\n26:50 Comment: And he was invited as a coach\n26:51 Comment: to the Preussen Munster team.\n26:53 Comment: It’s also not an amateur club, to put it mildly.\n26:55 Comment: The team was in the regional league.\n26:57 Comment: Immediately somehow at Schmid's\n26:59 Comment: it went there, they called him\n27:1 Comment: to Paderburn.\n27:4 Comment: And in the end\n27:5 Comment: and so his coaching career turned around.\n27:8 Comment: He was invited to Salzburg.\n27:10 Comment: A very rich club\n27:12 Comment: where Schmidt managed\n27:13 Comment: make the team not only a champion,\n27:15 Comment: but also a very recognizable team.\n27:17 Comment: Salzburg has 100 goals per season there\n27:19 Comment: scored in front of him. Chicharita\n27:21 Comment: hits, Ricochet, now Bayer will\n27:23 Comment: file a criminal complaint.\n27:27 Comment: And when Bayer\n27:29 Comment: needed a new coach\n27:31 Comment: and number one candidate Markus Weinzier\n27:34 Comment: from Augsburg refused them,\n27:36 Comment: we turned to\n27:37 Comment: Schmidt. And they were right.\n27:40 Comment: We can already talk about this.\n27:41 Comment: Bayer has changed a lot under him.\n27:44 Comment: This is such an unusual biography.\n27:46 Comment: Certified engineer\n27:48 Comment: manages now\n27:50 Comment: team.\n27:52 Comment: Angular.\n27:54 Comment: He's acting out. Oh, how dangerous!\n27:56 Comment: And Jonathan Ta\n27:58 Comment: misses the chance again\n28:0 Comment: put Bayer ahead. Suddenly.\n28:1 Comment: Unexpectedly such a prank.\n28:3 Comment: It seems to me that Bayer has surprised me now\n28:4 Comment: with such a sharp, short prank.\n28:7 Comment: Serve to Chalhan Glu.\n28:9 Comment: Chernik hits the ball straight in front of him.\n28:11 Comment: Jonathan Ta\n28:12 Comment: could score.\n28:15 Comment: He hits with a turn,\n28:17 Comment: but the ball flies a little high.\n28:19 Comment: They make too many mistakes of their own\n28:21 Comment: Bate players, after all, I must say.\n28:23 Comment: Gleb is now a goalkeeper\n28:25 Comment: still didn't play well.\n28:28 Comment: Bye Bayer\n28:29 Comment: forgives after\n28:31 Comment: that the score became 1-1 again\n28:32 Comment: very risky, very risky\n28:35 Comment: defenders act.\n28:37 Comment: Bayer is famous for its sharpness\n28:39 Comment: and clarity of selection.\n28:42 Comment: Pressing is what\n28:43 Comment: what you have to take into account when you play\n28:45 Comment: against Bayer.\n28:47 Comment: Under no circumstances should you hold the ball.\n28:50 Comment: It is clear that\n28:50 Comment: defenders are initially put in difficult positions.\n28:54 Comment: If you look at how Bayer presses,\n28:56 Comment: then we will see that often\n28:57 Comment: the defenders have no other choice.\n28:59 Comment: So a replacement is being prepared. Alexander Volodko.\n29:1 Comment: Appears on the field. What's happened?\n29:3 Comment: Got injured? Or decided\n29:5 Comment: Ermakovich change\n29:6 Comment: a little drawing game?\n29:9 Comment: Foul.\n29:11 Comment: The judge records it. Broke a rule\n29:13 Comment: Chicharita. Alexander Gleb\n29:15 Comment: got injured. Just like that.\n29:17 Comment: In that very episode when he was knocked out\n29:19 Comment: not very clean, after all,\n29:21 Comment: It seemed to me that it was Belorabi's ball.\n29:23 Comment: It's through the leg, see?\n29:25 Comment: He hooked it and then took it away.\n29:27 Comment: It was a mistake by the referee after all.\n29:29 Comment: Although this does not change the fact that Gleb is a ball\n29:31 Comment: held. And now at the 30th minute\n29:33 Comment: Alexander Volodko appears on the field\n29:35 Comment: instead of\n29:36 Comment: Alexandra Gleba.\n29:43 Comment: 30 minutes played in the first half.\n29:45 Comment: The score is 1-1.\n29:48 Comment: Although after\n29:48 Comment: Bate scored, of course, Bayer had two\n29:51 Comment: wonderful moments. In Mehmedi and Ta.\n29:54 Comment: To again\n29:55 Comment: come forward.\n30:1 Comment: Belorabi.\n30:11 Comment: Nice pass.\n30:14 Comment: Hilbert.\n30:15 Comment: For now it goes on its own, but there is no continuation.\n30:17 Comment: So I decided to break through.\n30:18 Comment: Bate's player lies down under the ball.\n30:21 Comment: And that's where it all ends.\n30:24 Comment: Hilbert had no continuations now.\n30:26 Comment: And I understood perfectly\n30:27 Comment: Bug, what\n30:28 Comment: rival\n30:30 Comment: can't be guilty.\n30:31 Comment: In general, already limited\n30:32 Comment: in resources.\n30:35 Comment: AND\n30:35 Comment: calmly took this blow,\n30:39 Comment: which, in general,\n30:40 Comment: and without that, I must say,\n30:43 Comment: didn't seem\n30:44 Comment: lethal for the gate\n30:46 Comment: Bate football players.\n30:52 Comment: What's here? The guests lost the ball.\n30:56 Comment: Well, Belorabi failed\n30:57 Comment: immediately beat the defender.\n30:58 Comment: Bender, team captain, left\n31:0 Comment: Calhanoglu misses a beautiful ball.\n31:2 Comment: Wendl closes the zone.\n31:4 Comment: But then they met him.\n31:6 Comment: Fast attack fails.\n31:7 Comment: We have to transfer through the left flank.\n31:10 Comment: They will look in the other direction.\n31:12 Comment: Passed to Mehmedi.\n31:13 Comment: But Chicharita was waiting for the ball at his feet,\n31:15 Comment: and not in the free zone.\n31:18 Comment: These are translation difficulties.\n31:19 Comment: Bye with\n31:20 Comment: the language Mehmedi speaks\n31:24 Comment: on\n31:25 Comment: Spanish.\n31:28 Comment: Bender fails.\n31:30 Comment: At Mehmedi's, maybe\n31:30 Comment: speak both German and French,\n31:32 Comment: and perhaps Albanian, for example, the language,\n31:35 Comment: being ethnic Albanian.\n31:43 Comment: In this case, the football language is his\n31:46 Comment: Chicharita's language did not match.\n31:51 Comment: Error.\n31:51 Comment: Bayer intercepts the ball again.\n31:53 Comment: Calhanoglu.\n31:54 Comment: Belorabi.\n31:55 Comment: Calhanoglu removes it under the left, but this is no longer so dangerous.\n31:58 Comment: Belorabi.\n31:59 Comment: Wendl connects on the left.\n32:0 Comment: But Belorabi winces and gives.\n32:2 Comment: Calhanoglu.\n32:3 Comment: Hit.\n32:6 Comment: The ball remains at Bate's goal for now.\n32:8 Comment: Belorabi.\n32:10 Comment: Constant movement, of course, is his\n32:12 Comment: company logo.\n32:14 Comment: A Bayer player is lying on the lawn.\n32:16 Comment: Who is this?\n32:18 Comment: This is team captain Bender.\n32:20 Comment: It's always unpleasant.\n32:21 Comment: Very traumatic football player Las Bender.\n32:23 Comment: Injuries throughout his career\n32:25 Comment: need to say,\n32:27 Comment: In this sense,\n32:30 Comment: spoils.\n32:32 Comment: But there is a very tough collision with Baga,\n32:34 Comment: which he himself went to.\n32:35 Comment: And I'm afraid that a replacement may be required.\n32:37 Comment: Christoph Kramer can take the field.\n32:42 Comment: World champion, unlike Lars Bender.\n32:46 Comment: Although, perhaps, if Bender was healthy,\n32:48 Comment: he would be the one to go to\n32:50 Comment: World Cup in South, in Brazil, but\n32:54 Comment: eventually\n32:57 Comment: he missed the championship.\n33:0 Comment: The collision was extremely unpleasant, it’s true.\n33:4 Comment: Bender likes to play hard\n33:9 Comment: feels good about her, but\n33:12 Comment: health is not always his,\n33:14 Comment: in this sense, it helps.\n33:17 Comment: Here he played, of course, very sharply himself, but with the ball.\n33:20 Comment: After that I entered Baga.\n33:22 Comment: May be,\n33:24 Comment: firstly, it’s definitely extremely painful, but also\n33:27 Comment: may be,\n33:28 Comment: still the reason for the replacement.\n33:31 Comment: It is not yet clear whether Bender can continue the game.\n33:35 Comment: It doesn't look like it.\n33:37 Comment: He's limping very badly.\n33:40 Comment: Of course, Schmidt wouldn’t want to change his captain in the first half.\n33:43 Comment: Here he is, Christoph Kramer.\n33:46 Comment: Basically they played all the matches together.\n33:49 Comment: But, of course, this does not mean that\n33:52 Comment: he will be in the first half.\n33:54 Comment: He will be in the first half, but\n33:56 Comment: they played matches together.\n33:58 Comment: Today I decided differently.\n34:0 Comment: Kamplya was paired with Bender.\n34:6 Comment: Schmidt, well, now, apparently, we’ll have to make a replacement.\n34:9 Comment: Bender is not doing well.\n34:11 Comment: Well, his whole career, unfortunately, is like this.\n34:13 Comment: Just like my brother.\n34:14 Comment: A lot of injuries.\n34:15 Comment: There are always 2-3 injuries every season.\n34:18 Comment: at Sven Bender's.\n34:20 Comment: And so does Lars Bender.\n34:23 Comment: Very painful.\n34:29 Comment: But for now there are ten Liverkusen.\n34:31 Comment: Kramer hasn't warmed up yet.\n34:35 Comment: Shalkhan in the corner connects Hilbert.\n34:38 Comment: Canopy. A good serve, but convenient, as it turned out, for Chernik.\n34:43 Comment: It turned out to be shorter than the partners expected.\n34:46 Comment: Ten of them are Liverkusen.\n34:47 Comment: Let me remind you again.\n34:48 Comment: Batte may try to correlate the attack.\n34:50 Comment: But the pass is too inaccurate.\n34:52 Comment: Jonathan is there.\n34:55 Comment: Wendell.\n34:57 Comment: We have to give it back to the goalkeeper.\n34:59 Comment: We, in fact, did not see Berndelen after\n35:1 Comment: as the ball flew into his goal.\n35:3 Comment: This happens now.\n35:5 Comment: The first blow is Hollywood.\n35:7 Comment: And then there’s the ricochet.\n35:9 Comment: Campol.\n35:11 Comment: Hilbert.\n35:13 Comment: You see, Belorabi went deep.\n35:15 Comment: Hilbert went for three.\n35:17 Comment: Completely in vain.\n35:19 Comment: The ball was pulled.\n35:20 Comment: Belorabi.\n35:24 Comment: Lost the ball.\n35:25 Comment: Now Belorabi is also mistaken.\n35:27 Comment: True, this is Bayer’s pressure.\n35:29 Comment: You see, two people swoop in.\n35:31 Comment: Belorabi is already here.\n35:32 Comment: And in the end the ball was taken away.\n35:34 Comment: This is a classic element of pressing that the Liverkusen team uses.\n35:38 Comment: Injury.\n35:39 Comment: Now the player Batte has it.\n35:45 Comment: This is Nikolai Signevich.\n35:48 Comment: The missing person turned out to be the victim.\n35:52 Comment: Well, Bender can return to the field.\n35:55 Comment: At least that's what he's trying to do.\n35:58 Comment: Tries to run away.\n36:1 Comment: Of course, it’s difficult for Batte to fight against such pressure.\n36:8 Comment: Because in the Belarusian championship, few people are able to play like that with Batte.\n36:12 Comment: If anyone is capable at all.\n36:14 Comment: Especially at such speeds.\n36:16 Comment: Bender returned to the field.\n36:20 Comment: Has Batte returned to the field?\n36:22 Comment: Yes, I think so.\n36:23 Comment: Signevich on the field.\n36:24 Comment: Yes, here he is, number 13 in attack.\n36:26 Comment: That is, everything is fine.\n36:28 Comment: Full composition.\n36:29 Comment: But it remains to be seen whether Bender can do it.\n36:31 Comment: He is still experiencing discomfort, of course.\n36:34 Comment: Belorabi handles the ball well.\n36:36 Comment: Kampel.\n36:37 Comment: Calhanoglu.\n36:39 Comment: And you can’t pass it to the left.\n36:41 Comment: You have to play to the right.\n36:43 Comment: Belorabi.\n36:45 Comment: Mehmedi again.\n36:47 Comment: Again, Bayer is trying to come up with something on the right.\n36:49 Comment: Belorabi is mistaken.\n36:50 Comment: Too obvious a transfer.\n36:52 Comment: But Batte also does not have enough strength to organize a counterattack.\n36:56 Comment: They just kicked the ball out.\n36:58 Comment: There are 8 minutes left before the end of the first half.\n37:3 Comment: Bender.\n37:5 Comment: What a good show.\n37:7 Comment: Calhanoglu.\n37:9 Comment: Nothing can be done and it's a goal kick.\n37:11 Comment: Calhanoglu did not come up with a solution.\n37:14 Comment: And then there was nothing he could do.\n37:17 Comment: Bender.\n37:18 Comment: Calhanoglu is not visible yet.\n37:20 Comment: Well, most importantly, his standards are not there.\n37:22 Comment: Except for that corner.\n37:24 Comment: The wards probably know.\n37:26 Comment: Ermakovic explained to them that Calhanoglu was an outstanding free throw taker.\n37:32 Comment: And often his free kick is almost a penalty.\n37:36 Comment: Under no circumstances should you foul near your goal.\n37:42 Comment: So far this is not happening.\n37:44 Comment: So far, not a single chance to shoot at a stationary ball.\n37:46 Comment: Calhanoglu didn’t have it.\n37:48 Comment: But it doesn’t hit things that are moving so well.\n37:50 Comment: Wow, what a show by Kampl.\n37:52 Comment: Absolutely monstrous.\n37:54 Comment: It is generally clear what motivated him in this situation.\n37:56 Comment: The Slovenian apologizes.\n37:58 Comment: Really.\n38:0 Comment: It was a strange decision.\n38:2 Comment: Kampl is certainly no stranger to Liverkusen.\n38:4 Comment: I think he was here as a young man.\n38:6 Comment: I tried to break into Bayer.\n38:8 Comment: He didn't succeed.\n38:10 Comment: But it was very strange.\n38:12 Comment: And it was very strange.\n38:14 Comment: And it worked.\n38:16 Comment: Well, now he's back.\n38:18 Comment: As a ready player.\n38:20 Comment: Is it true.\n38:22 Comment: The move to Dortmund did not bring him glory.\n38:24 Comment: Kevin Kamp didn't play there.\n38:26 Comment: Well, it’s true that he certainly found himself in a difficult situation in Barusi.\n38:30 Comment: Well, in the preseason.\n38:32 Comment: Already with the new coach, Tuchel was unable to prove his right to a place in the squad.\n38:36 Comment: Belorabin.\n38:38 Comment: The Liverkusen team will enter from the sidelines.\n38:42 Comment: And so.\n38:44 Comment: This is how they show us Bender.\n38:50 Comment: The table is clearly still experiencing discomfort.\n38:54 Comment: The pain did not go away.\n38:58 Comment: I see.\n39:0 Comment: Because he makes a face.\n39:2 Comment: And because he picks up his legs.\n39:4 Comment: It may still need replacement.\n39:8 Comment: Wendal.\n39:10 Comment: I took over the game of Chalkhan Glu.\n39:14 Comment: Again the Turk with the ball.\n39:16 Comment: It's great how it translated into weight.\n39:18 Comment: Hilbert plays touch.\n39:20 Comment: I was hoping to find Chicharit.\n39:22 Comment: So far the Mexican cannot be brought to strike.\n39:24 Comment: We know that Chicharita is a touch player often.\n39:28 Comment: And he doesn't need a lot of the ball.\n39:34 Comment: You just need to bring him out at the right time in the right place to strike.\n39:38 Comment: So far this has not been possible.\n39:40 Comment: Hilbert. Broadcast.\n39:42 Comment: Chalhanu Glu.\n39:44 Comment: Again it's a free kick.\n39:46 Comment: But again surrounded by five.\n39:48 Comment: Kampl can also break through.\n39:50 Comment: Bender.\n39:52 Comment: Bayer teams attack.\n39:54 Comment: Kampl hits.\n39:56 Comment: Strongly but straight into the rotary.\n39:58 Comment: Kampl got some kind of village blow.\n40:0 Comment: Swung and punched.\n40:2 Comment: Directly and into the goalkeeper.\n40:4 Comment: 41 minutes.\n40:6 Comment: Bayer Batem 1-1.\n40:8 Comment: Chicharit.\n40:10 Comment: Bayer Batem 2-1.\n40:12 Comment: Chicharit.\n40:14 Comment: Baga's guests have the ball.\n40:16 Comment: Chicharit.\n40:22 Comment: You can't lose the ball in the sweat here.\n40:24 Comment: Here's the moment.\n40:26 Comment: Volodko.\n40:28 Comment: No, this is not Volodko.\n40:30 Comment: It was the striker.\n40:32 Comment: It was Aleksevich in this case as a striker.\n40:34 Comment: But I didn’t understand.\n40:36 Comment: He lacked a little quickness.\n40:38 Comment: What's here?\n40:40 Comment: Why was the game stopped?\n40:42 Comment: Papadopolos gets yellow.\n40:44 Comment: Very stable.\n40:46 Comment: Apparently for trying to disrupt that same attack.\n40:50 Comment: Which didn’t bring up the most important thing.\n40:52 Comment: Which in the end led nowhere.\n40:54 Comment: Well, the Greek is known for his harsh character.\n40:56 Comment: And sometimes the deaf doctor is not able to drink.\n41:0 Comment: The same is true for Wendella.\n41:2 Comment: In this sense, Bayer's defense is explosive.\n41:4 Comment: ẫn is different and Wendell in this sense, Bayer’s defense is explosive.\n41:6 Comment: Rivals can take advantage of this.\n41:8 Comment: rivals take advantage of this theoretically.\n41:10 Comment: Well, now it wasn't intentional, it just happened that way.\n41:14 Comment: Bender.\n41:16 Comment: In possession of the ball, of course, Bayer has a very big advantage,\n41:18 Comment: but it cannot be said that there are many moments.\n41:21 Comment: They circle around the penalty area, sometimes they even go there,\n41:25 Comment: but Patteo still defends in an organized manner,\n41:29 Comment: and again the ball goes out of bounds.\n41:32 Comment: Well, Patteo will probably be patiently waiting for his next chance,\n41:38 Comment: maybe even standard.\n41:39 Comment: Here's Baga's pass.\n41:41 Comment: This is where Signevich gets hit in the legs,\n41:44 Comment: and for this, in fact, he was awarded a yellow card by the referee.\n41:49 Comment: Well deserved, by the way.\n41:52 Comment: Well, or a counterattack like this somewhere,\n41:54 Comment: when Bayer gets carried away with their high pressing,\n41:57 Comment: will leave a free zone, and you can jump there.\n42:2 Comment: After all, at one time this is exactly how Patteo won against Bayern.\n42:6 Comment: I took advantage of the gaps between the lines and some imposingness.\n42:12 Comment: But this is where Baga is wrong; Wendell intercepted the ball.\n42:16 Comment: You must not make mistakes yourself, this is important.\n42:19 Comment: There will be no goal kick, the goalkeeper will simply take the ball.\n42:23 Comment: The main thing, Patteo, is not to lose the ball at that moment,\n42:26 Comment: when the team is on the attack.\n42:29 Comment: Don't lose quickly because you'll come back\n42:32 Comment: You may not have time.\n42:33 Comment: Yes, Kramer will still take the field.\n42:36 Comment: Bender is not feeling well\n42:37 Comment: and it might even be better to take care of it here.\n42:40 Comment: Another Bayer player on the pitch.\n42:43 Comment: This time it's Wendell.\n42:47 Comment: Something also happened to him.\n42:51 Comment: So, Christoph Kramer in the 43rd minute\n42:53 Comment: still appears on the field instead of captain Bender.\n42:56 Comment: He apparently gave the captain's armband to someone now.\n42:58 Comment: There is no Kisling.\n43:0 Comment: By and large, there are no more experienced players left.\n43:2 Comment: In Bayer.\n43:3 Comment: Probably Roberto Gilbert could, but no.\n43:5 Comment: Bender gave the bandage to someone else.\n43:8 Comment: Indeed, we see that he is walking hard.\n43:10 Comment: Everything hit him properly on the leg.\n43:12 Comment: I don't think the injury is very serious.\n43:18 Comment: But Bender may miss the match with Borussia.\n43:24 Comment: Do you see?\n43:26 Comment: First replacement.\n43:27 Comment: Christoph Kramer.\n43:28 Comment: You see, both teams were forced to\n43:30 Comment: make a replacement.\n43:31 Comment: By replacement.\n43:32 Comment: Batko came on instead of Gleb.\n43:34 Comment: And Kramer instead of Bender.\n43:40 Comment: Well, essentially, little will change in Bayer's game.\n43:41 Comment: Kramer is a player of approximately the same type.\n43:47 Comment: A very agile and powerful midfield player.\n43:52 Comment: Able to launch an attack.\n43:54 Comment: Pull the ball if necessary.\n43:57 Comment: And score a beautiful goal into your own goal.\n44:2 Comment: Well, just a little bit remains.\n44:5 Comment:

because he was worse there\n7:37 Comment: But simply because somewhere discipline failed\n7:39 Comment: Somewhere there is arbitrariness\n7:40 Comment: Somewhere I didn’t understand what to do\n7:42 Comment: What to do with your talent like this\n7:46 Comment: And Roger Schmidt, who simply believed in him\n7:49 Comment: And I realized that with the appropriate work\n7:52 Comment: Upon instructions\n7:54 Comment: With the help of a trainer from Belorabi\n7:56 Comment: Can come out and grow up to be more than just a strong player\n7:58 Comment: And the player is potentially top level\n8:1 Comment: And in one year Belorabi reached the German national team\n8:4 Comment: Moreover, he is now, if not a player in the main team\n8:7 Comment: That's the closest\n8:9 Comment: Nearest

silent\n8:26 Comment: When Bayer carries out this high pressing\n8:29 Comment: He attacks the opponent with a large number of players\n8:33 Comment: And if you manage to overcome it\n8:35 Comment: Then there is a gap\n8:38 Comment: Between attack and defense at Bayer\n8:40 Comment: And here you can use these formed zones\n8:44 Comment: There were two free players on the left, but I didn’t see them\n8:47 Comment: The football player with the ball played to the right\n8:49 Comment: And then the attack fizzled out\n8:52 Comment: Let...\n8:54 Comment: Perhaps there was a fall\n8:56 Comment: Wendl throws for the sideline\n9:0 Comment: Here he is with the ball\n9:4 Comment: Bayer traditionally has very good selection in Brazil\n9:8 Comment: Throughout history, many players have been strong from there\n9:11 Comment: Here is Wendl's latest acquisition\n9:13 Comment: Really interesting very left back\n9:16 Comment: This is the pressure\n9:19 Comment: And Kampal works\n9:22 Comment:

Comment: The same players scored in Latso\n10:32 Comment: Mehmedi and Calhanuglu\n10:34 Comment: Just in a different order\n10:38 Comment: Calhanuglu at the end of the first half\n10:40 Comment: And Mehmedi at the beginning of the second\n10:46 Comment: Belorabi scored the third at the very end\n10:49 Comment: Which solved all the questions\n10:52 Comment: This goal\n10:54 Comment: Breaks the rules\n10:56 Comment: Perhaps here\n10:58 Comment: Polyakov\n11:0 Comment: He said that Bayer team is very young\n11:2 Comment: You probably can’t say the same about Bate in general.\n11:4 Comment: Mostly footballers here\n11:6 Comment: Well, let's say the ideal football age\n11:8 Comment: Chernik is 27 years old\n11:10 Comment: Dubriy 24\n11:12 Comment: Milunovich 26\n11:14 Comment: Malodenovic

Strongly.\n16:32 Comment: But Mehmedi will run.\n16:34 Comment: Mehmedi, I must say, Liverkusen\n16:36 Comment: quite the style player. In contrast\n16:38 Comment: from Josip Dirmić, who was on the team\n16:40 Comment: last year.

Played with Kampl.\n19:6 Comment: And the one on Chicharita\n19:8 Comment: passed the ball.\n19:10 Comment: I think that in some matches\n19:12 Comment: we will see Kisling and Chicharita\n19:14 Comment: even together. Not often though.\n19:16 Comment: But, I guess, still.\n19:18 Comment: Oh, how Javer Hernandez plays.\n19:20 Comment: Penalty. Here's your chance\n19:22 Comment: for Chalhanu.\n19:24 Comment: The Mexican immediately began to demonstrate\n19:26 Comment: your qualities.

Belorabi, his next pass\n34:56 Comment: And the pass, which was intended to be good to Brant, but weak\n35:0 Comment: This is Belorabi’s signature pass, these are the movements\n35:5 Comment: It’s a bit like Andreas Müller fled at one time\n35:10 Comment: Famous German midfielder\n35:13 Comment: His main...\n35:15 Comment: The main feature, one might say, was a very sharp change in direction of movement while maintaining speed\n35:21 Comment: The defenders simply couldn't keep up\n35:22 Comment: So Belorabi also lays it so sharply to the sides\n35:28 Comment: Not a collar to the sides\n35:31

high.\n37:57 Comment: Another quite beautiful combination was played by the hosts.\n38:3 Comment: But it did not end with an accurate blow.\n38:6 Comment: Sergey Chernik.\n38:8 Comment: Why do I call him Alexander?\n38:10 Comment: Somehow I feel like it.\n38:12 Comment: Sergey Chernik.\n38:13 Comment: Which, by the way, helped out his team a couple of times today.\n38:16 Comment: Especially remember when Javier Hernandez hit from the goalkeeper.\n38:21 Comment: The goalkeeper finished and managed to move and deflect the ball.\n38:26 Comment: Well, we must assume that in such a group of work, Sergei Chernikov will, of course, have a lot of work to do in the Champions League.\n38:32 Comment: In the next round they will host Roma at their stadium in Borisov.\n38:37 Comment: They are already in Minsk.\n38:39 Comment: A wonderful stadium was built in this small town.\n38:43 Comment: And that's where the match will take place.\n38:49 Comment: Well, in the third or fourth there will be Barcelona.\n38:54 Comment: Which, however, is not as scary as last year.\n38:57 Comment: At least he doesn’t destroy anyone in the Spanish Championship.\n39:3 Comment: Strictly one ball.\n39:6 Comment: Mostly he plays.\n39:8 Comment: So maybe Batep will be lucky too.\n39:11 Comment: It doesn't hurt too much.\n39:13 Comment: Well, who knows, maybe we’ll be able to create a sensation somewhere.\n39:17 Comment: Or with Roma, or with Barcelona.\n39:20 Comment: Or at home with Bayer already in the fifth round.\n39:25 Comment: Any score in this group will, of course, be a wonderful achievement for Batep.\n39:30 Comment: But no luck.\n39:31 Comment: We could have gotten in with a simpler team.\n39:34 Comment: Especially from the third basket.\n39:36 Comment: Roma dropped out of the third.\n39:38 Comment: There were rivals there who were more accessible.\n39:43 Comment: Kisling.\n39:46 Comment: Pass to Brant.\n39:47 Comment: He has very good speed.\n39:48 Comment: He tries to immediately throw the ball past the defender.\n39:52 Comment: But Milunovich doesn’t give in.\n39:54 Comment: But Kisling now picks up the blow.\n39:58 Comment: Cute.\n40:1 Comment: Only once today did Liverkusen win the ball.\n40:5 Comment: Immediately, almost after the attack fizzled out.\n40:11 Comment: This, of course, is what football players are all about...\n40:13 Comment: They are ready.\n40:14 Comment: They are not pressed like that in the Belarusian championship.\n40:19 Comment: They are not ready for the fact that the opponent, having lost the ball,\n40:21 Comment: will simply instantly try to return it.\n40:23 Comment: And he will do it the way Baev knows how to do it.\n40:28 Comment: With understanding, with working out the script.\n40:32 Comment: Everything is as it should be.\n40:38 Comment: Maxim Volodko competed for the ball.\n40:43 Comment: And from his foot the ball goes out of bounds.\n40:49 Comment: Wendl.\n40:55 Comment: Four minutes left.\n40:56 Comment: I don't think the judge will add much.\n40:58 Comment: Still, the score is 4-1.\n40:59 Comment: And there isn't much intrigue left.\n41:13 Comment: Set up game.\n41:23 Comment: Yellow card for unruly behavior\n41:28 Comment: Signevich, the forward, receives it.\n41:38 Comment: And there is very little left until the end of the match.\n41:42 Comment: Nikolai Signevich.\n41:43 Comment: Signevich.\n41:51 Comment: Kramer.\n41:52 Comment: By the way, he came out great as a replacement.\n41:55 Comment: Do you know how Julian Bran plays?\n41:57 Comment: Brilliant pass to Kisling.\n41:59 Comment: The Battes central defenders still play very calmly.\n42:3 Comment: They know their stuff.\n42:5 Comment: But simply not everything depends on them.\n42:7 Comment: Often.\n42:13 Comment: The ball will reach Signevich here.\n42:18 Comment: Pass.\n42:19 Comment: Will there be a blow?\n42:20 Comment: No, to the right.\n42:22 Comment: Submission from Stasevich.\n42:24 Comment: Hilbert waved the ball wide.\n42:29 Comment: Back.\n42:46 Comment: Kramer's tackle misses.\n42:48 Comment: The attack continues.\n42:49 Comment: Pass.\n42:51 Comment: Alexander Kornitsky still fails to get into the striking position.\n42:56 Comment: Collided with a defender.\n42:58 Comment: Brant plays left.\n43:0 Comment: Mehmedi.\n43:3 Comment: It is clear that the Liverkusen players are no longer running anywhere.\n43:7 Comment: We need to save our strength.\n43:9 Comment: The Champions League has just begun.\n43:11 Comment: And the match with Dortmund Barusi.\n43:12 Comment: Metalhead.\n43:13 Comment: And this is what they have to do.\n43:14 Comment: If we lose, Bayer will fall very far away.\n43:17 Comment: Six points after four matches for the Liverkusen team and twelve for Barusi.\n43:23 Comment: Bayern have the same number.\n43:24 Comment: Accordingly, it is enough to lose and, in general, there Padi will already catch up with this locomotive that has gone

    "summary": "Bayer Leverkusen delivered a dazzling performance against BATE Borisov in a match filled with dynamic plays, strategic maneuvers, and clinical finishing, resulting in a compelling 4-1 victory. The encounter, held at the BayArena, witnessed Bayer asserting their dominance early in both halves, rendering BATE’s efforts insufficient to alter the course decisively.\n\nFrom the first whistle, it was evident that Bayer Leverkusen had come with a clear intent to play attacking football. The early minutes involved methodical build-up play underscored by high pressing. Keeping in view Bayer's recent lack of goals in the Bundesliga, Coach Roger Schmidt's tactical emphasis on offense was palpable. In these opening stages, Bayer’s players moved with fluidity across the pitch, dominating possession and searching for early breakthroughs.\n\nThe starting whistle initiated a cascade of structured movements, with Hilbert quickly getting onto the ball. The defense, orchestrated by Papadopoulos and Jonathan Tah, smoothly transitioned into offensive efforts with Wendell advancing down the left flank. His synergy with Bellarabi, although initially out of sync, eventually became a focal point for most of Bayer’s attacks.\n\nAs the game progressed through the initial minutes, players such as Kampl and Mehmedi settled into their roles, adapting to high-paced exchanges and relentless pressing. Mehmedi’s exquisite understanding with Chicharito began showing as well, with keen passing sequences slicing through BATE’s defense. By the 4th minute, the burgeoning chemistry paid dividends as Admir Mehmedi latched onto a rebound and dispatched a deft strike past Chernik into the net, putting Bayer ahead 1-0 and setting the tone for the match.\n\nBATE Borisov, determined to respond, showed grit. Barely a minute after conceding, they launched a foray into Bayer’s half, with attempts to lever quick attacks led by Gordeichuk and Alekseevich. Their persistence bore fruit in the 13th minute when a misjudged clearance off Papadopoulos allowed the ball to find Milunovic, who capitalized on the situation to level the score 1-1. This came as a stark reminder of the defensive lapses Bayer is sometimes prone to despite their offensive might.\n\nHowever, Bayer Leverkusen's response was immediate and resolute. They reclaimed control, with players like Hakan Calhanoglu playing pivotal roles through incisive passes and clever movements. Calhanoglu, a key playmaker, maintained the tempo, ensuring the forwards received timely deliveries to exploit BATE’s defensive gaps. Meanwhile, Bellarabi's speed and agility continuously troubled the Belarusian defense, leading Bayer's frequent offensives predominantly down the right flank.\n\nThe second half began in much the same way as the first, with Bayer reaffirming their dominance. Within the opening moments, the team intensified their assault, with Calhanoglu finding the net courtesy of a decisive strike that deflected off Polyakov, wrong-footing Chernik and making the score 2-1. This goal epitomized Bayer's attacking persistence and BATE’s mounting defensive struggles.\n\nWith Bayer firmly in the driving seat, BATE Borisov’s attempts to regain footing seemed sporadic. Their midfield struggled to orchestrate play under relentless pressure from Bayer's aggressive pressing tactics. Christoph Kramer, who came on as a substitute for the injured Bender, quickly integrated himself into the central midfield, contributing significantly in both defensive duties and transitioning play forward. Kramer’s introduction was seamless, as his work rate and vision helped Bayer maintain their grip on the game.\n\nBy the 58th minute, Bayer’s efforts bore additional fruit. An expertly orchestrated press by Kramer regained possession, allowing Kampl to deliver a precise pass into the penalty area which Chicharito Hernandez latched onto, finishing clinically to extend the lead to 3-1. This goal signified not just Hernandez’s first goal in Bayer colors but also a testament to the pressing strategy that systematically dismantled BATE’s defenses.\n\nAs the game entered its final stages, Bayer’s control only grew. Even as BATE attempted to breach Bayer's formidable press and tight defensive lines, they found opportunities to counterattack and transition into Bayer’s half increasingly difficult. On rare occasions when BATE did manage to cross into Bayer’s defensive third, their efforts were either thwarted by solid defensive interventions or floundered due to insufficient support in the final third.\n\nIn the 73rd minute, Bayer effectively sealed their hosts with a fourth and final goal. A penalty was awarded following a handball incident involving Mladenovic. Calhanoglu stepped up to the spot and perfectly placed the ball into the net to make it 4-1, marking his personal brace for the evening. This goal underscored Bayer’s set-piece prowess and further demoralized an already weary BATE side.\n\nDespite BATE’s attempts at resilience, the match's conclusion was a testament to Leverkusen’s superior strategy, fitness, and execution. Bayer maintained their aggressive press, controlling possession and tempo, efficiently running the clock down while occasionally spurring potential fifth goals, which the Belarusian defense just managed to keep out.\n\nPlayers like Bellarabi, Calhanoglu, and Kampl were unrelenting in their efforts until the final whistle, embodying Bayer's high-tempo, high-press ethos instilled by Schmidt. Despite a few injuries and enforced substitutions, which included the exit of team captain Bender and the crucial inclusion of Kramer, Leverkusen’s depth ensured there was no drop in quality.\n\nBATE, facing logistical and tactical constraints, managed some promising moments but consistently fell short against Bayer’s pressing game and swift transitions. The match ended with Leverkusen comfortably ahead at 4-1, showcasing their capacity to dominate sides and finish clinically when presented with clear opportunities.\n\nOverall, Bayer Leverkusen's comprehensive 4-1 victory against BATE Borisov Articulated their attacking prowess and cohesive team play. Every goal symbolized not just individual brilliance but a concerted team effort. Whether through initiating high pressing, making strategic passes, or converting set-pieces, Bayer demonstrated a well-rounded display worthy of Champions League contention."
