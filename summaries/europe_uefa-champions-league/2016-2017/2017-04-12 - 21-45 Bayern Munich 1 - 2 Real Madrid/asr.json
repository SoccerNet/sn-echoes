on the left.\n10:38 Comment: He has the support of Frank Ribery.\n10:41 Comment: Ribery plays for Alaba and this one for Arturo Vidal.\n10:45 Comment: They are looking for a way to connect with

interpreting the game well.\n11:23 Comment: In the first five minutes there were three corners.\n11:26 Comment: Bayern gave the impression of wanting to put football pressure on Real Madrid.\n11:33 Comment: To become master of the game.\n11:34 Comment: Real Madrid has already stopped that intention.\n11:39 Comment: And now he has long possessions.\n11:40 Comment: They handle the ball with a lot of authority.\n11:45 Comment: Pressure on Gareth Bale.\n11:47 Comment: The advantage goes to Boateng.\n11:49 Comment: That's back for Manuel Noya.\n11:52 Comment: At the moment, neither Noya nor Keylor Navas have had to intervene.\n11:56 Comment: At the moment the attackers of both teams did not demand them.\n11:59 Comment: We continue waiting for opportunities and goals in this Bayern de Böling-Real Madrid game.\n12:5 Comment: Up Javi Martínez.\n12:6 Comment: Run Arjen Robben.\n12:7 Comment: Flag up.\n12:8 Comment: there .\n12:11 Comment: Be careful with that play.\n12:13 Comment: Robben gives the impression that he is coming to receive short.\n12:16 Comment: But it's a fake.\n12:17 Comment: Then he accelerates and since he is a bullet, Marcelo has to be very careful.\n12:23 Comment: Classic move by Robben, whom Raúl knows very well.\n12:26 Comment: A lot, you have to be very careful.\n12:28 Comment: He's very fast, but luckily this time it was offside.\n12:34 Comment: Just a little bit, but yes.\n12:35 Comment: The assistant was right when he raised the flag.\n12:37 Comment: He was ahead of Marcelo.\n12:39 Comment: Carvajal has been hurt.\n12:40 Comment: What's wrong with Carvajal, Rodrigo?\n12:42 Comment: It's there that he has discomfort.\n12:43 Comment: He is complaining about a blow he received in that Real Madrid attack.\n12:47 Comment: The assistance has to come out because he is complaining in the belly area.\n12:51 Comment: Or lower abdomen.\n12:53 Comment: I think he got a little pregnant.\n12:55 Comment: Now as soon as he catches his breath he'll be at his best.\n13:0 Comment: There we have the repeated action.\n13:2 Comment: It's the clash with Arturo Vidal.\n13:4 Comment: Vidal is tough, huh.\n13:6 Comment:  Yeah.\n13:7 Comment: It was accidental, clearly accidental.\n13:9 Comment: Still sitting on the field of play, but it seems that Dani Carvajal is already recovering.\n13:16 Comment: Which by the way has impeccable individual statistics in this scenario.\n13:19 Comment: I think there will be few players who can say or boast that they win every time they come here.\n13:24 Comment: He did it with Bayern Leverkusen and obviously he did it with Real Madrid a few seasons ago, in 2014.\n13:30 Comment: Well, let the streak continue.\n13:33 Comment: Carvajal leaves momentarily, but he comes back right away, right, Rodrigo?\n13:36 Comment: Yes, yes, he is already asking for re-entry and now he is re-entering the field of play without any problems.\n13:43 Comment: It's Bayern's turn to propose. It's Arturo Vidal.\n13:49 Comment: I see Arturo Vidal as much more content than he was with Pep last season.\n13:54 Comment: Practically in the same line as Xavi Alonso.\n13:56 Comment: Robben advances on the right. Robben outlines himself, puts it in front. This is Thiago.\n14:0 Comment: Thiago tries to combine, Ribery appears.\n14:4 Comment: Finally Marcelo keeps it, although Casimiro's poor control almost compromised Real Madrid.\n14:9 Comment: That now he does come out on the counterattack with Modric.\n14:12 Comment: Ronaldo confronting, threatening Philipp Lahm.\n14:15 Comment: Ronaldo continues, ball to the front. Benzema already with the moment. Before Boate, there is a foul.\n14:20 Comment: There is a very dangerous foul for Real Madrid.\n14:22 Comment: Great counterattack with Modric, with Cristiano and the foul seems very clear to me. We haven't seen the replay.\n14:32 Comment: Before, Benzema touched the ball and made a very dangerous foul and we hope that Real Madrid can take advantage.\n14:41 Comment: Modric is very good, Kroos is very good. Because they receive, play and accompany, which is fundamental.\n14:49 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo went to look for the ball, very far away, who placed it with care, who placed it the way he liked.\n14:56 Comment: It seems that there will be no discussion regarding the authorship of the launch at the moment.\n15:2 Comment: It's close, it's normal for the goalkeeper's stick to hit it very hard.\n15:7 Comment: Five steps, Cristiano Ronaldo leans slightly, he's going to score a goal.\n15:12 Comment: His third goal in this edition of the Champions League.\n15:15 Comment: Threatening the ball for Real Madrid, who wants the first in this CR7 shot.\n15:24 Comment: There is a very crowded barrier, Manuel Noya, up to five Bayern players trying to focus the shot.\n15:30 Comment: Ronaldo hits him high, Cristiano Ronaldo's shot goes high.\n15:34 Comment: It's very difficult to get that ball down being so close and hitting it so hard.\n15:40 Comment: But well, the first dangerous situation that Real Madrid creates.\n15:43 Comment: The first situation for any of the two teams in which we have played.\n15:51 Comment: Boateng, the short for Arturo Vidal.\n15:54 Comment: The first goal of the Champions League.\n15:56 Comment: Boateng, the short for Arturo Vidal.\n15:59 Comment: Boateng again, now Real Madrid is pressing very, very high and very intensely.\n16:3 Comment:  And this is the result.\n16:4 Comment: Well, let's see an issue in this pressure and recover the ball quickly.\n16:8 Comment: Benzema receives inside the area, tries to turn around.\n16:10 Comment: She has the support of Bale, they put her up front for Toni Kroos.\n16:13 Comment: Kroos' shot goes up.\n16:15 Comment: Xavi Alonso has played.\n16:17 Comment: It will be a corner kick for Real Madrid.\n16:19 Comment: Real Madrid has taken away those five goals, but the Champions League,\n16:22 Comment: Real Madrid is the one that is creating the chances,\n16:25 Comment: The one who is playing the most in Bayern's field.\n16:28 Comment: And well, let's see the corner he always takes.\n16:35 Comment: Kroos is preparing to put it inside the area.\n16:37 Comment: Ramos wants it, Bale wants it, he puts it at the near post.\n16:39 Comment: He manages to clear Philipp Lahm.\n16:41 Comment: Try to reformulate Real Madrid's attacking action with Marcelo.\n16:44 Comment: The return of Kroos.\n16:52 Comment: Inf\n17:19 Comment: A great goalkeeper but on this occasion he was very lucky the ball hit the post and he missed\n17:24 Comment: If he appears in front of him, he could have hit him in the body and that would end in a goal against the law.\n17:31 Comment: The probability was that it seemed like it could be more normal but the truth is that the\n17:40 Comment: Real Madrid has now taken control of the game and is managing it very, very well. Well, it's a shame,\n17:46 Comment: A shame, a great header and a good one between the post Noyet saved a great chance for Real\n17:52 Comment: Madrid and well, I think that Real Madrid right now feels a little more comfortable.\n17:58 Comment: Trying long passes as we have seen now and well, let's hope the game continues like this.\n18:4 Comment: Raúl, we are seeing it again, Benzema's shot with Alaba so so so in the touch.\n18:10 Comment: Noyet was Noyet too.\n18:13 Comment: A little bit of luck but it was Noyet.\n18:18 Comment: Noyet appeared to slightly deflect that shot in a position that was not comfortable for Benzema\n18:23 Comment: After a wonderful serve from Kroos. Kroos' balls are wonderful.\n18:33 Comment: The ball is still for Real Madrid, Nacho tells me Rodri will put it into play.\n18:36 Comment: Zidane is happy with his men, he really likes the game they are playing\n18:40 Comment: team in fact every little bit apart from giving the pertinent encouragement to all its men who\n18:45 Comment: They are close to the technical area, he just gave the ok signal as he likes everything\n18:49 Comment: They are doing their own thing. Yes, it doesn't surprise me because not only has Real Madrid been doing it\n18:55 Comment: Master of the game little by little but Bayern entered into moments of confusion all the time\n19:2 Comment: Players raise their arms, it's like they don't really know how to respond to this script.\n19:8 Comment: A game that they probably didn't expect, at least they didn't expect it so soon, not where Real\n19:12 Comment: Madrid seems to be in charge. Ribery, Vidal, Javi Martínez. The Estella footballer advances between the lines\n19:23 Comment: Thomas Viola claims. The ball again for Arturo Vidal turns the attack to the left or at least\n19:28 Comment: That's what the player from Santiago intended. Thiago Alcántara insists for Bayern.\n19:38 Comment: Alonso. Error in that movement of the Basque footballer. Marcelo up, Benzema runs. Move forward\n19:46 Comment: The Real Madrid attacker who stops to look for a partner to wait for someone is alone\n19:49 Comment: Companion. Although Javi Martínez ends up snatching the ball from him. Player on the ground, there is no foul, says Rizoli.\n19:55 Comment: Or yes, finally yes, it seems that it indicates it. It is a foul by Karim Benzema on Javi Martínez.\n20:2 Comment: Bayern is already overturning. But Benzema is looking for the sides trying to vent the game\n20:10 Comment: so that the midfielders always find something. Be careful. Unload on the right Miola.\n20:15 Comment: It's Robben facing the area. Robben continues, Robben wants to put it in. Sergio Ramos appears on the cut.\n20:20 Comment: Throw-in. Ramos seems to have hurt his knee.\n20:23 Comment: Yes, he's testing there to see if he can. But come on, just in case Zinedine Zidane is pulling\n20:30 Comment: without stopping Real Madrid's number 4. But come on, it's tough. The captain of Real Madrid is very tough.\n20:38 Comment: Ready to execute from the corner, Xabi Alonso.\n20:42 Comment: He looks for it in Miola, Vidal, Javi Martínez and company.\n20:50 Comment: There goes Alonso's shot, now it gives the penalty point. Tomás Miola fails to finish.\n20:54 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo wants to keep it away. It's Klosac's turn on the left for Marcelo.\n20:58 Comment: Ball goes up from Marcelo. The rebound falls to Thiago. Thiago leaves it for Javi Martínez.\n21:3 Comment: Javi Martínez wants to give it back. The Spanish footballer from Bayern is vague.\n21:7 Comment: Marcelo is on the ground. He claims a foul. The referee says no. Bayern continues attacking with this throw-in.\n21:14 Comment: Very good Carvajal. He didn't leave him the slightest option to control that ball.\n21:21 Comment: A very, very important cross. Philipp Lahm, baseline, puts it behind. Miola wants it.\n21:27 Comment: Attention Casemiro. Ball above Marcelo that Ronaldo almost didn't control.\n21:32 Comment: That could be the start of a very promising counter.\n21:34 Comment: And Zidane got angry, sorry Raúl, but Zidane got angry with that failure in the control of Cristiano Ronaldo.\n21:41 Comment: Robben. He goes to the right. The center is from Lahm. Marcelo touched.\n21:48 Comment: The one who guides to the right is Casemiro. Benzema delivers for Gareth Bale.\n21:54 Comment: This is what I mean, that every time a midfielder raises his head, he finds Zidane making an unmarking movement.\n22:1 Comment: And that relieves the game a lot.\n22:4 Comment: Riveria in the center for Xavi Alonso.\n22:6 Comment: Thiago. Robben. He wants to get between two. Leave it to Lahm. Lahm facing Marcelo.\n22:14 Comment: Thiago on the front. Robben again.\n22:18 Comment: He wants to put it inside the area. He prefers to finally partner with Alaba. Alaba hits him from afar.\n22:24 Comment: Ball not so deviated from Keylor Dabasco's frame.\n22:28 Comment: The attitude of the Real Madrid goalkeeper could make you think, as he saw it very clearly and let the ball go out without even approaching it.\n22:34 Comment: Alaba is a player who hits the ball very well and has gone wide.\n22:40 Comment: But well, it seemed like it had come a little closer.\n22:44 Comment: But those shots are dangerous and you shouldn't let him have that much distance.\n22:50 Comment: It was a bit of a rushed shot, a bit of a forced shot.\n22:53 Comment: It wasn't so easy for that ball to find the goal.\n22:57 Comment: There's Alaba again. Leave the Austrian behind for Arturo Vidal.\n23:8 Comment: Xavi Martínez. Arjen Robben again.\n23:19 Comment: Xavi Alonso, Xavi Martínez, Arturo Vidal, Boateng, playing and playing, chaining passes for Ancelotti's team.\n23:27 Comment: But at the moment without finding a way out of Real Madrid's defensive system.\n23:39 Comment: Vidal. Receives the right Alam.\n23:45 Comment: Alaba claims it on the left. At the moment they have not seen him.\n23:49 Comment: Miula appears, Miula in the front, Miula feinting with a chance to shoot.\n23:55 Comment: Robben facing. Vidal is on the front, he puts it on. Robben has touched Marcelo.\n24:0 Comment: Another corner for Bayern Munich.\n24:3 Comment: Ramos is very good there helping Marcelo because every time Robben touches her, at least he gives the sensation of threat.\n24:11 Comment: First corner taken short by Bayern Munich. Xavi Alonso returns it to the right.\n24:17 Comment: Now the ball goes directly to Santiago's area. It's Ribery's shot against Gareth Bale's body.\n24:22 Comment: And Fran Ribery's hit is full of bad intentions and he hooked her perfectly at first.\n24:28 Comment: Gareth Bale kicked it out, corner kick.\n24:31 Comment: Ribery's volley was impressive and very ugly. The truth is that I think...\n24:37 Comment: It didn't reach its destination but the feeling was that it was Bayern's most dangerous play up to this point.\n24:43 Comment: Another sender from the corner, the shot. Goal.\n24:51 Comment: From Bayern Munich in the 24th. Goal by Arturo Vidal.\n24:55 Comment: A new corner from Ancelotti's team taken from the corner towards the pedant spot.\n25:1 Comment: For the man who was being targeted by practically every subway to appear.\n25:6 Comment: Arturo Vidal entering the race, beating his marker.\n25:9 Comment: He hits the shot, touches but doesn't deflect. Keylor Navas.\n25:13 Comment: The ball goes in, it's Bayern's goal. Bayern Munich 1, Real Madrid 0.\n25:20 Comment: Yes, he enters very, very alone. The header is tremendous, it is unstoppable.\n25:27 Comment: A very very well taken corner by Xavi Alonso.\n25:31 Comment: He finds Arturo Vidal's head. He goes to the center of the goal but of course, he goes so hard that he is unstoppable.\n25:40 Comment: It is impossible for Keylor to be able to respond.\n25:44 Comment: With that power it was difficult and a shame because a great corner and Vidal has gained position from Nacho.\n25:52 Comment: I think Real Madrid has to continue with the same idea that they were showing in these minutes.\n25:57 Comment: And surely there will also be opportunities for Real Madrid and they will find their goal.\n26:4 Comment: In the fifth corner came that goal from Bayern Munich that obviously left the home team's bench delighted.\n26:13 Comment: Ronaldo maneuvering inside the area. Arturo Vidal appears, puts pressure on Toni Kroos.\n26:18 Comment: Bayern solves the situation with that great ball that Tomás Viola fights for.\n26:22 Comment: Although it was an advantage for Keylor Navas, Rodri said.\n26:25 Comment: Zidane asked for peace of mind precisely at the moment he saw that ball enter the Real Madrid net.\n26:30 Comment: Reassure your people that they take a step forward and continue with the established script they had 5-10 minutes ago.\n26:35 Comment: Because it was the team that Zidane really wants to see on the pitch at the Allianz Arena.\n26:40 Comment: The management of these types of moments, those immediately after the goal, are surely from below, dressed as Raúl,\n26:46 Comment:  the hardest.\n26:48 Comment: Yes, they are complicated because they were probably feeling that they were dominating, that they were feeling comfortable in the game.\n26:58 Comment: But well, a set piece play, there were already 5 corners, well this goal came.\n27:2 Comment: But I think Real Madrid is going to have an immediate response and we have already seen it now with an action with Cristiano.\n27:9 Comment: And now that Real Madrid continues attacking.\n27:12 Comment: There is a lot of maturity in Real Madrid and that helps us face these types of moments.\n27:19 Comment: It's a shame that it came precisely from a corner because there Real Madrid has a very great authority in the aerial game.\n27:25 Comment: I think it's much better than Bayern.\n27:28 Comment: The feeling is that Nacho slipped or stumbled, the truth is that he lost him on the way.\n27:33 Comment: Yes, he missed the mark and there was Arturo Vidal, who is a great finisher and finished very well.\n27:43 Comment: Gareth Bale, ear for Carvajal.\n27:49 Comment: All the Bayern players except Tomás Viola, defending this attacking action by Real Madrid.\n27:55 Comment: Alonso inside the area, Noia puts his fists in, good control by Carvajal.\n27:59 Comment: Zidane's team insists, center with the outside looking for Benzema, Boateng clears.\n28:4 Comment: On the front, Ribery, Thiago Alcántara and the lack of Modric are associated.\n28:8 Comment: About Fran Ribery, oxygen for Bayern Munich.\n28:21 Comment: Detail of the stands that the production offers us, the atmosphere is spectacular.\n28:24 Comment: Before, with the more open plan, we saw Interhain in the technical area with Ancelotti and Zidane as protagonists.\n28:32 Comment: In the match that we have remembered so many times from 2014, both were on the same Real Madrid bench in that duel that ended 0-4.\n28:41 Comment: Today they face each other for the first time, both being first coaches.\n28:44 Comment: Real Madrid came out of the blow well, they are pressing high, they remain organized and without showing signs of desperation, because things are not that bad.\n28:54 Comment: Just 1 to 0 and this game is very long.\n29:0 Comment: In fact, it ends at the Bernabéu.\n29:4 Comment: Arturo Vidal delivers for Jerome Boateng.\n29:7 Comment: Ribery lowered it with his chest, he wanted to project Miola into attack, who asked the rest of his teammates to accompany him in the pressure.\n29:17 Comment: Sergio Ramos, plays for Toni Kroos, Casemiro.\n29:19 Comment: Modric falls short, passes and Modric manages to recover Arturo Vidal for Bayern.\n29:28 Comment: There's Vidal again and Modric appears to catch the ball, Ronaldo.\n29:35 Comment: Benzema moves towards the ball, Benzema appears in the Theoretical Left Winger zone.\n29:41 Comment: Benzema continues, Benzema puts it in, the ball was very good but it was almost impossible for it to reach its destination.\n29:46 Comment: Jerome Boateng was very attentive.\n29:49 Comment: It was better for Bale, who came in second line asking for it.\n29:52 Comment: But very good Benzema, another move, he is very mobile, very eager and I am sure that at some point he will find the prize.\n30:1 Comment: Marcelo's center, no one dressed in black enters there, Carvajal is chasing her.\n30:6 Comment: The advantage goes to Frank Ribery, who protects the ball to get the goal kick.\n30:11 Comment: We are already in the last quarter of an hour of the first half, Bayern winning from the 25th with the goal we repeated from Arturo Vidal.\n30:22 Comment: The forcefulness of the Chilean soccer player's shot when he arrives in the race is tremendous, and he hooks it wonderfully with his forehead.\n30:29 Comment: He hit the ball with a hammer with his head.\n30:33 Comment: Very difficult, if not almost impossible, for Keylor Navas due to the power of that header.\n30:41 Comment: Toni Kroos, after the clearance, the recovery practically from Marcelo's heel.\n30:48 Comment: Casemiro is on the ground, Steago Alcántara rises, be careful because Casemiro seems to be hurt in that incident.\n30:53 Comment: Bayern continues playing, at the moment the actions do not stop, now they do.\n30:58 Comment: Frank Ribery stops and throws out Steago with the consequent annoyance of the fans, Rodrigo.\n31:2 Comment: Yes, whistles right now for the Real Madrid player. Ask Marcelo who is approaching with the quick intervention of the Real Madrid doctors.\n31:10 Comment: It seems that Casemiro is having trouble breathing.\n31:12 Comment: Yes, yes, yes, it must have been the blow directly to Steago Alcántara's arm because he had difficulty taking a breath.\n31:22 Comment: It is not clear whether it was the blow or the fall.\n31:25 Comment: In the fall, yes.\n31:26 Comment:  Possibly.\n31:31 Comment: I wanted to highlight Arturo Vidal in these minutes, he is being the protagonist of the game with the goal, stealing, appearing from all sides.\n31:43 Comment: As we have talked about before in the preview, a total midfielder who knows how to do everything and usually does it well.\n31:49 Comment: Yes, he is playing a very high role. The only thing he was missing was the goal to become the man of the match, at least in this first half.\n31:58 Comment: I was now explaining to Casemiro to the referee that while he was falling he hit himself, like his fist in the chest.\n32:5 Comment: What happens is not very clear after the repetition.\n32:10 Comment: Casemiro temporarily retires, the Real Madrid player from São Paulo immediately returns to action.\n32:17 Comment: In the meantime, we are playing again at the Bayern Munich stadium.\n32:23 Comment: Bale returns the ball sportingly and Manuel Noia starts from behind.\n32:32 Comment:  Javi martinez.\n32:34 Comment: Receive Thiago.\n32:38 Comment: Thiago delivers horizontally for Jérôme Boateng.\n32:40 Comment:  Arturo vidal.\n32:42 Comment: Thiago receives it and cushions it with his chest. Opening to the right. Arjen Robben comes up. Philipp Lahm accompanies him.\n32:48 Comment: Receives from the side. Lahm holds on. Ball for Xavi Alonso.\n32:53 Comment: Thiago is turned around.\n32:58 Comment: And turn back for Jérôme Boateng.\n33:1 Comment: Thiago.\n33:3 Comment: He turned around and distributed to the left sector. Here Alaba appears.\n33:10 Comment: Ribery again with Alaba. Playing and playing for Bayern.\n33:15 Comment: Waiting for his moment. Sending Jérôme Boateng up. Insisting with David Alaba.\n33:21 Comment: And it turns around to Thiago.\n33:23 Comment: Playing and playing for Bayern. Waiting for their moment. Sending Jérôme Boateng up.\n33:29 Comment: Insisting with David Alaba. Dani Carvajal had followed him. The ball was lost in the background.\n33:34 Comment: Goal kick for Keylor Navas.\n33:37 Comment: It was a very balanced match. Bayern found the goal. Real Madrid was close.\n33:44 Comment: It hit the post. Well, they are small details that mark the result, but not the process of the match, which is very, very close.\n33:54 Comment: Raise your head Thiago.\n33:57 Comment: Thiago's opening. Alaba comes up. He saves it with his head. Ribery.\n34:2 Comment: Gárez Bale puts his toe in. Throw-in for Bayern.\n34:6 Comment: Little by little in the Bavarian team increasing the presence in the game and the influence of Thiago Alcántara,\n34:12 Comment: In the first minutes he seemed very disconnected, very watched by Casemiro and company.\n34:16 Comment: Yes, the team couldn't find him in the first minutes. And in the last few minutes he is having at least a number of very superficial interventions.\n34:24 Comment: There it is again Thiago. Thiago puts it in with a fantasy pass looking for Alaba.\n34:30 Comment: He praises first-rate even the sight, the one who fails to finish. A penalty is claimed.\n34:34 Comment: Almost, almost with more optimism than arguments at Bayern Munich. Ribery puts it at the near post.\n34:39 Comment: Carvajal just cleared it. Another Real Madrid player lying on the pitch, Rodri.\n34:43 Comment: Yes, Casemiro is lying on the field, no matter how much I think it was in his knee.\n34:47 Comment: I think it was in his knee, now he gets the big whistle from the entire stadium.\n34:53 Comment: Casemiro is hurting a lot.\n34:55 Comment: Yes, it is hurting a lot. The attitude of the people is incomprehensible. Player injured. The team is losing.\n35:2 Comment: He will not throw himself on the ground to waste time. What Real Madrid needs is a goal.\n35:7 Comment: There we have the repeated action. There is the clash between Casemiro and Arturo Vidal. Both of them looking at the ball. Nobody saw the other one coming.\n35:15 Comment: He probably hit him with his knee.\n35:17 Comment: Let's hope he hasn't hurt himself, that he hasn't touched him.\n35:21 Comment: There is now Zidane who at the moment has not sent anyone to warm up at all.\n35:26 Comment: The image of the Spider Cam, Rodrigo, is anything but encouraging.\n35:30 Comment: And the entrance of the stretcher is not there either. Let's see if it's nothing because if not it would be a catastrophe for the Real Madrid midfield.\n35:37 Comment: And good news because the stretcher has to be removed again. And at least Casemiro will be removed on his own feet, limping, limping.\n35:46 Comment: There we have another shot. That's the moment of the crash.\n35:51 Comment: We cannot see from this perspective the moment in which Casemiro steps.\n35:55 Comment: But it seems that after that clash with Arturo Vidal he doesn't support at all well.\n35:59 Comment: And the consequences of that bad step are what Real Madrid's medical services are trying to evaluate.\n36:6 Comment: Casemiro is out for now. Right in front of you, Rodrigo.\n36:9 Comment: Yes, yes. His knee is completely vaccinated. As if it were anesthetized.\n36:12 Comment: It's hard for her to move, it hurts a lot. Let's see how it all ends.\n36:18 Comment: We remain attentive to Casemiro whose weight and importance in this team is more than proven considering that he is the only player of those characteristics in the entire Real Madrid squad.\n36:28 Comment: That's right, yes. It's hard for him to support you. Let's see now if he forgets.\n36:34 Comment: Casemiro returns. He knows the white team again. We don't lose sight of the white team.\n36:39 Comment: Once again he knows the white team. We do not lose sight of the evolution of Carlos Enrique Casemiro who seems limping, seems affected in this return to the field of play.\n36:50 Comment: Arturo Vidal. A Magician of the Shot. Vidal plays for Ribery. He manages to recover Luka Modric. He tries to mount it against Real Madrid.\n36:59 Comment: Ronaldo. He touches the center for Casemiro. First Casemiro for Bale who knew he was offside. We have to let that ball pass. Bayern plays again.\n37:14 Comment: This time showing himself very responsible, making a long run, trying to help Carvajal. What he is having is very little prominence with respect to the opposing goal. A bit like what happened against Atlético de Madrid.\n37:33 Comment: Robben. Facing once again. Philipp Lahm doubles him again. He does the individual action. Robben puts it at the near post without problems for Keylor Navas who projects Dani Carvajal on the right.\n37:47 Comment: Javi Martínez anticipates. Vidal first. Thiago with a fantasy cut-back. He puts it in the gap for Ribery. Nacho will arrive first. Nacho tries to avoid the corner kick and succeeds with a throw-in.\n38:3 Comment: Thiago is appearing more. He is creating a bit of a problem. I don't know if Casemiro still suffers. But in the last 10 minutes Thiago has appeared too much and Bayern Munich appreciates that in their game.\n38:16 Comment: It's like the goal calmed Bayern down and Madrid lost control. They lost the ball and with the ball they lost control of the game.\n38:25 Comment:  Lahm. Opening by he tries to control, he tries to turn around. And that allows the defensive action of Nacho and Barceló. Skorner again.\n38:48 Comment: Exactly. They were both very attentive. Especially Nacho. Not letting him react because if he controlled that ball well it would have been tremendous. Tension.\n38:59 Comment: Robben is going to put another corner looking for Xabi Martínez, Viola, Vidal and company. Ronaldo clears the near post. The fight on the front. David Lava who takes Toni Kroos ahead. Ball for Real Madrid.\n39:11 Comment: Look out for Carvajal, who is now facing Arturo Vidal. He gave him a little touch on the back as if to say this is the second time you've done this to me.\n39:23 Comment: I play first. Luka Vodic back for Sergio Ramos. Kroos comes out from the left.\n39:29 Comment: Nacho in the center for Ramos. Casemiro pressured by Arturo Vidal. Bayern recovered again.\n39:48 Comment: Robben's maneuver was excellent, he would already step on it. Robben is going to put it at the far post. He breaks it. Arturo Vidal's shot goes up. Once again entering like a locomotive. He was close to the second Arturo Vidal for Bayern.\n40:7 Comment: He is the man of the match without a doubt and from there it is Robben who changes gears. If a team were a car Robben would be the accelerator. Without a doubt he would be the accelerator.\n40:22 Comment: And you have to be very careful because his ability to go deeper is tremendous. When he stays hand to hand he just needs to change his pace to create danger for you.\n40:36 Comment: Geron Boateng. The long Boateng hits a header on Tomas Vila who was calling for a foul. Carvajal and Frank Ribery fight together. Bayern plays again. He passes Xabi Alonso to the right for Philipp Lahm.\n40:51 Comment: Thiago. He puts his leg in with the certain Casemiro. This is Cristiano. Kroos raises his head. He finds Bale on the right. The exit was not entirely quick on Real Madrid's part. They have already recovered positions in Bayern's defense.\n41:7 Comment: When Real Madrid has the ball, it advances Casemiro's possession so that both Kroos and Modric come out playing. What happens is that then it lacks the intermediate link to reach the forwards.\n41:20 Comment: Casemiro. Casemiro distributes successfully to the right. Carvajal is facing it. Carvajal puts it in. He touches Ribery with a header. The ball is in front for Bayern. Although Nacho manages to recover quickly.\n41:40 Comment: Ramos. He turns around to Ronaldo. Ronaldo can hit him. Down with Manuel Doya to pat Körner. There was Real Madrid's equalizer. Good shot by Cristiano Ronaldo.\n41:53 Comment: Good turn, good shot. He also took it out with a lot of speed. Good response from Neuer. You know him well, Raúl. Difficult to score a goal from outside the area. But hey, you have to keep trying.\n42:9 Comment: Toni Kroos took a short throw. Marcelo returns again for Kroos who is already in the area. Kroos is emerging. Kroos continues. Kroos hits him. Another one for Real Madrid. Toni Kroos had it. In a rehearsed action from the corner kick. The ball returns to the first shooter. It returns to Kroos who is emerging. And that hybrid between center and shot did not reach its destination. Another for Real Madrid. Kroos could have scored. Cristiano Ronaldo could have deflected.\n42:33 Comment: That's it, yes. That hybrid between a center and a shot. The shot went a little far away but it was strong and well-intentioned. The center passed very close to Cristiano's head.\n42:45 Comment: Tomás Viola claims a foul and Nicolás Rizzoli points it out.\n42:48 Comment: Bayern advances on the right again. Robben tries to surprise. Diago Alcántara. Ball for Arturo Vidal. Vidal facing Modric. Leaves for Ribery. David Alaba joins the attack once again.\n43:8 Comment: Ribery continues. Ball for Viola. Who appears on the front? Kroos appears. There is a foul on Arjen Robben. Dani Carvajal quickly serves. He leads Real Madrid's counter. Benzema on the left. Ronaldo on the right. Carvajal himself. There is Ronaldo facing Alam. About to step into the area. Leave it to Carvajal. Deleganes tries to turn around. He puts the toe into Diago.\n43:32 Comment: The ball is still for Real Madrid. Marcelo goes there. Marcelo puts it. Javi Martínez wins with a header. Mühler's tremendous fall in that pairing with Kroos. There is a yellow card in fact.\n43:45 Comment: The German complains that Bayern Munich should have seen that yellow card in the previous play. So the first for the former Bayern Munich player. Well, Kroos bothered him in that situation. Of course the fall of Mühler It was spectacular but it didn't invite you to think too much about a yellow card either.\n44:2 Comment: He arrived late. He arrived a little late and the spectacular nature of Mühler's fall, I think that's what he did. But, well, Kroos, I think he was a little late for that ball.\n44:32 Comment: Yes, yellow card for the offender. They were asking here precisely now for Lornabas who had been chested, who had hit the white team's defender in the chest.\n44:43 Comment: The Real Madrid players now go to the assistant to ask for explanations. The bench also protests to the fourth assistant. Nacho puts his hands on his head. Carvajal is three-quarters of the same indignant. And Irizoli tells them to go outside. Penalty . Also at what minute huh. Right almost at 45.\n44:58 Comment: My feeling is that one of the assistants whistled it. Let's see, let's see, let's see. That's the penalty they give Carvajal.\n45:8 Comment: We see it again. He cuts Ribery. No, it's not a penalty. It's not a penalty. The hand is also behind him. He wants to hide it.\n45:16 Comment: He awarded a penalty in that incident. Nicolás Irizoli. Very controversial action. The referee made a determination. It's going to cause a lot of people to talk.\n45:27 Comment: And that places Bayern Munich just 11 meters away from expanding their advantage after an action in which Irizoli seems to have indicated the maximum penalty. Indicated, pardon the redundancy, or advised, recommended by the goal judges.\n45:42 Comment: Yes, it felt like he was listening to someone because he didn't make the decision immediately.\n45:48 Comment: Well, but the judge has to see it very clearly and in this play it is not clear.\n45:53 Comment: Vidal hits him. Up, up, up Arturo Vidal's shot. Real Madrid has just saved himself. Vidal had it 2 to 0. Powerful shot. Up. Bayern's only goal advantage remains.\n46:6 Comment: Well, justice has been done. I believe it was not a penalty. What we saw in the first half was not for Bayern to go away with a two-goal advantage.\n46:14 Comment: And well, it seems that it will end with a 0-0 with Real Madrid in the last minutes. They also had some chances. And well, I think the second half is going to be very interesting. Very open.\n46:28 Comment: The only role that Arturo Vidal played throughout the game. And it was very lucky for Real Madrid because otherwise it would have been very difficult.\n46:38 Comment: Benzema leaves it on the front. Bale hits it. Noia catches it safely. Real Madrid's action is great.\n46:44 Comment: He quickly takes out Noia who rushes in and directly gives possession of the ball to the white team.\n46:50 Comment: What an ending to the first part.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:1 Comment: Real Madrid plays, opening towards the left side, Marcelo arrives.\n0:9 Comment: Ramos changes everything, the ball looks for Gareth Bale, he cuts to Davita Lava, Frank Ribery keeps it.\n0:18 Comment: Ribery continues, he leaves Casemiro behind, he tries to put the center in, he stops very close to the baseline.\n0:25 Comment: Ribery continues, paired with Carvajal, the Frenchman falls to the ground, throw-in for Real Madrid.\n0:35 Comment: Ball up from Casemiro.\n0:41 Comment: Javi Martínez protects her, Manuel Noia arrives, Bayern plays again.\n0:44 Comment: Karim Benzema presses, Javi Martínez opening, Arjen Robben is not going to arrive, throw-in for Marcelo.\n1:0 Comment: Toni Kroos, up on Marcelo, Benzema is going to jump, Arturo Vidal wins, but the ball falls to Modric.\n1:8 Comment: Modric starts, there is missing Xavi Alonso and the first rod of the second half, Rodrigo.\n1:13 Comment: Yes, protesting there was applauded first and then followed by Luka Modric, who was complaining about that foul, that demolition, or rather grabbed onto the Croatian.\n1:26 Comment: Yes, the intention was to ask that the game continue like this.\n1:33 Comment: Carvajal came up from the right, he can put the center in for Carvajal, Ronaldo.\n1:37 Comment:  Goal!\n1:46 Comment: From Real Madrid in the 46th minute, goal from Cristiano Ronaldo.\n1:51 Comment: Opening to the right, Carvajal went up once again, who put in a very tense cross towards Ronaldo's unmarking, who hooked him as he came, crossed in front of Neuer and tied the game.\n2:2 Comment: Madrid scores, Cristiano Ronaldo scores, Bayern Munich 1, Real Madrid 1.\n2:8 Comment: A very good opening by Casemiro, indeed the center had the virtue of being very very tense and the definition is wonderful.\n2:15 Comment: Cristiano puts it in a corner, it's not easy to hit that ball, change sticks.\n2:22 Comment: A very good reaction from Real Madrid, this goal comes at a very opportune moment.\n2:27 Comment: The best thing that could happen to him and above all I like that unmarking, with that pause from Cristiano when Carvajal was going to cross.\n2:35 Comment: All Bayern's defenders ran towards the goal, Cristiano paused a little and Carvajal's ball came to him and he finished as he always does.\n2:44 Comment: I never tire of saying that it is a blessing to have those full-backs who, when they arrive, do not go in for just anyone, but rather put the ball to a teammate.\n2:52 Comment: Once again Carvajal becomes one of the most important players on the team.\n2:59 Comment: Imagine the happiness on the Real Madrid bench, the celebration also of the uncalled-up players and above all one phrase, it's about time.\n3:7 Comment: That was what we heard from the position, that we are 5 meters from the Real Madrid bench.\n3:12 Comment: It is Cristiano Ronaldo's third goal in this edition of the Champions League.\n3:14 Comment: He hadn't scored in this competition, which is surely his favorite tournament, since the first two games in the group stage.\n3:22 Comment: He scored against Sporting de Portugal that goal from a free kick in Colmino Morata's comeback, he scored against Borussia Dortmund,\n3:29 Comment: But there was no goal again, neither in the final stretch of the group stage, nor in the previous qualifying round, we tried for the final, prior to this obviously, against Naples.\n3:37 Comment: So Cristiano Ronaldo appeared at the right time and already scored two goals on this same stage in the victory.\n3:42 Comment: Referred to so many times in this preview, the one in 2014 for zero goals to four.\n3:50 Comment: Ronaldo scored, Real Madrid tied, the best way to leave the locker room for Zinedine Zidane's team,\n3:57 Comment: Which beyond what has to do with the result, also puts a lot of complications for Bayern Munich.\n4:4 Comment: Conceding a goal as soon as you leave the locker room alters the entire preparation or everything that may have been discussed during the interval.\n4:10 Comment: It is like that, indeed. The goal is what modifies the game the most psychologically, tactically and technically.\n4:18 Comment: In fact, Cristiano has been playing with a degree of excitement since he scored the goal.\n4:24 Comment: Robben tries to enter from the right, Sergio Ramos prevented him.\n4:29 Comment: Robben continues, connects with Ribery, there is no offside, Ribery inside the area, Ribery puts it back.\n4:35 Comment: Nacho appears to turn off the game and throw in.\n4:44 Comment: Philipp Lahm, no one comes out to cover him, combine Lahm with Ribery.\n4:49 Comment: Ribery did not understand the captain, Bayern Munich lost.\n4:53 Comment: Real Madrid, Escarim Benzema, tries to come out on the counterattack.\n4:58 Comment: He stops suddenly, what a ball for Bill who starts the bike, the position is good.\n5:1 Comment: Bill inside the area, accompanied by Ronaldo and Kroos.\n5:4 Comment: On the front side Ronaldo controls, Cristiano Ronaldo misses that first touch.\n5:9 Comment: The Bayern Munich defense took advantage of it to clear.\n5:12 Comment: The three men at the top appeared with space and it seems that Real Madrid's goal is that they are playing with even more gear.\n5:20 Comment: In the first half they were good but now they are hurting the game.\n5:24 Comment: The three from above appeared and each one showed their best side.\n5:28 Comment: A wonderful pass from Benzema, a very powerful run from Bale.\n5:35 Comment: The last link was missing, Cristiano's control that would have put him in a goal position.\n5:42 Comment: Robben did wonderfully in this last action but Tomás Viola had gone ahead.\n5:47 Comment: So Richoli was right when he called them offside.\n5:49 Comment: Benzema jumps for that ball, the scope is imposed to lower Xabi Alonso.\n5:57 Comment: Alonso of cue delivering for Thiago.\n6:0 Comment: Thiago Alcántara puts it on the progress of Arturo Vidal.\n6:4 Comment: First Robben, there was no understanding with Müller, Keylor Navas keeps it.\n6:11 Comment: Douglas Costa has jumped in to warm up at Bayern.\n6:14 Comment: Another good element, another very dangerous attacker.\n6:18 Comment: We are constantly underlining the quality, the volume in terms of quality of the players from both teams who are on the field.\n6:28 Comment: But the roster on the bench is certainly large and more than enough for both coaches to try to change the script of the game.\n6:36 Comment:  That's how it is.\n6:38 Comment: Especially high quality offensive weapons.\n6:41 Comment: Suffice it to say that Real Madrid has James, Isco and Asensio on the bench.\n6:48 Comment: And that Bayern has Douglas Costa, which is no small thing.\n6:52 Comment: Thomas Müller was called offside and the replay seemed to be enabled.\n6:56 Comment: It seemed that Marcelo was a little behind and that he was allowing Müller to advance.\n7:2 Comment: Well, Ribery's maneuver to overcome Nacho.\n7:5 Comment: It puts it about joining Alaba's attack.\n7:7 Comment: He joins Alaba's attack. Carvajal arrives first.\n7:10 Comment: Carvajal leaving his spur for Gareth Bale's takeoff.\n7:15 Comment: He hits Jérôme Boateng on his head.\n7:19 Comment: Bayern Munich insists on the left. Ribery goes there.\n7:22 Comment: Müller first, he can put the center into Alaba.\n7:25 Comment: First serve deflected by a defender. Nacho out to Casemiro.\n7:29 Comment: The corner kick for Bayern.\n7:31 Comment: Carvajal is all there. She's a piranea back there and when she lets go up there.\n7:37 Comment: He is capable of being clear in his deliveries. He is a player from whom you cannot ask for more.\n7:45 Comment: Thiago short throw. Ball to Ribery.\n7:48 Comment: Ribery overflows, sprints towards the area. He takes it out and David Alaba appears.\n7:53 Comment: Xabi Alonso organizes the attack. Good defensive appearance from Marcelo.\n7:59 Comment: To avoid the combination between Xabi Alonso and Thiago Alcántara.\n8:3 Comment: The same protagonists again. Thiago Ribery is there.\n8:8 Comment: Thiago puts it inside the area. Bale is touched. The ball falls heavily.\n8:12 Comment: Sergio Ramos wins in that duel of heads.\n8:18 Comment: Robben. Xabi Martínez, that opening towards Arturo Vidal is too powerful.\n8:25 Comment: Marcelo Vieira will take a throw-in very close to the area.\n8:28 Comment: We take the opportunity to see from another perspective, from this aerial plane that the Skycam offers us.\n8:33 Comment: The action of Real Madrid's tie.\n8:36 Comment: With Carvajal's wonderful center and Cristiano's first-time shot.\n8:40 Comment: A great goal. Now Real Madrid needs a long possession to feel like they are in control of the situation again.\n8:49 Comment: What happens is that the game is presenting itself for the counterattack and it is tempting to look for the forwards as soon as possible.\n8:55 Comment: Because it gives you the feeling that you can create scoring chances. Look, for example.\n8:58 Comment: For example here in this deep ball from Nacho on Benzema's tackle.\n9:1 Comment: He is accompanied by Ronaldo who is already reaching the finishing area. Benzema about to step into the area.\n9:7 Comment: Benzema continues. More of Benzema who wanted to go alone against the World. Bayern's defense took it away from him.\n9:12 Comment: He only had Cristiano to support him and that possibility was blocked because there was a player who had stood between Eseba and Cristiano.\n9:25 Comment: Marcelo.\n9:26 Comment: Benzema back for Sergio Ramos.\n9:32 Comment: It seems that now Real Madrid is trying to create that long possession that Sorge mentioned to temper Bayern's spirits.\n9:41 Comment: But Ancelotti's team recovers quickly.\n9:45 Comment: Attention Nacho Fernández. Once again on the charge of Real Madrid. It's Marcelo.\n9:51 Comment: Marcelo changes everything.\n9:53 Comment: Combination between full-backs so that Carvajal appears once again on the right.\n9:58 Comment: Carvajal dreams of Modric. Carvajal again and Modric again. The Leganes player ends up on the ground.\n10:4 Comment: Modric puts it on. He bleats! Manuel Noia's clap is spectacular.\n10:9 Comment: There was Real Madrid's second. Bale did wonderfully.\n10:12 Comment: Noia's save to thwart the second target.\n10:15 Comment: It was an Arturo Vidal. It was a header very similar to the one in Bayern's goal.\n10:19 Comment: Noia's response is impressive.\n10:23 Comment: Manuel Noia's tremendous save against Gárez Bell's shot, I couldn't believe it.\n10:28 Comment: It seemed like he was checking it out with a colleague. He really stopped me. Spectacular.\n10:33 Comment: Asensio is preparing to take the field.\n10:37 Comment: Toni Kroos puts all this in from the corner.\n10:40 Comment: Kroos' shot. Ronaldo touches it. Benzema looks for it and picks it up inside the area.\n10:44 Comment: Benzema first. New cross from Marcelo. He sends it to the far post. Santa Bale.\n10:49 Comment: Ronaldo prepares for the shot. Bayern finally takes it.\n10:56 Comment:  Arturo vidal.\n10:59 Comment: Alonso Vidal and Thiago Alcántara.\n11:2 Comment: Orderly departure of the Bavarian team.\n11:6 Comment: Assault finally on the same line. Genroven.\n11:9 Comment: It seemed like he was retired.\n11:11 Comment: Thiago plays short for Philipp Lahm. Real Madrid's change is imminent.\n11:16 Comment: He is already prepared and wearing the Marco Asensio game shirt.\n11:19 Comment: I think Bale is going to come out.\n11:21 Comment: Yes, it's just that I was physically uncomfortable.\n11:26 Comment: Also for a few minutes when he wasn't interrupting the game.\n11:30 Comment: And the Champions League team, the Champions League team, stayed in the center.\n11:33 Comment: I was physically uncomfortable.\n11:38 Comment: Also for a few minutes when he doesn't intervene.\n11:41 Comment: It feels like he's testing himself. Like the twins don't let him feel comfortable.\n11:48 Comment: David Alaba brings out the band.\n11:51 Comment: Viola.\n11:53 Comment: Ribery.\n11:57 Comment: Xavi Alonso's Imprecise Revolution.\n12:0 Comment: Towards Arturo Vidal.\n12:1 Comment: Bayern retreats. Noia plays for Javi Martínez.\n12:8 Comment: Javi Martínez advances on the verge of getting into trouble. Casemiro takes it away from him.\n12:12 Comment: Real Madrid wants to run. Ronaldo wants to run.\n12:15 Comment: Javi Martínez appears and takes the white number 7 ahead.\n12:18 Comment: Another yellow card, Rodrigo.\n12:20 Comment: Yes, for the former Atleti player, Cluido Bilbao.\n12:24 Comment: There he is, looking at that yellow card, the 2 on target.\n12:27 Comment: While Marco Asensio is preparing. He is waiting alone.\n12:30 Comment: Let Rizzoli give the signal, as he is doing now to confirm Major King's entry.\n12:35 Comment: Marco Asensio in. Gareth Bale is leaving.\n12:39 Comment: Well, first of all it must be said that Cristiano Ronaldo got this yellow card.\n12:43 Comment: That caused Javi to make a mistake and then caused him to foul because he started the counterattack.\n12:52 Comment: Well, Bale's game was sacrificed.\n12:54 Comment: With a good scoring chance in the last minutes of the game.\n12:58 Comment: In general with little prominence with the ball.\n13:2 Comment: Not offensive, but I think that great work must be valued.\n13:6 Comment: Because in many moments he has made Madrid practically play or defend with a 4-4-2.\n13:11 Comment: Leaving Cristiano and Benzema.\n13:14 Comment: And the truth is that he has sacrificed himself and has been an important piece as well.\n13:20 Comment: Gareth Bale has left.\n13:21 Comment: First change for Real Madrid.\n13:24 Comment: Marcelo.\n13:30 Comment: Ramos short for Nacho. He puts pressure on Tomás Viola.\n13:37 Comment: We offered Marcelo a first-class hostel.\n13:40 Comment: He shoots Benzema unchecked.\n13:42 Comment: Good ball for Benzema. Flag up. No good.\n13:45 Comment: Karim Benzema was offside.\n13:47 Comment: Karim Benzema prolongs the good moment of play.\n13:49 Comment: He even seems lighter, as if he were thinner.\n13:53 Comment: In the last month of competition he has been the great Benzema.\n13:59 Comment: I think all Madrid fans are looking forward to it.\n14:3 Comment: He seems light. He looks for spaces with the ball. He is very confident.\n14:8 Comment: Gareth Bale is receiving right now.\n14:10 Comment: Until now the medical assistance has put a pocket in the calf of the ball.\n14:16 Comment: Medical assistance has put a pocket in the calf of his right leg.\n14:23 Comment: That's right. It was uncomfortable.\n14:29 Comment: Casemiro. Catching that ball against Tomás Viola.\n14:33 Comment: Keylor Navas clearance.\n14:35 Comment: That falls directly into Boateng's control zone.\n14:37 Comment: The German footballer does not lower it.\n14:40 Comment: Carvajal is also in the head.\n14:43 Comment: Between Garthuro Vidal and Xavi Alonso.\n14:47 Comment: The German players played wonderfully.\n14:50 Comment: Lahm Opening.\n14:52 Comment: Robben is shaping up for the center.\n14:54 Comment: He can't find the space.\n14:56 Comment: Well watched by Marcelo.

He goes to the ground. Javier Martínez is missing, who already has a yellow.\n15:11 Comment:  Rodrigo.\n15:12 Comment: The Navarro player has seen two yellow cards in just 5 minutes.\n15:15 Comment: He sees the red card. Bayern is left with 10.\n15:18 Comment: Second yellow in just 3 minutes.\n15:20 Comment: In two actions starring Cristiano Ronaldo.\n15:22 Comment: Two yellow cards for Javier Martínez.\n15:24 Comment: He's left with one less Bayern.\n15:26 Comment: Well, protagonist in this second part, Cristiano Ronaldo.\n15:28 Comment: Christian, totally. Let's go.\n15:30 Comment: He scored the goal.\n15:32 Comment: He has achieved the expulsion of Javier Martínez.\n15:34 Comment: And well, it was a long time ahead.\n15:36 Comment: And well, let's see in Madrid how the game is going to turn out.\n15:38 Comment:  We'll see.\n15:39 Comment: It's been a long time coming.\n15:41 Comment: And well, let's see in Madrid how these minutes go.\n15:43 Comment: Because I think there is a great opportunity to score another goal and win in Munich.\n15:50 Comment: We saw that action repeated, that shot that turned into the second yellow card.\n15:54 Comment: And the expulsion for Javier Martínez. Does it leave you doubts?\n15:57 Comment: No, none, none. In fact, he didn't protest at all.\n16:0 Comment: Javi interrupted a very dangerous play.\n16:4 Comment: And as always, it's not the same for a defender to wait in the dugout.\n16:7 Comment: You have to go out into the open to look for a player of Cristiano's caliber.\n16:13 Comment: I don't think any Bayern fans protested. There are many.\n16:19 Comment: He was left with ten. The Bavarian team, at the moment, does not seem like there is going to be an immediate movement from the bench.\n16:25 Comment: Yes, yes, yes. Juan Bernat is ready.\n16:27 Comment: Ah, look, yes, yes. I had it right behind the monitor and I couldn't see it. Tell me, Rodri.\n16:30 Comment: The Valencian. He is already prepared to jump into the game.\n16:32 Comment: Receiving the latest instructions. Let's see what is removed.\n16:35 Comment: Juan Bernat is ready, who is certainly not a center back. That's why it seems that they are taking advantage of Alaba's versatility.\n16:40 Comment: He praises, of course. He praises that he has played many times in the central position.\n16:45 Comment: Robben. Robben cuts it off. Robben continues. Robben puts it on. Ribery has fallen.\n16:50 Comment: Elian Penati and the Bayern fans are quite timid.\n16:55 Comment: Throw-in for Philipp Lahm.\n17:4 Comment: Intuitive Casemiro to thwart Thiago's advance.\n17:8 Comment: Another counter project that Real Madrid manages. This time it is Casemiro who is in charge.\n17:12 Comment: Casemiro made a mistake. Ball again for Bayern.\n17:15 Comment: The play called for more braking than acceleration, right? Because he left, it's like he was looking for the problem more than avoiding it.\n17:22 Comment: Besides, Bayern had retreated with many players and with Vidal already throwing himself to the ground. They are not going to try to recover the ball.\n17:30 Comment: There it is, precisely Vidal playing for Xabi Alonso who momentarily takes over as center back.\n17:38 Comment: Thiago is first class. The ball doesn't reach Robben. Ball out. The change comes. Not anymore, not yet. Or yes.\n17:45 Comment: Yes, he arrives and it will be precisely Xabi Alonso.\n17:49 Comment: There is the player who announced a month ago his retirement from football at the end of the current season.\n17:56 Comment: He leaves in all sarra and a Valencian enters. Juan Bernat.\n18:1 Comment: Xabi Alonso out, Juan Bernat in. Bayern Munich's first change. Are you surprised by Alonso's choice?\n18:8 Comment: Yes, I was surprised.\n18:11 Comment: Well, possibly Vidal has more leg and Thiago, well, well, I think he was between Thiago and Xabi Alonso and in the end he decided for Xabi Alonso.\n18:20 Comment: Gerón Boateng, Ball for Vidal. We already have another Spaniard on the field. Juan Bernat.\n18:29 Comment: Thiago first. He controls Viola in an unorthodox way. And that allowed Real Madrid's defensive action.\n18:36 Comment: Marco Asensio first for Modric. Against the white team almost, almost in superiority.\n18:41 Comment: Benzema facing, stepping into the area. Karim continues, looking for the gap. More from Benzema who leaves for two. The ball is left behind.\n18:47 Comment: Who else but Arturo Vidal appears to stop Karim Benzema. It's a throw-in for Real Madrid.\n18:54 Comment: Before, Arturo Vidal had compatibility with Xabi Alonso. Now he is alone managing the center of the field and they will figure it out.\n19:2 Comment: By the way, James and Modric at Real Madrid have been brought out to warm up.\n19:7 Comment: Modric, they are playing.\n19:9 Comment: And Isco, sorry, Isco. We are always with this duality. Isco, Isco.\n19:13 Comment: And Kovacic too.\n19:14 Comment: These are the three Real Madrid players who are doing warm-up exercises. On Bayern's part, Douglas Costa continues, who is leaning towards the bench.\n19:21 Comment: Yes, it is the next change that Ancelotti is going to make. He needs a bit of bite and a bit of speed up there.\n19:26 Comment: Okay, Karim.\n19:28 Comment: Benzema pulling the ball. He receives it from Marcelo, puts it in front.\n19:32 Comment: A route too far gone. Ribery is requested and Rizzoli whistles.\n19:36 Comment: It would be nice if he didn't blow the whistle, come on. Because that same handball served for Ribery's penalty.\n19:40 Comment: Rizzoli points out that Frank Ribery's hand on the forehead.\n19:44 Comment: The French footballer did not discuss it excessively, surely aware that he had used his arm to control that ball.\n19:52 Comment: And from here comes a very good set-piece opportunity for Carlos Blanco.\n19:56 Comment: I mean there are players who understand the moments and those are the most intelligent.\n20:1 Comment: Sergio Ramos came out from the back and hasn't turned around.\n20:5 Comment: Sergio Ramos came out from the back and tried to get back in to head in Karim Benzema's cross.\n20:13 Comment: They know that the rival is with 10 men, that it is time to take advantage of that superiority.\n20:18 Comment: Sula.\n20:20 Comment: Douglas Costa has left, Ribery has left. That's it.\n20:23 Comment: You comment on it because it scares me.\n20:26 Comment: We'll be making the change right away. First, the free kick. Look at the list of pitchers.\n20:31 Comment: Marco Asensio with the left, Ronaldo with the right and also Sergio Ramos.\n20:35 Comment: Looking for Real Madrid's second and Ramos hits it. Off target.\n20:39 Comment: Sergio Ramos's launch was very close.\n20:42 Comment: Very close, he hit it phenomenally and it's a shame. Sergio throws it well, he shoots very well and it was a shame.\n20:49 Comment: Because I don't think it would have arrived.\n20:53 Comment: Rodrigo, the change that went a little unnoticed by us. They did it almost clandestinely.\n20:57 Comment: Yes, yes, yes. Very fast also because Ancelotti had ordered it after the foul, but the referee gave the ok.\n21:3 Comment: So nothing, Douglas Costa has come in, Ribery man for man.\n21:7 Comment: We already have Douglas Costa on the field, a player with qualities that are completely out of the question.\n21:14 Comment: Yes, very injured this season. It only explains why he hasn't had a greater role.\n21:19 Comment: There we have precisely the Gaúcho player in his first intervention.\n21:22 Comment: That she is left behind before another wonder, which is Marco Asensio.\n21:26 Comment: Douglas appears again.\n21:29 Comment: I was waiting for Carvajal to arrive, he wants to get into the four.\n21:33 Comment: We said it's good, but it's not good for getting between four players.\n21:37 Comment: What Douglas Costa was trying was very difficult. Although the ball is still Bayern's.\n21:44 Comment: Robben's control slips, claiming victory.\n21:48 Comment: Robben's control is slipping, he claimed a foul on Sergio Ramos.\n21:52 Comment: It is far above the action of Rizzoli's assistant, who did not press polishable.\n21:57 Comment: Sergio Ramos got involved, he didn't leave an inch.\n22:2 Comment: Madrid has to try to take possession of the ball, because Bayern will continue with one less player.\n22:8 Comment: But they are going to continue being aggressive, they are going to continue trying to have intensity.\n22:13 Comment: And what Real Madrid has to have is patience.\n22:15 Comment: And surely those counterattacks or those scoring chances are going to come.\n22:19 Comment: Ronaldo leaves for Benzema, Ronaldo was looking for her again.\n22:23 Comment: Thiago Alcántara recovered, Arturo Vidal is there.\n22:27 Comment: Thiago Alcántara first slam, viola.\n22:30 Comment: Once again Thiago comes out on the left for Bayern with Juan Bernat.\n22:34 Comment: The Cullera footballer stops.\n22:38 Comment: Hold on Bernat, who leaves it for Arturo Vidal.\n22:41 Comment: Bayern now comes out from the right, Philipp Lahm.\n22:43 Comment: Pull the check, viola.\n22:45 Comment: He prefers to open to the side.\n22:47 Comment: Robben, one for one with Marcelo.\n22:49 Comment: The Dutch player faces once again, leaves Kroos behind.\n22:52 Comment: Go on Robben.\n22:54 Comment: Arturo Vidal for Juan Bernat.\n22:57 Comment: Bernat accelerates towards the baseline.\n23:0 Comment: Keep going Bernat, put the center in.\n23:2 Comment: Neutralize the situation Nacho.\n23:5 Comment: Ball for Real Madrid.\n23:7 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo is going to remove the throw-in.\n23:9 Comment: Bernat managed to center, but with many difficulties.\n23:12 Comment: Because Carvajal had covered it very well again.\n23:15 Comment: Dani Carvajal is having a great game today.\n23:18 Comment: As long as Bernat does not leave Aducas Costa, I will agree with everything he does.\n23:24 Comment: There is no need to put subtitles or make any mention of what Salomon was calmly commenting.\n23:32 Comment: I was willing to translate it, but if you don't let me...\n23:34 Comment: Ronaldo inside the area, Ronaldo, Ronaldo, Ronaldo.\n23:37 Comment: The shot hit a defender, Noia finally keeps it.\n23:41 Comment: Just before we saw that moment, or we recovered the moment in which Xabi Alonso was substituted and came to the bench.\n23:51 Comment: That gesture of frustration after being replaced by Juan Bernat.\n23:58 Comment: Robben.\n24:0 Comment: And the game continues.\n24:2 Comment: Robben.\n24:4 Comment: Casemiro arrived on time.\n24:6 Comment: He not only avoided Robben's shot, but also got the throw-in.\n24:11 Comment: Real Madrid is very aware that Robben is a danger.\n24:15 Comment: And behind Marcelo comes Casemiro and comes Sergio Ramos.\n24:18 Comment: Sometimes one of the two and sometimes both of them together like on this occasion.\n24:22 Comment: In many moments it has been Sergio Ramos who has come out and Casemiro has been placed in the center.\n24:26 Comment: And in this case it was both.\n24:31 Comment: Marcelo hits the top, Boateng put his head in.\n24:36 Comment: Thiago's control is academic for Bayern to play again.\n24:42 Comment:  Vidal.\n24:48 Comment: Lamp to Robben.\n24:54 Comment: Robben plays for Lamp.\n24:56 Comment: Ball back, this is Arturo Vidal.\n24:58 Comment: Modric puts pressure on Thiago Alcántara's position.\n25:1 Comment:  Very good.\n25:4 Comment: Boateng was rushed by Modric's own presence.\n25:8 Comment: He should ask his colleagues to accompany him in the pressure.\n25:11 Comment: Many times it is not about removing the ball, but about causing the failure.\n25:18 Comment: Keylor Navas takes a short goal kick for Nacho.\n25:23 Comment: Carvajal presses Bernat, Achucha Douglas Costa, ball up from Nacho.\n25:27 Comment: First of all, Asensio makes perfect sense for Benzema, which changes everything.\n25:32 Comment: Marcelo goes up from the left, this is Ronaldo.\n25:36 Comment: Ronaldo facing Alain, very close in front.\n25:39 Comment: Marcelo again, Marcelo stops, turns around, Marcelo continues.\n25:43 Comment: Striking zone for Modric.\n25:45 Comment: Modric leaves it for Benzema, Benzema gives it to Modric again.\n25:48 Comment: The white players didn't understand each other.\n25:51 Comment: Although Thiago made a mistake later at the start.\n25:53 Comment: Turn for Toni Kroos.\n25:56 Comment: Modric, hitting zone again.\n25:59 Comment: It opens again to the right, this is Asensio, who Asensio puts it with thread.\n26:2 Comment: Benzema up, another one for Real Madrid, Karim Benzema had it.\n26:6 Comment: All good Asensio, every time he has to intervene he shows his category.\n26:11 Comment: Bayern got out quickly, Tomás Viola fought.\n26:14 Comment: Nacho arrives at the last minute.\n26:17 Comment: Situation under control again for Zidane's team.\n26:20 Comment: Mule is not having a smooth game.\n26:23 Comment: He has both Nacho and Sergio Ramos.\n26:26 Comment: He's not feeling comfortable.\n26:29 Comment: 10 minutes ago José said he had done an extravagant check.\n26:34 Comment: I would say that Mule is playing an extravagant game.\n26:37 Comment: What makes Zidane angry now with that action by Karim Benzema?\n26:41 Comment: Robben's pass, Mule knows he's offside.\n26:44 Comment: That's why Robben is looking for other options, now Mule is enabled.\n26:47 Comment: But Sergio Ramos had not lost sight of him.\n26:49 Comment: Rodrigo Cientoeses is perceived, but the Bayern fans.\n26:52 Comment: Yes, mostly discouragement.\n26:55 Comment: And Anserotti as...\n26:57 Comment: Carvajal, Benzema...\n26:59 Comment: Doya again!\n27:1 Comment: Bayern's goalkeeper again!\n27:4 Comment: Benzema had to stop Real Madrid to make it 1-2.\n27:8 Comment: Another of the party's figures, without any doubt.\n27:12 Comment: This stop is miraculous.\n27:15 Comment: At this moment it is what keeps him alive in the tie.\n27:19 Comment: But Madrid has to keep pushing.\n27:23 Comment: I think the party is broken now.\n27:25 Comment: Bayern is putting in a lot more passion, but not enough head.\n27:29 Comment: And I think that Real Madrid has to try to find that goal with that victory.\n27:33 Comment: You who are from the quarry, put another mark in favor of Carvajal in this match.\n27:37 Comment: Kroos helps looking for Benzema's jump.\n27:40 Comment: Clear Bayern's defense.\n27:42 Comment: Marco Asensio plays header, Boateng does too.\n27:45 Comment: Fight Ramos who goes to the ground with Mule.\n27:47 Comment: Nothing has happened there.\n27:49 Comment: From the ball Marco.\n27:51 Comment: Until he is going to turn around and combine with Luka Modric.\n27:57 Comment: Asensio on the front, he's going to hit him.\n27:59 Comment: Asensio! Doya again.\n28:1 Comment: One more from Real Madrid.\n28:3 Comment: And again Asensio is intervening a lot.\n28:7 Comment: And it suits Real Madrid because it gives clarity to all attacking attempts.\n28:13 Comment: Pressure is on Real Madrid, but Bayern still insists on going out combining short.\n28:18 Comment: Bernat has it on the left.\n28:20 Comment: Bayern is a proud team and an ambitious team.\n28:23 Comment: But that's what's messing him up.\n28:25 Comment: Because with 10 players and against a team like Real Madrid,\n28:28 Comment: I don't know if you wouldn't want to be a little more cautious.\n28:32 Comment: Because Real Madrid feels superior right now and wants to win the game.\n28:39 Comment: Look how quickly Cristiano Ronaldo serves.\n28:42 Comment: Marcelo.\n28:46 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo delivers for Kroos.\n28:52 Comment: Modric.\n28:57 Comment: Leave Nacho for Ramos.

Face none other than Casemiro and Robben.\n34:31 Comment:  Very complicated.\n34:32 Comment: You can see that he is active, that he wants to complicate the defense, but it is complicated in front of those two players, with those two profiles.\n34:43 Comment: And ready at Bayern, the last change Rodrigo.\n34:46 Comment: Yes, Kingsley Coman.\n34:48 Comment: Ronaldo.\n34:50 Comment: He steps into the area, cuts back.

The truth is that I didn't want to speak too badly about Müller, because I was afraid that he would score a goal for us.\n35:20 Comment: Because of the condemnation that we commentators have in these types of situations.\n35:24 Comment: Now you can.\n35:25 Comment: No, I'm not going to say something very bad either, but the truth is that it was very difficult.\n35:30 Comment: And he is a player who has to play with another forward nearby.\n35:35 Comment: I mean, it can't be the only reference. He doesn't know how to play with his back to the opposing team.\n35:39 Comment: Kingsley Coman takes his place. A player with very different characteristics from Müller. A very fast player.\n35:46 Comment: Now he has three great wingers. Douglas Costa, Robben and Coman.\n35:52 Comment: All three with very similar conditions. Three players who accelerate and are difficult to stop.\n36:1 Comment: We are already in the last 10 minutes of regulation time of the game. Facing Coman.\n36:8 Comment: Robben is preferred if he can cheer up. Robben hits him. Keylor Navas catches in two halves.\n36:13 Comment: James is coming out.\n36:15 Comment: What good news that Asensio appears in a game of this stature and that he is even on par with his great teammates and great rivals on the field.\n36:26 Comment: He has played with tremendous self-confidence. He has had a lot of interventions and has noticeably improved the naval reindeer's game.\n36:35 Comment:  Totally agree.\n36:39 Comment: Carvajal.\n36:46 Comment: Modric's opening. The ball reaches Marcelo.\n36:53 Comment: Crosa plays in the center for Casemiro. Ball from one side to the other. Zidane's team circulates the ball quickly.\n37:0 Comment: Carvajal overwhelms, steps into the area. Carvajal continues. Carvajal. Carvajal.\n37:4 Comment: The almost Maladonian action comes from Modric. Marcelo first. Benzema is not worth it. He is not worth it. Flag up.\n37:11 Comment: Karim Benzema was offside.\n37:12 Comment: Out of doubt I had put him in a corner.\n37:15 Comment: But what a play by Carvajal. Score, score. Canterano, score.\n37:20 Comment: We see it again. And yes, Benzema was ahead in what will be his last participation in the match.\n37:27 Comment: Yes, because he is leaving the field of play. James Rodríguez, the Colombian, is going to take his place.\n37:32 Comment: Applause from the bench. Very calm now. You see the faces and the atmosphere on the bench.\n37:37 Comment: There are even jokes at Real Madrid. So what has turned the game and the feelings of Zidane's team around.\n37:45 Comment: Did you like Benzema's game?\n37:47 Comment: A lot. Yes, yes. He looked a lot into the play. Sometimes the team finds him and sometimes they don't.\n37:53 Comment: But he has always been very, very, very, very active.\n37:59 Comment: For me he has been very active and making great movements.\n38:3 Comment: And supporting and supporting colleagues at all times.\n38:33 Comment: Rodriguez.\n38:38 Comment: Rodríguez. Deep shot. Asensio turns. There is no offside. He rushes to the line.\n38:44 Comment: Asensio puts it on Marcelo's career. Casemiro first. James is cleared inside the hitting area. James is not worth it.\n38:51 Comment: Rodrigo was missing.\n38:53 Comment: Yes, about Marcelo. About Philipp Lahm, the captain of Bayern Munich. So I saw him very close to Rizzoli. And a notable foul.\n38:58 Comment: It looks like the guy who did a basketball block on him. And I saw him.\n39:3 Comment: Marcelo charges again. Marcelo overpowered himself. The ball falls directly to Douglas Costa.\n39:11 Comment: Very little, to say almost nothing about the Brazilian since he entered the field in the second half.\n39:16 Comment: There is precisely Douglas Costa. He wanted to put the ball on Kingsley Coman's career.\n39:22 Comment: Yours sincerely Sergio Ramos.\n39:25 Comment: Turn for Marco Asensio.\n39:28 Comment: He's shaping up to be Asensio. He wants to hit him. There's Asensio's shot that hit a defender.\n39:33 Comment: He had diverted Arturo Vidal. Manuel Noya kept him.\n39:43 Comment: Robben's mistake. Lahm goes to the ground. Robben makes a mistake again with a short pass.\n39:51 Comment: James Rodríguez runs. Jerome Boateng arrives first.\n39:55 Comment: The Bayern defender comes out with hierarchy. Ball sought by Kingsley Coman.\n39:59 Comment: Too powerful. Not very precise. Ball for Real Madrid that enters the Bayern Munich field in the last 5 minutes.\n40:8 Comment: With an advantage on the scoreboard and with a very high situation or feeling of control.\n40:15 Comment: The team continues to be ambitious. It continues to arrive with many people in attacking positions.\n40:20 Comment: And the team is very focused defensively.\n40:24 Comment: Sergio is playing with a very high level of concentration.\n40:28 Comment: Driven by Kingsley Coman. I was looking for a partner ahead but there was no one dressed in red.\n40:38 Comment: Control with your chest, Bernat.\n40:44 Comment: Douglas Costa to the center for Arturo Vidal.\n40:48 Comment: Coman receives on the right and is now going to face Marcelo one-on-one.\n40:51 Comment: Lam accompanies her. Coman made a mistake. Lam also got hooked on that action in which he wanted to join the attack.\n40:59 Comment: And from here they can make a new one against Real Madrid.\n41:2 Comment: Coman was wrong but let's agree that Marcelo was right. He stretched his leg and made an impeccable kit.\n41:14 Comment: Casemiro.\n41:22 Comment: Hold on James. Ball back for Marcelo.\n41:28 Comment: Playing with great comfort for Zinedine Zidane's team.\n41:37 Comment: Nacho back for Sergio Ramos.\n41:41 Comment: Real Madrid making Bayern Munich run.\n41:43 Comment: Let's not forget that Real Madrid suffered against Bayern Munich for a long time, for many years.\n41:52 Comment: And now in his last two visits he is playing with a tremendous personality.\n42:1 Comment: Asensio is first class for James. Hitting zone. James continues. Leave it to Marcelo who is going to play it.\n42:6 Comment: Second post. Ronaldo is waiting for her. Ronaldo couldn't control it due to Bernat's slight deflection.\n42:10 Comment: Carvajal insists. Clear Jerónimo Boateng.\n42:14 Comment: What a good move and what a shame that that Christian didn't...\n42:17 Comment: No, Real Madrid is throwing everything at him. In fact in this play the one who centers from the left is Marcelo.\n42:23 Comment: The ball goes beyond the entire defense. Carvajal appears on the opposite side.\n42:30 Comment: Real Madrid seems to want more, right?\n42:33 Comment: And I think it's good because, well, it's a good result.\n42:36 Comment: But hey, one more goal would be much better.\n42:39 Comment: There are still 90 minutes left. It is clear that it is at the Bernabéu and with the Real Madrid fans.\n42:44 Comment: But Bayern has players and is a team that can make things difficult for you.\n42:51 Comment: They take out goalkeeper Manuel Noya. They make it short towards Alaba's position.\n42:56 Comment: Alaba cuts. Leaves for Bernat.\n42:59 Comment: Real Madrid is preparing one last change, right? Rodolfo.\n43:1 Comment: He is preparing, his name is Theo Kovacic.\n43:5 Comment: He has just taken off his tracksuit, he is already wearing the game shirt. It will be the last modification in the team led by Zidane.\n43:15 Comment: Douglas Costa was trying to overwhelm him. Casemiro didn't allow it.\n43:23 Comment: Praise the tracksuit.\n43:24 Comment: Douglas Costa was trying to overwhelm him. Casemiro didn't allow it.\n43:32 Comment: Bayern tries again.\n43:34 Comment: Boateng. Very intense pressure from Ronaldo. Boateng's mistake against Real Madrid.\n43:39 Comment: Kroos is accompanied by James on the right, Asensio on the left. Ronaldo in the center.\n43:44 Comment: Penota for the Colombian who is emerging, who looks for the opening to hit.\n43:48 Comment: Evolution on Toni Kroos. Ball from right to left. Marco Asensio leans on Sergio Ramos.\n43:58 Comment: Asensio, Asensio puts it looking to uncheck Cristiano Ronaldo.\n44:3 Comment: David Alaba cleared.\n44:8 Comment: Casemiro.\n44:11 Comment: Carvajal. James Rodríguez is very close. Ball to Modric.\n44:18 Comment: Modric holds on in the presence of Arturo Vidal.\n44:20 Comment: He was dying to make a mistake.\n44:22 Comment: It was clear that he was going to take someone down. The question was who.\n44:25 Comment: And in the end we found the answer in that action that also turned into a yellow card for Arturo Vidal.\n44:31 Comment: I think Vidal is remembering the penalty because of the great first half he made.\n44:36 Comment: The penalty took him out of his head throughout the game.\n44:39 Comment: And now it's normal. The team is losing and there's a bit of frustration and it seemed like they wanted to make a foul.\n44:45 Comment: And tiredness, because he has made a tremendous effort.\n44:50 Comment: There are already six yellow cards that Rizzoli has shown.\n44:52 Comment: None of them implies a party of disaction due to accumulation.\n44:55 Comment: Boateng, Ramos and Luka Modric were and still are in that situation.\n45:1 Comment: Although in the case of the Croatian, because he is going to be replaced, Modric leaves so that Mateo Kovacic takes his place.\n45:7 Comment: At the moment in which the fourth referee also reveals that the addition will be three minutes.\n45:15 Comment: Well Modric, the midfield was very demanding.\n45:18 Comment: It was a permanent back and forth and he stepped on both areas very frequently.\n45:25 Comment: Very good game, directing Real Madrid's pressure in many moments.\n45:28 Comment: He was the first to come out and also encouraged the other teammates and supported the men above.\n45:35 Comment: And I think a very complete game from Luka, which I think is great news.\n45:41 Comment: Kroos puts it in from the side. Kroos touches the ball.\n45:44 Comment: Noooooo!\n45:49 Comment: No! Sergio Ramos' goal was disallowed.\n45:54 Comment: It took a long time for Rizzoli to indicate that the action was not valid. We will have to see why.\n46:0 Comment: Sergio Ramos' goal was disallowed. We see it there. He started from an offside position.\n46:4 Comment: He looked for a location where he was legally able to finish, but he didn't arrive in time.\n46:10 Comment: So Rizzoli successfully canceled what was 1-3 for Real Madrid.\n46:15 Comment: Yes, that's it.

    "summary": "On a captivating evening at the Allianz Arena, Bayern Munich clashed with Real Madrid in a classic UEFA Champions League showdown. The anticipation was palpable as football fans around the world tuned in to witness two of Europe’s football titans battle it out on a crisp Munich evening.\n\nThe match began with an electric atmosphere, with the Allianz Arena filled to capacity. The opening whistle signaled the start of a much-anticipated contest. From the onset, Bayern Munich pushed forward, displaying their trademark aggressive and high-pressing football. Manuel Neuer came under immediate pressure from Karim Benzema, setting the tone for a match filled with intensity and fervor.\n\nBayern’s defense, marshaled proficiently by Javi Martínez and Jérôme Boateng, sought to transition the ball effectively to their midfield maestros Xabi Alonso and Thiago Alcántara. The opening minutes were characterized by Bayern’s relentless pressing and control of possession. Philipp Lahm and David Alaba, both full-backs renowned for their attacking prowess, made significant advances, setting up the first corner of the game within a few minutes.\n\nFirst significant gameplay incidents spurred from a corner earned by Bayern through Arjen Robben’s efforts. Bayern Munich consistently looked for the towering Arturo Vidal in set-piece situations, though the initial attempts proved futile as Keylor Navas, Real Madrid’s Costa Rican goalkeeper, commanded his area with authority.\n\nIn response to Bayern’s pressure, Real Madrid tried to exploit their quick transitions and long balls upfield. Cristiano Ronaldo became increasingly involved, his defensive contributions noted as he helped out, especially in the first half when Bayern's offensive full-backs, Lahm and Alaba, continually pressed forward. \n\nBayern continued to dominate possession and soon found their breakthrough. After winning multiple corners, the fifth corner finally bore fruit. From Xabi Alonso’s expert delivery, Arturo Vidal surged into the penalty area, rising above the Real Madrid defense to powerfully head the ball past Keylor Navas, marking the first goal of the evening and sending the Allianz Arena into a frenzy. The Chilean's goal symbolized Bayern's dominance in the air and set the foundation for what seemed like it was going to be a night to remember for the Bavarian faithful.\n\nReal Madrid, however, were unperturbed by going behind. The game saw tactical shifts and brilliant individual battles, particularly in the midfield where Thiago Alcántara and Vidal tried to assert their dominance over Kroos, Modric, and Casemiro. In front of goal, Cristiano Ronaldo and Benzema constantly tried to find gaps in Bayern’s defensive line but were often thwarted by Neuer’s vigilant presence.\n\nJust before the break, a sudden moment of controversy erupted. A penalty was awarded to Bayern Munich after a challenge in the box involving Dani Carvajal. Arturo Vidal stepped up to convert what could have been a decisive second goal for Bayern Munich. However, amid the mounting tension and expectations, Vidal’s spot-kick blazed over the bar, allowing Real Madrid a significant reprieve as the half-time whistle blew with the scoreline at 1-0 in favor of Bayern.\n\nThe second half commenced with Real Madrid showing clear intent. Almost immediately, Real Madrid equalized through a move orchestrated down the right by Dani Carvajal. He delivered a perfectly threaded cross for Cristiano Ronaldo, who exhibited his usual clinical prowess by volleying the ball beyond Neuer. The away goal not only drew Real Madrid level but shifted the momentum decidedly in favor of Zidane’s men.\n\nAs the game progressed further into the second half, Real Madrid took advantage of a Bayern Munich squad momentarily unsettled by the rapid change in the scoreline. Real Madrid's tactical discipline and calm ball-possession were on clear display. However, the match took a significant turn when Javi Martínez received his marching orders after picking up a second yellow card following two avoidable fouls on Cristiano Ronaldo in quick succession. Reduced to ten men, Bayern Munich found themselves on the back foot and had to reshuffle their formation, drafting in Juan Bernat as a defensive reinforcement.\n\nThis numerical disadvantage turned the tide substantially in Real Madrid’s favor. Real Madrid pressed high and created several scoring opportunities, much of their creativity springing from the individual brilliance of Marco Asensio, who had been a second-half substitute. Asensio’s vision and precision were instrumental in creating Real Madrid’s second goal. Near the 76th minute, Asensio delivered a perfectly weighted cross toward Ronaldo, who deftly redirected it into the net with his studs past an outstretched Neuer, making it 1-2 in favor of Real Madrid.\n\nDuring the final minutes of regulation time, Real Madrid continued to dominate possession, displaying tactical maturity and fluidity in transitions. Bayern Munich, despite their numerical disadvantage and exhaustion, pushed forward with efforts from Arjen Robben, Franck Ribery, and the additional fresh legs of Kingsley Coman and Douglas Costa, yet they found the disciplined Real Madrid defense hard to break down.\n\nThe last few moments witnessed intermittent forays by Bayern Munich, but to little effect. Manuel Neuer remained Bayern’s bulwark, preventing the scoreline from escalating further despite Real Madrid’s continuous offensive pressure, particularly noting spectacular saves he made to deny Ronaldo and Benzema.\n\nDespite being reduced to 10 men, Bayern's relentless pursuit yielded little, and Real Madrid, orchestrated skillfully by their midfield and guided proficiently by Zidane on the sidelines, ultimately secured a crucial away victory.\n\nIn the end, the referee’s whistle capped off a contest marked by tactical intrigue, exceptional individual prowess, and defining moments of season-impacting actions. The final scoreline read Bayern Munich 1, Real Madrid 2 – an advantageous result for Real Madrid, setting them firmly in a strong position heading into the second leg at the Santiago Bernabéu. This match displayed the undying spirit and tactical awareness of Real Madrid and underscored the latent potential for a stirring comeback by Bayern Munich under the storied lights of the Champions League."
