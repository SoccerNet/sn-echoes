The important Argentinian, Umtiti, Neymar, pursued by Thomas Meunier.\n0:47 Comment: Neymar in depth, Suarez, Rakitic, it circulates well but the pass is not assured, the pass from Busquets.\n0:54 Comment: And the Parisians will therefore recover this ball by Kevin Trapp under the gaze of Unai Ebrie who has so often come to lose here with his Spanish teams.\n1:1 Comment: Parisians who positioned themselves low in this first situation and Barcelonans who remain high.\n1:8 Comment: Trapp's restart is short. He has to extend, there are too many people.\n1:17 Comment: Thomas Meunier taken over.\n1:27 Comment: The Parisians who are going to recover this ball with Lucas, with Kurzawa.

is a moment of hesitation from Kevin Trapp and Luis Flores in ambush.\n3:5 Comment: We can think that Trapp must come out on this ball, in any case many of his partners seemed to be waiting for his intervention.\n3:11 Comment: And it’s a goal which can obviously change a lot of things, in any case which puts a little pressure on Paris Saint-Germain,\n3:17 Comment: which reminds us that we are

the Parisians are really positioned extremely low.\n3:43 Comment: It’s surprising to see them so focused on their goal.\n3:49 Comment: Cavani is 40 meters, 35 meters from his own goal.\n3:52 Comment: And it’s the most advanced.\n3:56 Comment: We see the sign of Emery who asks his team to step up, who tries to remain impassive and above all not transmit any nervousness to his players.\n4:9 Comment: And we see the Barcelona defenders really coming into contact with the Parisian attackers, not letting them turn around.\n4:19 Comment: Marco Verratti for Jules Cuffran, under the existence of the

content to throw away the balls that they manage to intercept.\n5:5 Comment: They need to be able to hold the ball a little more.\n5:11 Comment: We can imagine that after the emotion of the moment,

no solution to throw short and when he throws long, the ball is lost straight away.\n6:5 Comment: It’s the opposite scenario of the assist match, with Barcelona remaining high.\n6:10 Comment: Call from Suarez, it’s controlled by Marquinhos.\n6:14 Comment: In two stages, Marquinhos with Meunier, who will be immediately pressed.\n6:18 Comment: This is what the Barcelonans never did in the first

goal.\n39:35 Comment: It’s a goal given to FC Barcelona just before half-time.\n39:39 Comment: At the worst time just before halftime.\n39:42 Comment: How to expose yourself like this to an experienced defender like Marcigno.\n39:52 Comment: We see the Parisian looks.\n39:54 Comment: It’s a goal that could change everything Paul.\n39:56 Comment: With Andrés Iniesta who went all the way on Suarez's pass.\n40:1 Comment: And Marcigno who missed it.\n40:2 Comment: And behind Turzava’s big miss.\n40:4 Comment: Who totally misses his clearance.\n40:6 Comment: And that puts Paris in trouble.\n40:8 Comment: It’s extremely difficult for Turzava.\n40:10 Comment: Because Trapp lightly touches the ball.\n40:13 Comment: And Turzava for me has nothing to do with it.\n40:15 Comment: It’s Marcigno who must protect the ball better.\n40:17 Comment: Clear into touch if necessary.\n40:19 Comment: And there he takes a considerable risk.\n40:21 Comment: We were saying it two minutes ago Paul.\n40:23 Comment: The Parisians are not in danger.\n40:25 Comment: Of course they don’t have the ball but they don’t concede any chances.\n40:27 Comment: And this goal is still the first.\n40:29

I say it again, they need to be much more threatening.\n40:44 Comment: They have to be able to hold the ball and lead counter-attacks.\n40:47 Comment: Without that they will remain under threat from Barcelona players all the time.\n40:53 Comment: Ignestap's little alenade appears completely innocuous.\n40:56 Comment: It’s a ball that seems lost for Barcelona.\n40:58 Comment: Yes, but it’s the right move because it’s a good bet.\n41:0 Comment: He’s looking for Rafinha.\n41:3 Comment: And be careful. Pay attention to the very high recovery of the Barcelona residents.\n41:6 Comment: With Rafinha for Rakitic.\n41:8 Comment: Curzava's clearance was again blocked.\n41:10 Comment: Busquets.\n41:14 Comment: It will be too long. It will be a goal kick.\n41:20 Comment: Which seemed like a few minutes ago.\n41:23 Comment: And then there is a goal.\n41:31 Comment: Which seemed totally improbable 40 minutes ago.\n41:34 Comment: This word is beginning to take on substance.\n41:37 Comment: Remontada that we refuse to use.\n41:40 Comment: That we ban from our vocabulary.\n41:42 Comment: Is emerging.\n41:44 Comment: It seemed impossible because\n41:46 Comment: I thought the Parisians were going to show a lot more control than that.\n41:49 Comment: There they lose the balloons too quickly.\n41:51 Comment: So there’s another diving fault.\n41:53 Comment: A big diving foul, Mr. Referee.\n41:55 Comment: A big mistake from a player who has already been warned.\n41:57 Comment: It's going to turn red. Oh no, say no.\n41:59 Comment: He takes it for asking.\n42:2 Comment: He was right to ask for Cavani.\n42:4 Comment: It’s a big refereeing decision.\n42:6 Comment: He was going for Edinson Cavani.\n42:12 Comment: It is extremely indisputable what has just happened.\n42:15 Comment: Look at Edinson Cavani who makes the difference.\n42:17 Comment: Pique has already been booked in this match.\n42:19 Comment: Cavani is alone on goal.\n42:24 Comment: We know very well that asking for a card.\n42:27 Comment: It’s more serious than making a big mistake.\n42:29 Comment: It’s difficult to always receive.\n42:32 Comment: This is a scandalous decision.\n42:37 Comment: Lucas to strike the coufran for Paris Saint-Germain.\n42:41 Comment: Lucas is the man who should no longer be on the field who clears.\n42:45 Comment: Pique. Neymar.\n42:49 Comment: He’s got something.\n42:50 Comment: Oh, what power.\n42:57 Comment: I will say that Neymar has something.\n43:2 Comment: A little something.\n43:4 Comment: Beyond the talent, it is above all the rage for the aspect in which he evolves which is incredible.\n43:9 Comment: Neymar is a fantastic fighter.\n43:19 Comment: Things already got heated earlier with Macerano.\n43:21 Comment:  Attention.\n43:25 Comment: Pique.\n43:27 Comment: Bousquetz with Messi.\n43:29 Comment: Suarez.\n43:30 Comment: Rafinha.\n43:33 Comment: Leo Messi.\n43:34 Comment: Leo Messi, Rafinha.\n43:36 Comment: Rafinha, Suarez.\n43:38 Comment: A biased player who came to cut off this attack.\n43:42 Comment: And who gives the ball back to Bousquetz.\n43:45 Comment: Macerano, Iniesta.\n43:48 Comment: Bousquetz.\n43:50 Comment: We’re seeing a Barça again that we haven’t seen in a very long time.\n43:53 Comment: We’ve been coming back for a long time too.\n43:55 Comment: We must recognize the merit of the Barcelais this first period.\n43:59 Comment: Baxler.\n44:0 Comment: Lucas.\n44:1 Comment: They have technical waste tonight.\n44:3 Comment: In recovering the ball.\n44:5 Comment: I think it’s been a very long time since Barça have put in a performance of this dimension.\n44:8 Comment: In the intensity and in the commitment it is true.\n44:9 Comment: But in the use of the ball we have known them to be even sharper.\n44:13 Comment:  Fortunately.\n44:14 Comment: Fortunately there is actually a lot of waste in Barça’s last phase this evening.\n44:17 Comment: Because that would have been even more worrying for us.\n44:21 Comment: It’s true that on the Parisian side it’s been a long time since we’ve seen them hustle like that.\n44:24 Comment: We haven’t seen them so feverish for a long time.\n44:29 Comment: We're not going to say that having won 4-0 in the first leg does them a disservice.\n44:34 Comment: This is the paradox of this first period.\n44:35 Comment: Midnight indeed.\n44:37 Comment: Verratti with the bouffrant.\n44:38 Comment:  Mathieu Nicke who is going to position himself as a smart guy.\n44:43 Comment: On the side of Marc Ugnos.\n44:44 Comment: Thiago Silva is the opposite.\n44:45 Comment: He chooses the side.\n44:47 Comment: It was a poor shot from Marco Verratti who had a very, very average first half.\n44:50 Comment: There will be 3 additional minutes in this first period.\n44:53 Comment: 3 more minutes of happiness.\n44:57 Comment: But also more tension this evening.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Marc Quignos with Thiago Silva.\n0:4 Comment: PSG 45 minutes away from a 4th consecutive Champions League quarter-final.\n0:12 Comment: Oh, what a lovely pass.\n0:15 Comment: Matuidi’s magnificent pass.\n0:17 Comment: It’s time with Draxler.\n0:18 Comment: Draxler penetrating.\n0:19 Comment:  And the return.\n0:20 Comment: And Ter Stegen’s save to prevent a corner.\n0:24 Comment: But he hadn’t done an action.\n0:26 Comment: He gave it the corner to the referee.\n0:27 Comment: He hadn't done anything like that in the first half.\n0:29 Comment: A very, very good sequence.\n0:30 Comment: They left their camp.\n0:31 Comment: They were able to string together forward passes.\n0:33 Comment: And Draxler went crashing.\n0:35 Comment: It's almost the best action from Paris since the start of the match.\n0:38 Comment: It’s Rafinha.\n0:39 Comment: Yes, there was Lucas' strike.\n0:45 Comment: Come on, a corner, a stone was thrown.\n0:48 Comment: A header from Cavani, a header from Thiago Silva.\n0:50 Comment: We dream of it at this precise moment of the evening.\n0:52 Comment: And Draxler's attempt, obviously very complicated, to regain his ball for the young German.\n1:8 Comment: Look, Parisian pressing situation in the Barça camp.\n1:12 Comment: We hold ourselves in a high position.\n1:13 Comment: We didn’t see that at all in the first half.\n1:15 Comment: Yes, clearly a change of strategy on the PSG side.\n1:18

first half.\n1:41 Comment: Yes, that’s it, the block has gained 20 meters.\n1:43 Comment: Rafinha, Rafinha who eliminates.\n1:45 Comment: So obviously, the Parisian eliminated.\n1:47 Comment: On the other hand, there will be a little more space.\n1:50 Comment: Rakitic.\n1:53 Comment: It’s Rabiot’s fault.\n1:55 Comment: It’s Rafinha.\n1:56 Comment: A mistake that must be avoided all the same.\n1:58 Comment: He’s far from the goal.\n2:0 Comment: He’s not in a position to dribble.\n2:3 Comment: Maybe they need that too, Paul.\n2:4 Comment: To add a little intensity.\n2:6 Comment: It could perhaps be two or three mistakes.\n2:10 Comment: It’ll put them back in the game.\n2:11 Comment: Rafinha with Rakitic.\n2:14 Comment: He’s going to try to get that ball out.\n2:17 Comment: Not

penalty.\n2:51 Comment: So there, his assistant…\n2:52 Comment: Oh, he’s changed, he’s changed.\n2:53 Comment: His assistant told him that he had to designate the penalty point.\n2:56 Comment: Did you see, Paul?\n3:0 Comment: There was a penalty.\n3:1 Comment: There was an expulsion earlier for stinging.\n3:3 Comment: But there is a penalty there.\n3:7 Comment: Aymeric, he doesn’t flinch.\n3:9

course.\n3:22 Comment: Yes, because Neymar is in a position to recover the ball.\n3:26 Comment: Yes, Neymar is going to get him too.\n3:28 Comment: He obviously doesn’t do anything to avoid

here he is.\n12:59 Comment: And once again, he did not make the perfect Leo Messi gesture in an area where he is king.\n13:8 Comment: He still marked a very important pedal.\n13:13 Comment: Come on, a counter-possi for PSG with Draxler against Mascherano.\n13:21 Comment: Di Maria, the hero of the match. Come on.\n13:24 Comment: Matuidi.\n13:29 Comment: And Rati towards Thomas Meunier. In one touch, there was an idea.\n13:32 Comment: And the corner given by Lumpiti.\n13:34 Comment: He hasn't had much opportunity to ride Thomas Meunier but when he does, it's sharp.\n13:39 Comment: The one who was with Cavani’s post earlier.\n13:41 Comment: It's still very very good that this corner obtained thanks to the rise of the Belgian defender.\n13:46 Comment: It's very, very limited. There was a fault from Verratti on Messi.\n13:50 Comment: Very very very limited.\n13:52 Comment: I think Verratti is exposing his team by making this gesture on the edge of the penalty area.\n14:1 Comment: Come on, this corner we all dream of Paul. This corner we all dream of.\n14:5 Comment: André Ldi Maria now is there for the beauties.\n14:10 Comment: First post, Blaise Matuidi. It's circulating in the penalty area.\n14:14 Comment: She might not.\n14:17 Comment: They are not very happy with this type of situation.\n14:21 Comment: There's going to be one.

In any case, it really calmed down the atmosphere here.\n17:30 Comment: The supporters who took a huge blow to the head.\n17:33 Comment: We could not imagine for a single moment in this match that Paris would not score.\n17:38 Comment: Faced with this team, Paris did it.\n17:44 Comment: Rakitic.\n17:48 Comment: Mascherano.\n17:52 Comment: Pique.\n17:55 Comment: Neymar.\n17:59 Comment: There is no fault, there is no fault, it plays.\n18:3 Comment: With André El Dimaria, the man who recovered the ball.\n18:6 Comment: Dimaria finding Draxler.\n18:8 Comment: But there is the call from Edin Saad-Kanani.\n18:10 Comment: No offside position for Edin Saad-Kanani.\n18:12 Comment: And Ter Stegen’s extraordinary left-foot save.\n18:17 Comment: There will probably be other situations like this for Paris.\n18:20 Comment: Because Barça will inevitably deliver.\n18:23 Comment: But if Neymar.\n18:25 Comment: Neymar who made the difference.\n18:26 Comment: Neymar who is going to challenge Marquinhos.\n18:28 Comment: His friend with whom he was Olympic champion this summer.\n18:31 Comment: Oh, Neymar made a big mistake on Marquinhos.\n18:33 Comment: He’s going to get a Neymar card.\n18:35 Comment: What color will this cardboard be?

with a mistake.\n26:30 Comment: He fouls Marquinhos.\n26:34 Comment: It’s the frustrated Suarez, the Suarez capable of making bad gestures that we see this evening.\n26:42 Comment: So a priori Serge Laurier will replace Draxler.\n26:45 Comment: He will move to the left and they will overtake the right side certainly with Meunier higher up and Aurier taking the right-back position.\n26:55 Comment: They have already done it in the European Cup.\n27:1 Comment: We'll also take Darda Turan at the entrance.\n27:9 Comment: Kiki, Piqué, Mascherano.\n27:15 Comment: 3 points for Kamara!\n27:33 Comment:

have to keep this ball.\n28:40 Comment: It was Messi who recovered it, Messi against Marquinhos, Léo Messi’s strike.\n28:47 Comment: It’s one of Messi’s very first strikes in this match, I don’t know if he had already hit there.\n28:50 Comment: Yes on Koufran, two direct free kicks.\n28:53 Comment: I’m not sure we saw him hit tonight.\n28:59 Comment: The change announced by Dominique Carman which becomes clearer as we see Messi's strike again.\n29:3 Comment: He manages to get into a striking position on this action.\n29:7 Comment: Despite everything we can question his position, there he plays in support of the attackers, in support of the advance.\n29:14 Comment: I think he’s still more effective when he plays as a real attacker,\n29:19 Comment: when he plays right attacker or free attacker.\n29:23 Comment: There he plays attacking midfielder and I find that this position suits him in advance.\n29:30 Comment: This position suits him less well.\n29:33 Comment: That’s as announced, so Aurier right back, Meunier a little higher.\n29:38 Comment: I told you earlier, he had already done it in the European Cup, it was in Lyon.\n29:42 Comment: With success.\n29:47 Comment:  A quarter of an hour.\n29:49 Comment: And that will also change at Barça, Sergi Roberto for Rafinha.\n29:57 Comment: The Mayor with Arda Thuram.\n30:1 Comment: This Atlético Madrid Day.\n30:5 Comment:

only conceded four goals twice since Qatar owned him.\n30:45 Comment: A defeat in Bastia in Lyon we remember, just after Christmas.\n30:48 Comment: And then, the famous 4-re-everywhere in Lyon in 2012.\n30:54 Comment: Five years ago already.\n30:57 Comment: These are the only two matches in which the Parisians have conceded four goals.\n31:1 Comment: That’s their challenge.\n31:3 Comment: These are the only two matches in which the Parisians conceded 4 goals.\n31:7 Comment: It’s their evening challenge not to take a fourth.\n31:10 Comment: Messi.\n31:13 Comment: This goal is still

    "summary": "In one of the most dramatic and extraordinary matches in the history of the UEFA Champions League, FC Barcelona achieved a historic 6-1 victory over Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) at Camp Nou. The result saw Barcelona overturn a massive 4-0 deficit from the first leg to progress to the quarter-finals, showcasing their resolve and flair in a night that will be remembered for generations. The match epitomized the unpredictability and excitement of European football, with a multitude of twists and turns.\n\nAs the game commenced, it was evident that Barcelona would approach the match with high intensity. The opening moments were marked by a sense of urgency as Barcelona players, led by the experienced Ivan Rakitic, aggressively pursued the ball. The defensive lineup featured Gerard Piqué at the heart of a three-man defense, flanked by Javier Mascherano on the right and Samuel Umtiti on the left. \n\nIn the first minute, Barcelona started dictating the play, maintaining possession and applying significant pressure on PSG. Neymar, who was instrumental for Barcelona throughout the night, began to make his mark as early as the second half-minute. The Brazilian, along with Rafinha and Luis Suarez, sought to carve open the defensive lines of PSG, testing goalkeeper Kevin Trapp within the initial 30 seconds. This relentless pressure soon paid off when, in the third minute, Luis Suarez capitalized on a defensive mishap from PSG to flick the ball past Trapp. It was an electrifying start that gave Barcelona an early 1-0 lead, significantly boosting their morale and belief.\n\nThroughout the first half, Barcelona pressed forward tirelessly, maintaining high defensive lines and putting constant pressure on PSG's backline. Their pressing game disrupted PSG's build-up play, forcing several errors. The visitors, on the other hand, struggled to retain possession and create meaningful play. Midfield maestros Marco Verratti and Blaise Matuidi found themselves frequently dispossessed by the combative Busquets and the dynamic Andres Iniesta. \n\nDespite PSG's attempts to disrupt Barcelona’s momentum, it was the home side's superior efforts that bore fruit again just before the halftime whistle. In the 40th minute, Andres Iniesta’s clever flick off a Suarez pass forced an own goal by PSG's Layvin Kurzawa, further narrowing the aggregate score to 4-2. This critical second goal imbued the Blaugrana faithful with immense hope as the teams headed into the break.\n\nThe intensity of the match escalated as the second half began, with another quick goal for the hosts. Just five minutes after the restart, Neymar earned a penalty following a clash with Thomas Meunier. Lionel Messi converted the spot kick with precision in the 50th minute, putting Barcelona only one goal away from leveling the aggregate score. At 3-0, Barcelona sensed the opportunity for one of the greatest comebacks in football history.\n\nParis Saint-Germain briefly found their composure and a vital counterattack in the 62nd minute, saw Edinson Cavani score with a powerful finish past Marc-Andre ter Stegen. This goal seemed to quash Barcelona’s hopes, as it pushed PSG’s aggregate lead to 5-3. Barcelona now needed three more goals to advance, a seemingly insurmountable task with less than 30 minutes remaining.\n\nHowever, Barcelona surged forward with renewed belief and refusal to accept defeat. Neymar, adopting the role of the talisman, sparked further drama. In the 88th minute, he curled a stunning free kick into the top corner, leaving Kevin Trapp helpless and reigniting belief in the Barcelona camp. The stadium roared with anticipation and possibility. \n\nMoments later, in the dying moments of regular time, Neymar was at the heart of the action again, winning a second penalty after a tussle with PSG’s defenders. Showing remarkable composure, he converted the penalty kick in the 91st minute, making the score 5-1 on the night and 5-5 on aggregate. Barcelona were now only a goal away from one of the most miraculous turnarounds the sport has ever seen.\n\nThe match reached a fever pitch in the final moments of stoppage time. Barcelona piled on the pressure, camping inside PSG’s half and bombarding their goal. It was in the 95th minute that the impossible happened: Neymar, orchestrating the attack, floated a delicate ball into the penalty area, finding Sergi Roberto who timed his run to perfection and sent the ball into the net with an outstretched foot. The stadium erupted as Barcelona had done the unimaginable, leading 6-1 on the night and 6-5 on aggregate.\n\nBarcelona's tactical approach, unwavering determination, and individual brilliance, particularly from Neymar, were pivotal to this historic feat. Despite PSG having secured an impressive 4-0 advantage in the first leg, Barcelona demonstrated that no lead is insurmountable in football. This match not only secured their place in the quarter-finals but also solidified their legacy as one of the most resilient and formidable teams in European club football. \n\nThe high-octane encounter encapsulated everything that makes football the world's most popular sport: unpredictability, drama, tenacity, and sheer emotional rollercoasters. For Barcelona, it was an evening of extraordinary triumph and jubilation, while for PSG, it was a catastrophic collapse that will likely be scrutinized and dissected for years to come. The 6-1 victory over PSG at Camp Nou will forever be enshrined in the annals of football history as a testament to Barcelona’s unyielding spirit and tactical genius."
