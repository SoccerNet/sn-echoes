Comment: It's not easy, you have to move the ball quickly and look for that space that will surely arrive.\n10:29 Comment: And Madrid is doing it well, they are trying to play with one touch or two touches.\n10:34 Comment: Now Toni Kroos has lost control, but that is the idea that Real Madrid has to continue to maintain.\n10:42 Comment: Very compromised session for Zielinski, Pepe Reina had to get rid of it.\n10:47 Comment: And that automatically translates into Real Madrid recovering the ball.\n10:55 Comment: Carvajal.\n10:59 Comment: Look for partners, look for options.\n11:1 Comment: Luka Modric finds Ramos,\n11:3 Comment: permanently open on the left side and almost always free of surveillance Marcelo,\n11:7 Comment: which is making the most practical exit for Real Madrid.\n11:10 Comment: Good ball for Ronaldo, Ronaldo looking for Benzema.\n11:13 Comment: The French striker has come to touch.\n11:15 Comment: The action continues on the part of James Rodríguez.\n11:17 Comment: James perceives it and puts it James,\n11:19 Comment: Too powerful delivery, impossible for Cristiano Ronaldo.\n11:23 Comment: Another good approach for Real Madrid, Benzema's shot lacked forcefulness.\n11:27 Comment: Well, in the end Real Madrid is having more arrivals.\n11:29 Comment: Benzema has already had two chances to score a goal and this is the line that Real Madrid has to follow.\n11:34 Comment: Good Christian in unchecking space.\n11:36 Comment: Good control because it wasn't easy and great center.\n11:39 Comment: The pity was that Benzema was also a little forced, he tried but he didn't hit it with all the strength and with all the direction.\n11:46 Comment: What Cristiano Ronaldo does in that action is very complicated because he controls it with his leg and center,\n11:51 Comment: and immediately after with the other.\n11:52 Comment: Yes, complicated, Real Madrid's pressure was very good.\n11:56 Comment: Good ball from James, Benzema up again.\n11:59 Comment: He tried his luck again, he hit the header again.\n12:4 Comment: Zinedine Zidane's team continues to accumulate approaches, continues to accumulate attempts.\n12:10 Comment: Reacting immediately to the information we have repeated.\n12:13 Comment: The very surprising shot from very far away, more placed than powerful by Lorenzo Insigne.\n12:19 Comment: Yes, the truth is that he has done very well.\n12:21 Comment: I think Insigne has realized that Keylor was not well positioned and well,\n12:26 Comment: With a hit that was not very strong but very placed because it could have surprised.\n12:30 Comment: This goal I think is what Napoli dreamed of before arriving, scoring a goal in the first addition and they achieved it very early.\n12:38 Comment: How well Benzema has done recovering that ball and forcing the throw-in.\n12:43 Comment: Making Benzema suffer a lot and not only Benzema, but also Cristiano and Marcelo to the Naples side.\n12:49 Comment: Yes, what they have to do is have a lot of mobility, both Cristiano and Benzema, like James.\n12:57 Comment: Because they accumulate a lot of people and if there is no mobility, both with and without the ball, it will be much more complicated.\n13:2 Comment: But so far the truth is that Real Madrid is giving a good impression even if they are behind on the scoreboard.\n13:10 Comment: Yaguaran, Manek Hamsic, very compromising situation for Hamsic.\n13:14 Comment: Leave behind for Reina, Reina delivers to the left sector for Fausti Bulam.\n13:19 Comment: Insigne slips from the ground, combines with Hamsic.\n13:21 Comment: Hamsic went down, let Escomina continue, good partnership for Naples that ends here.\n13:26 Comment: As soon as Casemiro and Sergio Ramos appear, what happened to the Naples player?\n13:30 Comment: Rodri.\n13:31 Comment: He was complaining about a hit by Casemiro Bulam that is still being attended to on the field of play.\n13:34 Comment: Even Carvajal himself, at the moment when he was serving the ball played by Real Madrid, reproached him for throwing himself at the Naples player.\n13:44 Comment: In all this the action continued, Cristiano Ronaldo was indicated offside in this change of orientation.\n13:49 Comment: Just before, in the immediately previous match, Fausti Bulam was complaining about this blow by Casemiro.\n13:55 Comment: It was a fight, I think he could have also called a foul, but the referee didn't see it that way.\n14:3 Comment: Good anticipation from Ramos, he put his leg into Mertens, there was no foul.\n14:8 Comment: Koulibaly.\n14:12 Comment: Bulam hits short, Insigne returns, raises the assistant's flag indicating the foul.\n14:19 Comment: Foul by James Rodríguez, ball for Naples.\n14:24 Comment: To the ground Modric, with a bit of luck for Napoli that comes out in this game.\n14:28 Comment: Numerical superiority, 5 to 4.\n14:30 Comment: There's Zielinski with the opening for Callejón.\n14:34 Comment: Alley stops, deliver for Hamsik.\n14:36 Comment: Once again Callejón, recovers positions in Real Madrid's defense, but the ball is still for the Italian team.\n14:43 Comment: He saves her over the Isai line.\n14:46 Comment:

to advance.\n14:59 Comment: Insigne, diagonal of Callejón, Lorenzo Insigne is looking for you.\n15:3 Comment: Very attentive Sergio Ramos, in an action that Raúl created, we will have to be prepared to see it recurrently in this Sarri's Naples.\n15:10 Comment: We already saw it in the preview of the game and we have seen that Callejón,\n15:13 Comment: Quickly look for that diagonal and try two, three, four, ten times until good,\n15:18 Comment: That one appears and one can turn out well, let's hope not, that it won't be today.\n15:22 Comment: Imprecise in that delivery, Carvajal applauds, James Rodríguez the attempt, the intention of his partner.\n15:30 Comment: Position again for the visitor today at the Bernabéu for this Naples that is surprising, that is winning.\n15:37 Comment: Thanks to the goal scored by Lorenzo Insigne.\n15:41 Comment: Thanks to the goal scored by Lorenzo Insigne in the eighth minute.\n15:47 Comment: Once again in charge of Mauricio Sarri's team, it is Zielinski.\n15:51 Comment: Zielinski, inside ball, Hamsic doesn't arrive, Rafael Varane did.\n15:57 Comment: Napoli insists, Diaguara insists.\n16:3 Comment:  Alley.\n16:4 Comment: Zielinski arrives from the Toni Kroos stage, the Pole's evolution, ball back, Real Madrid stretches,\n16:12 Comment: Albiol regresses even more for Koulibaly and this one even more for the queen, Achucha Karim

Yellow card, the second.\n6:36 Comment: Sergio Ramos had seen the first one, the Croatian sees it now.\n6:41 Comment: I think it was an unnecessary foul and in the end it came a little late.\n6:47 Comment: The yellow card is fair.\n6:50 Comment: A shame, but there is Luka.\n6:52 Comment: I think I trusted him that he could get there.\n6:55 Comment: And he arrived those tenths late that made the rival hit and make a foul.\n7:0 Comment: Ramos pay attention to prevent that ball filtered by Mertens from reaching its destination.\n7:6 Comment: Modric.\n7:9 Comment: He stops before Hamsik.\n7:10

A short Carvajal is offered, an action rehearsed again.\n7:46 Comment: Carvajal hides it, returns to James, the ball reaches the front.\n7:49 Comment: This is Modric, Modric more forward, shooting

Reina is complicated.\n8:14 Comment: There are already two occasions in which Real Madrid looks for the rehearsed action, the launch of a short corner.\n8:20 Comment: Yes, he is looking for those rehearsed plays in which I think he can do damage and also surprise.\n8:27 Comment: Although Real Madrid taking direct corners is very dangerous.\n8:31 Comment: With Sergio Ramos, with Paran, with

Comment: The action seemed like it had already died, that it was over, that it had to be started again.\n9:4 Comment: Parabola ball that falls close to the Brazilian and he decides with all his energy.\n9:11 Comment: Possible determination, not letting it fall.\n9:14 Comment: Put the entire instep of your right foot looking for a missile like the one that comes out in the direction of the Naples goal.\n9:22 Comment: Impossible for Pepe Reina, there are many Champions League left.\n9:25 Comment: But we just saw one of the goals of the season in this tournament.\n9:29 Comment: Marca Casemiro, what a great goal for Real Madrid.\n9:32 Comment: Real Madrid 3, Naples 1.\n9:35 Comment: Totally agree, what a goal.\n9:36 Comment: What a great goal, how we saw it when the ball went out because it was impossible for Pepe Reina.\n9:42 Comment: Great goal from Real Madrid.\n9:43 Comment: Real Madrid started the second half with a lot of intensity, with a lot of aggression.\n9:48 Comment: Now it's time for the game and the tie.\n9:52 Comment: There are still 35 minutes left and Real Madrid will have to continue with this attitude.\n9:57 Comment: But having a head because now it has a favorable result that is not definitive.\n10:4 Comment: And being able to go for the fourth goal would be another goal of peace of mind.\n10:8 Comment: I think that going with three differences, having scored here with Napoli with three goals difference, I think it would be a great result.\n10:16 Comment: And that's why things are starting to move and there is movement on Zidane's bench.\n10:21 Comment: Isco, Morata and Lucas Vázquez jump in to warm up.\n10:26 Comment: There is a corner in favor of Naples.\n10:29 Comment: The Italian team executes it short.\n10:31 Comment: Evolution on Fauci and Goulam.\n10:33 Comment: Goulam agamado with the center.\n10:35 Comment: Now the ball is going towards the area but very, very past, very powerful.\n10:40 Comment: The goal kick for Keylor Navas.\n10:42 Comment: While the Bernabéu is still trying to recover from the emotion that Casemiro's shot contained.\n10:51 Comment: It's spectacular, it's a scandal, it's a great goal from Casemiro.\n10:55 Comment: With that academic launch, sensational.\n10:59 Comment: The way he executes it is unbeatable.\n11:2 Comment: Casemiro has many virtues and one is his long-distance shot.\n11:7 Comment: He just proved it.\n11:9 Comment: Not many players have the ability to hit the ball that way.\n11:14 Comment: And Casemiro showed it there and scored the third goal for Real Madrid.\n11:18 Comment: Rodrigo, obviously after a team goal, the Real Madrid bench will have reacted with more joy.\n11:24 Comment: But perhaps given the magnitude of the goal, they will know that they will have gone crazy directly.\n11:28 Comment: Yes, yes, even astonished.\n11:30 Comment: The face, the gesture, the countenance of Morata was like saying what a whistle my teammate just scored.\n11:36 Comment: Great goal from Casemiro, two goals in five minutes to put the game in Real Madrid's hands.\n11:43 Comment: He scored cross in '49, Casemiro just did it in '54.\n11:47 Comment: Under the watchful eye of one of the greatest in the history of this sport, Diego Armando Maradona.\n11:54 Comment: Claim Cristiano Ronaldo by hand.\n11:57 Comment: Esmbra was really close and says no.\n11:59 Comment: Real Madrid's number 7 gets very angry.\n12:2 Comment: The Portuguese and the entire bench have a card.\n12:7 Comment: Hamsik.\n12:11 Comment: Insigne, ball to the far post, looking for José Callejón's unmarking that is not enough for him.\n12:17 Comment: Goalkeeper kick and take advantage of the pause for the entire stadium to adhere to Cristiano Ronaldo's claim.\n12:23 Comment: This is the action, Raúl.\n12:24 Comment: The handball is very clear and the referee has given Napoli the opportunity to approach and a new diagonal from Callejón.\n12:30 Comment: Luckily the ball went out but I think it was a handball, maybe not yellow, but I think the ball was for Real Madrid.\n12:38 Comment: The issue is also that the player who is involved in this action is Prydzielinski, who is the only one cautioned by Naples.\n12:47 Comment: It seems like a good idea to me, but I wouldn't have drawn the second card either.\n12:54 Comment:  Luka modric.\n12:59 Comment: Ramos' opening, Marcelo's advantage, Isai can't stop him.\n13:3 Comment: Firstly Benzema for Ronaldo who is shaping up, more for Ronaldo who wants to hit him, no.\n13:8 Comment: The Naples defender managed to get the ball in.\n13:11 Comment: Try to control it, Pensiñe, what a good ball for Mertens.\n13:14 Comment: The control is fantasy, Mertens is still inside the area, Ramos covers it, Navas has to come out, no.\n13:20 Comment: He didn't arrive in time, Keylor put Sergio Ramos' leg in the action that was invalidated due to a foul by Edric Mertens.\n13:26 Comment: Shooting, now decide with Keylor Navas because he was interpreting that ball from the technical area, which belonged to the goalkeeper.\n13:33 Comment: We see the action repeated, the control is spectacular on Mertens' part.\n13:37 Comment: It's very dangerous, it wasn't easy and I think that Sergio in the end, with his doubts, did his best, trying to clear things up and thus avoid the danger.\n13:50 Comment: Real Madrid leaves from the left, Benzema again.\n13:54 Comment: Benzema goes inside, he wanted to connect with Ronaldo, Koulibaly is attentive, Hamsik is left for Naples.\n14:8 Comment: Recovery of the author of the third goal against Lorenzo Insigne.\n14:13 Comment: Ronaldo was offside and Ronaldo himself knew it.\n14:16 Comment: In fact it seems that the Mosqueo has nothing to do with the offside signal, but with the fact that Benzema gave him the ball.\n14:23 Comment: Yes, yes, yes, quite clear too.\n14:25 Comment: There we see it repeated, Ronaldo's situation left no doubt, he did not want to participate in the play, but that pass from Karim Benzema ended up reaching him.\n14:38 Comment: It's almost game time at the Santiago Bernabéu.\n14:42 Comment: Napoli trying to react after Real Madrid's brilliant start after the break.\n14:54 Comment: Manio Brando with an incredible Aguara temper.\n14:57 Comment: Aguara joins forces and is missing from the front, yes.\n15:1 Comment: There the referee indicates that he also warns Marcelo Vieira.\n15:5 Comment: He is a good dead ball option for Naples after an action in which he moved with a package to Madudi and Aguara.\n15:14 Comment: Spectacular, Marcelo's entry is very strong.\n15:17 Comment: Yes, he is strong and maybe there could be a yellow card.\n15:21 Comment: We are seeing a slightly different Naples, also with parsimony and knowing how to touch the ball when Real Madrid is behind.\n15:28 Comment: Knowing how to move the ball and finding space.\n15:32 Comment: I think they are a very complete team, that when they have the ball in possession, the other team retreats, they have the capacity to create danger.\n15:40 Comment: And on the counterattack we have already seen it, they are capable of creating two or three passes and presenting themselves in the opposing area.\n15:47 Comment: Two players close to the ball.\n15:49 Comment: Left-handed profile for Fauzi Goulam and possibility of hitting with the right for Dries Mertens.\n15:59 Comment: Locate the Damires Comina barrier.\n16:2 Comment: He is very aware of the movements that may occur there, since Callejón and Hamsik are embedded in the barrier.\n16:9 Comment: Goulam hits it high, Fauzi Goulam's shot is full of intention.\n16:13 Comment: Keylor Navas will kick off the goal.\n16:21 Comment: Real Madrid comes out from the left, it's Marcelo.\n16:29 Comment: Sergio Ramos assures at the back.\n16:33 Comment: Navas opens to the right, Goulam wins with a header, Napoli recovers, Insigne starts from the left sector.\n16:39 Comment: Insigne puts it for Hamsik, but it doesn't arrive.\n16:41 Comment: The ball was too long for the Slovak international.\n16:45 Comment: Goal kick again for Real Madrid.\n16:52 Comment: We see that Napoli is trying to put pressure and force Real Madrid to play long.\n16:59 Comment: Raúl Albiol wins by the head.\n17:2 Comment: Casemiro also puts his head in.\n17:5 Comment: The throw-in is for Napoli who are seeing how that high pressure takes effect in the last minutes.\n17:11 Comment: Diaguara's mistake, he still keeps the ball in his possession.\n17:16 Comment: Cañito de Zielinski combining with Callejón.\n17:19 Comment: Alley to the center for Hamsik, Benzema took a tremendous hit in Hamsik's attempt to put his body in and protect the ball.\n17:25 Comment: All fortuitous, but the blow was taken by the cloud of Real Madrid.\n17:28 Comment: Insigne will depress Hamsik, Goulam prepares the center, Goulam puts it in, Carvajal cuts.\n17:34 Comment: Ball rejected for Hamsik again.\n17:36 Comment: Casemiro jumps on him, the last one to touch was the Brazilian from Real Madrid who protests Skomina's decision.\n17:43 Comment: Napoles quickly takes the wing, Insigne is about to catch it.\n17:47 Comment: A tremendously simple, rudimentary action, but it was about to surprise Real Madrid.\n17:52 Comment: Yes, I don't know if Luka Madrid didn't realize it, but thank goodness he didn't control it because it was a very clear chance to score.\n18:6 Comment: Sergio Ramos opening.\n18:9 Comment: Down with Carvajal, press Insigne, Carvajal understood that he had helped himself with his arm.\n18:14 Comment: And a couple of seconds later referee Skomina ends up agreeing with Carvajal.\n18:19 Comment: When Carvajal receives he needs support, he was alone, he needed some movement from James or Benzema, from Cristiano, from the men above to have support.\n18:29 Comment: I was alone and luckily nothing happened.\n18:34 Comment: Insigne cross on the right.\n18:38 Comment: Dani Carvajal ventures into attack, Carvajal changes everything, delivers for Ronaldo.\n18:43 Comment: Ronaldo has short support from Marcelo Vieira.\n18:46 Comment: Ronaldo makes a good move, he sends it inside the small area, the rejection goes to Marcelo who hits it as it comes.\n18:52 Comment: He tried to connect that shot to Bote early, the goal kick for Napoli.\n18:57 Comment: Now close to 65 Rodrigo and at the moment no changes are foreseen in the very very very short term.\n19:3 Comment: There are players who warm up but you don't notice much more.\n19:6 Comment: Yes, well, while Sarri has sent almost everyone to warm up at Real Madrid, those three men that I had mentioned to you have been warming up, both Morata, Lucas Vázquez and Isco.\n19:15 Comment: But he is talking a lot now with his assistants and it seems that Isco is now returning to the bench, Kovacic is also coming out, I don't know if Isco is to sit down or to jump onto the pitch.\n19:25 Comment: We remain pending, meanwhile on the pitch the one who appears is Koulibaly to prevent that progress in Real Madrid's attack.\n19:33 Comment: Gulam, Hansik receives, turns, on the right is Callejón, insists on the left with Gulam.\n19:40 Comment: Mertens throws the ball towards the area, Insigne at the front of the area threatening to hit, Zielinski returns, again Insigne who fails to deliver for Mertens.\n19:50 Comment: It goes to Keylor Navas who serves quickly towards Cristiano Ronaldo.\n19:53 Comment: Ball up from Casemiro, what a ball on Karim Benzema's career.\n19:58 Comment: Benzema threatening the viol, steps into the area, Benzema continues, Benzema puts it in front, Ronaldo goes up, Cristiano Ronaldo's shot goes up.\n20:7 Comment: The possibility was lost for Real Madrid after the good combination between Casemiro and Karim Benzema.\n20:14 Comment: Casemiro's pass was very good and well, Karim is being the best in the game with that mobility appearing on the screen.\n20:21 Comment: With his left foot and assisting Cristiano Ronaldo with a great pass, it's a shame that the shot went wide.\n20:29 Comment: But I think that Real Madrid continues with the good line, with the good feelings, that the first half is being superior and now trying to press, trying to recover the ball again in search of that fourth goal.\n20:41 Comment: Modric, who pursues Diaguara.\n20:45 Comment: Ronaldo gave himself to Casemiro, he gets between two, he manages to keep the ball in his possession.\n20:52 Comment: Zidane's team on the right gives a little oxygen.\n20:58 Comment: Breaking inside now James Rodríguez.\n21:2 Comment: Good ball from Modric, beating lines, Marcelo puts it on the penalty spot.\n21:7 Comment: Clear Koulibaly, second attempt for Marcelo.\n21:10 Comment: Benzema, leave Benzema for Casemiro so he can cheer up again.\n21:14 Comment: Casemiro, diverted.\n21:17 Comment: Once again Casemiro threatening from outside the area.\n21:21 Comment: The Brazilian's shot went wide with respect to Pepe Reina's frame.\n21:26 Comment: I asked Pepe Reina for a little more intensity when it came to defending, because he played the goalkeeper who the Real Madrid players couldn't shoot with that ease.\n21:34 Comment: Having already scored a goal, Casemiro gave him the opportunity to shoot again and it seemed that the defenders were not coming out to cover, so it is normal that Pepe has given them a voice to be more attentive to the next play.\n21:55 Comment: Ball up from Keylor Navas.\n21:58 Comment: Recover Diaguara.\n21:59 Comment: Diaguara looking for Callejón, good ball, Callejón can reach him, left behind.\n22:3 Comment: Up, up Dries Mertens' shot, Napoli just stopped it.\n22:8 Comment: Very clear, ball up from Dries Mertens, Real Madrid has just been saved, Raúl.\n22:14 Comment: He has just been saved, we have not said that Callejón was going to be looking for Sergio Ramos and Marcelo's back again and again.\n22:21 Comment: Marcelo was not well positioned in this play and he knew how to look for Callejón's back.\n22:25 Comment: Marcelo was not well positioned in this play and he knew how to look for Sergio's back.\n22:30 Comment: He left a great ball for Mertens and well, luckily it wasn't right, but Napoli's second goal was very close.\n22:38 Comment: Naples just stopped it, with that action that José Callejón and Dries Mertens wove.\n22:47 Comment: High shot from the Belgian attacker, in the best opportunity, in the best approach for Naples in the entire second half.\n22:56 Comment: This is the response of Real Madrid-Carvajal, the far post puts it, Benzema doesn't arrive, James wants it.\n23:2 Comment: The action is invalidated due to lack, Rodrigo.\n23:5 Comment: Yes, it's missing, by the way, Pepe is getting ready to jump onto the field.\n23:10 Comment: We are waiting to see if it is due to a player's injury or directly to try to put some more refreshment in the center of Real Madrid's defense.\n23:18 Comment: Well, ready to enter Pepe, I ask you Raúl, if you give any possibility to a hypothetical change of system.\n23:27 Comment: I say this because otherwise we would be talking about taking out a center back to put in another.\n23:30 Comment: I don't know, at the moment I haven't really noticed that any player had problems, but hey, let's wait a little.\n23:36 Comment: It is possible, Real Madrid has already played with a three-man defense on several occasions this season.\n23:41 Comment: Let's wait a...\n23:43 Comment: I think, Raúl, I think from what I'm guessing to the fourth referee that it's going to be Ramos.\n23:48 Comment: Well, I think that Ramos could have hurt himself in the play of the first half and possibly after 70 minutes he might be a little tired and have asked for a change.\n24:1 Comment: I think the best thing is, the season is still long, the second leg is in 15 days.\n24:6 Comment: I think Sergio is very important for the team.\n24:36 Comment: Short Mertens, Aguara for Marek Hamsik, Insigne runs on the left, Goulam is accompanying him in attack.\n24:44 Comment: Insigne, ball for Mertens.\n24:47 Comment: Keylor Navas's departure was excellent.\n24:50 Comment: Mertens once again threatening Real Madrid.\n24:52 Comment: The truth is that they are giving, Napoli is a very good impression and they are very dangerous.\n24:57 Comment: At any moment we are seeing that in the last three minutes they have already had two very clear scoring chances as well.\n25:2 Comment: A very dynamic match, with a lot of intensity and we are going to see the change.\n25:8 Comment: Sergio Ramos must have some physical problem and Pepe is going to enter the field.\n25:13 Comment: Well there it is, Sergio Ramos takes off the captain's armband, gives it to him and leaves it to Marcelo.\n25:19 Comment: Also by the way, Karim Benzema has approached the bench right now to receive, so that they can put a reflex reflex on his left instep.\n25:28 Comment: Some blow must have also occurred and there is the change, Sergio Ramos leaves and Pepe enters.\n25:40 Comment: This is the ovation for Pepe, the Real Madrid center back who comes in replacing Ramos in the first substitution of the game.\n25:47 Comment: We took the opportunity to recover from the incident in the first half in which Ramos got hurt.\n25:51 Comment: We don't know if there is a direct cause-and-effect relationship between this and the change that we just saw, that just occurred, but it could be.\n25:59 Comment: It could be, I think that in the end it has been accumulating after so many minutes and in the end Sergio Ramos has resisted for many minutes, 70, and playing at a good level.\n26:10 Comment: But I think he realized in the last few minutes that he couldn't continue or he could harm himself a little more and it would be an even more serious attack.\n26:21 Comment: Pepe's first intervention with that vertical ball that Hamsik ends up intercepting.\n26:27 Comment: Insigne again looking for the back of the defense. Alley inside the first area. Alley, quick to cut Rafael Varane.\n26:35 Comment: José Callejón insists, adding Isai to the attack.\n26:41 Comment: Evolution of Callejón on the international side for Albania.\n26:51 Comment: Insigne Delivery for Callejón. Insigne Again.\n26:56 Comment: He manages to recover Casemiro for Real Madrid, who now want to mount a counterattack.\n27:1 Comment: Insigne does not allow it, he recovers against Casemiro. Insigne on the front. Insigne, up.\n27:6 Comment: Lorenzo Insigne's shot goes up. It seemed like he didn't even have room to arm his leg.\n27:11 Comment: But he has space, he looks for it and as we have seen another dangerous arrival.\n27:15 Comment: But the truth is that he came out to put pressure on him well and the shot was not easy at all.\n27:20 Comment: In all this they continue to prepare for possible substitutions at Real Madrid. Isco, Morata and Lucas Vázquez.\n27:32 Comment: Goulam wins with a header. Carvajal keeps it. Carvajal in the center for Kroos who plays first.\n27:39 Comment: Ronaldo. Marcelo had doubled him. Marcelo facing. He can put in the center.\n27:45 Comment: He has the support behind Kroos. There is the German shaping up. Good ball for James.\n27:51 Comment: Pepe Reina covered it. The Naples goalkeeper kept it after a very good offensive action by Real Madrid.\n27:58 Comment: James Rodríguez had it. Very good combination. What a great pass from Kroos.\n28:2 Comment: Great movement by James without the ball. And it's a shame that Pepe covered it well in the definition and couldn't overcome it.\n28:16 Comment: Insigne. Iaguara hides her. Casemiro had laid her on him.\n28:24 Comment: Mertens unchecks. They look for him with that long delivery. Situation controlled by Pepe.\n28:30 Comment: Rework the offensive action of Mauricio Sarri's team. Zielinski.\n28:37 Comment: Hamsik. Insigne. Goulam doubled him. Insigne stops. Ball for Hamsik.\n28:44 Comment: Hamsik looks once again for José Callejón. He had slipped away during the change of direction.\n28:50 Comment: The attacker Demotril. And hence the action ends in nothing. The goal kick for Keylor Navas.\n28:56 Comment: And to all this there is movement in the technical area. In both in fact.\n29:1 Comment: Yes, the first change in Naples. The man who has that yellow card is going to leave. Piotr Zielinski from the field of play.\n29:8 Comment: Alando is going to come in.

    "summary": "In a thrilling UEFA Champions League encounter at the Santiago Bernabéu, Real Madrid emerged victorious with a 3-1 win over Napoli in a game that was replete with exhilarating football and high stakes. The match presented a display of aggressive tactics, remarkable goals, and intense moments that captivated fans from the first whistle to the last.\n\nThe first half of the match began with Real Madrid asserting their dominance early on. Real Madrid brought a palpable intensity from the outset, pressing high and stretching the Napoli defense with their relentless attacks. Cristiano Ronaldo was at the heart of these early incursions, darting down the left wing and connecting well with Karim Benzema.\n\nNapoli, however, demonstrated their own predatory instincts. Despite Real Madrid's early pressure, it was the Italian team who opened the scoring. In the 7th minute, Napoli's Lorenzo Insigne capitalized on a defensive oversight by Real Madrid. Marek Hamsik's insightful deep pass found Insigne, who spotting Keylor Navas off his line, unleashed a masterful first-time strike from considerable distance. The shot was both powerful and precise, curling into the net to stun the Bernabéu faithful and give Napoli a 1-0 lead.\n\nThe goal shocked Real Madrid into a more vigorous response. The home side's reaction was almost immediate. They continued to attack with fervor, and the equalizer came in the 18th minute. Dani Carvajal's exquisite cross from the right, delivered with the outside of his boot, found Benzema who headed clinically past Pepe Reina. It was a well-worked move, initiated by a series of intricate passes and movements that left Napoli's defense fragmented. The French striker's goal not only leveled the score but also invigorated Real Madrid, who began to dominate possession and create more scoring opportunities.\n\nThroughout the rest of the first half, both teams had their spells of possession and attacking threat. For Real Madrid, the midfield trio of Luka Modric, Casemiro, and Toni Kroos commanded the center of the park, providing a steady supply of passes to the forwards. Ronaldo, always a menace, continued to probe Napoli's defensive line, combining deftly with Benzema and James Rodríguez. On the other hand, Napoli sought to exploit their speed on the counter-attack, with Insigne and José Callejón tirelessly working to stretch Real Madrid's backline.\n\nThe second half mirrored the intensity of the first, with both teams looking to seize control. Real Madrid started the half with renewed vigor and took the lead in the 48th minute. After winning possession back quickly, Ronaldo superbly maneuvered past his marker and found space on the right wing. Lifting his head, he spotted the late run of Kroos and delivered a pinpoint pass. Kroos met it with the inside of his foot, placing the ball with precision into the bottom corner of the net, leaving Reina no chance and making it 2-1 in favor of the host.\n\nNapoli seemed shell-shocked by this sudden shift and struggled to regain their footing. Real Madrid kept up the pressure and in the 54th minute, Casemiro scored an absolute screamer. As Napoli's defense failed to clear their lines adequately, the ball sat up invitingly for the Brazilian midfielder, who let fly with a powerful volley from outside the area. The ball swerved magnificently and arrowed into the top corner, beyond the reach of a flailing Pepe Reina. This sensational goal, one of Casemiro's finest strikes, extended Real Madrid's lead to 3-1 and showcased their high-intensity attacking brand of football.\n\nDespite being down, Napoli did not relent. They continued to press forward, creating a few threatening moments of their own. Dries Mertens and Insigne, in particular, were central to these efforts, attempting to breach Real Madrid's defense with quick passing and sharp movements. In the 63rd minute, Mertens had a golden opportunity but failed to capitalize, sending his shot over the bar from close range. Insigne also had his moment of menace, curling a shot just high of the target.\n\nAs the match approached its final stages, both managers looked to their benches to alter the dynamics. For Real Madrid, James Rodríguez made way for Lucas Vázquez, injecting fresh legs and pace into the right flank. Karim Benzema, who had played an integral part in dismantling Napoli's defense, was replaced by Álvaro Morata. Sergio Ramos, who had a commanding presence at the back but seemed to be laboring, was substituted by Pepe. These changes aimed to maintain Real Madrid's rhythm and prevent any late comebacks by Napoli.\n\nNapoli made changes too, with manager Maurizio Sarri bringing on Allan for Zielinski in midfield and later replacing their captain Hamsik with Arkadiusz Milik. The introduction of Milik added a focal point to Napoli's attack, and he almost made an immediate impact, lurking menacingly in the box and coming close to connecting with a few crosses.\n\nThe latter part of the match saw Real Madrid adopting a more controlled approach, focusing on retaining possession and managing the tempo of the game. They continued to occasionally threaten, particularly with quick counter-attacks orchestrated by the likes of Modric and Kroos. The midfield maestros kept the ball moving, ensuring that Napoli had little opportunity to regroup and organize any sustained attacks.\n\nNapoli, to their credit, continued to fight diligently. Callejón had a goal disallowed for offside and managed to create a couple of half-chances, but Real Madrid’s defense held firm. Pepe slotted in seamlessly, bringing his experience to bear in thwarting Napoli's offensive forays.\n\nIn the end, Real Madrid's superior quality and clinical finishing made the difference. Their ability to transition swiftly from defense to attack and exploit space with precision passing was too much for Napoli to handle. The match culminated in a 3-1 victory for the Spanish giants, providing them a significant advantage heading into the second leg in Naples.\n\nThe final whistle acknowledged a commanding performance by Real Madrid, who despite a shock early goal and some nervy moments, showcased why they are a force to be reckoned with in European football. The Bernabéu faithful roared their approval, appreciating the relentless drive and passion displayed by their team. Real Madrid now looks ahead with confidence, knowing that the victory has set a favorable foundation for continuing their Champions League campaign."
