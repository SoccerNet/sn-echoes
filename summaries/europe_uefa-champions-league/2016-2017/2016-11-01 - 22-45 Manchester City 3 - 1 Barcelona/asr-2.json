Wolf.\n9:15 Comment: Yes, what happens is that he was at a distance that allows him that warning, if it arrives\n9:19 Comment: To be much closer, that is, one stick closer, I would have made the typical planchón.\n9:25 Comment: Now Casai didn't say one more thing to Fernandinho because he gives you a yellow card, it's not going to happen\n9:29 Comment: The next minute Fernandinho makes the foul, right?\n9:32 Comment: There's Messi and Neymar.\n9:34 Comment: Look where the defensive line is, let's see how Leo is going to calculate how he puts the\n9:38 Comment: ball to stop.\n9:39 Comment: He puts it precisely, but he appears protecting and guarding that ball that was going by\n9:44 Comment: Back line, Willy Caballero, ball again for City.\n9:47 Comment: Very complicated play, there Suárez starting from a standing start, although for Messi maybe nothing\n9:52 Comment: It may be too complicated, but to measure that unmarking movement starting from a standing position, frankly\n9:57 Comment:  difficult.\n9:58 Comment: Leo can do better.\n9:59 Comment: The ball is green again, Sterling recovers it up top, Neymar comes to Barça, stung by the\n10:3 Comment: area, Luis Suárez is running, Neymar puts it, penalty spot, Kolarov appears, he cuts\n10:7 Comment: The server, the ball that came to Leo, Messi plays the ball higher, comes the\n10:10 Comment: Kun, Kun starts ahead of Mascherano and Diñe, he's going to win the game against the Argentine.\n10:13 Comment: From the left comes Brunette, look how Sterling is doing, how he's doing, there's Sterling,\n10:17 Comment: Sterling can shovel.\n10:18 Comment: And Casai says that the cheer rises, yellow for the English.\n10:23 Comment: Yes, yes, yellow, the public standing protesting the referee, in the end the card for Sterling,\n10:31 Comment: Forgiving another Barça player again.\n10:33 Comment: Let's see how he interprets it, he takes the ball away from Kiti and he was ready to jump, yes,\n10:40 Comment: Yes, yes, it seemed very clear to me, it didn't even seem like a penalty to me live.\n10:44 Comment: But a Kiti is late there.\n10:46 Comment: Yes, but look at what Sterling does, he automatically throws himself like in the previous one, then the referee\n10:52 Comment: He pointed it out for that, wow.\n10:54 Comment: Because it's staged for you, but for you it's a penalty or not.\n10:56 Comment: I put my leg on him, but he goes to look for the fall, then the referee has detected\n11:0 Comment: He looked for the penalty.\n11:2 Comment: If you don't look for the penalty, it's automatically called.\n11:5 Comment: Well look, listen to the public, because it is widespread, people have seen penalties from\n11:10 Comment: a Kiti.\n11:11 Comment: The feeling is that a Kiti at no time has the option of playing the ball, and a Kiti\n11:17 Comment: puts a fence on Sterling.\n11:19 Comment: He can whistle it perfectly.\n11:20 Comment: From there, we do not have a clear repetition if there is contact or not, but we do not have\n11:24 Comment: a clear repetition.\n11:25 Comment: But there the player does go to the ground, I don't know, the feeling is that a Kiti didn't have any\n11:33 Comment: Option to reach the ball, put a barrier, if it touches Sterling a little, situation\n11:38 Comment: penalty.\n11:39 Comment: Yes, as absurd as it may seem, we will have to see in the rep exactly if there is contact.\n11:44 Comment: It gives the impression in the last one, from behind the goal, let's see if we can see another one\n11:47 Comment: time again.\n11:48 Comment: But it feels like...\n11:49 Comment: Do you know what's going on?\n11:50 Comment: Kiti nails the foot, because he can't reach the ball.\n11:54 Comment: He puts the fence on it.\n11:55 Comment: Yes, but he doesn't lift his foot.\n11:58 Comment: So if you lift your foot and it touches his knee it's automatically a penalty, although\n12:0 Comment: Sterling looked it up for me.\n12:2 Comment: For me it is determined by height.\n12:3 Comment: Exactly, by setting his foot, Sterling does what he has done before, to get the\n12:7 Comment: Card, try to get the card.\n12:9 Comment: There is Luis Suárez against Otamendi, he protested a lot, as Was said, everyone\n12:13 Comment: Manchester City stadium.\n12:14 Comment: He puts his head in Stones, takes it out, prolongs Gundogan, combed and catapulted for Kun\n12:17 Comment: Agüero who plays with the outside, trying to open, plays to the left where he already\n12:20 Comment: Come down now De Bruyne.\n12:21 Comment: De Bruyne plays for Gundogan, the German appears there, he also has Sterling ahead of him\n12:25 Comment: In space, Kun Agüero appears inside, here comes the diagonal, it was an impossible Sterling\n12:30 Comment: Practically standing still, lift the point guard now towards Kun, he recovers well\n12:34 Comment: Luis Suárez controls, plays for André Gómez, ball for Neymar, Neymar chased\n12:38 Comment: For Zabaleta, Clara is missing from the Argentine.\n12:42 Comment: Now Clara Letizat is going to protest, right?\n12:45 Comment: A good play after that penalty that I am right behind the goal\n12:50 Comment: Ter Stegen and the truth is that he could have called it perfectly, I think Barça\n12:55 Comment: He escaped an uncomfortable penalty there.\n12:58 Comment: The only thing I am clear about is that it is not a card, from there we have the advantage of the\n13:3 Comment: repetitions and if we have a good one it is to establish if there is contact or not, what a titi in no\n13:8 Comment: moment he plays the ball and creates a difficulty, a fence in the form of a rigid and nailed leg\n13:13 Comment: to the ground so that Sterling's career has to go the other way.\n13:16 Comment: There the ball plays for Ter Stegen in the six-yard box, André Ter Stegen the German plays\n13:21 Comment: playing for Mascherano, Mascherano holds on to the ball and plays it again for a\n13:25 Comment: titi, protagonist of the play with Sterling who saw the yellow card, not understanding,\n13:30 Comment: Víctor Casay, who had simulated the penalty, plays the ball back for a titi.\n13:34 Comment: What we are seeing in these almost 14 minutes of play is that in counterattack actions\n13:39 Comment: Manchester City is unbalanced, before we saw how Sterling left Digne,\n13:43 Comment: As Kun Agüero also left Digne, in speed it seems like Manchester City\n13:48 Comment: it causes problems or gives problems to Barça, something that is a different proposal than the one\n13:52 Comment: We saw at the Camp Nou where Manchester City sought more touch and control, here\n13:56 Comment: It seems that the idea is withdrawal and counterattack.\n13:59 Comment: And another thing, set a line of four at the back, so Barcelona leaves the three forwards\n14:4 Comment: up and even if they are pressing, they are with the ball up, City is always with\n14:8 Comment: An advantage of at least one, that is a small modification because at the Camp Nou\n14:13 Comment: Sometimes he was left with three in that high pressure.\n14:16 Comment: Well, let's see why the first round match was decided by mistakes.\n14:19 Comment: And for taking advantage of the mistakes in this case, a genius like Leo Messi, let's see\n14:22 Comment: How is the decisive match going now also for, especially for City and it could be\n14:27 Comment: Also for Barça if they get the result, it also accompanies them if they don't win\n14:32 Comment: Today also depending on what happens in the game.\n14:36 Comment: In the other group match at Borussia Park between Borussia Mönchengladbach and\n14:40 Comment: Galaxo's Celtic, Willy Caballero plays the ball there, he does it for Otamendi, you\n14:45 Comment: I also remember that next Monday at 10:30 pm on Antena 3, Guas\n14:48 Comment: Plastic Sea returns with a new premiere chapter.\n14:52 Comment:  I can not wait.\n14:53 Comment: And tomorrow at 10:30 pm on Antena 3, new episode of the season\n14:57 Comment: end of Belbet.\n14:58 Comment: And this Friday at 10 pm the show continues on Antena 3 with a new one\n15:2 Comment: Tu cara gala sounds familiar to me, the most watched on Fridays.\n15:5 Comment: You're not having a problem, Wolf, Your face sounds familiar to me.\n15:8 Comment: Absolutely, I'm always on the lookout for good programs.\n15:12 Comment: It's hard to recognize them when they characterize themselves.\n15:16 Comment:  Is awesome.\n15:17 Comment: And the live voice.\n15:18 Comment: The ball plays there, Diñe comes again, Zabaleta appears, Busquets cuts, recovers\n15:23 Comment: Rakitic, there are more fights, more disputes, more divided balls, both of them are using\n15:27 Comment: also now intensity, Neymar plays the ball and also a lot of concentration for\n15:30 Comment: Go to the disputes, play Neymar, make the change up, look for Kolarov's back now,\n15:35 Comment: He bounces forward, Luis Suárez appears, Kolarov takes a throw-in.\n15:38 Comment: Let's watch the replay.\n15:47 Comment: Now we see up here comrades, followed by the repetition of the most political play\n15:53 Comment: At the moment of the match, which is a long quarter of an hour already in Manchester,\n15:57 Comment: 0-0 at the moment.\n15:59 Comment: Ball for Mascherano, he puts the pass up, looking for Sergi Roberto, in the end it doesn't arrive\n16:4 Comment: Now the La Masía footballer, directly to a goal kick for Caballero.\n16:10 Comment: The change right now, Untiti changes with Mascherano, Untiti is already going to the left\n16:15 Comment: and he goes one on one with Agüero.\n16:18 Comment: Thank you guys, this is Kun's play, Sterling controls Sterling, he gets in\n16:22 Comment: In the area, the ball breaks, Untiti arrives too late.\n16:27 Comment: The ball is closer from what we see, there Silva plays the ball again, Silva\n16:30 Comment: Up for Sterling, it's the copied play, Sterling appears, he has De Burín in him\n16:33 Comment: Back post, Ter Stegen now in front of Kun.\n16:37 Comment: Kun laments because he was, come on, he did very little.\n16:40 Comment: He didn't give him enough strength and the striker lost his advantage.\n16:43 Comment: The truth is that seeing the play now in this image it seemed like a penalty to me in this one\n16:47 Comment: Situation, in this one it did seem like a penalty, but I already say that Sterling is a player\n16:51 Comment: You have to calibrate well because he's like Neymar, he enters the area, how he points at you\n16:54 Comment: The ball, you get the penalty and that's what the referee interpreted, but we do see\n16:59 Comment: This last image, actually there I have to change my opinion unfortunately because\n17:5 Comment: I thought it was Sterling's invention.\n17:8 Comment: There Luis Suárez plays, ball up, Otamendi cuts, ball to Silva, David starts\n17:13 Comment: Silva, plays for De Burín, the Belgian now appears on the left side, already recovered,\n17:18 Comment: De Burín appears, now in front of Busquets, he plays for Silva, triangulates for Kolarov,\n17:22 Comment: Fernandinho appears, closing the quartet, he comes ahead of André Gómez, he plays\n17:26 Comment: The ball is up again for Zabaleta, this one with Sterling, Sterling now in front of Neymar,\n17:30 Comment: He's going to put pressure on him, offload the ball to the Englishman in front of the Brazilian for Otamendi, return\n17:33 Comment: Let's start for City.\n17:34 Comment: Well, we are seeing that right now City is clearly looking for Sterling against Digne,\n17:41 Comment: One for one on this right wing of City, left wing of Barça.\n17:46 Comment: I have seen the vein.\n17:47 Comment: Proof of level also for Sergi Roberto at a defensive level.\n17:50 Comment: There is no doubt, but he is going to have to deal one on one with Kevin De Burín.\n17:55 Comment: Yes, because we often say about the individual quality of Barça's footballers.\n17:59 Comment: In the overflow, but today also their defenses with reinforcements like Digne and Uttiti are\n18:4 Comment: In the same season they have to deal with different players, as Marcos says,\n18:8 Comment: such as Sterling, De Burín or Kun Agüero himself.\n18:11 Comment: Yes, but aid is essential.\n18:13 Comment: If you see that a player has more speed than you, you have to know how to give him the distance,\n18:18 Comment: Observe the area well, that is, don't let it unbalance you.\n18:20 Comment: That's why there is tactical intelligence too.\n18:22 Comment: They are young people like Uttiti and Digne, well prepared, but obviously, as they say\n18:26 Comment: Marcos and also Sergi Roberto, test of level against footballers who are one against\n18:31 Comment: One goes easy and plays the ball to Otamendi.\n18:34 Comment: Otamendi for the wild boar.\n18:36 Comment: We are seeing that the two Barça centre-backs have already changed their profile.\n18:40 Comment: Right now Uttiti is a left-footed central defender, Mascherano is a right-footed central defender.\n18:44 Comment: Barça finishes the plays too quickly.\n18:47 Comment: It's going vertical, there isn't that touch of control, that round ball from one side to the other.\n18:51 Comment: Mature the play, they are looking for verticality, perhaps because the profile of the interiors,\n18:56 Comment: Both Rakitic and André Gómez, whether they are from the race, from the arrival, and that is allowing\n19:0 Comment: Let Manchester City anticipate and go on the counterattack.\n19:3 Comment: Sergi Roberto is getting desperate because he is raising his hand, constantly asking,\n19:6 Comment: But they are not seeing him.\n19:7 Comment: And Rakitic is coming in as a second center half practically so he can serve\n19:11 Comment: the ball together with Busquets.\n19:14 Comment: Ball up again, he wants to play behind Viñe.\n19:17 Comment: In addition, those partnerships that are set up between Kun and Sterling, or between Kun and De Bruyne, or Silva\n19:23 Comment: also appearing, and what they often do is a 2 for 2 or a 3 for 2.\n19:26 Comment: Viñe plays, the ball goes to Ter Stegen in his own area, chased by Silva who always goes\n19:29 Comment: pressure up.\n19:30 Comment: It's a big shot for Mascherano, he's changed his profile as Marcos said.\n19:33 Comment: Ball up for Rakitic, he receives it from behind.\n19:35 Comment: The Croatian is coming, about to lose.\n19:37 Comment: He recovered and there is a lack of sea on the City footballer.\n19:39 Comment: And there will be a card for Rakitic.\n19:41 Comment: And it has arrived for Iván Rakitic.\n19:43 Comment: The first for Barça.\n19:47 Comment: The first for Barça, Sterling actually saw it due to the action in the area\n19:50 Comment: from the Barça team.\n19:52 Comment: And the afternoon there I also completely went to Gundogan.\n19:55 Comment: He shrinks his leg as we see, that is, he doesn't want to hunt

Without a doubt, Barça's first goal was Messi's and\n0:46 Comment: Haaland finds it very difficult for Manchester City in the 10-15 minutes after that Manchester goal\n0:52 Comment: City has a lot of problems recovering the ball to be consistent as a block for\n0:56 Comment: Defending at that moment, Barça had options for a second goal, some of which were clearly wasted\n1:4 Comment: Goal puts City in the game, activates their energy level and makes them recover their emotions\n1:9 Comment: We will see how the duel goes in the second half, both teams have been better on the counterattack\n1:13 Comment: With possession in control the two have gone with energy and intention, here comes the Kun\n1:19 Comment: For Sterling, Sterling... poorly controlled. As I said later, control is bad. Horrible, yes.\n1:26 Comment: But the play is preceded by pressure from Manchester City, as Marcos said\n1:33 Comment: Both teams once again put Guardiola's team in recovering the ball\n1:38 Comment: Teams are better on the counterattack than in possession, they are taking advantage of mistakes very well\n1:43 Comment: On the opposing team in this play, I think it's not Sterling's bad control, it's the pass.\n1:48 Comment: They give it to you so that you finish first and they present it to you so that there is no longer any control to get there\n1:54 Comment: To finish because he was in the race. Let's say he makes a mistake, here comes Kun... My goodness, what Agüero was trying to do.\n2:1 Comment: The other day he scored a great goal from the edge of the area against West Brom, now he tried it a little further away\n2:7 Comment: And also, practically ready, the second half starts with force. I would say that in that one, Sterling's\n2:13 Comment: He is wrong technically due to control, but the primary error is the decision-making process.\n2:18 Comment: First-class finish. Five against seven if we count Ter Stegen and Barcelona have been able to get out of that line.\n2:23 Comment: Let's see. There he wants to play the ball again on the right Leo Messi goes out to put the polarobo\n2:30 Comment: Not the Argentine who is going to execute the ball in front of Sergi Roberto and very close to him\n2:35 Comment: The technical area where Luis Enrique Guardiola is already sitting, Mario warms up for the moment\n2:40 Comment: footballers like Jesús Navas at City and there he plays the ball to a titi who asks for support\n2:47 Comment: With André Gómez there seems to be a slight disconnection between the two Rakitic center midfielders\n2:51 Comment: André Gómez and Sergio Busquets and also the defense when it is pressured and that space\n2:57 Comment: Manchester City's three quarter-finalists, like De Bruyne, Sterling or Silva, win it\n3:3 Comment: Now Otamendi is complaining about the foul against his team. Ball for Barça\n3:10 Comment: The game puts pressure on the entire field, football has changed right now, all of them\n3:18 Comment: Teams already play pressing in the opposite field and the forwards are required to defend\n3:23 Comment: The defenders are required to attack the footballer has to be complete, total defender who defends\n3:31 Comment: Well, he doesn't serve the ball well, he has difficulties, a forward who is very good and defends well\n3:37 Comment: But he doesn't press, he also has difficulties with his team. We're going to see Neymar because it's been done.\n3:42 Comment: He hurt his arm there and it seems like he's also wearing it. Now Leo Messi is going to football.\n3:50 Comment: Played with the ball rolling for Sterling, big Sterling from Viña gives the space for Kun\n3:56 Comment: Ter Stegen backs off, accompanies Bruyne, continues with Agüero, who is now going to fix Leo Messi, go\n4:1 Comment: A duel, ball for Silva, Busquets fouls in favor of Manchester City very close to the balcony\n4:9 Comment: From the frenetic area, the second half started with both teams counterattacking as soon as they had\n4:16 Comment: Space, both teams are very physical players, very good and when there is a little space to\n4:21 Comment: running the game is unlocked. The important thing above all is not to let the players think what they have\n4:27 Comment: So much talent, so there they are trying to take advantage of those mistakes you alluded to and\n4:34 Comment: Above all, to reach the last few meters with the advantage over those stars\n4:39 Comment: Because you know that they can score a goal at any moment. Well, let's see why they are there now\n4:45 Comment: Yes because he went down there to defend her\n4:49 Comment: with the left foot of Bruyne with the right\n4:53 Comment: so that he can play it rolled for his shot from the balcony already with a straight ball\n5:0 Comment: There are a lot of people and we are going to see who it is, he is covering up Ter Stegen, we are going to see who it is because\n5:6 Comment: There is the Belgian, a very populated barrier, a double wall also with the blue ones coming from Bruyne\n5:15 Comment: And Manchester City once again marks Guardiola's team that takes the lead in a crazy match\n5:25 Comment: Great hit, the ball hardly takes any height, it goes like a whip. Ter Stegen gives me the feeling\n5:31 Comment: In front of a populated barrier, the ball does not enter through the square, but there is little visibility\n5:36 Comment: Of a Ter Stegen who doesn't escape from that house. Hey Lugo, what do you think? No, he's been covered up and can't see\n5:42 Comment: The ball comes out automatically and you're already putting your hand out late, look, you're putting your hand out late, it's a foul\n5:48 Comment: Very unstoppable, or very stoppable, but of course you can see it, but it is there, look where everyone is.\n5:53 Comment: Before I launched it, I didn't see anything. I said, right, Guas, that there is a double wall of the\n5:59 Comment: Barça plus another three four other Manchester City footballers but Marcos there is a small step\n6:4 Comment: a feint of a step that Ter Stegen does not take but he swings his body to the right and when\n6:9 Comment: He wants to react, the ball is on him. Yes, he doesn't drive up, he has no field of vision to be able to\n6:15 Comment: Remove your arm if you take a step to the left, despite De Bruyne's hit in that position\n6:22 Comment: It barely takes any height, it's very strong, it's very touched, however it doesn't find the square in theory\n6:28 Comment: There the goalkeeper has his responsibility but let's not detract from the kicker because De Bruyne\n6:33 Comment: He executes really well. The ball doesn't fly, it actually goes with just enough force to overtake\n6:38 Comment: Outside that barrier and win the goal. Wow, how the benches have taken it. Well then\n6:44 Comment: Guardiola wanted to be cautious, he didn't get up from his seat, he didn't want to celebrate because\n6:48 Comment: He knows that Barça is in front of him and you can never do it until they ask for it at the end. This has not happened\n6:54 Comment: It's over, this is not over, the Etihad is happening again but Guardiola said it was a final\n6:59 Comment: For City and it's true, they don't want to get complicated so that goal couldn't come at a better time\n7:4 Comment: Because Borussia continues to win at home in Germany against Glasgow Celtic. Wow\n7:10 Comment: Group, De Bruyne is going to play there. De Bruyne puts the ball, first stoppage and the second Tamendi is ready\n7:17 Comment: To chase a ball. Run, run, yes. It seemed impossible but in the end the corner kick stops\n7:23 Comment: City. It's André Gómez. Yes, well another game has started but I want to see if City is capable\n7:28 Comment: To maintain the line of 3, look for the third because of course against Barcelona it usually hits\n7:34 Comment: In a step back almost all the teams and there we will see what psychological strength they have and\n7:39 Comment: Tactical. That's a good one, let's see what suit he wears, whether as a favorite, or as a bossy team. He puts it there.\n7:45 Comment: Well, Sterling was actually looking and he ate Kun Agüero. Otamendi is saying that he grabbed him\n7:52 Comment: Previously Macerano. They both went to the lemon, both Otamendi and Kun Agüero, meters by\n7:57 Comment: In front of Otamendi, who is the one who is complaining right now about that grab that we are going to see repeated if it happens\n8:2 Comment: Whether it produces or not, Sterling goes with the dagger, putting the ball up. He was ahead. It was offside too.\n8:7 Comment: Otamendi was ahead. That's what he claimed. De Bruyne, de Bruyne, de Bruyne. In the end Busquets cut.\n8:14 Comment: Sterling appeared so that there was another play for City. Busquets falls, he comes from the ground\n8:19 Comment: Playing and Sterling is stung by fouls. For retention. And he has a yellow card and Waus is going to ask him for a little calm.\n8:28 Comment: It's a good thing he didn't throw the ball. If he threw it expectantly in anger, anything would have happened to him.\n8:35 Comment: The referee is reprimanding him. We must remember that Sterling has a yellow card.\n8:41 Comment: Yes, the first of the game.\n8:44 Comment: I said it right in the live narration. It has yellow cardboard. The ball is scored again by Stones.\n8:48 Comment: Plays for Kolarov. Prevents him from leaving. Says yes. The assistant clearly indicating that he was on the same line.\n8:55 Comment: That are interior areas of the field. Play the ball again. Cunha-Güero appears. There is a dispute with Sergi Roberto.\n9:1 Comment: The winner is Rakitic. He plays for Busquets. This one goes to André Gómez. Opening for Digne. Digne leads.\n9:7 Comment: The Frenchman appears. He plays a little higher. Ball for Neymar. The Brazilian is also starting to activate now.\n9:12 Comment: He plays and plays. For now he holds the ball. Manchester City is also retreating intensively now.\n9:17 Comment: Everyone behind the ball except Cunha-Güero. Ball for a marmoset. A marmoset with André Gómez.\n9:22 Comment: André Gómez wants to play it. At the moment he doesn't want to raffle the ball given the speed and danger of the citizen soccer players.\n9:28 Comment: Play the ball for Leo Messi. Luis Enrique's team now attacks. Silva recovers. Corejedo says it's a foul.\n9:35 Comment: At the start with his left arm he seems to be holding him.\n9:40 Comment: Corejedo, it's a foul. Ball for FC Barcelona.\n9:42 Comment: The ball for Messi depends on him, right? Let there be no mess, let there be calm and let Barça wake up a little red.\n9:49 Comment: Now he receives. He puts on the stripes. He plays for Neymar. Neymar between the lines. My God, what Neymar was trying to do.\n9:55 Comment: André Gómez plays. He attacks or leaves it. What ball has he left for Leo Messi?\n9:58 Comment: Hit the ball! Second suit!\n10:0 Comment:  No no no.\n10:1 Comment: What Lobo Carrasco Leo Messi has tried.\n10:3 Comment: Yes, because he came from behind to finish. I think it was Rakitic.\n10:7 Comment: And it was a good ball. If he left it hanging in the air he probably could have made contact.\n10:13 Comment: But he didn't hit well. We see it there.\n10:15 Comment: The first thing Guardiola says in a pre-match talk, in the first pre-match talk, is that after 1-0, 2-0.\n10:22 Comment: After 2-0, 3-0. There is no one to take a step back.\n10:26 Comment: He may allow it in the 85th minute, but if he sees that a player takes a step back he changes it.\n10:31 Comment: That's what Guardiola says to his players in the first talk at every moment of the game.\n10:37 Comment: Now it's a test of mentality. Barça is in front with three great players up front.\n10:42 Comment: City is 2-1, but it cannot take a step back if it goes according to the style and what the pattern dictates.\n10:47 Comment: One thing is what the boss orders and another thing is what the players execute.\n10:50 Comment: Here comes De Bruyne. And he calls a foul on Víctor Casay there with Busquets.\n10:55 Comment: I was asking for it too. Respite from Bruyne.\n11:1 Comment: Yes, he is a player who knows how to look for one-on-one as well.\n11:6 Comment: And look, we heard Lobo, Hey You.\n11:12 Comment: Come on, come on, come on!\n11:20 Comment: He's going to put Bruyne's foul on Silva.\n11:24 Comment: There it is. Go ahead, the Spanish puts it. Good thread.\n11:29 Comment: Kun Agüero's header! Why did he just go to Ter Stegen's right.\n11:36 Comment: Kun's momentum is very good. We have to remember the statistics we said before starting the game.\n11:41 Comment: Out of every ten aerial balls, Kun only wins one. There, in the dispute with Mascherano, one of his height Kun wins.\n11:49 Comment: To play ball again.\n11:51 Comment: At the moment he hasn't scored, but how important Kun is in this dispute.\n11:54 Comment: And now we are going to see now the AVE Guas also where the changes of the two teams are going to happen.\n11:59 Comment: Because obviously we are seeing football where a lot is being put in by both of us.\n12:5 Comment: Looking for the rival's mistake, fast-paced, dizzying. Always looking for speed and back.\n12:11 Comment: Do a lot of damage, at times very direct, high speed.\n12:17 Comment: And let's see, well there we see one of the first changes.\n12:20 Comment: It seems that Fernando is prepared to try to contain a little, now obviously the change.\n12:28 Comment: It does fit with the result for Manchester City, which leads by 2 to 1.\n12:32 Comment: He turned around Leo Messi's first goal.\n12:34 Comment: Play Zabaleta.\n12:35 Comment: Given how Zabaleta's condition is.\n12:38 Comment: He comes back from injury, he's going to play for an hour.\n12:41 Comment: We have your answer.\n12:42 Comment: City again. Another recovery, another counterattack.\n12:45 Comment: And what a time of play. Play with Agüero. Ball in there.\n12:50 Comment: The triangulation that doesn't work out. It tries to steal with everything.\n12:54 Comment: Otamendi in the end replaced Isaque on the wing for Manchester City. He asks Bruyne for a little more intensity.\n13:0 Comment: The current football, minute 57, Barça is playing in their own area and Otamendi is putting pressure on Barça.\n13:7 Comment: The demand for the footballer is maximum.\n13:9 Comment: City is in the same script and that is good, it is essential to try to suffocate, triangulate Barcelona when the ball is released.\n13:17 Comment: The other day Fernando played because Sañá and Zabaleta himself were obviously not out on that right side.\n13:23 Comment: But he wasn't entirely a side against West Brom.\n13:27 Comment: At times it was a defense of three with Stones, with Otamendi, also with Kolarov.\n13:33 Comment: And Fernando a bit there between two waters, linking with the center of the field, but not lateral.\n13:38 Comment: A good right back is Pablo Maffeo, who he has in the youth team, Guardiola already knows.\n13:44 Comment: He was City's best player in the Cup, although Mourinho won.\n13:48 Comment: But he is a kid from the Spanish youth team, really a diamond, which Pep knows even though he is very young.\n13:54 Comment: Fernando is ready and we assume it's because of Fernandinho.\n13:59 Comment: Let's see, play the ball.\n14:1 Comment: And be careful, huh.\n14:3 Comment: Kolarov, yellow.\n14:6 Comment: By throwing the ball, I mean by throwing the ball...\n14:9 Comment: No, it hinders you.\n14:10 Comment: Of course, so it doesn't come out quickly.\n14:12 Comment: And let's see if...\n14:14 Comment: Let's see him, look, he dribbles and goes for it and stops it.\n14:18 Comment: The change is Fernandinho.\n14:20 Comment: Etihad rises to him in this first change for Pep Guardiola.\n14:26 Comment: Fernandinho for Fernando.\n14:29 Comment: In theory it has to be some physical discomfort on Fernandinho's part because he is a very important player in this Manchester City team.\n14:35 Comment: As far as positional matters are concerned, they are both defensive midfielders, with Fernandinho having more quality than Fernando.\n14:40 Comment: Fernando is usually a player who does not hit lines in the pass, but rather delivers easily.\n14:44 Comment: Defensively, a little tougher than Fernandinho in tackling and anticipation, also in one-on-one and in contact.\n14:51 Comment: That's why they can play together, obviously, because they are complementary.\n14:53 Comment: One has more of something than the other and vice versa.\n14:57 Comment: There's Mascherano playing.\n14:58 Comment: Mascherano puts the space in the corridor there for Sergi Roberto who now wins the ball by lifting the ball.\n15:3 Comment: In front of Kolarov who already has a yellow card, Fernando, who has just joined, is chasing him.\n15:6 Comment: Ball there for Leo Messi.\n15:8 Comment: Messi of load for André Gómez, of first Kevin for Luis Suárez.\n15:11 Comment: Luis Suárez's ball stays.\n15:12 Comment: The gunman was armed!\n15:14 Comment: Catch Willy Caballero.\n15:16 Comment: Neymar lacked that opening touch. He was completely alone.\n15:19 Comment: He got involved because he couldn't get the shot off.\n15:22 Comment: Then he plays the ball from outside to Neymar who arrives on the run and could have even finished first.\n15:27 Comment: Arda Turan has also been repaired at Barça.\n15:31 Comment: Whatever returns is also another of those who returns.\n15:34 Comment: There was talk that perhaps today he would take the place of Iniesta who is injured.\n15:40 Comment: In the end it was André Gómez.\n15:42 Comment: And it's going to come out...\n15:45 Comment: Ivan Rakitic, yes.\n15:47 Comment: Rakitic with Barça, or As, which we have already said in the previous one but we remember it again, has some casualties.\n15:52 Comment: If I look further afield, Maíra also injured Jordi Alba.\n15:54 Comment: Especially on defense.\n15:55 Comment: To Tigre Huelde and especially in defense as you say, also Piqué.\n15:58 Comment: So let's see.\n15:59 Comment: There comes the change, Was.\n16:2 Comment: The Turkish Arda Turan has already entered for Ivan Rakitic.\n16:6 Comment: It will surely give Barça more ball control, more play in reduced space.\n16:10 Comment: More spaces to take advantage of for the strikers, for Messi and Neymar, and let Arda be the one to build.\n16:16 Comment: Leaving both Neymar and Messi higher up, more advanced.\n16:20 Comment: And they do have the obligation to come so much, because before with Rakitic and André Gómez, Barça lacked a helm, a builder, someone who could play good positional games in Atal.\n16:30 Comment: Luis Suárez presses, the ball is there for Willy Caballero.\n16:32 Comment: He wants to play it, the Argentine does.\n16:35 Comment: Up looking for Sterling, close to the band, so close that the money went in front of Diñe.\n16:39 Comment: Luis Enrique's team is going to take out.\n16:41 Comment: And he has also made a change now like Pep Guardiola at the 62nd moment of the match live on Antena 3.\n16:47 Comment: With the best football with the Champions League.\n16:49 Comment: Mascherano plays.\n16:50 Comment: Mascherano has Sergi Roberto on the right.\n16:52 Comment: Remember that also this Friday at 10 pm on Antena 3.\n16:56 Comment: We will enjoy great performances on Tu Cara Me Suena, the most watched on Fridays.\n17:0 Comment: Tomorrow at 10:30 pm on Antena 3.\n17:2 Comment: We will live the outcome or we will continue to live the outcome of Vélvez with a new chapter of the final season.\n17:8 Comment: And don't forget that next Monday at 10:30 on Antena 3, a great series also like Mar de

to the right.\n17:33 Comment: Unload for Kolarov on the left.\n17:35 Comment: Ahhh!\n17:36 Comment: De Bruyne is not coming!\n17:37 Comment: And at the end the goal kick.\n17:41 Comment: It's hard for nothing to have happened.\n17:43 Comment: It seemed like he signaled a goal kick but in the end Casaira gave a corner.\n17:47 Comment: What an opportunity for City!\n17:49 Comment: How fast Manchester City is running on the counterattack!\n17:52 Comment: Both teams are very good at taking advantage of space, they do it very well.\n17:56 Comment: Whistle the construction dividing, good Kolarov running and passing.\n18:0 Comment: There have already been three near-shot situations in Manchester City's small area.\n18:5 Comment: De Bruyne nails his leg before fully stretching it, look.\n18:9 Comment: How good she is.\n18:10 Comment: Oh, yes, yes, he almost reached the ball.\n18:13 Comment: However, practically with his soul, he rejects a marmoset and that's why he takes a corner.\n18:17 Comment: De Bruyne perhaps lacked a little height.\n18:19 Comment: Yes, in launching, that's why he says it.\n18:21 Comment: Throw the ball, whistle comes.\n18:22 Comment: He whistles from the side of the area, he has De Bruyne.\n18:24 Comment: The 2 for 2 now in front of Diñi and also Neymar who comes to put his boot in.\n18:28 Comment: On the verge of recovery, Sterling takes control.\n18:31 Comment: He plays for Gundogan.\n18:33 Comment: Gundogan with Jabaleta.\n18:35 Comment: Jabaleta delays for Willy Caballero.\n18:37 Comment: It goes for him like a spear and like an arrow now Neymar too.\n18:40 Comment: The Argentine takes it out of the way in front of the Brazilian,\n18:42 Comment: A marmoset goes on the Frenchman's back and leaves her dead.\n18:45 Comment: Gundogan appears with everything, he raises the leather, he also appears on the right.\n18:48 Comment: How well Kun has punctured, he put his boot into Diñi but not completely.\n18:51 Comment: Sterling comes from the side of the area, he is going to invent, he makes a bicycle wishing Andrés Gómez help.\n18:55 Comment: Ball for Whistling.\n18:56 Comment: Whistle against Andrés Gómez, hold on there among several without space.\n19:0 Comment: Sterling has looked for it, Barça cuts it, Busquets leaves.\n19:2 Comment: The counterattack is coming for Luis Suárez, he plays for Adalatunan.\n19:5 Comment: The Turk starts, passes it behind, sets Stones.\n19:8 Comment: Stones puts the Turk's body in a lower gravity and also has a better touch.\n19:11 Comment: But it comes with two Stones, Arda falls asleep, about to steal.\n19:14 Comment: He gets a pass up there for Barça.\n19:16 Comment: Luis Suárez is coming, Luis Suárez what a prick, Luis Suárez continues.\n19:20 Comment: The entrance for Andrés Gómez.\n19:22 Comment: Goal to the hole.\n19:27 Comment: My mother.\n19:28 Comment: The quality of the Stones.\n19:30 Comment: And from there, the quality of Luis Suárez.\n19:32 Comment: Caño and a perfect pass, a take and put it.\n19:35 Comment: And Andrés Gómez misses the ball a little high, but be careful, it's not poorly executed at all.\n19:40 Comment: The party does not allow error.\n19:42 Comment: The team that fails has a chance against it.\n19:44 Comment: It seemed like a goal, it seemed like a clear goal from Andrés Gómez.\n19:47 Comment: Coming in a play that Luis Suárez created with a pipe that reminded me of the one at the Parc des Princes against PSG.\n19:52 Comment: Yes, yes, it came, it evoked that in us, yes, true.\n19:55 Comment: Luis Suárez plays there.\n19:57 Comment: In front

match.\n20:12 Comment: He has seen it inside because he has put it in the place where it hurts the goalkeeper the most in that case.\n20:17 Comment: I thought he was going to be on the other side, he didn't even have time to try to make this team.\n20:21 Comment: Notice that the key is not in what the two teams are capable of building, it is in what they are capable of stealing.\n20:27 Comment: As soon as they steal, as soon as the opponent makes a mistake, they go for goal with many players.\n20:32 Comment: It's a fast-paced game.\n20:34 Comment: Hey, they hit the mark, what quality from De Bruyne.\n20:37 Comment: How he wraps the ball.\n20:38 Comment: Both of them, André Gómez and De Bruyne.\n20:40 Comment: How he wrapped that hit there to get it away from Ter Stegen and leave it stuck, but in the end the ball went away.\n20:45 Comment: Stick out, a titir appears, a short titir for André Gómez who had better the last minutes now of FC Barcelona in the play of Luis Suárez.\n20:55 Comment: After Stones' mistake in the opponent's field.\n20:58 Comment: It's something that, for example, Guardiola has always tried to alleviate, minimize in his teams.\n21:4 Comment: The losses in the rival field that do so much damage to the back of their defense.\n21:8 Comment: Because the team scores very high and of course there are many meters of distance between their goal and the last field defender.\n21:14 Comment: Jesus Novas ready.\n21:16 Comment: The child of the palaces is ready and Villafranca plays the ball again upstairs.\n21:20 Comment: Playing for Neymar.\n21:22 Comment: Neymar, Neymar now with Messi.\n21:25 Comment: In the end the element doesn't come out, Silva cuts, Maracón goes.\n21:27 Comment: Look how they reactivate now as soon as they steal the ball from City.\n21:31 Comment: Gundogan takes her.\n21:32 Comment: Gundogan on the front, he can create, he plays it for Silva, Silva holds up.\n21:36 Comment: He's leaving.\n21:37 Comment:  Yeah.\n21:38 Comment: Goal kick.\n21:39 Comment: Well André Gómez, he has done a phenomenal job there because on top of that he had another robbery left for the left profile, thank you.\n21:47 Comment: Once again he steals it in front of Mascherano who puts his boot and his soul into Guantacún.\n21:52 Comment: In front of Sergi Roberto harassed by several.\n21:54 Comment:  Fernando Conte Turines unloads and keeps the ball for his team again.\n21:57 Comment: Zabaleta is already running into space, what a ball for Sterling.\n21:59 Comment: Offside.\n22:0 Comment: Come on, if he opens his legs or just lets her pass without moving,\n22:4 Comment: Zabaleta came like a cannon from the outside, down the Sterling hallway.\n22:8 Comment: Sterling appears from an advanced position, Marcos goes inside to enter the play.\n22:13 Comment: It's offside, I get the feeling, what happens is that in offside there is a situation that is Diñi\n22:19 Comment: He is only looking at Zabaleta and by a meter he does not enable Sterling.\n22:23 Comment: He had forgotten about Sterling's reference, he continues the race with Zabaleta and almost enables him.\n22:28 Comment: If Sterling is a little more involved in the play, if he takes a step forward he finds the scoring situation easy.\n22:35 Comment: Ball up, Willy Caballero comes out in front of Luis Suárez.\n22:37 Comment: Sterling may be the next to leave the field.\n22:41 Comment: I imagine Guardiola will want to maintain the back-and-forth energy of the counterattack.\n22:45 Comment: It is very important that wing players are able to go but also come back,\n22:50 Comment: because Manchester City is finding good recoveries.\n22:53 Comment: How the game has changed compared to that middle section of the first half where Barça dominated and held Manchester City.\n22:59 Comment: De Bruyne, de Bruyne, now in front of Macenano who regains control, plays for Ter Stegen.\n23:3 Comment: Ter Stegen now takes it out of the way in front of Belga, in the bag to Bill Fernando but he goes towards that side of the field.\n23:12 Comment: Now pursued by André Gómez, he plays the ball for Kolarov, it's for Silva again.\n23:16 Comment: Silva wants to delay, he plays for Stones.\n23:18 Comment: Stones with Willy, chased by Luis Suárez who is going to bite him as far as he can there to find the ball.\n23:25 Comment: Now also try to do the same, an omen with a marmoset.\n23:29 Comment: In disputes, as Marcos said in the previous one, only one in ten wins.\n23:32 Comment: But he also tried in defense, the ball stops de Bruyne.\n23:35 Comment: The game is broken, there are two camps right now.\n23:38 Comment: Barça is breaking up and Busquets is desperate.\n23:40 Comment: Two groups of players, one on each field.\n23:42 Comment: Now the link again, now Fernando with de Bruyne, he plays for Silva.\n23:49 Comment: Silva back for de Bruyne, well André Gómez, touch back for Kolarov.\n23:53 Comment: Football controls now that it also plays in favor of Guardiola's Manchester City.\n23:58 Comment: With the result of 2-1, City had never beaten Barça in the five previous matches.\n24:4 Comment: Well and Guardiola against a Spanish team, all defeats against Barça, Atleti and Real Madrid.\n24:9 Comment: It is also true that City against Spanish teams, Susana, did not do as badly as against Barça.\n24:15 Comment: He is the only one of the Spaniards who has beaten him here at the Etihad City of Manchester.\n24:21 Comment: Ball up again.\n24:23 Comment: Digne falls clearly obstructed by Sterling, there is a foul called by Víctor Casay.\n24:28 Comment: The change is coming, Guides.\n24:29 Comment: Now Jesús Navas is going to come in, Sterling is leaving.\n24:36 Comment: Applauded once again by the Etihad audience standing up.\n24:43 Comment: I don't know what you think, Lobo, Marcos, but I think it's right because it has Yellow Card.\n24:48 Comment: Yes, and because there is a lot of space, City are still looking at the third goal as their objective.\n24:54 Comment: Then we see the action repeated, it's just that it's left on a plate.\n24:58 Comment: What happens is that it hits it so flat with the inside that it doesn't measure well because it deceives Caballero.\n25:2 Comment: Look what he does to him, he tricks him but he hits him too hard.\n25:7 Comment: Once you cheat with the position of the ankle, it's just placing it, it's not putting power into it.\n25:13 Comment: He backhands Caballero, that's why I said I wouldn't say it's a bad finish.\n25:19 Comment: His ankle just goes a little bit there, heck.\n25:23 Comment: And well, I think he wants to ensure perhaps with two or three seasons at Barça and dominating and being indisputable,\n25:29 Comment: It's at the goals with more effort, because you have less anxiety when hitting, you go less rigid and it goes better there.\n25:35 Comment: Sterling's change, common at Manchester City, common under Guardiola, always tries to refresh bands.\n25:42 Comment: If we look at the statistics, we will see that in a very high percentage of the time Sterling, minute 70 is the change.\n25:48 Comment: Yes, that is clear. What happens is that today, more than ever, I said, more accurate, evidently because of the Yellow Card of the English.\n25:55 Comment: In the first half, the first of the game, André Gómez plays the ball, first for Sergi Roberto, now set by Colaron.\n26:0 Comment: The wall now with Luis Suárez, comes deep with Stokes, who wins the game.\n26:3 Comment: Delay the center back, it's time for Uli Caballero, who controls.\n26:7 Comment: He wants to ask Messi and company to come to open a gap in that high pressure of FC Barcelona.\n26:11 Comment: He puts it there, on the border of the two fields, where De Burrini and Mascherano already point.\n26:15 Comment: The Belgian wins, he plays the ball for Silva, Manchester City, ball up into space for Kun Agüero.\n26:19 Comment: On the right Jesús Navas inside Burrini and also Gundogan.\n26:22 Comment: Silva appears to take a break, Kun Agüero continues.\n26:25 Comment: Kun Agüero on the front, plays the ball for De Burrini, help comes from Neymar.\n26:28 Comment: Ball to the right for Zabaleta, everyone plays here.\n26:31 Comment: Again to the right, the ball plays for Jesús Navas, the Argentine comes deep against a marmoset.\n26:35 Comment: Sergi Roberto puts it in his head, he's not quick at the back, but Barça takes it.\n26:43 Comment: What a back and forth, it's spectacular.

there, Sergi Roberto lifting the ball for Busquets.\n26:56 Comment: A ball that crossed the large area through the air, with players with as much touch and as much punch as Manchester City has.\n27:5 Comment: Mascherano plays, who comes out with the ball, plays for Luis Suárez.\n27:8 Comment: Prolongs up the right side again for André Gómez.\n27:11 Comment: Stonza withstands the challenge, plays for Willy Caballero, who sends her up.\n27:15 Comment: The ball goes to Silva again, Sergi Roberto perfectly fixed the throw-in.\n27:22 Comment: Throw-in for FC Barcelona, ​​who at the moment Luis Enrique continues to gesture at Was,\n27:29 Comment: But we don't see him going to execute, although Rafinha is warming up between them.\n27:35 Comment: Well, Rafinha has been warming up since the first half, it seems like he's going to be the next change, but he still hasn't called Luis Enrique.\n27:43 Comment: He is also the talismanic footballer for Lucho.\n27:45 Comment: A great supporter.\n27:47 Comment: The key for Barça is to take refuge in Messi, in control, also in Arda.\n27:52 Comment: Look for the plays to be a little longer, block closer together and try to avoid losing the ball that causes counterattacks by Manchester City.\n28:0 Comment: Barça right now to bring the game back to 17, apart from the strategy like this, which can always be a good point,\n28:6 Comment: He has to dominate the game, control it and take it to the territory of the touch.\n28:10 Comment: Bayern has also turned the result around now with a goal from Lewandowski, put into Gugli Caballero's fists,\n28:15 Comment: The border remains for Messi, Messi against Kun, Kun takes it away, duel of tens, De Bruyne plays,\n28:20 Comment: He goes on the counterattack, a titi comes to get in the way, the ball goes to the left, he appears with everything, there's Kun,\n28:25 Comment: Kun in front of André Gómez, he plays Sergi Roberto from the inside, he has Gundogan, he plays like this in front of André Gómez,\n28:31 Comment: ball for De Bruyne, De Bruyne faces it, serves a scandalous ball for Navas,\n28:34 Comment: Navas puts it in, misses it but Guglielma scores.\n28:41 Comment: Kun from Manchester City, who is 3 to 1, Barça protests, Guas, that there is a hand in control.\n28:51 Comment: Some start right at the other goal, let's see the replay now.\n28:56 Comment: But that's what Lobo was clearly protesting, to fellow footballers from the Barcelona football club,\n29:1 Comment: demanding that they hit the arm at the control.\n29:5 Comment: This goal is like Barça's first, it comes from a strategy in favor of the opposing team,\n29:10 Comment: This counterattack was slower than Messi's first and the opposing team scored.\n29:16 Comment: A game difference.\n29:19 Comment: There they say that there may be Kun Agüero's hand.\n29:23 Comment: The truth is that we must applaud City's bravery because they have not backed down,\n29:29 Comment: It seems that he has his arms close to his body, but it seems that he is trying, he has the intention,\n29:36 Comment: But I, well, I wouldn't blow a hand there either because it doesn't take it away from the body.\n29:40 Comment: That's right, he doesn't take it out.\n29:41 Comment:  TRUE?\n29:42 Comment: You saw the replay, didn't you.\n29:43 Comment: It's like a bowling pin.\n29:44 Comment: That's what it seemed to me.\n29:45 Comment: That's right, like a skittle.\n29:46 Comment: Don't talk about bowling, but like bowling.\n29:48 Comment: Yes, well, we are facing a team that does not look at the scoreboard.\n29:51 Comment: City confirms a bit of the feeling we had in the Camp Nou game\n29:56 Comment: And he needed to be able to penalize Barcelona's mistakes as well\n30:1 Comment: And he did it tonight so far.\n30:3 Comment: Well, there's a quarter of an hour left of the real show.\n30:8 Comment: This goal is true, Antonio, this goal is what Guardiola celebrated.\n30:12 Comment: No wonder, let's see now.\n30:14 Comment: A prudent distance, although, well, that's Barça, not the one in front.\n30:19 Comment: Messi, above all.\n30:21 Comment: Let's see, there the ball plays again.\n30:23 Comment: Fall, Gundogan, whistle on the asphalt.\n30:26 Comment: Víctor Casai, signing in favor of Manchester City.\n30:30 Comment: Now it seems that Rafinha is going to be Luis Enrique's replacement.\n30:34 Comment: It's ready, it's ready.\n30:37 Comment: Maybe because of André Gómez, right?\n30:38 Comment: It's likely, yes, yes.\n30:41 Comment: There it is, the Portuguese who had it there leaves, the ball went off the crossbar.\n30:45 Comment: Oops, it hits you, now in this network that can be seen clearly.\n30:48 Comment: The arm is in front of the body.\n30:50 Comment: Yes, but it's hard to see, it's just that we're in business as usual.\n30:54 Comment: You can't see it 100%.\n30:55 Comment: We have a wonderful image here and, well,\n30:58 Comment: It is a match that cannot be seen in the world.\n31:2 Comment: You can't see it 100%.\n31:3 Comment: We have a wonderful image here and...\n31:6 Comment: The pass in any case is, as they said, in the live play, scandalous by Jesús Navas.\n31:10 Comment: Perfect the death pass of a lifetime.\n31:13 Comment: Now he's complaining about Bruyne.\n31:15 Comment: The pass is tense, so it hits anyone and goes inside.\n31:19 Comment: The sensation is that Kun makes a strange gesture with his arm.\n31:23 Comment:  Yes Yes Yes.\n31:24 Comment:  But...\n31:25 Comment: Because he's past the play.\n31:26 Comment: The ball falls far behind him.\n31:28 Comment: It's like me, the sensation, always talking about sensations and perceptions,\n31:33 Comment: It's a very fast and very difficult play.\n31:35 Comment: But it's like Kun with his arm makes a placement gesture, volleyball plan.\n31:41 Comment: But the feeling is not that he wants to leave it behind, but that he wants to put it in.\n31:44 Comment: He wants to try to take advantage of the body.\n31:46 Comment: Strange play, difficult, very difficult.\n31:48 Comment: The Kun is falling and with inence.\n31:51 Comment: Played, I insist, to see again.\n31:53 Comment: Mascherano plays there.\n31:54 Comment: Mascherano, ball up, let it pass.\n31:56 Comment: He has thrown it, he wins behind his back, he tries to invent, he holds on, he plays for Sergi Roberto.\n32:1 Comment: This is not over.\n32:2 Comment: Sergi Roberto playing at the top of the box for Rafinha.\n32:5 Comment: Rafinha playing for Busquets again.\n32:7 Comment:  Busquets at the most backward vertex what Raneimar is going to say.\n32:10 Comment: First class...\n32:11 Comment: Aaah!\n32:12 Comment: Willy Caballero came to play.\n32:13 Comment: There was offside.\n32:16 Comment: But the play was volleyball, never better said, because there was a setter.\n32:19 Comment: It didn't seem like it live, but the assistant is fine.\n32:22 Comment: A setter that was Busquets, a setter that was Raneimar and looking for the shot at the far post.\n32:27 Comment: A finisher like Luis Suárez was.\n32:29 Comment: Apart from inertia, while we watch the repetition...\n32:34 Comment: Apart from love, always wanting to attack and redundancy is worth it.\n32:39 Comment: While we see that image repeated...\n32:41 Comment: He makes a clarifying gesture.\n32:43 Comment:  Yes Yes Yes.\n32:44 Comment: But he has it attached to his body, to his arm.\n32:46 Comment: That's why I tell you that it is very difficult to point out and touch him.\n32:49 Comment: Every time you do it more often, you get more out of it.\n32:52 Comment: However, Kun is betrayed by the curve of the ball.\n32:55 Comment: The curve goes to the outside and he loses the ball.\n32:58 Comment: Because I think the sensation is that he puts his arm and his whole body to try to get in even with her on goal.\n33:4 Comment: More than taking his arm out, what he does is put it in to look for where the ball is coming from.\n33:10 Comment: Everyone seeks their advantage.\n33:12 Comment: That's why the play is as strange as Marcos says.\n33:15 Comment: You can see how the Kun moves his arm closer to the position of the body, the abdomen.\n33:21 Comment: And obviously that's where the ball is going.\n33:24 Comment: And you've already seen the rest, right?\n33:25 Comment: How the ball then goes back.\n33:28 Comment: Serginio Roberto heads the ball again.\n33:33 Comment: Kun again.\n33:34 Comment: Kun against Mascherano.\n33:36 Comment: Kun falls.\n33:37 Comment: Hold on Mascherano.\n33:38 Comment: Delay the ball for Ter Stegen.\n33:39 Comment: There is a lot of respect there.\n33:42 Comment: But I wanted to say...\n33:43 Comment: They have tied, forgive me Wolf.\n33:44 Comment: Celtic tied.\n33:46 Comment: Important result in the other group match because right now Borussia Monchengladbach 1 is there.\n33:50 Comment: Glasgow Celtic 1 in Germany.\n33:53 Comment: So right now I still...\n33:55 Comment: Look how everything has changed from the first part.\n33:56 Comment: Borussia and Barça killed.\n33:58 Comment: Now here City does it and they just tied Celtic.\n34:1 Comment: And when we go to schools to explain things why they happen.\n34:5 Comment: City wanting to attack, attack, attack after the 2 to 1 they achieved.\n34:8 Comment: He has cooled Leo Messi at Barcelona.\n34:11 Comment: The level of everything has lowered, the response, everything.\n34:14 Comment: Then you cool it in a way that I like the most.\n34:18 Comment: Which is without having to mark it.\n34:20 Comment: Because you have the ball, you attack and put the Barcelona defense in check.\n34:24 Comment: Which is what you are experiencing in this second part.\n34:26 Comment: Look, Ebrin hot, Silva hot, Sterling when he's been hot.\n34:29 Comment: Silva, of course.\n34:31 Comment: Silva in for Kun.\n34:32 Comment: Kun in the space he likes.\n34:35 Comment: He hit the side directly.\n34:38 Comment: Goal kick.\n34:39 Comment: City, who likes football, really, this round trip.\n34:45 Comment: It's just been...\n34:46 Comment: Look what happens to Silva.\n34:47 Comment: The Laudrups were told beforehand that their idol was Michael Laudrup.\n34:50 Comment: Or also that of Andrés Iniesta.\n34:52 Comment: And indeed, he has that 1-2 too, that croquette that the Dane had.\n34:56 Comment: And this virtually no-look pass with the outside of his boot.\n35:5 Comment: Pressed the Kun.\n35:6 Comment: That seems to be Was.\n35:7 Comment: Let's see, let's see.\n35:8 Comment:  Because right now...\n35:9 Comment: Twisted, let's see.\n35:11 Comment: He just made a gesture.\n35:15 Comment:  No no no.\n35:16 Comment: Mascherano's kick goes there...\n35:18 Comment: The pass that touches the ball and the referee of the centers of the box.\n35:20 Comment: To the left leg, huh.\n35:21 Comment:  Look.\n35:22 Comment: Ah, no, down.\n35:23 Comment: Look at your ankle a little too.\n35:25 Comment: Lavante is Susana of the Manchester City youth players.\n35:28 Comment: Aleix García.\n35:30 Comment:  Other.\n35:31 Comment: Very good level player.\n35:33 Comment: Very good level.\n35:34 Comment: He did not enter the call because he does not comply with UEFA regulations of being there for more than two years\n35:38 Comment: in the Manchester City youth academy.\n35:40 Comment: Wait Marcos, because now it really seems that Luis Suárez has been hurt.\n35:43 Comment: No, the Uruguayan is up.\n35:45 Comment: And Otamendi.\n35:46 Comment: And Otamendi who is still on the ground.\n35:47 Comment: Susana, they are telling Zabaleta from here that Luis Suárez has crouched down and has\n35:51 Comment: caused the fall.\n35:52 Comment: Look, let's see.\n35:55 Comment: In any case, we have commented on it in the controversial play, in the third goal of the\n36:1 Comment:  Manchester City.\n36:2 Comment: The fall is tremendous Otamendi.\n36:5 Comment: Tremendous and falls completely unbalanced in the air.\n36:8 Comment: I say that there is a fundamental referee, a fundamental judge.\n36:13 Comment: In addition, he takes the play from behind Navas when he makes the pass.\n36:18 Comment: So he sees it straight.\n36:19 Comment: Yes, but interpret that arm that doesn't take up space, that it has done it on purpose, all of them\n36:24 Comment: These things cost a lot.\n36:26 Comment: That's why I defend referees so much.\n36:28 Comment: I had to see Sterling's penalty, I had to see it three times to change\n36:33 Comment:  the opinion.\n36:34 Comment: But because they gave it to me, they gave it to me.\n36:35 Comment: Until we understand that the referee is part of the game, that he interprets and that\n36:39 Comment: You can also make mistakes, like we or you at home or the players themselves make mistakes,\n36:43 Comment: Leo Messi can be an omen whoever wants.\n36:45 Comment: Be careful with the dead ball.\n36:46 Comment: Here comes Leo Messi.\n36:48 Comment: There is also Neymar.\n36:51 Comment: Be careful, Cornet rejects it.\n36:56 Comment: He hit the barrier.\n36:59 Comment: Let's see why the group is very interesting at the moment with this result.\n37:5 Comment: Barça puts it at the back post.\n37:7 Comment: Willy Caballero hit.\n37:9 Comment: Corner on the other side for Barça.\n37:16 Comment:  There is.\n37:17 Comment: That's what I was going to tell you, it seems to me that Suárez took the corner...\n37:20 Comment: It has to finish in Suárez, not Lobo.\n37:22 Comment: Of course, and you have to look at the clock, you have to calm your nerves, not have anxiety.\n37:30 Comment: The rejection again, corner kick.\n37:33 Comment: However, in a match between two possession teams that want to have a lot of time\n37:38 Comment: The ball, the definition, the difference in the game is in the counterattack.\n37:43 Comment:  We'll see.\n37:44 Comment: Neymar is going to put it in static.\n37:46 Comment: It is true that neither has surpassed the other.\n37:47 Comment: He puts it up.\n37:48 Comment: Put your head in Silva.\n37:50 Comment: It goes to Jesús Navas.\n37:51 Comment: However, Sergi Roberto now gets to play the Palacios.\n37:53 Comment: He puts it up, let De Bruyne pass.\n37:55 Comment: Kun Agüero also runs to the other side.\n37:57 Comment: Scale, Digne.\n37:58 Comment: Digne against De Bruyne.\n37:59 Comment: Hold on De Bruyne.\n38:0 Comment: Gundogan is running.\n38:1 Comment: Rejection almost hunts him.\n38:3 Comment: Mascherano.\n38:4 Comment: Mascherano head first.\n38:5 Comment: The ball that falls to Silva.\n38:7 Comment: Silva holds on.\n38:8 Comment: Arda Turán comes next door.\n38:9 Comment: He plays for De Bruyne.\n38:10 Comment: The Belgian delays.\n38:11 Comment: Ball for Zabaleta.\n38:12 Comment: Zabaleta gets up.\n38:13 Comment: The move comes out for De Bruyne.\n38:14 Comment: City is coming.\n38:15 Comment: It puts her in the background.\n38:17 Comment: He has to wait for the ball before Sergi Roberto intercepts it well now.\n38:20 Comment: But breathe the ball so that City wins it again with Kolarov.\n38:23 Comment: Kolarov puts it at the top of the area.\n38:25 Comment: Rejects Busquets.\n38:26 Comment: Throw-in.\n38:28 Comment: However, we are seeing two rhythms.\n38:30 Comment: And in this play we saw them.\n38:31 Comment: De Bruyne wants more goals.\n38:32 Comment: And yet Silva wants to finish the game with the ball.\n38:35 Comment: Close it and force Barça to defend.\n38:37 Comment: Running the ball.\n38:38 Comment: Knowing that it is easier to neutralize this Barça if you have the ball.\n38:42 Comment: Because right now if Barça combines they can always hurt any player.\n38:45 Comment: There are 7 minutes left.\n38:47 Comment: Improperly done to Víctor Casay.\n38:48 Comment: At the moment the group is...\n38:49 Comment: Uh!\n38:50 Comment: How angry

level.\n39:6 Comment: What happens is that Stones was already rumored several seasons ago to leave Everton for other greats.\n39:11 Comment: And he didn't finish leaving for Guardiola's City until this season.\n39:15 Comment: However, a very important player in getting the ball out of Manchester City.\n39:19 Comment: The player who plays that piqué role at Manchester City.\n39:22 Comment: His passing percentage is on average at 94%.\n39:26 Comment: It doesn't usually fail.\n39:27 Comment: Today he is especially fast in some pressure situations.\n39:30 Comment: Ayka and Busquets are coming again with Silva.\n39:32 Comment: They both took the hit in the face.\n39:34 Comment: The referee says the game continues.\n39:36 Comment: Sergi Roberto delays for Mascherano.\n39:37 Comment: This is

    "summary": "Manchester City successfully triumphed over Barcelona with a final scoreline of 3-1 in a tightly contested match at the Etihad Stadium. This match, vital for City's progression in the Champions League, showcased a blend of tactical prowess, individual brilliance, and several moments of sheer footballing excellence from both sides.\n\nThe match began with an intense atmosphere, and Manchester City took immediate control, showcasing their intent from the starting whistle. Barcelona's midfield maestro, Sergio Busquets, and City's David Silva had a heated battle for midfield supremacy. Throughout the match, it was evident that Barcelona's strategy leaned on the swift and precise ball movement characterized by their tiki-taka style, while City looked dynamic on the counter, exploiting Barcelona's defensive lapses.\n\nThe first half began with Manchester City exerting relentless pressure. De Bruyne and Sergi Roberto's face-off became a focal point early on, as both players tried to outdo each other with speed and skills. The game’s initial minutes saw City's winger Sterling chase down long balls and probe Barcelona’s defensive lines. On the 28th minute, City's relentless pressing bore fruit as Messi dropped deep to help out defensively. This rare sight highlighted the intensity of City's pressure.\n\nAs Messi tried to orchestrate attacks from deep within his half, Neymar and Luis Suárez aimed to dismantle City's defensive lines. Neymar, playing with his characteristic flair, put Manchester City on the back foot multiple times and created openings with his darting runs and incisive passes. Around the 44th minute, a brilliant counter-attack from Barcelona saw Neymar and Messi combine in a glorious one-two. Neymar drove through the heart of City's defense and laid it off perfectly for Messi, who struck it clean into the net from inside the box, giving Barcelona the lead and marking the game's first significant breakthrough.\n\nCity's response was as spirited as ever. In the second half, they sharply increased their tempo. By the 51st minute, Kevin De Bruyne showcased his set-piece mastery by unleashing a powerful free-kick into Barcelona's net, leaving Ter Stegen no chance. The ball swerved beautifully, bypassing the human wall and catching Ter Stegen unprepared as it found the back of the net. City was back in the game, with the score now tied at 1-1.\n\nFollowing the equalizer, City’s midfield, led by the composed Ilkay Gündogan and the ever-dangerous Silva, maintained a firm hold on the game. They orchestrated play beautifully, finding gaps and exploiting Barcelona's high defensive line. On the 61st minute, another quick transition caught Barcelona off guard. Silva lofted a delightful ball into space; Sterling controlled it and tried passing through, but Agüero was the man, waiting sharper, converting the opportunity into City's second goal. The match was now tilted entirely in City's favour at 2-1.\n\nBarcelona, reeling from the quick shift in momentum, tried to regain their rhythm. Arda Turan and Rakitic entered the fray to add fresh legs in the midfield and indeed hid pockets of space for Messi, who danced through City's defense with signature dribbles. Despite their efforts, Barcelona found it tough to penetrate City’s resolute defense marshaled by Stones and Otamendi, often collapsing back to disrupt Barcelona's attacking flow.\n\nEvery counter-attacking opportunity for Barcelona seemed like potential goals, yet City's defense remained largely compact. Compelling footwork and tireless running defined both teams' efforts, but City's relentless energy to press forward led to the climactic moment of the match. Messi and Neymar attempted to orchestrate another counter, but City's zonal marking and elegant tackling allowed them economic restarts in Barcelona’s half. \n\nThen came another pivotal moment. On the 74th minute, Jesús Navas delivered a precise, low cross into the box. Although it seemed as though Kun Agüero might have controlled the ball with his hand, the officials allowed play on, and City capitalized. The cross reached Gündogan, who, with German efficiency, slotted it past Ter Stegen, solidifying City's lead and leaving the visiting Barcelona with a mountain to climb. The scoreline read 3-1, affirming City's dominance in the second half.\n\nGuardiola’s strategic switches, such as bringing on Fernando and later the fresh legs of Jesús Navas, proved instrumental in neutralizing Barcelona’s midfield dynamism. Even with Lionel Messi and Neymar trying their utmost to claw back into the game, City's physicality, coupled with discipline and exploitative counter-attacks, made the difference.\n\nBarcelona pushed forward in the final minutes, desperate to find any opening. Their attacks became increasingly vertical, forsaking their possession-based approach for a direct all-out attack. Despite these efforts, every Barca chance got deflected, disrupted, or intercepted with disciplined City defending.\n\nAs the final whistle blew, City's triumph was a testimony to their resilient character and tactical adaptability under Pep Guardiola. Their pressing game and swift counters paid dividends, manifesting in a memorable victory at the Etihad Stadium. This landmark win against a Barcelona side, resilient and composed yet overpowered by City's display, marked a crucial turning point in their Champions League campaign. \n\nMarcos and other coaches in the technical area could reflect on the glaring importance of strategic pressing, the vitality of set-pieces as demonstrated by De Bruyne, and the essential role of continuous dynamic switching across flanks, evident with Sterling and Gundogan’s positional plays.\n\nIn summary, City executed an almost flawless second-half performance, balancing possession well and making key interceptions, flowing dynamically between defensive catches and offensive prowess seamlessly, which Barca struggled to contain. An end-to-end thrilling match ended with a justice-serving result, elevating City's standings in Group C of the UEFA Champions League, ensuring the group stage remains fiercely competitive."
