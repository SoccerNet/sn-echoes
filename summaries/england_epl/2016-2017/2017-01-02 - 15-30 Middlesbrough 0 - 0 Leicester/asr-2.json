them to change from their 4-4-2, it looks at the moment as if Mahrez is\n0:23 Comment: going to play up front alongside Ushota with Okazaki in the hole and that\n0:27 Comment: would take three behind them\n0:35 Comment: the recent history of this fixture certainly favors Leicester\n0:40 Comment: unbeaten in their last 13 league encounters with Middlesbrough and\n0:43 Comment: Claudio Ranieri has only lost once to them in his time with Chelsea and Leicester\n0:57 Comment: Fabio restored at left back in place of George Friend\n1:5 Comment: Ben Gibson local boy, nephew of the chairman\n1:10 Comment: Callum Chambers is back alongside him in the heart of defense, Barrahan here was\n1:14 Comment: suspended at Old Trafford\n1:17 Comment: Negredo, De Roon looking to latch onto that, tidied up by Mendy\n1:22 Comment: That would be the idea you know De Roon is the one who's been given the freedom to get alongside Negredo and\n1:27 Comment: beyond him at times and if you think back to the goal he scored that the\n1:30 Comment: Etihad had earlier on this season, that's exactly the type of late run you'd be expected to\n1:35 Comment: play today\n1:41 Comment: Spurs Michael who returned recently from injury and Leicester rather glad to\n1:45 Comment: have him back, a safe pair of hands, the Premier League title to his name only\n1:52 Comment: four more to catch up with his old man\n1:57 Comment: and the new club to be\n1:59 Comment: In time there's a rare outing for Brad Guzan\n2:5 Comment: first since August, Valdez picked up a knock after that inspirational\n2:10 Comment: performance at his former club Manchester United\n2:15 Comment: And he came, playing with Negredo, Barrahan\n2:31 Comment: Yeah trying that little spin there, Negredo just trying to drag his studs over the ball doesn't quite get there\n2:40 Comment: Such a huge player for Middlesbrough but I do think at times they've got to support them much better\n2:45 Comment: Better supply him from the wide areas as well, we know he can finish if he gets the chance\n2:49 Comment: We know he can finish if he gets the chance\n2:50 Comment: We haven't seen much of Palas Mendy because of injury\n2:54 Comment: in his second Premier League outing today\n2:57 Comment: The Matic.\n3:2 Comment: Huth.\n3:4 Comment: Here is Mendy.\n3:17 Comment: Middlesbrough have proved they can compete most of their defeats.\n3:23 Comment: I think by a single goal margin.\n3:24 Comment: They're not far off where they want to be.\n3:28 Comment: I think defensively they've been very sound.\n3:30 Comment: They've lost just one more goal in Liverpool.\n3:32 Comment: So clearly they're doing something right at the back.\n3:35 Comment: It's at the other end of the pitch where they're really struggling.\n3:39 Comment: Four short.\n3:44 Comment: Barahan.\n3:45 Comment: Here's Adama Traore who had that big chance at Old Trafford.\n3:49 Comment: Certainly an exciting player.\n3:53 Comment: Sometimes you wonder about the in-play.\n3:54 Comment: It's in the product's mind.\n4:2 Comment: Lovely round of Matic.\n4:7 Comment: Derone.\n4:9 Comment: Barahan.\n4:13 Comment: Traore.\n4:14 Comment: Ready to have his first run.\n4:16 Comment: Taking on Fuchs here.\n4:21 Comment: OK.\n4:21 Comment: Final touch is just a little bit clumsy.\n4:24 Comment: But it's a good example of the acceleration of this boy.\n4:27 Comment: You know, if I was Barahan today, I wouldn't be overlapping him too often.\n4:30 Comment: I'd try and get him one-on-one with Christian Fuchs.\n4:34 Comment: He slips there, but he is so quick.\n4:37 Comment: He can get down the outside.\n4:38 Comment: Final ball at times, as you said.\n4:40 Comment: He lets him down.\n4:41 Comment: But he's a real handful.\n4:51 Comment: Knocked on by Marti.\n4:52 Comment: Away by Chambers.\n4:54 Comment: And he's got a great pass.\n4:55 Comment: He's got a great pass.\n4:58 Comment: And a lovely pass from Fabio for Gaston Ramirez here.\n5:4 Comment: And his touch somewhat made him nap.\n5:6 Comment: Not like him.\n5:8 Comment: Technically very good Gaston Ramirez.\n5:10 Comment: It's a terrific ball.\n5:11 Comment: In behind Danny Simpson.\n5:14 Comment: Chambers run perfectly.\n5:15 Comment: This touch here, just a little bit clumsy.\n5:18 Comment: Allows Wes Morgan to get across and shut him out.\n5:20 Comment: But a really good shaped ball forward from Fabio.\n5:24 Comment: To get him in.\n5:28 Comment: Yes, possibly the last man you'd expect to have a touch like that.\n5:31 Comment: One that got away for Gaston Ramirez.\n5:36 Comment: Such a key influence for Middlesbrough.\n5:42 Comment: Mahrez.\n5:51 Comment: Yeah, Mahrez off to the African Nets.\n5:53 Comment: United v Bayern eCup.\n5:57 Comment: And indeed Is Noam Sadam Payet whoever was not involved today\n6:1 Comment: Feeling rather feverish apparently.\n6:6 Comment: Nadlehi gives a free-kick.\n6:10 Comment: He could have given the first one gone\n6:11 Comment: Thanks.\n6:16 Comment: He could have given the first one to Would Enfringement,\n6:18 Comment: I got the offer for Leicester to put up their big targets as they do.\n6:22 Comment: No surprise that Huth is there.\n6:25 Comment: Morgan joining him, Akwae Zamati and Ojoa.\n6:31 Comment: Some cause for concern here for Middlesbrough.\n6:35 Comment: Huth facing his former club.\n6:44 Comment: It's Riyad Mahrez then to float it.\n6:46 Comment: One, two!\n6:48 Comment: Okazaki looking to sneak in.\n6:52 Comment: It's all about the first ball, who's gonna win the first ball here?\n7:0 Comment: Knocked down into a really good area,\n7:2 Comment: Okazaki read it really well, it's just a little bit too whitefold.\n7:11 Comment: Mario Ranieri ended 2016 fittingly with a victory against West Ham\n7:15 Comment: in a thrilling game a couple of days ago.\n7:18 Comment: It's surprising given the way they played that day,\n7:22 Comment: they had terrific wood, good supply into the box,\n7:24 Comment: and yet he comes here today and leaves out his two natural white players\n7:28 Comment: in all bright and grey.\n7:33 Comment: Baraha, Traore.\n7:40 Comment: Ojoa moved in on Clayton and now Okazaki.\n7:42 Comment: Mahrez moves ahead of him.\n7:46 Comment: Andy King.\n7:48 Comment: Ojoa.\n7:51 Comment: It slithers wide of his intended target from Fuchs.\n7:55 Comment: I think he has to take it on.\n7:58 Comment: Ben Gibson, I think, is trying to get out to the ball here to make the block.\n8:2 Comment: But even from that angle, it's shorty, he has to take on.\n8:9 Comment: Fuchs, who had to sit out the last couple of games\n8:12 Comment: when they came on against West Ham with young Ben Chilwell.\n8:15 Comment: And he's got a good shot.\n8:17 Comment: Starting a couple of matches.\n8:29 Comment: And by Ojoa, Okazaki.\n8:34 Comment: Chambers away.\n8:36 Comment: Traore.\n8:37 Comment: Robert Poof, world return man.\n8:40 Comment: Poof, who spent three years as a Middlesbrough player\n8:43 Comment: and was relegated from the Premier League with them.\n8:45 Comment: But he then moved to Stoke.\n8:47 Comment: And he then moved to Stoke.\n9:9 Comment: It's not difficult, is it?\n9:15 Comment: He's complaining there, Antonio Barajan, but...\n9:18 Comment: he can help with a quick point.\n9:25 Comment: Mahrez.\n9:33 Comment: He has to have to come from behind twice\n9:35 Comment: when these two met just five weeks ago at the King Power.\n9:39 Comment: A couple of penalties as well from Mahrez and Slimani.\n9:43 Comment: Slimani's in the 94th minute.\n9:45 Comment: He's got a good shot.\n9:47 Comment: Christian Fuchs ready to go along here towards Robert Poof,\n9:50 Comment: looking for a flick on, but he's met by Chambers.\n9:52 Comment: Mahrez.\n9:55 Comment: Lost clips by Ramirez.\n9:57 Comment: That took a really nice touch.\n10:1 Comment: Adam Clayton trying to apply the pressure here.\n10:3 Comment: He's here late.\n10:5 Comment: And this is well within range here for Leicester.\n10:8 Comment: Dead centre.\n10:9 Comment: It's going to be an awkward one for Guzan.\n10:11 Comment: Can't really go to either post here.\n10:13 Comment: Probably won't see the ball being struck out.\n10:20 Comment: Yes, it's potentially an awkward situation for Brett Guzan.\n10:29 Comment: Fuchs is there, but Mahrez...\n10:31 Comment: would appear to fancy this.\n10:37 Comment: Not a problem with the low sun as well, Brad Guzan,\n10:39 Comment: if he takes up a position on the left of his line.\n10:44 Comment: If he takes up a position on the left of his line.\n10:49 Comment: But it's Mahrez.\n10:51 Comment: There are fans holding their breath.\n10:56 Comment: It is Mahrez, but it's rather disappointing,\n10:58 Comment: straight against that wall.\n11:3 Comment: Simpson...\n11:5 Comment: and Endy.\n11:9 Comment: Fuchs...\n11:10 Comment: and Marti.\n11:11 Comment: Fuchs...\n11:12 Comment: and Marti.\n11:16 Comment: Here's Mendy, who played for Claudio Ranieri at Monaco.\n11:21 Comment: And Marti...\n11:24 Comment: Steered away by Chambers.\n11:26 Comment: He might have to do the same again.\n11:34 Comment: Graham has brought to the trouble.\n11:43 Comment: Breaks a court seal...\n11:44 Comment: and Engineeringlot schools...\n11:46 Comment: with a convergence of\n12:6 Comment: Lee,\n12:8 Comment: Walter,\n12:8 Comment: trauma,\n12:9 Comment: man„Å©,\n12:10 Comment: and we'll get to\n12:11 Comment: We'll get to chip up that next one.\n12:12 Comment: It's come through to Christian Fuchs who failed to connect.\n12:16 Comment: And Gibson taking no chances with Andy King lurking.\n12:18 Comment: I think Christian Fuchs should do better.\n12:21 Comment: I think it's your choice to play the ball here,\n12:23 Comment: but Fuchs should be ready for this when it comes through to him.\n12:27 Comment: And even on the half-volley, he should be doing better than he did.\n12:31 Comment: FOOTBALL PLAYS\n12:40 Comment: Decent early spell from Leicester, can they make the most of it?\n12:49 Comment: I don't know if he wants a word here.\n12:52 Comment: De Roon and Amati.\n13:1 Comment: WHISTLE BLOWS\n13:5 Comment: It's Mahrez then to send this in.\n13:12 Comment: Return by Mendy.\n13:14 Comment: Morgan's still up there.\n13:16 Comment: Doesn't reach Okazaki, though.\n13:23 Comment: Ramirez, and he loses out to Amati, but the free kick is good.\n13:27 Comment: They get the free kick, but the middlesbrough home support\n13:29 Comment: are not happy with the start.\n13:30 Comment: They say,\n13:30 Comment: THEY CHANT\n13:33 Comment: Struggling to build anything so far.\n13:35 Comment: THEY CHANT\n13:38 Comment: Ramirez gets his body across.\n13:41 Comment: Loses his body well there, Amati can't win it cleanly.\n13:46 Comment: Middlesbrough seeing their fair share of the ball,\n13:49 Comment: but doing very little with it so far.\n13:55 Comment: Fabio.\n13:58 Comment: Andy King sliding in.\n14:0 Comment: he says the enjoyed the premiership but then...\n14:3 Comment: lang for the bar.\n14:6 Comment: P\n14:25 Comment: f su miel\n14:26 Comment: C\n14:26 Comment: o\n14:26

Clayton.\n14:35 Comment: Good feet from Okazaki.\n14:40 Comment: Seneca one from Clayton.\n14:50 Comment: That's all, Karanka, over three years in charge.\n14:55 Comment: Eventually got Middlesbrough into the top flight.\n14:58 Comment: That's the playoff puts.\n15:0 Comment: Then one automatic promotion.\n15:6 Comment: Ramirez with a switch here to Traore.\n15:12 Comment: That's such a good switch from Ramirez.\n15:17 Comment: Usually got his head up, sees any movement ahead of him.\n15:27 Comment: Leicester's victory over...\n15:28 Comment: West Ham was only their second in ten Premier League outings.\n15:41 Comment: Just 19 points worse off than this stage last season.\n15:48 Comment: They've certainly enjoyed their Champions League adventure.\n15:59 Comment: Schalke still beat upane.\n16:1 Comment: They'll still be there for next weeks.\n16:5 Comment: It might be thatconstant.\n16:7 Comment: But it seems they've got KasemÍ≥ºgre to each setbacks.\n16:12 Comment: —á—Ç–æ.\n16:14 Comment: With 20 cars in an hour,\n16:16 Comment: I prefer to imagine he installs himself there too.\n16:19 Comment: I think with that you start to think,\n16:21 Comment: is this just a walkthrough from returning connect?\n16:24 Comment: I think previously,\n16:25 Comment: Ferraris came in,\n16:25 Comment: MinnelliAAAA!\n16:28 Comment: Callaghan forced into a corner.\n16:35 Comment: Christian Fuchs appealing for the throw but it is Middlesbrough.\n16:42 Comment: For sure.\n16:43 Comment: Negredo.\n16:45 Comment: Could do with him being in the middle, he'll get there now.\n16:50 Comment: Here's Fabio.\n16:52 Comment: Giving some space to Roe and to deliver.\n16:55 Comment: Fuchs clears.\n16:57 Comment: Clayton keeps it alive.\n16:59 Comment: Negredo claiming a handball.\n17:1 Comment: I don't think he's ever going to get it given the short distance, the ball travel.\n17:11 Comment: Middlesbrough trying to work their way into this contest.\n17:17 Comment: Chambers for Barrahan.\n17:19 Comment: Traore ahead, hugging that touchline.\n17:24 Comment: He's on his way.\n17:27 Comment: On the Traore.\n17:29 Comment: Well picked.\n17:31 Comment: That looked a bit theatrical.\n17:33 Comment: Terrific acceleration again when he came off the line here though from the wide player.\n17:39 Comment: He's got such a good burst from static position here.\n17:42 Comment: This coming in.\n17:48 Comment: Plays it. I think he's looking for it.\n17:50 Comment: He's less theatrical. He might have probably given madly a decision to me.\n18:8 Comment: Fuchs.\n18:10 Comment: Neither here nor there.\n18:14 Comment: At the feet of Ben Gibson and now Fabio.\n18:16 Comment: ÌõÑ\n18:17 Comment: Like it was swirling out.\n18:29 Comment: Ramirez decided to have a go.\n18:40 Comment: Ramirez 16th at the moment, Leicester 15th.\n18:44 Comment: Four points clear of the relegation zone, Leicester six points away.\n19:7 Comment: Christian Fuchs looks like he'll go as long as he possibly can with this.\n19:14 Comment: Cleeton.\n19:21 Comment: That's a throw off Andy King.\n19:31 Comment: Fabio, seeing a lot of the ball at the moment.\n19:38 Comment: Four short.\n19:41 Comment: Ramirez.\n19:43 Comment: Traore.\n19:44 Comment: A sense of expectation now.\n19:45 Comment: You never quite know what is coming next with him though.\n19:50 Comment: Traore.\n19:51 Comment: Skipped away from King.\n19:53 Comment: Derone with a big chance.\n19:55 Comment: Really good ball in from Traore.\n19:57 Comment: We talked about his final ball letting him down at times.\n20:0 Comment: But he does nothing wrong here.\n20:5 Comment: Too quick here.\n20:8 Comment: For Andy King.\n20:9 Comment: Makes a couple of yards for himself and picks a good ball, cutting it back.\n20:14 Comment: The run of the central three midfield players is the one expected to go up alongside Negredo.\n20:20 Comment: And he makes a good run here to the front post.\n20:22 Comment: Slightly behind him.\n20:37 Comment: Leicester have only lost once on their last 11 visits to Teesside.\n20:41 Comment: So hardly a fixture to fear for.\n20:44 Comment: A jump.\n20:48 Comment: Ojoa.\n20:49 Comment: Amati.\n20:50 Comment: Mahrez in some space.\n20:53 Comment: Waiting to receive and he has it.\n20:55 Comment: He's not hanging around either.\n20:56 Comment: But Guzanklet.\n20:58 Comment: He's looking for Mahrez but it's the type of position they want to get him into.\n21:10 Comment: Chambers.\n21:10 Comment: And a hand with Traore.\n21:13 Comment: Close.\n21:14 Comment: by Chambers.\n21:34 Comment: Negredo.\n21:37 Comment: Clayton.\n21:39 Comment: Good work from Clayton.\n21:41 Comment: Now Ramirez.\n21:42 Comment: Back by Mendy though.\n21:44 Comment: We have Mahrez.\n21:50 Comment: Mahrez gets a free kick right on the edge of the area.\n21:53 Comment: That's three Adam Clayton's had.\n21:55 Comment: I don't know if I saw that one in his pocket,\n21:57 Comment: but it wouldn't allow him too many more of this type.\n22:5 Comment: Mahrez head up, trying to get himself inside,\n22:7 Comment: talking the target up for himself.\n22:14 Comment: It's a free kick in a prominent position for Leicester City.\n22:27 Comment: It's Andy King who replaced the ball.\n22:28 Comment: He clearly fancies it.\n22:30 Comment: Whether Mahrez for Rosen or not, we may still be seeing.\n22:34 Comment: But Andy King, from this angle, will certainly fancy it.\n22:37 Comment: Andy King.\n22:45 Comment: Another set-piece scenario for Leicester here.\n22:47 Comment: The last one went against the wall.\n22:50 Comment: It is Andy King.\n22:51 Comment: But it's straight into the midriff of Guzan.\n22:54 Comment: Guzan did well.\n22:56 Comment: Very often you see the goalkeeper moving his feet\n22:57 Comment: as the ball is being struck.\n22:59 Comment: He just holds his position.\n23:1 Comment: Pretty easy for him.\n23:9 Comment: Clayton.\n23:11 Comment: Three years ago yesterday,\n23:12 Comment: was in Huddersfield.\n23:14 Comment: A team that lost 6-1 to Leicester.\n23:17 Comment: Looking for better fortune today.\n23:19 Comment: Barrahan.\n23:20 Comment: Traore behind him for a change.\n23:25 Comment: Clayton.\n23:26 Comment: Fabio.\n23:32 Comment: Derone.\n23:37 Comment: Ramirez.\n23:38 Comment: Traore.\n23:39 Comment: Barrahan.\n23:40 Comment: The Middlesbrough closing in here.\n23:42 Comment: Derone.\n23:44 Comment: Barrahan.\n23:46 Comment: Zaki rushing into his own area.\n23:52 Comment: Pinched by Aja.\n24:3 Comment: Just out of Mahrez's reach.\n24:7 Comment: All fans encouraged.\n24:14 Comment: On the center side,\n24:23 Comment: Dean„ÇÑ„ÄÇ\n24:24 Comment: fortableAntonio Regeo came back from left back,\n24:28 Comment: who's lost a ball.\n24:29 Comment: –∏–µ just said to him this is a!?\n24:31 Comment: Inter impact.\n24:33 Comment: You're all men for a reason.\n24:38 Comment: Raul is a sad thing,\n24:39 Comment: but it's something.\n24:40 Comment: Not manyellini.\n24:43 Comment: It was a close one unharmed,\n24:43 Comment: Well positioned Danny Simpson, in no time did he get himself in the wrong side of the striker.\n24:53 Comment: Williamsburg growing in belief in this game.\n24:55 Comment: And a wonderful dive from Fabian.\n25:0 Comment: Wasn't about to fool the referee.\n25:6 Comment: This was good defending from Danny Simpson here,\n25:8 Comment: Noguero very strong, takes it in well.\n25:10 Comment: Simpson has got his angles spot on, didn't want to commit in case he ended up wrong side.\n25:31 Comment: Bobby Matley has shown a heel of card there as Williamsburg protested furiously.\n25:40 Comment: Andy King.\n25:49 Comment: Gaston Ramirez booked for a show of dissent.\n25:56 Comment: He's got to be careful.\n25:58 Comment: Already flagged himself up.\n26:2 Comment: Doesn't want to end up with a red because of a Poulotin challenge now.\n26:10 Comment: By the way, now we've crossed into the new year.\n26:12 Comment: If you reach five yellow cards,\n26:14 Comment: you do not incur a suspension anymore.\n26:18 Comment: You have to get ten for that.\n26:20 Comment: Which will be quite an achievement anyway.\n26:29 Comment: Fuchs returns it but that will carry to Guzan.\n26:36 Comment: Fabian.\n26:51 Comment: Agredo able to help it on and pressure from Morgan.\n27:6 Comment: That was clever, Flick on.\n27:8 Comment: Fabian found by King.\n27:12 Comment: Can he get there in time?\n27:15 Comment: I think Cameron Chambers was on the case anyway.\n27:17 Comment: Read the run really quick.\n27:23 Comment: A long Premier League week continues.\n27:25 Comment: Tomorrow it's Bournemouth against Arsenal from 7.30 on Sky Sports 1.\n27:30 Comment: And a classic contest on Wednesday.\n27:34 Comment: Spurs against Chelsea, also 7.30, Sky Sports 1.\n27:37 Comment: Can Tottenham stop them?\n27:39 Comment: Both those games also available in Ultra HD.\n27:51 Comment: Simpson.\n27:52 Comment: King for Mendy.\n27:59 Comment: Simpson up towards Ojoa, it's over his head and Gibson's,\n28:2 Comment: but Callum Chambers.\n28:4 Comment: On loan from Arsenal, steers that away.\n28:10 Comment: Big touch from Ramirez.\n28:12 Comment: And he kind of gets it back from Durone.\n28:15 Comment: A bit with a hint of fortune.\n28:17 Comment: Nothing doing for them.\n28:19 Comment: Trying to go for the nutmeg there on Danny Sampson.\n28:22 Comment: To get him behind, I think the ball is getting away from him.\n28:29 Comment: Mendy leans in.\n28:31 Comment: Whether it was enough to put Ramirez down, only he knows.\n28:41 Comment: Leicester, which is two points away from home,\n28:44 Comment: taken at Spurs and Stoke.\n28:47 Comment: At this stage last season, they've racked up 21 points on their trebles.\n28:52 Comment: They're on with the balls and the home support.\n28:56 Comment: That takes second best here.\n28:58 Comment: Adam Clayton has given a few outs so far in this game.\n29:13 Comment: Traore.\n29:17 Comment: Traore is able to deliver again, but it's met by Robert Huth.\n29:22 Comment: And he's got the ball.\n29:23 Comment: Pujol.\n29:24 Comment: Chambers breathing down the back of his shirt.\n29:27 Comment: And...\n29:28 Comment: Pumble.\n29:29 Comment: APPLAUSE\n29:34 Comment: WHISTLE BLOWS\n29:35 Comment: APPLAUSE\n29:39 Comment: It's given again, Christian Futsu.\n29:41 Comment: Pucinic came off his chest.\n29:43 Comment: APPLAUSE\n29:45 Comment: PUCINIC WHISTLE BLOWS\n29:47 Comment: Upper arm.\n29:48 Comment: PUCINIC WHISTLE BLOWS\n29:57 Comment: Ramirez set to deliver.\n29:59 Comment: PUNCHES\n30:6 Comment: Callum Chambers and Ben Gibson have joined\n30:8 Comment: Daron and Negredo in the...\n30:11 Comment: thick of the action.\n30:12 Comment: PUNCHES\n30:15 Comment: Ramirez hits Negredo round the back.\n30:19 Comment: That's all he can do.\n30:20 Comment: PUNCHES\n30:22 Comment: I think it's off the training ground this one, it's really deep by Ramirez.\n30:25 Comment: Negredo just spins, gets away from Amarte.\n30:29 Comment: He's trying to get it back across the face.\n30:33 Comment: Asked a little bit too much of him on the stretch, but did well to lose his marker.\n30:39 Comment: Fabulous header to set up Grant Ledbetter at Old Trafford.\n30:44 Comment: And as you can see, he has history with Leicester.\n30:52 Comment: Amarte.\n30:58 Comment: Pop back by Morgan, and then by Fabio.\n31:2 Comment: Almost toiling a little a moment ago, but whatever it was he seems to have run it off.\n31:8 Comment: Negredo.\n31:10 Comment: By hand.\n31:12 Comment: This is becoming a popular route.\n31:16 Comment: His deliveries have been decent so far today.\n31:19 Comment: Away by Morgan.\n31:21 Comment: And by Ramirez.\n31:24 Comment: And Joao.\n31:27 Comment: And Fabio.\n31:34 Comment: They should have had the free kick middle, but I'm surprised that Bobby Madly didn't give it.\n31:37 Comment: It's a hamstring problem here for Barrahan.\n31:41 Comment: And if it is, that's the end of his game surely.\n31:46 Comment: Yep.\n31:50 Comment: Game over.\n31:51 Comment: For Antonio Barrahan.\n31:53 Comment: Just as he tried to get up to keep it in, something's gone.\n32:1 Comment: Yep.\n32:4 Comment: There's the signal.\n32:5 Comment: No wonder.\n32:6 Comment: Frustrating for Aitor Carranca.\n32:8 Comment: Fabio could move over there with George Friend on the bench, but there are other options as well.\n32:12 Comment: Adam Chambers played it right back at Old Trafford.\n32:15 Comment: Just back from a suspension, Barrahan.\n32:20 Comment: Last thing he needs,

here.\n34:20 Comment: And this time he's in, Prove it.\n34:22 Comment: That is the one thing that lets him do it badly.\n34:26 Comment: This isn't difficult, once he's in behind, he's under no pressure.\n34:31 Comment: He's got an offer front post and back post, and he can find neither.\n34:37 Comment: He's got to do much better.\n34:39 Comment: Once he's in behind Christian Fuchs, it's time to get his head up.\n34:42 Comment: Got to do better than that.\n34:49 Comment: Seven attempts in total.\n34:51 Comment: I do get the impression this game is really to start properly.\n34:59

Horseshaw.\n37:48 Comment: And again.\n37:50 Comment: Maybe an opening here.\n37:52 Comment: Derone! Deflected.\n37:56 Comment: Who did it come off?\n37:58 Comment: It's a tough call for Bobby Magler.\n38:2 Comment: Really good strike this on the edge of the box.\n38:4 Comment: Just wonder, had it not been deflected,\n38:6 Comment: how much of a problem it would have been for Kasper Schmeichel.\n38:9 Comment: Where's Morgan, I think, it comes off.\n38:16 Comment: The officials are no doubt consulting each other and looking at each other,\n38:19 Comment: but nobody was quite sure.\n38:22 Comment: But...\n38:24 Comment: Leicester getting away with that.\n38:26 Comment: Okazaki now.\n38:28 Comment: It's Mahrez!\n38:30 Comment: And it's a very tidy challenge, and it needed to be.\n38:44 Comment: First time of a real chance in the match here,\n38:46 Comment: Okazaki takes a really good first touch here to get away from Clayton.\n38:50 Comment: Slip ball to the left.\n38:52 Comment: And it's a good one for Mahrez.\n38:54 Comment: And Fabio does really well to get as narrow as he does there and make the challenge.\n38:58 Comment: That's one that you simply have to get right, and Fabio did.\n39:4 Comment: Not much room to breathe in the middle of the field.\n39:6 Comment: Here's Derone.\n39:10 Comment: What a chance for Ferrer to get going.\n39:14 Comment: Gaston Ramirez.\n39:16 Comment: Making really good progress here, but he can't pick out Negredo,\n39:22 Comment: and it's comfortable for Fuchs.\n39:24 Comment: That's Middlesbrough's problem this season, you know.\n39:26 Comment: When Ramirez knocks the ball in,\n39:28 Comment: Negredo is the only red shirt in a dangerous position.\n39:32 Comment: He's heavily outnumbered.\n39:34 Comment: And he is good in the air, but he's not the biggest.\n39:36 Comment: It's got to be a really good ball in for him.\n39:48 Comment: Tumbers away.\n39:52 Comment: Negredo.\n39:54 Comment: Danny Simpson saw that coming.\n40:0 Comment: Morgan.\n40:12 Comment: Hing.\n40:14 Comment: Mahrez, Okazaki...\n40:18 Comment: Lepnitz...\n40:20 Comment: Lovely little shimmy there from Mahrez,\n40:23 Comment: but nothing comes of it, and that's been a familiar theme in this first half.\n40:31 Comment: Mahrez...\n40:33 Comment: Mouriz is down, Mahrez shoots, and Guzman clicks.\n40:37 Comment: Doesn't really get hold of it.\n40:39 Comment: We had Mahrez here, not the contact he's looking for.\n40:42 Comment: And others got support, screaming for a free kick at Ramirez.\n40:51 Comment: Ramirez hurt whilst all that was going on.\n40:53 Comment: Well, it was Mendy who came through, took plenty of the ball here, Mendy.\n40:59 Comment: Gets it cleanly.\n41:12 Comment: GERRARD GARCIA, FANS ROAR\n41:19 Comment: Ramirez not requiring... attention.\n41:25 Comment: The last Premier League meeting between these teams here\n41:28 Comment: was way back in 2004, and it finished 3-3.\n41:37 Comment: We might be a bit hopeful of reaching such heights today.\n41:42 Comment: But I don't think it's seasonaks that are orÂêó?\n41:45 Comment: But I think in the next two months, ¬øHaz que alcanzas a que deja que tenemos m√°s que eso?\n41:54 Comment: what does thatÔøΩo?\n41:56 Comment: It's waiting for a break.\n42:4 Comment: F peur.\n42:7 Comment: Fabian...\n42:8 Comment: I can understand that, it all came from Traore, when Fabio goes by him on that side, he can't afford to lose the ball, and by doing so he's taken both of them out of the game, and you can understand why Ben Gibson has made that challenge.\n42:25 Comment: Gibson joins Ramirez in the book.\n42:38 Comment: Fuchs to Walter Joa, away by Chambers, Mahrez can't connect.\n43:8 Comment: Bobby Huntley is going to bring that back, he's not ready, he's not ready, it can't happen.\n43:38 Comment: Ramirez, shadowed by Huth, and that's always an issue.\n43:54 Comment: Dubron.\n43:57 Comment: It's over the head of Traore.\n44:1 Comment: Final minutes of the first half.\n44:4 Comment: What many glimpses of goal?\n44:6 Comment: No, I don't think we've had a clean chance yet.\n44:8 Comment: Simpson,\n44:30 Comment: here's Mendy,\n44:38 Comment: Thank you.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: of this Premier League season.\n0:2 Comment: So far today at the Riverside, both teams have been rather short of inspiration.\n0:7 Comment: Yeah, I mean, I think at the risk of stating the obvious,\n0:9 Comment: Leicester do miss the pace of Jamie Vardy.\n0:12 Comment: You know, when Vardy plays, they stretch teams, they turn centre-backs.\n0:17 Comment: That hasn't been the case today.\n0:18 Comment: Ulloa much more inclined to come towards the ball,\n0:21 Comment: and it's been pretty easy for the two middles for centre-backs so far.\n0:25 Comment: Vardy, by the way, completing his three-match ban today.\n0:30 Comment: Leicester hoping to start the second half with a bang here.\n0:37 Comment: Christian Fuchs with that long throw.\n0:43 Comment: Talked with by Gibson.\n0:45 Comment: He's on his way again, Adama Traore.\n0:48 Comment: Negredo looking for the switch to Ramirez, but Mahrez was there.\n0:56 Comment: Here he is again.\n1:0 Comment: Ramirez grounded.\n1:4 Comment: Middlesbrough fail to make the most of it, as Foreshaw gives it away.\n1:16 Comment: It's got to be better than that.\n1:17 Comment: The ball forward here from Danny Simpson.\n1:22 Comment: Both teams made five changes from their matches a couple of days ago,\n1:27 Comment: and Middlesbrough were forced to make a change in the first half,\n1:30 Comment: as well, when Antonio Barrahan pulled a hamstring.\n1:33 Comment: George Friend on in his place, and Fabio here switching across to right-back.\n1:43 Comment: Tony Drinkwater was given a rest by Leicester today,\n1:46 Comment: and Isla Slimani is going on well.\n1:54 Comment: Friend.\n1:56 Comment: Ramirez.\n2:0 Comment: And they link up again, those two.\n2:4 Comment: Ramirez not sure which way to turn.\n2:9 Comment: Fabio.\n2:12 Comment: Traore.\n2:16 Comment: Up against Fuchs.\n2:17 Comment: Again, he makes room.\n2:18 Comment: That's better.\n2:20 Comment: But Simpson cleared it.\n2:24 Comment: It's George Friend.\n2:25 Comment: And plenty of power, but stopped by Spalding.\n2:28 Comment: Yes, he's short.\n2:29 Comment: And Kasper Schmeichel should say, but the lead-up is pretty good here from the middle.\n2:32 Comment: But good bowling from Traore, who once again is quick enough to get down the outside\n2:37 Comment: and get a much better cross in.\n2:39 Comment: That is never going to be a problem for Kasper Schmeichel,\n2:42 Comment: but better start here from the home side.\n2:45 Comment: We've had a shot on target.\n2:46 Comment: That's a start in the second half.\n2:51 Comment: Mendy.\n2:53 Comment: Simpson.\n2:55 Comment: Kazaki making a run to the right, but it's gone to Ojoa first.\n2:59 Comment: And last.\n3:4 Comment: Fabio urging Traore to move ahead.\n3:12 Comment: What's coming next from Adama Traore?\n3:15 Comment: Blocked by Fuchs.\n3:17 Comment: Very hard about help there because Amap is over as well.\n3:20 Comment: Mendy and Fuchs could drop a little bit.\n3:23 Comment: Deliberately showed Traore the outside there,\n3:26 Comment: but it is a real hand.\n3:27 Comment: Politic can get one-on-one with...\n3:29 Comment: with Fuchs.\n3:30 Comment: Middlesbrough might yet get something.\n3:45 Comment: Middlesbrough hoping this corner will cap.\n3:48 Comment: And here it is.\n3:49 Comment: It comes back to the Uruguayan.\n3:55 Comment: Oh!\n4:0 Comment: Clayton on Mahrez, and that has been the story for most of this game.\n4:4 Comment: He really has squeezed Mahrez's space today.\n4:7 Comment: He enforced shot.\n4:10 Comment: I just wonder if Mahrez will go the distance.\n4:13 Comment: He's playing in a position where they've tried to free him up to influence the game,\n4:16 Comment: but so far,\n4:20 Comment: it's been a pretty lean afternoon for him.\n4:23 Comment: Foreshot.\n4:29 Comment: He's over back on his feet, and he was hurt there.\n4:34 Comment: Here is Friend.\n4:37 Comment: Derone.\n4:44 Comment: Ramirez.\n4:49 Comment: Clayton.\n4:50 Comment: Logredo.\n4:52 Comment: Traore.\n4:59 Comment: He tried to Fabio to whip that in, but straight to Schmeichel.\n5:2 Comment: It's not the worst.\n5:3 Comment: I mean, Kasper Schmeichel is always favourite to win it,\n5:6 Comment: but, you know,\n5:6 Comment: Negredo's not making any movement at all towards the front post.\n5:11 Comment: You could argue this isn't the best ball in,\n5:13 Comment: but look at Negredo.\n5:17 Comment: Absolutely no intention of getting across the front.\n5:20 Comment: Decent take from Ojoa.\n5:22 Comment: Mendy.\n5:29 Comment: Mahrez for Mendy.\n5:32 Comment: And again.\n5:37 Comment: Andy King.\n5:39 Comment: Simpson.\n5:41 Comment: Locked by Ramirez.\n5:59 Comment: George Friend should be able to deal with that.\n6:2 Comment: Andy King.\n6:3 Comment: He's actually won it back.\n6:7 Comment: Fabio on hand to clear.\n6:12 Comment: Booted away by Clayton.\n6:17 Comment: Robin Hood conceding the throw.\n6:24 Comment: Mendy.\n6:33 Comment: Tragic.\n6:37 Comment: Try your aim.\n6:45 Comment: Stocks by Huth.\n6:48 Comment: Clayton.\n6:53 Comment: Gibson.\n6:58 Comment: Fabio.\n6:59 Comment: He's had a look for Negredo's whereabouts,\n7:4 Comment: seemed to strike the hand of Amati.\n7:6 Comment: Ramirez!\n7:7 Comment: Found his route blocked, but his triori.\n7:15 Comment: And now Amati could lead a charge out from Leicester.\n7:18 Comment: Mahrez.\n7:29 Comment: FANS ROAR\n7:35 Comment: Derone, Ramirez.\n7:43 Comment: Ramirez seeking out Negredo, but Schmeichel gathers.\n7:47 Comment: That's the right idea.\n7:48 Comment: That's what Schmeichel always favours,\n7:50 Comment: it's a tough angle here by the time Ramirez plays the ball,\n7:53 Comment: and there's very little space to knock the ball into.\n7:58 Comment: I do get the impression,\n7:59 Comment: if the Middlesbrough are to get something,\n8:1 Comment: Ramirez will be involved, for me he's their most productive player.\n8:14 Comment: Middlesbrough botting the ball at the moment.\n8:21 Comment: Mendy.\n8:23 Comment: Dejoa.\n8:25 Comment: Mahrez.\n8:29 Comment: Good pass from Amati.\n8:38 Comment: Simpson covering here.\n8:44 Comment: Middlesbrough won't want to hear this,\n8:46 Comment: but the home side has only won two of the last 13 Premier League meetings\n8:51 Comment: between these two sides.\n8:54 Comment: Leicester with a very recent record against Middlesbrough.\n8:57 Comment: Mahrez.\n9:1 Comment: King ready to send this across.\n9:3 Comment: He evaded Okazaki and Guzan, and Leicester will come back for more.\n9:13 Comment: Dejoa for Amati.\n9:18 Comment: Simpson.\n9:20 Comment: Doesn't reach Dejoa, Gibson made sure of that.\n9:25 Comment: That's one way to scoop it out for Traore, from family.\n9:28 Comment: Mendy.\n9:31 Comment: Mahrez got involved.\n9:33 Comment: Michaelise, Fuchs.\n9:35 Comment: Okazaki.\n9:38 Comment: Andy King is made for the hit.\n9:42 Comment: That's a clear effort from Andy King,\n9:43 Comment: but previous to that he's thrown a delightful ball across the face of the goal.\n9:48 Comment: They get a two-against-one here against George Frenk.\n9:50 Comment: Pass from Mahrez is perfect.\n9:53 Comment: That's a terrific ball in.\n9:56 Comment: Okazaki, the only blue shirt on the six-yard box.\n9:58 Comment: And he had gone to the front post, no-one getting round the back.\n10:3 Comment: First real bit of genuine width that Leicester have shown today.\n10:15 Comment: Agreed.\n10:16 Comment: Xabi.\n10:17 Comment: But Man Ïù¥\n10:22 Comment: Sakado\n10:36 Comment: playful off wits like this is something that Leicester should do.\n10:39 Comment: Personal best, Mendy.\n10:42 Comment: √ñf favor!\n10:43 Comment: Therefore, from Dakar, Pedersen's liked adventure team.\n10:47 Comment: Fabio.\n10:51 Comment: It's Clayton now.\n10:55 Comment: Negredo.\n10:57 Comment: I'm not sure what his plan was there.\n11:1 Comment: Fabio.\n11:5 Comment: Derone.\n11:6 Comment: And Huth will close the door.\n11:9 Comment: They've got to protect it there, Robert Huth.\n11:12 Comment: Pass left, Derone with a lot to do.\n11:17 Comment: I thought it was on the case here and strong enough to see it out.\n11:25 Comment: Huth have lost four of their last five matches.\n11:28 Comment: The exception was a home win over Swansea,\n11:30 Comment: which is pretty much a given three points at the moment.\n11:33 Comment: But it's all Karanka's side.\n11:35 Comment: Four points above the relegation zone for now.\n11:38 Comment: A little too close for comfort.\n11:47 Comment: Ramirez.\n11:54 Comment: Simpson's error, but Wes Morgan helps him out.\n12:8 Comment: Mario Ranieri landing the Premier League title for Leicester.\n12:13 Comment: An extraordinary, heartwarming tale of the unexpected.\n12:17 Comment: Ramirez is blocked off by Simpson.\n12:24 Comment: That was a booking.\n12:27 Comment: I don't like it.\n12:29 Comment: That's a pretty blatant block there.\n12:36 Comment: It's fortunate if he gets away with that, Danny Simpson.\n12:39 Comment: Yeah, just a word of warning for Simpson.\n12:43 Comment: Show of leniency from Bobby Madley.\n12:47 Comment: RamirezÊΩá

in Gray and Albright.\n13:32 Comment: I suppose it depends whether or not Claudio Ranieri\n13:34 Comment: sees a point as a decent result here.\n13:38 Comment: Ojoa, seeing up Mahrez.\n13:41 Comment: But all rather unconvincing,\n13:42 Comment: as many things have been so far this afternoon.\n13:47 Comment: Here's Fabio.\n14:8 Comment: Not much between these two teams at all\n14:10 Comment: as we approach the hour mark at the Riverside.\n14:17 Comment: Both teams aiming to steer a course clear of danger.\n14:27 Comment: Leicester's next three home games, incidentally,\n14:29 Comment: are against Chelsea, Manchester United and Liverpool.\n14:33 Comment: So they might want the maximum points returned from this.\n14:43 Comment: Ramirez.\n14:44 Comment: Negredo.\n14:45 Comment: Will there be an opening here for Middlesbrough?\n14:47 Comment: I never know whether down the trio or it.\n14:51 Comment: Derone.\n14:53 Comment: For sure.\n14:56 Comment: Friend.\n14:57 Comment: Ready to deliver.\n15:0 Comment: Steered away by Fuchs.\n15:2 Comment: Had to knock it on high there, George Friend.\n15:3 Comment: He had a mark to right in his face.\n15:6 Comment: I think he had plenty of left on the cross\n15:7 Comment: and it ended up too deep.\n15:13 Comment: Fabio.\n15:17 Comment: Cleighton.\n15:34 Comment: Chambers.\n15:35 Comment: Fabio.\n15:37 Comment: Traore.\n15:44 Comment: Cleighton now for...\n15:46 Comment: Corsi.\n15:47 Comment: And again, he goes to Friend.\n15:51 Comment: And once again he delivers.\n15:53 Comment: Low this time.\n15:54 Comment: And Christian Fuchs able to clear.\n15:57 Comment: Fabio though, sizing himself up for the shot.\n16:0 Comment: He's trying to cut across that.\n16:3 Comment: He's two months in the middle of the ball there.\n16:5 Comment: But previously, terrific ball in from Josh Fain.\n16:8 Comment: I'm not sure why Wes Morgan misses this at the front post.\n16:11 Comment: He looked reasonably well positioned here.\n16:13 Comment: He doesn't make any attempt to play here.\n16:17 Comment: He's got the ball in the middle of the centre back.\n16:19 Comment: It's too wide of him.\n16:21 Comment: I think what Negredo anticipates that.\n16:23 Comment: He's got a tap in at the back post.\n16:31 Comment: And a Fabio goal from the follow-up would have been unlikely.\n16:33 Comment: He's only ever scored once in the Premier League.\n16:35 Comment: And that was six years ago.\n16:40 Comment: De Roch.\n16:45 Comment: Ramirez.\n16:47 Comment: He scores again.\n16:50 Comment: Nice job, honouring that in the being

Comment: Fabio.\n19:39 Comment: And a good well-structured run there for Leicester.\n19:42 Comment: He crossed in there from Fabio when he got onto the touchline there.\n19:47 Comment: Let's see if he

    "summary": "At the Riverside Stadium, Middlesbrough and Leicester City faced off in a Premier League clash that ultimately concluded without a goal, maintaining a goalless draw of 0-0. Despite the lack of goals, both teams' tactical maneuvers, defensive fortitude, and sporadic attacking forays made for a gripping encounter. \n\n**First Half:**\n\nThe opening minutes set the pace for a tense affair. Both teams seemed keen to make a statement, with Leicester looking to end their away woes and Middlesbrough desperate to fortify their home record. Leicester‚Äôs unusual formation deviation was noticeable early on. Riyad Mahrez, typically a winger, was positioned more centrally alongside Shinji Okazaki, who was playing in a slightly advanced role 'in the hole' behind the attackers. This tactical choice piqued curiosity and lent an air of unpredictability to Leicester‚Äôs play.\n\nMiddlesbrough, however, seemed uncompromising at the back, with defenders Ben Gibson and Callum Chambers effectively negating Leicester's early advances. Early on, Adama Traore displayed his flair and speed, often looking threatening when running at Christian Fuchs. His rapid acceleration and attempts to get past his marker earned him admiration, though his final delivery occasionally fell short.\n\nFabio‚Äôs positioning at left-back saw him replace George Friend, adding stability to Middlesbrough's defensive line. The match witnessed several noteworthy defensive efforts. Robert Huth and Wes Morgan were a commanding presence for Leicester, consistently outmuscling Negredo, who often found himself isolated and heavily marked.\n\nMidfield battles were intense with Adam Clayton being particularly troublesome for Leicester. His robust challenges and strategic fouls often interrupted Leicester's rhythm, highlighting the gritty nature of the contest. Leicester‚Äôs Andy King and Nampalys Mendy were active in midfield, striving to push the ball forward, yet Middlesbrough‚Äôs defense held firm.\n\nOne of the best moments for Middlesbrough came from a skillful move involving Gaston Ramirez. A lovely pass from Fabio found Ramirez in a good position, but his uncharacteristic heavy touch allowed Wes Morgan to intervene and clear the threat. Negredo was often seen trying to get on the end of passes and deliver quick flick-ons, but the presence of Huth and Morgan ensured he had few clear opportunities.\n\nSet-pieces presented potential moments of danger for both teams. For instance, Mahrez‚Äôs well-floated free-kick into the box found Okazaki, but the attempt was seen off by Middlesbrough‚Äôs organized defense. Middlesbrough‚Äôs crosses frequently targeted Negredo, but Leicester‚Äôs central defenders were vigilant, clearing the dangers effectively.\n\nTraore‚Äôs dynamic runs down the right kept Fuchs busy, but his lack of precise final balls meant Middlesbrough‚Äôs chances went begging. However, it wasn't just Middlesbrough who struggled upfront. Leicester missed the sharp, speedy runs of the suspended Jamie Vardy, making their attacks more predictable and easier for Middlesbrough to handle.\n\nThe defensive resilience continued to be the story of the half. A decent opportunity for Mahrez emerged when he received a pass in space, but his subsequent shot was weak and easily collected by Brad Guzan. The half ended with neither team able to break the deadlock, highlighting the strengths and limitations of both sides‚Äô attacking and defensive setups.\n\n**Second Half:**\n\nThe second half began with Leicester attempting to start strongly, with Christian Fuchs‚Äô long throw-ins causing momentary panic in Middlesbrough's area. Nevertheless, it was Middlesbrough who came closest initially, with Traore delivering an improved cross, though Kasper Schmeichel comfortably smothered the effort.\n\nMiddlesbrough‚Äôs attacks continued primarily through Traore‚Äôs flanks, complemented by contributions from Fabio and Friend. Fabio, after switching sides following Baraghan‚Äôs hamstring injury, showed his defensive mettle and willingness to advance, though Schmeichel frequently intercepted their efforts.\n\nAn enterprising full-back display from George Friend was commendable, with the left-back often looking to cut inside and distribute the ball. Despite their best efforts, Middlesbrough‚Äôs final balls repeatedly lacked the incisiveness required to penetrate Leicester‚Äôs sturdy defense.\n\nLeicester, meanwhile, introduced Ahmed Musa for Mahrez, aiming to inject pace into their attack. Musa‚Äôs arrival added a new dimension, yet chances remained sparse. Andy King managed to deliver a cross that Okazaki failed to convert, typifying Leicester‚Äôs struggle upfront.\n\nIn a game of few clear-cut opportunities, perhaps the best chance fell to Gaston Ramirez, who, after breaking into the box following a loose ball from Morgan, volleyed just wide, squandering Middlesbrough‚Äôs best opportunity. Similarly, Friend‚Äôs daring runs and deliveries went unrewarded due to the lack of clinical finishing.\n\nAs the game drew on, tempers flared slightly. Clayton, persistent with his physical approach, received a yellow card for a late challenge on Musa, adding to tension on the pitch. The closing stages saw Leicester try to launch rapid counters, with Musa leading promising charges but failing to link up effectively with Okazaki and Ulloa.\n\nLate in the game, downing was subbed on for Forshaw in an attempt to seize control of the midfield. Middlesbrough drove their attacks through Friend, with Ramirez and Traore both working tirelessly to find a breakthrough, yet Huth‚Äôs and Morgan‚Äôs solid partnership repeatedly thwarted them. Ramirez had a golden opportunity late on to settle the game, receiving an excellent cross from Friend but failing to direct his header on target.\n\nIn stoppage time, Middlesbrough pushed desperately for a winner. Friend's effort, another sign of his enduring persistence and attacking support, ended with another excellent cross that nobody could capitalize on. Leicester, for their part, managed a last-minute break through Musa and Albrighton, but Chambers‚Äô solid defending kept the Leicester substitute‚Äôs effort from converting.\n\nThe final moments encapsulated the match aptly ‚Äì robust defenses nullifying occasionally lively but lacking attacks, and the referee's final whistle confirmed the goalless draw. A game characterized by tactical defensive displays, physical midfields, and caution in offensive play, had both teams share the spoils, leaving both to reflect on missed opportunities and the need for sharper attacking edges in the future."
