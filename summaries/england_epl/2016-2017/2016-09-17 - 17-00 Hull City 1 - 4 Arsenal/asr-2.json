its atoms.\n17:38 Comment: He spoke with great respect at the pre-match press conference about the Gunners, about Barsin Vilger.\n17:45 Comment: But he said that we will fight to the end.\n17:49

at the last moment.\n18:2 Comment: I didn't miss another goal.\n18:4 Comment: Look how rudely Robertson plays, makes mistakes and corrects his own mistakes.\n18:13 Comment: Sanchez has already dealt,

hint that it’s here even before the impact\n44:20 Comment: several players burst into the penalty area.\n44:23 Comment: And Kupovich reacted great, although again he said\n44:32 Comment: that Alexis Sanchez's 11-meter shot was not the best.\n44:37 Comment: Kozorlo.\n44:38 Comment: Amiso Tuziu.\n44:40 Comment: Kozorlo.\n44:42 Comment: It’s clear that the gunners are now...\n44:45 Comment: They

maybe there was a push from the Chilean.\n19:38 Comment: Well, the minimum is just a touch on Maguire.\n19:42 Comment: Apparently, he felt it and fell.\n19:44 Comment: Fell?\n19:46 Comment: Fell beautifully.\n19:47 Comment: Maybe not beautiful, but convincing.\n19:49 Comment: What is important for an arbitrator?\n19:51 Comment: Free kick.\n19:53 Comment: But Grass will knock you down, of course.\n19:55 Comment: But from his feet, Grass can play along.\n19:57 Comment: But from his feet, Grass can shoot on target.\n19:59 Comment: So I sneeze.\n20:0 Comment: You need to be alert.\n20:5 Comment: Well, it's quite a distance to the gate.\n20:7 Comment: About 30 meters, probably.\n20:9 Comment: Well, something like that.\n20:11 Comment: Off your feet Grass.\n20:12 Comment: The goal hits

Lucas Perez Martinez. 28 years.\n43:41 Comment: Number nine.\n43:44 Comment: So Arsene Benger is trying.\n43:47 Comment: He is trying to marry, if you like, competition in the front line.\n43:54 Comment: But Olivier Geroux received a slight injury,\n43:59 Comment: that's why he wasn't even included in the list today,\n44:3 Comment: in the application for this match.\n44:8 Comment: 90th

Hull, clad in their black and amber kits, set a solid defensive line but were also vigilant, waiting to seize any counter-attacking opportunities.\n\nThroughout the initial ten minutes, Arsenal's midfield duo, Francis Coquelin and Santi Cazorla, executed their roles with deftness, initiating rapid, intricate passes that often involved their wings. Hector Bellerin, the right-back bursting with pace, made significant progress up the flank, often exchanging the ball with Theo Walcott. Alexis Sanchez, the Chilean forward known for his incisive runs and sharp shooting, was constantly on the lookout for opportunities to breach Hull's defense.\n\nHull City, despite struggling to maintain consistent possession, showed resilience. Adama Diomande and Abel Hernandez made sporadic forward movements, attempting to break Arsenal’s rhythm. However, it was clear that Arsenal was the more fluid and coherent side, progressively pushing the game deeper into Hull’s territory.\n\nThe breakthrough arrived in the 17th minute; Alexis Sanchez found the net after a series of intricate passes and rebounds that saw the ball initially hit Alex Iwobi before brushing against Sanchez en route to goal. Although it appeared a touch fortuitous, the strike was credited to Sanchez, thus injecting Arsenal with a deserved lead.\n\nSoon after the first goal, Hull City found themselves in a precarious situation when Jake Livermore was shown a red card for a deliberate handball inside the box. This decision left Hull down to ten men, adding a significant burden to their already tough task of contending against a buoyant Arsenal. Alexis Sanchez took the resultant penalty, but what could have been a defining moment for Arsenal turned into an inspiring save for Hull. Eldin Jakupovic, Hull’s Bosnian-Swiss goalkeeper, guessed correctly and parried Sanchez’s strike, injecting a dose of hope and defiance into the Hull ranks.\n\nDespite the setback, Arsenal maintained their pressing style, continuously probing Hull’s defense. Their persistence bore fruit in the 55th minute. In a move epitomizing Arsenal’s slick combination play, Theo Walcott netted his 150th career goal. The move, orchestrated by a stellar backheel assist from Iwobi, showcased Arsenal's tactical excellence. Walcott’s finish was clinical, giving Jakupovic no chance.\n\nHull, however, abated any thoughts of submission and kept fighting valiantly. The introduction of the powerful forward, Mbokani, added a new dimension to their attack. This shift reacquired Hull's energy upfront, creating more pressing forays into Arsenal's half. Their persistence was rewarded in the 79th minute when Arsenal’s goalkeeper, Petr Cech, conceded a penalty following an aggressive challenge on Mbokani. A lenient call by the linesman led to the penalty being awarded, which Robert Snodgrass converted with aplomb, making it 2-1 and reigniting the contest.\n\nYet, Arsenal's counter-response was swift and ruthless. Just minutes later, Alexis Sanchez sealed Hull’s fate with another blistering goal, securing his brace for the evening. Sanchez's rapid turn and precise shot into the top corner epitomized his world-class attributes, restoring Arsenal’s two-goal cushion and effectively quelling Hull’s resurgence.\n\nAs the clock rolled towards full time, Arsenal's Granit Xhaka added an exclamation point to their victory with a truly stunning strike from distance. The Swiss midfielder, who had come on as a substitute, unleashed a thunderous shot from outside the box that soared into the net, leaving Jakupovic and the Hull fans in sheer admiration. This phenomenal goal, Xhaka’s first in the Premier League, punctuated an exceptional Arsenal performance.\n\nIn the dying moments of the match, despite some sporadic attacks from Hull, Arsenal maintained possession and saw out the game with composure. The final whistle confirmed a comprehensive 4-1 victory for the Gunners, a result that lifted them into a favorable position on the league table, illustrating their potential as title contenders.\n\nPost-match reflections revealed several key aspects: Arsenal's dominance in midfield, relentless attacking vigor, and tactical versatility were evident throughout the 90 minutes. Hull, though outclassed, displayed moments of determination and resilience, particularly Jakupovic’s penalty save and Snodgrass's well-taken penalty.\n\nMike Phelan, the Hull City manager, who had recently been awarded the Manager of the Month for August, faced the harsh realities of Premier League’s demands but could take solace in his team’s fighting spirit against a superior Arsenal side. Conversely, Arsenal’s Arsène Wenger would be pleased with his team’s performance, particularly the contributions from Sanchez, Iwobi, and Xhaka, as they continue their pursuit of Premier League glory.\n\nArsenal’s next fixtures include an English League Cup tie followed by a major Premier League clash against Chelsea, promising further tests of their squad depth and ambitions. Hull City, with a robust schedule ahead, including a match against Liverpool, will hope to regroup and rally as they continue their campaign in the top flight.\n\nIn conclusion, the contest at the KCOM Stadium was a testament to the unpredictable and exhilarating nature of the Premier League, highlighted by moments of brilliance, tactical nuance, and uncompromising drama that enthralled the viewers from start to finish."
