under the front foot.\n0:7 Comment: That's clearly what they need to do to get this crowd behind them straight away.\n0:12 Comment: Yeah, they've got to start well and they can be aware of a very quick Liverpool start as well.\n0:16 Comment: Liverpool blew Spurs away in that first half 16 days ago.\n0:20 Comment: We can expect more of the same, I think, from Jurgen Klopp's side tonight.\n0:24 Comment: So Leicester are going to have to match that tempo.\n0:26 Comment: An immediate stoppage here.\n0:30 Comment: We can see why.\n0:34 Comment: Vardy did well to keep the ball alive.\n0:37 Comment: The ball was overcooked to him.\n0:39 Comment: He just followed through there on Mane.\n0:43 Comment: Well, certainly there to be won.\n0:46 Comment: To follow through that causes the problem for the Liverpool striker.\n0:51 Comment: Vardy's always going to contest that.\n0:52 Comment: Gets a bit of the ball but certainly got a bit of Mane as well.\n0:59 Comment: That's what I'm

season\n3:20 Comment: Hoof hasn't scored for a year in fact\n3:22 Comment: and Morgan has only got two himself\n3:24 Comment: Goals\n3:27 Comment: Goals have been in short supply all over the field\n3:30 Comment: All Brighton with the kick\n3:34 Comment: who was he meted at the back post heading into a dangerous area\n3:37 Comment: but the flag was gone up anyway\n3:39 Comment: offside to Burnley\n3:40 Comment: Did well to get round the back though Robert Hoof\n3:42 Comment: Liverpool marking zones there\n3:44 Comment: one touch tie\n3:46 Comment: and Hoof just peels off at the back\n3:49 Comment: made a nice angle\n3:51 Comment: two line offside there\n3:53 Comment: Mahrez given offside for taking part but\n3:55 Comment: Hoof found plenty of room there though\n3:56 Comment: Hoof found plenty of room there\n3:58 Comment: Leicester have lost their last five Premier League games now without even scoring\n4:2 Comment: and just one win in the last ten\n4:4 Comment: that was on New Year's Eve\n4:6 Comment: when they beat West Ham\n4:8 Comment: Hardly going in strongly\n4:10 Comment: for Clyne\n4:12 Comment: focus across on the cover here for Liverpool\n4:14 Comment: they still have\n4:16 Comment: Lovren out injured\n4:18 Comment: so Lucas has been doing an excellent job as a stand-in central defender\n4:22 Comment: in the season when it looks as though his Liverpool career might be over\n4:26 Comment: after nearly ten years of downfield\n4:33 Comment: long throw perhaps for Liverpool to deal with\n4:39 Comment: Maddon's come forward as well amongst others\n4:41 Comment: and it was a good reaction\n4:43 Comment: by the keeper\n4:45 Comment: Mignolet\n4:47 Comment: again Robert Hoof is the target here\n4:49 Comment: Okazaki's making a nuisance of himself in front of him\n4:52 Comment: Mignolet\n4:53 Comment: goalkeeper had to react\n4:56 Comment: and that's happening as well\n4:58 Comment: and now they're out kitted in the middle of the field\n5:4 Comment: they haven't got Mignolet on the ball yet\n5:7 Comment: and right now\n5:8 Comment: the flag has gone up against them\n5:9 Comment: three feet to Leicester\n5:10 Comment: it looks ok though Alan\n5:12 Comment: looks as if he's moving quite freely\n5:14 Comment: took a real sermon off Jimmy Vardy but\n5:16 Comment: it looks alright\n5:18 Comment: Goal!

him out\n5:51 Comment: and a poor ball by the Leicester man\n5:55 Comment: And they couldn't get round the second challenge.\n6:0 Comment: Albrighton wins the third.\n6:10 Comment: There's Morgan coming forward.\n6:14 Comment: Cooper stayed back this time.\n6:15 Comment: And Didi and that group of players once more.\n6:26 Comment: The miss is shot.\n6:28 Comment: However, they've brought the best out of Simon Mignolet.\n6:32 Comment: That's a really good effort from Okazaki.\n6:34 Comment: He's got to generate all the power that has been brought in from behind them.\n6:40 Comment: Second corner in quick succession then for the home side.\n6:44 Comment: And certainly at the moment,\n6:45 Comment: the crowd fully behind them.\n6:55 Comment: Albrighton with the kick this time.\n7:6 Comment: Okazaki, who's played within the width of the six-yard vault so far,\n7:9 Comment: but he's played off the left side at the moment.\n7:12 Comment: He's got a lot to do there.\n7:13 Comment: He's having to generate all the power there.\n7:15 Comment: Decent effort.\n7:18 Comment: Been in and out of the side this season.\n7:20 Comment: The Japan international first to control that ball.\n7:23 Comment: One of them, however, giving it away to who?\n7:30 Comment: Clyde.\n7:32 Comment: Looking for Firmino down the center.\n7:35 Comment: He's off goal.\n7:36 Comment: He isn't attacking forces yet.\n7:42 Comment: One of our favorites, of course.\n7:43 Comment: But the four league games they've lost this season.\n7:45 Comment: All 10 of them have changed in the bottom half of the table.\n7:49 Comment: So there will certainly be no complacency on their part.\n7:54 Comment: Tadeu Mane took a bad challenge in the opening stages,\n7:57 Comment: but he gave one out here on Ndidi.\n8:2 Comment: Down the inside of his foot there.\n8:6 Comment: Maybe Ndidi's paid the bill there for Jamie Vardy.\n8:11 Comment: Ndidi on the far side.\n8:14 Comment: He'll pick that up.\n8:15 Comment: Beautiful ball.\n8:18 Comment: He's going to defend.\n8:21 Comment: Mane.\n8:24 Comment: Liverpool have got four forward in this attack for the first time.\n8:28 Comment: Including Firmino.\n8:32 Comment: All of them poised in the center, but it never reached him.\n8:38 Comment: Lucas.\n8:40 Comment: He hooks it on.\n8:43 Comment: Coutinho.\n8:45 Comment: It's dangerous to show him inside like that.\n8:47 Comment: He scored some screamers over the years in those kind of positions.\n8:51 Comment: Here's Lucas.\n8:52 Comment: That's it.\n8:57 Comment: Mane.\n9:3 Comment: Mane calling for possession on the Liverpool left, and Lallana finds him.\n9:7 Comment: Mane.\n9:13 Comment: and was there again\n9:17 Comment: still chasing shadows at the moment\n9:27 Comment: that's it\n9:28 Comment: neatly done by the central defender\n9:31 Comment: and the ball finds Klein\n9:32 Comment: good build up play and a good ball as well\n9:39 Comment: Liverpool get their first corner\n9:41 Comment: thanks to Morgan's interception\n9:43 Comment: well they built it on the right hand side\n9:44 Comment: but I think Mahrez initially has to do better\n9:46 Comment: sold himself instead of staying goal side\n9:49 Comment: all of a sudden Liverpool have men over\n9:52 Comment: very good ball in\n9:53 Comment: as Morgan managed to cut it out\n9:56 Comment: but Mahrez whatever side of the pitch he's playing on\n9:58 Comment: has to get himself goal side quicker\n10:1 Comment: that was first corner\n10:5 Comment: and the second now\n10:10 Comment: couldn't go to dealing with that\n10:13 Comment: butique\n10:15 Comment: przez four minutes\n10:17 Comment: and the Juve behind Monaco\n10:20 Comment: for wayns\n10:23 Comment: 지만\n10:24 Comment: Melo\n10:26 Comment: アム\n10:27 Comment: butique\n10:30 Comment: and in time\n10:32 Comment: taking the ball\n10:36 Comment: the ball\n10:37 Comment: favourite\n10:42 Comment: He's certainly got his neck into the header.\n10:45 Comment: Little nods there on Robert Hughes\n10:47 Comment: to take the Leicester player under the ball.\n10:50 Comment: There's plenty on it.\n10:56 Comment: Just one goal so far in his Liverpool career for Joel Matip.\n11:0 Comment: Enjoying a long run in the team now after injury problems.\n11:4 Comment: And, of course, Liverpool had that dispute with Cameroon\n11:6 Comment: over his current refusal to play in the Africa Cup of Nations.\n11:12 Comment: And...\n11:13 Comment: Hooks looking for Vardy down the centre.\n11:18 Comment: Liverpool with only two dangerous passes\n11:20 Comment: just in front of their own penalty area.\n11:24 Comment: And now Hughes is out to Ndidi.\n11:28 Comment: This was gone from referee Michael Oliver.\n11:31 Comment: Liverpool's free kick.\n11:32 Comment: Got his work cut out so far, Michael Oliver.\n11:35 Comment: Pretty tasty so far.\n11:38 Comment: Probably what you'd expect given Leicester's current position.\n11:42 Comment: Who clears?\n11:56 Comment: Only a lone figure at the moment.\n11:58 Comment: Paul Leicester inside the Liverpool half.\n12:6 Comment: Matip gets his foot right underneath the clearance.\n12:8 Comment: Valerian Cutt.\n12:12 Comment: He'll make a pass.\n12:13 Comment: Clever play by Hawkins.\n12:15 Comment: Here skating chance now.\n12:22 Comment: 1 free kick for Al Mission.\n12:24 Comment: 7 in the far left.\n12:27 Comment: ergonomic discovery into theakter semble he scored.\n12:30 Comment: Here End 재� Миánd nine times.\n12:33 Comment: Madrid on the home court.\n12:36 Comment: A hand there by Ramone Rashford.\n12:37 Comment: Winner going again.\n12:38 Comment: quickly closing down Mignolet Simpson Lucas is there again now Wijnaldum\n12:51 Comment: Coutinho\n12:58 Comment: just took his eyes off the ball and that was enough for Leicester to regain possession\n13:4 Comment: Vardy ahead of him, Mahrez to the right\n13:7 Comment: free kick\n13:10 Comment: Chan angry with the referee\n13:12 Comment: that's a really good reverse ball from Mark Albright to get Okazaki into space\n13:16 Comment: he's trying to get his body across to the front of Chan there\n13:21 Comment: Chan coming into the side because Henderson is out injured\n13:27 Comment: Mahrez\n13:32 Comment: got one in and won impressively\n13:34 Comment: and Wijnaldum with a corner for last night\n13:36 Comment: it's going to be a good cut to Mahrez, Liverpool doubling up every time the ball is swiped if they've got two against them\n13:41 Comment: two banking up on them\n13:50 Comment: here's a combination of Morgan and Hoof in and around the penalty spot area\n13:57 Comment: Hoof in particular a difficult man to deal with from these set pieces\n14:2 Comment: really attacked that one\n14:4 Comment: he might fairly sure have done better there Robert Hoof\n14:7 Comment: he's timed his run perfectly to the back post\n14:13 Comment: gets a free run at it\n14:16 Comment: Liverpool marking zones here\n14:19 Comment: and it allows Hoof a real good run at the ball\n14:22 Comment: should do better I think\n14:29 Comment: Lucas is going to be careful with this one\n14:31 Comment: and was\n14:34 Comment: Matip\n14:43 Comment: and that\n14:48 Comment: and in with the early ball\n14:50 Comment: Giacomini\n14:59 Comment: and in space on the Liverpool right here he is\n15:2 Comment: Matip\n15:4 Comment: you can ask me to get really\n15:25 Comment: he's Lucas Coutinho to the ball for Milner until choices ahead of him\n15:47 Comment: three in the box manager's not quite sure who he's looking for there\n15:56 Comment: big month ahead for Jurgen Klopp three of Liverpool's next four games are at Anfield\n16:1 Comment: including home games against Arsenal and Everton with a trip to Manchester City\n16:6 Comment: the running away game could be a month that defines their season\n16:17 Comment: he thought it was gonna be a lesser throw\n16:30 Comment: Wijnaldum\n16:47 Comment: 17 minutes here\n17:1 Comment: that's the last goal in the Premier League\n17:3 Comment: another free kick for Liverpool\n17:8 Comment: I think they might have been for the first challenge there indeed they made\n17:13 Comment: that's why he's in the centre of midfield for Leicester\n17:17 Comment: I think they might have been for the first challenge there indeed they made\n17:17 Comment: up\n17:19 Comment: he's given for that\n17:21 Comment: I think they're one that will try to allow it to breathe\n17:24 Comment: Coutinho\n17:28 Comment: goal kick\n17:32 Comment: he's admitted\n17:42 Comment: into that\n17:43 Comment: international matchday programme\n17:45 Comment: but he's one year\n17:46 Comment: he's the most\n17:47 Comment: good player\n17:47 Comment: but he's the most good player\n17:48 Comment: in the world\n17:48 Comment: he's the most good player\n17:48 Comment: and that's the first big thing\n17:49 Comment: in the World Cup\n17:49 Comment: I think it's been a very difficult decision they've had to make in their seven years at the club\n17:50 Comment: they say they don't expect everyone to understand why they've made it\n17:54 Comment: and they know that some people are angry about it\n17:56 Comment: but they think it's for the best for the future of Leicester City\n17:59 Comment: and eyelashes\n18:1 Comment: and there's Kean there\n18:3 Comment: the director of football\n18:3 Comment: the man who had to deliver the bad news to Ranieri\n18:6 Comment: Lucas\n18:12 Comment: and he's a good player\n18:16 Comment: Lucas\n18:17 Comment: and he's a good player\n18:17 Comment: Here's Milne.\n18:21 Comment: Coutinho booted to it by Simpson.\n18:27 Comment: Firmino.\n18:31 Comment: This chap, climbing to his right.\n18:35 Comment: He's gone instead, looking for Coutinho.\n18:37 Comment: Simpson knew he was there.\n18:39 Comment: He had to conceive the format.\n18:41 Comment: He thought he could do it, Simon.\n18:43 Comment: Simon wasn't going to try and find Casper Schmeichel\n18:45 Comment: He thought he could do it, Simon.\n18:47 Comment: A cushioned header here.\n18:49 Comment: Takes the right option, gets it behind.\n18:51 Comment: Gives him a chance to get organised.\n19:1 Comment: Matip has joined the rest.\n19:3 Comment: In the penalty area, Schmeichel with a good, strong hand on the ball.\n19:15 Comment: A good ball.\n19:19 Comment: He had to go off anyway for the half-side.\n19:23 Comment: What have you made of this opening 20 minutes, David?\n19:25 Comment: I think we expected loads of energy from both sides,\n19:29 Comment: but we could argue that Leicester\n19:31 Comment: have started to break it up to two\n19:33 Comment: without really making a chance.\n19:35 Comment: Could have won now, though.\n19:37 Comment: Vardy!\n19:39 Comment: Liverpool just about get away with it.\n19:43 Comment: A deserved better Jimmy Vardy.\n19:45 Comment: for the first touch.\n19:46 Comment: It's a wonderful first touch here\n19:50 Comment: to buy him the shooting opportunity.\n19:52 Comment: Terrific touch.\n19:55 Comment: What a chance.\n20:10 Comment: Variation on the corner routine.\n20:12 Comment: And now he'll have to think again about it.\n20:20 Comment: He scored against Sevilla, his first goal in 10,\n20:23 Comment: but he's only managed one in his last 18\n20:26 Comment: Premier League games, Jamie Vardy.\n20:32 Comment: His climb for Liverpool.\n20:36 Comment: Mane.\n20:37 Comment: He's going to give it away so cheaply.\n20:43 Comment: He's there again.\n20:50 Comment: Jamie Vardy won't feel he should have scored to him.\n20:52 Comment: He did well with the first touch.\n20:54 Comment: Matip helped it up into the air.\n20:56 Comment: And on the volley, it's a great chance to put Leicester ahead.\n21:1 Comment: A little bit more time than he realised there.\n21:3 Comment: Snatched that out a little bit.\n21:5 Comment: Great chance, guys.\n21:7 Comment: He's got it.\n21:8 Comment: Outside flag.\n21:9 Comment: Holding another Leicester attack.\n21:19 Comment: Graphic tells the story so far.\n21:22 Comment: Liverpool really haven't got started yet.\n21:31 Comment: 16 days in our crowded season\n21:33 Comment: is quite a long break as well for them, of course.\n21:37 Comment: Maybe a little bit rusty.\n21:43 Comment: There's actually maybe one in the middle here for Leicester,\n21:45 Comment: but it's going to be hard to find him.\n21:48 Comment: APPLAUSE\n22:5 Comment: That's indeed it.\n22:18 Comment: Mokazaki just beaten to it,\n22:19 Comment: but it's another Leicester throw\n22:21 Comment: and a little nearer the Liverpool penalty line.\n22:23 Comment: A chance to put Robert Hutt up again.\n22:25 Comment: He's the one they're trying to hit with the throw.\n22:28 Comment: APPLAUSE\n22:35 Comment: and it comes again from Christian Fuchs\n22:44 Comment: a little flatter this time\n22:45 Comment: I think the referee decided he fouled\n22:50 Comment: gives him a great target\n22:53 Comment: gets a little bit too much on that\n22:54 Comment: but he's such a good presence in the six yard box\n22:56 Comment: I can see why they're trying to find him from the throne\n23:0 Comment: a little flip there by Coutinho\n23:3 Comment: Firmino unable to get it under control\n23:6 Comment: good ball there was Morgan\n23:8 Comment: he was the only Leicester player to start every Premier League game for them\n23:12 Comment: in this traumatic season\n23:15 Comment: good ball from Mbidi\n23:26 Comment: Brighton looking for Vardy down the centre\n23:28 Comment: and that is with the clearance\n23:32 Comment: for Brighton\n23:36 Comment: and it's been nicked away from Gritwater\n23:40 Comment: he committed the foul\n23:41 Comment: in an attempt to win it back\n23:43 Comment: but he can get on with it quickly\n23:46 Comment: Enwey Chan\n23:47 Comment: Mane\n23:48 Comment: chance to run up Fuchs\n23:50 Comment: Coutinho\n23:58 Comment: Mbidi with the score by the back of the car back there\n24:2 Comment: didn't like the challenge that followed\n24:4 Comment: but the referee saw nothing wrong\n24:6 Comment: here's Lucas\n24:9 Comment: onto Milner\n24:11 Comment: Mane\n24:17 Comment: Milner\n24:20 Comment: Chan\n24:26 Comment: Klein\n24:28 Comment: Far Open\n24:35 Comment: Opel consequentially\n24:40 Comment: he was fouled by the referee\n24:41 Comment: rightly\n24:41 Comment: that's Leicester play on\n24:43 Comment: no advantage came their way though\n24:45 Comment: it was good refereeing\n24:46 Comment: but Mbidi didn't make the most of it\n24:47 Comment: all Brighton\n24:50 Comment: already good\n24:51 Comment: was on there for Vardy\n24:54 Comment: Inyondy\n24:56 Comment: Oh good\n24:57 Comment: that's off-the-line\n24:57 Comment: schöp\n24:58 Comment: Oh, good one.\n25:5 Comment: Come a long way from goal here.\n25:6 Comment: Mignolet's got to get this right.\n25:13 Comment: Milano.\n25:17 Comment: Big turn of pace there as he picks out Mignolet.\n25:21 Comment: And now on to Coutinho for Liverpool.\n25:24 Comment: Mignolet just ran into trouble.\n25:28 Comment: And Danny Simpson got his angle spot on there.\n25:31 Comment: Coutinho's looking to try and bend that inside the far post.\n25:37 Comment: A little bit of trouble, though.\n25:39 Comment: It's a danger when Coutinho's in the inside left position.\n25:44 Comment: Tackle from Simpson.\n25:47 Comment: He's trying to shift it, looking up that target there.\n25:51 Comment: Simpson did well.\n25:58 Comment: Oh, there's Coutinho following through.\n25:59 Comment: There's no malice in that from Coutinho,\n26:1 Comment: but that's no consolation to Danny Simpson,\n26:4 Comment: who's still getting treatment here.\n26:12 Comment: Nice start, though, for Greg Shakespeare,\n26:15 Comment: who has been caretaker once before in his career,\n26:17 Comment: when he was at West Bromwich Albion,\n26:19 Comment: and he won his only game in charge.\n26:22 Comment: He joined Leicester originally as assistant to Nigel Pearson.\n26:26 Comment: Probably best remembered as a player,\n26:28 Comment: if his time at Walsall.\n26:33 Comment: There's been no shortage of energy from Leicester.\n26:35 Comment: Maybe a little short on composure.\n26:38 Comment: They look anxious, and that's entirely understandable,\n26:42 Comment: given that they're in the bottom three now.\n26:46 Comment: Unfortunately, Greg Shakespeare and the owners\n26:48 Comment: have both publicly today denied\n26:51 Comment: that there was any disloyalty\n26:53 Comment: on the part of the playing squad towards Ranieri.\n26:58 Comment: But that's not the case.\n26:59 Comment: They're still in the top three.\n27:1 Comment: Lots of rumours and speculation.\n27:6 Comment: Van Alden gives it away.\n27:8 Comment: And on it goes to Vardy,\n27:10 Comment: in a great position to give Leicester the lead.\n27:12 Comment: And takes it.\n27:16 Comment: Leicester's long wait for a Premier League goal is over.\n27:20 Comment: The first in 2017,\n27:23 Comment: and it couldn't have come at a better time.\n27:27 Comment: Wow.\n27:27 Comment: This is the last.\n33:48 Comment: The final score is 2-3.\n33:54 Comment: R savage tat10 4Lずleva plane 2015 R $ ynf.\n33:58 Comment: Good check up from Fabio, for a moment it looked as if Fabio himself was getting in here.\n34:3 Comment: Brulis Lucas here for a moment it looked as if it was goal side, a little bit of miscontrol costly for him.\n34:13 Comment: One ball for Mane, he might have used his arm to push the defender over there but the,\n34:18 Comment: he was just, I think, way play on, acknowledging that it probably was a foul.\n34:28 Comment: It's a good question, it's a good question.\n34:43 Comment: He's had plenty of headers so far,\n34:46 Comment: he's not really been in the right direction and that one wasn't.\n34:51 Comment: He's got to make sure that he's got his wits about him when Leicester don't have the ball,\n34:54 Comment: big weakness in terms of allowing full backs to run,\n34:57 Comment: he's got to make sure that he's got his wits about him when Leicester don't have the ball,\n34:58 Comment: and he gives Danny Drinkwater, who plays on the right of that central too,\n35:1 Comment: an awful lot of work to do at times.\n35:13 Comment: Ten minutes to half time, Leicester with the lead and they have the ball where they want it,\n35:17 Comment: deep inside Liverpool territory.\n35:19 Comment: Simpson.\n35:49 Comment: Nagasaki.\n35:57 Comment: Filled by Matip.\n35:59 Comment: And as far as Ndidi.\n36:1 Comment: Mahrez.\n36:3 Comment: Simpson.\n36:7 Comment: And he leaves it to Drinkwater.\n36:9 Comment: And it came off the Liverpool man, Lucas, for another Leicester corner.\n36:12 Comment: A good lot from Lucas, otherwise he's fainting partly there.\n36:16 Comment: Danny Drinkwater.\n36:19 Comment: And that's a waste.\n36:26 Comment: Liverpool have not amused at all.\n36:31 Comment: They didn't go long with the corner.\n36:43 Comment: Nobody's goal, I'm sure, would have impressed Southgate.\n36:46 Comment: Southgate.\n36:47 Comment: They turned the clock back with that strike.\n36:56 Comment: Lively right from the off.\n37:2 Comment: I think that the goal in Seville was obviously very important too.\n37:6 Comment: A dry one was becoming a bit of a millstone for them.\n37:10 Comment: Well and truly over now.\n37:17 Comment: I think that's clear, that was by Matip.\n37:23 Comment: Because that was lay-off.\n37:25 Comment: Maybe a Mahrez bogey in the Liverpool manager area, which is where I'll stay.\n37:36 Comment: And the heavy title will be arriving.\n37:38 Comment: And the short of Robert Hulmeke in particular.\n37:40 Comment: He's already caused Liverpool a lot of problems when the ball has been in the air.\n37:44 Comment: But now he's gone on.\n37:45 Comment: Now Watkins!\n37:46 Comment: Big энергies!\n37:47 Comment: 시면 Alec\n37:56 Comment: That on the near post.\n37:59 Comment: Still the danger hasn't gone.\n38:2 Comment: He should have done now, but Liverpool are still on the back foot.\n38:5 Comment: Oh my word, are they?!\n38:7 Comment: What a shot!\n38:8 Comment: What a goal by Drinkwater!\n38:11 Comment: And Leicester have a 2-0 lead!\n38:13 Comment: 2-0 lead.\n38:15 Comment: Classic strike.\n38:17 Comment: It certainly is.\n38:20 Comment: Liverpool\n38:20 Comment: thought they'd done the job here.\n38:23 Comment: This is an awkward one to defend.\n38:25 Comment: They get it away eventually.\n38:28 Comment: Good ball from\n38:29 Comment: O'Brien. Ball's played by\n38:31 Comment: Milner. No one's expecting\n38:33 Comment: that. It's a wonderful finish.\n38:38 Comment: Milner thinks\n38:39 Comment: he's got it safe here.\n38:41 Comment: Mignolet's helpless.\n38:43 Comment: Takes a big move away\n38:44 Comment: from him inside his left-hand post.\n38:47 Comment: It's a wonderful strike.\n38:49 Comment: Little bit of spin on it.\n38:51 Comment: Did it take a deflection in the wind?\n38:53 Comment: Either way, Mignolet's\n38:54 Comment: helpless.\n38:58 Comment: Only the second goal he's scored in over a year.\n39:6 Comment: Well, a penny for\n39:7 Comment: Gabriel Ranieri's thoughts at this moment.\n39:10 Comment: So he's watching somewhere.\n39:12 Comment: What will he be thinking?\n39:16 Comment: Oh, Liverpool fans\n39:18 Comment: thinking of him all the time.\n39:21 Comment: Martinho\n39:22 Comment: beating it out to Clyde.\n39:27 Comment: That was a spring in the step of these\n39:30 Comment: Leicester City players.\n39:31 Comment: They've been well prepared for this by Craig Shakespeare\n39:33 Comment: and Mike Stowell,\n39:35 Comment: both of the coaches assisting him\n39:38 Comment: at the moment.\n39:42 Comment: Liverpool haven't finished yet.\n39:43 Comment: Not by any means.\n39:44 Comment: A long time to go.\n39:45 Comment: Coutinho with the pullback.\n39:48 Comment: Alaba's shot blocked.\n39:49 Comment: Comes out to Mane.\n39:51 Comment: Mane.\n40:2 Comment: There he is again, Mane.\n40:3 Comment: Alaba.\n40:5 Comment: Good time.\n40:7 Comment: Right now, though.\n40:11 Comment: Great play.\n40:12 Comment: Good football there from Milano.\n40:15 Comment: And then it was outnumbered.\n40:22 Comment: Lucas.\n40:24 Comment: To Milne.\n40:30 Comment: Coutinho.\n40:32 Comment: Mane.\n40:38 Comment: Mane in the box.\n40:39 Comment: And Liverpool have another.\n40:42 Comment: They're in the corner.\n40:42 Comment: A good bit of O'Brien to get it behind.\n40:44 Comment: Doesn't want to be missed timing that.\n40:45 Comment: Giving away a penalty.\n40:47 Comment: Has worked really hard for this 2-0 lead, Leicester.\n40:49 Comment: Big five minutes coming up now, though.\n40:51 Comment: They're trying to get in at worst 2-0.\n40:55 Comment: .\n41:41 Comment: Indeed he did well to win that header.\n41:43 Comment: Here's Albrighton.\n41:48 Comment: Immediately fell for him again.\n42:0 Comment: Beautiful bit of skill by Camino.\n42:2 Comment: He's given it away to Fuchs.\n42:4 Comment: Camino has switched over to that far side now.\n42:7 Comment: Leicester looking dangerous with every attack at the moment.\n42:11 Comment: He's got a good shot.\n42:18 Comment: Free kick has been awarded.\n42:20 Comment: A good free kick to give away for Christian Fuchs.\n42:23 Comment: He was so high up the pitch.\n42:25 Comment: Liverpool were liable to break.\n42:32 Comment: Chan.\n42:33 Comment: Matip.\n42:35 Comment: He's on the right touchline.\n42:37 Comment: Long and close support.\n42:41 Comment: He's got a good shot.\n42:43 Comment: And he's got that throw.\n42:53 Comment: Very popular with the players here I gather.\n42:57 Comment: Even more popular with the fans at the moment.\n43:1 Comment: I think that's why the first goal was so important.\n43:3 Comment: To get the supporters back onside.\n43:11 Comment: But it went into the penalty.\n43:13 Comment: H woke Fuchs.\n43:15 Comment: Hillиваем.\n43:17 Comment: Spurs.\n43:18 Comment: Rries sentences the team.\n43:20 Comment: One more.\n43:22 Comment: Van deYOen.\n43:23 Comment: And another play up.\n43:24 Comment: Hogoeloen.\n43:26 Comment: Flüchten Testamentel hit Why RUN!\n43:28 Comment: by two doors.\n43:29 Comment: One of them.\n43:30 Comment: But yes, they are 1-1.\n43:31 Comment: Tocqueville out there with Hazard.\n43:32 Comment: Gotcha.\n43:33 Comment: Tocqueville.\n43:34 Comment: Retolve from it.\n43:35 Comment: Four we go.\n43:37 Comment: H watered a 2,\n43:38 Comment: 5 in that,\n43:39 Comment: Oxford.\n43:40 Comment: and that would be the most disappointing thing for Jurgen Klopp\n43:45 Comment: coming off the back of a good rest and a great performance against Tottenham\n43:50 Comment: he wouldn't have been expecting anything like this\n43:53 Comment: and he certainly wouldn't have been expecting this off Danny Drinkwater\n43:55 Comment: gets over a little bit of spin on the ball\n43:59 Comment: he strikes it so true, he takes all the spin off it\n44:2 Comment: no wonder the goalkeeper is celebrating\n44:6 Comment: superb technique\n44:9 Comment: the man who tops the list for Leicester for most passes and tackles this season\n44:16 Comment: but as I mentioned at the time, not exactly for goal scoring\n44:19 Comment: Simpson\n44:23 Comment: header\n44:39 Comment: Union\n44:55 Comment: você vive muito tempo de pressão\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: but Mane, Firmino, Lallana, Coutinho have largely been anonymous so far,\n0:4 Comment: you can't help but think the best are still to come here from Liverpool,\n0:7 Comment: but they've given themselves a lot to do.\n0:11 Comment: A note of caution for Leicester, their defensive record is poor,\n0:15 Comment: they've already conceded more goals than they did in the whole of last season,\n0:18 Comment: so if Liverpool can get one back early on,\n0:22 Comment: perhaps the old doubts will resurface for the home side.\n0:31 Comment: And suddenly, he comes to life, and the ball is in the Leicester penalty area.\n0:38 Comment: He has to survive that moment.\n0:41 Comment: Cardi all on his own up front at the moment.\n0:44 Comment: Chan dropped in, back three for Liverpool,\n0:46 Comment: Chan dropped in beside Matip and Lucas Klein and Milner,\n0:51 Comment: much further advanced now.\n0:54 Comment: Coutinho, sweeps it out first time.\n1:0 Comment: He's got a few harsh words to say to the Liverpool players,\n1:5 Comment: during the interval they were sent out early, certainly earlier than Leicester.\n1:19 Comment: Lallana.\n1:22 Comment: It's just nicked away from Coutinho, but it is Liverpool's throw.\n1:25 Comment: Lallana.\n1:31 Comment: Good challenge from Mbide.\n1:41 Comment: Firmino.\n1:45 Comment: No-kick.\n1:47 Comment: Leicester have just got to try and do what they did in the first half,\n1:50 Comment: it's a case of do they stick or do they twist,\n1:53 Comment: I think they've got to continue to try and get at Liverpool.\n1:57 Comment: I think they want to sit in and try and defend this.\n2:4 Comment: He's just getting the message out to his players about the change in the Liverpool system.\n2:13 Comment: Only one game, I know, but if Leicester were to go on and win this tonight,\n2:16 Comment: it's not done any harm to his own cause.\n2:19 Comment: Shakespeare, he says he is interested in the job,\n2:22 Comment: first time he feels he can handle it.\n2:26 Comment: An assistant here to both Nigel Pearson and Claudio Ranieri.\n2:38 Comment: Klein.\n2:41 Comment: Lallana.\n2:49 Comment: No worries about Mark Albright in the tracking, terrific defender from the wide area.\n2:56 Comment: A sharp contrast, someone say to Marrez on the other side.\n2:59 Comment: Yeah, you're dead right, that's always a worry for Leicester,\n3:2 Comment: Marrez allowing full-backs to run off him.\n3:11 Comment: Matip.\n3:14 Comment: Oh, dear, it kind of sums up Liverpool's night so far.\n3:26 Comment: Oh, dear.\n3:44 Comment: Water hooks it on.\n3:47 Comment: Wijnaldum.\n3:52 Comment: Champ.\n3:54 Comment: Milner.\n3:57 Comment: Coutinho.\n4:2 Comment: Sunderland going off him enough, Liverpool.\n4:7 Comment: Matip.\n4:11 Comment: It's Klein.\n4:14 Comment: Mane.\n4:23 Comment: Milner, might need some help here, gets it from Mbembe-Chan.\n4:30 Comment: Still out there, Milner on the left.\n4:32 Comment: Doing well.\n4:34 Comment: Good challenge though.\n4:36 Comment: Going off for the first time, done a really good job in central midfield indeed.\n4:40 Comment: It's winning tick balls and making interceptions like that,\n4:43 Comment: but they have really missed their star man of course from last season.\n4:50 Comment: Kante, no longer here, and he's been badly missed.\n4:57 Comment: One of their star men of course, because both Kardi and Milner\n5:1 Comment: has made a huge contribution in terms of goals.\n5:7 Comment: Matip.\n5:9 Comment: Klein.\n5:12 Comment: There's Lallana.\n5:16 Comment: And gets it back, Lallana, well, should have done.\n5:18 Comment: And again, this must have been looking good.\n5:23 Comment: Okazaki.\n5:25 Comment: Mane.\n5:26 Comment: O'Brighton wins it back.\n5:28 Comment: And Mahrez, free down the right.\n5:32 Comment: It's a good recovery there by Ciano, a little second favourite.\n5:35 Comment: Well, yeah, coming over his shoulder, up and one-two to judge the...\n5:40 Comment: Milner.\n5:41 Comment: Coutinho.\n5:48 Comment: Matip.\n5:51 Comment: Klein.\n5:57 Comment: Beautifully done by Okazaki.\n5:59 Comment: A good ball as well for Kovardi.\n6:2 Comment: He's on his own, he's going to have to go all the way, I think.\n6:6 Comment: Support arriving now, including Okazaki.\n6:11 Comment: Well, they all did good work to...\n6:14 Comment: to track the run there, but...\n6:16 Comment: Okazaki, fabulous ball for Kovardi.\n6:22 Comment: Domino.\n6:23 Comment: It's not a very quiet night so far, he's scored two goals\n6:26 Comment: in the deep left of the landfill earlier in the season.\n6:28 Comment: The flag has gone up for offside here.\n6:32 Comment: Kovardi.\n6:34 Comment: Okazaki picking up a knock in the process.\n6:38 Comment: We don't want to be losing this boy, it's been terrific tonight.\n6:43 Comment: Really good early ball to the release, Vardy, who's probably had better service\n6:47 Comment: tonight than he's had for most of the season.\n6:50 Comment: Support arrived eventually, but...\n6:52 Comment: for that time Vardy can't get a shot away himself.\n7:1 Comment: Vardy.\n7:12 Comment: He's had it on.\n7:17 Comment: Vardy realizing that he would have been given offside if he'd gone for that.\n7:31 Comment: Tied by Matip.\n7:45 Comment: Christian Fuchs for Leicester.\n7:49 Comment: Paul Brighton.\n7:54 Comment: Clarence.\n7:57 Comment: Mane.\n8:1 Comment: Lucas.\n8:3 Comment: And it's Coutinho.\n8:15 Comment: They're still in good discipline shape at the moment.\n8:18 Comment: It will finally get hard to find the ball.\n8:21 Comment: It's a bit of a struggle for Lucas.\n8:24 Comment: He's got a bit of a problem with his left foot.\n8:27 Comment: He's got a bit of a problem with his right foot.\n8:29 Comment: It will finally get hard to find a way through.\n8:33 Comment: And Vardy has ever, what a chase loss cause is.\n8:36 Comment: It's a good ball, it's a really good ball.\n8:39 Comment: A ball that won both for the defenders and the keeper to judge.\n8:44 Comment: Matip.\n8:45 Comment: On to Clyne.\n8:51 Comment: Mane.\n8:54 Comment: Opens up for the shot perhaps.\n8:56 Comment: Slides it on instead.\n8:58 Comment: And it was Coutinho who came to the help.\n9:12 Comment: Gone 10 games without scoring now.\n9:23 Comment: Mane.\n9:26 Comment: Brilliantly done by Mane.\n9:39 Comment: This is one boy who's going to give Leicester value for money I'm sure going forward.\n9:43 Comment: Just 20 years of age.\n9:45 Comment: Great athlete.\n9:46 Comment: A new room now for Clyne.\n9:48 Comment: There's a wing back.\n9:52 Comment: Nuno.\n9:53 Comment: His target here.\n10:12 Comment: Clyne has to be a bit more aggressive.\n10:14 Comment: Clyne again.\n10:16 Comment: Mane.\n10:27 Comment: Lallana.\n10:28 Comment: Challenged by Okazaki, was a good one.\n10:30 Comment: Mahrez breaks.\n10:32 Comment: Vardy in support.\n10:37 Comment: Disappointing ball, easily intercepted by Clyne.\n10:44 Comment: Lucas.\n10:46 Comment: Here's Matip.\n10:53 Comment: Mane came in short.\n10:55 Comment: Picks up Coutinho instead.\n10:57 Comment: And now on to Milner.\n11:2 Comment: Mane.\n11:12 Comment: Dangerous ball, well defended.\n11:15 Comment: Clyne.\n11:17 Comment: Wijnaldum.\n11:21 Comment: Firmino sneaking round the back there but...\n11:24 Comment: ...couldn't pick him out.\n11:27 Comment: Matip.\n11:30 Comment: To Mbidi.\n11:34 Comment: Mane.\n11:36 Comment: He's got Lallana in close support.\n11:42 Comment: Just shifted it into his left foot and wins the call.\n11:44 Comment: He might be trying to get through the legs here of Robert Hoost.\n11:49 Comment: He's got a few chances here.\n11:51 Comment: Hoost misses his tackle here.\n11:54 Comment: Mane gets a chance to square Robert Hoost up.\n11:56 Comment: He might be trying to get through him.\n11:57 Comment: Wijnaldum.\n12:10 Comment: Kuznicki clears.\n12:13 Comment: Almost everyone inside the Leicester half now.\n12:16 Comment: The pattern looks set for this second half.\n12:22 Comment: Waybon Morgan.\n12:24 Comment: Kuznicki busy as ever.\n12:28 Comment: But not this time.\n12:30 Comment: Lucas.\n12:38 Comment: Firmino.\n12:40 Comment: Here's Matip.\n12:47 Comment: Coutinho.\n12:50 Comment: Not exactly where...\n12:52 Comment: ...James Moon was going to be.\n12:56 Comment: Emre Can.\n12:58 Comment: Can he do that again?\n13:0 Comment: Exchanging passes, edge of the box.\n13:4 Comment: And Wijnaldum.\n13:5 Comment: Impressively winning it back off Lallana.\n13:8 Comment: And next we've got a goal kick as well.\n13:9 Comment: Slightly tricky down the centre.\n13:11 Comment: It was great a little launch for Leicester though when the possession turns over.\n13:18 Comment: Kuznicki.\n13:48 Comment: Inside.\n13:51 Comment: They're yarded anyway.\n13:54 Comment: Okazaki did brilliantly to help on.\n13:57 Comment: It's a great kick from Schmeichel.\n13:59 Comment: Terrific kick.\n14:2 Comment: They're yarded at most.\n14:9 Comment: That was the kind of tactic we saw so often last season.\n14:18 Comment: Here goes Vardy again.\n14:20 Comment: In behind Can this time.\n14:24 Comment: Okazaki's in the centre.\n14:26 Comment: Trying to support him.\n14:29 Comment: Márez.\n14:33 Comment: Fuchs.\n14:38 Comment: Good football.\n14:40 Comment: Decent ball in.\n14:42 Comment: And it's 3-0.\n14:44 Comment: Vardy there again.\n14:49 Comment: The champions have bounced back.\n14:53 Comment: A terrific striker's goal.\n14:55 Comment: With a link up between Márez and Fuchs.\n14:58 Comment: It's terrific.\n15:1 Comment: Cross from Vardy overshoots.\n15:4 Comment: They look as if there's nothing on here at all for Leicester.\n15:8 Comment: And somehow they engineer the space to get a cross in.\n15:11 Comment: Lovely ball from Márez.\n15:14 Comment: And Vardy gets a cross in front of Csárdás.\n15:16 Comment: It's a terrific header.\n15:17 Comment: Down into the corner.\n15:20 Comment: Mignolet blameless here.\n15:22 Comment: And Jamie Vardy is back big time.\n15:27 Comment: Nice crossing.\n15:29 Comment: Half a yard from Csárdás.\n15:32 Comment: Leicester just about there.\n15:37 Comment: Well, before tonight, Leicester had won just five of their 20 games.\n15:42 Comment: Hard to believe that the team have produced such a contrast here.\n15:46 Comment: But they're on the back foot at the moment.\n15:54 Comment: Not for long.\n16:4 Comment: Firmino.\n16:7 Comment: And he's got it.\n16:9 Comment: Firmino.\n16:13 Comment: Liverpool have been on average at best.\n16:16 Comment: Arguably poor.\n16:18 Comment: Leicester have been excellent.\n16:27 Comment: Matip.\n16:31 Comment: There's Firmino.\n16:33 Comment: Into Clyne.\n16:34 Comment: Coutinho.\n16:37 Comment: Maradona.\n16:38 Comment: Coutinho, rather.\n16:41 Comment: Maradona's just behind him.\n16:42 Comment: Here he is.\n16:43 Comment: And he's been beaten as well.\n16:50 Comment: Wow.\n16:52 Comment: Mane.\n16:55 Comment: There's Firmino.\n17:0 Comment: Maradona.\n17:2 Comment: Maradona for Liverpool.\n17:13 Comment: Guarnardo.\n17:16 Comment: Matip joins the attack.\n17:22 Comment: It's a decent effort.\n17:32 Comment: Well, it's not exactly the form that made them champions,\n17:36 Comment: but it's not far off it.\n17:42 Comment: He must be absolutely delighted.\n17:44 Comment: Oh, just a bit.\n17:47 Comment: There's a bit of football left in this.\n17:50 Comment: What they have done, they've released this man so early tonight.\n17:53 Comment: Midfield players knocking it in behind Firmino with their first touch.\n17:58 Comment: Sometimes this season they've been a little bit too deliberate.\n18:2 Comment: Tonight it's gone in behind every opportunity.\n18:7 Comment: Liverpool have a few big problems to solve.\n18:12 Comment: Surely a substitution is imminent.\n18:18 Comment: Leicester have just gone back to basics.\n18:28 Comment: Mane.\n18:31 Comment: Matip's clear and straight to Ndidi.\n18:34 Comment: Lukaszewski just hit him in the face.\n18:47 Comment: Drinkwater beaten to it, committed a foul after that.\n18:51 Comment: I don't think Danny Drinkwater was happy with James Milner's foot in the high-dirt.\n18:56 Comment: He's had a tug-of-war, this is the obvious change for Liverpool.\n19:2 Comment: Remy about to come on.\n19:7 Comment: Clyde.\n19:12 Comment: Mane.\n19:14 Comment: So far Leicester have kept him pretty quiet.\n19:18 Comment: Here's a little arm-up.\n19:20 Comment: When Liverpool do threaten to get on the score-sheet, Schmeichel denies them again.\n19:26 Comment: Terrific save, well-done, 1-2 here.\n19:30 Comment: Gets away from Ndidi there, opened the goal up beautifully for himself.\n19:40 Comment: Coutinho with the corner.\n19:50 Comment: FANS CHANTING\n19:53 Comment: It's a festival of light at the moment at the King Power Stadium.\n19:57 Comment: And the power is certainly with a home side.\n20:6 Comment: And it's the name of the departed manager they're chanting.\n20:10 Comment: FANS CHANTING\n20:18 Comment: Now Liverpool's response is to take off the leading goal scorer Mane.\n20:25 Comment: Ndidi taking his place, Lallana pulling off as well, to be replaced by Alberto Mourinho.\n20:31 Comment: FANS CHANTING\n20:35 Comment: Surprised that Mane is one of those to...\n20:37 Comment: Not tonight, not in tonight's performance, we expected so much more.\n20:42 Comment: After the way he took Spurs apart, he's been largely absent tonight.\n20:51 Comment: Strange move there for Lallana, he's just signed a new long-term contract.\n20:55 Comment: And he finds himself substituted.\n21:1 Comment: Coutinho, meanwhile.\n21:5 Comment: Klein.\n21:8 Comment: Firmino.\n21:16 Comment: He finds himself a long way forward, that's his Milner.\n21:22 Comment: And Ndidi clears the danger, Vardy in the zone now.\n21:32 Comment: Milner.\n21:35 Comment: Coutinho.\n21:38 Comment: Origi.\n21:40 Comment: Hitting on the foot.\n21:43 Comment: Still in there though.\n21:44 Comment: Poor ball.\n21:46 Comment: What can Origi do with that?\n21:50 Comment: Liverpool having more attempts but...\n21:53 Comment: ...Liverpool starting to run out on them here.\n22:1 Comment: Clingwater.\n22:4 Comment: Vardy.\n22:7 Comment: Lloyd-Bryson.\n22:11 Comment: Vardy.\n22:15 Comment: Now Firmino can take Liverpool forward.\n22:18 Comment: Ndidi doing his best to deny him though.\n22:23 Comment: Chan.\n22:27 Comment: Moreno.\n22:29 Comment: Chan goes on again.\n22:32 Comment: It's a good ball as well for Coutinho.\n22:36 Comment: Liverpool's best move of the match has brought them a goal.\n22:41 Comment: Just arrived at exactly the right time, Coutinho took a really good first touch.\n22:46 Comment: Great run from Chan initially as well, little one-two.\n22:50 Comment: Coutinho now on his way, first touch is terrific.\n22:55 Comment: That's just a firm pass again.\n22:57 Comment: First time they've really managed to open Leicester up properly.\n23:1 Comment: Just closes his foot on this.\n23:4 Comment: Michael probably thinks he's going to cross him.\n23:9 Comment: Is it enough?\n23:11 Comment: Liverpool's player of the year for the last two seasons has brought them back into the picture here.\n23:19 Comment: Meanwhile, as you can see, Leicester have made a change-up.\n23:22 Comment: Zaki, who took a knock a few minutes ago, has been replaced by Amartey.\n23:30 Comment: Coutinho.\n23:32 Comment: First goal in 11 matches, incidentally.\n23:36 Comment: The tackle Danny Simpson had to win that.\n23:38 Comment: Just a little sliver of doubt perhaps spreading around this stadium now.\n24:1 Comment: Still 20 minutes, cross-stoppage time.\n24:4 Comment: That's what they didn't need at that moment.\n24:7 Comment: One of those, Leicester up the pitch.\n24:19 Comment: I don't know if you're a good lip-reader, Davey, but...\n24:21 Comment: Five across?\n24:22 Comment: Yeah, exactly.\n24:24 Comment: Lee Vardy completely isolated.\n24:27 Comment: He's got a good run, he's got a good run.\n24:30 Comment: Lee Vardy completely isolated.\n24:51 Comment: So many of Leicester's wins last season were achieved with...\n24:56 Comment: ...a strong defensive unit, breakaway goals, with the pace and power of Vardy and Mahrez.\n25:10 Comment: Firmino.\n25:12 Comment: Coutinho skips over the challenge.\n25:15 Comment: Looking for a re-yeat.\n25:16 Comment: Great defending first.\n25:18 Comment: Had to read that really early and did go round.\n25:21 Comment: There we go again.\n25:23 Comment: Classic first-time goal for Vardy.\n25:26 Comment: He's going to have a lot to do in what's left of this now, Jimmy Vardy.\n25:30 Comment: I don't think he's going to be short of energy, though, after two goals tonight.\n25:33 Comment: Two goals tonight.\n25:50 Comment: That's a good choice to bring the ball out of defence.\n25:53 Comment: Coutinho.\n25:54 Comment: Into the shan.\n25:58 Comment: He's come a long way in this second half.\n26:0 Comment: Coutinho.\n26:3 Comment: He's got the time.\n26:9 Comment: A familiar midfield role.\n26:12 Comment: We'll be getting a left-back this season.\n26:21 Comment:

    "summary": "On a thrilling night of football at the King Power Stadium, Leicester City emerged victorious with a 3-1 win over Liverpool, marking a significant turnaround for the Foxes in their Premier League campaign. From the first whistle, Leicester demonstrated a vibrant and aggressive approach, immediately setting the game's tone. Liverpool, fresh off a break and having previously dismantled Tottenham Hotspur, were expected to bring their A-game, but found themselves stifled by a tenacious Leicester side.\n\nLeicester kicked off proceedings and made their intentions clear right from the start. By the third minute, they had already positioned themselves as the aggressors, pushing forward with purpose. The crowd's energy surged as they witnessed their side taking the initiative. Liverpool, however, were not to be underestimated given their prowess in the league and their potent attacking trio of Mane, Firmino, and Coutinho.\n\nFrom the outset, Leicester's Jamie Vardy made his presence felt. An early collision with Liverpool striker Sadio Mane saw Vardy go into a strong challenge, which set a physical tone for the rest of the match. Liverpool, missing the leadership and defensive stability of Dejan Lovren, had to rely on Lucas, who stepped into the role of a central defender. \n\nLeicester maintained their high pressure, forcing Liverpool into conceding the first corner of the match. Despite the corner being cleared, the early stages highlighted Leicester's strategy to exploit set-pieces, given the aerial threat posed by the likes of Robert Huth and Wes Morgan. \n\nAs the first half wore on, the pattern of play became evident. Leicester’s constant pressing and quick transitions into attack tested Liverpool’s backline repeatedly. Their efforts bore fruit in the 28th minute when Vardy capitalized on a forward pass, evading Liverpool’s defenders and finishing with aplomb to give Leicester the lead. This goal not only broke Leicester’s goal-scoring drought in the Premier League but also injected fresh optimism into the squad and fans alike.\n\nLiverpool looked to muster a response but found it tough against a resolute Leicester defense. The hard tackles flying in and the physicality of Leicester's play disrupted Liverpool’s flow. Moreover, Leicester's midfield, particularly Wilfred Ndidi, proved to be highly effective in breaking up play and launching swift counters.\n\nThe second significant moment of the half came around the 38th minute. From a corner that Liverpool initially seemed to clear, the ball fell invitingly to Danny Drinkwater, who unleashed a stunning volley from outside the box. The ball swerved with pace, leaving Liverpool’s goalkeeper Simon Mignolet with no chance as it nestled into the bottom corner. Drinkwater’s strike doubled Leicester's advantage, sending the King Power Stadium into raptures and handing them a comfortable cushion heading into halftime.\n\nThe second half began with Liverpool needing to step up their game to salvage something from the match. They adjusted their formation, with Emre Can dropping deeper to join the defense, allowing Nathaniel Clyne and James Milner to push further up the field as wing-backs. This tactical switch by Jürgen Klopp aimed to provide more width and attacking options.\n\nDespite Liverpool’s initial efforts to claw back into the game, Vardy struck again at the 60-minute mark. A well-worked move saw Riyad Mahrez linking up with Christian Fuchs down the left. Fuchs' pinpoint cross found Vardy in the box, who outjumped his marker to direct a precise header past Mignolet. This goal effectively sealed the points for Leicester, putting them three goals to the good.\n\nLiverpool's response came in the form of a tactical tweak, introducing more attacking personnel into the fray. Divock Origi and Alberto Moreno were brought on, as Klopp sought to inject pace and creativity into their forward play. The changes bore some fruit in the 68th minute when Philippe Coutinho was at the end of a flowing move, orchestrated by Emre Can. Coutinho’s neat first touch set him up to place a well-struck shot past Kasper Schmeichel, giving Liverpool a glimmer of hope.\n\nThe goal lifted Liverpool’s spirits, and they began to press harder, seeking a way back into the match. However, Leicester’s disciplined defensive display, coupled with exceptional saves from Schmeichel, kept Liverpool at bay. Vardy continued to be a thorn in Liverpool’s side, tirelessly chasing down balls and ensuring Leicester maintained pressure even in their defensive third.\n\nAs the game drew to a close, Leicester shuffled their pack to maintain their advantage. They replaced the tireless Shinji Okazaki with Daniel Amartey, a move designed to add more steel to their midfield and see out the game. \n\nLiverpool threw everything forward in the dying minutes. A youthful Ben Woodburn was introduced to add fresh legs and creativity, but Leicester's defense held firm. Leicester’s midfielders, particularly Danny Drinkwater and Ndidi, put in crucial interventions and kept possession when needed, frustrating Liverpool’s attempts to build momentum.\n\nThe final whistle blew, confirming a much-needed victory for Leicester City. It was a night of great relief and jubilation for the Foxes, who delivered a performance reminiscent of their title-winning form. Jamie Vardy’s brace and Drinkwater’s screamer ensured that Leicester took all the plaudits and the points, serving as a potential turning point in their troubled season. \n\nFor Liverpool, it was a sobering defeat that highlighted the erratic nature of their form against lower-ranked teams. Despite a respectable amount of possession and attempting to dictate the pace, they were outplayed by a Leicester side brimming with determination and renewed vigour under Craig Shakespeare’s interim management. Klopp and his team would need to go back to the drawing board and address the vulnerabilities that Leicester so ruthlessly exposed.\n\nThis match left Leicester’s fans hopeful of a climb away from the relegation zone, while Liverpool supporters faced questions about their team's consistency and resilience in the tough Premier League grind."
