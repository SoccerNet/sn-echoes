    "input": "\n    Everton 4 - 2 Leicester\n\nFirst Half:\n\n0:30 Comment: it in. An electrifying start. Bobby Madley the referee let it go and wasn't Davis delighted with that.\n0:41 Comment: Talk about local heroes.\n0:43 Comment: It's a fantastic piece of counter-attacking football, a brilliant piece of refereeing as well.\n0:48 Comment: Is it certainly a foul on now Morales? And the court short the back here Leicester,\n0:52 Comment: very poor from the kickoff to be caught at the back like this.\n0:56 Comment: Davis does the right thing, he backs up Morales, there's the foul, the referee lets play go on.\n1:0 Comment: And tucked away brilliantly by the youngster, a whirlwind of a start from the home side here\n1:4 Comment: in Leicester, but simply blown away.\n1:8 Comment: Oh, Davis did really well to keep pace with Morales and that's what you get for sensing the moment.\n1:16 Comment: Talk about a big future, he's not doing bad in the present.\n1:20 Comment: It's that maturity, that understanding, many young players would have just stopped their run,\n1:24 Comment: allowed Morales to actually do all the work himself, but Davis kept on going just in case anything broke.\n1:30 Comment: That maturity this season from Tom Davis has been outstanding.\n1:33 Comment: It's his second senior goal, the first was in a 4-0 win over Manchester City here,\n1:39 Comment: a result that's a reminder to all and sundry that Everton at Goodison Park\n1:45 Comment: are sometimes too hot to handle and Chelsea still have to play here.\n1:51 Comment: Here's Lukaku.\n1:54 Comment: Chelsea! Chelsea! Chelsea!\n2:0 Comment: OK, Barkley, again, Davis.\n2:4 Comment: Chelsea! Chelsea! Chelsea!\n2:8 Comment: Here's Baines.\n2:13 Comment: So, when you make many changes, Andy, of course you hope to bet into a game\n2:18 Comment: without this happening to you.\n2:20 Comment: But Leicester already on the back foot.\n2:24 Comment: You can see the goal from Craig Shakespeare's point of view,\n2:27 Comment: from having the kick-off, dropping the ball, out of play, OK, the ball goes out of play,\n2:30 Comment: but it's so high up the field that you've got a chance to set yourself defensively\n2:33 Comment: and be prepared for Everton coming back at you, they simply weren't, they got overrun.\n2:38 Comment: Here's Holgate.\n2:42 Comment: Lukaku.\n2:44 Comment: And Morales.\n2:46 Comment: There's been a thorn in Leicester's side in recent Premier League games, he's scored in the last three.\n2:50 Comment: Well, Amati's a lucky boy here, he does actually appreciate the run of Morales off his shoulder.\n2:56 Comment: Just the bounce of the ball, it gets away from Morales,\n2:58 Comment: but good movement off the ball from the wide man, it's a full-back.\n3:1 Comment: You've got to open your body up and appreciate the move Morales is making in behind you.\n3:5 Comment: Watch the ball, and you're dead in the water.\n3:9 Comment: Well, he spent Wednesday night in between Mesut Komte and Guardiola,\n3:15 Comment: as the fourth official at Stamford Bridge.\n3:18 Comment: Stamford Bridge, I think he's glad after that to be out in the middle,\n3:22 Comment: and he's shown superb judgement in the opening seconds of the game.\n3:30 Comment: Here's Baines.\n3:32 Comment: Lukaku, Baines.\n3:37 Comment: I think there was a feeling in the Everton cap,\n3:41 Comment: that if they made a fast start they could really unhinge\n3:46 Comment: this much-altered Leicester line-up.\n3:50 Comment: And here's Demaree Gray, trying to reply in the kind of Morales...\n3:55 Comment: Slimane is free, he's in, he's equalised.\n4:2 Comment: Oh, what a game we've got on our hands here.\n4:6 Comment: Pace, and penetration at the end of the pace.\n4:11 Comment: A goal apiece in four minutes.\n4:14 Comment: It's a typical Leicester goal, but Morgan Schneidlin goes to ground here.\n4:17 Comment: As the ball breaks here, stay on your feet, stay with your man,\n4:20 Comment: once you go to ground and allow the Leicester players to break beyond you,\n4:25 Comment: you're in big trouble.\n4:26 Comment: I just thought the pass wasn't gonna come towards Slimane,\n4:28 Comment: eventually it did, he would have been happy of him taking it first time.\n4:32 Comment: Has to take a touch, but he keeps the ball really close to his feet,\n4:35 Comment: that means he can tuck it under the goalkeeper.\n4:38 Comment: Everton caught short at the back,\n4:40 Comment: and Leicester sweeping down the field and equalising.\n4:42 Comment: Incredible start to the game.\n4:44 Comment: That's the first time he's scored in an away game since joining Leicester.\n4:56 Comment: Djagielka.\n4:58 Comment: Well, it was 1-1 Everton's last game, it took till the 94th, 95th minute\n5:4 Comment: for the second goal, of course they conceded to Ibrahimovic's penalty\n5:8 Comment: so close to beating Manchester United on Tuesday,\n5:10 Comment: and going above them in the table they would have done had that been the case.\n5:14 Comment: Djagielka who plays the pass, got their goal.\n5:18 Comment: Slimane has got a goal for Leicester here.\n5:23 Comment: And it is a really tidy finish, but again looking at Schneidlin's role\n5:26 Comment: in that Leicester counter-attack, he's the deepest line of the central three for Everton,\n5:30 Comment: you've got Gaye pushing on, Davis pushing on,\n5:32 Comment: so important that Schneidlin doesn't get bypassed, that's exactly what happened.\n5:38 Comment: Gaye.\n5:39 Comment: Barkley.\n5:40 Comment: Gaye.\n5:42 Comment: Hands out to Davis.\n5:43 Comment: Barkley.\n5:52 Comment: And Everton enigma at times.\n6:0 Comment: Gaye, Lukaku.\n6:3 Comment: Barkley, always preferring to work it onto his right foot.\n6:8 Comment: It's a throw, not the free kick that Barkley was hoping for.\n6:13 Comment: Go on, go on!\n6:20 Comment: Off goes Ben Chilwell.\n6:22 Comment: You can see Leicester defensively two solid banks of force,\n6:24 Comment: Slimane dropping on Vardy.\n6:26 Comment: It's been the extra member of the central midfield as well,\n6:29 Comment: so very hard for Everton to play through them, they've got to be patient.\n6:34 Comment: Well I guess the clock is ticking for this wonderful ground,\n6:38 Comment: one of the stately homes of English football.\n6:42 Comment: And Everton now having had a site allocated for them, for a new home.\n6:51 Comment: They've been playing here since 1892,\n6:53 Comment: where they had a lot of trouble when they left the last ground,\n6:55 Comment: which is called Anfield.\n6:58 Comment: And to fill the void of an empty stadium, they created Liverpool FC.\n7:4 Comment: Evertonians have been regretting that move ever since.\n7:8 Comment: Here's Gaye, so.\n7:12 Comment: Schneidelin.\n7:16 Comment: Holgate able to line up across here, goes in low,\n7:20 Comment: comes out to Barkley, Davis trying to tee up Morales.\n7:31 Comment: Well, they played here in the third round, the FA Cup is like a cup tie at the moment.\n7:36 Comment: And Everton scored first in that one too, and lost 2-1.\n7:41 Comment: And here's Morales.\n7:48 Comment: Barkley.\n7:51 Comment: I think they're reluctant to play it in air early,\n7:53 Comment: with the likes of Robert Huth headed away, as he did powerfully then.\n8:1 Comment: Oh, a breathless start.\n8:4 Comment: Noel Koeman, who is very adept at keeping his cool,\n8:9 Comment: must be churning a bit inside.\n8:11 Comment: Craig Shakespeare, mismanagement going.\n8:15 Comment: So taking to it.\n8:21 Comment: In goes Benalouane, hit back by Drinkwater.\n8:26 Comment: Well, earlier in the season conceding such an early goal might well have flattened Leicester,\n8:32 Comment: not in this part of the campaign.\n8:36 Comment: They've rediscovered their resolve, Jamie Vardy's epitomising that.\n8:41 Comment: He's blocked off.\n8:43 Comment: Ralf Bennington, he has to learn a lesson.\n8:47 Comment: You can't dwell on the ball when Vardy is around, he will pinch it back.\n8:51 Comment: He'll look to commit you.\n8:53 Comment: It's a good little turn from Vardy, and a clear obstruction.\n9:10 Comment: Mark Albrighton in charge of the delivery.\n9:19 Comment: He's got to beat the puck at the near post, he's being that front screen for Everton.\n9:26 Comment: Huth and Slimane, main men in the air.\n9:30 Comment: Oh, it's gone straight in!\n9:32 Comment: And Leicester lead!\n9:34 Comment: Mark Albrighton with the free kick, that has flown past Joel Robles.\n9:41 Comment: Three goals at Goodison Park, inside ten minutes, and two of them against Everton.\n9:48 Comment: I think the reaction of the Everton goalkeeper tells you absolutely everything.\n9:51 Comment: I'm sure he's anticipating the ball into the box, so he's taking a step as if he's\n9:54 Comment: going to come and try and deal with maybe the cross.\n9:57 Comment: Doesn't get himself set in terms of his position in the goal.\n10:1 Comment: So then when the ball is actually on target he's absolutely nowhere near it.\n10:4 Comment: He's got it horribly wrong.\n10:6 Comment: I think it's actually slightly overhit by Albrighton, he's not looking to score,\n10:8 Comment: he's looking to whip it into the box.\n10:10 Comment: The goalkeeper makes a mess of it.\n10:15 Comment: That's a remarkable statistic, to add to Slimane's first ever away goal for the club.\n10:24 Comment: When it's going your way.\n10:28 Comment: Jake Shakespeare's Leicester.\n10:31 Comment: Just taken the first punch and come back with a couple of their own.\n10:35 Comment: If you look where the free kick has been taken from and the size of Joel Robles, he must\n10:38 Comment: be 6'4\", 6'5\", he shouldn't be being beaten from there.\n10:52 Comment: He didn't have the best of times at Anfield last weekend.\n10:59 Comment: Leicester looking to spring forward again.\n11:7 Comment: Pennington.\n11:8 Comment: Did score in the derby.\n11:12 Comment: Schneidler.\n11:16 Comment: Both Baines and Holgate, the full-backs, will try and push on.\n11:20 Comment: Gay.\n11:34 Comment: Now Everton have a corner.\n11:38 Comment: And a chance to extend this remarkable start to the game.\n11:51 Comment: In the back by Jagielka.\n11:57 Comment: In come Davis.\n12:0 Comment: Morales trying to stand it up towards Lukaku, who's kept it in but really only that, then\n12:7 Comment: they tag on Vardy.\n12:9 Comment: Jagielka.\n12:14 Comment: Morales, one of the most extraordinary starts to a Premier League game I think I've seen all season,\n12:17 Comment: not just the fact we've had the goals but just the tempo that the game has been played at.\n12:20 Comment: Frantic.\n12:22 Comment: In a word.\n12:27 Comment: Yeah, you can almost forget the tactics and the team selections, it's\n12:32 Comment: two sets of 11 going head-to-head at each other.\n12:35 Comment: There's no better sight.\n12:36 Comment: Yeah, so you mentioned the Everton full-backs pushing forward and that is a big feature of\n12:39 Comment: their play. Normally Seamus Coleman will be doing that with his injury.\n12:41 Comment: It's up to Mason Holgate, so Baines will push on as well. The two central midfielders will\n12:45 Comment: push on ahead of Schneidlin. That's dangerous against Leicester, we've seen it already on the\n12:48 Comment: counter-attack. You've got your two centre-halves and one holding midfielder.\n12:53 Comment: That's what Leicester are looking to take advantage of.\n12:55 Comment: Well, you have to take into account the number of games where Leicester have been in winning\n13:1 Comment: positions and they lost five in a row before this sequence of five successive Premier League\n13:9 Comment: victories with the change of management.\n13:13 Comment: We've got Claudio Ranieri coming on our Monday night football\n13:18 Comment: to analyse everything over the weekend.\n13:20 Comment: It'll be very interesting to get his take on what we've seen so far and what's so likely to follow.\n13:26 Comment: Here's a great, kicked away by Joel Robles and as far as Chilwell and Andy King.\n13:36 Comment: Nicely down by Jack Gilke, giving Schneidlin a chance to influence the proceedings in midfield. Morales.\n13:51 Comment: Schneidlin.\n14:6 Comment: Pennington.\n14:11 Comment: Just got a new deal.\n14:26 Comment: Still Averton's throat.\n14:29 Comment: Always ready when called upon, Andy King.\n14:35 Comment: A real stalwart of Leicester down the years in different divisions.\n14:39 Comment: Lukaku, Leicester wanted offside.\n14:43 Comment: Mag stayed down. Morales.\n14:47 Comment: Stamani can't get it very far because he was booked in the attempt of backing the ball longer.\n14:55 Comment: It is very important for Everton if Lukaku gets drawn into wide areas that Morales goes and joins in.\n15:5 Comment: Because Everton aren't the biggest side, they've got two giant centre-halves.\n15:7 Comment: Leicester, Morales is a big lad, so it means it's time to go and play as that centre-forward if Lukaku's out of the picture.\n15:13 Comment: That's that uncomplicated style that Leicester have reverted to, or rediscovered.\n15:17 Comment: Kasper Schmeichel, realising that Everton might just have dropped their concentration.\n15:21 Comment: Friday he'll chase anything.\n15:31 Comment: Incidentally, the game here last season finished 3-2 to Leicester.\n15:37 Comment: A little bit of a problem here for Dier.\n15:47 Comment: Murray great, clearing in the walls.\n15:49 Comment: Gaeys get every right to challenge for that ball.\n15:53 Comment: Slightly raised down, there's no swinging elbow, it's not a foul, it's just accidental.\n16:7 Comment: Baines.\n16:15 Comment: Marti, Tomba or Brighton, Jagielka stepping in.\n16:19 Comment: Drink water.\n16:25 Comment: Helping out Jagielka, risky ball across for Holgate with Gray lurking.\n16:31 Comment: Back on his feet.\n16:37 Comment: Come on, come on.\n16:45 Comment: Comes and gets the ball, does a lot of fetching and carrying.\n16:49 Comment: Lukaku.\n16:53 Comment: He's been playing with Wes Morgan, still out with a back problem.\n17:3 Comment: Lukaku.\n17:7 Comment: Nicely done by Barkley.\n17:25 Comment: Morales.\n17:31 Comment: Baines, Lukaku's on the move.\n17:33 Comment: Over him.\n17:35 Comment: Retrieved by De Mare Gray.\n17:37 Comment: He knew the cross was going to come in, he was touched tight with Lukaku,\n17:41 Comment: there's no way to strike it.\n17:43 Comment: He's going to get to that ball first, even if it landed right on his head.\n17:49 Comment: Huntington, tight on Bardy, but he didn't give it up.\n17:55 Comment: To his recent club goals, of course he scored impressively as a substitute.\n17:59 Comment: England against Lithuania.\n18:1 Comment: And he is a streak scorer.\n18:3 Comment: At times a streak non-scorer, but when he gets going again,\n18:7 Comment: it's as if something works for him that perhaps other strikers would love to have.\n18:21 Comment: Baines in the end safely leaving it to Davis.\n18:29 Comment: Amati.\n18:45 Comment: Davis.\n18:51 Comment: A real sign yet of the game settling to a more considered pace.\n18:55 Comment: Only one in a hurry to play their passes.\n19:1 Comment: Schneidlin, a bit more thoughtful.\n19:5 Comment: Barkley.\n19:13 Comment: Colgate deciding to try and whip it in, but not very successfully.\n19:17 Comment: It's pretty clear that Everton are going to dominate possession,\n19:20 Comment: but they've got to be patient with the ball, not try and force it forward too quickly.\n19:23 Comment: Try and play those killer passes every time they have it.\n19:25 Comment: They've got to work their openings.\n19:37 Comment: Jagielka had a poor form himself earlier in the season,\n19:41 Comment: but he's worked his way back into the team.\n19:43 Comment: Like the excellent professional that he is.\n19:49 Comment: Barkley.\n19:53 Comment: Colgate trying to set off from right back.\n19:55 Comment: As you say, Andy Seamus, Coleman style.\n19:57 Comment: He's the most rapid of recoveries from that terrible injury playing for the Republic of Ireland.\n20:4 Comment: I don't know what's going to happen of course with Colgate pushing on,\n20:6 Comment: providing the width down the right.\n20:7 Comment: We're going to see Ross Barkley coming into more central areas like this to try and influence the game.\n20:15 Comment: Barkley.\n20:18 Comment: Colgate who came from Barnsley, the same route as John Stones,\n20:23 Comment: who of course has moved on to Manchester City.\n20:26 Comment: And some profit for Everton.\n20:33 Comment: Baines.\n20:35 Comment: Davis.\n20:39 Comment: Colgate.\n20:42 Comment: Everton blue in the middle.\n20:44 Comment: Lukaku, quite sure what he saw there.\n20:49 Comment: A little give and go, Mason Colgate rolls the ball into him,\n20:51 Comment: he's just trying to lay that ball off, there's too much on it.\n20:54 Comment: Lukaku is all about his goals, but his link play is absolutely vital,\n20:57 Comment: when you're the lone striker, the big target man.\n21:0 Comment: That has to be absolutely spot on, just overcooks it.\n21:5 Comment: We've had a handful of early goals here.\n21:10 Comment: Everton are specialists at getting late ones.\n21:13 Comment: They might need to call upon that particular attribute.\n21:33 Comment: Marti, one of a number of players that has to use at the start of the season\n21:37 Comment: to fulfil the gap, a considerable gap left by the move from Munguela Conte to Chelsea.\n21:48 Comment: Chilwell goes across.\n21:58 Comment: Some talk that Ben Chilwell might be playing his football here on Merseyside,\n22:4 Comment: a lot of interest from Liverpool.\n22:7 Comment: Before really he was tested in Leicester's first team.\n22:15 Comment: Morales.\n22:18 Comment: Room for Holgate now.\n22:24 Comment: A reasonable way for Everton to get forward.\n22:27 Comment: Lukaku, to link up with Gaye, he's fed it into him.\n22:31 Comment: Now Davis, and this is Gaye again.\n22:35 Comment: Barkley, to whip it in for Lukaku!\n22:43 Comment: Top quality.\n22:46 Comment: The delivery and the header.\n22:49 Comment: Robbo Lukaku extends his wonderful scoring streak here in home games\n22:56 Comment: and in the Premier League in general.\n22:59 Comment: This is one of the crosses of the season for the player,\n23:1 Comment: I said he needs to influence the game more.\n23:3 Comment: It is quite brilliant, Robert Huth gets caught ball-watching,\n23:6 Comment: he's no idea that Lukaku is at his back.\n23:9 Comment: Ross Barkley doesn't get any better than that, it's a dream for a centre-forward.\n23:13 Comment: The ball's in front of him, he can time his run, he can have a look at Schmeichel,\n23:17 Comment: and he was never going to miss, but it's all about the ball in from Barkley,\n23:20 Comment: that is simply sensational.\n23:22 Comment: Lukaku scores in eight successive home games in all competitions,\n23:28 Comment: the best stunt by an Everton player since 1965.\n23:33 Comment: Fred Pickering managed it in eight games in a row, 64-65.\n23:42 Comment: No wonder they've got that big deal on the table for him.\n23:46 Comment: Would have been surprising if he missed that opportunity,\n23:48 Comment: but again Ross Barkley, how many players in wide areas try to pick people out,\n23:51 Comment: be too precise, he plays that ball into space,\n23:54 Comment: he expects Lukaku to move into, that is why it's so brilliant.\n23:58 Comment: And this is why the Premier League is so brilliant.\n24:2 Comment: You could make a case for not so much to play for here.\n24:8 Comment: Everton are almost certain to finish no lower than seventh,\n24:12 Comment: they've got a seven-point gap on eighth place.\n24:17 Comment: And Leicester, yes, we've talked a lot about the Champions League being on their minds,\n24:22 Comment: but people like Ronald Koeman don't do dead rubbers.\n24:33 Comment: More of the same please, lads.\n24:35 Comment: Here's Gay.\n24:40 Comment: Jagielka.\n24:42 Comment: Baines.\n24:43 Comment: Morales.\n24:57 Comment: Davis, who opened the scoring.\n25:5 Comment: A few negative thoughts so far.\n25:8 Comment: Jagielka's back pass, but he was under pressure.\n25:13 Comment: Baines.\n25:19 Comment: O'Brien's interception, I don't know how much intent there was by Baines there.\n25:23 Comment: Certainly interrupted the chance for O'Brien to get beyond him.\n25:27 Comment: Quite a tricky call for Bobby Maddley.\n25:31 Comment: I'm afraid he's just giving himself some time to have a little look at it,\n25:34 Comment: have a think about it.\n25:36 Comment: He's slightly late, he certainly catches O'Brien,\n25:38 Comment: he's only two minutes in it, he just leaves that left leg there for O'Brien to fall over.\n25:42 Comment: I'm sure it's only going to be just a word.\n25:59 Comment: Of course, O'Brien's goal didn't come from in the penalty area.\n26:3 Comment: Lovely take by Gray.\n26:6 Comment: Just feel Demare Gray is on the verge of being right up there with a penalty.\n26:10 Comment: He's taken it once every time, the signing from Birmingham City, of course.\n26:15 Comment: He was a super boy there.\n26:21 Comment: A big point for O'Brien.\n26:23 Comment: He's got a chance to get back on the pitch.\n26:28 Comment: A super boy there.\n26:32 Comment: A big point for Demare Gray, he's actually getting into the side,\n26:35 Comment: with Maira Zenil-Brighton being so successful in that title-winning season.\n26:38 Comment: He's just actually getting games, it was his problem, he's getting more now.\n26:42 Comment: Morales.\n26:52 Comment: In the way to Davies by O'Brien.\n26:54 Comment: The tacking.\n26:59 Comment: Morales.\n27:1 Comment: Davies.\n27:3 Comment: Barclay.\n27:4 Comment: I think the World had to be careful with the challenge.\n27:6 Comment: Huth is no nonsense through the clearance.\n27:14 Comment: I just sense the players are enjoying it as much as we are,\n27:17 Comment: and maybe not all the defenders.\n27:20 Comment: Robert Huth, happy to hack that one away.\n27:24 Comment: I suppose we shouldn't be too surprised at the goals that have gone in between these two sides.\n27:27 Comment: The last eight Premier League games between them, 30 goals have gone in,\n27:30 Comment: so we shouldn't be expecting a kick-off.\n27:42 Comment: Some of the understandable support here,\n27:46 Comment: maybe it just crossed the barrier to inappropriate language,\n27:49 Comment: if you picked up something that's offensive we do apologise.\n27:53 Comment: A little bit of inappropriate behaviour here.\n27:58 Comment: It's more than verbal.\n28:5 Comment: Kevin Morales is a big lad, he's going to pick on anyone.\n28:8 Comment: He won't pick on someone bigger than himself.\n28:11 Comment: Morales!\n28:19 Comment: Let the ball hit the box, yeah!\n28:21 Comment: Morales has tried to disappear from the scene of the crime.\n28:31 Comment: Morales is clearly unhappy.\n28:32 Comment: He'd gone in-field and the Leicester players were nibbling away at him.\n28:36 Comment: He clearly feels that they overstepped the mark.\n28:40 Comment: He's got no choice, both players grab a hold of each other.\n28:50 Comment: The back is just nibbling away.\n28:53 Comment: It's not the worst you've ever seen, is it?\n28:55 Comment: It's a bit of an overreaction from Morales.\n28:59 Comment: Kaku saying he's going to pick on anyone, Robert Hood's picked on me.\n29:2 Comment: The man that perhaps Everton would have liked to have had on the field then, is actually sitting on the bench.\n29:16 Comment: There he is, big Duncan.\n29:18 Comment: Duncan Ferguson.\n29:23 Comment: Not many picked on him.\n29:24 Comment: Here's Gate.\n29:38 Comment: Jagielka.\n29:43 Comment: In by Baines.\n29:44 Comment: A bit narrow for Everton, although Holgate was getting three.\n29:51 Comment: They were close enough to goal to think about working the central route.\n29:56 Comment: It's very congested, but they can get a decent ball into Lukaku, very important for Everton to try and play with as much width as they can.\n30:3 Comment: Full-backs forward, yet crosses in.\n30:8 Comment: Mbappé trying to anticipate, read the mind of Phil Jagielka.\n30:20 Comment: Monday night football comes from Southurst Park, Crystal Palace against Arsenal.\n30:24 Comment: Both clubs with plenty to play for, and Claudio Ranieri in the studio to analyse the events there.\n30:30 Comment: And what the Premier League has produced this weekend.\n30:38 Comment: However he says it, it will be charming.\n30:47 Comment: Barkley.\n30:49 Comment: Schneiderlin.\n30:51 Comment: Back against Leicester in the Community Shield, back in August, a late substitute for Manchester United.\n30:57 Comment: All being surplus to the Marino requirements here.\n31:1 Comment: Barkley.\n31:6 Comment: Holgate.\n31:19 Comment: Everton's throw.\n31:21 Comment: That's the kind of dominant driving performance we're seeing here from Ross Barkley.\n31:25 Comment: Pulling the strings, want to see more of that from him.\n31:29 Comment: Lukaku.\n31:33 Comment: Baines.\n31:34 Comment: Leicester can nick it, the counter-attack might be on.\n31:40 Comment: Drink water.\n31:44 Comment: Probably mad he looked to say he was going to blow the whistle then, but decided not to.\n31:48 Comment: Free kick in Leicester's favour.\n32:7 Comment: Half an hour, fast and furious.\n32:14 Comment: And four goals.\n32:18 Comment: Come on, Jo!\n32:26 Comment: Time for a touch for Ben Chilwell.\n32:32 Comment: Vardy.\n32:34 Comment: Schneiderlin.\n32:36 Comment: Becoming a growing influence in the game for Everton's midfield.\n32:38 Comment: Barkley.\n32:44 Comment: Schneiderlin again.\n32:47 Comment: Vardy recognising that Frenchman needs to be controlled a little bit more.\n32:56 Comment: Holgate.\n32:58 Comment: That's made a good run, run beyond Lukaku.\n33:2 Comment: And trying to block the cross, goes down to Slimani.\n33:7 Comment: He's committed a foul in doing so, and it's really entirely for Slimani.\n33:10 Comment: He gets caught ball-watching, doesn't stay with the overlap and run of Holgate,\n33:13 Comment: and then goes to ground, and he's nowhere near the ball, just takes Holgate's legs away.\n33:18 Comment: He's got to appreciate the overlapping run of the full-back, stay with him,\n33:20 Comment: he doesn't do that and he's always playing catch-up.\n33:38 Comment: Oh, no.\n33:40 Comment: Good hockey, it'll be a short corner, a penalty corner.\n33:45 Comment: Unusual position to get a delivery like this in football.\n33:52 Comment: That's Ross Bartley, got in mind for Everton.\n33:58 Comment: Arden Lo towards Morales.\n34:2 Comment: Leighton Baines.\n34:4 Comment: Get it onto his left foot.\n34:7 Comment: Davis.\n34:10 Comment: Gianchialca, floating it in.\n34:13 Comment: And Kacper Schmeichel.\n34:16 Comment: First thought, to look long, but there was nothing on.\n34:25 Comment: The tempo of this game has been terrific, and the forward thinking of both teams.\n34:30 Comment: Leicester have had much less of the ball, but that is the game that they've regained in recent weeks.\n34:39 Comment: Snemani.\n34:43 Comment: Corner off Jack Elfrey, wasn't under too much pressure,\n34:45 Comment: a little bit annoyed with himself, but he didn't just cushion that and clear it.\n34:49 Comment: He's pulled out the best Leicester could hope for,\n34:51 Comment: because Snemani had Hany Vardy in the penalty area,\n34:53 Comment: Leicester midfielders weren't making up the ground, so they'll take the set-piece.\n35:9 Comment: Good, by Morales, but he was actually the furthest forward.\n35:14 Comment: Schmeichel, on the ground where his father scored a Premier League goal,\n35:17 Comment: Peter, the uninitiated, was a goalkeeper.\n35:20 Comment: For the one or two of you who don't know that.\n35:22 Comment: He scored here for Aston Villa against Everton.\n35:26 Comment: He was quite far enough forward, Kasper then.\n35:29 Comment: He's got a bit of a problem with his left foot,\n35:31 Comment: he's got a bit of a problem with his right foot,\n35:33 Comment: he's got a problem with his left foot,\n35:35 Comment: he's got a problem with his right foot,\n35:37 Comment: he's quite far enough forward, Kasper then, to make it a family double.\n35:56 Comment: Pooh.\n35:59 Comment: Pogba made it his.\n36:2 Comment: Morales, who really, I think we should credit for starting it off with that bold break,\n36:6 Comment: that led to Tom Davies' opening goal.\n36:11 Comment: Here he goes again, the Belgian.\n36:15 Comment: OK.\n36:16 Comment: Barkley.\n36:20 Comment: Good anticipation.\n36:22 Comment: Andy King with a block.\n36:31 Comment: Morales.\n36:37 Comment: Lukaku.\n36:39 Comment: On the burst, but not on the target.\n36:42 Comment: He should be doing a lot better, he's done all the hard work.\n36:45 Comment: He knows he can that type of position on his favourite left foot.\n36:49 Comment: Good run off the ball from Hogan, just to open up a bit of space for Lukaku,\n36:52 Comment: once he gets past Chilwell.\n36:54 Comment: It's just about composure, just pass it towards that far post.\n36:57 Comment: Just leaning back slightly, too much power in it, that's why it's way wide of the target.\n37:0 Comment: He's chasing a record held by a great Dixie Dean, 12 home games in a row he's scored in.\n37:7 Comment: Half in the 1930s.\n37:15 Comment: Slimani.\n37:23 Comment: A bit of a hop kick forward.\n37:25 Comment: Holgate.\n37:31 Comment: Oh, dear.\n37:39 Comment: Just going back, Martins, that opportunity for Lukaku,\n37:41 Comment: there's a good flexibility in the air, it's an attack,\n37:43 Comment: we've seen players pop up in a variety of positions,\n37:45 Comment: Lukaku going from centre forward, out wide, making things happen,\n37:48 Comment: Morales and Barkley coming in field into central area,\n37:50 Comment: so they're always giving Leicester back four something to think about.\n37:54 Comment: Mane's just got there first, and fairly, Morales got there first, and fairly.\n37:58 Comment: Davis.\n38:0 Comment: Barkley.\n38:3 Comment: King trying to buy Leicester a bit of time here.\n38:7 Comment: Gay.\n38:9 Comment: Xabi Alka encouraged to come forward.\n38:18 Comment: Morales.\n38:22 Comment: Davis.\n38:24 Comment: Now the team doesn't panic under pressure.\n38:38 Comment: Barkley.\n38:40 Comment: Can Everton get back in front before half-time?\n38:43 Comment: Half-time.\n38:48 Comment: Men on a mission here on Merseyside.\n38:51 Comment: Morales on his mission, Gay.\n38:55 Comment: Barkley, Gay deflected, corner.\n39:1 Comment: The ball really is zipping about.\n39:3 Comment: Very hard for Kacper Spiegel to get himself set here,\n39:5 Comment: he's never really sure when the shot is going to come in,\n39:7 Comment: then there's a deflection, but easily dribbled into the far corner.\n39:14 Comment: Go on, go on.\n39:28 Comment: Front zone done.\n39:31 Comment: By Drinkwater.\n39:35 Comment: And Barkley is in!\n39:37 Comment: Oh, it's Michael.\n39:39 Comment: Did remarkably to stop that being an open goal for Rolf Barkley,\n39:43 Comment: reflects on how he didn't devour that chance.\n39:47 Comment: It's an extraordinary piece of goalkeeping from Schmeichel,\n39:50 Comment: Tom Davis showing eager tackle as well,\n39:52 Comment: he's certainly onside Barkley, looks like he's done everything right.\n39:55 Comment: But the way Schmeichel manages to make it a yard up,\n39:58 Comment: so when he dies he gets his fingertips on the ball, brilliant stop.\n40:4 Comment: Another Everton corner.\n40:9 Comment: Phil Jagielka scores for the second game in a row,\n40:12 Comment: and Everton lead for the second time in this extraordinary third half.\n40:17 Comment: Schmeichel stops Barkley scoring, but no-one but Leicester can stop Phil Jagielka.\n40:25 Comment: This is how you take a set-piece, it's flat, it's pacing,\n40:28 Comment: Schmeichel can't come off his line and deal with it.\n40:32 Comment: There's a composed header from Jagielka,\n40:34 Comment: doesn't try and batter it towards the goal,\n40:36 Comment: the pace is on the ball, just redirects it,\n40:38 Comment: there's nothing Schmeichel can do about this,\n40:40 Comment: it's a brilliant ball in for Morales,\n40:42 Comment: and once Jagielka gets on the move in between Leicester players,\n40:45 Comment: they have got a major problem, it's a brilliant set-piece goal.\n40:52 Comment: I think it's fair to say that this sporting weekend\n40:55 Comment: up here in the city of Liverpool\n40:57 Comment: didn't stop when they roared home the winner of the Grand National.\n41:3 Comment: This is grand and it's international.\n41:6 Comment: It's the Premier League, and it's Everton 3-2 Leicester.\n41:12 Comment: And there's still four minutes to go to half-time.\n41:37 Comment: FANS SHOUT OUT\n41:55 Comment: VARDI.\n41:56 Comment: Gray trying to get away.\n41:58 Comment: Huntington, trying to earn his spurs at this level,\n42:1 Comment: he's not as far forward as Tom Davies or Mason Holgate,\n42:5 Comment: but he's getting chances because of the indisposition of others.\n42:12 Comment: It's probably a good thing that Ashley Williams isn't playing today,\n42:16 Comment: he really fell out big time with Leicester when he was at Swansea.\n42:24 Comment: Particularly Riyad Mahrez.\n42:30 Comment: And Alas, now Gray.\n42:36 Comment: FANS SHOUT OUT\n42:40 Comment: Fine play by De Mare Gray, Albrighton.\n42:43 Comment: Leicester come again.\n42:46 Comment: Amati.\n42:48 Comment: Albrighton.\n42:49 Comment: Slimane.\n42:52 Comment: Big danger in the air to Everton.\n42:55 Comment: How frustrating it is to be a goalkeeper,\n42:57 Comment: he performs miracles here, Kasper Smeichel to keep out Ross Barkley.\n43:1 Comment: Takes that extra step, long reach.\n43:4 Comment: It looked like Barkley was going to tuck it home,\n43:6 Comment: and his defenders go to sleep on the set-piece.\n43:9 Comment: It's a wonderful ball in for Morales, he's pinned on his goal line,\n43:12 Comment: he's hoping his defenders will help him out,\n43:14 Comment: and they don't, and Everton take the lead.\n43:29 Comment: Benelouane.\n43:31 Comment: Headed on by Slimane, taken on by Gray,\n43:34 Comment: but he can't slide it through to Vardy.\n43:53 Comment: It's probably only right that Everton go in at half-time leading,\n43:55 Comment: because since Leicester took the lead, it's been all about Everton,\n43:58 Comment: dominating possession, creating the best opportunities they have,\n44:1 Comment: not the most threatening.\n44:3 Comment: They've finally got their noses in front.\n44:6 Comment: In the ear of a man who thinks it's 0-0,\n44:9 Comment: or his team's cruising,\n44:11 Comment: the rest of us have got hairs up on the back of our necks,\n44:14 Comment: I can tell you.\n44:15 Comment: It's been mesmerising.\n44:18 Comment: I just wonder from Koeman's point of view,\n44:20 Comment: it's great of course he's scored three,\n44:21 Comment: but will he be happy that his team have conceded two?\n44:24 Comment: You're absolutely right, Andy, but he's not showing that.\n44:28 Comment: He's the Iceman.\n44:33 Comment: Another card, because of course there was a previous incident\n44:36 Comment: involving Leighton Baines that he got away with.\n44:39 Comment: That's what it's all about, the referee's probably saying that to him,\n44:41 Comment: he caught Albrighton earlier, and then he warns you,\n44:43 Comment: then you do it again, I'm going to book you.\n44:45 Comment: This is real danger, set pieces with Albrighton,\n44:47 Comment: Robles made a mess of the last one,\n44:49 Comment: he'll get his positioning sorted out now.\n44:54 Comment: FANS SHOUT OUT\n45:12 Comment: Got to get breezier here at Goodison\n45:14 Comment: as the temperatures have dropped later in the day.\n45:18 Comment: In by Albrighton, and finally in is Lemarne.\n45:22 Comment: In the nooks.\n45:24 Comment: That's a brilliant defensive header from Jackie Elk.\n45:26 Comment: Football in from Albrighton, but it's Jackie Elkiru.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Everton start.\n0:6 Comment: Another one of the first defensive header.\n0:15 Comment: Forward by Jack Elker.\n0:22 Comment: Jack Elker again.\n0:24 Comment: A clash of heads.\n0:33 Comment: A nasty collision.\n0:35 Comment: Jack Elker eyes on the ball.\n0:39 Comment: It's not exactly a clash of heads.\n0:43 Comment: Schneidlin knocked to the ground, actually holding his back.\n0:46 Comment: The problem here is Schneidlin is looking to screen Slimane,\n0:49 Comment: because Slimane is dropping off and looking to flip those balls on towards Jamie Vardy.\n0:52 Comment: But he's gloves on, is he feeling the cold?\n0:55 Comment: Well, to be fair, it's been a beautiful day,\n0:58 Comment: till about kick-off time.\n1:0 Comment: Temperatures, I'm sure, above 20 degrees.\n1:3 Comment: But once the sun's gone in,\n1:5 Comment: a reminder of the time of year that it is.\n1:13 Comment: But he is the only player wearing gloves, isn't he?\n1:17 Comment: Yeah, they didn't have gloves on Morales and Huth, did they?\n1:20 Comment: Apart from the keepers, obviously.\n1:22 Comment: Here's Lukaku.\n1:27 Comment: Barkley.\n1:32 Comment: Yes, Barkley has to live with a huge sense of expectation\n1:35 Comment: about his play week in, week out.\n1:39 Comment: He's certainly delivering today.\n1:42 Comment: Lukaku will tell you.\n1:45 Comment: Beautifully backheeled by Lukaku.\n1:48 Comment: Holgate, here is Barkley.\n1:52 Comment: He wasn't appealing.\n1:55 Comment: And if that is true, they were, but...\n1:57 Comment: Barkley getting up and getting on with it.\n2:0 Comment: That's the first thing you look for when a player goes to ground in the penalty area,\n2:2 Comment: any appeals towards the referee, there isn't.\n2:4 Comment: A little bit of footwork, Danny Drinkwater steps across,\n2:6 Comment: gets a foot on the ball, there's no foul.\n2:9 Comment: Davies.\n2:12 Comment: Filling in the sandwich.\n2:18 Comment: Well, the various England managers at different underage groups\n2:21 Comment: are queuing up for services.\n2:25 Comment: There is an under-21 tournament, he hasn't figured in that group yet,\n2:29 Comment: but they keep playing Premier League football.\n2:32 Comment: Hayley Boothroyd is in charge of the team.\n2:34 Comment: They keep playing Premier League football.\n2:37 Comment: Hayley Boothroyd is in charge of that.\n2:39 Comment: We'll be bringing you that action on Sky Sports in June.\n2:44 Comment: You never know, it might feature Tom Davies.\n2:50 Comment: Namaati.\n2:54 Comment: By Albright looking for Slimani, Jagielko happy to go and get it.\n2:57 Comment: Barkley, likewise, slamming in with Drinkwater.\n3:1 Comment: Barkley again, shot taken on by Morales,\n3:4 Comment: trying to catch Schmeichel out with an early effort.\n3:8 Comment: The idea is certainly right,\n3:10 Comment: having missed some hard work by Ross Barkley, winning the ball back.\n3:13 Comment: The keeper has a good view of it, knows exactly what Morales is looking to do,\n3:16 Comment: and Schmeichel's positioning means it's a comfortable save.\n3:20 Comment: Slimani trying to flick it on.\n3:26 Comment: Come on, Craig Shakespeare.\n3:30 Comment: He knows that 100 per cent record isn't going to go on forever,\n3:34 Comment: but when he was 2-1 up with a quick turnaround,\n3:38 Comment: he obviously would have seen potential in getting something from this game,\n3:41 Comment: and that still exists even though they're 3-2 down.\n3:44 Comment: Still couldn't quite get that, another young Englishman on view.\n4:14 Comment: Hit on by Lukaku, Morales.\n4:20 Comment: Davis thinking he might be able to let that run and get on to it,\n4:23 Comment: but Albright had other ideas, interception by Idrissa Gueye,\n4:27 Comment: so good at reclaiming possession for Everton.\n4:31 Comment: Barkley, Gueye, slick again.\n4:39 Comment: Lukaku, almost just a little bit under hit,\n4:42 Comment: but he might have made a bit more effort to get there.\n4:46 Comment: Barkley's looking incredibly sharp today, he's hardly giving the ball away at all.\n4:50 Comment: Barkley, Davis, King's challenge.\n4:55 Comment: Albright trying to play it forward earlier,\n4:58 Comment: but he had to come to feet that time.\n5:1 Comment: Here's Slimani.\n5:5 Comment: It's deflected into the side netting.\n5:7 Comment: Not lucky here, Leicester.\n5:11 Comment: Just the wrong side of the post for them.\n5:14 Comment: Helping out defensively, covers the ground to get back,\n5:16 Comment: that could easily sneak past the key to the near post.\n5:24 Comment: Morale right behind, the goal at this end from a corner from this side.\n5:31 Comment: Lukaku, and...\n5:33 Comment: Milan was up.\n5:36 Comment: Robert Huth was trying to add to the couple of goals he scored\n5:40 Comment: at Goodison Park in his Stoke City days.\n5:50 Comment: That's where they needed him defensively.\n6:4 Comment: Drinkwater saying, I'll have it.\n6:13 Comment: Everton might hold too high a line, it's always risky against Leicester.\n6:19 Comment: Slimani, head it across goal towards Vardy.\n6:24 Comment: Forward by Holgate, wasn't the worst ball to at least get his team up the pitch a bit.\n6:29 Comment: Vardy in the side, they're looking to turn Everton, but with Slimani in there as well,\n6:33 Comment: has the ability to get hold of the ball as he's doing here,\n6:35 Comment: has the aerial ability to flip things on.\n6:37 Comment: Here is Vardy.\n6:39 Comment: Got by Schneidlin.\n6:50 Comment: Tom Davis gave Patrick Davison a delightful pre-match interview.\n6:54 Comment: Smiles and genuine belief in the fairy tale that he's living out here.\n7:4 Comment: An engaging young man, and he'll be giving plenty of chance to the media in the years to come.\n7:12 Comment: I do think the more attacking goal he's got in the side with Schneidlin,\n7:14 Comment: he's sitting a bit deeper, Tom Davis could play there comfortably\n7:17 Comment: with his maturity and range of passing, but playing him further forward\n7:20 Comment: and inviting him to get on the ball and make things happen at 18 years old,\n7:23 Comment: it's hard to dominate games in the Premier League, but he has the ability to do that.\n7:33 Comment: What a policy that Roberto Martinez initiated for Tom Davis was concerned.\n7:42 Comment: He left Everton with the opposition when Leicester were crowned champions.\n7:48 Comment: They've already mathematically won the league.\n7:52 Comment: It was such a joyous, celebratory occasion.\n8:0 Comment: So joyous there for Slimane, who thought he was away from Idrissa Gueye.\n8:18 Comment: It's not a lead that Everton can rest on.\n8:24 Comment: Schneidlin.\n8:25 Comment: I'm a bit disappointed though, I've had eight minutes in the second half and I haven't had a goal yet.\n8:35 Comment: Chop of the shoulder by Robles, who got Vardy out of his eye line.\n8:42 Comment: Davis. Lukaku.\n8:45 Comment: Chilwell trying to stay with him.\n8:52 Comment: In goes Lukaku.\n8:57 Comment: Pooh.\n8:59 Comment: Up towards Vardy, well cut out by Pennington.\n9:6 Comment: Barkley.\n9:8 Comment: King's tackle.\n9:11 Comment: All right, in too much of a hurry.\n9:21 Comment: Barkley and Lukaku subject to some fear that they've been singled out after the latest trip to Anfield, where Everton really\n9:32 Comment: weren't as competitive as they would have hoped to have been.\n9:34 Comment: It was a collective shortfall, just on the shoulders of two of their finer players.\n9:44 Comment: Liverpool have done the double over them again this season.\n9:49 Comment: But only Liverpool have won here in the Premier League.\n9:55 Comment: 18 games, just that one defeat.\n9:58 Comment: And Martí did well, because Morales was almost in behind him.\n10:4 Comment: In goes Schneidlin.\n10:7 Comment: I think it's fair to say it's not a Pep Guardiola type of game.\n10:13 Comment: I think they'll be watching on thinking this is absolutely horrendous, neither side is absolutely dominating the ball.\n10:20 Comment: Drinkwater, Vardy chasing. Pennington might have a problem here.\n10:25 Comment: Vardy with much greater know-how.\n10:26 Comment: And a supporting cast not quite there in time for Leicester, and there are plenty of them.\n10:34 Comment: In the end, Schneidlin has been an important figure in this Everton performance, and his comeback after a calf strain.\n10:43 Comment: A little bit of maturity alongside the youngsters.\n10:50 Comment: Drinkwater, Schneidlin there again.\n10:54 Comment: Just a move ahead of the opposition with the ball and without them.\n11:1 Comment: Holgate.\n11:6 Comment: Gay, Barkley.\n11:10 Comment: Davis always wanting to be involved.\n11:15 Comment: A good battle between Albrighton and Baines.\n11:18 Comment: Here's Morales.\n11:22 Comment: Using that change of pace again, getting a corner out of it.\n11:27 Comment: And now scored Everton from corners in three consecutive Premier League matches.\n11:34 Comment: Another chance to rack up that stat here.\n11:43 Comment: When you're a wide player, isolated against a full-back, you can't get a cross in, get the next best thing, which is a set-piece.\n11:56 Comment: Zagelka, Lukaku!\n12:0 Comment: 4-2 Everton.\n12:7 Comment: The set-piece does the trick again.\n12:11 Comment: That's not exactly as it was set up to do, but that doesn't worry the boys in blue.\n12:18 Comment: It's Poor again defensively from Leicester, looks like Zagelka should score here.\n12:23 Comment: Doesn't make clean contact on it, and Robert Huth has to really throw himself at Lukaku,\n12:27 Comment: he's always going to shoot when the ball breaks his way, just that lack of reaction.\n12:31 Comment: Far too easy for Lukaku to tuck it home, and that could be terminal now for Leicester.\n12:36 Comment: Again, really poor defensively from a set-piece, not doing their jobs,\n12:40 Comment: and the ball breaks, not reacting quickly enough, Lukaku.\n12:42 Comment: Well, he certainly did.\n12:45 Comment: He's on to the second ball to score his second goal, and is 23rd in the Premier League this season.\n12:55 Comment: The only negative for Everton is...\n12:59 Comment: He's going to need more noughts on the contract.\n13:3 Comment: Well, I don't think it's about the money.\n13:6 Comment: It's about what Everton can deliver in terms of ambition and level of football there.\n13:12 Comment: Facing, of course, a team in the Champions League already in the quarter-final to come on Wednesday.\n13:18 Comment: And it's certainly enlivening their own European ambitions.\n13:27 Comment: Are you happier now, Mr Hinscliffe, you've seen a goal in the second half?\n13:32 Comment: I just felt as though I was getting short-changed, he'd gone every nine minutes in the first half,\n13:35 Comment: and I don't want to wait far too long.\n13:38 Comment: I know you have a voracious appetite for food, as goals as well.\n13:43 Comment: Here's Barkley.\n13:49 Comment: Lukaku, on a hat-trick.\n13:53 Comment: Holgate.\n13:57 Comment: A disconcerted Robert Hood.\n13:59 Comment: Holgate does well to go in again.\n14:1 Comment: Davies trying to get there, just beaten to it by King.\n14:16 Comment: Changing the foot for Leicester.\n14:25 Comment: He is great.\n14:28 Comment: King.\n14:35 Comment: Drink water.\n14:41 Comment: Fired in to Vardy.\n14:43 Comment: Pennington's done well against the England striker.\n14:47 Comment: Lukaku.\n14:49 Comment: Holds off Huth in a real battle of strength.\n14:53 Comment: And Kevin Radley shakes his head.\n14:55 Comment: Huth won the battle of strength that time.\n14:59 Comment: Everton are winning the war.\n15:3 Comment: And now are gone.\n15:5 Comment: I think Bobby Radley feels that Lukaku wants to go far too easily.\n15:10 Comment: It's time for Riyad Mahrez, one of those rested at the start,\n15:15 Comment: but half an hour of action here.\n15:20 Comment: Mahrez who sets up Somani for Leicester's first goal.\n15:28 Comment: And it's in.\n15:30 Comment: It's in.\n16:9 Comment: It's pretty good.\n16:11 Comment: It's in.\n16:15 Comment: It's a goal.\n16:18 Comment: Goal.\n16:23 Comment: It's in.\n16:28 Comment: It is extraordinary how a throwing on the halfway line can evoke such emotions.\n16:35 Comment: It always does.\n16:43 Comment: That's a manager who's team are two goals up.\n16:51 Comment: Shridhara Barkley.\n16:55 Comment: Gay.\n17:14 Comment: Jagielka.\n17:16 Comment: That's Gay.\n17:18 Comment: Moosar trying to get there.\n17:20 Comment: Everton certainly got the radar right for their passing now.\n17:25 Comment: A little bit more of a defeated look for Leicester.\n17:30 Comment: Can't rule them out.\n17:33 Comment: Amati.\n17:34 Comment: Mahrez.\n17:35 Comment: King.\n17:36 Comment: Nearly trying to get Moosar away.\n17:40 Comment: Here's Barkley.\n17:42 Comment: That's what the referee does so well, he mixes his game up, he drops short,\n17:45 Comment: it's the ball into his feet, he looks to spin.\n17:47 Comment: The shoulder of defenders so hard to defend against.\n17:55 Comment: King.\n17:56 Comment: Nearly there.\n17:59 Comment: That's a goal.\n18:0 Comment: Nearly there.\n18:1 Comment: That's a goal.\n18:11 Comment: King.\n18:12 Comment: That ball goal.\n18:13 Comment: Partly played by Bobby Matthew, he may well revisit Andy King.\n18:18 Comment: Lukaku's lattened as well.\n18:20 Comment: But Everton still have the ball.\n18:22 Comment: Lukaku, can he see a gap for the shot?\n18:25 Comment: And he couldn't, they couldn't find the pass for a willing ally that Kevin Morales has been today.\n18:33 Comment: Here's Riyad Mahrez.\n18:35 Comment: And they try to meet fire with five-0.\n18:38 Comment: It's a free-kick to Leicester.\n18:40 Comment: Bobby Matthew will be having a look for Andy King.\n18:55 Comment: Bobby Matthew as well, he's trying to let the game flow as much as possible.\n18:58 Comment: It's a late challenge from King, it is a yellow card.\n19:1 Comment: He was up and got on with the game, so the referee did the right thing, Everton still in possession.\n19:8 Comment: But it is a Leicester free-kick.\n19:18 Comment: Taken by Mahrez.\n19:21 Comment: Quite got the range.\n19:37 Comment: Barclay.\n20:6 Comment: Mentioned that 6-3 against Bournemouth, Lukaku's got four in that of course.\n20:16 Comment: Two of the four here.\n20:26 Comment: New setter, Mahrez.\n20:36 Comment: Mahrez again.\n20:41 Comment: Moussa.\n20:43 Comment: And Salah Jagelka is having none of that.\n20:55 Comment: It's all more than a quarter of the game to go.\n21:9 Comment: And scored two in quick succession in the first half.\n21:12 Comment: Leicester may be in the white shirts, but there's no white flag from them as yet.\n21:17 Comment: Mahrez.\n21:48 Comment: See quite so many of the long throws these days, but Moussa has a go.\n21:56 Comment: Jagelka.\n21:58 Comment: Drinkwater.\n22:0 Comment: Now Marti.\n22:4 Comment: A weak cross by Moussa, I think.\n22:7 Comment: Turned out to be a pass from Mahrez, but here comes Barclay on the charge.\n22:17 Comment: Pennington.\n22:27 Comment: Brighton giving chase.\n22:31 Comment: Pennington learning with every minute.\n22:34 Comment: Their experiences in the Premier League.\n22:37 Comment: Alongside Jagelka is an enormous help as well, because Jagelka will constantly talk to

    "summary": "In an exhilarating and action-packed encounter at Goodison Park, Everton triumphed over Leicester City with a thrilling 4-2 victory. The match brought out the best in both teams, delivering a spectacle that kept fans on the edge of their seats from the first whistle to the last.\n\nThe game started with a bang, setting the tone for what was to come. Just 30 seconds into the match, Bobby Madley let play continue despite what appeared to be a foul on Morales, which allowed Tom Davies, the young sensation from Everton’s academy, to score his second senior goal in outstanding fashion. Davies, showing maturity beyond his years, kept pace with Morales and seized the moment decisively. This whirlwind start lifted the spirits of the home supporters and served as a clear reminder of Everton's formidable presence at Goodison Park, where they have been a dominant force this season.\n\nLeicester, however, refused to be overwhelmed. Within minutes, they executed a classic counter-attack, catching Everton's defense off guard. Demarai Gray, bursting down the wing, laid a perfect pass to Islam Slimani, who, despite initial hesitation, controlled the ball well and tucked it past Joel Robles to equalize. It was Slimani's first away goal for Leicester, sparking immense excitement among the visiting fans.\n\nThe frenetic pace continued, and Everton did not ease off. Their relentless pressure resulted in another chance as the ball moved through the adept feet of Baines, Holgate, and Barkley, who kept probing through Leicester’s well-organized defense. Leicester, adapting with two solid defensive lines, staged a brief respite from the bombardment, but it wouldn't last long.\n\nIncredible scenes unfolded as Leicester took the lead from a seemingly innocuous position. Marc Albrighton delivered a free kick from a considerable distance out wide that somehow sailed over Robles and into the net. It was a freak goal, one that Robles would rue, having misjudged the flight. This turned the game on its head, reflecting the unpredictable nature of football.\n\nEverton, undeterred, mounted a rally, displaying superb team dynamics. Ross Barkley, Lukaku, and Morales were central figures in their offensive efforts. A game of high intensity and pressing continued on Everton's end, where after being temporarily set back, they reclaimed their dominance in possession. Their patience bore fruit as Barkley whipped in a cross of remarkable quality, meeting Lukaku's head, who nodded the ball firmly past Kasper Schmeichel to level the scores once again. This goal underscored Barkley's creative prowess and Lukaku's predatory instincts as a striker, continuing his excellent run of form.\n\nThe topsy-turvy nature of the first half saw moments of flair, resilience, and sheer brilliance. Everton capitalized on their set-piece opportunities efficiently. From a precise corner taken by Kevin Morales, Jagielka rose above the Leicester defense to head home, restoring Everton's lead just before the break. Schmeichel, who had moments earlier made a sensational save to deny Barkley, could do nothing to keep out Jagielka's effort. The half-time whistle blew with Everton leading 3-2 in a breathless first half full of drama.\n\nBoth teams emerged for the second half determined to impose themselves further. Everton, now with a slender lead, looked to consolidate their advantage. Leicester pressed for an equalizer as they tried to recapture the attacking verve that defined their opening bursts. Slimani and Vardy combined well, trying to unsettle the Everton backline, but Morgan Schneiderlin's composure and positioning were vital in neutralizing several Leicester attacks.\n\nDavies, Morales, and Barkley continued to link seamlessly, providing a continuous threat. However, every time Everton ventured forward, Leicester had potential on the counterattack, particularly with the pace and trickery of Demarai Gray and substitute Riyad Mahrez, who was introduced in hopes of adding a creative spark.\n\nEverton's defensive solidity came to the fore in these moments, marshaled adeptly by captain Phil Jagielka and the diligent work of Barry, who replaced Schneiderlin to add fresh legs and experience in midfield. This helped Everton resist Leicester's spells of pressure.\n\nThe pivotal moment came midway through the second half when another set-piece proved decisive. Phil Jagielka managed to get a touch on a corner delivery, with the ball eventually falling kindly to Lukaku, who made no mistake, drilling it past Schmeichel for his second goal of the match and effectively putting Everton in a commanding position at 4-2.\n\nAs the game waned, Leicester's efforts to mount a comeback grew more desperate but less cohesive. Everton managed the game skillfully, using their experience and tactical acumen to slow the tempo and control possession. Tactical fouls, astute positioning, and maintaining tight lines frustrated Leicester's attempts to carve out clear-cut opportunities.\n\nDespite the ebb and flow, the final phases of the game remained intense. Leicester continued to push men forward, winning corners and free-kicks in dangerous areas, yet Everton's defense held firm. Seamus Coleman’s replacement Mason Holgate, particularly, was notable for his defensive contributions and his willingness to push forward and support the attack when the opportunity presented itself.\n\nTo conclude the match, Everton stood their ground, and when the final whistle blew, they had secured a well-earned 4-2 victory. This win showcased Everton’s depth, resilience, and quality, affirming their status as a formidable side at Goodison Park.\n\nIn reflection, the match was a thrilling exhibit of Premier League football, featuring goals, skillful plays, and high drama. Individual brilliance from players like Barkley and Lukaku, combined with collective teamwork and tactical awareness, ensured Everton claimed all three points against a spirited Leicester City. The victory exemplified the relentless pursuit of success ingrained in Everton under Ronald Koeman’s management, while also illustrating the fluctuating fortunes and fierce competition that make the Premier League unpredictable and immensely engaging."
