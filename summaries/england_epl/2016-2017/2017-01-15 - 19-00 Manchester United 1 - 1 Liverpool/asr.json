morale-wise,\n2:11 Comment: momentum-wise as they are now with six straight Premier League wins,\n2:14 Comment: nine in all competitions.\n2:19 Comment: Origi muscling Valencia, Liverpool could be in here,\n2:23 Comment: but Origi running out of legs a little bit, but he's got a corner.\n2:27 Comment: And Milano is happy to be seen there, talking to Origi, saying to him,\n2:31 Comment: make it up now, put it into me.\n2:45 Comment: An early Liverpool corner at Old Trafford.\n2:49 Comment: Lovren's gone round the back.\n2:51 Comment: The...\n2:52 Comment: Attempts...\n2:53 Comment: Take two here.\n2:54 Comment: It's a good spotlighting because Paul Pogba got blocked and Lovren was free.\n2:58 Comment: If he'd been a glance to the back post, United were in trouble.\n3:3 Comment: Resuming...\n3:4 Comment: Better vigilance, the most expensive player.\n3:9 Comment: Just watch, Clavin's trying to block him.\n3:17 Comment: Milano tries again.\n3:18 Comment: He's got blocked again.\n3:19 Comment: And here, claims his start.\n3:21 Comment: Went deep.\n3:23 Comment: There he is.\n3:24 Comment: Little Croatian defender.\n3:26 Comment: That's a good jump, David de Gea was

for great involvement from the home support.\n4:16 Comment: And you can see a part of the picture that William Cox is going crazy at Mignolet.\n4:19 Comment: He's got a lot of good players.\n4:22 Comment: And it's a bit crazy that Mignolet, for not playing short, he wants his team to pass out from the back.\n4:26 Comment: Even if United do try and play high and stop them.\n4:30 Comment: And it's a bit crazy that Mignolet, for not playing short, he wants his team to pass out from the back.\n4:30 Comment: Even if United do try and play high and stop them.\n4:32 Comment: Henderson.\n4:33 Comment: And Wijnaldum.\n4:38 Comment: Lifting over.\n4:38 Comment: And the Qutari has just slipped.\n4:40 Comment: And Liverpool back on the ball with Wijnaldum again.\n4:44 Comment: Henderson.\n4:45 Comment: And for Origi.\n4:48 Comment: He's got plenty of muscle power through the middle.\n4:50 Comment: He's like a more...\n4:52 Comment: like a more recognised central striker than Roberto Firmino and indeed Daniel Sturridge\n5:1 Comment: in that respect he's got a physical presence\n5:7 Comment: Valencia, Riquitaria it's a big pitch it's a big ask of Wijnaldum and Champ if United can\n5:12 Comment: switch play with this diamond they're pressing over to the side Liverpool trying to get close\n5:16 Comment: the full-backs are going to get a lot of space\n5:24 Comment: chance enough to go out quickly on that side\n5:29 Comment: Everton earlier today spectacularly pulled back nice to the city but they were\n5:33 Comment: really big impressive moves for Chelsea and Tottenham and Arsenal yesterday\n5:39 Comment: that's reminding these two of what they've got to do to get closer to getting the trophy\n5:47 Comment: Great paddling left-back, Valencia first real thrust for Manchester United here\n5:57 Comment: H car get's it away,earches confidence and there's the hai boy Neymar\n6:8 Comment: he has a bit of a connection there\n6:11 Comment: Uncle John is actually the club's section guard\n6:14 Comment: is actually the club secretary of Manchester United.\n6:29 Comment: Milner into Origi, can't keep it,\n6:32 Comment: Liverpool need him to do that,\n6:35 Comment: give his game a bit better.\n6:37 Comment: And then the pressure cooker is this fixture.\n6:40 Comment: That's the difference, Daniel Scurridge will bring that under control,\n6:43 Comment: Origi's more suited to running in behind, really onto things.\n6:51 Comment: Hikotaro in, he'll squeeze it back to Valencia.\n6:58 Comment: Milner.\n7:0 Comment: That was a ball well measured for Adam Lallana,\n7:4 Comment: might take it on.\n7:9 Comment: Alexander-Arnold against his immediate foe today,\n7:13 Comment: Anthony Manning.\n7:13 Comment: Martial.\n7:17 Comment: He shouldn't forget, made his Premier League debut in this\n7:21 Comment: fixture the last time it was played.\n7:23 Comment: Came from the bench and wrapped up that 3-1 United win.\n7:35 Comment: Liverpool have won only one of the last seven against Manchester United,\n7:38 Comment: but they're unbeaten in the last three, if you take into account the two,\n7:43 Comment: agua Mariposa and Marieni.\n7:45 Comment: From the liquifying foe,\n7:47 Comment: Kylian Mbappe gave them something of a better game than Liverpool.\n7:50 Comment: So lastly, Virgilio Fields trying to get you a wake-over.\n7:53 Comment: And they have to trade a long Dom?\n7:54 Comment: Horn smiled.\n7:56 Comment: Struck!\n7:57 Comment: Steve Kel including Ed Gareth,\n8:0 Comment: his order to which,\n8:4 Comment: audiences also played in difficultyуем poor quality football.\n8:7 Comment: Winger!\n8:8 Comment: Booth to aer steroids over Understand,\n8:10 Comment: can't fix it.\n8:11 Comment: Sh масса,\n8:12 Comment: Henderson can't get it through beyond Ander Herrera.\n8:37 Comment: Milner pulled out wide to make himself a target for Mignolet.\n8:42 Comment: Michael Oliver's the referee.\n8:56 Comment: Clare.\n9:0 Comment: Clare might not have been playing today\n9:1 Comment: if Liverpool had to resolve that difficulty\n9:4 Comment: with the Cameroon federation,\n9:7 Comment: but Joel Matip...\n9:12 Comment: That was good from Wijnaldum, just backing up play.\n9:16 Comment: Backing up the second ball.\n9:25 Comment: Milner takes.\n9:26 Comment: Firmino on the run.\n9:27 Comment: Run offside.\n9:37 Comment: Let's hear from Jamie Redknapp,\n9:39 Comment: who's up on the gantry alongside us today.\n9:42 Comment: Jamie.\n9:42 Comment: Good afternoon, Martin.\n9:44 Comment: You get the feeling both teams are sparring at the moment,\n9:47 Comment: not a great deal happening.\n9:48 Comment: I think Gary touched on it with the two teams,\n9:50 Comment: with the system, certainly Liverpool playing with that diamond,\n9:53 Comment: and I do worry about Valencia for Liverpool,\n9:55 Comment: he's the one that can keep coming on,\n9:56 Comment: and I think Wijnaldum really wants to come out here, or Rigi,\n9:59 Comment: so that's where it's going to be a fascinating battle.\n10:1 Comment: I think Valencia could be a major problem as this game develops for Liverpool.\n10:7 Comment: Nice, they've got to get the full-backs in play,\n10:9 Comment: stretch, Liverpool midfield.\n10:12 Comment: Liverpool win another free kick.\n10:17 Comment: And Herrera, Carrick and Pogba have become a genuine three for Jose Mourinho.\n10:24 Comment: It's freed up Paul Pogba a little bit to be involved further forward.\n10:35 Comment: Lallana trying to run off Michael Carrick.\n10:42 Comment: Rigi.\n10:47 Comment: They've settled pretty well, Liverpool, first ten or eleven minutes.\n10:51 Comment: Nothing really, the other endings, Mignolet, and they've come forward.\n10:55 Comment: Slapped past Erlet.\n10:58 Comment: They've settled into the game.\n11:2 Comment: Liverpool have finished above United only twice in the 24 seasons of the Premier League,\n11:7 Comment: but in the 24 seasons prior to that, United ended above Liverpool just once.\n11:12 Comment: So they both have had two decades of domination.\n11:23 Comment: Here's Fulho.\n11:26 Comment: An unlikely important figure for Jose Mourinho.\n11:29 Comment: He's said it a number of times in the last few weeks,\n11:32 Comment: almost like Jose Mourinho stumbled across a back four and not letting him down,\n11:35 Comment: he's been very good this last minute or two in this run.\n11:39 Comment: And this case goes forward to...\n11:41 Comment: Damm.\n11:42 Comment: Darmian.\n11:45 Comment: Martial.\n11:47 Comment: Breaks to Martial again, quick feet from the Frenchman.\n11:50 Comment: Down he goes.\n11:51 Comment: My brother was having nothing to do with the United penalty claims.\n11:55 Comment: No, it's not a penalty, not wanting to see that again.\n12:0 Comment: I have to say, it came down that right side, Liverpool...\n12:5 Comment: ..just falling over.\n12:9 Comment: FULL-TIME WHISTLE BLOWS\n12:12 Comment: Jones.\n12:13 Comment: FULL-TIME WHISTLE BLOWS\n12:15 Comment: Led forward by Carrick.\n12:17 Comment: FULL-TIME WHISTLE BLOWS\n12:19 Comment: And by Henderson to Liverpool.\n12:21 Comment: Jones intervenes, the early search for supremacy here.\n12:25 Comment: I see Michael Carrick trying to force that pass through the middle,\n12:27 Comment: that will be difficult for Liverpool having so many bodies in there,\n12:29 Comment: they're going to have to go wide and switch play like this.\n12:32 Comment: Valencia.\n12:34 Comment: FULL-TIME WHISTLE BLOWS\n12:42 Comment: Flex\n13:0 Comment: FULL-TIME WHISTLE BLOWS\n13:7 Comment: WHOA!\n13:10 Comment: FULL-TIME WHISTLE BLOWS\n13:11 Comment: doesn't really want to get too close to him,\n13:13 Comment: does pretty much what he wants, Martial just drifts inside,\n13:16 Comment: he's nearly...\n13:17 Comment: just got a little bit too much on it.\n13:23 Comment: Van Dam was looking at the goalkeeper as if to say,\n13:25 Comment: come and help me out, but in the end it was just too much for Ibrahimovic,\n13:30 Comment: who has never won and not scored against Liverpool.\n13:36 Comment: Five previous appearances for three different clubs.\n13:41 Comment: One of which, of course, was Manchester United,\n13:44 Comment: in the 0-0 at Anfield in October.\n13:53 Comment: Lovren.\n13:55 Comment: Firmino.\n14:10 Comment: Another big comparison.\n14:11 Comment: Scurry between the two teams,\n14:12 Comment: it's been the amount of distance covered in matches.\n14:15 Comment: Liverpool the best, or the furthest, if you like,\n14:18 Comment: and United the lowest in that respect in the Premier League.\n14:21 Comment: Yeah, two completely contrasting styles,\n14:23 Comment: when you watch Liverpool play,\n14:25 Comment: they've obviously benefited from the three weeks they've had,\n14:29 Comment: but I have to say that the style of play,\n14:31 Comment: they're electrifying,\n14:32 Comment: when you get some of the games you know to before,\n14:34 Comment: the Arsenal away game, Chelsea away game, City last year,\n14:36 Comment: been absolutely brilliant to watch,\n14:38 Comment: and they do revolve a lot around those combinations, speed of play,\n14:41 Comment: and the reaction.\n14:42 Comment: The best team, along with Tottenham, I think, in terms of transition,\n14:45 Comment: of giving the ball away when you're back.\n14:47 Comment: They really are fantastic and nimble.\n14:50 Comment: The challenge over this last, I would say, probably two weeks,\n14:53 Comment: has been they've had games every three or four days,\n14:54 Comment: which disrupts that rhythm.\n14:57 Comment: If you look at the fixtures,\n15:0 Comment: in the six-game bunch,\n15:1 Comment: before, during and after the Christmas period,\n15:5 Comment: only two that got through them undefeated, these two.\n15:11 Comment: I think it's interesting to see Jose Mourinho writing his notes down there.\n15:15 Comment: It was Jürgen Klopp, of course, who passed a note\n15:17 Comment: from Southampton to Daniel Sturridge.\n15:21 Comment: Outlining the system that they were supposed to be switching to.\n15:34 Comment: Filling out each other in the first 15 minutes.\n15:41 Comment: FOOTBALL PLAYS\n15:42 Comment: You can see already,\n15:46 Comment: doing more running, United are more positional.\n15:52 Comment: They're always on the move, with and without the ball.\n15:59 Comment: That's the header.\n16:1 Comment: Mubehinovic.\n16:7 Comment: To give the ball to the quicker Pogba.\n16:11 Comment: Mubehinovic.\n16:17 Comment: Carrick's fighting to get to this one,\n16:19 Comment: but Mubehinovic got in front of him,\n16:21 Comment: just a bit behind Henderson.\n16:32 Comment: Well by Rojo.\n16:34 Comment: Carrick.\n16:36 Comment: Crude a header by Henderson,\n16:39 Comment: trying to keep possession for Liverpool,\n16:40 Comment: but it's not going to happen.\n16:41 Comment: It's not going to happen.\n16:41 Comment: Difficult for both sides at the moment.\n16:46 Comment: Carrick.\n16:53 Comment: Pogba under pressure.\n16:55 Comment: And Marcoli doesn't see a foul,\n16:57 Comment: and Liverpool stride on here,\n16:59 Comment: with Firmino.\n17:1 Comment: Another chance to\n17:3 Comment: fight into the middle, where Liverpool\n17:4 Comment: are well represented. Alexander-Arnold\n17:6 Comment: puts it on the scene, but\n17:7 Comment: it's carried it a little bit.\n17:11 Comment: Chance for the first one,\n17:12 Comment: if Firmino hits Rojo with a cross into the chest.\n17:15 Comment: It's a good chance.\n17:16 Comment: No foul on Pogba.\n17:18 Comment: He's dallying on the ball and gets caught,\n17:20 Comment: and Liverpool are away.\n17:21 Comment: It's Chandler-Lan and Origi in the middle.\n17:23 Comment: He has to try and pick one of them out.\n17:25 Comment: He'll get the back post, looks tempting.\n17:27 Comment: .\n17:38 Comment: Come round with mixed emotions there.\n17:40 Comment: This is John Alexander.\n17:43 Comment: The uncle of young Liverpool right back.\n17:46 Comment: He does come from Liverpool,\n17:49 Comment: worked at Tottenham before Manchester United,\n17:53 Comment: and there was a chance for Ibrahimovic.\n17:55 Comment: That can drop in, it's not.\n17:57 Comment: And Mignolet complaining about the back pass.\n18:0 Comment: That could have been very embarrassing for Liverpool defensively.\n18:4 Comment: It was short for Mignolet, I have to say that.\n18:8 Comment: But normally, when a goalkeeper and a striker go in,\n18:9 Comment: and a striker go into it you've got to take the lot it's a weak clearance from\n18:13 Comment: minile i'm not having that i have to say you've just got to take the lot there's\n18:16 Comment: latin and everything smashing just trying to get on the field\n18:20 Comment: it's a big risk we'll get away with one\n18:26 Comment: over the head of jones valencia has to turn\n18:29 Comment: galana was chasing him down\n18:33 Comment: considered kick and david de gea\n18:37 Comment: which wins it good cover by alexander arnold\n18:40 Comment: here's mcataran five four for manchester united here including the\n18:44 Comment: power of pogba but he scuffed it\n18:50 Comment: it's a good chance the first play from alexander arnold was\n18:53 Comment: good there but you watch him on this one he just drifts out towards marcial c and\n18:57 Comment: leaves that space for pogba to run through and it's on his\n19:0 Comment: left side and he makes a real mess of it he should score he drags it\n19:7 Comment: you should score he drags it\n19:7 Comment: snatches\n19:9 Comment: a big chance\n19:15 Comment: disappointment on his face\n19:18 Comment: the uh beaten the oven club manager to manager at once and that was quite a\n19:22 Comment: hollow victory for jose mourinho in that they\n19:25 Comment: went out of europe having lost the uh away leg\n19:29 Comment: greater margin than the one win this round against dortmund\n19:34 Comment: so\n19:40 Comment: strong and got the decision\n19:42 Comment: he's been flooding the answers in the\n19:44 Comment: competitions\n19:46 Comment: the oven club and that's the benefit you get at least a\n19:48 Comment: alexander armand has had other first team experience if not so much in the\n19:50 Comment: premier league\n19:52 Comment: nothing like this it's a big ask big\n19:54 Comment: risk a big opportunity for alexander\n19:56 Comment: armand and he's got a lot of experience\n19:58 Comment: he's got a lot of experience in the\n20:0 Comment: league\n20:2 Comment: and he's got a lot of experience in the premier league\n20:4 Comment: opportunity for him\n20:6 Comment: hogba put him behind henderson\n20:8 Comment: mcintyre ibrahimovic coming in\n20:13 Comment: he had it and he's built it for a moment\n20:15 Comment: but to no cost his position was good\n20:18 Comment: mini late\n20:19 Comment: constant near post he took a\n20:21 Comment: three or four stride starts but he cut\n20:23 Comment: it out\n20:32 Comment: loverin\n20:34 Comment: trying to\n20:36 Comment: give him a ball over the top\n20:55 Comment: marcial pogba\n21:0 Comment: just a bit tight that triangle for united let's hear again from james\n21:3 Comment: james redknapp james what have you got\n21:5 Comment: for us martin first 16 minutes i felt\n21:7 Comment: liverpool pretty comfortable and then\n21:8 Comment: they're just starting to find a bit of\n21:9 Comment: rhythm herrera in midfield i've been\n21:11 Comment: watching in the last six seven games\n21:13 Comment: there he is again he's the man that sets\n21:14 Comment: the tempo in there and he won that first\n21:16 Comment: ball that set up pogba and the mc\n21:17 Comment: atarian starting to get involved and i\n21:20 Comment: know gary you know what it's like in\n21:21 Comment: this stadium they can start to feel it\n21:23 Comment: and united are starting to find a little\n21:24 Comment: bit of rhythm now which is a bit of a\n21:26 Comment: worrying sign for liverpool\n21:28 Comment: i think so i think united can get it\n21:30 Comment: into wide areas\n21:31 Comment: a\n21:33 Comment: That's for Milner, and they un-boy it right back.\n21:41 Comment: Not exactly feeling the pressure of the fixture,\n21:43 Comment: but getting his radar wrong.\n21:49 Comment: Origi, a muscle in the arm,\n21:51 Comment: and Liverpool a free kick in a decent area.\n21:55 Comment: He's done well, Origi.\n21:57 Comment: I did feel before this game that for Liverpool to do well,\n21:59 Comment: they needed to start well and be good in the first half of the game,\n22:3 Comment: and get a goal in front.\n22:7 Comment: Opportunity here.\n22:11 Comment: Clavin, Origi, Lovren, Chan...\n22:14 Comment: Kamino all in the middle.\n22:20 Comment: All back for United, including Ibrahimovic's height.\n22:26 Comment: Between the two central defenders.\n22:30 Comment: Roma hoisted in.\n22:31 Comment: Lovren knocks it down.\n22:33 Comment: A bit of a swing by Origi, didn't really get hold of it.\n22:38 Comment: I bet it was a chance.\n22:41 Comment: I have to say, the first three set-pieces Liverpool have had,\n22:43 Comment: Lovren's got really the better of Pogba.\n22:45 Comment: Does him again there.\n22:47 Comment: Comes quickly to Origi.\n22:49 Comment: It is a chance.\n22:53 Comment: Lovren back.\n22:54 Comment: And...\n22:55 Comment: Cutting it out, Ibrahimovic was thinking it might drop over the central defender.\n23:3 Comment: But it's not.\n23:4 Comment: It's a good shot.\n23:6 Comment: Nicely put together by Liverpool.\n23:10 Comment: Milner.\n23:11 Comment: Challenge tight on Origi, though.\n23:16 Comment: Knew where the pass was going to go straight away.\n23:20 Comment: Pogba.\n23:21 Comment: Lovren applauding the pressure applied on Manchester United by his players.\n23:26 Comment: That's why Liverpool are the best in the league,\n23:28 Comment: when they're getting around people very quickly.\n23:30 Comment: And...\n23:31 Comment: Big numbers, 3-4-5, all sprinting towards the ball.\n23:38 Comment: Good work by Emre Can.\n23:41 Comment: And a small drop here for Alexander-Arnold.\n23:44 Comment: Suddenly found himself with a chance of a long name being up in lights.\n23:49 Comment: Sleeping Martial to start with, and then panicked.\n23:52 Comment: Got back with Alexander-Arnold.\n23:54 Comment: You see at the top of your picture there, watch where Martial is,\n23:57 Comment: sleeping, ball-watching.\n24:0 Comment: He just turns it back inside.\n24:1 Comment: He does his job eventually.\n24:3 Comment: United wide, man.\n24:7 Comment: It's not a one-way street on that far side.\n24:11 Comment: That's the best thing to probably do, run him the other way,\n24:15 Comment: cos he certainly doesn't like running back.\n24:17 Comment: I think he's been more willing to do it under Jose Mourinho in the last couple of months.\n24:21 Comment: It's certainly not his favourite part of his game.\n24:25 Comment: Wijnaldum.\n24:31 Comment: Let's feel for Jürgen Klopp in bringing Jordan Henderson back from injury.\n24:37 Comment: Rather reduced the chances of him starting.\n24:41 Comment: Felipe Coutinho as well, of course, has been out for even longer.\n24:44 Comment: He did come on as a substitute at Southampton.\n24:50 Comment: I think we all felt pretty confident that Coutinho would play for this game.\n24:54 Comment: It's a good point you make, having two of them come back.\n24:56 Comment: Liverpool just shading the possession.\n24:58 Comment: It's been in this area.\n25:8 Comment: 0-0, 25 minutes gone.\n25:14 Comment: Out on the far side.\n25:16 Comment: Jones, passed by Firmino, Manchester United are in trouble here.\n25:22 Comment: They're lucky that they only conceded a corner.\n25:24 Comment: That is the great strength of this Liverpool team.\n25:26 Comment: The pinch-catchers are in trouble.\n25:28 Comment: They've punched the ball off you.\n25:30 Comment: You think you're safe, but you're not.\n25:32 Comment: Firmino in, Lallana then backing up.\n25:34 Comment: Rojo, grateful.\n25:38 Comment: Best pass from Martial.\n25:41 Comment: Jones thought he had more time than he actually did.\n25:44 Comment: No time to think.\n25:46 Comment: Atul Jones.\n25:48 Comment: Corner for Liverpool.\n25:51 Comment: Trying to block again to get Lovren on it.\n25:53 Comment: And Klavan.\n25:55 Comment: Oh, he's on ball.\n25:56 Comment: By Pogba.\n25:58 Comment: And Lovren was pulling away.\n26:0 Comment: And Michael Oliver points to the spot.\n26:2 Comment: And Manchester United...\n26:4 Comment: Well, it's daft.\n26:6 Comment: Four set pieces.\n26:8 Comment: He had a nightmare on all four.\n26:10 Comment: And it's a penalty straight away, handball.\n26:12 Comment: Michael Oliver...\n26:14 Comment: I have to say, the stadium are never going to appeal.\n26:16 Comment: I'm not sure even too many Liverpool players appealed.\n26:18 Comment: But it was an obvious handball.\n26:20 Comment: And Pogba, he struggled against Lovren in this first 25 minutes.\n26:23 Comment: What a chance now for Liverpool.\n26:25 Comment: And it's a penalty.\n26:26 Comment: What a chance now for James Milner.\n26:28 Comment: Well, he's 100%.\n26:30 Comment: Five out of five this season.\n26:32 Comment: He's a very experienced professional.\n26:34 Comment: But this will test his nerve.\n26:36 Comment: But he passes the test.\n26:38 Comment: And Liverpool lead at Old Trafford.\n26:43 Comment: Pogba culpable.\n26:45 Comment: Milner perfect from the spot.\n26:48 Comment: Well, that's the goal I thought Liverpool would need.\n26:51 Comment: To do well in this game, it's the height that beats David Firmino.\n26:55 Comment: The power's good.\n26:57 Comment: But just a little bit too high for him.\n26:59 Comment: He goes the right way, the goalkeeper, but Milner...\n27:1 Comment: He hasn't missed this season, he's ecstatic.\n27:3 Comment: It's the biggest.\n27:5 Comment: But he's lost him on every single set-piece.\n27:7 Comment: He turns his back, he doesn't know where he is, Paul Pogba.\n27:10 Comment: And then he panics.\n27:12 Comment: One mistake followed by the second.\n27:15 Comment: And a bad one for Manchester United.\n27:22 Comment: It's amazing, this.\n27:24 Comment: Fixtra's had so many penalties.\n27:27 Comment: It's nine in less than eight years in matches between Manchester United and Liverpool in the Premier League.\n27:34 Comment: And there was one here in the Europa League last season as well.\n27:38 Comment: And there was one day when Liverpool got three at Old Trafford,\n27:42 Comment: awarded then by Mark Clattenburg.\n27:48 Comment: Absolutely delighted to take full advantage of Pogba's error of judgement.\n27:54 Comment: End of the F export spree.\n27:59 Comment: For S yourselves.\n28:4 Comment: For Chancellor Barcelona.\n28:8 Comment: For Arsenal.\n28:13 Comment: Here's comme un.\n28:21 Comment: Rot ticket?\n28:22 Comment: 에는 corporate lucarden nelord mask.\n28:23 Comment: but it all started with Phil Jones getting caught in possession by Firmino,\n28:27 Comment: and the corner led to the penalty.\n28:30 Comment: Brick by brick, they built a lead here in Liverpool.\n28:33 Comment: You think about Pogba's first 25 minutes on the set-piece,\n28:36 Comment: the pass out of play and the mischance at the other end,\n28:38 Comment: it's not been his greatest for United so far.\n28:41 Comment: He's got plenty of time to put it right.\n28:53 Comment: FANS SING\n29:7 Comment: And Herrera.\n29:11 Comment: Valencia waiting in space.\n29:16 Comment: It's over here to Manchester United, they're a bag of nerves at the moment.\n29:20 Comment: Yeah, Jose Mourinho trying to settle his team,\n29:23 Comment: but he's got a good hand.\n29:24 Comment: What a record, he's now scored against Manchester United for Newcastle.\n29:29 Comment: For Aston Villa, that was a penalty at Wembley in a League Cup final.\n29:32 Comment: For Manchester City here, and now for Liverpool here.\n29:42 Comment: Klavan.\n29:44 Comment: Up goes Milner.\n29:50 Comment: Firmino.\n29:51 Comment: Balogna, nothing to the right for him.\n29:53 Comment: FANS SING\n30:0 Comment: That's given away by Artana and Arnold.\n30:3 Comment: Herrera on the prowl for United.\n30:5 Comment: Lovren stops, Mourinho, and Mourba launches in.\n30:9 Comment: Martiala ref was very close, couldn't have been better placed.\n30:13 Comment: I think Mike Lovren will think about West Ham incident,\n30:15 Comment: Manchester United players around him reacting.\n30:19 Comment: He does lunge in, Lovren, I'd be surprised if he gets away without a booking.\n30:23 Comment: But Blackhold has done well, he's taken his time.\n30:30 Comment: He's leaving the booking.\n30:32 Comment: And Chelsea also sent off Simon Francis of Bournemouth.\n30:36 Comment: OK, it's Arsenal.\n30:38 Comment: Yellow today for Lovren.\n30:43 Comment: Thought it would be.\n30:45 Comment: But the Manchester United players' reaction was similar to the reaction\n30:47 Comment: at West Ham away, with Figuoli, where he did get the red card.\n30:53 Comment: THEY CHANT\n31:4 Comment: Can't make sure it doesn't reach Ibrahimovic.\n31:7 Comment: They didn't need to give that away, Emre Can.\n31:10 Comment: It's a poor header.\n31:14 Comment: It does look quite greasy, and it skimmed off it.\n31:16 Comment: Well, a right-wing corner somehow led to Liverpool taking the lead.\n31:21 Comment: Manchester United with a chance\n31:23 Comment: to reply in a similar situation.\n31:26 Comment: THEY CHANT\n31:29 Comment: It's on the edge.\n31:31 Comment: Not a penalty following a right-wing corner, as it was at the other end.\n31:34 Comment: Herrera asking for the penalty, I thought it was a push at the near post.\n31:38 Comment: I think it was on Lallana initially.\n31:40 Comment: Just watch the near post.\n31:42 Comment: Is it Rojo? Just there.\n31:44 Comment: In another part of the penalty area, Pogba was wrestling Henderson to the ground.\n31:50 Comment: Henderson's gone to the referee and saying...\n31:53 Comment: I love that, he's wrestling.\n31:55 Comment: He probably gets in the book.\n31:57 Comment: Pogba's head's gone at the moment, he knows he's having a difficult half an hour,\n32:1 Comment: but this is a big chance.\n32:3 Comment: If it gets past the wall with the power that Ibrahimovic will put on it,\n32:6 Comment: it'll be difficult for Mignolet.\n32:8 Comment: Pogba's been on free kicks from time to time for Manchester United,\n32:12 Comment: but you don't get them off Ibrahimovic in this kind of position.\n32:18 Comment: I always think these are nightmares for goalkeepers.\n32:20 Comment: Absolute nightmares. Central, so close to goal.\n32:23 Comment: They've got no time to react if it goes past the wall,\n32:25 Comment: you're just hoping that the wall does its job.\n32:27 Comment: Here he goes, and the goalkeeper does his job.\n32:30 Comment: He's gonna be in there.\n32:33 Comment: He's been absolutely brilliant, Mignolet,\n32:35 Comment: because that is so tough, to get down there so close to him,\n32:39 Comment: and parry it away and get it away.\n32:42 Comment: Another corner for United.\n32:44 Comment: 1-0 down.\n32:46 Comment: Led by Klavan, emphatically.\n32:49 Comment: He raves the others out in his defensive line-up field.\n32:53 Comment: He's got a good shot.\n32:58 Comment: They parted, didn't they, the Manchester United players,\n33:1 Comment: at the end of the wall,\n33:3 Comment: allowing the ball to speed through.\n33:5 Comment: Mignolet was covering really what was his side of the wall,\n33:8 Comment: and he picked the right side.\n33:10 Comment: If anything, the United players peeled away too quickly.\n33:13 Comment: They almost delayed it a little bit,\n33:15 Comment: so he was almost unsighted even more.\n33:23 Comment: Oh, what a save.\n33:24 Comment: He's got the ball in the right wing.\n33:29 Comment: Carrick.\n33:31 Comment: Oh, he won't get that.\n33:36 Comment: This is the free kick again.\n33:38 Comment: You mentioned it, Martin, the United players at the end of the wall.\n33:40 Comment: Carrick pulled the ball away too quickly, which gives him a side to it.\n33:44 Comment: He could have just delayed it a little bit more.\n33:47 Comment: Mignolet, I have to say, still a fantastic save.\n33:53 Comment: WHISTLE BLOWS\n34:2 Comment: Mkhitaryan.\n34:8 Comment: Firmino.\n34:10 Comment: Allowed to turn, Origi likewise.\n34:18 Comment: Some pieces.\n34:20 Comment: Probably Liverpool's most dangerous element in the game,\n34:22 Comment: so far.\n34:24 Comment: And Dejan Lovren has been a key player for Jurgen Klopp.\n34:29 Comment: They've got a chance to change at half-time,\n34:31 Comment: but he's so uncomfortable with Lovren, he's lost to him on every single one.\n34:35 Comment: There he is again.\n34:37 Comment: Not quite sure why Lovren's going in on the goalkeeper, he's letting him off.\n34:40 Comment: It's a different signal from Milner.\n34:42 Comment: Oh!\n34:43 Comment: In the in swing, it feels like Neymar put too much on it for Heyer,\n34:47 Comment: which is a spark of counter-attack.\n34:50 Comment: Nothing...\n34:52 Comment: Nearly on for the United goalkeeper straightaway.\n35:13 Comment: Pogba.\n35:14 Comment: And Maldon across.\n35:16 Comment: I have to say, the first 35 minutes we haven't seen anything of Mkhitaryan.\n35:20 Comment: Very little of him, very little.\n35:22 Comment: Edmarsie out.\n35:24 Comment: Firmino is regarded by Jurgen Klopp as his best defensive attacker,\n35:29 Comment: if you understand what I'm saying.\n35:31 Comment: He certainly showed that in the lead-up to the corner that led to the penalty,\n35:34 Comment: and just again now where he was penalised.\n35:36 Comment: Here's Valencia.\n35:38 Comment: And then Settling to the corner.\n35:42 Comment: They haven't done that enough, the Manchester United full-backs.\n35:45 Comment: They should be going forward at every opportunity.\n35:47 Comment: They haven't got a direct opponent.\n35:52 Comment: Mkhitaryan to take the corner.\n35:55 Comment: With a bag on the post.\n35:57 Comment: Ibrahimovic.\n35:59 Comment: Marked by Lovren, marked well by Dayan Lovren.\n36:18 Comment: Origi.\n36:19 Comment: Roberto Firmino.\n36:21 Comment: Jones driving on.\n36:27 Comment: Bit more than are coming together between Mkhitaryan and Milner.\n36:30 Comment: Free kick to United.\n36:31 Comment: He's just got his body in front.\n36:35 Comment: United need somebody to grab the game.\n36:37 Comment: He's drifting by for them at the moment.\n36:43 Comment: Valencia.\n36:51 Comment: Again, it doesn't work out for Paul Pogba.\n36:55 Comment: He's taken too many touches, he's been dispossessed now a couple of times.\n36:58 Comment: I think he's got to play the simple way to get back into the game, build his confidence back.\n37:3 Comment: Almost as if he's come into the game a little bit overexcited.\n37:6 Comment: Yeah, I think so.\n37:8 Comment: I have to say, the game, first 35 minutes for United, people revolved around him.\n37:11 Comment: The penalty, the set-pieces, he's got the ball away a couple of times, missed a huge chance.\n37:15 Comment: It's a big chance.\n37:17 Comment: He's certainly not at the moment thinking clearly.\n37:20 Comment: He has to settle down.\n37:23 Comment: United 15 games unbeaten in all competitions.\n37:28 Comment: They're in a situation where they've been playing catch-up.\n37:32 Comment: Dropping points.\n37:34 Comment: The first couple of months.\n37:38 Comment: They need to keep winning.\n37:39 Comment: They really need to keep the teams above them within range.\n37:42 Comment: They're trailing here to a very lively Liverpool.\n37:47 Comment: VAR TURNS\n37:49 Comment: scalar\n37:53 Comment: Die reise\n37:57 Comment: The move started by United goalkeeper.\n38:3 Comment: And collaboratively indicated it wasn't a foul.\n38:5 Comment: And the family officials agreeing with him,\n38:10 Comment: looking to repeatedly try to shift back, or had tylko just done that.\n38:12 Comment: They find 150 less on the form to avoid over-suggesting.\n38:14 Comment: Still Argiri.\n38:15 Comment: Firmino up with him.\n38:17 Comment: Comes out towards Chan.\n38:20 Comment: Now Lallana, United still in trouble here.\n38:23 Comment: Lallana trying to place it.\n38:25 Comment: He's got Milner with him, and Jones can't get it out.\n38:28 Comment: Only last for handball against Milner.\n38:31 Comment: There's Mkhitaryan, Milner bites back.\n38:37 Comment: Here comes Klavan.\n38:39 Comment: You're nervous.\n38:41 Comment: You've got to hold out.\n38:47 Comment: He's zipped forward by Klavan to Milner.\n39:0 Comment: Let's hear again from Jamie Renkamp.\n39:3 Comment: Martin, I just want to highlight Paul Pogba.\n39:6 Comment: Gary's mentioned it, it's like he's never marked a man\n39:8 Comment: from a corner in his life.\n39:9 Comment: He's not even looking at the ball, he's done this once, twice,\n39:13 Comment: and then the third time has been instrumental in what's been happening.\n39:16 Comment: You can see him at the back post,\n39:17 Comment: he's really struggled.\n39:19 Comment: I actually can't believe that Jose Munoz, one of the senior players,\n39:22 Comment: has not said, let's get someone else to mark Dejan Lovren.\n39:25 Comment: Have a bit of experience, maybe ask Rojo or Jones,\n39:28 Comment: because he can't deal with him at the moment,\n39:29 Comment: and it's a major problem for Manchester United.\n39:31 Comment: Absolutely.\n39:34 Comment: The names are up on the board, who you're marking,\n39:36 Comment: sometimes if it's not working, you just think...\n39:40 Comment: Dubinovic, Jones, Rojo, could they change?\n39:42 Comment: It's a good point, I'm sure something will happen at half-time.\n39:47 Comment: THEY CHANT\n39:49 Comment: Well, to be honest, you don't have to wait till half-time.\n39:53 Comment: There are players out there who could sort that out for themselves.\n39:56 Comment: It's just sometimes you're down on the touchline,\n39:59 Comment: you've not quite seen what's happened on the first two,\n40:1 Comment: we've got this cold view from up here,\n40:3 Comment: and the manager, because nothing's come of it,\n40:5 Comment: you might think, well, OK, there's nothing happened,\n40:8 Comment: but the danger was there.\n40:9 Comment: Here's danger for Liverpool, Mkhitaryan's in the clear,\n40:13 Comment: and Mignolet stands firm, and Liverpool keep their lead.\n40:17 Comment: What is Klavan doing?\n40:22 Comment: I think he tries to step up.\n40:24 Comment: But it's a big chance for him.\n40:27 Comment: Hogbrad on his left foot, now the Katarians have won.\n40:34 Comment: Henrik Mkhitaryan there.\n40:36 Comment: Quite a well-known, of course, to Jurgen Klopp,\n40:38 Comment: the Liverpool manager, signed into Dortmund.\n40:45 Comment: They've made it to the match hall twice,\n40:47 Comment: and they've been cut through Liverpool in those runs inside,\n40:50 Comment: out to win, inside the full-backs.\n40:56 Comment: Elegantic Roberto Firmino.\n40:58 Comment: There's been a lot of talk about the Liverpool goalkeepers this season,\n41:1 Comment: but Simon Mignolet is distinguishing himself here.\n41:5 Comment: I thought that was a more comfortable one for him,\n41:8 Comment: but Klavan there, I mean, is he just offside?\n41:10 Comment: Maybe Lovren was playing him on, but...\n41:12 Comment: It's a big chance.\n41:14 Comment: It's a good one, actually, with his left hand,\n41:16 Comment: but it's a good height for him, it's close to him, it's in his arc,\n41:19 Comment: I think if it had been low, he'd have been in trouble.\n41:25 Comment: Origi.\n41:30 Comment: Valencia.\n41:43 Comment: He stands on his ankle.\n41:46 Comment: That's him and Valencia.\n41:48 Comment: You saw those.\n41:52 Comment: Origi just getting up now.\n41:55 Comment: Hobbling away.\n42:0 Comment: That's Origi's first start for Liverpool against Manchester United,\n42:3 Comment: and he's proving to be a handful for Mourinho's back line.\n42:8 Comment: That's what he is, he's a handful.\n42:10 Comment: He hasn't got the quality of Sturridge, but he runs, he challenges, he harasses,\n42:14 Comment: and that's exactly what he's doing, he's unsettled,\n42:16 Comment: he's a handful, Rojo and Jones.\n42:18 Comment: Milner takes, and Lovren has got free again.\n42:22 Comment: Firmino trying to get in and force it over the line, it wasn't going to drop for him.\n42:27 Comment: Jose Mourinho will not be able to believe what he's seen on these set-pieces,\n42:30 Comment: when he looks at them all back, you see around the back,\n42:34 Comment: it's Pogba again who loses him, that's five.\n42:36 Comment: Talk about warning signs.\n42:39 Comment: What's going to happen here?\n42:42 Comment: Another set-piece for Liverpool.\n42:46 Comment: That's a free kick.\n42:48 Comment: It's a free kick.\n42:52 Comment: It's around the back, a single for Lovren again.\n42:55 Comment: He's lost him again.\n42:56 Comment: CHEERING\n42:58 Comment: They've gone out of jail this time because Michael Oliver's brought in the push.\n43:3 Comment: He's struggling, he's got to be in these set-pieces.\n43:11 Comment: Making a plug-zero of it at the moment.\n43:16 Comment: Come on.\n43:22 Comment: There's still a bit to be done before these two...\n43:25 Comment: Aaah.\n43:27 Comment: ..be hit.\n43:29 Comment: The final on the VFL Cup final.\n43:31 Comment: It'll be football one-down to Southampton for the first leg.\n43:33 Comment: That's the week on Wednesday on Sky Sports one,\n43:36 Comment: and the following night,\n43:39 Comment: none United have a 2-0 lead to take the Hull,\n43:41 Comment: but Hull are showing signs in the Marco Silva of...\n43:44 Comment: perhaps be a bit more about them.\n43:46 Comment: and dusted either and Jose Mourinho would be the first to admit that.\n43:58 Comment: Made by Rojo.\n44:2 Comment: Lovren.\n44:6 Comment: He left early in the...\n44:11 Comment: last game here, it's often his work.\n44:13 Comment: He's got some planning to do.\n44:17 Comment: Marcel Mkhitaryan.\n44:18 Comment: No chance of Mkhitaryan, but he hasn't really been involved in the game,\n44:21 Comment: neither has Ibrahimovic.\n44:25 Comment: The front six of United haven't been great at all.\n44:33 Comment: Michael Carrick in midfield has been fantastic recently,\n44:35 Comment: he's looked a little bit out of sorts.\n44:37 Comment: One very eager option for the Frenchman.\n44:43 Comment: Manchester United, of course, is Wayne Rennick.\n44:47 Comment: He grew up on the blue side of Merseyside,\n44:52 Comment: and would love to get his record-breaking goal\n44:55 Comment: against this particular opponent from Manchester United today.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: after the end of half time, whether it was Jose Mourinho or just put Wayne Rooney out there\n0:3 Comment: on the edge of that record, I think Michael Carrick was out of sorts in the first half\n0:9 Comment: I don't know if it was an injury, he certainly wasn't himself\n0:11 Comment: Wayne Rooney's come on in the number 10 position, Pogba and Herrera will flatten up in midfield and play as a two\n0:20 Comment: Pogba\n0:24 Comment: given no time\n0:30 Comment: well so far it's been Merseyside's day but it could change by a Liverpool lad\n0:45 Comment: he's never been afraid, Jose Mourinho, to make early changes in games\n0:50 Comment: he's done it again\n0:54 Comment: here's Milder, scoring the only goal so far\n1:0 Comment: by Mkhitaryan, the assistant, lagging on the far side\n1:10 Comment: he just follows through a little bit, and he does, just do it Mkhitaryan\n1:21 Comment: Carvin to take the free kick\n1:24 Comment: Jones to meet it from Manchester United and Ibrahimovic running off him\n1:30 Comment: he has感 induced a disturb, dangerous feeling\n1:32 Comment: for Hull, but yeah,

centre-backs.\n2:10 Comment: He's certainly done that, Origi.\n2:15 Comment: As I've seen him in the last couple of months,\n2:18 Comment: Rojo and Jones.\n2:30 Comment: Valencia.\n2:32 Comment:

a corner.\n3:6 Comment: The angle we were at,\n3:7 Comment: you couldn't tell when it was going to go,\n3:8 Comment: and Nessel in that top corner,\n3:9 Comment: got a deflection off Bill Jones.\n3:11 Comment: It's a good break from Liverpool.\n3:14 Comment: Off Manchester United quickly.\n3:17 Comment: And who's going to pick up Lovren?\n3:26 Comment: I don't think it's going to be Paul Pogba.\n3:30 Comment: Or is it Wayne Rooney?\n3:31 Comment: Or is it none of them?\n3:32 Comment: At the moment he's free.\n3:43 Comment: Liverpool setting up so that\n3:45 Comment: Klavan is the

three or four yards off Lovren,\n4:8 Comment: as if to say,\n4:9 Comment: I'm going to have a run at you with it.\n4:10 Comment: I have to say,\n4:11 Comment: not a conventional way to mark on corners.\n4:13 Comment: You usually say be body to body.\n4:15 Comment: You see where Pogba is waiting for him to come out.\n4:17 Comment: That's obviously something to discuss.\n4:19 Comment: I have to say, it's a strange tactic.\n4:23 Comment: You always say be body to body,\n4:25 Comment: be man against man,\n4:26 Comment: don't let him run.\n4:27 Comment: Only trying to get a corner out of this.\n4:29 Comment: Which he...\n4:30 Comment: He's done.\n4:40 Comment: And he'll take it himself.\n4:51 Comment: And a hit.\n4:53 Comment: Lovren dealt with it at the near post.\n4:55 Comment:

been\n6:52 Comment: I think when Rooney heads that back\n6:53 Comment: towards Ibrahimovic\n6:54 Comment: he may just make the bend\n6:55 Comment: he's running behind\n6:56 Comment: Martial might get

Comment: he had to play it across slower, he fires it across,\n9:12 Comment: he needs to roll it past...\n9:14 Comment: Mignolet, he gets caught, the young boy at right-back.\n9:19 Comment: And the counter-attacks there, it's a good first touch by Ibrahimovic,\n9:22 Comment: Milner's caught forward,\n9:24 Comment: and he doesn't need to put too much weight in it, roll it across.\n9:31 Comment: And a drive from Damian that's led to this corner.\n9:37 Comment: I have to say, they have big chances, United, big chances.\n9:42 Comment: The Manchester Reds trying to rouse themselves here.\n9:47 Comment: Jordan Henderson, I think, speaking up for Alexander-Arnold,\n9:51 Comment: he might have been fouled,\n9:52 Comment: but he didn't look like a foul from our angle.\n9:55 Comment: Rojo going to the near post,\n9:57 Comment: there comes Mignolet, that's the punch.\n10:0 Comment: That's a catch.\n10:9 Comment: Jones mindful of being caught.\n10:13 Comment: Firmino in the first half, not a good kick by De Gea this time.\n10:17 Comment: Alana cleverly traversing that to Chan.\n10:22 Comment: And Mignolet, thinking that Origi might get that.\n10:29 Comment: Valencia, some of his control distribution, De Gea,\n10:33 Comment: did fantastic, so composed so far.\n10:38 Comment: Again.\n10:41 Comment: And from Damian, met by Lovren.\n10:45 Comment: And here's Henderson.\n10:52 Comment: You can take a page out of the story of this fixture\n10:55 Comment: in the history books down the years,\n10:57 Comment: and what you're seeing now will fit into each story.\n11:3 Comment: It's a real scrap at the moment,\n11:6 Comment: with Mourinho's men trying to repair the damage.\n11:10 Comment: Feels like it's getting more important this game,\n11:13 Comment: the tension's building.\n11:20 Comment: Pogba.\n11:22 Comment: The sense of slightly more self-control in the second half.\n11:36 Comment: And Herrera.\n11:40 Comment: Unable to intervene.\n11:41 Comment: Really unable to keep it.\n11:42 Comment: And Herrera's working really hard, he's really on the run.\n11:49 Comment: Cup fight.\n11:50 Comment: He might have an angle on it, but he's not able to keep it.\n11:52 Comment: He's able to deal with it.\n11:53 Comment: There's just some danger late sometimes, Clive,\n11:55 Comment: and if the run's going behind him,\n11:57 Comment: he can act again there to Wayne Roonis.\n12:11 Comment: Interesting how the players there, Gary,\n12:12 Comment: were feeling that Mignolet had hung on to the ball.\n12:14 Comment: There was an incident, I think in a European game at Anfield,\n12:17 Comment: where he was penalised for that, and it cost a goal.\n12:19 Comment: And infringing that, never used.\n12:22 Comment: Too slow.\n12:23 Comment: But rarely too slow.\n12:26 Comment: Can't blame him.\n12:29 Comment: Wasting a little bit of time and just slowing the game down a little bit.\n12:37 Comment: Dianne with the throw.\n12:42 Comment: Roja.\n12:47 Comment: He used the full-width of the pitch again,\n12:48 Comment: and now it's up to Herrera, unable to pick out Valencia.\n12:52 Comment: That's the only way to win it back.\n12:54 Comment: This is what Liverpool have got to contend with now.\n12:59 Comment: An authentic Old Trafford atmosphere,\n13:1 Comment: and Manchester United trying to look like the authentic club\n13:6 Comment: that won these 13 Premier League titles.\n13:9 Comment: It hasn't been easy in recent seasons to stamp that image on their performances.\n13:15 Comment: Here's Martial.\n13:19 Comment: A few Liverpool players to deal with the threat.\n13:21 Comment: He wasn't comfortable. He's not going to give up. He's going to keep going.\n13:22 Comment: He's left-foot Martial.\n13:24 Comment: Mane ran into trouble.\n13:26 Comment: Rooney.\n13:27 Comment: And Herrera also preferring to use the right.\n13:29 Comment: Slammed away by Klavan.\n13:33 Comment: Liverpool at the moment struggling to find a way out.\n13:35 Comment: They're getting stronger.\n13:37 Comment: I think Liverpool need to move into counter-attack mode.\n13:41 Comment: Mkhitaryan.\n13:44 Comment: No-fire.\n13:45 Comment: So it's left to Oliver.\n13:47 Comment: And this has been the one way they've looked to try and work the ball up the field out to him.\n13:52 Comment: Origi.\n13:53 Comment: That's a United's throw.\n13:54 Comment: Last couple of minutes Liverpool have sugar to get out.\n13:59 Comment: Liverpool getting pressed back.\n14:2 Comment: And Carroll sensing that.\n14:8 Comment: And this is all from under Herrera to Valencia.\n14:12 Comment: Still going.\n14:14 Comment: It's over Rooney.\n14:16 Comment: Firmino knows him doing that.\n14:19 Comment: It's not really going to deal with the danger itself.\n14:21 Comment: Danger except for a few seconds.\n14:26 Comment: Rojo.\n14:31 Comment: Pogba comes back to him.\n14:33 Comment: And one of his better days that maybe flies into the top corner.\n14:38 Comment: It's wild in the end.\n14:40 Comment: Obviously Juan Mata.\n14:42 Comment: The considered approach of Juan Mata.\n14:46 Comment: And considered by Jose Mourinho.\n14:48 Comment: But Liverpool have something similar.\n14:50 Comment: In their own locker.\n14:51 Comment: And Philippa Coutinho.\n14:52 Comment: I'm surprised.\n14:53 Comment: It's Origi who comes off the hour mark.\n15:0 Comment: I'm surprised.\n15:1 Comment: I really am.\n15:2 Comment: This is injured.\n15:3 Comment: Because if Coutinho isn't a runner, he'll need the counter-attack, you would think,\n15:7 Comment: the way the game's gone in these last few minutes.\n15:9 Comment: They also need somebody to keep the ball.\n15:11 Comment: Which he might be able to do.\n15:13 Comment: Yeah, they do.\n15:14 Comment: But I think Firmino's going to go up top.\n15:17 Comment: Lallana to the right.\n15:18 Comment: They've gone back to a conventional 4-3-3 now, Liverpool.\n15:22 Comment: Coutinho on that left-hand side.\n15:32 Comment: Straight away, Coutinho involved.\n15:37 Comment: And they're in here for a second.\n15:39 Comment: And Firmino's effort kept out by De Gea, keeping Manchester United in it.\n15:45 Comment: There's a chance.\n15:46 Comment: Liverpool to take the game away from United.\n15:56 Comment: Look at Ronaldo.\n16:1 Comment: Immediate impact from Coutinho, his quality's unquestionable.\n16:4 Comment: Inverse pass was fantastic.\n16:9 Comment: And this was the save from De Gea.\n16:13 Comment: And Bojanovic's making it awkward for Lovren then.\n16:16 Comment: And here's Rooney.\n16:19 Comment: Chan.\n16:21 Comment: And Aldon did very well there.\n16:24 Comment: The easiest ball to deal with.\n16:25 Comment: It's Firmino.\n16:27 Comment: Passing with Rojo.\n16:29 Comment: Henderson covered a lot of ground there.\n16:30 Comment: He thought he could just nick it away and keep Liverpool going forward.\n16:34 Comment: As it is, a bit of space where he's vacated.\n16:38 Comment: Liverpool have to fill the levels.\n16:41 Comment: And here comes Valencia.\n16:44 Comment: Rooney.\n16:46 Comment: And here is Henderson back on his feet.\n16:52 Comment: Molana.\n16:54 Comment: Firmino.\n16:56 Comment: Pass.\n16:57 Comment: And one of the two on there.\n16:58 Comment: There was one for Wijnaldum and this one for Coutinho.\n17:4 Comment: Reflection on the shot, De Gea desperate to prevent the corner, which he'll do.\n17:8 Comment: But it certainly lifted Liverpool, the arrival of Coutinho.\n17:11 Comment: Last couple of minutes, they've done a lot better.\n17:13 Comment: Just trying to suckle a little bit.\n17:15 Comment: The five minutes before that.\n17:28 Comment: Mata still waiting to get on.\n17:37 Comment: And Jones.\n17:45 Comment: Seven bits left now.\n17:46 Comment: And, well, as he did in virginia, between one overtime butaco and Mundol Kop n myself,\n17:53 Comment: 90 out of 100!\n17:57 Comment: �\n17:59 Comment: walder said Miami the next afternoon.\n18:3 Comment: That's\n18:10 Comment: it!\n18:10 Comment: Cut a path, a pretty flat penalty area.\n18:14 Comment: Hit by Damien again, now Pogba.\n18:17 Comment: There's personally some damage to repay.\n18:23 Comment: Good work by Mkhitaryan to win it back.\n18:25 Comment: Deep enough that Ibrahimović had just drifted away at that back post.\n18:31 Comment: Only trying to get there, might get there.\n18:34 Comment: Neared by Lovren.\n18:40 Comment: APPLAUSE\n18:51 Comment: De Gea this time.\n18:53 Comment: Not judged defensively by Lovren.\n18:58 Comment: Mkhitaryan.\n18:59 Comment: Rooney.\n19:1 Comment: Could it be?\n19:2 Comment: We're gonna think that every time he has a shot.\n19:5 Comment: It wasn't one of his best efforts down the years.\n19:7 Comment: It wasn't, we've seen it many times over the years,\n19:9 Comment: where he shifts it a yard to get it.\n19:10 Comment: He gets a touch of Mkhitaryan,\n19:12 Comment: try and dink it into the... the ship,\n19:14 Comment: the mess of it.\n19:15 Comment: One matter.\n19:18 Comment: Martialov.\n19:21 Comment: Not been his game this time around.\n19:25 Comment: One matter.\n19:26 Comment: Scored three for Manchester United against Liverpool then.\n19:30 Comment: His time here.\n19:31 Comment: That's the reverse pass from Coutinho to Firmino,\n19:34 Comment: and the save from De Gea.\n19:37 Comment: Firmino just doesn't set it out wide enough.\n19:40 Comment: Mkhitaryan re-type finish.\n19:46 Comment: Firmino again showing the defensive side of his forward play.\n19:50 Comment: Mata's gone to the right, as you can see.\n19:52 Comment: Mkhitaryan switched over to the left-hand side.\n19:59 Comment: That's how the round was pulled out here.\n20:2 Comment: Give me the ball if you want.\n20:3 Comment: That was infield, so...\n20:6 Comment: I'll see more experience, Coutinho.\n20:8 Comment: Jammed.\n20:10 Comment: Firmino.\n20:11 Comment: And that was slow to get to him.\n20:13 Comment: And he encouraged the shot.\n20:14 Comment: Henderson.\n20:16 Comment: Coutinho.\n20:18 Comment: Little moments in this match, you feel.\n20:23 Comment: Turned by Alexander-Arnold, well.\n20:27 Comment: Trying to ease Henderson underneath it.\n20:29 Comment: Two England captains of this season.\n20:36 Comment: Wijnaldum.\n20:40 Comment: And that's what Liverpool need to do, is keep the ball in the United half.\n20:45 Comment: As much as possible.\n20:46 Comment: Lallana.\n20:48 Comment: A real ally now, Coutinho.\n20:50 Comment: Played together in the Premier League since November.\n20:53 Comment: Coutinho again.\n20:55 Comment: Oh, it's Lallana!\n20:57 Comment: Just had to swing and hit it and hope.\n21:0 Comment: Yeah, difficult one for Lallana.\n21:6 Comment: Andrew.\n21:7 Comment: Having the more shots.\n21:10 Comment: De Gea's goal.\n21:12 Comment: THEY CHANT\n21:17 Comment: Jovo Himmeloic, Rooney...\n21:20 Comment: He's the third man in that move.\n21:23 Comment: Good defender, really good covering position.\n21:27 Comment: THEY CHANT\n21:30 Comment: Haven't heard too much from Jamie Redknapp recently.\n21:32 Comment: Jamie, sorry about that, it's been too frantic.\n21:35 Comment: I just want to talk about the Coutinho influence, because before he brought him on,\n21:39 Comment: I counted five times.\n21:39 Comment: Five, six, seven times Liverpool lost their ball in their own half.\n21:42 Comment: Since he's come on to the pitch, it's almost been like,\n21:45 Comment: it's all right, guys, calm down, give the ball to me, we're gonna be OK.\n21:48 Comment: He has been such a great influence, he obviously did straight away with that one reverse ball,\n21:52 Comment: and every time he's got it, he's looked to be decisive.\n21:55 Comment: Gonna be an interesting 24 minutes or so here, you know,\n21:58 Comment: he's lots of play for still, and United are still dangerous, make no mistake, Martin.\n22:3 Comment: Particularly the hunger that the captain has been brought on to.\n22:7 Comment: Yeah.\n22:8 Comment: He's been brought on from the sidelines.\n22:10 Comment: THEY CHANT\n22:12 Comment: But really, where we are now, Gary, sums up what this fixture's about down the years,\n22:17 Comment: the rivalry, the enmity, if you like, hostility, desire for victory.\n22:22 Comment: THEY CHANT\n22:24 Comment: That was a big, big 24 minutes as well.\n22:27 Comment: THEY CHANT\n22:29 Comment: Pogba.\n22:31 Comment: THEY CHANT\n22:32 Comment: And then De Groot.\n22:34 Comment: THEY CHANT\n22:35 Comment: And then Coutinho.\n22:36 Comment: THEY CHANT\n22:37 Comment: They stick forward by Mane, that's what's on for him, really.\n22:42 Comment: He heads his head up, goes straight to Henderson, his pass goes to Valencia.\n22:47 Comment: Both sides guilty of giving the ball away.\n22:49 Comment: THEY CHANT\n22:57 Comment: Mkhitaryan.\n22:58 Comment: THEY CHANT\n23:0 Comment: From Herrera to Valencia.\n23:2 Comment: THEY CHANT\n23:5 Comment: Jones, look to see whether the big diagonal was on, but it didn't suit him.\n23:20 Comment: Moutinho just got back, that's the only drop from Mata.\n23:31 Comment: In by Mata.\n23:35 Comment: Too close to Mignolet.\n23:39 Comment: He's defining his doubters and keeping Jose Mourinho's team.\n23:42 Comment: They haven't scored a number against Liverpool.\n23:46 Comment: Away and now almost 70 minutes at home.\n23:55 Comment: Rooney.\n23:57 Comment: Wrestling with Wijnaldum.\n24:2 Comment: Rooney.\n24:5 Comment: That's a free kick.\n24:9 Comment: It's gone Liverpool as well.\n24:11 Comment: They did it one way, then the other.\n24:13 Comment: A strange one.\n24:15 Comment: It was a 50-50 where he's hurt Milner.\n24:21 Comment: That was a poor challenge from Wayne Rooney.\n24:24 Comment: A very poor challenge.\n24:27 Comment: Oliver.\n24:29 Comment: And went up, actually, for Manchester United.\n24:31 Comment: Free kick initially.\n24:33 Comment: He's lucky to get away without a card there, Wayne Rooney.\n24:35 Comment: And behind Salah...\n24:37 Comment: He's better...\n24:39 Comment: Top-uan Spurs look not bought for Val Promised Gabela.\n24:41 Comment: They will have to play a little bit longer.\n24:43 Comment: Stunned by the\n24:48 Comment: onlar hops to the right.\n24:49 Comment: This is the kind ofули...\n24:52 Comment: the Regnerdens\n24:54 Comment: both Spicy in愀 spare us now.\n24:56 Comment: After.\n24:57 Comment: He needs a chance to bourn one,\n24:59 Comment: but to be fair nothingэ æs terrible.\n25:1 Comment: deux forces a year abroad.\n25:3 Comment: APPLAUSE\n25:9 Comment: The types stay down, James Milner, but he's hurt.\n25:19 Comment: Still pretty relaxed in a situation where they'll be counting away\n25:22 Comment: the seconds from Liverpool's point of view,\n25:24 Comment: as ever, in tandem, as they were on the pitch.\n25:28 Comment: So many great years for Liverpool.\n25:30 Comment: FANS ROAR\n25:32 Comment: Wayne Child was goal-suit.\n25:34 Comment: THEY LAUGH\n25:42 Comment: Kenny Dalvlish, of course, the last manager to win the league with Liverpool.\n25:53 Comment: Just checking whether there's been any retribution for Wayne Rooney.\n26:0 Comment: THEY CHANT\n26:11 Comment: We'll just throw forward briefly to next Sunday.\n26:15 Comment: We start with Southampton against Leicester.\n26:18 Comment: We follow that up with Arsenal against Birmingham.\n26:22 Comment: And we follow that up with Chelsea against Hull.\n26:30 Comment: And then we have a great hiatus from the gripping action here.\n26:37 Comment: We're...\n26:40 Comment: ..losing.\n26:42 Comment: Particularly from Manchester United's point of view,\n26:44 Comment: a loser today, should they lose,\n26:46 Comment: having worked so hard to get themselves back into an outsider's role in contention,\n26:52 Comment: but still mentioned in dispatches.\n26:56 Comment: THEY CHANT\n26:58 Comment: It would be massive for Liverpool if they can see it through here.\n27:4 Comment: It'll be a huge win.\n27:6 Comment: What a mini-stumble they've had in the last week or two.\n27:9 Comment: THEY CHANT\n27:11 Comment: They haven't won a game yet in 2017.\n27:13 Comment: THEY CHANT\n27:15 Comment: Yes, in front of Sunderland, they gave away two penalties.\n27:18 Comment: THEY CHANT\n27:20 Comment: 2-2, Plymouth game, a youthful team.\n27:25 Comment: THEY CHANT\n27:26 Comment: And, of course, losing it.\n27:27 Comment: Losing it, Southampton won the first leg.\n27:29 Comment: Another terminal defeat, it could have been.\n27:31 Comment: THEY CHANT\n27:33 Comment: They weren't so good for today, but...\n27:36 Comment: ..Jürgen Klopp has been able to get his team to do,\n27:40 Comment: in these big away games in the Premier League since he took over...\n27:43 Comment: THEY CHANT\n27:45 Comment: ..an alarm.\n27:47 Comment: THEY CHANT\n27:49 Comment: It's a different type of performance today\n27:52 Comment: than in the old games that you talk about,\n27:54 Comment: some of them were electrifying,\n27:56 Comment: some of them were quiet in that today.\n27:58 Comment: But they've been effective.\n28:0 Comment: THEY CHANT\n28:2 Comment: Lovren.\n28:4 Comment: And indeed the goalkeeper has delivered.\n28:6 Comment: THEY CHANT\n28:8 Comment: And that's it.\n28:10 Comment: They're almost there to be won, and they've all won it.\n28:13 Comment: Coutinho.\n28:15 Comment: THEY CHANT\n28:17 Comment: Well done!\n28:18 Comment: Beautifully done.\n28:20 Comment: Oh, it's on Stunner.\n28:21 Comment: So beautifully done, that.\n28:23 Comment: THEY CHANT\n28:24 Comment: Because of the rebuilding at Anfield,\n28:26 Comment: Liverpool's season is slightly skewed.\n28:28 Comment: It might work to their advantage after today,\n28:31 Comment: only seven more away games,\n28:32 Comment: and ten to come at home when they are unbeaten.\n28:34 Comment: A man who knows Merseyside well,\n28:37 Comment: Marouane Fellaini.\n28:38 Comment: THEY CHANT\n28:40 Comment: And a lot of the gestures of faith from Jose Mourinho recently.\n28:45 Comment: THEY CHANT\n28:47 Comment: Could he...\n28:49 Comment: ..come on and spoil Liverpool's day,\n28:52 Comment: spoil Merseyside's day?\n28:53 Comment: After a terrific victory for Everton over Manchester City.\n28:59 Comment: THEY CHANT\n29:0 Comment: And you can see he comes off.\n29:1 Comment: Liverpool win the Qatar, he don't think...\n29:3 Comment: ..ruining to the left.\n29:5 Comment: Don't think Fellaini.\n29:6 Comment: Moving more towards central striker with Ibrahimovic.\n29:10 Comment: Could he go a bit more direct, crosses into the box,\n29:13 Comment: pressurise that Liverpool defence that way?\n29:15 Comment: THEY CHANT\n29:17 Comment: Ghanian.\n29:19 Comment: THEY CHANT\n29:22 Comment: Pogba.\n29:24 Comment: THEY CHANT\n29:27 Comment: Pogba knows to get the honour and chant.\n29:29 Comment: Firmino, Chan involved again.\n29:32 Comment: Forward for Liverpool.\n29:34 Comment: THEY CHANT\n29:35 Comment: And that would have been a glorious goal by Wijnaldum.\n29:39 Comment: Coming in behind Phil Jones, who just limped a little bit away from that.\n29:43 Comment: It would have summed up Paul Pogba's day, that would.\n29:46 Comment: THEY CHANT\n29:48 Comment: Too long on the ball, not sure what he's doing.\n29:50 Comment: THEY CHANT\n29:51 Comment: Liverpool break quickly, as always, with numbers, speed,\n29:54 Comment: it's a really good chance for Wijnaldum.\n29:56 Comment: THEY CHANT\n29:57 Comment: They're moving the clock.\n29:59 Comment: THEY CHANT\n30:0 Comment: Bring it down on your chest.\n30:2 Comment: THEY CHANT\n30:3 Comment: So it's Damian who's gone off.\n30:6 Comment: THEY CHANT\n30:7 Comment: Well, Fellaini's gone to where we thought he would,\n30:10 Comment: from Mkhitaryan to left-back and\n30:12 Comment: William Rooney to the left-hand side of midfield for United.\n30:15 Comment: THEY CHANT\n30:16 Comment: And Mkhitaryan trying all he knows.\n30:19 Comment: THEY CHANT\n30:20 Comment: He's come up with a formula to at least get a point.\n30:23 Comment: Even that would be...\n30:25 Comment: THEY CHANT\n30:26 Comment: He wants crosses.\n30:27 Comment: ..pointing.\n30:28 Comment: They say crosses, whip it in,\n30:30 Comment: right foot and put it into the box.\n30:32 Comment: THEY CHANT\n30:36 Comment: They're taking the high road, aren't they, Manchester United,\n30:38 Comment: with Fellaini and Ibrahimović.\n30:40 Comment: THEY CHANT\n30:45 Comment: They're not able to build anything up at this moment in time, Manchester United.\n30:48 Comment: I think that Milner injury just take the stinking out of him.\n30:52 Comment: It's not really got going since.\n30:54 Comment: It's quiet in the stadium.\n30:56 Comment: THEY CHANT\n30:57 Comment: They're looking pretty comfortable in this period.\n31:1 Comment: Inter fans frustrated.\n31:3 Comment: THEY CHANT\n31:13 Comment: They're coming together with Rojo.\n31:16 Comment: THEY CHANT\n31:20 Comment: MANHATTAN\n31:25 Comment: dingen\n31:26 Comment: MANHATTAN\n31:27 Comment: THEY CHANT\n31:37 Comment: IMAE\n31:39 Comment: TAM Minds\n31:47 Comment: the real dangerous crosses in, causing Liverpool problems.\n31:52 Comment: Jamie Redknapp, I know, with Liverpool in your heart, how are you feeling?\n31:57 Comment: You're not meant to give my secrets away, but I've just started to...\n32:0 Comment: Obviously, the way that United are going to shape up now,\n32:2 Comment: they're going to look to get the ball into the box.\n32:4 Comment: You've brought on Fellaini, and this feels like they're going to be extremely direct.\n32:7 Comment: I just hope we don't regret that Origi, that he's come off the pitch,\n32:11 Comment: maybe from a set piece, because he does give us a bit of presence in there.\n32:14 Comment: And they're going to try and bombard Liverpool,\n32:16 Comment: they're going to try and make it difficult and get Fellaini on the ball.\n32:19 Comment: But I think Liverpool look comfortable, and certainly from the breakaway,\n32:23 Comment: anything can happen. They've got that lovely pace when they go forward.\n32:27 Comment: Thanks, Jamie.\n32:30 Comment: Tactic is United. You've got Mata, a left-footer on the right,\n32:33 Comment: Rooney, a right-footer on the left, to get down the line and cut back and whip those.\n32:38 Comment: Almost like in-swinging, three kicks, you can imagine it that way.\n32:44 Comment: Well done.\n32:46 Comment: And he's done that well, and he's peeled off straight into the box.\n32:49 Comment: Mourinho wants crosses, and here comes one from Valencia.\n32:53 Comment: Ibrahimovic and Fellaini going for it, the flag's gone up.\n32:57 Comment: The wrong areas to cross from, you don't cross from those areas.\n33:1 Comment: I don't think they're the crosses that Jose Mourinho wants,\n33:3 Comment: or that will worry the Liverpool defenders.\n33:6 Comment: Far too deep. You've got to play your way in to more dangerous areas.\n33:10 Comment: That's just hoiking it into the box.\n33:13 Comment: I see Mata and Ibrahimovic offside.\n33:16 Comment: I think they're going to be the best crossers in the ground,\n33:18 Comment: sitting up there underneath the cap.\n33:20 Comment: And the second best sitting alongside me.\n33:22 Comment: Decoy runner.\n33:24 Comment: Quite a combination there.\n33:36 Comment: Paired by Rotho.\n33:40 Comment: He's going direct and going direct.\n33:42 Comment: You've got to go direct from good positions.\n33:44 Comment: But he's

    "summary": "Manchester United and Liverpool, two of English football's most storied clubs, faced off in another fiercely contested bout at Old Trafford. Manchester United, riding high on a resurgent streak with six consecutive Premier League victories and improved morale, were joined by Liverpool, known for their high-tempo, aggressive style of play. This clash not only promised action but also tactical intrigue, given Jürgen Klopp’s decision to deploy a diamond formation, a departure from Liverpool's usual setup.\n\nAs the game began, Nottingham Forest legend Adam Lallana slotted into the number 10 role with Divock Origi and Roberto Firmino leading the front line. Liverpool’s midfield was bolstered by Jordan Henderson, Emre Can, and Georginio Wijnaldum, structured to put immediate pressure on United’s defense. Klopp's tactical shifts were evident; Liverpool posed their first threat early on, securing a corner within the first few minutes. Dejan Lovren's movements during set pieces tested United's defensive structures, exploiting spaces that Paul Pogba and Ander Herrera seemed unable to cover adequately.\n\nDespite the intense early moments ceded to the visiting side, both teams spent much of the first half sparring and understanding each other's rhythm. This competition was marked by crucial defensive contributions from both sides. Alexander-Arnold, Liverpool’s young right-back, had his hands full containing Anthony Martial, United’s young star who enjoyed considerable space on the left flank. Indeed, the dynamic between Martial and Alexander-Arnold would play a significant role throughout the game, as the Frenchman sought to penetrate Liverpool’s defense time and time again.\n\nUnited had their own tactical battle. Pogba, Herrera, and Michael Carrick were tasked with maintaining a disciplined shape in midfield. However, Pogba’s exuberance and perhaps over-excitement led to several errors. At one point, Pogba found himself wrestling with Lovren during a corner, eventually resulting in the Frenchman conceding a penalty. This marked a significant lapse not only in positioning but in judgment. James Milner stepped up confidently for Liverpool and converted from the spot, placing the ball beyond David de Gea’s reach. The visitors were now ahead, silencing much of the Old Trafford crowd.\n\nThroughout the first half, the tension escalated. United had their moments of counter-attacking brilliance, particularly through Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Zlatan Ibrahimović. Yet a combination of solid defensive play from Lovren and an impressive display from Simon Mignolet in goal kept the Red Devils at bay. Liverpool, for their part, continued pressing, with Origi testing United's central defense with his aggressive play. As the half drew to a close, United’s more notable chances included a scuffed shot from Pogba, reflecting his disrupted rhythm and composure.\n\nAs the second half commenced, the tactical chessboard saw another adjustment: Jose Mourinho introduced Wayne Rooney, adding another layer of experience and ingenuity to Manchester United’s attacking endeavors. This switch saw Rooney operating just behind Ibrahimović, while Pogba and Herrera paired up centrally. The shift was perhaps Mourinho's attempt to gain more control in the attacking third and push Liverpool back.\n\nThis period saw renewed vigor from United. Rooney’s entry brought additional stability and direction, aiming to unlock Liverpool's defense. Martial continued to be a torment on the left, while Valencia, overlapping effectively, delivered several threatening crosses. Yet, Liverpool’s rear guard, marshaled impeccably by Lovren and Klavan, was sturdy. The young Alexander-Arnold, despite occasional lapses marked by nervousness and positional naivety, notably against Martial, showed tenacity.\n\nLiverpool themselves continued to be menacing on the break. Coutinho, introduced into the game, injected creativity and a sense of danger. His influence was immediate, nearly assisting Firmino to score against De Gea. Yet, the Spaniard goalkeeper showcased his reliability, thwarting this opportunity and keeping Manchester United within striking distance.\n\nAs the game progressed into the final quarter, both sides displayed the frantic urgency typical of such high-stake clashes. Mourinho’s final roll of the dice came with the introduction of Marouane Fellaini. This move signaled United’s intent to utilize a more direct approach, leveraging Fellaini's aerial presence alongside Ibrahimović. This tactical tweak greatly paid off. \n\nUnder building pressure, Liverpool’s defense finally yielded. Unleashing a high ball into the area, Valencia’s cross found Fellaini, whose header cannoned off the post, falling kindly for Ibrahimović. With characteristic poise and incredible neck strength, the Swede executed a deft header that looped over Mignolet, finding the back of the net to level the score. Old Trafford erupted. United, now smelling blood, pushed for a dramatic winner.\n\nThe closing minutes were a testament to end-to-end football at its finest. Liverpool, stunned by the equalizer, sought to reclaim their lead through Coutinho’s incisive play and further forays by Firmino and Lallana. At the other end, United, buoyed by their newfound momentum, pressed forward relentlessly. Rooney, energizing the attacks, tried his luck with several efforts but lacked the finishing touch to secure a victory.\n\nUltimately, the final whistle confirmed a 1-1 draw, results reflecting the intense, evenly matched nature of the contest. Neither side could clinch all three points, but both managers could take heart from their team’s spirited performances. Mourinho had halted Klopp’s free-flowing Liverpool, while Klopp had tested United to their limits, demonstrating the resilience and tactical depth of both teams.\n\nAs the players trooped off, thoughts were already turning to future spars between these historic rivals. This fixture, steeped in tradition and fervor, will undoubtedly add another captivating chapter when they next meet. Lessons learned from this encounter will be dissected and analyzed, as both teams continue their campaigns, with Liverpool maintaining the slight upper hand in the league standings post-match. \n\nFor Manchester United and Liverpool fans, the anticipation for their next bout will be palpable, a stirring reminder of why this rivalry holds a special place in English football."
