    "input": "\n    Leicester 4 - 2 Manchester\n\nFirst Half:\n\n0:0 Comment: And Fernando getting an early touch, he's taking the place of Fernandinho,\n0:4 Comment: who will be quite a big miss for Manchester City apart from Aguero,\n0:9 Comment: because he's been certainly one of their best players this season.\n0:12 Comment: There you go, straight from the start,\n0:14 Comment: it looks as if Man City are playing with three at the back.\n0:17 Comment: Kolarov, John Stones, Kari Sane, you can see Zabaleta has pushed infield straight away,\n0:23 Comment: looks as if they've got two wing-backs, De Bruyne and Jesus Navas.\n0:28 Comment: Zabaleta did play in midfield and played pretty well against Celtic\n0:32 Comment: in that dead-rubber game in the Champions League in midweek.\n0:42 Comment: Here is Stones.\n0:46 Comment: I guess it was Leicester's win away to Manchester City back in February\n0:49 Comment: that made everybody believe they really could pull off the sensation.\n0:53 Comment: It was a stylish win, but of course it's been a different story this year,\n0:57 Comment: with the title defence going pretty wrong.\n1:5 Comment: Raheem Sterling, by the way, is on the bench for Manchester City today,\n1:8 Comment: as is Yaya Touré.\n1:10 Comment: You wonder whether Sterling had come straight back in after his injury, not so.\n1:14 Comment: Navas still getting the nod.\n1:19 Comment: Here is Sane.\n1:21 Comment: Goes out of play on the far side.\n1:27 Comment: They're waiting in reserve, that is a multi-million town, Manchester City bench.\n1:35 Comment: Yeah, the manager can't blame the lack of depth in his squad,\n1:38 Comment: he's got over £100 million worth sitting there.\n1:41 Comment: Come on, come on!\n1:47 Comment: Tom Vite, Fernando, rather unwittingly by the look of it.\n1:50 Comment: Stones had to help out.\n1:54 Comment: Kolarov, Manchester City switching all the time between a back four and a back three.\n1:59 Comment: This season they've been multitudinous,\n2:1 Comment: Jadon Vardy getting the ball here...\n2:3 Comment: And putting Manchester City, Leicester City and Hernandez in the game!\n2:9 Comment: Jamie Vardy with the goal, he breaks the drought at last,\n2:13 Comment: after three months without a goal, and Manchester City in trouble straight away.\n2:18 Comment: What a start for Leicester, what a relief for Vardy.\n2:23 Comment: And it's a lovely goal as well.\n2:26 Comment: Great touch by Mahrez to Slomani.\n2:28 Comment: Big punt by Kolarov, easy-headed he wins it here.\n2:31 Comment: Look at this touch by Mahrez,\n2:33 Comment: have someone answer Slomani and he's just thinking,\n2:35 Comment: Where's Vardy? Simple pass, gets across Kolarov,\n2:38 Comment: lovely, lovely finish.\n2:41 Comment: What a start to the game.\n2:47 Comment: Great finish by Vardy, certainly not short of confidence.\n2:53 Comment: 16 games without a goal, and it's over now,\n2:56 Comment: the manager knows what it means.\n3:0 Comment: That's a huge inward sigh of relief for Vardy.\n3:5 Comment: Looks like we're gonna have some goals here as well, Chef.\n3:8 Comment: Well, I talked about it two or three minutes ago,\n3:10 Comment: that there were 23 goals prior to today's game.\n3:14 Comment: The type of surfaces are greasy, it suits forwards,\n3:17 Comment: and I think any team would gain confidence\n3:21 Comment: when they see a Man City backline\n3:24 Comment: that consists of Sanya, Stones and Kolarov.\n3:28 Comment: To play a back three today is more than surprising.\n3:32 Comment: They've made too many changes this season,\n3:35 Comment: and the problems are there for everyone to see in the opening few minutes.\n3:39 Comment: It was an excellent goal, well taken by Vardy,\n3:42 Comment: but City, they cause themselves problems.\n3:49 Comment: It's generated a huge noise around this stadium,\n3:52 Comment: Leicester in need of the points in the relegation argument at the moment.\n3:57 Comment: They now have a clear two-month passage\n4:0 Comment: to Champions League football,\n4:2 Comment: so they're trying to put some points in the bag and climb the table.\n4:5 Comment: Christian Fuchs is gonna take the long throw,\n4:8 Comment: as Trevor said, it is a day where conditions are greasy.\n4:11 Comment: There was no need to water this pitch, the heavens did that.\n4:15 Comment: Here's Slimani here,\n4:17 Comment: and looking to make a second goal,\n4:19 Comment: and can't bring it, he's two!\n4:21 Comment: It's Andy King, with a wonderful strike!\n4:23 Comment: What a sensational start, within five minutes,\n4:26 Comment: Leicester City are two-nil!\n4:30 Comment: CHEERING\n4:37 Comment: Pep must be thinking, what on earth is happening?\n4:41 Comment: Talk about sixes and sevens, Manchester City,\n4:44 Comment: came from a long throw,\n4:47 Comment: just causes absolute chaos in there.\n4:50 Comment: Another hoot to Slimani, lovely ball,\n4:52 Comment: lay-back to Andy King.\n4:54 Comment: Talk about Jamie Vardy's nice finish, what about this?\n5:0 Comment: Gets a hand to it, but it's not strong enough.\n5:3 Comment: Let's have a look.\n5:4 Comment: Yep, fingertips to it.\n5:7 Comment: Steve, two weeks ago I was at Burnley\n5:9 Comment: and I talked about City's inability to deal with anything early.\n5:13 Comment: Leicester have watched that,\n5:15 Comment: the long throw in, simple throw in,\n5:17 Comment: they don't deal with the initial first ball,\n5:20 Comment: they don't have good headers of the ball.\n5:26 Comment: One incredible stuff, it's Andy King's first goal of the season,\n5:29 Comment: that one the player who remembers Leicester's days\n5:32 Comment: down in the third tier in League One.\n5:36 Comment: Lovely strike, could the goalkeeper have done better?\n5:40 Comment: Leicester don't care, here's Navas.\n5:43 Comment: Incredible start to the game.\n5:49 Comment: Manchester City have now kept one clean sheet\n5:52 Comment: in their last 17 matches in all competitions.\n5:55 Comment: Given the ball away there in midfield,\n5:58 Comment: Gondouan of all people.\n6:1 Comment: But as Trevor said, Ian,\n6:3 Comment: when you saw the Manchester City line-up today,\n6:6 Comment: I don't think even the fervent Manchester City fan\n6:9 Comment: thought they'd keep a clean sheet today.\n6:11 Comment: It's all about outscoring the opposition at the moment.\n6:14 Comment: They're too vulnerable at the back.\n6:16 Comment: Steve, as a former footballer,\n6:18 Comment: you wanted to play in your preferred position,\n6:20 Comment: where you know the position and you're most comfortable.\n6:23 Comment: When I look at this Man City side,\n6:25 Comment: Zabaleta is not a midfield player.\n6:27 Comment: Sane is not a player to play in a back three.\n6:30 Comment: Stones is a back four player.\n6:32 Comment: Is Mahrez jinking his way through?\n6:34 Comment: Is it going to be another one?\n6:35 Comment: Stones got the challenge in an important one,\n6:37 Comment: and Gondouan can bring it away,\n6:39 Comment: but Leicester City there were threatening another one.\n6:45 Comment: Two goals in the first four and a half minutes for Leicester City.\n6:50 Comment: I don't know what happens,\n6:51 Comment: but it looks as if Zabaleta has gone out to play-wise right now.\n6:57 Comment: I wonder whether he's going to play on the right-hand side\n7:0 Comment: or whether he's going to come back into the centre midfield position.\n7:6 Comment: Two minutes and 15 seconds between the two goals.\n7:10 Comment: Not bad, a goal every couple of minutes.\n7:14 Comment: Long may continue.\n7:18 Comment: I think I'm right in saying that every home team this afternoon\n7:21 Comment: scored three goals.\n7:25 Comment: I don't know how hopes are doing that.\n7:27 Comment: Trevor Leicester City now.\n7:29 Comment: Manchester City, the only plus here is\n7:31 Comment: they have got a long time to try to rescue the situation.\n7:38 Comment: They were one down in four minutes the other night\n7:40 Comment: against Celtic as well.\n7:42 Comment: Quickly came back in that game.\n7:45 Comment: Here's De Bruyne now.\n7:47 Comment: Silva.\n7:56 Comment: It suits Leicester, they just dropped right back,\n7:58 Comment: getting in nice shape.\n8:1 Comment: City have the ball down the sides.\n8:3 Comment: Navas.\n8:6 Comment: A bit of wing wizardry.\n8:8 Comment: Garmenen and Martí getting it away.\n8:10 Comment: It's been a tough introduction for him,\n8:12 Comment: trying to fill the big boots of N'Golo Kante.\n8:15 Comment: They really have missed him, Leicester City, this season.\n8:21 Comment: Leicester's loss, of course, has certainly been Chelsea's gain.\n8:26 Comment: Silva again.\n8:31 Comment: Navas is seeing a lot of the ball on that side.\n8:34 Comment: Cut back too far for Gondouane,\n8:37 Comment: who was furthest forward.\n8:39 Comment: It was a nice ball by Sarko Lesedol.\n8:45 Comment: Good.\n8:49 Comment: Paul Oliver in charge today,\n8:51 Comment: after his eventful day at Goodison Park.\n8:53 Comment: Here's the two goals, in case you're a little late in,\n8:56 Comment: maybe you've been at a match yourself.\n8:58 Comment: Vardy ending his drought like this.\n9:2 Comment: And then a second one,\n9:4 Comment: a sumptuous hit from Andy King.\n9:9 Comment: We're looking at the two goals again.\n9:11 Comment: We saw that on many occasions last year,\n9:13 Comment: Vardy going clear and striking for goal\n9:16 Comment: and finding the corner of the net.\n9:18 Comment: Good to see him back in form.\n9:20 Comment: As for the second goal,\n9:22 Comment: I'd be disappointed with Mike Keefer if he didn't save that.\n9:26 Comment: Bravo may be good on the floor, but he doesn't make big enough saves.\n9:29 Comment: I haven't seen him make a save yet to keep City in any game.\n9:37 Comment: It's a debate which will go on,\n9:39 Comment: not least among Manchester City fans themselves.\n9:43 Comment: It's the man under the microscope,\n9:45 Comment: Claudio Bravo with 110 caps for Chile\n9:49 Comment: and eight trophies for Barcelona.\n9:56 Comment: Stones.\n9:59 Comment: Sampdorta in that unfamiliar midfield role.\n10:4 Comment: I could say he's another player really playing out of position\n10:7 Comment: no matter how well he played against Celtic in the week.\n10:10 Comment: I don't remember him playing in the Premier League that often.\n10:13 Comment: I don't even know where he's playing.\n10:15 Comment: He started off in the centre of midfield,\n10:17 Comment: but now he's gone right back into the right-back position.\n10:24 Comment: You can see the two in the first five minutes,\n10:26 Comment: and he's gone right back to a flat-back four, it looks like.\n10:33 Comment: Pep Guardiola said after the defeat against Celtic\n10:36 Comment: an hour later, I was saying to myself,\n10:38 Comment: I'm very happy, I'm confident this is going to be a good season for us.\n10:47 Comment: He's had a good start here at Leicester,\n10:49 Comment: as Fernando tries to get himself out of that little corner.\n10:58 Comment: Leicester's ball.\n10:59 Comment: Typical Vardy pressing, that's what they've been missing this season.\n11:3 Comment: You just wonder, now that they've got out of the Champions League,\n11:7 Comment: of course, there's a big gap now before it starts again\n11:10 Comment: in the knockout stage in February,\n11:12 Comment: whether they can concentrate their minds on the Premier League.\n11:15 Comment: It appears so at the moment.\n11:18 Comment: There's been a lot of talking behind the scenes here,\n11:20 Comment: trying to get things right.\n11:21 Comment: Huth this time on the near post, he scored twice in that big game\n11:24 Comment: at the Etihad last season, Robert Huth.\n11:28 Comment: Yeah, Fernando gets across,\n11:30 Comment: and that was Picardi signing it out, and it's a corner.\n11:33 Comment: But they are dangerous in set pieces, aren't they?\n11:36 Comment: A distinct lack of height in that Man City defence\n11:39 Comment: without an Otamendi or a company or whoever plays centre-half.\n11:46 Comment: It's a turbocharged start, this, from Leicester City.\n11:51 Comment: Huth has stayed up here and wins the header,\n11:54 Comment: and then Slitnar tries to turn it gowards,\n11:56 Comment: he's just got two back on it.\n11:58 Comment: Wasn't quite cute enough with the eventual finish.\n12:1 Comment: Well, that's all they're going to do all afternoon,\n12:3 Comment: just stick it in the box.\n12:6 Comment: Stick it in the box and cause chaos.\n12:9 Comment: City getting themselves in a mess again,\n12:11 Comment: with Slimani looking to cut it down.\n12:14 Comment: It was another anxious moment for Bravo,\n12:16 Comment: this has been a nervous, unconvincing start.\n12:19 Comment: I said you give the ball away again there,\n12:21 Comment: at the moment you'd have to say,\n12:23 Comment: Manchester City, look at sixes and sevens here.\n12:30 Comment: Three suspensions have hit them at once, of course,\n12:33 Comment: going into this game.\n12:35 Comment: Gundogan looking to play it wide,\n12:37 Comment: here's Navas to Silva.\n13:0 Comment: A bit of a curl, a bit too long for Iheanacho,\n13:3 Comment: who was in there, Sturridge was waiting for that to drop,\n13:5 Comment: never did, quite dropping the way that he wanted to.\n13:10 Comment: Mahrez.\n13:13 Comment: Appreciating the play on the broad canvas,\n13:16 Comment: and Vardy breaking into space here,\n13:18 Comment: Slimani waiting in the middle.\n13:21 Comment: Back to King.\n13:30 Comment: Christian Fuchs.\n13:33 Comment: Manchester City trying to find that old magic feeling\n13:36 Comment: they had last season,\n13:38 Comment: when they were so dynamic and so organised,\n13:41 Comment: so tough to beat,\n13:42 Comment: they only lost three times on the way to their title win,\n13:45 Comment: they've already lost seven times this season,\n13:48 Comment: that's half their fixtures.\n13:51 Comment: They've started this game really, really well,\n13:53 Comment: and they've been a lot quicker with the ball,\n13:55 Comment: you see Albright in there,\n13:56 Comment: when he received the ball from Mahrez,\n13:57 Comment: a nice cross-field pass,\n13:58 Comment: one thing was to get it over to Vardy as soon as possible.\n14:1 Comment: Here's De Bruyne,\n14:3 Comment: Manchester City do have the place to get themselves back in this.\n14:6 Comment: One of them's on the ball now, it's De Bruyne...\n14:8 Comment: Oh!\n14:9 Comment: And it just didn't detach from Iheanacho,\n14:11 Comment: he'd got a little one, that was all,\n14:13 Comment: but he was offside anyway,\n14:14 Comment: and he managed to turn that in.\n14:17 Comment: You've got no problems with Manchester City pulling forward,\n14:20 Comment: they've got great, great forwards,\n14:22 Comment: you see Iheanacho there is offside,\n14:24 Comment: they've got great forwards,\n14:25 Comment: and you've got no problem that they'll score goals.\n14:27 Comment: I think they'll score goals today,\n14:29 Comment: which is a big problem for them.\n14:44 Comment: Manchester City fans literally singing in the rain here,\n14:47 Comment: after the side banged in two goals\n14:52 Comment: in the first four and a half minutes of the game.\n14:54 Comment: This is Kolarov,\n14:58 Comment: aimed towards Iheanacho,\n15:0 Comment: where's Morgan?\n15:1 Comment: Watching that one in the air,\n15:3 Comment: they left the City captain.\n15:8 Comment: Fernando.\n15:13 Comment: Only Tottenham in the Premier League\n15:15 Comment: have managed to stop Manchester City from scoring this season.\n15:20 Comment: One of the scores earlier in the game\n15:22 Comment: One of the scores earlier on,\n15:24 Comment: plenty of goals around,\n15:25 Comment: and Arsenal going to the top on goals scored\n15:28 Comment: ahead of Chelsea for the moment.\n15:30 Comment: Chelsea in action with us on VT Sport\n15:32 Comment: against West Bromwich Albion tomorrow.\n15:34 Comment: It's a noon kick-off, by the way.\n15:37 Comment: Premier League tonight, of course,\n15:39 Comment: at 8 o'clock, discussing all the big issues on VT Sport Run,\n15:43 Comment: and that Chelsea-West Brom game tomorrow at noon.\n15:46 Comment: The kick-off will be at 11.30.\n15:52 Comment: Chelsea!\n16:4 Comment: Difficult one for Fuchs to control.\n16:6 Comment: He did a pretty good job of it on this skinny surface.\n16:13 Comment: Morgan had to rather stretch for that.\n16:15 Comment: The one-two is nice and strong.\n16:17 Comment: Mahrez round the corner again.\n16:19 Comment: Mahrez, very surprisingly,\n16:21 Comment: hasn't scored yet in open play\n16:23 Comment: in the Premier League this season.\n16:25 Comment: Just three penalties.\n16:32 Comment: One of Leicester's problems, or has been,\n16:34 Comment: is the supply line between Mahrez and Vardy has dried up.\n16:40 Comment: Yeah, it was Slomani today who put Vardy through,\n16:43 Comment: but it was a lovely touch, wasn't it,\n16:45 Comment: by Mahrez to Slomani,\n16:47 Comment: so he was certainly involved in the first goal.\n16:50 Comment: But as Robbie and Donnie said in the studio before,\n16:53 Comment: that chemistry just hasn't been clicking today.\n16:56 Comment: That's De Bruyne, smashes one out of play.\n17:3 Comment: He never seems worried, but he must be a bit worried, Trevor.\n17:8 Comment: When you look at his record over the years,\n17:11 Comment: it seems a little bit petty to criticise one who's had so much success,\n17:15 Comment: but all I feel he's doing at the moment\n17:18 Comment: is just causing unnecessary confusion to his players.\n17:21 Comment: The team changes every game,\n17:24 Comment: defensively clearly the players didn't know\n17:27 Comment: what was expected of them when they got on the field.\n17:29 Comment: When this is the case, the opposition,\n17:31 Comment: they smell blood.\n17:33 Comment: You're at your most vulnerable when you're changing your system\n17:36 Comment: week in, week out, and they've struck early, Leicester.\n17:40 Comment: FANS SHOUT OUT\n17:44 Comment: Exactly what Leicester, whose own confidence might have been a bit fragile,\n17:48 Comment: exactly what they needed.\n18:4 Comment: Sanya.\n18:10 Comment: FANS CHANT\n18:16 Comment: Spread wide for De Bruyne.\n18:24 Comment: It's Fernando, it's only his fourth Premier League start of the season.\n18:28 Comment: Now they might make allowances for the conditions,\n18:31 Comment: but not too many.\n18:35 Comment: He was never gonna get it, you knew it was only gonna be one result there.\n18:40 Comment: As soon as you start lunging, he's never there.\n18:43 Comment: Steve, just prior to that, as that ball was struck across field\n18:46 Comment: it travelled all of 50 yards,\n18:49 Comment: when the ball was in the air, Márez really should have anticipated it\n18:53 Comment: gone and closed down De Bruyne.\n18:56 Comment: Danny Simpson will miss the trip to Bournemouth in midweek,\n18:59 Comment: and a full set of midweek fixtures coming up,\n19:2 Comment: and Simpson will be out of that one.\n19:4 Comment: So that will be a change to the regular back four\n19:6 Comment: that Leicester will be having to make.\n19:10 Comment: De Bruyne had to swing this in,\n19:12 Comment: one Manchester City goal could change the mood completely, of course.\n19:19 Comment: Sela punched it away.\n19:23 Comment: He's the Algerian Slimane,\n19:25 Comment: he was away for a lot of money, best part of £30 million.\n19:33 Comment: Fair to say not all Leicester signings have gelled straight away.\n19:40 Comment: Kolarov bringing this one forward,\n19:43 Comment: and hitting the referee, Michael Oliver.\n19:47 Comment: They're off again, Hoops' ball is a good one.\n19:50 Comment: Márez, instant ball, Vardy's in here!\n19:53 Comment: This is another one, 3-0!\n19:58 Comment: Manchester City ripped apart again,\n20:1 Comment: and Jamie Vardy is back in business in a major way now.\n20:6 Comment: It's like slow-mo, you can see it happening about ten seconds prior.\n20:11 Comment: Kolarov steps forward,\n20:13 Comment: they get a bit of misfortune when the ball ricochets off Michael Oliver.\n20:18 Comment: But one straight ball, and Márez is through.\n20:22 Comment: It was a sumptuous touch again,\n20:24 Comment: look how openly are Manchester City, look how openly are.\n20:28 Comment: This touch, like his first one, was beautiful,\n20:31 Comment: beautiful, right on a plate,\n20:33 Comment: makes his mind up the goalkeeper,\n20:35 Comment: he comes tearing out, and Vardy's only gonna do one thing.\n20:38 Comment: But how can you concede goals like this when you're 2-0 down?\n20:45 Comment: Like shelling peas, that one, for Jamie Vardy.\n20:48 Comment: They're the ones you want, aren't they, then?\n20:51 Comment: Back in the old routine.\n20:54 Comment: Márez, the statsmen tell me,\n20:56 Comment: had only created one chance all season in over 900 minutes,\n21:1 Comment: and his old buddy Jamie Vardy, before today,\n21:3 Comment: he certainly set up that one.\n21:6 Comment: Well, there's the home team score to each other anyway.\n21:11 Comment: Well, I'm just thinking, Steve,\n21:13 Comment: I don't want to be smug, but I kind of anticipated this.\n21:20 Comment: If you can't defend, then you have a huge problem,\n21:23 Comment: especially on an afternoon against Vardy and Márez,\n21:26 Comment: who are at the top of their form.\n21:28 Comment: Fernando, Zabaleta, Navas.\n21:33 Comment: Deflected behind, corner kick.\n21:36 Comment: Let's sit back and enjoy this game,\n21:38 Comment: because there's gonna be more goals, I think,\n21:40 Comment: the way the two teams are playing.\n21:55 Comment: Curled in there, Fernando,\n21:56 Comment: there wasn't a bit of space,\n21:58 Comment: and it was going to, really.\n22:2 Comment: Another very poor pass.\n22:10 Comment: Here's Gundogan.\n22:17 Comment: Leicester City winding back the clock a few months,\n22:20 Comment: and yet another error in midfield.\n22:23 Comment: Leicester City, here they come again,\n22:25 Comment: they're rampant, it's Márez,\n22:27 Comment: Slimane's arriving on the back post,\n22:29 Comment: Márez may go alone!\n22:30 Comment: This time Bravo does make the save.\n22:32 Comment: That was curling towards the corner too.\n22:37 Comment: I think that was simple enough for the goalkeeper,\n22:39 Comment: but again, chaos, confusion, whatever you want to say.\n22:45 Comment: But no real leadership.\n22:47 Comment: Márez just drove forward and nobody attacked the ball,\n22:50 Comment: and anything just let him get a shot off in the end.\n22:53 Comment: A worrying day, this, for Leicester City and their supporters.\n22:59 Comment: Three down in 20 minutes.\n23:3 Comment: Against the Leicester City side,\n23:4 Comment: who came into this match in no sort of form, really.\n23:11 Comment: Here's Silva.\n23:12 Comment: Silva.\n23:21 Comment: Zabaleta.\n23:23 Comment: Now Navas again.\n23:27 Comment: De Bruyne.\n23:30 Comment: Trying to find a half a yard to get his shot away.\n23:33 Comment: Navas and Zabaleta...\n23:35 Comment: And he went all the way to the end.\n23:36 Comment: Poor ball, poor ball.\n23:38 Comment: Good opportunity.\n23:40 Comment: A real lot of unforced errors from Manchester City.\n23:44 Comment: You see here, this is 40 yards away from the goal.\n23:47 Comment: Keeps on going, keeps on going,\n23:49 Comment: no pressure on the ball whatsoever,\n23:51 Comment: nobody goes and stops and thinks,\n23:53 Comment: I'd better go and tackle this fella.\n23:55 Comment: Once he gets into the box, gets a shot away,\n23:58 Comment: peds a five of them.\n24:0 Comment: Why are they allowing him to come onto his left foot?\n24:3 Comment: Have they never seen him play before?\n24:6 Comment: Good question, that.\n24:10 Comment: Match to Ponda.\n24:13 Comment: Pep Guardiola.\n24:16 Comment: This is the lowest points return at this stage\n24:19 Comment: in all his time as a manager.\n24:25 Comment: It's not the points I'm worried about,\n24:27 Comment: it's the level of performance today.\n24:30 Comment: Really lacklustre, lots and lots of mistakes they've made as well today.\n24:40 Comment: I suppose there will be the question,\n24:42 Comment: if you're playing a real cenit,\n24:44 Comment: could Michael Oliver, the referee,\n24:46 Comment: have a bit of an assist in that third goal?\n24:51 Comment: Here's De Bruyne.\n24:54 Comment: Collar up, looks to slide an early ball in right-hand,\n24:57 Comment: Morgan reading that.\n25:0 Comment: Leicester have the bit back between their teeth.\n25:9 Comment: They have to face accusations that they haven't worked hard enough,\n25:12 Comment: that the old spirit has gone.\n25:15 Comment: Some of the stats do support those arguments,\n25:17 Comment: and Claudio Ranieri himself used the word\n25:20 Comment: complacent about his team earlier this week.\n25:23 Comment: No complacency today.\n25:33 Comment: Steve, have a look at Collarall's position now,\n25:35 Comment: he's supposed to be playing as one of three at the back.\n25:38 Comment: He's playing high up on the left-hand side,\n25:41 Comment: more in an attacking wingers position.\n25:45 Comment: De Bruyne up.\n25:49 Comment: They're getting a lot of players behind the ball.\n25:53 Comment: Noticeably Albrighton coming in from the side\n25:56 Comment: to beef up that central midfield area.\n25:58 Comment: Service looking for a little one-two,\n25:59 Comment: is he a Nacho?\n26:0 Comment: And back to Korov, he can hit them!\n26:3 Comment: There's plenty of power, but not much direction.\n26:9 Comment: Yeah, they work the space well, actually.\n26:12 Comment: If you want it to fall to anybody,\n26:13 Comment: you want it to be Korov on his left peg.\n26:16 Comment: That's the final result.\n26:18 Comment: Let's look back on the goal again,\n26:19 Comment: this hits Michael Oliver in the build-up,\n26:21 Comment: Leicester get the ball,\n26:22 Comment: and it's a goal.\n26:24 Comment: It's a goal.\n26:25 Comment: There you go.\n26:27 Comment: Closing the machine there,\n26:28 Comment: but it's two touches in,\n26:29 Comment: one to Márez and a lovely ball through to Vardy\n26:31 Comment: who finish it off.\n26:32 Comment: It's even quicker on that replay.\n26:33 Comment: It was quick, wasn't it there?\n26:34 Comment: Really quick.\n26:36 Comment: The speed of it running backwards was amazing.\n26:40 Comment: But still, when it hits Michael Oliver,\n26:41 Comment: it's on the edge of the Leicester box.\n26:44 Comment: There's no excuses, really.\n26:47 Comment: It's a goal.\n26:55 Comment: I think it was Fuchs, wasn't it,\n26:56 Comment: with the big left-footed diagonal pass?\n26:58 Comment: Yeah.\n26:59 Comment: Here's Vardy again.\n27:3 Comment: Too short that one for Albrighton.\n27:9 Comment: Silvers ball.\n27:11 Comment: Navas is quick, but he's not quick enough to catch that one.\n27:14 Comment: We'll have a look at that again.\n27:17 Comment: Michael Oliver won't be happy.\n27:19 Comment: That hits him, goes to Fuchs.\n27:20 Comment: This is some ball.\n27:22 Comment: Yeah, but there's only one person\n27:23 Comment: who's expecting it, isn't he?\n27:24 Comment: And it's Mahrez.\n27:26 Comment: And then Jamie Vardy just runs away from Kolarov.\n27:29 Comment: It was a substitute touch, wasn't it, by Mahrez.\n27:32 Comment: Real back to form.\n27:33 Comment: That was beautiful, that.\n27:35 Comment: We saw Kolarov last week, didn't we?\n27:37 Comment: Trying to catch Hazard.\n27:38 Comment: It looks like he's running through Trickell.\n27:40 Comment: And we've got the same thing there.\n27:46 Comment: Leicester City have to get all this sorted out\n27:49 Comment: if they're going to mount a proper title challenge\n27:53 Comment: this season.\n27:55 Comment: High pressure here, and City.\n27:58 Comment: Stones have to just hack it away.\n28:0 Comment: And once again, they've got themselves\n28:2 Comment: in a most fearful mess back there.\n28:7 Comment: You can see it coming.\n28:10 Comment: Everybody's really, really slow.\n28:11 Comment: So you know there's no urgency to move the ball forward.\n28:18 Comment: Simpson has to go backwards this time.\n28:23 Comment: Silva launches it down for Kolarov.\n28:26 Comment: Not quite sure of his bearings for a moment,\n28:28 Comment: but the bouncer's kind enough for the serving in the end.\n28:41 Comment: Zabaleta they are missing.\n28:43 Comment: Fernandinho in a big way, I'd say, so far in this game.\n28:47 Comment: Among others, of course, there's N'Sejo Agüero.\n28:53 Comment: They haven't put any blame on Ian Nacho so far.\n28:55 Comment: No service for him yet.\n29:4 Comment: Real big test here now of what Manchester City are made of.\n29:10 Comment: Can they plot a route back into this game\n29:12 Comment: from what looks a near impossible situation?\n29:15 Comment: A number of years ago, Manchester City coming from three down\n29:18 Comment: with ten men in a cup tie at Spurs and winning 4-3.\n29:25 Comment: It's going to need something like that.\n29:27 Comment: Zabaleta found a good ball that time, one-side Silva.\n29:32 Comment: Navas getting the cross away.\n29:34 Comment: It's only gone as far as Zabaleta.\n29:36 Comment: Gundogan!\n29:37 Comment: Missed cue from him.\n29:39 Comment: De Bruyne.\n29:40 Comment: It was the corner kick for Kelvin De Bruyne\n29:42 Comment: of the Belgian international\n29:44 Comment: to take in a £55m signing.\n29:51 Comment: Flicked on at the near post and just wide!\n29:55 Comment: Lewandowski, coming on and getting into it\n30:2 Comment: while also playing up front high up.\n30:6 Comment: Good game, a Chelsea goal from Hurley.\n30:8 Comment: Just wide, very, very nearly for Kolorov there.\n30:12 Comment: Yeah, that was unlucky actually, that was a flick by Fernando Kolorov.\n30:17 Comment: That was over Wes Morgan, he does his job, Wes Morgan, eventually.\n30:21 Comment: That was a quick, close one, sorry.\n30:25 Comment: Kolorov does well.\n30:29 Comment: Big let-off that for Leicester, Kolorov will be feeling he could have put that in.\n30:33 Comment: And at the other end, the latest chaos.\n30:39 Comment: Yeah.\n30:45 Comment: And eventually gets hoofed.\n30:47 Comment: You don't mind teams playing from the back, but when you're getting pressured,\n30:51 Comment: there was two or three blue shirts there, you just forget about it and clear your lines.\n30:57 Comment: A lot of young children playing Sunday morning football tomorrow,\n31:0 Comment: I hope they're not going to watch that and try and do that tomorrow.\n31:3 Comment: I'm sure their fathers are telling them exactly the same thing.\n31:9 Comment: Trevor is Navas on his right-hand side.\n31:22 Comment: Interesting to see how Pep Guardiola might reorganize things and how he goes about\n31:28 Comment: trying to find a way back in this game.\n31:30 Comment: Still plenty of time, Kolorov.\n31:36 Comment: Thinks about the cross shot again, it hits Silva on the way.\n31:39 Comment: Back to De Bruyne.\n31:42 Comment: And Seles all up quite late.\n31:49 Comment: Leicester have let in two in each of their last four games in the Premier League.\n31:55 Comment: Hoof getting it away.\n31:57 Comment: Back in by De Bruyne and away by Morgan.\n31:59 Comment: Manchester City beginning to knock a little harder at the door.\n32:4 Comment: Yeah, a bit more possession by City in good areas.\n32:9 Comment: Leicester just retreating a little bit.\n32:19 Comment: De Bruyne to drive that ball.\n32:21 Comment: De Bruyne to drive, that one goes across, it just wanted a touch from somebody.\n32:31 Comment: Yeah, it's Wes Morgan and Robert Hutu in the job on Kolorov and John Stones.\n32:36 Comment: Here's the ball from De Bruyne.\n32:38 Comment: Simple enough for the goalkeeper, took a little deflection.\n32:50 Comment: Another way to use on Kasper Schmeichel,\n32:53 Comment: as he was pushing to play in this game after his broken hand,\n32:57 Comment: but it was decided he wasn't quite ready, but he could return in midweek.\n33:2 Comment: That game at Bournemouth, which Danny Simpson will now miss,\n33:5 Comment: because of the yellow card accumulation.\n33:7 Comment: He's got work to do now up against De Bruyne.\n33:11 Comment: Corner.\n33:21 Comment: Trevor, how do Leicester play this now from three up?\n33:26 Comment: Well, they've got to play intelligently, of course.\n33:28 Comment: You know, they're 3-0 up, which they would have anticipated.\n33:31 Comment: I think they've got to try and get to 3-0 in half-time,\n33:34 Comment: and then decisions can be made.\n33:36 Comment: Without doubt, if Ranieri was managing in Serie A in Italy,\n33:39 Comment: he would bring off one of the forwards and go 4-5-1.\n33:43 Comment: He's not managing in Italy, and he may stick with 4-4-2,\n33:46 Comment: because it's a different type of game in England.\n33:49 Comment: If anything, this should suit them even more, shouldn't it?\n33:51 Comment: Trevor, they can just play on the counter-attack again.\n33:55 Comment: Well, midweek games too, look forward to.\n33:58 Comment: And before that, Chelsea against West Bromwich.\n33:59 Comment: We'll be in tomorrow at 11.30, with a 12 o'clock kicker,\n34:2 Comment: Chelsea looking to go back on top in midweek.\n34:5 Comment: On Tuesday, great game as ever to play Arsenal at Goodison,\n34:8 Comment: it'll be a massive atmosphere for that.\n34:9 Comment: We're on the air at seven o'clock on the following night,\n34:12 Comment: Crystal Palace against Manchester United.\n34:14 Comment: And in this slot next week, West Bromwich Albion's game\n34:18 Comment: against Manchester United.\n34:19 Comment: West Brom in pretty good form at the moment under Tony Pulis.\n34:26 Comment: That one ended 5-5, didn't it? Sir Alex's last game.\n34:30 Comment: Last game, yeah.\n34:32 Comment: Here's Stones for Manchester City.\n34:37 Comment: Nabas, can he get past him?\n34:39 Comment: He's got a chance, he's got a chance.\n34:42 Comment: Nabas, can he get past Fuchs?\n34:47 Comment: Quick pick-up, Zabaleta, easily cut out.\n34:52 Comment: He was in again there, Vardy.\n34:53 Comment: Vardy could have found him.\n34:57 Comment: Slimane.\n34:59 Comment: Breakdown in communication between him and Vardy,\n35:1 Comment: who apologises for not having made a little run to latch onto that.\n35:5 Comment: Latch onto that.\n35:9 Comment: Poor ball from De Bruyne, Manchester City have done that a lot here.\n35:14 Comment: This time it's Leicester giving it away with Mahrez, though.\n35:18 Comment: It's De Bruyne again.\n35:24 Comment: I don't know whether it's the weather.\n35:28 Comment: A little bit of surface water slowing the ball up,\n35:30 Comment: but everybody seems to be giving the ball away.\n35:36 Comment: And players you wouldn't think would be doing it,\n35:40 Comment: players like Gündoğan and De Bruyne.\n35:46 Comment: Shawcap Guardiola is thinking, despite the 3-0 deficit,\n35:50 Comment: Manchester City are not dead in this game.\n35:55 Comment: Of course not, of course not.\n35:57 Comment: They've got too much quality.\n36:0 Comment: They need to do something defensively, and that's the problem.\n36:3 Comment: It's the Achilles heel at the moment in time.\n36:6 Comment: BALL BOUNCES\n36:9 Comment: Collar off.\n36:10 Comment: It's like this time from 30 yards out.\n36:13 Comment: Look at that picture there, Ian, there's all the Leicester team.\n36:16 Comment: That's what Manchester City have to try and break down now,\n36:18 Comment: because the 3-0 down, so condensed, they're letting them go wide.\n36:22 Comment: If you're going to come into the middle of a park,\n36:24 Comment: you're going to have to break this wall of blue down, it's really difficult.\n36:28 Comment: Well, look at that fast step there.\n36:32 Comment: BALL BOUNCES\n36:35 Comment: The one that matters is at the bottom of your picture now.\n36:37 Comment: Absolutely, Ian, absolutely.\n36:43 Comment: Gündoğan.\n36:48 Comment: Navas again.\n36:53 Comment: Silva.\n36:54 Comment: Navas driving it across, and Robert Hooke doing his job well.\n36:57 Comment: Gündoğan to Silva.\n37:3 Comment: Navas.\n37:4 Comment: And again, you can't get the cross that matters.\n37:20 Comment: Leicester with the luxury now.\n37:23 Comment: Sitting back, trying to keep it tight and play on the counter,\n37:27 Comment: which they've done of course to some effect for some time now.\n37:33 Comment: And it's Fulcs' back-header.\n37:41 Comment: It's OK, Gündoğan again.\n37:51 Comment: De Bruyne towards the back post, Iheanacho, and Sêla just did that enough.\n37:55 Comment: He's come out here to John Stones now.\n37:58 Comment: Gündoğan couldn't bring it under control at the vital moment,\n38:2 Comment: here comes the attempted break with Islam Slemani.\n38:5 Comment: Stamwell, found Vardy.\n38:7 Comment: Now Amate.\n38:10 Comment: Mahrez, again a first-time ball from him to Andy King.\n38:15 Comment: Mahrez hasn't been involved that much, but when he's flitted into the action,\n38:18 Comment: it's been with spectacular results.\n38:20 Comment: I wonder if Jamie Vardy could have just told Andy King to leave it there.\n38:28 Comment: It's always stretchy.\n38:36 Comment: It's interesting, the starting position of Mahrez,\n38:39 Comment: he's more of an attacking midfield player on the right-hand side,\n38:42 Comment: they've almost got three up the way Leicester are playing.\n38:45 Comment: Nobody's coming within ten yards of Mahrez,\n38:48 Comment: and Bruyne has pushed on.\n38:51 Comment: PLAYERS CHEERING\n38:53 Comment: Players pulled back here for the free-kick,\n38:55 Comment: which a little bit belated the decision on that side.\n38:59 Comment: You can see the hit assistant there, I was thinking about it, it was a foul.\n39:3 Comment: It was a very belated shout, wasn't it?\n39:5 Comment: Now that's all right, he goes to ground.\n39:8 Comment: Yeah, it was a foul.\n39:14 Comment: I guess the right decision in the end, it's only a couple of seconds later.\n39:20 Comment: FANS CHANTING\n39:30 Comment: Jake Cole and the official on that far side.\n39:34 Comment: He seemed to think about it for a moment, and put his flag up.\n39:38 Comment: It's fine though, isn't it? The main thing is it's the right decision.\n39:43 Comment: City need something, you feel, to bite on before half-time here.\n39:51 Comment: Kevin De Bruyne.\n39:53 Comment: That's well defended, there's a bit of pushing the referee decided as well,\n39:58 Comment: and he gets Leicester the free-kick.\n40:2 Comment: I think he did it for Iheanacho on Wes Morgan, I think.\n40:9 Comment: Yeah, six-a-one really, isn't it?\n40:11 Comment: Wes has got his arm round the back of Iheanacho,\n40:13 Comment: he's got his arms over Wes Morgan's shoulders.\n40:17 Comment: At the very least, by the look of it, yeah.\n40:20 Comment: Iheanacho playing his 50th game, by the way, for Manchester City,\n40:30 Comment: already at the age of 20.\n40:32 Comment: They need him to come good in this little spell where he's in the team,\n40:36 Comment: because Sergio Aguero can't play again now until New Year's Eve against Liverpool.\n40:44 Comment: And that game you'll see with us on BT Sport, by the way, over the holiday period.\n40:50 Comment: What would you do, Trevor? Would you make changes at half-time if you're Pep?\n40:54 Comment: He doesn't have much on the bench, does he?\n40:56 Comment: Apart from Sterling, Tore, Nolito.\n41:0 Comment: I've got two options, sir.\n41:6 Comment: It just depends how he sees it.\n41:8 Comment: I mean, the problems, as we've spoken throughout this opening 41 minutes,\n41:12 Comment: are at the back.\n41:14 Comment: Going forward, there aren't too many problems.\n41:16 Comment: He's got huge options on the bench.\n41:18 Comment: He can do whatever he wants, but it's not going to change what's going to happen at the back.\n41:22 Comment: Because there's an imbalance in the squad.\n41:24 Comment: Plenty of midfielders, plenty of attackers, but not enough defenders.\n41:28 Comment: Another attacker arriving in January, Israel, with Gabriel Jesus,\n41:32 Comment: the Brazilian international striker.\n41:34 Comment: He's moving to Manchester to have a meal with some of the players.\n41:40 Comment: Kolarov laces the side, De Bruyne.\n41:45 Comment: Kolarov again.\n41:48 Comment: Fernando, blocked on the way through.\n41:50 Comment: Nestor defending well.\n41:52 Comment: Yeah, it was nice by much of the city, working it wide.\n41:54 Comment: You need a little bit of patience to get round the sides.\n41:58 Comment: Bless that.\n42:4 Comment: Neves again, now getting the treatment from the crowd.\n42:8 Comment: Simpson heads it away, it hasn't gone far.\n42:12 Comment: De Bruyne, and Hoop.\n42:14 Comment: Clever header for the corner kick, exactly what he was doing.\n42:18 Comment: He's done all his experience there, Robert Hoop.\n42:20 Comment: Yeah, nice ball in by De Bruyne.\n42:22 Comment: Real good shape on it, wasn't it?\n42:29 Comment: Got it out of harm's way.\n42:36 Comment: It goes a long way, it's on the floor.\n42:38 Comment: It is on the floor, Michael Oliver's not interested.\n42:40 Comment: The referee has joined in again.\n42:42 Comment: See Robert Hoop and John Stones then.\n42:45 Comment: Talking about referees giving fouls and penalties in certain areas.\n42:48 Comment: The manhandling there.\n42:50 Comment: What's the pain of them?\n42:55 Comment: Wow.\n42:58 Comment: I think there's only one referee who's given any decisions for that kind of...\n43:4 Comment: ...contact in the box.\n43:7 Comment: It was supposed to be a big clap down there, wasn't it?\n43:9 Comment: At the start of the season, Mike Dean did give a penalty or two along the way.\n43:13 Comment: Fair play to him, fair play to Mike Dean.\n43:17 Comment: I just think probably he took the view there.\n43:19 Comment: Six of one, half a dozen of the other.\n43:21 Comment: Good work out which way you'd give it.\n43:23 Comment: Yeah, there was two fouls there was.\n43:31 Comment: Fuchs with the little chip forward aimed.\n43:34 Comment: For Albrighton, Vardy's run the channel again.\n43:38 Comment: Not a play this time.\n43:43 Comment: Vardy, by the way, the only English player nominated for the Ballon d'Or in quite a long list.\n43:50 Comment: Not sure how that Hollywood movie script's coming along.\n43:54 Comment: Very nice.\n44:1 Comment: Fuchs to get this one away for Leicester City.\n44:4 Comment: A dream first half for them here.\n44:10 Comment: I'm sure that Ranieri is tempted, you know, Ian, to get an extra body in the middle of the park.\n44:16 Comment: But it's so difficult to do that when you're leading 3-0 at half-time, playing 4-4-2.\n44:20 Comment: For us, Sadio Pierre, yeah, you can talk about those things.\n44:23 Comment: But when you're actually sat down there and the heat is on,\n44:26 Comment: trying to change it at half-time is terribly difficult.\n44:30 Comment: Well, he's always been a 4-4-2 man, isn't he?\n44:32 Comment: Of course, last season, most of the while, he had Okazaki working back one of the two forwards.\n44:37 Comment: Almost make it like a 4-4-1-1.\n44:42 Comment: That has been an issue without Conte's energy and work in there this season.\n44:48 Comment: De Bruyne down the side, Silva.\n44:51 Comment: That's it in.\n44:54 Comment: Wes Morgan, Leicester determined to take this three-goal advantage into the break with them.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Certainly three substitutes out now to warm up, but there was nobody warming up in the pitcher at half-time.\n0:5 Comment: A couple of changes, it looks as if Pesuznavas has gone across to the left.\n0:9 Comment: Pavlos Abaletas certainly on the right flank now.\n0:13 Comment: Still three at the back.\n0:17 Comment: Let's have a look at Riquelme Thuram-Martey, well, that's Slimane.\n0:21 Comment: Trying to develop a chemistry with Jamie Vardy.\n0:24 Comment: And Ed Musa, the expensive signing, hasn't really been able to force his way in for any length of time.\n0:30 Comment: He's on the bench again today.\n0:31 Comment: Booth winning the header.\n0:37 Comment: It's a lovely touch again from Mares, who's been full of that today.\n0:44 Comment: Albrighton took his time, too much time.\n0:48 Comment: Booth throwing it forward.\n0:50 Comment: All the onus here on Manchester City to change this game somehow.\n0:56 Comment: Gundogan to lay it wide.\n1:2 Comment: Now just as Stieber's Tannay, who's gone out to the left-hand side now.\n1:6 Comment: That's a little tweak from Pep Guardiola.\n1:10 Comment: That's too near the goalkeeper, that attempted cross from Abaleta.\n1:21 Comment: Don't think he's the type who'd be hurling teacups around, is he?\n1:26 Comment: Well, he's probably said to the players, listen, you've got us into this mess,\n1:29 Comment: now I'm going to give you the opportunity to go and get a drink.\n1:32 Comment: And he's got a drink.\n1:34 Comment: He's got a drink.\n1:35 Comment: Well, he's probably said to the players, listen, you've got us into this mess,\n1:38 Comment: now I'm going to give you the opportunity to go and get a drink.\n1:41 Comment: Of course he could have made changes, that was the easy thing to do.\n1:44 Comment: Because there are so many players in this first half who really didn't show up.\n1:48 Comment: Long throw from Christian Foulkes.\n1:52 Comment: He was a key figure in the title win last season.\n1:56 Comment: The Austrian left back.\n2:1 Comment: So, half his head away, doesn't do very well.\n2:5 Comment: He's got a little bit of a headwind.\n2:14 Comment: So, half his head away, doesn't do very well.\n2:17 Comment: Foulkes has got another chance to play this one back in.\n2:22 Comment: Well, that was an opportunity, that by Christian Foulkes there on his right foot.\n2:26 Comment: Unfortunately he had a lot of bodies in there, Leicester, in that penalty area.\n2:30 Comment: Bit of a mismatch in there.\n2:36 Comment: Manchester City did come from behind to win at Burnley recently,\n2:40 Comment: but they weren't three behind.\n2:43 Comment: But also, Ian, they've had lots of possession, as we saw the stats before.\n2:47 Comment: They haven't really had any good chances, have they?\n2:49 Comment: Leicester have been quite comfortable defensively in the first half.\n2:55 Comment: Let's see if people start to tie in in the second half.\n2:58 Comment: Silva.\n2:59 Comment: Navas.\n3:2 Comment: Silva again.\n3:4 Comment: Just a little too over-elaborate.\n3:5 Comment: Mahrez doing a rare piece of work.\n3:9 Comment: Mahrez doing a rare piece of tracking back, but he's caused enough damage today anyway.\n3:16 Comment: Kolarov wins the free kick.\n3:21 Comment: Which they want to take quickly.\n3:22 Comment: Silva.\n3:24 Comment: Navas to play it in.\n3:25 Comment: Ian Atcher looking for something spectacular.\n3:27 Comment: Will it drop for De Bruyne?\n3:28 Comment: No, it won't.\n3:29 Comment: For all Leicester's problems this season, they have only been beaten at home once.\n3:33 Comment: That was by West Bromwich Albion.\n3:41 Comment: The way forward has been pretty wretched.\n3:45 Comment: What about Chelsea in the cup?\n3:50 Comment: Oh, yeah, I'm talking about the Premier League, Trevor.\n3:52 Comment: Come on, Sheff.\n3:59 Comment: Don't try and catch him like that.\n4:1 Comment: No, no, he's done that often enough.\n4:4 Comment: Navas again waiting for Ian Atcher, waiting in the middle for a chance.\n4:13 Comment: Lots of blue shirts backed up there.\n4:16 Comment: Good doer.\n4:19 Comment: Navas, Ian Atcher, got to the near post.\n4:22 Comment: Savaleta's shot was on its way, blocked by Fuchs on the way through.\n4:25 Comment: De Bruyne had tried his luck and again, and it's wide.\n4:29 Comment: And you get the feeling that it isn't Manchester City's day, don't you?\n4:32 Comment: Yeah, he's not getting handball for that.\n4:34 Comment: In all honesty, Ian Atcher should have scored there.\n4:37 Comment: Misses the header completely.\n4:39 Comment: Good block by Christian Fuchs, he's not getting handball for that.\n4:42 Comment: Bounces off Albright, and a little bit of frustration as he scoos the ball wide.\n4:47 Comment: Pavlos Savaleta trying his luck there.\n4:49 Comment: Of course, he was a scorer of a very famous Manchester City goal on the day\n4:54 Comment: they pitched the title in such dramatic circumstances against QPR.\n4:59 Comment: Ian Atcher has been held back there by Huth, he's way too quick for him.\n5:2 Comment: But has that turned back into trouble, I fear?\n5:5 Comment: Yeah.\n5:6 Comment: Now, good doer.\n5:10 Comment: Savaleta, he's got to be careful.\n5:12 Comment: Now, good doer.\n5:17 Comment: Navas.\n5:20 Comment: Ian, you're absolutely right about Huth not having the pace,\n5:23 Comment: but the goalkeeper could have done better.\n5:25 Comment: His starting position is too deep.\n5:34 Comment: Yeah, it's just Kael in that far corner, was it?\n5:36 Comment: Robert Huth, he was going wide.\n5:43 Comment: Better tempo though from Manchester City now,\n5:45 Comment: and this starts the second half.\n5:49 Comment: Lipped off by Vardy towards Flamani.\n5:51 Comment: Sadio, good covering from Minato.\n5:58 Comment: Service headers down is a nice one.\n6:2 Comment: Nicely cushioned.\n6:6 Comment: Sturridge has been asking for a lot of De Bruyne.\n6:12 Comment: We saw for the first time there, John Stones pushing on into midfield,\n6:16 Comment: adding another player to what is already a packed midfield.\n6:22 Comment: I just think the signs are ominous already for Leicester.\n6:26 Comment: I know they're screaming a lot, but it's all Man City.\n6:29 Comment: It's not going to be too long before they get themselves a goal,\n6:32 Comment: and they'll be right back in this game.\n6:34 Comment: De Bruyne.\n6:36 Comment: That's a very good punch indeed by Robert.\n6:39 Comment: See, goalkeeper who played every game for five seasons in the Bundesliga,\n6:43 Comment: for Hannover before coming to the East Midlands.\n6:50 Comment: Poor ball from Zappoletta, but Leicester collar off winning that one.\n6:56 Comment: Nice overlock, good move from Manchester City,\n6:58 Comment: Navas bouncing around, ping-pong in the penalty area,\n7:2 Comment: Leicester sitting very, very deep now, and inviting Manchester City on.\n7:9 Comment: There's the cross, and the...\n7:12 Comment: Superman impression.\n7:14 Comment: There we go.\n7:19 Comment: It's a good punch, though, isn't it?\n7:21 Comment: I'd rather have caught it, to be honest.\n7:23 Comment: I knew you'd say that.\n7:27 Comment: But it looked great, it looked good.\n7:31 Comment: I think the photographers enjoyed it, didn't they?\n7:33 Comment: Yeah, yeah.\n7:34 Comment: I think it was a good one.\n7:36 Comment: I think the photographers enjoyed it, didn't they?\n7:38 Comment: Yeah, yeah.\n7:43 Comment: Manchester City again, can they claw their way back against all the odds in this game?\n7:52 Comment: Collar off having to go long, Iheanacho up against the whole defence,\n7:56 Comment: he's taking a blow to the face there, Morgan too,\n7:58 Comment: both of them ending that, holding on to their face.\n8:7 Comment: FANS CHANT\n8:21 Comment: You can really see the blow to Morgan, but there you are.\n8:26 Comment: Both look up.\n8:29 Comment: Gundogan.\n8:32 Comment: De Bruyne, looking to pick the club away, Iheanacho's offside.\n8:35 Comment: Won't count, and in any case, Siva made a very good save.\n8:40 Comment: He was on a couple of times, but he was offside a few times as well,\n8:43 Comment: Siva there, he has to hold his run again.\n8:46 Comment: And when it finally comes, he is, he's offside.\n8:50 Comment: Doesn't need to be, because he's quicker than Huth has shown before.\n8:55 Comment: Well, they're playing with fire, Leicester defending as high up the pitch as they are.\n8:59 Comment: They don't have enough pace to do that.\n9:2 Comment: If they continue to do that, somebody will break that line\n9:6 Comment: and they'll come through from midfield, because as I've mentioned,\n9:9 Comment: there's plenty of bodies coming from deep.\n9:11 Comment: Some will make that run and penetrate that back four.\n9:15 Comment: Leicester haven't kept a clean sheet in the Premier League\n9:18 Comment: since October 2nd against Southampton.\n9:25 Comment: Here we go.\n9:27 Comment: Here's the first one.\n9:29 Comment: It's by Raheem Sterling.\n9:34 Comment: All Brighton.\n9:36 Comment: A nice angle put by that one.\n9:39 Comment: It's Andy King.\n9:41 Comment: Chipped up.\n9:43 Comment: Navas attacking it.\n9:45 Comment: And Navas there was protesting vehemently,\n9:48 Comment: he didn't get the last touch on that.\n9:50 Comment: Michael Oliver says he did.\n9:52 Comment: I think he was right, it's a good defensive header by Navas,\n9:56 Comment: and it comes off Marles, I think.\n10:0 Comment: It looks like it.\n10:9 Comment: Here you go.\n10:10 Comment: Clear as day.\n10:12 Comment: Comes off Marles.\n10:13 Comment: His was the last touch, wasn't it?\n10:15 Comment: So it should have been a goal kick.\n10:17 Comment: Yeah, it was a big decision.\n10:19 Comment: They were arguing at a point there.\n10:22 Comment: I could tell by the players' reaction\n10:24 Comment: there were enough of them making the point.\n10:26 Comment: He wasn't one of those half-hearted,\n10:28 Comment: give us this one, Ref.\n10:30 Comment: As it is, the corner is given, here it comes.\n10:35 Comment: It's only a body to weigh in, that was Martins' effort.\n10:37 Comment: He hasn't scored for Leicester City yet.\n10:43 Comment: Here's Raheem Sterling, over the knee injury\n10:46 Comment: he suffered in that fearful collision with Burnley's Ben May recently.\n10:52 Comment: It's only wanted a lot of time,\n10:54 Comment: Slomani wasn't prepared to give him it.\n10:57 Comment: He couldn't do anything, he got himself in a bother there.\n10:59 Comment: To be fair to him, he did rescue it.\n11:4 Comment: Oops with the header.\n11:6 Comment: Much more drive and determination about Leicester City,\n11:10 Comment: much more of the old fight we saw last season,\n11:13 Comment: that's what Claudio Ranieri was calling for,\n11:15 Comment: a guy who's been in the game for a long time,\n11:17 Comment: and he's got to be a bit more determined.\n11:19 Comment: Claudio Ranieri was calling for a game.\n11:22 Comment: He'd love to play with fire back there,\n11:24 Comment: although Pep Guardiola would have other descriptions of it.\n11:30 Comment: Here's De Bruyne.\n11:33 Comment: Zabaleta, can he slide a good ball in here?\n11:36 Comment: Silva, De Bruyne, Iheanacho,\n11:40 Comment: laid back, Gundogan, tried to pass it in almost,\n11:43 Comment: but not quite.\n11:45 Comment: His reaction says it all.\n11:48 Comment: He certainly should have got it on target,\n11:50 Comment: he picks up a really nice position,\n11:52 Comment: you see him creeping into the box.\n11:54 Comment: Finally comes some...\n11:57 Comment: The man of his quality should have done better.\n12:0 Comment: He's trying to feed it into that far corner.\n12:4 Comment: He does know his way to goal as well,\n12:6 Comment: you might remember he scored two in the win over Barcelona,\n12:9 Comment: and the Champions League, good goal-scoring year for Gundogan.\n12:13 Comment: Yaya Touré coming on as well here,\n12:16 Comment: Chávez is coming on.\n12:23 Comment: Touré to replace Iheanacho.\n12:26 Comment: It's an interesting one.\n12:38 Comment: So they've taken off the leader of the line,\n12:41 Comment: as it were, in Iheanacho, so...\n12:44 Comment: How will they play this now?\n12:46 Comment: They've got three at the back.\n12:49 Comment: Seven in the middle of the field.\n12:52 Comment: I don't know who's going to play up front,\n12:53 Comment: it looks like Yaya's going to stand up there.\n12:56 Comment: He ended the game against Burnley recently,\n12:58 Comment: as the man playing furthest forward.\n13:3 Comment: And Stern's first involvement, it goes down under King's challenge.\n13:10 Comment: And King was determined to welcome him to the game there.\n13:17 Comment: Riyad Mahrez picked up a booking for delaying the restart,\n13:22 Comment: we can confirm in all of that.\n13:34 Comment: Here's De Bruyne.\n13:37 Comment: Here's the other scorers from the matches played earlier on.\n13:39 Comment: Lots of goals around the back,\n13:41 Comment: Arsenal puts them top of the table on goal-line.\n13:44 Comment: Arsenal puts them top of the table on goals scored above Chelsea,\n13:47 Comment: for the time being.\n13:48 Comment: Great win for Burnley at home against Bournemouth.\n13:51 Comment: Crystal Palace in another multi-goal thriller,\n13:54 Comment: and Swansea much needed them for that, with a Sunderland.\n13:58 Comment: Here's Zabaleta for Manchester City.\n14:4 Comment: Kolarov.\n14:8 Comment: Sterling.\n14:10 Comment: Fitch with the header away for Leicester City.\n14:16 Comment: Leicester haven't beaten Manchester City at home since 1988 in the league,\n14:22 Comment: when David Cleat was the manager and Gary McAllister was in the Leicester team back then.\n14:28 Comment: It was before all his heroics and title-winning leads.\n14:39 Comment: To John Stones, who was here the day Leicester were crowned champions,\n14:48 Comment: with Everton last season.\n14:51 Comment: It's his last visit.\n14:56 Comment: Sterling.\n14:59 Comment: He's got the job of creating some havoc down that side.\n15:9 Comment: Fitch with a great header away there.\n15:12 Comment: And it comes to Silva.\n15:18 Comment: Back-halfing out, gets that one away.\n15:25 Comment: Sterling.\n15:27 Comment: He's got the job of creating some havoc down that side.\n15:31 Comment: It's his last visit.\n15:33 Comment: He's got the job of creating some havoc down that side.\n15:37 Comment: Sterling.\n15:39 Comment: Leicester's view of this very much now, what we have, we hold.\n15:44 Comment: And anything else we can get on the break, we'll take that too.\n15:47 Comment: Vardy's gone down with a little injury, Michael Overlove is not around to do that.\n15:51 Comment: City certainly don't have to stop the game for it.\n15:53 Comment: It's Yaya Toure.\n15:57 Comment: Kimpeleta.\n16:4 Comment: Manchester City in need of goals, they've been rattling them in away from home most of the season.\n16:10 Comment: Twos and threes and fours.\n16:14 Comment: Zabaleta cutting inside, on his left foot, what can he do?\n16:18 Comment: It's bending, but not enough.\n16:20 Comment: Took to the collection.\n16:23 Comment: I think it was Andy King who got the final touch, actually it was a good touch.\n16:26 Comment: Let's see.\n16:28 Comment: Yeah, Andy King gets a...\n16:31 Comment: ...puts a foot onto it.\n16:36 Comment: And slants down again.\n16:39 Comment: Kolarov picks it up, Leicester City...\n16:43 Comment: ...pinned back in their own penalty area here.\n16:49 Comment: Dubrojnik to play this one in, and it's well had in the end by Ron-Robert Sela.\n16:54 Comment: Determined to keep a clean sheet.\n16:57 Comment: Again it was a nice ball by Dubrojnik.\n17:0 Comment: Just evaded Fernando.\n17:7 Comment: Shimane on the chase, a difficult bounce for Sane, but he was cooling off there.\n17:27 Comment: Hardy beat New Year, here comes Slimani again.\n17:34 Comment: It's gonna go on and on, and Hardy nearly managed to find a fourth goal for Leicester City there.\n17:41 Comment: How easy was that? Gunderman doesn't make a challenge, and look at Kolarov here.\n17:46 Comment: Just waltzes around him.\n17:49 Comment: Should have done better, Slimani, with his left foot there.\n17:51 Comment: Some of the Manchester City fans watching this are thinking it's just a bit too easy against our defence.\n17:58 Comment: That's what they must be thinking.\n18:0 Comment: And that certainly has been the case here. There are issues to address, there's no sugar-coating that.\n18:7 Comment: Kolarov.\n18:14 Comment: Sterling trying to run Simpson, who's not having it.\n18:17 Comment: That's good positive play by Raheem Sterling.\n18:26 Comment: Dubbing out all the issues from today's games, lots of goals discussed tonight.\n18:30 Comment: Premier League tonight at 8pm, beating Sport 1 HD.\n18:33 Comment: Good show, well worth tuning in for.\n18:36 Comment: Might be a fair bit of discussion about what's going on here as well.\n18:49 Comment: Kolarov.\n18:52 Comment: The game being played almost exclusively in this half of the pitch now.\n18:56 Comment: Silver.\n18:59 Comment: Bent to Sterling, who couldn't control it.\n19:6 Comment: Just looking at the movement of Torre, he's constantly pulling to the ball.\n19:11 Comment: That's because he's not a recognised centre-forward.\n19:14 Comment: One thing with Pep Guardiola is he's not predictable, is he?\n19:16 Comment: Our kind of player, he's not predictable.\n19:19 Comment: He's got a bit of a bit of a knack for it.\n19:21 Comment: He's not a recognised centre-forward.\n19:23 Comment: One thing with Pep Guardiola is he's not predictable, is he?\n19:25 Comment: I can't think of a coach or a manager in the Premier League\n19:29 Comment: with half an hour to go and your team are losing 3-0,\n19:32 Comment: who pull off your only central striker in the team.\n19:36 Comment: Took off Ian Atcher, who incidentally,\n19:39 Comment: over the last one and a half seasons, in terms of minutes per goal,\n19:42 Comment: is top of all the regular scorers in the Premier League.\n19:48 Comment: Even ahead of his team-mate Aguero,\n19:50 Comment: because he plays a whole lot less often.\n20:9 Comment: No comments.\n20:10 Comment: Manchester City do have to get this sorted out,\n20:13 Comment: because the suspension of those key players will go on for a little while.\n20:19 Comment: Of course, next Sunday they have to play Arsenal at home.\n20:24 Comment: Slimane.\n20:26 Comment: Vardy.\n20:28 Comment: Stam Stone's son as well.\n20:31 Comment: He's in really well, Jamie Vardy.\n20:33 Comment: A lot of the time off the ball, his movement has been brilliant.\n20:36 Comment: Always looking for the ball,\n20:38 Comment: this is an opportunity, but all throughout the game he's been on the line,\n20:42 Comment: keeping himself onside, but closing the Man City defence,\n20:45 Comment: there's all kinds of problems.\n20:55 Comment: Slimane with the header back, it's harmless in the end.\n20:58 Comment: Going back on your point, I think Jamie Vardy's heard a lot of the criticism\n21:2 Comment: that's come his way about his work rate dropping,\n21:5 Comment: and maybe him resting on his laurels a bit.\n21:8 Comment: Probably he's been quietly seething,\n21:10 Comment: but he's maybe determined to go out and do something about it.\n21:13 Comment: Vardy's been excellent here this afternoon,\n21:15 Comment: but he hasn't had to search for the space.\n21:18 Comment: It's been given to him, it's there.\n21:27 Comment: One more, he'll get his first Leicester City hat-trick.\n21:36 Comment: Silva.\n21:38 Comment: Nicely cut out.\n21:40 Comment: Simpson fancies his chances coming forward,\n21:43 Comment: he's taken out of it, and it will be not only a free kick,\n21:47 Comment: but a yellow card as well for Fernando.\n21:50 Comment: I don't know whether he got the ball there, Fernando.\n21:53 Comment: I thought it was OK.\n21:55 Comment: Let's have a look.\n21:57 Comment: He gets up a little bit on the balls, doesn't he?\n22:0 Comment: There, yeah.\n22:3 Comment: It's the man after.\n22:5 Comment: I think he was unfortunate there, a couple of yellow cards.\n22:10 Comment: Third of the season for him.\n22:12 Comment: By the way, the amnesty kicks in on New Year's Eve for the five yellows.\n22:16 Comment: They don't disappear, they just carry on,\n22:18 Comment: and if you get ten, you get a two-game ban later on.\n22:21 Comment: Nolito.\n22:23 Comment: That's a bit good to have today.\n22:25 Comment: In there, such a star for Jurgen Klopp at Borussia Dortmund.\n22:31 Comment: And Nolito comes on the 30-year-old Spaniard.\n22:37 Comment: He's got to play it in the centre-forward area.\n22:48 Comment: Morgan.\n22:49 Comment: Still 3-0, as it's been since the 20th minute of the game.\n22:55 Comment: You're just coming home from a match and a late tuning in.\n22:58 Comment: Leicester were two up in four and a half minutes here.\n23:7 Comment: Alexander Kolarov.\n23:11 Comment: It's Yaya Toure.\n23:14 Comment: Sitting deeper now, it would seem.\n23:17 Comment: Looks like Nolito's gone to play up front there.\n23:21 Comment: Where they had Ian Nacho in the first place.\n23:27 Comment: Sterling.\n23:36 Comment: As Trevor said before, Ian, everybody wants to come towards the ball.\n23:39 Comment: You see them all walking towards the ball, all of them.\n23:43 Comment: Zabaleta here for Manchester City.\n23:45 Comment: Almost like a training game in this half of the field.\n23:49 Comment: See if you can break them down.\n23:51 Comment: It's nice and comfortable at the moment for Leicester.\n23:54 Comment: The city are not moving the ball quick enough.\n23:57 Comment: Sterling just ran into trouble in the end.\n23:59 Comment: Blue shirts everywhere, congesting the space.\n24:2 Comment: It's a bit of a problem for Leicester.\n24:4 Comment: They've got a bit of a problem with the ball.\n24:8 Comment: Just ran into trouble in the end.\n24:9 Comment: Blue shirts everywhere, congesting the space.\n24:12 Comment: And looking to counter.\n24:14 Comment: Slimane on the top.\n24:15 Comment: Was that handball by Stones?\n24:16 Comment: Slimane thought so, and so did one or two others.\n24:19 Comment: The assistant, Ian, was a couple of yards away from them,\n24:22 Comment: so you would presume it wasn't.\n24:28 Comment: Everybody wants to come centrally, he's very, very congested in the middle of that park.\n24:32 Comment: If anything, you want Raheem Sterling and Zabaleta to stay nice and wide\n24:35 Comment: and keep the pitch as big as possible to create more space.\n24:42 Comment: Leicester City are looking for things from their wide men here.\n24:49 Comment: Silva, if anyone's got the key to the door, it might be him.\n24:52 Comment: Yaya Torres looking for a one-two.\n24:54 Comment: A ferocious challenge came in from Hoop there.\n25:5 Comment: David Silva.\n25:7 Comment: Kolarov's going to have to work to keep that in play, he does so.\n25:15 Comment: Silva.\n25:18 Comment: Kolarov fizzing it across the face of goal.\n25:21 Comment: A Tonoa veil, they're not really testing Silva that much.\n25:24 Comment: Look how many Manchester City players in the danger area when this ball comes in.\n25:28 Comment: Nolito, that is a goal.\n25:30 Comment: Oh, he did miss it, the assistance.\n25:32 Comment: That was handball, that's deliberate handball.\n25:35 Comment: Yeah, it was.\n25:37 Comment: The assistance is just there out of shot, how he missed it.\n25:42 Comment: Got away with one-one there, John Stones, Jake Colling near Fischer and Watson.\n25:52 Comment: And it's a goal.\n25:55 Comment: Come on, come on.\n26:9 Comment: Bit of a comeback concert for Leicester City so far,\n26:12 Comment: and looking forward to the draw for the Champions League on Monday,\n26:16 Comment: when it's possible they could draw Real Madrid or Bayern Munich.\n26:20 Comment: 40% chance of pulling one of those two out of the hat.\n26:25 Comment: Oh, that would be brilliant, wouldn't it?\n26:28 Comment: That would be brilliant for Leicester and the fans,\n26:30 Comment: to play at one of those iconic stadiums.\n26:37 Comment: They could get Paris Saint-Germain, Sevilla or Bayern Leverkusen.\n26:40 Comment: Of course Manchester City in the hat as well.\n26:45 Comment: See that draw with us...\n26:48 Comment: Monday morning.\n26:50 Comment: Sterling again here.\n26:54 Comment: Toure, looking to measure one for Zabaleta.\n26:58 Comment: It's not quite happening for Manchester City, is it?\n27:1 Comment: No, they're not making chances, are they?\n27:3 Comment: Trav's not making chances at all.\n27:4 Comment: I can't understand why Zabaleta is playing as high up the field as he is on the right-hand side,\n27:10 Comment: when you've got so many natural wide players in the team.\n27:13 Comment: De Bruyne's playing central, Silva's playing central.\n27:18 Comment: You've got Raheem Sterling on the left,\n27:20 Comment: wants to come inside the pitch onto his right foot and into that congested area.\n27:24 Comment: I don't know whether it's best if Raheem comes out on the wide right\n27:27 Comment: and Nero Isano, somebody, wide left,\n27:30 Comment: and just make the pitch big, because there's nothing to lose now.\n27:37 Comment: Mahrez.\n27:38 Comment: There you go, look at that, on target, zero for Manchester City, that's incredible.\n27:44 Comment: For a team with this amount of attacking options.\n28:1 Comment: Claudio Ranieri, by the way, has a great record playing against Manchester City.\n28:6 Comment: He's never lost in eight meetings in the Premier League.\n28:9 Comment: He's won seven of them, the other was the draw here last season.\n28:27 Comment: If it stays 3-0 for a clean sheet, is there any chance of him buying pizzas for the team next week?\n28:33 Comment: Is that finished now?\n28:34 Comment: I think that might be finished, yeah, that was last year's in second.\n28:37 Comment: Let's not make a mistake here and give it to Raheem Sterling.\n28:42 Comment: It's De Bruyne this time, cutting inside, twisting, turning,\n28:45 Comment: trying to find the right ball for Nolito.\n28:50 Comment: Pizza's certainly out of Manchester City, I'm told it's been replaced by mixed nuts\n28:55 Comment: by Pep Guardiola this season after games.\n28:58 Comment: There you go.\n29:0 Comment: There's a bit of information for you there.\n29:3 Comment: Amazing what you find out, you know.\n29:5 Comment: It's a letter.\n29:9 Comment: Yair Tori did get a couple, didn't he, at Crystal Palace on a storybook return.\n29:21 Comment: Premier League matches coming up.\n29:24 Comment: Chelsea against West Bromwich, that's a noon kick-off,\n29:26 Comment: make a date with us from 11.30 tomorrow for that one.\n29:30 Comment: And there are midweek games to look forward to as well.\n29:32 Comment: Arsenal going to Goodison Park on Tuesday.\n29:35 Comment: On Wednesday it'll be Manchester United's visit to Crystal Palace.\n29:41 Comment: And in this slot next week we're at the Hawthorns for West Bromwich\n29:45 Comment: against Manchester United.\n29:54 Comment: Picked up by Jamie Vardy.\n30:3 Comment: City work hard to get the ball back.\n30:13 Comment: Manchester City will be in action themselves in midweek.\n30:16 Comment: At home to Watford before that big Arsenal clash,\n30:19 Comment: and of course at the end of the month they've got Liverpool as well.\n30:23 Comment: This is maybe a decisive December for Manchester City.\n30:27 Comment: It's not starting very well in this particular picture.\n31:2 Comment: It's De Bruyne.\n31:8 Comment: Yet another misunderstanding, and we've said that a fair few times today,\n31:12 Comment: this time between Sane and Zabaleta.\n31:15 Comment: Sane winning the header this time as well.\n31:22 Comment: Sturling.\n31:25 Comment: Free kick to Manchester City, but there have been times today\n31:28 Comment: when Manchester City have indeed looked like characters in search of a plot.\n31:36 Comment: Look at Claudio Ranieri there.\n31:39 Comment: Giving a big talk to Rafa Zaghi and Slimane, who will make way.\n31:45 Comment: And the fans have enjoyed his contribution,\n31:47 Comment: even if there was no goal to crown it with on this occasion.\n31:51 Comment: He's got five since he signed, and all of them have scored in this stadium.\n31:56 Comment: He played his part in the first goal, didn't he?\n31:59 Comment: Putting Jamie Vardy through, nice quick pass.\n32:11 Comment: Okazaki, who's been named as the Asian Player of the Year.\n32:16 Comment: Very nice, congratulations to him.\n32:19 Comment: He's been a splendid servant since arriving at Manchester City,\n32:23 Comment: he was a key player in the title win.\n32:28 Comment: Maybe an unsung player.\n32:31 Comment: Absolutely.\n32:33 Comment: Here's Mahrez.\n32:35 Comment: Polarov trying to get back to the stones, he's going to be able to cut this one out.\n32:39 Comment: Oh, it's a ball, ball from Stone, Vardy!\n32:44 Comment: Did it cross the line?\n32:46 Comment: Did it cross the line? Yes, it did!\n32:51 Comment: The referee got the buzzer on his watch.\n32:54 Comment: Terrible mistake by John Stones, and Jamie Vardy has a hat-trick.\n33:1 Comment: Nightmare for him.\n33:6 Comment: It looked impossible to finish it from that angle, but Vardy did.\n33:10 Comment: It was an incredible finish, Ian, it was.\n33:13 Comment: There wasn't much to aim at, and he's anticipating Stone doing this,\n33:16 Comment: because he knows what type of player he is, it's a poor ball.\n33:21 Comment: Oh, there it is, there it is, he knows Jamie Vardy.\n33:25 Comment: He's got his hands in the air as he's celebrating behind the goal.\n33:30 Comment: Very nice.\n33:31 Comment: He gets his hat-trick, it's a well-deserved hat-trick.\n33:38 Comment: It's over the line.\n33:39 Comment: Let me tell you, that's the first hat-trick Jamie Vardy has scored\n33:42 Comment: since getting one for Fleetwood against Emsfleet in the conference in 2012,\n33:48 Comment: in front of 1,411 spectators.\n33:54 Comment: What a day for him, but I'm afraid that goal rather sums it up\n33:58 Comment: the way it's been for Manchester City today, a catalogue of chaos and errors.\n34:3 Comment: I think we really saw the benefit there of goal-line technology,\n34:6 Comment: because I think without it, possibly Jamie Vardy would not have been given\n34:10 Comment: that goal in the hat-trick, but it was the correct decision, of course,\n34:14 Comment: and the goal, I think it was taken brilliantly.\n34:17 Comment: He needed the post to score, it was such a difficult angle.\n34:23 Comment: It was, in its way, a sensational finish for Vardy.\n34:28 Comment: It was a bit like a football match,\n34:30 Comment: it was a bit like the reek he finished last week,\n34:34 Comment: the Liverpool ball, but he had to go through a very small space\n34:38 Comment: to get it in the back of the net, and he executed it perfectly.\n34:42 Comment: It was almost the work of a precision engineer, wasn't it?\n34:46 Comment: Very well done to Jamie Vardy, well-deserved hat-trick.\n34:49 Comment: As I said, off-camera, his work rate and his movement\n34:53 Comment: has been fantastic tonight, he deserves it.\n34:56 Comment: Listen to the noise around the King Power Stadium,\n34:59 Comment: now, feels like last May again.\n35:6 Comment: Remember, Leicester started the day only one point above the drop zone,\n35:10 Comment: with lots of worries and anxieties.\n35:19 Comment: Grab a letter.\n35:23 Comment: Silver.\n35:25 Comment: Torrey to lay it off, and there's a foul there,\n35:29 Comment: will be a free kick on the edge of the box here, for Manchester City.\n35:32 Comment: It's starting to be a bit of a worry, Trevor, isn't it?\n35:34 Comment: He concedes a 3 to Chelsea, 4 today.\n35:40 Comment: I spoke about the imbalance of the squad, Steve,\n35:42 Comment: not enough defenders, not enough good defenders.\n35:45 Comment: There's also a problem in the central striking area,\n35:48 Comment: because quite clearly, the manager doesn't fancy you're natural.\n35:53 Comment: If a player's not available, he's got a huge problem.\n35:56 Comment: If you saw then, Silver came inside, looked to play off the front man,\n36:0 Comment: and there wasn't anybody central.\n36:4 Comment: Free kick, here's a lovely angle for Kolarov's left foot,\n36:6 Comment: if he's the one who's going to hit it.\n36:11 Comment: De Bruyne wants it as well, though.\n36:16 Comment: Oh, and it's beautifully done by Kolarov.\n36:19 Comment: Magnificent free kick from him, 4-1,\n36:22 Comment: but surely too late for Manchester City now, you'd think anyway.\n36:27 Comment: Perfect angle, as you rightly said, Ian.\n36:29 Comment: Whips it in, doesn't he?\n36:31 Comment: Goalie, no chance.\n36:35 Comment: Up and down, good movement on it.\n36:38 Comment: Another five goals to celebrate today.\n36:44 Comment: Lovely technique from Kolarov,\n36:46 Comment: we know he's capable of doing things like that.\n36:48 Comment: They've been able to create very few chances in open play,\n36:53 Comment: but he really is an expert when it comes to set-pieces, as we saw then.\n36:58 Comment: He's scored before against Leicester,\n37:1 Comment: in the FAN League Cup, that sort of thing, before.\n37:4 Comment: And here's one in the Premier League as well,\n37:6 Comment: for Alexander Kolarov, his first of the season, by the way.\n37:10 Comment: Yeah, he just got it up and over Margo right in his head,\n37:13 Comment: and he was arguably the smallest person in the world.\n37:25 Comment: That's the man who'll be making the headlines, not for the first time.\n37:33 Comment: Vardy's on the chase here, Stones with the header away,\n37:36 Comment: not a good one from him.\n37:39 Comment: Okazaki making a nuisance of himself.\n37:42 Comment: And it'll be a free kick for Zabaleta,\n37:44 Comment: which was fouled by the Japanese international.\n37:54 Comment: A very satisfying day for him.\n37:58 Comment: Yeah, he was really upset midweek with the performance in Porto\n38:1 Comment: by his sort of second-string players.\n38:5 Comment: But actually he's been proved, to a certain extent,\n38:8 Comment: correct to rest all those players,\n38:10 Comment: the team have put in a really good shift today.\n38:16 Comment: And you'll want to see that continued as well,\n38:18 Comment: down at Bournemouth in midweek.\n38:23 Comment: After that, Leicester have got Stoke away,\n38:26 Comment: Everton at home, West Ham at home.\n38:28 Comment: Coming up, all fixtures where they'll feel they can get something\n38:32 Comment: to climb the table.\n38:35 Comment: Mahrez, working back.\n38:44 Comment: De Bruyne.\n38:46 Comment: Neither him nor David Silva have really been able to be the kind of influence\n38:49 Comment: Manchester City would have wanted in this second half.\n38:52 Comment: Here is Silva, Zabaleta,\n38:55 Comment: cuts that back and there you have it.\n38:57 Comment: Straight at the goalkeeper.\n39:0 Comment: Not gonna be a problem.\n39:3 Comment: Yeah, took a little deflection off one of the Leicester defenders.\n39:6 Comment: Nice by Zabaleta, picks up the lead,\n39:9 Comment: just not enough power just off Westmoreland.\n39:21 Comment: Here's Yaya Torre, quick feet from him.\n39:26 Comment: He's back in the fold now, if not in the Champions League squad.\n39:30 Comment: Whether he gets into it,\n39:32 Comment: the squad's reorganised in the new year for the knockout stages,\n39:35 Comment: we shall see.\n39:37 Comment: Pep Guardiola is happier with his state of fitness and his weight now.\n39:43 Comment: Fernando with the cross-court ball,\n39:45 Comment: Sterling against the odds, won the header.\n39:54 Comment: Not many people going into this game,\n39:57 Comment: not all him, would have expected this scoreline.\n40:3 Comment: I think we all knew it was going to be a difficult game today, didn't we?\n40:6 Comment: For Manchester City.\n40:8 Comment: I don't think anybody, even the most ardent Leicester fan,\n40:12 Comment: expected a scoreline like this at the start of the game.\n40:18 Comment: I think he's gonna get the treatment here, Jamie Vardy,\n40:21 Comment: the old ploy with the manager,\n40:23 Comment: building his confidence even further by taking him off early\n40:26 Comment: so he can get the big standing ovation.\n40:29 Comment: I think that's the plan of Claudio Ranieri anyway.\n40:39 Comment: It's going to be 12 points out of 27 for Manchester City.\n40:46 Comment: And that, of course, after they started the season\n40:49 Comment: winning their first six Premier League games.\n40:56 Comment: Zabaleta.\n41:0 Comment: Chelsea win tomorrow, Man City will be seven points adrift of them.\n41:5 Comment: That's not a given, though, as West Brom are playing well at the moment.\n41:8 Comment: They go to Stamford Bridge tomorrow and Tony Poulis will arrive with a plan.\n41:15 Comment: Silva to take this one.\n41:17 Comment: Toka Zakia won the header there.\n41:21 Comment: Hector Sterling, who celebrated his 22nd birthday this week,\n41:25 Comment: the England winger, had a bit of frustration, I fancy, there from him.\n41:45 Comment: Well, here's that substitution we were talking about.\n41:51 Comment: And the whole of the King Power Stadium,\n41:53 Comment: well, at least the ones wearing Leicester City scarves and shirts anyway,\n41:57 Comment: rises to him.\n41:58 Comment: His first hat-trick for Leicester,\n42:0 Comment: and his first hat-trick since his days with Fleetwood in the Conference.\n42:6 Comment: That was a really nice hat-trick as well.\n42:8 Comment: Those first two goals were quite easy for him,\n42:11 Comment: but that one was really difficult, as Trevor said,\n42:14 Comment: he perfectly plays, they had to come off the post to get the angle to bounce in.\n42:19 Comment: That's what Vardy always thinks.\n42:24 Comment: Demarai Gray, a former Birmingham youngster,\n42:27 Comment: to replace Vardy late on in the piece here.\n42:35 Comment: The game Leicester City took a stranglehold of within the first five minutes.\n42:41 Comment: What does this all mean for Manchester City?\n42:44 Comment: I've got wiser people than me standing either side of me, what do you think?\n42:51 Comment: Firstly, for me, it's easy to say after a 4-1 drubbing like this\n42:55 Comment: that he needs to sort out the defensive area.\n42:58 Comment: I still think a lot of the players have no idea where to play and how to play.\n43:4 Comment: I think that baffles us, and I think it's a bit of a shame,\n43:8 Comment: but I think that baffles a lot of them, it really does.\n43:11 Comment: They've still got the best squad, they'll probably invest in January,\n43:15 Comment: so Manchester City will be fine, but they're gonna have to sort out this problem.\n43:19 Comment: I agree, Steve, I think he's gotta settle on what he wants to do,\n43:22 Comment: whether it's gonna be a three or a back four,\n43:25 Comment: and stick with it for a few games, and allow players to get familiar with what he wants,\n43:29 Comment: to try and get some kind of understanding between the players,\n43:33 Comment: because at the moment they look lost.\n43:38 Comment: It's been a difficult day for De Bruyne, for Manchester City and their supporters.\n43:44 Comment: You've been in the top two in four of the last five seasons, won two titles in that time.\n43:50 Comment: Pep Guardiola, to be fair to him, did say when he arrived,\n43:53 Comment: this could be my biggest challenge, it may not be that I'm successful straight away.\n43:59 Comment: It's only a difficult phase just at the moment, you feel, for Manchester City.\n44:4 Comment: Having lost against Chelsea last week,\n44:7 Comment: a game they feel they probably did enough to win,\n44:10 Comment: or be in control of when Chelsea hit them with the three goals.\n44:15 Comment: Leicester this time giving it away at Marte, it was, and here's Sterling.\n44:21 Comment: Collar off the goal scorer, and he's got it.\n44:25 Comment: Collar off the goal scorer to De Bruyne.\n44:31 Comment: Collar off again, and Nolito makes it 4-2.\n44:34 Comment: Clever finish from the Spaniard, to put a more respectable gloss on it than Manchester City.\n44:40 Comment: Yeah, much better, wasn't it, round the sides again.\n44:44 Comment: Collar off, who's had a strange type of game defensively,\n44:48 Comment: shows us worth going forward again, makes a nice run, fizzes it in.\n44:54 Comment: Nolito's there to stick in the back of the net.\n44:59 Comment: Good finish from the Spanish international,\n45:2 Comment: who hasn't scored since his 30th birthday goal against Everton two months ago.\n45:13 Comment: Four minutes of added time, what if Manchester City scored another one in the next few seconds?\n45:18 Comment: I hope so.\n45:21 Comment: You're not allowed to say that, you're supposed to be a neutral.\n45:24 Comment: No, I am neutral, it just makes it an exciting last few minutes, that's what I mean.\n45:28 Comment: Got a neutral from Visperolat.\n45:31 Comment: So good to play this towards Nolito.\n45:36 Comment: Sterling cuts it back, Leicester making a nuisance of this,\n45:40 Comment: and they're really making a mess of things at the back just for a moment,\n45:44 Comment: I think they switched off late on here, Nolito is in there again.\n45:48 Comment: Yeah, and it was also reminiscent of the second goal,\n45:51 Comment: fizzed in this time by Raheem Sterling,\n45:53 Comment: and Nolito nearly sticks in the back of the net again.\n45:56 Comment: Just fading away at the far post.\n46:0 Comment: Off comes Christian Fuchs now.\n46:11 Comment: It doesn't seem as if he wants to go off, he does not want to go off.\n46:14 Comment: It's Márez I think who's gone off.\n46:19 Comment: A bit of a change of mind there.\n46:26 Comment: On comes Matty James, who was a big part of the Leicester team,\n46:30 Comment: who got promoted, nice midfield play,\n46:33 Comment: who's had a nightmare with injury, one and a half years.\n46:37 Comment: Cruise ship problems.\n46:38 Comment: Oh, yeah, great to see him back.\n46:42 Comment: He's getting his own chant from the Leicester fans as well,\n46:45 Comment: who haven't forgotten him.\n46:47 Comment: Big moment really,\n46:49 Comment: has made the bench before a couple of weeks ago,\n46:51 Comment: but now he's back on the pitch, if only for a minute or two.\n46:54 Comment: Okazaki will get a yellow.\n47:3 Comment: Here's white.\n47:4 Comment: Yellow.\n47:14 Comment: De Bruyne for Manchester City.\n47:24 Comment: Stones.\n47:29 Comment: Silva trying to measure it.\n47:32 Comment: And Andy King,\n47:34 Comment: comes away with the ball.\n47:35 Comment: And we'll have Danny Drinkwater back in midweek,\n47:37 Comment: Leicester in that midfield after his suspension

    "summary": "In an electrifying fixture at King Power Stadium, Leicester City hosted Manchester City in what turned out to be a thrilling encounter. With an overcast sky and a greasy pitch, the contest began with both teams aiming to gain an early upper hand. Leicester, desperate for points as they found themselves perilously close to the relegation zone, faced a Manchester City side burdened with key absentees, including the likes of Fernandinho and Sergio Agüero.\n\nManchester City commenced the first half with a tactical setup that looked experimental. Their intention was clear as they oscillated between a back-three and a back-four formation in the opening minutes. This strategy, however, would soon come under scrutiny. Much to the crowd's delight and Pep Guardiola's frustration, Leicester pounced right from the off. Jamie Vardy, who had endured a goal drought spanning 16 games, broke the deadlock in impressive fashion. \n\nRiyad Mahrez, one of Leicester’s standout performers, showcased sublime skill as he deftly touched the ball to Islam Slimani who, with a simple yet precise pass, set Jamie Vardy on his way. Vardy, showing the predatory instincts that defined his previous season, slotted the ball past Claudio Bravo, sending the home crowd into raptures. This early goal, erupting in the third minute, marked the beginning of Manchester City's troubles.\n\nLeicester didn't take their foot off the gas. Only moments later, the stadium exploded again as Andy King doubled the lead. Stemming from a chaotic long throw-in by Christian Fuchs, the ball fell invitingly to King, who unleashed a powerful strike. Bravo managed a touch, but it wasn't enough to deny Leicester their second. In the span of five chaotic minutes, Manchester City were in utter disarray, trailing by two goals to none.\n\nDespite the shock, City attempted to wrest control of the game. Their midfield, with Fernando and Kevin De Bruyne pulling the strings, tried to stitch together meaningful play, but they constantly fell prey to Leicester’s quick counters. Vardy and Slimani's dynamic link-up play, supported by the industrious Mahrez, exemplified the foxes' intent. \n\nJust as Manchester City were getting a foothold, another error from their backline gifted Leicester a third goal. A misplaced clearance allowed Vardy to be played through once again, courtesy of Mahrez's elegant touch. Vardy, radiating confidence, dispatched the chance with clinical precision. Guardiola cut a perplexed figure on the sidelines, his team trailing 3-0 just 20 minutes into the match.\n\nManchester City, famed for their attacking prowess, found themselves shell-shocked and unable to break through Leicester's resolute defense marshaled by Wes Morgan and Robert Huth. Their half-hearted attempts at goal were either blocked or narrowly missed, failing to trouble the substitute goalkeeper, Ron-Robert Zieler, significantly.\n\nAfter a dramatic and highly charged first half, the halftime whistle offered City a much-needed respite. It was clear that Guardiola had to work miracles in the dressing room to resuscitate his team's fading hopes.\n\nThe second half saw slight tactical adjustments from City, but Leicester’s momentum continued to dictate proceedings. The greasy pitch conditions, courtesy of the heavens, did no favors for City’s slick passing game. Despite some spells of possession and territorial advantage, City's offensive forays floundered repeatedly on Leicester’s defensive rock.\n\nKnowing they had a comfortable cushion, Leicester chose to sit back, defend deep, and strike on the counter. Every time City launched forward and probed to find an opening, Leicester stood firm and reverted to pressing sharply on the transitional play.\n\nJamie Vardy, undoubtedly the star of the show, completed his spectacular hat-trick after capitalizing on a calamitous mistake from John Stones. Stones, lingering with the ball in a critical area, gifted it to Vardy who finished from an improbable angle, ensuring that the ball crossed the line and before any intervention. The goal, confirmed by goal-line technology, worldwide marked the emotional peak of the game, symbolising how far Leicester's hero had returned to his best.\n\nThrough the match, City's errors were glaring, and their defensive frailties highlighted their ongoing struggle with consistency at the back. They effectively missed key defenders and players equally adept at managing midfield dynamics and protecting the backline.\n\nCity managed to pull one back through an expertly executed free-kick by Aleksandar Kolarov, finding the top corner with precision. However, by then, the damage was irreparable. The goal only served as some consolation for their efforts.\n\nLeicester's day grew sweeter when second-half substitute Demarai Gray combined well into Leicester's counter-attacks to further pressurize City’s wobbly defense, although no additional goals stemmed from these forays.\n\nNearing the end of the game, City made another tactical gamble bringing on experienced players like Yaya Touré, who provided both presence and technical acumen in advanced positions, but it was too late for any significant comeback. As City scrambled and fumbled to claw back into the match, the clock worked against them. Despite their huffing and puffing, City could only manage to create limited chances, all stifled by Leicester's watertight defense and rugged determination.\n\nAnother late goal from Nolito after deft interplay between Kolarov and Sterling offered some redemption for the City attack, but it was, ultimately, a case of too much too late. City’s spirited fightback was unlikely to yield a comeback large enough to undo the damage done in the first half.\n\nThe final whistle blew, cementing a historic and memorable 4-2 victory for Leicester City. The fans erupted in joy, celebrating an emphatic performance reminiscent of their title-winning run. Jamie Vardy, with a hat-trick to his name, commanded the headlines as his resurgence continued to be pivotal for a Leicester side looking to steer clear of relegation woes.\n\nFor Manchester City, the performance was a sobering reminder of the challenges ahead. The balance between attack and defense was the central theme Guardiola needed to address. Shaking off this defeat and stabilizing the defensive inconsistencies would be paramount in their quest to stay in contention for title aspirations. As their fixtures only got tougher, particularly with an upcoming clash against Arsenal, City had little time to regroup and recalibrate.\n\nIn sum, it was a clash packed with dramatic turns, tactical battles, individual brilliance, and raw emotions. Leicester City's triumph underscored their potential to rise again, while Manchester City were left to reassess and remediate their vulnerabilities."
