Crystal Palace, he started on the bench.\n2:4 Comment: And away from Andy King.\n2:6 Comment: It's just a whisker away from Matty Phillips.\n2:11 Comment: It's just a warning shot across Celestis Bowers, that, losing it in a dangerous area.\n2:17 Comment: Not a bad effort from Phillips, this.\n2:25 Comment: That's a touch, Zilat.\n2:29 Comment: Here we have a great view on that from the opposite side.\n2:33 Comment: We've seen the touch from Kasper Schmeichel's deputy here.\n2:41 Comment: This is where Leicester are a bit weak, and West Bromwich Albion are very strong.\n2:47 Comment: Taking the corners, half of the Premier League's ten goals this season.\n2:51 Comment: They've come from corner kick routines.\n2:53 Comment: They've got the opening goal in this fixture, home and away, last season.\n3:2 Comment: Almost a...\n3:6 Comment: Maybe hit three in a row.\n3:8 Comment: That is a huge strength of theirs, isn't it?\n3:10 Comment: West Brom's corners scored five already,

reversed it a bit, haven't they?\n5:31 Comment: The right footer on the left and the left footer on the right in Chris Brunt.\n5:36 Comment: James Morrison operating a little bit more off the front in the air-cog sitting.\n5:41 Comment: He's nominated quite rightly for the FIFA Award as Coach of the Year.\n5:54 Comment: Successful and in a very charming way.\n6:3 Comment: Talking up Shinji Okazaki in a pre-game interview that whoever plays up front,\n6:9 Comment: Vardy or Slimani, they're better with.\n6:11 Comment: Okazaki, rather than the two of them being involved as a pair themselves.\n6:17 Comment: Rondon.\n6:20 Comment: Fletcher, the hit one.\n6:22 Comment: Morrison.\n6:25 Comment: Phillips.\n6:30 Comment: Hopefully wants it from Neal.\n6:33 Comment: Of course, isn't anywhere near deep enough for West Bromwich Albion.\n6:37 Comment: They're finding a bit of space, 30 yards out, West Brom.\n6:41 Comment: Drinkwater and King.\n6:43 Comment: Just trying to counter that.\n6:45 Comment: West Brom's 50th league visit to the City of Leicester.\n6:50 Comment: Of course, also those matches at the Old Ground, Filbert Street.\n6:55 Comment: It's only the third in the Premier League.\n6:58 Comment: All of them have been here.\n7:0 Comment: Two years ago they won 1-0.\n7:2 Comment: Last season, as I mentioned earlier, finished 2-2.\n7:4 Comment: .\n7:11 Comment: That is such an organiser.\n7:13 Comment: That would be a sign for a Tony Koulis club, you have to play the Tony Koulis way.\n7:20 Comment: It's been a tough run as well, hasn't it?\n7:22 Comment: First Liverpool, then Manchester City, and now the Champions.\n7:26 Comment: Yes.\n7:27 Comment: .\n7:32 Comment: Nice to have lost away games at Manchester United, Liverpool, Chelsea.\n7:36 Comment: You can see that.\n7:37 Comment: We've had a lot of good games.\n7:38 Comment: We've had a lot of good games here.\n7:41 Comment: plenty of goals in the process but the one that really sticks in the crew of their\n7:44 Comment: supporters was that opening day fixture at Hull, all sorts of chaotic situations where\n7:52 Comment: hardly enough players to fulfill the fixture, they won it\n7:58 Comment: wasn't the best way to start the defensively league target\n8:2 Comment: Greg Pawson's the referee who spotted the handball by Riyad Mahrez\n8:11 Comment: it's a question of trying to win this first head only if you don't, given the knockdown\n8:31 Comment: recognizing a threat posed by Dawson\n8:36 Comment: piece of clues by who to pick out, Okazaki\n8:40 Comment: brings such energy to the position\n8:41 Comment: and the fearlessness here, the words associated with the Leicester's play\n8:49 Comment: backed of course by this phenomenal atmosphere here in the Finnfrauer stadium\n8:55 Comment: wasn't a bad attempt to pick any strike partner here from Okazaki, head side of the boot\n9:7 Comment: Mahrez\n9:11 Comment: Slimani, a touchline outside him\n9:17 Comment: a chance of it reaching the run of King\n9:20 Comment: Danny Simpson\n9:25 Comment: of course is so good at picking out Vardy's runs\n9:29 Comment: develop a working relationship with Slimani\n9:33 Comment: I don't think Slimani naturally will be working on the shoulder all the time in the way that Vardy does\n9:38 Comment: he just likes to come and show for it\n9:41 Comment: and that's what he's been doing for a long time\n9:43 Comment: and then Moussa, one of the new recruits\n9:49 Comment: called in the last two Premier League games so he's starting to get his name together in English football\n9:57 Comment: Simpson\n10:3 Comment: Mahrez\n10:5 Comment: , Rwich,\n10:7 Comment: Mourinho,\n10:9 Comment: Martinez\n10:24 Comment: Constantino\n10:25 Comment: Hustert\n10:26 Comment: Giroud\n10:27

Strasbourg\n12:1 Comment: knowledges\n12:2 Comment: THEY CHANT\n12:14 Comment: Last nine-by-final, mate.\n12:15 Comment: Only ten points from their only ten games they got relegated.\n12:24 Comment: Looking to improve their lot here.\n12:26 Comment: THEY CHANT\n12:29 Comment: Quite often that Leicester rear-guard\n12:31 Comment: will be a little fearful of the opposition in terms of the pace.\n12:34 Comment: Not that problem today.\n12:39 Comment: Come on, Seeler.\n12:40 Comment: Gets away with it.\n12:44 Comment: Just late.\n12:45 Comment: With his clearance, allowing the centre-forward to close him down.\n12:54 Comment: Didn't really shift it.\n12:56 Comment: But Rondon was able to block it.\n12:59 Comment: Could have flown in.\n13:6 Comment: Seeler has a World Cup winner's medal, incidentally.\n13:8 Comment: He was a non-playing member,\n13:10 Comment: but definitely a member of the squad for Germany and Brazil.\n13:24 Comment: Phillips.\n13:26 Comment: That's making a run on the inside.\n13:29 Comment: Played by Morgan.\n13:37 Comment: Jaka.\n13:43 Comment: I've seen plenty of the ball, Morris Crump.\n13:45 Comment: We thought that perhaps Leicester would have a bit more,\n13:48 Comment: and Surly Dawes still, but...\n13:49 Comment: Nothing in the round.\n13:56 Comment: THEY CHANT\n14:2 Comment: A bit of anxiety in the King Power rules for the home fans.\n14:6 Comment: Phillips crosses.\n14:7 Comment: Rondon getting across his man.\n14:11 Comment: Unable to steer it anywhere near the target.\n14:14 Comment: Yeah, because it came from so deep, it's always difficult for the strike\n14:17 Comment: to really make the keeper work.\n14:21 Comment: THEY CHANT\n14:24 Comment: It's only one of two.\n14:25 Comment: One of two that have scored a goal this season,\n14:28 Comment: along with Gareth McCauley.\n14:31 Comment: Only starting XI.\n14:32 Comment: THEY CHANT\n14:37 Comment: Yes, Chadwick. He's done very well.\n14:39 Comment: THEY CHANT\n14:40 Comment: He's got four goals and a couple of assists since he came from Spurs.\n14:45 Comment: He decided he wasn't really fit enough to play here.\n14:51 Comment: No operation.\n14:53 Comment: He had a knee problem.\n14:55 Comment: Could have been left to the international break.\n14:58 Comment: Obviously.\n15:0 Comment: He's gone through the details and not prepared to take the risk,\n15:6 Comment: although that would be the stunger for having Chadwick in this game.\n15:9 Comment: Yeah, Tony Funi's clearing the net, that means you get worse.\n15:13 Comment: He needs those three weeks to recover, whatever.\n15:19 Comment: THEY CHANT\n15:54 Comment: Mahrez.\n15:58 Comment: That's cross in.\n16:0 Comment: Morrison's header.\n16:1 Comment: Good work by Rondon.\n16:3 Comment: That's a fine ball for Phillips from Morrison.\n16:7 Comment: Morgan's come across.\n16:10 Comment: Front, in the middle.\n16:14 Comment: And Moussa almost took it back into terrible trouble.\n16:18 Comment: Well, they've been a threat early on here.\n16:21 Comment: West Brom, it is a beautifully weighted pass from Morrison.\n16:26 Comment: And it's a nice shape that they've got.\n16:28 Comment: Everybody looks comfortable with their jobs.\n16:39 Comment: The bonus of not being involved in Europe in the European week.\n16:44 Comment: Of course, one that Leicester had and used to their advantage last season.\n16:51 Comment: And Claudio Ranieri's had to sort out who was a bit travel-weary from...\n17:0 Comment: Obenhagen isn't that too far away, but from the emotional drain\n17:4 Comment: of playing a high-profile Champions League game on a night\n17:6 Comment: where they could have actually booked qualification there, virtually there.\n17:9 Comment: Still haven't conceded a goal in the Champions League.\n17:13 Comment: So, a new record for a newcomer.\n17:19 Comment: Drink water.\n17:21 Comment: And Mourinho's couldn't keep it in.\n17:28 Comment: He's only used 20 players so far in the Premier League and Champions League,\n17:32 Comment: so not been a case of...\n17:37 Comment: changing too much of the...\n17:41 Comment: excellent formula for last season.\n17:44 Comment: But as you said earlier, Alan, they're not quite like-for-likes,\n17:46 Comment: Nemanja and Vardy, and obviously the energy that N'Golo Kante provides,\n17:50 Comment: but they're not quite like-for-likes, Nemanja and Vardy, and obviously the energy that N'Golo Kante provides,\n17:54 Comment: so not a direct replacement.\n17:56 Comment: They brought Mendy and he's not fit, but he wasn't really looking as though he was instantly going to...\n18:2 Comment: do that particular job in the same way.\n18:4 Comment: Here's Morrison, through that Leicester midfield.\n18:7 Comment: And Silo does well at the feet of front.\n18:12 Comment: And again West Bromwich Albion looking the more likely side,\n18:15 Comment: and it's only 20 minutes here.\n18:17 Comment: Yeah, the crowd's sensing that.\n18:19 Comment: It could be a really tough afternoon for Leicester here today,\n18:23 Comment: they haven't really got going, you saw Ranieri frustrated,\n18:27 Comment: it's better quality passing, better service when they try and switch it to Mahrez.\n18:35 Comment: Keep trying to do it, get a one-on-one with Neon here.\n18:39 Comment: Mahrez.\n18:45 Comment: Max is crossing and that's well...\n18:47 Comment: That's the really good...\n18:48 Comment: Max Limani to attack the ball.\n18:50 Comment: That was a beauty though, wasn't it, just dinked in the box.\n18:55 Comment: That's when you want your striker anticipating taking a gamble.\n19:8 Comment: West Brom have only...\n19:15 Comment: They've only scored three goals for open play all season, the Premier League,\n19:18 Comment: and they've had three here already.\n19:20 Comment: Yeah, that could have been from Deeth and Chris Buck.\n19:25 Comment: The most decisive interception, but it was enough from Zulik.\n19:32 Comment: Kingshead.\n19:37 Comment: That's a put in too.\n19:42 Comment: I believe won the Championship in the Premier League with Leicester City.\n19:45 Comment: Wales international, very good, you're at 20-16.\n19:48 Comment: We found a good squad for his country as well to get to a semi-final.\n19:59 Comment: Mahrez.\n20:5 Comment: Neon fancies the battle, and he's won it again,\n20:7 Comment: and he's run it well up the pitch this time.\n20:12 Comment: And again, Chris Brom was making a run from that far side.\n20:15 Comment: That could have been fouled.\n20:18 Comment: He sunk.\n20:21 Comment: Clutchot.\n20:23 Comment: In West Brom, doing really well.\n20:26 Comment: Jakob.\n20:29 Comment: First touch from Dawson.\n20:33 Comment: Morrissey, on the corner to Rondon.\n20:35 Comment: XHOTEскаяPILA\n20:40 Comment: Rosseller, to be french, alsoenecaaded by Plitvica.\n20:42 Comment: His take.\n20:43 Comment: Very easy on the eye.\n20:45 Comment: Barca.\n20:46 Comment: That's one for Salihněr, exam scalpenn.\n20:48 Comment: better from Leicester\n20:51 Comment: Poops\n20:55 Comment: One for Slimani\n20:58 Comment: Appreciated the delivery even though he couldn't convert it\n21:4 Comment: I don't know if he's gesturing that he got caught in the lights or something\n21:8 Comment: but just gets ahead of it in a way and the curl takes it away from him\n21:18 Comment: Yeah, I think he's blaming the lights\n21:26 Comment: The sort of thing that happens this weekend in the first round of the FA Cup in non-league grounds\n21:31 Comment: and a Premier League stadium\n21:38 Comment: That's much better though from Leicester, good move that\n21:41 Comment: I sense if they can use the flanks well Leicester through Moussa and Mahrez\n21:51 Comment: That could be a way for them to win this match\n21:55 Comment: West Brom very strong through the middle\n22:2 Comment: Morgan looking for Rokoszaki\n22:6 Comment: Got the better of Evans by fouling it\n22:9 Comment: but Tommy Evans feeling there should have been a chance\n22:11 Comment: He's got a bit of cover behind him there\n22:15 Comment: And there wasn't\n22:39 Comment: Phillips\n22:41 Comment: That's to give you a heads up, a date for your diary\n22:47 Comment: It is a week on Saturday\n22:49 Comment: Manchester United against Arsenal\n22:51 Comment: 11.30am start\n22:53 Comment: Sky Sports 1\n22:58 Comment: Dodgy ball\n23:8 Comment: Marvin Atkinson\n23:9 Comment: the fourth\n23:11 Comment: Official\n23:12 Comment: supervising the exchange of\n23:16 Comment: very high tech football\n23:18 Comment: one that obviously wasn't suitable for a game of football\n23:21 Comment: replaced\n23:33 Comment: Who?\n23:37 Comment: Good tussle this, down beneath this Alan isn't it?\n23:40 Comment: Alan Neal\n23:41 Comment: We had Mahrez\n23:43 Comment: It's a tactic of Leicester's isn't it?\n23:45 Comment: I've looked several times to try and get the ball to Mahrez quickly\n23:49 Comment: Try and isolate Neal\n24:1 Comment: Morgan\n24:15 Comment: He's got away from Neal\n24:16 Comment: he's looked\n24:17 Comment: Algerian again\n24:18 Comment: That's the City\n24:19 Comment: Simpson\n24:22 Comment: into Hokusaki\n24:25 Comment: Simpson Mahrez still poised\n24:28 Comment: And Moussa\n24:30 Comment: Moosa\n24:32 Comment: slip in behind Gareth McCauley\n24:36 Comment: I think McCauley was confident enough to make it in the top half\n24:39 Comment: to let this go thought there was enough weight on the ball\n24:50 Comment: former leicester player of course gareth mccauley half the season's here\n24:57 Comment: it's a career that's really built from humble origins\n25:0 Comment: this mid-30s much worth his place in the

short at the back\n26:59 Comment: there\n27:0 Comment: five or six men behind the ball still\n27:2 Comment: they never looked in danger\n27:6 Comment: i'm sure it's something that tony foolish would have spoken about this week on the training ground\n27:11 Comment: keeping our shape well keeping a clean sheet it's important away from home their last\n27:16 Comment: six away wins in the premier league have been one nil\n27:24 Comment: letting it bounce the hoop was behind him\n27:28 Comment: he's got a good shot there by the way\n27:30 Comment: we've got two sets of center halves\n27:34

and something will happen\n27:54 Comment: that's the leicester philosophy here\n27:57 Comment: could have even bent over the ball\n27:59 Comment: direct path in obviously Slimani was trying to convert it\n28:9 Comment: Rondon\n28:11 Comment: must lose way into holding the ball up but shrugged kind of it in the end\n28:16 Comment: drink water\n28:25 Comment: the ball that couldn't be reached pushing the back on King\n28:31 Comment: there's nothing complicated from Mahrez just ducks inside and puts it into a dangerous area here\n28:40 Comment: Costa makes the move McCauley might have put it in his own now\n28:46 Comment: Morgan's header clicked on by drink water broken up by Evans\n28:56 Comment: floated forward by Fletcher Rondon was trying to power his way through\n29:4 Comment: you must have had teams that you always thought you'd score against Alenor the figures\n29:7 Comment: showed that you did score against Rondon certainly one of those\n29:11 Comment: for West Brom against Leicester yeah you do tend to remember those matches\n29:15 Comment: come back to the\n29:16 Comment: ground and think about the goal he scored\n29:23 Comment: Brunt Rondon challenge just to ease it back a bit easy though that marking for West Brom the\n29:30 Comment: way they could just thread the ball through nobody in the blue shirt could get close it's\n29:35 Comment: the area that contact I don't want to labour the point but it is a different Leicester this evening\n29:39 Comment: we've seen Chelsea already benefit so much from acquiring a diminutive French midfield player\n29:46 Comment: on the on Andy\n30:16 Comment: He did before alongside Conte.\n30:20 Comment: Here's Mahrez, now Slimani.\n30:27 Comment: Moussa.\n30:31 Comment: And the ball.\n30:46 Comment: Well, they have been impressive.\n30:52 Comment: Nice prompt.\n30:53 Comment: And certainly had more to say in the opposition's box.\n30:58 Comment: In terms of efforts on target, anyway.\n31:5 Comment: I was going to mention earlier that Claudio Ranieri did revert to being Tinker Man in midweek.\n31:10 Comment: Started with a back three in Copenhagen.\n31:14 Comment: Changed it in the second half.\n31:16 Comment: It's still not over.\n31:16 Comment: Individual players around the formation.\n31:23 Comment: It's funny, isn't it?\n31:24 Comment: Suddenly a back three becomes popular.\n31:27 Comment: Everybody tries it.\n31:29 Comment: You can see it for a good ten years in this country, don't you?\n31:39 Comment: Can work that, to let the ball run across onto your stronger side.\n31:45 Comment: Tani Pulisic.\n31:46 Comment: He's got a very good set of players who will be rehearsing those sort of things week in, week out on the training ground.\n31:52 Comment: Not so many coaches do rehearsed throw-in situations, but he does.\n31:59 Comment: It's the detail.\n32:3 Comment: I just wonder if he ever gets the chance to manage a side that's really going for top honours.\n32:9 Comment: Who prepares whether he would go about it in a different way.\n32:13 Comment: But he's always brought in as a firefighter, isn't he?\n32:15 Comment: And he's fought those fires very successfully.\n32:23 Comment: Like Sam Allardyce when he got the England job, but we'll never know now about that.\n32:34 Comment: Evans.\n32:36 Comment: McCall.\n32:39 Comment: A perception by Drinkworth of reading the direction of the pass and wanting to get on the ball again for Leicester.\n32:44 Comment: And of course they look to the magician of last season, Riyad Mahrez,\n32:51 Comment: concentrating on getting his crosses in at the moment.\n32:57 Comment: I see him run at Neom a bit more than he is.\n33:1 Comment: Moussa is running at Dawson.\n33:3 Comment: Needs McCauley to go across.\n33:6 Comment: And look at the show.\n33:7 Comment: What a goal kick.\n33:9 Comment: Well, he is super quick and Dawson won't fancy getting into a chase too many times.\n33:14 Comment: And rapid when he gets going.\n33:23 Comment: He's brought here against Crystal Palace and Tottenham.\n33:29 Comment: That's a record signing, but that's been totally eclipsed by Slimani.\n33:33 Comment: Yes!\n33:42

first-choice kit, of course, the blue and white stripe.\n44:12 Comment: Very white on the back, as you're looking across.\n44:14 Comment: But their actual second strip is predominantly blue,\n44:17

    "summary": "The King Power Stadium, known for being a fortress for Leicester City, once again played host to an exciting encounter, this time against West Bromwich Albion. Leicester City fans came in with buoyant spirits, not least because their side had been unbeaten at home for over 13 months. The day was filled with echoes of a consequential clash back in March which ended in a 2-2 draw, a game that was instrumental in Leicester's unforgettable title run.\n\nFrom the early minutes, the game showed promise. An early long throw by Christian Fuchs resulted in an initial corner, giving Leicester the chance to assert pressure. This echoed sentiments from their manager about maintaining intensity similar to their previous game against Tottenham. Danny Simpson, taking the mantle as he often does, was seen controlling the tempo from the back, feeding calculated passes while keeping West Brom's attackers at bay.\n\nJamie Vardy, though starting on the bench, was a constant figure of discussion. Despite his sporadic starts, his impact was always imminent. This was juxtaposed with the spirited presence of West Brom’s Matty Phillips, whose early warning shot signaled their intentions.\n\nIn these opening stages, the tactical battle unfolded. Leicester leaned on Danny Drinkwater, undoubtedly one of their standout players for the season. Mahrez and Slimani struggled to replicate the seamless understanding that Vardy had with his teammates. Yet, they generated optimism with their presence and movement. Phillips, ever dangerous, had moments that stretched the Leicester defense, showing West Brom’s calculated threats through set-pieces and long balls.\n\nAs the game wore on, both sides found spaces on rare occasions, though the play was largely cautious. Leicester’s Andy King, always with an eye for the attacking run, combined with Mahrez to probe Albion's defensive third. Yet West Brom, confident and organized under Tony Pulis' disciplined setup, seemed well-prepared for Leicester's advances. They absorbed the attacks well and exploited spaces, particularly through tactical set-pieces. Philips was keen to showcase his threatening edge, and Rondon, combining physical prowess with finesse, ensured West Brom didn’t ease off offensively.\n\nWith both sides mindful of not committing errors, the game saw periods of midfield skirmishing with Mahrez unable to consistently feed balls into productive areas. Yet the crowd, ever vocal, lifted the home side's spirits. Key interventions from the likes of Robert Huth and Wes Morgan reflected Leicester’s defensive robustness, though against a West Brom side that has shown resilience especially from corner scenarios, the importance of staying focused was critical.\n\nNearing the end of the first half, moments of end-to-end action kept the fans on edge. Leicester's Fuchs and Simpson frequently found themselves engaged in crucial interceptions although West Brom’s Dawson and McAuley were equally diligent in their defensive duties. The varied approaches from both teams, particularly evoking tactical nuances from corner routines, set the stage for what promised to be an intriguing second half.\n\nThe second half began with a palpable sense of urgency from both sides. Early on, James Morrison emerged as a key figure for West Brom, latently lurking around until he made a crucial breakthrough. In a finely orchestrated move, Morrison capitalized on Rondon's resilience who maintained possession under pressure. As Rondon held the ball, he patiently waited for movement, then played it to Phillips, whose precise cross found Morrison perfectly – a header that split Leicester's defense as it nestled into the far corner. It was a crucial goal from open play for West Brom, and they found themselves leading away from home.\n\nThe goal seemed to awaken Leicester’s fighting spirit. Almost immediately, Leicester launched a series of attacks. The equalizer wasn’t long in coming. Mahrez, increasingly becoming Leicester’s go-to man, curled in a beautiful cross, displaying finesse and accuracy unparalleled. Slimani, poised and clinical, rose above the defense to make it 1-1 with an expertly placed header. The goal revitalized Leicester and the fans responded with thunderous applause, breathing life back into the King Power Stadium.\n\nAs the game progressed, the intensity scaled further as both teams sought the upper hand. Leicester, buoyed by their equalizer, looked to press higher up the pitch. Mahrez continued to trouble the West Brom defense, threading passes and swinging in crosses to maintain pressure. Vardy, introduced later, brought additional speed and directness, further complicating matters for the visiting defenders. \n\nDespite Leicester’s growing momentum, West Brom showcased remarkable resilience. Their defensive lines, marshaled by the experienced McAuley and Evans, held firm. Rondon remained a handful for Leicester’s backline, creating space and drawing fouls to provide respite for his side. In one moment of clever interplay, Rondon almost crafted yet another chance that was ultimately thwarted by a vigilant Leicester defense.\n\nBut in a game of finely poised moments, it was West Brom who once again took the lead. A lapse from Drinkwater, uncharacteristic yet costly, saw the ball slip into the path of Phillips. His pace and composure were once again on display as he calmly drew the keeper and dinks it over for 2-1. The goal was not only a testament to his individual brilliance but also an embodiment of West Brom’s tactical adaptability and exploitation of half-chances.\n\nLeicester’s response was immediate and they surged forward with greater urgency. The introduction of fresh legs such as Demarai Gray injected pace and unpredictability into their attacks. Gray, born in Birmingham and having shown flashes of brilliance previously, took on defenders with aplomb, creating nervous moments for West Brom.\n\nAs time wound down, Leicester poured bodies forward. Fuchs and Simpson pushed higher, Maurz and Gray continued to press, while Slimani hovered menacingly in the box. The game adopted a frantic pace, with both teams pushing and counter-pushing. West Brom's solid defensive shell was tested repeatedly, and their clearances were often rushed, inviting further Leicester pressure.\n\nThe relentless siege from Leicester had moments of near-breakthroughs but fell short each time due to some resolute defending and an in-form Foster. Opportunities from corners and set-pieces came thick and fast but lacked the clinical touch needed. Their best chance came toward the dying moments, with a cross from Mahrez just evading Slimani’s desperate dive, leaving the fans in brief agony.\n\nDespite Leicester’s heroic efforts to claw back, full-time saw West Brom walk away with a well-fought 2-1 victory. The visiting side proved their mettle with a well-rounded performance, blending defensive discipline with clinical attacking moves. For Leicester, it was a day of missed opportunities but also a reflection of a side still bearing the weight of last season’s lofty heights yet showing glimpses of regaining their formidable form.\n\nThe game, rich in tactical shifts and individual brilliance, remained a testament to the unpredictable beauty of Premier League football, where victories are earned arduously, and every match echoes the heartbeat of relentless competition."
