Guidolin\n0:6 Comment: wants to see coming to South Wales as the Wolves close in\n0:10 Comment: on their head coach\n0:14 Comment: without a Premier League win here all season so far\n0:17 Comment: in fact the last time they won here at home was back at the start of May\n0:21 Comment: against Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool that was in the midst though of a very\n0:26 Comment: congested end to the season came between those two\n0:29 Comment: Europa League semi-finals against Villarreal\n0:32 Comment: and the Liverpool side today pretty unrecognizable\n0:35 Comment: from that day in May\n0:39 Comment: I think we saw even that early filling again there Fabianski wanted to play the\n0:42 Comment: ball short wanted to build from the back but\n0:45 Comment: Liverpool's front three were so high we had to go on there encouraging early\n0:49 Comment: contribution from Borja in winning it but he's giving it away to Klein\n0:59 Comment: it left experiencing a tochera\n1:2 Comment: not to mention Walker hot goal\n1:5 Comment: had already missed 4.0\n1:8 Comment: but that's a goal\n1:10 Comment: and algunos we're improving\n1:26 Comment: Rameh\n1:27 Comment: especially\n1:28 Comment: And the horn there in the near post area to hook it away.\n1:32 Comment: The pass to Lallana was a significant pass,\n1:34 Comment: nobody getting close to him.\n1:35 Comment: I think Leeroy Fair was closest,\n1:38 Comment: but didn't get tight enough on Lallana.\n1:40 Comment: You can't afford to allow Lallana to get something in that area of the pitch.\n1:45 Comment: Jordan Henderson, who did score the winner\n1:47 Comment: in what is Liverpool's only success in the Premier League on this ground.\n1:51 Comment: That came two seasons ago.\n1:58 Comment: The Liverpool coming here very much on song.\n2:13 Comment: Three Premier League wins on the spin.\n2:15 Comment: Four in six so far this season.\n2:19 Comment: And Jurgen Klopp has achieved much in his time at the club,\n2:22 Comment: which is coming up to one year.\n2:23 Comment: He'll celebrate his first year anniversary next week.\n2:27 Comment: Four Premier League wins on the spin.\n2:29 Comment: The bounce is not one of them.\n2:30 Comment: That could change today here.\n2:55 Comment: What?\n2:58 Comment: He's filling in that left back.\n3:1 Comment: He's tried a few tweaks and formations.\n3:4 Comment: Francesco Guidolin to try and get that elusive right formula.\n3:11 Comment: And he's had to look back to previous successes\n3:13 Comment: and bring Leon Britton back into a central role.\n3:17 Comment: And that's no surprise as he looks to recreate\n3:20 Comment: much of what was good about Swansea\n3:21 Comment: during their six years in the Premier League and even before that.\n3:26 Comment: See again, you have the ability to centre-back split.\n3:28 Comment: Looking for a shot, but Liverpool pressing the ball so high.\n3:32 Comment: Fabianski is going to have to go long in it.\n3:35 Comment: Here I say, it's a day where they might have\n3:37 Comment: could have done with Llorente up front,\n3:41 Comment: a real proper target man to hit and get them up the pitch.\n3:52 Comment: There, back to Jordi Amat.\n3:58 Comment: And they're looking for his compatriot, Volker Bastogne.\n4:2 Comment: He's picked himself up and he's bearing down on Lovren.\n4:17 Comment: Britton from you know, forward to back.\n4:20 Comment: It's gone near to Ravnic.\n4:23 Comment: Looking for handball there against James Muller.\n4:25 Comment: He's convinced it struck James Muller's hand in the win.\n4:28 Comment: Good ball from Britton to get him free on the right-hand side there.\n4:42 Comment: There's the Cameroon defender, Matty.\n4:47 Comment: Well won by Rangau.\n4:48 Comment: Rangau, outledged now for Swansea.\n4:53 Comment: He's got options as he looks for Volker.\n4:56 Comment: Well, that was a glorious chance.\n4:58 Comment: In the first five minutes for Volker Bastogne.\n5:1 Comment: Jürgen Skål has to score from that angle.\n5:4 Comment: It's a really good cross.\n5:5 Comment: Rangau with the decoy run here.\n5:7 Comment: Wijnaldum drops off.\n5:8 Comment: And it gives Routledge loads of time to pick his cross.\n5:11 Comment: And it's a wonderful delivery.\n5:14 Comment: I can only assume that Volker's up a little bit early here.\n5:17 Comment: He's mistimed it completely.\n5:21 Comment: Middle of the six-yard box, he has to do better.\n5:28 Comment: And he's up a lot of time, he's going to have to go in for a long period of time.\n5:31 Comment: But this is a good ball.\n5:32 Comment: He's going to have to go in for a long period of time.\n5:34 Comment: He's got to be careful here as well.\n5:35 Comment: He's got to be careful.\n5:37 Comment: Well, he's a player who came through the ranks on Atletico Madrid.\n5:40 Comment: Made his debut for the first team there at 18.\n5:42 Comment: And then his career was halted or the progression of it by a serious knee injury.\n5:47 Comment: He's had to endure or experience a few lone spells last season.\n5:53 Comment: Had it either way.\n5:54 Comment: He was prolific.\n5:55 Comment: And then he matched the goal tally of Gareth Bale.\n5:57 Comment: One short of the Real Madrid and Wales.\n5:58 Comment: to break their club record to bring him in\n6:7 Comment: come back by Matip\n6:10 Comment: Reynaldo\n6:13 Comment: Lallana\n6:16 Comment: and convincing defensive work\n6:18 Comment: it is away by Rankel who needed to mop up behind Van der Hoorn\n6:22 Comment: walk away but it'll come back at Swansea\n6:28 Comment: and it's a good sign\n6:36 Comment: Swansea press well and want it back\n6:38 Comment: now Sigurdsson\n6:39 Comment: no offside back here against Borja\n6:42 Comment: Routledge and Sigurdsson are the two in the middle\n6:45 Comment: back comes Milner\n6:47 Comment: and it's out of immediate danger by Lovren\n6:49 Comment: well that's encouraging for Swansea to be the broken Liverpool leader\n6:52 Comment: Sigurdsson played it early enough to keep Borja onside\n6:56 Comment: just onside I think\n6:57 Comment: and\n6:58 Comment: good run from the striker from in to out\n7:1 Comment: Liverpool eventually managed to crowd the ball but\n7:4 Comment: much better break from Swansea\n7:6 Comment: now is giving Liverpool a little bit of a taste of their own medicine\n7:9 Comment: stealing it in midfield and breaking\n7:14 Comment: Sigurdsson goes deep with the corner\n7:16 Comment: Van der Hoorn's in there\n7:17 Comment: and it's touch time by Leroy Fair\n7:21 Comment: eight minutes on the clock\n7:22 Comment: and Leroy Fair's at it again\n7:28 Comment: now 2 qualifications to bin unpack it\n7:32 Comment: not even picked up there\n7:34 Comment: there's nobody tight on him\n7:36 Comment: he's got all the time to get him back across\n7:39 Comment: the face of the goal\n7:40 Comment: and they're lining up to score here\n7:44 Comment: drops it into the mix\n7:48 Comment: may have come off a Liverpool player at the front post\n7:50 Comment: otherwise they might've been looking for offside Liverpool\n7:53 Comment: but it's a lovely nod to them\n7:55 Comment: and it was their game\n7:57 Comment: But it's a lovely knockdown from Boca.\n8:4 Comment: He's the man getting the goals for Swansea,\n8:7 Comment: his fourth of the season.\n8:10 Comment: And coming so hot on the heels of what was that Boca miss,\n8:15 Comment: that's a tonic indeed for Francesco Guidoline and Swansea City.\n8:22 Comment: Lallana, has Liverpool looked to respond straight away?\n8:27 Comment: Oh, this is much too easy, I'm sure, for Jurgen Klopp's liking.\n8:40 Comment: As it's come across, it's fair level,\n8:43 Comment: but it comes off Lovren here at the front post.\n8:47 Comment: There must have been very little in it in any case.\n8:50 Comment: A lovely knockdown from Boca at the back post.\n8:53 Comment: But there should have been more pressure on him,\n8:55 Comment: much more pressure at the back post.\n8:57 Comment: But come on, here's Liverpool,\n8:59 Comment: come on, come on, come on.\n9:1 Comment: Come on, come on, come on.\n9:7 Comment: Well, there's been so much to admire, hasn't there, Davy,\n9:10 Comment: about Liverpool this season,\n9:11 Comment: and that's that old area of concern at the back again,\n9:14 Comment: undone by a set piece.\n9:16 Comment: Now it's a clean sheet in the league,\n9:18 Comment: and that will continue whatever happens in the remaining minutes here.\n9:25 Comment: Come on, come on.\n9:26 Comment: Come on.\n9:26 Comment: Come on, come on.\n9:26 Comment: Come on.\n9:27 Comment: all the way to that afternoon.\n9:29 Comment: They hammered Aston Villa 6-0.\n9:31 Comment: That was back in February for the last time\n9:34 Comment: Liverpool got a clean sheet in the league away from home.\n9:49 Comment: Mane got in there ahead of Norton.\n9:57 Comment: It's under judge who have been fouling side of Mane.\n10:5 Comment: This must have been very tight.\n10:7 Comment: Some Liverpool players looking for offside here as it comes across.\n10:11 Comment: I think Firmino is deepest for Liverpool there\n10:14 Comment: and it plays fair onside.\n10:15 Comment: There's a touch from Loughlin as the ball comes across just here.\n10:20 Comment: I don't think the linesman can see that,\n10:21 Comment: but I think he's given Fir the benefit of the doubt\n10:24 Comment: from the first knockdown.\n10:27 Comment: Yes, Mane has Liverpool.\n10:31 Comment: It's not a builder response.\n10:34 Comment: By far a good composure from the Dutchman.\n10:44 Comment: That's the first time this season that Swansea have scored from a set-piece.\n10:48 Comment: They've played on Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool's Achilles' heel, if you like.\n10:57 Comment: Phil Pellegrini here to teach you another rematch in a rematch.\n11:1 Comment: They've got some playing ahead.\n11:2 Comment: Bryce Wright has 3, 2, 2 points,\n11:4 Comment: 6 Australia's형 war on offer this time.\n11:7 Comment: Oh, my God.\n11:8 Comment: Just out of time.\n11:9 Comment: Seems real crucial to see how he has the wings.\n11:12 Comment: Yes, but I think they dropped it in Nate\n11:15 Comment: 순 when he turned to Jan,\n11:18 Comment: which meant I said,\n11:19 Comment: I retreat around Spurs by now,\n11:20 Comment: so it doesn't mean you have to hear the whole\n11:25 Comment: about Kane wij promoting this little thing.\n11:27 Comment: press the gifted possession back that spells danger with Mane\n11:34 Comment: Lallana Klein\n11:40 Comment: Milner\n11:43 Comment: the flick from Lallana seeking Firmino swung to one offside it's not coming\n11:54 Comment: Firmino's cross a clearance from van de Hoorn\n12:7 Comment: this plays pass from Matic\n12:13 Comment: Mane\n12:27 Comment: this one's his recent record has been wretched they did achieve something that Liverpool didn't\n12:31 Comment: manage to do and that's uh get a premier league win at turf ball this season they started with\n12:36 Comment: the opener but since then it hasn't been a happy tale for defeats in the\n12:43 Comment: preceding five premier league games coming into today\n12:50 Comment: court closing down on Matic great pressure from Jack Court\n12:54 Comment: Matic not happening he may have a case here either way Jack Court's won 40 yards here to put the squeeze on\n13:3 Comment: it's a spirited start from Swansea\n13:7 Comment: 15 quick and fast\n13:13 Comment: mis surroundings\n13:22 Comment: 바�h\n13:27 Comment: did\n13:28 Comment: not\n13:30 Comment: Yale\n13:32 Comment: he were\n13:34 Comment: Laurie\n13:39 Comment: William\n13:41 Comment: 's\n13:43 Comment: be\n13:52 Comment: faster\n14:13 Comment: The goal already to his name, why not take the shot on?\n14:15 Comment: Those two gentlemen, Steve Kaplan and on the right,\n14:19 Comment: as you look at it, Jason Levine, the American investors.\n14:25 Comment: Hugh Jenkins, the more familiar face in the boardroom of Swansea City,\n14:28 Comment: the chairman.\n14:30 Comment: Reports in the newspapers across the nation, really,\n14:34 Comment: that he's been meeting Bob Bradley, the current American manager\n14:39 Comment: or the former American national manager.\n14:43 Comment: So far, so good.\n14:48 Comment: Francesco Cuidilin, Swansea here today.\n14:51 Comment: Mane, Firmino, offside.\n14:56 Comment: He's not happy, and certainly in that position,\n14:59 Comment: he shouldn't be cut offside.\n15:0 Comment: You can see the last defender.\n15:2 Comment: You can see right across the line.\n15:5 Comment: A bit of the ball from James Milner here, helped on by Firmino.\n15:8 Comment: Oh, very little in that.\n16:14 Comment: And the opening minutes here to prevent Liverpool getting into their stride.\n16:20 Comment: They're almost lost in a position where they could have been punished.\n16:25 Comment: They're quite deliberately making the challenge there to stop the game.\n16:36 Comment: The busier of the two, but they know there's a lot of football left in this.\n16:42 Comment: But they're not giving up.\n16:43 Comment: They're not giving up.\n16:43 Comment: something to hold on to\n16:46 Comment: FANS ROAR\n17:12 Comment: Liverpool do have precedence this season for falling behind\n17:15 Comment: and recovering the situation\n17:16 Comment: they did it in spectacular style\n17:18 Comment: on day one at the Emirates you might remember\n17:21 Comment: the only match they failed to score in the Premier League this year\n17:28 Comment: was that defeat away at Burnley\n17:30 Comment: and we know that Jurgen Klopp signed a match for anyone on their day\n17:36 Comment: but it's cutting out the blips\n17:38 Comment: like they saw at Burnley\n17:39 Comment: that are the things he needs to focus on\n17:41 Comment: of more immediate concern\n17:43 Comment: is an injury here to Adam Lallana\n17:45 Comment: he's caught with the front studs there off Leon Britton\n17:55 Comment: he's making an attempt to play the ball\n17:59 Comment: that's no consolation to the Liverpool man\n18:1 Comment: as soon as it was an impact injury\n18:7 Comment: you would expect him to be able to continue\n18:9 Comment: but it's that time of the season\n18:13 Comment: and the international manager\n18:15 Comment: to look on with concern\n18:17 Comment: with the two week international break\n18:19 Comment: up and coming after these weekend's fixtures\n18:21 Comment: Southgate set to name his England squad\n18:29 Comment: after tomorrow's games\n18:46 Comment: The Lallana still waiting to come the longest\n18:53 Comment: Alana still waiting to come on on this wide\n19:1 Comment: he's ready to do so\n19:3 Comment: Here he is now, Alana\n19:5 Comment: Firmino\n19:7 Comment: by Amata and this is Norton\n19:15 Comment: Lallana still has a problem here\n19:21 Comment: if that's the same injury that's a worry\n19:26 Comment: looked to be a pretty straightforward contact injury initially\n19:33 Comment: but clearly it's a problem\n19:35 Comment: Daniel Staric has stepped up his warm up\n19:40 Comment: so he looks like he'll be the man to replace Adam Lallana\n19:44 Comment: should he not be able to continue\n19:46 Comment: and it does look that way doesn't it\n19:48 Comment: Lallana making his way down to the dressing room\n19:49 Comment: Liverpool temporarily down to 10\n20:7 Comment: play guys\n20:9 Comment: Jordi\n20:11 Comment: Lallana\n20:31 Comment: Not crispy\n20:33 Comment: Or the Klee\n20:36 Comment: I did not want to look at him\n20:40 Comment: Werner\n20:41 Comment: fte\n20:44 Comment: on Monday Night Football saying he wish he could make his players taller.\n20:48 Comment: Some things are beyond the managers.\n20:52 Comment: Norton.\n20:56 Comment: Sigurdsson.\n20:57 Comment: Dropping it in for Cork.\n21:2 Comment: A very decent effort. Really difficult when it's coming over his shoulder like that.\n21:7 Comment: Sigurdsson as usual picks the right ball here, beautifully weighted.\n21:10 Comment: On the stretch Jack Cork's got a little bit too much to do.\n21:35 Comment: Lovren.\n21:36 Comment: Running wide for Milner.\n21:37 Comment: Heavy touch on him allows Ratlidge to score.\n21:40 Comment: A very big foul. Liverpool's number seven.\n21:44 Comment: Michael Oliver the referee here.\n22:0 Comment: Quite protracted preparations at Daniel Sturridge to come on almost complete.\n22:5 Comment: McAtherin gets a groin injury, the reason for Adam Lallana's early exit.\n22:10 Comment: It's got to be a major concern ahead of the England squad announcement.\n22:17 Comment: Jack Cork again leading the press and the way they're playing at the moment\n22:20 Comment: Swansea he's got a lot of freedom to to go and join in with the striker.\n22:25 Comment: Norton has played Mane onside here.\n22:29 Comment: Firmino.\n22:31 Comment: Sigurdsson helping out.\n22:37 Comment: Frank out.\n22:41 Comment: Lacazette with a full dieser now.\n22:45 Comment: An interesting kill there555 of Talbot.\n22:46 Comment: It's not an easy match for Liverpool exactly.\n22:48 Comment: Lovren sits there just to midfield from the ball but stillؤ\n22:50 Comment: , T Briefie, an catch for R looked to save that role.\n22:52 Comment: Well done by ...\n22:54 Comment: Ch ethical it Cork' on tackle.\n22:58 Comment: Sexy.\n22:59 Comment: The Cav is mix up the two Bruno challenges.\n23:0 Comment: Prime waiting for Scioli to go about it.\n23:1 Comment: That plays well.\n23:2 Comment: Here comes Fernando.\n23:4 Comment: This goes for Sabrina.\n23:5 Comment: define the beginning line at bought reign at the right moment.\n23:9 Comment: I already have a question question.\n23:10 Comment: The ALA T.\n23:10 Comment: Yeah, give me it!\n23:16 Comment: Snow just slotted into a centre-forward position.\n23:19 Comment: Oh, that was...\n23:21 Comment: Took a long time, it took a long time, the linesman.\n23:25 Comment: Jordi Amat stepped up immediately.\n23:30 Comment: Not quite sure why the linesman took so long.\n23:32 Comment: See Amat here, number two.\n23:35 Comment: He knows he's got his angle spot on there,\n23:37 Comment: he couldn't quite believe it when he looked over to see the flag down.\n23:46 Comment: Halfway through the first half,\n23:48 Comment: Liverpool have lost a goal and they've lost Adam Lallana.\n23:51 Comment: Sturridge on.\n23:53 Comment: And if the past is anything to go by, he loves playing against Swansea.\n23:57 Comment: Four goals, two assists in six games against them for Liverpool.\n24:3 Comment: Coutinho's dropped into that midfield three,\n24:5 Comment: Firmino now playing left side with Daniels,\n24:7 Comment: Sturridge...\n24:10 Comment: ..playing as a proper number nine.\n24:31 Comment: Swansea in their sixth Premier League season now,\n24:33 Comment: and they've made their worst-ever start after six games,\n24:37 Comment: four points harvested so far, and made a very solid start here.\n24:41 Comment: THEY CHANT\n24:43 Comment: And could that batter have caught Fowle off the ball there by Henderson,\n24:47 Comment: who might be in trouble,\n24:48 Comment: Michael Oliver wants to work with the Liverpool captain.\n24:51 Comment: Again, at the moment the ball was played into Bocca,\n24:54 Comment: Jack Cot was on his way, he's the one of that central three\n24:58 Comment: who's been encouraged to go and get in touch with the striker,\n25:0 Comment: go beyond him.\n25:1 Comment: I feel as though this is an accidental clip here,\n25:4 Comment: Cot getting into good space, yeah.\n25:6 Comment: Jordan Henderson knows exactly what he's doing here.\n25:9 Comment: Knows his wrong side.\n25:21 Comment: Sigurdsson takes, what an inviting one,\n25:23 Comment: and it's another golden opportunity for Bocca,\n25:27 Comment: and another one that goes wide.\n25:29 Comment: I think he's expecting Lovren to get his head in there,\n25:31 Comment: just a wonderful ball in from Sigurdsson.\n25:36 Comment: THEY CHANT\n25:39 Comment: Might have been offside, I think he's gone early there,\n25:41 Comment: Bocca, he sees it very late, didn't know anything about it,\n25:45 Comment: but I think he was offside when he played.\n25:47 Comment: THEY CHANT\n26:14 Comment: Norton.\n26:16 Comment: THEY CHANT\n26:26 Comment: Hitting pressurised by Coutinho, robbed by Coutinho,\n26:30 Comment: Sturridge to his right.\n26:32 Comment: Can he pick him out?\n26:34 Comment: He's checked out the run there, Daniel,\n26:35 Comment: Sturridge realised that he was running away,\n26:36 Comment: he wanted it earlier.\n26:38 Comment: One slack touch from Leon Britton here almost proves costly.\n26:42 Comment: THEY CHANT\n26:46 Comment: He's trying to pull out to Sturridge,\n26:48 Comment: he knows he's going to be offside if he receives it.\n26:50 Comment: THEY CHANT\n26:54 Comment: One slack touch, Northam skipping away.\n26:56 Comment: THEY CHANT\n27:7 Comment: They CHANT\n27:8 Comment: THEY CHANT\n27:34 Comment: Coutinho\n27:38 Comment: and Milner\n27:44 Comment: Firmino\n27:50 Comment: Firmino's cross, met by Jordi Amat\n27:54 Comment: Van der Hoorn\n27:56 Comment: in for Sigurdsson\n27:58 Comment: now Firmino\n28:0 Comment: and Mané\n28:4 Comment: Mané trying to turn it around the corner\n28:6 Comment: still got it here Mané\n28:8 Comment: frantic defending by Swansea\n28:10 Comment: there goes Mané, might have been a nudge in his back\n28:12 Comment: still they can't get it away\n28:14 Comment: and Bair with a chance to do just that\n28:16 Comment: and he's fouled by his great friend\n28:18 Comment: Jorginho Wijnaldum\n28:20 Comment: look Leon Britten took a big chance\n28:22 Comment: trying to make the tackle from the wrong side\n28:24 Comment: looked a bit clumsy here\n28:26 Comment: terrific feet initially from Mané\n28:28 Comment: Britten comes in here from the wrong side\n28:30 Comment: give the referee a decision\n28:32 Comment: Michael Oliver doesn't want to know\n28:38 Comment: relief there for Swansea all round\n28:50 Comment: he went up very high there at Lawton\n28:52 Comment: and Mané has given away the free kick\n28:54 Comment: for his part in that incident\n28:58 Comment: Mané has hurt himself in that corner\n29:0 Comment: he's going to have to come out the landing Mané\n29:2 Comment: just eases in here makes a bridge for him\n29:6 Comment: only ice for the ball there\n29:8 Comment: taking the one down\n29:30 Comment: Boulogne\n29:32 Comment: and Lovren\n29:34 Comment: is in front\n29:38 Comment: very well work back to Ratledge\n29:40 Comment: Lovren is across\n29:42 Comment: well read really good wood from Lovren\n29:44 Comment: really good pace of Ratledge\n29:46 Comment: determined that the ball wasn't coming into the box\n29:48 Comment: did really well to close it out\n29:50 Comment: cheers\n30:0 Comment: It looked like it might have gone out, but the system didn't see it that way.\n30:9 Comment: It's cleared away.\n30:11 Comment: Storage fouled by Van der Hooy.\n30:19 Comment: The centre-back always looked favourite here as the ball's played long there from Jordan Henderson.\n30:24 Comment: Turning back in a little bit.\n30:30 Comment: Reynaldo.\n30:37 Comment: Firmino.\n30:40 Comment: I think for Clyne, but only finding Lawton.\n30:46 Comment: Half an hour played.\n30:48 Comment: Leroy Fares, fourth goal of the season, separates the sides.\n31:0 Comment: Storage.\n31:6 Comment: That's it.\n31:31 Comment: Man, I couldn't work it beyond Sigurdsson.\n31:37 Comment: Come on!\n31:41 Comment: Come on, guys!\n31:44 Comment: Liverpool having the better of the action areas,\n31:46 Comment: but I think much of that down to Swansea being prepared to drop off at times.\n31:50 Comment: Make sure the ball's being passed in front of them.\n31:53 Comment: So far, it's worked pretty well.\n31:54 Comment: Come on, guys!\n31:55 Comment: And Francesco Guidolin might feel his side should be too ahead.\n31:58 Comment: The chance that Borja had early on really should have been in the back of the net.\n32:4 Comment: In defence of Borja, that second opportunity he had from the Sigurdsson free kick,\n32:11 Comment: had it gone in, he would probably have been flagged for offside.\n32:15 Comment: He was certainly in an offside position when he headed it.\n32:18 Comment: Why?\n33:3 Comment: I think it's fair to say, David, that Lucas Fabianski and the Swansea goal\n33:7 Comment: might have expected to have been a little busier than he has been so far.\n33:11 Comment: here's Coutinho\n33:20 Comment: I think it's dead right Bill, you know the first five minutes\n33:24 Comment: very worrying for Swansea to be Liverpool were moving the ball but since\n33:28 Comment: then it's all been happening in front of Swansea much the busier of the two\n33:34 Comment: where it really counts\n33:41 Comment: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no\n33:48 Comment: The meaty challenge by Nathaniel Klein on Filthy Sigurdsson\n34:7 Comment: It's been a mixed bag of the morning weather-wise here in South Wales\n34:10 Comment: heavy showers\n34:11 Comment: and a little bit of sunshine threatened to keep out.\n34:14 Comment: It's been a mixed bag of a performance so far for Liverpool,\n34:17 Comment: who haven't really been able to hit the heights that they have done in recent weeks.\n34:22 Comment: Five against Hull, albeit 10-man Hull for the most part,\n34:25 Comment: and that wonderful win at Chelsea in their last away game.\n34:33 Comment: Reynaldo.\n34:36 Comment: Firmino.\n34:37 Comment: Klein.\n34:38 Comment: Very important block.\n34:40 Comment: The guy, Jordi Amat.\n34:41 Comment: It certainly was, because Kyle Norton initially just drawn to the ball.\n34:45 Comment: He's really narrow here, he's out the game now,\n34:47 Comment: tries to make the block, can't make it.\n34:50 Comment: Good cover at the front poster.\n35:1 Comment: First Liverpool corner, with 10 first-half minutes left to play.\n35:5 Comment: Henderson will take.\n35:9 Comment: Coutinho.\n35:10 Comment: Lovren.\n35:13 Comment: Fares out, trying to carry it out, but he's given it straight back to Milner.\n35:18 Comment: Klein's last man back here.\n35:19 Comment: GOLDEN.\n35:56 Comment: OOOHHHHH!\n35:57 Comment: Loose pass,\n35:58 Comment: switch Liverpool move loudly.\n35:59 Comment: Towns above.\n36:1 Comment: Sturridge, hoisted high, up towards Mane.\n36:5 Comment: Sigurdsson, back to help out for Swansea.\n36:7 Comment: Klein.\n36:8 Comment: Henderson, looked at Fielder.\n36:9 Comment: Henderson looked to thread it through.\n36:19 Comment: Notch in the back from Coutinho, and a great kick for Swansea.\n36:22 Comment: Beautiful little dink over the top there from Nottingham to find the striker.\n36:27 Comment: He's quite happy he's fouled here.\n36:31 Comment: On the front foot because of a poor pass from Ranke earlier initially.\n36:35 Comment: Not the best cross from Daniel Sturridge.\n36:37 Comment: But eventually Swansea managed to throw the ball,\n36:40 Comment: as they have done pretty well so far in this game.\n36:49 Comment: Sigurdsson, Borja.\n36:53 Comment: Sigurdsson, and invited Ranke to join the attack.\n36:59 Comment: Kerr.\n37:1 Comment: Britton.\n37:5 Comment: Clyde.\n37:7 Comment: And Clyde was sliding in there on Jack Cork,\n37:12 Comment: and Cork went in a little heavily, that's why he's been booked.\n37:16 Comment: The pass does Jack Cork no favours, it's light for him,\n37:19 Comment: he's always getting their second.\n37:24 Comment: And a nothing area of the pitch.\n37:27 Comment: He might live to regret that.\n37:29 Comment: Been a terrific job pressing the ball so far, Jack Cork,\n37:32 Comment: he's been all over the pitch.\n37:35 Comment: He's won a piece in terms of Yama Codd,\n37:37 Comment: that's Jordan Henderson, booked for Liverpool,\n37:38 Comment: and now Jack Cork for Swansea.\n38:1 Comment: That's it, value of movement by him to try and pick out.\n38:4 Comment: Sturridge.\n38:5 Comment: FOOTBALL FANS ROAR\n38:7 Comment: On the ground with Routledge buzzing around,\n38:9 Comment: and he's been penalised for simulation now.\n38:12 Comment: The ignominy of a free kick and now a yellow card for Daniel Sturridge.\n38:18 Comment: Only Daniel Sturridge knows how much contact there was here.\n38:25 Comment: Routledge trying to help out at the back.\n38:29 Comment: Wim Routledge's arm is up,\n38:30 Comment: but surely not enough to put the striker on the floor.\n38:35 Comment: I think if he wants to stay up there, he can stay up.\n38:41 Comment: Good bust into the channel.\n38:45 Comment: I think Michael Oliver's got it right.\n38:53 Comment: So on for the striker, Lallana Sturridge goes into Michael Oliver's foot\n38:57 Comment: as the sun breaks out and Klein breaks forward.\n39:5 Comment: FOOTBALL FANS ROAR\n39:18 Comment: Number one getting in in front of Sturridge.\n39:23 Comment: Curious ball from Borja, looked like it might spell trouble.\n39:26 Comment: This might be gifted to Coutinho.\n39:28 Comment: Mane now, what a challenge that is.\n39:31 Comment: Brilliant from Amat, but the danger's not clear.\n39:33 Comment: Sturridge.\n39:35 Comment: FOOTBALL FANS ROAR\n39:36 Comment: There'll be a corner touched when the Dutch defender...\n39:41 Comment: Terrific block from Amat,\n39:43 Comment: because he's not expecting the possession to turn over.\n39:46 Comment: When the ball's played forward, he's got a couple of yards to make up there,\n39:49 Comment: he did brilliantly to stop the shot.\n39:51 Comment: Look at the body Swansea are trying to get behind the ball.\n39:57 Comment: Lovely ball into the channel, terrific piece of defending.\n40:1 Comment: And Swansea hold on to their lead until half-time.\n40:4 Comment: Liverpool asking questions.\n40:5 Comment: Norton.\n40:6 Comment: And he glances it away.\n40:8 Comment: Assures it will be a throw in the corner rather than the corner.\n40:11 Comment: FOOTBALL FANS ROAR\n40:13 Comment: Sturridge, to Henderson.\n40:15 Comment: FOOTBALL FANS ROAR\n40:17 Comment: And he's got it in the corner, he's got it in the corner,\n40:20 Comment: he's got it in the corner.\n40:22 Comment: That's the ball.\n40:24 Comment: FOOTBALL FANS ROAR\n40:26 Comment: And it's in the corner.\n40:30 Comment: FOOTBALL FANS ROAR\n40:32 Comment: Sturridge.\n40:33 Comment: To Henderson.\n40:35 Comment: FOOTBALL FANS ROAR\n40:36 Comment: Lovren.\n40:37 Comment: FOOTBALL FANS ROAR\n40:38 Comment: Lovren.\n40:39 Comment: FOOTBALL FANS ROAR\n40:49 Comment: Excellent Swansea pressure forcing Liverpool back to Karius.\n40:52 Comment: FOOTBALL FANS ROAR\n40:54 Comment: We've got to press together the Swansea, a lot of energy didn't waste it.\n40:57 Comment: Bocca going to press on his own.\n40:59 Comment: The ball just being passed around him.\n41:1 Comment: What he do as a unit.\n41:3 Comment: FOOTBALL FANS ROAR\n41:7 Comment: Mané, because he's got the feeling of Norton, he's right.\n41:9 Comment: But not of Amatou, chested behind.\n41:11 Comment: And so quick, Mané, from a static position, he is so quick on the bus.\n41:15 Comment: FOOTBALL FANS ROAR\n41:18 Comment: Big four to five minutes coming up for Swansea here,\n41:21 Comment: who'll be desperate to get in that worst 1-0 up.\n41:23 Comment: FOOTBALL FANS ROAR\n41:27 Comment: Signs that Liverpool are really starting to come to life in this match.\n41:31 Comment: FOOTBALL FANS ROAR\n41:41 Comment: Anderson delivers. It's Lovren, it's Firmino, it's blocked.\n41:45 Comment: And Faryansky can gather.\n41:47 Comment: And a good block again.\n41:49 Comment: FOOTBALL FANS ROAR\n41:51 Comment: Matic is completely unmarked here.\n41:53 Comment: Big centre-back gets himself to the front post, nobody near him.\n41:56 Comment: Unfortunately enough, Bocca got the first glance on it.\n42:0 Comment: Otherwise, Swansea might have been in bother.\n42:2 Comment: FOOTBALL FANS ROAR\n42:6 Comment: RALPH GIR pineapple\n42:8 Comment: These two sides will be very interested in events here today.\n42:12 Comment: The top two in the Premier League, Tottenham and Manchester City,\n42:14 Comment: meet 1-30, Sky Sports 1, as 1st part of Super Sunday,\n42:18 Comment: converted against Arsenal, the second part from quarter stiff,\n42:21 Comment: Here's Mane, behind Firmino.\n42:25 Comment: Here's G phone scorer for Swansea.\n42:27 Comment: Dealing Radledge\n42:29 Comment: he's giving it back to his hosts\n42:44 Comment: Britain\n42:48 Comment: and free kick\n42:53 Comment: I don't think Ronaldo could do that really\n42:55 Comment: yeah he did brilliantly on Britain\n42:57 Comment: it looked for a moment as if it was getting away from him\n42:59 Comment: managed to get a really early touch on the ball\n43:2 Comment: and even from this range\n43:5 Comment: you'd be surprised if\n43:6 Comment: Gylfi Sigurdsson doesn't try to get something on target here\n43:10 Comment: he saw Francesco Guido in there\n43:13 Comment: his players are certainly putting in a shift for him today\n43:18 Comment: they have one goal against Liverpool\n43:22 Comment: they could have had more\n43:23 Comment: chances have been squandered\n43:25 Comment: and with the quality that this man has\n43:28 Comment: yes\n43:29 Comment: this certainly represents another opportunity\n43:32 Comment: Sigurdsson\n43:34 Comment: Paris nearly made him the end of it\n43:36 Comment: took a big dip right in front of him\n43:40 Comment: that's why he might have\n43:43 Comment: got out of his gloves for a moment\n43:45 Comment: huge dip at the last moment\n43:47 Comment: Milner\n43:59 Comment: G Jungle\n44:18 Comment: and G for half a gift\n44:21 Comment: and we know padaloo\n44:22 Comment: an important field goal\n44:23 Comment: there he gets ahead trips\n44:24 Comment: He will probably be the last man to make the rest of home play\n44:26 Comment: he'll bounce forward\n44:27 Comment: but it takes Car 오� Fellows manage to come through, He's lucky\n44:28 Comment: during these international times he's become a great player\n44:29 Comment: Sturridge, another go from Amat, he got back at him.\n44:33 Comment: Might have just had a little bit of his shirt there.\n44:37 Comment: Yeah, he got a little bit too tight initially, Amat.\n44:39 Comment: Ended up being spun there by Sturridge,\n44:42 Comment: but was quick enough again to stop it coming in.\n44:44 Comment: Come on, come on!\n44:51 Comment: Come on, guys! Come on, lads!\n44:54 Comment: Get tight, get tight, come on, Moja!\n44:59 Comment: Captions by Red Bee Media\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: No half-time substitutions, Liverpool have already lost Adam Lallana to a groin injury.\n0:8 Comment: We've had Daniel Sturridge's replacement booked for simulation,\n0:11 Comment: as he went down in the penalty area looking for a spot kick.\n0:15 Comment: Suffice to say, Davy, so far not quite so good for Jurgen Klopp.\n0:20 Comment: It's been pretty poor so far, but I'm sure Liverpool have another gear to find,\n0:24 Comment: I think the longer the game goes on, the more likely Swansea are to become strung out.\n0:29 Comment: The space might open up a little bit for them, so far Swansea have been terrific,\n0:34 Comment: they've choked the game, they've crowded the ball brilliantly,\n0:37 Comment: but you wonder whether they have the energy to go the distance here.\n0:41 Comment: Swansea certainly rising to the occasion so far,\n0:45 Comment: we know there's more to come from them.\n0:49 Comment: Fascinatingly balanced here at the Liberty Stadium.\n0:53 Comment: Matip hooks it away.\n1:2 Comment: And again in his tenth season at the club, very different club from the one he joined.\n1:19 Comment: Norton in pursuit, and through to Sturridge.\n1:22 Comment: Heavy first touch, and a spin, and it's not going behind for a goal kick.\n1:29 Comment: It's a good one from Klopp, it's through the legs of Kyle Norton on the far side.\n1:35 Comment: A little bit heavy in the story so far for Daniel Sturridge.\n1:39 Comment: It's a difficult one from Jordi Amartey again,\n1:42 Comment: talking about the one late in the first half, maybe it's Boston to get away with it.\n1:46 Comment: First time for the Reds, and it's a difficult one for Swansea.\n1:50 Comment: It's a difficult one for Swansea, and it's a difficult one for Liverpool.\n1:54 Comment: They've got a very good chance of winning,\n1:57 Comment: but it's a difficult one for Swansea, and it's a difficult one for Liverpool.\n2:1 Comment: It's a difficult one for Swansea, and it's a difficult one for Liverpool.\n2:31 Comment: With heavy rain falling here.\n2:36 Comment: Coutinho, who's dropped a little deeper from his customary position after the loss of Lallana.\n2:41 Comment: Mane, seeking scourge, finding scourge, Mane, beyond Fabianski,\n2:47 Comment: someone needs to clear it, and that eventually obliges.\n2:50 Comment: Routledge has joined in.\n3:8 Comment: Here comes Ranko.\n3:13 Comment: Plenty of red shirts back now, it's still like in Nespa, Swansea.\n3:17 Comment: Ranko, Routledge, and it eludes everyone.\n3:22 Comment: Really surprised he didn't test the goalkeeper there, on his right side.\n3:28 Comment: Anything on target is going to be a problem for Carriere, even from that angle.\n3:47 Comment: Liverpool already in the opening four minutes have said this half have caused more problems than they did throughout the whole of the first.\n3:53 Comment: At the back, Fabianski and Co.\n4:11 Comment: Mane coming close, here's a problem, Swansea exposed here on the left side of midfield,\n4:15 Comment: that hasn't happened too often.\n4:21 Comment: Plenty of bodies go side, Swansea, but starting to live a little bit more dangerously.\n4:26 Comment: Now Norten.\n4:42 Comment: Swansea know they can't just sit back on this one goal lead, they're seeking a second.\n4:49 Comment: Fair, he got the first.\n4:52 Comment: So the Tender can get a little more involved than perhaps he did at times in the first 45, but he's lost out.\n4:58 Comment: Lovely give of the shoulder to Santotinio.\n5:58 Comment: Ravljic.\n6:6 Comment: Three Huntington Pats for Liverpool, and they have their reward.\n6:10 Comment: Henderson.\n6:14 Comment: Loose touch by Ronaldo.\n6:17 Comment: There haven't been too many of those since he joined the club from Newcastle in the summer.\n6:23 Comment: And in this redefined, deeper, lying role, the batsman, Virgilio Wijnaldum.\n6:38 Comment: Everything they're doing at the moment, Swansea, the hopes of owning Lyon's Britain, you just wonder whether he's got the legs.\n6:46 Comment: He can go the distance in 90 minutes.\n6:52 Comment: APPLAUSE\n7:22 Comment: They've had some pretty ordinary performances by their managers' admission this season, Swansea here against Hull.\n7:40 Comment: Away at Southampton they were pretty lacklustre, but the two games against Manchester City have helped them take strides forward.\n7:49 Comment: Mane upend it, Liverpool free kick.\n7:53 Comment: A really cynical one from Lyon's Britain, he knows he's wrong side, he knows Mane's too quick here.\n8:4 Comment: This is Coutinho's range all day long.\n8:6 Comment: Coutinho sets his sights, Swansea now need to tread the line very carefully, that's two of their deep-lying midfielders, Jack Horth and Lyon's Britain both in the book now.\n8:25 Comment: Felipe Coutinho licking his lips at the Liberty.\n8:37 Comment: Straight into the Swansea wall, Henderson over the top, Firmino! 1-1.\n8:46 Comment: Roberto Firmino.\n8:50 Comment: Coasting in behind, and levelling the scores.\n8:54 Comment: Initially the Swansea wall does its job, they've got plenty of height in the wall here.\n8:59 Comment: Not the best from Coutinho.\n9:2 Comment: And then they try to clear the penalty box, the men in white is well on sight as it comes back in.\n9:8 Comment: Could have taken a touch, but gets enough on it.\n9:12 Comment: Fabianski may be expecting Firmino to go to his left, and he's done him at the narrow side instead.\n9:21 Comment: They've ridden the luck at times, Swansea now really is game on, they've got a lot of work to do now.\n9:33 Comment: Well the free kick surrendered by Britain, he went into the book from the resulting Coutinho strike into the wall.\n9:40 Comment: His compatriot Firmino heads Liverpool back on track here in South Wales.\n9:46 Comment: Go on.\n10:16 Comment: It's got to be a concern for Francesco Griedolin, that perilous situation with the yellow cards for those two midfielders.\n10:31 Comment: Well, Keison Young is on the bench, he's the obvious replacement if there are any real fears that Idol will pick up a red.\n10:47 Comment: And now, Kyle Norton, Liverpool energised, looking dangerous, Klein, options abound.\n10:55 Comment: A big step from Rangel who come across from right to left to clear for Swansea.\n11:0 Comment: Interesting, Kyle Norton had nothing left in the tank as the ball broke in the right-hand side.\n11:10 Comment: And that is a concern, short of the hour mark, isn't it?\n11:14 Comment: There's been a little legwork, Swansea in the first half.\n11:17 Comment: Mane's got away here.\n11:20 Comment: Down goes Fabianski.\n11:44 Comment: FANS SHOUT OUT\n11:50 Comment: Suddenly the snap and bite has been delivered by the guests here at the Liberty.\n11:55 Comment: And now Klein, Norton thinks, oh no, he backs off.\n12:2 Comment: And Aldon runs into the box, Mane.\n12:8 Comment: Sturridge trying to drag it behind, Henderson.\n12:14 Comment: And Aldon, Coutinho!\n12:18 Comment: And they're at it now, Liverpool.\n12:21 Comment: The manager approves in little wonder, they've found an extra yard now, Liverpool.\n12:26 Comment: Lovely little lay-off here.\n12:29 Comment: Coutinho plays it, follows his pass.\n12:33 Comment: Half a yard the most wide, but only one team playing at the moment, Nasa's side in red.\n12:43 Comment: FANS SHOUT OUT\n12:49 Comment: The red response is irresistible.\n12:59 Comment: The next wave, Mane, Sturridge.\n13:4 Comment: Norton back, and here's Klein, by an Aldon!\n13:7 Comment: Walked away by Van der Horne.\n13:14 Comment: Sigurdsson.\n13:20 Comment: And the penalty at the back for a little bit more protection.\n13:23 Comment: So far it's been Britain sitting with Court and Fair ahead, they could do with two in front.\n13:43 Comment: Norton away, but a gift to Henderson.\n13:49 Comment: Sturridge was waiting, Rangout glances it out for a corner.\n13:54 Comment: Look at that reaction from the Liverpool supporters, they know they're in control of this now.\n14:2 Comment: This is what they've become used to under Jürgen Klopp.\n14:6 Comment: FANS SHOUT OUT\n14:11 Comment: In this corner, Fabianski, Palms, Routledge.\n14:21 Comment: No way out, Coutinho blocks it.\n14:23 Comment: Macamena.\n14:27 Comment: Milner.\n14:29 Comment: Rangout, he's gone through badly, Rangout once and twice to take it away from Milner.\n14:36 Comment: The back comes right up, and here come Liverpool, Lovren.\n15:1 Comment: Zoria Mat.\n15:5 Comment: Mane.\n15:7 Comment: Coutinho.\n15:10 Comment: Palmina.\n15:24 Comment: Sturridge.\n15:27 Comment: Coutinho.\n15:29 Comment: He's going to allow that amount of time and space to pass through to Palmina.\n15:33 Comment: That was blocked.\n15:37 Comment: They just can't get out, those Swansea.\n15:49 Comment: No surprise there's going to be a change here, something needs to change for Swansea.\n15:54 Comment: Are they going to be blown away here?\n16:3 Comment: FANS SHOUT OUT\n16:8 Comment: Routledge off, and Mbappé, Barreiro, the down-deal midfielder comes on.\n16:34 Comment: FANS SHOUT OUT\n16:36 Comment: The telegraphic tells the story of just how active Nathaniel Klain is on the fast side at the moment.\n16:41 Comment: Much to that danger coming down that right-hand side.\n16:44 Comment: Kylian Mbappé having a bit of trouble stemming the tide down there.\n16:58 Comment: Fabinho on the hunt.\n17:4 Comment: FANS SHOUT OUT\n17:10 Comment: Milner.\n17:14 Comment: Good effort from Fabianski, they never get the inside of his foot around it, James Milner.\n17:21 Comment: Another change here for Swansea, this one no surprise at all.\n17:25 Comment: You mentioned this man a moment ago, David, Lee Seung-yong, the South Korean international captain.\n17:32 Comment: Emil Brikken having been booked and with the pace of the game, he is withdrawn from it.\n18:3 Comment: Two quick fast substitutions by Francesco Guidolin to try and plug the gaps.\n18:19 Comment: It's a good chance.\n18:22 Comment: Just shoulder Henderson out of the way.\n18:25 Comment: And then Perron going to wait around for the inquest.\n18:33 Comment: Come on, come on.\n18:45 Comment: Handed out of possession, he's left on the deck as Firmino strides forward.\n18:50 Comment: Coutinho.\n18:52 Comment: Sturridge, couldn't get the contact.\n18:54 Comment: He's got a man really tight on him at the front post, but it's a terrific ball in for Daniel Sturridge.\n19:1 Comment: He's made the right run to the front post.\n19:3 Comment: Swansea screaming for a free kick in the halfway line, but this ball here is going to be much better for Sturridge's front post.\n19:11 Comment: Can't get anything on it.\n19:14 Comment: It's the challenger on Barrow, Michael Horvath actually put a whistle to his lip, then changed his mind.\n19:19 Comment: And Swansea were almost caught out.\n19:22 Comment: Horvath got his head on that one at the near post.\n19:26 Comment: And Corker Ware chased for Barrow up against Clyne.\n19:32 Comment: And Barrow as he went to play the ball, played the man and he's got it.\n19:37 Comment: And it's a good chance for Swansea to get a free kick in the halfway line.\n19:48 Comment: And Barrow as he went to play the ball, played the man and Liverpool have the free kick.\n19:55 Comment: That's the insurance of having Nathaniel Clyne out leaving him at the back there.\n19:59 Comment: And we're going to lose a foot race.\n20:11 Comment: Swansea finding it hard to provide any threat at all here now.\n20:15 Comment: The pattern of the game looks set right now.\n20:20 Comment: To put into context the turnaround, Liverpool were unable to test Lukasz Fabianski at all in the first period.\n20:45 Comment: And it's a good chance for Swansea to get a free kick in the halfway line.\n21:46 Comment: Looking for Milner again.\n21:48 Comment: And that will just trickle behind.\n22:15 Comment: Rare moment of calm in what has been a frantic second half.\n22:22 Comment: Here come Liverpool again.\n22:24 Comment: And Clyne.\n22:30 Comment: Took it in poignantly.\n22:32 Comment: Once again Fabianski.\n22:34 Comment: It is straight at him but it's awkward.\n22:37 Comment: Takes a dip, bounces just in front and he did well to take it in.\n22:40 Comment: And the best compliment you can give Fabianski today is that he's made the awkward look routine.\n22:46 Comment: And he has been called into service in the second half.\n22:49 Comment: Barrow again losing out.\n22:54 Comment: And he's made up for it Barrow by getting back.\n22:56 Comment: Milner, oh, away from Van der Horne.\n22:59 Comment: Back to Mane.\n23:1 Comment: And he's got it.\n23:8 Comment: Going back to Van der Horne.\n23:10 Comment: Back to Mane.\n23:11 Comment: Brilliant block there by Norton to get it behind for a corner.\n23:15 Comment: Much to the relief of van der Horne who's clumsy in the edge of the box.\n23:19 Comment: Can't sort his feet out here.\n23:21 Comment: Liverpool men over at the back post.\n23:25 Comment: And Norton did brilliantly to get Narrow.\n23:29 Comment: He knows that was a real chance.\n23:38 Comment: Liverpool chances in the first half, barely a triple,\n23:46 Comment: there are torrents here in the second.\n23:48 Comment: Still a quarter of the match remaining.\n23:53 Comment: Sturridge!\n23:56 Comment: Good work.\n23:57 Comment: I think it's Kyle Norton who's picking him up,\n23:59 Comment: it's all man-to-man marking here for Swansea.\n24:3 Comment: Kyle Norton just comes back the way towards the penalty spot,\n24:6 Comment: he's got a lot to do from that range.\n24:9 Comment: HEY, YO!\n24:27 Comment: Firmino.\n24:29 Comment: Henderson.\n24:30 Comment: Sturridge.\n24:32 Comment: And the Reds struggling again, but it's not costly on this occasion.\n24:35 Comment: There's nothing sticking for Swansea, nothing at all sticking,\n24:38 Comment: they can't find the striker.\n24:41 Comment: And if they can't find him, they're gonna struggle to get up the pitcher.\n24:50 Comment: And a thundering forward.\n24:54 Comment: Clyde.\n24:57 Comment: Down the right again for Jürgen Klopp's side.\n25:0 Comment: Right to Mane.\n25:8 Comment: Van Aldem.\n25:12 Comment: Henderson.\n25:14 Comment: A bit of midfield zest,\n25:16 Comment: but he's still got the energy to run around a bit\n25:19 Comment: where the others have spent so much in getting Swansea\n25:22 Comment: into the lead in the first half,\n25:24 Comment: and now frantically trying to hold on to get something out of the match.\n25:38 Comment: SQUAD WINS\n25:50 Comment: Parra.\n25:52 Comment: Walter, the only one in the penalty area at the moment,\n25:55 Comment: trying to join in.\n26:3 Comment: Still the best part of 20 minutes to play,\n26:5 Comment: and Francesco Guidoli\n26:7 Comment: is going to make his third and final substitution.\n26:13 Comment: Leroy Fair, who set Swansea on the way with the first-half goal,\n26:17 Comment: will make way here for the young Scottish midfielder, Jay Fulton.\n26:26 Comment: It's not a flexion on first performances, he had a good afternoon.\n26:31 Comment: Nothing, legs and energy in an area where Swansea needed\n26:35 Comment: against this Liverpool side so badly.\n26:37 Comment: Fulton, his first Premier League appearance since Liverpool came here\n26:41 Comment: and lost at the start of May.\n26:48 Comment: He's straining for the action, Fulton,\n26:50 Comment: they take it away from Coutinho.\n26:52 Comment: FULTON SCREAMS\n27:3 Comment: He's lost out.\n27:9 Comment: Sturridge was in a whole load of space.\n27:11 Comment: He was, he's screaming for it, Daniel Sturridge.\n27:14 Comment: That was the pass, and Aldon didn't see him.\n27:22 Comment: FANS SHOUT OUT\n27:40 Comment: Looking for the return, Sturridge very nearly getting it.\n27:43 Comment: Oh, and Farrar slides in.\n27:46 Comment: Corner giver.\n27:47 Comment: Took a big chance and saved the box.\n27:50 Comment: Had to be spot on, looked as if he took plenty of the ball,\n27:53 Comment: but not sure he had to make the tackle.\n27:58 Comment: That's

but eventually Jack Corbett gets out to put the squeeze on.\n34:38 Comment: Not a stage in the game where Swansea may be just a little bit laggy,\n34:41 Comment: not pressing the ball as early on in

here.\n37:25 Comment: Firmino waits in the box, rang out, and Barrow combines a clear.\n37:29 Comment: No, he hasn't managed to do that, Barrow.\n37:32 Comment: This is awkward, this is Firmino, oh, has he fouled that?\n37:35 Comment: He was, penalty.\n37:38 Comment: The creaking defence has given way.\n37:43 Comment: Just as he was getting ready to shoot, Firmino fouled,\n37:47 Comment: and Liverpool with a great chance to win this one now.\n37:50 Comment: Don't think there's much doubt about it, Barrow could have taken a touch there.\n37:55 Comment: Horribly sliced clearance, Boos Wans, in all sorts of bother.\n37:59 Comment: And Achil Rankil just leaning in, clumsy, and Michael Oliver's got no choice there.\n38:8 Comment: Yes!\n38:10 Comment: Now it's Milner time for Liverpool

Guidolin, can't quite believe it.\n38:44 Comment: It looks as if it's slipping away after a terrific effort.\n38:48 Comment: This was a terrific penalty under pressure from James Milner.\n38:52

we all know what those sort of characteristics mean in a side as the season goes on.\n39:26 Comment: One change already made by Liverpool, that was to the stricken Lallana in the first half,\n39:30 Comment: they've got two remaining and they're gonna make them both here.\n39:33 Comment: Emre Can and Teebo Origi both on,\n39:36 Comment: for Ronaldo and Firmino, all smiles as they make their way

Liverpool, and you wouldn't bet against them getting them.\n40:8 Comment: Van der Hoorn away.\n40:18 Comment: Coutinho has to take the shot on, even from the tight angle,\n40:21 Comment: there's nobody else to hit in the box, good ball in,\n40:24 Comment: Sturridge can't get there, but with his first touch he has to take the shot on.\n40:29 Comment: Nothing else on for Coutinho.\n40:33 Comment: Come on!\n40:36 Comment: In black and white it will look like another defeat for Francesco Guidolin and Swansea,\n40:43 Comment: in truth it hasn't been like that at all as far as they're concerned.\n40:48 Comment: Back-to-back home defeats and the failure to pick up a home win,\n40:52 Comment: that doesn't make happy reading for a match that even Ibiguani might have been under

    "summary": "On a crisp afternoon in South Wales, Swansea City faced Liverpool in a Premier League clash that showcased drama, determination, and tactical battles. The Liberty Stadium was buzzing with anticipation as Swansea, seeking their first home win of the season, hosted a high-flying Liverpool side. The atmosphere was electric, with both sets of fans vociferously backing their teams.\n\nAt the start of the game, Swansea's manager Francesco Guidolin was under immense pressure, with his team's performances and results not matching expectations. They hadn't won a Premier League game at home all season and memories were fresh of their last victory on this ground, coincidentally against today's opponents Liverpool, back in May—a game that had slipped into the annals of football history amidst Liverpool's grueling Europa League semi-final ties.\n\nFrom the onset, it was clear that the Liverpool players were pressing high and aggressively. The front three bore down on Swansea's defense like a pack of predators. This relentless pressure forced Swansea to play long balls to relieve their defense, which in many cases led to the turnover of possession. Early signs of encouragement came for Liverpool as they kept their hosts pinned in their half.\n\nSwansea demonstrated spirit and tactical nous, mixing direct play with attempts to control possession. Leroy Fer, the Dutch midfielder, was notably active in stifling Liverpool’s attempts to build any momentum. Around the 8th minute, Fer struck decisively. From a corner delivered deep into the box, Van der Hoorn managed to flick on, with Leroy Fer waiting to pounce. Gathering the dropped ball amidst a crowded six-yard box, Fer capitalized on Liverpool's defensive frailties to poke it into the net. This goal ignited the Swansea faithful, and injected hope into the Liberty Stadium.\n\nLiverpool, however, were undeterred. Their response was swift and sustained. Adam Lallana, who had been a lively figure orchestrating attacks from midfield, unfortunately, had to be substituted due to a groin injury. Daniel Sturridge replaced him, adding another dimension to Liverpool's attacking threat. Lallana’s early departure was a blow, but the relentless red wave continued to mount pressure.\n\nDespite their growing dominance, Liverpool found it challenging to breach Swansea’s well-drilled defense in the first half. The Swans, inspired by their early lead, packed the midfield and formed a steadfast defensive block. Goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski played a crucial role, making critical saves and showing command in his box.\n\nAs halftime approached, Jürgen Klopp’s men were visibly frustrated. The German tactician was animated on the sidelines, urging his players to find solutions to Swansea’s staunch defense. Yet, the first period ended with Swansea holding their slender lead, much to the relief of Guidolin.\n\nThe second half began with Liverpool exhibiting renewed vigor. Sturridge and Mane looked particularly sharp, operating with incisive movements that began to trouble the Swansea back line. In the 54th minute, Liverpool’s perseverance paid off. A free kick won in a dangerous position, just outside the box, offered Coutinho an opportunity. Although his attempt was blocked by the wall, Jordan Henderson swiftly played a lofted ball back into the box, meeting the head of Roberto Firmino, who adeptly directed it past Fabianski to level the score at 1-1. It was a deserved equalizer for Liverpool, who had been the more proactive and attacking side.\n\nSwansea found themselves being pressed intensely again and struggled to maintain possession. The alterations made by Guidolin, bringing on more fresh legs in midfield with Ki Sung-Yueng and Jay Fulton, were attempts to stabilize and regain control. Yet, it was Liverpool who looked increasingly likely to find a winner. Their fluidity in attack and relentless pressing were beginning to show dividends.\n\nWith about six minutes of regular time remaining, Liverpool’s patient build-up indeed bore fruit. A wild clearance from Barrow fell kindly for Firmino, whose movements drew a foul from Angel Rangel in the penalty area. The referee, with no hesitation, pointed to the spot. James Milner, Liverpool’s reliable penalty taker, stepped up to face Fabianski. With nerves of steel, Milner slotted it home, sending Fabianski the wrong way and giving Liverpool a crucial 2-1 lead.\n\nThe closing minutes of the match saw Jurgen Klopp make tactical substitutions to tighten up his midfield and defense. Emre Can and Divock Origi were brought on to provide fresh legs and defensive stability. Swansea, desperate to salvage something from the game, pushed forward but found Liverpool’s defense resolute and organized. Simon Mignolet, although not much troubled, was alert to any potential threats posed by Swansea’s final flurries.\n\nThe game concluded with Liverpool securing a hard-fought 2-1 victory. The scenes at the final whistle were a mixture of jubilation and relief for Liverpool players and fans. It was a win that underscored their resilience and ability to adapt under pressure. For Swansea, the result was a severe blow, intensifying the scrutiny on Guidolin’s tenure.\n\nLooking back, Liverpool’s success was built on their relentless high pressing, tactical adaptability, and clinical finishing in pivotal moments. Swansea, despite their early promise, were unable to maintain their composure and defensive solidity in the face of sustained pressure.\n\nIn summary, this encounter at the Liberty Stadium was a compelling footballing spectacle. It highlighted Swansea’s early dominance and Liverpool’s tactical prowess and resilience. While Swansea’s quest for a home win continued, Liverpool’s triumph bolstered their ambitions to challenge at the top of the Premier League."
