there from Kaput.\n3:40 Comment: Referee and his assistants were in perfect position to see it.\n3:43 Comment: But that's a wonderfully plated ball into a decent area from Old Brighton.\n3:52 Comment: And Ben Owan, who missed the first half of the season.\n3:55 Comment: He had a back injury, which meant that he wasn't even included in Leicester's Premier League squad until January.\n4:10 Comment: Jake Shakespeare took over from Paddy Ranieri in February.\n4:13 Comment: The owners decided to give him the manager's job until the end of the season\n4:17 Comment: on the back of some impressive

he's got.\n9:26 Comment: So it's just enticing.\n9:28 Comment: Yamaha in to try and make the challenge here.\n9:30 Comment: Very fortunate just to get a touch on it there, Yamaha,\n9:33 Comment: to put it out for a corner for Leicester.\n9:37 Comment: All bright on the goal line.\n9:38 Comment: Almost on Gomez's toes.\n9:43 Comment: Ramones was trying to pick out Fuchs.\n9:47 Comment: I think that's one of them set plays that works better\n9:49 Comment: on the training ground than it does live,\n9:51 Comment: as I was told from Mahrez.\n9:54 Comment: Pushed into into the center line and trouble need be\n9:57 Comment: force.\n9:58 Comment: ADAM BEAR had it down to the post,\n10:0 Comment: but had simply failed a change of coach.\n10:2 Comment: Damn, you've got him in there.\n10:4

Chested on by Orbra,\n10:19 Comment: Ben Didick.\n10:22 Comment: He's drink water.\n10:24 Comment: as Christian Fuchs, although Fuchs has drawn a line\n10:26 Comment: now under his international career.\n10:37 Comment: It's fixture last season.\n10:39 Comment: Leicester won 2-1.\n10:41 Comment: Golo Kante scoring first.\n10:44 Comment: Gift from Aurelio Gomes.\n10:45 Comment: Jamie Vardy made it 2-0 from the penalty spot\n10:48 Comment: after another slip by the Watford goalkeeper.\n10:50 Comment: Troy Deeney reducing the deficit from the penalty spot.\n10:58 Comment: It wasn't a particularly good clearance by Gomes.\n11:1 Comment: He didn't really look set or he was comfortable\n11:3 Comment: with the back pass towards him there.\n11:6 Comment: He went back towards his goal and there's a bit of a mis-kick there from Gomes\n11:9 Comment: which should encourage Leicester to close him down at every opportunity.\n11:12 Comment: They are trying to press high up the field, the Leicester players.\n11:15 Comment: And at the moment, Watford are not feeling too comfortable\n11:18 Comment: clearing their lines.\n11:20 Comment: Fuchs.\n11:26 Comment: Now drink water.\n11:28 Comment: All Brighton.\n11:42 Comment: Now there's not enough to earn Watford the free kick.\n11:50 Comment: And it's a good chance for Leicester to win the game.\n11:52 Comment: But it's a good chance for Leicester to win the game.\n11:54 Comment: And it's a good chance for Leicester to win the game.\n11:56 Comment: This is Leicester's first home game in the Premier League\n11:58 Comment: since they defeated relegated Sunderland here at the start of April.\n12:3 Comment: And those four league games have been away from home.\n12:9 Comment: Niak.\n12:12 Comment: Yeah, he's done well there.\n12:14 Comment: Big out of the crossroad.\n12:16 Comment: That area of the field under a bit of pressure.\n12:19 Comment: Poor throw out by Schmeichel.\n12:20 Comment: Amrabat.\n12:24 Comment: Cleverley.\n12:29 Comment: Maybe should have done a little bit better there.\n12:32 Comment: Cleverley.\n12:33 Comment: Set up well.\n12:34 Comment: Came from that throw out there from Schmeichel.\n12:36 Comment: Amrabat.\n12:38 Comment: Haunted to Corey.\n12:39 Comment: And you can see there, Cleverley trying to curl into the far corner.\n12:42 Comment: Got far too much on as he went wide of the target.\n12:44 Comment: Been a bit of a spare in the last couple of minutes for Watford.\n12:47 Comment: I think in the opening 12 minutes of the VAR,\n12:49 Comment: I'd certainly less have been the most.\n12:50 Comment: Dominant side.\n12:55 Comment: Cleverley who returned to Watford on loan from Everton back in January.\n12:59 Comment: It's a move which will be made permanent.\n13:2 Comment: He will be part of Watford's plans next season.\n13:5 Comment: Okaka.\n13:6 Comment: Couldn't quite get there.\n13:8 Comment: I tell you what, his movement's terrific though.\n13:10 Comment: He took Benolan in initially and then just reversed his run to the left-hand side\n13:15 Comment: and Kapoor nearly picked him out with a pass.\n13:17 Comment: Just watch his movement here, Tony.\n13:19 Comment: Great turn from Kapoor.\n13:20 Comment: Takes him in initially.\n13:21 Comment: Then watch his movement to take him away.\n13:23 Comment: The defender's gone to his right.\n13:24 Comment: Left the space on the left-hand side.\n13:26 Comment: A better ball from Kapoor.\n13:27 Comment: And that would have been a decent opportunity for Okaka.\n13:34 Comment: Stefano Okaka who hasn't had too many opportunities this season because of hamstring issues.\n13:46 Comment: To Corey.\n13:50 Comment: Neang.\n13:52 Comment: Neang, much available to him.\n13:55 Comment: He's got better quality there than that.\n14:0 Comment: You can see the disappointment etched on his face.\n14:2 Comment: He's already put one ball in with his left foot which is absolutely fantastic.\n14:6 Comment: Nearly picked out Okaka.\n14:8 Comment: There.\n14:8 Comment: He just dropped his shoulder, fated to go to his left.\n14:11 Comment: Came inside Danny Simpson onto his right.\n14:13 Comment: And there was three Watford players in there so there was options for him.\n14:16 Comment: Over hit it and out for a goal kick.\n14:20 Comment: And the ball is out.\n14:21 Comment: And it's in.\n14:22 Comment: That's a good ball.\n14:23 Comment: Great.\n14:25 Comment: Shakespeare will be delighted with the response that he's seen from Leicester since he took\n14:29 Comment: over from Claudio Ranieri.\n14:36 Comment: Ndidi.\n14:39 Comment: Vardy.\n14:48 Comment: Lovely experiences picked off by Drinkwater.\n14:50 Comment: He's dispossessed by Okaka.\n15:3 Comment: Terrific strengths by Stefano Okaka.\n15:7 Comment: Well it was great strength from Okaka but it was poor play from Robert Huth who really\n15:15 Comment: should have dealt with it when the ball first came to him.\n15:17 Comment: He should have either played it back to his goalkeeper or out for a throw in.\n15:20 Comment: Sort of gambled on it.\n15:22 Comment: Thought he could hold off Okaka.\n15:23 Comment: Was just too strong for him.\n15:30 Comment: Okaka scored a lot of goals in Belgium from Verandale last season.\n15:35 Comment: It's not the first time that he's featured in the Premier League.\n15:38 Comment: He had a time in England previously with Fulham.\n15:50 Comment: We saw many times before the Premier League.\n15:58 Comment: Well video of him alike played a significant role in Liverpool and Blackfella when he hit\n16:3 Comment: me at 11.\n16:4 Comment: That's for now refresh and get the artık tag out.\n16:6 Comment: That's just brilliant.\n16:7 Comment: But surely someone that called in the first few minutes or maybe the only one 1 1 1\n16:13 Comment: 15 ways to say no to a leave sentence in England.\n16:14 Comment: Or you would let that slip.\n16:16 Comment: 普京 0 8 22 16 27 an 8 and in the post-courtesy video he will not continue to play the same\n16:18 Comment: out.\n16:18 Comment: Great Mixoninforma played massively in���de kăl is his cushion 8 to 5.\n16:19 Comment: Luke is throwing out ref, as well a sunny darker colourраш.\n16:20 Comment: Kizaki caught by Jan Mat\n16:25 Comment: Les Derrida to get on with the game\n16:29 Comment: Albrighton\n16:30 Comment: Hey Cavaselli does well in the end here\n16:36 Comment: just his body strength that holds off\n16:38 Comment: Mark Albrighton\n16:39 Comment: great spot wasn't it\n16:40 Comment: the ball played quickly over the top from the set play\n16:43 Comment: nearly caught Watford unawares there\n16:46 Comment: but Cavaselli came back to make a good challenge on Albrighton\n16:48 Comment: given away by Kapoor\n16:51 Comment: Mahrez\n16:52 Comment: he's blocked off by Cleverley\n16:55 Comment: that's where he encourages the challenge to come in there doesn't he Mahrez\n17:3 Comment: what you'd like to see more from him\n17:5 Comment: and where he was so good last season Tony\n17:7 Comment: he was doing things a lot quicker here\n17:9 Comment: he just slowed it down\n17:10 Comment: which is allowing players to come back at him\n17:12 Comment: and make the challenge like we've just seen\n17:13 Comment: yeah he got a free kick from it\n17:14 Comment: but last season he was more dynamic\n17:16 Comment: when he picked the ball up\n17:17 Comment: running it\n17:18 Comment: to play it\n17:18 Comment: and then he got a free kick from the defender's quicker\n17:18 Comment: which created opportunities scoring goals and creating goals\n17:22 Comment: Mahrez and Drinkwater discussing the free kick\n17:32 Comment: Cleverly done by Mahrez\n17:37 Comment: here's Vardy\n17:38 Comment: off the post and out\n17:40 Comment: Okazaki in behind Jamie Vardy\n17:44 Comment: Watford switched off\n17:45 Comment: it was a brilliantly worked free kick\n17:47 Comment: and then he got a free kick\n17:48 Comment: here's Simpson\n17:49 Comment: helped away by Prudel\n17:50 Comment: real wake up call that for Watford\n17:51 Comment: Ok what a great variation for a free kick isn't it\n17:52 Comment: and it was on you could see the space\n17:53 Comment: that was afforded to Jamie Vardy to run into\n17:54 Comment: and Drinkwater's just going to pick him out\n17:55 Comment: with a simple slide rule pass\n17:56 Comment: just watch look at the marking\n17:57 Comment: it was Akaka's picking him up\n17:58 Comment: there's the mismatch\n17:59 Comment: there's the ball across\n18:0 Comment: I think it's Mariapa the dependent might have got the last touch to it\n18:1 Comment: to put it off the line\n18:2 Comment: and then it's a free kick\n18:3 Comment: and it's a free kick\n18:12 Comment: sports talk\n19:12 Comment: Cavaselli\n19:38 Comment: Plenty of possession in the opening 20 minutes\n19:40 Comment: but nothing to show for it as yet\n19:42 Comment: Escape from Mariapol and Watford though\n20:12 Comment: Watford really struggled to get their season into gear\n20:23 Comment: in recent weeks\n20:23 Comment: losing at home to Liverpool on Monday\n20:26 Comment: after they were particularly disappointing\n20:28 Comment: when losing at Hull\n20:30 Comment: up against 10 men for over an hour\n20:34 Comment: of that particular fixture\n20:35 Comment: Niang\n20:36 Comment: now Jan Mads\n20:39 Comment: punched away by Schmeichel\n20:42 Comment: and he was fouled\n20:44 Comment: Ducato getting in ahead of Okaka\n20:48 Comment: I'm not sure about that to be honest\n20:51 Comment: but the ball's been delivered in there\n20:52 Comment: I think Decorey's got every right to go for it\n20:55 Comment: and has he done an awful lot wrong there?\n20:57 Comment: In the end he might have caught the goalkeeper\n20:58 Comment: but he can't make himself invisible Tony\n21:0 Comment: in situations like that\n21:1 Comment: Kasper Schmeichel's got a good fist on the ball\n21:4 Comment: he's cleared the danger\n21:4 Comment: and you can see him\n21:5 Comment: how frustrated Decorey was\n21:7 Comment: because he didn't feel he'd done an awful lot wrong\n21:9 Comment: and I tend to agree with him\n21:12 Comment: yet I've done it quite often\n21:13 Comment: but I've never seen clearly\n21:15 Comment: where Casey Spear's\n21:18 Comment: not so committed\n21:19 Comment: by some two wingers\n21:21 Comment: I think Monca SWAC\n21:23 Comment: would never think\n21:24 Comment: you were standing in front of Sayed\n21:26 Comment:

Comment: Amrabat\n21:58 Comment: Good run by Amrabat\n22:1 Comment: Now prepared to take on Fuchs\n22:12 Comment: Perhaps isn't the intensity that either\n22:19 Comment: Craig Shakespeare or Walter Mansari\n22:21 Comment: would have wanted from their teams\n22:22 Comment: I don't think it's been that bad to be honest\n22:24 Comment: I think there's intent from both teams\n22:26 Comment: You've seen Gammat\n22:28 Comment: the left wing back for Watford\n22:29 Comment: and Amrabat the right wing back there\n22:31 Comment: getting forward whenever possible\n22:32 Comment: Maybe the final ball in from Amrabat\n22:35 Comment: could have been a bit better\n22:36 Comment: There was an overload for Watford\n22:38 Comment: down there right the left of Leicester\n22:41 Comment: and it was just that final ball\n22:42 Comment: that wasn't quite there\n22:43 Comment: There's enough bodies getting forward for Watford\n22:44 Comment: Nian\n22:46 Comment: Amrabat\n22:51 Comment: Three to pick

Comment: Well they've come close to conceding\n23:28 Comment: one on goal in the first half\n23:29 Comment: that was nearly a second\n23:30 Comment: Yeah this is all about the quality\n23:31 Comment: of the delivery wasn't it\n23:32 Comment: from Christian Fuchs\n23:33 Comment: into a decent area\n23:34 Comment: trying to pick out Jamie Vardy\n23:36 Comment: Cavaselli with a mere\n23:37 Comment: touch he's on it\n23:38 Comment: and the goalkeeper here\n23:39 Comment: had to react quickly to it\n23:40 Comment: to get across these legs there\n23:41 Comment: and he's got the ball\n23:42 Comment: to the left hand side\n23:43 Comment: to make the save\n23:44 Comment: All Brighton with a corner kick\n23:55 Comment: away by Prudel\n24:1 Comment: Cleverly\n24:2 Comment: De Corre\n24:19 Comment: De

patient\n24:55 Comment: you know\n24:56 Comment: gone from a central position\n24:57 Comment: down to that right hand side\n24:58 Comment: good running off the ball\n24:59 Comment: from Niang\n25:0 Comment: but just when you need\n25:1 Comment: a better quality\n25:1 Comment: I'm not quite sure\n25:3 Comment: what he's thinking here\n25:3 Comment: I think he just came off\n25:4 Comment: his left foot\n25:5 Comment: before he went to put in\n25:6 Comment: with his right\n25:7 Comment: would just put him off slightly\n25:8 Comment: and obviously the chance\n25:10 Comment: had gone as far as\n25:10 Comment: Watford's concerned\n25:11 Comment: but I think\n25:13 Comment: he'll be reasonably happy\n25:14 Comment: with what he's seen\n25:15 Comment: in the last 10 minutes\n25:15 Comment: certainly\n25:16 Comment: Leicester were the better side\n25:17 Comment: in the opening 10 minutes\n25:19 Comment: of the game\n25:19 Comment: but once they've got\n25:22 Comment: a better movement\n25:22 Comment: and when they pass the ball\n25:23 Comment: quickly Watford\n25:24 Comment: they look a different side\n25:25 Comment: certainly Leicester\n25:26 Comment: just struggling to

he should have played it into\n26:40 Comment: Niang a lot earlier than he did there\n26:42 Comment: and then he comes inside\n26:43 Comment: and now he's not really got an option\n26:45 Comment: he's just trying to flight the ball over the top\n26:47 Comment: Niang never wanted to do so\n26:49 Comment: and it absolutely went into the arms of\n26:51 Comment: Kasper Schmeichel\n26:51 Comment: a bit wasteful over that right hand side\n26:54 Comment: Amrabat another of those\n26:57 Comment: who's easing his way back after injury\n26:59 Comment: an uncle problem which\n27:1 Comment: kept him out of

Comment: with the height in this Watford team\n31:41 Comment: you know you're looking at Okaka, Niang, Kapu, Prado, Mariapa, Cabaselli\n31:46 Comment: why for me they don't just put a ball into the box\n31:49 Comment: and just get men forward\n31:50 Comment: it's the retaining possession\n31:51 Comment: but look where they've gone\n31:52 Comment: they've gone from inside the lesser half\n31:54 Comment: all the way back\n31:55 Comment: 20-30 yards from their own goal\n31:57 Comment: I don't quite know the reason for that\n31:59 Comment: Plevely\n32:2 Comment: and they're trying to get in

Comment: expect a bit better\n33:14 Comment: I know he's on his weaker left foot\n33:16 Comment: but you're still expecting a better cross\n33:18 Comment: all came from Kapu\n33:19 Comment: taking too long in possession of the ball\n33:21 Comment: bundled over by Robert Huth fairly\n33:24 Comment: said the referee\n33:25 Comment: but he's got options in the box\n33:26 Comment: he's got Vardy making the run to the near post\n33:28 Comment: Okazaki coming in at the far post\n33:30 Comment: there's options for him\n33:31 Comment: and he's just hit it\n33:33 Comment: with no real intent to pick out one of his teammates\n33:36 Comment: and the chance had gone\n33:36 Comment: Roger East has just revisited that\n33:41 Comment: coming together between Huth and Kapu\n33:44 Comment: Tom Plevely has also got involved\n33:48 Comment: well he won the ball didn't he initially\n33:50 Comment: he's won it again\n33:51 Comment: and then it's the momentum\n33:52 Comment: that's seen Kapu go over the top of Robert Huth\n33:55 Comment: totally agree with the referee\n33:57 Comment: I thought he got that decision absolutely right\n33:59 Comment: happy to explain his decision as well to all concerned\n34:6 Comment: After a wait at Boston\n34:9 Comment: Sampson Lowell\n34:12 Comment: Duarte\n34:14 Comment: up and the ball is shorter\n34:16 Comment: and Redman\n34:19 Comment: this moves

Okazaki.\n34:54 Comment: It's going to be a Watford throw.\n34:57 Comment: Patient build-up there, but no question of where you're going.\n35:0 Comment: What you're trying to achieve in that final third.\n35:3 Comment: You don't see a great deal from the Leicester players.\n35:6 Comment: I think Greg Shakespeare will be disappointed\n35:9 Comment: what he's seen in the last 25 minutes of this game,\n35:12 Comment: where he's seen his side allow Watford to dominate possession\n35:15 Comment: and really get a foothold in this game.\n35:22 Comment: Jan Mats.\n35:26 Comment: Now Cleverley.\n35:28 Comment: Good save by Schmeichel.\n35:33 Comment: OK.\n35:33 Comment: Okazaki was in an offside position.\n35:36 Comment: But real venom in the shot from Tom Cleverley,\n35:39 Comment: which is well dabbled by Kasper Schmeichel.\n35:41 Comment: Yeah, well, just look at this.\n35:42 Comment: Throw-up from Ndidi.\n35:44 Comment: Cleverley's onto it.\n35:45 Comment: That's a really good strike,\n35:46 Comment: and that's an excellent save from Kasper Schmeichel\n35:48 Comment: going across to his right-hand side to get two hands on it.\n35:53 Comment: You can clearly see that Okazaki was in an offside position\n35:56 Comment: with a follow-up.\n36:3 Comment: With great precision by Tom Cleverley.\n36:8 Comment: And his second spell with Watford.\n36:10 Comment: He joined them initially when he was a youngster with Manchester United.\n36:15 Comment: Okazaki bundled over.\n36:18 Comment: What a needless free kick that is to give away by Frodo\n36:22 Comment: in such a dangerous area.\n36:23 Comment: I mean, Okazaki's gone nowhere.\n36:25 Comment: He's just thankful to control it,\n36:27 Comment: and you can see the centre-half coming in.\n36:28 Comment: He's got both arms around him.\n36:31 Comment: The assistant referee's looking straight at it,\n36:33 Comment: as was the referee.\n36:35 Comment: And this is Mahrez's territory, isn't it?\n36:37 Comment: You've got to make sure here,\n36:39 Comment: if you're Gomez, that you get your wall absolutely spot-on.\n36:59 Comment: Mahrez's favourite to take this free kick,\n37:2 Comment: but Christian Fuchs is also,\n37:3 Comment: having a look at it.\n37:6 Comment: I wouldn't be put off with Danny Drinkwater taking it either,\n37:9 Comment: just bending it around.\n37:10 Comment: I mean, there's a gap between the wall and Janmaat.\n37:13 Comment: There's a big space there that they could utilise.\n37:17 Comment: It's Mahrez.\n37:18 Comment: The wall has done its job.\n37:21 Comment: Makaka turned his back on the ball, but did enough.\n37:33 Comment: Foul.\n37:44 Comment: Taken short by Albrighton, helped on by Drinkwater.\n37:47 Comment: And thanked in by Ndidi.\n37:52 Comment: Wilfred Ndidi makes the breakthrough for Leicester.\n37:56 Comment: Change of approach with a corner kick routine.\n37:59 Comment: And it has produced Leicester's opening goal.\n38:3 Comment: I've got to say, Tony, there's been variation in the set-play from Leicester today.\n38:7 Comment: We've seen that shot where he kicked the drink water,\n38:9 Comment: played into the path of Vardy,\n38:11 Comment: when Mariapa put it onto his own post,\n38:14 Comment: and they've done a similar thing here.\n38:15 Comment: Switched off.\n38:17 Comment: Amrabat's got to get there quicker than he did.\n38:19 Comment: Trodden with a touch.\n38:20 Comment: Kapoor at the back post has got to clear the danger.\n38:22 Comment: He didn't. He played it into the path of Venditti,\n38:25 Comment: and he absolutely rifled it past Gomez.\n38:28 Comment: Nothing the keeper could do to keep that one out.\n38:30 Comment: But from Watford's point of view,\n38:32 Comment: switched off all over the park there,\n38:35 Comment: and they've been punished for that strike from Venditti.\n38:43 Comment: 20-year-old arrived at Leicester back in January.\n38:53 Comment: Leicester City 1, Watford 0.\n38:59 Comment: And that's so soon.\n39:0 Comment: I've got to say,\n39:0 Comment: Leicester's got to keep up with the game.\n39:0 Comment: Tom Cleverley had almost put Watford in front,\n39:3 Comment: a magnificent save by Kasper Speichel\n39:6 Comment: to keep out Cleverley's effort.\n39:18 Comment: Drink water.\n39:20 Comment: The warning signs were there for Watford early on\n39:23 Comment: with that free-kick routine,\n39:25 Comment: which almost produced an opening goal for Leicester.\n39:30 Comment: When you think about it,\n39:31 Comment: when he actually came initially from the challenge by Prodo on Okazaki,\n39:35 Comment: when there was no need to give away the free-kick,\n39:37 Comment: from that set play,\n39:38 Comment: Marius hits it off the wall behind for a corner,\n39:41 Comment: then they don't pick up inside the 18-yard box,\n39:43 Comment: they leave drink water free,\n39:44 Comment: and then they were punished for it.\n39:53 Comment: Young lad was offside.\n39:58 Comment: That's lazy.\n39:59 Comment: Lazy from his point of view.\n40:0 Comment: I mean, he should have seen that Cleverley had picked up possession of the ball\n40:4 Comment: and got himself into an onside position,\n40:6 Comment: but just caught ball-watching, if you like.\n40:10 Comment: Didn't realise that he was beyond the last defender there.\n40:15 Comment: He won't mind, indeed.\n40:17 Comment: Quite an athletic midfielder.\n40:18 Comment: He's the one, really, that's been getting forward.\n40:20 Comment: Danny Drinkwater's been sitting a little bit deeper than he's been pushing on,\n40:23 Comment: trying to get closer to Okazaki and Jamie Vardy,\n40:26 Comment: but he came at the stage of the game where he said,\n40:28 Comment: Watford probably were the better team at that,\n40:30 Comment: and they just did.\n40:47 Comment: Given away by Mariapa.\n40:51 Comment: Albrighton.\n40:53 Comment: Here's Mahrez.\n40:56 Comment: Brilliantly done by Mahrez.\n41:0 Comment: Gomes was beaten and the ball has been deflected out for a corner\n41:3 Comment: off the top of the crossbar.\n41:5 Comment: I'll tell you what, this is what this lad can do.\n41:7 Comment: He's got brilliant ability.\n41:8 Comment: He just fakes the hit of his left, cuts inside,\n41:10 Comment: takes the strike on with his right.\n41:12 Comment: I think it comes off Cleverley, onto the crossbar.\n41:14 Comment: You can see Gomes, he's beaten.\n41:16 Comment: Just in mirrors of touches from Cleverley.\n41:17 Comment: Look at the goalkeeper actually watching it at the top of the crossbar\n41:20 Comment: and over for another corner for Leicester.\n41:22 Comment: GOME!\n43:1 Comment: Kepa Sele getting above Okazaki.\n43:8 Comment: He's in the wrong position, though, Tony.\n43:10 Comment: He's marking behind him instead of in front of him that occasion.\n43:13 Comment: He's very fortunate to get away with it.\n43:14 Comment: But just watching Mahrez now when he picks the ball up,\n43:17 Comment: you watch cleverly he's coming out alongside Jan Matz.\n43:19 Comment: He's got two V1 situations.\n43:21 Comment: That's why he's trying to pick out one of his teammates with a pass,\n43:23 Comment: as he did there for Simpson, to deliver the ball into the box.\n43:26 Comment: Huge throw by Fuchs, which was helped on by Vardy.\n43:34 Comment: Straight into the arms of Gomez.\n43:48 Comment: Just clipped by Ndidi.\n43:54 Comment: He's a big, strong lad, isn't he?\n43:56 Comment: OK.\n43:56 Comment: I think what Watford should be trying to do now\n43:59 Comment: is get the ball played into his feet.\n44:0 Comment: He's got the strength to hold off the two centre-halves of Leicester.\n44:3 Comment: Then you need runners running off of him,\n44:6 Comment: like a Kapu, a Niang, or even Cleverley.\n44:9 Comment: Players get in advanced positions to get beyond them,\n44:11 Comment: but he could be the fulcrum in that central position.\n44:15 Comment: Kapu.\n44:22 Comment: Jan Matz.\n44:26 Comment: Way by Drinkwater.\n44:29 Comment: Watford looking for a corner kick, but it will be a goal kick.\n44:34 Comment: Well, they've done well to keep the ball alive in the box here for Watford players.\n44:39 Comment: Not a particularly good header out there from Drinkwater.\n44:42 Comment: Mariapa onto Okaka, who thought the last touch had came off Robert Huth, who was closest to him.\n44:48 Comment: And to see clearly from that replay who got the last touch on it.\n44:53 Comment: But he could be a threat.\n44:54 Comment: They just need to get better ball up to him,\n44:56 Comment: where he can hold off the centre-halves and bring the midfielders into play.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: it's in Kapoor gets the ball rolling at the start of the second half\n0:5 Comment: Leicester City in front that goal from Wilfred and Didi\n0:10 Comment: Leicester champions back in May of last year, it's actually a year to this week that they were\n0:17 Comment: confirmed as champions after Tottenham missed out at Chelsea and Leicester said\n0:25 Comment: goodbye to the Premier League trophy this week, Craig Shakespeare made it absolutely clear that he\n0:30 Comment: didn't want the players to kiss the trophy goodbye because thinking\n0:34 Comment: positively wants to hope that one day Leicester will be able to to claim the\n0:38 Comment: title back. We'll wait and have to see on that Tony but just looking at Watford\n0:43 Comment: it looks like they made a subtle change looks like they've got here back four\n0:46 Comment: Cavaselli looks like it's going into a right-back position\n0:48 Comment: Amrabat's pushing further up the field so there's plenty of encouragement for Watford in\n0:53 Comment: that first half but what they have to\n0:55 Comment: do is make sure from set plays they switch on, caught out twice in that first\n0:59 Comment: half, Mahrez with the slide rule pass through for Jamie Vardy when he played\n1:5 Comment: across the face of the goal and Mari Apo put it on his own post and then they\n1:10 Comment: conceded from a set play when they switched off allowing Drinkwater to\n1:13 Comment: deliver the ball in and a couple of mistakes one by Prodo the other by Kapoor\n1:16 Comment: allowed indeedy to get a strike at goal beyond Gomez in the goal which gave\n1:20 Comment: Leicester that one goal advantage at half-time.

Comment: Okaka not too happy with Amrabat.\n2:31 Comment: He felt he could have played the ball in a lot quicker into the box.\n2:35 Comment: Niang was in there, as was Okaka.\n2:37 Comment: Just about the quality in that final third from Watford hasn't been quite there so far.\n2:41 Comment: Looked away by Simpson at the expense of a throw.\n3:4 Comment: Janmat with the throw.\n3:8 Comment: Looked away first by Simpson and then Mahrez.\n3:11 Comment: Looked away.\n3:13 Comment: Pressing by Vardy, putting the pressure on Mariapa.\n3:18 Comment: Mariapa is now in his second spell with Watford.\n3:20 Comment: He hasn't had much of a look in this season but because of Watford's many injuries he's started three of their last four in the Premier League.\n3:28 Comment: Look.\n3:39 Comment: Too sophisticated.\n3:41 Comment: Too sophisticated about Prudel's attempts to get the ball forward.\n3:46 Comment: Okazaki.\n3:48 Comment: Now Vardy.\n3:50 Comment: It's Jamie Vardy.\n3:52 Comment: It's a good save by Gomez.\n3:56 Comment: Excellent goalkeeper from Aurelio Gomez.\n3:59 Comment: But the movement from Vardy is excellent, isn't it?\n4:1 Comment: To get in behind Trudeau.\n4:4 Comment: Okazaki with a little slide through pass.\n4:7 Comment: He's got away from him.\n4:7 Comment: Took the shot on early with his left foot.\n4:9 Comment: Hit it across.\n4:11 Comment: The goalkeeper who made a good save initially and quick reactions to get back up.\n4:16 Comment: Get the second ball there from Gomez.\n4:21 Comment: Tremendous economy of effort from Jamie Vardy this season.\n4:25 Comment: 12 goals in the Premier League from 19 shots on target.\n4:29 Comment: Make that now 20.\n4:31 Comment: Good save by Aurelio Gomez.\n4:34 Comment: And a bat.\n4:34 Comment: Yes.\n4:38 Comment: Vardy again on the move.\n4:40 Comment: See that half.\n4:40 Comment: Chance at the other end of the field though.\n4:42 Comment: Comes from the ball played into the feet of Okaka.\n4:45 Comment: Who holds off the defender.\n4:46 Comment: Now he's looking for a runner.\n4:47 Comment: He had one in Amri back.\n4:48 Comment: He played it into his path.\n4:49 Comment: Just his final touch there as he was trying to go through there.\n4:52 Comment: Let him down.\n4:53 Comment: But it certainly is the way forward for Watford to get themselves back into this game.\n4:57 Comment: Is play it into the feet of Okaka.\n4:59 Comment: And then get runners running off of him.\n5:4 Comment: Troy Deeney.\n5:5 Comment: One of those limbering up currently for Watford on the far side.\n5:8 Comment: He suggested it at half time.\n5:10 Comment: I know that that might be an alternative for Wouter Moutsari to...\n5:15 Comment: ...to bring on Deeney alongside Okaka.\n5:18 Comment: Well, he could change his tactics.\n5:19 Comment: I mean at the moment it's a 4-3-3 formation that he's playing.\n5:22 Comment: Niang on the left of the other three alongside Okaka in the central position.\n5:26 Comment: Amrabat on the right.\n5:28 Comment: But there is scope for him to change it to a 4-4-2.\n5:32 Comment: Amrabat.\n5:36 Comment: Okaka.\n5:39 Comment: Swellman.\n5:40 Comment: Hold his ground.\n5:40 Comment: Actually, he was an excellent defender from Berlawan\n5:45 Comment: as it was delivered in here.\n5:47 Comment: Niang onto Amrabat,\n5:48 Comment: and he's dug out a lovely ball to the back post,\n5:50 Comment: and you're expecting Okaka to come above the defender\n5:53 Comment: and get his header on target.\n5:54 Comment: I think he's a little bit hesitant here, Okaka.\n5:56 Comment: I think if he really goes and attacks it,\n5:59 Comment: I think he gets a better purchase on it,\n6:0 Comment: and that would have been a lot more difficult\n6:2 Comment: for Schmeichel in the goal.\n6:4 Comment: He's just sort of shied away from it,\n6:6 Comment: which allowed the defender just to back into him\n6:8 Comment: to put him off.\n6:10 Comment: He's got to be careful.\n6:34 Comment: Caposelli.\n6:40 Comment: The season has been somewhat disjointed.\n6:51 Comment: One of the highs there, win at Arsenal.\n6:53 Comment: Two goals in three minutes\n6:56 Comment: through Younes Kaboul and Troy Deeney.\n6:58 Comment: They thumped 6-1 at Liverpool on their travels as well,\n7:1 Comment: their heaviest ever Premier League defeat.\n7:7 Comment: Kapu.\n7:9 Comment: And that with Simpson.\n7:16 Comment: Leicester sometimes at their most effective\n7:18 Comment: when they back off and they invite the opposition on.\n7:22 Comment: Yeah, absolutely.\n7:23 Comment: They encourage the opposition on,\n7:24 Comment: so then they can hit them on the counter,\n7:25 Comment: attack with pace,\n7:26 Comment: and the team, certainly with Jamie Vardy,\n7:29 Comment: as we've seen a little bit earlier on,\n7:31 Comment: when he got free down that left-hand side\n7:33 Comment: with that through ball,\n7:34 Comment: hit it across the goalkeeper,\n7:35 Comment: good save from Gomez.\n7:41 Comment: Don't let him see you,\n8:0 Comment: Leicester, leicester.\n8:0 Comment: willen.\n8:0 Comment: One of the main حل с ca.,\n8:1

I\n9:42 Comment: think, I thought they had the better\n9:44 Comment: of it in the first half, to be honest.\n9:46 Comment: I thought they'd look more likely to get the opening goal\n9:48 Comment: and because they switched off from a set play\n9:50 Comment: they were undone by that.

They go out and close them down, so they allow them to\n10:32 Comment: take the short corner quickly\n10:34 Comment: and then all of a sudden, there's danger\n10:36 Comment: inside the box when there shouldn't be any.\n10:38 Comment: And that's just down to the discipline,\n10:40 Comment: getting out there quickly, making sure of a\n10:42 Comment: 2v2 situation, you're on top of it,\n10:44 Comment: not allowing Leicester the freedom\n10:46 Comment: to deliver the ball in the manner that they did.\n10:52 Comment: Vardy, offside,\n10:54 Comment: disputes that decision.\n10:56 Comment: It's not easy for Harry Leonard, the assistant\n10:57 Comment: on the far side, to work out\n10:59 Comment: the position of the attackers, given\n11:1 Comment: the markings of the pitch\n11:4 Comment: or the cuts of the grass at the King Power.\n11:6 Comment: Something which is going to be outlawed\n11:8 Comment: by the Premier League next season.\n11:10 Comment: There'll have to be straight lines.\n11:16 Comment: You can see where the issue lies.\n11:24 Comment: At least it's not the tartan look\n11:26 Comment: which we sometimes get.\n11:28 Comment: It's awful, isn't it? Let's be honest about it.\n11:30 Comment: Brutally, it's awful. I don't know what they're\n11:31 Comment: thinking.\n11:31 Comment: The green keepers here\n11:33 Comment: at the King Power Stadium are thinking about\n11:35 Comment: just Watford are really keeping their width\n11:37 Comment: at the moment.\n11:41 Comment: That shouldn't really happen. He's just apologising\n11:43 Comment: to his teammates there, because that's just lazy.\n11:46 Comment: That's not keeping up with play, that's not thinking\n11:47 Comment: about...\n11:50 Comment: The last defender is\n11:51 Comment: making sure that he's\n11:53 Comment: ahead of him in an onside position, but\n11:55 Comment: Amrabat, from changing from a\n11:57 Comment: right wing back to a right winger,\n11:59 Comment: he's really keeping his width. He's just moved\n12:1 Comment: infield at the moment.\n12:1 Comment: When Watford have got the ball, he's keeping his\n12:3 Comment: width and discipline over this right-hand\n12:5 Comment: side, and that would be up to the likes of Cleverley,\n12:8 Comment: Decorey or Kapui in that\n12:9 Comment: central area, get on the ball and change\n12:11 Comment: the ball over to the right-hand side or\n12:13 Comment: the left-hand side to pick out him on the end.\n12:15 Comment: Here's Mahrez.\n12:17 Comment: Second goal for Leicester.\n12:22 Comment: A slip, punished\n12:24 Comment: immediately by Rian Mahrez.\n12:27 Comment: Perhaps\n12:27 Comment: hasn't been at his best this season,\n12:29 Comment: but given the chance, presented\n12:31 Comment: the chance,\n12:31 Comment: there by Watford,\n12:34 Comment: he was eager to punish\n12:35 Comment: them. Two now for Leicester.\n12:38 Comment: Surely now they've done enough.\n12:40 Comment: Well, it looks that way, Tony.\n12:41 Comment: Watford have only got themselves to blame here.\n12:43 Comment: I mean, what are they thinking about?\n12:46 Comment: Here's Vardy with a flick on.\n12:47 Comment: Marriap has got to deal with it. He doesn't. He plays it\n12:49 Comment: straight into the path of Mahrez,\n12:51 Comment: who comes in, gets away from Frodo\n12:53 Comment: and then just stabs it with his left\n12:55 Comment: foot beyond the goalkeeper, Gomez.\n12:57 Comment: A huge mistake there. He went with his right\n12:59 Comment: foot. Instead, he's left Marriap.\n13:1 Comment: Which allows Mahrez in. Look at Frodo coming\n13:3 Comment: back to try and make a challenge.\n13:5 Comment: There's the toe poke from Mahrez\n13:7 Comment: through the legs of Gomez\n13:10 Comment: to double the lead for Leicester.\n13:11 Comment: But Watford, they've switched\n13:14 Comment: off twice in this game and they've gave away two\n13:16 Comment: goals.\n13:21 Comment: The sixth goal in the Premier League this season for\n13:23 Comment: Rian Mahrez.\n13:26 Comment: And it's come in his 100th Premier League game.\n13:31 Comment: Now scoring three successive games against Watford.\n13:35 Comment: Got a penalty when Leicester were beaten at\n13:38 Comment: Vicarage Road 2-1 back in November.\n13:42 Comment: And that really was a gift.\n13:44 Comment: Well, it was initially. I mean, Vardy's under no\n13:47 Comment: pressure with the flick on. Marriap doesn't deal with it.\n13:50 Comment: You know, there, what should have happened, Marriap\n13:52 Comment: should have cleared it with his opposite foot.\n13:54 Comment: He wasn't confident or comfortable doing it.\n13:56 Comment: He's played it into the path of Mahrez.\n13:58 Comment: He's come in field and he wasn't going to miss from there.\n14:0 Comment: Straight through the legs of the goalkeeper.\n14:1 Comment: But Watford after a really bright start to the second half,\n14:5 Comment: they were a little threatening.\n14:7 Comment: All of a sudden, they're right off against it now to get\n14:9 Comment: themselves back into this game.\n14:12 Comment: Jan Mat.\n14:24 Comment: Akaka.\n14:29 Comment: Amrabat.\n14:31 Comment: Cleverly.\n14:45 Comment: Amrabat.\n14:47 Comment: Amrabat trying to turn away from Fuchs.\n15:1 Comment: Jan Mat. Taking on Simpson.\n15:4 Comment: See the ball nicked away by Mahrez.\n15:8 Comment: Ndidi.\n15:9 Comment: Okazaki.\n15:11 Comment: Vardy ready to bounce. Here is Jamie Vardy.\n15:15 Comment: Mahrez unmarked.\n15:18 Comment: It's Mahrez.\n15:22 Comment: Dakota there to tidy up for Watford.\n15:27 Comment: Well, that's what you're saying, Tony, with this Leicester side.\n15:29 Comment: How quickly they turn defence into attack.\n15:31 Comment: Watford have got numbers forward, but then they got punished.\n15:34 Comment: Going the opposite way.\n15:36 Comment: It was a lovely ball, you know, from Vardy to pick out Mahrez at the bar post.\n15:40 Comment: But the amount of ground Okazaki made up was incredible.\n15:44 Comment: He must have made up 40 yards.\n15:45 Comment: And Mahrez trying to pick him out with a little reverse ball.\n15:48 Comment: Just under hit it.\n15:49 Comment: But that was a great counter attack from Leicester.\n16:1 Comment: That's the second half since getting that second goal have started to show a little bit\n16:9 Comment: of their old swagger.\n16:10 Comment: Amrabat.\n16:11 Comment: Seen a lot of the ball in the second half.\n16:21 Comment: Niang.\n16:22 Comment: Okazaki has been fondled of it.\n16:25 Comment: That might be his last involvement because Leicester are poised to make a comeback.\n16:26 Comment: But it's not.\n16:27 Comment: It's a good game.\n16:31 Comment: He's taking a break here.\n16:32 Comment: He has to make a change.\n16:33 Comment: As Lance Levani is ready to come on.\n16:34 Comment: The great reception from Okazaki, who is going off.\n16:38 Comment: He's not always out catching, but the work rate is absolutely phenomenal from this player.\n16:48 Comment: And I think epitomized with his last run that he made forward when he made up 40, 50\n16:56 Comment: yards to get inside the box to help out and try your best to catch him.\n17:1 Comment: Let's go then.\n17:1 Comment: on the end of that ball played back by Mahrez.\n17:14 Comment: Okazaki off to be replaced by Islam Slimani.\n17:21 Comment: On the bench for the win over West Bromwich Albion.\n17:26 Comment: Mahrez.\n17:28 Comment: Mahrez again.\n17:31 Comment: Off to the way by Mariapa.\n17:40 Comment: Okaka.\n17:42 Comment: Struck to the ground by Benel Juan.\n17:47 Comment: You would think now that Watford must be thinking about bringing on a substitute.\n17:50 Comment: Troy Deeney.\n17:51 Comment: Just go with two up front.\n17:52 Comment: I mean they've lost three of the last four matches in their league Tony.\n17:55 Comment: They need something to change.\n17:57 Comment: They need something to go in their favour.\n17:59 Comment: You know the shape at the moment.\n18:0 Comment: It hasn't worked in the sense they haven't created an awful lot of opportunities with the possession that they had.\n18:6 Comment: Defensively they gave away two really poor goals.\n18:8 Comment: They need something to happen and happen quickly.\n18:11 Comment: And I think it would be better, say, of bringing on another striker to help out.\n18:21 Comment: Brutal.\n18:30 Comment: At Sangio.\n18:33 Comment: Take care.\n18:37 Comment: A lovely strikeke went around that corner.\n18:39 Comment: Keolic and coming into the position.\n18:42 Comment: Back to Houston and away is Blackford.\n18:44 Comment: They're going to win the game for ANDREW LONG enchirk efler XD\n18:48 Comment: I'll catch up right after ilos win.\n18:54 Comment: I'll roll for thetak gyczees, bioução.\n18:55 Comment: I have the day pee, meal,\n18:58 Comment: their game over pickediing that bell.\n19:0 Comment: Has an apparently chiptone name there.\n19:0 Comment: I think I'm giving Gomez the scare.\n19:5 Comment: It wasn't what he was intending,\n19:6 Comment: but he did eventually drift out for a goal kick.\n19:10 Comment: A great attitude, isn't he, Mark Albright?\n19:12 Comment: One of them 100%ers.\n19:14 Comment: You know exactly what you're going to get from him,\n19:15 Comment: game in, game out.\n19:16 Comment: We see this goal again.\n19:17 Comment: Mariaco with a mistake.\n19:18 Comment: Sure clear that he's left, Wempe's right.\n19:20 Comment: Marius is in.\n19:21 Comment: Proto comes across and just nutmegs the goalkeeper.\n19:24 Comment: Just a little toe punt beyond the goalkeeper,\n19:27 Comment: into the back of the net to double the lead for Leicester.\n19:30 Comment: Leicester have made one change.\n19:33 Comment: They're poised to make a second.\n19:35 Comment: Andy King is ready to come on.\n19:40 Comment: Watford want to bring on Troy Deeney.\n19:50 Comment: Indeedy.\n19:54 Comment: Albright.\n19:55 Comment: Vardy again on the move.\n20:0 Comment: Martis picked out by Vardy.\n20:5 Comment: Drink water available.\n20:12 Comment: Watford doubling up.\n20:14 Comment: That stood his ground,\n20:15 Comment: and in the end it was De Correa who was able to complete the clearance.\n20:28 Comment: Goal!\n20:30 Comment: No!\n20:33 Comment: A실 Shalley scores out on A Tigers audience on Sunday.\n20:39 Comment: Canon haters.\n20:39 Comment: Olaf

whatsoever.\n21:4 Comment: Initially, you felt they'd been out for a corner.\n21:7 Comment: There were two players up against them.\n21:10 Comment: Danny Brinkmore is getting a rest now.\n21:13 Comment: Another player for Leicester City,\n21:17 Comment: who maybe this season hasn't been at his best\n21:19 Comment: compared to what he achieved last season,\n21:21 Comment: but he's still such a willing worker in midfield for his side.\n21:26 Comment: Once again, another player that gives you absolutely everything,\n21:29 Comment: game in, game out.\n21:30 Comment: Andy King on for Leicester.\n21:32 Comment: Troy Deeney on for Watford, having placed Etienne Capoue.\n21:46 Comment: Troy Deeney actually went to the Watford supporters\n21:48 Comment: who'd made the trip to Hull a couple of weeks back\n21:51 Comment: to have a conversation with them after the final whistle.\n21:55 Comment: The supporters are happy with the way in which their team\n21:58 Comment: had performed against 10-0.\n22:0 Comment: The men for over an hour.\n22:4 Comment: Watford beating 2-0 and losing 2-0 at the King Power.\n22:7 Comment: Watford.\n22:19 Comment: Just look at Troy Deeney there, just in the amour back.\n22:21 Comment: You've got to do it quicker, shift the ball quicker.\n22:23 Comment: He's picking up, Tony, and you don't really get\n22:25 Comment: where he knows where he's going with the ball.\n22:28 Comment: He's not got the vision.\n22:30 Comment: He's not trying to get back.\n22:31 Comment: He's jogging back here from his right wing position.\n22:34 Comment: Vardy, away from Mariapa.\n22:37 Comment: Excellent save by Gomez, who shows his frustration\n22:40 Comment: because he's got no protection at all.\n22:43 Comment: Real pace again from Leicester.\n22:45 Comment: Yeah.\n22:46 Comment: Slimani on to Vardy.\n22:49 Comment: One-way run against Mariapa, just steps inside him.\n22:51 Comment: The only thing he might have done wrong there,\n22:53 Comment: put it a bit centrally.\n22:54 Comment: I think if he just goes a yard or so towards the far post,\n22:58 Comment: that would have been the third goal there for.\n23:0 Comment: Leicester, they're looking more and more threatening now.\n23:3 Comment: Real uphill battle now for Watford.\n23:7 Comment: Who's making it really awkward for Watford's goalkeeper?\n23:15 Comment: Miank.\n23:22 Comment: Elaborate cross-field pass from Miank.\n23:25 Comment: Can't believe he's been able to do anything with it.\n23:30 Comment: Great save, though, wasn't it?\n23:35 Comment: In fairness as well, I've talked about Vardy,\n23:38 Comment: what he might have done slightly differently,\n23:39 Comment: just went a little bit wider towards the far post.\n23:42 Comment: Slimani coming in, arms out.\n23:43 Comment: If you say, can you not play that across the face of the goal?\n23:45 Comment: He's never going to pass or make a striker like him\n23:48 Comment: in the form that he's been in recently.\n23:49 Comment: He wants to score goals.\n23:51 Comment: He did the right thing.\n23:52 Comment: They're taking the shot.\n23:53 Comment: Keep others in the right position to make the save.\n24:0 Comment: Vardy kept up twice now in the second half by Aurelio Gomez.\n24:8 Comment: Miank.\n24:13 Comment: Bright and busy and industrious.\n24:16 Comment: Searching out Mahrez.\n24:19 Comment: Slimani arriving late.\n24:21 Comment: Vardy ahead of him.\n24:23 Comment: Slimani.\n24:25 Comment: Never over the shot and never totally incomplete.\n24:28 Comment: Well, I would say that maybe it was late,\n24:30 Comment: but it was a good game.\n24:30 Comment: Slimani slightly behind him.\n24:31 Comment: But once again, the counter-attacking football from Leicester\n24:34 Comment: is evident for everyone to see.\n24:36 Comment: On this occasion, Watford have overcommitted players forward.\n24:39 Comment: They've left the space down the right-hand side for Mahrez.\n24:43 Comment: Lovely check back.\n24:44 Comment: Plays into the path of Slimani.\n24:46 Comment: Maybe just slightly behind him.\n24:48 Comment: Look, a confident striker goal there from Slimani.\n24:51 Comment: Well, wider the target.\n24:53 Comment: But certainly Leicester look like they're going to add to this\n24:55 Comment: two goal advantages that they've got at the moment.\n24:59 Comment: Slimani again.\n25:0 Comment: Yeah.\n25:2 Comment: Pushing this side.\n25:3 Comment: Jan Matz challenge.\n25:4 Comment: Mahrez.\n25:7 Comment: Kept in play by Andy King.\n25:13 Comment: Away by Prudhoe.\n25:15 Comment: And Deeney.\n25:18 Comment: Fouled by Deeney.\n25:19 Comment: I say Mahrez's influence in the last five minutes\n25:22 Comment: has certainly been extraordinary as it's changed.\n25:24 Comment: As we see the free kick here.\n25:26 Comment: Deeney just getting away from Troy Deeney.\n25:28 Comment: Set at the corner.\n25:29 Comment: No question.\n25:30 Comment: No question about that.\n25:31 Comment: But that last delivery from Mahrez.\n25:33 Comment: He's just filed it in between the last defender and the goalkeeper.\n25:36 Comment: All he needed was a touch from one of his teammates.\n25:39 Comment: And that would have been the third goal.\n25:40 Comment: Brilliant, brilliant build-up play.\n25:42 Comment: Particularly from Mahrez on that right-hand side.\n25:44 Comment: Goal!\n26:1 Comment: Guardi thought about joining Watford's defensive wall.\n26:7 Comment: Left by King.\n26:8 Comment: Hit by Fuchs.\n26:12 Comment: Just looked a little bit too high, didn't it?\n26:14 Comment: And then the goalkeeper's gone across to his right-hand side to make sure.\n26:20 Comment: Here's a strike coming in from Christian Fuchs.\n26:21 Comment: Got plenty of bend on it.\n26:22 Comment: Just too much height, which took it over the top of the crossbar.\n26:30 Comment: Inside in the mid- interface...\n26:32 Comment: Dз'd brauchen.\n26:33 Comment: Take the ball.\n26:48 Comment: Just before crucial time!\n26:49 Comment: Christian Cavaselli makes way.\n26:51 Comment: Give him off.\n26:54 Comment: Juan Zuniga Good move by\n27:0 Comment: Deeney\n27:6 Comment: Young\n27:10 Comment: Vardy\n27:12 Comment: A hip to shove in the back from Mariapa\n27:15 Comment: Slimani\n27:20 Comment: Mahrez\n27:24 Comment: Fuchs\n27:26 Comment: Albrighton\n27:28 Comment: Leicester now really in their stride\n27:32 Comment: Albrighton battles on and then loses his footing\n27:38 Comment: Leicester suddenly oozing confidence\n27:42 Comment: Mkhaka trying to roll away from Huth\n27:46 Comment: Keane\n27:48 Comment: Ball has gone out of play\n27:53 Comment: He's amazing Tony what a second goal does for you though isn't it\n27:57 Comment: He has a little bit of a chance\n27:59 Comment: But good fortune there from Albrighton to get away from Janmaat\n28:1 Comment: Who's changed position\n28:2 Comment: Janmaat's now come over to the right back position\n28:4 Comment: With Cavaselli going off\n28:5 Comment: Zuniga playing as a left back\n28:7 Comment: I mean Troy Deeney I thought he might have gone a lot closer to Okaka\n28:11 Comment: When he plays the two\n28:12 Comment: But he's been given a free roll if you like\n28:15 Comment: And he's wandering around at the moment\n28:16 Comment: But the other one that's been disappointing the last five minutes is Niang\n28:19 Comment: He's picked the ball up on that left hand side\n28:21 Comment: He's attacked Danny Simpson\n28:23 Comment: And he keeps coming inside of him and Danny Simpson\n28:25 Comment: He's got a good shot\n28:28 Comment: Just he's getting no reward from it at all over there Niang\n28:30 Comment: He needs to try and take him down the line\n28:32 Comment: Ont his left foot and get some crosses in that way\n28:40 Comment: Clevering\n28:43 Comment: De Coret\n28:47 Comment: Amrabat\n28:51 Comment: Janmaat\n28:53 Comment: And again by De Coret\n28:57 Comment: Amrabat trying to find a gap\n29:1 Comment: Janmaat\n29:2 Comment: Usually dealt with by Ndidi\n29:4 Comment: De Coret\n29:11 Comment: Well won by Deeney\n29:15 Comment: Mades\n29:19 Comment: De Coret again covering a lot of ground too\n29:26 Comment: And their taste isn't much this entire first half\n29:27 Comment: But they won't at all\n29:28 Comment: Teamlike\n29:29 Comment: Succeed with the kill\n29:52 Comment: Cleverly\n29:53 Comment: We'll teach this fish Michael\n29:54 Comment: Straight forward for the Leicester goalkeeper.\n29:56 Comment: I think there, Jan Maarten and Cleverley get in each other's way.\n30:0 Comment: One of them is after you, but this is the shot from Niang.\n30:3 Comment: And this occasionally takes him his right foot.\n30:6 Comment: I mean, it's a good height for the goalkeeper,\n30:7 Comment: but I think there was so much pace on the initial shot there from Niang\n30:10 Comment: that the goalkeeper didn't want to try and catch it,\n30:13 Comment: and he just fisted it away, punched it away with his two hands.\n30:17 Comment: Eventually it came out.\n30:18 Comment: Another strike coming in from Cleverley,\n30:20 Comment: which was a much easier save for Cashmish Michael.\n30:24 Comment: Cashmish was backing into Zuniga.\n30:48 Comment: Ducore.\n30:53 Comment: And reverse.\n30:54 Comment: Away from Fuchs.\n30:58 Comment: Cleverley.\n31:0 Comment: Turned away again by Schmeichel.\n31:3 Comment: Good contest between those two.\n31:4 Comment: Almost replicated what he did in the first half.\n31:6 Comment: Yeah, he's had a few sightings, hasn't he, Tom Cleverley?\n31:8 Comment: He's never afraid to take on the strike.\n31:11 Comment: I mean, he had to have a touch on it.\n31:13 Comment: Then he hits it with his right foot, curling.\n31:15 Comment: Looked like it was going to be on target.\n31:18 Comment: The goalkeeper had to make the save.\n31:20 Comment: Good touch from Schmeichel to take over the top of the crossbar.\n31:24 Comment: And it's a good one.\n31:25 Comment: Good ball.\n31:26 Comment: Watford's first corner.\n31:28 Comment: Prudel.\n31:29 Comment: Go, go, go, go, go, go!\n31:30 Comment: Watford's first corner.\n31:32 Comment: More than half an hour of the second half play.\n31:35 Comment: Well, we've got 14 minutes left in this game, Tony,\n31:38 Comment: and any added-on time, you get the feeling that Watford need a goal,\n31:41 Comment: and soon, don't they?\n31:42 Comment: They're going to get themselves back into it.\n31:44 Comment: Goal!\n32:7 Comment: Going into this weekend, just five points separate the team\n32:11 Comment: in eighth position, in the club's 14th.\n32:14 Comment: Goal!\n32:18 Comment: It was a tightly grouped list of teams, but they all know that\n32:22 Comment: every Premier League player does that.\n32:23 Comment: Every Premier League place or every place higher up the table\n32:26 Comment: will bring financial benefits.\n32:35 Comment: The scorer, Leicester's second goal makes way.\n32:42 Comment: Another run-out for Demare Gray.\n32:44 Comment: Majority of his appearances this season have been off the bench,\n32:47 Comment: which has been something of a frustration for him.\n32:50 Comment: Just nine starts in the Premier League.\n32:53 Comment: This is his 18th appearance as a substitute.\n32:59 Comment: Amrabat.\n33:5 Comment: He's over on the ball, it'll be a goal kick.\n33:8 Comment: That's poor from Amrabat.\n33:9 Comment: He had an option to lay the ball into the path of Jan Maat.\n33:12 Comment: Very frustrated with his winger.\n33:15 Comment: And it was an easy ball to pick him out.\n33:16 Comment: He's tried to take on the Leicester back line there.\n33:19 Comment: Just run it straight out for a goal kick.\n33:21 Comment: He's a little bit frustrated there, Maat.\n33:23 Comment: I'm sure if he picked up a knock in the last five minutes or so,\n33:26 Comment: but he's been heavily instrumental.\n33:28 Comment: What's been good about Leicester in this second half,\n33:30 Comment: obviously with the goal that he scored,\n33:32 Comment: he put in one or two absolutely exquisite deliveries into the box as well.\n33:37 Comment: That's him back to the sort of level he was at last season.\n33:52 Comment: Deeney.\n33:53 Comment: That's him.\n33:56 Comment: He's got that ahead of Okaaka.\n34:8 Comment: It's a bit strange for Robert Huth to have a new central defensive partner in Johan Benelwijn.\n34:13 Comment: He's walking on the injured list, but according to Craig.\n34:23 Comment: OK Gromit, conceptually, he just goes

    "summary": "On a bright afternoon at the King Power Stadium, Leicester City delivered an emphatic performance to secure a dominant 3-0 victory over Watford in a Premier League clash. The match was marked by early intensity, tactical adjustments, and moments of individual brilliance that left the visitors thoroughly outplayed.\n\nFrom the opening whistle, the tempo of the game was set with Leicester City demonstrating their attacking intent. Watford's defensive line was tested early by the pace and movement of Jamie Vardy and Shinji Okazaki. As the minutes ticked by, Leicester maintained their pressure, combining well in the midfield and using the flanks effectively through Marc Albrighton and Riyad Mahrez.\n\nLeicester's breakthrough came from a set-piece, showcasing a well-rehearsed routine that caught Watford off guard. As Albrighton's corner delivery headed towards the far post, Amrabat was too slow to react, allowing Wilfred Ndidi to fire a powerful shot past a helpless Heurelho Gomes to give the hosts the lead. It was a goal that epitomized Leicester's resurgence under Craig Shakespeare's guidance, highlighting their tactical awareness and sharpness in front of goal.\n\nDespite falling behind, Watford tried to rally through overlapping runs and attempts to exploit Leicester's defensive gaps. Tom Cleverley and Stefano Okaka were pivotal in driving forward, but Kasper Schmeichel's commanding presence in goal ensured that any threat was swiftly neutralized. Schmeichel's saves, particularly from Cleverley's long-range efforts, were crucial in maintaining Leicester's slender advantage.\n\nAs the first half drew to a close, the narrative remained unchanged. Leicester's quick transitions from defense to attack, coupled with Watford's inability to capitalize on their few chances, underlined the difference between the two sides. The Foxes went into the halftime break with a deserved 1-0 lead.\n\nThe second half saw Watford make tactical adjustments, switching to a back four and pushing Daryl Janmaat further up the field. However, these changes were rendered ineffective as Leicester continued to assert their dominance. Riyad Mahrez, who had been relatively quiet in the first half, began to weave his magic. His close control and dribbling ability left the Watford defenders in disarray on several occasions.\n\nThe defining moment for Mahrez came when he latched onto a flick-on from Vardy. Mariapa, under pressure, failed to clear his lines effectively, gifting the ball to Mahrez. The Algerian wizard made no mistake, poking the ball through Gomes's legs to double Leicester's lead. It was a goal that showcased Mahrez's opportunism and clinical finishing, leaving Watford with a mountain to climb.\n\nWatford, now trailing by two goals, desperately sought a way back into the match. Walter Mazzarri responded by bringing on Troy Deeney to partner Okaka up front, hoping the duo's physical presence could unsettle Leicester's defense. Despite the tactical switch, Robert Huth and his defensive partner, Johan Benelwijn, stood firm, repelling Watford's aerial threats and direct balls into the box.\n\nAs the clock ticked down, Leicester's confidence grew. The introduction of Islam Slimani added a different dimension to their attack, and his link-up play with Vardy and Mahrez continued to trouble Watford's back line. Andy King and Demarai Gray came off the bench to inject fresh energy, ensuring Leicester maintained their relentless pressure.\n\nIn the dying moments of the match, Leicester capped off a scintillating display with a third goal. Jamie Vardy's vision and work rate were on full display as he sprinted down the wing before delivering a perfectly weighted pass into the path of Albrighton. The winger, showing incredible composure, side-footed the ball past Gomes into the net, sealing a comprehensive 3-0 victory for Leicester.\n\nThe win showcased the Foxes' resilience and tactical acumen under Craig Shakespeare's stewardship. While Leicester enjoyed several accolades, including Mahrez's 100th Premier League game marked by his goal, it was a collective effort that saw them claim all three points.\n\nWatford, meanwhile, were left to rue their defensive lapses and missed opportunities. Their failure to capitalize on their possession and the incisive play of Leicester's attackers highlighted the contrasting fortunes of the two sides on the day. Despite their promising moments, Watford's inability to convert their chances meant they left the King Power Stadium empty-handed.\n\nThis game served as a testament to Leicester City's revival and determination to finish the season strongly. With only three fixtures remaining, the Foxes are well positioned to secure a respectable finish in the Premier League table. The performance against Watford not only provided a boost in morale but also reinforced the belief that they can build on the foundation laid by Shakespeare.\n\nAs the final whistle blew, the Leicester faithful celebrated their team's dominant display. The comprehensive victory was a testament to their tactical discipline, attacking flair, and defensive solidity. The Foxes demonstrated why they were once the champions of England, reminding everyone of their capability to compete at the highest level.\n\nIn summary, the Leicester versus Watford match was a display of tactical mastery, individual brilliance, and collective effort. Leicester's clinical finishing, combined with Watford's defensive frailties, resulted in a well-deserved 3-0 victory for the hosts. With standout performances from Mahrez, Vardy, and Ndidi, the Foxes showcased their potential to end the season on a high note."
