    "input": "\n    Arsenal 0 - 0 Middlesbrough\n\nFirst Half:\n\n0:0 Comment: is Mike Dean. His assistants are Simon Long and Ian Hassin, the fourth referee is Tim Robinson,\n0:8 Comment: My name is Philip Kudryavtsev, let's go watch football. Arsenal vs Middlesbrough. It's been a while since we've been away\n0:14 Comment: We saw this confrontation without taking into account the League Cup, which I already talked about. Last time\n0:19 Comment: Middlesbrough played Arsenal in 2009 and it was Middlesbrough's season\n0:25 Comment: Left the Premier League. Arsenal then won 2-0 thanks to two goals from Esco Fabrigas, and themselves\n0:31 Comment: You understand how much times have changed since then, but the layout of everything remains the same. Arsenal\n0:35 Comment: the favorite, and Arsenal are now in the role of the team that is struggling at full speed to gain\n0:41 Comment: leadership in the English championship table. Manchester City showed what this team has\n0:48 Comment: its vulnerabilities and weak points, and Manchester City, in general, is now on points with Arsenal\n0:58 Comment: Has a tie on 19. For both of them, Manchester City has a better goal difference.\n1:5 Comment: As for Middlesbrough, the team is one level ahead in terms of goal difference.\n1:10 Comment: a place above the relegation zone. Only 6 points, one win over the Outsider Sunderland, and more\n1:18 Comment: Middlesbrough has not seen any particular success this season. But there is one thing. Middlesbrough is\n1:25 Comment: The team that has played better away than at home this season. Of the four defeats, Middlesbrough\n1:32 Comment: It happened to this team three times at home, and on the road the team lost only once to Everton.\n1:41 Comment: Two other results, a draw with Stolk City and with Westham United, and, accordingly, a victory over\n1:49 Comment: Sunderland. But, of course, Sunderland and Arsenal away are completely different stories.\n1:54 Comment: However, let's see how events will develop. Volkat plays to the right, here is Hector Beyerin,\n2:1 Comment: asks for a return pass from Volkat to the ball, Alex Ivoby catches it. Elnenny, pass to Francis Coquelin.\n2:8 Comment: Today there are new interactions in the center of the Arsenal hall, and, possibly, in connection with this, the central one\n2:15 Comment: The line will be somewhat less mobile, the ball will move less here at the usual pace for Arsenal.\n2:23 Comment: In general, everything is more or less clear with Arsenal. Those who were ready for this match, those, strictly speaking,\n2:30 Comment: and appeared on the field. Next week Olivier Giroud and Aaron Ramsey will begin classes with the team,\n2:37 Comment: One more player in the central zone, and other players will gradually return to duty.\n2:43 Comment: Vector Bennerin, serve and the ball from the back of George Friend flies for a corner.\n2:48 Comment: George Friend is wearing the captain's armband today, with another player missing from the Middlesbrough backline,\n2:56 Comment: who is very familiar to Arsenal. This is Cullen Chambers. He belongs to the London club,\n3:0 Comment: and therefore cannot play today. Therefore, Daniel Ayalo takes his place in this meeting.\n3:6 Comment: A corner kick, the ball lands on the lawn not far from the goalkeeper's area, but Ayalo easily knocks it out.\n3:14 Comment: Now you can catch the ball in the immediate vicinity of Missu Tozilu's penalty area.\n3:19 Comment: He also loses Alvere Negredo, whom Aiter Karanko, along with Gaston Ramiros, by the way,\n3:26 Comment: I sat him on the bench in the match before last round against Westham. And this was caused by dissatisfaction.\n3:37 Comment: Sharpness in the attacking line, but then returned to the match against Watford. And in what an interesting irony Middlesbrough lost to Watford without scoring a single goal.\n3:49 Comment: However, today Gaston Ramiros and Alvere Negredo are both in the lineup. But what surprised Eiter Karanko was that he left him on the bench.\n3:58 Comment: Firstly, captain Stuart Downing. And not only is he captain, he's a regular starter.\n4:7 Comment: He is the person whose place in the team was hardly in doubt until this moment.\n4:13 Comment: And what’s more, the team’s top scorer Christian Stewart, who already has three goals to his name. And no one in Middlesbrough can boast of such performance.\n4:22 Comment: I thought that Christian Stewart was the main striking force. Before this match, they compared him with Theo Walcott, who has already scored eight goals for Arsenal this season.\n4:32 Comment: And he’s showing a really impressive game now. But Christian Stewart is on the bench, and Theo Walcott today we’ll see him more than once in attack, I’m sure we’ll see him.\n4:42 Comment: Elnenny passes over the head of Theo Walcott and the ball is sent down the right flank.\n4:46 Comment: Here Hector Bellerin asks for a pass from Alexei Sanchez, but Bellerin plays it back to Coquelin.\n4:51 Comment: And Middlesbrough, who lined up a very, very tight group of players on the line of their penalty area, is now fighting back this time by Iwoby.\n5:0 Comment: Forward pass to Sanchez, Ivobi. Ivobi took an extra step in the direction of the opposite ball.\n5:6 Comment: And now Arsenal is forced to return it to themselves, moving a little back, losing in the development of this attack.\n5:13 Comment: Ivoby, however, is gaining momentum back. Clayton sorted it out, but it was quite difficult to get through the pass here.\n5:21 Comment: Adam Atrore didn't reach the ball.\n5:23 Comment: Adam Atrore, a man who was bought from Birmingham's Austenville earlier this season, emerges on the right flank of Middlesbrough's attack.\n5:34 Comment: The Malinsky midfielder will make his debut in the main team. Before that, he only came on as a substitute three times.\n5:40 Comment: Well, today Adam Clayton returns to the start with the acquisition of Martin Derron.\n5:46 Comment: He also lost his place in the center of the field.\n5:49 Comment: However, as I already said, thanks to the fact that Aitr Karang has seated two of his leaders in attack, today other players have a chance.\n6:0 Comment: There in the background we can just watch.\n6:2 Comment: By the way, Fabio Dosilva is coughing right behind Aitra Karanga and there is also an injured man at Middlesbrough.\n6:9 Comment: And first of all, they are probably waiting.\n6:14 Comment: Fans of this team. Captain Grant Libeater returns to the field.\n6:33 Comment: But he will also be training with the team next week.\n6:36 Comment: And Fabio Dosilva, the former Machister United defender, is already on the bench.\n6:43 Comment: The free kick is very dangerous for Sanchez and Ozil.\n6:46 Comment: Right and left legs respectively.\n6:53 Comment: And for such a distance the wall is suspiciously not so powerful.\n7:3 Comment: There are three football players in total.\n7:5 Comment: With Alvero Negredo in the middle and accordingly in the head.\n7:10 Comment: Mitsu Ozil with his left foot.\n7:12 Comment: He spins the ball towards the nine, but from such a distance you can of course hit it more accurately.\n7:17 Comment: Eighth minute of the match. So far 0-0.\n7:19 Comment: Arsenal is expected to have the advantage.\n7:21 Comment: We haven't seen any dangerous moments yet.\n7:24 Comment: Arsenal is a team that really likes to control the ball this season.\n7:28 Comment: Take the lead from the very first minutes and not give in either in the score or, accordingly, in the game.\n7:34 Comment: A team that had only lost 52 minutes in the previous 8 games.\n7:43 Comment: This is an amazing statistic.\n7:46 Comment: Arsenal is the best in the entire Premier League by this indicator.\n7:51 Comment: And Machester City is even inferior to the Gunners in this indicator.\n8:4 Comment: Long pass. Musitosiu handles the ball.\n8:9 Comment: It would seem like a cool patch with Mustafi's frame.\n8:12 Comment: But Arsenal are on the rebound, so we can continue the attack.\n8:15 Comment: Nacho Monreal traced from the left flank.\n8:18 Comment: Nacho Monreal appeared on the left sideline today.\n8:21 Comment: Arsene Wenger has room for rotation.\n8:24 Comment: Kieran Gears played in the Champions League.\n8:26 Comment: He played well, but today he is on defense.\n8:28 Comment: Therefore, in some positions we identify Arsene Wenger’s priority individuals.\n8:39 Comment: Someone will continue to try to take advantage of their chances in cup matches.\n8:45 Comment: Arsenal advanced in the League Cup and will soon hold their meeting there.\n8:49 Comment: In the Champions League it is possible to release players from the nearest reserve.\n8:55 Comment: Because Arsenal scored 7 points in the first three meetings.\n8:59 Comment: And this is a good result for Arsene Wenger, who practically guarantees access to the playoffs.\n9:5 Comment: Well, in matches against the Ludogorets base, practice shows this,\n9:10 Comment: There is an opportunity to involve other players.\n9:13 Comment: Felnenny in forward pass.\n9:16 Comment: Koklyan takes the ball and turns around.\n9:20 Comment: And Shkatran Mustafi raises his head, again looking for someone from the attack line,\n9:26 Comment: to make another accurate and effective cast.\n9:29 Comment: This time there are no such recipients, so the transfer is to Mohamed Elneny.\n9:36 Comment: And now a great show is happening.\n9:38 Comment: Wall-cut in the center of the penalty area.\n9:40 Comment: No one here but Middlesbrough footballers.\n9:44 Comment: Elnenny's Long Strike.\n9:46 Comment: Just in case, Victor Valdez decided to take to the air, but his jump\n9:54 Comment: for the many photographers who have gathered, of course, today mostly outside the gates of Middlesbrough,\n10:2 Comment: had no value from a game standpoint.\n10:8 Comment: Mohamed Elneny on our screens.\n10:12 Comment: A football player who came to Arsenal during last season.\n10:17 Comment: 24-year-old Egyptian midfielder.\n10:20 Comment: Started twice this season and only once in the Premier League,\n10:27 Comment: in the match against Liverpool, when Arsenal also had problems with the squad.\n10:32 Comment: And this was the only meeting that Arsenal lost this year.\n10:36 Comment: I lost in this very stadium.\n10:39 Comment: The match with Liverpool was followed by a goalless draw against Leicester.\n10:44 Comment: They started whispering behind Arsene Winger's back again, but Arsene Winger is simply unkillable.\n10:51 Comment: The man who took the team together and pulled himself together,\n10:57 Comment: And then Arsenal will calmly get six matches.\n11:1 Comment: Sign your name, six wins in a row.\n11:4 Comment: 87% possession of the ball for Arsenal in the first minutes.\n11:8 Comment: This is simply an indecent indicator and, to put it mildly, not a very pleasant shave for Midu.\n11:14 Comment: The team, of course, is ready to play number two, but not...\n11:20 Comment: How striking the advantage must have been in the goat.\n11:23 Comment: Aiter Karenko is still a coach with extensive experience,\n11:30 Comment: even if not the experience of sole leadership of a team,\n11:34 Comment: but being Jose Maurini's assistant, he probably...\n11:41 Comment: I learned a lot, including how to act in the field.\n11:46 Comment: But in cases of how to play as number two, Maurini certainly knows in this crowd.\n12:4 Comment: Arsene Lenger on your screens.\n12:8 Comment: Maurini, of course, is not very good.\n12:11 Comment: But, of course, he's still in the field.\n12:14 Comment: And, of course, he's in the field.\n13:5 Comment: Trure.\n13:8 Comment: Trure, by the way, despite the fact that the footballer is of Malin origin,\n13:14 Comment: He also has Spanish citizenship.\n13:17 Comment: In general, there are a lot of Spaniards today.\n13:19 Comment: Daniil Yaua was now on your screens and as part of the Minusbro, naturally.\n13:25 Comment: The figure of Aiter Karanto, naturally,\n13:28 Comment: affects the number of Spanish players in the squad.\n13:32 Comment: Ayalo, Baragan, Trure, Alvareno Gredo, Victor Valdez, in the end,\n13:38 Comment: Well, Hector Bellrin and Machu Monreal.\n13:41 Comment: Two Spanish defenders are present in the arsenal.\n13:44 Comment: Volkat, pass to Ozil.\n13:46 Comment: Ozil hesitated and didn't hit that ball quickly.\n13:50 Comment: One touch.\n13:53 Comment: Fell on the lawn.\n13:55 Comment: The defenders took it away.\n13:56 Comment: Thick translation forward.\n13:58 Comment: Gaston Ramirez didn't have time to catch on here.\n14:5 Comment: The combination of Gaston Ramirez, Christian Stuani and Alvareno Gredo is potentially very strong.\n14:11 Comment: Even by the standards of the Premier League, very concretely capable.\n14:14 Comment: Minusbro has a trio in attack, but so far it hasn't shown itself very well.\n14:19 Comment: Yes, Christian Stuani scored three goals.\n14:21 Comment: This is a good indicator.\n14:22 Comment: But other than that, Gredo is pretty passive in attack.\n14:25 Comment: And this also means the lack of the proper level of support from the midfielders.\n14:30 Comment: Cristian Stuani is on the bench today.\n14:32 Comment: Baragan jumps, knocking the ball over the sideline.\n14:38 Comment: Arsenal are still circling the Minusbro penalty area.\n14:44 Comment: Coclean.\n14:46 Comment: Mustafi.\n14:47 Comment: Mustafi swings, he doesn't dare to hit from this position.\n14:50 Comment: Berierin.\n14:52 Comment: Coclean.\n14:54 Comment: Elnenny.\n14:59 Comment: Well, there's been a lot of talk about the middle line.\n15:2 Comment: How will Arsenal play this season?\n15:5 Comment: Which players will Arsene Wenger choose?\n15:7 Comment: There are essentially three vacancies at the central midfielder position.\n15:11 Comment: For which five or even six players competed before the season.\n15:17 Comment: Alexey Sanchez is turning around now.\n15:20 Comment: He manages to raise his head, and Gaston Ramirez kills the ball right from under his feet.\n15:27 Comment: How will the Coclean-Kosorla combination be broken?\n15:33 Comment: who used to play very successfully in football?\n15:35 Comment: Cocleanus was the perfect destroyer for Arsenal.\n15:38 Comment: Kozorla was up front and had a very cool previous season of Misuto Zila's pitching.\n15:43 Comment: Heel and beyond.\n15:45 Comment: But Midos Bro hits the ball.\n15:47 Comment: From his own goal, Negredo goes even further straight to Mohamed Elneny.\n15:53 Comment: More on to Zila.\n15:55 Comment: Uzil.\n15:57 Comment: There will be a lot of destroyers here.\n15:59 Comment: And this is very important.\n16:1 Comment: More on to Zila.\n16:3 Comment: Uzil couldn't beat Gaston Ramirez one-on-one.\n16:7 Comment: And now he kills with a long blow, completely unaddressed.\n16:12 Comment: The ball lands in someone else's half of the field.\n16:15 Comment: How will the facets of Jak fit in here?\n16:18 Comment: But the facet of Xhaka, in general, combines the ability to destroy and create.\n16:26 Comment: Arsenal also has Aaron Ramsey.\n16:28 Comment: There is definitely Misuto Zil.\n16:30 Comment: There is Mohammed Elneny, whom we still assign more of a role as a reserve player.\n16:38 Comment: There was Jack Wilshere.\n16:40 Comment: But in this highly competitive environment, Jack Wilshere chose to go on loan.\n16:46 Comment: I probably did the right thing.\n16:48 Comment: Today was the first time since 2013 that Jack Wilshere played a full match.\n16:52 Comment: Full 90 minutes as part of Bormouth.\n16:54 Comment: I think that at Arsenal he would not have reached such a figure for a long time.\n17:1 Comment: Frent was rushing along the left edge.\n17:4 Comment: Mustafi very delicately took the ball away from him, leaving him lying on Sanchez's lawn.\n17:13 Comment: Taking out Ayala, Elnenny.\n17:16 Comment: From the first minutes, one gets the impression that the turf of the Emirates Stadium, which, by the way, was resurfaced this summer, and even the traditional Emirates Cup was canceled due to the replacement of the surface at this beautiful stadium.\n17:37 Comment: Its right half will be significantly trampled and will even, perhaps, differ visually from the left, since practically no human foot can step there.\n18:7 Comment: Mesut Azio's fall in the penalty area, which happened a few minutes earlier.\n18:20 Comment: The whistle was not given. We continue to play. Mid reset, Ayala with the ball.\n18:24 Comment: Already Alexey Sanchez is blocking, or rather, the possible direction of the pass to goalkeeper Negredo.\n18:33 Comment: Throore throws the ball, won it from Kasilny. Troore, strike and finish off Negredo.\n18:40 Comment: And once again there is an opportunity to break through. The most dangerous moment.\n18:44 Comment: Mid Sbrough didn't have to spend much time on the armory's side of the floor to create this scoring situation.\n18:50 Comment: Bravo Petr Cech! And the first one who should apologize to his keeper, thank him for all these heroics, is, of course, Laranco the Strong.\n19:2 Comment: We look, Ayala throws the ball, Kasilny doesn’t even think about going at all, ahead of his opponent.\n19:10 Comment: Troore figured it out, Negredo aimed at the very corner, but Petr Cech guessed his intention.\n19:15 Comment: Well, then a violation of the rules and a free kick are also, in principle, potentially dangerous.\n19:20 Comment: I think that Midu would not have given up this opportunity before launching this attack.\n19:23 Comment: But, after the fact, you have the ball installed at this point, and not inside the penalty area with one Petr Cech on the 7-meter goal.\n19:39 Comment: There is a small sediment.\n19:41 Comment: Ramira with a crossbar strike to the head of Alvar Negredo, the ball bounces.\n19:47 Comment: This is the billiards we have now.\n19:56 Comment: Here are Bohr's chances.\n19:58 Comment: In Arsenal you can't play as imposingly as defender Laranko Silniy did now.\n20:7 Comment: Firstly, this brings in a dangerous moment.\n20:10 Comment: But even if Cech saves later, here it is, a standard position and a cross.\n20:30 Comment: Another attack from Bor.\n20:32 Comment: And again Adama Trure from the right flank.\n20:34 Comment: We were really looking forward to him, in fact, as part of Midu.\n20:37 Comment:  Midosbro is mainly in the lineup because he showed himself quite well when he came on as a substitute.\n20:44 Comment: Moreover, this football player played with great desire, but for the time being he did not get his chance.\n20:51 Comment: But I must say that, of course, Midosbrough needed to make such changes, because only 7 goals were scored in the Premier League this season.\n21:1 Comment: Only Burley and Sunderland have less.\n21:7 Comment: Frankly speaking, such statistics cannot be encouraging.\n21:12 Comment: Negreta scored in the first match against Stolk.\n21:16 Comment: And then it calmed down for as many as 7 chickens.\n21:23 Comment: El Nene, Iwobi.\n21:27 Comment: Literally pushes the ball between the opponent's legs.\n21:30 Comment: He remains with Arsenal.\n21:32 Comment: The wolf too.\n21:34 Comment: They didn't let him make El Nene's penalty area.\n21:35 Comment: But from this distance, in principle, you can shoot when all the opponents have pressed into the penalty area.\n21:39 Comment: Arsenal prefers to roll out anyway.\n21:41 Comment: Wrong team, wrong style, wrong methods.\n21:48 Comment: Arsenal will play the trusted one.\n21:51 Comment: Well, Mike Dean blows his whistle.\n21:54 Comment: This time Gaston Ramirez will no longer take the free kick, but will bring it into his team's goal.\n22:5 Comment: To Albert Lindsoe.\n22:25 Comment: This time there are 4 football players in the shoot.\n22:28 Comment: The ball is set a little closer to the center than it was in the previous episode.\n22:31 Comment: Sanchez hits!\n22:35 Comment: We saw Victor Valdez in action.\n22:43 Comment: The ex-Barce goalkeeper is on alert.\n22:45 Comment: In fact, this is the first serious test for the Arsenal goalkeeper.\n22:49 Comment: And Valdez entered the game much later than Petr Cev.\n22:53 Comment: Although today you still feel that it was goalkeeper Bora...\n23:2 Comment: ...sweats a little more.\n23:4 Comment: Droy tried to cling to the ball again.\n23:7 Comment: Unbelievable.\n23:11 Comment: With great desire, he always looks for opportunities ahead for his team.\n23:17 Comment: And in this regard, Arsenal's defenders must always be on alert.\n23:23 Comment: The forward is fast, the forward is sharp.\n23:26 Comment: Well, in fact, he already caught one stronger yawn.\n23:31 Comment: Ayala.\n23:33 Comment: Valdez threw it under his right leg.\n23:37 Comment: Ayala ball.\n23:38 Comment: Victor Valdez threw ahead.\n23:41 Comment: Nagredo falls holding his head.\n23:44 Comment: Mike Dean doesn't even look at the Spanish striker.\n23:47 Comment: So Nagred either needs to rise or...\n23:51 Comment: ...or wait until his partner kicks the ball over the sideline.\n23:54 Comment: Moreover, it was not the most...\n23:58 Comment: ...strong try.\n24:1 Comment: It's not a good situation for that.\n24:3 Comment: The Middlesbrough players were under pressure.\n24:6 Comment: And so calmly Frent threw the ball away.\n24:9 Comment: Over the side.\n24:10 Comment: Let's see what happened here.\n24:11 Comment: Mustafi...\n24:14 Comment: ...very gently placed his hand on Alvar Nagred's back.\n24:19 Comment: And he grabbed the back of his head, as if he was burning his little one.\n24:27 Comment: El Naine.\n24:29 Comment: You could say that within Fair Place Middlesbrough have now given the ball back to Arsenal.\n24:33 Comment: Because Valdez was extremely unsuccessful in knocking him into the opponent's half of the field.\n24:49 Comment: They show us...\n24:51 Comment: ...Ben Gibson.\n24:59 Comment: Arsenal's left flank attack.\n25:1 Comment: Above Cemonrial hits Adam Trore, who also manages to work from behind.\n25:5 Comment: And Traore wins the fight for the ball.\n25:8 Comment: He's already believed in himself too much here.\n25:12 Comment: Gathered two.\n25:13 Comment: Tried to throw the ball to Myum Mohammed El Naina.\n25:16 Comment: But certainly for such a desire of Aiter Karanka...\n25:23 Comment: ...Adam Trore must be commended.\n25:28 Comment: Holds on the gate.\n25:58 Comment: spend more time in pauses.\n26:6 Comment: Gaston Ramirez, Hector pushes his back a little\n26:9 Comment: Bellerina and in the end Gaston Ramirez could not stand it\n26:12 Comment: and fell.\n26:13 Comment: Maybe no specific hand movement from the side\n26:16 Comment: Hector Bellerin was not drawn to this fall, but it happens all the time\n26:20 Comment: He constantly interfered a little with Gaston Ramirez\n26:25 Comment: and here this overlay didn’t pull down, but definitely\n26:32 Comment: It prevented me from picking up speed.\n26:33 Comment: Ramirez is at the ball himself, but to shoot from such an acute angle\n26:43 Comment: He won’t turn anymore, he will now serve the penalty\n26:46 Comment:  square.\n26:47 Comment: Cross, shot, didn't hit the ball in the hand of one of the players\n26:54 Comment: arsenal.\n26:55 Comment: Ramirez himself came running and pushed all the players away\n26:59 Comment: The opponent tried to strike, but it was blocked.\n27:2 Comment: Elnene and the cauldrons were a little confused about who should\n27:6 Comment: start attack.\n27:7 Comment: Bellerin started it with a long cast into the other half\n27:11 Comment: field, but Wocott hasn't gotten to the ball yet.\n27:13 Comment: Well, neither Sanchez nor Wacott can be said to be very\n27:18 Comment: they get a lot of free space, and the ball is good\n27:21 Comment: they hardly get into the nearest penalty area\n27:23 Comment: Middlesbrough.\n27:24 Comment: Of course, this is a game of 10 people in defense, a sacrifice of entertainment\n27:32 Comment: match, but it's probably different to play against Arsenal,\n27:35 Comment: Now it's just stupid.\n27:36 Comment: Ozil falls, Ben Gibson fights Theo Wacott,\n27:46 Comment: The ball remains with the Middlesbrough players.\n27:54 Comment: Baragan.\n28:1 Comment: Madrial releases the ball over the sideline, only\n28:6 Comment: feels the breath of Gaston Ramirez.\n28:8 Comment: Madrial got nervous and shouted 'give' in Russian\n28:15 Comment: Now to Baragan.\n28:16 Comment: So affectionate for the Russian ear at the Emirates Stadium\n28:28 Comment: These several calls rang out.\n28:34 Comment: Clayton also acts as a ball boy for Baragan in this one\n28:39 Comment: situation, but, naturally, a full-back, he should\n28:42 Comment: throw out.\n28:43 Comment: Baragan.\n30:10 Comment: Montreal, Ivobe, Elnene, Coquelin.\n30:32 Comment: Coquelin and Elnene.\n31:33 Comment: Sanchez before, now Uziu and Elnene have the ball.\n31:39 Comment: The German is attacking!\n31:43 Comment: The app is out of game.\n31:45 Comment: Recorded by Laurent Cassilny.\n31:59 Comment: Yes, Laurent Cassilny was half a body ahead of the defenders.\n32:5 Comment: To the right.\n32:11 Comment: To the linesman.\n32:17 Comment: The name is Simon Long, who recorded an offside shot.\n32:23 Comment: And now Arsene Winger is on your screens again.\n32:27 Comment: His expression on his face is not at all festive, to put it mildly.\n32:30 Comment: Arsene Winger has been helping his right hand for quite some time now.\n32:39 Comment: Assistant Steve Bolt.\n32:41 Comment: Before that, he was his assistant for 16 years.\n32:45 Comment: Until 2012, there was Pat Rice.\n32:50 Comment: This tandem can chalk up big victories.\n32:54 Comment: And now Gaston Ramirez almost scored the first goal in this meeting.\n32:59 Comment: So what can you tell me after Arsenal spent 85% of the time in front of the opponent's goal.\n33:5 Comment: And only Petr Cech saved from two inevitable goals.\n33:9 Comment: Here Laurent Cassilny's back was, of course, very unforced, this assist was very unforced.\n33:17 Comment: But Gaston Ramirez almost hit the goal after that.\n33:26 Comment: Negredo!\n33:28 Comment: Discount for the goalkeeper.\n33:30 Comment: The Arsenal sub-ballers fought back there.\n33:32 Comment: Very dangerous standards from Middlesbrough.\n33:34 Comment: Gaston Ramirez hit the crossbar.\n33:36 Comment: There is regular confusion after innings.\n33:38 Comment: Troyer.\n33:41 Comment: Against Coquelin there are two incredibly tenacious, even very toothy midfielders here, Sasha.\n33:47 Comment: Troyer turned out to be stronger.\n33:49 Comment: However, this did not help Middlesbrough much.\n33:51 Comment: Wow! What an experience Ben Gibson played here.\n33:57 Comment: Although, in general, Gibson has neither football nor life experience.\n34:3 Comment: Moreover, playing in the Premier League is only 23 years old for this English defender.\n34:10 Comment: This is his first season in English football's elite.\n34:13 Comment: Baragan.\n34:17 Comment: Gibson. But here we need to definitely kleitning.\n34:19 Comment: It's safer there.\n34:44 Comment: The reward rises from the lawn. There was a violation of the rules here.\n34:48 Comment: But what can I say, Arsenal play defense not without nerves.\n34:56 Comment: The Middlesbrough players have already had three great opportunities to hit the opponent's goal.\n35:1 Comment: Throw it in. Knocks it out harder.\n35:8 Comment: Kleitnin tried to turn around.\n35:12 Comment: But, as you can see, it didn't work out.\n35:14 Comment: And here, as you can see, Middlesbrough, as you can see, already has an opportunity.\n35:20 Comment: Kleitnin tried to turn around.\n35:34 Comment: So, Shkodron Mustafi is lying on the lawn and holding on to Kolya.\n35:49 Comment: This, of course, is not pleasant in all respects for Arsenal.\n35:52 Comment: We remember problems with the defensive line when the First Deadman was injured at the beginning of the season.\n35:57 Comment: And for the first round match against Liverpool a pair of Chambers Holding came out in defense.\n36:4 Comment: Well, here's the episode. Cech has a canopy in balls.\n36:7 Comment: For example, what happened to Mustafi when he landed. Maybe he hurt his leg.\n36:11 Comment: In any case, injuries that seem to have occurred out of the blue to football players,\n36:16 Comment: They sometimes turn out to be the most serious.\n36:19 Comment: Mustafi has a lot of suffering in his eyes.\n36:23 Comment: He goes off the sideline.\n36:26 Comment: But the most important thing is that he doesn’t even leave, he runs away.\n36:28 Comment: Everything is fine. Gavril Kaulista was next to Arsenal Menger.\n36:31 Comment: And the head coach even managed to say a few words.\n36:34 Comment: But I understand that everything is fine.\n36:36 Comment: And help Gavril Kaulist, if necessary, only a little later.\n37:3 Comment:  Weight.\n37:4 Comment: To the far corner of the brotherhood.\n37:6 Comment: It's very simple, I think, to play barracan.\n37:14 Comment:  Weight.\n37:15 Comment: To the far corner of the brotherhood.\n37:17 Comment: It's very simple, I think, to play barracan.\n37:23 Comment:  Weight.\n37:24 Comment: To the far corner of the brotherhood.\n37:26 Comment: It's very simple, I think, to play barracan.\n37:34 Comment:  Weight.\n37:35 Comment: To the far corner of the brotherhood.\n37:37 Comment: It's very simple, I think, to play barracan.\n37:43 Comment: The pendulum went on the attack stronger.\n37:45 Comment: I went for a corner kick.\n37:49 Comment: Which, in fact, is what's happening with the series.\n37:51 Comment: Attack on the Arsenal defenders.\n37:53 Comment: Nagredo.\n37:54 Comment: Wins the fight.\n37:55 Comment: They are the ones who are more fearless on the fraternal line.\n37:59 Comment: Nagredo.\n38:0 Comment: To put it mildly,\n38:3 Comment: trying to clear the ball.\n38:4 Comment: Adama Torre.\n38:7 Comment: Even one against three considers himself\n38:10 Comment: in the field as a warrior.\n38:11 Comment: Fights with the help of partners\n38:13 Comment: scrapes the ball.\n38:15 Comment: Middlesbrough Footballers Try\n38:17 Comment: recapture it in the central circle.\n38:19 Comment: Still, Arsenal has an advantage here.\n38:22 Comment: Mustafi.\n38:25 Comment: Ozil.\n38:26 Comment: The German midfielder is sitting very deep now.\n38:31 Comment: El Neny.\n38:33 Comment: The judges are ready.\n38:34 Comment: In the east of the line is Evgeniy Yegorchak.\n38:51 Comment: 0-0 so far.\n38:52 Comment: 39th minute.\n38:53 Comment: If Middlesbrough scored 7 goals this season,\n38:56 Comment: Then Arsenal have 19.\n39:0 Comment: This, along with Machester City,\n39:2 Comment: In two matches, Arsenal scored three, all three draws were against Liverpool, and in the next six, as many as 16 goals.\n39:17 Comment: So Arsenal...\n39:19 Comment:  But now...\n39:24 Comment: A team with great attacking potential, although attacking potential is of course greatly diminished by injuries.\n39:31 Comment: L-90.\n39:38 Comment: Iwoby.\n39:42 Comment: Sanchez.\n39:49 Comment: Osius passes with his left foot in the direction of the beginning of Madrial, but the barr acts reliably there.\n39:56 Comment: The Middlesbrough players are not losing ground, a very, very clear game.\n40:0 Comment: Well, Arsenal, in general, does not force their opponents to throw themselves out properly, somewhere...\n40:9 Comment: Maybe let your players go, force them to act on the back-up, and, accordingly, make mistakes, missing out on some areas.\n40:18 Comment: No, everything is very clear, everything is very structured.\n40:20 Comment: If an Arsenal footballer comes with the ball into any attacking zone, one or two opposing footballers will definitely be waiting for him there.\n40:28 Comment: Sanchels.\n40:46 Comment: The offside position is recorded.\n40:49 Comment: And there are 4 minutes of pure time left until the end of the half.\n40:55 Comment: And now we look at one of the main moments of the first half, when Petr Cech pulls the ball out of the near corner after a shot from Caston Ramirez.\n41:4 Comment: And, of course, once again we exclaim at the actions of Armand Troure.\n41:9 Comment: He turned the defender on the left edge of the attack very coolly.\n41:22 Comment: Friend.\n41:25 Comment: Lighton.\n41:50 Comment: Mustafi.\n41:51 Comment: Both one and not.\n41:55 Comment: He’s already improving his percentage of ball possession.\n42:0 Comment: Irony, of course, 29 percent.\n42:2 Comment: Instead of 13 in the first couple of Sanchels.\n42:16 Comment: Breaking the rules.\n42:17 Comment: Well, as for other statistical indicators, just imagine.\n42:22 Comment: In terms of shots and turns, Midosbro beats Arsenal with a score of 8-3.\n42:32 Comment: And three shots were recorded on target for the guests and only one for the home team.\n42:38 Comment:  Like this.\n42:39 Comment: This is despite the fact that, of course, the number of passes is more than double Arsenal's advantage.\n42:45 Comment: But ball possession and passes are far from the main statistical indicators.\n42:52 Comment: In general, no statistical indicators are important, except for goals and top of the match.\n42:57 Comment: But, nevertheless, such a significant advantage in shots makes both Arsene Wenger and Steve Bold think twice.\n43:11 Comment: Negredo.\n43:14 Comment: Peter Cech to the left flank.\n43:15 Comment: In the end he plays well, although at first it seemed like the ball fell off his foot.\n43:19 Comment: But now Alex Aylobi has a free left zone.\n43:22 Comment: Against him is another number 17, Baragan.\n43:25 Comment: Nice pass on Alex Sanchez.\n43:28 Comment: It turned around its axis twice.\n43:31 Comment: Bass on the elbow.\n43:32 Comment: Nevertheless, there must be zil.\n43:34 Comment: And, of course, it's not easy.\n43:36 Comment:  It is not simple.\n43:41 Comment: Bass on the elbow.\n43:42 Comment: However, Ozil should have finished this cross with a twist-kick.\n43:47 Comment: And the elbow didn’t finish the attack on its own.\n43:51 Comment: And yet I saw the connection of the central midfielder to the forward zone.\n43:59 Comment: However, Arsenal were unable to deliver their fourth blow in this meeting by turning the midfielder.\n44:4 Comment: Montreal.\n44:6 Comment: Ozil. Montreal.\n44:8 Comment: Elmeni gets the ball.\n44:14 Comment: Cast in the direction of Hector Geyerin.\n44:18 Comment: And here is the omnipresent Adama Traore.\n44:38 Comment: Gaston Ramirez.\n44:41 Comment: Kills the ball from his own penalty area.\n44:44 Comment: The last minutes of normal time of the first half are coming to an end.\n44:47 Comment: Bellarin plays backwards.\n44:49 Comment: What's Montreal?\n44:54 Comment: And we look.\n44:55 Comment: Lighthouse Dean, it seems to me he has the right to add two minutes.\n44:57 Comment: There were stops at the beginning.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:31 Comment: Medvedev, Muhammad Eldeni, before him Mesutozil 11,\n0:34 Comment: Alex Iwobi 17, left Teolok 14 right,\n0:37 Comment: and Alexey Sanchez number 7 on Astria attack,\n0:40 Comment: head coach Arsene Wenger.\n0:43 Comment: Eiter Karanta is coaching Middlesbrough and his squad is number 26 Victor Valdes,\n0:49 Comment: Ben Gibson is number 6, and Daniel Ayau is number 4.\n0:53 Comment: Central defenders George Friend 3, Antonio Baragan 17.\n0:56 Comment: Along the edges in the center of the field are a trio of football players,\n1:1 Comment: 34th Adam Forshaw, 8th Adam Clayton,\n1:5 Comment: and 14th Martin Deron, 37th Adamo Trore,\n1:9 Comment: 10th Alvaro Negredo in Astria,\n1:13 Comment: and Gaston Ramirez, I haven’t forgotten, he plays on the left in midfield under number 21.\n1:18 Comment: Today's match is being served by a panel of judges led by Mike Dean,\n1:22 Comment: my name is Philip Kudryasov, and we continue to observe the same picture\n1:26 Comment: Arsenal in full force on the opposing side of the field,\n1:29 Comment: and Middlesbrough is trying to quickly attack from their own half.\n1:33 Comment: In the first half, Middlesbrough's right flank looked very good,\n1:37 Comment: here Baragan acted unerringly in defense.\n1:41 Comment: Moreover, with his help, with the help of Antonio Baragan\n1:46 Comment: regularly ran into Adam Trore's attack,\n1:50 Comment: he clung to the balls there, he forced the opponents to fight.\n1:52 Comment: Once, very, very unexpectedly, I forced Laureno Cassilny to make a mistake,\n1:59 Comment: went one on one, and only Petr Cek was able to save Arsenal from a goal.\n2:3 Comment: Mike Dean blows the whistle, Aleksey Sanchevich lies on the lawn,\n2:8 Comment: and they didn’t fine it would be a blow to the face.\n2:12 Comment: Several Middlesbrough footballers are talking here.\n2:16 Comment: With the main referee, Mayalo knocked the ball out, and before that Aleksey Sanchevic and Antonio Baragan were injured in a collision.\n2:35 Comment: Yes, a free kick, Missot was near the ball, it’s convenient for him to spin into the penalty area from here with his left foot,\n2:43 Comment: and Vector Valdez, who entered the game only once in the first half.\n2:53 Comment: Canopy!\n2:57 Comment: Unfortunately, Valdez doesn't get to the ball and Kassilny skips over.\n3:1 Comment: He would have been a little short of height if Per Mertesacker had been in his place.\n3:5 Comment: He probably could have nodded correctly and still delivered the ball.\n3:11 Comment: Well, out of nowhere, Middlesbrough allowed such confusion at their gates for the first time.\n3:18 Comment: Middlesbrough's defenders put pressure on the body, but first of all, the opposing footballer.\n3:24 Comment: Let's see, here Ayalo and Deron tried to prevent Sanchevits from getting to the ball,\n3:31 Comment: but instead they put a barrier in the way of Vector Valdez, who did not make it.\n3:36 Comment: And this pass from Alexis Sanchevs.\n3:41 Comment: Laurent Cassilny's jump may indeed be quite high, but not high enough.\n3:56 Comment: Sanchev wins the fight against him.\n3:58 Comment: A throw to Misata Azila, but here Vector Valdez did not need to win the ball in the air.\n4:4 Comment: He reached the ball well.\n4:29 Comment: Walcott.\n4:36 Comment: And Aiter Karanko, who was right next to him on the sideline.\n4:42 Comment: And Steve Agnew, who is next to him now, is his assistant.\n4:49 Comment: They immediately threw up their hands, indignant against, in their opinion, Theo Walcott's simulation.\n4:55 Comment: Theo Walcott, let me remind you, has scored 8 goals this season in all competitions.\n5:0 Comment: Of these, 5 were in the Premier League for Arsenal.\n5:3 Comment: This is probably one of the best periods of his career.\n5:13 Comment: Now he is one of the leaders of the attack.\n5:15 Comment: To the right flank.\n5:17 Comment: Bellarin crosses.\n5:19 Comment: And at the last moment Gibson pulled out his leg.\n5:22 Comment: Stopped Alex Ivober from shooting at the goal from close range.\n5:26 Comment: Well, things are finally starting to work out for Arsenal.\n5:29 Comment: Meduzbro already.\n5:37 Comment: He gets nervous and there are places in the defense where it becomes, so to speak, a little thin.\n5:45 Comment: And where it is thin, it may soon tear.\n5:49 Comment: Ozil Sancho.\n5:52 Comment: Now he turned over his right shoulder and made a reverse pass to that ogle’s place.\n5:59 Comment: And another violation of the rules.\n6:1 Comment: There are no yellow cards in our match yet, but Meduzbro allows a large number of such minor violations, stops that disrupt Arsenal’s attacks, that slow down the tempo in this game.\n6:22 Comment: Sancho looked around the ball.\n6:45 Comment: Here Sancho under the right to strike is definitely Victor Valdees.\n6:53 Comment: The striker of the Chilean national team, a two-time winner of the America's Cup, reacted to this blow.\n7:3 Comment: He made an inaccurate shot, the ball went off the posts.\n7:52 Comment: I eat Al Nine.\n7:56 Comment: Now the Dutchman Derron literally flew into Mustafi.\n8:1 Comment: On your screens, Martin Derron, the most expensive acquisition of this summer from Meduzbro.\n8:9 Comment: We spent 12 million pounds on it, bought it from Italian Atalanta.\n8:14 Comment: pounds bought it from the Italian Atalanta, and in general, Meduzbro has noticeably strengthened this season\n8:19 Comment: Sanchezo acts brilliantly Victor Valdez\n8:28 Comment: Victor Valdez came from Manchester for free, just like Gaston Ravier from\n8:33 Comment: Southampton players in prominent roles in our club from inagreta were not paid now\n8:39 Comment: transfer fee he is on loan from Martin Dare he cost 12 million euros pounds\n8:45 Comment: I apologize to matoro and also quite a lot of money for the team that has just been promoted to the premier\n8:49 Comment: league 7 million pounds\n8:56 Comment: Well, now vector Valdez is holding on to his knee\n9:4 Comment: It wasn’t so easy for him to make this impressive, spectacular jump\n9:39 Comment: perdida\n9:49 Comment: T-shirts carefully watch the installation process vector\n9:58 Comment: already bored with the angle of the flag, he wants to ask cilantro to serve, he hurries to the side\n10:5 Comment: only now it allows you to serve near Valdez, we take it at the exit\n10:15 Comment: the box, of course, was broken by a game episode and no other stretching exercise, not exactly Valdez\n10:26 Comment: judging by the fact that the grimace is not only the pain of discomfort on his face, he has not fully recovered\n10:38 Comment: this fall, the baragan troure plays so hard that the manreal flew away from him and fell on the lawn\n10:45 Comment: Bellarin's cross insured his central defenders; it was he in front of the side on the hole\n10:56 Comment: How cool Trore played once again and there was no cross here from any of the players\n11:7 Comment: Bellarin's center defense closed this zone thanks to his crazy speed\n11:16 Comment: show us the tall defender Danil Yalu Forshal\n11:21 Comment: the midfielder has been waiting for a long, long time for the training camp\n11:27 Comment: and this violation was sent into attack throughout the recorded Mike Dynas yes this is Kipson\n11:45 Comment: but this is

understand it, the arsenal defender also slipped\n19:16 Comment: Kaston Ramira leaves Mustafi and immediately reaches for Kaston with all possible parts of his body\n19:35 Comment: Castona Ramira co-supports the guest sector separately personally, well, in general, support\n19:41 Comment: necessary because now Gaston Ramirez will want to repeat his\n19:49 Comment: cannon strike just a

running back to Manreal Ivobe the weight is great\n20:47 Comment: Volcutt needs to be finished off by turning, standing with his leg raised and waiting for an apparently opportune moment\n20:52

out, or do something.\n25:37 Comment: With his sword, Baragan allows him to go beyond the front line from his leg.\n25:42 Comment: Well.\n25:46 Comment: A very monotonous game performed by Arsenal even\n25:49 Comment: in the second half.\n25:50 Comment: At the very beginning of the second 45 minutes there was such an explosion,\n25:55 Comment: when danger actually arose several times at the Valdez gate.\n25:59 Comment: And so...\n26:4 Comment: Midus Bro adapted very well to this pace and calmly\n26:8 Comment: It's holding up for now.\n26:10 Comment: Aklen.\n26:13 Comment: Ayala.\n26:14 Comment: At first it might seem that this was a purposeful transmission to someone,\n26:18 Comment: who got lost on the other side of the field.\n26:20 Comment: But as we see, Midus Bro simply has no addressees ahead of him.\n26:25 Comment: The field players are no longer 9, I mean, but 10 in their half.\n26:39 Comment: Forshal.\n26:40 Comment: Picks up speed in the field.\n26:42 Comment: Forshal.\n26:43 Comment: Picking up speed along the flank.\n26:49 Comment: Alexis Sanchez.\n26:51 Comment: Throwing the ball forward, but Misutu Azila prevents Ayal from reaching the ball.\n26:54 Comment: However, this is not Rasberikhov in the penalty area and Victor Valdez.\n26:58 Comment: But for some reason, having run to the line of the penalty area, he comes back and fixes the ball in his hands.\n27:12 Comment: It was Victor Valdez who was the last to hope that he would have time to play with his hands while still inside the penalty area.\n27:18 Comment: But he had to play with his head, and then with all the ensuing consequences.\n27:42 Comment: Coquelin.\n27:43 Comment: Less and less time.\n27:44 Comment: 73 minutes.\n27:47 Comment: Already behind them.\n27:52 Comment: Be on the lookout for the side.\n27:53 Comment: By the way, Midoise Grodd is still without a replacement.\n27:55 Comment: That's what's interesting.\n27:58 Comment: And Alexander is already conducting the

copes in the support zone due to simply not having the proper stuff there\n28:47 Comment: the number of opposing players, and everyone else must play in attack, moreover, the change of position is now\n28:54 Comment: This is welcome, because without her, Midlosbrough literally dismantles the Arsenal game.\n29:0 Comment: Well, it must be said that Middlesbrough, despite the fact that the team started this season unimpressively,\n29:8 Comment: scores quite a few goals.\n29:20 Comment: Still, he plays very well in defense. I see Ellie Goating on the left\n29:26 Comment: As I understand it, Steve Crank is on the right, I’m afraid I won’t guess, but the famous singer could be recognized right away.\n29:38 Comment: Midlosbrough have made 194 interceptions in the first 8 rounds of the season, more than any other\n29:50 Comment: The team is in the Premier League and generally plays defensively.\n29:57 Comment: More than convincingly, despite the fact that it is still impossible to avoid missing goals.\n30:9 Comment: But last season in the championship the team conceded only 31 goals. This is the best defense ever\n30:16 Comment: four English divisions, which, in fact, make up the football league in England.\n30:30 Comment: So Arsenal today is a priori playing against a team that is not the most convenient for them.\n30:35 Comment: Traore thought of passing to Gaston Ramirez, but he himself fell on the lawn and generally swears, they were already covering there too.\n30:49 Comment: Coquelin while Tylis Orsley plays around the ball. Chamberland, here's Montreal just appearing on the field.\n30:58 Comment: Coquelin, Chamberland is now playing the ball back to his teammate. And two at once\n31:3 Comment: Midlosbrough footballers are thrown onto the ball because they can afford another line of defense behind them.\n31:9 Comment: Bullerin, Chamberland.\n31:25 Comment: Sanchez. By weight! Wocott would put his foot under this ball. It feels like Wocat is in every episode\n31:32 Comment: not trying 100% to finalize. Well, it seems like he lifted his leg already, but didn’t straighten it out. It’s not a fact that he would get it,\n31:46 Comment: but this desire is not visible in him. Although I repeat, according to statistics, Wocott is now absolutely the best in\n31:58 Comment: Arsenal's attack at the start of this season. Although, let’s say, the English team does not show such results.\n32:20 Comment: For Arsene Wenger, memories of Midlosbrough are not generally pleasant ones.\n32:24 Comment: For the most part, Arsenal always beat this team. Victor Valdos will take the ball into his hands now.\n32:33 Comment: But there was also defeat. Also at the old Khyber stadium. Arsenal's only home match in matches\n32:47 Comment: v Midlosbrough. And this was a defeat when Arsenal players, Edu and Silvinho, scored two own goals.\n33:0 Comment: This defeat in April 2001 deprived Arsenal of the title of champions of England,\n33:7 Comment: opportunities to compete for the title of champions of England and the Manchester United carnival.\n34:16 Comment: In a series of duels at the top, the ball of Midlosbrough footballer Negredo mostly wins.\n34:31 Comment: High pass to Baragana. He throws it to Adam Trore. For some reason I didn't go. First time Troure\n34:38 Comment: went for a ball that could potentially win. Baragan went. Cross by Negredo. Already in flight\n34:47 Comment: He began to hurt his hands and wondered if he should fall now. As a result, he didn’t fall or struggle.\n34:53 Comment: Volkat. 1v1 went to beat. No, he just ran around his opponent. I gave the ball to Maslotilov. A little bit\n35:0 Comment: slowed down. Arsenal attack. Bellarin plays to the right. Chamberlin serve. Ulikos Perez is still absolutely\n35:8 Comment: not noticeable in Arsenal's attack after coming on as a substitute. Bellarin. Ozio. The cross should be played by Victor Valdez.\n35:20 Comment: But Sanchez tried to confuse the Pyramid’s goals until the last moment.\n35:41 Comment: Arsenal had a match against Southampton this season, when the team snatched a victory by 94\n35:46 Comment: minute thanks to a penalty converted by Santikas Orla. And some time after that\n35:52 Comment: Arsenal also achieved an away victory in the match in the last minutes during commentary time\n35:56 Comment: vs Burnley. So, of course, we can say that Miduz Brock has almost done his job,\n36:7 Comment: but this must be done with extreme caution. Arsenal is the team that doesn't give up until the last minute.\n36:12 Comment: and from previous seasons, and I remember. The famous match against Leicester, which in the end did not deprive\n36:18 Comment: championship list and did not give Arsenal much of a chance to compete for first place. But nonetheless.\n36:27 Comment: Dani Welbeck's goal. Then he brought victory to Arsenal. Perez. Volkat. This is not a shot towards the goal, it is a poke towards the goal.\n36:40 Comment: Now Lucas Perez has assisted his teammates quite well several times.\n36:55 Comment: 17 million pounds. A significant amount indeed. In general, Arsenal, which scolds for the lack\n37:3 Comment: This is a transfer window. It penetrated itself very solidly. 35 million in Mustafa, 34 in Jaco, 17 in Perez.\n37:14 Comment: This is despite the fact that, in fact, only Sergic Nabri was sold for less than 5 million pounds.\n37:20 Comment: Danger Volkat. Simply because Arsenal does not have many people, there is simply nowhere to sell. And so the total amount\n37:27 Comment: The £88 million spent this summer is a record high in recent memory. Even then\n37:32 Comment: We bought Sanchez two years ago, we remember the same Welbeck. Then who came? Chambers is still here\n37:41 Comment: to the team of Mathieu Debuchy. Then we spent less. Almost £10 million less.\n37:50 Comment: True, last year Arsenal did not buy a single player except Fetr Cech. Volkat.\n37:59 Comment: But Arsene Wenger recently announced that Arsenal is emerging from austerity mode.\n38:7 Comment: The £390m stadium built 10 years ago is no longer the same\n38:20 Comment: Arsenal is facing a difficult time. And so the team will now strengthen. Ready to spend.\n38:27 Comment: In return, Danny appears on the field in place of Gaston Ramirez. I ran into Ruguayets today. Had\n38:35 Comment: several good chances. In general, from behind it worked as it should. Therefore he has the right\n38:43 Comment: according to additional support, go beyond the field. Well, Stewart Downing is a figure for Middlesbrough,\n38:53 Comment: it simply does not have any analysts in terms of the scale of its popularity. Middlesbrough native, educated\n39:0 Comment: this club is a UEFA finalist. But, having been relegated to the championship in 2009, he did not want to stay. Decided\n39:10 Comment: fight your way into the Premier League with other teams. And after various wanderings I stopped\n39:22 Comment: Liverpool, Wastham. Returned unexpectedly last year to the same championship and raised his\n39:29 Comment: command from there. So, Arsene Wenger and his arsenal, the birthday boy, deserves\n39:38 Comment: something... to talk about. Arsene Wenger said that the next coach, his successor,\n39:45 Comment: it will be much easier. The club will spend more money to strengthen its squad. Moreover,\n39:51 Comment: They have laid the necessary foundation in their arsenal. There is no doubt about it. Arsene Wenger did this\n39:56 Comment: relatively little work. And so Arsenal can now... somehow the fans can expect from\n40:4 Comment: Arsenal not only places in the top four and a place above Tottenham, as has been the case for the last 20 years,\n40:9 Comment: but also claims to the championship. Arsenal had good chances last year, but...\n40:17 Comment: Who knew this would happen to Lester?\n40:31 Comment: However, for the entire 20 years that Wenger was in Arsenal's role, the team took places in the first\n40:40 Comment: and Thursday. When you think about it that way, this is a phenomenal achievement. The team won the title three times,\n40:49 Comment: more times than anyone else has won the English title. Arsene Wenger four times\n41:5 Comment: The team came third and six times second and Thursday.\n41:18 Comment: Arsenal also consistently made it through the group stage of the Champions League. Perez took the ball over the baseline.\n41:25 Comment: Even defender Gibson escorted him into the tackle. 87th minute of the match.\n41:42 Comment: Wenger simply demands from his players\n41:47 Comment: put the squeeze on his opponent on this special day for him. Victor Valdez knocks the ball out. There is also\n41:52 Comment: time at the arsenal. Maybe 6-7 minutes.\n42:5 Comment: Czech.\n42:22 Comment: Sanchez.\n42:32 Comment: A cutting pass for the beginning of Montreal, but Baragan is already rising in front of him. And Trore.\n42:38 Comment: He falls onto the lawn, but shows that he violated Montreal rules on it. Dishonorable too it seemed so\n42:44 Comment: but the ball is behind the sideline anyway. Ozil. Chamberlain.\n42:52 Comment: Mustafi connection. Mustafi's cross. And Leoyala's compulsion. Chamberlain. Another cast on horseback.\n43:6 Comment: Another serve from Mustafi.\n43:12 Comment: And Trore's counterattack. Let's see how much strength he still has left in the 89th minute.\n43:18 Comment: Great bass on Negredu. If there is no offside, there is no offside. Negredu decided to bring it to perfection\n43:25 Comment: his position, removing, practically removing Laurent Koselnin for the makin. But that cunning fox did not fall for this deceptive move.\n43:47 Comment: This would be the story if Negredu could now beat Laurent Koscielny, and then also Petr Cech.\n43:56 Comment: And Adam Atrelred would definitely deserve the title of best player of the meeting, as it was organized in the 90s.\n44:4 Comment: But, unfortunately, it didn’t work out.\n44:6 Comment: The whistle sounded. But he really ended up on the lawn with Negred’s help.\n44:10 Comment: Well, of course, it’s interesting which teams Alver Negred played for in England. Machister City, Machister Canned, Machister Canned.\n44:18 Comment: But, of course, it didn’t work out.\n44:20 Comment: And, of course, it didn’t work out.\n44:22 Comment: But, of course, it didn’t work out.\n44:24 Comment: And, of course, it didn’t work out.\n44:38 Comment: Alver Negred played in Aglia. Machister City and Milos Brown.\n44:41 Comment: So different in style of play, in the amount of time spent with the ball in attack.\n44:57 Comment: How to evaluate his performance now?\n44:59 Comment: How's Len?\n45:3 Comment: Mike Dean adds five minutes.\n45:5 Comment: It is unclear where he got them from.\n45:8 Comment: There were no heads.\n45:10 Comment: Not all replacements were made.\n45:12 Comment: Only three for two teams.\n45:19 Comment: But in England this is the way it is.\n45:21 Comment: In England they love football too much to be limited by the rules,\n45:27 Comment: according to which a specific number of seconds corresponds to a specific stop.\n45:32 Comment: Mustafi.\n45:54 Comment: Biljarin.\n46:26 Comment: Mustafi.\n46:28 Comment: Biljarin.\n46:52 Comment: Billyarim.\n46:54 Comment: He is also no longer on the field, so Anya makes up for the Uruguayan loss of the peasantry.\n47:4 Comment: Ozio is stronger.\n47:10 Comment: Nastafia.\n47:17 Comment: Again he pulls the cud here with the arsenal in the middle of the field.\n47:20 Comment: Three minutes remain until the end of stoppage time, and so far the most dangerous moments remain the chances around Petr Cech's goal.\n47:34 Comment: Except for the mistake of Victor Valdez and the situation when the ball flew over the head of Laurent Kvestov at the very beginning of the second half.\n    \n\n    #######TASK \n    Provide a factually correct and detailed textual description of the game compiled from the information presented above from different sources, in more than 1000 words.\n            \"Cap:\": represents the captions published in the online portal usually within 30 seconds of the event.\n            \"E:\" represents events recorded exactly after the event happened.\n            \"Comment.\": represents the real-time noisy commentary from the commentator as the game progresses.\n    Don't mention sources of information like commentators or captions, write as if you saw them live.\n    \n    ",
    "summary": "The match between Arsenal and Middlesbrough ended in a goalless draw, a contest rich with moments that beg analysis, yet strikingly absent of goals. The game unfolded under the watchful eye of Mike Dean, with assistance from Simon Long and Ian Hassin, and backup from the fourth official, Tim Robinson.\n\nFrom the opening minutes, it became apparent that Arsenal, playing at their Emirates Stadium, were intent on setting the pace. They faced a Middlesbrough side that last played Arsenal in the Premier League in 2009, a season when Middlesbrough faced relegation despite putting up a fight.\n\nArsenal, favorites in this matchup, aimed to capitalize on their strong form to potentially rise to the top of the Premier League table. However, Middlesbrough, despite their struggles this season and sitting just above the relegation zone, had demonstrated a surprising resilience in away matches. This resilience was finely balanced against Arsenal's own aspirations of leadership, having already garnered significant points and demonstrating formidable ball control this season.\n\nThe early narrative was predominantly Arsenal, who exerted considerable pressure through their possession play, commanding 87% of the ball in the initial stages. This resulted in numerous orchestrations of passes between the likes of Hector Bellerin, Mesut Ozil, Mohamed Elneny, Theo Walcott, and Alex Iwobi. However, Boro’s compact defensive configuration, often placing ten men behind the ball, stifled Arsenal's usual fluency and penetration in the final third. \n\nA prominent early moment came when Alexis Sanchez set up a free-kick opportunity, only for Valdes to thwart it with precision. Such moments of individual brilliance were few and far between, with Arsenal's best chances stemming from set-piece situations. \n\nIn the first half, Middlesbrough made headlines not just for their defensive solidity but also for generating dangerous counter-attacks. Gaston Ramirez and Adama Traore, in particular, showcased blistering pace and directness, which unsettled the Arsenal defense. The most notable chance for Middlesbrough arrived when Laurent Koscielny misjudged a ball, allowing Traore to race through and force a crucial save from Petr Cech. This was Middlesbrough's cue to tighten their approach even further, with Koscielny and Mustafi bumping into minor scares occasionally but persisting in their efforts to marshall the backline effectively.\n\nDespite enjoying extensive possession and the lion's share of field control, Arsenal struggled to breakthrough Boro's defensive lines. Players like Walcott, known for his keen awareness and clinical finishing, found themselves stifled, though not for lack of effort. Passes oscillated across the midfield with precision yet found the final delivery wanting against a stolid Middlesbrough defense helmed by Ben Gibson and Daniel Ayala. The defensive performance of Middlesbrough was remarkable, each player taking their role earnestly, reflecting on manager Aitor Karanka’s tactical drilling.\n\nAdding to Boro’s robust play were decisions made on the squad composition. Notably, experienced players like Stuart Downing were left on the bench, showcasing Karanka’s confidence in his chosen XI, a confidence that, as the match progressed, appeared to yield dividends in defensive rigidity and swift counter-play.\n\nSignificant moments flowed into the second half, with both teams vying against the ticking clock. Arsenal’s approach saw them frequently bombarding the wings, with seamless interchanges between Sanchez and Ozil designed to exploit any rare defensive lapses. One such piercing combination in the 53rd minute saw Ozil snap a pass after a brilliant overhead pass by Sanchez, leading to a close effort which Valdes had to keenly intervene.\n\nTheo Walcott, who had been in sterling form so far for the season with eight goals in all competitions, was surprisingly subdued. His attempts to cut inside or deliver dangerous balls were often met with sturdy challenges from the full-backs or interceptions from central defenders. Nevertheless, his effort remained unyielding, launching probing runs and creating space albeit without the necessary end product.\n\nAnother critical juncture was in the seventh-minute substitute period of the second half when Arsene Wenger pitched Lucas Perez into the fray, hoping for a breakthrough. Perez, noted for his smart runs and keen finishing, did inject vivacity but found little daylight through Middlesbrough’s coordinated effort in defense.\n\nHeading into the final stages, the urgency for a goal became palpable, especially with Arsenal pushing further players into the offensive front, leaving them sporadically vulnerable to counter-attacks. Adama Traore, whose speed had earlier troubled Arsenal, had another opportunity to exploit the gaps, yet the conclusive moment alluded him once more as Koscielny made a critical intervention, preserving the clean sheet.\n\nClocking into stoppage time, frustration brewed for Arsenal as they were met with resolute defending from Middlesbrough, coupled with timely clearances and crucial interceptions. Each minute added felt like an eternity for both sets of supporters as the game remained delicately poised.\n\nIn the end, despite both sides manufacturing sporadic chances, neither could capitalize. Arsenal’s statistics pointed to domination in possession, yet the effectiveness in front of goal was clearly lacking. Conversely, Middlesbrough’s defensive paradigm coupled with sharp counter-intentions drew praise for their tactical execution via players like Ramirez and Traore.\n\nThis 0-0 draw left Arsenal standing on the cusp of what could have been a celebratory climb on their manager’s birthday. For Middlesbrough, it was a testament to disciplined defending and tactical maturity. The match underscored the essence of football’s unpredictability - a game with overarching control by one team yet punctuated efforts and stiff guarding by the other.\n\nIn retrospect, Arsenal may reflect on the lack of clinical finishing as well as the absence of decisive links between their midfield supremacy and the forward line. Middlesbrough, on the other hand, will likely take this as a motivational template to build upon, especially highlighting that points can be snatched even from the giants of the Premier League with the right mix of defensive diligence and opportunistic attack.\n\nAs the final whistle blew, both managerial camps had elements to ponder. Wenger’s Arsenal, possessing but faltering in the final strokes, and Karanka’s Middlesbrough, stringent in defense yet lacking the cutting edge to complete a full-scale upset. A match rich in moments, tactical complexity, yet devoid of that singular definitive event - a goal."
