failed to score twice here in 18 games under Klopp,\n0:8 Comment: so as you say, West Brom will be defensively minded, but can Liverpool break them down?\n0:13 Comment: Liverpool will need to capitalise on draws today for Spurs and Arsenal,\n0:18 Comment: with Manchester City playing tomorrow, they know they'll win by two goals today,\n0:23 Comment: and they will be top of the table.\n0:25 Comment: Liverpool have been unbeaten in eight games since they lost against Burnley,\n0:28 Comment: they haven't lost here at Anfield since January,\n0:31 Comment: and Monday's 0-0 draw against Manchester United was their first clean sheet of the season.\n0:35 Comment: West Brom have been the draw specialist recently, three successive 1-0 draws,\n0:40 Comment: and the last three meetings between these two sides have ended all square as well.\n0:46 Comment: FANS CHANT\n0:55 Comment: Given away by Matip, and Romdon can have his first run,\n0:58 Comment: although Matip has become a fixture at centre-back in the last few weeks,\n1:3 Comment: the summer signing for Liverpool is there to tidy things up.\n1:7 Comment: Here's Milner, who's been operating as a left-back very effectively\n1:11 Comment: since winning the shirt from Moreno.\n1:16 Comment: FANS CHANT\n1:23 Comment: Milner to Emre Can, and then Milner on the move from left-back,\n1:28 Comment: and Craig Dawson was there to head it away for West Bromwich Albion.\n1:40 Comment: I think the system they play with Firmino in the side really suits Liverpool,\n1:44 Comment: with a force number 9, that allows Coutinho or Mane to run into the space as he leaves.\n1:51 Comment: Coutinho gives it back to the liner, and it was an interesting ball in towards Firmino and Mane.\n1:57 Comment: Now Chan, Philippe Coutinho, some space out wide here for Sadio Mane,\n2:4 Comment: Neon across there to close him down.\n2:8 Comment: And there was contact, and Neil Sjogre has a look, and in fact the assistant over there,\n2:13 Comment: Richard West, indicated quite clearly that the contact was instigated by Mane.\n2:20 Comment: Yes, Mane tries to take Neon on the outside, that's a correct decision,\n2:24 Comment: if you look at Mane's left leg, he put it in between Neon's leg,\n2:28 Comment: so that's a correct decision for me from the linesman and the referee.\n2:33 Comment: There you see.\n2:36 Comment: Good decision, no penalty.\n2:37 Comment: It's really good rotation from Liverpool though, you see this West Brom side coming with a back 4-5\n2:42 Comment: across to defend and defend, but the three up front and Lallana, their movement,\n2:47 Comment: there's no positions for them really, can go anywhere on the pitch.\n2:50 Comment: There is Lallana, and now Firmino, and Liverpool have started with a nice tempo about them,\n2:56 Comment: something it took them a while to find against Manchester United on Monday night.\n3:0 Comment: Now Coutinho.\n3:20 Comment: Often sees the funny side, doesn't he, JÃ¼rgen Klopp, but what an impact he's had here again at Liverpool.\n3:24 Comment: It's a year to the day since the first match against Rubin Kazan,\n3:26 Comment: and there's been quite a transformation here.\n3:28 Comment: It certainly has, Darren, and I think Lovren was saying in that interview before the game\n3:32 Comment: how they're brave, they're attacking, and that's what he wants from his team,\n3:36 Comment: he wants them to enjoy their football, smile on their face.\n3:39 Comment: And he's certainly got that from the Liverpool players.\n3:55 Comment: Away by Lovren, and then Dawson can send it back the other way.\n4:0 Comment: Here's Coutinho.\n4:3 Comment: Clepsha working hard to get back for West Brom.\n4:15 Comment: Only Manchester City and Arsenal have scored more goals than Liverpool\n4:19 Comment: in the Premier League this season, they got four at Arsenal.\n4:22 Comment: And here against Leicester, five against Hull four weeks ago,\n4:26 Comment: and when they do hit their stride and get the early goal in matches,\n4:30 Comment: they really can be an irresistible team to try and slow down,\n4:33 Comment: and that's the job that Tony Pulas and his players have here today.\n4:38 Comment: Chance here for Nasser Chadli to bring it forward.\n4:41 Comment: He's been in really good form for West Brom in recent weeks,\n4:45 Comment: whether it be creating goals or scoring goals.\n4:47 Comment: And the flag up there against Salomon Rondon.\n4:50 Comment: He just saw that example there, where West Brom have won the ball,\n4:54 Comment: Chadli's going, he's trying to get forward,\n4:57 Comment: can't pass that first ball forward, there's not enough support going up there,\n5:0 Comment: and the first pass goes backwards.\n5:2 Comment: And you just fear that West Brom, if they can't get a ball to go forward,\n5:6 Comment: or at least square first, they can't get out from this Liverpool side,\n5:10 Comment: they're pinning them in.\n5:21 Comment: That's it to Mane.\n5:24 Comment: Firmino, and then the ladder can move in,\n5:27 Comment: and Liverpool are going through the gears, and it falls for Coutinho.\n5:35 Comment: That's the position Coutinho loves, he hit one against David De Gea on Monday night,\n5:40 Comment: a great save from De Gea, and he just finds himself 18, 19 yards out,\n5:46 Comment: tries to bend in with his right foot, but...\n5:50 Comment: No good defending from West Brom.\n5:53 Comment: He's coming off his best season in goal-scoring terms for Liverpool,\n5:56 Comment: Coutinho got 12 last season, he's only got four this time around as well,\n6:1 Comment: and it's such an important aspect of a No. 10's job if they can weigh in\n6:5 Comment: with double figures in terms of goals as well.\n6:13 Comment: It's interesting that Fletcher, I know he's playing in a No. 10 shirt,\n6:16 Comment: but they've got three No. 10s at times, you know?\n6:20 Comment: That's the beauty of their rotation up front,\n6:22 Comment: he's playing out on the left a little bit now,\n6:24 Comment: and then he goes in, and he comes out again, and then somebody else goes in there.\n6:33 Comment: Milano to Firmino, and then Phillips got there in front of Chan.\n6:49 Comment: Coutinho's moved out towards this side that Glenn was talking about,\n6:58 Comment: can't keep it in play.\n7:2 Comment: It's so important for West Brom to support Rondon,\n7:6 Comment: you're right about Charlie Darin,\n7:8 Comment: in West Brom's last seven, he's been involved in City, scored four,\n7:13 Comment: Sisseton two, he's got a big role for this side today,\n7:17 Comment: when Rondon does get the ball he supports him.\n7:20 Comment: Got himself back in the Belgium squad as well, hasn't he?\n7:23 Comment: After the early season performances, Nasser Chadli.\n7:31 Comment: Here's Olsen, a solitary change made by Tony Pulas today,\n7:34 Comment: Johnny Evans suspended, up it goes towards Rondon,\n7:38 Comment: who's a big target to find.\n7:40 Comment: Now Fletcher, Chan was there for Liverpool.\n7:47 Comment: Dawson forward from right back, who can tease one in towards McLean and Rondon.\n7:53 Comment: Yeah, this is in West Brom, they had four men in the box,\n7:56 Comment: Fletcher tried to put the ball in, committed men forward,\n8:0 Comment: offensive ball from Dawson was overhead.\n8:3 Comment: It's good to see one of the full-backs joining in, going up that high.\n8:7 Comment: To make the extra man.\n8:12 Comment: I think they'll do it, but they'll do it when they've got really composed possession,\n8:16 Comment: that there's no threat that they can get hit on the break from Liverpool.\n8:24 Comment: Away by McCauley, who was a key man for Northern Ireland\n8:27 Comment: at the European Championships in the summer.\n8:30 Comment: You can see all of the scores going through the bottom of the screen\n8:32 Comment: from the early games in the Premier League today.\n8:37 Comment: That's McLean, challenge made on him by Clyde.\n8:41 Comment: Neom's ball in, which wasn't dealt with by Matip.\n8:44 Comment: Milner was there, though, behind him for Liverpool.\n8:48 Comment: And Firmino can have a run against Olsen,\n8:50 Comment: and just a little push there by the Brazilian on the Swede.\n8:54 Comment: And we'll be discussing all of those goals, by the way,\n8:56 Comment: on the Premier League tonight from eight o'clock,\n8:59 Comment: with Jake, Maka, Michael and Glenn Hoddle here on BT Sport.\n9:14 Comment: THEY CHANT\n9:26 Comment: Dawson arriving towards this one, away by Clyde.\n9:34 Comment: Claudio Jakob, who's one of two players who'll be suspended\n9:38 Comment: if they get a yellow card today.\n9:39 Comment: Jordan Henderson of Liverpool is the other one.\n9:42 Comment: McCauley up towards Rondon and away by Nathaniel Clyde.\n9:57 Comment: Jakob in there quickly on Lallana,\n9:59 Comment: who'll have to do lots of that central midfield today.\n10:13 Comment: Phillips is the target for this long ball,\n10:16 Comment: and away by Dejan Lovren.\n10:19 Comment: Push there by McLean on Nathaniel Clyde,\n10:23 Comment: but you can see Robbie Kearney already in the match\n10:25 Comment: how much confidence Liverpool are playing with.\n10:27 Comment: Yeah, they're knocking about well, Darren,\n10:29 Comment: obviously they've had not many opportunities yet,\n10:32 Comment: Mane against Niamh when the referee got it right,\n10:35 Comment: no penalty, but just want to see him move the ball a little bit sharp,\n10:38 Comment: a little bit quicker, and surprisingly not pressing West Bromwood,\n10:41 Comment: and West Bromwood a bit higher.\n10:43 Comment: United start really well here on Monday night against them,\n10:47 Comment: put them under pressure,\n10:49 Comment: and I think West Bromwood have been quite comfortable\n10:51 Comment: when they've had the ball in their own final third,\n10:54 Comment: been allowed to play.\n11:3 Comment: There's Fletcher,\n11:5 Comment: looks like a bit of a gamble.\n11:7 Comment: That's the point I'm saying, Darren,\n11:8 Comment: the first look was backwards there,\n11:9 Comment: they've got to get turned and play forward to get out,\n11:12 Comment: and they've got a chance in this game,\n11:13 Comment: but Fletcher again, third time he's gone backwards first.\n11:18 Comment: Firmino dropping a bit deep at this time,\n11:21 Comment: out to Clyde,\n11:23 Comment: Mane was the intended recipient,\n11:25 Comment: but Liverpool get it back again through Henderson.\n11:28 Comment: Now Lallana.\n11:32 Comment: Coutinho.\n11:33 Comment: Thought about hitting it.\n11:37 Comment: Now Chan.\n11:39 Comment: Mildred available out wide.\n11:45 Comment: West Brom doing exactly what United did on Monday, Darren.\n11:49 Comment: When Liverpool have the ball, it's a back six and three in front,\n11:51 Comment: just leaving Rondon up front,\n11:53 Comment: Ibrahimovic's done that on Monday for United,\n11:56 Comment: so they've obviously watched that game\n11:57 Comment: and are in pretty good shape,\n11:58 Comment: and they've got a chance to get back in the game.\n12:2 Comment: They're playing the same tactics.\n12:6 Comment: There's Clyde,\n12:7 Comment: concentration of course so important\n12:10 Comment: for those defensive players for West Brom today,\n12:12 Comment: here's Mane looking to burst in,\n12:14 Comment: Olsen was across there.\n12:17 Comment: Could have picked an easier game,\n12:18 Comment: couldn't he, Janos Olsen, to make his comeback in,\n12:20 Comment: but Jonny Evans suspended today against this Liverpool team,\n12:23 Comment: Glenn, that's full of goals.\n12:25 Comment: Not very much, he knows he's going to be defending\n12:28 Comment: and it's panned out that way,\n12:30 Comment: he's a really good solid professional,\n12:32 Comment: he'll do his job, he'll head it,\n12:33 Comment: and he'll get to play forward if he can,\n12:36 Comment: but the main thing is to make sure\n12:38 Comment: he gives no space at all to Firmino\n12:41 Comment: and anyone else that's making runs in there.\n12:43 Comment: Just look here, McLean on the left-hand side,\n12:45 Comment: there's a full-back,\n12:46 Comment: Phillips here on the right-hand side,\n12:48 Comment: when Liverpool have comfortable possession.\n12:53 Comment: Plenty of licence therefore for the likes of Matip\n12:56 Comment: to bring it forward from the back.\n12:58 Comment: Here's Lallana.\n13:0 Comment: Now Clyde.\n13:3 Comment: Emre Can.\n13:9 Comment: Coutinho into Firmino,\n13:10 Comment: and then back to Coutinho,\n13:12 Comment: but West Brom able to win it back\n13:14 Comment: and now they can counter.\n13:18 Comment: Play through here to Phillips,\n13:20 Comment: who's in and Rondon was the man in the middle\n13:22 Comment: who was looking to find.\n13:25 Comment: There's three players there,\n13:26 Comment: Chadley, Rondon and Phillips,\n13:28 Comment: all looking to counter-attack effectively\n13:30 Comment: from West Brom and it's almost worked for them.\n13:31 Comment: I tell you what, Firmino does so well there\n13:34 Comment: to track the run.\n13:35 Comment: I think he was a bit fortunate\n13:36 Comment: because as Phillips played the ball inside,\n13:39 Comment: I think they've just clipped Firmino on the heel\n13:40 Comment: which would have stopped a certain goal.\n13:45 Comment: That was a great, wonderful break from West Brom\n13:48 Comment: and the first ball, as I said,\n13:49 Comment: went forward from Chadley.\n13:50 Comment: Phillips makes a great run inside.\n13:52 Comment: He's tried to play it across to him,\n13:54 Comment: he's got back there to centre-forward\n13:56 Comment: and done tremendously well,\n13:58 Comment: but that's what West Brom are looking to do.\n14:0 Comment: They're looking to break on them\n14:2 Comment: and they've got some legs to do it as well\n14:3 Comment: and Liverpool have got to defend right\n14:6 Comment: on the attack.\n14:8 Comment: There's the warning sign for Liverpool.\n14:11 Comment: Here's Milder.\n14:17 Comment: Phillips has dropped back\n14:18 Comment: into that defensive position now.\n14:20 Comment: Coutinho, Jordan Henderson,\n14:24 Comment: Nathaniel Clyde.\n14:29 Comment: Klane was in there firmly for West Brom and Shelby.\n14:33 Comment: And then Jakob gives it away.\n14:38 Comment: Now Milder.\n14:42 Comment: It was good defending, Darren, wasn't it, from Matip?\n14:44 Comment: You know, he's been brilliant\n14:46 Comment: since he's come to this football club.\n14:47 Comment: He started the last eight games\n14:49 Comment: and when he started those,\n14:51 Comment: they were very good.\n14:52 Comment: Chant, Milder.\n15:0 Comment: Away by McCauley.\n15:2 Comment: It's like it's going to be one of those matches\n15:3 Comment: where the two Liverpool full-backs will play\n15:6 Comment: in very advanced positions.\n15:7 Comment: There's not been much in the way of defending\n15:9 Comment: for either Clyde or Milder to do so far.\n15:12 Comment: Both of them are very comfortable playing that way.\n15:17 Comment: And then there's the warning sign for West Brom.\n15:19 Comment: Both of them are very comfortable playing that way.\n15:24 Comment: Here's Adam Lallana, and now Sadio Mane.\n15:33 Comment: Savino, back to Mane,\n15:35 Comment: that just opens up West Brom a little bit.\n15:37 Comment: But there was Claudio Jakob\n15:39 Comment: to make a vital interception inside his own box.\n15:41 Comment: And that's what he's in the team for,\n15:43 Comment: getting himself into those positions,\n15:45 Comment: covering for centre-halves,\n15:47 Comment: good midfield play.\n15:49 Comment: And that's it.\n16:8 Comment: It's Mane, good ball out to him by Coutinho,\n16:10 Comment: but Neon was there for West Brom,\n16:12 Comment: and then Olsen.\n16:15 Comment: Al Henderson.\n16:19 Comment: You can see the difference.\n16:35 Comment: Good ball in by Nathaniel Clyde,\n16:37 Comment: only McCauley was there for West Brom.\n16:39 Comment: Tried to get the ball in a bit earlier this time, Liverpool.\n16:46 Comment: Firmino playing as a false number nine,\n16:48 Comment: if he's in that position,\n16:51 Comment: if he takes a gamble and gets in that six-yard box.\n16:54 Comment: Coutinho is going to hit one this time.\n16:58 Comment: McCauley was in the way.\n17:4 Comment: Now Clyde.\n17:12 Comment: Mane taking on Neon.\n17:13 Comment: Oh, no.\n17:17 Comment: There's defensive work for McClain to do.\n17:19 Comment: Back to Henderson, lifted in towards Milner,\n17:23 Comment: who got between West Brom and Chelsea,\n17:25 Comment: with defenders that couldn't keep the header down.\n17:30 Comment: There's the example you were talking about, Fletch,\n17:32 Comment: about the full-backs for Liverpool\n17:34 Comment: not really having to defend too much.\n17:35 Comment: Look where he is.\n17:37 Comment: He's like the wide left winger getting into the far post.\n17:40 Comment: West Brom are dropping so far, so deep, so early,\n17:44 Comment: that's allowing them to do that,\n17:45 Comment: and that's on the opposite side of the pitch.\n17:49 Comment: As Jurgen Klopp and Tony Pulas,\n17:51 Comment: it was a bit lively between those two last season here,\n17:53 Comment: when Divock Origi scored six minutes into stoppage time\n17:57 Comment: to earn Liverpool a draw.\n17:59 Comment: Jurgen Klopp said it wasn't a friendly game,\n18:1 Comment: and Liverpool celebrated as a team, didn't they,\n18:5 Comment: in front of the Kop at full-time,\n18:8 Comment: which didn't necessarily please Tony Pulas too much.\n18:13 Comment: There's a little foul on Dawson there from Firmino.\n18:16 Comment: You know, Dawson is a threat from set-pieces,\n18:18 Comment: I'm not sure I'd go for this one.\n18:21 Comment: Joint top scorer last year, Fletch Dawson,\n18:24 Comment: with four goals.\n18:28 Comment: Only Salomon Rondon got more, didn't they, for West Brom,\n18:32 Comment: so as Robbie says, he is a threat from a set-piece,\n18:34 Comment: although he's just hanging out to this right-hand side\n18:37 Comment: for this one.\n18:40 Comment: It's in towards McLean,\n18:41 Comment: and the family are quite happy to see it close out of play.\n19:1 Comment: It's given away by Mane, but there was a handball in there.\n19:7 Comment: DARREN FLETCHER PLAYS HIS 62ND SUCCESSIVE PREMIER LEAGUE MATCH FOR WEST BROM\n19:14 Comment: He's never missed a league game since signing for them from Manchester United,\n19:18 Comment: and when you think what he went through with the health issues,\n19:20 Comment: it's astonishing that he's been able to come back and play with such regularity.\n19:25 Comment: Yeah, he's the heartbeat of this West Brommer,\n19:27 Comment: Jalby inside, in the middle of the park, the captain, the leader,\n19:31 Comment: drives people on.\n19:38 Comment: HOLDEN SIGNALS\n19:40 Comment: Holden by Coutinho, Olsen there.\n19:50 Comment: And Milner.\n19:52 Comment: HOLDEN SIGNALS\n19:53 Comment: Excellent dobby by Coutinho, and Emre Can can leave the Liverpool charge,\n19:56 Comment: here's Firmino, Mane's on the other side, Mane's there!\n20:0 Comment: What a fantastic goal!\n20:2 Comment: Absolutely brilliant from Liverpool!\n20:5 Comment: Started by the dobby from Coutinho, and finished off by Sari Omane.\n20:18 Comment: Absolutely wonderful goal, spaces...\n20:23 Comment: ...everywhere, just look at that dobby from Coutinho,\n20:26 Comment: and you were right, Chan takes a gamble.\n20:29 Comment: Lovely little pass from Firmino, Neon comes under the ball,\n20:33 Comment: but Mane watches it all the way, he's got his eyes focused on it,\n20:38 Comment: a little volley, side foot volley, great technique to keep his eyes on the ball,\n20:41 Comment: and side footed pass, Foster.\n20:44 Comment: Fantastic goal for Liverpool.\n20:47 Comment: That's absolutely fabulous, isn't it?\n20:49 Comment: Everything good about attacking football,\n20:51 Comment: the little glance over Coutinho's shoulder to let it go,\n20:55 Comment: the beautiful little weighted pass from Chan,\n20:58 Comment: so Firmino can cross it on the spot,\n21:0 Comment: and what a finish as well, he kept his head.\n21:2 Comment: Fabulous, fabulous football.\n21:5 Comment: Sari Omane's fourth goal of the season, fourth goal as a Liverpool player.\n21:10 Comment: Phillips with the ball at the other end, and Loris Karius from a comfortable catch.\n21:15 Comment: Well, that might just open up West Bromwich Yard a little bit,\n21:18 Comment: that first Liverpool goal, it's something they were able to do, Robbie,\n21:21 Comment: here on Monday against Manchester United to open them up,\n21:24 Comment: but it took something special, didn't it, to get the goal?\n21:27 Comment: Yeah, it was the dobby from Coutinho,\n21:28 Comment: just the awareness of the people around him,\n21:31 Comment: he knew that Chan was running behind him,\n21:34 Comment: you know, fantastic dobby,\n21:36 Comment: and Glenn's right, the way he passed from Chan to Firmino to cross it first time,\n21:41 Comment: it's a great goal.\n21:44 Comment: It reminded me of a throwback, you know, Fletcher,\n21:46 Comment: back in the 80s when they had their special team,\n21:48 Comment: when they had the movement, people running off the ball,\n21:51 Comment: a little dobby that Dalglish would have made there,\n21:54 Comment: what Coutinho made,\n21:55 Comment: and this crowd have been used to that sort of football over the years,\n22:0 Comment: but what a fabulous goal.\n22:5 Comment: It's only the second goal that West Brom have conceded\n22:8 Comment: in the first half of matches this season,\n22:11 Comment: Kevin Morales and Everton got the other one in stoppage time,\n22:14 Comment: they've been the best team defensively in the Premier League in the first half,\n22:16 Comment: so the fact that Liverpool have been able to get one so early in the match\n22:21 Comment: is something that hasn't been happening to West Brom and Tony Pujols this season.\n22:25 Comment: I mean, Tony bases his...\n22:28 Comment: He's got pride in the way his teams defend,\n22:30 Comment: but you know, sometimes you cannot defend against certain goals,\n22:33 Comment: and that was one of them, everything was perfect.\n22:44 Comment: Here's Mane.\n22:47 Comment: Firmino.\n22:48 Comment: Adam Lallana, Milner's made the run and Lallana spotted him early,\n22:55 Comment: found him with a really good ball.\n23:2 Comment: Now Coutinho.\n23:5 Comment: Dawson in the way.\n23:12 Comment: Chan had to use his straight fair to hold off Rondon.\n23:19 Comment: Adam Lallana is all over the field, Glenn, already in the match.\n23:23 Comment: He's been everywhere, hasn't he? He's got such quick feet,\n23:25 Comment: and also when he needs to, when you give him time, look, he'll get his head up,\n23:29 Comment: drive forward, and he had a beautiful pass to Milner in behind a minute ago.\n23:33 Comment: He really is up for this, he just needs to add some goals to his performances,\n23:37 Comment: and he'll be some player.\n23:39 Comment: It was McCaul, his challenge on Lallana, got there just in time.\n23:44 Comment: Here's Mane, and now Clyde.\n23:46 Comment: Firmino had just stayed out there on that right wing.\n23:55 Comment: Coutinho.\n23:58 Comment: So, anyway, Chan is the furthest forward on this occasion,\n24:1 Comment: and Ben Foster, who was nigh-unbeatable against Tottenham in the Premier League\n24:6 Comment: last weekend, off his line quickly for West Brom.\n24:9 Comment: Yeah, in this formation, Emery Chan does get forward,\n24:12 Comment: he had a chance against United, great safe under here in the week,\n24:17 Comment: but he's great pass to Firmino for the goal.\n24:23 Comment: He's a real good player, filling in for Wijnaldum.\n24:27 Comment: Dawson's ball in towards Phillips, and Matip was there for Liverpool.\n24:33 Comment: Powerful header by McCauley.\n24:34 Comment: And they're gonna get the free-kick here, West Brom as well,\n24:37 Comment: Jurgen Klopp didn't agree,\n24:40 Comment: judging by his body language on the technical area.\n24:44 Comment: Just going back to that point, I think that's where Klopp is really clever,\n24:47 Comment: those playing the two midfield players, Chan and Henderson,\n24:50 Comment: they can rotate, they're allowed to go into that penalty area.\n24:54 Comment: And if Chan goes, the other one sits, Henderson goes,\n24:57 Comment: and they're allowed to go into that penalty area.\n24:59 Comment: If Chan goes, the other one sits, Henderson goes, Chan sits,\n25:3 Comment: and it's a really good rotation from the deeper midfield players.\n25:10 Comment: Olsen's gone forward for the set-piece.\n25:16 Comment: Plenty of time here for Jordan Henderson.\n25:20 Comment: Fantastic ball out to Mane.\n25:24 Comment: You see there, he got a set-piece, it's cushioned into the centre for him,\n25:28 Comment: and he's got a fix on, McLean's 15 yards outside the box.\n25:34 Comment: That's gonna be West Brom's best opportunity, I believe,\n25:37 Comment: to score from the set-piece.\n25:39 Comment: But you've got to commit moving forward.\n25:42 Comment: A little flick by Coutinho to Lallana,\n25:44 Comment: and Fletcher was working hard, but too hard, according to Neil Swordrick.\n25:49 Comment: And a free-kick to Liverpool.\n25:52 Comment: Yeah, good pace from Lallana.\n25:55 Comment: A small amount of contact there from Fletcher.\n26:1 Comment: Here's Coutinho.\n26:3 Comment: He could descend it all the way out there to Nathaniel Clyne.\n26:10 Comment: Works some room for the cross, and sends a really good ball in as well.\n26:14 Comment: Emre Can was reaching for it and couldn't quite get there.\n26:18 Comment: There's that example of Chan getting in the penalty area.\n26:22 Comment: This is great, little drop of the shoulder, brings him inside,\n26:24 Comment: takes him on the outside, and what a cross this is.\n26:27 Comment: Just waiting for a red shirt to get on the end of it,\n26:30 Comment: but it's really positive from Liverpool.\n26:32 Comment: Look at that beautiful ball in that corridor\n26:34 Comment: in between the keeper and the last defender.\n26:37 Comment: And the deep-lying midfield player gets in that box\n26:40 Comment: and almost gets himself a goal.\n26:45 Comment: You're tempted to say here, Robbie, that it's back to the drawing board\n26:49 Comment: for West Bromwich Albion, but there doesn't seem to be too much\n26:51 Comment: they can do at this moment in time.\n26:54 Comment: No, Liverpool having all the possession,\n26:56 Comment: the quality of ball to Rondon's not being good,\n26:58 Comment: they've got no support to him.\n27:0 Comment: And the quality's in pieces,\n27:2 Comment: as the couple have been very disappointing so far for West Brom.\n27:13 Comment: Clyne's on the move again from right back,\n27:15 Comment: and you can see the idea there from Henderson.\n27:19 Comment: Lots of football coming your way on BT Sport.\n27:22 Comment: Next week, we'll see Liverpool again.\n27:23 Comment: They're at Selhurst Park against Crystal Palace.\n27:26 Comment: Coverage starts at five o'clock, BT Sport 1HD and 4K UHD.\n27:31 Comment: And then a doubleheader the following weekend.\n27:33 Comment: Chelsea against Everton is the game on Saturday, five o'clock start.\n27:37 Comment: And then the following day, we've got the North London Derby,\n27:40 Comment: Arsenal against Tottenham on Sunday, the 6th of November.\n27:44 Comment: Fireworks the night after bonfire night,\n27:46 Comment: quarter past 11 we start, BT Sport 1HD and 4K UHD.\n27:55 Comment: And a lobber against Rondon there.\n27:57 Comment: Referee decides to give the free kick to Liverpool,\n27:59 Comment: Rondon backing in.\n28:16 Comment: And it's a goal.\n28:20 Comment: Towards Lallana.\n28:26 Comment: You can see Liverpool, 204 passes compared to 51 to West Brom,\n28:31 Comment: but the thing, the pass accuracy, you know,\n28:33 Comment: they're finding their man, they're moving the ball quick,\n28:36 Comment: they've got the goal.\n28:39 Comment: Do those numbers count that West Brom have been passed to death, Glenn?\n28:42 Comment: I think the reason that is for, Aaron,\n28:45 Comment: is that Liverpool players, when they're in possession,\n28:48 Comment: they've always got someone 15, maximum 20 yards away\n28:52 Comment: that they can pass to, whereas West Brom at times,\n28:54 Comment: when they win it, it's 60 yards, 70 yards.\n28:56 Comment: And that's the major difference.\n28:58 Comment: That's why they're, they'll be able to be so accurate\n29:1 Comment: in their passing and the movement of the ball.\n29:3 Comment: Look at the rotation now, there's six players running off the ball\n29:6 Comment: for Liverpool when someone's in possession.\n29:11 Comment: It's sloppy from Karius, which gives West Brom the throw it.\n29:15 Comment: Karius is starting for the fourth successive match\n29:25 Comment: in the Premier League, preferred these days to Simon Mignolet.\n29:42 Comment: Dawson's got a decent long throw on him.\n29:45 Comment: That's what he chooses to do.\n29:47 Comment: He goes shorter instead to Chadley.\n29:50 Comment: Now Claudio Jakob.\n29:54 Comment: On by McLean, but through to Karius.\n30:5 Comment: More defending for Neon today,\n30:6 Comment: he gets a bit of help in there from Claudio Jakob as well.\n30:8 Comment: Here's McLean and now Chadley.\n30:12 Comment: West Brom at the moment, I think,\n30:13 Comment: just happy to hold on to the ball for a while.\n30:19 Comment: Here's Fletcher.\n30:22 Comment: Now James McLean and Lallana\n30:25 Comment: showing his defensive strength as well back there for Liverpool.\n30:33 Comment: Chadley can play it forward here to Salomon Rondon\n30:36 Comment: and then McLean and Phillips is waiting for the cross.\n30:39 Comment: And the block made over there by Nathaniel Clyne.\n30:41 Comment: He's got the finish from Clyne, not letting the cross come in.\n30:46 Comment: It is interesting though,\n30:47 Comment: when West Brom do get in the last third and get wide,\n30:50 Comment: they actually have got four players in that penalty area.\n31:2 Comment: Here's Fletcher.\n31:5 Comment: Now Jakob.\n31:8 Comment: And he's lost it there,\n31:10 Comment: but Lallana can bring it forward.\n31:11 Comment: Coutinho's making a run, Chan getting forward as well.\n31:15 Comment: Milner looking to join in from left-back too.\n31:18 Comment: Here's Lallana.\n31:20 Comment: And still Lallana!\n31:22 Comment: He tried to kick out the top corner and couldn't do it,\n31:25 Comment: but they're so dangerous, Liverpool,\n31:27 Comment: when you give the ball away in those areas.\n31:28 Comment: I think that sums up West Brom, negative.\n31:30 Comment: First off, to play the ball backwards to a centre-half.\n31:34 Comment: There's Lallana, tries to get that to his left foot,\n31:37 Comment: goes for that far corner.\n31:40 Comment: It's been so impressive so far, Adam Milner's work rate.\n31:45 Comment: I think when you look at him, Robbie,\n31:46 Comment: he's one of the main beneficiaries, isn't he, on the Jurgen Klopp?\n31:48 Comment: He's really flourished, hasn't he, here at Liverpool,\n31:51 Comment: since Klopp's been here.\n31:52 Comment: England are reaping the rewards as well at international level.\n31:56 Comment: Yeah, he's done really well, his movement.\n32:0 Comment: Looks like he's gained a yard of pace as well,\n32:2 Comment: the way he goes past people.\n32:5 Comment: It's given away by Thorsen to Jordan Henderson,\n32:7 Comment: and the minute they do lose it, West Brom,\n32:8 Comment: you can see the red shirts all start to make their runs.\n32:13 Comment: Here's Klein.\n32:17 Comment: El Mane, Coutinho.\n32:19 Comment: Coutinho always seems to have space when he's got the ball.\n32:23 Comment: Now Milner.\n32:27 Comment: Still manages to squeeze the cross in,\n32:29 Comment: and a big shout there from Ben Foster.\n32:32 Comment: Yeah, this is...\n32:33 Comment: This is terrible for Milner.\n32:35 Comment: I know they're going across the goalkeeper.\n32:36 Comment: OK, it was a bit too close to him for Mignolet.\n32:38 Comment: He tried to get there.\n32:41 Comment: At least it was the first time Milner tried to go on the outside.\n32:43 Comment: He's been coming back on that right foot,\n32:45 Comment: and Tony Poulos would have had that defence.\n32:47 Comment: Just squeezing out, as soon as he comes back on his right.\n32:49 Comment: But going on the outside causes you another problem.\n32:52 Comment: Chadley gave it away.\n32:54 Comment: He made the effort to score at the moment\n32:56 Comment: when there wasn't a lot going on just outside.\n32:59 Comment: Oh, yes, he would have got it.\n33:1 Comment: He had to have it.\n33:4 Comment: That's because of, you know,\n33:5 Comment: due to a previous experience where it may have been\n33:6 Comment: obvious that everybody was coming back another one,\n33:9 Comment: and it might have been unfair to everybody else in the team.\n33:12 Comment: But it helped to take that opportunity when\n33:14 Comment: they saw that everybody's back.\n33:16 Comment: So he was quite prepared for that to begin with.\n33:20 Comment: pewno.\n33:20 Comment: Taking he was saying get in there get in the box, but no they paid it short\n33:25 Comment: Me I'm up towards Shadley Klein was there for Liverpool and then Adam Lallana to for me know\n33:37 Comment: I'm Milda\n33:50 Comment: Roberto Firmino and Ray Chan Coutinho\n34:5 Comment: Marnie\n34:6 Comment: So interesting down when Liverpool attack\n34:9 Comment: They tend to leave a block in the middle of the pits of Chan Henderson\n34:13 Comment: Matt's it and love run that allows you all the other players to attack you can get your full books out\n34:18 Comment: Four bucks out the park and if it breaks down you're strong in the middle of the pie\n34:27 Comment: It's not going very far\n34:37 Comment: The link it's a do is putting on a bit of a show in the first half here at Anfield\n34:49 Comment: Well brilliant from continue that you gotta say\n34:54 Comment: Then you set my call the endorsement book for a cup of tea\n34:57 Comment: You know it's not half time yet, but it may as well be\n35:0 Comment: First all again Fletcher going backwards the ball bounces into Foster, okay\n35:6 Comment: He's missed hit the clearance\n35:8 Comment: But just watch this now both players dive in he is allowed to come inside on his right foot\n35:13 Comment: And beat Foster had his knee a post clip\n35:17 Comment: Well it's all stemmed from Fletcher isn't it I've said early on this free of four occasions where he's looked to go backwards first and\n35:24 Comment: To give you a goalkeeper a ball that's spinning in the air\n35:27 Comment: And it was really an awkward one for Foster, and he couldn't get a good clearance on it\n35:31 Comment: And it all stems from there, but wonderful finishing\n35:34 Comment: Always kind side and kept his head and just got Foster on the near post\n35:38 Comment: And I think this is now game over\n35:41 Comment: Thank you, so you do that dance on the television\n35:47 Comment: I screen an excellent attacking display hasn't it so far\n35:51 Comment: By Liverpool Coutinho and a big hand in the first goal with a dummy\n35:54 Comment: And the goal he just scored squeezing it into Foster's near post his fifth goal of the season Liverpool doubled their lead\n36:4 Comment: It's difficult to see at the moment what West Brom can do if anything to get themselves back in the game\n36:10 Comment: Well at the way they've been set up they can't get out\n36:13 Comment: That's the problem when I said it at the top of the show at the top of the game\n36:16 Comment: It's it's whether the midfield players can get that ball down and have the composure\n36:20 Comment: To get it into Chadley to get it into Rondon and that hasn't happened\n36:23 Comment: They've gone backwards as we've been saying and causing their own problems now for me on the run this time\n36:28 Comment: Port the foot in by yakking for West Brom\n36:43 Comment: So\n36:46 Comment: Many teams play this pattern though, don't you see the pattern nobody's taking a little bit of a risk\n36:50 Comment: We're one of the white men that they're going so far back for West Brom\n36:53 Comment: They're looking after the right back in the left back Milner and Clyne\n36:57 Comment: And sometimes you just think just let one of them stay up and see what they do take a risk\n37:13 Comment: Just\n37:20 Comment: Goes to show really, you know, man, you know, I got a lot of sticks for coming here and getting a draw, you know\n37:26 Comment: So it's just really hard to do when you set out as a more defensive team\n37:31 Comment: You've got a concentrate the mindsets different, you know and people say well you're not to come to Anfield only got a point\n37:37 Comment: It's a good point for your Jose Mourinho's men\n37:40 Comment: This is when you bury mine what happened to Arsenal on their own pitch on the opening weekend of what Liverpool were able to do\n37:45 Comment: It's Stanford bridge against Chelsea as well\n37:49 Comment: This Henderson and now client they're hunting more goals here Liverpool Firmino\n37:59 Comment: Putting on a show at times on a Liverpool the confidence is include them all that's wonderful still, isn't it?\n38:5 Comment: So back to play good vision lovely little skill one foot onto the other\n38:9 Comment: You got the fullback driving on through and my right and saying at this moment in time that they're top of the league to new up\n38:17 Comment: Yes, it would be enough wouldn't it those draws today for Spurs and Arsenal the Arsenal one particularly against Middlesbrough one that\n38:26 Comment: People didn't see coming Manchester City play tomorrow. So do Manchester United Liverpool will be topped\n38:31 Comment: If they could win the match by two clear goals\n38:34 Comment: They're doing that at the moment would be a fitting end the suppose in many ways to Jurgen Klopp's first full year in charge\n38:41 Comment: They've come a long way since that mill nil here\n38:44 Comment: in the Europa League against Ruben Kazan\n39:1 Comment: As\n39:11 Comment: Henderson Coutinho\n39:14 Comment: Champ\n39:20 Comment: Supported here by James Milner Philip Coutinho\n39:26 Comment: Lallana\n39:29 Comment: Savio Mane Lallana had never stopped running there\n39:33 Comment: Leon across for West Bromwich Albion\n39:37 Comment: And now what McLean could try and bring it the other way, but I've got about celebration from Mane got in there first\n39:58 Comment: Oh\n40:9 Comment: Power by yet Yakov on the Coutinho\n40:12 Comment: Oh\n40:27 Comment: Joel Matty on Nathaniel Klein is the Lana\n40:34 Comment: Swings another one forward for Firmino he gets there\n40:43 Comment: Now it's almost a wonderful pass wasn't it Milano opens his body up look at that\n40:51 Comment: Great ball in behind. He just couldn't quite get there could even make the movement again\n40:57 Comment: Some Champions League football to tell you about we've got the rematch between Manchester City and Barcelona on\n41:3 Comment: Tuesday the 1st of November 7 o'clock BT Sport 2 and 4k UHD and the following night Tottenham against Bayer\n41:10 Comment: Leverkusen that's on the 2nd of\n41:12 Comment: November from Wembley 7 o'clock BT Sport 2 4k UHD as well as every other Champions League match exclusively live on\n41:20 Comment: BT Sport\n41:23 Comment: It's a competition that Liverpool and Jurgen Klopp will be hoping to play in next season the Champions League and\n41:28 Comment: Pick their wits against some of your express\n41:32 Comment: Certainly heading in the right direction on that's good from Jack\n41:40 Comment: Just a yard short all over the park West Brom missing challenges\n41:46 Comment: You know Fletcher a great skill from Chani misses the challenge\n41:51 Comment: Well, there's a suspension for Claudio Yaka, but he basically talked his way in there didn't it\n41:56 Comment: Fifth booking this season so he's going to be suspended for the next one didn't really give Neil Swarbrick an option to the early\n42:3 Comment: nice\n42:5 Comment: Yes, I'm sorry\n42:7 Comment: I'm sorry\n42:19 Comment: Nice screaming the referees face\n42:27 Comment: You can see gonna be suspended now for the next game\n42:31 Comment: Come about next week, but now he's got hit booking\n42:34 Comment: He's got a long way to go with all them little quick-footed Liverpool players. They're shifting the ball. He's got a really\n42:40 Comment: Play discipline now if not, it'd be sent off\n42:50 Comment: Now what can West Brom do in the second half can they put another forward on our Robson can you know what?\n42:56 Comment: Are they just gonna?\n42:58 Comment: hope for the best and maybe just try and keep the score down just\n43:4 Comment: It would be a manager a Glenn\n43:8 Comment: Time we would have been thinking at 1 nil anything can happen\n43:11 Comment: We can get a set player whatever but the way this games panned out now at 2 nil\n43:14 Comment: And they're so dominant Liverpool. He's got to think about a change\n43:18 Comment: Even if he puts Chad Lee a lot closer to it\n43:22 Comment: And go for across and just let him float and play and it's getting out it's getting the break\n43:27 Comment: They can only hit Liverpool on there on the counter, but I haven't got the players to do it\n43:31 Comment: It's interesting when he spoke to Des Kelly before the game and death said Manchester United were able to hold them here on Monday\n43:36 Comment: And he said you did mention that was Manchester United. That's how hard it is\n43:40 Comment: He was under no illusions Tony Pulis when he came here today\n43:43 Comment: Those fears have been confirmed by Liverpool in the first half and of course\n43:47 Comment: They'll attack the Kop in the second half, which is often the end where they save their best stuff\n43:52 Comment: So that's all to come West Brom's way in the second half\n43:56 Comment: But they've been pretty irresistible haven't they so far here Liverpool in the first half of this one the goals from Sadio Mane\n44:3 Comment: Philippe Coutinho\n44:5 Comment: Liverpool with this comfortable 2-0 lead\n44:8 Comment: I\n44:10 Comment: Spoke give the ball again give it away again inside their own half\n44:15 Comment: Miss Chad\n44:17 Comment: Away by McCauley\n44:23 Comment: But she was almost caught in possession there by Coutinho\n44:29 Comment: Put in there from client\n44:32 Comment: Was bundled over by Olsen\n44:35 Comment: I'll just again sums of West Brom the pass from Chadley is behind\n44:40 Comment: James McLean, he's gonna have to turn he goes turns goes back and then\n44:44 Comment: Olsen tries to win the ball\n44:46 Comment: In front of money definite free kick now. I like to see what the boys think Michael a Mac at a halftime\n44:52 Comment: you know, it was a great first goal for Liverpool, but\n44:55 Comment: Neill's position, you know, did he did he get too much under the ball? Did he know where it where?\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: weekend since February the 27th when he injured his knee against Crystal Palace\n0:3 Comment: meant that he missed Northern Ireland's adventure at the Euros in the summer\n0:8 Comment: it's his second appearance of the season brings a lot of experience to this West\n0:12 Comment: Brom side but whether he can make a difference against the Liverpool team\n0:15 Comment: who are so impressive going forward in the first half remains to be seen.\n0:22 Comment: He's got a great left foot you know usually plays a left back but he's gone into\n0:26 Comment: another part instead of Jakob you know finally link up with Darren Fletcher but\n0:31 Comment: good luck to him.\n0:34 Comment: Liverpool attacking the Kop in the second half leading by two goals to nil and as it stands heading to the top of the table.\n0:41 Comment: Nathaniel Clyne and now Firmino.\n0:46 Comment: Brunt's first touches to get there in front of Philippe Coutinho which is\n0:50 Comment: something that West Brom players found difficult to do in the first half.\n1:1 Comment: Offside flag up against Firmino.\n1:6 Comment: Can they do anything tactically here in the second half Glenn West Brom to make\n1:11 Comment: it more competitive or is it down to eradicating the sort of mistakes that\n1:15 Comment: the boys were talking about at halftime?\n1:17 Comment: Well they haven't they haven't come out and changed things they've kept the same shape\n1:20 Comment: they've just put Brunt in there as the holding plough actually and Fletcher and\n1:23 Comment: Chadley but for me Chadley's the one that's got to get closer to your centre\n1:26 Comment: forward and almost at times take a bit of a risk and put two up there and come\n1:31 Comment: you know surprise surprise Liverpool.\n1:34 Comment: Xabio Mane's out for the second half he was limping at the end of the first.\n1:38 Comment: Here he is on the ball. Coutinho.\n1:42 Comment: Still Coutinho. This time they get a body in the way West Brom.\n1:50 Comment: Now Fletcher.\n1:52 Comment: Matt Phillips is through the forward for Albion. Here he is.\n2:1 Comment: Milner was there to dispossess him relatively straightforwardly.\n2:5 Comment: Done so well in the left-back position James Milner this season.\n2:8 Comment: He's got four goals obviously all from a penalty spot but in his general play I think he's been\n2:13 Comment: so good for this Liverpool side.\n2:20 Comment: Come on, come on.\n2:38 Comment: Here's Clyne.\n2:41 Comment: Lallana.\n2:51 Comment: Here's Matip.\n2:53 Comment: Clyne was in there for West Brom.\n2:55 Comment: And then Neom.\n2:57 Comment: Being closed down quickly by Firmino.\n2:59 Comment: En-ray Chan wins the header.\n3:1 Comment: Now Mane.\n3:3 Comment: Just look at that, the two-nil up, the closing down Firmino and then Chan wins the second ball.\n3:7 Comment: Then the rebound.\n3:9 Comment: And then the ball is in.\n3:17 Comment: Well done Firmino then Chan wins the second ball and then the regain possession.\n3:21 Comment: West Brom haven't gotten out of ball whatsoever.\n3:23 Comment: You know, ronde on against Matip and Lovren's getting no service whatsoever.\n3:27 Comment: As Glenn said there's nobody need him if he even does win the ball.\n3:32 Comment: They're going to make another change as well.\n3:34 Comment: It looks as though James Morrison is coming on.\n3:36 Comment: The slip has just been handed to the fourth official Lee Mason.\n3:40 Comment: So it's going to be another change for West Brom at the start of the second half.\n3:44 Comment: Here's Coutinho for Liverpool, and now Firmino,\n3:48 Comment: and Olsen had to get across and just lean on him a little bit to allow Foster to get there.\n3:52 Comment: Yeah, very good defending from Olsen on that occasion,\n3:56 Comment: he went with a run, he's seen it, just put his left arm across him,\n4:1 Comment: very good defending, Foster was alert to get out.\n4:15 Comment: Firmino, and now Henderson, Liverpool winning most of those second balls.\n4:21 Comment: Now Milner.\n4:25 Comment: His first excursion down the left in the second half, he made quite a few of those in the first.\n4:30 Comment: Now Coutinho, lots of space here for Clyde,\n4:35 Comment: slides one in, really important defending by Brunt.\n4:40 Comment: So much time and space there for Nathaniel Clyde for Liverpool.\n4:44 Comment: Now Emre Can, Coutinho, Lallana who was coming back from an offside position.\n4:57 Comment: They get in so many aggressive positions, that's come from Milner,\n5:2 Comment: that pass was back from Milner into Can and they change the play,\n5:6 Comment: and Clyde is as high up as Milner on the opposite side of the pitch,\n5:9 Comment: it's so difficult to defend there, if you've got somebody who can change the play,\n5:13 Comment: you get in all day long.\n5:18 Comment: Matt Phillips who's coming off for James Morrison.\n5:25 Comment: His only start this season, Morrison was in the League Cup tie against Northampton,\n5:30 Comment: coming off the bench in the Premier League for the fifth time.\n5:36 Comment: Rondon challenged by Lallana.\n5:47 Comment: Just like Morrison's gone into a midfield area,\n5:49 Comment: Chris Brun has just slightly moved over to that right-hand side.\n5:54 Comment: Which is quite a surprise.\n5:59 Comment: Tony Pulis has turned to two of the longest serving players at West Brom.\n6:6 Comment: It'll be interesting to see what really is in Tony's mind,\n6:12 Comment: has he put Brun over there to stop Milner getting forward?\n6:16 Comment: Has he been so dangerous getting down that left-hand side for Liverpool,\n6:19 Comment: or is it, have a go at him, get the ball down and run at him?\n6:23 Comment: Client to Henderson and Lallana was the player he was trying to pick out.\n6:36 Comment: Daniel Sturridge was on the bench again today.\n6:39 Comment: He's only started 32 of Liverpool's last 128 games in all competitions,\n6:45 Comment: despite that he was the top scorer last season.\n6:48 Comment: But it looks like a shape and a system at the moment, doesn't it,\n6:50 Comment: with Firmino as the false nine that suits Liverpool extremely well, Glenn?\n6:55 Comment: Well, it does today, and I think if Sturridge comes on and we play starts in the future,\n7:2 Comment: and one of those guys come out, I don't think there's that much difference.\n7:5 Comment: I think they've got so much rotation there, even if Sturridge is starting out at the top,\n7:9 Comment: he moves around just like Firmino, and that's what is the major asset for me in Liverpool,\n7:14 Comment: watching them play, the freedom that Klopp has given them.\n7:17 Comment: And the midfield just sorting it out a little bit more.\n7:21 Comment: The question now for Liverpool is, can they do it against the better teams?\n7:24 Comment: Can they play with this freedom against the very top teams?\n7:28 Comment: We'll find out in the coming weeks, won't we,\n7:29 Comment: they've got the rematch against Chelsea,\n7:32 Comment: and they've got Manchester City here as well on New Year's Eve.\n7:35 Comment: We'll bring you that game on BT Sport, there are big tests on the horizon for Liverpool.\n7:41 Comment: They've got Jorginho Wijnaldum back on the bench as well today after picking up that hip injury.\n7:46 Comment: There are all the scores from the earlier fixtures,\n7:49 Comment: you can see Tottenham and Arsenal were held scoreless in draws today,\n7:53 Comment: that means that if the result stays as it is here at Anfield, Liverpool will be top of the table.\n7:58 Comment: The champions Leicester back on track with a win in the Premier League against Crystal Palace,\n8:3 Comment: and a late winner for West Ham against Sunderland gives them back-to-back victories.\n8:9 Comment: We'll discuss all of those matches on Premier League Tonight with Jake and the team,\n8:13 Comment: who will be joined by Steve McManaman, Michael Owen and Glenn Hoddle from 8pm on BT Sport.\n8:21 Comment: Here's Emre Can for Liverpool.\n8:24 Comment: He was waiting for Milder, changed his mind and went to Coutinho.\n8:31 Comment: Klein, Firmino.\n8:39 Comment: Lallana, Firmino.\n8:42 Comment: Now Coutinho.\n8:49 Comment: Plenty of taste on the cross which was defended by Gareth McAuley, then hopped on its way by Neon.\n8:57 Comment: So comfortable for Liverpool, you know, wasn't he?\n9:0 Comment: That's going in a tackle as well.\n9:3 Comment: Must have some great eight-a-sides, Sav, you should see Coutinho, Firmino, Lallana,\n9:10 Comment: all their quick feet and training must be sensational to watch.\n9:16 Comment: Here's Lovren, they still talk about the goal he scored here very late on against Borussia Dortmund.\n9:24 Comment: Now Firmino, lovely turn again.\n9:29 Comment: Every trick in the book from Liverpool so far, and West Brom finding it so hard to cope with.\n9:35 Comment: Yes, brilliant from Firmino, the drag back on one foot, then the other.\n9:39 Comment: Dawson committed to the challenge.\n9:43 Comment: So McAuley committed to the challenge, coming out of his centre-half position.\n9:48 Comment: And that's the right play, Sav, isn't it? To do skills like that.\n9:52 Comment: Any kids watching, he's going down an alleyway where he's got nowhere to go,\n9:56 Comment: and if you've got a weapon up your sleeve, produce it then.\n9:59 Comment: Here's Lovren and Matip who have gone up for the free kick.\n10:4 Comment: Which is far too deep, it's about the first thing that's gone wrong for Liverpool today.\n10:9 Comment: Milner hitting the free kick too far.\n10:35 Comment: FANS ROAR\n10:47 Comment: Liverpool completely dominating the possession, even more so in the second half.\n10:57 Comment: Here's Brunt, Lovren's gone across there, they've got three in the box as well here.\n11:2 Comment: Chatley and Rondon, the plane's in there as well, it was Milner who got his foot to it.\n11:7 Comment: And then Coutinho quickly onto the loose ball, and now here's the pacey Mane.\n11:12 Comment: Milner and Firmino have made their inroads into the penalty area,\n11:16 Comment: as has Coutinho, and then Firmino!\n11:19 Comment: And Foster did well.\n11:21 Comment: Incisive passing and the speed of attack again from Liverpool.\n11:24 Comment: Brilliant, just thought that could he have lifted it over Foster there, Firmino?\n11:29 Comment: He was outquipped, Foster.\n11:33 Comment: Henderson's been caught there.\n11:38 Comment: The yellow card shown to James McLean, and Liverpool have got a free kick in a dangerous position.\n11:44 Comment: So incisive, like you said, Fletch knows.\n11:48 Comment: Great burst of pace from Mane down this right-hand side,\n11:51 Comment: but just look at Coutinho, unmarked.\n11:55 Comment: And then Firmino just wanders into an area,\n11:58 Comment: just think here, could he have lifted it with Foster rushing?\n12:1 Comment: That was a great block from McAuley, actually.\n12:7 Comment: It shows you also Liverpool have got that counter up their sleeve as well,\n12:11 Comment: they've got quick men in their team, not only with the build-up and the short passes,\n12:16 Comment: but that counter-attack was sensational, wasn't it?\n12:19 Comment: Philip Coutinho over the free kick.\n12:22 Comment: And he goes towards...\n12:24 Comment: And that's a brilliant save by Foster!\n12:26 Comment: And then the acrobatic effort by Firmino.\n12:32 Comment: Lovren, I think he wasn't good, he said to it, Matip was in there too,\n12:35 Comment: they were queuing up for Liverpool.\n12:38 Comment: That's a great ball in from Coutinho to a great area,\n12:41 Comment: what a save from Foster, seen it all the way.\n12:46 Comment: Great header.\n12:49 Comment: And then Firmino with acrobatics, but just see there,\n12:52 Comment: tries to glance into that far corner.\n12:54 Comment: Foster, who was great against Spurs last weekend, produces a wonderful save.\n13:8 Comment: Continues a run under Jurgen Klopp,\n13:11 Comment: but is it only Manchester United have stopped Liverpool scoring in the Premier League\n13:16 Comment: since he's been the manager? It's the 19th game today.\n13:20 Comment: Only a couple of matches against Manchester United have they failed to find the net.\n13:24 Comment: It's a different problem for West Brom.\n13:27 Comment: In their last 18 league matches they've only scored more than one goal in a game once,\n13:32 Comment: that was the 4-2 win against West Ham last month.\n13:37 Comment: They've tended to rely on Rondon and Chadley for the goals,\n13:40 Comment: and neither of them have really had any kind of opportunities today.\n13:44 Comment: Chadley was there defensively on the halfway line,\n13:47 Comment: but Liverpool still getting out here to Firmino.\n13:50 Comment: Now Lallana, and Firmino's on the run again,\n13:53 Comment: and he's just trying to shove Ney on the side,\n13:55 Comment: Foster slid across, Liverpool are going to get the corner.\n13:59 Comment: They just don't give you a minute at the back, do they?\n14:2 Comment: That was very good defending from Ney, when the ball was slipped through.\n14:8 Comment: Just in quite the pace there, Ney got his right foot to the ball,\n14:12 Comment: and Foster couldn't keep it in.\n14:43 Comment: Still Nasser Chadley.\n14:45 Comment: Milner was there for Liverpool, he just took him from the left-back position.\n14:50 Comment: And on the counter-attack, Firmino to Chan.\n14:54 Comment: Now Milner.\n14:58 Comment: Just wanted a better ball from Rondon there, you know,\n15:2 Comment: he wants it in front of him, Chadley was just a bit too slow,\n15:5 Comment: he had to check Chadley.\n15:8 Comment: And then six players for Liverpool got back.\n15:12 Comment: Ney! Ney! Ney!\n15:16 Comment: That was Clyde, good challenge by McLean.\n15:20 Comment: We always associated the speed of attack at Borussia Dortmund\n15:24 Comment: with the Jurgen Klopp side, didn't we?\n15:26 Comment: But they had that ability that Robbie's just talked about,\n15:28 Comment: to get bodies around the ball and work so hard as well,\n15:31 Comment: and cover so much ground, which we're seeing from Liverpool in abundance this season.\n15:35 Comment: It's the speed they do it in, when they played that 1-2 to get in behind West Brom there,\n15:39 Comment: it was the speed that it was done at.\n15:41 Comment: Sometimes it's impossible, it was good defending from Ney in the end,\n15:44 Comment: but it's the pace, it's slow, slow, and then it goes bang really quick.\n15:49 Comment: Difficult to defend.\n15:54 Comment: There's Clyde.\n15:59 Comment: Squeezes one into the line, another step over Firmino,\n16:2 Comment: Osana Teo Coutinho, to the forward instead for Emre Can.\n16:6 Comment: He can't keep it down.\n16:9 Comment: I think Coutinho might have liked to have walked onto that without the Lallana touch.\n16:15 Comment: Yeah, I think he was just trying to set it for me.\n16:17 Comment: There's the first set from Can, which is perfect actually,\n16:20 Comment: out of his feet, but he just couldn't get quite round it.\n16:24 Comment: Klopp there, kicking every ball.\n16:27 Comment: This is the pass from Rondon, just look, he wants it in front of him there,\n16:30 Comment: you know, it's a lazy pass.\n16:33 Comment: That's finding my man, hits it in front so he can get onto it\n16:36 Comment: and drive at this Liverpool defence.\n16:40 Comment: And then Chadli gets snuffed out by six Liverpool players.\n16:47 Comment: There's Chadli.\n16:50 Comment: Firmino is there for Liverpool and Mane starts to make a run,\n16:53 Comment: Coutinho's already on the move on the other side.\n16:56 Comment: There's Savio Mane.\n16:59 Comment: Lallana.\n17:1 Comment: Mion was there.\n17:4 Comment: Firmino, Klein, now Henderson.\n17:11 Comment: Lallana.\n17:13 Comment: Nathaniel Klein.\n17:19 Comment: Foul by Mion on Klein, free kick to Liverpool,\n17:22 Comment: they were quite happy just to pop the ball around and wait for the opening to arrive.\n17:28 Comment: Silly tackle from Mion, he's never going to win the ball there.\n17:34 Comment: Good play from Tom Forkser down the corner.\n17:52 Comment: Henderson with the latest Liverpool free kick.\n17:57 Comment: Coutinho.\n17:58 Comment: There's Lovren, and now Lallana, and in towards Matip,\n18:2 Comment: and away by Mion for West Brom.\n18:8 Comment: Matip towards Firmino, Mion there again.\n18:12 Comment: And Olsen away.\n18:16 Comment: West Brom are going to make another change, their final one,\n18:18 Comment: Hal Robson-Kanu is stripped and ready for them.\n18:24 Comment: Jurgen Klopp has sent Marengo to the back of the net,\n18:27 Comment: Klopp has sent Marengo, Wijnaldum and Origi to warm up as well.\n18:35 Comment: There's Hal Robson-Kanu, who was such a hero for Wales in the summer\n18:39 Comment: of the European Championships, hasn't had many opportunities there Robbie so far at West Brom.\n18:44 Comment: What a fantastic view he has, especially that goal against Belgium,\n18:48 Comment: when he sent world-class players the wrong way.\n18:52 Comment: I wonder why he hasn't had a lot of games to West Brom,\n18:57 Comment: it took him a long time to sign for a football club,\n19:0 Comment: and he eventually chose West Brom, but his opportunities have been very limited.\n19:5 Comment: Saying that, his record in the Championship of Redmond was not very good at all\n19:9 Comment: in terms of goals per game, it was the Euros which tempted West Brom to go for him.\n19:14 Comment: McLean didn't seem happy to come off, but Robson-Kanu is on,\n19:18 Comment: and it's fourth appearance off the bench for West Brom this season.\n19:24 Comment: Still only 2-0 down, despite Liverpool's dominance,\n19:27 Comment: if they could score the next goal in the game it might make for an interesting finish,\n19:30 Comment: but they've been hanging on in the main for large parts of this second half.\n19:36 Comment: Here's the left-back Alan Neal,\n19:38 Comment: Sadio Mane's challenge, and Liverpool get the throw.\n19:42 Comment: Again it's a work there from Mane,\n19:45 Comment: Liverpool's right-hand side gets back,\n19:48 Comment: makes a tackle, wins the throw in first aid.\n19:51 Comment: That's Fletcher, who's behind Robson-Kanu,\n19:54 Comment: Milner can sweep it away, what a goal that is.\n19:57 Comment: Into Philly, Coutinho, who's in here.\n20:0 Comment: Coutinho waits, Emre Can arrives!\n20:3 Comment: What a block by Olsen, brilliant defending by Jonas Olsen.\n20:8 Comment: Looks as certain to be 3-0 Liverpool.\n20:12 Comment: Brilliant play from Olsen there, what a block.\n20:17 Comment: But it was Coutinho who just...\n20:20 Comment: Perfect pass to Can.\n20:23 Comment: Tees up Milner this time.\n20:27 Comment: Milner again, Foster down sharply.\n20:32 Comment: Again it was Mione's ball to Coutinho, what a fantastic 70-yard ball.\n20:36 Comment: And a bit of defending.\n20:38 Comment: Look at this, he's had a little look, a glance, it's a wonderful ball,\n20:42 Comment: weighted to perfection.\n20:44 Comment: Coutinho, you think he's going to...\n20:46 Comment: It comes back inside again, like it did first half of the goal.\n20:49 Comment: Sets up Can, but fabulous defending there.\n20:52 Comment: Olsen comes from nowhere, he's covered the area.\n20:56 Comment: Got the block in, but a great break from Liverpool again.\n20:59 Comment: Just scores a short one, Glenn, the fluidity in the side.\n21:3 Comment: Can sits there with Henderson, but as you say, if Henderson sits,\n21:7 Comment: Can can get forward and support.\n21:14 Comment: I think this freedom that they've got, if they can produce this\n21:17 Comment: against the Cities and the Chelseas and the Arsenals,\n21:21 Comment: that's their next challenge.\n21:22 Comment: I've seen them play this season in spells and against lesser teams,\n21:26 Comment: if you like, down the bottom half of the league, they can do this.\n21:33 Comment: Firmino, and then Coutinho.\n21:35 Comment: Now Emre Can, going to get another chance to shoot here.\n21:39 Comment: You talk about Manchester City again, they did it twice to them\n21:42 Comment: last season, didn't they, in the league?\n21:44 Comment: First time early in Klopp's reign at the Etihad,\n21:48 Comment: and then here towards the end of the season after the League Cup final.\n21:53 Comment: I think he's expecting more than the two goals they've got at the moment,\n21:56 Comment: although the glasses remain intact, which is always a blessing\n22:0 Comment: with JÃ¼rgen Klopp, isn't it?\n22:2 Comment: I think he's frustrated because Can just had a chance before,\n22:6 Comment: and the one before he's hit one over the bar,\n22:9 Comment: and then the third time now it's shown a bit of frustration,\n22:12 Comment: but to be fair, Can has been out quite a long time.\n22:15 Comment: He's got to get his shooting boots on.\n22:19 Comment: Morrison out for Dawson, now Robson-Kanu,\n22:22 Comment: trying to feed it through there towards Morrison,\n22:24 Comment: Dawson gets another chance, Matip away, now Fletcher.\n22:31 Comment: Olsen to Brunt.\n22:34 Comment: Shadley wanted it, instead it's away by Matip for Liverpool.\n22:53 Comment: Craig Dawson.\n23:1 Comment: Now Fletcher.\n23:4 Comment: Lifts one up towards Salomon Rondon,\n23:7 Comment: and Dejan Lovren got the last touch,\n23:9 Comment: it's going to be a corner to West Brom,\n23:11 Comment: and a cheer from the corner from their supporters\n23:14 Comment: who have celebrated that, Robbie, like a goal.\n23:17 Comment: Yeah, it was Lovren with a flick,\n23:19 Comment: it was a run from Rondon,\n23:21 Comment: the West Brom fans are singing now, they've got a corner.\n23:27 Comment: Some big targets to find here for West Brom,\n23:30 Comment: and they've all gone to crowd around Loris Karius,\n23:35 Comment: Shadley, Olsen, McCauley,\n23:38 Comment: Dawson, they were all in there, weren't they?\n23:40 Comment: It wasn't comfortable at all, Liverpool's goalkeeper.\n23:43 Comment: It's Shadley and McCauley, of course they can stand there,\n23:46 Comment: there's no reason why they can't.\n23:57 Comment: See whether Brunt can find the quality from that side with his left foot.\n24:1 Comment: Plenty of whip on the corner, it's away by Firmino,\n24:4 Comment: here's Shadley, and it's the best chance West Brom have had.\n24:10 Comment: It was interesting because when they were jostling,\n24:12 Comment: Shadley was the one right on the keeper,\n24:14 Comment: and he just pulled off into that space,\n24:16 Comment: and very unfortunately he couldn't get a clear kick,\n24:19 Comment: you just watch him back away from all the players,\n24:22 Comment: all the West Brom players, everyone in that six-yard box,\n24:25 Comment: he's creating his own space.\n24:27 Comment: Just couldn't quite keep it down, could he?\n24:29 Comment: The man in form for West Brom, four goals in his last four matches,\n24:32 Comment: the first attempt on goal in the match for West Brom\n24:35 Comment: compared to 16 from Liverpool.\n24:56 Comment: I think what this says is,\n24:59 Comment: I think Liverpool are a better team without Sturridge,\n25:3 Comment: when Sturridge plays, he plays up against the centre-halves\n25:7 Comment: and they stay deep, when you play with a forced number,\n25:10 Comment: if Firmino drops into the number 10 position,\n25:13 Comment: one of the centre-halves goes with him,\n25:15 Comment: that allows a space for Mane or Coutinho to run into.\n25:19 Comment: Sturridge has undoubted qualities,\n25:22 Comment: as you said, Darren, top scorer last season,\n25:25 Comment: but the way Liverpool play when Sturridge plays\n25:28 Comment: is a different dynamic for this team.\n25:33 Comment: It's an example of the options available this season to Jurgen Klopp,\n25:37 Comment: when you think of Divock Origi as well as a different type of forward player,\n25:42 Comment: Wijnaldum, who's been starting for Liverpool, is on the bench today.\n25:47 Comment: There's Lallana, and now Mane.\n25:53 Comment: FANS CHANT\n26:6 Comment: Lovren, Milner's way ahead of him, up the touchline.\n26:11 Comment: Here's Clyde, and now Henderson.\n26:15 Comment: Space for Mane, Henderson wants it back and gets it back,\n26:19 Comment: and the cross was blocked by Chadley.\n26:22 Comment: That's a great example of the movement,\n26:24 Comment: again Henderson plays the ball wide,\n26:26 Comment: gets a little blind run in behind the full-back,\n26:29 Comment: searching, and there's Chan in the centre of the pitch,\n26:33 Comment: just playing in the holding role,\n26:34 Comment: so the balance is always good with Liverpool when they're attacking.\n26:37 Comment: FANS SHOUT\n27:7 Comment: He's got to keep it.\n27:10 Comment: Now Olsen.\n27:15 Comment: Morrison to Fletcher, and out towards Brunt.\n27:22 Comment: Morrison gives chase, and Matip gets across,\n27:25 Comment: Brunt gets his head to that one.\n27:27 Comment: It's going to be a West Brom throw,\n27:29 Comment: it just took a nick off Nathaniel Kline according to Neil Swarbrick.\n27:38 Comment: FANS SHOUT\n27:52 Comment: That's Olsen, it's an awkward ball for the centre-back,\n27:55 Comment: he was running towards Neill when it bounced up to him.\n27:57 Comment: Fletcher, what a throwing that is,\n27:59 Comment: the most awkward from him,\n28:1 Comment: it's the most neglected thing in football throw-ins I feel.\n28:4 Comment: Throw it to him on the volley,\n28:5 Comment: so it's easy for him to pop it back or play wherever he wants to play.\n28:9 Comment: We're interested to see it full-time when Tony Pulas speaks to Des Kelly,\n28:12 Comment: what his assessment of his own side is,\n28:14 Comment: but also what he thinks of this Liverpool team,\n28:16 Comment: because he's usually pretty frank and honest, isn't he,\n28:18 Comment: when he gets asked questions post-match, the West Brom manager.\n28:22 Comment: It's been a bit of a chastening experience.\n28:26 Comment: Despite the fact it's only 2-0 for his side today,\n28:28 Comment: they found it hard to cope with Liverpool.\n28:31 Comment: On by Mane to Firmino,\n28:33 Comment: McCauley was there, Fletcher beat Chan to it.\n28:36 Comment: Here's Morrison.\n28:38 Comment: I get the sense there might be a bit of confidence growing in West Brom.\n28:41 Comment: It's been a full here for Rondon, Matip was there,\n28:43 Comment: now Robson, Kanu...\n28:47 Comment: And eventually Liverpool get bodies around the ball,\n28:49 Comment: but Morrison can hit one and guided it off target.\n28:53 Comment: A couple of chances, though, for Tony Pulas's side, Glenn,\n28:56 Comment: in the last couple of minutes.\n28:57 Comment: Yeah, well, the substitutes have come on and done well,\n28:59 Comment: they're the two subs they're working now.\n29:1 Comment: Robson, Kanu there, just pokes the ball off,\n29:3 Comment: but it's getting bodies forward.\n29:5 Comment: They haven't had enough composed possession\n29:7 Comment: to get enough people to take the risk to get forward.\n29:10 Comment: It's been the ball up there to one person isolated,\n29:13 Comment: and it's nine times out of ten, it's come straight back at them.\n29:16 Comment: And there they've got people forward.\n29:25 Comment: Free kick given to Liverpool.\n29:28 Comment: I don't think we've got some big Premier League matches on the way.\n29:31 Comment: You'll see Liverpool again next Saturday,\n29:33 Comment: they're at Selhurst Park against Crystal Palace\n29:35 Comment: from five o'clock on BT Sport 1HD, 4K UHD.\n29:39 Comment: And a doubleheader, Chelsea Everton on the 5th of November,\n29:42 Comment: that's a five o'clock start.\n29:44 Comment: And an early start on the Sunday for the North London derby,\n29:47 Comment: Arsenal versus Tottenham on Sunday, 6th November, 11.15pm.\n29:51 Comment: BT Sport 1HD, 4K UHD, as always.\n29:56 Comment: Liverpool 2-0 West Bromwich Albion,\n29:58 Comment: with 15 minutes of this match to go.\n30:9 Comment: Dawson, then forward by Robson-Kanu towards Rondon.\n30:14 Comment: Chan wasn't aware that he was behind him.\n30:21 Comment: Now Brunt.\n30:26 Comment: Look at that, without the ball, Liverpool.\n30:31 Comment: Rondon was sprinting across the field,\n30:35 Comment: but Liverpool got men back,\n30:37 Comment: they desired to win the ball back very quickly.\n30:39 Comment: Morrison wanted back, Rondon shot-charged out by Chan.\n30:48 Comment: Neon was determined with Firmino,\n30:51 Comment: and that determination went inside the throwing.\n30:55 Comment: And the Liverpool fans in the front of that stand didn't agree with it.\n31:1 Comment: Here's Chadlit.\n31:3 Comment: Fletcher.\n31:7 Comment: In towards Robson-Kanu, that'll be a Liverpool ball.\n31:12 Comment: It's a bit of a response, hasn't it, Glenn, in the last ten minutes or so?\n31:15 Comment: Tony Pulas.\n31:17 Comment: Yeah, when you send your substitutes on,\n31:19 Comment: you ask them to make a little bit of a change, make a difference.\n31:22 Comment: You know, the team haven't been playing well,\n31:24 Comment: so they've got a bit of a freewheel,\n31:26 Comment: they go on and they think,\n31:27 Comment: oh, I can only improve this performance,\n31:29 Comment: and that's what's happened.\n31:30 Comment: But it's morsels, isn't it?\n31:31 Comment: They're not in a real sort of composed way of playing.\n31:34 Comment: It's a bit of a response, isn't it, Glenn, in the last ten minutes or so?\n31:37 Comment: Tony Pulas.\n31:38 Comment: Yeah, when you send your substitutes on,\n31:40 Comment: you ask them to make a little bit of a change,\n31:42 Comment: make a difference,\n31:43 Comment: and that's what's happened.\n31:44 Comment: But it's morsels, isn't it, Glenn, in the last ten minutes or so?\n31:47 Comment: Tony Pulas.\n31:49 Comment: Here's Dawson, just catches Coutinho in the side of the head.\n31:54 Comment: Referee gives a free kick.\n31:57 Comment: John W. Henry,\n31:59 Comment: who can look on at the moment with his side Krivich\n32:1 Comment: nearly top of the Premier League table,\n32:3 Comment: if they can hang on to this win today.\n32:6 Comment: The Boston Red Sox, his baseball team,\n32:8 Comment: not involved in the playoffs in the States,\n32:10 Comment: so he can come to Merseyside and watch the game.\n32:14 Comment: Jurgen Klopp's going to make his first change as well.\n32:16 Comment: Jorginho Wijnaldum is ready to come on.\n32:22 Comment: You would think he'd be looking to protect Lallana,\n32:25 Comment: who's been out.\n32:26 Comment: Been very impressive today, Lallana again,\n32:28 Comment: but obviously coming back, though, he's been out injured.\n32:32 Comment: You would have thought it would be in his mind\n32:34 Comment: to just protect him a little bit.\n32:36 Comment: Here's John Matip, and now Lallana.\n32:59 Comment: Sadio Mane, Jordan Henderson.\n33:1 Comment: Great player from Liverpool, you know,\n33:3 Comment: they involve a keeper, they pass it out, they build it,\n33:6 Comment: do it at the right time, the right area.\n33:9 Comment: I think you've seen teams recently, Danny,\n33:11 Comment: just choose their option when they're under pressure,\n33:14 Comment: instead of smashing it long, they try and play it.\n33:17 Comment: That was the right time to play there.\n33:20 Comment: They've got the corner,\n33:21 Comment: which was won for them by Roberto Firmino.\n33:24 Comment: James Milner's gone out there, Jurgen Klopp there\n33:26 Comment: will make the change, and he was spot on.\n33:28 Comment: Glenn, it is Adam Lallana who's coming off,\n33:31 Comment: and the Liverpool supporters inside Anfield\n33:35 Comment: rise to applaud him off, they've been impressed by him again today.\n33:38 Comment: He's been very impressive, hasn't he?\n33:40 Comment: He's just feeling a bit fatigued now,\n33:43 Comment: the next few games coming up for Liverpool,\n33:45 Comment: he's right that he's in there.\n33:47 Comment: He creates so much for them, and as I've said before,\n33:50 Comment: he's starting to score some goals now, looking dangerous,\n33:52 Comment: but a terrific young player.\n33:55 Comment: So, Jorginho Wijnaldum comes on,\n33:57 Comment: who was injured in his hip during the internationals.\n34:1 Comment: Adam Lallana not able to mark his 100th appearance for Liverpool with a goal.\n34:5 Comment: Milner's corner away by McCauley.\n34:11 Comment: Henderson misjudges it, and the break's on again here for West Brom,\n34:14 Comment: led by Rondon, now Brunt.\n34:20 Comment: Morrison just had it nicked away from him by Chan.\n34:22 Comment: Nasser Chadli.\n34:25 Comment: Now Fletcher.\n34:26 Comment: But you see in there, with the ball went to Morrison,\n34:28 Comment: his first thought was going to do a cross-turn and go backwards.\n34:30 Comment: It got nicked off him.\n34:32 Comment: One West Brom counter-attack, they don't go with any real purpose.\n34:38 Comment: It's a foul by Milner on Robson-Kahne,\n34:40 Comment: who's going to bring West Brom a set-piece\n34:42 Comment: in an area where they can put the ball into the Liverpool box.\n34:50 Comment: Robson-Kahne's on the right-hand side,\n34:52 Comment: another little foul.\n34:55 Comment: And look at Olsen there on Matip.\n34:57 Comment: His arms are all round him.\n35:1 Comment: At the start of the season, we've seen penalties given for those kind of things.\n35:4 Comment: It seems to have fizzled out now.\n35:5 Comment: I can't remember the last time we've seen one given for holding\n35:7 Comment: or stuff like that.\n35:9 Comment: It was brought in, and now it seems to have fizzled out.\n35:13 Comment: Chris Brunt's left foot with the free-kick.\n35:15 Comment: Karius didn't get there.\n35:17 Comment: Gareth McCauley did.\n35:19 Comment: And that's going to be a corner.\n35:21 Comment: And he almost managed to squeeze that in there.\n35:25 Comment: It was a decent ball in, wasn't it?\n35:26 Comment: It was floated, it was coming in,\n35:28 Comment: and the goalkeeper really gets himself all over the place there.\n35:31 Comment: Karius comes for it.\n35:33 Comment: Look, he's mistimed it completely,\n35:35 Comment: and they get a little bit good fortune there.\n35:37 Comment: Had a moment like that, didn't he, against Manchester United on Monday,\n35:40 Comment: where he mistimed his run towards the cross.\n35:44 Comment: Gives Brunt another option, this time from the other side.\n35:47 Comment: This will be an outswinger.\n35:50 Comment: It's dangerous, it's now clear and it's in.\n35:52 Comment: And West Brom, it's Helbing against the run of play,\n35:55 Comment: and they've got themselves back in the match through Gareth McCauley.\n36:7 Comment: I think the whole stadium's stunned, I think even is.\n36:10 Comment: They've had a shot on target.\n36:13 Comment: You know, they're all marked up.\n36:15 Comment: They've got bodies round, it's come off his shoulder.\n36:18 Comment: He's just smashed it in.\n36:21 Comment: Past Karius, a bit of fortune with the bounce off his shoulder,\n36:24 Comment: but never mind that, they're back in this game.\n36:28 Comment: Can they get an equaliser, Darren?\n36:30 Comment: Well, for me, Rob, they shouldn't have had the chance at the second corner.\n36:33 Comment: I think if the keeper doesn't come, he collects that header on the back post quite easily.\n36:38 Comment: They've given them another chance to put a set play in,\n36:41 Comment: and how many times has West Brom done that?\n36:43 Comment: Scored from set plays.\n36:44 Comment: It's Gareth McCauley's third goal of the season, it's the second time he's scored here.\n36:47 Comment: He got one in February 2013, the last time West Brom won here.\n36:52 Comment: They've paid the penalty at the moment, Liverpool, for not killing off West Brom.\n36:56 Comment: They've had a lot of chances second half to get a third goal in real daylight,\n36:59 Comment: but we did say, didn't we, the next goal in the match would be a key one,\n37:4 Comment: and now West Brom will feel that they've got the chance to maybe take something from this one.\n37:9 Comment: In the meantime, though, here's Mane, in towards Firmino,\n37:12 Comment: and straight at Foster.\n37:17 Comment: Yeah, good play once again from Mane.\n37:20 Comment: Firmino just made little darts at Neopost,\n37:22 Comment: he had to generate all the power himself to try and get that ball past Foster.\n37:29 Comment: And hopefully that'll be in for the cracking in the last eight to nine minutes.\n37:36 Comment: Away by Matip.\n37:37 Comment: Matip.\n37:48 Comment: Morrison battling for it, Fletcher's in there.\n37:51 Comment: West Brom just starting to win one or two second balls.\n37:55 Comment: Morrison.\n37:57 Comment: Alan Neom.\n38:0 Comment: Now Olsen.\n38:2

Comment: McCauley tracking it.\n38:21 Comment: Here's Wijnaldum, and now Firmino!\n38:24 Comment: Good save by Foster, it's a save that keeps West Brom in the game.\n38:28 Comment: Yeah, the awareness from Wijnaldum there, just to see Firmino,\n38:32 Comment: he let the ball run across him, little side pass,\n38:35 Comment: now Firmino trying to go across Foster,\n38:38 Comment: keeper stood up, good save.\n38:42 Comment: James Morrison.\n38:46 Comment: Neom.\n39:0 Comment: Neom's ball in towards Rondon, away by Matip,\n39:2 Comment: here's Watson-Karno, and now Chadley.\n39:4 Comment: Chadley's gonna try one, couldn't keep it down,\n39:8 Comment: but it's another half chance for West Bromwich Albion.\n39:10 Comment: Yeah, it's an interesting period of the game here,\n39:12 Comment: and this is what Liverpool for me have,\n39:14 Comment: you see Chadley here just getting a touch right for the second one,\n39:17 Comment: not so good, couldn't get over it.\n39:19 Comment: But this is a moment in a game, and against better teams,\n39:22 Comment: they're gonna be tested even more, this is the chance.\n39:25 Comment: He tries to go back across Foster, great save again from Foster.\n39:28 Comment: Really, just a little bit wide, he has to adjust.\n39:31 Comment: For me overall in this game, this is a key moment for Liverpool,\n39:34 Comment: does Klopp allow them to keep playing this open football?\n39:37 Comment: Is West Bromwich just feeling they've got a little scent of a chance here?\n39:41 Comment: Here's Mane, scent of a chance for him, Firmino couldn't gather it,\n39:44 Comment: and for once there was nobody behind him, supporting in red.\n39:48 Comment: I think they realise, you know, what, with five or six minutes left,\n39:51 Comment: two centre-back will sit there, no need to go forward.\n39:56 Comment: Here's Coutinho.\n39:58 Comment: And still Coutinho, and straight to Ben Foster.\n40:7 Comment: Now we've got some Champions League matches

across, and he's got just enough speed to get there at the same time as Clyde,\n41:12 Comment: although they've kept it alive.\n41:15 Comment: Guarnaldi.\n41:17 Comment: Towards Firmino.\n41:21 Comment: Now Coutinho.\n41:23 Comment: Emre Can, it's end-to-end stuff here at Anfield.\n41:28 Comment: Henderson.\n41:31 Comment: Nathaniel Clyde.\n41:32 Comment: Henderson, by.\n41:56 Comment: Olsen rises, a little bit of a nudge in there too.\n41:59 Comment: Firmino's battling hard for it, flicks it on towards Mane.\n42:3 Comment: I think Gareth Mccauley did just about enough in the back there for West Brom, didn't he, Robbie?\n42:7 Comment: Yeah, great defending Mccauley,\n42:9 Comment: you know, intelligent flick from Firmino,\n42:12 Comment: he showed great desire to win the ball there.\n42:15 Comment: You know, then Mccauley got his arm across.\n42:21 Comment: Mane, great defending.\n42:22 Comment: Well, good club's going to make another change,\n42:24 Comment: he's going to take off Philippe Coutinho and send on Lucas Leiva,\n42:29 Comment: attacking midfielder to one who's going to sit in the middle of the bar, Robbie,\n42:32 Comment: and try and help them see the game out.\n42:36 Comment: Yeah, I think that's what Morrison got booked for,\n42:38 Comment: that and earlier on, little shirt pull on Coutinho,\n42:42 Comment: I think Coutinho's been outstanding

Comment: so influential for this Liverpool side,\n42:56 Comment: great afternoon so far, well, great afternoon for Coutinho.\n43:2 Comment: Sure it's not a change that Klopp and Vityaz are having to make,\n43:5 Comment: when it was 2-0 and Liverpool were flying forward,\n43:7 Comment: but he's got the extra man in midfield now just to try and stabilise things.\n43:11 Comment: Darren, it's the right thing at the right time,\n43:13 Comment: he can just smell that West Brom are looking to throw bodies forward\n43:17 Comment: and get set plays and there's a chance of them conceding.\n43:21 Comment: There's a yellow card in there for descent as well for Jordan Henderson,\n43:24 Comment: so that Claudio Jakob, he's going to serve a suspension as well,\n43:27 Comment: his fifth booking of

corner, he's trying to play football\n43:51 Comment: and there's another break on for West Brom.\n43:53 Comment: That's what they've got to learn from me,\n43:55 Comment: it's game management, right

    "summary": "It was a tense and vibrant atmosphere at Anfield as Liverpool faced off against West Bromwich Albion, a match that ended with Liverpool securing a hard-fought 2-1 victory. The encounter was crucial for Liverpool, who were looking to capitalize on draws earlier in the day by rivals Arsenal and Tottenham Hotspur, knowing that a victory here would place them at the top of the Premier League table. This narrative describes the thorough and engaging play that unfolded over the course of the game.\n\n### First Half\n\nAs the match began, Liverpool fans were in a palpable attacking mood, a stark contrast to their previous match against Manchester United, which ended in a goalless draw. The Reds had set a formidable record under JÃ¼rgen Klopp, only failing to score twice in 18 games at Anfield. West Brom's tactical approach was defensively minded, as expected from Tony Pulis's sides. However, the question was whether Liverpool could break down their rigid structure and get the goals they needed.\n\nLiverpool's recent unbeaten streak saw them avoiding defeat in eight games since a loss to Burnley. The Reds hadnât lost at home since January, their draw against Manchester United marking their first clean sheet of the season. Their opponents, West Brom, had been notorious for drawing games, with their last three meetings against Liverpool all ending in draws.\n\nFrom the outset, Liverpool took control of the game. Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino, and Philippe Coutinho were quick to rotate positions, making it difficult for West Bromâs defense to pin them down. The early part of the game saw both teams sizing each other up. Salomon Rondon tried to exploit a brief mistake from Joel Matip but was quickly neutralized.\n\nIn the early minutes, James Milner, now established as a reliable left-back, facilitated several attacking moves. His connection with Emre Can and other midfielders ensured Liverpool kept the ball rolling within West Bromâs half. However, despite the fluidity in their attack, Liverpool were initially met with robust defensive efforts from Craig Dawson and his teammates.\n\nLiverpool continued to persist, driving through their attacking wingers and number ten trio of Firmino, Mane, and Coutinho. An early penalty appeal for Liverpool was denied when Mane clashed with West Bromâs full-back Allan Nyom. Replays confirmed the decision, as Mane was seen to have initiated the contact. Despite being denied, Liverpool's movement and passing were crisp, often leaving the West Brom defenders stretched and scrambling.\n\nAs the first half wore on, Liverpool's persistence paid off. After 20 minutes of constant pressing and moving the ball around the West Brom's half, a brilliant team goal broke the deadlock. It all started with Coutinho, who brilliantly dummied the ball to let it pass through to Firmino. Firmino, in turn, provided an exquisite cross that Mane volleyed superbly with his side-foot, giving West Bromâs goalkeeper Ben Foster no chance. This goal epitomized the kind of attacking football Jurgen Klopp had instilled in his team.\n\nWest Brom tried to respond but found it difficult to mount any significant attack as Liverpool's high pressing game kept reclaiming possession. On a rare occasion that West Brom did break forward through Nacer Chadli, their attempts were foiled by quick defensive interventions from Liverpool.\n\nCoutinho continued to shine as Liverpoolâs creative spark. His movement and vision unlocked West Bromâs defense repeatedly. This culminated in a second goal for Liverpool in the 35th minute. Coutinho seized on a mis-hit clearance, maneuvered cleverly inside the box, and struck a firm shot past Foster at his near post. The skill involved in the buildup, the precise finishing, and the ability to exploit a slight defensive lapse highlighted the class Coutinho brought to Liverpoolâs attack.\n\n### Second Half\n\nThe second half saw some tactical changes from Tony Pulis as he introduced Chris Brunt for Claudio Yacob, pushing Darren Fletcher to play alongside the experienced Irishman in midfield. However, the tactical alteration saw little success initially, as Liverpool continued where they left off in the first half.\n\nLiverpool continued to dominate possession, comfortably moving the ball with Henderson and Lallana helping to maintain the tempo. Henderson was key in winning back possession and driving the team forward. Firmino, although positioned as a false nine, often dropped deep to assist in buildup play, allowing Mane and Coutinho to exploit spaces left by West Bromâs shifting defense.\n\nJames Milner, who had an outstanding first half, continued to bomb forward from left-back, putting in dangerous crosses. Firmino managed to create a brilliant chance early in the second half, turning his marker inside out, but the final shot was blocked by Foster. The constant pressure from Liverpool made it an arduous task for West Brom to retain possession for any substantial amount of time.\n\nAfter the hour mark, West Brom made another change, bringing on James Morrison for Matt Phillips. This substitution added a bit more energy to West Brom's midfield, but it did little to stem the tide brought by Liverpool's midfield maestros. The likes of Henderson, Coutinho, and Firmino continued to orchestrate play, ensuring Liverpool stayed on the front foot.\n\nNevertheless, Liverpool's dominance in possession did not translate into more goals, largely due to last-ditch defending from West Brom defenders like Jonas Olsen and Gareth McAuley, and brilliant saves by Foster. One such save came off a close-range shot from Firmino after a lovely build-up play involving Mane and Coutinho.\n\nTowards the last quarter of the game, Jurgen Klopp started to bring in fresh legs with the introduction of Jorginho Wijnaldum, replacing an exhausted Adam Lallana. This move pointed towards Klopp's intent to maintain control in the midfield. However, with Liverpool unable to score a third, West Brom sensed an opportunity.\n\nThe moment of vulnerability for Liverpool came in the 81st minute. Following a corner, Gareth McCauley managed to get on the end of a scrambled ball inside the box and slotted it home past a flustered Karius. This unexpected goal injected some much-needed confidence into the West Brom ranks. Liverpool's scintillating play was suddenly overshadowed by a new sense of urgency to defend their slim lead.\n\nWest Brom, reinvigorated by McCauleyâs goal, pressed hard in the final minutes. The Liverpool defense, marshaled by Matip and Lovren, showed resilience in clearing multiple crosses and set-pieces pumped into the box. Klopp introduced Lucas Leiva and Divock Origi in the dying minutes to further bolster the backline and disrupt West Bromâs rhythm.\n\nDespite West Bromâs valiant efforts towards the end, Liverpool held firm, ensuring that they ended the match 2-1 victors. This win propelled Liverpool temporarily to the top of the table, a fitting reward for their attacking philosophy and tactical discipline exhibited in the match.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nLiverpool's 2-1 victory over West Bromwich Albion at Anfield showcased a team brimming with confidence, creativity, and tactical acumen. The first-half goals from Sadio Mane and Philippe Coutinho highlighted the attacking prowess that Liverpool had become known for under JÃ¼rgen Klopp. Solid defensive performances coupled with a fierce pressing game left little room for West Brom to maneuver, though they nearly capitalized late on due to Liverpool's failure to put the game beyond doubt sooner.\n\nThe game provided a fascinating narrative, one where Liverpool's attacking vibrancy was only matched by West Brom's resolve and tactical discipline. It was an encounter that reiterated Liverpoolâs title credentials while also highlighting areas needing improvement, particularly in terms of game management and converting dominance into more decisive leads."
