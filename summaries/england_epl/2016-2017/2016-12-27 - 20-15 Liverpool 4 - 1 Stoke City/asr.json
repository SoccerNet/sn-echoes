    "input": "\n    Liverpool 4 - 1 Stoke\n\nFirst Half:\n\n0:0 Comment: And Christmas football, at the start at least, comes with no excuses of fatigue.\n0:7 Comment: Liverpool haven't played for eight days, Stokes' last match was ten days ago.\n0:13 Comment: But of course it does get more hectic from now on over the next couple of weeks.\n0:23 Comment: Chris, early evening up here in the north-west.\n0:31 Comment: Daniel Cline.\n0:35 Comment: Interchange with Adam Lallana, Jordan Henderson taking over,\n0:40 Comment: and now Klavan, who's done well, started the first two Premier League games of the season,\n0:46 Comment: his first season here of course, and lost his place but has come back for the last two,\n0:51 Comment: and has fallen in well for the injured Matip.\n0:56 Comment: He's indeed beaten by Mane, Hrighly trying to take it on past Ryan Shaw,\n1:2 Comment: of course he came up with the answer.\n1:6 Comment: Great kick from Ligard.\n1:15 Comment: Liverpool will try and set the early agenda here.\n1:20 Comment: They have been sparkling to watch in the Premier League in that respect,\n1:25 Comment: but certainly up there as the top goal scorers, Hrighly's chipped in in recent games.\n1:33 Comment: Trying to find Wijnaldum.\n1:36 Comment: Good vision there from Hrighly, Wijnaldum had made a little bit of space\n1:40 Comment: as he ran towards the far post, just probably needed a little bit less on the pass.\n1:45 Comment: Just for the record, Stoke have never beaten Liverpool here in the top flight of English football.\n1:52 Comment: Three Anfield wins in the second tier, back in the 1950s,\n1:58 Comment: and Mark Hughes, an outstanding Premier League manager at different clubs,\n2:2 Comment: has never won here as a manager in the Premier League.\n2:5 Comment: He ruffled a few Liverpool feathers in his playing days.\n2:15 Comment: Stoke managed to scamper.\n2:20 Comment: You were correct, they're playing with the three at the back,\n2:22 Comment: Stoke are trying to keep the ball out wide.\n2:25 Comment: Hrighly, he's looking to get it and turn and bring the other lightning front players in with him.\n2:31 Comment: Difficult one for Stoke to try and adapt to this with the pace\n2:35 Comment: that this Liverpool team are doing things at.\n2:39 Comment: Tied up by Mignolet for Liverpool.\n2:42 Comment: Mountains in with the header.\n2:46 Comment: Purposeful work, typical work from Milner.\n2:51 Comment: Giff a bit slow to pick himself up, Joe Allen down.\n2:54 Comment: Back to Mike Oliver, the referee.\n2:57 Comment: Giff was slow in getting up, he was slow to get to that ball.\n3:1 Comment: I think Milner made it his and came from about five yards further.\n3:5 Comment: He's given it away.\n3:8 Comment: Liverpool sleeping forward.\n3:11 Comment: Mane.\n3:15 Comment: I think the referee just checking with the assistant,\n3:17 Comment: there was no touch off of Stoke in the middle.\n3:20 Comment: Waste of a free kick.\n3:22 Comment: Yeah, poor play.\n3:24 Comment: The ball makes its way in, I think he puts a really good cross in here.\n3:27 Comment: Hoping for a diving head or something, a little bit too far ahead of him.\n3:34 Comment: It wasn't a stoke.\n3:37 Comment: Mane, the hero of course of the derby.\n3:40 Comment: The Liverpool fans have had a good week or so\n3:45 Comment: to rip the blue side of Merseyside.\n3:50 Comment: Stoke in their lighter blue change strip here.\n3:54 Comment: Allen.\n3:57 Comment: We will try and support Walters and Crouch as the furthest forward\n4:1 Comment: in the derby.\n4:2 Comment: Clive across midfield in front of the back three.\n4:7 Comment: Peter Crouch did start the two Stoke games at the end of last season,\n4:14 Comment: or the first part of the year, January, when they won here\n4:18 Comment: but lost on penalties in the end, won the second leg,\n4:20 Comment: it went to a penalty shoot-out.\n4:21 Comment: Crouch actually wasted his penalty in that shoot-out.\n4:26 Comment: And they tried to do the same again in the league game,\n4:29 Comment: but it didn't work out.\n4:30 Comment: It was in April in Liverpool 1-4-1.\n4:34 Comment: There's something in those games that Marc Hughes has seen\n4:37 Comment: that makes him want to switch to this formation today.\n4:41 Comment: Here's Firmino.\n4:44 Comment: Origi.\n4:45 Comment: He had Firmino to end for in the middle,\n4:47 Comment: which is unusual for Liverpool, it's the corner of Martin Zindy.\n5:0 Comment: Crouch will have his uses defensively as well.\n5:8 Comment: We've got two against one here, now three against two.\n5:11 Comment: Wijnaldum.\n5:14 Comment: A bit of a steer by Henderson.\n5:17 Comment: Went too bad, well worked.\n5:20 Comment: Milner did well at the short corner.\n5:23 Comment: A little bit slow to get out there, I thought.\n5:25 Comment: It opened up nicely, not a bad effort.\n5:30 Comment: That's one Premier League goal this season,\n5:32 Comment: was a special one at Chelsea.\n5:35 Comment: He's been a huge influence,\n5:38 Comment: taking on that armband from Steven Gerrard,\n5:41 Comment: taking on a role pretty similar to Gerrard's as well.\n5:46 Comment: A bit of favouritism there, but he's my favourite player\n5:48 Comment: because early on in his Anfield career,\n5:50 Comment: question marks, knew he'd come through,\n5:53 Comment: just done it with style.\n5:55 Comment: You sold him, didn't you?\n5:56 Comment: Sort of.\n5:57 Comment: Seemed a good idea at the time, man.\n6:5 Comment: Heredia.\n6:9 Comment: Wijnaldum.\n6:12 Comment: I was meaning that as a compliment.\n6:14 Comment: You did good business for Sandberg Football Club.\n6:17 Comment: Would love to have kept him for a couple of years,\n6:19 Comment: but knew he was going to loftier pastures.\n6:23 Comment: I mean, I loved it there.\n6:25 Comment: The glance on that needed the intervention of Grant.\n6:32 Comment: Peter's playing it into an area\n6:34 Comment: that's going to be a bit difficult for Glenn Whelan.\n6:37 Comment: He got a free kick out of it.\n6:41 Comment: There ain't too many blue shirts in there\n6:43 Comment: with the two playing up top.\n6:44 Comment: I know there's three at the back,\n6:45 Comment: but Glenn Whelan was very isolated there,\n6:47 Comment: as that ball came in, he had to be seen well.\n6:49 Comment: Marquez looks out at it now, you can see...\n6:53 Comment: Just out of the picture, Joe Allen making forward runs,\n6:56 Comment: wanting to give them almost three up front at times,\n6:59 Comment: so they can keep...\n7:2 Comment: Liverpool occupied at the back, and if they have to go long,\n7:5 Comment: there are players there that have a chance of receiving it for Stoke.\n7:10 Comment: Mane.\n7:11 Comment: Arrigi.\n7:14 Comment: Neres Clyne.\n7:20 Comment: Mane just slowing it down for a moment,\n7:22 Comment: allowing Stoke to regroup.\n7:28 Comment: Henderson.\n7:41 Comment: Now Lovren.\n7:44 Comment: Clyne.\n7:50 Comment: Clyne overcooks it.\n7:54 Comment: So far, the three of Johnson, Shawcross and Martins-Indy.\n8:1 Comment: In front of Lee Grant.\n8:5 Comment: Nothing reasonably secure.\n8:7 Comment: It'll be a long night at Anfield.\n8:9 Comment: The Stoke teams of the past\n8:12 Comment: would testify.\n8:15 Comment: Mane.\n8:23 Comment: Here's Firmino.\n8:26 Comment: Strange with the Wijnaldum.\n8:28 Comment: Firmino again.\n8:33 Comment: Clyne.\n8:38 Comment: Mane.\n8:41 Comment: Trying to set up Wijnaldum, but he wasn't in the mood to shoot.\n8:49 Comment: Lovren.\n8:56 Comment: Not trying to get that down, but Lovren was a better reader of the trajectory.\n9:4 Comment: Lallana waiting for Clyne.\n9:12 Comment: Firmino.\n9:15 Comment: Back for Henderson.\n9:17 Comment: Just too long.\n9:18 Comment: Milner has made the dart in from left back.\n9:20 Comment: Yes, he has. He goes into a good area.\n9:24 Comment: Jordan a little bit across himself, but it was close.\n9:26 Comment: Good vision, saw the run.\n9:29 Comment: Just overcooked.\n9:33 Comment: There's no doubt that chasing Chelsea is the name of the game.\n9:36 Comment: Those who are chasing the title.\n9:40 Comment: Most of the rest of the chasing pack won yesterday.\n9:43 Comment: Spurs don't play until tomorrow.\n9:53 Comment: Tom by Wolters.\n9:58 Comment: He chases again and towards both Crouch and Allen.\n10:1 Comment: Well claimed by Mignolet.\n10:2 Comment: Asserted goalkeeping.\n10:4 Comment: Yes, it was needed to be.\n10:5 Comment: Crouch was lurking in behind.\n10:7 Comment: He's just played it behind Jonathan Wolters.\n10:13 Comment: Joe Allen relishing the chance to play more regularly than he did.\n10:18 Comment: Certainly in the latter time of his season as a Liverpool player.\n10:25 Comment: Wijnaldum.\n10:28 Comment: Firmino couldn't quite get there.\n10:31 Comment: He's got a chance to get back.\n10:34 Comment: Firmino couldn't quite get there.\n10:37 Comment: Into a good Origi.\n10:41 Comment: Johnson trying to find a way out.\n10:44 Comment: A help of Duf.\n10:46 Comment: Nicely worked by Stoke.\n10:48 Comment: And they're still going with Allen.\n10:51 Comment: Check back, there weren't too many options to his left.\n10:56 Comment: Still remains a very well thought of by the Liverpool supporters.\n11:4 Comment: Shawcross, Martinsending.\n11:9 Comment: And of course, who is Glenn Whelan.\n11:12 Comment: What's going on?\n11:14 Comment: Ticking over like a metronome.\n11:15 Comment: Season in, season out.\n11:19 Comment: Yeah, underrated.\n11:20 Comment: Undervalued by onlookers, but not so much\n11:23 Comment: the managers who he's worked for.\n11:26 Comment: Wolters. I could say the same of that, really.\n11:29 Comment: Here's Allen.\n11:31 Comment: Duf crossing early.\n11:34 Comment: Crouched a fight for and knock it.\n11:37 Comment: Goldwoods.\n11:40 Comment: Set up Wolters as well.\n11:43 Comment: Peters.\n11:44 Comment: What a good, well, it's not so.\n11:46 Comment: He's a great header.\n11:47 Comment: And Menele can only knock it into the net.\n11:49 Comment: And Jonathan Wolters, who grew up as an Everton fan,\n11:53 Comment: family of Everton season ticket holders,\n11:56 Comment: scores against Liverpool here.\n11:59 Comment: And the policy for Marc Hughes,\n12:2 Comment: of playing two up top,\n12:4 Comment: has started well.\n12:5 Comment: Not so well for Menele, who put up an arm,\n12:8 Comment: but only could knock it into the net.\n12:10 Comment: Peters does really well here, as it makes its way back out.\n12:12 Comment: Crouch puts a good header.\n12:13 Comment: You can see the intent on the Stoke players.\n12:15 Comment: They've got numbers in the box.\n12:16 Comment: It works its way out.\n12:18 Comment: You see, he manages just to have control of it.\n12:20 Comment: Doesn't really look up, knows he'll get in there,\n12:22 Comment: but in front of his man,\n12:24 Comment: and it's Lovren.\n12:26 Comment: Wolters is so determined to get there.\n12:28 Comment: You can see, a little bit slow to get back to defender.\n12:31 Comment: And Menele, well, it comes at him pretty quickly,\n12:33 Comment: but when he gets a strong hand to it,\n12:35 Comment: you probably expect him to keep it out.\n12:38 Comment: It's only the third league goal\n12:40 Comment: that Stoke have scored at Anfield in 40 years.\n12:49 Comment: And the other two were consolations in heavy defeats,\n12:53 Comment: including one by Bojan here in April,\n12:56 Comment: and another one by Paul Bracewell,\n12:59 Comment: in a 5-1 defeat back in 1983.\n13:5 Comment: Well, there has been some talk up here on Merseyside, Nile,\n13:8 Comment: about Liverpool.\n13:9 Comment: Big game at Goodison.\n13:12 Comment: Big game here against Manchester City on Saturday.\n13:14 Comment: This was sort of something that was going to slip in between,\n13:17 Comment: and what about the priorities and the concentration?\n13:20 Comment: Yeah, well, there's such a buzz up here,\n13:21 Comment: the red half of the city, you know,\n13:22 Comment: this was a bread and butter, three points to a lot of people,\n13:25 Comment: but Stoke's resilience, they've contained teams like Liverpool\n13:30 Comment: for many years now, Pulis originally, Mark Hughes now,\n13:33 Comment: and I think what's noticeable about them tonight\n13:36 Comment: is their ability to get players forward.\n13:38 Comment: They're not sitting back, they're not parking the bus,\n13:40 Comment: they're having a right go here, in a style that's altered,\n13:44 Comment: but seems to be working so well for them.\n13:48 Comment: Big question mark now for Liverpool\n13:49 Comment: to get back into this game.\n13:52 Comment: Nereide.\n13:54 Comment: A leap forward to him by Lallana.\n14:2 Comment: Puyol's been stopped here.\n14:5 Comment: Very unlovely to get some treatment.\n14:7 Comment: Yeah, I think he's gone a little crouch for the header,\n14:10 Comment: I think it's...\n14:12 Comment: Ended up taking a knock to the nose.\n14:20 Comment: You see it here as it loops in, he comes out over Crouch.\n14:24 Comment: Nice.\n14:25 Comment: And then he's just headed back into the head of Crouch,\n14:29 Comment: and that's a sole one for him.\n14:33 Comment: Lots to think about now.\n14:36 Comment: And one more look at the goal, Jonathan Walters,\n14:39 Comment: he's...\n14:41 Comment: As reliable, you know he's going to give you 100 per cent performance,\n14:44 Comment: but he also pops up to get good goals,\n14:46 Comment: and has a desire to get across as man.\n14:49 Comment: But what about the goalkeeper, is it...\n14:51 Comment: It's obviously not strong enough an arm.\n14:53 Comment: Yeah, and his position you may question as well.\n14:55 Comment: A couple of things there.\n14:57 Comment: But he'd also be able to ask at half-time\n15:0 Comment: why was Walters allowed to get such a free header,\n15:2 Comment: but it was an awesome...\n15:3 Comment: Oh, terrific early cross.\n15:4 Comment: It was, that was the point.\n15:5 Comment: From Eric Peters.\n15:6 Comment: That was the point, and that's what we're...\n15:7 Comment: You in your outstanding career will have appreciated\n15:9 Comment: the value of early crosses.\n15:10 Comment: Well, absolutely, he didn't have to look up, did he?\n15:12 Comment: He was in an awkward enough angle,\n15:14 Comment: he did really well to put it in there,\n15:16 Comment: and it came as a bit of a shock, I think, to Minulay\n15:18 Comment: when the header came goalward bound.\n15:21 Comment: And Lovren, who'd let his man run,\n15:23 Comment: and Minulay between them,\n15:26 Comment: don't get top marks for their defending.\n15:29 Comment: But that's not it.\n15:30 Comment: It's Walters, what a great goal.\n15:31 Comment: Origi.\n15:41 Comment: Tasseling with Shaw across.\n15:43 Comment: Lallana.\n15:45 Comment: Quick on the scene, Firmino.\n15:47 Comment: Milner on his strong side.\n15:53 Comment: Gets a few claps there from his manager,\n15:55 Comment: he wants to depress now,\n15:56 Comment: wants to start taking shots at goal,\n15:59 Comment: get this thing back on track,\n16:1 Comment: makes its way out to Montaganswine,\n16:3 Comment: tries to curl in the far top corner with a bit of pace.\n16:8 Comment: Lovren Klopp likes to train his players\n16:10 Comment: a couple of days before matches at kick-off time.\n16:13 Comment: Yesterday was fine, they trained at 5 o'clock,\n16:15 Comment: the day before was Christmas Day.\n16:18 Comment: He was kind to them, he said,\n16:20 Comment: we can train at 11 and then go back to your families.\n16:22 Comment: Slight change, maybe psychologically,\n16:25 Comment: he could see an advantage in helping the players.\n16:28 Comment: But he'd be thinking at the moment,\n16:30 Comment: here's Peters crossing again,\n16:31 Comment: it's a corner for Stoke.\n16:34 Comment: Haven't scored too many heavy goals this season,\n16:36 Comment: don't typecast them in that way.\n16:39 Comment: We used to do that, but now there's a lot more to them.\n16:41 Comment: Ability to knock the ball around nowadays,\n16:44 Comment: it's impressive.\n16:46 Comment: Decent strong side off the ball,\n16:48 Comment: but the players are not going to be able to do that.\n16:50 Comment: Decent strong side off the ball,\n16:52 Comment: but they're putting it in quite early now today.\n16:56 Comment: I think Crouch has already benefited from it,\n16:58 Comment: he'll be looking to get on the end of some of these crosses.\n17:5 Comment: Peter Crouch incidentally hasn't scored a Premier League goal\n17:7 Comment: since a famous win for Stoke against Liverpool, 6-1,\n17:12 Comment: at the back end of the season before Lasso, 18 months ago.\n17:16 Comment: And that's the last Stoke goal scored in the Premier League\n17:18 Comment: by an Englishman.\n17:20 Comment: We don't count Jonathan Walters,\n17:22 Comment: because he plays for you.\n17:25 Comment: We took him a long time ago.\n17:26 Comment: He was born about four miles from here.\n17:29 Comment: Here's Crouch.\n17:33 Comment: Whelan.\n17:35 Comment: Walters.\n17:38 Comment: Good stuff from Stoke.\n17:40 Comment: Tactically, and Joe Allen.\n17:42 Comment: Still going!\n17:44 Comment: Turned aside by a minute late.\n17:46 Comment: And then...\n17:48 Comment: A desperate foot belonging to Klaver.\n17:55 Comment: Stoke probably realise that one,\n18:0 Comment: particularly this early at Anfield,\n18:3 Comment: may well not be enough.\n18:7 Comment: Kline.\n18:8 Comment: Klaver.\n18:10 Comment: From a neutral point of view, it's really set it up here.\n18:39 Comment: Kline.\n18:43 Comment: And Ruler.\n18:45 Comment: Just about to ensure that Stoke kept possession.\n18:48 Comment: And Kruise yelling for the free kick,\n18:50 Comment: and the referee was going to give it anyway.\n18:54 Comment: He does really well here, Walters, makes a new some serve.\n18:57 Comment: It's not the greatest ball through,\n18:58 Comment: and it should be dealt with by the Liverpool defenders,\n19:0 Comment: but they miss it out, and he gets on to it really well.\n19:3 Comment: Feints to shoot, it opens up from great save,\n19:5 Comment: and it's a half a yard away from a tap-in from Crouch.\n19:9 Comment: Peters whacks it back in, and Liverpool, well,\n19:12 Comment: they breed a sire a leaf.\n19:13 Comment: Eric Peters, the left wing-back in this formation,\n19:16 Comment: who's made the goal, and then very nearly got one for himself there.\n19:21 Comment: Knocked down by Crouch, Liverpool in trouble again.\n19:27 Comment: It's as if Stokefield is the vulnerability back there in the Liverpool defence,\n19:30 Comment: and they're really trying to probe it.\n19:34 Comment: They're doing a really good job here at Anfield so far.\n19:39 Comment: Shawcross.\n19:43 Comment: A second attempt against Origi.\n19:46 Comment: It's for Peters to go forward again.\n19:54 Comment: Mbula.\n19:58 Comment: Liverpool pressing.\n20:0 Comment: Mbula, and he needed a bit of help from Peters.\n20:3 Comment: Walters, tiny arm, Crouch, backing in.\n20:6 Comment: And...\n20:10 Comment: holding Liverpool off.\n20:20 Comment: Chief losing out.\n20:23 Comment: That's where Stoke might have a problem in these quick turnovers.\n20:28 Comment: Liverpool so good at getting quick counter-attacks going.\n20:37 Comment: The other side of the game, that was more the sort of player he was.\n20:41 Comment: A good passer, but...\n20:43 Comment: hustling and bustling in midfield, Stoke have used him further forward,\n20:47 Comment: and he's shanonied for goal.\n20:51 Comment: Henderson.\n20:54 Comment: 20 minutes in, four attempts each at goal.\n20:58 Comment: Surprising.\n21:2 Comment: Good play to Stoke, obviously.\n21:7 Comment: May it be so bold, this is the best opening 20 minutes in a Premier League game\n21:11 Comment: so far in this set of fixtures.\n21:13 Comment: Yeah, it's been very exciting, hasn't it?\n21:16 Comment: Real positivity in Stoke's play, and now\n21:19 Comment: Liverpool have been going along really well, knocking it\n21:22 Comment: around in matches at pace, dictating things.\n21:24 Comment: They now have to dig a little bit deeper in this game\n21:26 Comment: than perhaps they thought they might.\n21:28 Comment: Yes, and these games, of course, produce a lot of late goals.\n21:32 Comment: Firmino.\n21:33 Comment: For the re-deep.\n21:38 Comment: He certainly packed himself on the ball, Djufe.\n21:44 Comment: And he got himself into a little bit of overindulgence then.\n21:49 Comment: Yeah, he gave it away a couple of minutes ago as well,\n21:51 Comment: it's something that I'm sure\n21:54 Comment: he'll be able to do well in the next few games.\n21:56 Comment: He gave it away a couple of minutes ago as well,\n21:58 Comment: it's something that I'm sure\n22:1 Comment: Marc Hughes will be worried about.\n22:4 Comment: Remember, Saturday, Pep Guardiola will be bringing\n22:9 Comment: Manchester City here.\n22:13 Comment: And a couple of days later, David Moyes of Sunderland take on Liverpool.\n22:19 Comment: Scouting going on in earnest.\n22:22 Comment: Here's Mane.\n22:24 Comment: Lallana, good amongst the goals.\n22:28 Comment: And three in his last three Premier League games,\n22:30 Comment: three in his last three England games as well.\n22:33 Comment: That's good, that's where Mane's really good.\n22:37 Comment: Clever play, Lallana joins in, gets the shot away.\n22:41 Comment: Whelan does enough, but that's lifted the cup.\n22:45 Comment: May have been a hand there.\n22:50 Comment: Short corner again.\n22:54 Comment: Wijnaldum.\n22:58 Comment: Henderson on the half-volley.\n23:1 Comment: Marvan.\n23:5 Comment: Henderson once more.\n23:7 Comment: Inviting Lovren to cross it.\n23:10 Comment: A good cross it was to Firmino!\n23:14 Comment: Off the line.\n23:17 Comment: Wow, that was close.\n23:19 Comment: A lot of people are stating that was in, I think it's...\n23:23 Comment: As he drops...\n23:24 Comment: Back in play.\n23:27 Comment: Here's Wijnaldum.\n23:28 Comment: Liverpool getting closer, you feel.\n23:33 Comment: A bit of a panicky...\n23:36 Comment: ...experience by...\n23:39 Comment: ...Djouf.\n23:40 Comment: Once but twice, all hands on the pump for Stoke.\n23:53 Comment: Go on, go on, go on!\n24:1 Comment: Problem for Ndiram Djouf.\n24:5 Comment: Well, Firmino thought he'd scored.\n24:8 Comment: Peter Crouch had other ideas.\n24:10 Comment: Yes, as he drops back in into a really good position.\n24:13 Comment: Johnson might have been behind him anyway.\n24:16 Comment: And the crowd were cheering now, because I think they thought...\n24:18 Comment: ...as it went in off Mignolet at the other end...\n24:20 Comment: ...that it was going to go in off Crouch at this end.\n24:22 Comment: It did.\n24:24 Comment: Just missed the post in it to go out for the corner kick.\n24:28 Comment: Good response now from Liverpool, they needed to do this.\n24:32 Comment: Got themselves...\n24:34 Comment: ...back into it.\n24:35 Comment: They've had a couple of good minutes now.\n24:37 Comment: They've got to build on that.\n24:39 Comment: Cut knows the next goal is so important.\n24:43 Comment: They've got to re-establish.\n24:45 Comment: But they're the ones to dictate the pace of this game.\n24:48 Comment: Let's talk about a great 20 minutes.\n24:49 Comment: Don't do them any harm.\n24:51 Comment: Obviously, they hope Djouf recovers.\n24:53 Comment: But a little bit of a disruption to the recent Liverpool momentum.\n24:57 Comment: They may not go...\n25:0 Comment: ...the miss.\n25:1 Comment: I think they might be working out who's the best replacement...\n25:4 Comment: ...if he has to go off.\n25:5 Comment: They've got Bonnie.\n25:8 Comment: But I don't think they put him out there.\n25:10 Comment: Of course, they've got Shaqiri, Bojan.\n25:14 Comment: More likely candidates might be in the top ten.\n25:17 Comment: More likely candidates maybe.\n25:19 Comment: And they've got Afali, who's just come back.\n25:21 Comment: He's not played this season.\n25:24 Comment: Could be his neck of the woods on the right-hand side.\n25:28 Comment: He seems to be okay.\n25:30 Comment: No major signals going over to the bench.\n25:33 Comment: Portman saying everything's okay.\n25:34 Comment: Hand up.\n25:36 Comment: It's his own tackle that caused it.\n25:39 Comment: And Mane.\n25:48 Comment: He's back on.\n25:54 Comment: Lovren.\n26:9 Comment: Henderson.\n26:11 Comment: And Nelson.\n26:12 Comment: And Lovren, lucky to get it back.\n26:14 Comment: And get it back, he did.\n26:17 Comment: Henderson.\n26:18 Comment: Looking for...\n26:21 Comment: ...the route run ball.\n26:24 Comment: Crouch.\n26:28 Comment: Ball by Ndula.\n26:30 Comment: Lucas.\n26:31 Comment: One of those where he becomes active when he pursues it...\n26:33 Comment: ...and the flag goes up a bit later than the crowd want.\n26:36 Comment: Yeah, he made his way forward because he knew it was coming in early.\n26:39 Comment: That's what Stoke are doing.\n26:40 Comment: Any time it's come out wide, they try to whip it in.\n26:43 Comment: In behind. Curl it in behind the Liverpool defence.\n26:45 Comment: Well, it's just strayed a little bit there.\n26:47 Comment: They're asking some good questions of the Liverpool defence.\n26:50 Comment: Good tactic.\n26:59 Comment: Stoke leading.\n27:1 Comment: And we have a header in the 12th minute from Jonathan Walters.\n27:5 Comment: And then they got what seemed a strong hand too, but it wasn't strong enough.\n27:13 Comment: Great work from Henderson.\n27:17 Comment: Brilliant.\n27:39 Comment: England manager on duty as well.\n27:42 Comment: Right of Adam Lallana.\n27:44 Comment: Glenn Johnson of course was in a recent England squad.\n27:47 Comment: And wasn't able to take part in it because of injury.\n27:50 Comment: It was quite a recall for the Stoke man.\n27:55 Comment: Maybe Peter Crouch is entertaining hopes.\n27:59 Comment: A comeback.\n28:1 Comment: Comeback tonight in the Premier League.\n28:2 Comment: Certainly as a starter.\n28:3 Comment: First time for four months.\n28:7 Comment: Duffe.\n28:8 Comment: Looking for Crouch.\n28:11 Comment: Not able to find him.\n28:12 Comment: Poor selection, he's got to take that down on his chest, develop something.\n28:16 Comment: Good play again.\n28:17 Comment: Lots of Stoke players going forward expecting the cross.\n28:20 Comment: Making it such an intriguing game.\n28:24 Comment: Have a walk from Marcuse.\n28:26 Comment: And his management team and Jurgen Klopp.\n28:30 Comment: Maybe not expecting this kind of approach.\n28:38 Comment: Long way to go.\n28:41 Comment: Lovely.\n29:11 Comment: He's had plenty of time, as I said earlier, 10 days into the last game to work on this formation.\n29:27 Comment: Crouch goes down but Peters can take it on.\n29:30 Comment: Allen's waiting far post.\n29:32 Comment: And he couldn't slide it across to him.\n29:41 Comment: One-step Stufe.\n29:43 Comment: No-one has it this time.\n29:45 Comment: Surrounded by former team-mates.\n29:48 Comment: Peters.\n29:50 Comment: Walters.\n29:53 Comment: This is the stirring stuff from Stoke City.\n29:57 Comment: A strange season.\n30:0 Comment: No wins in their first seven games, then five wins in their next seven games.\n30:5 Comment: And they've come here three matches without a victory.\n30:11 Comment: Three most recent games.\n30:13 Comment: They lead at Anfield, then Crouch.\n30:16 Comment: Almost through for Walters again.\n30:23 Comment: Milner.\n30:25 Comment: Now Alana.\n30:27 Comment: Van Alden.\n30:38 Comment: Mane.\n30:39 Comment: Knocked off by Mbula.\n30:41 Comment: Walters flick wasn't properly executed.\n30:45 Comment: Now Alana.\n30:48 Comment: Milner.\n30:56 Comment: Thinking about having a crack and trying to find Origi's head, which he did.\n31:1 Comment: Origi was in a position where he really couldn't go for goal and kind of knock it down for someone arriving into the middle.\n31:9 Comment: Another chance developed itself a couple of moments ago.\n31:12 Comment: Crouch.\n31:13 Comment: He's probably going to get a free kick, but well done referee.\n31:16 Comment: Michael Oliver allows the advantage.\n31:18 Comment: Peters just pulling it back towards Walters.\n31:20 Comment: Joe Allen got his arms out.\n31:22 Comment: Once again, Liverpool relieved to see it cleared.\n31:28 Comment: It's been an impressive wing-back tonight.\n31:31 Comment: He has been the flying Dutchman now on the left-hand side.\n31:40 Comment: Mane.\n31:46 Comment: Mentioned Tottenham.\n31:50 Comment: They've completely set the fixtures with their trip to Southampton.\n31:52 Comment: Sky Sports 1 from 7.30 tomorrow.\n32:4 Comment: Long from Klaver.\n32:6 Comment: Martins Indie.\n32:7 Comment: Tussle aerially with Mane.\n32:9 Comment: Peters.\n32:14 Comment: Off to Alana.\n32:18 Comment: He perhaps won the FA Cup in his time as a Liverpool player.\n32:21 Comment: Took part in a Champions League final.\n32:27 Comment: Outstanding career.\n32:29 Comment: He's on 96 Premier League goals in 18 months since the last one.\n32:33 Comment: We have our 100 Club on Sky Sports.\n32:36 Comment: We're all ready Peter if you can do it.\n32:40 Comment: Video tape if that's not too old-fashioned an expression.\n32:44 Comment: Ready in the selection of goals.\n32:47 Comment: Probably fitting to a fine career.\n32:49 Comment: Remembering way back QPR as a baby.\n32:51 Comment: Six foot seven baby.\n32:58 Comment: No foul.\n32:59 Comment: No stopped.\n33:1 Comment: The All-Cup remonstrates.\n33:2 Comment: Stoke play on.\n33:5 Comment: Henderson.\n33:8 Comment: Put his concentration back and then forced the pass.\n33:11 Comment: Frustration around Anfield at the moment.\n33:14 Comment: Yeah and you know this man's program notes he was urging the crowd to stay with the team.\n33:17 Comment: It might take a while to get going.\n33:20 Comment: And that's how it's panned out.\n33:21 Comment: They're a little disjointed at times here.\n33:24 Comment: This is not the festive fair that the fans were looking forward to.\n33:29 Comment: And he's got work to do.\n33:30 Comment: He's got to convince his players that they have to get the fans on their side.\n33:35 Comment: And passes like that from Henderson doesn't help.\n33:37 Comment: Although he did ever so well to get the ball back.\n33:40 Comment: Still arguing that it was a free kick to begin with.\n33:48 Comment: Milner.\n33:52 Comment: It's good work by Arrugia.\n33:56 Comment: Firmino going towards the near post.\n33:57 Comment: Mane with the ball.\n34:0 Comment: Milner.\n34:2 Comment: Yes.\n34:3 Comment: Squeezed it in for the equalizer.\n34:5 Comment: Adam Milner.\n34:7 Comment: 11 minutes before half time.\n34:10 Comment: The angle was tight.\n34:12 Comment: But he can solve those problems.\n34:16 Comment: He sure can.\n34:18 Comment: You know I do think Stoke and in particular Glenn Johnson might have had a chance to clear this.\n34:22 Comment: Great play from Arrugia.\n34:23 Comment: That really sets everything up.\n34:25 Comment: Mane then keeps a cool head.\n34:27 Comment: Looks up.\n34:28 Comment: Looking for options.\n34:29 Comment: And as he puts it in there it goes towards goal.\n34:31 Comment: Yet Glenn Johnson he might have just fired as good as that.\n34:34 Comment: And a first time clearance.\n34:35 Comment: Instead it's as if he's tried to control it.\n34:39 Comment: Crowd are singing now.\n34:40 Comment: That's the response the manager wanted at that point there.\n34:42 Comment: Yeah I think Johnson just has to clear it.\n34:45 Comment: First duty of the defender is to make sure the danger is averted.\n34:51 Comment: And Glenn Johnson unfortunately set it up nicely.\n34:55 Comment: And this man can celebrate.\n34:58 Comment: It's important for Marques's men that they're not too deflated by that.\n35:6 Comment: They've certainly shown since getting their goal that they've got the capacity to get more.\n35:13 Comment: The game has played with the mind as well as with the feet.\n35:20 Comment: Slightly misused of the feet here.\n35:23 Comment: This is Joe Allen.\n35:28 Comment: This might slow Joe Allen down a little bit.\n35:29 Comment: He's been tigerish all game.\n35:31 Comment: See why Naldum is hustling.\n35:33 Comment: He goes in late.\n35:34 Comment: Yeah I think the referee has every right to put him in the book.\n35:38 Comment: I wonder if that will curtail him a little now.\n35:40 Comment: Where you go.\n35:42 Comment: Do you need to do it there?\n35:44 Comment: That far up the pitch in a wide area.\n35:49 Comment: He thought he could get the ball in short.\n35:55 Comment: And at Liverpool with their tails up at last.\n35:58 Comment: Milner.\n36:6 Comment: Oh, Grant.\n36:9 Comment: Lee Grant of course very late.\n36:10 Comment: Premier League debut this evening at the age of 33.\n36:18 Comment: Fourth goal last four appearances.\n36:19 Comment: Great stuff from Lallana.\n36:23 Comment: If it were gifted a little bit from Johnson, no matter.\n36:27 Comment: He was on the move, he was hungry, wanted something to happen and it came good for him.\n36:34 Comment: He's got such deftness in his play which is often used for creating goals for others.\n36:39 Comment: But it produced the goal for himself then.\n36:49 Comment: He didn't get too much of the action in the derby.\n36:52 Comment: It was fast and frenetic in his area of the pitch.\n36:56 Comment: Here he is now.\n36:57 Comment: As Liverpool try and, you really would say gain control.\n37:3 Comment: Tough going for them because of some thoughtful strategy by Sloat said it.\n37:12 Comment: Here he is again.\n37:13 Comment: He climbs past.\n37:17 Comment: A bit over by Firmino.\n37:19 Comment: Brilliant play from Liverpool.\n37:21 Comment: One side of the pitch, sweep it across.\n37:24 Comment: And then the good ball.\n37:26 Comment: Climb plays in the path of Lallana.\n37:28 Comment: Nice ball back.\n37:30 Comment: Finish is just a little too high.\n37:33 Comment: Liverpool, the tails are up now.\n37:37 Comment: Just off the ground when he made contact.\n37:39 Comment: Slightest bobble.\n37:43 Comment: Anfield is alive and making noise now.\n37:54 Comment: Alan.\n37:58 Comment: I do feel Stokes best way of defending is to keep attacking.\n38:3 Comment: I'm not talking in riddles here.\n38:5 Comment: Yeah, I'd agree with that.\n38:7 Comment: They've got to go ahead with the game plan.\n38:9 Comment: In truth, they're a little unlucky to have conceded.\n38:11 Comment: Said it before, could have been dealt with.\n38:13 Comment: And the way the play has gone, they could have had a second by the time that equaliser came.\n38:17 Comment: So, yeah, plenty to work on.\n38:19 Comment: And plenty to believe in.\n38:22 Comment: Kicked in by Walters.\n38:24 Comment: Made by Lallana.\n38:26 Comment: Helped on by Origi.\n38:29 Comment: Mane.\n38:33 Comment: Now Clyde.\n38:37 Comment: They'd love to go in Liverpool with their noses in front at half-time.\n38:42 Comment: A bit of a climb.\n38:45 Comment: Just one goal behind, but Stokes threatening, as Niall says, for more.\n38:51 Comment: Firmino.\n38:55 Comment: Milner.\n38:56 Comment: Can cross it with his left foot.\n38:58 Comment: And Grant comes out.\n39:1 Comment: And makes a good take.\n39:4 Comment: 450th career league game, and only 13 of them in the Premier League.\n39:8 Comment: The last 13.\n39:10 Comment: That's great for him, isn't it?\n39:14 Comment: He's had a stellar career, not at this level.\n39:18 Comment: Gets his chance, and you know, looks the part.\n39:22 Comment: He's done a good job.\n39:24 Comment: With the transfer window approaching,\n39:26 Comment: a reminder that there is plenty of talent sprinkled around English football.\n39:32 Comment: But you can bet he's hoping for a permanent deal.\n39:36 Comment: Jack Butland has had a terrible time in 2016.\n39:40 Comment: Injury claim for England, and then the same ankle being damaged\n39:45 Comment: at the start of this season.\n39:49 Comment: Outwell by Johnson.\n40:1 Comment: The wide players, the wing-backs, if you like,\n40:3 Comment: Manjush has played in the Premier League as a central striker.\n40:11 Comment: It's a tacking decision in itself,\n40:13 Comment: rather than putting a more conventional right back out there.\n40:20 Comment: They press high again, as they can do.\n40:23 Comment: And of course, an error from the back by Liverpool.\n40:30 Comment: Henderson.\n40:35 Comment: Arrigi.\n40:40 Comment: Here's Clyde.\n40:49 Comment: Mane, past Imbula, and he's won it out.\n40:52 Comment: And that was very tight for Stoke, and Imbula in particular.\n40:57 Comment: Yeah, he was coming in...\n40:58 Comment: Close to committing an offence.\n41:0 Comment: Absolutely, he was going to come into a heavy challenge.\n41:2 Comment: Mane's probably hoping for it,\n41:4 Comment: just steps back a little bit, doesn't go through with it.\n41:8 Comment: Dimensions of the pitch did the rest.\n41:13 Comment: Mane's got eight Premier League goals,\n41:17 Comment: Lallana seven now.\n41:23 Comment: He's been showing them around with Liverpool,\n41:25 Comment: that must be very gratifying to Jurgen Klopp.\n41:27 Comment: By no means a one-man team,\n41:29 Comment: when you think that Daniel Sturridge hasn't scored in the Premier League this season.\n41:35 Comment: Here's Mane.\n41:39 Comment: Had a little bit more time in the end than he thought,\n41:42 Comment: to Brian Shawcross, with an indication that Stoke are starting to feel the pressure now.\n41:47 Comment: They'll be happy to go in at 1-1,\n41:49 Comment: and you feel that might not be the case.\n41:53 Comment: Pile forward.\n41:59 Comment: Ouch, having to come deep.\n42:1 Comment: And help with defending.\n42:2 Comment: Second ball's been picked up by Liverpool more and more often.\n42:6 Comment: Lallana.\n42:13 Comment: Liverpool really pressing now,\n42:15 Comment: looking to get a second before they go in.\n42:17 Comment: 81 per cent possession last ten minutes.\n42:20 Comment: The tide has turned.\n42:22 Comment: Mind you, they had that at Burnley, didn't they,\n42:24 Comment: back in August, and lost.\n42:27 Comment: Klein.\n42:30 Comment: Origi.\n42:32 Comment: Klein might get to it.\n42:33 Comment: Petr is now very much part of a back five.\n42:45 Comment: Mane, Origi.\n42:47 Comment: And Klein.\n42:49 Comment: And now, the two-man team.\n42:51 Comment: Oh!\n42:54 Comment: Mane, Origi,\n42:56 Comment: has caught him, that Liverpool want to play on,\n42:58 Comment: because they've got Milner coming forward here.\n43:3 Comment: Origi's still down,\n43:4 Comment: Michael Oliver having a look across,\n43:6 Comment: to assess the situation.\n43:9 Comment: He sees Liverpool playing on,\n43:10 Comment: and he's happy to let them do so,\n43:12 Comment: and they're happy to do so,\n43:13 Comment: for Mino!\n43:15 Comment: Scores!\n43:18 Comment: By the narrowest of margins.\n43:21 Comment: Effectively, when they were down to ten men,\n43:23 Comment: he's been in the headlines today,\n43:26 Comment: for the wrong reason.\n43:28 Comment: But he's making football news here,\n43:30 Comment: and Liverpool have turned it around,\n43:32 Comment: as one suspected they might do,\n43:34 Comment: even before half-time.\n43:36 Comment: Yeah, they sure have.\n43:37 Comment: They've been knocking this last ten minutes.\n43:39 Comment: You see, he's allowed turn,\n43:40 Comment: that's the critical bit here.\n43:43 Comment: As it gets played into him,\n43:45 Comment: you'll see, first of all,\n43:46 Comment: it comes from just a simple enough ball,\n43:47 Comment: but he's allowed turn.\n43:48 Comment: It's that that sets things up.\n43:50 Comment: It's a half-yard too slow,\n43:51 Comment: short cross in the initial instance,\n43:54 Comment: and that allows him to get his shot on goal,\n43:56 Comment: but he's done really well.\n43:58 Comment: It ain't that simple.\n43:59 Comment: The turn is one thing,\n44:0 Comment: it's on his left foot.\n44:1 Comment: He has to get it out of his feet,\n44:3 Comment: near enough to him that the tackle can't come in.\n44:6 Comment: Well, it was precision, wasn't it?\n44:10 Comment: Off both posts,\n44:12 Comment: and a different half-time team talk\n44:15 Comment: than perhaps the one he was dreaming of\n44:16 Comment: ten, fifteen minutes ago.\n44:19 Comment: Great moment.\n44:21 Comment: But when you've got goals in you,\n44:23 Comment: even when things are a bit sticky,\n44:26 Comment: there are solutions, as the coaches say these days.\n44:31 Comment: It's not the total solution here,\n44:33 Comment: because they'll have it in them to come again.\n44:36 Comment: But what has been an excellent contribution\n44:39 Comment: from Mark Hughes's men in this first half\n44:41 Comment: looks as though you're going to see them\n44:43 Comment: going into the away dressing room,\n44:44 Comment: training at the interval.\n44:49 Comment: Not long ago, Mark, we looked at four attempts each.\n44:53 Comment: Well, that's changed, hasn't it?\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: The chance of the century being reached.\n0:3 Comment: It's their 48th Premier League game under this charismatic manager.\n0:14 Comment: Spoke certainly suggested in that first 25 minutes now\n0:17 Comment: that they have got more to offer in this game.\n0:20 Comment: Yeah, they've got to rediscover that now.\n0:22 Comment: Jamie said it at half-time.\n0:24 Comment: Crouch and Walters were causing all sorts of problems.\n0:27 Comment: Joe Allen linking up, joining in.\n0:30 Comment: They definitely ruffled Liverpool's feathers in that period of the game.\n0:33 Comment: But they've got to get back to it.\n0:37 Comment: It was effective.\n0:39 Comment: They looked very comfortable that first 20 minutes or so.\n0:42 Comment: Could easily have gone two ahead.\n0:45 Comment: So they've got to believe in themselves.\n0:46 Comment: I'm sure Marc Hughes will be telling that at half-time.\n0:50 Comment: There is something for them.\n0:52 Comment: With Crouch and Walters up front.\n0:55 Comment: He'll know the next goal is vital.\n0:59 Comment: His team can get it.\n1:4 Comment: They can rewrite the history books.\n1:12 Comment: Gwyneldon.\n1:21 Comment: Allen.\n1:25 Comment: Taken out of it by Henderson.\n1:42 Comment: Walters trying to head it down.\n1:44 Comment: Allen.\n1:52 Comment: The palm play was Clarbann.\n1:57 Comment: Ball forward by Jordan Henderson.\n2:1 Comment: Nalani.\n2:8 Comment: Henderson.\n2:10 Comment: Camino.\n2:16 Comment: Liverpool third.\n2:18 Comment: Nine points behind Chelsea.\n2:20 Comment: Needing to win to regain second place above Manchester City.\n2:31 Comment: Andrula.\n2:45 Comment: Allen.\n2:46 Comment: Slice by Mbule.\n2:50 Comment: Gwyneldon was grateful it fell his way off Mane.\n2:58 Comment: And for Crouch.\n3:1 Comment: He's trying to repeat the feat.\n3:5 Comment: Johnson.\n3:20 Comment: No great shape to the second half as yet.\n3:24 Comment: Stokes' plan is not the most thought-out tactic.\n3:28 Comment: Walters and Crouch probably having to rely now on aerial service.\n3:32 Comment: Liverpool just got to try and get it down, get the flow going the way they finished the half.\n3:39 Comment: A sign to climb, just roll it into space.\n3:43 Comment: Let's get there first.\n3:47 Comment: Trying now, supporting on the inside.\n3:51 Comment: Mane.\n3:54 Comment: A triangle of ex-Southampton players.\n3:59 Comment: Here's Clarbann.\n4:1 Comment: Surveying his options.\n4:5 Comment: He really makes a natural target.\n4:11 Comment: Here's Milner.\n4:13 Comment: Milner's trying to pick himself up, not for the first time in this game.\n4:18 Comment: Milner.\n4:20 Comment: Trying to whip it into that far corner.\n4:23 Comment: Opened up really well.\n4:24 Comment: Duff didn't cover himself in glory by falling over and staying down,\n4:27 Comment: but he was taking advantage of it, wasn't he, Milner?\n4:30 Comment: Really bright play, goes for the one-two.\n4:33 Comment: He's onside and trying to sweep it into the far corner, just overcooks it.\n4:40 Comment: Good play from Liverpool.\n4:43 Comment: He's scored against Stoke for Newcastle and Manchester City,\n4:47 Comment: and he's missing there, finished, he should have scored for Liverpool.\n4:51 Comment: Against the same opposition.\n4:54 Comment: Duff.\n4:56 Comment: Walters.\n5:3 Comment: Milner, the older end of this Liverpool team.\n5:9 Comment: 20 of over 30s for Stoke City.\n5:14 Comment: Here's Clyne.\n5:18 Comment: The younger old Liverpool usually outrun the opposition,\n5:21 Comment: that's part of the clock mantra.\n5:33 Comment: He will be 30 next birthday.\n5:38 Comment: Just looking down at Origi, Martin, he's apologised to about four Liverpool players,\n5:42 Comment: the first time he's come out and got on the ball and given it away.\n5:45 Comment: A couple of really good options.\n5:49 Comment: Ended up apologising to people.\n5:55 Comment: Somehow falling into the clearance.\n5:59 Comment: Come on, Origi!\n6:10 Comment: Oh, that was a bit early.\n6:13 Comment: Didn't really give Walters a chance to jump.\n6:15 Comment: And then a spat between Wijnaldum and Duff,\n6:19 Comment: that's not the way as quickly as it started.\n6:21 Comment: Well, Walters feels for him, he knows his craft.\n6:23 Comment: He backs him, but not aggressively enough to catch the referee's attention.\n6:28 Comment: Manufactures himself.\n6:30 Comment: And his team a free kick.\n6:31 Comment: Not giving out about that, did plenty of it myself.\n6:37 Comment: Clever play.\n6:50 Comment: Not to where his team-mates were hoping it would go,\n6:52 Comment: or where his manager would hope it would go.\n6:54 Comment: He needed a bit of bend on it.\n6:56 Comment: Yeah, pace going in towards the penalty spot,\n6:58 Comment: that's what I thought was going to happen.\n7:2 Comment: Straight away he gets the subs to warm up.\n7:8 Comment: Well, Wilfred Bonny hasn't really set the world on fire\n7:13 Comment: since his move from Manchester City.\n7:15 Comment: He had a couple of goals in that Monday night game\n7:18 Comment: when we brought you against Swansea.\n7:21 Comment: Short cross for the defensive header.\n7:37 Comment: Wijnaldum.\n7:39 Comment: Pinned from him by the eager Alan.\n7:43 Comment: The crowd trying to cause a bit of confusion here.\n7:46 Comment: Lovren and Mignolet got very close.\n7:49 Comment: Which is often a recipe for disaster with defender and keeper.\n7:52 Comment: Has been in the past, but it got there.\n7:54 Comment: Didn't give credit in the end.\n7:56 Comment: Tricky situation.\n8:1 Comment: Ballana.\n8:2 Comment: Now Klaba.\n8:9 Comment: Working to work with Sadio Mane.\n8:14 Comment: That's a poor kick.\n8:16 Comment: That's a poor kick by Grahams and a poor touch by Henderson.\n8:24 Comment: Talk of Peter Crouch getting another year's contract from Stoke.\n8:29 Comment: He's doing his utmost here at Anfield\n8:32 Comment: on his return to Anfield tonight.\n8:35 Comment: Keep those thoughts coming.\n8:36 Comment: Alan.\n8:39 Comment: Now Duf.\n8:41 Comment: Mignolet stops the supply line for the Woods Crouching Company.\n8:45 Comment: Proven he can defend as well.\n8:46 Comment: James Milner opened up nicely for Duf there.\n8:49 Comment: Just hesitated a fraction.\n9:4 Comment: Alan takes.\n9:6 Comment: Crouch coming in.\n9:11 Comment: Alan again.\n9:17 Comment: Here's Whelan.\n9:18 Comment: Always sensing where he's needed.\n9:21 Comment: Johnson.\n9:24 Comment: Crouch in pursuit.\n9:33 Comment: Beaten by the corner flag as much as the opposition.\n9:36 Comment: I'm sure you.\n9:38 Comment: Time of year, if ever there is one for good humour.\n9:40 Comment: Michael Oliver.\n9:43 Comment: Not invoking the letter of the law.\n9:54 Comment: Femina.\n10:1 Comment: Too sophisticated.\n10:6 Comment: Lovren.\n10:9 Comment: Still interesting spell where Stoker doing their best to get back into the contest.\n10:15 Comment: Not quite opening.\n10:16 Comment: Threatening to open Liverpool up as much as they did in the first 20 minutes.\n10:21 Comment: The first half.\n10:22 Comment: It's going into what you call a scrappy phase.\n10:26 Comment: Try and do what they're best at.\n10:28 Comment: Neither of them succeeding yet in the first 10 minutes of the second half.\n10:32 Comment: Stoker more anxious.\n10:33 Comment: They've got to get back in this.\n10:36 Comment: Milner.\n10:38 Comment: Femina.\n10:42 Comment: Into Mane's path.\n10:43 Comment: He would have been clean through.\n10:53 Comment: Either side.\n10:56 Comment: Mane again.\n10:58 Comment: Flying high and low.\n10:59 Comment: Short pass.\n11:0 Comment: Defended.\n11:2 Comment: Lallana.\n11:4 Comment: Good work by Martin Zindy.\n11:7 Comment: Lallana.\n11:8 Comment: Rather took it away from Wijnaldum.\n11:10 Comment: No hard feelings.\n11:11 Comment: That's right.\n11:13 Comment: Took it off.\n11:14 Comment: He's about to pull the trigger.\n11:15 Comment: It comes out.\n11:16 Comment: Maybe there wasn't a shout.\n11:18 Comment: You can see Wijnaldum saying I was right on there.\n11:20 Comment: Wijnaldum.\n11:21 Comment: Could have taken it on for a shot that time.\n11:24 Comment: Stumbled.\n11:30 Comment: Henderson.\n11:35 Comment: Back in the centre back.\n11:37 Comment: Back.\n11:49 Comment: Back with a good touch.\n11:51 Comment: Couldn't quite turn that to Liverpool's advantage\n11:54 Comment: They come again.\n11:55 Comment: Origi.\n12:1 Comment: Looking to the left of Milner then Liverpool.\n12:6 Comment: Cline.\n12:7 Comment: Back to the right back\n12:12 Comment: That's touched from Wijnaldum.\n12:13 Comment: Went there to mop up.\n12:19 Comment: Crouch. Lovely control.\n12:23 Comment: Whelan.\n12:25 Comment: They haven't got a real sprinter in the shape of\n12:29 Comment: Walter's or Crouch.\n12:31 Comment: Yeah, the first part of it was decent. Crouch held it up, laid it off, but then\n12:35 Comment: there wasn't really anything there. Whelan had been far better off just coming out, building again and maybe just getting a cross in\n12:41 Comment: later on in the phase.\n12:43 Comment: Brushed it.\n12:50 Comment: That was Clyde again.\n12:52 Comment: They are so effective.\n12:54 Comment: I don't like that he's in a marauding mood.\n13:19 Comment: A little lull in the atmosphere at Anfield as if everyone's trying to work out what they're going to do with the rest of the evening.\n13:25 Comment: It's a 5.15 kick-off.\n13:28 Comment: Plenty of time to party.\n13:31 Comment: It just needs a spark now.\n13:33 Comment: Liverpool are in the lead so not essential that\n13:36 Comment: they go and create it, but at the same time\n13:39 Comment: they need to let Stoke back into this. It could get very, very tricky and\n13:44 Comment: as well as they finished the first half, they haven't come out the second half\n13:49 Comment: in quite the same form.\n13:54 Comment: Henderson.\n13:56 Comment: Origi.\n13:57 Comment: It's ended up in the back of the net. It is 3-1.\n14:2 Comment: Limbula was stretching for it.\n14:10 Comment: Paul came from a lax\n14:14 Comment: Stoke header.\n14:17 Comment: Yeah, again they could do better here.\n14:20 Comment: It's a really poor header.\n14:22 Comment: Don't understand what he was trying to do there.\n14:24 Comment: Henderson keeps it.\n14:25 Comment: Gets it back into play. Great pass.\n14:27 Comment: And well, Limbula\n14:29 Comment: in truth\n14:30 Comment: had to try and go for it because if he doesn't\n14:32 Comment: it's a tap-in.\n14:36 Comment: You can see\n14:38 Comment: no choice but to try and go for the ball and\n14:40 Comment: get something on it that will get it away from goal.\n14:43 Comment: Forsyth for him\n14:45 Comment: touched too much.\n14:47 Comment: And despite not being fluent or playing at their best this half,\n14:52 Comment: Liverpool\n14:54 Comment: are now really in the box.\n14:57 Comment: Mane would have converted it if Limbula hadn't stretched out that boot.\n15:2 Comment: That important\n15:4 Comment: next goal has gone Liverpool's way.\n15:6 Comment: Another period now, as you were rightly saying, they weren't really\n15:9 Comment: piling on the pressure but they might do now.\n15:12 Comment: Mane.\n15:14 Comment: Corner.\n15:16 Comment: Well, you get the feeling that Shaw will make one now.\n15:21 Comment: You get into\n15:22 Comment: to see a vulnerability about the Stoke players.\n15:28 Comment: It's OK, he gets it onto his left foot.\n15:31 Comment: Shawcross gets something on it.\n15:33 Comment: You feel it could be\n15:34 Comment: a difficult half an hour to come now.\n15:37 Comment: Stoke to dig deep, gather themselves back.\n15:41 Comment: Liverpool are smiling.\n15:56 Comment: Henderson.\n15:59 Comment: The run is coming from the right.\n16:0 Comment: Lallana.\n16:5 Comment: It's an old football saying, isn't it?\n16:8 Comment: You get strange results at Christmas.\n16:10 Comment: But\n16:12 Comment: Lallana\n16:14 Comment: got to keep the get the ball to the other player.\n16:17 Comment: If you don't\n16:18 Comment: have that\n16:20 Comment: form,\n16:22 Comment: you don't play very well at home.\n16:24 Comment: But\n16:26 Comment: there is some chance.\n16:27 Comment: You get strange results at Christmas, but nothing strange about the Premier League so far.\n16:33 Comment: Of course, this is the first game, with no games played on Christmas Eve.\n16:37 Comment: This is the first game of the holiday season,\n16:40 Comment: maybe as players get tired and teams have to be changed,\n16:44 Comment: we will get some results against current form and league status.\n16:52 Comment: Chelsea doing what they're doing, it's essential.\n16:55 Comment: But the likes of Liverpool and those chasing, they pick up the points over Christmas.\n17:3 Comment: Mean Chelsea team, well-oiled, going really well,\n17:6 Comment: they stay in touch, there can't be any more West Ham or Bournemouth performances from Liverpool.\n17:14 Comment: Shawcross.\n17:24 Comment: FANS CHANTING\n17:31 Comment: Down by Wolters, and it's Duke.\n17:37 Comment: And Lallana's down.\n17:41 Comment: Holding his head.\n17:42 Comment: Yes, as Duke held him off as he's gone in to get close.\n17:46 Comment: Firmino's setting up an elbow, you can see he shifts the touch here.\n17:55 Comment: Doesn't look as if it's a dangerous thing he's doing,\n17:59 Comment: he's pushed him away, his fingers have probably got him in the eye.\n18:2 Comment: Poked him in the eye, I think, is the issue there.\n18:10 Comment: Or a slap as his right hand came across.\n18:24 Comment: FANS SING OUT\n18:37 Comment: Here's Shawcross.\n18:41 Comment: And Panay started well here for Marc Hughes and company.\n18:47 Comment: Those two goals late in the first half tended to stifle it,\n18:52 Comment: but in the second half they've gone with it again,\n18:54 Comment: but it hasn't really influenced the shape of the match.\n18:58 Comment: Now the third goal's gone in for Liverpool,\n19:0 Comment: so I can't think about Plan B or C,\n19:3 Comment: as Becky is doing the adjustments.\n19:15 Comment: And Willock.\n19:22 Comment: FANS SING OUT\n19:25 Comment: And Schilt, though, looking at what Stoke have done this half,\n19:28 Comment: they tried to do their thing, but defensive frailty once again\n19:32 Comment: pops up to give Liverpool the advantage.\n19:34 Comment: They scarcely deserve that third goal.\n19:37 Comment: But now you'd think they might go on to score a fourth,\n19:41 Comment: and Marc Hughes, Marc Bone have done a good job to find a Plan B here.\n19:46 Comment: That's a lovely goal from Milner, made possible by the run of Wijnaldum.\n19:51 Comment: Milner joins in again.\n19:57 Comment: And again.\n20:1 Comment: Liverpool looking for more...\n20:4 Comment: And Grant stops.\n20:6 Comment: And header from Klein.\n20:8 Comment: Terrific play from Liverpool.\n20:12 Comment: Alan trying to mount a quick counter-attack,\n20:15 Comment: stopped in his tracks by Lovren.\n20:17 Comment: Mane.\n20:21 Comment: And again.\n20:25 Comment: And tries again.\n20:31 Comment: Liverpool...\n20:34 Comment: ...really in the mood again now.\n20:48 Comment: Mohamed and Sobe.\n20:51 Comment: It's coming on, the 20 minutes to the second half for Glenn Whelan.\n21:5 Comment: Maybe Alan's going to play a little bit deeper now.\n21:10 Comment: I think they've got to try and gamble and get some support up a little bit earlier.\n21:14 Comment: Walter's approach nowhere near as effective.\n21:17 Comment: This half has 20 minutes since half-time,\n21:20 Comment: they were since the first 20 minutes of the game.\n21:24 Comment: The feature of that, of course, was players getting up and supporting.\n21:29 Comment: Walter's giving chase here.\n21:44 Comment: Full of apology.\n21:47 Comment: To Ryan Aldam.\n21:51 Comment: A little frustrated here, he took a heavy touch on the ball,\n21:54 Comment: comes in late.\n21:57 Comment: Knew he'd done wrong, apologised.\n22:2 Comment: Roughly...\n22:5 Comment: ...pretty festive.\n22:8 Comment: And not producing a counter.\n22:12 Comment: Martinsen there.\n22:17 Comment: Oh, and Bula...\n22:19 Comment: ...was...\n22:21 Comment: ...desperately trying to...\n22:24 Comment: ...make up for a miscalculation of his own here.\n22:28 Comment: There's the first problem, of course, is the header.\n22:31 Comment: And he tries to get back in to help out.\n22:34 Comment: Don't know what he was doing with the header, but I feel from...\n22:37 Comment: ...at the end of that, because he knows he has to get there first,\n22:40 Comment: he knows Mane's coming in behind.\n22:43 Comment: But what he was trying to do with the header,\n22:46 Comment: I've no idea.\n22:49 Comment: Allen.\n22:59 Comment: He's being readied for Liverpool.\n23:4 Comment: He's normally with the header.\n23:8 Comment: Allen.\n23:17 Comment: The chance can be made, Daniel Sturridge is ready as well.\n23:21 Comment: So a double change...\n23:24 Comment: ...for Jurgen Klopp.\n23:26 Comment: Two players who are...\n23:28 Comment: ...definite candidates for a place in his first XI.\n23:35 Comment: Suggestion that he might feel that the job is done,\n23:38 Comment: removing Adam Lallana.\n23:40 Comment: The match is about to come thick and fast,\n23:42 Comment: particularly, of course, Manchester City here on Saturday.\n23:46 Comment: No chance...\n23:48 Comment: ...he could come on in the derby.\n23:52 Comment: As did Sturridge.\n23:55 Comment: It's a nice luxury to have, three-one up.\n23:58 Comment: Get more minutes into these guys, they'll want to make an impact,\n24:0 Comment: keep the whole thing going strong, preparing them better...\n24:5 Comment: ...for the tough couple of games to come.\n24:8 Comment: Big welcome back to Daniel Sturridge.\n24:17 Comment: Of course it was Sturridge who hit the post...\n24:20 Comment: ...in the fourth minute of added time at Goodison Park.\n24:24 Comment: Which led up to the Mane winning goal.\n24:29 Comment: Soghi.\n24:31 Comment: Mane.\n24:33 Comment: Mane by...\n24:35 Comment: ...Lovren.\n24:37 Comment: And an air of certainty.\n24:42 Comment: Wijnaldum.\n24:44 Comment: Firmino.\n24:49 Comment: Sturridge used to play, of course, for Mark Hughes,\n24:51 Comment: they were together at Manchester City.\n24:54 Comment: And he's been gifted surely his first Premier League goal of the season here,\n24:58 Comment: there it is!\n25:1 Comment: 4-1.\n25:5 Comment: And that is the end of Stoke City, who started so well.\n25:12 Comment: Oh, Socros...\n25:14 Comment: ...he's got to take the blame here, he doesn't look up,\n25:17 Comment: doesn't realise that Sturridge is lurking.\n25:21 Comment: No problem at all here, he gets a ball,\n25:23 Comment: he's telling him to go back to the goalkeeper,\n25:25 Comment: then he decides to go back.\n25:27 Comment: And that's a poor...\n25:29 Comment: Fair play to Sturridge, takes it around young...\n25:32 Comment: ...young Grant, old Grant.\n25:35 Comment: And knocks it in really, really well.\n25:38 Comment: But it should never have happened,\n25:40 Comment: like perhaps three of the goals tonight,\n25:44 Comment: that Liverpool have scored, very preventable,\n25:46 Comment: but that doesn't stop Sturridge,\n25:48 Comment: with his first involvement in the game,\n25:50 Comment: get himself on the score sheet.\n25:52 Comment: And that is...\n25:54 Comment: ...100 Premier League goals under Jurgen Klopp.\n25:59 Comment: And there's surely none more gift wrap...\n26:4 Comment: ...by the opposition.\n26:12 Comment: Good for Sturridge though.\n26:14 Comment: He'll be feeling better about pushing for a place now,\n26:18 Comment: and joining himself in this team.\n26:21 Comment: That's what you need, good players, great players like him and Origi,\n26:25 Comment: fighting hard, trying to get on the team,\n26:26 Comment: goals have been shared around again.\n26:29 Comment: Never in football, ignore the lessons of history.\n26:34 Comment: Stoke City have never won in the top division at Anfield,\n26:37 Comment: have only scored three goals here in the league in the last 40 years,\n26:41 Comment: in matches that have finished 5-1 against them.\n26:45 Comment: That was in 1983, 4-1 against them earlier this year,\n26:49 Comment: and now it's 4-1 today, having taken the lead.\n26:53 Comment: And it might not all be over in that respect,\n26:56 Comment: as Grant comes out.\n26:59 Comment: What a connection with Stoke, of course, his uncle Simon\n27:2 Comment: had a spell, footballing family, the Sturridges.\n27:10 Comment: Still had a bit of work to do, didn't he?\n27:12 Comment: It was nice the way he just...\n27:14 Comment: He makes those sort of things look easy.\n27:16 Comment: Doesn't he just? Yeah, that's what I was going to say,\n27:18 Comment: get the footwork right.\n27:20 Comment: With some players, you wouldn't be saying,\n27:22 Comment: as soon as he got the ball it would be a goal,\n27:24 Comment: but with Daniel...\n27:29 Comment: FULL-TIME WHISTLE\n27:39 Comment: Camino.\n27:49 Comment: Sturridge.\n27:54 Comment: And look out for Moore.\n27:59 Comment: Flipping to make it awkward for Glenn Johnson.\n28:3 Comment: Probably watching him from the other side as he was for six years.\n28:10 Comment: Tough part of being a footballer, isn't it?\n28:13 Comment: Suddenly getting a little bit of a lesson from the opposition,\n28:16 Comment: and there's nowhere worse to get it than at Anfield.\n28:22 Comment: Another reason why his journey's been worthwhile.\n28:26 Comment: Sturridge strike.\n28:29 Comment: Almost as soon as he arrives in the game.\n28:35 Comment: Henderson.\n28:37 Comment: And of course, Lovren!\n28:40 Comment: It seemed that if it struck Camino in any other part of his body,\n28:45 Comment: it would have flown into the net.\n28:47 Comment: Great play again, great vision from Henderson\n28:49 Comment: to know what was happening over his shoulder.\n28:51 Comment: Lovely ball across, could have been another one.\n28:54 Comment: Chan.\n28:56 Comment: FULL-TIME WHISTLE\n28:59 Comment: Well, Camino had another touch off him, but...\n29:5 Comment: It was close.\n29:7 Comment: Looks over his shoulder, great ball.\n29:9 Comment: Lovren does really well to get it across,\n29:11 Comment: and it's just a fraction behind him,\n29:13 Comment: hits him up around the hip area.\n29:15 Comment: Very nearly got a second.\n29:18 Comment: Here at Duff.\n29:20 Comment: Duff-Arts allowing the comeback of Ibrahim Afelayi,\n29:23 Comment: he's been out since April.\n29:24 Comment: Out in the home game against Tottenham.\n29:39 Comment: Camino football keeps on coming at this time of the year.\n29:43 Comment: Delighted to bring to you Southampton against Spurs,\n29:46 Comment: 7.30 Sky Sports 1.\n29:49 Comment: Tomorrow.\n29:54 Comment: FULL-TIME WHISTLE\n30:10 Comment: Crouch.\n30:12 Comment: CROWD CHANTING\n30:22 Comment: Good sense of the advantage.\n30:25 Comment: Henderson.\n30:28 Comment: Great judgement of the pass, wonderful ball.\n30:32 Comment: Kline.\n30:37 Comment: Wasn't quite set to slide it down the outside for Mane.\n30:42 Comment: Got to go back to that ball from Jordan Henderson,\n30:45 Comment: found myself clapping there.\n30:48 Comment: Wasn't it terrific?\n30:50 Comment: There was one from Kevin De Bruyne, wasn't it?\n30:52 Comment: Very similar.\n30:53 Comment: The other week.\n31:5 Comment: Well, if you want a reason for Liverpool to press home\n31:8 Comment: their advantage here, some of these players were around\n31:10 Comment: when they lost 6-1 at the Britannia Stadium\n31:15 Comment: 18 months ago.\n31:34 Comment: Time for party tricks.\n31:40 Comment: CHEERING\n31:42 Comment: Even with a bat in hand,\n31:44 Comment: Sobe, Egyptian international.\n31:54 Comment: Walters.\n31:57 Comment: Johnson.\n32:4 Comment: Kissing ground.\n32:6 Comment: Allen.\n32:8 Comment: It's present-day Liverpool very much with the edge over\n32:12 Comment: the ex-Liverpool element of the opposition.\n32:19 Comment: Allen.\n32:25 Comment: Sobe.\n32:27 Comment: Crouch.\n32:28 Comment: Afelay.\n32:30 Comment: Seems to have a crack, and it's not a dead one at all.\n32:33 Comment: Former Barcelona player,\n32:35 Comment: active quality.\n32:37 Comment: Wasn't bad, as you said.\n32:40 Comment: Makes his way out to him, he feints to shoot,\n32:43 Comment: rides that tackle,\n32:45 Comment: he's dipping viciously.\n32:48 Comment: Good effort.\n32:50 Comment: Liverpool making another change.\n32:53 Comment: That will give Salvatore Mourinho the chance to reach\n32:56 Comment: 100 appearances for Liverpool.\n32:58 Comment: He's been out of favour for much of the season.\n33:0 Comment: Merlin Klopp\n33:2 Comment: kept faith with Roberto Firmino despite\n33:6 Comment: him being out and about\n33:8 Comment: in the early hours of Christmas Eve.\n33:13 Comment: The Liverpool response to that\n33:17 Comment: incident with the police,\n33:19 Comment: they're going to let the legal process\n33:22 Comment: take its course and then make a judgement after that.\n33:25 Comment: Firmino justifying the faith kept in him\n33:28 Comment: with that very important goal that put Liverpool in front\n33:31 Comment: just before half-time.\n33:33 Comment: Completely changed the game.\n33:35 Comment: I think they're good at 1-1.\n33:37 Comment: It's different, it's more difficult.\n33:39 Comment: Stoke feel that there's really something in it for them.\n33:41 Comment: At 2-1 Stoke probably felt they missed the bus a little bit\n33:44 Comment: but they were going so well.\n33:48 Comment: It's a bit of a shame that the game is over.\n33:55 Comment: He did say that the first 10 minutes and a half\n33:58 Comment: was scrappy, the third goal\n34:0 Comment: probably killed the contest off.\n34:11 Comment: Roberto Mourinho's playing on the left-hand side\n34:14 Comment: ahead of the left-back who took his place, James Milner.\n34:17 Comment: There's a possibility here of those roles being reversed.\n34:22 Comment: And Fulham's sticking with what's served the back four well.\n34:29 Comment: Just over ten minutes to go.\n34:35 Comment: And it is as it was here in April.\n34:39 Comment: In the last season Liverpool did the Premier League double over Stoke\n34:43 Comment: and went to Wembley at their expense.\n34:46 Comment: And a Capital One Cup, as it was called then.\n34:52 Comment: Lovren.\n34:58 Comment: Clyne.\n35:4 Comment: Sturridge.\n35:11 Comment: Henderson. Milner.\n35:15 Comment: In the long last ten minutes or so this for Stoke City, you feel.\n35:19 Comment: Wijnaldum.\n35:20 Comment: Moreno.\n35:26 Comment: It's tough.\n35:27 Comment: John Walters walking through there. I'm sure he was\n35:30 Comment: dreaming of glory here at Anfield tonight after he'd scored that goal.\n35:35 Comment: They were definitely disjointed for a long period, Liverpool.\n35:40 Comment: They've come on very strong and helped\n35:43 Comment: with some indecisive defending.\n35:46 Comment: That time by Moreno, who did score in that 4-1 win in April.\n35:50 Comment: It's the last Liverpool goal.\n35:54 Comment: Milner.\n35:59 Comment: It can't be too much fun if you are a recognised player in one position\n36:3 Comment: and you lose your top spot to a versatility man.\n36:7 Comment: In some respects, but I mean, James Milner has a couple of league titles already.\n36:11 Comment: He's trying to win one now.\n36:13 Comment: Playing at left back, he's just so dependable.\n36:16 Comment: Apart from Moreno.\n36:22 Comment: Sturridge.\n36:27 Comment: Clyne reclaims it for Liverpool.\n36:30 Comment: They've been defending in their own third.\n36:32 Comment: It's getting very difficult for Stoke City now.\n36:36 Comment: Awareness of mind as well as of body.\n36:43 Comment: Get ready for the long way.\n36:45 Comment: Will for Bonnie.\n36:47 Comment: It's a guy who was a big move to Manchester City a few years ago.\n36:51 Comment: To be really on the up.\n36:53 Comment: Terrific time that Swansea.\n36:55 Comment: Swansea could do with him now.\n36:58 Comment: Funny, you know, move back to Stoke,\n37:1 Comment: if you like, back down a ladder from the top six.\n37:6 Comment: Hasn't worked out.\n37:8 Comment: A ball from Sturridge.\n37:9 Comment: Mane.\n37:13 Comment: Henderson.\n37:14 Comment: Hits Sturridge.\n37:16 Comment: And then comes Moreno.\n37:18 Comment: Throwing himself at it.\n37:21 Comment: Hands on the head for Sturridge.\n37:23 Comment: He smiles.\n37:26 Comment: Carved him open again.\n37:27 Comment: Mane a little bit too far for him, but he holds up.\n37:30 Comment: And just.\n37:32 Comment: Lovely ball back.\n37:33 Comment: Henderson.\n37:35 Comment: And it's a goal.\n37:36 Comment: And just.\n37:38 Comment: Lovely ball back.\n37:39 Comment: Henderson lets fly.\n37:42 Comment: Sturridge.\n37:44 Comment: Couldn't quite get it on target.\n37:46 Comment: And then the block comes in.\n37:48 Comment: A little bit present.\n37:49 Comment: Not settling for four.\n37:51 Comment: It's definitely been a policy.\n37:52 Comment: The short corners for Jürgen Klopp.\n37:54 Comment: Another variety here.\n37:55 Comment: One that wasn't quite rehearsed.\n37:58 Comment: Here comes Wolters.\n38:1 Comment: Getting back by Henderson.\n38:2 Comment: Not once but twice.\n38:4 Comment: Generous round of applause.\n38:6 Comment: For the young team faithful.\n38:7 Comment: For Jürgen Henderson.\n38:8 Comment: For sure, yeah.\n38:10 Comment: And to.\n38:12 Comment: Just captain Liverpool.\n38:13 Comment: That captain.\n38:15 Comment: England went wide.\n38:16 Comment: And he's not required.\n38:19 Comment: They're generous.\n38:21 Comment: For the former players here.\n38:23 Comment: For Liverpool folk.\n38:25 Comment: And again.\n38:26 Comment: Poul de Kertsch a rousing ovation.\n38:28 Comment: As he gives way to Wilfried Bonnick.\n38:30 Comment: I don't know.\n38:32 Comment: How much more we'll see of Peter Crouch.\n38:33 Comment: But it's been a pleasure.\n38:34 Comment: Not just.\n38:35 Comment: Watching him play the game.\n38:36 Comment: The way he's played the game.\n38:37 Comment: Smiling his face throughout his career.\n38:40 Comment: Fondly remembered here.\n38:41 Comment: Many grounds.\n38:43 Comment: In England.\n38:44 Comment: Still a bit of life in him.\n38:45 Comment: He did alright.\n38:46 Comment: You know.\n38:47 Comment: Early on he was a real handful.\n39:1 Comment: So be.\n39:3 Comment: And.\n39:5 Comment: Calling.\n39:6 Comment: Claverne out of the way.\n39:11 Comment: Goal conceded.\n39:14 Comment: Now almost an irrelevant statistic.\n39:16 Comment: Seems like it was from a different game almost doesn't it?\n39:19 Comment: Well put.\n39:24 Comment: Johnson.\n39:25 Comment: To.\n39:27 Comment: North of that right back position now.\n39:29 Comment: A different game in the sense of changing their tactics.\n39:31 Comment: Really forced upon them.\n39:47 Comment: Walters.\n39:56 Comment: Johnson.\n39:57 Comment: Roberto Moreno.\n40:11 Comment: Well they tried something different.\n40:12 Comment: Stoke.\n40:15 Comment: Liverpool were set a bit of a.\n40:17 Comment: Puzzle here.\n40:20 Comment: Extra bank holiday.\n40:22 Comment: And.\n40:23 Comment: They've solved it.\n40:26 Comment: Took them to the brink of half time.\n40:29 Comment: To really feel good about themselves today.\n40:33 Comment: A little bit of a stroll since then.\n40:54 Comment: In

    "summary": "Liverpool asserted their dominance in a thrilling 4-1 victory over Stoke City, maintaining their offensive prowess and closing the gap with league leaders Chelsea. The atmosphere at Anfield was electric, as the home side sought to make a statement after an eight-day rest period. Despite the festive season and looming congested fixtures, Liverpool entered the match with renewed vigor and intent to entertain their fans with a commanding display of football.\n\nThe match began under early evening skies in the north-west, a festive buzz in the air without any immediate signs of fatigue from either side. Stoke, last having played ten days prior, matched Liverpool's energy as the game commenced.\n\nFrom the outset, Liverpool tried to set the tempo. They have been a spectacle in the Premier League, known for their relentless attacking play and blinding pace. Chasing an eight-day rest, they reciprocated brilliantly. The co-action between Adam Lallana and Jordan Henderson was fluid, while Ragnar Klavan showed his mettle as he comfortably filled in for the injured Joel Matip, having regained his place for the last two games after initially losing it post his first Premier League starts.\n\nStoke, historically unsuccessful at Anfield in the top-flight, put their best foot forward. Mark Hughes, despite his impressive managerial tenure, had not tasted victory here either. The early minutes bore witness to typical Liverpool aggression, pressing high and retaining much possession. Contributions from the likes of Naturism and Origi, coupled with defensive duties well-executed by Mignolet, kept Stoke at bay initially.\n\nBoth sides began to carve out opportunities. It's noteworthy that Stoke had their game plan tailored to counter the rapid Liverpool forwards, aiming to stretch plays out wide and leveraging their strengths in aerial duels. Peter Crouch, a familiar face at Anfield, was instrumental up front, aiding Walters, who found some liberty in the attacking third.\n\nHowever, it was Stoke who drew first blood. In the 12th minute, Jonathan Walters scored to shock the Anfield crowd. Walters, leveraging a brilliant cross from Eric Peters, outpaced his marker, Lovren, to head the ball goalwards. Despite Mignolet getting a hand to it, the ball ended up in the net, giving Stoke an unexpected lead. Historical context added weight to this goal, as Stoke had managed only two goals at Anfield over the past four decades, making this a momentous occasion. The goal resulted from a typical early cross that caught both the Liverpool defense and Mignolet by surprise.\n\nLiverpool's initial response to the goal was not immediate, as Stoke pressed for more, with Joe Allen and Crouch causing persistent problems for the Reds' backline. Nevertheless, Liverpool's tenacity saw them claw back into the game. As the first half progressed, the Reds began to settle, dictating play more assertively and pressing Stoke back into their own half.\n\nThe equalizer came in the 35th minute. Adam Lallana, one of Liverpool's most consistent performers in recent weeks, capitalized on a defensive miscue from Glenn Johnson. Origi's impressive hold-up play set Mane free on the right. Mane’s accurate cross was dabbled with by Johnson, who fumbled, allowing Lallana to slot the ball home from a tight angle. The goal rejuvenated the Anfield faithful, and the hosts began to tighten their grip on the game.\n\nBefore the break, Liverpool took the lead. Roberto Firmino, who had hogged the limelight for non-footballing reasons over the weekend, made news for all the right reasons with a superbly taken goal in the 44th minute. After intricate interplay involving Firmino, Mane, and Lallana, a close-range shot from Firmino found the back of the net, hitting both posts before nestling into the goal. This turnaround sent Liverpool into halftime leading 2-1, an invigorating conclusion to an otherwise challenging first half.\n\nReturning from the break with a spring in their step, Liverpool continued their aggressive approach. Stoke, meanwhile, attempted to regain their composure and reestablish the foothold they initially had in the game. Notably, early exchanges in the second half saw both sides tussle for control, but it was Liverpool who had the cutting edge.\n\nLiverpool’s relentless pursuit of an insurance goal bore fruit in the 54th minute. A poor header from Stoke’s defense presented Jordan Henderson with possession. His deft pass found Divock Origi, whose cross forced Giannelli Imbula into an unfortunate own goal while trying to intercept Mane. This fortuitous turn of events propelled Liverpool to a 3-1 lead, decisively tilting the match in their favor.\n\nStoke, visibly deflated by the third goal, struggled to rekindle their bright start. Tactical adjustments and substitutions by Mark Hughes aimed to bring fresh legs and creativity into the fold, but Liverpool's defensive discipline and control of the midfield ensured the visitors could not easily carve openings.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin for Stoke came in the 70th minute, courtesy of a defensive lapse from captain Ryan Shawcross. With Daniel Sturridge lurking, Shawcross's back-pass lacked the required direction and pace, allowing Sturridge to intercept, round Lee Grant, and tap into an empty net. This goal marked 100 Premier League goals under Jürgen Klopp and illustrated the clinical finishing when presented with opportunities, leaving Stoke rueing their defensive frailties.\n\nFrom thereon, it was a matter of game management. Liverpool's game intelligence shone as they shifted gears, retaining possession, and probing selectively. Although Stoke demonstrated their fighting spirit, attempting to claw something back, it was clear the fixture had slipped beyond their grasp. Substitute Sobhi and a fleeting appearance by Ibrahim Afellay could not alter the course of events, despite some moments of individual brilliance.\n\nLiverpool continued to dominate possession, crafting further opportunities. James Milner, Nathaniel Clyne, and Georginio Wijnaldum led the final charges, nearly adding to the scoreline. As the match drew towards a conclusion, Liverpool supporters began their celebrations, savoring a prominent victory.\n\nThe game ended 4-1, with Liverpool’s resilience and attacking flair overcoming Stoke's early grit. This win bolstered their title aspirations, keeping them within reach of Chelsea, ensuring their festive period began on a triumphant note. Their ability to share goals amongst key players, with a remarkable defensive climate contributing significantly, was particularly noteworthy.\n\nHughes's men, despite their promising start, left to reflect on missed opportunities and defensive mishaps, masking the competent tactical framework initially set up. For Liverpool, the journey continues with an eye on sustaining this momentum and fortifying their defense. The prospect of facing Manchester City next looms, while Stoke grapples with an arduous task against league leaders Chelsea.\n\nThe evening encapsulated the unpredictable spirit of Premier League football, where early setbacks can turn into emphatic victories, a testament to Liverpool’s unyielding drive and tactical astuteness under Klopp's guidance. As Jurgen Klopp's team reaped the rewards of their hard-earned victory, the Anfield faithful looked forward to further riveting encounters in the league campaign."
