I'm not sure he was expecting that either.\n10:11 Comment: The deflection back up there at Lovren.\n10:15 Comment: One or two misplays past this. Mignolet being the latest for Liverpool players.\n10:29 Comment: I'm sure it eases after that loose touch from Idrissa Gueye.\n10:35 Comment: It was good at Middlesbrough, wasn't it?\n10:38 Comment: Pulled off one or two tidy saves.\n10:45 Comment: The fact that that man is out of favour has enabled Mignolet at least to keep up his record\n10:50 Comment: of having started every derby since he joined the club.\n10:53 Comment: And he's not been on the losing side in any of them.\n11:3 Comment: Here's Valencia.\n11:4 Comment: And a touch from Roberto Firmino.\n11:9 Comment: Which Mark Dean has punished with the award in the pre-kick.\n11:12 Comment: And things just getting a little spiky.\n11:14 Comment: Yeah, just need to calm down Firmino.\n11:16 Comment: But Liverpool have got caught more than you'd expect in these opening stages.\n11:24 Comment: Everton just a bit hungrier.\n11:26 Comment: And then he stepped across and there's no doubt it's a foul.\n11:30 Comment: It's a good position.\n11:42 Comment: Well, En-Valencia, who's not only not scored for Everton,\n11:45 Comment: but hasn't scored a club goal at all since last January,\n11:50 Comment: senses a problem.\n11:52 Comment: But it's not a problem.\n11:54 Comment: And then, of course, the referee senses a possibility of at least giving Mignolet a test from this.\n11:59 Comment: But Baines is there too.\n12:1 Comment: Yeah, whether he's kidding or not, you'd be surprised if Valencia did take it on him.\n12:5 Comment: He can't be feeling all that confident.\n12:9 Comment: Given that record.

Little tussle with McCarthy.\n14:14 Comment: Here's Lovren.\n14:17 Comment: Mane.\n14:19 Comment: Now Lovren.\n14:32 Comment: Got a long ball.\n14:34 Comment: And a poor one as well.\n14:38 Comment: Henderson.\n14:42 Comment: Trying to play an Owege who is coming in from the left having Firmino go central.\n14:47 Comment: Lovren's header.\n14:49 Comment: I think he was coming back from an offside position so couldn't get involved.\n15:2 Comment: Williams.\n15:5 Comment: Lukaku.\n15:8 Comment: A little lucky court.\n15:9 Comment: Almost.\n15:11 Comment: Henderson.\n15:12 Comment: Touchdown Firmino.\n15:13 Comment: Gave Lukaku his chance.\n15:14 Comment: A lot of power from Firmino for the throw.\n15:15 Comment: And here's the final.\n15:16 Comment: That's not a foul.\n15:17 Comment: That's a foul.\n15:19 Comment: Mane.\n15:20 Comment: Lots of pressure.\n15:21 Comment: He's coming back.\n15:22 Comment: With the ball.\n15:23 Comment: Goal.\n15:26 Comment: Mane.\n15:27 Comment:

choice in the end\n16:8 Comment: but it was a better passage of play for Liverpool\n16:11 Comment: at least they've kept it in Everton's half\n16:14 Comment: it's been difficult for them to find a passing rhythm so far\n16:18 Comment: been hustled out of it\n16:19 Comment: it's a passing rhythm that Jurgen Klopp's side found\n16:24 Comment: spectacularly at Middlesbrough\n16:27 Comment: in their last match\n16:29 Comment: Everton making life uncomfortable\n16:36 Comment: for them here though\n16:38 Comment: in the opening quarter\n16:38 Comment: of an hour\n16:39 Comment: yeah Lukaku up against Red Mill Clavings\n16:41 Comment: winning most of those duels\n16:43 Comment: whether it's flicking it on or\n16:44 Comment: holding it up\n16:45 Comment: backing into him\n16:49 Comment:

found himself in this kind of space\n17:15 Comment: he's been able to advance without any pressure\n17:18 Comment: he's had a really good time\n17:22 Comment: to bring it under control\n17:24 Comment: Mané\n17:40 Comment: Somewhere in the rear is Lovren\n17:40 Comment: Santé\n17:41 Comment: Somewhere in the rear is Sau Music\n18:5 Comment: Cleven meets it.\n18:11 Comment: Who does more?\n18:18 Comment: It's the kind of start that this Goodison Park crowd would have wanted to see.\n18:22 Comment: Everton largely on top looking the more threatening team.\n18:27 Comment: Again Cleven just waving a leg at it initially.\n18:30 Comment: And it came with a comeback but Ronald Koeman needed that win against Arsenal to get the fans back onside here.\n18:41 Comment: One or two doubts had started to be expressed.\n18:46 Comment: But if he can follow up with a win over their local rivals it will set up a very happy festive period for the blue half of Merseyside.\n18:57 Comment: And it's been very sharp so far.\n19:31 Comment: Just having to try and dig in here at Liverpool.\n19:44 Comment: It's Coleman's cross.\n19:50 Comment: About base.\n19:52 Comment: Lennon.\n19:55 Comment: Go.\n19:57 Comment: Coleman down the line to Valencia.\n20:11 Comment: Left and Reina behind.\n20:13 Comment: But between them, Van Rijden and Henderson ease the danger.\n20:16 Comment: Just did a bit

your superiority\n24:17 Comment: make sure you do get a goal\n24:19 Comment: as you think at some stage Liverpool are going to put it together\n24:27 Comment: become more of a threat\n24:29 Comment: perhaps more of a reliance on one person\n24:35 Comment: Romelu Lukaku in the Everton front line\n24:37 Comment: and the rest throughout the whole Liverpool team\n24:40 Comment: where their three

dealing with it and finding Ragnar Klavan\n34:32 Comment: Lallana\n34:35 Comment: Firmino\n34:38 Comment: Mount Henderson, this is better build up for Liverpool\n34:42 Comment: checked in the end by Baines\n34:48 Comment: bringing Firmino into the middle\n34:50 Comment: Origi over on the left at the moment\n34:52 Comment: slightly more encouraging for Liverpool that they do seem to be rediscovering their rhythm\n35:1 Comment: here's Henderson\n35:3 Comment: now Lovren\n35:11 Comment: Lallana\n35:13 Comment: Klavan\n35:20 Comment: Wijnaldum, Milner\n35:22 Comment: Lovren\n35:41 Comment: Henderson\n35:44 Comment: switched by Lallana but Coleman had read it\n35:47 Comment: and here's Lukaku\n35:49 Comment: Coleman\n35:50 Comment: here on his own\n35:52 Comment: Ferns Valencia\n35:53 Comment: Coleman's carried on his run here\n35:54 Comment: stays out wide he'll need options in the middle\n35:57 Comment: off Henderson was it his arm?\n35:59 Comment: if it was the referee didn't feel it was with any kind of intent\n36:2 Comment: yeah, I mean it was his arm but\n36:5 Comment: it was fairly low down by his side, he was close to Coleman\n36:12 Comment: here's Firmino\n36:17 Comment: Milner\n36:18 Comment: Mane\n36:19 Comment: lets it run wisely, Rinaldo's got Klein over, Origi!\n36:28 Comment: Well they really did withdraw there Everton, that's been a feature the last ten minutes,\n36:33 Comment: inviting on Liverpool for the first time, Arnolfano Klein, got acres here, I think it's\n36:40 Comment: just behind Origi, can't dig it out.\n36:48 Comment: More and more threatening though, the visitors.\n36:56 Comment: Comes up off his side onto his arm, so couldn't do anything about it, Henderson.\n37:4 Comment: Worth an appeal though, always is.\n37:10 Comment: Coleman, Henderson, Coleman and Lallana.\n37:19 Comment: There's a little bit of that anguish between the two after the Premier League challenge\n37:22 Comment: and McCarthy's now got involved as well.\n37:28 Comment: It was the first coming together between them that's caused the problem here between\n37:31 Comment: Seamus Coleman and Adam Lallana.\n37:40 Comment: I bet they've got the fewest bookings, Liverpool, in the Premier League.\n37:48 Comment: I don't know if there's something you can conclude from that.\n37:52 Comment: He's not the dirtiest of players, is he, Adam Lallana?\n37:57 Comment: I don't know how it translates to how they've been doing in the league this season, it hasn't\n38:1 Comment: done them too badly.\n38:7 Comment: Still just the two defeats this season, again, still Bournemouth.\n38:10 Comment: And Burnley, although worryingly poor Liverpool, both of those were when Joel Matip was absent.\n38:16 Comment: Into Autolikaku.\n38:21 Comment: Mignolet taking a quick kick, which might not turn out to be the wisest of decisions.\n38:26 Comment: Good point there, what he was trying to do in terms of striking it there.\n38:31 Comment: A strange one.\n38:40 Comment: James McCarthy is the player who's experiencing a problem.\n38:47 Comment: He seems to be reaching down towards the hamstring area.\n38:54 Comment: Yeah, I'm not sure whether it was contact, it might have been a dead leg, I don't know,\n38:57 Comment: he's holding the time.\n39:2 Comment: He's had his injury issues anyway this season, James McCarthy, so it's taken him a while\n39:6 Comment: to be trusted by Ronald Koeman.\n39:10 Comment: Closer inside, Jam traded away by a quicker\n39:31 Comment: seal and dread contender Angus Mc mole with the ball coming at departmental goal.\n39:36 Comment: Very clear set-up there by Jam.\n39:38 Comment: Great.\n39:39 Comment: Yeah, more to do with the stretch, you think?\n39:47 Comment: We'll be seeing both these teams live in action on Sky Sports\n39:50 Comment: over the busy Christmas period.\n39:52 Comment: Liverpool against Stoke is live on Sky Sports 1\n39:55 Comment: from 5 o'clock on December 27th in eight days' time.\n40:1 Comment: And on the 30th of December,\n40:3 Comment: our Friday night football sees Everton in action at Hull.\n40:6 Comment: That's on Sky Sports 1 from 7 o'clock.\n40:17 Comment: They do have Gareth Barry up their sleeves if necessary.\n40:26 Comment: But for now, McCarthy is going to continue.\n40:36 Comment: Look after it.\n40:48 Comment: Firmino.\n40:51 Comment: Wijnaldum.\n40:56 Comment: Clive.\n41:3 Comment: And here's Henderson.\n41:6 Comment: Milner.\n41:14 Comment: Henderson.\n41:20 Comment: Lovren.\n41:26 Comment: Now Lallana.\n41:27 Comment: Lallana.\n41:33 Comment: What's that?\n41:36 Comment: That's a disappointing misjudgment at the end of what had been promising build-up.\n41:41 Comment: Yeah.\n41:42 Comment: But the game just lost a little bit of its rhythm with the stoppage.\n41:47 Comment: Crowd gone a bit flat.\n41:52 Comment: We'd be expecting much better, demanding much better second half.\n42:1 Comment: Martin Stecklenburg let in six goals the last time he appeared against Liverpool.\n42:6 Comment: He's got a lot of time.\n42:6 Comment: A League Cup loss with Southampton last season.\n42:12 Comment: It hasn't been overworked so far tonight.\n42:18 Comment: Okay.\n42:20 Comment: Now Lukaku.\n42:23 Comment: This is Valencia.\n42:28 Comment: A break of fortune.\n42:29 Comment: And the corner was able to rescue it again for Ene Valencia.\n42:32 Comment: Yeah.\n42:35 Comment: Everton win a corner.\n43:13 Comment: It was a closed-balling shot.\n43:14 Comment: Everton win a goal for the third� không.\n43:19 Comment: A productive goal.\n43:19 Comment: a jogo de пуente.\n43:21 Comment: A time to look back and to see if it were possible,\n43:24 Comment: which is just as spectacular as it was for the first time in a manager of our entire clubspeedhor arose.\n43:30 Comment: a percentage for Abel EN contents as we got a flags fish\n43:32 Comment: almost landing and going grounding again.\n43:33 Comment: 정말 como gente pel yum bef gallon de rod orец Epic Un barley be is better for him.\n43:35 Comment: It is very important to give this kind of a approach.\n43:36 Comment: Here's Coleman.\n43:51 Comment: Here's Barkley.\n44:6 Comment: Barkley helping it on to Valencia.\n44:20 Comment: Blocked from Firmino.\n44:22 Comment: He picks out Divock Origi.\n44:24 Comment: Williams had stumbled.\n44:30 Comment: Barkley who's coming right back hard as Divock Origi.\n44:34 Comment: He rolls away from the challenge.\n44:36 Comment: And...\n44:37 Comment: Mike Donovan's got him a free kick.\n44:39 Comment: Yeah, well, Barkley just trying to knock the ball from under his man.\n44:44 Comment: I mean, he won the challenge.\n44:49 Comment: Don't give a thing, Sean.\n44:50 Comment: I think I know.\n44:53 Comment: I think you do.\n44:58 Comment: Just there.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: to resume against the division's leading scorers\n0:6 Comment: but defensively Liverpool have conceded as many goals as Everton have this season\n0:16 Comment: so he'll be hoping that Romelu Lukaku in particular can exploit that in what\n0:21 Comment: remains of this fixture. I think both managers will be looking for a bit more\n0:28 Comment: quality, Liverpool in particular because we know they're capable of much more\n0:34 Comment: when they get the ball going forward\n0:47 Comment: Nuno's throw I don't think actually came into play so he'll get another opportunity to take it\n0:58 Comment: back to him from Henderson, Firmino now Lallana\n1:9 Comment: there's touch from Mane to Roberto Firmino, here's Origi\n1:16 Comment: it's beyond the reach of Wijnaldum and away by Valencia but Barkley couldn't take it in his stride\n1:21 Comment: Lallana, here's Clyne, Mane\n1:28 Comment: Wijnaldum, here's Milner\n1:35 Comment: Nuno tried to roll it into the path of Wijnaldum but it's Idrissa Gueye who emerges with it\n1:43 Comment: here's Lukaku who is up there on his own\n1:47 Comment: Mane, Lallana...\n1:49 Comment: Lallana...\n1:51 Comment: Mane, Lallana...\n1:53 Comment: Lallana...\n1:55 Comment: Mane, Lallana...\n1:57 Comment: Lallana.\n2:1 Comment: Here's Origi.\n2:11 Comment: Back from Lallana to Jordan Henderson.\n2:14 Comment: Now Clannagh.\n2:18 Comment: Milner.\n2:23 Comment: Firmino.\n2:27 Comment: Clavan.\n2:31 Comment: Now Mane.\n2:34 Comment: It's patient again from Liverpool.\n2:36 Comment: They're looking for that killer ball from Milner.\n2:39 Comment: But it's beyond Divock Origi.\n2:41 Comment: Head of clear is by Baines.\n2:44 Comment: Yeah, it's Liverpool being the more purposeful at the beginning of this half.\n2:53 Comment: Something that Everton would have expected.\n2:57 Comment: Liverpool finishing the first pretty well and better.\n3:3 Comment: The first corner of the second half is Liverpool's first of the match.\n3:13 Comment: Henderson's kick.\n3:17 Comment: Back in by Wijnaldum.\n3:20 Comment: And away by Funes Mori.\n3:22 Comment: Lallana.\n3:24 Comment: Wijnaldum.\n3:27 Comment: It's a good start for Liverpool.\n3:31 Comment: Origi looking to bully his way past Coleman.\n3:35 Comment: Everton felt it carried over the line.\n3:37 Comment: But I don't know officials' view happens.\n3:44 Comment: Here's Lovren.\n3:48 Comment: Clavan.\n3:49 Comment: Goodison.\n3:50 Comment: Goodison Park doing the best to rally their players to start this second half.\n3:54 Comment: Goodison.\n3:57 Comment: There will be a concern that for all the pressure they had in that opening half-hour,\n4:0 Comment: they didn't make the breakthrough against Simon Mignolet.\n4:6 Comment: And there could be a price to be paid for it against a team that have been free-scoring in the Premier League this season.\n4:16 Comment: It's in games like this where you would want Philippe Coutinho to be available, no doubt about that.\n4:22 Comment: And then there's ball curled round and Firmino's got past his man!\n4:26 Comment: And he'll get a second bite!\n4:29 Comment: Klein!\n4:31 Comment: And still had enough bodies in the way.\n4:35 Comment: Here's Henderson.\n4:38 Comment: And Fines Mori gets it away, but that was more about survival than anything then for Everton.\n4:47 Comment: Lovren.\n4:50 Comment: And he opens up here.\n4:52 Comment: And it's a look for Firmino.\n4:56 Comment: It's a nice one through for Origi, but it's Milner instead.\n5:2 Comment: Fines Mori away, not necessarily in the direction he wanted it to go, but it's a corner.\n5:7 Comment: Well, it was actually Fines Mori who turned a situation that should have been dealt with fairly comfortably.\n5:15 Comment: The way he gets barged off the ball here.\n5:18 Comment: Too weak from the defender.\n5:22 Comment: It was a big gap through the middle of that Everton defence.\n5:31 Comment: Milner's corner.\n5:33 Comment: And it took Makaku to deal with it.\n5:36 Comment: Here's Henderson.\n5:39 Comment: It's been a much better start to the second half than it was to the first from Liverpool.\n5:44 Comment: And here's Klein.\n5:48 Comment: Mane's header on.\n5:52 Comment: Stecklenburg will have to spread himself to deny Roberto Firmino.\n5:57 Comment: They did well.\n5:59 Comment: Firmino just trying to lift it over him.\n6:11 Comment: Nolana.\n6:14 Comment: Henderson.\n6:15 Comment: Now Milner.\n6:16 Comment: Milner.\n6:20 Comment: Mane.\n6:22 Comment: I think they'll be advantage.\n6:25 Comment: Firmino.\n6:26 Comment: Now Wijnaldum.\n6:28 Comment: Just got a toe to it.\n6:29 Comment: Lovren on the scene before Baines.\n6:31 Comment: Now Wijnaldum.\n6:34 Comment: Klein with the ball in.\n6:36 Comment: Fides Mori was behind it.\n6:40 Comment: Lovren takes it away from Lukaku.\n6:43 Comment: Klein.\n6:44 Comment: Liverpool confidence growing here.\n6:49 Comment: Clavin.\n6:52 Comment: Milner.\n7:3 Comment: Now Origi.\n7:10 Comment: And Milner wins the tackle and finds Firmino.\n7:15 Comment: And in the end it's Gueye who wins it crucially for Everton.\n7:18 Comment: Well, for Valencia to try that in such a dangerous area.\n7:22 Comment: It's manager of the furious.\n7:26 Comment: Just trying a little sidestep.\n7:28 Comment: So careless.\n7:36 Comment: Any idea could have ended up much worse for Everton that.\n7:43 Comment: An unnecessary chance taken by the unknown West Ham man.\n7:49 Comment: Which will not have helped Ronald Koeman's move.\n7:52 Comment: Escaping.\n8:12 Comment: Lovren to absent makes a first.\n8:15 Comment: Yeah, difficult one because they about just lost his harrow into touch.\n8:18 Comment: That's just as to where the goal was.\n8:20 Comment: He probably wouldn't have thought that.\n8:22 Comment: Mignolet would be coming towards him trying to lob it over\n8:41 Comment: Henderson\n8:45 Comment: I'm sure Klopp had some words to say at half-time he must have got into his players and\n8:49 Comment: seen the results early on here\n9:1 Comment: Lallana, Henderson\n9:5 Comment: Milner\n9:8 Comment: casual against Valencia\n9:14 Comment: Valencia has overrun it\n9:19 Comment: Alain, Alain\n9:34 Comment: Barry\n9:34 Comment: Milner\n9:36 Comment: Alain\n9:38 Comment: here's Di Bocca Regi\n9:42 Comment: Firmino\n9:49 Comment: and Lallana tried to ease it into the path of James Milner\n9:53 Comment: here's Lukaku\n9:55 Comment: kicked by Dejan Lovren\n9:59 Comment: Dejan Lovren knew exactly what Lukaku was going to try and do\n10:4 Comment: just tap it round the corner\n10:5 Comment: tries to make it look as subtle as possible\n10:13 Comment: didn't really fancy a chase round the corner\n10:42 Comment: here's Colby\n10:43 Comment: Williams\n10:50 Comment: Lukaku helps it on to Barkley\n10:54 Comment: tried to slip in Valencia\n10:57 Comment: a way to safety by Milner\n11:1 Comment: and here's Funes Mori\n11:10 Comment: Far too much to do\n11:12 Comment: here's Mori\n11:43 Comment: Henderson holding off Barkley\n11:47 Comment: and finding Lovren\n11:49 Comment: Mane\n11:53 Comment: Firmino hopping it back through towards Mane\n11:59 Comment: and Baines\n12:0 Comment: and his goalkeeper having to decide between them\n12:3 Comment: who should deal with that\n12:5 Comment: and in their determination to get to it\n12:7 Comment: both are hurt\n12:8 Comment: yeah Baines looked like he was\n12:10 Comment: easily favourite here\n12:12 Comment: but Mane's pace\n12:13 Comment: gets him into an area that causes real problems\n12:16 Comment: kick comes off Mane\n12:18 Comment: last\n12:19 Comment: he really does switch on\n12:22 Comment: the afterburners here\n12:23 Comment: struck in the end by Baines\n12:33 Comment: against the onrushing Mane\n12:36 Comment: but Stecklenburg is the player who's\n12:39 Comment: come off worst\n12:40 Comment: from the show of the day\n12:43 Comment: and look challenger should be brought over\n12:45 Comment: from想\n13:4 Comment: it's the sweeps\n13:6 Comment: he's going to be late\n13:7 Comment: it's going to make Stett then\n13:8 Comment: Gallo get up\n13:9 Comment: Stett still has another dog on wheel\n13:13 Comment: knee on the thigh which can be really painful\n13:20 Comment: Baines momentum just made it\n13:23 Comment: perhaps unavoidable\n13:28 Comment: cold water being applied\n13:30 Comment: and Joel Robles warming up just in case\n13:36 Comment: he has been used this season Robles\n13:40 Comment: Stettenberg missed the West Ham match\n13:43 Comment: which was actually the last time that Everton kept a clean sheet in the Premier League\n13:48 Comment: with a 2-0 victory here\n13:51 Comment: it's a worry, he'll just want to keep moving Stettenberg\n13:54 Comment: make sure it doesn't really stiffen up\n13:57 Comment: difficult one for a key publicist, you're not naturally on the move\n14:10 Comment: signs aren't good here\n14:13 Comment: they're wanting a little more time at least\n14:18 Comment: to assess the goalkeeper's condition\n14:21 Comment: Ashley Williams of course concerned\n14:23 Comment: Everton were already in the process of planning a field change\n14:38 Comment: what a victory for Everton\n14:40 Comment: they've got to make a decision here haven't they\n14:42 Comment: they can't hobble about for five minutes\n14:51 Comment: thank you Liverpool\n14:52 Comment: they want to stick it under the crossbar as quickly as possible if he's going to stay on\n15:1 Comment: there's a man in sudden discomfort\n15:3 Comment: so a ball into that area behind the defence for the likes of\n15:8 Comment: Mane or Origi\n15:9 Comment: to move onto or Firmino could be very interesting\n15:12 Comment: well I don't know why you'd take the chance with a keeper fit one ready to come up\n15:22 Comment: and there's Mane just keeping that area protected for now by keeping Liverpool in the wide area\n15:32 Comment: Stoneman in pain\n15:50 Comment: Stoneman his בש\n16:5 Comment: Stoneman his fim\n16:7 Comment: and Roman Cuban\n16:8 Comment: Lujan in pain\n16:9 Comment: want to use up all of his substitutions too early\n16:14 Comment: poor touch from Firmino at a time where Liverpool would really want to exert some pressure on the stricken goalkeeper\n16:21 Comment: yeah I mean they must understand the situation\n16:27 Comment: just change the game a touch and lob one towards him get pressure on him\n16:39 Comment: doesn't look as though he's able to soldier on Steffenberg and so Everton bowing to the inevitable\n16:48 Comment: Joel Robles who kept a clean sheet in his only home appearance against Liverpool\n16:53 Comment: a goalless draw here a couple of seasons are back\n16:57 Comment: he was the goalkeeper who shipped four at Anfield back in April\n17:4 Comment: good job I can't hear you I'm sure\n17:9 Comment: he doesn't want to come off\n17:16 Comment: maybe one of those where the decision has to be taken out of his hands\n17:26 Comment: it's a long walk that's the thing like Dean saying perhaps a stretcher might be a good shout\n17:35 Comment: well it is the end of the evening for Martin Steffenberg\n17:40 Comment: who is thought to troops that were contratting to reforms\n17:42 Comment: and Greg Field in particular\n17:58 Comment: Marco Silva\n17:59 Comment: I think it will, Everton a little bit, Liverpool looking the more dangerous, looking more lively.\n18:9 Comment: A chance for Everton to maybe change the momentum.\n18:21 Comment: So Joe Robles comes on for only his second Premier League appearance of the season.\n18:26 Comment: The former Spanish U21 goalkeeper who followed Roberto Martinez here from Wigan.\n18:40 Comment: Lallana, here's Origi.\n18:44 Comment: That's Parry, now Lovren.\n18:49 Comment: Firmino.\n18:53 Comment: Chester Willard back from Barkley, far down, goes in for the goal.\n18:57 Comment: A little bit of a challenge.\n18:59 Comment: A hint of two feet going at the same time, but no harm came of it.\n19:22 Comment: So here's Henderson with the free kick.\n19:27 Comment: Clever.\n19:28 Comment: Henderson.\n19:31 Comment: Now Lallana.\n19:37 Comment: Here's Origi, two up to his right.\n19:41 Comment: I saw that by Williams.\n19:43 Comment: I thought he could have slipped it through to Firmino, but he made a good one.\n19:48 Comment: Valencia.\n19:50 Comment: Williams back here against Jordan Henderson, who comes back for more.\n19:54 Comment: Devon Bel linear for the second to Pogba.\n19:55 Comment: مت.\n19:56 Comment: Antoine Logan.\n19:57 Comment: lé Rochem позвол,\n20:16 Comment: Kevin sahib's shoot out.\n20:49 Comment: APPLAUSE\n21:3 Comment: Quite been able to pick it up in this second half so far, Everton.\n21:19 Comment: It's been as Mori.\n21:23 Comment: Barry.\n21:27 Comment: Pop the lens here.\n21:29 Comment: Springs up to Sadio Mane who finds Wijnaldum.\n21:31 Comment: Now Origi.\n21:35 Comment: Wijnaldum forced away from danger.\n21:39 Comment: Here's Divock Origi.\n21:47 Comment: Wijnaldum.\n21:50 Comment: Now Henderson.\n21:52 Comment: Ooh, that was late.\n21:54 Comment: Ross Barkley.\n21:58 Comment: Lovren, who himself has been booked,\n22:2 Comment: would be best advised to stay away.\n22:4 Comment: Barkley becomes the second player booked tonight.\n22:7 Comment: And now one or two others getting involved.\n22:9 Comment: Lovren, who's on a yellow card himself,\n22:14 Comment: shouldn't really have got involved, did.\n22:17 Comment: And then Everton players,\n22:19 Comment: who are happy about his willingness to try and get Barkley into further trouble.\n22:24 Comment: Yeah, I mean, the derby hasn't had too many incidences like this at all.\n22:30 Comment: Henderson's not the type to play an injury here.\n22:34 Comment: I think he did catch him.\n22:44 Comment: He's just taking the linesman's version of events.\n22:47 Comment: Simon Long telling Mike Dean,\n22:49 Comment: exactly what he did see.\n22:51 Comment: Oh.\n22:55 Comment: Seamus Coleman is making a long walk over towards the referee.\n23:3 Comment: And he is showing a yellow card.\n23:7 Comment: Gareth Barry has having it explained to him.\n23:9 Comment: Coleman argues his case,\n23:11 Comment: but Ashley Williams wisely steering him away from talking himself into further trouble.\n23:17 Comment: Mmm, well.\n23:18 Comment: It's always difficult when you get those kind of mellies to see exactly who's done what.\n23:24 Comment: Coleman feel,\n23:26 Comment: feeling here with Sindh against as well.\n23:32 Comment: Oh, nasty one that.\n23:36 Comment: It really is.\n23:44 Comment: Yeah.\n23:46 Comment: And then you see it again.\n23:48 Comment: You could almost understand other players becoming involved even though technically they shouldn't.\n23:58 Comment: Well, you think Jamie Vardy got sent off for something that was much less dangerous than that.\n24:4 Comment: Mike Dean only sees it once, of course.\n24:10 Comment: Henderson, the player offended against, is off for the free kick, of course.\n24:14 Comment: It's Milner who takes it.\n24:16 Comment: And Firmino who wins it but can do nothing with it.\n24:18 Comment: Henderson is now back on.\n24:20 Comment: Milner.\n24:26 Comment: Lovren wins the header.\n24:28 Comment: Now by Baines and then by Barry.\n24:32 Comment: Milner.\n24:36 Comment: Cut out by Coleman.\n24:38 Comment: Here's Valencia.\n24:40 Comment: Lukaku.\n24:44 Comment: Coleman.\n24:46 Comment: There's Valencia.\n24:56 Comment: Kunis Mori.\n25:2 Comment: It's a good turn by Barkley.\n25:4 Comment: Henderson gets the ball.\n25:8 Comment: There's Origi.\n25:10 Comment: Now Mane.\n25:12 Comment: Must be changed.\n25:14 Comment: Nice and back from Mane.\n25:16 Comment: Now the pause is to think about it.\n25:20 Comment: And Mane does put it out.\n25:22 Comment: A real act of sportsmanship in the circumstances.\n25:32 Comment: It's in. A lot in it.\n25:34 Comment: Mane has just fallen into Bowie.\n25:36 Comment: Nothing Mane did really.\n25:42 Comment: Looks a bit groggy.\n25:44 Comment: Well, a change they were going to make anyway before the enforced change with the goalkeeper.\n26:2 Comment: Ronald Koeman is still going to throw the youngster to the side.\n26:4 Comment: In the end, it's a good play.\n26:6 Comment: But it's a good play.\n26:8 Comment: It's a good play.\n26:12 Comment: Still going to throw the youngster, Kelvin Lewin, on.\n26:24 Comment: And he won it back, but unfairly.\n26:26 Comment: The wrestling of Mane to ground.\n26:30 Comment: Yeah, one of those games where it's descended into a series of fouls and niggly things.\n26:38 Comment: And maybe Valencia's card has been marked from the risk he took on the edge of his own.\n26:42 Comment: Penalty area.\n26:44 Comment: And so the change does now happen.\n26:46 Comment: And it's a good show of faith in the youngster.\n26:50 Comment: Nineteen-year-old Dominic Calvin Lewin brought in from Sheffield United.\n26:54 Comment: A year ago, he was coming on in a lead-two defeat for Northampton against Portsmouth.\n27:2 Comment: And here he is now coming on in a Merseyside derby for his second Premier League appearance.\n27:8 Comment: He got round about the last 11 minutes against Arsenal.\n27:14 Comment: Obviously showed enough in that match.\n27:16 Comment: Big game in terms of his temperament to convince Ronald Koeman to stick him on here.\n27:24 Comment: As you say, Rob, it does show a lot of faith in his ability.\n27:38

    "summary": "Liverpool emerged victorious against Everton with a narrow 1-0 win in an intense Merseyside derby, held at Goodison Park. The atmosphere electric as both teams battled to impose their dominance right from the kickoff. \n\nThe match started at a blistering pace with Everton's Seamus Coleman immediately engaging in play, showcasing early intent. Within the opening minutes, Coleman exchanged passes with McCarthy, who had won over the trust of manager Ronald Koeman after a challenging period. Liverpool sought to gain control, but found Everton’s determination and energy challenging to overcome.\n\nEverton seemed the more aggressive team in the first half, with their midfield trio of McCarthy, Idrissa Gueye, and Ross Barkley working cohesively to disrupt Liverpool's flow and create opportunities. Coleman and Leighton Baines also joined the attack, making threatening runs and providing crucial crosses. Lennon's efforts on the wing, alongside Lukaku's strength up front, illustrated the home side's ambition as they pushed forward relentlessly, though initially failing to test Liverpool's keeper Mignolet thoroughly.\n\nThroughout the half, there were several intense exchanges and hard tackles, reflecting the typical frenetic nature of a derby. Both goalkeepers, Liverpool’s Mignolet and Everton's Steffenberg, came under scrutiny due to their positions coming into the match. Everton, despite their early pressure, couldn't capitalize on their efforts. Coleman’s and Valencia’s earnestness on the field saw them involved in lots of play, keeping Liverpool’s defense alert.\n\nLiverpool, while slower to start, displayed glimpses of their strategy. Origi’s movements were notable, and Firmino’s persistent involvement in the midfield indicated Liverpool's aim to build attacks methodically. Their captain Jordan Henderson worked tirelessly to link defense and attack, facing constant pressure from Everton’s midfield.\n\nSadio Mane and Divock Origi showed flashes of brilliance but were largely neutralized by Everton’s defense marshaled by Ashley Williams and Funes Mori. Several times, Lovren attempted to push forward and got involved in attacking plays, but without tangible results. The first half, thus, ended goalless with Everton perhaps edging it in terms of energy and intent but lacking precision in the final third.\n\nThe second half saw Liverpool come out stronger, reflecting clear half-time instructions from Jurgen Klopp. They immediately took control, moving the ball with more purpose and precision. Firmino and Lallana were pivotal, with Firmino almost finding the net early but being denied by a compact Everton defense. Mane continued to threaten with his pace, while Milner and Henderson orchestrated from deeper positions.\n\nEverton, who had dominated early proceedings in the first half, struggled to replicate the same intensity. Mignolet remained largely untroubled since the opening half-hour, and Liverpool took advantage, edging closer to the breakthrough. However, defensive solidity from Funes Mori and Coleman kept the scoreline intact.\n\nThe game saw a significant incident around the midpoint of the second half when Firmino surged into the box and attempted a shot that required saving. Everton's keeper Steffenberg made a number of key interventions but following a clattering between him and Mane, Steffenberg had to be substituted, bringing in Joel Robles.\n\nFrom then on, Liverpool sensed blood. They began to pile on the pressure, exhibiting the kind of intense pressing and swift movement synonymous with Klopp’s philosophy. Everton found it increasingly tricky to break out of their defensive half and create meaningful attacks.\n\nMoments of controversy flared up with rough challenges exchanged, including a notable clash involving Ross Barkley, capped off by a booking. This charged atmosphere filled Goodison Park with palpable tension as Everton's players and fans sensed a shift in momentum towards Liverpool.\n\nThe defining moment of the match came deep into stoppage time when Sturridge, brought on as a late substitute, sought to make an instant impact. His effort from outside the box struck the post and spun across the goal-line where Sadio Mane was on hand to tap in the rebound, sending the visiting Liverpool supporters into raptures while breaking the hearts of the home faithful.\n\nDespite furious attempts by Everton to find an equalizer in the dying moments, Liverpool maintained their composure, with Lovren and Klavan standing firm. As the final whistle blew, the Liverpool players celebrated a hard-fought victory that underscored their resilience and ability to seize crucial moments.\n\nThis victory propelled Liverpool back into second place in the Premier League standings, keeping the pressure firmly on league leaders Chelsea. For Everton, the defeat was a harsh reminder of their recent struggles in Merseyside derbies and would spur them to refocus as they moved into the busy festive period.\n\nWhat the match lacked in clinical finishing it more than made up for in raw emotion and passion, the hallmark of any Merseyside derby. It was a fixture that demonstrated the fine margins in football where a single moment of alertness from Mane turned potential shared points into maximum points for Liverpool.\n\nIn summary, Liverpool's resilience and strategic adjustments in the second half earned them the critical edge over Everton. The contest showcased the classic tension of a derby and underscored the significance of tactical nous and on-field adaptability. As Goodison Park fell silent at the final whistle, Liverpool fans celebrated a memorable derby victory that reverberated far beyond the confines of Merseyside."
