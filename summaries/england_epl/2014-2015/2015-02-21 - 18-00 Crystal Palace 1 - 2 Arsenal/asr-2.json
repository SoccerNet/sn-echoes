Crystal Palace is on the left in red and blue uniforms,\n0:10 Comment: Arsenal in the yellow away kit. On the right of the television picture. But now Crystal Palace is attacking\n0:16 Comment: The very first minutes. Cross from the right flank. Dwight Gale almost manages to reach this ball.\n0:21 Comment: Fred Zaha was making his way along the left flank. Arsenal is now in direct contact\n0:28 Comment: close to the top four. Currently Arsenal is in 5th place and scored 45\n0:37 Comment: points at this point. Only Southampton, Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea are ahead.\n0:43 Comment: Southampton have 46 points in their assets. So the Gunners are only one away from the Champions League zone\n0:49 Comment:  point. The team has been showing very good performances lately both in the championship and in the cup.\n0:56 Comment: Arsenal will soon make their debut in the knockout stages of the Champions League this season. But at least,\n1:2 Comment: It can be encouraging that the players of Arsene Wenger’s team are gradually returning to action.\n1:11 Comment: But the game is now stable. So far, the regular failure that happens to Arsenal in February-March\n1:21 Comment: A month ago, there are no symptoms for him and therefore the fans are more or less calm.\n1:27 Comment: Sanchez, we see that he has settled closer to the left flank. Ozil is in the center here. There is a lot of controversy\n1:36 Comment:  regarding the positions of Mesotho Ozil. It is clear that there is no good life, but simply out of necessity.\n1:41 Comment: Arsene Wenger used him on the left flank. Many, in particular Ozil's teammates,\n1:46 Comment: spoke on the topic of his positions. They said that it was uncomfortable for him to play on the left. He must act\n1:52 Comment: not from the center of the field. From there it is easier for him to lead the attack of his team and give out\n1:59 Comment: some interesting passes. Chambers throws the ball back to Loranko Silny. Loranko Silny plays\n2:6 Comment: on nacho Monreale. Arsenal's defensive combination today is quite predictable, because too\n2:13 Comment: Not without injuries lately. Mateo Di Bischi is still injured, as before\n2:17 Comment: Recovering. Arsenal with the ball. Elbeck has inaccurate passes to Olivier Giraud. Mertesacker to Silny.\n2:25 Comment: Kaklyan. Kaklyan again. Escaped the pressure. Arsenal is controlling the ball well now. Kasorla\n2:39 Comment: back to Silni. Silni plays forward. Olivier Giroud's pass. Ozil didn't shoot. Passed to\n2:44 Comment: Sanchez. Sanchez moves. Good return of the ball into the penalty area. Ozil turns and scores,\n2:51 Comment: but there was an obvious off-site. Moreover, it was recorded in advance. Mesut Ozil. They say\n2:57 Comment: about his revival at Arsenal. After his return. Oh-oh-oh. And the goal should have been counted. But\n3:6 Comment: The goal could not have taken place for the simple reason that all the players had already stopped and stopped playing.\n3:12 Comment: Still, Sperroni should have parried such a shot into the near corner. But Ozil was in the right position.\n3:19 Comment: The side referee did not see such a nuance in the position and dynamics of this episode.\n3:33 Comment: Pape Soiret is on your screens. A very interesting football player. He was purchased from Lille for the amount of,\n3:42 Comment: which has not yet been disclosed. The details of this transaction are still unknown to the public. Although they are English\n3:50 Comment: Journalists, I think, have already accumulated sufficient information on all the details of this transition. Papa Suar\n3:57 Comment: became one of the many acquisitions. A total of 8 football players came to Crystal Palace. Counting,\n4:4 Comment: for example, a transfer from Fred Zaha, who was already playing on loan. He just had a contract now and\n4:8 Comment: He was bought out. So Papa Soire is 24 years old and this is his first debut match in the English Premier League.\n4:15 Comment: He already played in the FA Cup match against Liverpool in the starting lineup. Today he appeared on the field\n4:20 Comment: Left back Senegalese. This is the kind of football player. And now the free kick. Mertvozaker\n4:29 Comment: The ball is cleared. Jason Panchin returns it to the Arsenal penalty area. Arsenal fights back,\n4:34 Comment: but Pape Suare just arrived and sent the ball out of bounds so accurately, and quite possibly beyond\n4:43 Comment: the limits of the stadium itself. Because the stand is not as high as, say, in the same Emirate.\n4:50 Comment: Well, Arsene Winger. Such a purely English outfit for Arsene Winger.\n4:59 Comment: Out in favor of the Crystal Palace players. Zakhar leaves the kick to Ward. Joe Worth. Zakhar. Worth. No position\n5:17 Comment: outside the game. You can play and this is a violation of the rules. How can this be? How can this be? The foul is not recorded and he runs\n5:23 Comment: revenge is cruel. Joe Worth. And here is a violation of the rules. Mark Clatenburg saw it. Plus on the jaw\n5:32 Comment: Got it. What is it realistic about? Well, let's see. I don't understand the position of the main side referee, I apologize,\n5:41 Comment: in this situation. Clatenburg certainly reacted to him, because this is the man with the flag\n5:47 Comment: was two meters from the episode. But how could one not see a violation here? For me it’s big\n5:53 Comment: a mystery. David Aspina is preparing to take a free kick. Wojciech Chestny took his place in the goal\n5:57 Comment: Arsenal in a cup match. Yes, this is how it also happens in a cup match against Middlesbrough in the past\n6:4 Comment: weekend. Wojciech Chestny left him at zero, but nevertheless this did not confirm his right to the place\n6:14 Comment: in goal in the English Championship game. David Aspina is still number one now. And this is a penalty.\n6:20 Comment: This is a penalty against Pe Suara in his debut match for Crystal Pelos in the first team in the English Championship.\n6:29 Comment: Dani Welbeck is fouled and Mark Clatenburg points to the spot without hesitation. Soiret brought it to himself\n6:35 Comment: This penalty. The violation, in my opinion, was within the penalty area. It’s very good there. Although\n6:43 Comment: It’s very difficult to understand. The violation of the rules was that Suare hit his opponent in the leg. But that’s where it is\n6:51 Comment: Happened? On the tape or a little behind it? That's the question. If on the line, then it's a penalty. Because\n7:0 Comment: The line is more often than the penalty line. Otherwise, you need to watch other replays. Santi Cazorlo is on the ball against Julian\n7:5 Comment: Spironi Cazorlo. 1-0 Arsenal. Eighth minute of the match. 1-0. Arsenal opens the scoring. Santi Cazorlo with\n7:13 Comment: The penalty knocks Crystal Pelos down a little. Arsene Wenger feels chilled by what's happening\n7:23 Comment: on the field. Although on the other side it will be very hot now. We haven't seen any particular disputes.\n7:30 Comment: The players of Crystal Pelos can really only blame themselves, or rather their leftback.\n7:35 Comment: Papa Suar. But there can be no complaints about Julian Spiron. Cazorlo took the penalty perfectly and\n7:42 Comment: He beat the Argentine goalkeeper. Arsenal opens the scoring in today's match. Arsenal are in this in general\n7:54 Comment: Only conceded five times in the first half this year. This happened three times in the match against Stolk. And so\n8:2 Comment: other than that, Arsenal practically opens the scoring all the time. The team that loves the most\n8:9 Comment: to score first in the English Premier League. By the way, in the first round match, when Arsenal hosted\n8:15 Comment: Crystal Pelos was at home, it was already the first round of the opening match of the Premier League of this season.\n8:20 Comment: Crystal Pelos opened the scoring in the first half and Arsenal had to come back. It's true that the team will come back\n8:26 Comment: She still managed to do it. She responded to Brad Hangel’s goal with precise shots from Laurent Kasselny under the ball again.\n8:33 Comment: from the first half and Arnold Ramsey's goal in stoppage time in the second half. So at some point\n8:40 Comment: degrees played an illogical match for themselves and the football player Crystal Pelos and Arsenal. Because just\n8:46 Comment: Pelos have tied for the most points with Tottenham this season while losing in the match.\n8:54 Comment: That is, Arsenal's victory over Crystal Pelos was the only strong-willed one this season, but Pelos\n9:0 Comment: I gained points, losing quite a lot during the match. Suarez is on his way to make up for his foul in the penalty area\n9:9 Comment:  square and already in someone else's penalty area earns a corner. It's not a penalty, but at least something.\n9:14 Comment: And Dwyde Gay will run to take the first corner in today's match. Scott Dunn, of course, is in the penalty area\n9:20 Comment: The opponent's area. There are no other tall players here, but Mile Edinak is not there, and he is very, very\n9:27 Comment: He's not bad at heading the ball. Gayle delivers to the far post to Campbell. A dangerous shot, but he blocks it,\n9:34 Comment: I think it's Callum Chambers. Misut Ozil is looking out for his teammates ahead in the opponent's half of the field.\n9:40 Comment: Manages to put his foot on Scott Dunn coming back. Pass forward.\n9:50 Comment: And Arsenal intercepts the ball. Coquelin.\n9:56 Comment: Pass on the underside of the foot, but there was no Olivier Giroud or even Misuta Ozil in front.\n10:4 Comment: By the way, Olivier Giroud, as we now see, here he is, located even more to the right of Leilbeck,\n10:10 Comment: But this is directly in this episode. So, of course, he is in the position of center forward.\n10:14 Comment: Woffred Zaha and Nacho Monreal play so well. Folid himself, perhaps without wanting it,\n10:21 Comment: But he simply had absolutely nowhere to put his foot. Wofred Zaha threw the ball between two players with his heel.\n10:26 Comment: and came across a Spanish defender.\n10:35 Comment: Pelos were more active in the first minutes, both before the goal and after the goal. I can’t say that the team is very good\n10:42 Comment: I received a serious blow. Of course, it’s unpleasant to win back in a match against such an opponent,\n10:48 Comment: Like Arsenal, but what to do? And Pelos continues to storm the opponent's goal in today's match.\n10:56 Comment: The serve from the spin does not reach the ball, another shot fails. Coquelin clears the ball from his penalty area\n11:2 Comment: The square. Suara serves the penalty kick, and here David Aspina plays reliably, but, however, everything was in order\n11:9 Comment: to ensure that he takes the ball into his hands without hindrance. Yes, the Colombian exhaled, it’s not easy for him yet.\n11:16 Comment: It has to be, but David Aspin’s performance so far is pretty good. That’s putting it mildly. In general, he missed out.\n11:28 Comment: Only three goals in five matches that he defended the goal of his team, and two of them in the derby against\n11:37 Comment: Tottenham. Probably the most offensive blow for Arsenal players and fans. Be patient\n11:42 Comment: defeat to Tottenham, even missing out on their north London neighbors for a while\n11:48 Comment: First place, of course, is a place above Arsenal in the standings, but then Liverpool did their job,\n11:54 Comment: beat Tottenham, and now Arsenal are again above Shpo. Well, Aspin conceded another goal in the last match\n12:2 Comment: A round from Leicester, however, then his team still won. Bad serve from Dwight Gayle.\n12:16 Comment: Alan Pardio on your screens.\n12:33 Comment: Well, that same referee, in general, you can even quite find his last name now, this one’s name is quick.\n12:44 Comment: the man Simon Beck, the same assistant to Mark Clatenburg who recorded the offside position\n12:52 Comment: at Misuto Zilla when he was not there, and when Misuto Zilla then hit the opponent's goal,\n12:59 Comment: but also who, apparently, also helped Mark Clatenburg in making the decision about the penalty,\n13:6 Comment: although the chief arbiter probably didn’t have any big doubts there.\n13:25 Comment: Suare.\n13:26 Comment: Knocked the ball into the opponent's half of the field, Jason Punchon caught hold of it, passed to Ward, Ward to Wefried Zaha,\n13:38 Comment: Zaha again goes to the rim of several opponents, takes the ball with the help of Santik Sorlo, players\n13:46 Comment: Arsenal, Joel Ward returned, Scott Dunn helped, he played back for his partner.\n13:55 Comment: Good throw to Dwight Gayle, but he is near the opponent's penalty area, Loranco is stronger than him,\n14:17 Comment: I squeezed out from there, and here in the duel between Zaha and Nacho Madrial, footballer Crystal Pelos is already fouling.\n14:25 Comment: The ball should stay with Arsenal, Zaha was wrong to fight at the corner flag.\n14:44 Comment: But still, it was more likely that there was a foul within the penalty area, the side referee showed that there was a foul or not.\n14:54 Comment: The contact between the players' legs is in millimeters, but still outside the penalty area.\n15:3 Comment: It’s quite stupid to blame Clatenburg, because, firstly, Suare then put his foot on the line,\n15:13 Comment: You see, there is a mark on the penalty area line where the marking is interrupted,\n15:17 Comment: This is exactly this footprint, the imprint of Pape Soiret in the moment with the fall.\n15:28 Comment: As I said, the penalty area line is part of the penalty area,\n15:32 Comment: and violations on the line should be punishable by a penalty of 11 meters.\n15:36 Comment: It was very difficult to figure it out, and I think it’s difficult to argue with this penalty and condemn Mark Clatenburg.\n15:48 Comment: It would be wrong.\n15:53 Comment: Although a penalty was awarded, again, there would be absolutely no complaints.\n16:8 Comment: The question is, by the way, why he didn't give Suara a yellow card.\n16:12 Comment: This fall clearly deserved such punishment.\n16:16 Comment: Puncheon.\n16:19 Comment: Pass to the right, Zaha gives the ball to Ward in order to open up for him.\n16:23 Comment: Oufred Zaha receives the pass, Montreal Azorlo is in front of him.\n16:26 Comment: Punchon helped here, Punchon enters the penalty area, but he entered the penalty area very clumsily,\n16:30 Comment: The Arsenal defenders provided backup there.\n16:36 Comment: But it was inconvenient to hit from here.\n16:38 Comment: Suare lost the ball again, but it's already in the opponent's half, so it's not so scary.\n16:42 Comment: Suare.\n16:44 Comment: Match.\n16:48 Comment: Delaney.\n16:56 Comment: Again Soiree, again a match and again Delaney.\n17:2 Comment: There aren't many options ahead for Crystal Pelos yet,\n17:5 Comment: but if only in this way, with a long pass, Mertvesaker's first ball goes over the air,\n17:9 Comment: But Fraser Campbell took advantage of his elbow.\n17:13 Comment: Chambers.\n17:16 Comment: Pass forward to Danny Welbeck.\n17:19 Comment: Arsenal Kassilny can finish the game.\n17:21 Comment: Punchon interrupts the ball, Arsenal finished the game, almost finished the game.\n17:26 Comment: Crystal Pelos players appeal to Mark Clatenburg regarding Laurent Cassilny's handball,\n17:30 Comment: but there the ball was thrown between the bodies of the football players,\n17:33 Comment: And frankly speaking, Kassilny had no way to anticipate such a rebound and remove his hand.\n17:39 Comment: Therefore, the unnatural position of his body parts justifies Laurent to some extent.\n17:48 Comment: Dwight Gayle throws an out into the penalty area, then a discount follows.\n17:53 Comment: Kicks the ball harder, once again the Crystal Pelos players are ready to deliver it to David Aspin's goal.\n18:0 Comment: Campbell's lob pass goes further and Aspin plays dangerously, great.\n18:6 Comment: Scott Dan jumped out for this pass, the central defender remained in place from the forward.\n18:15 Comment: Punch he is.\n18:17 Comment: Crystal Pelos has been holding the ball for a long, long time, one attack after another, one attack after another.\n18:23 Comment: Sanchez intercepted the ball, Oleksis Sanchez stayed on his feet.\n18:29 Comment: And now he had no chance, Olexis Sanchez grabs his knee.\n18:34 Comment: Clattenburg grabs a yellow card, Ledley can grab his beard,\n18:40 Comment: But Olexis Sanchez is probably the least pleasant of all the characters in this episode right now,\n18:48 Comment: But of course, Ledley scooped it up with such a scythe.\n19:4 Comment: Zaha, he's a punch.\n19:6 Comment: Return pass to Low Fredo Zaha and he wins with speed on Chumon-Real,\n19:10 Comment: Zach might be in the penalty area, he's here, he's winning,\n19:15 Comment: I tried at Chumon-Real, but I couldn’t throw the ball past him at all.\n19:20 Comment: Jordan Match received another warning from Crystal Pelos, as the caption says,\n19:25 Comment: but in my opinion, either this is incorrect information, or Match is another person,\n19:29 Comment: who received mustard plaster, but I have no idea for what.\n19:31 Comment: The fact that Joe Ledley was warned is exactly what the match is for.\n19:38 Comment: Look here, Zaha played just great at first, ahead of Santi at Chumon-Real,\n19:44 Comment: and then tried to push the ball between his legs and go to the baseline,\n19:49 Comment: The striker in the England youth team failed to do this,\n19:54 Comment: Ex-England youth team striker.\n19:56 Comment: Now Zaha is already knocking, trying to knock on doors,\n19:59 Comment: knocking on the doors of the national team.\n20:4 Comment: Casor Lam, Welback.\n20:13 Comment: Chambers serves and just plays delay.\n20:18 Comment: That was what we needed now, to clear the ball for a corner.\n20:22 Comment: I apologize, of course, that Fred Zaha has already made his debut for England in two matches in the national team,\n20:27 Comment: He spent his senior years as a Manchester United footballer.\n20:35 Comment: Kasor Lam.\n20:39 Comment: Feed into the center of the penalty area, dangerous, oh, how dangerous it was.\n20:44 Comment: Arsenal are playing their standards very well this season.\n20:47 Comment: There are performers and corner ones as well.\n20:51 Comment: Olivier Giroud discounted Kosilny.\n20:54 Comment: And these are Giroud and Kosilny, those people who mainly score with headers.\n20:59 Comment: Don't look at Mertesacker, who is over two meters tall.\n21:3 Comment: He’s not the main expert in this.\n21:6 Comment: Now it was just the combination of Giroud and Kosilny.\n21:10 Comment: Lester Usmanov, who is just this season,\n21:13 Comment: a combination of Giroud and Kosilny.\n21:16 Comment: Scored against Leicester in the last round.\n21:20 Comment: Crystal Pelos is now barely spared from his excellent play on the second floor.\n21:27 Comment: Coquelin hits the ball into the opponent's half of the field.\n21:32 Comment: Arsenal have a very high percentage of possession time in the first 21 minutes 40 seconds.\n21:39 Comment: But Crystal Pelos pushed harder and more seriously.\n21:44 Comment: Madrial fouls Zaha.\n21:47 Comment: In general, Zakhar and Madrial, this confrontation is perhaps the most important in the first half.\n21:53 Comment: He put his hand on the football player Cristal Pelos, on which Madrial.\n21:59 Comment: Here we go again, Zaha against Madrial.\n22:1 Comment: He removes him again with the same punch.\n22:3 Comment: He falls again, but there is a violation of the rule on the part of Wolfred Zaha.\n22:7 Comment: Wolfred Zaha, he fell on the back of Alexis Sanchez, who came to help his defender.\n22:14 Comment: And indeed, it was rather the home team's player who was wrong in this episode.\n22:20 Comment: At first he did everything great, and then he really fell and knocked the girl off her feet.\n22:26 Comment: Kosorla, however, tried to prove to Klatenburg that they shouldn’t have whistled because Arsenal had the ball.\n22:33 Comment: But it all turned out like this.\n22:34 Comment: And the back, Arsenal fans shout, they are located just to the right of the television picture, on the stand where the camera is located, only on the right side.\n22:46 Comment: Therefore, very close to the place where David Aspina kicked the ball into play.\n22:51 Comment: Suare, Suare was fidgeting again. Life doesn’t teach him anything, he even gave a pass back.\n22:57 Comment: So they practically took the ball away from his partner Scott Dana.\n23:5 Comment: Alexis Sanchez.\n23:9 Comment: Almost did a clean job.\n23:12 Comment: Half of the first half is over. Arsenal are ahead 1-0 thanks to the goal scored from the penalty spot.\n23:18 Comment: Santika with Orla in the very debut of the meeting.\n23:22 Comment: But everyone here is spare.\n23:24 Comment: This is from Volkot, Tomasz Rassitsky, Jack Wilshere.\n23:28 Comment: Arsenal, of course, have all the spares.\n23:31 Comment: But still, first of all, it was the first ball.\n23:33 Comment: Perhaps Suare will go to the locker room after the break.\n23:37 Comment: Or maybe even earlier. Although he’s trying really hard.\n23:40 Comment: It just doesn't work.\n23:43 Comment: Into the Arsenal penalty area and Fraser Campy.\n23:48 Comment: And so, as you can see, first of all, it was the first ball.\n23:51 Comment: And of course it wasn't just a ball.\n23:54 Comment: It was a ball that only lasted three minutes.\n23:58 Comment: And, of course, it was a ball that only lasted three minutes.\n24:1 Comment: Both Arsenal and Fraser Campy get him in the fight for the ball,\n24:8 Comment: but escorts you beyond the end line.\n24:12 Comment: There is a co-owner on your screens.\n24:19 Comment: Crystal Pelos, Steve Parish.\n24:21 Comment: Recently, when Steve Parish was talking about the appointment of Aun Pardee,\n24:25 Comment: He expressed his admiration for this man.\n24:28 Comment: He said that not everyone would take on such difficult work.\n24:31 Comment: Crystal Pelos was indeed in a very difficult position.\n24:34 Comment: The team was in close proximity to the relegation zone.\n24:37 Comment: And, frankly, there was such a moment,\n24:41 Comment: when he couldn't understand what was going on.\n24:44 Comment: And of course it wasn't just a ball.\n24:46 Comment: It wasn't just a ball.\n24:49 Comment: It was a ball that only lasted three minutes.\n24:52 Comment: And he, frankly speaking, was a ticket shadow of himself,\n24:55 Comment: Sample from the end of last season.\n24:58 Comment: Aun Pardi, who worked with better players in New Kassel,\n25:3 Comment: left this team, came here to London,\n25:6 Comment: where he spent a lot of time as a player.\n25:9 Comment: And he answered this call.\n25:12 Comment: In general, Steve Perridge was very grateful to Aun Pardi for this.\n25:16 Comment: And he noted the excellent atmosphere that immediately reigned in the club.\n25:21 Comment: I also noted the good quality of my new coach.\n25:26 Comment: But God forbid, because Crystal Pelos always has some interesting story going on with her coach.\n25:31 Comment: Both with appointment and dismissal.\n25:35 Comment: Chambers is out.\n25:38 Comment: Very painful blow.\n25:40 Comment: Very painful shot to the knee by Fraser Campbell.\n25:44 Comment: But he didn't get a yellow card.\n25:46 Comment: Nevertheless, a dangerous free kick.\n25:48 Comment: Dangerous free kick.\n25:50 Comment: The ball is placed on the corner of the penalty area.\n25:53 Comment: And Dwyde Gayle is on the ball.\n26:6 Comment: Gale's punch is straight.\n26:8 Comment: The ball goes over the crossbar.\n26:30 Comment: You'll see, only one shot on target in this game from both sides.\n26:35 Comment: And it was dealt just in the penalty spot with the anti-kosor.\n26:38 Comment: These are the fans of Crystal Pelos who do not shut up for a minute, not in a single match.\n26:43 Comment: Neither at home nor away.\n26:45 Comment: Whatever the score, Selchers Park is a team that is very proud of its fans.\n26:50 Comment: By the way, Steve Perridge also noted in an interview the fans' contribution to success.\n26:55 Comment: He said that the team, even having secured itself from the relegation zone, should in no case forget for whom it is showing its excellent game.\n27:8 Comment: Crystal Pelos is actively working with fans.\n27:11 Comment: Crystal Pelos is constantly in contact with them.\n27:14 Comment: Meetings between the club and its fans are constantly taking place.\n27:18 Comment: And not just fans of any, any, any organization.\n27:22 Comment: But directly those guys who support their team on the podium with their voices and other means.\n27:30 Comment: In particular, on the stand, which is located to our left, the most active stand of Crystal Pelos fans.\n27:35 Comment: It's called Holmesdale Stand.\n27:41 Comment: Campbell falls in the penalty area.\n27:43 Comment: This is the second consecutive violation against forward Crystal Pelos.\n27:46 Comment: True, this time Coquelin fouled.\n27:50 Comment: Mark Ladenburg, however, recently saw another warning in the Frenchman’s performance.\n27:55 Comment: Because he showed two fingers, which is a symbol for the fact that Coquelin had two warnings, two fouls.\n28:2 Comment: And so, collectively, they received a yellow card.\n28:6 Comment: It's hard to see the contact in this episode.\n28:12 Comment: But Fraser Campbell is generally not a diver.\n28:17 Comment: His fighting qualities are very, very well developed.\n28:22 Comment: He won’t just dive a free kick.\n28:24 Comment: In general, there is a problem with divers in England now.\n28:30 Comment:  Very serious.\n28:32 Comment: Barta Zaker knocks the ball out of the penalty area and lands right between the Crystal Pelos players, who were ready to play on the rebound.\n28:40 Comment: A lucky arsenal fought back here.\n28:43 Comment: We'll see if he can carry out a counterattack.\n28:46 Comment: So, in my opinion, the issue is with football players who pretend to break the rules.\n28:52 Comment: It's much more important and thorough now.\n28:57 Comment: Much more relevant.\n28:58 Comment: And needed by football.\n29:0 Comment: What is this imaginary fight against racism, which is being propagated at all levels.\n29:10 Comment: By prohibiting wrestlers who have done something wrong in the metro in another country from visiting stadiums in England.\n29:23 Comment: But this is a separate topic for discussion.\n29:25 Comment: Crystal Pelos, the arsenal is what we care about now.\n29:29 Comment: And half an hour in this match is almost played.\n29:33 Comment: 1-0 in favor of the visiting team.\n29:36 Comment: Ozil, he's not that noticeable today.\n29:39 Comment: But like the entire Arsenal attack group, the guests were otherwise only defending themselves, as far as the episode with the goal was concerned.\n29:50 Comment: Zaha.\n29:51 Comment: It's Montreal against him.\n29:53 Comment: Zaha passed to Ward.\n29:55 Comment: Montreal has exposed its left flanks.\n29:57 Comment: He must go back there now.\n30:0 Comment: He returns slowly because Santi Consorlo managed to foul.\n30:6 Comment: Crystal Pelos runs-penalty, but from her own half of the field.\n30:12 Comment: There are a lot of violations and the game turns out to be ragged because of this.\n30:15 Comment: The pace of the arsenal is disrupted.\n30:17 Comment: It's certainly not the same game as against Machester City away.\n30:21 Comment: The task was completely different, I played completely differently.\n30:27 Comment: Arsenal, although there are also common features.\n30:33 Comment: Punch he is.\n30:35 Comment: Arsenal played in much the same way, it's just that the opponents don't play the kind of football that Machester City offered.\n30:43 Comment: Inaccurate pass, interception, Olivier Geraud.\n30:46 Comment: Of course, he’s also bored hanging around there without the ball on the other side of the field, even if it’s sunny.\n30:52 Comment: But of course that's not true.\n30:54 Comment: And of course it's not true.\n30:56 Comment: But of course that's not true.\n30:57 Comment: Madrialka is stronger.\n31:7 Comment: Delainey.\n31:34 Comment: There is a run from Sanchez, but Sanchez shoots himself, Scott Dunn and Julian Spironi trip him up\n31:40 Comment: Leaves the ball in the field. Cool episode from the Arsenal players. Great combination in attack\n31:48 Comment: Crystal Palace's defensive players also rose to the occasion. Alexis Sanchez did not react\n31:58 Comment: At his partner's run and hit with a turn himself. A long pass forward is received by Zaha. Panchan\n32:17 Comment: He plays much deeper than he played before. I remember Panchan was almost a striker before that.\n32:31 Comment: Moreover, it’s not pure and naturally after that with Neil Vordak. Zaha stops the ball with his hand.\n32:42 Comment: Gladenburg's reaction is immediate. Free kick in favor of Arsenal.\n32:49 Comment: Wilfried Zaha, I already said that he\n33:4 Comment: Two years ago he shone with Crystal Palace. He was recognized as the best football player in the championship\n33:12 Comment: 2012-2013 season. Included in the symbolic team of the championship. Was the undisputed best player\n33:20 Comment: Crystal Palace and the clear leader of the team. He did not have any specific position on the field.\n33:27 Comment: He played almost everywhere in attack and had no equal at all. On his hard park he\n33:35 Comment: enjoyed great respect and great love from the fans. They saw him off to Machester United with\n33:41 Comment: very serious honors. There was a separate ceremony here at the stadium after the last one\n33:48 Comment: home championship match. The ceremony in which Wilfried Zaha said thank you and said\n33:56 Comment: Of course, goodbye. This meeting turned out to be quicker, probably, than he expected and than\n34:3 Comment: I could have expected it. But what should I do in the end, he is only 22 years old and has a chance to play for a top club\n34:12 Comment: He may still appear. Ozil, two football players at once, Dwight Gayle and Pape Suaro, put pressure on him and\n34:20 Comment: Ozil saved the ball for his team. Columbus Chambers will shoot from the throwout.\n34:34 Comment: Chambers, Koklyan. The mess is not exactly a mistake, but an unpleasant medium performed by Ledley.\n34:45 Comment: Julian Spironic was ready for this episode, but the Arsenal players did not protect such an interesting rebound.\n35:3 Comment: Suaro, forward throw. Gale couldn't take the ball.\n35:34 Comment: It was important, of course, for Arsenal to score first. I’ll repeat losing to this team during the match.\n35:41 Comment: They don’t like it very much. And they practically don’t do it. If Arsenal scores, then as a rule they don’t\n35:49 Comment: let go of his opponent. But in addition, Arsenal still have very good results at Selcherspark\n35:58 Comment: Basically. This team, which has stayed here many times, has never lost at Selcherspark.\n36:10 Comment: In 11 matches, 6 wins and 5 draws. Well, the balance of the meeting between Crystal Pels and Arsenal\n36:22 Comment: The overall is also impressive. Crystal Pels have 2 wins in 29 matches, Arsenal have 19 winning matches.\n36:33 Comment: Montreal removed Wefred Zaha and again in favor of Arsenal defender Mark Clatenburg judged this episode.\n36:52 Comment: All this happened right in close proximity to the main loudest sector with fans\n37:4 Comment: Crystal Pelos. And in general, their attitude towards Santika Sorli, who will now be, is friendly\n37:14 Comment: There's no way to serve a serve. Santika Sorli isn't exactly a stone's throw away,\n37:19 Comment: Anyone can touch it with their hand if they want. But for now, the fans prefer to use their voice\n37:26 Comment: Crystal Pelosa. Santika Sorli is doing her job by delivering the ball into the penalty area. Cristal Pelosa\n37:34 Comment: He's fighting back, Fraser Campbell is running at full speed towards this ball, he's carelessly leaning into it so imposingly\n37:41 Comment: Columbus Chambers returning back. Arsenal really intercepts the ball and it doesn't matter at all.\n37:47 Comment: Chambers. Suare will throw out. Suare has become less noticeable. But maybe he saw Martin Kelly\n38:4 Comment: warming up and decided not to take any more risks. Panchan. Pass forward to Dazakh's woofer. There was little chance\n38:18 Comment: This pass needs to be accurate. Kozorla, Koklyan. Pressing doesn't help. Crystal Pelos,\n38:27 Comment: Arsenal is still almost one step ahead everywhere in every combination in every pass.\n38:34 Comment: Sanchez puts his back. Scratches this ball. Cozorla. Excellent movement by the Arsenal players. Montreal and\n38:46 Comment: movement of the ball between them respectively. Kozorla. Sanchez. Mertozacker.\n39:4 Comment: Welbeck. Chambers. Welbeck asks for a return pass. Receives it from Columbus Chambers. No,\n39:11 Comment: doesn't get it. Delay didn't do a great job on Pesoire. He starts his team's attack. Welbeck is his again\n39:16 Comment: Almost covers. The ball is already in Arsenal's half of the field. Not for long. The hosts will be on the defensive again.\n39:34 Comment: And one more out. Indeed, the number of pauses in this game is impressive. It doesn’t flow, it doesn’t flow.\n39:42 Comment: Alan Pardio fed the ball to Chambers. It's not a rush, but there's a certain urgency.\n39:55 Comment:  Sanchez. Good pass, but he really passed it straight into the fight to Santi Cozorla.\n40:4 Comment: Welbeck.\n40:12 Comment: Efried Zaha is already on a yellow card. And because of this, his thirst for fight does not fade away. He is constantly\n40:18 Comment: clings to the ball, but often clings to the opponent. Now he was working on the verge of a fall. Kladenburg did not\n40:25 Comment: I saw his actions as criminal. Chambers did not execute the serve. He swung it and left it\n40:31 Comment: The ball is in his possession. Welbeck plays through Misuta Ozil. I apologize to Kosorlu. Now Welbeck.\n40:41 Comment: Now again the pass into the penalty area is penetrating this time. Again to Ozil. And Ozil for the second time.\n40:47 Comment: falls into offside position. The first one was wrong. But now there is reason to believe that Simon Beck was right after all.\n40:58 Comment: The box is full. Selchers Park is filled to capacity today.\n41:4 Comment: Well, why not come to such a match and watch it.\n41:21 Comment: There are some empty seats. True, in the central stand in particular.\n41:24 Comment: Fraser Campbell in the penalty area. Loranco is stronger against him. The back pass was played by Coquelin at right-back.\n41:31 Comment: No foul. Jason Punch gets up, though. He hits the near corner. Dwyde Gayle. Dwyde Gayle killed with a turn.\n41:42 Comment: And Clatenburg has the impression that he is making excuses to the players. Perhaps the players had complaints.\n41:48 Comment: Arsenal that Gale fell on the ball and then continued playing. And Mark Clatenburg should not have allowed it\n41:54 Comment: This is for the player Crystal Pelos to do. But as we see, Gayle did not fix the ball under himself. It got stuck at his feet.\n42:0 Comment: Gail serves quickly. Served to the back. Knocked out the back.\n42:9 Comment: Zaha pass. The back plays. Perhaps so many crosses directly to the goalkeeper and into the area next to\n42:22 Comment: David from the back is due to the fact that while the Colombian goalkeeper is dry in this meeting, but not always\n42:31 Comment: I’m sure. Yes, and maybe his fall occurred during that episode when he kicked the ball away from his own goal.\n42:40 Comment: by chance, but there were some regular misfires at the exits and so on. It all happened to him.\n43:1 Comment: Chambers put the ball between Delane's legs, but defender Crystal Pelos still stopped him from going any further.\n43:14 Comment: The ball hits Gale and hangs up. There is an Arsenal attack on the right flank. There is no violation of the rules. We fought back\n43:25 Comment: Pelos players and then Fraser Campbell threw the ball, probably for his own move, but it turned out that it was over the sideline.\n43:32 Comment: No need to be sad. Crystal Pelos has everything.\n43:48 Comment: Not as bad as it might seem. Yes, today there are some players we are used to seeing at the start,\n44:1 Comment: In particular, Yeni Boisier is on the bench. Oh, how he openly set up Julian Spironi now\n44:8 Comment: His defender and Argentine goalkeeper Bravo, of course, found himself in a very difficult situation.\n44:15 Comment: He fell besides Boisier, Edinok, as I already said, on the bench. Martin Keighley is also on the bench. Sholami both.\n44:22 Comment: Finally I've gotten into shape and I'm ready to play for my team in the Premier League, for my new team.\n44:34 Comment: Make your debut. Well, here again Zaha tried very hard, but did not handle the ball properly.\n44:53 Comment: The last minute of normal time of the first half is coming to an end. 1-0 in favor of Arsenal.\n45:4 Comment: 2. The teams will still be on the field. Dangerous, dangerous. 2-0. Olivier Giroud makes the score 2-0 in favor of Arsenal.\n45:14 Comment:  Mark Clatenburg's injury time for the first half. The visiting sector is absolutely delighted.\n45:21 Comment: Those who have not yet gone out to eat hot dogs and wash them down with beer have now seen their team's next goal.\n45:30 Comment: Very important before the break, because 0-1 for Crystal Pelos is not so bad.\n45:38 Comment: Huryan Spironi hit the ball in front of him and this is really a mistake by the Pelos goalkeeper.\n45:46 Comment: Danny Welbeck took a shot, but this shot, of course, is very unpleasant from close range.\n45:52 Comment: In any case, the goalkeeper at Crystal Pelos should have saved it differently.\n45:57 Comment: But the claims against the home team’s players, of course, don’t stop there.\n46:3 Comment: The defensive line, frankly speaking, was yawning.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: This is not a team that is ready to bend to circumstances and give up.\n0:6 Comment: Mark Clatenburg counted the players with the restart whistle and made sure that everyone had 11,\n0:12 Comment: gave the Pelos players the opportunity to start from the center of the field.\n0:17 Comment: The match immediately earns an out, but earns an out in its favor, that is, for the Arsenal players.\n0:25 Comment: So, Crystal Palace-Arsenal, the second half of the match has started, and let me remind you of the lineups of the teams playing today.\n0:33 Comment: Juian Spironi in goal for Crystal Palace as number 1, Scott Dunn as number 6 and Demin Deleny as number 27.\n0:40 Comment: Central defenders Pape Souare number 40 plays on the left Joel Ward, number two on the right, dangerous!\n0:47 Comment: Fraser Campbell, Jordan Mutch left him the ball, but Fraser Campbell was on the green,\n0:52 Comment: he couldn't make a shot, it was a shame.\n0:54 Comment: Zaha cross!\n0:59 Comment: Well, Simon Beck, that’s the name of this man with the flag, the assistant to the chief referee, on the distant television camera of Brovka.\n1:15 Comment: Fraser Campbell did not play the ball, so the offside should not have been called.\n1:20 Comment: Simon Beck is wrong again.\n1:22 Comment: Let me remind you that in the first half Misut Ozio's goal was not counted, for the very reason that Simon Beck raised the flag.\n1:30 Comment: True, then the game actually stopped, and Ozio hit the empty goal when Julian Spironi didn’t even think about hitting the ball somehow.\n1:40 Comment: But nonetheless.\n1:42 Comment: Campbell, good pass to Zaha, Zaha!\n1:46 Comment: Tried to execute the cross, put his foot on Chumanreal in time.\n1:50 Comment: But we can’t get there like this.\n1:52 Comment: Before Wilfred Zaha, before Fraser Campbell.\n1:57 Comment: We list Crystal Pelos players.\n2:0 Comment: Jordan Mutch, number 22, and Joe Ledley, number 28.\n2:4 Comment: These are the team's central midfielders.\n2:7 Comment: Jason Punch, he's 42nd, plays left.\n2:9 Comment: Wilfred Zaha, 11th from right.\n2:10 Comment: Dwight Gayle, 16th in the attack, is in front of him at the forefront.\n2:15 Comment: Fraser Campbell actually plays.\n2:17 Comment: Zaha once again receives the ball in a flat area.\n2:20 Comment: And now the shot fails again.\n2:22 Comment: Montreal started again.\n2:23 Comment: Zaha vs Montreal.\n2:24 Comment: This is the most interesting thing we saw in the first half.\n2:29 Comment: On the right edge of the attack is Crystal Pelos.\n2:32 Comment: Wilfred Zaha is constantly causing trouble for Montreal.\n2:35 Comment: But he is holding up well.\n2:37 Comment: It must be said that he lost a few fights.\n2:40 Comment: For now, Zaha is coping with the amount of work.\n2:43 Comment: Punchon.\n2:44 Comment: Wilfried Zaha again.\n2:45 Comment: And you could hit someone.\n2:47 Comment: And again his crosses are blocked.\n2:49 Comment: And again old songs about the main thing.\n2:52 Comment: Olivier Giroud.\n2:53 Comment: Arsenal striker.\n2:54 Comment: I came to help my teammates in the penalty area.\n2:57 Comment: And it was he who put his foot in front of this cross.\n3:3 Comment: Jason Punchon.\n3:4 Comment: That this time Jason Puncheon delivers a cross to the far post.\n3:9 Comment: And here Fraser Campbell did not have enough leg length, technique, or skill to receive and handle this ball.\n3:17 Comment: This is how Crystal Pelos spent three minutes of the first half in attack.\n3:22 Comment: He's exactly the same as most of the time in the first half.\n3:25 Comment: But so far this has not brought success.\n3:28 Comment: Success is brought to Arsenal by its competent play and the skill of its players.\n3:34 Comment: David Aspina.\n3:35 Comment: Among them is number thirteen in goal.\n3:37 Comment: In the center of the field, Permertezaker is fourth.\n3:39 Comment: Mowers sixth.\n3:42 Comment: Now they have a huge responsibility.\n3:44 Comment: Permertezaker beats him to Fraser Campbell.\n3:46 Comment: However, Coquelin comes and helps.\n3:48 Comment: Campbell turns around.\n3:50 Comment: Other players join the fight.\n3:51 Comment: And Crystal Pelos imposes pressure in someone else's penalty area.\n3:54 Comment: But the ball was hit.\n3:55 Comment: Scott Dun.\n3:59 Comment: Brings it back forward.\n4:2 Comment: Sanchez.\n4:7 Comment: Zaha.\n4:10 Comment: On all fours he threw the ball forward and earned an out.\n4:13 Comment: Ledley.\n4:16 Comment: Zaha.\n4:17 Comment: Another pass can be made into the penalty area.\n4:19 Comment: If only somehow past three football players.\n4:21 Comment: Throw the ball to Panchun.\n4:23 Comment: Ward.\n4:27 Comment: Alexis Sanchez vs. Ward.\n4:29 Comment: Ward loses the ball.\n4:31 Comment: Welbeck.\n4:32 Comment: Giroud.\n4:33 Comment: Kasola.\n4:35 Comment: And out in favor of Arsenal.\n4:37 Comment: So here it is.\n4:39 Comment: Macho Montreal number 18

On the right is Dani Welbeck 23.\n5:1 Comment: Olivier Giroud number 12.\n5:3 Comment: At the forefront of the attack.\n5:5 Comment: Let me remind you that Arsenal scored from the penalty spot in the first half.\n5:11 Comment: At the 9th minute Santi Kozorlo.\n5:13 Comment: And at 46, already in stoppage time, Olivier Giroud scored his goal from the field.\n5:21 Comment: A shot into an empty goal, in fact, with a finishing touch.\n5:27 Comment: Ozio is waiting for Welbeck.\n5:29 Comment: Welbeck to the right, not bad.\n5:33 Comment: Welbeck is at the main flag.\n5:35 Comment: Chambers.\n5:37 Comment: A pass into the area where Olivier Giroud should have been following a challenge from Columbus Chambers.\n5:43 Comment: Sanchez plays.\n5:45 Comment: Center of the penalty on Misut Ozio.\n5:47 Comment: But Misut Ozio's strike was not as simple as...\n5:49 Comment: as Julian Spironi first thought, to send the ball to the corner\n5:59 Comment: one very dangerous corner was taken in the first half to Sarlat Giroud played by Giroud and threw it further on\n6:6 Comment: to stronger to stronger hit past the goal on the ball hit the crossbar they are in\n6:13 Comment: Julian

Fraser Campbell who pulled his hamstring.\n9:57 Comment: Oh oh oh.\n9:59 Comment: Perhaps a replacement will be needed sooner than Aon Paardio would like.\n10:7 Comment: No Fraser Campbell yet.\n10:9 Comment: While ten men are storming the Arsenal gates.\n10:11 Comment: Crystal Pelos.\n10:12 Comment: While the serve is at the near post.\n10:13 Comment: And Arsenal copes.\n10:14 Comment: Suare.\n10:15 Comment: Arsenal managed to play on the rebound.\n10:19 Comment: However, Dwight Gayle's attack continues.\n10:22 Comment: Another player in red and blue uniform on the lawn.\n10:24

counterattack ends with Alexis Sanchez missing the target.\n11:21 Comment: It was brilliantly played.\n11:22 Comment: And Chambers and Ozio did everything right from the beginning, and Sanchez was no mistake either.\n11:28 Comment: But he simply missed the target in a situation where...\n11:32 Comment: Doing this was perhaps as difficult as getting between.\n11:40 Comment: And here he has...\n11:40 Comment: Between the rods\n11:43 Comment: Julian Spironi confused Chilica and prevented him from hitting his goal.\n11:57 Comment: Unique Bouloise appeared on the field.\n12:2 Comment: Instead of Fraser Campbell, as one might have expected.\n12:7 Comment: But in the end...\n12:10 Comment: Amoebi Show, another candidate.\n12:14 Comment: But the Amoebi Show is apparently not ready for its debut yet.\n12:17 Comment: Or he will appear on the field later.\n12:19 Comment: In general, it's a shame.\n12:20 Comment: Without Fraser Campbell, of course, it will be difficult to play.\n12:23 Comment: For the simple reason that Fraser Campbell is simply an example of hard work, perseverance, and courage.\n12:32 Comment: A person who will give his all to the game until the very last minute, second.\n12:37 Comment: He does not get tired, does not lose heart.\n12:40 Comment: Torments opponents' defenses in every match.\n12:42 Comment: Today it was only enough for 57 minutes.\n12:46 Comment: Bouloise, however, also immediately joined the fight.\n12:50 Comment: Bouloise is responsible at Crystal Palace for some interesting inventions, for creativity, for an unconventional approach to implementing attacks.\n13:5 Comment: Maybe this is what Crystal Palace needs now.\n13:10 Comment: But, in general, that's all you need.\n13:12 Comment: Diagonal transmission.\n13:14 Comment: Watching.\n13:16 Comment: Joel Ward's Montreal started calmly.\n13:19 Comment: But Joel Ward also played a little ugly.\n13:21 Comment: He flew into his opponent without looking at the ball at

David Aspin Aboisier has now somersaulted over his head.\n16:45 Comment: Cross to the far post. Aspin is wrong. Zaha. Again Zakha resists.\n16:50 Comment: Pushes against defenders and the opponents' goal, instead of looking back and making a back pass under the attack.\n16:57 Comment: Such a smart football player, Zaha always sees the field so well.\n17:4 Comment: But why is it that in the penalty area the opponent is only focused on moving forward and cannot find another development for the attack.\n17:12 Comment: Again he has the ball on the border in Radar Square.\n17:15 Comment: Once again, Crystal Pelos is left with nothing. Pape Soire on Aboisier.\n17:21 Comment: Up ahead, Dwight Gayle waves his arms and asks for a pass.\n17:24 Comment: Aboisier leaves and moves to the center.\n17:26 Comment: Like Lean.\n17:27 Comment: This is Welbeck.

    "summary": "In a tightly contested Premier League match held at Selhurst Park, Crystal Palace fell narrowly to Arsenal with a final score of 1-2. The game was marked by a spirited performance from both teams, with Arsenal capitalizing on key moments to secure victory. Here's a detailed breakdown of the match dynamics:\n\n**First Half: A Mixed Bag of Chances and Controversy**\n\nThe game kicked off with Crystal Palace, donned in their red and blue home kit, attacking vigorously. Almost immediately, Dwight Gayle had an opportunity via a cross from the right flank, but it was narrowly missed. Arsenal, in their yellow away kit, countered quickly and took control of the ball, trying to establish their rhythm.\n\nOne of Arsenal’s first significant moves came when Mesut Özil found Alexis Sanchez with a good return ball into the penalty area. Though Özil turned and scored, the goal was disallowed due to an offside decision against Özil, a call that commentators and fans alike found debatable.\n\nAs the match progressed, Mesut Özil's positioning became a topic of discussion. Arsenal's lineup reflected their current injury woes, with a predictable defensive combination but notable absences such as Matteo Debuchy. The Arsenal backline, involving Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny, was under significant pressure from Crystal Palace’s relentless attacks.\n\nIn the 8th minute, a pivotal incident occurred when Pape Souaré, making his Premier League debut with Crystal Palace, conceded a penalty by fouling Danny Welbeck. Santi Cazorla stepped up to calmly slot home the penalty, giving Arsenal an early lead at 1-0.\n\nDespite trailing, Crystal Palace continued to press. Their newly acquired left-back Souaré, albeit nervous, showed glimpses of promise but was under considerable scrutiny after the penalty incident. Alan Pardew’s men remained aggressive, with Wilfried Zaha in particular posing a constant threat along the flanks, repeatedly challenging Arsenal's Nacho Monreal.\n\nCrystal Palace's perseverance almost paid off through a series of set pieces and corner kicks taken primarily by Dwight Gayle. However, crucial defensive interventions by Arsenal, specifically from players like Calum Chambers and Francis Coquelin, kept the scoreline in favor of the visitors.\n\nAs the first half neared its conclusion, Arsenal managed to double their lead through Olivier Giroud. Julian Speroni, the Crystal Palace goalkeeper, failed to properly parry a close-range shot by Danny Welbeck, and Giroud capitalized on the loose ball. This goal, coming right before halftime, was a significant blow to Crystal Palace, who had been working hard to equalize.\n\n**Second Half: Crystal Palace's Fightback and Arsenal's Resilience**\n\nThe second half began with Crystal Palace showing no signs of surrender. The intensity of their play did not wane, and they continued to mount pressure on the Arsenal defense. Early on, Fraser Campbell, despite being in a promising position, failed to convert due to slipping on the turf – a recurring issue for several players during this match.\n\nZaha’s constant duels with Monreal were a standout feature of the game. He frequently got past the Arsenal defender and managed to create several crossing opportunities, though most were either blocked or found no takers in the box.\n\nDespite Crystal Palace’s efforts, Arsenal was able to hold their shape defensively. Key performances from Mertesacker and Koscielny, along with the assured goalkeeping of David Ospina, were crucial. An unfortunate incident saw Ospina collide with a Crystal Palace player, but he continued after medical attention, showcasing resolve.\n\nFrustration grew within the Crystal Palace ranks as they repeatedly saw promising attacks fizzle out at crucial moments. Newly introduced substitutes like Yanik Bolasie added fresh legs and creativity but to no avail against a well-drilled Arsenal backline.\n\nCrystal Palace, however, had their opportunities. Jason Puncheon had a fantastic chance from a free-kick situation, but his effort flew just wide. Dwight Gayle’s delivery into the box created a few scares, but Arsenal’s collective defensive effort continued to deny them.\n\nAs the match drew towards its climax, Crystal Palace's persistence was finally rewarded. In the 90th minute, substitute Glenn Murray managed to scramble the ball over the line after a chaotic sequence in the Arsenal penalty area involving multiple shots and deflections. Murray’s goal provided Crystal Palace with a glimmer of hope, reducing the deficit to 1-2.\n\nArsenal's response was to fortify their defense further. The introduction of Gabriel Paulista added solidity, and the Gunners effectively saw out the remaining minutes. Despite Crystal Palace’s valiant final push, Arsenal’s disciplined defending ensured they held onto their slim lead.\n\n**Match Summary: Key Points**\n\n1. **Early Arsenal Advantage:** Arsenal's early penalty conversion through Santi Cazorla gave them a crucial head start.\n2. **Controversial Decisions:** Offside calls and penalty awards were hot topics throughout the match, shaping much of the game’s narrative.\n3. **Crystal Palace’s Bravery:** Despite conceding a second goal right before halftime, Crystal Palace’s relentless pressure kept the match intensely competitive.\n4. **Late Drama:** Glen Murray’s late goal sparked a potential comeback, but Arsenal’s defense, with key performances from Mertesacker and Ospina, managed to secure the win.\n5. **Tactical Decisions:** Alan Pardew’s substitutions brought fresh energy to Crystal Palace, but Arsene Wenger’s defensive changes helped Arsenal navigate the final moments successfully.\n\nIn conclusion, Arsenal emerged victorious in a closely contested match that highlighted their resilience under pressure and the clinical finishing when it mattered most. Crystal Palace, though defeated, displayed commendable spirit and tenacity, ensuring the game remained a captivating contest until the final whistle."
