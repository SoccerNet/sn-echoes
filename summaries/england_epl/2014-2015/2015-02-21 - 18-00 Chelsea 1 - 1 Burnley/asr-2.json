first league match and in that match\n0:8 Comment: Chelsea won 1-3.\n0:9 Comment: The Barley came forward.\n0:11 Comment: You have to remember that he got ahead in that game and ended up coming back without too many difficulties\n0:17 Comment: Chelsea.\n0:18 Comment: Exactly, just what I was going to say.\n0:19 Comment: I remember that game very well.\n0:20 Comment: Barley started well, they scored a goal, but Chelsea won comfortably.\n0:24 Comment: That's why today I shouldn't have any problems either, but as you said, football is complex\n0:30 Comment: and everything is possible.\n0:33 Comment: He started with the ball square, left it for Ivanovic.\n0:36 Comment: There it is square again.\n0:37 Comment: Chelsea who is on the right of the image in this first half.\n0:41 Comment: On the left the Barley.\n0:44 Comment: Cuadrado who once again receives an opportunity as a starter.\n0:46 Comment: It was already against Everton, today it is again.\n0:49 Comment: He played for a while against PSG the other day.\n0:53 Comment: Those who are not in Chelsea's gala eleven until now would be the square itself for\n0:58 Comment: William, who is on the bench, Felipe Luis for Azpilicueta and Zouma for Keyhiel.\n1:2 Comment: The rest of the team is the one that has been playing all season and is almost immovable.\n1:6 Comment: So we have a more than competitive team, of course, in Chelsea.\n1:13 Comment: It would be known towards Eden Hazard.\n1:15 Comment: Hazard was looking to win the baseline there.\n1:19 Comment: It rests on a square.\n1:21 Comment: Square that leaves that ball behind for Matic.\n1:24 Comment: Chelsea already dominating territorially after this first minute and a half of\n1:28 Comment:  game.\n1:29 Comment: I left square again for Hazard.\n1:34 Comment: There is Juan Cuadrado with Ivanovic, Ivanovic, Matic, Matic.\n1:39 Comment: Filtering that ball for his compatriot, Ivanovic who scored again\n1:44 Comment: decisive for his team.\n1:46 Comment: And there are quite a few, not only this season, but since it arrived in 2010.\n1:52 Comment: I think I have the statistics there, there are 27 goals that Ivanovic has scored since\n1:56 Comment: August 2010.\n1:57 Comment: Fantastic figure for a side who has once been a central defender, but who is already more\n2:2 Comment: that seated in the lateral position.\n2:4 Comment: A player who also does his primary job very well, which is to defend.\n2:10 Comment: He defends very well, he is fast, he helps in the aerial game.\n2:15 Comment: He can play as a center back or as a winger, he projects quite well in attack.\n2:19 Comment: He is a player, I think he is one of the best signings that Chelsea has made in terms of\n2:23 Comment: to performance and the money it cost in recent times.\n2:27 Comment: This Zuma, the French central defender, very powerful, very young.\n2:32 Comment: Somewhat inexperienced, but physically prodigious.\n2:36 Comment: I was trying to win that ball Boit.\n2:38 Comment: And ultimately that pressure from George Boit ends with the first corner kick of the\n2:44 Comment:  game.\n2:45 Comment: First important situation for Barça in attack, enjoying this action with the ball\n2:56 Comment:  stopped.\n2:57 Comment: Tripier will be the one in charge of putting the ball into play.\n3:3 Comment: There goes that delivery, closed, Courtois manages to clear.\n3:7 Comment: Courtois is coming off a truly outstanding performance in the Champions League.\n3:12 Comment: There was speculation about the presence of Petr Cech, but Mourinho preferred to keep the goal\n3:18 Comment: to the Belgian.\n3:19 Comment: It's true that Courtois was coming off a slightly weaker performance.\n3:23 Comment: He had made some mistakes, especially in aerial balls, which is not usual for him.\n3:30 Comment: I think Mourinho gave him a wake-up call the other day by leaving him as a substitute.\n3:34 Comment: Although in reality I believe that Courtois feels like he is a starter, because he is a starter.\n3:39 Comment: I think he is already indisputably Chelsea's number one, he will be for many years.\n3:44 Comment: But the other day Cech played and Courtois is getting back to his best.\n3:47 Comment: Let's see why Keitly stole that ball.\n3:51 Comment: The Barça player has been very fast, now leaning back on Mbappé.\n3:58 Comment: Mbappé's ball.\n4:19 Comment:  43 years.\n4:25 Comment: Square for Matic.\n4:27 Comment: Matic towards Felipe Luis.\n4:29 Comment: The left wing is more open, Hazard.\n4:31 Comment: The Brazilian who places that ball in the area, in the heart of the area, at the height of the penalty spot.\n4:35 Comment: He arrived square to head between the three posts and force Gitton to have to force what will be Chelsea's first corner kick of the match.\n4:45 Comment: Let's see what move he proposes, square, better.\n4:47 Comment: Breaking from the second line, he crosses the space between the centre-backs and they put a sensational ball on him.\n4:55 Comment: Great Philip Luis.\n4:58 Comment: That corner kick was thrown away.\n5:0 Comment: Cuadrado was looking for the center.\n5:1 Comment: Bad punt by Boit.\n5:2 Comment: Fight there Terry.\n5:4 Comment: The ball is still in front.\n5:5 Comment: Kair Lid arrived.\n5:6 Comment: Again Terry.\n5:10 Comment: John Terry again trying to direct that ball towards Sess.\n5:15 Comment: Terry trying to stretch.\n5:17 Comment: Now the con.\n5:19 Comment: Ings left behind Boit who started in an offside position.\n5:25 Comment: Dan Ings had left that ball towards the side, towards Trippier.\n5:29 Comment: And this one's pass ended with Boit slightly ahead.\n5:35 Comment: Chelsea therefore regains possession.\n5:38 Comment: And Kair Lid, the second ball he steals and which ends up causing Chelsea to be completely divided.\n5:47 Comment: The shot between the three sticks.\n5:49 Comment: Very dangerous on this occasion.\n5:52 Comment: Good shot that Courtois finally resolved.\n5:57 Comment: Another loss.\n5:59 Comment: You said it and the person who lost that ball in a dangerous area was square.\n6:5 Comment: In an action that didn't make much sense.\n6:8 Comment: Those losses that cause more anger in the coach.\n6:12 Comment: Because I didn't gain anything by keeping that ball.\n6:17 Comment: And yet he has become an easy victim for Kair Lid, who is a very aggressive player.\n6:23 Comment: Well, the Vars action is over.\n6:25 Comment: He was the player who ended up volleying towards Courtois' goal.\n6:30 Comment: Definitely catching the Chelsea goalkeeper.\n6:34 Comment: Well, VARLEY was totally uninhibited in the match.\n6:41 Comment: With a capacity also to try to exploit their opportunities.\n6:47 Comment: There we have precisely Vars who was the protagonist of the previous action.\n6:52 Comment: Neyde's center and that ball after touching Matic.\n6:56 Comment: It hooks well, not very hard but it was not easy to hook that ball if it still fell.\n7:4 Comment: Ivanovic loses.\n7:9 Comment: The first 7 minutes of the game have passed.\n7:11 Comment: And after that initial territorial dominance by Chelsea.\n7:15 Comment: The feeling is that right now Mourinho's team doesn't have control of the game either.\n7:19 Comment: With a VARLEY surprised there with a couple of exits that he has caught.\n7:25 Comment: Look where the VARLEY is installed.\n7:28 Comment: Evidently he is going to have bad stretches, he is going to suffer a lot.\n7:32 Comment: And that he is going to suffer the attacks of Chelsea.\n7:34 Comment: And he's going to have to lower the VARICENTRO, his VARICENTRO the team.\n7:40 Comment: But as long as it can, the team keeps the lines at a good height.\n7:47 Comment: Boit arrives, he didn't think twice.\n7:49 Comment: He jumped on Felipe.\n7:53 Comment: That is, the idea is not to lock yourself in.\n7:57 Comment: Evidently if a team locks itself in it is almost impossible for it to get anything positive.\n8:2 Comment: You can lock yourself in but you have to deploy at a given moment.\n8:5 Comment: The VARLEY is trying, look, here it is again, not to bother too much.\n8:11 Comment: Jones had recovered the ball.\n8:13 Comment: I was already playing for Keane.\n8:16 Comment: Heaton's hit by the goalkeeper.\n8:19 Comment: Sending in the direction of Barnes.\n8:21 Comment: I had lost sight of the ball Barnes.\n8:23 Comment: So does John Terry.\n8:24 Comment: Get there quickly square to drive the ball towards Ivanovic.\n8:29 Comment: Ivanovic with Souma.\n8:31 Comment: Terry and the pressure is back up.\n8:34 Comment:  Besides...\n8:35 Comment: The team commands both ends.\n8:37 Comment: To bother, to put pressure on Chelsea to get out from behind because they are not comfortable.\n8:42 Comment: He's not finding Fabregas either.\n8:45 Comment: There are many people out there from VARLEY who are upset about Chelsea's clean exit.\n8:51 Comment: They indicated a foul to Diego Costa who was looking directly at the assistant\n8:55 Comment: which is the one who had marked that infraction.\n8:59 Comment: Tripier definitely couldn't control.\n9:2 Comment: Before Felipe Luis kicks the goal.\n9:5 Comment: Good start for the visiting team.\n9:10 Comment: Staging responding to what we mentioned right at the beginning.\n9:14 Comment: A competitive team with obvious limitations but competitive.\n9:20 Comment: That's what he's doing right now in these 10 minutes.\n9:25 Comment: The team of girls in the center.\n9:27 Comment: Of course, the numbers do not support him.\n9:29 Comment: Logically taking a quick look at the leaderboard.\n9:34 Comment: The VARLEY is second to last.\n9:36 Comment: VARLEY has many difficulties to add.\n9:40 Comment: So far only 21 points.\n9:42 Comment: It only has Leicester City behind.\n9:45 Comment: The VARLEY is second to last.\n9:47 Comment: VARLEY has many difficulties to add.\n9:50 Comment: So far only 21 points.\n9:52 Comment: It only has Leicester City behind.\n9:54 Comment: Away from home in the last 31 games they have played away from their stadium.\n10:3 Comment: They have only been able to win 2 with 5 draws and 24 losses.\n10:7 Comment: We are talking about home results for the last 31.\n10:10 Comment: Not only from this season but also from the previous one.\n10:14 Comment: But generous in its performance.\n10:19 Comment: And a team that, if they let it, will certainly go up.\n10:24 Comment: Not at all conservative.\n10:26 Comment: Chelsea are going to have to pick up the pace.\n10:31 Comment: Coming out a little dull, to be honest, from José Mourinho's team.\n10:36 Comment: There's Oscar.\n10:37 Comment: Óscar was trying to filter that ball for Hazard.\n10:40 Comment: That he was subjected to tremendous marking in the Champions League match.\n10:46 Comment: The player who received the most fouls.\n10:49 Comment: I think there were 15 in that game.\n10:51 Comment: Philippe's good cut.\n10:53 Comment: To that rise of Trippier.\n10:55 Comment: Connect Philippe with Diego Costa.\n10:57 Comment: Diego Costa, in his first start, faces Keen there.\n11:0 Comment: And Keen responds decisively, swatting that ball from the ground.\n11:5 Comment: Comme tu, Keen?\n11:6 Comment: I would say Starkin is looking forward to his first duel.\n11:10 Comment: A young boy like him, surely waiting for the first duel with Costa.\n11:14 Comment: He has resolved it well.\n11:17 Comment: The center belongs to Cesc.\n11:20 Comment: The ball falls to Cuadrado, who leans on Souma.\n11:24 Comment: This one with Ivanovic, another long trip.\n11:30 Comment: Trying to find Ivanovic in the back of the defense, but Cesc couldn't get there.\n11:34 Comment: It lacked precision, but the idea is good.\n11:37 Comment: The changes of orientation, running laterally to the rival, making him vascular.\n11:44 Comment: It's always a good idea.\n11:46 Comment: The thing is that the execution was bad.\n11:48 Comment: In the background we saw Remi, Keijil.\n11:51 Comment: We also saw Obi Mikel wearing a tie because he is officially the only one injured on the team.\n11:56 Comment: John Obi Mikel right now.\n11:59 Comment: A Chelsea that has only given up one draw in the League, but we must forget that they ended up losing to Bradford City in the FA Cup.\n12:12 Comment: Good move by Ings.\n12:14 Comment: Let's see that ball that was left behind.\n12:15 Comment: Arfield didn't manage to take him, but Danny Ings moved very well.\n12:21 Comment: This player who interests real society.\n12:24 Comment: And David Moyes must have very good references.\n12:29 Comment: You must know him especially well too, of course.\n12:37 Comment: The Sackwell Hit.\n12:41 Comment: That ball that remains in Souma's possession.\n12:44 Comment: Matic with Hazard.\n12:47 Comment: Matic from first to square.\n12:49 Comment: Let's see why Chelsea are now trying to deploy with speed.\n12:52 Comment: On the right was Diego Costa.\n12:54 Comment: The ball into the area.\n12:56 Comment: Hazard picks it up.\n12:57 Comment: Hazard square.\n12:59 Comment: The control was gone a lot.\n13:1 Comment: The South American who definitely steals that ball is still fighting there.\n13:5 Comment: Play again for Hazard.\n13:7 Comment: Already inside the area.\n13:8 Comment: What a fantastic maneuver by the Belgian.\n13:10 Comment: Ivanovic.\n13:11 Comment: Ivanovic scores again.\n13:13 Comment: Well, Ivanovic scores again.\n13:14 Comment: Although the player is from Eden Hazard.\n13:18 Comment: Minute 14 of the first half.\n13:21 Comment: Perhaps Barley is too soft in defense.\n13:23 Comment: But great individual action from Hazard.\n13:26 Comment: Ivanovic once again faithful to his appointment with the goal.\n13:29 Comment: Score the first for Chelsea 1-0.\n13:32 Comment: Yes, the Barley is going to be soft here.\n13:34 Comment: With that excessively easy turnover.\n13:37 Comment: Then Hazard's thing is impressive.\n13:40 Comment: Hazard's action is...\n13:42 Comment: Well, it's pure Hazard.\n13:44 Comment: The individual action, the start, the different changes of speed, the breaks.\n13:49 Comment: And then the perfect pass because Ivanovic sneaks in.\n13:52 Comment: No one marks him.\n13:53 Comment: And Hazard, with the eye in the back of his head, sees him perfectly.\n13:59 Comment: And he assists him.\n14:0 Comment: Being totally busy and busy with business.\n14:3 Comment: It seems incredible that Hazard could have the coldness and vision to know where his teammate was.\n14:9 Comment: And not only did he know it, but he put in a perfect ball.\n14:12 Comment: Well, Chelsea hadn't done much to be honest.\n14:14 Comment: I had a chance due to a great lateral center from Felipe Luis.\n14:17 Comment: But this was the first serious arrival and it scored.\n14:20 Comment: This can mark the game a lot.\n14:24 Comment: Chelsea has recovered again in the final third.\n14:26 Comment: Hazard's pass for Oscar.\n14:27 Comment: Oscar Launch.\n14:28 Comment: He doesn't catch the goalkeeper and it is the full-back Benmi who ends up keeping the danger away.\n14:34 Comment: He didn't catch Heaton.\n14:37 Comment: After that shot by Oscar in the 15th minute of play in this first half.\n14:42 Comment: As soon as Chelsea presses and increases the pace, the ball clearly crunches.\n14:50 Comment: Hazard plays again.\n14:52 Comment: Inviting Boyd to come out on the left.\n14:56 Comment: He puts pressure on Boyd who ends up snatching the ball from the skilled Chelsea player.\n15:6 Comment: Oscar.\n15:8 Comment: Chelsea's Brazilian insists again.\n15:11 Comment: Trying to surprise with that individual action.\n15:14 Comment: Clear Barley's backline.\n15:19 Comment: And indeed when Chelsea arrives at the top.\n15:23 Comment: The truth is that it falls apart.\n15:26 Comment: When the increase in rhythm occurs.\n15:28 Comment: When Chelsea starts to push.\n15:30 Comment: Start moving the ball faster.\n15:32 Comment: His players are starting to be more intense when it comes to trying to recover the loss.\n15:38 Comment: When all that happens.\n15:41 Comment: And the team that is technically and physically superior begins to add intensity.\n15:45 Comment: Well, it shows right away.\n15:47 Comment: Diego Costa opens to the left.\n15:48 Comment: Receiving Oscar's pass.\n15:51 Comment: Shackel closed there.\n15:55 Comment: And there will definitely be a corner kick.\n16:3 Comment: It's the fourth corner for Chelsea.\n16:7 Comment: Voted by Cesc Fàbregas.\n16:8 Comment: Now, Hiton manages to block that ball .\n16:12 Comment: A team that also suffers a lot.\n16:15 Comment: We're talking about Barley.\n16:17 Comment: In the face of the aerial game of the rival teams.\n16:20 Comment: He has conceded 16 headed goals.\n16:23 Comment: Clearly the team has had to play a good game for a long time.\n16:27 Comment: The ball to Arfield.\n16:29 Comment: The Scotsman putting the ball deep into the side.\n16:33 Comment: Tripper.\n16:34 Comment: Closed there Hazard.\n16:35 Comment: He touched Felipe Luis at the last distance.\n16:37 Comment: With which Chelsea concedes what will be the second corner kick of the game.\n16:43 Comment: For the Barley.\n16:45 Comment: And Chelsea concede the second corner.\n16:48 Comment: And the Barley.\n16:51 Comment: With which Chelsea concedes what will be the second corner kick of the game for Barley.\n17:0 Comment: There goes Shackle.\n17:4 Comment: With Boyd.\n17:5 Comment: There's also Dani Ings.\n17:8 Comment: Tripper.\n17:10 Comment: Ready to strike.\n17:11 Comment: There goes Trippier's service.\n17:13 Comment: And the high headbutt.\n17:16 Comment: It was a good hit.\n17:17 Comment: Barley's right back.\n17:19 Comment: Kieran Trippier.\n17:21 Comment: A former Manchester City player.\n17:23 Comment: He put all the balls in from the left and from the right.\n17:30 Comment: I had lost that ball there Michael Keane.\n17:35 Comment: And we see how the action ends.\n17:36 Comment: It didn't seem like too difficult a pitch there for Heaton.\n17:39 Comment: But it can't block.\n17:41 Comment: And if it doesn't happen to be on the Mi side.\n17:44 Comment: The E side.\n17:46 Comment: It arrived very quickly.\n17:50 Comment: Barley could have conceded on that play the second.\n17:55 Comment: Cuadrado left behind for Oscar.\n17:57 Comment: Today Cuadrado is replacing Willian who in the last two months had played practically everything at Chelsea.\n18:3 Comment: And entering a lot inside Cuadrado.\n18:4 Comment: With Ivanovic.\n18:6 Comment: Practically, I'm not going to say that he is a winger, but he is almost a right wing midfielder Ivanovic.\n18:11 Comment: How good Cuadrado left it for Hazard.\n18:13 Comment:  Diego Costa.\n18:15 Comment: Ivanovic's center first.\n18:17 Comment: Chelsea has now practically moved the first touch fluidly in the last stretch of the field.\n18:24 Comment: The finishing touch, the definition, was missing.\n18:27 Comment: But the action is very good.\n18:30 Comment: Yes, as often happens, Chelsea go to the wing and then try to finish inside.\n18:35 Comment: In the bands there are always very incisive people.\n18:39 Comment: People who, in addition to being fast, are good, have quality.\n18:43 Comment: And normally he relies a lot on that left zone with Hazard.\n18:48 Comment: But many times he goes there and then comes back and finishes the plays inside.\n18:53 Comment: Chelsea is not a team with a lot of centre-back.\n18:57 Comment: If not to the band, it is usually to go back to looking for interior areas.\n19:2 Comment: Felipe had stolen, but in the end he couldn't direct that step well towards Hazard.\n19:7 Comment: This may now cause Inks to leave.\n19:10 Comment: Inks isn't able to get that ball to Boyd either.\n19:13 Comment: Under pressure, he struggled, he held the ball well, relying first on Souma.\n19:17 Comment: And this one with Ivanovic before Courtois hit.\n19:20 Comment: Wow, what a detail.\n19:22 Comment: Back control without dropping that ball from Oscar who wanted to leave with the ball under control.\n19:28 Comment: Badly cleared.\n19:29 Comment: Now talking about Terry.\n19:31 Comment: He stole from Arfield.\n19:33 Comment: Arfield crashing into Terry there.\n19:35 Comment: Matic arrives, Inks on the ground.\n19:37 Comment: And Nemanja Matic who ends up recovering definitively.\n19:41 Comment: He gives ball to Mourinho's team.\n19:43 Comment: Oscar in depth towards Hazard.\n19:47 Comment: Schäckel runs to his side.\n19:51 Comment: But this is another of the things that Chelsea does to you.\n19:54 Comment: If you dare, you come forward, you give yourself the opportunity to score a good goal.\n19:59 Comment: You advance the lines and you dare to press him higher, as Burnley is doing by the way.\n20:5 Comment: For me, that action by Arfield is at least yellow.\n20:8 Comment: If you dare to go further up, there are people and they also have the habit of looking for that type of break behind your defense.\n20:21 Comment: They have very good pitchers and they have very powerful people who are going to find the space behind you.\n20:26 Comment: And in that, Chelsea is one of the best teams in the world for me.\n20:32 Comment: In the facet of alternating positional play, the positional attack with the quick transition that, I insist, in terms of the rival, goes a little upward, as Burnley is doing.\n20:45 Comment: And to put pressure there, logically, is advancing the lines.\n20:48 Comment: Chelsea is a team that very easily, with Diego Costa, with Hazard, with Cuadrado, with Willian, finds spaces for you.\n20:56 Comment: With great ease.\n20:59 Comment: Felipe loses now.\n21:1 Comment: Throw-in for Burnley.\n21:6 Comment: Kieran Trippier.\n21:11 Comment: While there his coach was almost telling him to play forward.\n21:16 Comment: He didn't do it like that.\n21:18 Comment: Received Jones.\n21:20 Comment: Jones with Shackel and this one for Michael Keane.\n21:23 Comment: Shackel Keane.\n21:25 Comment: Arfil.\n21:27 Comment: Tripper.\n21:29 Comment: It took a little while to hit.\n21:31 Comment: He almost lost that ball. Boitante Felipe protected it.\n21:34 Comment: Arfil again.\n21:36 Comment: Trippier playing towards Shackel.\n21:38 Comment: Open this one towards Benme.\n21:41 Comment: Me with Jones.\n21:44 Comment: Chelsea always closes well with two on each wing.\n21:47 Comment:  With alot of work.\n21:49 Comment: Mourinho has always insisted a lot on that to the midfielders.\n21:51 Comment: Straight now Trippier looking for Burns.\n21:54 Comment: Burns who runs into Zouma.\n21:56 Comment: They both protest.\n21:58 Comment: The referee indicates absolutely nothing.\n22:0 Comment: And the one who gets there is Kitely.\n22:2 Comment: Kitely with Mee.\n22:4 Comment: Burns, finishing option.\n22:6 Comment: Well, perhaps he had oriented himself well.\n22:8 Comment: Then he rushed a little at the moment of the hit.\n22:12 Comment: But the maneuver to turn was not bad.\n22:17 Comment: By Ashley Burns.\n22:22 Comment: That he had ended up hooked up just 10 seconds earlier with Zouma.\n22:27 Comment: On that play.\n22:29 Comment: Even from Costa.\n22:31 Comment: Diego Costa is under the microscope.\n22:34 Comment: Before, also in a maneuver where, at least live in the plane, Masters had barely moved.\n22:41 Comment: The assistant had told him he was missing and the Spanish-Brazilian had become very angry.\n22:45 Comment: And you're going to have to be very patient.\n22:49 Comment: And be very careful.\n22:51 Comment: And be very careful now.\n22:53 Comment: He was punished for very ugly gestures.\n22:55 Comment: To leave your leg, to step on a rival.\n22:57 Comment: And it doesn't surprise me that the magnifying glass is put on him.\n23:5 Comment: There's Hazard.\n23:9 Comment: Leave Oscar.\n23:11 Comment: Ball back.\n23:13 Comment: Zouma.\n23:15 Comment: There's the Burley.\n23:17 Comment: He remains faithful to his principle of trying to wait very high for Chelsea.\n23:22 Comment: Chelsea already turn it.\n23:24 Comment: That is to say, the Burley is placed at a good height, as we have said.\n23:28 Comment: He doesn't want to bother.\n23:30 Comment: But as soon as Chelsea makes two or three passes.\n23:32 Comment: It makes him spin.\n23:34 Comment: And it already makes him enter the transition to Burley.\n23:37 Comment: Start defending by running backwards.\n23:40 Comment: This was the play for Chelsea's goal.\n23:42 Comment: Although it had a second part.\n23:44 Comment: And it was prolonged with that recovery.\n23:48 Comment: Almost on the side of the area.\n23:51 Comment: But the beginning of Chelsea's play was like that.\n23:54 Comment:  We'll see.\n23:56 Comment: There's Hazard.\n23:58 Comment: Hazard made a good move towards Ivanovic.\n24:0 Comment: Ivanovic, the Serb's center is not good now.\n24:2 Comment: Very passable.\n24:4 Comment: Well, the Burley has to be very careful.\n24:6 Comment: Because simply with that transfer, Gaby.\n24:8 Comment: What it has caused is that the entire team has left again.\n24:12 Comment: He would go up again.\n24:14 Comment: This is what we are saying.\n24:16 Comment: The Burley has its lines at one point on the field.\n24:18 Comment: In which Chelsea with relative ease.\n24:21 Comment: Because they are very good.\n24:23 Comment: They overcome the first line of pressure.\n24:25 Comment: And therefore they already make the rival turn.\n24:27 Comment: He's already starting to defend while running backwards.\n24:30 Comment: It's the Burley choice.\n24:32 Comment: That could have the lines much further back.\n24:34 Comment: And be waiting for Chelsea much further back.\n24:36 Comment: But he has chosen to try to defend like that.\n24:39 Comment: It connected Burns with Inks.\n24:40 Comment: And while this opens towards Keighley.\n24:43 Comment: Keighley couldn't control that ball at the beginning.\n24:46 Comment: But he did play it towards me.\n24:49 Comment: While it's Saura Jones.\n24:51 Comment: The one who tries to find an accurate pass.\n24:54 Comment: Towards Arfield.\n24:56 Comment: Arfield with Trippier.\n24:59 Comment: Tripper.\n25:2 Comment: Play towards Schäckel.\n25:4 Comment: Schäckel again with Jones.\n25:6 Comment: Chelsea allows Burley to reach a certain height.\n25:8 Comment: With some comfort.\n25:10 Comment: I think Chelsea are even interested.\n25:12 Comment: Well Inks with that volley towards Trippier.\n25:15 Comment: The ball that goes wide.\n25:17 Comment: And Keighley hasn't hit the ball.\n25:20 Comment: When he arrived all alone.\n25:22 Comment: A detour occurred.\n25:24 Comment: A change in the trajectory of the ball.\n25:26 Comment: After the center of Trippier.\n25:28 Comment: We'll see it here after it unloads to the right.\n25:30 Comment: Dani Inks.\n25:32 Comment: Well, Felipe Luis came out to score.\n25:34 Comment: This time Eden Hazard.\n25:36 Comment: He hasn't been involved.\n25:38 Comment: In defensive action.\n25:40 Comment: We have seen it clearly.\n25:42 Comment: In aerial repetition.\n25:44 Comment: Like Eden Hazard was a spectator.\n25:46 Comment: And that's exactly where the Burley went to look for.\n25:48 Comment: Logically.\n25:50 Comment: In Chelsea's weak zone.\n25:52 Comment: With Felipe Luis who I insist had gone out to score.\n25:54 Comment: Eden Hazard had not come to help.\n25:56 Comment: And that's where Trippier appeared.\n25:58 Comment: He has an excellent ball strike.\n26:0 Comment: And he puts very good lateral centers.\n26:2 Comment: And that is where the problem has arisen for Burley.\n26:4 Comment: To Chelsea.\n26:6 Comment: With that lateral center.\n26:8 Comment: And it has been very well received by Chelsea.\n26:10 Comment: We were talking about the commitment of the Chelsea midfielders.\n26:12 Comment: In defensive phase.\n26:14 Comment: How they help in the band.\n26:16 Comment: But it is true that there are still actions.\n26:18 Comment: In which Eden Hazard or William.\n26:20 Comment: Or this type of footballer.\n26:22 Comment: You have some disconnect.\n26:24 Comment: And they are not always infallible.\n26:26 Comment: When it comes to going down and helping your sides.\n26:29 Comment: Abrión sixth.\n26:31 Comment: Towards Oscar.\n26:33 Comment: Oscar Cuadrado.\n26:35 Comment: The loose ball.\n26:36 Comment: Oscar.\n26:38 Comment: The Brazilian recovers again.\n26:40 Comment: For Fàbregas.\n26:42 Comment: It's there.\n26:44 Comment: Trying to play towards Hazard.\n26:46 Comment: Which ended up losing.\n26:48 Comment: Burns.\n26:50 Comment: Leave it to Ings.\n26:52 Comment: You moved very well, Ings.\n26:54 Comment:  Again.\n26:56 Comment: He has that speed to turn.\n26:58 Comment: And to leave with the ball under control.\n27:0 Comment: Although this time he ended up losing.\n27:2 Comment: That's Fàbregas.\n27:4 Comment: Not right.\n27:6 Comment: It's a game that I hadn't been at 100% physically.\n27:9 Comment: It's Fàbregas in the Champions League match.\n27:11 Comment: Against PSG.\n27:13 Comment: Well, Enrique.\n27:15 Comment: That is already a very important indication.\n27:17 Comment: That makes it clear to us to what extent.\n27:19 Comment: Fàbregas is important for this team.\n27:21 Comment: And I believe.\n27:23 Comment: That has been proven.\n27:25 Comment: In the absence of Fàbregas.\n27:27 Comment: How important it is.\n27:29 Comment: In any case, I like Fàbregas better.\n27:31 Comment: When it starts further back.\n27:33 Comment: The other day in Paris he played more of a midfielder.\n27:34 Comment: Yes because he played with Matic and with Ramírez.\n27:36 Comment:  Exactly.\n27:38 Comment: And I like Fàbregas better.\n27:40 Comment: The more field of vision you have.\n27:42 Comment: Because also.\n27:44 Comment: He starts there.\n27:46 Comment: We see you there.\n27:48 Comment: There you receive.\n27:50 Comment: He has a lot of ability to put his team's game together.\n27:52 Comment: But then he knows how to reach three quarters too.\n27:54 Comment:  That is to say.\n27:56 Comment: Not necessarily by putting him in the middle.\n27:58 Comment: You lose him for the last pass.\n28:0 Comment: You can have him too.\n28:2 Comment: I like Fàbregas' version more box to box.\n28:4 Comment:  That is to say.\n28:6 Comment: Continue looking to descend quite high up the Barli.\n28:10 Comment: We see it here.\n28:12 Comment: Any opportunity for Barli is good.\n28:15 Comment: To go up.\n28:17 Comment: To press.\n28:19 Comment: Generous in his efforts.\n28:21 Comment: Tic's team again.\n28:23 Comment: With Ings and Barnes up there.\n28:25 Comment: But also the midfield line.\n28:27 Comment: Advancing your position.\n28:29 Comment:  That is to say.\n28:31 Comment: It's backed pressure.\n28:32 Comment: Press as a team.\n28:34 Comment:  Very good.\n28:36 Comment: Now it has worked.\n28:38 Comment: He got the ball back.\n28:40 Comment: And he has recovered it in the rival field.\n28:42 Comment: Not at high altitude.\n28:44 Comment: But yes in the rival field.\n28:46 Comment: Boyd with Trippier.\n28:48 Comment: Tripier doesn't specify well.\n28:50 Comment: The advantage goes to Terry.\n28:52 Comment: Keightley was fighting there.\n28:54 Comment: Now Keightley has changed bands.\n28:56 Comment: And Diego Costa's foul on Trippier.\n28:58 Comment: Diego Costa is a little more aware of actions.\n29:0 Comment: Or the instructions of the equipment.\n29:2 Comment: Or the referees.\n29:4 Comment: That's another matter.\n29:6 Comment: In its least effective version.\n29:8 Comment: When he sulks.\n29:10 Comment: He is a player who loses great effectiveness.\n29:13 Comment: Great waste of effectiveness.\n29:16 Comment: Tripper.\n29:18 Comment: Terry was jumping there on Barnes.\n29:20 Comment: Referee Martin Atkinson did not see a punishable action by the defender here.\n29:25 Comment:  Diego Costa.\n29:27 Comment: Wanting to leave to get married.\n29:29 Comment: From the ground Diego Costa.\n29:30 Comment: That ball went square.\n29:32 Comment: Chelsea insists on Matic-Casar.\n29:34 Comment: And now Oscar.\n29:36 Comment: Oscar's center.\n29:38 Comment: And they have cleared first Sackel.\n29:41 Comment: While King leaves the ball for Hilton.\n29:46 Comment: Tom Hilton.\n29:48 Comment: The game comes to all of this around the half hour mark.\n29:51 Comment: Let's see why Ivanovic's cry of pain was heard.\n29:54 Comment: On that jump.\n29:56 Comment: I was exaggerating a little.\n29:58 Comment: Just as he got up, yes.\n30:0 Comment: And that was the player who was involved in the action.\n30:3 Comment: Yes, maybe she left him.\n30:5 Comment: Yes, he kicked him.\n30:7 Comment: He hit him with a kick that was yellow at least.\n30:10 Comment: Burnley is being quite tough in concrete actions.\n30:14 Comment: For me there should be at least two yellows.\n30:17 Comment: To their footballers.\n30:19 Comment: But the referee at the moment doesn't want to know anything.\n30:22 Comment: Philip.\n30:24 Comment: Felipe, excellent maneuver to connect again with Casar.\n30:31 Comment: Oscar.\n30:33 Comment: Philip.\n30:35 Comment: Felipe Luis, Diego Costa comes out from the inside.\n30:37 Comment: And the one who didn't follow the play was Oscar.\n30:39 Comment: Because it was wide open.\n30:41 Comment: That ball again towards the sideline.\n30:43 Comment: And Oscar stood completely still.\n30:45 Comment: The action did not continue at any time.\n30:48 Comment: Mourinho angry.\n30:51 Comment: Because it's already 30 minutes.\n30:53 Comment: The team is winning.\n30:55 Comment: But the feeling of...\n30:56 Comment: Maybe the team is going at 60%, 70%.\n31:0 Comment: Yes, it had a peak.\n31:2 Comment: Chelsea had a peak of intensity.\n31:4 Comment: The one where he scored the goal.\n31:7 Comment: He created a couple of very clear chances.\n31:10 Comment: But he found it so easy again that the team has returned to another small valley in terms of intensity.\n31:17 Comment: Diego Costa anticipates.\n31:19 Comment: Jones can score.\n31:21 Comment: It ends up opening square.\n31:23 Comment: He asks for it back.\n31:24 Comment: Ivanovic.\n31:26 Comment: Ivanovic coming again.\n31:28 Comment: They asked for a hand.\n31:30 Comment: He does it clearly and ostensibly.\n31:32 Comment: The Serbian side.\n31:34 Comment: Who complains bitterly that this decision did not end with the 11 meters.\n31:39 Comment: I honestly couldn't appreciate it live.\n31:42 Comment:  Me neither.\n31:44 Comment: Let's watch some replay.\n31:46 Comment: With that square ball back for Branislav Ivanovic's shot.\n31:51 Comment: He was jumping now, King.\n31:54 Comment: Jones was playing.\n31:56 Comment: He tries to control her.\n31:58 Comment: Cesc Fàbregas fouled the Catalan player.\n32:2 Comment: To Diego Costa in the disputes the Valle center-backs go with their rear-view mirrors open.\n32:7 Comment: And that is driving Diego Costa crazy.\n32:10 Comment: Because they are...\n32:12 Comment: We often talk about the term ankle scratching.\n32:14 Comment: Well, they are scratching Costa's ears and neck with their elbows.\n32:18 Comment: Without elbowing him.\n32:19 Comment: But the Valley power plants are doing a job...\n32:24 Comment: What can you call it?\n32:26 Comment: A nerve-racking job.\n32:29 Comment: Of intimidating Diego Costa to get him mad.\n32:33 Comment: I think they are getting it.\n32:35 Comment: Diego Costa is quite nervous.\n32:37 Comment: And every dispute comes out with a hot ear.\n32:41 Comment:  Diego Costa.\n32:43 Comment: Well, that's the toll that Diego Costa will surely have to pay.\n32:48 Comment: They're going to do it.\n32:50 Comment: They've probably done it to him in many games.\n32:52 Comment: In the Premier this year.\n32:54 Comment: Let's go see Gaby.\n32:56 Comment: Let's see Ivanovic's pitch.\n32:58 Comment: Clear penalty.\n33:0 Comment: Knightley's outstretched arm.\n33:2 Comment: Very clear penalty.\n33:4 Comment: There we have it.\n33:6 Comment: I think the hand is very clear.\n33:8 Comment: He is on his back but his arm is extended, not in a natural position.\n33:10 Comment: There is precisely Knightley looking for the center.\n33:14 Comment: Yellow penalty too.\n33:16 Comment: That would be three yellow cards that the Valley should have.\n33:19 Comment: If we weren't seeing such permissive arbitration.\n33:22 Comment: Of course this same game in a more Latin league...\n33:28 Comment: ...I would already have three yellow cards at least.\n33:35 Comment: Minute 34 of the game.\n33:37 Comment: From this first time.\n33:39 Comment: Enjoy another corner kick to the Valley.\n33:41 Comment: There goes Trippier.\n33:43 Comment: Touching that ball that Courtois doesn't block.\n33:45 Comment: It's still in the area.\n33:47 Comment: Sackel is going to pick her up.\n33:49 Comment: Sackel the center back increasingly leaning next to the flag.\n33:52 Comment: Philippe arrived to drive that ball down the sideline.\n33:55 Comment: And a scare there for Chelsea's Belgian goalkeeper.\n33:59 Comment: What a hit Trippier has.\n34:1 Comment: He's putting in some sensational balls from both sides.\n34:4 Comment: And from the two flags.\n34:6 Comment: Robberies is Favregas.\n34:8 Comment: Diego Costa was already launched.\n34:11 Comment: Sackel cut.\n34:16 Comment: And the takeoff now of John Terry.\n34:24 Comment: Trippier to the throw-in.\n34:32 Comment: There we see him with four, five players in front of the Valley's ball line.\n34:39 Comment: No, Matic didn't get to play.\n34:42 Comment: So it becomes directly a goal ball for Chelsea.\n34:47 Comment: We see Trippier's beating.\n34:49 Comment: It's true that Terry falls.\n34:53 Comment: Yes, yes, it's Terry who falls.\n34:55 Comment: I think it's thrown away.\n34:57 Comment: Feel the touch of a Burnley player.\n34:59 Comment: I think Terry exaggerates a lot.\n35:1 Comment: And he throws himself thinking that they are going to call the well-known foul in attack\n35:5 Comment: which the referees like so much.\n35:6 Comment: But they don't whistle it.\n35:8 Comment: Let's see Jones' hit.\n35:10 Comment: Inks' quick exit.\n35:12 Comment: Philip is also quick and fast enough to ward off danger.\n35:17 Comment: With Hazard returning to the side again.\n35:20 Comment: Clip there about Boyd.\n35:22 Comment: High pressure again.\n35:24 Comment: How good, Cés Favregas, how you have simplified with that triangulation.\n35:27 Comment: Chelsea is coming out now with speed and space.\n35:30 Comment: Oscar faced Keane there.\n35:33 Comment: Continue Oscar.\n35:34 Comment: Oscar stops Matic.\n35:36 Comment: Esturdo was not suited to throw with his good leg.\n35:41 Comment: And it was incredibly noticeable because that position was magnificent for a right-hander.\n35:46 Comment: To try to shoot at goal.\n35:49 Comment: Now, how to break the pressure of an entire team with one touch.\n35:52 Comment: This is how this exit from behind Chelsea would be titled.\n35:55 Comment: Oscar deflects Diego Costa offside.\n35:58 Comment: Yes, offside.\n36:0 Comment: Favregas' touch is impressive.\n36:1 Comment: I want to stop a little bit and underline it because I would love for them to repeat it to us.\n36:7 Comment: Because in the face of good pressure, which is what Burnley is doing,\n36:11 Comment: It's not perfect, but I think it has a good level.\n36:15 Comment: Chelsea came out with a simple touch,\n36:18 Comment: Thanks to Favregas' mastery of space and vision and ability to play first,\n36:25 Comment: who with a simple touch has dismantled a very good position.\n36:28 Comment: It's just that what was, as they say, Gaby, a hot potato,\n36:32 Comment: a compromised ball, an absolute brown.\n36:35 Comment: Exactly, that ball was a brown one and he practically turned it into a counterattack.\n36:40 Comment: Oscar leaves the ball behind Gott-Jones to snatch the ball from him.\n36:45 Comment: He didn't have enough precision in that start, in that offensive transition to Oscar,\n36:50 Comment: while Souma is lying on the field.\n36:53 Comment: Leave the leg to Burns.\n36:55 Comment: Another message.\n36:57 Comment: Burnley in this sense are competing quite hard, I get the feeling.\n37:2 Comment: And the referee is not punishing her.\n37:8 Comment: Burnley is crossing some red lines, especially in disputes.\n37:14 Comment: We're talking about elbows, some titles, some blows,\n37:18 Comment: But there is no dispute.\n37:20 Comment: We're talking about elbows, some titles, some blows,\n37:24 Comment: In the disputes, Burnley is leaving messages that the referee is not knowing how to punish.\n37:31 Comment: I think that the referee is simply the one who is finding out.\n37:35 Comment: This is the action of the goal.\n37:37 Comment: The moment this player starts, everything is possible.\n37:41 Comment: I think it's also a bit of a blow, I don't know if it's a semi-final,\n37:45 Comment: He hits it with his ankle more than his foot, Ivanovic gives me the feeling there.\n37:49 Comment: Actually it fits perfectly, because as it enters...\n37:54 Comment: But what a move by Hasard.\n37:57 Comment: It is Ivanovic's fourth goal in the last seven games between the League and the Cup.\n38:4 Comment: Besides, it marks the first, the first is always more valuable,\n38:9 Comment: Because of what it means to open the game, to break a tied duel.\n38:18 Comment: This goal is valuable, as is the one during the week at the Parc des Princes for Chelsea.\n38:26 Comment: How he made it profitable later.\n38:29 Comment: He made that goal profitable from that minute until the end of the match.\n38:34 Comment: In fact, Chelsea didn't want to play anymore from then on.\n38:37 Comment: He proposed to defend and when the tie occurred he proposed the tie.\n38:44 Comment: Losing the election from previous years.\n38:47 Comment: Hilton has gone long looking for Inks.\n38:50 Comment: Chelsea had a great safety cushion there.\n38:54 Comment: Terry had cut first.\n38:57 Comment: And now Boyd deflected after Felipe Luis hit.\n39:1 Comment: Well, we are approaching the end of the first part.\n39:4 Comment: Chelsea wins 1-0.\n39:7 Comment: A match where at the moment Mourinho's team is doing just enough to win.\n39:11 Comment: But without yet having assured victory, victory.\n39:18 Comment: Because the marker is so minimal.\n39:22 Comment: Anything that involves winning 1-0 is always very dangerous.\n39:33 Comment: Philip for Oscar.\n39:36 Comment: Oscar left Kacar there, Cuadrado intervenes.\n39:40 Comment: Look where Ivanovic is.\n39:42 Comment: It's extreme right now.\n39:44 Comment: Opening the field permanently.\n39:48 Comment: And Square that goes inward.\n39:52 Comment: A movement that certainly is not seen in all Chelsea games.\n39:56 Comment: That Ivanovic is permanently so high.\n39:58 Comment: Another tough inning.\n40:0 Comment: Now the first one is going to arrive.\n40:1 Comment: Because he was leaving Boyd, Oscar.\n40:5 Comment: The entry is very clear.\n40:7 Comment: But this one is more obvious.\n40:9 Comment: That is, even a halfway good referee.\n40:13 Comment: Not to say a worse word.\n40:16 Comment: Even bad referees see this.\n40:20 Comment: The others are more...\n40:23 Comment: Subtle.\n40:25 Comment: I think that many times the referee is not even seen.\n40:27 Comment: I don't know if this is the case, but many times...\n40:30 Comment: Some referees feel like they haven't played football even as children.\n40:34 Comment: Because they often understand the player so little.\n40:38 Comment: There goes Oscar. Oscar the wall with Cesc Fàbregas.\n40:41 Comment: Cesc Fàbregas turns, serves quickly to the other side.\n40:44 Comment: Where Ivanovic is, Cuadrado offers himself in that unmarking to win the baseline.\n40:48 Comment: We closed the game.\n40:50 Comment: And here it goes to the final.\n40:53 Comment: Ivanovic offers Cuadrado in that unmarking to win the baseline.\n40:57 Comment: We closed Schäckel.\n40:59 Comment: Continue Cuadrado. Cuadrado and Ivanovic.\n41:1 Comment: Well played by both of you.\n41:3 Comment: Servio's cut was excellent. The center from below.\n41:5 Comment: Trying to surprise Spejman's Balkan.\n41:8 Comment: Mee recovers Cuadrado again at the height of the vertex of the area.\n41:12 Comment: Chelsea bottle Barley right now.\n41:16 Comment: It gives the feeling that when he accelerates, when he puts it...\n41:20 Comment: ...that extra point of speed, the team can easily solve the plays.\n41:31 Comment: Square towards Matic.\n41:36 Comment: Matic relies on Cesc.\n41:40 Comment: Square again. Matic. Matic towards Óscar.\n41:45 Comment: Let's see there Cesc Fàbregas was trying to unmark Ivanovic.\n41:49 Comment: It opens up space for Cuadrado.\n41:51 Comment: But he can't handle Keighley.\n41:55 Comment: Keighley barely arrives in time to keep the ball in play.\n41:59 Comment: But to make Chelsea's recovery easier again.\n42:2 Comment: Ivanovic. Square.\n42:4 Comment: There goes the center of Cuadrado.\n42:7 Comment: Tripierre ends up forcing the corner.\n42:13 Comment: Well, good move by Chelsea.\n42:19 Comment: What does the second one want before reaching the break?\n42:24 Comment: We remember the difficulties that Barley has in the aerial game.\n42:29 Comment: Now he served well at the height of the first post.\n42:31 Comment: Oscar plays again towards Eden Hazard.\n42:33 Comment: Hazard has Boit in front of him.\n42:35 Comment: Cesc again with Hazard. He left him to control the ball.\n42:39 Comment: He had a great time.\n42:41 Comment: And the Barley ended up removing the danger.\n42:50 Comment: Filipe with Courtois.\n42:56 Comment: The long Courtois looking for Ivanovic.\n43:0 Comment: Mee came in hard.\n43:2 Comment: There's Barnes.\n43:4 Comment: He is using his body a lot and has already left a couple of ugly tackles.\n43:11 Comment: And also a couple of shots towards Courtois' goal.\n43:15 Comment: Ings with Keighley.\n43:16 Comment: It surprises us at Cesc Fàbregas.\n43:19 Comment: Jones is very attentive to steal that ball before Diego Costa arrived.\n43:24 Comment: And Filipe closing the band well against Trippier.\n43:31 Comment: Very firm there Filipe Luis.\n43:36 Comment: Ivanovic with Hazard.\n43:43 Comment: Diego Costa's unmarking maneuver.\n43:46 Comment: Persecuted by Saquel.\n43:48 Comment: Diego Costa who leaves with that controlled ball.\n43:51 Comment: He falls and the referee says let the action continue, let the game continue.\n43:57 Comment: Steal Filipe from Boit.\n43:59 Comment: And now we comment.\n44:1 Comment: The actions regarding Diego Costa are going to have to be very clear.\n44:5 Comment: Because of what we are seeing in this match, the referee decides in favor of the Chelsea player.\n44:11 Comment: Diego Costa was playing, he was trying to play towards Oscar.\n44:15 Comment: The last one to play is Hazard.\n44:17 Comment: My live feeling is that it has been dropped.\n44:22 Comment: That's what it seemed to me.\n44:24 Comment: Now maybe the image denies us.\n44:26 Comment: For me yes, for me it falls.\n44:28 Comment: Because there is slight contact from the defender.\n44:32 Comment: And here we are always with subjectivity.\n44:35 Comment: Only Diego Costa knows to what extent the defender's contact can make him fall to the ground like that.\n44:42 Comment: It seems to me that Diego Costa is very nervous.\n44:44 Comment: He's been very nervous the whole game.\n44:46 Comment: There we are reading your lips.\n44:48 Comment: He's saying real outrageous things.\n44:50 Comment: He is fighting against the world.\n44:52 Comment: How bad this version is.\n44:54 Comment: How well Cholo controlled all these things.\n44:57 Comment: Because they were there latent.\n44:59 Comment: I have the feeling, Gaby, that Diego Costa is not in the game.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: the second half, Chelsea handling the ball on the left of the image, Barley on the right\n0:6 Comment: with Cesc Fàbregas and Casar trying to connect there with Óscar\n0:10 Comment: Matic arrived, from the ground Barnes managed to direct that ball towards Jones, Jones is now playing with Mee\n0:19 Comment: the side pressured by Cuadrado, relying on Michael King\n0:26 Comment: in Sakel, sorry, Sakel, Jason, Sakel who was looking for the long one to Dannings\n0:34 Comment: Well, and one of the players of the match, or probably the player of the match, is Bratislav Ivanovic\n0:40 Comment: because not only has he scored the goal, but he has had an almost constant offensive presence in that position\n0:45 Comment: very free of work, with Zouma who is a very fast central defender and who tilts a little to the right\n0:54 Comment: so that Ivanovic goes almost to the right, but does not go almost to the right\n0:56 Comment: the winger position and Cuadrado gets inside\n1:0 Comment: Let's see if Chelsea is also going to look for that in the second half.\n1:4 Comment: There was an offside position, Ivanovic was also in the action in which there was a very clear handball by Keitly inside the area\n1:14 Comment: not sanctioned by the referee, in fact Chelsea have vehemently demanded two penalties\n1:21 Comment: Keitly's hand and a fall from Diego Costa\n1:26 Comment: a race with Sakel\n1:28 Comment: First I saw it clearly, the second not so much\n1:30 Comment: although it is true that the play leaves me doubts\n1:34 Comment: He has not been able to advance that ball, he struggles, but he has enough skill to finally keep the ball\n1:41 Comment: He had seen the appearance of Juan Cuadrado on the right wing, he could not get the ball to the South American player\n1:51 Comment: Sakel's goal for Barley, minute two of this\n1:56 Comment: second part\n1:57 Comment: When Tom Heaton finishes playing short towards Míhal he is finally going to decide to put that ball long\n2:14 Comment: heaton beating\n2:17 Comment: looking for barnes\n2:20 Comment: Inks gets there controlling Souma although he ends up losing that ball\n2:25 Comment: Jota also recovers it\n2:26 Comment: Jones for Sakel\n2:28 Comment: Sakel with Me\n2:31 Comment: sending me\n2:35 Comment: Barnes jumped, bad clearance by Souma\n2:39 Comment: Barnes made fast play towards Danny Inks\n2:43 Comment: the ball did not reach the forward\n2:45 Comment: while Diego Costa already connects with Oscar Cuadrado on the right\n2:48 Comment: the ball behind the Colombian's back\n2:50 Comment: He did not look for the ball in space but almost at the foot\n2:55 Comment: and of course, the ball has not been put in space\n2:56 Comment: if it was the fate it wasacaksın\n2:58 Comment: He\n3:6 Comment: after the proposals ok\n3:8 Comment: It's what's coming\n3:12 Comment: More now that he is losing and has to attack\n3:15 Comment: 7\n3:16 Comment: to Sunday\n3:18 Comment: tero\n3:20 Comment: now at the end\n3:21 Comment: Timberlett\n3:22 Comment: what is part of a square\n3:22 Comment: toronto\n3:24 Comment: 2\n3:24 Comment: Make a mix\n3:25 Comment: lancer\n3:25 Comment: to the pile\n3:26 Comment: Just because of its initial approach, it is already a team that leaves space behind you and that is Chelsea.\n3:32 Comment: and he knows how to take advantage of it very well and he is going to try to take advantage of the lack of inks.\n3:48 Comment: We are going to see the action repeated again if it is Oscar's turn clearly from behind at the height of\n3:54 Comment: the twin the very

the appearance of Eden Hazard.\n11:57 Comment: Ivanovic is free on the right.\n11:59 Comment: Willing to arrive and finish.\n12:1 Comment: Something that is not usual for Mourinho.\n12:3 Comment: But right now both sides are incorporated at the same time.\n12:6 Comment: Filipe on the left.\n12:7 Comment: Ivanovic is here on the right giving width.\n12:11 Comment: Matic did not lose it.\n12:13 Comment: Play square.\n12:14 Comment: And Ivanovic square again.\n12:19 Comment: Ivanovic.\n12:21 Comment: Oscar went into space, into space.\n12:24 Comment: Diego Costa Square.\n12:25 Comment: The touch towards Oscar.\n12:27 Comment: Keane cleared from the ground.\n12:29 Comment: Ivanovic's center.\n12:30 Comment: And Diego Costa in a very complicated position.\n12:34 Comment: He tried to touch, to deflect it just right.\n12:37 Comment: The Hispanic Brazilian did not arrive on time.\n12:40 Comment: But again a very dangerous situation.\n12:43 Comment: Diego, Diego.\n12:44 Comment: Chelsea now playing a good stretch of the game.\n12:49 Comment: Going one way.\n12:51 Comment: If you can't find it, go for the other one.\n12:53 Comment: With that patience that the team debuts this year.\n12:56 Comment: In the sense that it is a team with a much brighter positional attack than last year.\n13:5 Comment: I believe in a very good evolution for José Mourinho.\n13:11 Comment: And a great decision.\n13:13 Comment: Give the team this greater...\n13:14 Comment: Ability to attack positionally.\n13:18 Comment: And Fabregas certainly in that sense.\n13:20 Comment: It is an absolutely key signing.\n13:26 Comment: Strategic I would say.\n13:27 Comment: To expand the range of possibilities of the team.\n13:34 Comment: Today with perhaps a more secondary role.\n13:37 Comment: Cesc Fabregas as well as the other day in the Parc des Princes.\n13:42 Comment: Let's say not everything is happening today.\n13:44 Comment: By Cesc Fabregas.\n13:45 Comment: But there is no doubt that...\n13:46 Comment: Because Vanley's high pressure often covers him up.\n13:49 Comment: I haven't seen.\n13:51 Comment: And yes, I have noticed this is the penalty action that is very clear.\n13:55 Comment: The penalty not called.\n13:56 Comment: This is the one that I still think is Diego Costa.\n14:0 Comment: With the power it has and how good it is in that type of actions in the race.\n14:4 Comment: I was more thinking about going to the ground.\n14:7 Comment: The play being very complicated.\n14:11 Comment: I was trying to direct that ball from above.\n14:13 Comment: And then to Barnes towards Inks.\n14:15 Comment: Chelsea closes safely behind.\n14:18 Comment: Felipe leaves for Hazard.\n14:20 Comment: Hazard's pass.\n14:21 Comment: Fantastic towards Diego Costa.\n14:23 Comment: At the Cuadrado penalty spot.\n14:24 Comment: Cuadrado has tried to define heel.\n14:28 Comment: It practically demolishes that play.\n14:30 Comment: And he has been close to being able to achieve it.\n14:33 Comment: Fantastic Hazard with Diego Costa and the appearance of Cuadrado.\n14:36 Comment: Two passes.\n14:38 Comment: Chelsea.\n14:38 Comment: Such and in the area where the Vanley has its lines.\n14:43 Comment: Chelsea with two passes finds the back of the visiting defense.\n14:48 Comment: And it puts together an action in less than two seconds.\n14:52 Comment: Those are obviously the risks when you play against a team like that.\n14:57 Comment: And you don't get behind.\n14:58 Comment: What a detail now also from Keitly.\n15:1 Comment: Inks loses to Matic.\n15:4 Comment: Boyd about to rob.\n15:5 Comment: There they are Sez.\n15:7 Comment: Sez advances towards Diego Costa.\n15:9 Comment: Diego Costa with Hazard.\n15:11 Comment: Hazard again Diego Costa.\n15:12 Comment: Diego Costa.\n15:13 Comment: Ball back.\n15:15 Comment: Mee picks her up.\n15:16 Comment: Jones protects against the arrival of Hazard.\n15:18 Comment: Diego Costa wants to score all the goals he missed during his suspension.\n15:23 Comment: And it's a little accelerated.\n15:27 Comment: Matic pass.\n15:27 Comment: It didn't make it to Oscar.\n15:29 Comment: He also knows that he is facing one of the weakest rivals.\n15:34 Comment: It's like that anxiety to score.\n15:40 Comment: Matic with Filipe.\n15:41 Comment: Filipe towards Sez.\n15:43 Comment: Sez pressured by Jones.\n15:46 Comment: The ball that was left in Terry's possession.\n15:48 Comment: Sez intervenes again.\n15:49 Comment: Fabregas towards Matic.\n15:50 Comment: Matic for Souma.\n15:54 Comment: Souma opens towards Hazard's position.\n15:56 Comment: Now changed bands.\n15:58 Comment: Now to the right.\n15:59 Comment: Looking for the diagonal.\n16:0 Comment: Coming out against Arfield.\n16:2 Comment: Square with Filipe.\n16:7 Comment: Filipe Luis continues.\n16:9 Comment: Leave behind for Cuadrado.\n16:12 Comment: He already accumulates many men.\n16:13 Comment: Chelsea up.\n16:14 Comment: It closes with all the Barley.\n16:16 Comment: The ball for Diego Costa.\n16:17 Comment: He fails to define after Oscar's pass.\n16:22 Comment: The Spanish-Brazilian got his leg in late.\n16:26 Comment: The ball hit Ivanovic's body.\n16:28 Comment: Ugh, Keitly's entry on that one is very dangerous.\n16:32 Comment: Law of advantage offers Martin Atkinson.\n16:35 Comment: Ugh, what quality Hazard has.\n16:37 Comment: Which is already inside the area.\n16:38 Comment: How he beat Arfield with that break.\n16:41 Comment: That broke.\n16:42 Comment: Hazard played again towards Cesc Fàbregas.\n16:49 Comment: The Chelsea that increases its performance in the game.\n16:53 Comment: He wants the second.\n16:55 Comment: Although at the moment Mourinho's team is resisting that second goal.\n17:2 Comment: And yellow for Keitly for that tackle on Cesc.\n17:5 Comment: The previous action that was light yellow.\n17:8 Comment: And here the referee does it very well.\n17:9 Comment: He writes down his license plate and then reprimands him.\n17:12 Comment: Van Liet is very aggressive in some phases.\n17:14 Comment: Leaving these entries a little abrupt.\n17:16 Comment: Well, William by Square.\n17:18 Comment: Cuadrado hasn't shined, really.\n17:21 Comment: He hasn't been at a high level.\n17:23 Comment: He will get into the team dynamic.\n17:27 Comment: It was rumored this week that he had a statuesque English teacher.\n17:31 Comment: There have been a lot of jokes on Twitter.\n17:33 Comment: And he had to post a photo with his real English teacher.\n17:37 Comment: But it has not been that way.\n17:39 Comment: He has been very aggressive.\n17:40 Comment: Very aggressive.\n17:42 Comment: Saying, this is my real English teacher.\n17:45 Comment: It has been a busy week in that sense.\n17:48 Comment: Square.\n17:49 Comment: He will enter the team little by little.\n17:52 Comment: It will go into everything.\n17:53 Comment: In the London environment.\n17:54 Comment: In the language.\n17:55 Comment: He is a great player who will surely give many things to Chelsea.\n17:59 Comment: And now William enters.\n18:0 Comment: Which is the fact that this process has already finished.\n18:2 Comment: And it's now in...\n18:4 Comment: I think he is at his peak performance since he arrived in London.\n18:7 Comment: Oscar stole that ball against Arfield.\n18:11 Comment: It's going to be done.\n18:12 Comment: Chelsea up again.\n18:13 Comment: Ball for Diego Costa.\n18:14 Comment: left behind\n18:16 Comment: Arfield has been there very quickly to anticipate Cesc.\n18:20 Comment: Barnes can't get that first deep ball out for Ings.\n18:24 Comment: How they pressured Barnes, who is left on the ground in pain.\n18:27 Comment: While Chelsea are now trying to do it on the left.\n18:30 Comment: With Hazard.\n18:31 Comment: Hazard towards Oscar.\n18:32 Comment: Oscar.\n18:33 Comment: Hazard again.\n18:34 Comment: The first touch towards Philippe.\n18:36 Comment: And Boyd's recovery.\n18:40 Comment: Long hit by Trippier.\n18:42 Comment: There was Terry.\n18:43 Comment: William.\n18:44 Comment: Matic.\n18:45 Comment: Matic with Terry.\n18:48 Comment: John Terry for Diego Costa.\n18:51 Comment: There was absolutely nothing there.\n18:54 Comment: Shaquille closed him down without too many complications.\n18:58 Comment: The ball ended up in Heaton's possession.\n19:0 Comment: It's Jones's turn.\n19:2 Comment: Back with Keane.\n19:4 Comment: Michael Keane to Trippier.\n19:6 Comment: The Barley does not have fabric inside.\n19:12 Comment: Quickly look for those passes or to the sides.\n19:16 Comment: And the ball is already deep so that either Barnes or Ings can fight it there.\n19:20 Comment: But the midfield is dominated with absolute clarity by Chelsea.\n19:24 Comment: Logically, Barley skips it most of the time.\n19:27 Comment: What happens is that this type of ball is like the last one they sent to Ings.\n19:31 Comment: Surrounded by the two Chelsea centre-backs.\n19:34 Comment: And he has to play with his back turned.\n19:36 Comment: It's very complicated there.\n19:37 Comment: Or Ings comes to receive and you give him a support break.\n19:40 Comment: You give him a ball at his foot.\n19:41 Comment: That he can play it.\n19:42 Comment: Or you look for him in depth.\n19:44 Comment: Which by the way is very good.\n19:46 Comment: Going to space Ings.\n19:48 Comment: But that ball like the one we saw in the last play is very complicated.\n19:50 Comment: There Ivanovic is appearing on the right.\n19:53 Comment: Mirror.\n19:55 Comment: Schalke.\n19:57 Comment: Oscar is going to control.\n19:59 Comment: Anticipating Ings.\n20:1 Comment: Play Matic now.\n20:3 Comment: Matic.\n20:4 Comment: Ivanovic.\n20:5 Comment: He's going to lose to Keitly.\n20:6 Comment: Keitly who comes out with skill against Matic.\n20:8 Comment: Let's see how the Barley can be stretched or not.\n20:10 Comment: No.\n20:11 Comment: That first pass does not usually come to fruition.\n20:14 Comment: And there the Barley is completely nullified.\n20:16 Comment: He practically cannot mount a counterattack at any time.\n20:20 Comment: He has not been able to do it in this entire second half.\n20:23 Comment: The one that does end up having a fabric is Chelsea.\n20:27 Comment: Because notice that the sides are constantly rising.\n20:30 Comment: That pushes the flyers inward.\n20:33 Comment: And that gives even more fabric to Chelsea.\n20:36 Comment: More people in the rival field inside.\n20:39 Comment: How good Hazard.\n20:40 Comment: Philip.\n20:41 Comment: In the end Felipe's center went wide by a Barley player.\n20:46 Comment: Corner kick.\n20:47 Comment: Well, we've seen a great first half from Ivanovic.\n20:50 Comment: And Felipe Luis has joined the second.\n20:52 Comment: That is providing great depth on the left wing.\n20:55 Comment: Chelsea are coming a lot.\n20:57 Comment: He is going deep on the sides with his full-backs.\n21:1 Comment: That is giving the team good arrivals.\n21:3 Comment: What happens is that it doesn't finish closing the game.\n21:5 Comment: Seventh corner kick for Chelsea.\n21:7 Comment: Souma rose.\n21:8 Comment: That hasn't gone away.\n21:9 Comment: It hasn't gone away.\n21:10 Comment: He couldn't finish finishing.\n21:13 Comment: The ball for Willian.\n21:15 Comment: Ahead Mee.\n21:17 Comment: Willian has two men.\n21:19 Comment: Also to Keitly.\n21:21 Comment: The Brazilian holds on calmly, coldly, supporting Saint-Sao.\n21:24 Comment: Bad control there from Oscar.\n21:26 Comment: Although Arfield rushes on his way out.\n21:30 Comment: Barley is lacking a little more temper, coldness, and calm.\n21:36 Comment: When he recovers the ball to have a good start.\n21:39 Comment: A clearer exit.\n21:41 Comment: Vannes again in hand-to-hand combat.\n21:43 Comment: This time with Souma.\n21:45 Comment: He held up well to the investiture of Barley's midfielder.\n21:49 Comment: Matic.\n21:51 Comment: Filipe.\n21:54 Comment: Hazard.\n21:55 Comment: Hazard in depth by Diego Costa.\n21:58 Comment: Who wants those races, even if it's towards the band.\n22:1 Comment: Being able to run, being able to go out.\n22:3 Comment: He held up well to Matic's launch.\n22:5 Comment: No complications for Heaton.\n22:7 Comment: Matic hits him almost without faith.\n22:9 Comment: Very far.\n22:11 Comment: It's true what you say.\n22:12 Comment: Diego Costa needs to come into play with those types of actions.\n22:15 Comment: It's like they serve as a warm-up.\n22:20 Comment: Played especially by that left sector.\n22:23 Comment: Which is where he likes to fall the most.\n22:26 Comment: To have the possibility of then entering diagonally.\n22:29 Comment: But those breaks, those races, those drives.\n22:32 Comment: What a start from Hazard.\n22:33 Comment: Sorry Gaby.\n22:34 Comment: What exit does Diego Costa have?\n22:35 Comment: Hazard again.\n22:36 Comment: Hazard.\n22:37 Comment: In the end.\n22:38 Comment: Not even for Diego.\n22:39 Comment: Not for William.\n22:40 Comment: Although it is the latter who picks up the ball.\n22:42 Comment: Ivanovic.\n22:43 Comment: What a great game by Eden Hazard.\n22:44 Comment: Hazard is leaving some details.\n22:46 Comment: The breakdown from before, by the way, has not been repeated.\n22:48 Comment: And it's already strange.\n22:51 Comment: William Sess.\n22:52 Comment: The release of Sess.\n22:54 Comment: Voigt was quick there to get in the way of the ball towards Heaton's goal.\n23:0 Comment: It has been noted that in these 4 o'clock games, the level of television production is not the same as in the most notable games.\n23:7 Comment: The one at 6:30.\n23:8 Comment: The one at 1:45 p.m.\n23:10 Comment: The one at 5 pm on Sunday.\n23:13 Comment: Because Hazard is leaving some details.\n23:16 Comment: Here they are going to give us a very repetition...\n23:19 Comment: In a very aerial plane.\n23:21 Comment: But what a way to drive the ball.\n23:23 Comment: Hazard is scandalous.\n23:26 Comment: It is at a level...\n23:27 Comment: It is at an incredible level.\n23:28 Comment: Extraordinary, yes.\n23:29 Comment: And what still remains for this boy, who is still very young.\n23:32 Comment: Matic.\n23:33 Comment: We enter the last...\n23:34 Comment: Or we have already entered the last quarter of the season.\n23:36 Comment: What happened?\n23:37 Comment: Already in the last quarter of the game.\n23:38 Comment: With Chelsea's advantage, but minimal.\n23:41 Comment: So much solitary.\n23:43 Comment: For now enough to take the 3 points.\n23:45 Comment: Which at the end of the day is the most important thing for the London team.\n23:50 Comment: But with the feeling of having to continue, as we said at the break, alert.\n23:55 Comment: That the game is not closed.\n23:57 Comment: That, of course, must be satisfying...\n24:3 Comment: He is leaving Sin Dic satisfied.\n24:6 Comment: And today we are going to see Matic's reaction there with Ings.\n24:9 Comment: What a reaction from Matic.\n24:11 Comment: And let's see how this play ends.\n24:14 Comment: The Serbian Chelsea player is very angry, who is going to see red.\n24:18 Comment: Although Ivanovic wants to hide the card from the referee, Matic's reaction costs him the expulsion.\n24:25 Comment: How Matic has lost his papers.\n24:28 Comment: Surely when it is seen tonight in the season recaps, which is the first time Ings has been seen.\n24:34 Comment: It will not be recognized.\n24:36 Comment: And I'm not even saying that he's not right to be angry, because something has probably been done to him.\n24:40 Comment: Well.\n24:42 Comment: The entrance is...\n24:44 Comment: Wild.\n24:46 Comment: VARs again, which is being the hardest of the game.\n24:48 Comment: With very ugly entries throughout the match.\n24:50 Comment: And this is what happens.\n24:52 Comment: This is what happens when a referee doesn't punish hard tackles.\n24:56 Comment: This is what ends up happening.\n24:58 Comment: Matic has not been given the cards.\n25:0 Comment: And Ings has not been given the cards.\n25:4 Comment: And Ings' tibia and fibula have not been broken because he wears shin guards.\n25:8 Comment: The entry has been wild.\n25:10 Comment: Of VARs, which already has several.\n25:12 Comment: You can't believe it.\n25:14 Comment: They punish him with yellow.\n25:16 Comment: While Ivanovic shows him the previous entry from the VARs itself in the first part.\n25:20 Comment: Which has left, as we said, three or four very ugly entries.\n25:24 Comment: In itself, any entry was borderline red.\n25:28 Comment: That is perpetual, arbitration.\n25:30 Comment: And VARs have done something crazy.\n25:32 Comment: That he could have broken his fibula.\n25:34 Comment: And that he has given his leg to a colleague.\n25:36 Comment: And Matic is rightfully on the street.\n25:40 Comment: But VARs should be on the street too.\n25:43 Comment: And it's probably been a while now.\n25:45 Comment: But that's what happens when you let it go and are permissive with those types of actions.\n25:51 Comment: Which is that British arbitration is very fashionable.\n25:57 Comment: You have to be permissive with certain things.\n26:0 Comment: But with those that endanger fiscal integrity.\n26:4 Comment: And the rival's physics, no.\n26:5 Comment: And Atkinson is doing miserable officiating.\n26:9 Comment: Oscar leaves, Ramírez enters.\n26:11 Comment: Mourinho is going to try to give a little more balance to the midfield now.\n26:16 Comment: With the entry of Ramírez in the absence of Matic.\n26:19 Comment: With one less player obviously.\n26:22 Comment: Chelsea are going to organize themselves a little further back.\n26:27 Comment: It's going to close a little more.\n26:29 Comment: And he will leave it to the VAR to take the initiative.\n26:32 Comment: Let's see what this team is capable of.\n26:34 Comment: And these situations are of course not foreign to football.\n26:38 Comment: But they are foreign to what is purely and strictly sports.\n26:41 Comment: Well, they now force Chelsea to pay maximum attention.\n26:46 Comment: Because he hasn't closed the game in 70 minutes.\n26:49 Comment: When he has been able to do so due to his greater superiority and control of the match.\n26:55 Comment: And now he sees himself maintaining a minimal advantage.\n26:58 Comment: But with 20 minutes left.\n27:0 Comment: In which the VAR-Li.\n27:1 Comment: We'll see if he's able to make the most of it.\n27:3 Comment: And if he is able to take advantage of this numerical superiority.\n27:7 Comment: For the VAR-Li it is certainly not going to be easy.\n27:10 Comment: It's not going to be easy to hurt a locked-down Chelsea.\n27:13 Comment: Here is the Red one.\n27:14 Comment: That I don't argue.\n27:15 Comment: That Iván Ovid almost took it out of his hand.\n27:17 Comment: I do not dispute the Red to Matic.\n27:19 Comment: But I dispute many things that the referee has done.\n27:22 Comment: And that has led to us seeing that wild entrance.\n27:25 Comment: And on top of that, that wild tackle is not punished with Red.\n27:29 Comment: Which is what is incredible.\n27:33 Comment: And now the VAR-Li.\n27:36 Comment: We already mentioned it about VAR.\n27:38 Comment: He has been the most dangerous of the VAR-Li in terms of shots.\n27:41 Comment: With a great ability of course to see goal.\n27:44 Comment: And also quickly.\n27:46 Comment: As effective as possible.\n27:48 Comment: Because in complicated situations he has managed to lead.\n27:52 Comment: Two or three balls between the three sticks.\n27:54 Comment: Let's see Terry there clearing.\n27:56 Comment: Filipe appeared.\n27:58 Comment: You don't understand Zouma.\n28:0 Comment: And now the VAR-Li players are the ones demanding a hand.\n28:2 Comment: We will have to see that action repeated again as well.\n28:3 Comment: Between the three suits.\n28:3 Comment: Between Zouma and Filipe.\n28:4 Comment: Between one and another.\n28:5 Comment: The lack of understanding.\n28:7 Comment: And we will see what has happened there.\n28:9 Comment: At the moment Keitli is missing.\n28:12 Comment: How is the game going to end?\n28:14 Comment: And a climate of nervousness sets in at Stamford Bridge.\n28:19 Comment: Let's see there.\n28:21 Comment: A little revenge.\n28:22 Comment: That around here there may be...\n28:24 Comment: I do not think so.\n28:27 Comment: It is also a complicated action.\n28:29 Comment: The ball falls from high above.\n28:30 Comment: No will is appreciated in Filipe Luis.\n28:33 Comment: In touching that ball with your hand.\n28:36 Comment: But the atmosphere in the game.\n28:39 Comment: A little revenge.\n28:43 Comment: And tension.\n28:45 Comment: It doesn't make you brag about anything good.\n28:50 Comment: I hope nothing happens.\n28:52 Comment: But there are still a few minutes of great tension.\n28:56 Comment: The game is not closed.\n28:59 Comment: For Chelsea.\n29:0 Comment: While Trippier now.\n29:2 Comment: I was looking for that ball in the center.\n29:3 Comment: In the long for Vance.\n29:5 Comment: We were with him.\n29:6 Comment: With the ability he has had to finish.\n29:8 Comment: But a player who has gone to melee.\n29:11 Comment: But with also quite ugly details.\n29:14 Comment: Very ugly.\n29:15 Comment: Because he has made unfair entries.\n29:17 Comment: As they say.\n29:19 Comment: Because it's one thing to go strong.\n29:22 Comment: Go hard on split balls.\n29:24 Comment: Even go strong.\n29:26 Comment: And another thing is to go with disloyal gestures.\n29:28 Comment: And that's what I think Vance has done at times.\n29:30 Comment: And those disloyal gestures must be punished with yellow.\n29:33 Comment: Courtois leaves.\n29:35 Comment: Who manages to clear outside the area.\n29:38 Comment: Driving headlong towards the touchline.\n29:40 Comment: That climate of confusion has also set in at Stamford Bridge.\n29:45 Comment: The team now trying to take the pulse and measure of a game that was clearly dominating in general terms.\n29:53 Comment: And one thing Enrique.\n29:54 Comment: Vance is going to be punished.\n29:55 Comment: Because in England that really works well.\n29:58 Comment: In England they have some very bad referees.\n30:1 Comment: Like this.\n30:1 Comment: But if something works.\n30:3 Comment: Good.\n30:4 Comment: It is acting ex officio.\n30:6 Comment: And these things.\n30:7 Comment: It acts ex officio.\n30:8 Comment: And also.\n30:9 Comment: I think that with all the reason in the world.\n30:11 Comment: Because.\n30:12 Comment: Even though the referee did not see the seriousness of the tackle.\n30:15 Comment: It cannot go unpunished.\n30:17 Comment: And in England you enter by trade.\n30:19 Comment: And Vance can say goodbye to the competition.\n30:21 Comment: Just like what happened to Diego Costa.\n30:22 Comment: Well, maybe for three games.\n30:24 Comment: Perfectly.\n30:26 Comment: We'll see.\n30:27 Comment: But I think there will be a sanction for sure.\n30:29 Comment: .\n30:33 Comment: For me.\n30:34 Comment: Chackle again with Michael Keane.\n30:36 Comment: Chelsea has ended up retreating.\n30:40 Comment: He cut that one.\n30:42 Comment: Offensive work when Vance arrives.\n30:44 Comment: Vance's release.\n30:46 Comment: Martín Atkinson looked asking for the corner kick.\n30:50 Comment: You won't see it.\n30:51 Comment: Bad for Chelsea.\n30:54 Comment: Chelsea that.\n30:57 Comment: We tell.\n30:58 Comment: They have stopped him dead.\n31:0 Comment: All offensive capacity.\n31:2 Comment: that he was having during the last minutes of the game after nuance's expulsion\n31:11 Comment: without saying that he appreciates a more conservative character in Chelsea and we will see if he takes advantage of it\n31:17 Comment: to put more gunpowder up top I think it will simplify the game even more I guess it will\n31:25 Comment: to try with long balls to keep Chelsea behind and then look for lateral crosses and shots\n31:32 Comment: I think it is the most recommended way right now for the team to be able to shoot.\n31:39 Comment: because one of the problems it has is that the team does not finish the plays\n31:45 Comment: receives william steps on the ball william to pass\n31:57 Comment: Terry now distributes the ball towards Zoma and tries to maintain possession.\n32:2 Comment: Chelsea got the ball, although the presence of Berns forces Courtois to have to play long.\n32:10 Comment: Hasard has fallen in a very bad position after

Well, a very hard shot from the Brazilian, from the newcomer to the field of play who...\n33:8 Comment: He was on the verge of scoring the second for Chelsea.\n33:11 Comment: It's tremendous how Hazard attracts rivals, in this case up to four of them surround him.\n33:17 Comment: And then unload and always leave his teammates at an advantage.\n33:22 Comment: It's something he does very often.\n33:26 Comment: Enter Vox, the Welshman Sam Vox, a striker.\n33:34 Comment: I thought that Yuskiewicz was going to come in more, who is a more physically powerful player.\n33:41 Comment: But anyway, Sam Vox enters.\n33:43 Comment: Let's see what Barley's idea is for this final stretch with a single goal disadvantage and numerical superiority.\n33:50 Comment: Which is very interesting for this team.\n33:52 Comment: In Stamford Bridge, no less in the leader's house.\n33:56 Comment: Here in Premier, only Manchester City has been able to score.\n34:1 Comment: Ings opening towards me.\n34:4 Comment: Hazard manages to deflect, as it will be a corner kick for Barley.\n34:7 Comment: And Tripper's hitting has created problems for Chelsea so far.\n34:12 Comment: So in this type of actions the right back will surely go to the attack.\n34:17 Comment: And surely with that hit, with those balls so touched, he is creating danger for Chelsea.\n34:26 Comment: Well, Tripper at the launch.\n34:30 Comment: There goes that shipment.\n34:32 Comment: Courtois was very covered in that play and quite far back.\n34:35 Comment: Jones, the ball loose.\n34:37 Comment: Vars and what a save from Courtois.\n34:40 Comment: That stop is worth gold for Chelsea at the moment.\n34:44 Comment: At point blank range again Vars, who is, as we said before, a trigger-happy player.\n34:50 Comment: He didn't think about it the way the ball fell to him.\n34:53 Comment: He took that shot, it was between the three posts.\n34:55 Comment: Stopped.\n34:56 Comment: And Thibaut Courtois' goal.\n34:58 Comment: One of those stops that are worth points.\n35:0 Comment: He has the trigger, he always has his finger on the trigger Vars.\n35:5 Comment: It's impressive how easily he loads and arms his right leg.\n35:10 Comment: Cahill is coming in.\n35:12 Comment: To defend from above.\n35:15 Comment: Mourinho has already realized that the way the game is going, it may be easier to keep a clean sheet than to score a second.\n35:21 Comment: Well no, because Mee's header arrives.\n35:25 Comment: Left back.\n35:26 Comment: The player who usually stays in coverage.\n35:30 Comment: Because Trippier is the one who centers.\n35:32 Comment: Because the two center backs are the ones who usually go up.\n35:35 Comment: Well, Mee, the left back, also appears in this situation and surprises.\n35:41 Comment: He leaves Ramírez, Ramírez ignores him.\n35:44 Comment: Mee finally nods.\n35:45 Comment: He crosses before Courtois.\n35:47 Comment: And tie one.\n35:48 Comment: Surprise at Stamford Bridge.\n35:50 Comment: And how the game looks for these last ten minutes.\n35:53 Comment: Tremendous.\n35:54 Comment: Tremendous how the game turns out.\n35:56 Comment: We were talking about good...\n35:58 Comment: What a good finishing action.\n36:0 Comment: He wins the action against Ramírez.\n36:2 Comment: In an action that will surely cost Ramírez a chat with his coach.\n36:10 Comment: Because it is these types of actions in these extreme situations that often define a footballer.\n36:16 Comment: Ramírez has a lot of virtues, but in this case he has missed his match.\n36:21 Comment: And he scored a great goal with a header with another great shot of the ball.\n36:25 Comment: From Tripper, from that band.\n36:27 Comment: From that corner.\n36:30 Comment: Tremendous about Burnley.\n36:32 Comment: That with a set piece ends up tying.\n36:33 Comment: Let's see because now it's Chelsea that has approximately ten minutes.\n36:37 Comment: Ten, twelve minutes to try to score the winning goal.\n36:40 Comment: Beautiful match.\n36:41 Comment: Well, the world is upside down.\n36:42 Comment: Because the weakest team in the aerial game during this current Premier season.\n36:48 Comment: The team that has conceded sixteen headed goals.\n36:50 Comment: But he couldn't defend that header from left back Ben Mee.\n36:55 Comment: And Mourinho.\n36:57 Comment: There we see Ivanovic who cannot appear before VAR.\n37:1 Comment: Mourinho who quickly changes the profile of his replacement on the field of play.\n37:7 Comment: And Cahill is going to enter.\n37:8 Comment: Let's see, what action by Vox.\n37:10 Comment: Vox that receives the tarascada from Zouma.\n37:12 Comment: Inks was looking for the shot against Terry.\n37:15 Comment: And Gaby changes now, logically.\n37:18 Comment: Drogba is going to enter.\n37:19 Comment: Because he has to win.\n37:20 Comment: And Cahill once again remains on the bench.\n37:24 Comment: I think Mourinho saw.\n37:25 Comment: The possibility of keeping a clean sheet is clearer than of making the second.\n37:29 Comment: I tell you one thing.\n37:30 Comment: Right now Mourinho is regretting not having made the Cahill switch sooner.\n37:35 Comment: Because there is a central defender, in addition to John Terry, who manages and commands the aerial game in English football.\n37:41 Comment: That's Cahill.\n37:43 Comment: Let's see that Arfield ball looking for Inks that ended up on the ground.\n37:47 Comment: The VAR is brave.\n37:49 Comment: And that must be praised to the Sin Ditch team.\n37:52 Comment: That is not satisfied with the tie at one.\n37:54 Comment: In a stadium where only City has been able to draw.\n37:57 Comment: And that must be praised.\n37:59 Comment: Even though Chelsea are one man less.\n38:1 Comment: What an end to the match we have with both teams going for victory.\n38:6 Comment: Diego Costa was desperately looking for that ball.\n38:9 Comment: That came out after a rebound.\n38:11 Comment: And the ball remains in the hands of Tom Heaton.\n38:15 Comment: Well, as soon as the ball stops I suppose the change will occur.\n38:19 Comment: We'll see who is sacrificed so that Drogba can enter.\n38:22 Comment: And for the team to look for the end.\n38:23 Comment: And for the team to look for attacks in direct play of course.\n38:27 Comment: Chelsea no longer has time for more positional attacks.\n38:33 Comment: And when Drogba enters, the team will surely look for him long.\n38:37 Comment: He is going to look for second plays.\n38:39 Comment: It will load the area a lot.\n38:41 Comment: Sure.\n38:42 Comment: Zouma cleared.\n38:43 Comment: Let's see why no one came to that ball.\n38:45 Comment: Terry in the end measures the bounce of that ball better than anyone.\n38:49 Comment: Removing danger.\n38:51 Comment: Shaquille Boyd was playing.\n38:52 Comment: Boyd held that ball against Cesc Fàbregas.\n38:56 Comment: Opening to Inks.\n38:57 Comment: Inks that puts the center.\n38:59 Comment: Bokes that now remains as a reference above.\n39:1 Comment: It seems that Inks leaned a little towards the band.\n39:4 Comment: Now it seems that the powerful Welsh forward from the barri is the reference for the last meters.\n39:12 Comment: Hazard's career.\n39:13 Comment: Hello Tom Heaton.\n39:15 Comment: It's a bit desperate.\n39:17 Comment: Chelsea is dismembered right now.\n39:19 Comment: It is frayed in the meeting.\n39:20 Comment: Yes, it's frayed.\n39:21 Comment: First hit emotionally by Barley's goal.\n39:25 Comment: And then he is with one less player.\n39:27 Comment: The center and there Zouma who anticipates with two men behind him.\n39:32 Comment: Waiting for service from the right.\n39:35 Comment: Now Cahill is going to come in.\n39:37 Comment: Well.\n39:38 Comment: No, Drogba.\n39:39 Comment: Not Cahill.\n39:40 Comment: Sorry, Drogba.\n39:41 Comment: By Filipe.\n39:42 Comment: We were talking about Drogba.\n39:44 Comment: Sacrificed Filipe Luís.\n39:46 Comment: And Drogba who is going to help the team...\n39:49 Comment: TO...\n39:50 Comment: To attack, let's say, in...\n39:52 Comment: Spend fewer seconds reaching finishing areas.\n39:55 Comment: With direct play.\n39:57 Comment: Cahill is the one that came to mind because I was thinking that Mourinho must have regretted having brought Cahill in earlier.\n40:5 Comment: Because he scored a goal with his head.\n40:8 Comment: A goal that can be worth a lot.\n40:11 Comment: A lot of things have happened in this match.\n40:15 Comment: Let's see the service there.\n40:17 Comment: What was going...\n40:20 Comment: Towards the first stick.\n40:21 Comment: After Jones hit.\n40:22 Comment: Drogba cleared.\n40:24 Comment: We will have to listen to Mourinho after a game.\n40:27 Comment: With that hand of...\n40:28 Comment: Yes, because he has contested the penalty a lot.\n40:29 Comment: From Keitly.\n40:30 Comment: The penalty to...\n40:31 Comment: To Diego Costa above all.\n40:32 Comment: To Diego Costa.\n40:33 Comment: But Keitly's hand is also very clear.\n40:35 Comment: The action in which Nemanja Matic ends up expelled.\n40:39 Comment: I can feel it...\n40:40 Comment: Hey...\n40:41 Comment: Yeah.\n40:42 Comment: Chelsea also hurt.\n40:43 Comment: He is harmed.\n40:44 Comment: Yes Yes.\n40:45 Comment: They have clearly hurt Chelsea there.\n40:46 Comment: Because is what...\n40:47 Comment: Vance had to be ejected.\n40:50 Comment: Obviously today Chelsea have reasons to complain.\n40:54 Comment: And when you have them...\n40:56 Comment: Many times Mourinho complains without having them.\n40:58 Comment: But today I think he has them, yes.\n41:0 Comment: And today he has them and I'm sure he's going to complain bitterly.\n41:2 Comment: And today he will be right.\n41:4 Comment: Because it's already coming...\n41:7 Comment: Things are getting hotter in recent weeks.\n41:10 Comment: There's Inks.\n41:12 Comment: VARLEY is not satisfied with a tie.\n41:15 Comment: Vance was trying to prolong towards the end.\n41:17 Comment: But without precision.\n41:18 Comment: Courtois caught.\n41:19 Comment: We are at 42 of the game.\n41:20 Comment: The ball flying towards Drogba.\n41:23 Comment: Drogba who in the end did not play a single minute at the Parc des Princes.\n41:30 Comment: Against PSG in the Champions League.\n41:35 Comment: I wanted to protect Vox.\n41:38 Comment: Ivanovic played.\n41:40 Comment: Ball therefore for VARLEY.\n41:43 Comment: And the VARLEY...\n41:44 Comment: He hasn't done it.\n41:46 Comment: VARLEY...\n41:48 Comment: VARLEY who is really getting an optimal result.\n41:53 Comment: Out of home.\n41:57 Comment: This season they have achieved one victory and four draws.\n42:1 Comment: They have won away to Stoke City.\n42:4 Comment: By 1-2.\n42:6 Comment: My that can't come out before Willian.\n42:12 Comment: Goal kick.\n42:14 Comment: The team came to win 1.\n42:15 Comment: Of the last 12 points nothing more.\n42:18 Comment: The VARLEY.\n42:19 Comment: With defeats against Crystal Palace.\n42:22 Comment: Against Sunderland and against Manchester United.\n42:25 Comment: And only one draw against West Brom.\n42:27 Comment: And now they are about to claim another draw at Stamford Bridge.\n42:30 Comment: Nothing less.\n42:31 Comment: There is the direct game towards Drogba.\n42:34 Comment: Let's see if the Ivory Coast is capable of imposing its law.\n42:37 Comment: Arfield was playing.\n42:41 Comment: Souma has been left on the left.\n42:43 Comment: Now he has only three defenders.\n42:46 Comment: Central Souma on the left.\n42:48 Comment: More Terry.\n42:50 Comment: And more Ivanovic.\n42:52 Comment: Defense of three is what it takes.\n42:54 Comment: Drogba.\n42:55 Comment: The center of Drogba.\n42:57 Comment: Diego Costa.\n42:58 Comment: He made the gesture of chasing that Chilean ball.\n43:1 Comment: In the end he stayed halfway in that gesture.\n43:4 Comment: Also at the risk of having committed a dangerous game.\n43:7 Comment: It is from the ground.\n43:8 Comment: Manage to direct the ball towards the center.\n43:10 Comment: I can not go out.\n43:12 Comment: Manage to orient the ball towards hunting.\n43:14 Comment: The center of the Belgian.\n43:16 Comment: Takes it out.\n43:18 Comment: King.\n43:19 Comment: Play William.\n43:20 Comment: Opportunity there for Cesc.\n43:22 Comment: He goes up.\n43:23 Comment: He was bouncing that ball.\n43:25 Comment: And in the end Cesc Fàbregas ends up finishing high.\n43:28 Comment: He doesn't attack that ball well because obviously the ball is going to bounce.\n43:33 Comment: And if it bounces you have to get on top of the ball much more so that it doesn't go into the clouds.\n43:39 Comment: His body goes back a little.\n43:41 Comment: And the ball almost inevitably goes up.\n43:46 Comment: Now look at the games in which a big team for long stretches does not put in all the intensity that needs to be put in.\n43:59 Comment: Even the recently promoted rival with the least quality in the Premier makes a game difficult for you.\n44:4 Comment: Beyond referee errors.\n44:6 Comment: Of course.\n44:7 Comment: I insist, for me they have clearly hurt Chelsea.\n44:9 Comment: Totally agree.\n44:10 Comment: And it's going to bring a tail.\n44:11 Comment: But many stretches of Chelsea's game have played at a very low level of intensity.\n44:16 Comment: And at this level those types of matches practically always become difficult for you.\n44:22 Comment: Many readings can be given about this meeting.\n44:26 Comment: Of course, Chelsea may feel mistreated from the referee's point of view due to specific actions in which they have clearly been harmed.\n44:35 Comment: But Chelsea perhaps should have reached that moment of Matic's expulsion.\n44:39 Comment: With a broader result.\n44:41 Comment: With a definitive result since it would have allowed him to have the game on track.\n44:46 Comment: It was not so.\n44:47 Comment: And that opened Barley's possibilities wide open.\n44:51 Comment: That's good because it has also had its merit to sustain itself.\n44:55 Comment: And of course we have to thank the Chelsea team.\n    \n\n    #######TASK \n    Provide a factually correct and detailed

    "summary": "Chelsea and Burnley played out an enthralling 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge, a match filled with excitement, intensity, and numerous noteworthy moments. From the first whistle, it was evident that both teams were keen to impose their will on the game.\n\nChelsea began with a sense of urgency, dictating the early pace and controlling possession. The positioning of players, especially Branislav Ivanovic, who found himself frequently advancing forward, permitted Chelsea to stretch Burnley's defensive lines early on. This tactical move was complemented by the interplay between the likes of Eden Hazard, Juan Cuadrado, and Diego Costa. Burnley, on the other hand, demonstrated resilience, with Trippier and Keane diligently holding their lines.\n\nHazard was integral to Chelsea's early dominance. His dribbles and deft touches constantly troubled Burnley’s defense. On the right wing, Cuadrado, supported by Ivanovic, frequently advanced and brought the ball into the danger zones, creating several half-chances that kept Burnley's keeper Heaton on his toes.\n\nPlay progressed fluidly, with Chelsea showing why they were favorites. However, Burnley, adopting a high press, tried to minimize spaces and cut out passes especially targeting Fabregas’ playmaking ability. It was a strategy laced with risks, and it seemed a matter of when, not if, Chelsea would capitalize.\n\nThe inevitable breakthrough came courtesy of Hazard, who demonstrated his exceptional dribbling skills. In the 14th minute, he weaved through Burnley’s defense and provided a perfect assist to Ivanovic, who coolly slotted home, marking his fourth goal in seven games. Chelsea's celebration signaled their early control of the encounter.\n\nDespite trailing, Burnley did not buckle under the pressure. They looked to catch Chelsea off guard with swift counters, capitalizing on any loose balls. Proactively, Barnes fired multiple shots at Courtois, one which forced the Belgian keeper into a crucial save, maintaining Chelsea's slender lead.\n\nChelsea, however, continued to probe. Subsequent corner kicks heightened the pressure on Burnley's defense, but Heaton and his backline stood firm. Hazard and Oscar combined elegantly, engineering multiple threats that Burnley did well to thwart.\n\nIn an unexpected twist, Chelsea’s defensive nerves began to show. Burnley, sensing an opportunity, tried to exploit Chelsea’s occasional lapses. In the 30th minute, after a series of clearances and tackles, Hazard found himself again spearheading an attack, setting up Diego Costa whose effort was ultimately thwarted by Mee. \n\nThe game’s dynamic, initially dictated by Chelsea, started to shift slightly. Burnley grew into the contest and constructed meaningful attacks, with Ings and Barnes benefiting from Trippier's well-measured deliveries. One such delivery saw Barnes crash into Terry, an encounter that amped up the game's physical intensity.\n\nBurnley's resilience paid dividends early in the second half. Continuing their pressing game, they forced errors from Chelsea's defense. Zouma’s poor clearance was a prime example, allowing Burnley’s press to maintain pressure high up the pitch.\n\nIn the 60th minute, Hazard once again showcased why he is Chelsea's brightest spark. His incisive pass to Diego Costa almost resulted in a second goal, but Heaton deflected the shot. Ivanovic returned the ball into the mix, only for it to be cleared, followed by another missed attempt by Matic.\n\nThe game's turning point arrived with Matic's dismissal in the 70th minute. Following a wild challenge from Barnes, unpunished by the referee, Matic retaliated, leading to a straight red card. This moment of rashness left Chelsea a man down and allowed Burnley to mount further pressure.\n\nBurnley's equalizer was a testament to their persistence and set-piece proficiency. From a Tripper corner, Mee rose highest, outmuscling his marker to nod home, bringing Burnley level and silencing Stamford Bridge.\n\nChelsea, now desperate, introduced Drogba to add aerial threat and intensify their pursuit of a second goal. Direct plays targeting Drogba and second balls became their strategy, but Burnley marshaled their defense effectively. Hazard continued to be a source of creativity, his every touch exuding class and menace.\n\nAs the clock ticked, Chelsea pressed with urgency. Drogba's center aimed at Diego Costa, Fàbregas’s volleys, and Hazard's relentless dribbling illuminated Chelsea's burning desire to clinch the winner. But Heaton and his resilient backline ensured Burnley held firm.\n\nIn the dying minutes, tension flared further, with Chelsea’s desperation evident. Burnley’s attempts to run down the clock — a testament to their earlier ambition and hard-fought parity — brought home just how closely they had pushed Chelsea.\n\nUltimately, despite Chelsea's dominance, especially in the possession and chance creation departments, it was Burnley's resilience and tactical discipline that earned them a noteworthy point at Stamford Bridge. Their defensive rigidity combined with incisive counter-attacks, crowned by Mee’s headed goal, underscored the tactical acumen with which they approached the game.\n\nThe final whistle blew on a match that exemplified the unpredictable, tumultuous nature of football, embodied by Chelsea's missed opportunities and Burnley's spirited fightback. From Ivanovic's early goal to Matic's contentious sending off and Mee’s pivotal equalizer, this match had it all.\n\nBurnley's point from this fixture not only frustrates a title-challenging Chelsea but also shines a light on the teamwork, resilience, and fighting spirit that epitomize Sean Dyche's side. As for Chelsea, amidst raising questions about refereeing decisions and their own complacency, they may end this day reflecting on lessons learned ahead of future conquests."
