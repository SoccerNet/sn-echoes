Southampton's defeat to Manchester United here back in December\n0:55 Comment: It's one of those decisions that any official would hope wouldn't come that early in the match\n1:1 Comment: Before he's had a chance to get his eye in, see whether he got it right\n1:8 Comment: Yeah, I think he has, he's gone down very easy there, I know the arm comes across onto his shoulder but\n1:14 Comment: No, for me, he's gone down far too easily\n1:17 Comment: What a story that would have been, Filip Djoricic has only played 10 minutes of football for Southampton so far\n1:24 Comment: Came on for the closing stages of the match against West Ham\n1:28 Comment: Signed on loan from Ben Fikker, he said that he wants to stay in the club, he's enjoyed it more here\n1:34 Comment: Than he has at either Ben Fikker

Filip Coutinho produces one for the top draw\n2:40 Comment: To put Liverpool ahead\n2:43 Comment: Wow, what a fantastic strike that is\n2:46 Comment: Stunning goal\n2:48 Comment: Absolute stunning goal, just looking at his technique\n2:51 Comment: I mean it's a relatively slow build up for Liverpool, nobody in the ground thought for a minute he was going to hit it\n2:57 Comment: From there he bends it with power\n3:0 Comment: Outstanding finish\n3:2 Comment: Goalkeeper really no chance, he's hitting the underside of the bar\n3:6 Comment: What a start to this match\n3:11 Comment: Beautiful technique isn't it, the way he's going to whip it, whips it with power\n3:17 Comment: You'd be proud of that one\n3:20 Comment: Wonderful strike from Coutinho\n3:23 Comment: He scored against Bolton recently in the FA Cup, that's only his second goal in the last 16 games in all competitions\n3:29 Comment: But Southampton through at the other end straight away\n3:34 Comment: And Elia's effort is blocked, he flicked it away for a corner\n3:39 Comment: The Southampton players and fans think they should have had another penalty there\n3:45 Comment: Wow, it's all happening, he's flicked on\n3:49 Comment: Wow, I feel there, he hasn't made any contact with the ball there the defender\n3:55 Comment: Yeah, for me that's a penalty\n3:58 Comment: Referee's got that wrong\n4:1 Comment: Same pair involved\n4:2 Comment: Well Jose Fontes the Southampton captain leads the delegation of protestees to referee Kevin Frenk\n4:11 Comment: Joe Allen was the Liverpool player involved\n4:15 Comment: Didn't appear to make any contact with the ball\n4:18 Comment: Juri Cicci has caused real problems in the opening five minutes of this game\n4:22 Comment: But Southampton find themselves behind\n4:25 Comment: Ball worked in by target from the corner\n4:27 Comment: And in the end Mignolet can prevent another corner\n4:30 Comment: And Liverpool can just calm things down\n4:33 Comment: Well exactly, that's what they need to do, Gerrit Hitch involved again\n4:36 Comment: He's making that run right through the middle of that Liverpool team\n4:40 Comment: It's fanatic here in these opening exchanges from one end to the other\n4:45 Comment: Fascinating\n4:47 Comment: Well it's a penalty\n5:14 Comment: Well it certainly hasn't been dull in the opening five minutes or so\n5:21 Comment: Drifting over the head of target who's returned to the Southampton side today\n5:25 Comment: After a very nasty head injury that he picked up\n5:30 Comment: And the win away to Queen's Park Rangers\n5:34 Comment: Ryan Bertrand the first choice left back serves the last game of the three match ban for Southampton today\n5:40 Comment: And the target returning to the team\n5:45 Comment: Sterling chases, header from Yoshida\n5:49 Comment: And the target, Adam Lallana, getting involved in a few isolated boos for Adam Lallana there\n5:55 Comment: But Zeki Lovren will be the Liverpool player who will get the coldest reception from the Southampton fans today\n6:3 Comment: An easy one when you're coming back, you know, playing against your old team\n6:7 Comment: Of course the former captain is concentrating here on the back three\n6:11 Comment: This has been the real sort of strength of Liverpool's team this season\n6:15 Comment: And their weakness at times because you just saw there Clyde wanting to get into that hole\n6:21 Comment: They do clearly leave an awful lot of space on the flanks and that's a problem for Liverpool at times\n6:26 Comment: And a field for Markievicz\n6:38 Comment: And it's Clyde\n6:42 Comment: Ponsk\n6:43 Comment: Sturger heads the ball away\n6:53 Comment: And now for the throw which will be taken by Southampton\n7:4 Comment: It's Victor Wanyama\n7:7 Comment: Davis working in wide for target\n7:10 Comment: Another product of the famous youth policy here\n7:13 Comment: And a turn ball to him from Aljero Elliott\n7:16 Comment: I don't know that it might have been Sterling with a lovely touch\n7:19 Comment: He certainly had the beating of Yoshida for pace but it was a good recovery by the Japanese\n7:23 Comment: Read it well there Yoshida, for defending\n7:26 Comment: And a ball for Davis, Clyde able to bring it into Liverpool territory\n7:39 Comment: And a fourth shot at the end of the move from James Ward-Prouse\n7:43 Comment: Yeah it was a good move though\n7:45 Comment: Markievicz though showing that inefficiency as the wing back for Liverpool\n7:50 Comment: Just look at this, this is an earlier opportunity\n7:55 Comment: Just looking here at that penalty incident, for me that's a penalty\n7:59 Comment: Great save in the end\n8:5 Comment: Elliott was the player that Mignolet denied\n8:8 Comment: Had he given a penalty Kevin Frent?\n8:10 Comment: I wonder whether it would have been a yellow card or a red card\n8:12 Comment: There was another defender covering back along with Joe Allen\n8:15 Comment: Here's Chan who is the Liverpool player involved in the first penalty shot in the opening moments of the game\n8:22 Comment: This is what Southampton are so very good at, they really press you\n8:25 Comment: Liverpool getting no time at all in the back to build any attacks from that back three of theirs\n8:37 Comment: St Mary's a vibrant place when it's full as it is today\n8:41 Comment: This game has been sold out for a while\n8:44 Comment: It's very different to how it used to be just across the city from here at the Dell\n8:48 Comment: Where Southampton famously once beat Manchester United on the day where United changed their kit at half time\n8:54 Comment: Sir Alex Ferguson saying that the grey shirts couldn't be seen\n8:58 Comment: I wonder whether we'll have a change of kit in the second half here today\n9:1 Comment: Because Ronald Koeman has questioned the fact that both sides are wearing black shorts with the fourth official\n9:7 Comment: Well right and so\n9:10 Comment: These days you don't need to have that clash\n9:15 Comment: Sitting alongside Ronald Koeman there, Sammy Lee\n9:17 Comment: Who played just less than 300 games for Liverpool, twice a European Cup winner\n9:22 Comment: In his time at Anfield and a handful of games here as a player\n9:28 Comment: He was a part of a fantastic Liverpool story wasn't he, played on that right wing\n9:32 Comment: He knew his role within the side and he knows his role now\n9:36 Comment: Great opportunity for him here\n9:41 Comment: Here's Jordan Ive, the current right winger for Liverpool\n9:43 Comment: Not a bad ball in from him, back from Markievicz\n9:46 Comment: Time for Davis, target\n9:48 Comment: Very calmly, laying it back for Josida\n9:51 Comment: And held up well by Pella\n9:53 Comment: Movement comes from Juricic\n9:56 Comment: Elia in an advance role for Southampton as well here\n9:59 Comment: Pressed as a target, falls for Wanyama\n10:8 Comment: Kline taking on Markievicz\n10:11 Comment: And drawing the three-peat\n10:17 Comment: We talked about Markievicz really, makeshift defender\n10:20 Comment: Now you see it, doesn't want to defend\n10:23 Comment: It's a lazy foot he puts in there\n10:25 Comment: Puts his team in a difficult position\n10:28 Comment: Ward-Prouse might look extremely ungainly as he approaches these three kicks\n10:35 Comment: But he gets fantastic delivery on them\n10:37 Comment: He certainly does, he just loves to whip them\n10:39 Comment: He jumps into the ball a la Beckham doesn't he\n10:43 Comment: Bend it like Beckham\n10:45 Comment: He's got no shortage of time, he's a quick defender\n10:48 Comment: He's got a good defence, he's got a good defence\n10:55 Comment: He's got no shortage of time, he's a quick ten of Southampton players\n10:59 Comment: Liverpool defending zonally\n11:2 Comment: Font makes the run in towards the near post, it's delivered deep, too deep for Pella\n11:6 Comment: And Lovren just tracked his run\n11:8 Comment: It's going to be a Liverpool throw\n11:12 Comment: Just a little bit too much on it, a little bit too much pace\n11:15 Comment: Not enough width\n11:24 Comment: Here's Davies\n11:30 Comment: Forced that, he's hardly seen the ball except for one that rattled past him from Philippe Coutinho\n11:36 Comment: Southampton with the overwhelming majority of possession up to this point\n11:41 Comment: Liverpool with the lead\n11:43 Comment: Haven't seen the ball except for one that rattled past him from Philippe Coutinho\n11:47 Comment: Southampton with the overwhelming majority of possession up to this point\n11:52 Comment: Liverpool with the lead\n11:55 Comment: Hoping for a fourth successive win in all competitions today\n11:59 Comment: And a fifth in six league games\n12:2 Comment: Come on, Phil!\n12:32 Comment: Liverpool will be able to work their way with Lallana\n12:35 Comment: Back it comes again with Davies\n12:44 Comment: Sterling doing well to defend from the front, good pressure as well, played by Henderson\n12:49 Comment: Unfair pressure according to the referee, and Davies wins a free kick\n12:53 Comment: Yeah, referee I feel has got that right\n12:55 Comment: Certainly from a Liverpool point of view, Markievicz is just not doing enough\n12:59 Comment: If they're going to score, get an equaliser here, Sargent\n13:2 Comment: And I feel certain it's going to come on that right hand side\n13:4 Comment: Clyne is just getting forward at will\n13:10 Comment: Good ball in from target, and Sturridge covered it\n13:14 Comment: And Lovren will bring it away\n13:16 Comment: He wants the last man to score a winner for Southampton against Liverpool\n13:20 Comment: Facing his old club today, the three men who moved north from Hampshire to Merseyside\n13:24 Comment: Here's the departure, undoubtedly that rankled the most with the Saints fans\n13:29 Comment: I think that was because he'd only been at the club for a year\n13:32 Comment: And he talked about needing his ambitions to be fulfilled\n13:36 Comment: Well he's just given the ball away and that's got the loudest cheer of the day so far\n13:55 Comment: Ball for Fon, good pass for Ive\n13:59 Comment: Now Elliot\n14:3 Comment: To the pacey Dutchman who did well to keep it in\n14:6 Comment: The industry and tenacity is rewarded with a corner\n14:9 Comment: Well it's all Southampton, the line are having to get back their last ditch tackle\n14:15 Comment: They need a better ball in though this time\n14:24 Comment: Last corner worked short, this one\n14:27 Comment: Swung in by Wall Prouse\n14:32 Comment: In the lake, with time just to gather at the second attempt\n14:37 Comment: His improvement's been vast\n14:40 Comment: He looked as if he wasn't going to play for Liverpool again\n14:43 Comment: It's coinciding with the form of the team but\n14:45 Comment: When a keeper comes and takes the ball like that, it takes all the pressure away from his colleagues\n14:54 Comment: ANDocrat\n15:28 Comment: He feels that the number 10 role is his best position.\n15:34 Comment: The way the game is set up at the moment, it's all set up for Liverpool on the break with their pace.\n15:38 Comment: They're quite happy to sit back, get numbers, let Southampton have it.\n15:43 Comment: It's the first time we've really seen them get out since the opening changes.\n15:52 Comment: Here's Markovic.\n15:53 Comment: The battle between Markovic and Juricic.\n15:56 Comment: They know each other's game so well.\n15:58 Comment: Teammates with both the Serbian national team and also in the past with Benfica.\n16:8 Comment: Target winning the battle of the two number 33s in the air, but...\n16:12 Comment: ...at the expense of a throw.\n16:13 Comment: The Blues again tell you that Lovren's allowed in possession.\n16:18 Comment: They keep giving it to Minilane.\n16:20 Comment: He's not the best with his feet, that's for sure.\n16:23 Comment: Southampton reading that script, putting him under a lot of pressure there.\n16:44 Comment: It's a good through ball from Josip, a run from Ward-Proud, Lovren able to cut it out.\n16:50 Comment: The ball comes from Allen.\n16:51 Comment: Sterling dropping deeper.\n16:54 Comment: Coutinho's goal separates the sides.\n16:57 Comment: And he's won a throw.\n16:58 Comment: It's in fact only the third goal that Southampton have conceded in the last seven Premier League games.\n17:4 Comment: It's far and away the best defensive record in the Premier League.\n17:12 Comment: Solid foundation on which they've built their success this season.\n17:16 Comment: Ball from Ive, back to him from Lallana.\n17:23 Comment: The target does really well there because I thought he was going to give away a free kick, but he actually manages to pull his leg away.\n17:30 Comment: Lallana, a friendly little pass through for Ive.\n17:36 Comment: That's where they have to be careful, Southampton.\n17:38 Comment: With Liverpool's pace on the break, because really are they controlling the game Southampton with their possession?\n17:44 Comment: But Liverpool have that pace with Sterling and Ive on the sides.\n17:59 Comment: The target just lost his battle to keep that in.\n18:2 Comment: A straight pass from Yoshida.\n18:6 Comment: Just a bit sloppy there, wasn't it?\n18:8 Comment: You know, I think sometimes Southampton can be guilty of overplaying a little bit.\n18:11 Comment: They've got a big man up the front there, go straight into him at times and build from there.\n18:29 Comment: Lallana, gunning it back for Ive.\n18:33 Comment: Sterling.\n18:36 Comment: Coutinho.\n18:37 Comment: Now Markievicz.\n18:39 Comment: And for Philippe Coutinho.\n18:42 Comment: Sterling.\n18:43 Comment: He did well to retain the ball for as long as he did, but Wanyama can bring it away.\n18:47 Comment: Sterling made sure the panna couldn't hold it up.\n18:52 Comment: A right by Davis.\n18:57 Comment: And a touch by Coutinho that Sterling just didn't quite read in time.\n19:3 Comment: I think you saw there Wanyama when he was out of the team, what they were missing.\n19:6 Comment: The power that he has in that midfield.\n19:10 Comment: Exceptional.\n19:15 Comment: Liverpool started this match five points adrift of fourth place.\n19:20 Comment: They were to lose today and it would be six points with twelve games left.\n19:26 Comment: They can hold on though here.\n19:28 Comment: It'll be just a point adrift of Southampton at one stage.\n19:31 Comment: In November they were eleven points behind them.\n19:35 Comment: Here's Ive.\n19:37 Comment: Back for Allen.\n19:43 Comment: Coutinho.\n19:47 Comment: Markievicz always happy to be shown inside.\n19:49 Comment: Pomp with a crucial touch as Lallana ghosted in behind it.\n19:55 Comment: Certainly was, Lallana making a really good run.\n19:57 Comment: I don't see him getting the grips with Coutinho, particularly in that midfield.\n20:1 Comment: Southampton is floating between the front and the midfield.\n20:6 Comment: Of course he did that for the goal, but still looks very dangerous whenever Liverpool get good possession of the ball.\n20:14 Comment: Interesting that Lovren is playing on the right of the three centre-halves for Liverpool today.\n20:20 Comment: And Chan on the left.\n20:21 Comment: Chan is predominantly in that position, played on the right-hand side of the three.\n20:25 Comment: And Lovren, early season, played on the left.\n20:28 Comment: So a switch of tactics today for Brendan Roffes.\n20:30 Comment: I think they want him on the ball and maybe Chan is better, more accomplished in possession.\n20:34 Comment: And get the big man on his right foot where he's more proficient.\n20:44 Comment: Coutinho, Sterling made a darting run and got himself back onside.\n20:51 Comment: Font with the clearance.\n20:54 Comment: Yes, Font just getting that away.\n20:56 Comment: Sometimes that's what you need to do as a central defender, just clear the danger.\n21:0 Comment: Doesn't get enough credit, this fella.\n21:2 Comment: Been outstanding this season.\n21:5 Comment: Just missed the one Premier League game, but Jose Font is through suspension.\n21:10 Comment: A season which has brought in his first international caller.\n21:15 Comment: He's debuted for Portugal against Argentina.\n21:21 Comment: 200 Southampton games behind him.\n21:23 Comment: He's one of only two players who played in this mixture for Southampton last year,\n21:27 Comment: which was less than 12 months ago.\n21:29 Comment: He's playing again today.\n21:31 Comment: It shows you how...\n21:35 Comment: ...past the door that Southampton has revolved, both in and out, in the intervening year or so.\n21:45 Comment: You have to say they've coped magnificently, Southampton, with all the change.\n21:50 Comment: Markievicz.\n21:52 Comment: Cline with the block and managed to get the ball back off Markievicz for a Southampton throw.\n21:57 Comment: Excellent from Cline, another real success story this season.\n22:1 Comment: Cline getting into the England team, digging the first one into that challenge, wins it well.\n22:6 Comment: Southampton need to get tighter to Coutinho, and you can see there, that's what's happened.\n22:10 Comment: They've overdone it a little bit.\n22:12 Comment: They've got a bit of a run-up, but they've got a bit of a run-up.\n22:33 Comment: You can see there, that's what's happened.\n22:35 Comment: They've overdone it a little bit.\n22:37 Comment: Brendan Tush trying to get some information into his team.\n22:40 Comment: He wants them to pass the ball more, to boss this possession.\n22:43 Comment: At the moment, Southampton have had more of the ball,\n22:46 Comment: but Liverpool are looking very threatening on the break.\n22:56 Comment: Up to this point, no sign of a post-Europe hangover for Liverpool,\n22:59 Comment: who have taken seven points from six games\n23:2 Comment: after midweek European matches up to this point in the season.\n23:7 Comment: Two wins, three defeats in those matches\n23:9 Comment: following Champions League action before Christmas.\n23:15 Comment: Ball from target.\n23:18 Comment: Inevitably, the target of the longer ball from Southampton.\n23:23 Comment: Go on, go on!\n23:28 Comment: Sterling dispossessed.\n23:29 Comment: A shove from Wanyana before the challenge.\n23:35 Comment: Great challenge, though. That's what we're talking about there.\n23:37 Comment: Picking your moment as a defender to get that challenge in.\n23:44 Comment: Back, back!\n23:47 Comment: Get the box, get the box!\n23:50 Comment: Hey, hey, hey!\n23:51 Comment: Get the box!\n23:53 Comment: That just illustrates the point you were making, Martin.\n23:55 Comment: It's Wanyana that they've got to do a specific job on Coutinho now.\n23:59 Comment: Yeah, that's right. Just need to get him tighter,\n24:1 Comment: but it's difficult because Liverpool really have got good movement\n24:4 Comment: in that midfield with Alana, particularly.\n24:9 Comment: There's Alana right on cue, challenge from Davis.\n24:22 Comment: Mark Richner ahead of Juricic.\n24:36 Comment: Three home defeats for Southampton so far this season,\n24:39 Comment: beaten by both of the Manchester clubs.\n24:42 Comment: City, comprehensive winners here.\n24:46 Comment: Down against Manchester United, the scoreline didn't really tell the story at all.\n24:50 Comment: United winning, but Southampton the better side.\n24:55 Comment: Swansea came and did a very effective job on Saints\n24:59 Comment: in the penultimate home game.\n25:2 Comment: It never looked as though they were going to be breached in the last one.\n25:7 Comment: You look now at the shape, it's like back five for Liverpool.\n25:11 Comment: Southampton really dictating.\n25:13 Comment: That's the problem with the wing-back system.\n25:16 Comment: It forces your wide players back at times,\n25:18 Comment: and you have to concede possession.\n25:30 Comment: It's almost an orthodox back five now.\n25:33 Comment: Southampton playing with the two wingers in advanced positions,\n25:36 Comment: and Milošević and I stand touch-tight to them whenever they can.\n25:42 Comment: Elliott.\n25:43 Comment: Yep.\n25:48 Comment: Elliott makes a good run, but he doesn't have the quality to go with it.\n25:53 Comment: Again, it's a long ball into that channel, just over the middle-back's head.\n25:58 Comment: He needs better quality once he's in there.\n26:3 Comment: He burst onto the scene after sounding a loan from Berta Breyman\n26:6 Comment: with a couple of goals at Newcastle.\n26:8 Comment: Yet to score here, though, El-Jiro Elliott.\n26:14 Comment: He has been prepared to take chances on players whose careers have perhaps been a crossroads.\n26:19 Comment: Elio one of those, and Juricic certainly another.\n26:22 Comment: Here's Wanyama.\n26:29 Comment: Excellent run from Clyde, he's got the pace to get there ahead of Emery Chan,\n26:33 Comment: who's brought him down, has he?\n26:35 Comment: Referee and assistant both thought it was a legitimate challenge.\n26:39 Comment: Well, it's right under the nose of both the linesman and the referee.\n26:44 Comment: It's a great little run from Wanyama, puts it in the path of Clyde.\n26:50 Comment: Just about the right call, I think he's ever hit that ball,\n26:53 Comment: I don't think he's ever going to get on the end of it.\n26:55 Comment: I'm not sure there's really real contact there.\n27:1 Comment: It couldn't have been a better place, could they, the referee and the linesman?\n27:9 Comment: We want him on our side!\n27:15 Comment: That's Clyde that scored the goal for Southampton when the two sides met earlier this season on the opening day.\n27:21 Comment: On the opening weekend, should I say.\n27:23 Comment: And now a free kick has been given, this time it's Joe Allen who's at fault.\n27:27 Comment: I wonder if Brendan Rodgers will be tempted at half-time to make a change on that left-hand side.\n27:32 Comment: Markovic really knows he's in a game, there's some wind swept occasion, the conditions,\n27:37 Comment: and he's been really tested by Clyde.\n27:42 Comment: As I say, it is a strong wind, it's a strong wind that is blowing in Southampton's favour.\n27:47 Comment: And look at the faces of the Liverpool players at the moment.\n27:53 Comment: Another free kick for Ward-Browse to try and orchestrate something here for Southampton.\n28:3 Comment: Minulay, obviously just misjudged the flight of it in the breeze.\n28:9 Comment: Bought aside some time though.\n28:11 Comment: And then you can gather very safely when it comes back to him again.\n28:15 Comment: He gets away with one there, he almost forgets to put his hands in the air.\n28:19 Comment: Mischangement by Davis, which I couldn't quite seize apart.\n28:32 Comment: Well done.\n28:45 Comment: Here is Ives, still 19 years of age, really came of age in that loan spell.\n28:51 Comment: In the upper echelons of the Championship with Dabic.\n28:56 Comment: Remarkably though, he's cocked tight, isn't he?\n28:59 Comment: It's a meteoric rise, I think he's a quarter even his own club out.\n29:2 Comment: All for a scare call.\n29:27 Comment: Chest trap from Josida, Djuricic finding Pallak.\n29:31 Comment: Flying and fighting forward again down that Southampton right.\n29:35 Comment: And it's good movement from Ward-Browse.\n29:46 Comment: Ward-Browse pumps.\n29:47 Comment: Martinho showing the defensive side of his game.\n29:49 Comment: Couldn't get forward but...\n29:50 Comment: Pass cut out by Ward-Browse.\n29:51 Comment: Martinho was nearly in again, wasn't he?\n29:52 Comment: Just lovely the way he lays it off and then goes with real pace.\n29:55 Comment: Martinho showing the defensive side of his game.\n29:57 Comment: Couldn't get forward but...\n30:0 Comment: Pass cut out by Ward-Browse.\n30:2 Comment: Martinho was nearly in again, wasn't he?\n30:4 Comment: Just lovely the way he lays it off and then goes with real pace.\n30:16 Comment: And a lot of shoved over there by James Ward-Browse.\n30:19 Comment: And the free kick goes the way of Liverpool.\n30:24 Comment: It looks a foul to me, he pushed him in the back.\n30:27 Comment: Ironic cheers from the crowd here because they're not happy.\n30:30 Comment: A lot of decisions are going against them.\n30:54 Comment: Go on, go

go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on, go on\n31:24 Comment: I cannot believe that's not a penalty\n31:31 Comment: That's three that could have been given in this day\n31:36 Comment: The referee has to be certain, otherwise he can't give it\n31:39 Comment: It's almost as if he's not prepared to give a penalty of any sort today\n31:48 Comment: The target was Joshua who kept that in, here's Pellet\n31:51 Comment: He was onside, but the men didn't do anything with it\n32:2 Comment: A monster steal from Yoshida\n32:8 Comment: I certainly understand Raheem Sterling's frustrations that the penalty wasn't given\n32:14 Comment: He's a man whose body language suggests that he feels he's having one of those days today\n32:19 Comment: Yes, he is, and he doesn't need to reproach himself at all\n32:22 Comment: because he's been an outstanding signing for so long\n32:25 Comment: I think they seem to ignore him a lot of the time\n32:27 Comment: because he can be a great link player, as he does there\n32:31 Comment: And he's found Elliot\n32:33 Comment: Flashes back across towards Pellet\n32:37 Comment: Henderson scoops it clear\n32:48 Comment: Come on, Raheem, come on!\n33:18 Comment: It's not a case of just one or two though, you go as a group\n33:21 Comment: It stops Southampton building these attacks\n33:31 Comment: Wall-Prance\n33:37 Comment: The target just blocking off the run of Ive to make sure that he isn't going to be able to keep that in\n33:42 Comment: Good battle there between the two teenagers on the near touchline\n33:47 Comment: It is, and Ive has actually been asked to defend, he's almost playing like a full-back today\n33:56 Comment: He's climbed\n33:58 Comment: Now Wanyama\n34:6 Comment: Elliot\n34:13 Comment: Target beating Lallana\n34:16 Comment: He's lost his footing I think, allowing Allen to mop up for Liverpool\n34:25 Comment: Just overplaying there, Ive is keeping simple, we know he's got good ability\n34:29 Comment: but his team needs to keep hold of the ball there\n34:32 Comment: Hunters coming into this match in good form, Liverpool unbeaten in 9 Premier League games\n34:38 Comment: with 21 points from a possible 27 since the defeat to Manchester United a couple of months ago\n34:43 Comment: Seem to take 20 over the same period\n34:45 Comment: Here's the penalty shout\n34:48 Comment: Well actually, in fairness he takes that ball\n34:51 Comment: He takes that ball just, as he comes in look, he just takes it there\n34:55 Comment: and then takes him out after a point\n34:57 Comment: As he comes in look he just takes it there and then takes him out afterwards to the referee is so remarkably well\n35:12 Comment: Fairness to the referee couldn't have been better place. He's getting around the pitch\n35:15 Comment: He's not guilty of some referees who just seem to sort of tread that path in the center circle\n35:20 Comment: But he's really getting close to the action\n35:27 Comment: So\n35:57 Comment: We're across the Walker Street proceedings with more crowds this time.\n36:6 Comment: Henderson with the initial header away.\n36:9 Comment: More up than out.\n36:13 Comment: Still Liverpool living on their nerves defensively before a push.\n36:17 Comment: Additional free kick.\n36:19 Comment: Well that's great refereeing again because it is a little nudge on the player, Markievicz.\n36:24 Comment: It's the ball that comes in which has caused mayhem for Ward-Prouse.\n36:29 Comment: You can see that little nudge.\n36:32 Comment: Referee does really well to pick that up.\n36:50 Comment: It's the first real lull we've had in this game today.\n36:54 Comment: Ward-Prouse for Elliott.\n36:59 Comment: Punching the ball with the outside of his right foot.\n37:1 Comment: Skirville came back to cover.\n37:3 Comment: That was a right ball. Test that Liverpool defence.\n37:14 Comment: A large Liverpool hold on to leads when they get them.\n37:18 Comment: They've taken a few of them.\n37:20 Comment: They've taken a 1-0 lead on 16 separate occasions in the Premier League so far this season.\n37:25 Comment: Won 11 of those matches but were beaten by both Chelsea and Palace in these circumstances.\n37:34 Comment: That lead defeated Crystal Palace, which was really the low watermark of the season.\n37:38 Comment: Liverpool down in 12.\n37:41 Comment: It was the catalyst to quite a bit of soul searching.\n37:45 Comment: Only lost twice since.\n37:49 Comment: Coutinho's goal, the difference between the two sides this week.\n37:53 Comment: Approach the final five minutes of the first half here.\n37:56 Comment: Touch from Elliott.\n37:58 Comment: Pella unable to get the better of Lovren.\n38:5 Comment: Run back well.\n38:6 Comment: Here's Juricic.\n38:13 Comment: Now Font.\n38:14 Comment: I think Juricic have unearthed another little jewel there, haven't they?\n38:18 Comment: He's very tenacious.\n38:20 Comment: He can play.\n38:24 Comment: Hasn't got a good goal scoring record, Filip Juricic.\n38:28 Comment: Won 28 league games without a goal.\n38:31 Comment: A run that stretches back the best part of two years but...\n38:35 Comment: You can see that he's enjoying his football.\n38:38 Comment: This is where Koeman's got this massive vocabulary around Europe with players.\n38:42 Comment: He can go in and bring them and make them better as a club.\n39:12 Comment: Come on!\n39:16 Comment: Come on, Messi!\n39:17 Comment: Come on!\n39:42 Comment: Finding those little pockets of pace.\n39:43 Comment: Sterling, Coutinho linking really well.\n39:59 Comment: Eiben's target renewing their appointments and then Elliott...\n40:2 Comment: Comes in and fouls Eibe and this is a free kick in a promising position for Liverpool.\n40:7 Comment: His strength from Eibe, he's drawing the foul.\n40:11 Comment: Played mostly as a fullback in his opening first half.\n40:16 Comment: That's what he's renowned for though, taking on the players, taking on the fullback.\n40:19 Comment: Good battle with him and target.\n40:21 Comment: Hey!\n40:23 Comment: Just one!\n40:30 Comment: Three down, three down!\n40:32 Comment: Keep going, keep going!\n40:33 Comment: I don't think we should be underestimating these conditions that the players are playing in here as well today.\n40:37 Comment: That's a goal, yeah!\n40:46 Comment: He wins!\n40:47 Comment: A massive sliding in the free kick too deep for Skrtle.\n40:49 Comment: Come on!\n40:52 Comment: Come on, come on!\n40:58 Comment: Come on!\n41:22 Comment: Foul by Lallana.\n41:33 Comment: It's in those areas I think target really could go straight into the front man.\n41:37 Comment: We've just seen four or five passes, Southampton haven't gone anywhere, they've been forced back.\n41:42 Comment: Sometimes just go into the big man.\n41:43 Comment: They tried to do it there anyway, Yoshida, and then he's 10 or 15 yards further back.\n41:48 Comment: It's an even more difficult ball to play.\n41:56 Comment: Here's Lallana.\n41:58 Comment: He certainly wanted the ball to be played into feet early, he made an excellent run.\n42:2 Comment: Couldn't hide his dismay when it wasn't.\n42:5 Comment: Lallana does win a throw.\n42:7 Comment: Had to make some 50 yard passes.\n42:10 Comment: Lallana does win a throw.\n42:11 Comment: Had to make some 50 yards or so.\n42:18 Comment: 250 games as a Southampton player, Adam Lallana actually started his career as a school boy down the coast from here in Bournemouth.\n42:27 Comment: A foul throw by Ibe.\n42:33 Comment: Here by target.\n42:34 Comment: Pannock.\n42:35 Comment: Ward-Browse.\n42:36 Comment: Caught by Lovren.\n42:40 Comment: Will it be the first yellow card of the game? It is.\n42:45 Comment: It was almost inevitable it was going to be him.\n42:48 Comment: The fans are like a pantomime villain, isn't he, today?\n42:55 Comment: Definite free kick.\n42:58 Comment: And a booking.\n43:1 Comment: Fifth quotient of the season for Dejan Lovren.\n43:4 Comment: Featuring in only a third Premier League game in the last ten.\n43:9 Comment: Another ball, launch forward, Skirkle dealing with that one.\n43:13 Comment: And Mignolet.\n43:15 Comment: Can't get a feel of the shot from Klein very easily.\n43:19 Comment: With all the possession they've had, they haven't really created too many worthwhile chances, particularly in the latter stages of this first half.\n43:26 Comment: No. And Peller as well, as you saw there in the link for that free kick, where he went in, chested the ball off.\n43:31 Comment: He's got outstanding talent and they simply don't go into him enough.\n43:37 Comment: No!\n43:39 Comment: He's retreated from an offside position, but Elie is in.\n43:42 Comment: And Mignolet was he outside the penalty area when he handled that.\n43:46 Comment: Referee looked straight across to his linesman.\n43:49 Comment: It did look as though it was handball.\n43:52 Comment: And Southampton, who've had two penalty appeals turned away.\n43:57 Comment: Think that Mignolet possibly should have had a red card for a deliberate handball there.\n44:2 Comment: Well, it was a great run. Peller was in an offside position, but Ele running from deep, breaks that offside trap.\n44:11 Comment: Here's Elie again, winning a corner, but should he have won more?\n44:16 Comment: Well, the referee, I mean, this is where Peller's offside, but Ele's not. He runs from deep.\n44:20 Comment: He tries to lift it over the goalkeeper.\n44:24 Comment: It's inconclusive there.\n44:28 Comment: Is it another outstanding decision from the referee?\n44:32 Comment: No!\n44:37 Comment: Ward-Prouse to take it.\n44:42 Comment: Appeals for handball this time inside the six-yard box. Nothing given.\n44:48 Comment: Back from Ward-Prouse.\n44:52 Comment: Elie up.\n44:55 Comment: And he wins another corner.\n44:57 Comment: I think when Ronald Koeman sees the replay...\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Moreno has come on to replace Markovic on the left-hand side of what has frequently\n0:4 Comment: been a back five for Liverpool.\n0:7 Comment: Well, no surprises there.\n0:9 Comment: We said Markovic was very lucky to be on the pitch to start with.\n0:13 Comment: Brendan Rodgers identifying that problem.\n0:16 Comment: So I've heard of Moreno, a former Sevilla man coming off.\n0:20 Comment: A touch of the start of the second half for Dejan Lovren.\n0:26 Comment: Now I.\n0:27 Comment: I'm judged to have been onside as he received the ball there from Lallana.\n0:46 Comment: Chances for the Liverpool man to push forward down that touchline were few and far between\n0:52 Comment: in the first 45 minutes.\n0:55 Comment: That's Lovren, back for I.\n0:56 Comment: Strong run from Lallana, Coutinho the goal scorer.\n0:57 Comment: Now Allen.\n0:58 Comment: That'll be done by Sturling.\n0:59 Comment: Mo Chan, a venturing forth on the back.\n1:0 Comment: That's Savant and Winifred.\n1:1 Comment: For the first time in a row, the team have been able to get a win.\n1:2 Comment: And it's a win for Liverpool.\n1:16 Comment: Mo Chan, a venturing forth on the back.\n1:19 Comment: That's Savant and Winifred.\n1:24 Comment: Well the general consensus of opinion seems to be,\n1:27 Comment: that Savant and Lallana might have had two penalties in the first half.\n1:30 Comment: That the handball claim against Simon Mignolet was too close to court.\n1:35 Comment: And thus fall within an acceptable margin of error, as far as the officials are concerned.\n1:39 Comment: There was still a real sense of injustice for Ronald Koeman and his brother.\n1:45 Comment: Yeah, I think Savant's a little bit unlucky.\n1:47 Comment: Maybe a couple of penalties he didn't get.\n1:49 Comment: But certainly for the officials, it's a very, very difficult one.\n1:52 Comment: Tough one.\n1:53 Comment: They've enjoyed their break at half time.\n1:56 Comment: Penalty, ball over the top now for Elliott.\n2:1 Comment: Might have been a close call for offside as well.\n2:3 Comment: Elliott's done well to work it in, but couldn't find more.\n2:6 Comment: Prowse has made the near-close run.\n2:8 Comment: Well that might have been controversial, because he looked a tad offside there, Elliott.\n2:23 Comment: Djuricic.\n2:25 Comment: That's Argy.\n2:30 Comment: And that by Lovren.\n2:31 Comment: And Schneidling puts it out of play for a throw.\n2:34 Comment: Schneidling coming on at half time there, as he's a very important player.\n2:39 Comment: Reads danger so well, and it could be that they're just going after this equaliser.\n2:43 Comment: Him there, just to steady the shift.\n2:51 Comment: Savant hoping to do today what they've done so rarely in the past, and that is win.\n2:55 Comment: Win conceding first.\n2:57 Comment: They've won only one of the last 36 Premier League games when they've gone 1-0 down.\n3:2 Comment: It was a victory at West Ham earlier in the season.\n3:9 Comment: Started the second half.\n3:12 Comment: Marked five hours without a goal here at St Mary's for Southampton.\n3:17 Comment: The last one, a Scott Danone goal early in the FA Cup defeat to Crystal Palace.\n3:23 Comment: Here's Josida.\n3:26 Comment: Now Schneidling.\n3:28 Comment: The one ball from Clyde.\n3:31 Comment: Moreno tracks across and concedes the first corner of the second half.\n3:34 Comment: Yeah, and I think you see there in one moment why Moreno's on the pitch.\n3:38 Comment: Markievicz just wouldn't have had a clue that that Clyde was going forward there.\n3:44 Comment: And he's got it.\n3:53 Comment: He wouldn't have had a clue that that Clyde was going forward there.\n4:8 Comment: Just checking the legitimacy of the placement of the ball here for Warped Rouse.\n4:14 Comment: Again, a bloody whip on it.\n4:15 Comment: Lallana knew what was coming and could head away.\n4:18 Comment: And here's Wanyama.\n4:36 Comment: Excellent ball there from the full-staff.\n4:40 Comment: A bit of a play between Elia and Wanyama as well.\n4:47 Comment: Pellatt, Elia.\n4:49 Comment: Schneidling read the challenge and did it very well.\n4:53 Comment: It's Pellatt from a distance, but he couldn't get hold of it.\n4:59 Comment: No, just doesn't get enough purchase on it.\n5:2 Comment: Schneidling did well there, though.\n5:3 Comment: Good interchange.\n5:5 Comment: Opens up Pellatt, maybe could be better off just feeding it there for the runner outside of him.\n5:11 Comment: As you say, he hasn't scored for a while.\n5:13 Comment: He's just took the laces off it, as they say.\n5:19 Comment: Pellatt, Elia.\n5:21 Comment: It's Janne Pellatt, the man brought in to replace Ricky Lambert, who sits on the Liverpool bench today.\n5:27 Comment: Lambert, top scorer in four of his five years here at Southampton.\n5:36 Comment: Rogers in deep discussion there with Mike Marsh and Colin Pascoe about further changes that might be necessary.\n5:43 Comment: Lallana.\n5:45 Comment: That's a Liverpool throw.\n5:50 Comment: I think they're just talking about this midfield.\n5:53 Comment: Woodside, Ward-Trowse has gone a little bit more central.\n6:0 Comment: Wanyama going out wide, so he's changed it in that midfield a little bit.\n6:7 Comment: 14-heavy for Lallana.\n6:9 Comment: Raheem Sterling back in the side today, struggling with his foot problem.\n6:14 Comment: Scored against Southampton on the opening day and he's got six goals in his last 12 games.\n6:20 Comment: Problem here is the ball getting to go outside the penalty area.\n6:28 Comment: Retaking the ball, he's got it.\n6:31 Comment: He's got it.\n6:38 Comment: Retaking goal kick and he's fine.\n6:51 Comment: It's not a good game against Pellatt.\n6:57 Comment: They're cutting it out but Sterling is offside.\n7:0 Comment: Sterling wants that ball much earlier, making a really good run there out of shot.\n7:5 Comment: Henderson not seeing it early enough.\n7:22 Comment: Well by Henderson.\n7:23 Comment: He's come off the worst of the two players as well after the challenge with Wanyama.\n7:28 Comment: I think Henderson's complaining that he just ran into him but he puts that arm out to check the run.\n7:35 Comment: He's saying how do I get out of the way of that but for me, he blocks the run.\n7:53 Comment: He's got it.\n8:24 Comment: He might have given Joallon a free kick but he didn't stop play when Coutinho was fouled.\n8:41 Comment: Sterling, now Coutinho.\n8:45 Comment: Off could only steer it through for Lallana.\n8:48 Comment: Sterling, oh the flag came up really late.\n8:51 Comment: There's a free kick to Southampton.\n8:56 Comment: It's almost as if the crowd here are making all the decisions for the referee and linesman.\n9:20 Comment: Race for Champions League football.\n9:22 Comment: History certainly in the making as far as the South Coast Club are concerned.\n9:26 Comment: They've taken more points per game than in any other top division season in their history.\n9:31 Comment: Even better than when they finished second at Liverpool back in 1984.\n9:37 Comment: They'll all have to be stopped here because of that collision.\n9:41 Comment: Yoshida, a Southampton player involved.\n9:43 Comment: Sterling's okay as well I think.\n9:45 Comment: Sadio Mane is getting stripped and ready for action for Southampton.\n9:50 Comment: Yeah, I think that's totally unintentional there.\n9:57 Comment: Yoshida falling into the far for Sterling and Sterling then catching him.\n10:10 Comment: Southampton's second change imminent then.\n10:13 Comment: Mane, the war cry as we understand.\n10:21 Comment: Liverpool fans in fine voice as well they might be.\n10:25 Comment: Remember they're within a point of their opponents if they can hold on to this lead.\n10:35 Comment: We are a side that over the recent past have done well in the final thirds of seasons.\n10:41 Comment: That will just give the Liverpool fans even more confidence.\n10:44 Comment: Here is the change then. War cry is coming off.\n10:47 Comment: And Sadio Mane coming on to replace him in the Senegalese international.\n10:54 Comment: An up and down time since his £10 million move from Red Bull Salzburg.\n11:1 Comment: And there's the change.\n11:8 Comment: An up and down time since his £10 million move from Red Bull Salzburg.\n11:14 Comment: He's got good pace doesn't he?\n11:18 Comment: Yes indeed.\n11:20 Comment: He's got a couple of important goals as well in the past.\n11:23 Comment: Against both Chelsea and Arsenal.\n11:26 Comment: Henderson made an excellent run forward there.\n11:28 Comment: It was an important block by target as I've tried to find him.\n11:31 Comment: And it will be a Southampton throw.\n11:32 Comment: Just going back to that point about Liverpool and the way that they finish seasons.\n11:36 Comment: They took 34 points in the final 13 games last season.\n11:40 Comment: The Revenue has just won defeat in that time.\n11:43 Comment: They lost only two of the final 13 games the previous year.\n11:46 Comment: He's so tied up there that if they can hold on here,\n11:51 Comment: you will feel that the least fourth position is a really eminent possibility.\n11:57 Comment: And I think that's what we're going to see.\n11:58 Comment: The least fourth position is a really eminent possibility.\n12:2 Comment: It was only really the Palace game that the wheels came off for Liverpool last year.\n12:6 Comment: So they fancy themselves Liverpool.\n12:10 Comment: First contribution from Mane, trying to get the better of Emre Can.\n12:14 Comment: And failing to do so.\n12:16 Comment: He does well there Can.\n12:18 Comment: Again he's improving defensively certainly.\n12:20 Comment: We know he can play, he's pretty well a midfield player.\n12:23 Comment: But his defensive duties and qualities are growing all the time.\n12:26 Comment: He's high.\n12:29 Comment: And it took three to stop him.\n12:36 Comment: Target.\n12:41 Comment: And it's a good recovery for Maid.\n12:44 Comment: He'll be able to get himself back between target and the ball.\n12:47 Comment: I think Maid has just got a little bit more pace than him.\n12:50 Comment: Just looking at the change that they've made.\n12:53 Comment: Just Mane, Mane playing in that little hole there.\n12:56 Comment: Almost simulating a little bit what Liverpool are doing.\n13:0 Comment: The only difference being that Southampton are playing with four at the back.\n13:3 Comment: But they've got these two blocks of two in the midfield.\n13:6 Comment: Sneijder and Yama giving them the base at the bottom of that midfield.\n13:15 Comment: Both teams really sort of cancelling each other out at the moment.\n13:18 Comment: It's almost a game of chess.\n13:23 Comment: Go on, Mane!\n13:54 Comment: Liverpool's defensive record poor earlier in the season.\n13:57 Comment: At one stage only five clean sheets in 35 games.\n14:0 Comment: But six in the last 11.\n14:2 Comment: Another one here today will give them a crucial victory.\n14:5 Comment: Under pressure now.\n14:7 Comment: Mane!\n14:9 Comment: Great block by Skirtle for a corner.\n14:11 Comment: Yeah, great defending.\n14:13 Comment: Mane just giving you that extra pace.\n14:15 Comment: Good technique as well.\n14:19 Comment: And with Will Prowse off the field, it will be a very close game.\n14:23 Comment: It will be Schneidlin who will take corner duties now.\n14:33 Comment: Skirtle there ahead of Josip, another important touch.\n14:37 Comment: The Slovakian inside his own penalty area.\n14:40 Comment: Clear by Moreno.\n14:42 Comment: Henderson.\n14:43 Comment: The break was on for Liverpool for a moment.\n14:47 Comment: The target did very well to assuage the threat.\n14:49 Comment: And there was no margin for error.\n14:51 Comment: Liverpool moving forward so quickly.\n14:54 Comment: One stage, almost four against one.\n14:57 Comment: Yeah, Schneidlin, we've said it already, is there to put up the pieces.\n15:1 Comment: This game's really opening up now.\n15:4 Comment: Mane.\n15:13 Comment: In for Mane, yep.\n15:16 Comment: Trying to use his target but he couldn't reach.\n15:19 Comment: Well, Elie has almost missed an impossible ball there.\n15:22 Comment: He seems to have dropped off a little bit, Elie.\n15:25 Comment: He was complaining earlier that he didn't get enough options on the ball there.\n15:28 Comment: He just decides to swing it in and there's just too much on it.\n15:43 Comment: Daniel Sturridge will be on in a moment, as you can see.\n15:46 Comment: And he scored the winner against Southampton on the opening day,\n15:49 Comment: which wasn't that long before he picked up the bad injury\n15:53 Comment: which saw him sidelined for 32 games for Liverpool.\n16:0 Comment: Sturridge will be on in a moment.\n16:7 Comment: Mane.\n16:17 Comment: Coutinho.\n16:24 Comment: Maybe well to win it back after his misplaced pass for Luis Coutinho there.\n16:28 Comment: Yeah, but that's the start of the game. Coutinho's really worked out his closing down off the ball,\n16:32 Comment: doing that brilliantly there for his team.\n16:40 Comment: Adam Lallana leaves the field.\n16:42 Comment: Hasn't been able to make the impact that he would have wanted\n16:45 Comment: as he returned to his former club.\n16:47 Comment: A few Southampton supporters applauding him.\n16:52 Comment: There's a company of boos as he leaves to be replaced\n16:56 Comment: by Sturridge, who today plays his 50th Premier League game for Liverpool.\n17:1 Comment: 33 goals he has scored in that time.\n17:7 Comment: It could be a record-breaking appearance for him today\n17:9 Comment: if he finds the net.\n17:13 Comment: I think we'll see Sterling go deeper and Sturridge take up that main position\n17:17 Comment: down the middle.\n17:25 Comment: Paul van Kley.\n17:27 Comment: Miscue by Emre Can.\n17:29 Comment: He's skirtled, read it well.\n17:32 Comment: Becoming increasingly valuable, Sterling, in the back of that\n17:35 Comment: Very strong player now.\n17:37 Comment: Mr Reliable.\n17:42 Comment: Another excellent game today by him, Sturridge.\n17:45 Comment: He goes against Wanyama.\n17:53 Comment: A yellow card for him as well.\n17:55 Comment: I think there's a bit of bitterness coming in here.\n17:58 Comment: He feels he gets a foot on that.\n18:0 Comment: For me, that's a good, healthy, shallow ball.\n18:2 Comment: It's certainly not a book-in.\n18:4 Comment: It's not even a free-kick.\n18:9 Comment: The yellow card of the season for Victor Wanyama.\n18:19 Comment: Almost 20 minutes into the second half.\n18:21 Comment: What does Ronald Koeman do here to try and get Southampton\n18:25 Comment: into more scoring positions?\n18:28 Comment: Well, he's made a mistake.\n18:29 Comment: He might want to make another one.\n18:31 Comment: Just got to keep believing, keep going forward.\n18:35 Comment: Be more direct as they are now.\n18:37 Comment: He's got more pace with Mane on the pitch.\n18:39 Comment: Just need to do things quicker.\n18:46 Comment: Djericic has faded after that.\n18:48 Comment: Really bright start.\n18:49 Comment: That's a nice pass though.\n18:53 Comment: Winning the throw from I.\n18:55 Comment: He's got a bit of a run-up.\n18:57 Comment: Winning the throw from I.\n19:2 Comment: Ives does really well there again, doesn't he?\n19:3 Comment: So many times you see wingers not prepared to defend.\n19:6 Comment: You can't say that about that young man.\n19:21 Comment: Not exactly blessed with options.\n19:23 Comment: Took him a while to restart play there.\n19:27 Comment: Nice touch around the corner.\n19:29 Comment: Good turn as well inside the penalty area by Mane.\n19:35 Comment: He could still survive.\n19:37 Comment: Mane is just a bit too clever there.\n19:51 Comment: Do they go back again Southampton?\n19:53 Comment: Just not prepared to play it long.\n19:54 Comment: The crowd are urging them to play this ball through to Pelé.\n20:9 Comment: Sturgill again beats Pelé in the air when it is played long.\n20:18 Comment: Sterling for Coutinho.\n20:20 Comment: Sturridge forced wider than he wanted to go.\n20:25 Comment: Moreno.\n20:27 Comment: Good Liverpool move this.\n20:29 Comment: But the finish didn't match it.\n20:34 Comment: Thanks to the Liverpool fans that Henderson's shot was carried over the line by Fraser Forster.\n20:37 Comment: But the ball had already gone over the lines of goal kick.\n20:42 Comment: Sturridge there, lovely little backheel.\n20:45 Comment: Really good vision.\n20:47 Comment: Just look at now the...\n20:49 Comment: It's like Sterling and Sturridge are playing alongside each other.\n20:51 Comment: Interchange so much.\n20:53 Comment: There's a fluidity between them.\n20:55 Comment: It's very difficult really to pick those Liverpool players.\n20:58 Comment: I feel that Sterling is actually playing a little bit deeper than that.\n21:2 Comment: That diagram was showing us.\n21:4 Comment: But at times he can be all the way up and other times he can come back into that midfield.\n21:17 Comment: Schneidling.\n21:19 Comment: Schneidling sends it wide for Clyne.\n21:23 Comment: Guagnola.\n21:41 Comment: Just put the season into perspective for Southampton.\n21:44 Comment: They only need 11 more points to record their highest ever.\n21:48 Comment: Premier League total.\n21:50 Comment: Well of course they had the best ever season defensively in the top division campaign as well.\n21:55 Comment: They've already picked up more points than they have in 8 previous Premier League seasons.\n22:0 Comment: It's a season where most people thought they might struggle to get to 40 points.\n22:5 Comment: Yeah but you've got to keep going, keep pushing, keep raising the bar.\n22:10 Comment: They set themselves really high standards and they want to keep them and maintain that.\n22:13 Comment: It's Staten if they lost this game but it will be a big blow for them.\n22:23 Comment: To third. I've asked Manchester United if they can score twice in the last quarter and win.\n22:29 Comment: Shannon's coming in there for Mane, Marechal.\n22:32 Comment: Away by Moreno.\n22:34 Comment: Come back by Yoshida.\n22:38 Comment: Elliott.\n22:43 Comment: Just wanted too much time in possession and Henderson was there to pick his pocket.\n22:48 Comment: One-half by target. Schneidlin takes over.\n22:57 Comment: Mane.\n23:1 Comment: Wukong Wanyana.\n23:3 Comment: Here's Mane again.\n23:5 Comment: Foul by Henderson.\n23:6 Comment: And a free kick to Southampton in a promising position.\n23:14 Comment: I think it's Mane there, he's moving the ball so quickly that Henderson in the end just gives away a free kick.\n23:20 Comment: I thought Elio there should have shot from distance, took too long.\n23:24 Comment: We're talking about moving the ball quickly. They have to be patient and just move it, shift it quicker.\n23:29 Comment: This Liverpool defence could crack if you ask it questions.\n23:32 Comment: Because there's real pace now on the pitch for Southampton.\n23:39 Comment: Morgan Schneidlin hasn't scored since back in September.\n23:49 Comment: He's the man standing over this free kick.\n23:52 Comment: Djuricic has had himself a fair bit of space on the right-hand side of the box.\n23:57 Comment: Moreno's alive for that, he's pointed it out to his teammates but nobody's got the cover.\n24:1 Comment: And in the end, they couldn't find it.\n24:4 Comment: The pass was too well disguised, not even Djuricic read it.\n24:9 Comment: Well I think that's been worked on on the training ground.\n24:12 Comment: Djuricic just switches off the way that Schneidlin's looking at him.\n24:16 Comment: But for me, you see the quality of the players now.\n24:20 Comment: I'm surprised Henderson hasn't taken that shot off.\n24:23 Comment: I'm sure Wally's got a chance to get it back.\n24:25 Comment: The quality of the players now, I'm surprised Henderson hasn't taken that shot off.\n24:29 Comment: I'm sure Ward-Kraus would have done it if he was still on the pitch.\n24:36 Comment: Djuricic has been spoken to by the referee.\n24:40 Comment: He's been calmed down after...\n24:42 Comment: You've hardly seen Djuricic in this second half.\n24:45 Comment: I thought maybe he might have got the nod to come off.\n24:49 Comment: Doesn't look fit to me.\n24:55 Comment: The British are starting a game in the Premier League.\n24:58 Comment: Very different to a cameo appearance off the bench in the Bundesliga.\n25:4 Comment: It's been what his role has been for much of the season so far.\n25:8 Comment: Filip Djuricic with Mites.\n25:19 Comment: Coutinho wins the free kick.\n25:22 Comment: Guignamo's not complaining.\n25:32 Comment: Koeman does have two attacking options left on the bench if he decides that he wants to replace Djuricic.\n25:38 Comment: Tadic on, Shane Long is sweating in the wings as well.\n25:42 Comment: Here's Sturridge now for Liverpool.\n25:44 Comment: Great turn by Daniel Sturridge, trying to go alone.\n25:47 Comment: It's a brilliant tackle but caught in the end.\n25:50 Comment: Majestic approach play though from the England striker.\n25:54 Comment: Wow, this is a spellbinding, isn't it?\n25:57 Comment: The way that he just goes past people but in the end Guignamo...\n26:0 Comment: It's a great challenge for him.\n26:4 Comment: Ball from Moreno.\n26:6 Comment: Sorry, Yoshida there.\n26:9 Comment: Ball snap.\n26:11 Comment: Just a nervy moment.\n26:13 Comment: Difficult playing conditions, had to make sure that he would keep his speed.\n26:16 Comment: Djuricic, had a lot more of a chance to survive his stumble than perhaps he should have done.\n26:38 Comment: Just complaining about the time wasting here.\n26:41 Comment: Well, I'm right and so.\n26:47 Comment: Clearly, twice beat Liverpool as the boss of Benfica in the Champions League but...\n26:53 Comment: Hasn't in other games.\n26:59 Comment: Now they just ask Batsy Mata to climb there.\n27:6 Comment: But he's quick but he's not that quick.\n27:11 Comment: I don't think anybody's that quick.\n27:13 Comment: I think they're just running out of ideas Southampton.\n27:14 Comment: This is where...\n27:16 Comment: For so long they've been in that top four position.\n27:19 Comment: You've got to keep believing.\n27:23 Comment: Liverpool have played a lot of games recently and this will test them in the closing stages.\n27:30 Comment: This is the 42nd game that Liverpool have played in all competitions this season.\n27:45 Comment: Here's Mourinho.\n27:47 Comment: He's got Sturridge waiting, put it in behind him and good ball for Sterling!\n27:50 Comment: 2-0!\n27:55 Comment: The deflection in his course.\n27:58 Comment: But Raheem Sterling doubles Liverpool's lead.\n28:1 Comment: This is going to be a big, big win for them.\n28:4 Comment: The deflection off back target, deceiving Fraser, forced that.\n28:8 Comment: And Liverpool have reignited their Champions League aspirations.\n28:11 Comment: Well, I mean, listen, this is just a ball, a sloppy ball across the back.\n28:15 Comment: And they're on to you in a flash.\n28:17 Comment: Mourinho puts the ball across and target there just fluffs his lines.\n28:21 Comment: And Sterling does the rest.\n28:23 Comment: You can't afford to make mistakes around them.\n28:26 Comment: Two mistakes in the build-up.\n28:28 Comment: Look at this ball in here.\n28:30 Comment: Target completely misses his clearance.\n28:35 Comment: And just puts it on a plate for Sterling.\n28:38 Comment: Takes it back, gets it back.\n28:39 Comment: For Sterling.\n28:41 Comment: Takes a deflection as well, he's lucky.\n28:44 Comment: Maybe the goalkeeper should save that in the end.\n28:47 Comment: But Brendan will take that piece of luck.\n28:56 Comment: Raheem Sterling's tenth goal of the season, seventh in his last 13 games.\n29:3 Comment: Liverpool follow it by making their final change.\n29:5 Comment: Jordan Eibov and Glenn Johnson.\n29:8 Comment: Nice come on to replace him.\n29:10 Comment: Mistake by target.\n29:13 Comment: Falling for Sterling but plays a force that got a right hand to it, couldn't keep it out.\n29:22 Comment: So had to make their final change as well.\n29:24 Comment: Tadic John to replace Djuricic.\n29:29 Comment: Should have been on earlier for me.\n29:31 Comment: A little bit late now, perfect for Liverpool.\n29:33 Comment: 2-0 up. Eibov's gone off.\n29:35 Comment: Done a great job for them.\n29:37 Comment: And then suddenly you turn to an international player to come on.\n29:45 Comment: That look of resignation about him coming on, that he made that change just a little bit too late.\n29:54 Comment: This will be an eighth Premier League defeat for Southampton and a sixth against one of the other sides in the top seven.\n30:1 Comment: They haven't been able to beat the sides in contention for Champions League football.\n30:6 Comment: We've been with the sole exception of Arsenal here and Manchester United away.\n30:14 Comment: If you were to draw up a mini league between both sides in the top seven, Southampton would be comfortably bottom of it.\n30:20 Comment: It's further ground this weekend unless they can turn this around dramatically in the closing stages.\n30:38 Comment: I think we saw Tottenham come from two behind earlier today.\n30:42 Comment: I used to say Southampton can't do it but Liverpool looking very secure.\n30:45 Comment: Lovren in strongly. Dispossess Elliott.\n30:52 Comment: Back from Schneiderlin.\n30:57 Comment: Way by Skirpert.\n31:5 Comment: Kline. Now Mane.\n31:7 Comment: Now Mane.\n31:11 Comment: Just deflecting off Moreno.\n31:13 Comment: Cannon with a shot on the turn straight at Skirpert.\n31:17 Comment: He's had several important blocks this afternoon. That one was certainly the unwitting variety but important nevertheless.\n31:25 Comment: It was a great swivel and blast wasn't it from Pella. That's what he's capable of.\n31:31 Comment: Almost a shot in anger.\n31:38 Comment: Kline.\n31:40 Comment: Mane.\n31:42 Comment: Sliding shot in from Moreno. Free kick to Southampton.\n31:48 Comment: I think Moreno there can't believe he's been...\n31:51 Comment: He's given a free kick away. It looks like he's calling him over to book him as well.\n32:3 Comment: Maybe that's for his reaction.\n32:8 Comment: He does get the ball when he's high.\n32:20 Comment: Dushan Tadic.\n32:24 Comment: I don't think they were any bit clever about this one. The last free kick they had in a similar position.\n32:29 Comment: They fluffed their lines.\n32:31 Comment: Tadic is going to take this on.\n32:37 Comment: Tadic.\n32:46 Comment: It's a pretty generous 10 yards away.\n32:54 Comment: Tadic set up a grandstand finish by getting Southampton back in the game.\n33:1 Comment: Not a bad strike.\n33:2 Comment: Mignolet held it well.\n33:5 Comment: It's difficult with a wet ball in these conditions.\n33:8 Comment: It's a lovely strike and the save is equal to it.\n33:12 Comment: I have to say the conditions here. It's a wet top.\n33:15 Comment: Kepa just very very good with his technique there.\n33:19 Comment: It's very solid today Mignolet.\n33:29 Comment: Mane.\n33:31 Comment: Nice control.\n33:37 Comment: Tadic chasing.\n33:39 Comment: And again with an excellent defensive contribution.\n33:42 Comment: The girls happy to see that ball played there.\n33:45 Comment: I think Mane really should be bending that into Pella again in the far post with his hands in the air demanding they cross it.\n33:52 Comment: He's letting Liverpool off the hook too many occasions.\n34:1 Comment: Three sides have managed to score twice in the game against Southampton all season.\n34:7 Comment: Two Manchester clubs and Liverpool who have now done it twice.\n34:19 Comment: Brendan Rodgers in a recent revival with Liverpool continues the pace.\n34:25 Comment: This will be a six winning seven.\n34:26 Comment: Well it's thumbs up from Brendan isn't it?\n34:29 Comment: He's been delighted with his team so far.\n34:31 Comment: This is a very difficult place to come and get anything at all.\n34:35 Comment: Job done so far.\n34:38 Comment: Just need to be professional Liverpool to see this through.\n34:57 Comment: Manjaro winning it back.\n34:59 Comment: Four from Tadic.\n35:1 Comment: Too far ahead of Mane.\n35:15 Comment: Mignolet.\n35:17 Comment: Using as much time up as he thinks he can get away with.\n35:22 Comment: Which every goalkeeper would in this situation.\n35:26 Comment: Here's Sturling, score of the second goal.\n35:31 Comment: By Font, four from Kline.\n35:35 Comment: Played by Skirtle.\n35:48 Comment: Target.\n35:51 Comment: Off target.\n35:53 Comment: Well I hope his confidence doesn't suffer too much there.\n35:56 Comment: He knows he's been responsible for that second goal.\n35:59 Comment: I think he just slipped when he went to clear the ball.\n36:2 Comment: It can happen to anyone.\n36:4 Comment: It's about showing character now after that mistake has been made.\n36:15 Comment: Henderson.\n36:18 Comment: Sturridge dropping deeper to feed him with the return ball.\n36:22 Comment: Another big week of course for Liverpool.\n36:25 Comment: Besiktas in the Champions League.\n36:28 Comment: Coming up on Thursday before the Premier League action returns.\n36:33 Comment: Manfield with Manchester City the visitors next weekend.\n36:38 Comment: You see how hard that Liverpool midfielder working, Henderson.\n36:41 Comment: Trying to get back for his team.\n36:44 Comment: Those are the qualities you need.\n36:46 Comment: All about goal scoring.\n36:48 Comment: Got to work hard for the team and Liverpool prepared to do both this match.\n36:53 Comment: Good challenge from Font.\n36:57 Comment: And good industry from Kline to make sure that the ball didn't go out of play for a corner.\n37:5 Comment: This will be a third successive win for Liverpool against Southampton.\n37:10 Comment: One of the third time they would ever have won here at St Mary's.\n37:16 Comment: No foul by Johnson. Play goes on with Tadic.\n37:22 Comment: Elia can't drive through.\n37:25 Comment: It will be a Southampton throw.\n37:28 Comment: Elia again showing far too much of that ball there to the Liverpool defender.\n37:39 Comment: Saw one for Glenn Johnson who used to play his trade just down the coast from here at Portsmouth.\n37:44 Comment: I think you see there he just overruns it.\n37:48 Comment: Inadvertently I think he's put his foot over the ball.\n37:50 Comment: I thought Glenn Johnson doesn't look too serious.\n38:4 Comment: Seems to have hurt his shoulder or his wrist as he's hit the ground.\n38:12 Comment: That was going to be very painful.\n38:15 Comment: He's going to have to continue if he can because Liverpool have made all three changes.\n38:18 Comment: There's seven minutes of stoppage time remaining.\n38:28 Comment: What a difference that is now for Brendan Rodgers and Liverpool compared to how life looked back in mid-November.\n38:35 Comment: Yes, very much so. He puts these long runs together. It's quite remarkable.\n38:39 Comment: I think if they can win this today, what are they just a point behind Southampton really closing the gap?\n38:50 Comment: Obviously not over yet but so far so good.\n38:58 Comment: Look, that's almost a rugby tackle there. I think they're saying that he's got a booking.\n39:5 Comment: He's got a booking. Can't complain about that.\n39:11 Comment: That's yellow card number seven of the season for Henderson.\n39:14 Comment: Tough tackle, wasn't it?\n39:17 Comment: That in perspective, that's seven yellow cards in 39 games in the heart of midfield.\n39:23 Comment: But another free kick to Southampton. Can they make the most of one of these set-piece opportunities?\n39:28 Comment: Tadic again with the delivery. Six for him to try and hit.\n39:31 Comment: Liverpool pass that examination again.\n39:36 Comment: Coutinho just crowded out of it. The referee's given him a free kick.\n39:44 Comment: Well, the Southampton players looking a bit perplexed by that decision from the referee.\n39:52 Comment: Southampton feel a little bit hard done by this.\n39:54 Comment: Maybe a couple of penalties they could have had at vital times in the game.\n40:1 Comment: It's not just Mourinho that feels as if every decision goes against him.\n40:25 Comment: Allen.\n40:29 Comment: Emre Can.\n40:31 Comment: Alberto Mourinho.\n40:38 Comment: Gordon Coutinho.\n40:40 Comment: Mourinho just trying to draw Pond out of position.\n40:42 Comment: Sturridge.\n40:56 Comment: Brilliant lead from Coutinho. It's a goal.\n40:59 Comment: And it's a goal.\n41:10 Comment: Brilliant lead from Coutinho.

    "summary": "Southampton hosted Liverpool at St. Mary’s Stadium in a compelling Premier League clash marked by intense action, controversy, and some mesmerizing moments of individual brilliance. Liverpool, donning their change kit, were set to kick from left to right as the match commenced on what promised to be a gripping encounter.\n\nRight from the kickoff, the game's pace was set. An early touch by Matt Targett quickly led to a deep drop from Graziano Pellè, who played an incisive ball forward, showcasing the Italian’s vision within the opening moments. Controversy struck almost immediately as Southampton's Filip Đuričić was brought down in the box by Emre Can, sparking loud appeals for a penalty within just 20 seconds. However, the referee waved play on, deciding against the penalty, a decision many in the stadium disagreed with.\n\nĐuričić, making only his second appearance for Southampton, appeared promising, adding to the narrative potential of the game. Lovren, a former Southampton player now with Liverpool, was met with a cacophony of boos by the home crowd early on, setting a tone for his every touch.\n\nLiverpool took an early lead in breathtaking fashion through Philippe Coutinho. In the third minute, a series of passes found Coutinho who, from considerable distance, unleashed a stunning strike that bent powerfully and struck the underside of the bar before nestling into the net. The goal encapsulated Coutinho’s remarkable technique and left the Southampton goalkeeper with no chance. The Brazilian’s celebration was deserved as he had placed Liverpool in front with a goal that was more than worth a try - it was outstanding and drew admiration even from neutrals.\n\nSouthampton attempted to respond quickly. Eljero Elia forced a corner, and once again, penalty appeals filled the air for the home side. Joe Allen’s involvement in the defensive header raised suspicions among Southampton supporters, who felt aggrieved as no penalty was awarded. Further efforts by Southampton were consistently stifled by Mignolet and a resilient Liverpool defense, highlighting the narrative of the opening frantic exchanges.\n\nWhile Southampton pressed and maintained possession effectively, they lacked the cutting edge to convert opportunities into goals. Their appeals for penalties, first involving Joe Allen again and later Emre Can on Nathaniel Clyne, were denied, exacerbating feelings of injustice. Liverpool’s calmer disposition enabled them to control the tempo intermittently, with Gerrard Hitz orchestrating movements through the midfield.\n\nMarkovic’s underperformance as a makeshift defender was evident as he consistently struggled against the pace of Clyne. This weakness was something Southampton looked to exploit, and they nearly did on several occasions, but ultimately, they lacked the precision.\n\nAs the first half wore on, Liverpool’s goal continued to separate the sides, despite Southampton dominating possession. Defensively, Southampton remained solid, but the Liverpool backline, sharply organized by Skrtel and Lovren, was steadfast. Mignolet was particularly impressive, his form this season reflecting a marked improvement from earlier matches.\n\nThe pattern of the game was shaped by the midfield battle, with Vlado Wanyama and Jordan Henderson standing out. Liverpool's Djuricic imposed himself well, dropping deep to aid defensive duties, but Lovren’s every tackle was under scrutiny from the Southampton faithful.\n\nThe half came to a close with Liverpool still leading 1-0. Ryan Bertrand’s suspension meant Southampton's backline relied heavily on Targett, who, despite involvement in multiple duels with Liverpool’s swift attackers, held his ground. This tactical contest between the wingbacks of both teams intrinsically defined the course of the match.\n\nThe second half began with Brendan Rodgers making a necessary tactical switch, substituting Markovic for Alberto Moreno, intending to bolster the left-hand side's defensive resilience. This strategy provided notable stability, as Moreno’s defensive acumen evidenced in tracking back and intercepting threats from Clyne.\n\nSouthampton continued to press but without penetration. Djuricic faded as the game went on, and despite the hosts maintaining possession, the incisiveness required to breach Liverpool’s defense was amiss. Schneiderlin’s entry into the game provided quiet strength and continuity in midfield for Southampton, but not the game-changing impact required.\n\nMoments of tension were frequent in the second half, with close offside calls and skirmishes for the ball adding to the atmosphere. Elia’s endeavours were commendable but ultimately rendered ineffective by Liverpool’s entrenched defense. Attempts from Southampton, including some hopeful efforts from Pelle, did not trouble Mignolet’s goal significantly.\n\nLiverpool’s counter-attacking threat remained potent throughout the second half. Sturridge, who had endured a long injury layoff earlier in the season, was introduced and immediately became a menace with his pace and vision. A particularly notable moment saw him produce a spellbinding run, almost establishing a second for Liverpool, if not for a last-ditch intervention by Yoshida.\n\nThe critical second goal for Liverpool arrived through Raheem Sterling. After a mix-up in Southampton’s defense, Moreno’s low cross found its way to the feet of Sterling, who, benefiting from a slight deflection off Targett, slotted home with ease to double the advantage. This goal, celebrated with fervor, all but secured Liverpool’s position in the race for Champions League qualification.\n\nSouthampton’s subsequent responses involved bringing on Shane Long and Dusan Tadic to add fresh legs and attacking impetus, but the damage was already substantial. Schneidling and Mane provided momentary sparks, but Sturridge’s introduction meant Liverpool always looked dangerous on the break.\n\nIn a game punctuated by controversial refereeing decisions, missed opportunities, and moments of genuine quality, Liverpool’s clinical edge proved decisive. They occupied possession astutely, nullified Southampton's pressing waves, and showcased a defensive robustness that had become emblematic of their resurgence in form. The closing stages were marked by Liverpool maintaining professional poise under Southampton’s relentless, albeit toothless, onslaught.\n\nAs the final whistle blew, Liverpool walked away with a 2-0 victory, a result reflective of their efficiency and tactical nous in face of considerable pressure. Southampton, feeling the sting of denied penalties and lapses in critical moments, found themselves outfoxed despite their territorial dominance. The result had significant implications, elevating Liverpool within touching distance of a Champions League spot and highlighting Southampton’s defensive frailties against top-level opposition. The encounter was a testament to the Premier League’s unpredictable, intense charm and the very fine margins that often separate victory from defeat."
