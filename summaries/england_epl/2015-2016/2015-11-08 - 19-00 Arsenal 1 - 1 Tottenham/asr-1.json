possibility of getting the team out from behind.\n8:50 Comment: That was being dominated in the last minute, two minutes.\n8:53 Comment: And he took the team out well and left the team out of the game.\n8:56 Comment: Or at least caused the loss with that long ball from Arsenal.\n8:58 Comment: With which Kyle Walker will play on the throw-in for the experts.\n9:3 Comment: Leaving the ball there, the mela, too much, because he was attentive in his defensive work\n9:6 Comment: As always Coqueland.\n9:7 Comment: Long mirror, check.\n9:11 Comment: He stopped Dilly Ali upside down.\n9:15

mela,\n9:36 Comment: The mela, Adani Rose, the center of Rose, opens it well.\n9:39 Comment: And he stops that ball, low, check.\n9:42 Comment: Good arrival with phenomenal recovery from Tottenham.\n9:48 Comment: A fight there that Giroud and the two Tottenham centre-backs are going to have, both of them\n9:54 Comment: Belgian, Alderweireld, Lieberthongen.\n9:56 Comment: I apologize, check, but your serve seemed very good to me, very good.\n10:4 Comment: From Buschi, back to Cazorla.\n10:6 Comment: Well intervened Ozil, dry cut, perfect.\n10:9 Comment: To Eric Dier.\n10:10 Comment: Ozil puts it inside, Alexis Sánchez returns, he slips.\n10:14 Comment: The German, but he doesn't lose the ball, Arsenal.\n10:16 Comment: You lose it now, which is good pressure from the mela, it's missing.\n10:19 Comment: Peter Atkinson.\n10:26 Comment: So ball to the Gunners.\n10:34 Comment:  Up there.\n10:35 Comment: The lack is debatable, debatable at least.\n10:38 Comment: There, Arsenal must try to make sure that what runs is the ball.\n10:42 Comment: Those types of actions in which they retain the ball, try to get away from an opponent\n10:48 Comment: That height of the field can take more away than give you, in my opinion.\n10:53 Comment: There, the more you play with the first touch, the better.\n10:56 Comment: And there Ozil and Alexis have gotten involved a bit.\n11:0 Comment: The dead ball.\n11:4 Comment: Again for Arsenal.\n11:6 Comment: Campbell.\n11:8 Comment: They have seen that it does not gain much height.\n11:10 Comment: Santi Cazorla does recover, in any case, Arsenal through Tottenham's clearance.\n11:14 Comment: With Campbell.\n11:17 Comment: He wants to overwhelm Danny Rose, he couldn't do it.\n11:20 Comment: Good defensive help

lost the ball.\n11:35 Comment: It seems like he's finally staying, definitely Arsenal, right?\n11:38 Comment:  Yes Yes.\n11:39 Comment: He worked several sessions.\n11:40 Comment: He has been at Arsenal for many years now, but seeing how Benguer put the seal on him to leave,\n11:45 Comment: This year with the losses he is having opportunities.\n11:48 Comment: Do you think that if the team had a match like the one in the World Cup right now,\n11:52 Comment: With the losses, are you having opportunities?\n11:54 Comment: Do you think that if right now the team had Wiltshire, Ramsey, Walcott, etc., etc.,\n12:0 Comment: Rosicky, because Campbell would have the role he has had lately.\n12:6 Comment: But of course, the losses give him the opportunity to play.\n12:11 Comment: Well, what are you doing today against Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham.\n12:14 Comment: He already played in Munich the other day too.\n12:16 Comment: He was one of those who went out into the field to do what they could.\n12:23 Comment: Mertelsaka.\n12:25 Comment: The German mirrored it.\n12:27 Comment: The other German.\n12:35 Comment: Four came to have Arsenal at the same time last season.\n12:38 Comment: Until January when Podolski left because the season also started.\n12:41 Comment: Then Nabri, also German, plus Mertelsaka and Ozil were loaned out, however.\n12:47 Comment: Very Teutonic.\n12:48 Comment: Arsenal's last campaign.\n12:50 Comment: Another Zeric Daya.\n12:53 Comment: Kyler Walker, dispatch.\n12:55 Comment: Not as crossed as I intended.\n12:58 Comment: So without problems the goal for Petr Cech.\n13:4 Comment: With Sergio Fabián, Alderweireld.\n13:11 Comment: A squire and the goal out of bounds.\n13:13 Comment: The one from Atlético de Madrid.\n13:14 Comment: It's a game.\n13:15 Comment: Petr Cech, we already have the Czech's plan to equal David James with 169 games without\n13:21 Comment: conceive a goal in the Premier League.\n13:23 Comment: The record solo moment for David James.\n13:28 Comment: Today he can equal it, if he doesn't concede any goals.\n13:31 Comment: Petr Cech.\n13:34 Comment:  Mesut Ozil.\n13:37 Comment: For Kokelan.\n13:38 Comment: The Gaul does it for another Gaul from Bouchy.\n13:41 Comment: Bertonghen is crossed.\n13:47 Comment: How does Atlético play lately?\n13:49 Comment: With four centre-backs, as always.\n13:51 Comment: That is, with Van Alderweireld, Bertonghen and Neufeld and Kokeln.\n13:55 Comment: And Vermaelen sometimes.\n13:56 Comment: And Vermaelen.\n13:57 Comment: Recovered.\n13:58 Comment: With four centre-backs, with Bertonghen and Neufeld.\n14:1 Comment: And Bertonghen.\n14:2 Comment: And Vermaelen sometimes.\n14:3 Comment: And Vermaelen.\n14:4 Comment: Recovered.\n14:5 Comment: With four centre-backs, which is how Belgium has been playing for a long time.\n14:9 Comment: Because he always places centre-backs on the sides.\n14:16 Comment: And that sometimes hurts the team, because that often happens, felining in the center\n14:21 Comment: from the field, it makes the team a little heavy, a little...\n14:26 Comment: Belgium often lacks dynamism.\n14:29 Comment: And the team doesn't understand that.\n14:32 Comment: It is incredible, because it is a team that you see, has a lot of quality, and many\n14:35 Comment: Sometimes you spend 90 minutes waiting for them to make a good play.\n14:40 Comment: And it's a little frustrating, but hey, he has time to prepare Marc well for the European Championship\n14:44 Comment: Wilmots.\n14:46 Comment: He has tremendous doses of quality in his hands.\n14:49 Comment: And physically too, I think he has everything.\n14:52 Comment: With all those you mentioned, with set pieces in attack, a very powerful team.\n14:57 Comment: And what comes from behind.\n14:58 Comment: A fantastic under-19 generation and a under-17 that has just done a good job in the World Cup.\n15:4 Comment: With players like Azzawi or Ademoglu, who are tremendous.\n15:7 Comment: Be careful with these names.\n15:9 Comment: There goes a Belgium, precisely Dembele.\n15:11 Comment: April Musa Dembele for Harry Kane.\n15:14 Comment: The center without tension, without condition of Harry Kane.\n15:20 Comment: Touch from Alexis, who stopped braking.\n15:23 Comment: Deli Alli, Joel Campbell counterattacks, the cross ball is good from Campbell.\n15:27 Comment: Mesut Özil with a certain danger, with a lot of danger in the action for Alexis.\n15:31 Comment: That ends in a corner.\n15:34 Comment: As long as Arsenal can run they will enjoy it.\n15:37 Comment: And you'll probably find your best options that way.\n15:40 Comment: When Tottenham add people to the attack and have a turnover like this, so dangerous.\n15:46 Comment: There we are going to see the best version of Arsenal for sure, in speed.\n15:51 Comment: Now set piece.\n15:53 Comment: Opportunity for the Gunner team's horses.\n15:57 Comment: The second one, Corner.\n15:59 Comment: The other one was from the other profile.\n16:9 Comment: The fans are in that sector, in that corner of Tottenham.\n16:14 Comment: River of Mesut Özil.\n16:20 Comment: Petr Atkinson is missing Mertel Saker, because he is doing the same thing that I don't know if it was Bertonga or Alderweireld.\n16:26 Comment: Yes, this is one of the things that really cannot be fixed in football.\n16:33 Comment: The ease with which attacking fouls are always called in corners.\n16:37 Comment: They also give penalties with that ease.\n16:41 Comment: The grips began to end, but no.\n16:44 Comment: The easy thing is to always whistle the foul in attack.\n16:47 Comment: And that's what referees are doing, at least since I can remember.\n16:51 Comment: It won't change.\n16:53 Comment: Nor in Martin Atkinson, unfortunately.\n16:56 Comment: Ball that follows the line.\n16:59 Comment: Pierluigi and Lina whistled for them sometimes and that's why for me he is the best referee I have ever seen.\n17:5 Comment: The one who went off script.\n17:7 Comment: That Arsenal script.\n17:9 Comment: Now for the clearance Tobias Alderweireld.\n17:12 Comment: Alexis Sánchez quite active.\n17:14 Comment: The Chilean in these first 17 minutes of the game.\n17:17 Comment: Center Alexis.\n17:19 Comment: Clear Dani Rose.\n17:20 Comment: Step away a little Marcelo.\n17:22 Comment: Eric Daya comes to endure, to receive there.\n17:24 Comment: Harry Kane can't get it.\n17:26 Comment: Because there he has the possibility of giving his team a break.\n17:29 Comment: To stop that ball, to protect it so that your team can go out and get oxygen.\n17:35 Comment: But he lost it.\n17:38 Comment: Possession is beginning to increase in favor of Arsène Wenger's team.\n17:43 Comment: Arsenal is starting to get into a high rhythm and it's hard for Tottenham.\n17:46 Comment: It is very difficult for him to reach the speed with which Arsenal moves the ball.\n17:54 Comment: Well, although Tottenham is playing behind.\n17:58 Comment: It's getting late in the afternoon right now.\n18:0 Comment: Start giving the afternoon to Alexis Sánchez, to Kyle Walker.\n18:3 Comment: What's left.\n18:6 Comment: The side will have to receive help.\n18:8 Comment: In fact Tottenham when Musa Dembele plays.\n18:10 Comment: Supplying Harry Kane.\n18:12 Comment: He has a pass to the left for Eriksen.\n18:14 Comment: He has intervened little so far.\n18:16 Comment: It's a bit Danish.\n18:18 Comment: But there he receives the ball and you can always expect his quality.\n18:21 Comment: Any isolated play, but any isolated play of talent.\n18:26 Comment: Touch of Rose.\n18:28 Comment: Dembele after sending Harry Kane.\n18:30 Comment: Dembele is going to shoot.\n18:32 Comment: He saw it clearly, he saw it clearly because he didn't see any other option clearly because he didn't have it.\n18:35 Comment: He shot and caused the corner kick.\n18:37 Comment: Of course Harry Kane played well with his back turned.\n18:39 Comment: At first, very well facing Dembele.\n18:42 Comment: That he had the opportunity and at least he had those two meters, two and a half meters.\n18:46 Comment: To arm the leg.\n18:48 Comment: And where they give them they take them because they also have great headers.\n18:51 Comment: Alderweireld, Bertonghen, Alli, Dyer, Kane.\n18:54 Comment: Tottenham.\n18:56 Comment: Dembele who receives short.\n18:58 Comment: Distribute again for Eriksen.\n19:0 Comment: The thread that is not enough.\n19:2 Comment: I shoot out.\n19:4 Comment: Christian Eriksen.\n19:8 Comment: To the left of Cech's arch.\n19:12 Comment: One of the greats.\n19:13 Comment: As defined, without any doubt, of course, by Arsène Wenger.\n19:17 Comment: Yesterday at the press conference they asked him about Cech.\n19:20 Comment: A leap in quality from Arsenal is decisive for me.\n19:24 Comment: If Arsenal wants to fight for the title, having a goalkeeper like this is an unparalleled condition.\n19:30 Comment:  Without a doubt.\n19:32 Comment: Eriksen's touch.\n19:34 Comment: He did the same thing there in short, well, Dele Alli for Harry Kane.\n19:36 Comment: Let's see if Kyle Walker shows up, not right now.\n19:38 Comment: But the ball goes to Eric Lamela.\n19:40 Comment: On the front, now Walker is joining.\n19:41 Comment: How good Walker, reaching the baseline.\n19:43 Comment: Let's see if you can pinpoint the center.\n19:45 Comment: No, because Kokelan's recovery is very good.\n19:47 Comment:  Great job.\n19:49 Comment: Somewhat scary Walker.\n19:51 Comment: He got out of the way when he saw Kokelan coming, who was coming like a freight.\n19:55 Comment: And Walker really jumped.\n19:57 Comment: Alexis, Arsenal's best so far.\n19:59 Comment: Distributing for Mesut Özil.\n20:1 Comment: I also intervened in German.\n20:3 Comment: In his third season at Arsenal.\n20:6 Comment: Kusielny, Mertesacker.\n20:8 Comment: And he receives Santi Cazorla from behind.\n20:10 Comment: Once again, of course.\n20:12 Comment: On the list from the forest, for those two friendly ones.\n20:14 Comment: Anti-England and Belgium.\n20:16 Comment: Mirror-check.\n20:20 Comment: And the balloon cut by Dani Roos.\n20:22 Comment: Mertesacker is coming.\n20:25 Comment: He takes the ball off.\n20:27 Comment: What the play called for was not going to be complicated.\n20:29 Comment: Clear head Bertonghen.\n20:31 Comment: The ball to the right.\n20:32 Comment:  Constantly.\n20:34 Comment: Someone will take it down.\n20:36 Comment: In this case, Dani Roos.\n20:38 Comment: Another sorrow.\n20:40 Comment: Mahugut Yoris.\n20:42 Comment: Tottenham's irregular goalkeeper.\n20:44 Comment: With the one you never know.\n20:46 Comment: He can make a save or he can make a big mistake.\n20:53 Comment: The ball bounces for Musa Dembele.\n20:55 Comment: And what Barça asks.\n20:57 Comment: The ball on the left.\n20:59 Comment: And the ball on the right.\n21:0 Comment: With

touch.\n21:12 Comment: Let's go to Dani Roos's face.\n21:14 Comment: Let's see what happened.\n21:16 Comment: I was coming there in a fight with Joel Campbell.\n21:18 Comment: I don't know if Campbell took his arm out for a walk.\n21:25 Comment: It's not going to clarify for us if the referee has been slapped\n21:28 Comment: or if Roos is telling him stories.\n21:30 Comment: There is a slap, a clear foul by Joel Campbell.\n21:37 Comment: You ate the option, Martin Atkinson.\n21:40 Comment: Fish and chips, Martin Atkinson ate it all.\n21:47 Comment: An error of judgment, that type of error can be understood, it is something you have not seen\n21:56 Comment: And therefore he hasn't whistled, but the truth has been quite clear.\n22:2 Comment: Danny Rose is rightly angry, good ball that Cech is playing, Per Mertesaka.\n22:9 Comment: Lack of thin ones.\n22:15 Comment: Receiving a ball on your back that is also thrown at you quite hard, which you have to cushion\n22:22 Comment: With a lot of quality and there Cazorla has done what he could.\n22:25 Comment: And with a rival who is breathing down your neck, that's a mistake, for me it's a pass.\n22:31 Comment: What Cazorla has done is not a mistake, he has really done what he could.\n22:35 Comment: I think giving a ball to a teammate in that situation is a mistake.\n22:40 Comment: It didn't cost Arsenal dearly so far.\n22:44 Comment: Eric Daya goes to the ground with his back turned.\n22:47 Comment: Lack of Chirut.\n22:51 Comment: Chirut thinks Eric Daya is starring in an interesting pool.\n23:4 Comment: Tottenham is not in a big hurry, if it has to be, to pick up its coach,\n23:9 Comment: We have already seen the passion he is going to put into it.\n23:13 Comment: Evidently they are 0-0 and holding on is the idea.\n23:21 Comment: Gift from Tottenham, gift from Arsenal.\n23:28 Comment: Alexis Sánchez, he recovered the ball well in defense, Nacho Monreal, he doesn't last long for Arsenal.\n23:33 Comment: De Lialy, he puts it inside for Eriksen, the one from Denmark turns well.\n23:37 Comment: He has no shots from there, but he continues the play, looks for another pass, Debussy held up perfectly well.\n23:44 Comment: Rothfield, good pressure from Daya, great pressure from Daya, help from Harry Kane between the two.\n23:51 Comment: Daya, again for Kane, now it's Rothfield who's pushing, Harry Kane is behind him, good but he's missing.\n23:58 Comment: He doesn't lose face with the Tottenham game by any means, even though he has stretches in which he suffers.\n24:4 Comment: Arsenal is a team that has a hard time defending away from its area, we already know that.\n24:9 Comment: It is a team that also tends to break a little, to split.\n24:13 Comment: And Tottenham takes advantage of that, as they immediately surpass the first line of Arsenal players, 3-4, who usually stay on top.\n24:21 Comment: And from there it hurts Wenger's team.\n24:27 Comment: The set piece for Spurs, Eriksen.\n24:30 Comment: Eriksen hits, goes to the far post, shot wide, Erik Daya.\n24:38 Comment: The Tottenham midfielder arrives well at the far post, he is a great header like so many Spurs teammates.\n24:44 Comment: It has escaped the Arsenal players, because that is a ball to the far post to a player that no one has noticed.\n24:50 Comment: Totally alone, and if Daya shoots inside the goal, it is a play for the Arsenal players to look at each other\n24:58 Comment: And look for responsibilities, because he really is a footballer who is visible to everyone and who is totally alone.\n25:6 Comment: It was seen live and in the replay, Erik Daya.\n25:10 Comment: 25 in the match at the Emirates, with this goalless draw.\n25:20 Comment: Mauricio Pochettino's Tottenham playing, getting the ball through Jan Vertonghen.\n25:28 Comment: It hasn't been anything good, nothing precise.\n25:30 Comment: Arsenal recovery with Mertesak and Kokelan relying on Kostielny.\n25:38 Comment: Delay Alexis, Kokelan, leave Giroud behind, he did not continue the pass.\n25:44 Comment: Good Giroud with the Ozil situation.\n25:48 Comment: Alderweireld, Sarrayan Walker, again Alderweireld for Vertonghen, Belga for Belga.\n25:56 Comment: Let's go to Erik Daya.\n25:58 Comment: And we see Roy Hodgson, the shot that could not be missing, of course, and that we mentioned before.\n26:2 Comment: Roy Hodgson seeing the man, among others, whom he has just called up for the England team for the first time, Erik Daya.\n26:8 Comment: That defeat against Spain in Alicante.\n26:10 Comment: Eriksen has won a sprint over Debussy, which seems worrying to me for the French full-back.\n26:18 Comment: Because Eriksen has a lot of virtues, I didn't consider him a fast player,\n26:22 Comment: At least it is not a virtue that he shows or shows very often.\n26:27 Comment: But in that sprint he clearly beat Debussy, who is a winger and in theory a fast footballer.\n26:37 Comment: Let's see if there are any chances to see if Debussy is in alarmingly poor shape.\n26:46 Comment: Today, of course, Bellerín's absence is very noticeable.\n26:50 Comment: At this point in the game he has normally made 4 or 5 arrivals to the baseline with fantastic appearances.\n26:58 Comment: Speaking of the other right back, Kyle Walker is going to join now, although he continues to play the mela.\n27:2 Comment: Finally open for Walker, baseline, throw to center, Kyle Walker.\n27:7 Comment: It's going to be Dele Alli's turn, who hasn't played on the other side, Dani Busch.\n27:11 Comment: But Tottenham comes easily. They have no problem stepping on the opponent's field, being deep.\n27:16 Comment: Arsenal finds it very difficult to defend from far away, we have already mentioned it.\n27:21 Comment: And it is allowing Tottenham, really with a fairly simple game, without doing anything out of this world,\n27:27 Comment: But he is stepping on the area quite frequently.\n27:30 Comment: It's a game in which there are no great scoring chances, but the feeling is that anyone can score.\n27:36 Comment: If the goal were to come, it could be for either team.\n27:40 Comment: Giroud holds the ball, he bent it well, he lowered it well for Alexis Sánchez, under pressure from Eric Lamela.\n27:50 Comment: Opens Mertes, serves for Debussy, against Ericsson.\n27:56 Comment: Debussy, let the ball roll, he made a mistake there.\n27:59 Comment: Dani Busch, although he then corrects the defensive position and covers Joel Campbell.\n28:5 Comment: Dele Alli, let's see if it's against Tottenham.\n28:8 Comment: It has never happened in Lamela, but the Argentine is going to press well, he did very well.\n28:12 Comment: Watch out for Harry Kane's pass to Lamela. Lamela with Monreal, fantastic action by Monreal.\n28:18 Comment: There Lamela has a problem, he is an extremely slow player.\n28:22 Comment: In fact, it is one of its great shortcomings, speed.\n28:28 Comment: On that occasion, with a little more speed, Lamela stood alone.\n28:32 Comment: Giroud opening perfectly for Ozil, Ozil relies on Alexis Sánchez.\n28:37 Comment: He takes the ball away from Mbele, Ozil recovers it, it will reach Sánchez.\n28:41 Comment: The Chilean's cutback centers Ozil, not very well.\n28:45 Comment: Bayern mirror.\n28:47 Comment: Defensive help from Kane, a break, Tottenham throw-in.\n28:50 Comment: Monreal is in the game, Kyle Walker.\n29:0 Comment: A match with not much pace so far, just some stretches.\n29:5 Comment: But not in continuous play, the clash is not very dynamic.\n29:9 Comment: Under the ball, Mbele, from Iali, controls it well.\n29:11 Comment: And Dani Rouse is going to come to help, Eriksen has seen him.\n29:13 Comment: Ball for the left-handed back.\n29:15 Comment: The sending of Dani Rouse is horrible.\n29:19 Comment: The ball that is lost on the side.\n29:27 Comment: He took it from the sideline, the ball was lost on the side.\n29:31 Comment: And the ball that is lost from the side.\n29:33 Comment: The ball that is lost on the side.\n29:39 Comment: The White Hart Lane team took it from the sidelines.\n29:44 Comment: From Iali, distributed for Eriksen.\n29:47 Comment: Debussy can't stand him, the Dane was wrong.\n29:51 Comment: Vertonghen is perfectly anticipated.\n29:56 Comment: Encirclement for the other Belgian central defender, Alderweireld.\n30:0 Comment: Vertonghen, Dembele, the three Belgians.\n30:2 Comment: The ball has been taken out of the box.\n30:5 Comment: The ball continuously.\n30:8 Comment: Dembele's mistake, he gives the ball to Campbell.\n30:11 Comment: Ahead, uncheck.\n30:14 Comment: Giroud is not a good pass from the German, not at all good.\n30:18 Comment: This one from Tobi Alderweireld.\n30:25 Comment: Because Vlad Kirikes was sent to Florence.\n30:28 Comment: To Naples, to Naples.\n30:31 Comment: Look, he was a central defender that I loved when he arrived.\n30:34 Comment: A fast centre-back, not very physical, but very fast.\n30:37 Comment: Perfect for correcting, for going out to the crossroads.\n30:41 Comment: But it has not triumphed.\n30:44 Comment: And evidently it has not given the necessary level.\n30:49 Comment: From a great English league, to another great Italian league, to Naples.\n30:56 Comment: Orders from Mauricio Pochettino.\n30:59 Comment: The first third of the game has been covered.\n31:2 Comment: 31 minutes with this 0-0.\n31:5 Comment: Between Arsenal and Tottenham.\n31:8 Comment: The game that closes.\n31:11 Comment: Liverpool and Crystal Palace are also playing right now.\n31:14 Comment: It will continue because it also started at 5.\n31:17 Comment: They are the last two of the day, of this 12th round of the Premier.\n31:20 Comment: Let's go to Dembele.\n31:23 Comment: Ahead, Tobi Alderweireld.\n31:29 Comment: That's where Alderweireld came, to the divide.\n31:32 Comment: A couple of meters on Arsenal's ground.\n31:35 Comment: He's the one who hasn't handled the ball in a while.\n31:38 Comment: It's happening in Tottenham's last minutes.\n31:41 Comment: Without great depth, although now you will find it.\n31:43 Comment: And he finds it for Kane to score if he doesn't miss.\n31:45 Comment: And he hasn't failed. Mark Kane.\n31:48 Comment: Tottenham goal.\n31:51 Comment:  Citizen Kane.\n31:54 Comment: It made it 0-1. I had it done.\n31:56 Comment: I couldn't miss that goal.\n31:59 Comment: And Harry Kane didn't fail.\n32:2 Comment: The ball went deep. Tottenham was having the ball.\n32:5 Comment: No depth until this play came in which there are holes everywhere in Arsenal.\n32:9 Comment: Poorly placed. Arsenal is ridiculously poorly placed.\n32:12 Comment: And he defines how an English international center forward should define.\n32:15 Comment: As is Harry Kane. 0-1.\n32:18 Comment: Arsenal's terrible defensive situation.\n32:21 Comment: With the side very high but without marking.\n32:23 Comment: With the right center back also quite far from his goal.\n32:26 Comment: Without really marking anyone.\n32:29 Comment: And also the left center back, Koxienli, takes a late step.\n32:32 Comment: Because that's what he's trying to do, with such an advanced defense,\n32:35 Comment: Koxienli tries to take the small step to leave Harry Kane out of the game.\n32:38 Comment: But it's late.\n32:41 Comment: So Kane's reception is comfortable.\n32:44 Comment: He has all the time in the world to think about where to score.\n32:47 Comment: And the defensive error is big in Arsenal.\n32:50 Comment: Tremendous mistake.\n32:53 Comment: And Tottenham punishes him with a new goal from Harry Kane.\n32:56 Comment: The seventh of the season.\n32:59 Comment: Sixth in the League. Plus one in the Europa League.\n33:2 Comment: It would have been difficult to score in the League this season.\n33:5 Comment: But he's scoring in the last three games. He has done it.\n33:8 Comment: Let's see if we watch a replay to see how it is.\n33:11 Comment: Arsenal's defense is halfway somewhere.\n33:14 Comment: With the side very high but without marking.\n33:17 Comment: Right center too.\n33:20 Comment: Very advanced but very much in no man's land.\n33:23 Comment: With his back.\n33:26 Comment: And left center back a little late and then taking that little step late.\n33:29 Comment: Surely we will have the opportunity to see it again.\n33:32 Comment: Sure. We haven't been in a short plenary session of the Koxienli prayer anymore.\n33:35 Comment: One of those who can pay the price of realization.\n33:38 Comment: After Arsenal's mistake. Collective error.\n33:41 Comment: But also individualized.\n33:44 Comment: In some more than others. Eric Lamela, 0-1. Tottenham wins.\n33:47 Comment: Harry Kane scored. Throw-in.\n33:50 Comment: The Gunners.\n33:53 Comment: The ball breaks. Look how he asks Ericsson for explanations.\n33:56 Comment: Instead of showing off your technical quality, which we know you are very good,\n33:59 Comment: Why don't you give it to me and we continue playing?\n34:2 Comment: And that is something that Lamela has not finished learning.\n34:5 Comment: The decorations in football are very good,\n34:8 Comment: But above the decoration is the obligation to do what is best for the team.\n34:11 Comment: These are moments that I understand that Lamela cannot avoid.\n34:14 Comment: Because we had to play a good game.\n34:17 Comment: But it is not a match that can be avoided.\n34:20 Comment: It's a match that can be avoided.\n34:23 Comment: It's a game that went very badly\n34:26 Comment: because he is a very classy player\n34:29 Comment: And he's always played like that.\n34:32 Comment: But the anger that Ericsson has given him seems completely logical to me.\n34:35 Comment: What made Ericsson angry?\n34:38 Comment: He's not the hottest guy in the world, precisely.\n34:41 Comment: I'm saying that I thought it was him,\n34:44 Comment: But I'm not 100% sure it was him.\n34:47 Comment: Maybe I'm wrong.\n34:50 Comment: But there was a classmate who asked him for explanations\n34:53 Comment: By the way, he will continue to be the sole leader of matches by a goalkeeper without receiving\n34:58 Comment: A goal in the first. Be careful, that must be it, that must be it, I don't know, it's not going to be anything because\n35:2 Comment: Martin Atkinson has looked the other way. Maybe it wasn't for Roja, I don't know, I don't know\n35:6 Comment: If it's with his shoulder or if he hits him there. I think it's with his shoulder. He pushes him, pushes him,\n35:11 Comment: hit, aggression, a little mix of everything. From Giroud to Berton, which didn't seem to me\n35:15 Comment: It was. Atkinson decided to look the other way. The touch was impressive, but it came out perfectly\n35:24 Comment: Coquelin, Campbell, avoiding Eriksen. Monreal's opening, very good because he hit the play\n35:30 Comment: Quickly. The ball goes to Alexis, Cazorla splits, who is having very little influence\n35:35 Comment: In everything, by the way, and that is evidently noted very negatively by his team, Arsenal.\n35:40 Comment: He has barely appeared. Cazorla in the game in which he appears is Dele Alli and he is going to take\n35:44 Comment: the ball, that's going to be yellow, that's going to be yellow when the play ends\n35:47 Comment: Coquelin. Good law of the advantage, it can reach 0-2, Dele Alli did it completely wrong\n35:53 Comment: And he's going to lose to the yellow one, I think Atkinson, to Coquelin, don't tell me, because that was one\n35:59 Comment: Book yellow. He didn't even blow the foul. I gave him the advantage because he had the advantage\n36:5 Comment: Tottenham is there, but when the play ends, the ball goes out.\n36:9 Comment: We're going to wait for the ball to go out and see what happens, because obviously it stops.\n36:16 Comment: Showing yellow cannot stop the game. Let's see now. Now he will call his\n36:21 Comment: I send to Coquelin, to Giroud, first to Giroud. First to Giroud and Berton, what do I think?\n36:27 Comment: He was the other one who was in that mess. The thing about Coquelin is going to come from Rosita, I think\n36:34 Comment: Yes, for sure, Coquelin is going to be forgotten. In this France-Belgium rivalry duel\n36:43 Comment: There is everything there, there is everything there, grabs, pushes, that is a penalty, that grab is\n36:51 Comment: Penalty. And there, Giroud totally hit him. I wouldn't send him off either.\n36:58 Comment: Someone for that. For Roja I think not. It's not a blow with the hands or the elbow,\n37:2 Comment: Not a punch, far from it, not a slap, not anything. It's a blow with the chest that Evert\n37:7 Comment: Togen exaggerates a lot, but the incredible thing is that with everything that has been there, it hasn't happened\n37:12 Comment: Nothing was whistled, with four referees watching the game. Incredible.\n37:17 Comment: In the duel you were talking about the France-Belgium rivalry, right? There is a movie that I remember, in\n37:24 Comment: comedy key, there is border advertising of both, Belgium and France, one\n37:29 Comment: good movie, I don't remember the name, but pretty good. There is more rivalry from Belgium\n37:35 Comment: towards France than vice versa, also due to a question of size. But it is the country\n37:40 Comment: smaller than the one who feels wronged in some way. Rivalry exists. And it is\n37:46 Comment: There and I hope we have the chance to see it at the next Euro Cup, because I would like that\n37:50 Comment: France and Belgium end up facing each other in some way and at some point in the tournament.\n37:56 Comment: Dani Blanc is the protagonist, screenwriter and factotum of the great comedy Welcome to the North.\n38:2 Comment: Fantastic movie.\n38:7 Comment: Let's see that ball for Olivier Giroud.\n38:12 Comment: Tobias Alderweireld clears from the ground, watch out for Cazorla, Cazorla on the edge of the area,\n38:16 Comment: Good pass for Joel Campbell, first-team Campbell.\n38:19 Comment: And as a heel and resource I couldn't do anything else, Alexis.\n38:21 Comment: The game is broken, Arsenal is still dangerous because it keeps finding spaces,\n38:27 Comment: But then running back costs Arsenal a lot. It's the real drama of this\n38:31 Comment: team. There was an offside there, if there was an offside it would have been annulled, yes\n38:35 Comment: It would have been a goal. Real drama for Arsenal in the defensive phase, without a doubt. Here\n38:39 Comment:  we have it.\n38:41 Comment: There goes Harry Kane, the scorer of the only goal of the game, bottom line, Harry Kane.\n38:44 Comment: He cleared with Sielmi.\n38:47 Comment: For Mesut Ozil.\n38:55 Comment: The ball for the German of Turkish origin, missing Dani Rous.\n39:0 Comment: Rous gets very angry and maybe he's even right.\n39:4 Comment: Yes, you may not need it, it's true. Those types of actions are always removed.\n39:8 Comment: There the referees never make mistakes.\n39:12 Comment: They don't do after-hours.\n39:13 Comment: Thirty-nine already from the first. The one who could be the leader to do it is falling, he must\n39:18 Comment: Arsenal won the game. And they're not even tying it, they're losing it.\n39:23 Comment: Tottenham, which in fact would be very close to Arsenal itself in the table, would add 23\n39:27 Comment: Tottenham is 25 ahead of Arsenal and 26 behind the leader. They would even get close to the leader.\n39:32 Comment: Tottenham.\n39:35 Comment: Less Ozil is appearing, Cazorla is appearing less and Arsenal cannot do that\n39:40 Comment: because it's missing... This is the play that scored the goal. Look at what we were saying.\n39:44 Comment: The little step forward...\n39:45 Comment: I go up, down, down, up.\n39:47 Comment: The little step forward, Kocsielny to begin with is not marking, he is not playing, he is not there\n39:53 Comment: referencing or touching the opponent's body. He has it loose. He is very advanced, there is\n39:59 Comment: A lot of space behind him and also the little step he takes forward is taken late.\n40:5 Comment: Conclusion of the first game.\n40:7 Comment: Conclusion of all this, that Harry Kane has made it 0-1. And what we were saying, how\n40:12 Comment: It is noticeable in Arsenal when less Ozil and especially Cazorla appear, who are the ones\n40:17 Comment: They give meaning to the game. Without them, Arsenal is much more of a transition team.\n40:24 Comment: With Alexis, with Joel Campbell, it is much more a team that sees the spaces and attacks them\n40:31 Comment: And he feels comfortable running. But he needs to put that... Give him a little pause\n40:38 Comment: to the game and give common sense to what the team does. Both Cazorla have to appear\n40:44 Comment: like Ozil so that Arsenal improves.\n40:49 Comment: That fight ends. Well, the ball ends for Eriksen. He tries to protect him\n40:53 Comment: back to Deli Alli.\n40:55 Comment: Eric Daya arrives helping. Eric Daya helps everyone. He makes a great display. Match without\n40:59 Comment: The game too. The last pass is not good from Eriksen.\n41:5 Comment: Missing Alexis Sánchez.\n41:10 Comment: Look at the challenger there from the Chilean.\n41:12 Comment: It is one of those games where one of Arsenal's most marked defects, which is, as already\n41:17 Comment: I said, the interaction with the team. It is an interaction that cannot be done.\n41:24 Comment: Inability to press very high and defend away from his area. It costs him a lot in the game\n41:29 Comment: because Tottenham makes him run backwards practically every time he has the ball.\n41:33 Comment: That is making Arsenal have too much travel. Back and forth.\n41:39 Comment: In that sense, neither team has an advantage. In the sense that both have\n41:44 Comment: played in Europe. Because let's remember that Tottenham has also played against Anderlecht.\n41:48 Comment: A very complicated game on Thursday.\n41:54 Comment: Analysts in England are praising a lot. Tottenham's good physical tone, which\n42:1 Comment: The team runs, the physical display they do every game. And that's what he was referring to, Pochettino,\n42:5 Comment: And to the match against Anderlecht. He said that the credit goes to the recoverers, to the team\n42:10 Comment: medical and scientific team. Pochettino literally said that the team is so well physically\n42:16 Comment:  how are you doing.\n42:19 Comment: Eriksen playing. Back for Eric Daya.\n42:22 Comment: That is essential. With today's calendars, they are almost as important\n42:27 Comment: The recoverers, the doctors, the physical trainers, than the coach, if not more.\n42:35 Comment: Behind Bertonghen, Hugo Lloris.\n42:41 Comment: They take a strong shot at Arsenal.\n42:43 Comment: Not a strong shot.\n42:45 Comment: Lloris hasn't had to train as far as I remember.\n42:48 Comment: He has had some arrivals and some shots away from Arsenal.\n42:50 Comment: He had a few minutes when he put Lloris' goal close.\n42:54 Comment: But it's true that he needs to finish.\n42:57 Comment: It is also true that Che did not intervene either, because the only shot between the three\n43:0 Comment: This man's sticks, from Kane, from Tottenham, it was a goal.\n43:7 Comment: Few arrivals, with the possibility of scoring, with real danger.\n43:13 Comment: Very little work for the goalkeepers. But Tottenham winning 0-1.\n43:16 Comment: The pressure also suffocates Arsenal a lot.\n43:21 Comment: He knocked Olivier Giroud headlong, without a clear meaning, because Alexis was very far away.\n43:26 Comment: To Andre Lloris.\n43:28 Comment: The ball falls.\n43:29 Comment: Good minutes from Tottenham.\n43:34 Comment: Back off, Harry Kane. He's losing control a little bit, or quite a bit.\n43:37 Comment: Eric Daya is going to put pressure on Mertes, Saka and Che just in case.\n43:40 Comment:  And step.\n43:43 Comment: Giroud plays.\n43:46 Comment: Great control by Santi Cazorla.\n43:50 Comment:  Last minute.\n43:53 Comment:  From the first.\n43:55 Comment: Ozil.\n43:58 Comment: Ozil drives very far from his zone, from his area of ​​influence.\n44:1 Comment: Ozil's mistake. Tottenham will recover the ball.\n44:4 Comment: From Liali to Eriksen. The Dane drives.\n44:6 Comment: Eriksen is a little shaky.\n44:8 Comment: Finally open the right for Harry Kane.\n44:10 Comment: It's in the heart of the area, at the mela, the shot.\n44:12 Comment: From Harry Kane. Che cleared.\n44:16 Comment: They lack favor with the ball for Tottenham.\n44:19 Comment: Enrique Linier.\n44:23 Comment: Ozil's serious mistake.\n44:24 Comment: The friend has not paid attention.\n44:26 Comment: A loss of the ball in an area does terrible damage to the team.\n44:42 Comment: There is Arsenal's double pivot.\n44:47 Comment: I leave behind Campbell, Tokelan, Eussi.\n44:53 Comment: I guess they marked them for us because Arsenal can't find them.\n44:57 Comment: He's having a hard time getting the ball strong now.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: The second part begins.\n0:2 Comment: Yes, sorry, this is it now, and we will see if Cazorla is not going to add to the list of casualties of this Arsenal,\n0:6 Comment: which is already starting to be worrying, although nothing new under the sun, it must also be said.\n0:13 Comment: Season after season.\n0:15 Comment: Well, with that change, I remember, Arsenal's eleven, Cheque, Debussy, Mertes, Akakoshi, Nimonreal,\n0:19 Comment: Kokela, Flamini, Campbell, Ozil, Sánchez, Giroud.\n0:23 Comment: Tottenham continues with the eleven from the first half, that is, Joris, Walker, Albelvaire,\n0:28 Comment: Bertong, Rouse, Dier, Ali, Lamela, Dembele, Eriksen, Kane.\n0:32 Comment: There is Arteta, and obviously Arteta is out of rhythm, because he has been out for quite some time,\n0:42 Comment: But probably the best option, in theory, I tell you,\n0:46 Comment: Both being on the bench means that both are ready to play.\n0:50 Comment: The logical thing would have been to put Arteta in, who gives you better treatment of the ball in that area,\n0:56 Comment: More than Flamini, but hey, that's Wenger's decision.\n0:59 Comment: Liniers' decision is to give a goal kick, he asked Debussy for a corner kick.\n1:6 Comment: But Tottenham will play through someone who is quite calm in the game, Hugo Joris.\n1:16 Comment: Because Arsenal hasn't given him much work so far.\n1:19 Comment: That ball for Dani Rouse.\n1:27 Comment: Try to protect with your back, Joel Campbell does it well, he prevented the ball from being lost.\n1:33 Comment: He avoided losing it.\n1:35 Comment: The ball that Monreal plays, Alexis.\n1:39 Comment: Near the edge of the area, Campbell let pass, the Costa Rican made a mistake.\n1:43 Comment: Kane holds his back, he wants to turn, Kane protects the ball exceptionally well.\n1:48 Comment: And now it's going to cause a yellow card for Debussy, I imagine.\n1:52 Comment: I think he failed in this type of action on some occasions in the first part.\n1:57 Comment: In that attempt to protect the ball to give the team a way out.\n2:0 Comment: But now he has done very well, he has managed to turn around and if not it will be because of the foul,\n2:4 Comment: I still would have created a scoring chance.\n2:11 Comment: Hold your back, Eric Lamela.\n2:15 Comment: Doubles for Kane, Kane's return to Lamela, sees Eriksen offside.\n2:21 Comment: And Muller, the lineman who follows Tottenham's attack, saw it.\n2:26 Comment: Michael Muller and Stephen Child, the one who follows Arsenal's attack, the other lineman.\n2:32 Comment: Two of the most recognized linemen, with the most prestige in the Premier League.\n2:38 Comment: There coming up Joel Campbell.\n2:40 Comment: Shoot Campbell.\n2:42 Comment: Now he has had to work really hard, a firm hand on Hugo Lloris's pitch\n2:47 Comment: after Joel Campbell's very hard shot.\n2:50 Comment: Very good, lots of space.\n2:52 Comment: Danny Rose very sold, in head to head with him.\n2:56 Comment: Now it was Tottenham who were not exactly well positioned in defense.\n3:3 Comment: He puts pressure on Arsenal, or he wants to do it through Mesut Özil.\n3:11 Comment: Bend the ball, low.\n3:13

against Dele Alli.\n4:11 Comment: Very good Dele Alli, huh.\n4:12 Comment: Understanding where to lend a hand and stopping Joel Campbell when Danny Rose wasn't even there.\n4:19 Comment: They cover a lot of space, Erik Dahl and Dele Alli cover a lot of ground.\n4:25 Comment: I think, look, I might take a chance on it a little bit, but I think Tottenham has a pair of center midfielders for quite some time as long as they last.\n4:33 Comment: Because, unfortunately for Tottenham, they are a selling team, as has become clear in recent years, although they have sold very well, that is true.\n4:42 Comment: Especially Real Madrid.\n4:44 Comment: The ball went to Alli, precisely Alli. There, inside the area, he finally held it.\n4:48 Comment: Okay, Mertesacker.\n4:50 Comment: Here we go, repeat foul 101% of the time.\n5:2 Comment: With spectacular energy Dele Alli, 19 years old, Erik Dahl already 21.\n5:7 Comment: Body about 90 meters tall, long legs.\n5:11 Comment: They are not slow for the centimeters they have.\n5:14 Comment: And technically they are fine, good ball.\n5:16 Comment: Alexis, but you read it right on defense, Kyle Walker.\n5:20 Comment: He does the derbaire, he does it well too for Dele Alli.\n5:27 Comment: He knows how to save, eh, Gabi, too. Erik Dahl's back to Dele Alli is very good, he is the one who drops the most, the one who reaches the rival's front the most.\n5:35 Comment: What kind of, huh, Dele Alli.\n5:38 Comment: He's already in the national team and now let's see who takes him out.\n5:42 Comment: England also needs a player like that.\n5:46 Comment: A player who, in addition to giving you physical strength, is very fit.\n5:51 Comment: Yes, because Eriksen is in danger of crossing the center. No, Eriksen's shot is out.\n5:55 Comment: I don't know if he can play, Chieck asks for it.\n5:57 Comment: Eriksen asks for it and it's a corner, it seems.\n6:0 Comment: Let's see how the Danish Christian Eriksen leaked there.\n6:2 Comment: Very well on his back, Harry Kane, dragging Koxielnyi, opening that gap.\n6:8 Comment: That's why the ball had that trajectory, but what an excellent job by Harry Kane with his back to the goal.

They are winning 0-1 and are pushing, looking for 0-2.\n6:46 Comment:  Corner kick.\n6:48 Comment: Arsenal has many problems, many.\n6:51 Comment: It's floating around Roy Hodgson's hands watching Deliali.\n6:56 Comment: He has already made his debut, for those who have not followed the last games.\n7:0 Comment: Deliali has already played two senior matches, at 19 years old.\n7:3 Comment: The previous break.\n7:5 Comment: And now they will begin to know him in Spain, because we are going to face him.\n7:9 Comment: A cut Dani Rose, who is also international with Hodgson. Sending Hodgson.\n7:14 Comment: Dani Rose, Hodgson hasn't sent balls like that in a while.\n7:18 Comment: There are usually many Tottenham games, logically not just this one, because they face Arsenal. It's a great duel.\n7:24 Comment: We always say it in the experts' games.\n7:26 Comment: There tend to be a lot of Hodgson games, because he has a lot of English players.\n7:29 Comment: Many players who have already been called up by him or who are in Hodgson's orbit and may be called up shortly.\n7:36 Comment: Remembering the list, then...\n7:39 Comment: Wolke, Rose, Kokelan, Deliali, the one from Tottenham.\n7:43 Comment: Royal Mason.\n7:45 Comment: What Hodgson for me will never get over is that he was the coach who let Roberto Carlos go.\n7:50 Comment:  We are totally agreed.\n7:52 Comment: For me it is one of the worst decisions of a technician in a long time, also for the price it cost.\n7:59 Comment: 600 million pesetas.\n8:1 Comment: In fact, on the last trip to Madrid I think a representative asked to make a statue.\n8:5 Comment:  Yeah.\n8:6 Comment: At one of the doors of the good life of Roberto Carlos.\n8:8 Comment: That's right, Roberto Carlos was at Inter.\n8:10 Comment: You could see that there was a side for 10 years of the best in the world.\n8:14 Comment: And Inter sold it for 600 million.\n8:17 Comment: Come on, it's a hard thing to explain.\n8:20 Comment: One of those that only Inter does.\n8:22 Comment: No, the ones who look at it the most too.\n8:24 Comment: Let's see if he stopped.\n8:26 Comment: The kind only Hodgson did.\n8:28 Comment:  Cinema!\n8:30 Comment:  The ball!\n8:35 Comment:  Cinema!\n8:37 Comment: To the crossbar Giroud!\n8:40 Comment: To the wood!\n8:42 Comment: With Lloris beaten, with his compatriot beaten, that ball unfortunately found Arsenal.\n8:48 Comment: I don't know if he's offside or not.\n8:50 Comment: If there is offside, it is millimetric, but there could be, be careful, because there could be.\n8:54 Comment: Now, the ball that Osir puts in is crazy.\n8:57 Comment: The point at which he puts it and the quality with which he makes it fall almost from top to bottom.\n9:3 Comment:  It's fantastic.\n9:6 Comment: Lloris was saved from the goal by his teammate, Olivier Giroud.\n9:16 Comment: Deliali looking for Eric Dier.\n9:20 Comment: Arsenal could have tied.\n9:22 Comment: Of the little dangerous thing that Arsenal did throughout the game.\n9:24 Comment: Huochek.\n9:28 Comment: In the middle of the second half at the Emirates.\n9:31 Comment: Alexis Monreal.\n9:33 Comment: Looking for Kocielny.\n9:36 Comment: He turned to receive Flameni, Coquelain.\n9:41 Comment: He goes to the entrance of the mela.\n9:43 Comment: One of those things where the mela loses his mind, leaves the game and suddenly makes an absolutely untimely entrance.\n9:51 Comment: We're going to see it here. It's outrageous.\n9:53 Comment: Look at the way he enters, how he takes Coquelain by.\n9:58 Comment: Yellow and the mela comes out well.\n10:4 Comment: The order will come to him, I imagine, from the band to his compatriot Pochettino.\n10:8 Comment: Because the game is on track right now. Tottenham winning 0-1.\n10:11 Comment: Although some signs of Arsenal's improvement are beginning to appear.\n10:15 Comment: Maybe because of that shot against the crossbar by Olivier Giroud.\n10:20 Comment: It would be a shame for Arsenal.\n10:23 Comment: Let him mess up the mela for the second time and be expelled. He will stay with 10.\n10:27 Comment: So I think Pochettino is already thinking about Ryan Mason.\n10:30 Comment: To reinforce the midfield and control the ball more and avoid any more mistakes.\n10:37 Comment: Mason who already played the other day against Anderlecht.\n10:40 Comment: Also an interesting player.\n10:43 Comment: Another of Tottenham's young players, of Tottenham's young English players.\n10:51 Comment: Another young man is also on the bench, of course, I had forgotten.\n10:54 Comment: Because the South Korean Heung-Min Son had been injured.\n10:57 Comment: Yes, he could reappear and he's going to have a hard time.\n11:0 Comment: Oops, Check there, Check falls asleep.\n11:2 Comment: In the end nothing happens for Arsenal, but the Czech fell asleep.\n11:5 Comment: No one warned him about his companions either.\n11:7 Comment: Cazorla's orphaned team.\n11:10 Comment: Arsenal also very fast.\n11:12 Comment: Cazorla was not good in the first half, he already noticed it. And now he is not there.\n11:16 Comment: And Ozil has also resigned during this time.\n11:19 Comment: And it's very difficult for Arsenal to make sense of the game.\n11:23 Comment: He doesn't have any of the football generators in the center of the field.\n11:27 Comment: Because Ozil plays further forward, and well, he intervenes, appears, disappears.\n11:30 Comment: You know how intermittent it is, but I no longer had Ramsey or Wilson.\n11:33 Comment: Injured a long time ago.\n11:35 Comment: Now without Cazorla for the second part.\n11:37 Comment: That's where Dele Alli made a mistake. One of the few balls he lost.\n11:41 Comment: And he is actually playing ahead of...\n11:44 Comment: It is now 4-1, 4-1 Tottenham with Dier as center half.\n11:48 Comment: And Dele Alli in theory in an interior position.\n11:50 Comment: Although at times he also hangs out with Dier a lot, of course.\n11:54 Comment: There was no longer an aerial turn, but there was no one to extend it.\n11:59 Comment: Try to control, Eriksen does. Erik Daya comes to help.\n12:3 Comment: Foul, lack of Daya.\n12:6 Comment: Erik Daya, right arm.\n12:8 Comment: Unbalancing Alexis Sánchez.\n12:10 Comment: So set piece for the Gunners.\n12:19 Comment: That is Erik Daya's fault.\n12:25 Comment: Tottenham defends it with concentration.\n12:28 Comment: Too far away, huh? That line.\n12:31 Comment: Strong shot, strong shot.\n12:33 Comment: The French central defender won from above as he often does.\n12:37 Comment: You see this more and more in today's football.\n12:40 Comment: Teams that make this type of lateral or diagonal fouls\n12:44 Comment: They bring out the defensive line a lot.\n12:47 Comment: I want you to move it.\n12:50 Comment: How fast it is, although there has been a robbery there.\n12:54 Comment: But there has not been an aerial turnaround.\n12:57 Comment: It's just that there hasn't been an aerial turn.\n13:0 Comment: How fast it is, although there he has achieved an extraordinary robbery.\n13:5 Comment: Lamela was so accelerated that it was not checked.\n13:8 Comment: Mertesake was also asleep.\n13:11 Comment: He was very passive in that action.\n13:14 Comment: Let's see, offside.\n13:16 Comment: The mela.\n13:25 Comment: He had to have a very good friendship\n13:27 Comment: and companionship with Roberto Soldado.\n13:30 Comment: When Soldier left, a few weeks ago,\n13:33 Comment: He signed for Villarreal, Eric Lamela said goodbye to him with great affection.\n13:37 Comment: From the Tottenham locker room.\n13:40 Comment: He had glowing words for the Valencian striker.\n13:45 Comment: Now it seemed like something else.\n13:48 Comment: Sometimes it's not easy.\n13:50 Comment: I thought I saw Dembélé at the same level as Daya\n13:54 Comment: and Ali ahead.\n13:55 Comment: In the first half of the game it seemed like that to me too.\n13:58 Comment: It's possible that that happened in the first part.\n14:1 Comment: At some stage.\n14:3 Comment: It's perfectly possible.\n14:5 Comment: But indeed on this occasion it has been clear.\n14:8 Comment: There goes the corner kick.\n14:10 Comment: Arsenal with the central defenders who rise.\n14:12 Comment: Let's go to Mertesake.\n14:14 Comment: Kossieni will be there, of course.\n14:18 Comment: Ozil enters.\n14:20 Comment: Fists of Lloris.\n14:22 Comment: Back mirror nearby.\n14:23 Comment: The real Gamón.\n14:25 Comment: The advantage goes to Dani Roos.\n14:27 Comment: He doesn't want to go.\n14:29 Comment: Who has gone into the world all the time to have done something else.\n14:31 Comment: What happens is that I understand sometimes that the players who have the most difficulty knowing what they have around them\n14:35 Comment: And Roos is obviously one of them, prefer to be cautious.\n14:39 Comment: Ozil crosses again.\n14:41 Comment: Giroud's goal was sung.\n14:44 Comment: But the Frenchman finished off.\n14:47 Comment: What a golden opportunity.\n14:49 Comment: Olivier Giroud has wasted.\n14:51 Comment: Ozil's left foot is putting some incredible balls in.\n14:54 Comment: And this is to put on Giroud's due.\n14:57 Comment: You can't miss an occasion like that from that distance.\n15:0 Comment: Look where Giroud is.\n15:3 Comment: What two balls Ozil has put in Giroud's head.\n15:7 Comment:  Spectacular.\n15:9 Comment: The Frenchman was desperate there.\n15:11 Comment: And behind him another Frenchman Kossieni also entered to try to finish.\n15:15 Comment: Tottenham has been saved.\n15:17 Comment: On two occasions already.\n15:18 Comment: Giroud's shot off the crossbar and now Giroud's shot off the crossbar.\n15:27 Comment: Tottenham is winning but it is saving itself.\n15:30 Comment: And he is seeing how Arsenal is growing in the game.\n15:33 Comment: And creating scoring chances.\n15:35 Comment: I think Pochettino has to do something now to try to stop, cool down Arsenal.\n15:41 Comment: There is still a lot of encounter left.\n15:43 Comment: Midy now ahead.\n15:45 Comment:  Mesut Ozil.\n15:46 Comment: Receive Anterik Daya.\n15:48 Comment: Release the ball for Mathieu Flamini.\n15:50 Comment:

collided with Daya.\n16:4 Comment: Throw-in for Arsenal.\n16:12 Comment: Olivier Giroud.\n16:13 Comment: Decorated far from his zone of influence, the French striker.\n16:18 Comment: Giroud comes in.\n16:20 Comment: In a change of play, Alexis can't hook the ball.\n16:23 Comment: Throw-in for the White Hart Lane team.\n16:34 Comment: As Gabi Ruiz remembered, he has only won one game in the last 25 on the field.\n16:41 Comment:  From 1993.\n16:43 Comment: That game was in 2010, by the way.\n16:45 Comment: So we're half an hour away from something historic happening, you might say.\n16:48 Comment:  Many years.\n16:50 Comment: It's almost since the Premier began to be called, to have the format it has and to be called the Premier League as such.\n16:57 Comment: It was in '92.\n16:59 Comment: Well, since that date, since May 93, he has only won one game in the last 25 on the court.\n17:5 Comment: They were losing 2-0 and in the end they won 2-3.\n17:8 Comment: But since '93 only that victory in 25 games.\n17:13 Comment: Tottenham away from home at Highbury, most of them in recent years at the Emirates.\n17:18 Comment: Arsenal is on the pitch, in short.\n17:24 Comment: Respect the Dervairo.\n17:27 Comment: And the first time goal.\n17:29 Comment: Respect the Dervairo.\n17:35 Comment: Mertesaka takes the ball against Deli Alli.\n17:39 Comment: Ball back, check.\n17:44 Comment: It doesn't cost him now.\n17:46 Comment: Arsenal, Tottenham pressure.\n17:48 Comment: And it's hard for him, so hard that he lost the ball on the edge of the area.\n17:51 Comment: Ball to Harry Kane, from there trying to set up the pass.\n17:54 Comment: It takes a little while, Kane himself recovers, Kane's opening.\n17:56 Comment: The arrival of the player.\n17:58 Comment: The arrival of Kyle Walker.\n18:0 Comment: Against Alexis, he beats the ball well behind for Eriksen.\n18:3 Comment: Clear, check.\n18:5 Comment: And the punchline was out.\n18:7 Comment: The shot at Deli Alli went very badly now.\n18:9 Comment: Well, it's not easy not to get behind against Arsenal.\n18:13 Comment: Against an Arsenal that is losing and that attacks when it does, it does so with a lot of people.\n18:17 Comment: What Tottenham is doing is not easy, they keep their lines at a very good distance.\n18:22 Comment: Look at where he is pressing despite the minute we are in and the fact that he is winning.\n18:26 Comment: The team is doing everything possible not to give up, not to get behind and they are doing it really well.\n18:33 Comment: Another very good recovery at a good altitude.\n18:35 Comment: And Tottenham, who recovers the ball at that height of the field, assumes little risk and caution.\n18:41 Comment: To Kane, out crossed.\n18:43 Comment: I think it took him a little while to give the pass to Eriksen, but Kane had unmarked himself perfectly,\n18:47 Comment: which by the way is completing a game, but quite, quite good.\n18:50 Comment: What a chance, what a good move by the Arsenal defense again.\n18:52 Comment: Very bad stop, staggered.\n18:55 Comment: Harry Kane gets in the middle there, very well.\n18:58 Comment: And it is perfectly enabled.\n19:0 Comment: I'm liking Tottenham, who are obviously suffering at times and Arsenal have had chances.\n19:7 Comment: And he hit the ball against the post.\n19:10 Comment: But I like where Tottenham are trying to maintain that line to never get behind, because they know that would probably be the end.\n19:17 Comment: Be careful, although it is very undecorated, there is going to be a possibility.\n19:20 Comment: No, there is no chance of a shot, he worked well in defense of Bouchy.\n19:24 Comment: The mela has no speed, we said it in the first part.\n19:27 Comment: The mela suffers a lot with that type of balls into space when it has them.\n19:36 Comment: They run for the Spurs.\n19:42 Comment: One minute 20 into the second half, Christian Eriksen is going to throw it away.\n19:47 Comment: Short, the muse trembles.\n19:51 Comment: In the end Harry Kane throws the ball after Eric Dier's header.\n19:56 Comment: Offside, yes, Kane was down and that's how Muller-Key saw it.\n20:0 Comment: Mauricio Pochettino encourages his players.\n20:3 Comment: Getting closer little by little, although there is still a long way to go, but getting closer to the end of the game with this very important victory for Tottenham.\n20:12 Comment: Mason for Dembele is a change that I wouldn't be surprised at at all.\n20:15 Comment: Dembele is playing in that deeper position and I see him quite fatigued.\n20:20 Comment: To the Belgian player.\n20:22 Comment: I see him fatigued, it's a game with terrible physical demands.\n20:27 Comment: Mason also has that touch to give security to the exchange of passes.\n20:35 Comment: Extreme close-up of Arsène Wenger.\n20:39 Comment: That frown and that look, that gesture of deep concern, logically.\n20:44 Comment: Since he's not at Arsenal he already knows what's going to be said in England.\n20:48 Comment: Who fails again when he has the opportunity for unusual leadership.\n20:54 Comment: In the end it's been, for now, a day...\n20:57 Comment: Look, he played badly and you and I saw it, you and I suffered it, David.\n21:0 Comment: Manchester United are having a fantastic day so far.\n21:3 Comment: Indeed, and their match was horrible.\n21:6 Comment: But he won.\n21:8 Comment: Only Manchester City has tied in the bottom court.\n21:11 Comment: Aston Villa is asking Arsenal at home.\n21:13 Comment: I don't know if they still consider Chelsea as a rival in the fight for the title or not.\n21:15 Comment: But he also lost, for good measure, at Stoke yesterday.\n21:21 Comment: Ball to Dele Alli.\n21:25 Comment: Dele Alli...\n21:27 Comment: That's why you see...\n21:29 Comment: Corner, indicates the referee.\n21:31 Comment: And Matiu Debussy too.\n21:34 Comment: Matiu Debussy, Newcastle's woes.\n21:45 Comment: Corner that Eriksen is going to vote for.\n21:49 Comment: It's a few days before he starts playing that playoff with his country Denmark against Sweden.\n21:55 Comment:  Few days.\n21:57 Comment: Ball for Musa Dembele. Dele Alli.\n21:59 Comment: That's where the long control went.\n22:1 Comment: Dele Alli against Arsenal attack.\n22:3 Comment: We will see that Alexis Sánchez runs now, which the Chilean likes.\n22:6 Comment: The ball is advanced a lot. Alexis Sánchez's ball is advanced a lot.\n22:9 Comment: And he was very attentive and the goal fell quickly.\n22:16 Comment: For Dembele, they said something. I don't know if it was Pochettino.\n22:20 Comment: Muse, Muse.\n22:23 Comment: I heard it.\n22:25 Comment: From the front, at 4-1, 4-1 with Dier.\n22:27 Comment: We've seen it there.\n22:29 Comment: Now I don't know if he will return to Dier's level.\n22:32 Comment: To form more of a double pivot.\n22:34 Comment: But clearly they have asked him to advance his position to Dembele.\n22:40 Comment: Flamini.\n22:41 Comment: Alexis Sánchez doesn't exactly have good control.\n22:45 Comment:  Look to the sky.\n22:47 Comment: 22 and a half.\n22:49 Comment: Player of the second half at the Emirates.\n22:53 Comment: Manchester City would remain the leader.\n22:56 Comment: Even having punctured in the goalscorer's court, it was only a 0-0 draw,\n23:0 Comment: It would take one more point from Arsenal.\n23:2 Comment: If this ends like this.\n23:4 Comment: It remains to be seen.\n23:6 Comment: The mela put the Argentine's body well there.\n23:8 Comment: Dele Alli accompanies him, dropping off permanently.\n23:11 Comment: Dele Alli didn't give him the pass.\n23:13 Comment: The mela, doubt the mela.\n23:15 Comment: In the end they change Eriksen, Arsenal reposition themselves in defense.\n23:17 Comment: The action is still dangerous.\n23:19 Comment: Eriksen finishes with his left foot, Coquell recovers.\n23:21 Comment: And the Frenchman comes out with the ball.\n23:24 Comment: There was a moment in the play where I had a clear pass to Dele Alli.\n23:27 Comment: Yes, the mela didn't see it.\n23:30 Comment: Eriksen's opening.\n23:32 Comment: Kyle Walker.\n23:34 Comment: It combines with Harry Kane, who intervenes constantly,\n23:37 Comment: that is in the house there, that oxygenates, that distributes.\n23:40 Comment: Very good game by Kane.\n23:42 Comment: Focus on Rose.\n23:44 Comment: There was Kane.\n23:46 Comment: But how Arsenal are suffering.\n23:48 Comment: You were talking about Tottenham's physical preparation and physical moment.\n23:51 Comment: You can apply the opposite to Arsenal.\n23:54 Comment: He is living a nightmare with Tottenham in his field.\n23:58 Comment: It doesn't change the dynamics of Arsenal's game.\n24:1 Comment: The team that played in Europe a day before lacks breath.\n24:5 Comment: You have to remember him.\n24:7 Comment: On Thursday, logically, in Europe, and on Thursday at Tottenham.\n24:10 Comment:  Exactly.\n24:15 Comment: The ball for White Hartley's team.\n24:19 Comment: The shot that Che saved, which could have made it 0-2 with that header.\n24:24 Comment: Toby Alderweireld.\n24:26 Comment: Who crosses warmly on the edge of the area, Koscielny clears.\n24:31 Comment: About to mark Alderweireld.\n24:33 Comment: Against Joel Campbell.\n24:37 Comment: Everything attentive and fast, which is its great virtue.\n24:40 Comment: Kyle Walker.\n24:48 Comment: Harry Kane.\n24:50 Comment: What a game, there again, intervening, again,\n24:52 Comment: giving oxygen, air to your team.\n24:54 Comment: Kane.\n24:56 Comment: What a good ball from Kane.\n24:58 Comment: Last season, when they fell back a few meters in phases of the games,\n25:1 Comment: Kane's excellent passing ability just shines through.\n25:5 Comment: He has a great shot and a great passing line.\n25:8 Comment: Kane is a very complete forward.\n25:10 Comment: I have a small friendly match there, in quotes, with Felipe Martín.\n25:15 Comment: In the sense that I defend that Kane seems to me to be a very high-level footballer.\n25:19 Comment: Felipe not so much, but he also likes it.\n25:22 Comment: We say that Felipe considered him a bad player, far from it.\n25:25 Comment: But to me he does seem like a player with a lot of resources.\n25:29 Comment:  A lot of.\n25:31 Comment: A good striker.\n25:33 Comment: He has much more than just finishing ability and opportunism, I think.\n25:37 Comment: It has much more.\n25:39 Comment: Yes, yes. Last season he showed it.\n25:41 Comment: This campaign, we said, was a little below, but in the last few years,\n25:45 Comment: Now with this one, in the last three games, he is coming back, he is improving, he is clearly taking flight.\n25:51 Comment: Today he gave the team many solutions from his back, coming to support marks,\n25:56 Comment: always playing smart.\n25:59 Comment: Receive the mela.\n26:1 Comment: The mela of the player Dani Rose.\n26:3 Comment: Another phase in which Tottenham dominates.\n26:5 Comment: But clearly, the ball belongs to Tottenham.\n26:7 Comment: Arsenal have no strength right now.\n26:9 Comment: They will probably have a final meeting, because they are a team with a lot of pride, but not right now.\n26:14 Comment: Kane out.\n26:16 Comment: Harry Kane.\n26:18 Comment: He can't stand the right hand.\n26:21 Comment: The game is on, right now, to make a classic comment.\n26:24 Comment: And Tottenham are forgiving too much.\n26:27 Comment: He is having clear chances, he is having the ball, he is dominating, playing in Arsenal's field.\n26:33 Comment: Arsenal with a lack of response in every sense, physically, and also missing Cazorla a lot, of course.\n26:40 Comment: But they are truly minutes in which Tottenham could have closed the game, and they did not.\n26:45 Comment: We don't talk much, I don't talk in this case, about possible changes, which I always like, becoming a coach,\n26:51 Comment: Because he doesn't have much on the bench, the truth is I'm talking about attacks.\n26:53 Comment: They are defenders, Gabriel Paulista, Gibbs, Abbas Toude Arteta, of course Spina, the substitute goalkeeper.\n26:59 Comment: There is also Schembers, winger or centre-back, and the very young Iwobi, who is the only striker, the one who talks about the youth team.\n27:4 Comment: 18 years old, they wanted it.\n27:6 Comment: The team's terrible casualties.\n27:12 Comment: We couldn't do it without Wilshere, without Ramsey, without Alex, Socle and Chamberlain, without Walcott.\n27:18 Comment: Surely now with Cazorla injured, it is a bleak panorama.\n27:26 Comment: Replaced, we remember, after the break Santi Cazorla by Matías Flamenit.\n27:30 Comment: We imagine from here, as Gabi Ruiz says, that due to some type of physical problem, due to some injury, some discomfort.\n27:39 Comment: Exactly outside the takeoff of Hugo Lloris and speaking of injuries, to Seguchi's worst.\n27:43 Comment: Well, get ready, Gibbs.\n27:46 Comment: His natural replacement would be Keilum Schembers, who is on the bench, I don't know if he had already planned this change.\n27:52 Comment: Campbell is leaving.\n27:54 Comment: Clearly yes, well Campbell is leaving, he hasn't been good, to be honest.\n27:57 Comment: So, Alexis on the right now, I imagine, and Gibbs ahead of Montreal.\n28:1 Comment: Campbell had moved to the left side, we saw it in the last diagram that English television showed us.\n28:9 Comment: And let's see if Gibbs is going to put himself in that same position now.\n28:14 Comment: Let's go see him right away.\n28:16 Comment: He's ahead of Montreal already, I think, Gibbs.\n28:19 Comment: But it is what it is. Look, Arsenal has a long squad, but with so many injuries, the team is suffering a lot right now.\n28:28 Comment:  It's November.\n28:31 Comment: Well, and yesterday at the press conference I was talking about that list of injuries to finish.\n28:35 Comment: And Arsene Wenger literally said that he was terrified, because with all those injuries, and he is already beginning to see in the distance the anti-stop, the acceleration of the Premier at Christmas.\n28:47 Comment: The number of games that are played in the Christmas phase, and with all these injuries Wenger is already terrified.\n28:52 Comment: Well, this is a great footballer.\n28:55 Comment: He showed it in the first games he played in the Tottenham shirt.\n28:58 Comment: Then it is true that injuries have not allowed him to have continuity, but he is a player who, with the spaces that Arsenal will presumably leave in the last minutes, is a player who can kill you with spaces.\n29:10 Comment: Very fast, very powerful.\n29:12 Comment: A change that we announced before, because with Lamela's yellow, and well, he was playing, he did a great job. I think, Eric Lamela, very hardworking.\n29:19 Comment: Very hardworking, yes.\n29:20 Comment: A logical and natural change. A tired player is leaving, who has worked a lot, who has also given the team things in attack.\n29:28 Comment: Sometimes with that somewhat erratic decision-making that he has, out of wanting to show his quality, and a player comes in who is almost the opposite.\n29:38 Comment: A player who is pure determination, speed, verticality, and who in space, I insist, can do a lot of damage to Arsenal.\n29:45 Comment: And what I remind you of Bayer Leverkusen, Gaby, in the games I played against him, which were many, is that if he scores, he doesn't score a goal.\n29:52 Comment: He scores a great goal, he only knows how to score great goals.\n29:54 Comment: He is a player, for me, of a very high level.\n29:57 Comment: Kevin Minson, let's see if he proves it in these minutes or not.\n30:2 Comment: What is clear is that Arsenal, losing at home, add a left back because they don't have any more.\n30:8 Comment: And there goes Arteta, which is the logical thing to at least try to regain the position of the ball a little, which he has lost.\n30:16 Comment: And this team without the ball, we already know, suffers a lot.\n30:20 Comment: Well, it will be the third change for Arsenal, prepared by Mikel Arteta from Guipuzcoa.\n30:29 Comment: A couple of weeks ago Arsene Wenger spoke about him and said that if he decides to be a coach, he is convinced that Arteta is going to be a great coach,\n30:34 Comment: Because of how he sees football, because of that vision he has.\n30:37 Comment: Vision for the pass now to Gibson, the vision of the pass was Alexis Sánchez's, Kieran Gibbs did not control it.\n30:44 Comment: He doesn't control the shot, he hasn't lost the ball, Monreal plays it, Navarro crosses.\n30:50 Comment: Clear Toby Alderweireld, recovery of Francis Coqueland.\n30:57 Comment: 14 plus the discount remains for the party.\n31:0 Comment: Ozil's center.\n31:3 Comment: That's Kieran Gibbs' goal.\n31:8 Comment: Arsenal scored, Kieran Gibbs scored, after an extraordinary spectacular cross, and he has several today from Mesut Ozil.\n31:17 Comment: The center that Mesut Ozil invented is outrageous, and it also ended with suspense, because it seems that the ball went in or it didn't go in.\n31:26 Comment: In the end he entered, and squarely, in Kieran Gibbs' goal.\n31:29 Comment: What a crazy pass.\n31:31 Comment: How Gibbs beats Walker, who, as we always say, is looking at the ball and forgets about his back,\n31:38 Comment: He forgets that they can come from behind to finish him off, and Gibbs is really very ready.\n31:42 Comment: But in this play anything we comment on Ozil's pass is unfair.\n31:47 Comment: What a footballer, what quality, what vision, what balls he is putting.\n31:50 Comment: He gave Giroud two, which were two gifts, and Giroud had missed them, and on the third Mesut Ozil got it.\n31:57 Comment: He added one more assist to his long list, and put in a wonderful ball for me, thanks to Gibbs' very good unmarking.\n32:6 Comment: And what we said, Tottenham forgiving, and Arsenal did not forgive on this occasion.\n32:14 Comment: It's a tremendous game ahead of us in the remaining minutes.\n32:16 Comment: After Kieran Gibbs' goal, and that atrocity, that magical, sensational, perfect and impeccable pass from Mesut Ozil.\n32:24 Comment: Debussy is the one who has left his position, Arteta, the right back, Matthew Debussy.\n32:28 Comment: And when Arteta comes on, Arsenal seems to be in a rush, looking for a comeback, looking for the lead.\n32:35 Comment: You are one goal away from being the leader before the break.\n32:38 Comment: A 1-1 tie would not give them the lead, they would still be tied on points with Manchester City.\n32:42 Comment: 26 but with a better goal difference for Man City, they would continue to be leaders.\n32:48 Comment: Let's see if his legs don't shake now, let's see if Tottenham's negative story doesn't come out.\n32:53 Comment: At the Emirates and at Highbury before.\n32:56 Comment: In this final stretch of the game.\n32:59 Comment: Set-ball for the Gunners, Ozil.\n33:2 Comment: Clear Dani Rouse.\n33:5 Comment: Under the Flamini ball.\n33:8 Comment: It seems that the right back has been placed, by the way Flamini.\n33:10 Comment: Mertes serves and Gibbs almost arrives.\n33:14 Comment: Just about to arrive Gibbs again.\n33:17 Comment: Well, tremendous, tremendous how the game gets, the crowd lights up, Arsenal goes with everything.\n33:24 Comment: The team has little strength but it is in that final push that we anticipated.\n33:30 Comment: Ozil's cross, the corner kick and Giroud's shot over the top.\n33:34 Comment: The public wants more goals from Giroud.\n33:37 Comment: We're going to close with the auction today.\n33:40 Comment: Let the door go to the auctions.\n33:44 Comment: That shot was very difficult, I'm especially referring to the header he sent wide when he had everything in his favor.\n33:50 Comment: But hey, a good gesture in any case from Giroud, igniting the public, Arsenal needs him.\n33:55 Comment: Clearly suffering physically but with the strength of the team.\n33:59 Comment: The number of shots, clearly ahead.\n34:3 Comment: Tottenham also in shots on goal but especially overall.\n34:9 Comment: It was offside by Dele Alli.\n34:12 Comment: It's a very good game for Tottenham, also taking into account the opponent.\n34:16 Comment: Who knows, in the time left it could even be completely ruined.\n34:20 Comment: Let's see if he can avoid it.\n34:22 Comment: The touch of the head does not clear Jan Vertonghen.\n34:25 Comment: Eriksen's headshot too, Gibbs didn't leave.\n34:28 Comment: The ball however, in any case goes to Dani Roos.\n34:31 Comment: For Tottenham moving up the left-back, look for Dele Alli.\n34:37 Comment: That clearly gives Pochettino all the freedom in this match.\n34:41 Comment: He has given him all the freedom ahead of Dier.\n34:44 Comment: And in the same way as Tottenham, which is a very difficult game.\n34:47 Comment: Pochettino has given him all the freedom in this match.\n34:50 Comment: He has given him all the freedom ahead of Dier.\n34:53 Comment: And Dembele, center Gibbs.\n34:55 Comment: Very past, absolute inaccuracy in the sending of Kieran Gibbs.\n34:58 Comment: Alexis Sánchez is now missing, knocking down Dani Roos.\n35:8 Comment: Ryan Mason, I think he must have come in earlier.\n35:11 Comment: Me too, I've mentioned it before.\n35:13 Comment: Because of Dembele, I think it's a great change.\n35:15 Comment: The Belgian gives you 50, 60 minutes at most.\n35:20 Comment:  No more.\n35:22 Comment: Last orders from Jesús Pérez, one of the Spanish assistants.\n35:25 Comment: In this case Jesús Pérez de Moritz and Pochettino.\n35:27 Comment: And Ryan Mason, who is going to be the second change of those expelled.\n35:31 Comment: It's going to be very good for Tottenham, it's going to give it freshness.\n35:33 Comment: And he is also a player who ensures good possession because he has quality.\n35:38 Comment: And the team needs him.\n35:46 Comment: It's going to be Ali, Dely Ali.\n35:48 Comment: Well, it's really curious because I've seen Dembele quite fatigued.\n35:52 Comment:  Me too.\n35:54 Comment: But it's also true that Ali has lost a little precision in the last few minutes.\n35:57 Comment: He played much higher in the second half.\n36:0 Comment: And it's true that he wasn't exactly going through his best moment in the game.\n36:5 Comment: Well, there's practically a problem.\n36:7 Comment: Well, it was already with Ali himself, but it's true that Ali was playing almost as a midfielder.\n36:12 Comment: Which is where I think a bit of precision has been lost.\n36:13 Comment: Which is where I think Dembele is going to go now.\n36:15 Comment: Dembele is going back there.\n36:17 Comment: Dembele started the game there and now I think he's going to go back there.\n36:24 Comment: Flameni.\n36:26 Comment: The throw-in for Arsenal.\n36:28 Comment: Occupying the right side that Debussy left Vacante for Arteta to enter.\n36:35 Comment: Tottenham still has one change left.\n36:37 Comment: Arsenal have already done all three.\n36:38 Comment: Spring end of the match with this tie.\n36:40 Comment: One in the North London Grand Derby.\n36:43 Comment: The Grand Derby of London.\n36:45 Comment: Gabriel Paulista, from Villarreal, acknowledged this week that he thought the London Grand Derby\n36:51 Comment: Historically it was Arsenal-Chelsea.\n36:54 Comment: And his companions helped him out of his mistake.\n36:56 Comment: Saying that although Chelsea has grown a lot in recent years, for decades now.\n36:59 Comment: But this is the historic Grand Derby in London.\n37:2 Comment: Arsenal-Tottenham.\n37:3 Comment: Chelsea joined the club of the new rich and the new winners.\n37:7 Comment: Chelsea is not a club with great tradition.\n37:9 Comment: No, that's why I say.\n37:11 Comment: He joined since Ranieri arrived, who was the one who began to lay the foundations for Chelsea.\n37:16 Comment: It's been a few years now.\n37:18 Comment: There began the construction of this Chelsea, Great Chelsea, of recent years.\n37:22 Comment: Ranieri is leaving.\n37:24 Comment: But come on, absolutely with his fantastic ability.\n37:28 Comment: Oliver Giroud.\n37:31 Comment: Corner kick, always dangerous.\n37:34 Comment: A set piece in favor of Arsenal.\n37:36 Comment: And more, as it is today, Ozil with his deliveries, as they say there in England.\n37:41 Comment: Well there it goes.\n37:43 Comment: To continue distributing assists.\n37:46 Comment: An extraordinary thing has happened in this match.\n37:49 Comment: Ozil's huge goal.\n37:51 Comment: Ozil, that was the best goal of the season.\n37:53 Comment: And more assists.\n37:55 Comment: An extraordinary thing has happened in this match.\n37:57 Comment: The sending of Ozil.\n37:59 Comment: Goalkeeper's fists, Lloris.\n38:3 Comment: Evidently they don't count any more assists today.\n38:5 Comment: Because Giroud is not fine.\n38:7 Comment: And once again, there is the punchline.\n38:9 Comment: Oncara also has merit.\n38:11 Comment: Lloris, the chopped shot from his teammate.\n38:13 Comment: How is Ozil?\n38:15 Comment: My goodness, what a mess he's getting.\n38:17 Comment: It's a scandal.\n38:19 Comment: It's an exhibition of German, but impressive.\n38:24 Comment: The ball is going to be precisely for Ozil.\n38:27 Comment: Before Ryan Mason.\n38:29 Comment: Flamini Opening.\n38:31 Comment: Arsenal throw-in, pressing, looking for victory and leadership.\n38:35 Comment: Arsenal would have both gifts for the same price.\n38:41 Comment: You have six or so left plus the discount.\n38:47 Comment: Alexis about to lose.\n38:50 Comment: No, he lost the ball finally.\n38:52 Comment: Heung-Min Son takes it, first for the South Korean.\n38:55 Comment: The former Bayern, Leverkusen.\n38:57 Comment: In which, by the way, he scores a goal per game.\n38:59 Comment: If not, at two goals per game than Chicharito Hernández has ever done.\n39:3 Comment: By the way.\n39:5 Comment: Clear Cech.\n39:8 Comment: Heung-Min Son takes it.\n39:12 Comment: Back to Jan Vertonghen.\n39:19 Comment: Lloris.\n39:22 Comment: Indeed, Dembélé put himself a few meters ahead of what is now the double pivot.\n39:28 Comment: Nacho Monreal's three-quarter line arrives against Eriksen.\n39:40 Comment: Nice touch from Gibbs.\n39:42 Comment: Eriksen is paying attention now.\n39:44 Comment: Very good Eriksen, working hard in the second half.\n39:46 Comment: His sacrifice is great.\n39:48 Comment: Many times he is a very cold player and we say so.\n39:51 Comment: And today he truly deserves praise for the work he is doing on the right wing.\n39:58 Comment: Clear precisely Eriksen.\n40:0 Comment: Try to make it a pass. It's a pass for Harry Kane.\n40:2 Comment: Hold the ball to Kane again.\n40:4 Comment: Throw-in, Tottenham breathe.\n40:8 Comment: Thanks to the oxygen cylinder that Harry Kane's action provided.\n40:12 Comment: That he held the ball and caused the throw-in.\n40:14 Comment: Time that Tottenham wins.\n40:17 Comment: I'm leaving the band and Mauricio Pochettino.\n40:19 Comment: It's not a bad result to draw at the Emirates.\n40:21 Comment: Although if it finally ends 1-1 it will be a bit bittersweet.\n40:25 Comment: Because he has been winning for many minutes.\n40:29 Comment:

serve the ball, Mertesacker points out.\n41:57 Comment: Although he has shot more in the game.\n41:59 Comment: At Arsenal, Giroud, five times.\n42:1 Comment: How do we see there?\n42:4 Comment: Today with a very low percentage of effectiveness.\n42:6 Comment: I don't know if it was seen in the game.\n42:7 Comment: Today with a very low percentage of effectiveness.\n42:9 Comment: Well, zero.\n42:11 Comment: De Giroud.\n42:13 Comment: But today with many shots.\n42:15 Comment: And some in quite clear positions.\n42:19 Comment: Alexis turned well.\n42:21 Comment: The Chilean comes out with the ball.\n42:23 Comment: Long send for Ozil.\n42:25 Comment: Close bottom line.\n42:27 Comment: The German comes clearly there.\n42:29 Comment: Holding Mesut Ozil.\n42:31 Comment: Waiting for the arrival of who.\n42:33 Comment: The arrival of Arteta.\n42:35 Comment: Arteta returns, no.\n42:37 Comment: A center left without a turn.\n42:39 Comment: From Kieran Gibbs.\n42:41 Comment: Even if Tottenham doesn't get the ball.\n42:43 Comment: Yes, he's going to take it out.\n42:45 Comment: Alexis that's vague too.\n42:47 Comment: Chilean's weak game.\n42:49 Comment: Coming late many times.\n42:51 Comment: A little revolutionized.\n42:54 Comment: His game is a bit like that.\n42:56 Comment: But Alexis has been very vague today.\n42:58 Comment: There he already commits a first foul.\n43:0 Comment: And here he commits a second one.\n43:2 Comment: Nothing is going for Alexis today.\n43:6 Comment: There's nothing going for the Chilean today.\n43:10 Comment: Foul he did to Heun Minnson.\n43:17 Comment: Hugo Lloris put the ball into play.\n43:19 Comment: I cut off Miquel Arteta's head.\n43:21 Comment: Giroud back.\n43:23 Comment: Gibbs opens Monreal.\n43:25 Comment: Kieran Gibbs is already going to offer.\n43:27 Comment: Monreal did not see it clearly ahead.\n43:29 Comment: He goes inside to combine with Giroud.\n43:31 Comment: Derek Dye is missing.\n43:33 Comment:  Stopped ball.\n43:35 Comment: Arsenal.\n43:38 Comment: Spring end of the game.\n43:40 Comment: In a minute and a half plus the discount.\n43:42 Comment: It won't go below three, I imagine the discount.\n43:46 Comment: Surely that's it.\n43:48 Comment: Once again the line is very high.\n43:51 Comment: Drawing the line too high.\n43:53 Comment: Tottenham with a lot of space to cover now as they start the race back.\n44:1 Comment: Official setter.\n44:3 Comment: Ogil.\n44:5 Comment: To the left of Eric Dye.\n44:7 Comment: Spherical is for Harry Kane.\n44:12 Comment: It's repeated over now.\n44:14 Comment: He became desperate, he didn't see it clearly.\n44:16 Comment: He gave it to Petr Cech.\n44:21 Comment: Starting Monreal.\n44:25 Comment:  Pass over.\n44:27 Comment: Look for Giroud.\n44:29 Comment: However, he finds Hugo Lloris.\n44:31 Comment: He wins 4 or 5 seconds until he picks up the ball.\n44:33 Comment: Replaced several minutes ago from Lialy.\n44:37 Comment: Here

    "summary": "On a crisp afternoon in North London, the Emirates Stadium played host to one of football’s most fervent rivalries: Arsenal versus Tottenham. The contest was as charged and intense as anticipated, with both teams demonstrating formidable resolve and tactical ingenuity. The final scoreline stood at 1-1, a reflection of an evenly matched battle that saw moments of brilliance, defensive lapses, and tactical wrestling.\n\n### First Half\n\nTottenham kicked off the proceedings, immediately showcasing their intention to assert control. However, the initial minutes were marred by a series of inaccuracies from both sides, as players struggled to find their footing. Arsenal’s left-back Nacho Monreal and Tottenham’s goalkeeper Hugo Lloris were notably involved, as their teams adjusted their strategies on the fly. Referee Martin Atkinson kept a close watch, ensuring the game's tempo was well-regulated.\n\nArsenal's attacking threats were clear from the outset. Mesut Özil and Alexis Sánchez combined expertly, repeatedly testing Tottenham’s defensive fortitude. However, Tottenham’s responses were quick, with players like Mousa Dembele and Christian Eriksen orchestrating counterattacks, feeding the ball to Harry Kane and Dele Alli to exploit Arsenal’s high defensive line.\n\nDespite Arsenal's initial dominance in possession, it was evident that Tottenham's counter-attacks were razor-sharp. Erik Lamela and Harry Kane, in particular, found joy in Arsenal’s half, creating several nervy moments for the Gunners' defense. Kane's intricate footwork and physicality unsettled the Arsenal backline, which had shown vulnerabilities over recent matches.\n\nTottenham's persistence paid off at the 31-minute mark. With Arsenal's defensive line alarmingly high and disjointed, a through ball found Harry Kane, who clinically finished past Petr Cech. It was a goal symptomatic of Arsenal's defensive frailties—ill-positioned and slow to react, providing Kane with ample time and space. Kane's strike was his seventh of the season and a testament to his rediscovered form, having struggled earlier in the campaign.\n\nArsenal’s immediate response was to press harder, resulting in a thrilling first half where both sides had their moments. Özil’s creativity and Sánchez's relentless pressing were constant threats, but clear chances were few. Giroud's header that rattled the crossbar was Arsenal’s closest call in a half that saw Tottenham's defense, marshaled by Toby Alderweireld and Jan Vertonghen, standing resilient.\n\n### Second Half\n\nThe second half commenced with Wenger making a strategic switch. Mathieu Flamini replaced Santi Cazorla, who seemed slightly off the pace in the first half, possibly due to injury. Flamini’s introduction aimed to offer more defensive stability alongside Francis Coquelin, who had been Arsenal's tireless engine throughout.\n\nArsenal ramped up the pressure. Joel Campbell's fierce drive forced Hugo Lloris into an outstanding save, reiterating why the French shot-stopper is considered one of the Premier League's best. The Gunners' intent was unmistakable—they were not prepared to let their North London rivals leave with all three points.\n\nTottenham, however, were unyielding. Eriksen continued to pull the strings in midfield, while Dele Alli's tireless running and smart positioning created constant headaches for Arsenal. The Spurs were no stranger to the physical demands of the game, as demonstrated by their relentless pressing and quick transitions.\n\nThe game saw a crucial turning point when Lamela, who had played commendably, picked up a yellow card for a rash challenge. Sensing the danger of a second booking, Mauricio Pochettino replaced him with the South Korean Heung-Min Son around the 70-minute mark. Son's introduction sought to exploit the spaces Arsenal would inevitably leave in their chase for an equalizer.\n\nArsenal’s persistence bore fruit in the 77th minute. A sublime cross from Mesut Özil, who was having an outstanding game, found substitute Kieran Gibbs. Gibbs, having replaced the underperforming Joel Campbell, slotted the ball home at the far post, much to the delight of the Emirates faithful. The goal epitomized Arsenal’s relentless pursuit and Özil’s vision and precision in delivering yet another assist.\n\nThe last quarter of the game was frenetic. Both teams knew what was at stake—bragging rights, crucial points, and the psychological edge in one of English football’s storied rivalries. Arsenal threw everything forward, with Olivier Giroud coming agonizingly close on multiple occasions, including hitting the crossbar. Özil continued to produce moments of magic, his deliveries into the box causing chaos and panic in Tottenham's defenses.\n\nIn response, Tottenham remained dangerous on the counter. Harry Kane’s hold-up play was exceptional, repeatedly giving his side the chance to regroup and launch counter-attacks. Eriksen, despite fatigued legs, never stopped running, closing down spaces and trying to feed the fast-paced Son.\n\nDefensively, both teams had their moments of vulnerability, but individual brilliance repeatedly bailed them out. Petr Cech made timely saves to deny Kane and Eriksen, while Hugo Lloris commanded his area with authority, pulling off vital saves and punches to keep his side in the game.\n\nIn the dying minutes, in an attempt to see out the match, Tottenham introduced Joshua Onomah, a young prospect who brought fresh legs into the midfield battle. Arsenal, meanwhile, had already exhausted their substitutions, calling upon the experience of Mikel Arteta, hoping his composure and leadership would push them over the line.\n\nAs the final whistle blew, the scoreline read 1-1. A draw perhaps mirrored the game’s narrative—an exhibition of skill, heart, and the essence of a derby. Both teams had their spells, their moments of ascendency, and their scares, leaving fans breathless and eagerly awaiting the next installment of this storied rivalry.\n\n### Final Thoughts\n\nThe North London Derby never disappoints, and today was no exception. While Arsenal might rue their missed opportunities and Tottenham may feel they could have closed the game, the contest saw both sets of players rise to the occasion in an exhilarating football exhibition.\n\nFor Arsenal, the road ahead looks challenging, especially with mounting injuries to key players. The afternoon saw a ray of hope in terms of resilience and fighting spirit, but critical questions remain regarding their defensive consistency and finishing prowess. \n\nTottenham, on the other hand, showcased their growth under Pochettino—a more mature, balanced squad capable of competing against the Premier League’s elite. Kane's returning form, coupled with the youthful zeal of players like Dele Alli, positions them as genuine contenders for at least a top-four finish.\n\nIn conclusion, the 1-1 draw was not just a fair result for the match but a fitting reflection of two teams poised for exciting campaigns. Arsenal and Tottenham both walked away with a point, and the fans with memories of yet another unforgettable derby."
