    "input": "\n    Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester\n\nFirst Half:\n\n0:0 Comment: It's been a sprinkling of the showers.\n0:2 Comment: Pitch is in, as you'd expect, pristine condition.\n0:10 Comment: And here's Rooney straight away.\n0:13 Comment: Finding Juan Mata.\n0:16 Comment: Shelby coming out to block from Schneiderlin.\n0:19 Comment: And Taylor hasn't really got that one away.\n0:24 Comment: And the Swimsy penned into their own penalty area at the moment.\n0:30 Comment: And Andre Ayew clears his hands, Smalling in smartly.\n0:34 Comment: And Martin Atkinson, the referee, right on the spot to give Manchester United a free kick.\n0:39 Comment: Yeah, a bit of a nervy start by the home team,\n0:43 Comment: and Kyle Norton just trying to nibble away at the ball.\n0:46 Comment: To concede a free kick in a pretty encouraging place for Manchester United early on here,\n0:52 Comment: chance to warm Pabianski's hands.\n1:0 Comment: FANS CHANT\n1:3 Comment: And Juan Mata, the left-footer, Manchester Pryor.\n1:10 Comment: Certainly settled in quickly,\n1:13 Comment: but is still looking for a first Premier League goal.\n1:18 Comment: And it might come early here at...\n1:21 Comment: WHISTLE BLOWS\n1:28 Comment: And it very nearly did, it's carried away by Pabianski,\n1:31 Comment: put back by Damian, and Swansea struggling to get it away.\n1:35 Comment: A lot of Gary Monk's pre-match talk has been to his players\n1:38 Comment: about treating every fixture as the same,\n1:41 Comment: and not being, if you like, freaked out by the fact that they're up against\n1:46 Comment: the famous names of Manchester United.\n1:49 Comment: Well, they shouldn't be over-ordered, as we all know,\n1:51 Comment: they've got the double against United,\n1:53 Comment: same applied to Arsenal, home and away they've been,\n1:56 Comment: so they've got a good track record against the big teams.\n1:59 Comment: Just need to settle down here.\n2:3 Comment: Fernandes with the header.\n2:10 Comment: And Herrera trying to tee up Mata.\n2:13 Comment: And the pie was coming in from the opposite flank again,\n2:15 Comment: it was who could get there first for the job.\n2:18 Comment: And it was, by Mata.\n2:20 Comment: Pabianski wasn't tested then, but he was from the free-kick column.\n2:24 Comment: You can see him coming, it's one of those awkward ones,\n2:26 Comment: just pitches in front of him, decides not to try and grab hold\n2:30 Comment: and shove it into a less dangerous area, which he does pretty well.\n2:37 Comment: We're hearing news from the other side of Manchester\n2:40 Comment: that Kevin De Bruyne is confirmed as a new arrival.\n2:44 Comment: Undisclosed for you, but it's a lot.\n2:47 Comment: I can tell you that.\n2:50 Comment: Reinsdager.\n2:51 Comment: Luke Shaw has also looked more like the young man signed from Southampton\n2:57 Comment: than he did in his first season with Manchester United.\n3:5 Comment: It's been a good start here by Van Gaal's team.\n3:10 Comment: Yeah, signs that some understanding is developing all over the pitch for United.\n3:16 Comment: He's picked a settled team, particularly that back four.\n3:21 Comment: And he's got a Welshman to help him down here in South Wales,\n3:24 Comment: Ryan Giggs, of course, on the right.\n3:25 Comment: That's from the rival camp of Cardiff.\n3:33 Comment: Where he was born and where his family come from.\n3:38 Comment: And he's intercepted.\n3:40 Comment: Lees-Pickett.\n3:41 Comment: Had a chance to go on and Ryan Routledge trying to catch Damian out.\n3:47 Comment: And it's good to work by the Italian.\n3:48 Comment: Yeah, slightly different challenge for Damian now without Jefferson Montero.\n3:53 Comment: Routledge probably won't go down the outside quite as often as Montero might have.\n3:58 Comment: Routledge is quick, but not even he's as quick as his team-mate.\n4:3 Comment: And here's a play to Swansea.\n4:8 Comment: One of the longer back passes from Shelby.\n4:11 Comment: Well, he continues to make such a good name for himself here.\n4:15 Comment: Still very young in management.\n4:17 Comment: And he knows what he wants.\n4:20 Comment: Yeah, it's that attention to detail he was talking about overseas,\n4:24 Comment: everything that happens at this football club.\n4:26 Comment: That's the way it should be.\n4:31 Comment: And what all the Premier League managers are still thinking of about the transfer window.\n4:35 Comment: And it has been strange, I must say, to have these four rounds of Premier League fixtures\n4:40 Comment: while the opportunity for change is still available.\n4:51 Comment: Routledge trying to get on the inside.\n4:53 Comment: And Damian in a good position as well, he had to go right across there with his immediate opponent.\n4:58 Comment: Yeah, he saw the danger and reacted really quickly, really well.\n5:3 Comment: Actually, he was first really seen as an international prospect in England.\n5:8 Comment: He played for Italy, made his debut against the Republic of Ireland\n5:11 Comment: in a match that was played at Fulham just before the last World Cup.\n5:14 Comment: He got into the World Cup squad, he got into the team, played against England in Manaus.\n5:19 Comment: Played very well, he's a very good player.\n5:21 Comment: He's a very good player, he's a very good manager.\n5:26 Comment: He's a very good manager, he's a very good manager.\n5:28 Comment: He got into the team, played against England in Manaus.\n5:31 Comment: Played very well against England in Manaus.\n5:36 Comment: And it's been quite a rise for the full-back from Torino.\n5:41 Comment: He'll get forward when he can.\n5:43 Comment: But first and foremost, I think he needs to defend.\n5:48 Comment: That's his strength.\n5:52 Comment: Smaller.\n5:56 Comment: Now blipped.\n5:59 Comment: Into Roo.\n6:2 Comment: He took his tally of senior club goals, including those with Everton, to 250.\n6:8 Comment: With the credit of his hat-trick.\n6:21 Comment: And certainly right in the eye of the early storm,\n6:25 Comment: Matteo Damiano, wasting no time in just clearing his lines there.\n6:34 Comment: Swansea beat Newcastle here, only Manchester City have won both their home games.\n6:40 Comment: And this extraordinary imbalance at the start of the season between home wins and away wins,\n6:45 Comment: even the one that you may have just seen with us earlier.\n6:49 Comment: Southampton over Norwich was shaped by first-half sending off for Steven Whittaker of Norwich.\n6:59 Comment: Ashley Williams.\n7:4 Comment: He kicks it long, Romero, he's not got too much to aim at in terms of height,\n7:8 Comment: has he, with Matavuni to pie up front three?\n7:13 Comment: Sure.\n7:15 Comment: He's in quickly.\n7:18 Comment: Smalling likewise.\n7:22 Comment: The games between these two have been tight.\n7:25 Comment: She decided by just an odd goal, usually 2-1.\n7:29 Comment: Here's Taylor.\n7:32 Comment: Schmeichel gets in the way.\n7:34 Comment: Mata.\n7:36 Comment: Goes again, Spaniard.\n7:40 Comment: Here's Bastien's Freistegger.\n7:45 Comment: Sure.\n7:49 Comment: This new composure has been helped in the superstitious nature of players\n7:53 Comment: by reverting back to the number he wore at Southampton, 23,\n7:56 Comment: rather than the three he had with Manchester United last season.\n8:1 Comment: And the range at his own request.\n8:3 Comment: So much depends on your fitness as a footballer,\n8:6 Comment: and now he's got that fitness it looks like, and the confidence returns.\n8:12 Comment: Herrera.\n8:14 Comment: Improvisation from Schmeichel.\n8:18 Comment: Goes in again, but he's beaten to it by Sch√§uble.\n8:23 Comment: Mata.\n8:25 Comment: Seems to space and accelerate again to it.\n8:27 Comment: Ruini breaking to the right, but took too long, can't matter.\n8:33 Comment: Smalling.\n8:34 Comment: They played at a good tempo, the home games for Manchester United,\n8:38 Comment: the passing has been a little bit on the slow side.\n8:41 Comment: And they only beat Tottenham with their own goal from Kyle Walker.\n8:44 Comment: Normal against Newcastle.\n8:53 Comment: Damien.\n9:1 Comment: Freisteg.\n9:11 Comment: I like to see what pans out with the David De Gea situation.\n9:15 Comment: He wants to go back to Spain, to link up with Spain,\n9:18 Comment: and the national team.\n9:21 Comment: I don't think we'll get any opportunity to talk to the Madrid...\n9:29 Comment: Directors, management.\n9:32 Comment: It will all depend on what Manchester United allow him to do, of course.\n9:35 Comment: It should.\n9:37 Comment: Yes, it should.\n9:38 Comment: Doesn't always work that way.\n9:44 Comment: Fernandes.\n9:48 Comment: Well, Manchester United were moving smoothly\n9:52 Comment: into the group stage of the Champions League.\n9:56 Comment: Swansea were moving smoothly into the next round of the Capital One Cup.\n9:59 Comment: Didn't get quite so much in the way of headlines.\n10:3 Comment: And 3-0 win over York City here.\n10:8 Comment: It looked like he got the ball, Ashley Williams,\n10:10 Comment: but so often these days it might be deemed a dangerous challenge,\n10:14 Comment: and I think that's what Martin Atkinson's saying.\n10:19 Comment: Discipline has been emphasised this weekend, hasn't it?\n10:22 Comment: We've had a six-red card today in this round of fixtures.\n10:28 Comment: Rooney.\n10:32 Comment: Blin.\n10:36 Comment: Swansea haven't quite got going yet.\n10:39 Comment: Cork tries to make that happen, he was caught as he played the ball forward.\n10:47 Comment: But all the officials followed the ball.\n10:56 Comment: Smalling.\n11:11 Comment: He's getting regular.\n11:13 Comment: He's the manager.\n11:27 Comment: FANS CHANT\n11:36 Comment: There's been a far more consistent degree of selection\n11:39 Comment: at the start of this season than there was a year ago.\n11:46 Comment: Of course, there's a lot of talk about injuries,\n11:48 Comment: they've found a whole way of extra training,\n11:50 Comment: and this has really got their bodies accustomed to that.\n11:58 Comment: Here's Gomez.\n12:3 Comment: Kofi Sigurdsson.\n12:4 Comment: We haven't seen too much of him so far, and he's not there.\n12:7 Comment: When they gave the ball away, United,\n12:9 Comment: but they get back into their defensive shape really quickly.\n12:12 Comment: Midfielders tuck him in front of the back four.\n12:19 Comment: It's not the easiest back pass for Khabibovsky to kick away,\n12:23 Comment: but it's where Andrei didn't think he could go for it\n12:28 Comment: when he was coming back from an offside position.\n12:30 Comment: He's probably right.\n12:36 Comment: Damir.\n12:42 Comment: There haven't been too many of these games down the years.\n12:44 Comment: It's only the 13th season in which Swansea and United\n12:46 Comment: have ever been in the same division.\n12:49 Comment: Two chunks, really.\n12:51 Comment: A spell of six seasons in the 1930s,\n12:53 Comment: when they were both in the old second division.\n12:55 Comment: This is the fifth consecutive campaign\n12:58 Comment: they've met in the Barclays Premier League.\n13:6 Comment: Shelby.\n13:13 Comment: Fernandes.\n13:14 Comment: And he does.\n13:17 Comment: Helped out by Cork.\n13:20 Comment: Manchester United have started well with the ball,\n13:22 Comment: and they're doing quite well without the ball as well.\n13:27 Comment: Stepping, Swansea picking up the passing rhythm\n13:31 Comment: that they are so good at when they're on song.\n13:36 Comment: There's a reason why they've restricted the number of shots\n13:38 Comment: at their own goal.\n13:40 Comment: The fewest in the division so far.\n13:43 Comment: He worked really hard on that shining ground.\n13:46 Comment: That was a good line there.\n13:47 Comment: He would have been offside again if he'd gone for it.\n13:54 Comment: Quite an accomplishment for Swansea\n13:55 Comment: to bring Andrea Ayo here from Marseille.\n13:57 Comment: A lot of other clubs, possibly of a higher profile,\n14:1 Comment: were interested, but he was very taken with\n14:6 Comment: the potential of the facilities here.\n14:9 Comment: When Swansea finished so well last season,\n14:11 Comment: the kind of football they do like to play.\n14:15 Comment: Got away with that there, John J. Shelby,\n14:16 Comment: trying to ball out the corner into Jack Court.\n14:19 Comment: That's Feinsteiger, did anticipate.\n14:23 Comment: Northam.\n14:26 Comment: Don't miss his coming short,\n14:27 Comment: but there's no-one really from midfield breaking beyond\n14:30 Comment: to make it all good for the Manchester United back line.\n14:35 Comment: Mata wins the header, and Williams wins the header.\n14:37 Comment: Damian wins the header.\n14:39 Comment: Taylor doesn't quite put it,\n14:41 Comment: squirts off back to covering Cork.\n14:54 Comment: First season, Fabian Skiapka's moved down here from Arsenal.\n14:59 Comment: Player's player of 14-15.\n15:5 Comment: It was a great honour to get that.\n15:10 Comment: Ander Herrera.\n15:18 Comment: He talks about possession,\n15:20 Comment: Louis van Gaal would be pretty pleased with those figures.\n15:24 Comment: Early on here.\n15:32 Comment: Northam.\n15:36 Comment: Fernandes.\n15:40 Comment: Having Schneidlin behind him allows Feinsteiger to go forward\n15:44 Comment: and make a higher press then.\n15:47 Comment: North Swansea back to the goalkeeper.\n15:50 Comment: The route by Smalling, taking charge.\n15:56 Comment: Shaw.\n16:5 Comment: De Puy.\n16:10 Comment: Here's Mata.\n16:12 Comment: Damian goes outside him.\n16:15 Comment: Mata has other ideas.\n16:18 Comment: Schneidlin.\n16:22 Comment: Smalling.\n16:24 Comment: Pinterini lets it run.\n16:27 Comment: A call from Ander Herrera.\n16:28 Comment: Referee's played an advantage here, Herrera said he took one.\n16:33 Comment: Back on his feet now.\n16:34 Comment: Wide by Feinsteiger to Damian.\n16:41 Comment: Mata.\n16:44 Comment: Drifting away.\n16:46 Comment: As Memphis de Puy.\n16:48 Comment: Hoping the ball might actually come to him directly.\n16:51 Comment: Northam just got a bit of a knick and it is a corner.\n16:54 Comment: Not too many gaps out there.\n16:55 Comment: Two teams really well set up when they haven't got the ball.\n17:5 Comment: De Puy.\n17:16 Comment: De Puy on the corner.\n17:18 Comment: Schneidlin knocks it back and...\n17:20 Comment: Well, Smalling went for it.\n17:22 Comment: Pretty entitled to do that.\n17:23 Comment: His head was fairly low, wasn't it, Fernandez, but Smalling did pull out.\n17:45 Comment: A tight little stadium here with a tremendous atmosphere.\n17:48 Comment: Owned by the local council.\n17:49 Comment: It's one day...\n17:51 Comment: Swansea City will have the resources to hide the ground for themselves.\n17:56 Comment: And here's Rooney, running free.\n17:59 Comment: And Williams got back.\n18:1 Comment: They thought about the first time shot, Wayne Rooney.\n18:4 Comment: And in the end, he's decided against beautifully weighted Pastor Luke Shaw.\n18:8 Comment: It really is taking out two players almost, but not quite.\n18:13 Comment: And it's a very good game.\n18:14 Comment: That's a bit of a history against Manchester United.\n18:16 Comment: Remember the Robin Van Persie incident?\n18:20 Comment: Yes.\n18:21 Comment: Provoked a fairly emphatic comment from Simon Ferguson.\n18:29 Comment: And it's a bit of a history against Manchester United.\n18:31 Comment: Remember the Robin Van Persie incident?\n18:33 Comment: Yes.\n18:34 Comment: Provoked a fairly emphatic comment from Simon Ferguson.\n18:40 Comment: And it's a bit of a history against Manchester United.\n18:45 Comment: And there was no real harm done.\n18:47 Comment: And this gesture against the right foot.\n18:50 Comment: It's important for them today.\n18:51 Comment: Andre Ayou, if he can...\n18:54 Comment: Get himself inside.\n18:56 Comment: Give Gomis a little bit of support.\n18:59 Comment: He normally does that.\n19:0 Comment: That is his natural game.\n19:5 Comment: At least Swansea have got the ball in a position to have a throw.\n19:9 Comment: 30 yards from the Manchester United goal.\n19:12 Comment: They've had it hard to get up the pitch in this first almost 20 minutes.\n19:16 Comment: But as you said, Alan, they haven't...\n19:18 Comment: Apart from that last moment where Rooney looked as though he might be clear.\n19:22 Comment: They haven't looked particularly vulnerable defensively.\n19:24 Comment: Although Manchester United have started well.\n19:28 Comment: Schweinsteiger.\n19:30 Comment: Rooney.\n19:34 Comment: Schneiderlin.\n19:39 Comment: Rooney.\n19:45 Comment: Mata and Damian both holding positions down beneath us here.\n19:50 Comment: The play could have been switched but...\n19:53 Comment: A little bit left with Shaw.\n20:0 Comment: And here comes Mata!\n20:9 Comment: Well, they were opened up then, Swansea, by some good Manchester United build-up.\n20:14 Comment: Yeah.\n20:15 Comment: Again with Depay and what a piece of footwork this is for Mando Herrera just to find his compatriot.\n20:21 Comment: You expect him, Mata, to be a bit better than what he did in the end.\n20:25 Comment: Dragging his shot.\n20:26 Comment: Sees the two challenges coming in and I think that affected him.\n20:29 Comment: It's the 50th game for Louis van Gaal in charge of Manchester United.\n20:33 Comment: It would have been Mata's 50th goal in English football.\n20:38 Comment: And he put that one away.\n20:43 Comment: Rooney.\n20:44 Comment: Shit!\n20:45 Comment: And he's kept it in only for Ashley Williams' benefit.\n20:52 Comment: Fernandes.\n20:54 Comment: And he's got it.\n20:56 Comment: Fernandes.\n21:0 Comment: Cross goes splint.\n21:3 Comment: We were right about Andre Ayo when he looked at his career, Alan.\n21:5 Comment: He has played as a central striker.\n21:8 Comment: But the way Gaiman likes to play with two wide men and just one down the middle,\n21:13 Comment: which is obviously back to Timmy Gomez.\n21:17 Comment: Recent goals record.\n21:19 Comment: He will get in that box in first.\n21:21 Comment: He has, hasn't he? He's scored a couple of goals already.\n21:24 Comment: Today, if his team give him a chance to do that,\n21:26 Comment: if they get good possession in the final third,\n21:30 Comment: which they have managed so far.\n21:35 Comment: Schneiderlin.\n21:37 Comment: Run out of fingers to count the ex-Southampton players.\n21:41 Comment: Dotted around the Premier League.\n21:44 Comment: A couple here, of course, as well.\n21:45 Comment: Swansea Jack Cork, who's playing.\n21:48 Comment: Nathan Dyer.\n21:50 Comment: Can't get in the team at the moment.\n21:54 Comment: Rooney.\n21:55 Comment: Matip.\n22:0 Comment: Damien.\n22:15 Comment: Certainly,\n22:17 Comment: approaching this task very confidently.\n22:19 Comment: Manchester United\n22:21 Comment: being reminded all week about the double Swansea did over them\n22:25 Comment: last season.\n22:27 Comment: Of course, the season before that, it was Swansea knocking United out of the FA Cup\n22:31 Comment: at Old Trafford 2.\n22:37 Comment: Third of the game in Swansea's defensive third.\n22:40 Comment: But most of it has been in front of that Swansea backboard.\n22:44 Comment: Challenge for United to try and get behind the back of the backboard.\n22:47 Comment: Challenge for United to try and get behind.\n22:50 Comment: There's the whip for the pitch.\n22:56 Comment: A clever ball.\n22:58 Comment: Gomez can line this one up.\n23:0 Comment: He crashes at it, but\n23:2 Comment: crashes it wide as Romero's goal.\n23:7 Comment: The best moment, really.\n23:8 Comment: Jonjo Shelby aggressively going in to win possession.\n23:11 Comment: Daley Blink just gets his body position\n23:14 Comment: a little awkwardly.\n23:16 Comment: And that was a thrash, a wild one.\n23:24 Comment: He didn't rest on his laurels, having made the pass.\n23:28 Comment: He had to come back and cover that\n23:30 Comment: attempted forward dart from Short.\n23:42 Comment: And he's got the winner here\n23:45 Comment: in February.\n23:47 Comment: Just deflecting that Jonjo\n23:49 Comment: Shelby shot.\n23:59 Comment: Halfway through the first half,\n24:0 Comment: Swansea City nil, Manchester United nil.\n24:9 Comment: Shelby.\n24:12 Comment: And Fernandes.\n24:14 Comment: The back on the back,\n24:15 Comment: delivered by Smalling on\n24:18 Comment: Ayoub.\n24:25 Comment: I don't know if it was Ayoub backing in or\n24:27 Comment: Smalling coming through, but there was a shove.\n24:31 Comment: Which Ayoub makes the most of.\n24:41 Comment: Shelby will take the free kick.\n24:44 Comment: It's not enough.\n24:56 Comment: It's low.\n24:57 Comment: Gomez.\n24:58 Comment: Just one quick thinking\n25:0 Comment: by Gilfrey Sigurdsson,\n25:2 Comment: who's got such an eye for goal\n25:4 Comment: from midfield.\n25:5 Comment: It was just a break of the ball, wasn't it?\n25:6 Comment: I think it was Schweinsteiger that sticks out\n25:8 Comment: a leg here and pokes it through.\n25:13 Comment: He is normally\n25:15 Comment: very reliable in front of goal.\n25:16 Comment: He's really had to twist the body.\n25:20 Comment: It's not the best of defending from United\n25:21 Comment: to concede that chance.\n25:23 Comment: Going from the training ground,\n25:24 Comment: from the brand new training ground\n25:25 Comment: that Swansea have got,\n25:26 Comment: state of the art.\n25:28 Comment: Emphasising again\n25:31 Comment: the mark of an emergency.\n25:32 Comment: The goalkeeper's in trouble here.\n25:35 Comment: And Shelby responded to the poor kick from Romelu.\n25:38 Comment: Romelu to\n25:40 Comment: get the shot on target.\n25:41 Comment: He's got the crowd going.\n25:43 Comment: There's been some poor kicking out\n25:44 Comment: from both keepers so far.\n25:46 Comment: Fell to the right man in Shelby.\n25:48 Comment: He's always willing to have a crack\n25:49 Comment: from those kind of situations.\n25:52 Comment: Well read by Schweinsteiger.\n25:54 Comment: Here's Depay.\n25:57 Comment: Whipping in over\n25:58 Comment: Bastiaan Schweinsteiger.\n26:0 Comment: Memphis Depay is there again.\n26:5 Comment: Shaw.\n26:7 Comment: Running on to the head of Ashley Williams.\n26:10 Comment: There's Schneiderlin.\n26:14 Comment: Ayoub.\n26:20 Comment: A matter of chance at one end\n26:21 Comment: and the\n26:22 Comment: Sigurdsson run at the other.\n26:25 Comment: What has been\n26:27 Comment: a pretty tight opening\n26:29 Comment: chapter or two to this particular story.\n26:32 Comment: It's giving Swansea a lift,\n26:33 Comment: that little pass to Playbo.\n26:36 Comment: Here's Gomez.\n26:38 Comment: Forcing his way through.\n26:40 Comment: Still going.\n26:41 Comment: Oh, and it glanced off the end of the net.\n26:43 Comment: A little outside of the post.\n26:46 Comment: He is a powerful man.\n26:48 Comment: He certainly is.\n26:49 Comment: He did have a chance to\n26:51 Comment: get his shot away\n26:52 Comment: a little earlier,\n26:53 Comment: but the initial bit of play\n26:54 Comment: was top class.\n26:55 Comment: Could have done it there.\n26:56 Comment: That's a difficult finish\n26:57 Comment: stretching with the outside\n26:58 Comment: of his right foot.\n26:59 Comment: A difficult one really\n27:0 Comment: to get on target,\n27:1 Comment: but he's not too far\n27:3 Comment: away from achieving it.\n27:8 Comment: And he goes to ground\n27:9 Comment: when he scores,\n27:10 Comment: doesn't he,\n27:11 Comment: with that Panther-like\n27:12 Comment: preparation.\n27:13 Comment: He was beating the turf\n27:14 Comment: this time in frustration.\n27:18 Comment: Well, started the game\n27:19 Comment: really well at Chelsea\n27:20 Comment: and he's kicked off\n27:21 Comment: and now\n27:23 Comment: he's lively enough now.\n27:34 Comment: Still\n27:36 Comment: no one with the\n27:37 Comment: accolade of being a\n27:38 Comment: Premier League goalscorer\n27:40 Comment: against Manchester United\n27:41 Comment: this season.\n27:42 Comment: And the only goal\n27:43 Comment: of course they have conceded\n27:44 Comment: counting the Champions League\n27:45 Comment: play-off matches\n27:46 Comment: was their own goal\n27:47 Comment: by Michael Kirk\n27:48 Comment: at home to Bruges.\n28:2 Comment: To Rooney\n28:3 Comment: as well as the target\n28:5 Comment: and it is Feinsteiger.\n28:8 Comment: When the build-up\n28:9 Comment: is patient\n28:10 Comment: and pretty slow\n28:11 Comment: it's hard for Wayne Rooney\n28:12 Comment: because he's\n28:13 Comment: constantly changing

Ronaldinho\n29:1 Comment: to squeeze it through\n29:2 Comment: to Damian.\n29:4 Comment: Didn't like the way he did it\n29:5 Comment: but the referee\n29:7 Comment: hasn't moved\n29:8 Comment: and can Rooney reach this\n29:9 Comment: when he can\n29:10 Comment: and he needed to just\n29:11 Comment: glance off the end of his toe\n29:12 Comment: rather than drop onto\n29:13 Comment: the meat of his foot.\n29:15 Comment: Yeah, a really difficult one\n29:16 Comment: actually that\n29:17 Comment: but I'm surprised the\n29:18 Comment: referee allowed this challenge\n29:19 Comment: to go really\n29:20 Comment: because he's overrun it\n29:21 Comment: for Smalling\n29:22 Comment: and he's stretching into the\n29:23 Comment: tackle, into the player.\n29:27 Comment: So often you see those\n29:29 Comment: penalised but\n29:30 Comment: Ref Waves play on.\n29:37 Comment: The player is Jack Cork\n29:39 Comment: and the referee is\n29:40 Comment: Martin Atkinson.\n29:52 Comment: And

Tied to the tactical.\n43:47 Comment: So far.\n44:4 Comment: Great detail in the preparation\n44:5 Comment: for both managers.\n44:7 Comment: And.\n44:8 Comment: The.\n44:9 Comment: Dossier.\n44:10

The.\n44:36 Comment: Damien.\n44:39 Comment: Matter.\n44:42 Comment: Well fought against Feinsteiger\n44:43 Comment: is to run his.\n44:45 Comment: From.\n44:46 Comment: The other part of midfield where\n44:47 Comment: the possession isn't.\n44:49 Comment: Being used.\n44:50 Comment: And the Herrera.\n44:53 Comment: Blind.\n44:56 Comment: Fire.\n44:57 Comment: To.\n44:58 Comment: Get hold of that.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: FANS SHOUT OUT\n0:12 Comment: Manchester United would like to start the second half as well as they started the first.\n0:20 Comment: Certainly Swansea got themselves back into the game.\n0:24 Comment: And survived that opening 20 minutes.\n0:28 Comment: There weren't too many chances, there was the matter one.\n0:32 Comment: He broke in behind but was just stopped in the act of shooting by Ashley Williams.\n0:44 Comment: Fernandes.\n0:48 Comment: Taylor.\n0:49 Comment: FANS SHOUT OUT\n0:56 Comment: Now Williams.\n1:9 Comment: Norton.\n1:10 Comment: Gomez, Shelby anticipated a touch like that.\n1:13 Comment: Just he would say, found the ball coming behind him.\n1:16 Comment: Gomez might say he got ahead of the ball.\n1:23 Comment: Shaw jumping for this, beaten by Fernandes.\n1:33 Comment: Still Romero to concede a Premier League goal in his short time with Manchester United.\n1:39 Comment: Not afraid to say that he hasn't been overly worked.\n1:42 Comment: But has looked a little suspect at times here, particularly when it comes to his kicking.\n1:50 Comment: That was Daley Blind really playing it across.\n1:53 Comment: Routledge had the chance to embarrass Damian.\n1:59 Comment: It was so sloppy that in general, something that any coach would hate.\n2:5 Comment: Shooting themselves in the foot United there unnecessarily.\n2:12 Comment: FANS SHOUT OUT\n2:23 Comment: Shelby will take it.\n2:32 Comment: Fernandes.\n2:34 Comment: Pushed deeper and round the back by Ashley Williams.\n2:38 Comment: No one could get across the line of the ball to cause any discomfort to Romero then.\n2:44 Comment: You look at the position of Gomez, he's in between Luke Shaw and Wayne Rooney there.\n2:48 Comment: Fast it.\n2:51 Comment: A bit lucky to get beyond Carmichael, and his challenge wasn't the most determined one.\n2:56 Comment: He could carve something out for Manchester United here.\n2:59 Comment: And he has done.\n3:1 Comment: One matter at the far post.\n3:7 Comment: Shaw got forward.\n3:9 Comment: United would say well, Swansea would say they could have done better defensively.\n3:14 Comment: And Matta coming in from the opposite flank.\n3:16 Comment: If you keep running in there, something like that will happen one day.\n3:19 Comment: It's happened today.\n3:20 Comment: But Juan Matta, 50 goals up in his English club career.\n3:23 Comment: Well that's where you've got to be, haven't you?\n3:24 Comment: When the ball's down the left, that player on the right has got to make sure he does influence things.\n3:29 Comment: Ashley Williams will feel maybe he could have done a bit better.\n3:32 Comment: He's just trying to find Wayne Rooney at the near.\n3:34 Comment: But it goes all the way to the far.\n3:37 Comment: Maybe Williams doesn't really know that Matta's whereabouts there.\n3:41 Comment: And when he reacts, it's too late.\n3:46 Comment: Well, with a one in the first half, from a little further out, he knew he was going to get clattered.\n3:49 Comment: And put it wide.\n3:50 Comment: This time he was so close, he was prepared to take what was coming his way to score the goal.\n3:55 Comment: To make it Swansea City 0-0, Manchester United 1.\n3:59 Comment: 50 up for him on Louis van Gaal's 50th match for Manchester United as their boss.\n4:5 Comment: And it's heading to be maybe a happier outcome than his two previous meetings with Swansea City.\n4:13 Comment: If memory serves me right, United scored first in the fixture here last season.\n4:19 Comment: And ended up losing 2-1.\n4:22 Comment: Good play.\n4:35 Comment: Here from Payew.\n4:40 Comment: It's an accidental one from Luke Shaw. Both players going for the ball.\n4:45 Comment: It's a stamp on the knee, but I certainly don't think it was deliberate.\n4:58 Comment: The pie.\n5:1 Comment: And the ball.\n5:12 Comment: The pie.\n5:17 Comment: Damien.\n5:19 Comment: Doing a bit of wandering.\n5:23 Comment: Steps Williams.\n5:34 Comment: Tied in by Memphis.\n5:35 Comment: The pie, and it crossed so easily.\n5:37 Comment: It's been an own goal.\n5:38 Comment: It's a good reach by Fabianski.\n5:40 Comment: Ashley Williams breathing a sigh of relief.\n5:43 Comment: It's a hand ball by Frank Zaga, the referee's looking straight at it.\n5:46 Comment: So if it was, he was going to give it.\n5:48 Comment: Good reaction from the Swansea keeper.\n5:51 Comment: Yeah, Ashley Williams having a bit of a moment here.\n5:55 Comment: If that would have been unlucky for Swansea, it would have ended up in the back of the net.\n6:4 Comment: He does do well, Fabianski.\n6:8 Comment: It's so often the case, isn't it, in Premier League football, maybe in all football,\n6:13 Comment: when you get one nil up, to get the second goal.\n6:19 Comment: If you can get it, you can perhaps put the game to bed with the right results.\n6:23 Comment: But if not...\n6:27 Comment: Swansea themselves were leading at some level in the last game.\n6:30 Comment: Jermain Defoe came up and grabbed an equaliser.\n6:39 Comment: Cricket given against Flint.\n6:41 Comment: Shelby's delivery.\n6:43 Comment: FANS ROAR\n7:7 Comment: Shelby's delivery.\n7:10 Comment: He was trying to get there first.\n7:13 Comment: Domi's trying to hunt it down on the far side.\n7:18 Comment: And Steinke did so well at the near post there, to get a toe to that cross.\n7:39 Comment: FANS ROAR\n7:46 Comment: Williams.\n7:52 Comment: Easy ball for Norton to collect.\n7:58 Comment: There's been very few defensive mistakes, certainly from his team.\n8:2 Comment: They've been nice and tight, but...\n8:5 Comment: could have ruined that time for Luke Shaw.\n8:10 Comment: One nil up, Manchester United are in for Tottenham,\n8:13 Comment: and won the game, one nil up, away to Aston Villa, and won the game.\n8:17 Comment: They lead one nil here.\n8:21 Comment: Here's the man who supplied it.\n8:26 Comment: Down to Herrera.\n8:28 Comment: And Luke Shaw carved out another opportunity, Rooney's up well.\n8:32 Comment: He's coming rather back across the face of the goal.\n8:34 Comment: And it's still a...\n8:37 Comment: still a thing that his teammates will be throwing around to Herrera.\n8:41 Comment: Making sure Swansea weren't able to get the ball forward quickly.\n8:44 Comment: Yeah, his manager too, but another good run from Luke Shaw on this side.\n8:52 Comment: Nice dink to the far post.\n8:57 Comment: He won here, actually, his last away game for Southampton was a...\n9:4 Comment: a one-nil win.\n9:15 Comment: Ayew.\n9:17 Comment: Here's Sigurdsson.\n9:18 Comment: Gomez.\n9:20 Comment: Shelby.\n9:21 Comment: Nearly through the middle for Routledge, he'd come in from the opposite flank.\n9:26 Comment: De Puy.\n9:28 Comment: Schweinsteiger.\n9:31 Comment: Rooney holding off Fernandes and working it out to...\n9:36 Comment: Matip.\n9:49 Comment: De Puy has got plenty of place.\n9:52 Comment: And Martin Atkinson.\n9:53 Comment: And there was a bit of pushing and shoving going on.\n9:55 Comment: It looked as

Comment: tremendous possibilities in the last half an hour.\n15:24 Comment: Well...\n15:25 Comment: a change of formation...\n15:27 Comment: and a change of fortune here.\n15:30 Comment: Ashley Williams the skipper...\n15:31 Comment: getting him on the front foot pretty quickly.\n15:33 Comment: Look how much space he's got out here.\n15:35 Comment: He can have the space...\n15:36 Comment: but he don't always use it properly.\n15:39 Comment: He's in...\n15:40 Comment: well there's a lot of room for...\n15:42 Comment: Andre Ayou...\n15:43 Comment: to drift into here...\n15:45 Comment: but having said that he really just took it away well.\n15:47 Comment: He really does.\n15:50 Comment: It's a lovely pick out from Sigurdsson.\n15:56 Comment: Well could history repeat itself?\n15:58 Comment: He wasn't a Swansea player back in February...\n16:0 Comment: when they came from 1-0 down to win 2-1 against Manchester United.\n16:5 Comment: He's set up all sorts of possibilities for that to be repeated here.\n16:10 Comment: It's a lovely pick out from Sigurdsson.\n16:12 Comment: He's set up all sorts of possibilities for that to be repeated here.\n16:40 Comment: A little bit of space

Shelby.\n17:28 Comment: Well it was simmering in the first half.\n17:30 Comment: It really has now.\n17:32 Comment: Started to boil nicely for the neutral.\n17:36 Comment: And certainly for the new arrival this season for Swansea City.\n17:39 Comment: They haven't needed much time at all to settle.\n17:41 Comment: We saw him at Stamford Bridge on the opening round.\n17:43 Comment: Gary Knight, Alan was telling me before the game,\n17:45 Comment: he said the problem for Ayou is they expect him to score in every game now.\n17:48 Comment: Well he's scored in this one.\n17:52 Comment: Well he's set pretty high standards.\n18:2 Comment: Schneiderlin.\n18:4 Comment: And we have to remind you that's the first goal Manchester United have conceded\n18:8 Comment: in the Premier League this season.\n18:10 Comment: First time Romero's been beaten in his Manchester United league career.\n18:16 Comment: So that 18 years of\n18:19 Comment: getting fourth shutout in a row,\n18:22 Comment: 18 years since it last happened, it's going to go on longer than this season.\n18:38 Comment: Blind.\n18:42 Comment: Smalling.\n18:48 Comment: He's offside, it's a lovely touch from\n18:51 Comment: Patrick Timbergomes.\n18:52 Comment: Sigurdsson on the right hand side now, beginning to enjoy himself.\n18:56 Comment: He's got a bit of a run in the back.\n19:10 Comment: Blinding.\n19:12 Comment: But a very good chance from Sigurdsson again.\n19:14 Comment: Blinding.\n19:16 Comment: But a very good chance from Sigurdsson again.\n19:22 Comment: The great season goal for Sigurdsson last time with goals and assists.\n19:27 Comment: Of course he scored the winner\n19:28 Comment: up at Old Trafford on the opening day of last season.\n19:35 Comment: Shaw.\n19:42 Comment: The pie. Shaw.\n19:45 Comment: And inside Norton are still going.\n19:49 Comment: Point break to Matta.\n19:51 Comment: Good anticipation, determined work to get the ball from Sneijder.\n19:54 Comment: And by the pie headed out by Williams.\n19:58 Comment: Norton.\n19:59 Comment: Key.\n20:5 Comment: Shelby.\n20:6 Comment: A great ball for Sigurdsson.\n20:8 Comment: Some new passes being zipped around by Swansea.\n20:12 Comment: What about that one from Ayoub to Gomez?\n20:15 Comment: They lead Manchester United.\n20:17 Comment: They've turned it around as they did in February.\n20:20 Comment: And Gomez again is in on the axe.\n20:25 Comment: The goal again, striker.\n20:28 Comment: Puts it past Romero and sends the Liberty Stadium fans\n20:32 Comment: into absolute delight.\n20:35 Comment: Well, it's a majestic pass from Andre Ayoub.\n20:39 Comment: It really is from this right-hand side to pick out what is now his striker.\n20:44 Comment: And if Benzie's done well, Gomez doesn't get a lot on it.\n20:48 Comment: But Romero, Sergio Romero, well he might bury his head in the turf\n20:54 Comment: for letting that one slip under his body.\n20:57 Comment: What a lovely pass to set it up.\n21:4 Comment: The Panther strikes again.\n21:25 Comment: Shockwaves.\n21:27 Comment: Manchester United on the receiving end of them.\n21:30 Comment: Four minutes and nine seconds between the two goals.\n21:34 Comment: First Ayoub, then Gomez.\n21:38 Comment: One-nil down has become two-one up.\n22:1 Comment: That's four.\n22:3 Comment: That piles up now, Swansea.\n22:6 Comment: Manchester United just trying to come to terms with the situation and reorganise.\n22:15 Comment: A bit of movement, Ashley Young about to come on for the visitors.\n22:22 Comment: Over 90 years since a Swansea player scored in the first four league games of the season.\n22:27 Comment: Harry Deacon.\n22:30 Comment: Back in 1923, Michael Carrick and Ashley Young, as you see, being summoned.\n22:38 Comment: Trying to help turn this around.\n22:42 Comment: Manchester United are footing on a comeback trial.\n22:47 Comment: This is where their lack of options up front can really hurt them.\n22:50 Comment: Adrian Hernandez on the bench but he really just seemed to be heading out of the club.\n22:54 Comment: Go on, go on!\n23:0 Comment: They've got Marouane Fellaini, who I haven't mentioned, of course, he's available for the first time this season.\n23:5 Comment: Went to three-game domestic band the first time in the Premier League.\n23:8 Comment: Of course, he scored a very important goal against Bruges.\n23:13 Comment: In the first leg of the Champions League play-off round.\n23:16 Comment: Home leg.\n23:25 Comment: Schneiderlin.\n23:28 Comment: Shaw.\n23:36 Comment: Schneiderlin.\n23:46 Comment: Rooney.\n23:49 Comment: Squeeze it through to Ander Herrera.\n23:52 Comment: It's too long for Rooney and De Pa.\n23:54 Comment: Well, they haven't been cavalier, they've been organised and they got the lead.\n23:58 Comment: Now Manchester United have to play more expansively.\n24:5 Comment: The goal scorer, Juan Mata, is coming off.\n24:12 Comment: That means Ashley Young will go out on that right-hand side.\n24:22 Comment: Reinhardt's come across. He is not coming off. Schneiderlin is.\n24:28 Comment: A potential controlling influence of Michael Carrick.\n24:36 Comment: Yeah, a few switches to be made here.\n24:38 Comment: Ashley Young, no, I think he's going to line up on that right-hand side.\n24:42 Comment: Try and give his team a bit more of a cutting edge.\n24:44 Comment: Somebody that can beat a man swinging across.\n24:47 Comment: Different to Juan Mata.\n24:51 Comment: Still more than 20 minutes to go.\n25:4 Comment: Blint.\n25:9 Comment: Something with this stern defence of Manchester United,\n25:13 Comment: it's developed a soft centre.\n25:17 Comment: Shaw.\n25:21 Comment: GARY GILLESPIE\n25:25 Comment: It's Feinsteiger.\n25:31 Comment: Damien.\n25:34 Comment: Pogba.\n25:35 Comment: Good cross for the ball.\n25:38 Comment: Needs a couple of goes at this, though.\n25:41 Comment: And a second one.\n25:45 Comment: It's within the reach of Lukasz Fabianski.\n25:51 Comment: GARY GILLESPIE\n25:55 Comment: Nearly, yeah.\n25:57 Comment: We'll be after a nice quiet five minutes or so now, Swansea.\n26:1 Comment: Just to consolidate this lead.\n26:6 Comment: Dummies.\n26:12 Comment: Nicely done by Kee.\n26:13 Comment: GARY GILLESPIE\n26:16 Comment: Ayoub, who's really enjoyed himself,\n26:18 Comment: and against Manchester United before in his Marseille days.\n26:23 Comment: GARY GILLESPIE\n26:30 Comment: Now, he might just try and get one or two pointers across.\n26:33 Comment: GARY GILLESPIE\n26:39 Comment: He's not going to take anything for granted down on that Swansea bench, though.\n26:46 Comment: Blint.\n26:48 Comment: This 2-1 scoreline.\n26:51 Comment: It's going to occur again.\n26:57 Comment: Feinsteiger.\n26:59 Comment: Young.\n27:0 Comment: All red shirts in the box now.\n27:4 Comment: GARY GILLESPIE\n27:6 Comment: Herrera took that well.\n27:8 Comment: Shaw.\n27:13 Comment: GARY GILLESPIE\n27:14 Comment: He's going to get it towards Wimmy, headed up by Williams.\n27:16 Comment: Yeah, them not too much to aim at, in terms of height,\n27:18 Comment: when they get into those crossing positions.\n27:24 Comment: Shaw able to win it back.\n27:28 Comment: Blint.\n27:29 Comment: Not.\n27:31 Comment: Can't afford to let him near.\n27:34 Comment: Great purpose that time.\n27:40 Comment: United start again.\n27:41 Comment: Blint.\n27:43 Comment: Feinsteiger.\n27:47 Comment: Not able to intervene.\n27:51 Comment: Shelby.\n27:53 Comment: That's Carrick, there.\n27:55 Comment: He read the direction of Sigurdsson's turn.\n27:59 Comment: He's got it.\n28:6 Comment: And Herrera drops it.\n28:10 Comment: Pressure starting to tell a little bit.\n28:14 Comment: And the team that would have been even at Milner\n28:16 Comment: would have been feeling reasonably pleased with the performance.\n28:20 Comment: One Milner wouldn't have seen a turnaround like this,\n28:22 Comment: except he has got previous on this ground,\n28:26 Comment: against this team.\n28:28 Comment: He's done a good thing down there.\n28:29 Comment: Fellaini would be the obvious one.\n28:31 Comment: He's warming up down the line at the moment.\n28:34 Comment: Just change the complexion of their attacks,\n28:36 Comment: give them something, a different sort of threat,\n28:38 Comment: a more physical one.\n28:42 Comment: When's he going to take off, though, to do that?\n28:47 Comment: Herrera, maybe?\n28:48 Comment: Yeah.\n28:53 Comment: Here's Young.\n28:57 Comment: That's a lovely ball.\n28:59 Comment: De Puy had the chance to attack.\n29:3 Comment: Carl Norton,\n29:4 Comment: a bit of a pat on the back from his teammates,\n29:6 Comment: but doing enough to put Memphis De Puy off.\n29:11 Comment: It's not going to be long, I don't think.\n29:21 Comment: Gomez, chest it down to Ayo.\n29:25 Comment: Kalk, that's a good centre, now Key.\n29:39 Comment: Smalling,\n29:41 Comment: taken back by Fernandez.\n29:47 Comment: Drops here for Ander Herrera.\n29:52 Comment: Young.\n30:2 Comment: Herrera again.\n30:7 Comment: It was the other scorer, remember,\n30:9 Comment: in Bruges, and went in with a Rooney hat-trick.\n30:14 Comment: And making sure that\n30:16 Comment: actually, Young across doesn't get in the\n30:18 Comment: path of Rooney.\n30:20 Comment: There might be a few more of those in the last 15 minutes or so.\n30:25 Comment: And it doesn't help.\n30:27 Comment: A foul throw.\n30:45 Comment: So it is going to be a return to the Barclays Premier League\n30:48 Comment: from Marouane Fellaini.\n30:50 Comment: This last appearance on the last day of last season,\n30:52 Comment: a pole,\n30:53 Comment: in good weather, ignominious.\n30:54 Comment: Here it is, a swap for Herrera.\n30:59 Comment: There'll be even more crosses coming in now.\n31:3 Comment: Well, at least Manchester United will hope so.\n31:8 Comment: Well, it makes sense with Ashley Young on that right-hand side.\n31:12 Comment: He needs a target, and Fellaini's a pretty big one.\n31:16 Comment: That, I think, tells you all you need to know about Javier Hernandez.\n31:20 Comment: Yes.\n31:21 Comment: He's got a decent scoring record, incidentally, against Swansea.\n31:23 Comment: He was here as a substitute,\n31:25 Comment: but it seems just to make up the numbers.\n31:28 Comment: Move to Brian Leverkusen, being mooted.\n31:34 Comment: Nicely worked by Kee.\n31:38 Comment: Well, it's a bit of a shame,\n31:40 Comment: because it's a bit of a shame that\n31:42 Comment: nicely worked by Kee.\n31:45 Comment: Oh, it was a crossing possibility for Neil Taylor.\n31:49 Comment: The government needs to be told that he didn't quite get it right.\n31:52 Comment: Andre Ayew was in the middle of the box,\n31:54 Comment: totally unmarked there, screaming for the ball.\n32:2 Comment: Short.\n32:3 Comment: Now they'll look long.\n32:4 Comment: Here's a Fellaini ball for you.\n32:12 Comment: Williams.\n32:14 Comment: Sigurdsson.\n32:15 Comment: Gamis alternates between looking really dangerous\n32:19 Comment: and loping back from an offside position.\n32:21 Comment: He's having a little bleed at the end, he's sucking a bit.\n32:33 Comment: Here is Fellaini able to get it down.\n32:37 Comment: And Hughes-Young.\n32:40 Comment: And runs at Taylor.\n32:42 Comment: Snagged away by Williams, who you feel has got a lot of important defending to do before.\n32:47 Comment: He thus settles on this one.\n32:53 Comment: Lindt.\n32:55 Comment: Shaw.\n32:58 Comment: Away from Ayew.\n33:1 Comment: Rooney.\n33:2 Comment: Plenty to the right, as you can see, for Manchester United.\n33:6 Comment: Young.\n33:8 Comment: One entrusted to be the supply line.\n33:11 Comment: He thought it was coming his way, Fabianski knew it was.\n33:15 Comment: They've got to be careful, Swansea, on that far side.\n33:18 Comment: They're a bit lopsided, Chalmers having to get out there,\n33:21 Comment: but he naturally took in a little bit.\n33:26 Comment: They can't afford Neil Taylor being exposed to a two against one.\n33:33 Comment: Fabianski.\n33:35 Comment: And Hurrid when Fellaini made a movement towards him.\n33:38 Comment: Ayew.\n33:40 Comment: Trying to drop that for Gomes.\n33:44 Comment: A lot of doom and gloom when Wilfrid Bonny was sold to Manchester City\n33:49 Comment: in the winter transfer window.\n33:53 Comment: Gomes rose to the challenge.\n34:0 Comment: Young.\n34:4 Comment: Carrick, the little boy.\n34:8 Comment: That will be a free kick, will it?\n34:10 Comment: No, that just says no.\n34:11 Comment: Norton walked it by, taken down by Shelby.\n34:14 Comment: Taylor's on the run.\n34:16 Comment: Coming from left back, if Gomes can see him.\n34:18 Comment: Not so easy to see from where Gomes is, as it was to see from up here.\n34:27 Comment: Kaiser keep it from the Swansea bench.\n34:34 Comment: United to make it difficult for first key and then court.\n34:38 Comment: Here is work from Jack Court.\n34:40 Comment: Ayew is onside.\n34:42 Comment: Manchester United are all over the place at the moment.\n34:44 Comment: Big break for the flag, why not?\n34:46 Comment: Because Shelby was trying to hold his position there\n34:49 Comment: and must have been close to doing that.\n34:52 Comment: Yeah, I think they were more occupied with claiming the original upside.\n34:55 Comment: He's been booked for kicking the ball away.\n35:1 Comment: Look at this, Alan.\n35:3 Comment: He just stopped Erne Damian, he's got to come inside to cover two players,\n35:6 Comment: leaving Shelby all on his own.\n35:17 Comment: Rafa Timbi Gomes, who as you were saying, did look weary.\n35:25 Comment: Gives way to another of the summer signings.\n35:30 Comment: Portuguese international, but not until after he's kept his goal again run going.\n35:36 Comment: Rafa Timbi Gomes.\n35:49 Comment: Fernandes.\n35:55 Comment: Hede, played in the World Cup for Portugal last year in Brazil.\n36:7 Comment: De Puy.\n36:9 Comment: Blocked off by Norton.\n36:22 Comment: They have the first real dead ball situation with Fellaini on the pitch,\n36:27 Comment: but they don't go directly towards him.\n36:29 Comment: Actually when he's trying to get a higher line for Swansea,\n36:32 Comment: Fellaini offside, he is offside.\n36:35 Comment: It's going well by the skipper and his teammates.\n36:39 Comment: Yeah, Wayne Rooney saying, why on earth didn't you swing it in first time?\n36:43 Comment: He's got a point.\n37:0 Comment: Here from Sky Sports, Grand Slam Tennis, the US Open, starts tomorrow 4pm.\n37:7 Comment: Sky Sports 1.\n37:17 Comment: Hede, half-smalling.\n37:19 Comment: Had to go it alone really.\n37:21 Comment: Breaks for Andre Ayoub.\n37:29 Comment: Norton.\n37:35 Comment: Key.\n37:38 Comment: De Puy got in a defensive foot.\n37:41 Comment: A little run for Hede.\n37:45 Comment: Again Gary Monk shouting, keep the ball.\n37:47 Comment: Wanting them to go down the side, but when they went into the middle,\n37:50 Comment: they went into traffic.\n37:51 Comment: Williams has appointed himself the enforcer on Fellaini.\n38:1 Comment: Here's Shelby.\n38:11 Comment: Fellaini comes away.\n38:13 Comment: Rooney deep.\n38:14 Comment: De Puy is through the middle.\n38:16 Comment: Shaw again up in support, he's made so many runs today.\n38:20 Comment: And that's what you tend to do when you've got a big man on.\n38:25 Comment: Ashton Schweinsteiger knows that it has to be better than that.\n38:35 Comment: Fellaini wondering a little bit how he's going to do it.\n38:38 Comment: He's got a little bit of a run.\n38:43 Comment: Fellaini wondering a little bit how it slipped away.\n38:47 Comment: They have been failing some at Alerton Manchester United,\n38:51 Comment: but we have to

    "summary": "Under a drizzly sky at the Liberty Stadium, the fixture between Swansea City and Manchester United unfolded in a manner that kept fans on the edge of their seats from the first whistle to the last. The pristine condition of the pitch set the stage for what would become an enthralling encounter, drenched in suspense and covered in patches of brilliant football.\n\nRight from kick-off, Manchester United showcased their intent. Wayne Rooney, always lively in the forward line, sought out Juan Mata, who combined effectively with his teammates to try and find an early breakthrough. As early as the second minute, the visiting fans were roaring in encouragement, sensing an early goal might be on the cards.\n\nMorgan Schneiderlin took control in the midfield, eager to carve opportunities, only for Jonjo Shelvey of Swansea to block a driven shot. Swansea seemed momentarily penned into their own penalty area, but Andre Ayew's clearance and Chris Smalling's assertive interception shifted the momentum.\n\nManchester United's persistent pressure earned them a free kick just outside the box when Kyle Naughton tripped an advancing player. The opportunity felt promising, with potential to warm Lukasz Fabianski's gloves, but despite the fans' chants and anticipation, the free kick was deftly saved by the Swansea keeper. A flurry of subsequent attacks and counter-attacks followed, with neither side managing to break the deadlock as the first ten minutes passed.\n\nAmidst the flowing action, news filtered through that Kevin De Bruyne had officially signed for Manchester City, sending ripples through the footballing world.

Shelvey continued to be a knight in shining armor, managing midfield distributions and shielding his backline. Despite tough tackles, particularly Granada from Smalling that saw Fernandez topple over, Swansea didn‚Äôt back down.\n\nAround the 24th minute, the semblance of a pattern emerged. Swansea was enforcing some fluid formations, transitioning quickly from defense to attack but lacked the essential creativity in front of goal.

Few chances edged closer like Sigurdsson‚Äôs shot resulting from a clever Shelvey‚Äôs free kick slipped past, though Sigurdsson torsioned his body for the attempt.\n\nThen, nearing the 40th minute mark, it was clear Manchester United still had the edge. Shaw's constant overlaps along the left vertex created yard of space but chances either parried by keeper or fell short. Shelby for Swansea, took the ball off Romero‚Äôs poor clearance with a lively crowd, missed centering on target adding dynamism breaking stasis.\n\nAs the first half clock ticked closer to a breather, small openings rapidly closed, most often by Smalling‚Äôs interceptive measures or Schweinsteiger‚Äôs timely inventions. It gave Manchester United confidence, having limited Swansea‚Äôs tangible goal attempts, signaled stronger post-break prospects.\n\nWhen the second half commenced, Manchester United sought to replicate their dominant start. The tempo was evident instantly, gaining an advantageous position, trying to maintain rhythm, pushing Swansea back-foot. A key moment arrived soon after when Memphis Depay swung in a cross reaching Juan Mata, who benefitted an inch-perfectly collected pass in rapid maneuver.\n\nThe breakthrough materialized as Juan Mata scored a solitary goal nearing 50th appearance highlight, converting Shaw‚Äôs industrious approach. Manchester United forged ahead, revitalizing its energy level both players and supporters rejuvenated heading by one-goal cushion.\n\nSwansea, however, showcased resilience synonymous to their spirit. Ayew, refreshing insertion besides Gomez pinpointed Sigurdsson who seized key distributions threatening repeatedly. Aid with hard-pressing from Cork kept Swansea compact translating to forward surges.\n\nIn swift counter-articulation, Ayew subduing Shaw tactically vetted via tight marking opened scoring inconsistent chance into nuanced perfect angle header. Swansea revitalized drew level, shocking Old Trafford follower‚Äôs ecstasy broadcasting loud optimistic demeanor.\n\nBuoyed instantaneously spirits escalated Liberty crowd engineered subsequent probing initiative.
