already see that it is direct football, that Palace has little thought about it, take advantage of all the\n2:21 Comment: spaces that Manchester City is leaving between the lines at the start of the match, with\n2:26 Comment: the team was quite scattered and not very well placed and then that direct style, that\n2:35 Comment: verticality of the local team.\n2:37 Comment: Let's see the first

Yes, and it's good because it was a ball that was poisoned and if I tried to block it I would probably\n3:16 Comment: It could cause a problem for him, that ball also had a lot of spin, I think Joe Hart\n3:20 Comment: He is conservative but does the right thing due to the spin of the ball.\n3:24 Comment: Adam Patio's team takes off in a rush.\n3:27 Comment: And also when this team plays with this determination it is very difficult to stop because\n3:32 Comment: Physically it is a very powerful team.\n3:33 Comment: Now you see the corner for Palace, the Eagle fans delighted, ball to the second, post,\n3:40 Comment: There was an option to finish but it was now impossible for Papé, suague, another authentic express train\n3:45 Comment: that has already gone out of fashion, a true high-speed train, the Senegalese side.\n3:50 Comment: City tries to play there but the ball lasts very little for Pellegrini's men, return\n3:55 Comment: Compagni has to go ahead and impose its quality there.\n4:0 Comment: Very good Compagni, especially how cold-blooded he is to cut back in that position, but look\n4:4 Comment: the Palace, the team was overexcited, recovering the ball and

eleven,\n4:45 Comment: There has been talk all week since the international commitments ended in\n4:51 Comment: those who, by the way, Cabas could not finish the match against Portugal, had to be substituted\n4:56 Comment: and it was said that Cabas was injured and in the end Cabas is in the eleven, I guess\n5:0 Comment: that it will be somewhat affected because it is difficult to go from being short to being tall like this at night\n5:7 Comment: In the morning, I say that 100% he shouldn't be there but he is the right eye of his coach,\n5:14 Comment: He already had him at Newcastle, he has brought him to Crystal Palace, a transfer record for\n5:18 Comment: the history of the club, Cabas is a great player and today he is in the starting eleven.\n5:24 Comment: Manchester City are trying now, ball for Wilfred Boni that starts, it was\n5:29 Comment: a two against three, there is already a defensive balance for the figs and there is a lack of the former\n5:35 Comment: Vitesse and

second, we miss something important, I'm sure the teacher has already taken note.\n6:7 Comment: English director.\n6:8 Comment: It doesn't happen again, it's a very high-tempo game at the moment in which the ball\n6:13 Comment: does not stop arriving from one area to another and where without clamorous occasions but they are\n6:20 Comment: frequently producing goal situations.\n6:23 Comment: Crystal Palace has come out in a rush, dominating, managing the match, but City is growing\n6:30 Comment: That's why he is the leader of the Premier.\n6:31 Comment: What a mistake there in that loss of mangana, Volasi can take advantage of it there.\n6:34 Comment: Volasi in the shot, Johan has stopped.\n6:36 Comment: What a stop, down, blocking, another loss of the ball, this very serious one in Manchester\n6:43 Comment: City at the team's exit.\n6:45 Comment: And how few doubts Crystal Palace has, as soon as it recovers it is pure verticality, it is\n6:50 Comment: Pure vertigo the team with Volasi is a real nightmare.\n6:55 Comment: There we have not been able to see if there was any other better option, this is by the way repeated\n7:1 Comment: the action that Israel Zador ate, a good serve with a lot of intention from Yaya Toure.\n7:9 Comment: There Manchester City is trying with Nasri to sneak in offering the area,\n7:14 Comment: Scott Dunn ends up taking it as best he could, ball on the throw-in, game played by Tuatu\n7:20 Comment: from power to power.\n7:21 Comment: The match has no midfield, it is a real vertigo on the part of both teams.\n7:29 Comment: There's that Nasri ball.\n7:36 Comment: And to play it there with Fernandinho, Yaya Toure, ball opened by Bakari Saña, he is going to try\n7:43 Comment: there from the sideline, Nasri, it was Jesús Navas, there a throw-in for Manchester City.\n7:49 Comment: In the end it is Zaha who is on the left.\n7:53 Comment: Volasi is on point as the realization offered us, I was right that Volasi was going\n7:59 Comment: to play up front, although well, he can also play as a second striker, he can\n8:3 Comment: play on either side.\n8:4 Comment: He is a player who, above all, has speed and any of those positions.\n8:9 Comment: It suits him well for his type of game.\n8:13 Comment: The game has started at full speed in this Sheppard Park.\n8:17 Comment: With a Crystal Palace that wants to show why it is second in the table and that it can\n8:24 Comment: today the best team in the Premier League.\n8:33 Comment: Short ball there for Martin Kelly to try, in anticipation of Kolarov, returns\n8:38 Comment: to play Kelly in the back.\n8:40 Comment: The ball is from Scott Dunn, connecting with Norwegian veteran Brett Hageland.\n8:45 Comment: Life insurance there for Lampardio, an already very expert player for Crystal Palace\n8:51 Comment: who surely did not expect to start the season like this, but he is marveling in his\n8:55 Comment: best start since the 2006-2007 season when they also got nine points\n9:1 Comment: in the first four days.\n9:4 Comment: They have also achieved five victories in the last league games and that makes them\n9:9 Comment: The Palace is beginning to respect him a lot.\n9:12 Comment: Of course, because I also already say that all the virtues he is showing are not fruit\n9:18 Comment: of chance.\n9:20 Comment: Everything good that this team does, how aggressive it is and how fast it plays every time\n9:25 Comment: steals the ball, all of that is very difficult to defend, especially against such powerful players.\n9:32 Comment: We are not just talking about fast players like Navas or players with special\n9:39 Comment: technical quality like Agüero.\n9:41 Comment: They are players of a brutal physical level, which is why every time the team shows\n9:46 Comment: so aggressive in the pressure and so vertical in the exit, it is difficult to stop.\n9:52 Comment: Then what costs him a little more is attacking positionally, but hey, for that\n9:55 Comment: Johan Cavalls is there to get the ball played like now.\n9:58 Comment: The cut there, problems for Bakari, Sagnat and Wilfried Saha missing in that action at full speed.\n10:6 Comment: Yes, we already said that he is on the left wing and he is asking for them all too.\n10:10 Comment: There in the face.\n10:13 Comment: And Sagnat has no choice but to commit a foul.\n10:16 Comment: Ten minutes into the game in this Sejas Park stadium, with Crystal Palace trying\n10:21 Comment: from face to face to the leader of the Premier League.\n10:24 Comment: Arriving with opportunities, especially those two that Yannick Bolasi, the player\n10:28 Comment: Congolese, who is currently the best stiletto in the team led by Alan Partiu.\n10:35 Comment: There he is, five Eagles men in the area, he tried to shoot but he had it\n10:39 Comment: complicated there.\n10:41 Comment: Bakari served, loose ball for Swagé.\n10:44 Comment: Palace's left side shot deflected.\n10:47 Comment: How is Partiu's team doing and how is the Premier League leader suffering?\n10:52 Comment: Yes, he didn't execute well, I think that lateral foul.\n10:56 Comment: The ball hitting was too flat.\n10:59 Comment: There were no options for the finishers, but the rebound did go well.\n11:3 Comment: But on the rebound the ball did fall to Swagé and he didn't think twice.\n11:8 Comment: Great start to the match for Palace.\n11:11 Comment: Three times already for the Eagles, only one for the Edisons.\n11:16 Comment: How is the celestial team suffering in this clash on the fifth day of the Premier?\n11:22 Comment: We were talking about how they haven't conceded goals yet, but they are seeing how it comes again and again.\n11:28 Comment: Palace in this match and Hart is clearly suffering at the start of the match.\n11:40 Comment: There is Polazzi, we already said, today playing more inside.\n11:44 Comment: It's not new at all, but sometimes he plays on the left, instead of Zaha,\n11:50 Comment: the one we are seeing today, even on the right, where today we are seeing Saco.\n11:55 Comment: Those four footballers, Zaha, Punxa, Saco and Polazzi, are very interchangeable.\n12:2 Comment: They are of a very similar pattern, very fast, very physical.\n12:6 Comment: With a lot of mobility, he gives the ball, which rebounds at the end to Wiffre, Zaha.\n12:11 Comment: Mobility, speed, power, they appear anywhere on the field and mess you up.\n12:16 Comment: What they play is almost a 4-2-4, because they have the line of four in front,\n12:20 Comment: Kabash, who does more constructive work, with MacArthur, who is more destructive,\n12:23 Comment: and then these four that I already mentioned have a very similar pattern and that they all play at high speed.\n12:31 Comment: The cut of Brett Hangeland, who comes to Crystal Palace.\n12:35 Comment: It seems like the leader and on the other hand it seems like a modest team, although Manchester City is second in the table,\n12:42 Comment: that is weathering the storm as best it can, there is a fault, says Mike Jones,\n12:46 Comment: given the aggressiveness, speed and all the intensity that Adam Partio's team is putting in.\n12:52 Comment: And now we come against Chelsea, as Palace cornered the current Premier League champion,\n12:59 Comment: and today he is doing the same with Manchester City.\n13:2 Comment: A brave way to play football.\n13:5 Comment: That usual gesture from Alan Partio, who always seems very angry in the band,\n13:10 Comment: Sometimes I suppose he is, he really is, but he never stops transmitting intensity to his players.\n13:18 Comment: City has to try to take the game to their own ground in any way possible,\n13:23 Comment: try to ensure that what predominates and prevails is quality,\n13:28 Comment: although today obviously without Silva, it costs him much more, because Silva is the galvanizer of this team.\n13:36 Comment: Malva who plays there, Yaya Toure in short, with Colaros, Servio's cut,\n13:42 Comment: Delaying that ball Yaya Toure, with Fernandinho problems, manages to unload for Sergio Agüero.\n13:48 Comment: Wifred Boni has the ball there on the border, he opens for Navas, the Spaniard is going to face,\n13:54 Comment: short for Agüero, City is stuck there, Kun loses it.\n13:58 Comment: Yes, Kun takes advantage of the fact that today they play with two forwards and that Boni is the center forward\n14:4 Comment: to come a lot to receive between the lines.\n14:7 Comment: Navas is going to look for the center there, the ball belongs to Yaya Toure,\n14:13 Comment: Cari Sañar goes, sending it to the area, Hángela cuts it off at the near post,\n14:17 Comment: the ball directly to the side.\n14:27 Comment: Nice game that the second and the leader of this Premier League are offering us,\n14:33 Comment: Crystal Palace, who started the season by winning away to Norwich,\n14:37 Comment: 1-3, then lost here at Sejas Park, 1-2 against Arsenal,\n14:42 Comment: and later two consecutive victories, against Aston Villa 2-1,\n14:47 Comment: and against Chelsea on the last matchday, 1-2 at Stafford Bridge.\n14:51 Comment: Well, victory is a defeat for the Londoners, and against Manchester City,\n14:56 Comment: and against Manchester City, all victories.\n14:59 Comment: 4-4, West Brom 0-3, then 3-0 against Chelsea on the second day,\n15:6 Comment: the 0-2 at Woodinson Park against Everton, and finally that 2-0 against Watford,\n15:11 Comment: in the fourth before the break for the qualifying matches for the Euro 2016 in France.\n15:18 Comment: Yaya Toure playing there, at short for Wilfred Boni,\n15:22 Comment: opening there for Nassen Rui, raises his head to the Frenchman,\n15:26 Comment: sending it to the front of the area, Yaya Toure recycles that ball, starting over for City.\n15:32 Comment: Toure short for Navas, Andaluz puts it there, throw-in there.\n15:37 Comment: I think this is what is best for Manchester City,\n15:40 Comment: Of course you take risks by having so many people in front of the ball,\n15:44 Comment: that when a loss occurs they can catch you against,\n15:48 Comment: but the team has the ball and tries to move it from one side to the other,\n15:53 Comment: that forces Crystal Palace to tilt, seems to me the best recipe,\n15:58 Comment: taking into account its technical superiority over the rival.\n16:1 Comment: Nassen Rui, short there for Agüero,\n16:5 Comment: Kun tries there, but very well covered in that action,\n16:10 Comment: by James McArthur, the Scotsman.\n16:13 Comment: Playing short Agüero for Nassen Rui,\n16:16 Comment: the ball is from Mangala.\n16:21 Comment: Again Nassen Rui,\n16:24 Comment: The losses, as you said Gabi, for City are of great importance,\n16:28 Comment: but he still has enough artillery on the field and on the bench Pellegrini\n16:32 Comment: to win today's game.\n16:34 Comment: Yes, and he also has De Bruyne on the bench,\n16:37 Comment: We are all already saying what depth of wardrobe Manchester City has,\n16:41 Comment: Today is one of those days in which the depth of the closet is shown,\n16:44 Comment: but what happens is that I believe that in such a complicated match,\n16:47 Comment: In a narrower field, with an opponent so aggressive and so physical,\n16:52 Comment: I think that Manuel Pellegrini did not want to give De Bruyne his debut,\n16:55 Comment: will probably make his debut the same in the second part,\n16:59 Comment: We'll see if there is a need or not,\n17:1 Comment: but probably for a game like this he has preferred Nasri's experience in the starting eleven.\n17:7 Comment: Be careful there with Palace, ball for them to try,\n17:10 Comment: with many problems Bolasi, the shipment with that loose ferric,\n17:14 Comment: inside the area, for Johan Cavaz to try,\n17:18 Comment: Internacional lost it, City wanted to go out there,\n17:21 Comment: the very hard foul on Agüero, yellow card for Scott Dan,\n17:26 Comment: first yellow of the game.\n17:28 Comment: We have not been able to see the lack,\n17:33 Comment: The way Agüero hurts doesn't look good,\n17:36 Comment: what Bolasi power again,\n17:38 Comment: Bolasi that in addition to speed, is that it puts your body,\n17:42 Comment: what a kick, what a tremendous kick, yellow, very fair for Dan,\n17:48 Comment: for an Agüero who was leaving,\n17:50 Comment: and here we have the previous action,\n17:52 Comment: We have not seen the origin, which is another action by Bolasi,\n17:55 Comment: having gained the back of the defense,\n17:58 Comment: and also once it does,\n18:0 Comment: It is almost impossible to take the ball away from him because his body gets in your way,\n18:4 Comment: and he is so physically powerful,\n18:6 Comment: which is really complicated,\n18:8 Comment: I hope it's nothing,\n18:11 Comment: That way of hurting doesn't look good at all,\n18:14 Comment: But I hope Agüero stays scared.\n18:17 Comment: The foul on Internacional with the albiceleste,\n18:20 Comment: serious gesture of concern in Manuel Pellegrini,\n18:23 Comment: the Eidisons coach in his third season,\n18:26 Comment: in charge of Manchester City,\n18:29 Comment: Last season they fell against the power of Chelsea,\n18:33 Comment: by José Mourinho,\n18:34 Comment: but the current one has started strongly,\n18:37 Comment: the Manchester team,\n18:39 Comment: and what a very hard miss from Dan,\n18:41 Comment: with that kick on Kun Agüero,\n18:43 Comment: I wanted to stop him at any cost.\n18:46 Comment: Expedient there, the Palace centre-back, 28 years old,\n18:50 Comment: first yellow card today.\n18:54 Comment: The Palace that is surprising locals and strangers,\n18:57 Comment: because few could expect this performance,\n19:0 Comment: of a team that is always in the middle of the ball,\n19:3 Comment: or even further down than mid-table.\n19:6 Comment: Yes, but we already mentioned that last season,\n19:9 Comment: upon arriving in Lampardio,\n19:12 Comment: The team had a very obvious, very clear reaction,\n19:16 Comment: a very clear improvement,\n19:20 Comment: and this is simply continuity,\n19:23 Comment: Well, maybe there is a penalty from Fernandinho,\n19:26 Comment: maybe there will be a penalty from Fernandinho,\n19:28 Comment: and that's why he shows it to us again and again,\n19:30 Comment: here, there,\n19:32 Comment: It is true that there is an exaggeration on the part of Kaváz,\n19:36 Comment: but there is a trip too.\n19:40 Comment: It is always difficult to know, for the viewer,\n19:43 Comment: whether certain contact is enough or not,\n19:47 Comment: the trip exists,\n19:49 Comment: then Kaváz already exaggerates the best,\n19:51 Comment: That's where the referee preferred not to whistle,\n19:54 Comment: but come on, the trip exists.\n20:2 Comment: 20 minutes into the game at Secas Park,\n20:5 Comment: with that initial goalless draw on matchday five of the Premier League,\n20:8 Comment: As always, the best football in the world here on Movistar Plus,\n20:11 Comment: the home of football.\n20:13 Comment: We are seeing the leader of the Premier and the surprising second,\n20:16 Comment: but if it continues like this, it will become less so every day.\n20:19 Comment: It will no longer be a surprise to see Lampardio's men,\n20:22 Comment: in those privileged positions of a Premier,\n20:25 Comment: that has Everton behind,\n20:29 Comment: who has already played his game today,\n20:30 Comment: against Chelsea,\n20:33 Comment: He's going to try to fly there, if he slipped,\n20:36 Comment: there the Crystal Palace striker,\n20:38 Comment: He puts it there with that good movement,\n20:40 Comment: clear with Pani,\n20:42 Comment: then Leicester City arrived as fourth,\n20:44 Comment: and Swansea fifth, we have eight points.\n20:46 Comment: Divided values ​​are all for Crystal Palace,\n20:49 Comment: It's one of the reasons why the home team is calling the shots too.\n20:54 Comment: As soon as a ball is divided,\n20:57 Comment: there is a clash, a dispute,\n21:0 Comment: and practically everything is for the Palace.\n21:6 Comment: Throw-in there for Martin Kelly,\n21:9 Comment: the public delighted with their team,\n21:11 Comment: today in Sejas Park,\n21:13 Comment: You practically can't believe this start of the season,\n21:16 Comment: but it's totally true,\n21:18 Comment: Your team is doing phenomenal,\n21:20 Comment: MacArthur had it there surrounded by light blue t-shirts,\n21:22 Comment: MacArthur puts his foot in,\n21:24 Comment: danger there with Panchon, there was offside.\n21:26 Comment: Out of play there of the brain, of the creator,\n21:29 Comment: of the architect of Crystal Palace's attacking football.\n21:39 Comment: The City that is still stuck there,\n21:41 Comment: there is hardly any ball circulation,\n21:43 Comment: fluidity between Fernandinho, Yaya Toure,\n21:45 Comment: and then the bands with Navas and Nasri,\n21:48 Comment: and Agüero who continues to hurt, that is the worst.\n21:50 Comment: What a gesture of pain from Agüero,\n21:52 Comment: Let's see if he can score a goal.\n21:53 Comment: It will be tried for a little while,\n21:55 Comment: but he's limping\n21:57 Comment: we will be attentive to him,\n21:59 Comment: because at any moment he is going to make a gesture\n22:1 Comment: I hope that moment of change does not come.\n22:6 Comment: Ball there for Fernandinho,\n22:8 Comment: downloading there for Vincent Compagni,\n22:11 Comment: Sañá, in his second season at Manchester City,\n22:14 Comment: after having performed in the previous ones at Arsenal.\n22:17 Comment: It's going to come to a crossroads,\n22:19 Comment: Javier,\n22:21 Comment: He wants to play and he gets it short,\n22:23 Comment: for Suagué,\n22:25 Comment: Palace has a lot of confidence,\n22:27 Comment: They dare with everything,\n22:29 Comment: even today,\n22:31 Comment: before the leader of the Premier.\n22:33 Comment: Fernandinho leads, between the lines,\n22:35 Comment: for Agüero,\n22:37 Comment: change of rhythm of Kun,\n22:39 Comment: can't continue, it was necessary,\n22:41 Comment: Agüero is still limping there.\n22:43 Comment: There is the gesture we feared,\n22:45 Comment: Agüero cannot continue,\n22:47 Comment: what a pity,\n22:49 Comment: what a pity and what...\n22:51 Comment: very tough stick for Manchester City,\n22:53 Comment: we remember it,\n22:55 Comment: If someone is late for the broadcast,\n22:57 Comment: He is without Silva and without Sterling now,\n22:59 Comment: I guess De Bruyne is going to come in.\n23:1 Comment: Now you won't be able to delay it any longer,\n23:3 Comment: the debut of one of the most expensive players in history,\n23:7 Comment: Manuel Pellegrini,\n23:9 Comment: because Wilfred Boni can remain as a striker\n23:11 Comment: and De Bruyne\n23:13 Comment: stand on the left,\n23:16 Comment: Nardi get deeper inside,\n23:18 Comment: well we'll see,\n23:20 Comment: The one in charge is the engineer.\n23:22 Comment: We will see what option he takes.\n23:25 Comment: We give ideas,\n23:28 Comment: but what a shame,\n23:30 Comment: there was Kun,\n23:32 Comment: Also in that work that he also likes a lot,\n23:34 Comment: second point,\n23:36 Comment: coming a lot to receive,\n23:38 Comment: taking advantage of Boni many times\n23:40 Comment: I set the centrals,\n23:42 Comment: that work that often falls to him\n23:44 Comment: when the team plays 4-2-3-1\n23:46 Comment: and he is the most advanced man,\n23:48 Comment: today Boni was more 9\n23:50 Comment: making very good receptions between the lines\n23:52 Comment: and I think I was enjoying the game,\n23:56 Comment: although he had not had great opportunities,\n23:58 Comment: Kevin De Bruyne is indeed preparing,\n24:0 Comment: The debut cannot be

It is very difficult to eradicate it.\n12:8 Comment: It's not that we're asking for a penalty for any contact, but we also have to allow the striker a little more.\n12:17 Comment: Fouls are called in attack with an ease in football that is scandalous.\n12:26 Comment: Badon from Hageland.

That's the truth.\n13:9 Comment: Let's see if Palace have another stretch of the game in which they impose their physical superiority,\n13:16 Comment: because it is subdued right now.\n13:19 Comment: Submitted to the ball, because City has the ball and City rules.\n13:24 Comment: And City this year is showing an ability to attack.\n13:27 Comment: And City this year is showing an ability to control games\n13:31 Comment: Throughout the position much higher than in previous years.\n13:40 Comment: Lever for Kevin de Bruyne, delaying the ball for Joe Hart.\n13:45 Comment: It has been inactive for quite a few minutes now.\n13:49 Comment: The final stretch of the first part and also now in the second.\n13:52 Comment: Despite the fact that there was a dangerous center from the left.\n13:57 Comment: Yannick Bolasie, Kavash, plays short.\n14:2 Comment: The other organizer of the game at the axis of their core, James McArthur.\n14:6 Comment: Kelly with Dan, the captain of the Eagles.\n14:10 Comment: Long pass over the head, there is no option there for Yannick Bolasie.\n14:15 Comment: Vincent Kompany ends up taking the ball.\n14:18 Comment: Bonnie was fighting, but there is no option to continue.\n14:21 Comment: Crystal Palace finally wins possession.\n14:23 Comment: Quarter of an hour already in the second part.\n14:25 Comment: The second against the leader of this fifth day of the Premier.\n14:29 Comment: What was I going to say to Crystal Palace?\n14:30 Comment: I was going to be in this situation in four games, three wins, one loss.\n14:35 Comment: But yes, they have already broken it, making a great start to the season.\n14:39 Comment: Suagué.\n14:42 Comment: He has her back there so he can go straight ahead.\n14:44 Comment: Bakary Sacco, Kompany's brave clearance.\n14:49 Comment: Let's go to the Belgian.\n14:51 Comment: Trying to make himself firm in defense and also to his counterpart, the other boss.\n14:56 Comment: To the other chief in Crystal Palace's defense, Breguet Hangeland.\n15:5 Comment: In short, Martin Kelly for Kavash to try to triangle.\n15:9 Comment: And the other, the other, the other.\n15:11 Comment: And the other, the other.\n15:13 Comment: In short, Martin Kelly for Kavash to try to triangle.\n15:17 Comment: You will reach Eliakim Mangala crossing.\n15:19 Comment: He sends the ball out of bounds.\n15:22 Comment: Crystal Palace needs to play like this, almost looking for long balls to break down a City team that is much more organized and closer together.\n15:31 Comment: When Palace comes from behind playing, it is very difficult for them to overcome lines and advance.\n15:37 Comment: When he comes out with this type of more vertical ball, it obviously requires great precision, but that is when it gives the greatest sense of danger.\n15:46 Comment: Actually what can be said is that we miss Palace in this second half, while we see that there could have been offside here,\n15:54 Comment: It's just that he's not pressing as high as he did in the first part of the game.\n16:0 Comment: That's what really made Manchester City suffer, right?\n16:3 Comment: Having the players on top of them with great aggression since the referee whistled.\n16:8 Comment: Kavash corner kick, he manages to touch Pani there, Boni ends up clearing it.\n16:13 Comment: Kevin De Bruyne is going to run, he wins the ball, he hits it perfectly with his right hand.\n16:18 Comment: Hold on De Bruyne, perfect.\n16:20 Comment: As they waited for Kolarov's arrival, Manchester City is now deployed.\n16:24 Comment: With the ball from Wilfred Boni for Navas, he is going to double Cari Sañaz and it gives him time.\n16:28 Comment: Navas had to offload back for the boss, Yaya Toure.\n16:31 Comment: Nasenri, there is the magician, looking for the overflow, Nasenri continues, he stops, plays short for Yaya Toure.\n16:40 Comment: Ahead was Jesús Navas, it is an almost impossible pass to reach Cari Sañaz.\n16:44 Comment: The center, to the penalty spot.\n16:46 Comment: And it ends there, very very clumsy, McCarthy giving away the corner.\n16:50 Comment: But what a move. This is what can happen to you when you leave in the middle of the game.\n16:53 Comment: When you withdraw so much that you practically allow the rival to reach your front line of the area.\n17:0 Comment: And whoever has the ball is not under pressure, he can make a pass like the one we have seen.\n17:6 Comment: The Cristal Palace is getting too far behind and will surely pay for it.\n17:11 Comment: Navas on the outside in the center, bailing out Cari Sañaz's defense.\n17:15 Comment: What a tremendous, tough show by Yaya Toure.\n17:18 Comment: This Shiri gets the ball rolling again, now the Palace is trapped, bottled up and entrenched in their area.\n17:24 Comment: Navas, supported by Yaya Toure on the right, receives the boss.\n17:28 Comment: Again Toure, the Ivorian, wanted to put the center, the ball goes over the baseline, there will be a corner.\n17:35 Comment: Now the leader, the leader of the back line, the leader of the back line, the leader of the back line.\n17:40 Comment: And putting the game in light blue.\n17:44 Comment: The corner for Samir Nasmri.\n17:49 Comment: 28 years of Frenchman who has already established himself in the Premier, first at Arsenal and then at this Manchester City.\n17:55 Comment: Shoot, penalty spot, Mangala wanted the header, goalkeeper Macarthi acts there.\n18:3 Comment: And the goal from the baseline, the goal from the baseline, the goal from the baseline, the goal from the baseline.\n18:11 Comment: The entire match took place except for a couple of actions, the last one precisely, the one that gave rise to that last corner.\n18:19 Comment: He couldn't get the ball.\n18:22 Comment: In general today Macarthi also at a high level like the rest of his colleagues.\n18:27 Comment: The former QPR player, Fernandinho has recovered there.\n18:31 Comment: Long ball there and if Bolasi or whatever receiver doesn't get it, sometimes he takes it out.\n18:37 Comment: If they don't get the second play, Crystal Palace's attack dies there.\n18:44 Comment: In this second half it does not go beyond the center of the field against the dominance of Manchester City.\n18:49 Comment: For me that is a foul and at least a yellow card.\n18:53 Comment: Because of the way MacArthur walks with his foot raised to a tremendous height, with great aggressiveness.\n18:59 Comment: Nasri short and for Kolarov, Manchester City returns on the charge.\n19:4 Comment: With that ball for Fernandinho, he looks for it in the crescent, Bonnie returns it, Fernandinho smashes it.\n19:11 Comment: And he places it next to the left corner of Macarthi's frame.\n19:15 Comment: What a move Manchester City and Wilfred Bonnie still likes each other.\n19:20 Comment: Of course, once again with his back turned, with those receptions he makes, which doesn't allow the center back a bit of a chance.\n19:29 Comment: In no way anticipate him, because he positions his body very well, he moves the ball away very well when controlling it.\n19:36 Comment: It doesn't give the center back any options to put his leg in and he makes some spectacular pivots.\n19:42 Comment: Here we leave looking ahead to the arrival of that player who was so good at Shakhtar and not so good at City.\n19:49 Comment: But in any case he is a great finisher, as is Fernandinho.\n19:52 Comment: Bonnie's back game is remarkable.\n19:55 Comment: In this Manchester City, Gaby, in that offensive facet, Toure steals a lot of prominence from Fernandinho himself.\n20:1 Comment: Because Toure plays a little higher, with more freedom of movement.\n20:5 Comment: There's Gale.\n20:8 Comment: He made his first change there and at Crystal Palace.\n20:11 Comment: Maybe a little different from everything Palace has at the top, not because it's not strong and it's not physical,\n20:19 Comment: But maybe Gale is a little more skilled, faster.\n20:21 Comment: More skilled with the ball at his feet, let's say.\n20:26 Comment: Nasri loses it after good help from MacArthur for Crystal Palace to recover the ball.\n20:32 Comment: MacArthur looks for the long pass, Bakari Sagnat cuts well placed.\n20:38 Comment: He arrives on the front line and to recover Jesús Navas.\n20:41 Comment: Mangala, one space ahead.\n20:44 Comment: Now there Jaya Toure, protect against Suagué.\n20:47 Comment: It was complicated there, Suagué is very, very fast.\n20:55 Comment: Jaya Toure, who is 32 years old, Ivorian international.\n21:2 Comment: Today he is suffering with the rest of his teammates, although now the second half is starting to get more difficult.\n21:7 Comment:  Buddy.\n21:10 Comment: Let's give a couple to Mangala.\n21:14 Comment: The ball there from Navas.\n21:18 Comment: For Nasri the shot was high. He narrowly missed, but the recipe is clear, you have to shoot from outside the area.\n21:25 Comment: Yes, and the problem is that he's not kicking, he's kicking the ball.\n21:28 Comment: With the field very open, stretching the rival as much as possible.\n21:33 Comment: And then with permanent movements between the lines, whether Nasri or Suagué.\n21:41 Comment: And there's the punchline.\n21:43 Comment: And the punchline, the punchline, the punchline.\n21:53 Comment: With permanent movements between the lines, whether from Nasri or from Boni himself, who comes to receive many times.\n22:3 Comment: From Yayá Ture, from Navas.\n22:5 Comment: I'm liking City.\n22:8 Comment: He just gives the sensation that he lacks finishing, but he is playing very well.\n22:14 Comment: Enter Gale for the darkest man today, the one who was shining the least, Bakari Sako.\n22:20 Comment: That has come into play very little and is the first sacrificed by Alan Park.\n22:25 Comment: Let's see if this reactivates Crystal Palace a bit, totally dominated in the second half.\n22:32 Comment: Great Nasri, huh.\n22:34 Comment: Great Nasri has sent De Bruyne to the left wing.\n22:37 Comment: Nasri has gotten inside.\n22:39 Comment: I like this solution.\n22:41 Comment: It's been like this for a few minutes now.\n22:43 Comment: I haven't commented on it because I was waiting to see if it was circumstantial or definitive.\n22:47 Comment: And I don't know if it's definitive, but it's certainly been going on for a while.\n22:51 Comment: With De Bruyne dropping a lot to the left zone.\n22:55 Comment: There we see that that is where he is going to receive.\n22:57 Comment: And Nasri almost as a second striker, as a pure striker, moving more inside.\n23:6 Comment: The ball is now for Vincent Kompany.\n23:8 Comment: The player of the second half with that initial goalless draw, without goals, Shelhards Park.\n23:15 Comment: In a really busy game with alternatives.\n23:18 Comment: Crystal Palace started dominating the first 20 minutes.\n23:23 Comment: And now in the second, everything is light blue.\n23:25 Comment: There is a foul, but Mike Jones applies the advantage well now.\n23:28 Comment: Volassier is leaving.\n23:30 Comment: He doesn't find any companion.\n23:32 Comment: Recover Kolarov. Medelpieza ends up clearing Mangala.\n23:35 Comment: Yes, Manchester City is being very safe in its circulation.\n23:40 Comment: But on this occasion there was a loss that Palace tried to take advantage of by running.\n23:47 Comment: A yellow card and for Samir Nasri for the previous play.\n23:51 Comment: He applied the law of advantage to Mike Jones and then cautioned the international with the French team.\n23:57 Comment: Look, Nasri is already clearly playing on the inside.\n24:0 Comment: I think it's good for him, even for De Bruyne.\n24:2 Comment: Atene soft, center into the area, the shot!\n24:5 Comment: Joe Hart, chance for Panchon.\n24:8 Comment: Now there was a change of roles.\n24:10 Comment: The usual assistant was the finisher.\n24:12 Comment: England's starting goalkeeper excelled.\n24:16 Comment: Magnificent Sore.\n24:18 Comment: Look at what ball Sore says.\n24:20 Comment: Fantastic, how Panchon's action beats the central defender.\n24:25 Comment: Well, wake up the Crystal Palace a little, which had been in the center for a while.\n24:29 Comment: It took the entire second part, really, that it had not appeared, it had not been seen.\n24:36 Comment: Crystal Palace wakes up now, Alan Pardew's team wakes up.\n24:40 Comment: The truth is that City barely gave him a chance in the first 20 minutes of this second half,\n24:46 Comment: where there has been possession, dominance and above all arrivals of the leader of this Premier\n24:53 Comment: In front of Alex McCarthy's goal.\n24:54 Comment: This is a party of alternatives.\n24:56 Comment: If you fall asleep, your rival is going to jump on you.\n25:0 Comment: And you will have to endure several minutes of harassment.\n25:4 Comment: Yes, Crystal Palace missed their chances when they were better.\n25:9 Comment: And exactly the same thing happened to Manchester City in this second half.\n25:14 Comment: He has been superior, he has managed, he has dominated.\n25:18 Comment: And Manchester City, who have had to do a bit of cursing,\n25:21 Comment: He has managed, he has dominated.\n25:24 Comment: But the situations it has created have ruined them all.\n25:29 Comment: We are now live, there is a foul, says Mike Jones and card.\n25:32 Comment: Yellow card there, for that tackle on James McArthur.\n25:40 Comment: He's complaining there too, asking for explanations.\n25:43 Comment: Bret de Haagland, the Norwegian.\n25:45 Comment: And we will see the action repeated.\n25:47 Comment: McArthur, who could have had a yellow card before.\n25:51 Comment: Because of some tough innings.\n25:55 Comment: Haagland sweeps Nasri there in a very ugly, very dirty way.\n26:1 Comment: What happens is that in the end it is Nasri who could have hurt Haagland, curiously, because he steps on him.\n26:11 Comment: Nasri, who had just been booked a few moments ago by Mike Jones.\n26:17 Comment: Now the yellow card has gone to Bret Haagland.\n26:20 Comment: This is the previous action in which Nasri has seen yellow.\n26:24 Comment: That counter should have been cut, what happens is that it slips, that's my feeling.\n26:29 Comment: He's more than enough to have cut off the Palace's speed start, but he slipped.\n26:36 Comment: Let's see if he recovers, because that's what City was missing.\n26:38 Comment: One minute almost 27 into the second half. Nasri, limping, the international blue is limping there.\n26:46 Comment: Let's go up there.\n26:48 Comment: Sterling.\n26:50 Comment: To Raheem Sterling.\n26:52 Comment: Out of the team today, after having scored the first goal against Watford on the last day.\n26:58 Comment: I have no doubt that we will see him against Juve.\n27:1 Comment: He has been left out of the bailment, I think more out of caution than anything else.\n27:5 Comment: The pilgrim is as if she were consulting with Nasri.\n27:9 Comment: It seems to me that he is going to return to the field.\n27:11 Comment: You can't afford to do without it either.\n27:15 Comment: The little pilgrim has its quota of troops right now.\n27:21 Comment: Because of the injuries.\n27:22 Comment: MacArthur puts it there, long ball.\n27:25 Comment: Panchon.\n27:31 Comment: Wilfred Sáh controlled there, he has Panchon very close to him, great control, although later he gives it to Yaya Toure.\n27:38 Comment: Kolarov.\n27:40 Comment: De Bruyne, how well he takes the ball for City.\n27:42 Comment: Yaya Toure, how well he takes the ball for City.\n27:45 Comment: Fernandinho, first touch after Nasri's, then Bruyne makes a mistake, Fernandinho arrives like a tractor.\n27:50 Comment: He takes the ball down the wing and the kick is stopped by Palace.\n27:54 Comment: What happens is that when City plays fast, the Palace players arrive late.\n28:0 Comment:  They come late.\n28:2 Comment: And that is the key to the game for me, from Manchester City's point of view.\n28:5 Comment: That he is able to combine as he is doing in this second part.\n28:9 Comment: Look, with this type of game Crystal Palace is going to be late all the time.\n28:16 Comment: Nasri practically wears a hat to hit over the Palace defensive line.\n28:22 Comment: What a great job, Yaya Toure, trademark of the house.\n28:24 Comment: Yaya Toure, how well he takes the ball for City.\n28:32 Comment: And once again, Wilfried Bonnie leaving face.\n28:35 Comment: That fantastic back game.\n28:37 Comment: And once again, a terrible definition.\n28:40 Comment: A lousy final shot.\n28:43 Comment: Which is undoubtedly City's great pending issue.\n28:47 Comment: And once again, a terrible definition.\n28:50 Comment: A lousy final shot.\n28:53 Comment: Which is undoubtedly City's great pending issue.\n28:55 Comment: Especially in the second part.\n29:1 Comment: The first one suffered much more of course.\n29:4 Comment: 17 shots from Manchester City.\n29:8 Comment: What happens is that the majority have not gone to the door.\n29:11 Comment: But 17 shots.\n29:14 Comment: The ball goes to Kolarov.\n29:17 Comment: He insists now on Manchester City.\n29:19 Comment: And that's it.\n29:20 Comment: 17 shots.\n29:22 Comment: The ball goes to Kolarov. He insists now on Manchester City.\n29:26 Comment: With De Bruyne.\n29:28 Comment: And that pass again. Einar didn't understand it.\n29:30 Comment: And Norri is not a specialist in that either.\n29:33 Comment: Because it doesn't have a very fast start.\n29:35 Comment: He's not exactly a sprinter.\n29:37 Comment: But De Bruyne's idea was spectacular.\n29:40 Comment: And the ease with which he executes it.\n29:43 Comment: He, I insist, would have to ask him of course.\n29:47 Comment: But I'm sure it's a little to the left there.\n29:50 Comment: De Bruyne is quite comfortable.\n29:55 Comment: Think that's for McCarthy.\n29:57 Comment: You are seeing how the leader is around his goal again and again in this second half.\n30:2 Comment: Although the score remains unchanged.\n30:5 Comment: It doesn't move with that initial tie today between Crystal Palace and Manchester City.\n30:9 Comment: On this fifth day of the Premier League.\n30:11 Comment: As always, the best football in the world only here on Movistar Plus.\n30:13 Comment: Because we are the home of football.\n30:16 Comment: And that, yes, we are in England.\n30:18 Comment: And in just six days.\n30:24 Comment: We are going to have a great event.\n30:26 Comment: The Rugby World Cup begins.\n30:28 Comment: Which we are also going to offer here at Movistar Plus.\n30:30 Comment: Live and exclusive.\n30:32 Comment: World Cup that is going to be played in England.\n30:34 Comment: And in some Premier stadiums.\n30:36 Comment: For example, Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium.\n30:38 Comment: They are also going to lend Wembley Stadium.\n30:41 Comment: The Cathedral of Football.\n30:43 Comment: And others like Newcastle's St. James Park.\n30:46 Comment: Or the one in Villa Park.\n30:48 Comment: In Birmingham at Aston Villa.\n30:51 Comment: Let's see that free kick for Crystal Palace.\n30:56 Comment: Martin Kelly Launch.\n30:59 Comment: Nobody, there Scott Dunne.\n31:1 Comment: He cleared Manchester City's defense.\n31:4 Comment: Alonso tries to get down, Suáguez.\n31:7 Comment:  Jesus Navas.\n31:9 Comment: Suáguez had been remade there.\n31:11 Comment: Yaya Toure.\n31:13 Comment: Starts with power.\n31:15 Comment: Connect with Boni. Now very late.\n31:16 Comment: The game is coming to decongest it.\n31:18 Comment: Giving oxygen there on the left.\n31:20 Comment: To Kevin de Bruyne. Although there was already a 2 against 2.\n31:22 Comment: De Bruyne's center is very closed.\n31:24 Comment: McCarthy's goal.\n31:26 Comment: The Belgian was a little hasty there.\n31:31 Comment: Leaving lights and shadows in their debut.\n31:35 Comment: Some brilliant actions, others not so much.\n31:38 Comment: It's logical too.\n31:40 Comment: It is also not easy to enter without prior notice and in a match as difficult as this.\n31:46 Comment: It is a match that can be decided in a small detail.\n31:49 Comment: Because it is very very closed.\n31:52 Comment: In the first half, in the first 20 minutes, Manchester City defended themselves with great order.\n31:57 Comment: Although at times he was almost riddled by the Palace.\n32:1 Comment: And now in the second season they are trying to do the same and Alan Partiu's team is succeeding.\n32:6 Comment: 32 of the second part.\n32:8 Comment: For the time being, City is up.\n32:11 Comment: Jesús Navas has it. He enables Bakary Sagnat.\n32:13 Comment: In short for Nassenry.\n32:16 Comment: He's going to try to break down the axis. Nassenry continues. Short for Boni.\n32:20 Comment: He keeps it there. He leaves it for Kevin de Bruyne. De Bruyne wanted the pass for Navas.\n32:24 Comment: Loose ball. The Belgian wins again.\n32:27 Comment: Starting over for Jokard.\n32:30 Comment: Great ambition for City.\n32:33 Comment: With a lot of people ahead of the ball.\n32:36 Comment: Taking risks and going to win the game without any doubt.\n32:42 Comment: There goes Samir Nassenry about to lose.\n32:46 Comment: It helps Fernandinho decisively to win the ball.\n32:50 Comment: Nassenry continues. Short for Kevin de Bruyne.\n32:54 Comment: This relies again on French.\n32:57 Comment: Very closed there. Crystal Palace.\n32:59 Comment: With everyone behind Bruyne's ball. City is not losing patience.\n33:3 Comment: Nassenry can lose it and he loses it. Nobody warned him that he was coming from behind.\n33:7 Comment: To put your foot in there. You have to go from behind.\n33:9 Comment: To put my foot in there. Yannick Bolasie.\n33:12 Comment: Gale.\n33:14 Comment: He protects there. He stays with him hard. He looks for the ball up high.\n33:18 Comment: Cuts perfectly. Placed.\n33:20 Comment: To Iliakin Mangala.\n33:22 Comment: City also did well when it came to recovering the ball.\n33:26 Comment: Charge there. Navas with Bakary Sañá's company.\n33:30 Comment: Jesús Navas continues. Ball sewn to the foot of the Spaniard. Navas now very locked in.\n33:34 Comment: It's a 2 against 3. Sañá. Start over.\n33:37 Comment: Manuel Pellegrini's team does not lose faith.\n33:40 Comment: Touching and touching to find the gap in the Eagles' defense.\n33:43 Comment: De Bruyne.\n33:45 Comment: Association with Alexander Kolarov. The Serbian already has it.\n33:48 Comment: There goes Kolarov. There could have been a push.\n33:51 Comment: There is to me.\n33:53 Comment: Let's see what Mike Jones whistled because it's not on plan and we haven't seen it.\n33:56 Comment: Lack of zaja. What I had pointed out.\n34:1 Comment: Kolarov arrives very well there.\n34:3 Comment: City plays very well again.\n34:4 Comment: De Bruyne puts a very good ball into space.\n34:7 Comment: Kolarov wins the action over Zaha who is really working hard.\n34:12 Comment: But he's making a mistake. He's going to fly.\n34:15 Comment: He didn't have a single chance in the second half to show his speed and hurt Manchester City.\n34:22 Comment: A City, I insist, dominating the game with the ball and suffering very little.\n34:28 Comment: And enter Jedinak.\n34:31 Comment: There's Mike Jedinak.\n34:32 Comment: It has been doubtful during the week.\n34:36 Comment: Australian player.\n34:39 Comment: Very important player who...\n34:43 Comment:  An injury.\n34:47 Comment: There's Kolarov's shot. The foul.\n34:49 Comment: To the penalty spot. That ball where he couldn't finish.\n34:52 Comment: From Alla Tauri. Recycle that ball.\n34:54 Comment: A la Navas. One against one.\n34:56 Comment: Navas wants to break from the outside. He cuts the Spaniard against Swagge who is holding on.\n34:59 Comment: Navas continues. The cut to Spain.\n35:2 Comment: Navas and Swagge grave. He puts the center with his left foot.\n35:5 Comment: Wiffle Pony threatened the Chilean style. Bruin in his face.\n35:8 Comment: For Nasri. He ends up getting the ball out of Jedinak that way.\n35:11 Comment: But it's worth it to Palas. What a kick.\n35:14 Comment: From Liak and Mangala. There will be a yellow card.\n35:16 Comment: Very clear for French.\n35:24 Comment: They are left there from Liak and Mangala. And now also from Alla Tauri who talks to Johan Kvash.\n35:29 Comment: Cards with very hard faults.\n35:32 Comment: This is a very hard foul. And this could also have been a red card.\n35:36 Comment: Entry from behind, with no ball option, with a lot of violence.\n35:40 Comment: The impact is very violent.\n35:46 Comment: The match that had several very strong, very tough episodes.\n35:51 Comment: As expected, moreover.\n35:54 Comment: With Crystal Palace, if you want to win here it's like breaking into a house.\n35:59 Comment: You have to, at some point, confront the owners.\n36:3 Comment: To leave here with the three points. It's very complicated.\n36:9 Comment: Alan Pardew, who is becoming strong with Crystal Palace.\n36:12 Comment: After having had a very bad time in the previous seasons with Newcastle, at St James' Park.\n36:17 Comment: He is already preparing a new change, the third on his team.\n36:20 Comment: The Korean footballer.\n36:23 Comment: There has already been a clearly defensive change.\n36:26 Comment: Which was the last one, with Jedinak's entry into the field.\n36:30 Comment: Now we're going to see who leaves, but obviously, Alan Pardew, what he doesn't want is to lose the game.\n36:40 Comment: That is, sign the tie without any doubt.\n36:43 Comment: He is showing it with his changes.\n36:45 Comment: And it has a lot of merit, if they achieve it, to draw 0-0 against Manchester City.\n36:49 Comment: First game in which City did not score a goal this season.\n36:58 Comment: Tie it there, Chuljon Lee.\n37:0 Comment: Jason Panchon leaves, now damaged from this battle of St James' Park,\n37:5 Comment: as already happened in the first half with Sergio Agüero.\n37:8 Comment: Now that he can no longer continue and goes to the rear, it's Panchon.\n37:12 Comment: This is the one that was in the league, there are many leagues, in which they have won.\n37:18 Comment: And the one who has won is the one who is in the Champions League team.\n37:26 Comment: This is the one who was in the league, there are many leagues, Koreans.\n37:31 Comment: There are even many Chun-Yu.\n37:34 Comment: This is the one who was at Bolton, for those who follow the English league the most.\n37:38 Comment: He was already there last season, although he played very little at the Palace.\n37:42 Comment: And this year he also started as a substitute.\n37:46 Comment: Gaby has already taken Ampario off the field, his three mainstays, we would say.\n37:51 Comment: Bolasi, Saco and Panchon.\n37:52 Comment: Yes, Zaha remains and now Lee.\n37:57 Comment: And now he has one more midfielder, with the presence of Jedinac,\n38:1 Comment: to give more rockiness, if possible, to the center of the field.\n38:5 Comment: That indicates a priori, let's see what happens a posteriori,\n38:9 Comment: But it does indicate in the first instance that Palace could take a point.\n38:14 Comment: But attacking with many forwards does not always mean that you are going to win the game,\n38:19 Comment: nor does putting more midfielders imply that you want to stay back there.\n38:24 Comment: Wilfred Zaha is trying it now too,\n38:27 Comment: Martin Kelly's cross, hanging ball, penalty spot.\n38:29 Comment: Chun-Yu Lee attacking that ball, he's going to let it go down the wing.\n38:33 Comment: Now there is Pape and Suagué.\n38:36 Comment: The unconditional public with their team.\n38:39 Comment: Jedinac on the edge of the area for Cahill.\n38:42 Comment: Once again for Jedinac, there is Ossi, opening for Suagué to play.\n38:47 Comment: With the center, very good, the low and Zaha.\n38:51 Comment: Control already surrounded, otherwise Zaha continues, transgressive you start.\n38:55 Comment: He crosses over to the other number 11, Kolarov.\n38:57 Comment: What balls Suagré puts in from the left wing.\n39:1 Comment: The lateral crosses that Suagré takes with that left leg are spectacular.\n39:5 Comment: Tense, powerful and with options for the finisher.\n39:8 Comment: Platinians, they are real bananas,\n39:13 Comment: There is nothing better for forwards.\n39:16 Comment: The typical tense ball and also with that arc to be able to finish it.\n39:25 Comment: Now the ball for Yaya Toure, final stretch of the game.\n39:29 Comment: Last 5 minutes plus whatever Mike Jones adds.\n39:31 Comment: There is missing over the Fileño sea.\n39:33 Comment: Today he didn't shine too much, he's having a hard time getting going.\n39:37 Comment: We have seen better Fernandinho, who has put together a great game in defense and attack.\n39:41 Comment: But Yaya Toure has a lot of experience, he knows how to manage the tempos of a game.\n39:45 Comment: You always have to expect the best from him, in the beginning, in the middle or in the epilogue, in the outcome of each clash.\n39:52 Comment: Now the palas should better entangle City's game with the presence of Yedi Nakai.\n39:57 Comment: A change that perhaps could have come sooner and that perhaps would have prevented City from dominating so clearly.\n40:6 Comment: But well, now in these last minutes with Yedi Nakai, he has a large radius of action and is a very aggressive player as well.\n40:14 Comment: Bakary Sagnar's serve, anticipation on Wilfred Bonny by Mike Yedi Nakai.\n40:20 Comment: What a tackle from Vincent Compagni too, he calls for a foul on Mike Jones.\n40:23 Comment: Compagni, who is not cautioned yet, Eliakim Mangala was.\n40:29 Comment: Vincent Compagni, the captain of the Idisons, is missing.\n40:35 Comment: This is true... here City must be well concentrated, so that the game does not slip away due to a set piece in which the palas are fearsome.\n40:46 Comment: There's the dead ball, the dead ball.\n40:49 Comment: There's the foul, ball there to the crescent, Yedi Nakai managed to extend.\n40:53 Comment: Sagnar's clearance, he pursues her and Jesús Navas already has her.\n40:57 Comment: Uncompromising Johan Kavash.\n40:59 Comment: Navas was very active today, very fast, it's a shame that he missed that clear opportunity in the 54th minute of the game.\n41:7 Comment: If I remember correctly, I think it was minute 54.\n41:11 Comment: In 50, yes.\n41:13 Comment: As soon as the second half started, Manchester City had that magnificent counterattack.\n41:18 Comment: One of those that should not be failed, obviously.\n41:21 Comment: But at the moment of finishing, Navas balances a little, he loses the ball very slightly and it is difficult for him to position his body to hit with his left.\n41:30 Comment: Ball for Jesús Navas, the Spaniard keeps it there, leaves it short for Bakary Sagnar.\n41:35 Comment: The veteran French full-back, now 32 years old, made the trip from London to Manchester, leaving Arsenal to join Manchester City.\n41:45 Comment: Fernandinho and with Kolarov, Kevin de Bruyne, who leaves in the middle of the hour.\n41:49 Comment: And the ball for Jesús Navas, which the

you're going to see it all live and exclusively here on Movistar Plus.\n42:33 Comment: I know Edu that you are very fond of rugby, and it is a sport that I love, but I don't like it being played on soccer fields.\n42:41 Comment: Neither did Fer Wilson.\n42:43 Comment: I'm not surprised.\n42:44 Comment: The explanation, obviously, seems obvious, but the most curious thing of all is that he, who continues to be a very important man on the Manchester United scene,\n42:53 Comment: He does authorize them to play 13-a-side rugby, which is another type of rugby, which he doesn't seem to care about.\n42:58 Comment: There was the shot in the mouth of the goal.\n43:0 Comment: Gale takes it, away from Joe Hart's frame, 7 meters 32 centimeters to place it, and Gale finishes it off.\n43:9

this.\n45:39 Comment: How he receives from the front, how he breaks, of course he attracts as always, he attracts 3 or 4 rivals,\n45:46 Comment: But instead of looking for the free teammate, what he

    "summary": "The match between Crystal Palace and Manchester City took place at Selhurst Park, offering an intense battle that showcased both teams' strengths and vulnerabilities. Despite Crystal Palace's unyielding drive and formidable energy, it was Manchester City who emerged victorious with a narrow 1-0 win, maintaining their perfect start to the Premier League season.\n\nFrom the opening whistle, the match was set at a frenetic pace. Crystal Palace immediately demonstrated why they were second on the table. With their characteristic energy and intensity, they quickly put Manchester City under pressure. Early on, Yannick Bolasie tested Joe Hart with a high shot, indicating Palace's intentions to exploit any gaps left by City's defense. The Congolese forward's speed and power were evident, causing considerable problems for City's defenders.\n\nCrystal Palace's direct style of play was unsettling City's defense. They frequently aimed for long balls that tested the defensive line, including efforts that forced Vincent Kompany to clear hurriedly and a fervent center from Martin Kelly that saw Joe Hart sending the ball for a corner. Bolasie was especially dangerous, consistently beating the defenders to create scoring opportunities and keeping City's defense on high alert.\n\nCity, however, showed their resilience and ability to withstand pressure. As the game progressed, they began to grow into the match, demonstrating why they were the Premier League leaders. Their controlled and patient build-up play started to become more influential, with Sergio Agüero and Wilfried Bony combining to bring City up the field.\n\nSamir Nasri and Jesús Navas were key playmakers for City, orchestrating their attacks from the midfield and wings, respectively. An early scare for Manchester City came when Agüero had to leave the field due to an injury following a harsh tackle from Scott Dann, which saw the City star replaced by Kevin De Bruyne. This substitution marked De Bruyne's debut for Manchester City, and his presence immediately began to influence the tempo and dynamics of the game.\n\nWith De Bruyne on the pitch, City started to find their rhythm, circulating the ball effectively among Yaya Touré, Fernandinho, and the wingers. Despite the growing pressure from City, Crystal Palace's defense remained sturdy, with McCarthy making crucial saves, notably from a powerful strike by Bony after a well-worked City attack.\n\nHeading into the second half, Crystal Palace maintained their assertive approach. Hangeland's robust presence in defense kept Palace resilient. However, Manchester City's positional play and patient ball circulation often pushed Palace into their own half. City continued to probe for an opening, utilizing De Bruyne's vision and Nasri's flair.\n\nThe best chance for City came when Jesús Navas, after a brilliant build-up, rounded McCarthy only to miss an open goal. It was a glorious opportunity that epitomized City’s struggle to convert their dominance into goals. Navas’s miss would have given City the lead, but his composure faltered at the critical moment.\n\nCity's relentless pressure was unceasing. De Bruyne, now effectively commanding the midfield, threaded passes and linked up well with the attackers. Nasri, playing more centrally, frequently dropped deep to collect the ball and drive City forward. The combination of Nasri's creativity and De Bruyne's precision continued to unravel Palace's defensive formation, yet McCarthy's heroics kept Palace in the game.\n\nAs the game drew closer to its final whistle, Alan Pardew made tactical changes, introducing Gale and then Mile Jedinak to solidify the midfield and give Palace more defensive cover. Despite these changes, Palace struggled to create substantial threats on City's goal, now firmly under City's control.\n\nThe pivotal moment came in the closing stages. Nasri, who had been instrumental throughout the match, initiated a move with a penetrating run through Palace's defense. His shot, powerful and direct, was parried by McCarthy, but the rebound fell kindly to substitute Kelechi Iheanacho. The young Nigerian striker, having just entered the game, displayed excellent poise and quick reflexes to slot the ball into the net, scoring his first senior goal for Manchester City. The timing and significance of this goal underpinned his potential and marked a memorable moment in his burgeoning career.\n\nThe goal was a manifestation of City's persistence and tactical superiority. Crystal Palace, despite their early dominance and resilient defense, could not prevent the determined surge from City's ranks, ultimately succumbing to the relentless pressure exerted by Pellegrini’s men.\n\nIn the closing minutes, Palace attempted to mount a response, pushing forward in search of an equalizer. However, City's defense, marshaled by Kompany and Mangala, stood firm. Joe Hart’s assured handling in goal quelled any hopes of a late resurgence by Palace.\n\nReflecting on the match, Crystal Palace displayed significant promise, particularly in their high-octane start and structured defense. Yet, their inability to sustain pressure and convert opportunities into goals highlighted areas needing improvement. For Manchester City, the match was a testament to their depth, resilience, and tactical flexibility. De Bruyne’s debut, despite moments of inconsistency, showcased his capacity to influence games, and Nasri’s central role underscored his importance in the absence of Silva.\n\nThe victory solidified Manchester City's position at the top of the Premier League table, extending their perfect record with five wins from five matches and maintaining their impeccable defensive record without conceding a single goal. The match at Selhurst Park epitomized the rigor and unpredictability of Premier League football, delivering a contest full of action, skill, and decisive moments.\n\nOverall, while Crystal Palace fell just short, they displayed qualities that promise a competitive season ahead. Manchester City's win, driven by collective effort and individual brilliance, reiterated their championship credentials and set a high bar for the rest of the league."
