hey!\n37:4 Comment: Tourette.\n37:7 Comment: City have had plenty of games like this at home\n37:10 Comment: in recent seasons,\n37:13 Comment: having to try and pick a way through an ultra-defensive\n37:16 Comment: line-up from the opposition.\n37:19 Comment: They usually find a way through.\n37:21 Comment: Scored in 86 of their last 89 home league games.\n37:27 Comment: Not many keep them out.\n37:29 Comment: Although I mentioned top of the game,\n37:32 Comment: that match against Stoke a year ago.\n37:35 Comment: Stoke did keep them at bay.\n37:46 Comment: Foul.\n37:46 Comment: Foul by Barami on Aguero.\n37:57 Comment: Will he consider this first half a success?\n38:0 Comment: Well, he will, because his team haven't conceded yet.\n38:4 Comment: And at the moment, they're going away with a point,\n38:5 Comment: but there is an awful lot of time to pass\n38:8 Comment: in this game yet.\n38:16 Comment: Silva.\n38:23 Comment: Sterling.\n38:26 Comment: Very well seen again.\n38:31 Comment: Aguero picks it up.\n38:33 Comment: And it only takes a moment like that,\n38:35 Comment: and all that good work is undone.\n38:37 Comment: You see, for me, if Watford had an out, i.e. a striker,\n38:40 Comment: they'd at least be able, went there,\n38:42 Comment: they'd be able to play it forward in the direction.\n38:44 Comment: But all they've got now is to try and keep the ball out,\n38:46 Comment: in their own final third.\n38:48 Comment: They get robbed once again.\n38:50 Comment: And a chance presents itself to the last person\n38:53 Comment: in the Premier League.\n38:54 Comment: You want it to in Sergio Aguero.\n38:56 Comment: Just can't quite wrap his foot around it,\n38:57 Comment: but Watford simply cannot keep getting away\n39:1 Comment: with giving the ball away in their own final third.\n39:12 Comment: A free kick here, and the yellow card is coming out.\n39:15 Comment: Gerardo goes.\n39:16 Comment: He's over.\n39:19 Comment: Well, Mark Lattenberg sent off the Chelsea captain last week.\n39:23 Comment: This time he books the City captain, Vincent Kompany.\n39:27 Comment: He's barely had a challenge to make, has he, Kompany?\n39:30 Comment: But stupid, really.\n39:33 Comment: Kicks through, he knows he shouldn't have done it.\n39:37 Comment: He's only one minor indiscretion away\n39:40 Comment: from leaving his team with a problem.\n39:46 Comment: Gerardo.\n39:48 Comment: Well, a rare chance from a set-piece.\n39:50 Comment: The delivery has to be better than that.\n40:5 Comment: Into the final five of what's been a rather tepid first half, really.\n40:10 Comment: The crowd haven't really engaged with the action.\n40:13 Comment: City frustrated by...\n40:16 Comment: Watford's side determined to sit in.\n40:20 Comment: I think the crowd have been extremely patient, really,\n40:22 Comment: but they must be used to this kind of a situation.\n40:28 Comment: Navas.\n40:35 Comment: Well, the defender there, Holabas,\n40:37 Comment: knew that Navas wanted to get it on his right foot.\n40:46 Comment: He's playing without a striker, pretty much.\n41:15 Comment: They win the ball back again.\n41:16 Comment: He's...\n41:16 Comment: But you can see all ten outfield players in the picture there and once he gets it\n41:21 Comment: Absolutely nowhere to go\n41:24 Comment: That's been a problem all half for Watford\n41:28 Comment: Corrado is meant to be the furthest player forward\n41:34 Comment: But more often than not he's coming back to help out as well\n41:40 Comment: Well Troy Deeney has played almost alongside Neom the right back he literally has\n41:46 Comment: Can't be what he's used to and it can't be what he enjoys but\n41:53 Comment: His team walk away from here without being beaten and it'll be worth it\n42:16 Comment: He's got a lot of pressure up his sleeve\n42:20 Comment: His company\n42:27 Comment: Big City have to increase the tempo in the second half way they started the game\n42:33 Comment: That's when Watford looked in the most peril\n42:46 Comment: To minus scares but\n42:53 Comment: Problem here for Neal yellow card coming out for the fullback\n43:5 Comment: He's adamantly gets the ball here, but absolutely nowhere near the ball you can have no complaints whatsoever\n43:16 Comment: Now that's\n43:24 Comment: I think we might record that one as a shot off target\n43:31 Comment: Well, no one had more shots in the Premier League without scoring the Navas last season 46 shots without finding the net\n43:41 Comment: How many scored from 20 yards with his left foot, but I'm guessing not many\n43:48 Comment: He's not the most composed\n43:50 Comment: Finisher Manchester City possess\n44:9 Comment: Now that's Toure\n44:16 Comment: The scruff of the neck as he so often does\n44:19 Comment: And he moves further upfield\n44:22 Comment: His teeny\n44:25 Comment: Finally moving off that right flank\n44:30 Comment: Need some help though\n44:38 Comment: Arada\n44:42 Comment: There army\n44:44 Comment: now caput\n44:46 Comment: Holabas\n44:50 Comment: Rodel\n44:54 Comment: Cathcart\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Welcome back to the Etihad Stadium. Mark Clattenburg starts the second half.\n0:4 Comment: Of course there have been a dearth of home wins in the Barclays Premier League\n0:10 Comment: this season. Just six so far from the 30 games played in the first three weeks of\n0:16 Comment: the season. Just one home win last week. City struggling to break down Watford\n0:23 Comment: here today. Watford who've shown very little ambition going forward but have\n0:27 Comment: done a terrific job defensively. The onus is on City to find a way through.\n0:34 Comment: Samir Nasri on for the second half having scored that excellent goal in the\n0:40 Comment: away win at Everton last week. Beautifully dinked the ball didn't he\n0:44 Comment: over Tim Howard. Could he make that type of impact in the second half here?\n0:50 Comment: Well he certainly offers you more of a goals threat doesn't he than Hayes' Navas.\n0:54 Comment: Manuel Pellegrini quick to take action.\n1:3 Comment: If you're Watford this time last season early stages of the championship\n1:9 Comment: aspiring for games like this aren't you? Facing the likes of Aguero, Sterling,\n1:16 Comment: Silva, Navas, Yaya Toure and knowing it'll be a massive challenge but it's a\n1:23 Comment: challenge that they've risen to so far in this game. Great persistence.\n1:28 Comment: Sterling, he's done it. Within 90 seconds of the restart Raheem Sterling gets his first City goal\n1:37 Comment: and just look what it means to him.\n1:42 Comment: Well it didn't take long did it? He gets himself in a real good position in\n1:48 Comment: between the goals. Again Watford give the ball away. It goes out wide, it's whipped\n1:52 Comment: in beautifully and he times his run to perfection and he cushions the ball with\n1:59 Comment: the inside of that right boot into the corner. It's a calm clinical finish but\n2:4 Comment: what about the cross from Sanya? Stunning. On a plate and Manchester City have that\n2:12 Comment: lead that they craved and that will calm a few nerves around here that's for sure.\n2:19 Comment: Well he had his best scoring season last campaign when he scored 12 goals in all\n2:25 Comment: competitions and he's off the mark for City in August, the opening month of the\n2:31 Comment: season. Just what he would have wanted. Denied by Gomez in the first half. Gomez\n2:37 Comment: was getting nowhere near that one and City have found the way through. Do\n2:44 Comment: Watford have that elusive plan B?\n2:53 Comment: Nasri, collar off.\n2:59 Comment: Goal kick.\n3:3 Comment: Well now Kike Sanchez-Flores has a decision to make Don. Well he does and it\n3:8 Comment: can only be one decision and that is to play with a striker because they haven't\n3:14 Comment: played with a striker in the opening half.\n3:17 Comment: Troy Deeney's average position must have been almost next to his right back in\n3:21 Comment: that first half. Really need to get him high up the pitch as they possibly can.\n3:28 Comment: That's exactly what Flores has done, ordered him through the middle.\n3:36 Comment: I would have thought that he would be a lot happy about that as well.\n3:44 Comment: Harada will be the closest player to Deeney.\n3:55 Comment: Sterling who started much more centrally in this second half.\n4:4 Comment: Like I said they're so used to teams coming here and getting ten outfield\n4:9 Comment: players behind the ball Manchester City. They've had to be patient on numerous\n4:15 Comment: occasions. There aren't many that are going to come here and try and mix it in a\n4:20 Comment: footballing sense with them. Their patience has been rewarded.\n4:26 Comment: Egalo, Harada.\n4:34 Comment: Inside is Neop. Cameroonian right back, offside against Egalo I think in the middle.\n4:42 Comment: Well he has tweaked things Manuel Pellegrini because Silva's gone out to the right side.\n4:50 Comment: Nasri on the left and Sterling behind Aguero.\n4:56 Comment: Paid immediate dividends didn't it? Raheem Sterling finding himself in a central area.\n5:1 Comment: Unable to attack a wonderful cross from Bakri Sanye.\n5:11 Comment: Who says David Silva can't affect things from a wide position? He certainly did there.\n5:15 Comment: Egalo.\n5:28 Comment: Well look at Troy Deeney's position at the top right of your screen there.\n5:33 Comment: Pushed much further forward and it was a move that Pique Sanchez-Flores really had to make.\n5:42 Comment: He has a target man now and that is Troy Deeney's strength.\n5:48 Comment: Kompany and Mangala won't have had an easy half. They weren't bullied at all by anyone.\n5:54 Comment: Deeney can certainly attempt to do that in a second.\n6:6 Comment: Well played Sterling.\n6:7 Comment: Silva.\n6:17 Comment: Looking for Sanye. Glorious ball. Further away is by Cath Katz for a corner.\n6:26 Comment: He's just a magician isn't he David Silva?\n6:29 Comment: Whenever he's on the ball if there are runners ahead of him he will invariably spot them.\n6:38 Comment: And have the ability to pick them out.\n6:44 Comment: Seventh corner for City. Silva takes. Kompany goes for it.\n6:53 Comment: It's no secret that he makes that burst towards the near post. Kompany.\n6:58 Comment: Did it to a very good effect against both West Brom and Chelsea.\n7:7 Comment: For the record City have won 25 of the last 29 when scoring the first goal in the Premier League.\n7:29 Comment: Only once did they lose in that time. It was against Manchester United of course last April.\n7:37 Comment: It's a big ask for Watford to do it. Sterling.\n7:42 Comment: Well a referee is going to put it back for the foul by Sebastian Probel.\n7:45 Comment: Again that is brilliant refereeing. What I like is just because Raheem Sterling doesn't throw himself to the floor.\n7:52 Comment: Mark Clattenburg recognizes that he's fouled. Just there he has a swing.\n7:57 Comment: Catches Sterling who stays on his feet and gets the reward with a free kick anyway.\n8:5 Comment: Good referee and I like that.\n8:7 Comment: It would be nice to see the odd penalty given like that wouldn't it? It would. Without players having to go down.\n8:14 Comment: Nazri delivers.\n8:36 Comment: Aguero.\n8:43 Comment: Fernandinho.\n8:47 Comment: Nazri. Sterling back to Nazri.\n8:52 Comment: I think he knew that that was a foul despite the expression on his face.\n8:57 Comment: What a position in which to get a free kick.\n9:1 Comment: We're in Yaya Toure land aren't we? Really lovely play.\n9:4 Comment: Little short sharp passes and gets a little bit of luck doesn't he? Sami and Nazri.\n9:11 Comment: Berrami just pulls him to the ground.\n9:14 Comment: Practices these ad nauseum day in day out for exactly this type of moment.\n9:20 Comment: It's that lovely distance for a referee.\n9:24 Comment: And it's a lovely distance for a referee.\n9:28 Comment: It's a lovely distance for a referee.\n9:35 Comment: Practices these ad nauseum day in day out for exactly this type of moment.\n9:41 Comment: It's that lovely distance for a player.\n9:44 Comment: It's just far enough out to give you space to get the ball up over the wall.\n9:50 Comment: And down again the other side.\n10:2 Comment: So here goes Toure.\n10:5 Comment: Wall jumps and makes the initial block but here's Silva.\n10:9 Comment: Great ball. Fernandinho.\n10:13 Comment: Well they didn't score direct from the free kick.\n10:16 Comment: But it didn't take them long to get the second goal.\n10:18 Comment: Fernandinho who scored here against Chelsea nets in his second consecutive home game.\n10:24 Comment: Well here's another one who you think with a strike like he's got should score more goals.\n10:31 Comment: This is absolutely power.\n10:34 Comment: It explodes off his right boot.\n10:37 Comment: And goes right through Aurelio Gomez.\n10:39 Comment: He may get a bit of luck with a break off the wall but again that vision that David Silva\n10:43 Comment: and awareness to find Fernandinho.\n10:46 Comment: The angle is against him.\n10:49 Comment: But one touch and bang the pace beats Aurelio Gomez.\n10:55 Comment: Little celebration from the manager.\n10:57 Comment: I think he knows that should.\n10:59 Comment: Do the job for him.\n11:5 Comment: Well he won't like being beaten.\n11:7 Comment: From that type of angle but it was hit with tremendous power by Fernandinho.\n11:16 Comment: Set up by Silva. That's his 50th Premier League assist.\n11:21 Comment: No one has got more assists in the Premier League since he made his debut in August 2010.\n11:28 Comment: Aguero.\n11:30 Comment: Sterling.\n11:31 Comment: Silva.\n11:33 Comment: Looking to return it to Aguero.\n11:35 Comment: And Holabas gets it away and suddenly you fear for what for the little bit.\n11:40 Comment: Could be a very very long.\n11:44 Comment: End to this game. There's so long to go over.\n11:48 Comment: Half an hour yet.\n11:53 Comment: The two goal cushion.\n11:58 Comment: They'll be able to relax a little bit.\n12:2 Comment: The big thing for Manchester City is to score the first goal\n12:4 Comment: when they're at home and that will bring the opposition out.\n12:7 Comment: They have to. Got no choice.\n12:9 Comment: Deep in thought there.\n12:11 Comment: The Watford coach.\n12:14 Comment: Once Manchester City do get that\n12:17 Comment: first goal.\n12:18 Comment: They know that the gaps and the spaces\n12:21 Comment: in this big pitch\n12:22 Comment: should start opening up and gives them more opportunity to exploit them.\n12:28 Comment: Toure.\n12:29 Comment: Aguero.\n12:31 Comment: Toure.\n12:33 Comment: Raheem Sterling.\n12:35 Comment: His first touch just allowed\n12:37 Comment: Kafka to make the clearance.\n12:39 Comment: Silva.\n12:42 Comment: Sterling.\n12:44 Comment: Cleared by the heel of Kaput.\n12:47 Comment: Toure.\n12:48 Comment: Brilliant.\n12:49 Comment: Raheem Sterling.\n12:52 Comment: Aguero.\n12:56 Comment: You're about to say 3-0 there.\n12:57 Comment: You don't expect that kind of contact from him.\n13:0 Comment: It's his first real opportunity.\n13:2 Comment: But how about that for again the awareness and the passing and the vision\n13:5 Comment: and the speed of which\n13:7 Comment: Manchester City do that.\n13:9 Comment: Great awareness from Sterling.

    "summary": "The Etihad Stadium welcomed Premier League action between Manchester City and Watford. Touted as a match that Manchester City should win comfortably, the memories of their unexpected defeat against Stoke City a year ago lingered. Manuel Pellegrini's pre-match press conference bore no distractions as he focused entirely on this game. Under the drive of breaking records, City sought their fourth win on the bounce and the opportunity to achieve a club-first of ten consecutive league winsâa record that stood for over a century.\n\nThe game began with City asserting their dominance, enjoying substantial possession from the off. Raheem Sterling and David Silva were pivotal in driving forward attacks, constantly probing the Watford defense. Sterling's swift footwork left Neom playing catch-up early on, while Silva operated magic down the field, creating City's first corner within the opening moments. City's intent was clear; they wanted to score early and unsettle a determined Watford defense.\n\nWatfordâs game plan was to weather City's initial onslaught. The Hornets' execution of a defensive strategy was critical in the early exchanges, stopping City's fluid incursions. Aguero and Kompany steadfastly tried to make their mark, pushing Watford onto the back foot. City repeatedly won back possession high up the field, setting a relentless pace. Even the fullbacks, Neom and Holabas, found themselves pressured and outmaneuvered, with Cityâs Sania making a strong showing in starting roles due to Zabaleta's injury.\n\nDespite the relentless assault, Watford managed to fend off the immediate threat through resolute defending and timely interceptions. The gameâs tone was set, with a high line of pressing from City and tactical fouls committed to break up the opposing play. Challenges came thick and fast with players like Toure and Sagna cutting off potential counterattacks. Mark Clattenburg managed the game with allowances and timely warnings rather than early bookings, maintaining the flow of the spirited contest.\n\nManchester City's offensive barrage saw several close chances. Aguero, Sterling, and Silva navigated near blocking defenders, setting up critical scoring opportunities. A notable moment arrived when Aguero almost capitalized on a misplaced clearance, while Neom's struggles allowed City more space. Pellegrini, realizing that a subtle tweak was necessary, unleashed the guile of Silva who floated balls that tested Watfordâs last lines of defense continuously.\n\nThough Watford launched some promising counters, spearheaded by the likes of Deeney and Igalo, topside teamwork from Kolarov and tight defensive actions from Fernandinho thwarted many attempts. The visitorsâ occasional spurts put Cityâs assertiveness to the test, but by the time they got to Cityâs final third, the lack of a forward target hindered any real threat to Joe Hart's goal.\n\nAs the half approached its end, Raheem Sterling found himself consistently near goal-scoring opportunities but was ultimately halted by Watfordâs concerted defensive efforts and key saves from goalkeeper, Gomez. Silvaâs wizardry on the ball continuously dissected Watfordâs formation but did not reflect on the scoreline. Despite dominating 65% of the possession, the first half concluded goalless.\n\nThe second half mirrored the first with City persistently plotting their breakthrough. Substituting in Samir Nasri for Navas changed the gameâs dynamics, offering City a more substantial goal threat. Within a minute of restarting, Raheem Sterling rewarded this decision. Watfordâs lapse in concentration allowed Sterling, seizing on a sublime cross from Sagna, to cushion the ball with precise control past Gomez for his first City goal. The deadlock was broken, and Cityâs persistence had finally borne fruit.\n\nWatford now faced a crucial decisionâstick or twist. Flores had to tweak his formation and urged his team forward. Troy Deeney, previously positioned alongside his right-back, moved higher to challenge City's defenders. Coupled with strategic substitutions like Harada and Anya, Watford revamped their shape to mirror a more offensive outlook but continued to face City's high pressure game.\n\nCityâs second goal came shortly after, thanks to Fernandinho's thunderous strike. Off a deflected set-piece from David Silva, Fernandinho pounced to unleash a powerful shot that burst through Gomez's defenses. This was his second consecutive goal at home, further embedding the deep midfield contribution consistent in City's setup.\n\nWith scorelines now favorable, City adjusted their gameplay to control the midfield. Silva continued his fluid passing from a wider position while Nasri on the other side maintained Cityâs attacking width. Watford's attempts to falter City through crosses and set-pieces were adeptly managed by Kompany and Mangala.\n\nAs Watford's resistance dulled, Pellegrini substituted fresh legs into the game, introducing Fabian Delph alongside other tactical adjustments, keeping Cityâs aggression upfront. Meanwhile, Watford's Laun and Diamante attempted to inject more life into their offense; their contributions were noted, but fundamentally ineffective against a robust City defense. Notably, Laun's attempt within the box presented Watfordâs best chance, but timely interventions from Sagna and Kompany maintained City's clean sheet.\n\nMuch of the action in final minutes were operational maneuvers. Pellegrini ensured maximum energy levels through calculated substitutions. Delph maintained City's tempo, releasing Aguero into more attacking zones. An impactful performance from Nasri highlighted City's wealth in talent, setting up several promising scenarios. Physically and strategically outmaneuvering their opponents, City looked increasingly comfortable.\n\nA promising debut for Kelechi Iheanacha added excitement in the end stages. The 18-year-old Nigerian entered to a roar of home supporters, a symbolic gesture of Cityâs present successes and future promise. Sterlingâs withdrawal gifted the future potential its moment, showcasing City's developmental depth.\n\nThe game concluded with City firmly in control, maintaining both a clean sheet and their winning streak, inching closer to breaking the age-old club record. Finishing 2-0, they showcased tactical mastery and disciplined defending, ensuring their position at the league summit was well-earned. Watford, now devoid of an unbeaten start, left aspiring for a tactical rethink in the upcoming fixtures against more league-compatible adversaries. Their stoic defense akin to resolve faced a probing City that title aspirations could galvanize. The Etihad witnessed a game emblematic of their relentless drive as they registered another spirited, comprehensive victory.\n\nThus, Manchester City 2-0 Watford detailed not only the triumph but their emblematic fortitude as table-toppers, insightfully portraying a narrative of tactical evolution and unprecedented ambition under Pellegriniâs reign."
