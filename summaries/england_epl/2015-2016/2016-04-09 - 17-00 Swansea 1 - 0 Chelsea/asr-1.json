He likes to hug that touchline,\n3:40 Comment: he likes to get one-on-one with his defender.\n3:45 Comment: One of the reasons he hasn't been playing lately is that Francesco Guido\n3:49 Comment: wants more defensively from Jefferson Monteiro.\n3:55 Comment: It can be a bit difficult if you're that sort of player.\n3:58 Comment: There you see, defensively commits the foul, right on cue.\n4:3 Comment: Some players can do it, some players find it a struggle to do both.\n4:11 Comment: First touch not very good, tries to close down, very late in there.\n4:14 Comment: Good dive.\n4:19 Comment: Interesting seeing Aspilicueta operate at right-back again.\n4:22 Comment: That of course is his natural position, but he's been a left-back for so long\n4:25 Comment: that he's mainly used to working on the other side of the pitch.\n4:30 Comment: Oh, you! Another promising run, but it comes to nothing.\n4:34 Comment: That's what I was talking about, getting in those areas and just making it count.\n4:43 Comment: This is Oscar.\n4:47 Comment: Ruben Loftus-Cheek.\n4:49 Comment: Aspilicueta.\n4:53 Comment: Malfabregas.\n5:0 Comment: Malfabregas has seen the run, he's found Oscar.\n5:6 Comment: Now it's Ruben Loftus-Cheek and the first bit of work for Fabianski to do.\n5:10 Comment: It was all too easy, wasn't it, there for Chelsea to breach that Swansea defence?\n5:14 Comment: The run by Oscar was a good one to start with.\n5:17 Comment: Somebody turned the other way to start with, but the ball he plays is a good one.\n5:20 Comment: And look how deep they are.\n5:21 Comment: Nobody comes out to him from right at the last minute.\n5:24 Comment: He got a little bit more behind that, that could have been a different story.\n5:31 Comment: Ruben Loftus-Cheek building up his game time.\n5:34 Comment: Gustav Hiddink says he wants him to suffer, but he's doing him a favour by leaving him on.\n5:39 Comment: He hopes for a good 90 minutes here today, whether he cramps up or not.\n5:44 Comment: He's told Loftus-Cheek that cramp is good for you.\n5:48 Comment: As he looks to build game time, the teenager who's come from the academy.\n5:53 Comment: Doesn't feel like it when you get it, believe me.\n5:58 Comment: I say teenager's 20 now, of course, Ruben Loftus-Cheek.\n6:2 Comment: Should be full of running, should be full of energy.\n6:10 Comment: That's Fernandez.\n6:13 Comment: Chelsea! Chelsea!\n6:21 Comment: Ashley Williams.\n6:26 Comment: Leroy Fir has been impressive since making the loan switch to Swansea City.\n6:30 Comment: Plovdski with plenty to do, Pedro after him.\n6:35 Comment: Now Rangel.\n6:37 Comment: No-one there to pick up the pieces for Swansea City, but Arjou gets to it.\n6:42 Comment: And this is Jefferson Monteiro.\n6:45 Comment: Monteiro looking to scoop that towards Plovdski.\n6:50 Comment: Jack Cork came crashing in for Swansea City, who have got Chelsea penned in here.\n6:56 Comment: Monteiro gets it back from Gilfi Sigurdsson.\n7:1 Comment: Miascu who made the challenge for Chelsea.\n7:3 Comment: Promising stuff though from Swansea.\n7:5 Comment: A bit sloppy from Chelsea, giving the ball away in bad areas at the back there.\n7:18 Comment: Ball for the referee, not interested as Fernandez, trying to chip that through.\n7:26 Comment: Really good involvement from Fernandez, broke forward, caused all sorts of problems there.\n7:34 Comment: Chelsea! Chelsea!\n7:39 Comment: Does look like Swansea City are safe now, 10 points above trouble.\n7:42 Comment: They've not been playing with the Swansea swagger we've seen in recent years,\n7:46 Comment: but they've got the job done, almost.\n7:49 Comment: The only thing is, Sunderland and Newcastle have a game in hand, haven't they?\n7:56 Comment: If they both win that game in hand, it puts a little bit more pressure on,\n8:0 Comment: but they've got to win those games first.\n8:4 Comment: Francesco Guido is down below, having a word with the fourth official.\n8:9 Comment: Still contesting.\n8:12 Comment: That decision didn't go his way with the handball a few moments ago.\n8:23 Comment: Piloski's made his move here, and Piloski was onside.\n8:27 Comment: That's good goalkeeping for you, alert, spotting the danger early, coming out, snuffing it.\n8:33 Comment: Right out.\n8:41 Comment: Real good work ethic early in this game from Swansea.\n8:44 Comment: Nearly closing Chelsea down, not allowing them to play, forcing a mistake there.\n8:55 Comment: Gilfie Sigurdsson.\n8:57 Comment: Ball has remained in play, despite the protestations of the Swansea City fans on that side of the pitch.\n9:2 Comment: This is Jefferson Monteiro, what's on his mind here?\n9:7 Comment: That's Pellegrato for company.\n9:9 Comment: Monteiro, or Dbegovic, who's down sharply.\n9:14 Comment: Again, Monteiro, all he wants to do is back you into the box,\n9:17 Comment: and he's done it on a couple of occasions so far.\n9:19 Comment: You've just got to try and force him outside the box.\n9:21 Comment: There, he gets inside.\n9:22 Comment: Once he gets inside with his trickery, you're just right on a knife's edge of the defender.\n9:27 Comment: You don't want to dive in.\n9:29 Comment: Get away with it this time.\n9:33 Comment: Go on, then!\n9:38 Comment: His old boss in Ecuador used to say about Jefferson Monteiro\n9:41 Comment: that sometimes he just wants to play for himself rather than be a team player,\n9:45 Comment: but he's got the ability to light up a football stadium, Jefferson Monteiro.\n9:49 Comment: No question about that.\n9:51 Comment: Without a doubt.\n9:52 Comment: But again, you're looking for consistency at the highest level,\n9:55 Comment: and what he's heard about Ayoub and Monteiro,\n9:58 Comment: they've just got to get it more on a regular basis.\n10:1 Comment: Great to watch when they get it right, but not so good when they get it wrong.\n10:7 Comment: Sigurdsson was caught.\n10:20 Comment: Sigurdsson going in.\n10:22 Comment: Just clips him as his foot lands there.\n10:24 Comment: Fabregas, not intentional.\n10:27 Comment: I understand why he's shaking his head a little bit.\n10:29 Comment: They were both going for the ball.\n10:33 Comment: Two midfielders who are hugely influential for their respective teams.\n10:38 Comment: Gilby Sigurdsson at times has led the charge single-handedly towards safety for Swansea City.\n10:43 Comment: Yeah, top scorer, double figures.\n10:46 Comment: Olympian a bit in that centre circle at the moment.\n10:49 Comment: That will be a concern.\n10:55 Comment: Given away sloppily by Cork, who's after Ruben Loftus-Cheek here.\n10:58 Comment: Loftus-Cheek was caught, the referee says clean challenge by Fernandes.\n11:2 Comment: He gets Jack Cork off the hook.\n11:4 Comment: Huge sigh of relief from Jack Cork, holds his hand up and apologises.\n11:8 Comment: No need to take chances in those areas, by the percentages.\n11:24 Comment: Antonio Conte has been in London this week\n11:27 Comment: and is taking power at Stamford Bridge.\n11:29 Comment: He's met the players, he's spoken to Gus Hiddink\n11:31 Comment: and started to put the blueprint together for Chelsea's future.\n11:35 Comment: He spent four days in London and will now watch on.\n11:40 Comment: We'll be looking to see his new team finish the season strongly.\n11:46 Comment: Four days in London.\n11:48 Comment: I'd like to know what the conversation was between him and Hiddink\n11:51 Comment: and how long they spent together going through the squad,\n11:54 Comment: going through the whole of the playing squad from top to bottom.\n11:58 Comment: I'm sure there was a lot of honesty there, as there should be.\n12:4 Comment: Oscar.\n12:7 Comment: Ashley Williams, dug his heels in.\n12:10 Comment: This is John Obi McHale.\n12:13 Comment: He's looked a different player under Gus Hiddink.\n12:17 Comment: That's Pellequeta.\n12:25 Comment: Fabregas.\n12:27 Comment: They worked it nicely here.\n12:28 Comment: Chelsea just not enough on it to find out Pellequeta,\n12:30 Comment: but Chelsea will have a corner.\n12:31 Comment: That's like the Chelsea of old, isn't it?\n12:34 Comment: One touch around that 18-yard box, a lot of good movement.\n12:38 Comment: A way to pass very good.\n12:40 Comment: Just good defending by Taylor in the end.\n12:42 Comment: Mawoska's picked up a pocket of space here\n12:44 Comment: and almost picked out the back of the net.\n12:46 Comment: Swansea City look to switch off yet again from another set-piece.\n12:49 Comment: You can't do that.\n12:50 Comment: Once a drop-two-two, you can't do that.\n12:52 Comment: Once a drop-two-deep, switched off when Oscar got in before this time.\n12:58 Comment: Done quickly, it's done short.\n13:0 Comment: Mawoska just reaching there, stretching,\n13:2 Comment: just trying to lob it over the keeper.\n13:4 Comment: Just a little bit too much on it.\n13:8 Comment: Defending corners is something that Swansea City\n13:11 Comment: have really struggled to deal with this season.\n13:14 Comment: It's unforgivable when you just switch off\n13:16 Comment: and you don't concentrate, you don't watch.\n13:18 Comment: The players have got their back towards the ball there.\n13:20 Comment: You can't do that.\n13:21 Comment: You have to expect everything.\n13:27 Comment: There's Loftus-Cheek.\n13:31 Comment: The American centre-half, Matt Miasga.\n13:33 Comment: A little bit of a surprise signing in the January transfer window\n13:36 Comment: from New York Red Bulls.\n13:43 Comment: Now it's Pato.\n13:45 Comment: Oscar calling for it.\n13:51 Comment: There's Fabregas.\n13:54 Comment: Oscar stepping away from Montero.\n13:58 Comment: Pedro, Loftus-Cheek.\n14:0 Comment: Chelsea tiptoeing forward again here.\n14:2 Comment: Montero put that challenge in to make life awkward for Azpilicueta.\n14:5 Comment: And then commits the foul on Taylor.\n14:7 Comment: You can see Montero trying his best to do the best for his team there\n14:11 Comment: at the back by defending, but he finds it difficult.\n14:14 Comment: A couple of times there he missed out.\n14:17 Comment: He tries to go in there, misses it.\n14:21 Comment: And there's the pressure taken off by a little nudge.\n14:26 Comment: Azpilicueta.\n14:29 Comment: I don't think Guss Hiddink was too enamoured with that challenge from Montero.\n14:32 Comment: The attempt at the challenge from Montero.\n14:34 Comment: He's having a word with the fourth official and now with Andre Mariner as well.\n14:37 Comment: I don't think he was that high, to be fair.\n14:39 Comment: I think he slid in there.\n14:41 Comment: An attempt to get the ball, but he's not the best tackler you'll ever see.\n14:50 Comment: Kork.\n14:53 Comment: John Obi Mikel looking to hold off Gilfie Sigurdsson.\n14:55 Comment: Sigurdsson won the duel.\n14:58 Comment: And Pedro likewise for Chelsea.\n15:0 Comment: Here's Pato. Pedro's on his way.\n15:7 Comment: Both teams giving the ball away so much at the moment.\n15:12 Comment: And really, in areas of game, that's going to hurt them.\n15:14 Comment: At their game, no need to give it away so sloppily.\n15:19 Comment: Could be trouble this for Swansea City.\n15:20 Comment: Oskar's low cross.\n15:23 Comment: And getting across is Mann at the front post.\n15:24 Comment: Trying to connect with it was Ruben Loftus-Cheek.\n15:26 Comment: It will be another Chelsea corner.\n15:28 Comment: Excellent from Loftus-Cheek there.\n15:29 Comment: Love to see players get across that near post.\n15:33 Comment: Lovely ball in by Oskar.\n15:34 Comment: Great pace on it, but brilliant defending in the end, you have to say.\n15:37 Comment: From Fernandes.\n15:43 Comment: Oskar with the deep corner, which misses everybody.\n15:46 Comment: Again.\n15:48 Comment: You just don't expect that sort of delivery from somebody of his quality.\n15:51 Comment: Offside against Loftus-Cheek.\n15:57 Comment: Your old team-mate Martin O'Neill used to say to his strikers,\n15:59 Comment: there are a good 10 goals to be had by making those runs across the near post.\n16:3 Comment: Of course there is.\n16:4 Comment: And not many players do it nowadays.\n16:7 Comment: All it needs with a delivery like that is a slight touch.\n16:11 Comment: Because the pace of the ball does it all for you.\n16:13 Comment: All you have to do is make contact and get it on target.\n16:19 Comment: Go on, go on!\n16:39 Comment: There's Miasga.\n16:41 Comment: Straight to Jefferson Montero, and there's a gap in the middle here.\n16:44 Comment: It's Gilfie Sigurdsson!\n16:46 Comment: And Begovic comes up with the answer.\n16:48 Comment: You watch his position there, Begovic, it's absolutely superb.\n16:51 Comment: He comes down right to the...\n16:53 Comment: Just outside his six-yard box to narrow the angle down.\n16:57 Comment: Swansea City on the front foot again!\n16:59 Comment: And Begovic is quickly off his line.\n17:0 Comment: Chelsea had a man down on the far side with Pedro hitting the pitch.\n17:6 Comment: Swansea City not done yet.\n17:7 Comment: Another bit of space here for Gilfie Sigurdsson.\n17:9 Comment: He tries to slalom his way through.\n17:12 Comment: And Chelsea breathe a sigh of relief.\n17:15 Comment: Well, what a couple of opportunities this was.\n17:19 Comment: And the ball is brilliant.\n17:20 Comment: The first touch is superb.\n17:21 Comment: But look where his position is there, Begovic.\n17:23 Comment: Just outside his six-yard box.\n17:25 Comment: Look at that.\n17:26 Comment: Again, the touch is not a bad one.\n17:28 Comment: But the finish, not so good.\n17:30 Comment: Scuffs it a little bit, Rangel.\n17:33 Comment: Doesn't even go close, does it?\n17:40 Comment: A couple of promising moments, though, for Swansea City.\n17:42 Comment: Rangel will get forward.\n17:43 Comment: We know that.\n17:45 Comment: When you get in those positions, you've got to do a little bit better.\n17:49 Comment: Yes, he's a right full-back.\n17:51 Comment: But at least hit the target.\n17:55 Comment: Worked Begovic.\n18:1 Comment: The thing is there, if Begovic makes a save,\n18:3 Comment: he could just rebound to one of his teammates.\n18:5 Comment: But by doing what he did, not even hitting the target,\n18:7 Comment: he's got a chance to score.\n18:10 Comment: He's caught a glimpse there of Francesco Guidolin.\n18:12 Comment: And as we mentioned, Chelsea have sorted their managerial future out.\n18:15 Comment: Nowhere yet from Swansea on their situation.\n18:19 Comment: Francesco Guidolin's contract runs to June, he says.\n18:21 Comment: As soon as they are mathematically safe,\n18:23 Comment: he will go and knock on Hugh Jenkins' door and ask\n18:25 Comment: what is going on with his future and Swansea's future.\n18:28 Comment: Brendan Rodgers, the man who's been a great help to the team,\n18:31 Comment: is now in the position to be a manager.\n18:33 Comment: He's got a chance to score.\n18:36 Comment: What is going on with his future and Swansea's future?\n18:39 Comment: Brendan Rodgers still a firm favourite to take over here.\n18:42 Comment: Chris Coleman's name mentioned as well.\n18:52 Comment: Francesco Guidolin has almost done what he was asked to do,\n18:55 Comment: and that is to keep Swansea City in the Premier League.\n18:57 Comment: Far off the safety line now.\n18:59 Comment: You talk about head coaches, managers, call them what you like.\n19:2 Comment: You always mention, my old gaffer Brian Clough used to say,\n19:5 Comment: Directors or owners have got to get one decision right,\n19:7 Comment: pick the right manager.\n19:8 Comment: Nothing else, just pick the right manager.\n19:12 Comment: Swansea City and Hugh Jenkins, more often than not, have got it right.\n19:16 Comment: I just think there is an over-obsession with foreign managers coming in the Premier League.\n19:22 Comment: At times.\n19:24 Comment: Not just in the Premier League now.\n19:30 Comment: Ruben Loftus-Cheek, picked up here by Oscar,\n19:32 Comment: who is stopped in his tracks firmly by Ashley Williams.\n19:35 Comment: How many times has that been said this season?\n19:37 Comment: Stopped firmly in his tracks by Ashley Williams.\n19:40 Comment: Great leader out there.\n19:44 Comment: For me, one of the best in the Premier League at doing that.\n19:46 Comment: Vocal, puts his body on the line every time he goes out on the pitch,\n19:50 Comment: as you should do.\n19:52 Comment: But not always every player does that.\n19:54 Comment: He's yet another player, Ashley Williams, who learnt his trade coming up through the Football League.\n20:5 Comment: Comes with Stockport County before the switch to Swansea.\n20:14 Comment: Oscar Williams.\n20:19 Comment: Moved on by Sigurdsson, here's Polosky.\n20:22 Comment: Jack Cork trying to feed that ball through to Polosky,\n20:25 Comment: that's where he likes to be, running between defenders.\n20:29 Comment: He does cause problems with that.\n20:31 Comment: He's always on the move.\n20:33 Comment: When his teammates are in possession, he's trying to move defenders around.\n20:39 Comment: Fabregas, Oscar, Loftus-Cheek, Fabregas again.\n20:45 Comment: Badaraman is trying to get the better of Rangel,\n20:47 Comment: and no takers in the middle for Chelsea.\n20:52 Comment: That's a better ball right across the face of the goal.\n20:55 Comment: Previous one he did nothing with, but that one he did a lot better.\n21:0 Comment: A little bit lucky here, just gets the benefit of that rebound.\n21:3 Comment: Thinking it happened so quick, nobody could actually get across,\n21:6 Comment: and in the end, there was just too much fire on that ball.\n21:12 Comment: Pretty much a farewell tour again for Gust Hiddink.\n21:16 Comment: Miaska was just caught there by a high boot, by Jefferson Monteiro.\n21:27 Comment: But unlikely, apparently, will Sigurdsson get a management role again.\n21:30 Comment: He wants to end his career helping young players\n21:34 Comment: in youth academies at a club that will give him the chance.\n21:39 Comment: He's got a lot to offer in that capacity, I think.\n21:46 Comment: Maybe he does it in this country, in one of our academies.\n21:53 Comment: I'm still not sure about the academy system in this country,\n21:56 Comment: how it's run.\n21:58 Comment: There's a lot to look at, to turn it round and get it right.\n22:3 Comment: You want the best people in charge.\n22:6 Comment: Swansea City on the charge here.\n22:9 Comment: Andre Ayoub, well he made life awkward there for Chelsea's\n22:12 Comment: back four.\n22:13 Comment: In by Monteiro, and just over the head of Andre Ayoub.\n22:17 Comment: Such a positive opening by Swansea City.\n22:21 Comment: He'll get the ball out to Monteiro, he is causing problems,\n22:24 Comment: but they are giving Swansea the opportunity, Chelsea,\n22:27 Comment: by giving the ball straight back to them at times.\n22:32 Comment: This is Loftus-Cheek, now it's Oscar.\n22:38 Comment: Oscar gets away from Leroy Ferguson,\n22:40 Comment: another really good ball in, and Pato unable to direct it on target.\n22:45 Comment: Strikers dream, that ball was absolutely brilliant delivery.\n22:50 Comment: There's the ball in there, just defies Ayoub,\n22:53 Comment: just a little bit too high for him.\n22:57 Comment: The ball in by Oscar.\n22:59 Comment: You feel Pato could have taken it first time, maybe gambled a bit,\n23:4 Comment: trying to get a touch under control.\n23:6 Comment: Probably not at his sharpest right now,\n23:8 Comment: his last competitive game before last week was in November,\n23:11 Comment: he's gone through a little bit of a mini pre-season.\n23:14 Comment: At Stamford Bridge, training twice a day.\n23:20 Comment: No Leric Remy here today, he's injured,\n23:22 Comment: Diego Costa serving the additional game to his ban.\n23:30 Comment: This is Monteiro and Begovic,\n23:33 Comment: gets a big left hand to it, but he was concerned.\n23:39 Comment: He does well in the end, doesn't he?\n23:43 Comment: Gaines on this left-hand side, the problems are coming.\n23:45 Comment: Flipped in there again, spots it early, that's all he has to do,\n23:49 Comment: he's confident in what he's doing there.\n23:51 Comment: He knows what's around him.\n23:55 Comment: Just gets his little bit of luck.\n23:57 Comment: At least he committed himself.\n24:0 Comment: Fabregas looking to pull the strings,\n24:2 Comment: van Gaal watching that.\n24:4 Comment: That's excellent defending,\n24:6 Comment: and the way with which he's headed back to his goalkeeper.\n24:9 Comment: He knows there's somebody behind him as well.\n24:12 Comment: That's presented with a special memento before kick-off here,\n24:15 Comment: after last weekend's 300th league game for this club.\n24:23 Comment: It's a bit of a bit of a mess,\n24:25 Comment: but it's a great league game for this club.\n24:30 Comment: Polosky.\n24:32 Comment: Gilvie Sigurdsson.\n24:34 Comment: This now is Jefferson Monteiro.\n24:37 Comment: Monteiro, away from Aspilicueta,\n24:39 Comment: but Aspilicueta is back to put the block on.\n24:44 Comment: One-three, a move by the handball appeals,\n24:46 Comment: Monteiro again, he's asking questions,\n24:48 Comment: and that is fired home brilliantly and beautifully by Gilvie Sigurdsson.\n24:54 Comment: He has led Swansea City's charge to safety,\n24:57 Comment: at times, almost single-handedly.\n25:0 Comment: But it's Monteiro again, isn't it?\n25:1 Comment: Causing all sorts of problems.\n25:3 Comment: Jinking one way, jinking the other.\n25:5 Comment: But again, you have to ask questions of that Chelsea defence.\n25:9 Comment: Do they never learn?\n25:10 Comment: They let Monteiro back them into the penalty box,\n25:13 Comment: and when he gets in there, you'll see what he does.\n25:17 Comment: There, he checks and turns,\n25:18 Comment: previously that he got in the box, this time he didn't.\n25:20 Comment: But there, the head is not a good one, but the strike's a cracker.\n25:23 Comment: The defender on the edge of the six-yard box,\n25:25 Comment: to take that on, it hits his shin, yes, but he hits the target.\n25:29 Comment: Mlakavic has got no chance.\n25:31 Comment: It's all about Monteiro.\n25:33 Comment: Twists and turns, does two of them, nearly slips,\n25:35 Comment: but gets the ball in, makes defenders defend.\n25:38 Comment: It's a difficult ball to get cleared at.\n25:41 Comment: There's the clip, he's at full strength,\n25:43 Comment: just puts it straight back in an area where it's going to be dangerous,\n25:47 Comment: especially when Sigurdsson's on the end of it.\n25:50 Comment: Quality finish, quality player.\n25:53 Comment: Nine goals in 14 games for Gilvey Sigurdsson.\n25:57 Comment: In this calendar year, only Harry Kane and Sergio Aguero\n25:59 Comment: have scored more Premier League goals since the turn of the year\n26:3 Comment: than Sigurdsson.\n26:5 Comment: The problem was not just the cross that created the problem for Chelsea,\n26:9 Comment: just before then, he picked it up,\n26:11 Comment: and Chelsea let him back them into the box,\n26:13 Comment: where he's going to cause you all sorts of problems,\n26:15 Comment: keep him outside that 18-yard box.\n26:20 Comment: It's a difficult game.\n26:26 Comment: Ivanovic.\n26:29 Comment: As Gary mentioned, Jevison Monteiro again showing his worth to Swansea City.\n26:35 Comment: Swansea City fans have been wondering why he hasn't been getting his opportunity.\n26:40 Comment: We mentioned earlier on, Francesco Guidolin wanted more defensively from him.\n26:44 Comment: Wants to get the balance right in the team.\n26:47 Comment: He can deliver assists like that, moments like that,\n26:52 Comment: he can be a game-changer, a match winner.\n26:55 Comment: What would you rather him do?\n26:56 Comment: Would you rather him hook the touchline further up,\n26:58 Comment: get possession of the ball, destroy defenders in that final third,\n27:2 Comment: or would you want him tracking back,\n27:3 Comment: helping out where he can't, then get forward and cause his havoc?\n27:8 Comment: I used to play with a guy called John Robertson,\n27:10 Comment: the best I ever played with, who used to do that.\n27:13 Comment: He never used to come back and help.\n27:14 Comment: He had somebody else to do that.\n27:17 Comment: Get your best players doing what they do best.\n27:22 Comment: Well, Chelsea had a couple of nibbles there at Leroy Fir.\n27:32 Comment: Used to seeing that from Mikel.\n27:34 Comment: He's one of those who breaks play up.\n27:36 Comment: He's only going for the ball there.\n27:39 Comment: Rupert gets to start with.\n27:40 Comment: It's a little bit of trickery,\n27:42 Comment: and it's just total obstruction, isn't it?\n27:45 Comment: Just blocks him off.\n27:52 Comment: Gilfie Sigurdsson standing over this for Swansea City.\n27:58 Comment: Trying to pick out Fernandes, but Babaramin had seen the move.\n28:4 Comment: This is Pedro.\n28:11 Comment: Williams.\n28:14 Comment: Peloski curving his run, has remained onside.\n28:17 Comment: That was all he could do, really,\n28:19 Comment: as he had to stretch to keep the ball in play.\n28:21 Comment: But not the most convincing from Miaska,\n28:23 Comment: the US defender, who's helped out by Ivanovic.\n28:26 Comment: So defenders hate what Peloski does to them.\n28:29 Comment: He runs into channels, he makes bad balls into good balls.\n28:35 Comment: Actually, Williams knows that.\n28:36 Comment: He just left that ball in there,\n28:37 Comment: knowing that his teammate would run it down.\n28:49 Comment: Koc.\n28:56 Comment: That was Jevison Monteiro.\n28:58 Comment: Mosca snapping him with a challenge that time.\n29:8 Comment: Swansea have won three of their last five\n29:10 Comment: to get themselves away from danger.\n29:14 Comment: They just now want to make sure they see this job through.\n29:17 Comment: They hit the 40-point mark.\n29:22 Comment: RU hunting down Babaramin.\n29:27 Comment: Fabregas.\n29:29 Comment: Babaramin again was pulled back,\n29:31 Comment: and that will be a yellow card for Angel Rangel.\n29:34 Comment: Yeah, he knows it straight away.\n29:38 Comment: Easy one there for the referee.\n29:41 Comment: Bit of acceleration there from Rahman.\n29:43 Comment: Pulls him out.\n29:45 Comment: See there, when he gets, he accelerates away.\n29:47 Comment: There's the pull.\n29:48 Comment: Could have stayed on his feet.\n29:49 Comment: He was going into a clear patch of ground there.\n30:2 Comment: Miaska.\n30:8 Comment: That's for Likweta.\n30:11 Comment: Ruben Loftus-Cheek dropping a little bit deep here.\n30:14 Comment: He's seen as a box-to-box midfielder.\n30:16 Comment: Fabregas with the ball to Pato, and now it's Pedro.\n30:21 Comment: Ruben Loftus-Cheek.\n30:26 Comment: Fabregas.\n30:31 Comment: This is Pedro, and now it's a yellow card for Angel Rangel.\n30:34 Comment: This is Pedro, and Neil Taylor getting his head to it,\n30:37 Comment: but Oscar will pick up the pieces for Chelsea.\n30:40 Comment: Taylor wins that duel too.\n30:42 Comment: Chelsea settle for the corner.\n30:44 Comment: He's in possession, Oscar.\n30:46 Comment: He's so silky, isn't he?\n30:48 Comment: So difficult to judge what he's going to do as a defender.\n30:51 Comment: Pedro needs to get involved a little bit more.\n30:53 Comment: I think that's one of the first couple of times\n30:55 Comment: you've mentioned him in this first half.\n30:59 Comment: Fabregas, poor corner in the end.\n31:0 Comment: From the Chelsea man.\n31:2 Comment: Get the live bounce for Likweta.\n31:4 Comment: Offside though against Miazga.\n31:6 Comment: How many times commentators and co-commentators\n31:8 Comment: have said that this season, a poor corner.\n31:10 Comment: The number you see that just don't beat that first man.\n31:18 Comment: Some of these Chelsea players may be concerned\n31:20 Comment: about their futures after meeting with Antonio Conte.\n31:24 Comment: Also, they're often failing to show up in the first half.\n31:27 Comment: They're not going to be able to get a chance\n31:28 Comment: to win the title.\n31:30 Comment: Also, they're often failing to show up\n31:32 Comment: in the title defence this season.\n31:34 Comment: It could be the worst title defence ever\n31:36 Comment: by a reigning Premier League champion.\n31:38 Comment: That dubious honour at the moment is shared\n31:40 Comment: between Blackburn, Rovers and Manchester United\n31:42 Comment: who both finished seventh in their respective defences.\n31:47 Comment: As Alex Ferguson said at the start of the next pre-season,\n31:49 Comment: he'd look into his players' eyes\n31:51 Comment: and see if they had the hunger, the desire\n31:53 Comment: to climb that mountain again.\n31:59 Comment: Polosky, are you in the middle?\n32:1 Comment: Fouls his man.\n32:3 Comment: Terrific again by Polosky.\n32:8 Comment: He's on the move all the time.\n32:10 Comment: Could have taken a shot on there\n32:12 Comment: but decided not to.\n32:14 Comment: Put him back in the danger area to help a team-mate out.\n32:16 Comment: Just clips it in.\n32:18 Comment: And it is a foul. He is late.\n32:20 Comment: A decent header under pressure.\n32:22 Comment: But he had a go for it.\n32:29 Comment: Andre Mariner not happy.\n32:34 Comment: Minkovic not too sure what's going on.\n32:36 Comment: I think it's fair to say\n32:38 Comment: Andre Mariner is getting his point across\n32:40 Comment: to Cesc Fabregas and Branislav Ivanovic.\n32:42 Comment: I like that.\n32:44 Comment: From a referee.\n32:46 Comment: The number of times you see players being demonstrative\n32:48 Comment: towards a referee, he's getting his own back.\n32:50 Comment: Eight months of frustration.\n32:52 Comment: Fair play to him.\n32:59 Comment: This is Pedro.\n33:2 Comment: Dribbling.\n33:4 Comment: Not really his game.\n33:6 Comment: He likes to try and get in behind full-backs.\n33:8 Comment: The ball played towards him.\n33:10 Comment: He's got two full-backs though.\n33:12 Comment: Pretty quick.\n33:14 Comment: Pretty aware.\n33:20 Comment: Mantoro in strongly.\n33:22 Comment: Polosky giving chase to this.\n33:24 Comment: Ivanovic in control.\n33:26 Comment: Begovic just about to get it.\n33:28 Comment: But the box remains in control.\n33:30 Comment: He said thanks for that, Ivanovic.\n33:34 Comment: But it stuck right in the middle of his feet there.\n33:39 Comment: Swansea City not hanging around.\n33:41 Comment: Leading here by a goal to nil.\n33:43 Comment: Mantoro's assist for Sigurdsson's volley.\n33:45 Comment: Jefferson Mantoro clips off Asper Equator.\n33:49 Comment: Asper Equator just thinking,\n33:52 Comment: no, not again.\n33:54 Comment: He's coming at me again.\n33:56 Comment: This time he deals with it,\n33:58 Comment: from it.\n34:0 Comment: No good source of supply on this left-hand side\n34:2 Comment: from Mantoro in this first half so far.\n34:9 Comment: Swansea have scored just seven Premier League goals\n34:12 Comment: from set-pieces this season.\n34:14 Comment: Only four teams have managed fewer than that.\n34:17 Comment: It's not really been a strong suit of theirs.\n34:19 Comment: Ashton Williams having to add to that tally now.\n34:24 Comment: Crowd scene.\n34:26 Comment: Penalty area.\n34:28 Comment: He's got to stop this.\n34:31 Comment: Well then, Williams found himself free.\n34:33 Comment: That's Leroy Fir and Chelsea have survived for now.\n34:38 Comment: Mantoro.\n34:40 Comment: Kylvi Sigurdsson, lovely ball.\n34:42 Comment: That could have gone anywhere.\n34:44 Comment: Degovic thankful that Asper Equator\n34:47 Comment: diverted the cross back towards him.\n34:49 Comment: If you want to be a defender,\n34:51 Comment: don't look at how Chelsea defended that.\n34:53 Comment: It's not very good.\n34:55 Comment: A free header there comes through.\n34:56 Comment: Pounced up a little bit on him.\n34:58 Comment: There's the ball put back in.\n35:0 Comment: Again, they don't deal with it well.\n35:2 Comment: They don't get it clear.\n35:4 Comment: Terrific ball driven in there.\n35:6 Comment: They get lucky, Chelsea.\n35:8 Comment: All over the place.\n35:10 Comment: That could have been a lot, lot worse for Chelsea.\n35:12 Comment: This is Oscar.\n35:14 Comment: Fired at Fabregas.\n35:16 Comment: Swansea City with a bit between their teeth here.\n35:18 Comment: Mantoro riding the challenge of Asper Equator.\n35:21 Comment: Then hits the deck.\n35:23 Comment: Asper Equator about to be yellow-carded.\n35:25 Comment: And that will be music to the ears\n35:28 Comment: and also light the eyes up of Jefferson Mantoro.\n35:31 Comment: Yeah, good referee in again.\n35:33 Comment: Again, it's just frustration.\n35:35 Comment: Mantoro again, running at him,\n35:37 Comment: takes him out, knew exactly what he was doing,\n35:39 Comment: left the boot high.\n35:41 Comment: Mantoro, no option to go over.\n35:44 Comment: He's just let him a merry dance in this first half.\n35:47 Comment: But he hasn't had much protection either.\n35:49 Comment: Asper Equator.\n35:50 Comment: Well, Mantoro will keep driving now at Asper Equator\n35:53 Comment: even more so that the Chelsea fullback is on a yellow card.\n36:3 Comment: Baburamun and Begovic leaving it to each other.\n36:6 Comment: This is all you and Begovic down to make the save.\n36:9 Comment: But Chelsea are wobbling here.\n36:11 Comment: He'd got to go with his right foot there.\n36:13 Comment: Really had.\n36:15 Comment: It was almost inside out.\n36:17 Comment: He tries to get his left foot in the box.\n36:18 Comment: Inside out.\n36:20 Comment: He tries to get his left leg right around this.\n36:22 Comment: I mean, it's Pulaski.\n36:24 Comment: I've got his name wrong there.\n36:26 Comment: Pulaski again causes the problem.\n36:28 Comment: Forcing the pressure on to Begovic.\n36:31 Comment: But then when he gets the opportunity,\n36:34 Comment: you've got to use your right foot.\n36:36 Comment: Back yourself.\n36:38 Comment: Pato down on the pitch.\n36:42 Comment: Referee keeping a watch on what's happening.\n36:45 Comment: He's back on his feet now,\n36:46 Comment: and the challenge that was made upon him.\n36:48 Comment: Alexander Pato.\n36:50 Comment: Well, he's telling the referee exactly what he thought happened.\n36:58 Comment: Home fans not impressed.\n37:3 Comment: Didn't get a great deal wrong with that.\n37:7 Comment: Down rather easily there.\n37:10 Comment: Let's go back to Chelsea defensively though, Gary.\n37:12 Comment: No John Terry, no Gary Cahill, no Kurt Zouma.\n37:15 Comment: He's out, of course, for a long time.\n37:17 Comment: Fortunately for Chelsea, Thibaut Courtois on the bench as well.\n37:20 Comment: The heart of that team at the back is missing here.\n37:24 Comment: I can't tell you how important that is\n37:26 Comment: to get that right at the back.\n37:28 Comment: I always say you talk about partnerships with strikers.\n37:30 Comment: So important you get these centre-halves\n37:32 Comment: with a good understanding.\n37:34 Comment: But again, it was Pulaski there\n37:36 Comment: who caused the problem by his persistence.\n37:39 Comment: It looked like it was going to be easy through to Begovic,\n37:42 Comment: but he wasn't having any of it at all.\n37:44 Comment: He put the pressure on.\n37:47 Comment: Loftus-Cheek, this is Furr, now Pulaski.\n37:51 Comment: Leroy Furr again,\n37:53 Comment: upended by John Obi-Maciel.\n37:58 Comment: Yeah, when you have that many injuries of key players out,\n38:1 Comment: it's always going to be difficult to fill those gaps.\n38:4 Comment: Chelsea are finding.\n38:6 Comment: Players out of position a little bit as well.\n38:11 Comment: Some youngsters on the bench.\n38:15 Comment: A reminder that Thibaut Courtois is amongst the substitutes here\n38:19 Comment: for Chelsea.\n38:20 Comment: The decision has been made to start with\n38:22 Comment: Azmir Begovic, who's hugely experienced, of course.\n38:24 Comment: But in front of him,\n38:26 Comment: Ivanovic and Miazga, a new partnership.\n38:29 Comment: They played together last week against Aston Villa.\n38:32 Comment: You see there,\n38:35 Comment: Miazga, very, very sloppy ball.\n38:39 Comment: So Ivanovic put it behind him,\n38:41 Comment: put him under a little bit of pressure.\n38:42 Comment: A real confidence behind it.\n38:47 Comment: It's a harsh place to learn a lesson, the Premier League.\n38:57 Comment: As for La Quetta.\n39:1 Comment: Fabregas, enough purchase on it.\n39:6 Comment: It just looks a lot more desire\n39:8 Comment: on the Swansea team than the Chelsea team, actually.\n39:10 Comment: The Swansea team than the Chelsea team out there.\n39:15 Comment: Montero, a real buzz around the stadium\n39:17 Comment: when he picks up possession.\n39:19 Comment: Miazga, will he foul him? Yes, he did.\n39:21 Comment: And that will be a yellow card\n39:23 Comment: for the American centre-half.\n39:26 Comment: Well, he's saying,\n39:28 Comment: did Montero go down a wee bit easy?\n39:32 Comment: There, he does. No, he grabs him back.\n39:34 Comment: Oh, it's a yellow card every day of the week.\n39:37 Comment: And then he puts his hands up.\n39:38 Comment: I don't know how he's got the nerve\n39:40 Comment: to put his hands up after that.\n39:42 Comment: Not one, two, but three attempts\n39:44 Comment: to drag him back.\n39:46 Comment: Jefferson Montero has now got\n39:48 Comment: two of the Chelsea back four\n39:50 Comment: yellow-carded because of the problems he's causing.\n39:54 Comment: The disappointing thing is\n39:56 Comment: Chelsea aren't learning from it.\n39:58 Comment: They're just letting him dictate.\n40:5 Comment: Nazmiyev Begovic has just been\n40:6 Comment: shielding his eyes from the sun here\n40:8 Comment: as he's watching Taylor and Sigurdsson\n40:10 Comment: stand over this.\n40:14 Comment: Neil Taylor with it,\n40:16 Comment: free header for Leroy Fir\n40:18 Comment: but couldn't generate the power\n40:20 Comment: to cause any problems for Begovic.\n40:22 Comment: It's a really good leap, wasn't it?\n40:24 Comment: He wanted that.\n40:26 Comment: It's clipped up beautifully.\n40:28 Comment: A big leap,\n40:30 Comment: but just couldn't get the desired power behind it.\n40:32 Comment: His own team-mate, Ashley Williams,\n40:34 Comment: gets in the way a little bit there.\n40:36 Comment: He's got to be careful as well.\n40:49 Comment: He's a player who's been renowned\n40:51 Comment: for his power in the air, Leroy Fir.\n40:54 Comment: Tall man in any case,\n40:56 Comment: but he has an excellent leap as well.\n41:1 Comment: You have to say, Chelsea just look like a team\n41:3 Comment: who are waiting for a new manager to come in.\n41:7 Comment: It's as if, right, there's an outside chance\n41:9 Comment: we might get in the Europa League,\n41:11 Comment: but perhaps not a good thing.\n41:16 Comment: Yeah, the Europa League could go down to 7th position\n41:19 Comment: depending on what happens in the FA Cup\n41:21 Comment: and final placings in the Premier League.\n41:24 Comment: Chelsea in 10th position,\n41:26 Comment: just behind at 7th place,\n41:29 Comment: one win away from it.\n41:32 Comment: You just think, well, do they need that next season\n41:34 Comment: with a new manager coming in?\n41:36 Comment: Champions League is their obvious target.\n41:42 Comment: Do they want to just build things\n41:44 Comment: when he comes in and not have the distraction\n41:46 Comment: of all those games in the Europa League?\n41:49 Comment: They have always qualified for Europe\n41:52 Comment: under Roman Abramovich.\n41:58 Comment: Really interesting to see\n42:0 Comment: how many players disappear from Chelsea.\n42:4 Comment: That for me is a yellow card as well.\n42:6 Comment: Yeah, good referee in again.\n42:8 Comment: I had to think about it.\n42:10 Comment: It was a poor challenge by Taylor.\n42:17 Comment: Quite a few players on yellow cards in this first half.\n42:20 Comment: There, just goes straight through the back of him.\n42:22 Comment: There's no need for that whatsoever.\n42:24 Comment: He's going nowhere.\n42:26 Comment: Stay on your feet, get the right side of him.\n42:28 Comment: Force him backwards.\n42:34 Comment: Oscar.\n42:36 Comment: Monteiro.\n42:45 Comment: I love what I saw from Polosky again there.\n42:48 Comment: Held it with his chest, brilliant.\n42:50 Comment: There's Javison Monteiro.\n42:52 Comment: Andre Aliyu goes falling inside the box.\n42:55 Comment: Now it's a goal scorer, Gilfi Sigurdsson.\n42:58 Comment: Nearly dropped for Polosky, didn't it?\n43:0 Comment: It's a goal.\n43:2 Comment: Nearly dropped for Polosky, didn't it?\n43:7 Comment: Rangel, Rangel.\n43:10 Comment: Almost, almost smuggled that through to Sigurdsson.\n43:15 Comment: This is Fabregas swept away from him by Gilfi Sigurdsson.\n43:20 Comment: There's Oscar.\n43:22 Comment: Again, Swansea City, real hunger and desire about them here.\n43:25 Comment: They are hounding Chelsea all over this pitch.\n43:28 Comment: Good advantage played by the referee.\n43:29 Comment: This is Sigurdsson.\n43:32 Comment: A space where there was no Swansea player.\n43:34 Comment: Spotted something we didn't know.\n43:37 Comment: But I said, what, 10 minutes ago,\n43:39 Comment: the desire is so evident between the two teams.\n43:43 Comment: Swansea on the front foot, closing down really well,\n43:48 Comment: putting pressure on Chelsea whenever they get it.\n43:51 Comment: They look a little bit despondent,\n43:53 Comment: the Chelsea players out there at the moment.\n43:55 Comment: Just cannot get into any sort of good form.\n43:57 Comment: Just cannot get into any sort of groove.\n44:6 Comment: Heading towards two additional minutes at the end of this first half.\n44:10 Comment: Swansea started well, then Chelsea had a spell.\n44:12 Comment: And since then, it's been Swansea City,\n44:14 Comment: who in large part of this first half, have been the better team.\n44:17 Comment: Fabianski, almost a spectator back there.\n44:23 Comment: I've seen some nice football though from Chelsea,\n44:25 Comment: some nice approach work.\n44:27 Comment: But no end product.\n44:29 Comment: Pedro's hardly been involved, Pato's hardly been involved.\n44:33 Comment: The usual suspects you're looking at.\n44:35 Comment: Fabregas, Oscar.\n44:37 Comment: The ones who are trying to make things happen.\n44:40 Comment: Noctis' cheek has flitted in and out.\n44:45 Comment: Just got real no momentum going.\n44:48 Comment: Leroy Fair in strongly, here's Piloski.\n44:51 Comment: Andre, are you?\n44:54 Comment: Will be Sigurdsson to his left, likewise Piloski.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: August Hiddink has only ever lost one Premier League game as Chelsea manager\n0:4 Comment: and his two spells in charge Luka Modric of Tottenham had to score the\n0:8 Comment: win in that particular game in his first spell Swansea City on course to defeat\n0:14 Comment: Gus Hiddink here thanks to a strike by Gylfi Sigurdsson and Chelsea made a\n0:18 Comment: switch at half-time Kennedy has come onto the pitch for Matt Miazga and it\n0:21 Comment: looks like Harry John Obi Mikel to centre half. The word scapegoat comes\n0:26 Comment: into mind doesn't it could have been any one of those back four in the first\n0:30 Comment: half for Chelsea coming off. It's a quick way to taint to the cleaners by Montero\n0:47 Comment: well be interesting wasn't it with Mikel slotting in on that right-hand side of the\n0:53 Comment: back four. Chelsea stealing the ball back\n0:56 Comment: here with Ruben Loftus-Cheek on the charge for Chelsea and earning a corner\n1:0 Comment: in front of those travelling Chelsea fans. Pato looking disgusted at his\n1:4 Comment: teammate there took up a good position but it's a decent run stayed on his feet\n1:11 Comment: he's honest there, he needs to get the shot away again who's blocking it\n1:15 Comment: Ashley Williams. Fabregas with the corner and that near post seemed to be\n1:22 Comment: unguarded and Fabregas was aiming for it. Certainly was but again it's the cap\n1:26 Comment: in who spots it gets across deals with it\n1:40 Comment: Fabregas on set-piece duty again and Lucas Fabianski just to get two hands on\n1:45 Comment: it.

Kennedy after him.\n7:35 Comment: And this is Polosky, just got away from him at the last.\n7:39 Comment: And Begovic not happy with Polosky's challenge.\n7:42 Comment: Just back off, Begovic, that's not a foul, he's got to go for that.\n7:48 Comment: That's ridiculous.\n7:51 Comment: Yeah, his touch was heavy, but it's still there to go for.\n7:54 Comment: If his manager sees him not going for it,\n7:57 Comment: Monteiro again causing the problems to start with.\n7:59 Comment: Lovely bit of improvisation, there's the heavy touch,\n8:2 Comment: got to go for it, didn't do anything to him.\n8:4 Comment: Grow up.\n8:6 Comment: It really annoys me when there's no contact, come on.\n8:10 Comment: He has to go for that, and there was nothing really intentional.\n8:12 Comment: No intention about that.\n8:15 Comment: Overreaction, to say the least.\n8:20 Comment: Kennedy trying to make like Orkut, like Orkut here for Ashley Williams.\n8:24 Comment: Almost succeeded as well, but another dual one by the Swansea City skipper.\n8:30 Comment: Bit tasty out there, isn't it?\n8:37 Comment: This now is Oscar.\n8:40 Comment: Ruben Loftus-Cheek.\n8:41 Comment: Fernandes without.\n8:42

Comment: not enough to turn that ball home.\n9:2 Comment: That's where you try your tricks, nothing wrong with it,\n9:4 Comment: just didn't hit the target, but again,\n9:6 Comment: Swansea bring that on themselves, gave the ball away, trying to be too clever.\n9:10 Comment: Lovely way to ball by Loftus-Cheek.\n9:12 Comment: Put on the plate for him there, just can't flick it on the inside.\n9:17 Comment: On that far post, couldn't he have gone with it conventionally?\n9:23 Comment: He's trying to be too extravagant.\n9:26 Comment: Look at the look of disgust on the bench there.\n9:29 Comment: They feel he might have gone for it conventionally rather than trying to be clever with it.\n9:33 Comment: Pato involved right at the end of the first half,\n9:39 Comment: and involved heavily at the start of the second, 45,\n9:42 Comment: leading the Chelsea line here.\n9:53 Comment: Montserrat just wonder how much Kennedy's introduction here can play as a full-back\n9:59 Comment: and further forward as a winger.\n10:1 Comment: Has to do with Jefferson Montserrat.\n10:2 Comment: Has to do with Jefferson Montserrat to give Azpilicueta more protection.\n10:5 Comment: Well, exactly.\n10:6 Comment: I mentioned the Spurs game early in the season here.\n10:9 Comment: Kyle Walker, first off, Montserrat loads space.\n10:12 Comment: Walker not getting a great deal of help.\n10:16 Comment: And similar in the first half of this game.\n10:19 Comment: Too much pressure on Azpilicueta.\n10:28 Comment: At least Montserrat's taking his gloves off as well in the second half.\n10:32 Comment: And he's got a good shot.\n10:34 Comment: Took you 55 minutes of this game to mention that.\n10:36 Comment: You say that every time.\n10:37 Comment: I know.\n10:38 Comment: And they mentioned the fact that he got the one in the first place.\n10:42 Comment: You're leaving it alone a lot more.\n10:44 Comment: Yes.\n10:45 Comment: It's getting to, I mean, it's April now.\n10:49 Comment: Manovic was a little bit deeper than the rest of his back four there,\n10:52 Comment: which could be a concern.\n10:58 Comment: Pedro.\n10:59 Comment: Oscar.\n11:3 Comment: Oscar looking at it with Pedro, but too much on the return ball.\n11:13 Comment: Another who's been linked with a move away, Oscar, away from Chelsea.\n11:16 Comment: We've seen the really best of Oscar at times last season.\n11:23 Comment: Like his teammates, he's had a big, big dip in this campaign.\n11:30 Comment: Is there any better?\n11:38 Comment: The right wing.\n11:39 Comment: Your right wing, Sir.\n11:40 Comment: The right wing.\n11:45 Comment: Ivanovic.\n11:49 Comment: Gionnou Miquel.\n11:51 Comment: APPLAUSE\n11:56 Comment: Angel Rangel.\n11:58 Comment: Signed for this club when they were in the third tier,\n12:1 Comment: when they had no training ground, had to go and train on the beach at times\n12:4 Comment: because they couldn't find a pitch to hire.\n12:9 Comment: This is Jefferson Monteiro, who's skipped away from Kennedy,\n12:13 Comment: delivered the cross, Babaraman got to it before Sigurdsson,\n12:16 Comment: that's Jack Cork, deflected!\n12:18 Comment: Really good save from Azmir Begumic.\n12:20 Comment: That's a cracking save by Begumic.\n12:23 Comment: Difficult because he hit that into the ground.\n12:26 Comment: Good clean strike, but again Monteiro setting things up.\n12:29 Comment: Takes it early here, into the ground, makes it more difficult.\n12:33 Comment: Follows it across.\n12:35 Comment: There, hits it into the...\n12:37 Comment: Just takes a bit of power off, gives him a little bit more of an opportunity.\n12:43 Comment: Pedro, facing his own goal, this is Babaraman.\n12:47 Comment: Well...\n12:49 Comment: What are they doing back there? Just trying to be too clever.\n12:52 Comment: Got away with it, but only just.\n12:59 Comment: Chelsea team, which now has John Obi-Miquel playing as part of the back four.\n13:3 Comment: Has played there before in his career, John Obi-Miquel.\n13:7 Comment: Obviously not, though, his number-one position.\n13:12 Comment: No Gary Cahill, no John Terry.\n13:14 Comment: He's already told Antonio Conte that he wants to go to the top,\n13:19 Comment: but he's not going to.\n13:20 Comment: It'll take a while, they're getting Chelsea firing again.\n13:23 Comment: He doesn't have leaders in the team like Gus Hiddink did when he arrived in 2009,\n13:26 Comment: the likes of Terry and Lampard and Balak and Petr Cech.\n13:32 Comment: You're not the spine of the team you're talking about, aren't you?\n13:38 Comment: Talking about your goalkeeper, your centre-half, your central midfield player.\n13:41 Comment: Take Drogba out of the equation as well, that's the whole spine gone.\n13:45 Comment: And that's what you build teams around, and to lose the whole lot,\n13:48 Comment: that is difficult with those names we've mentioned to replace.\n13:56 Comment: There's the challenge facing Antonio Conte, but he does like a challenge.\n14:1 Comment: He did it with Juventus.\n14:3 Comment: Three successive Scudettos.\n14:5 Comment: That's gone straight to Gylfi Sigurdsson, an important challenge,\n14:9 Comment: and blocked there by Mikel, but fired wide by Ayoub.\n14:12 Comment: Well, again, you have to say, what are Chelsea doing?\n14:15 Comment: CHELSEA FANS ROAR\n14:17 Comment: Just giving the ball away so clumsily at times.\n14:21 Comment: There, look at that, it's a blind pass.\n14:23 Comment: Luckily, Mikel comes across and gets the blocking.\n14:26 Comment: Follow-up was not particularly good, but...\n14:29 Comment: Stavanovic there, just playing a blind ball.\n14:32 Comment: CHELSEA FANS ROAR\n14:46 Comment: Fabregas.\n14:47 Comment: In the middle of the pitch.\n14:58 Comment: CHELSEA FANS ROAR\n15:2 Comment: And Patto...\n15:3 Comment: Williams...\n15:6 Comment: Leroy Fir.\n15:7 Comment: A couple of consecutive relegations from the Premier League\n15:11 Comment: with Greenspar Rangers and Norwich City.\n15:14 Comment: Leroy Fir...\n15:16 Comment: We've got Loftus-Cheek.\n15:22 Comment: Fabregas.\n15:23 Comment: He didn't shoot there, Loftus-Cheek, he had the opportunity.\n15:43 Comment: There's Baba Rahman.\n15:46 Comment: FANS ROAR\n15:51 Comment: Are you?\n15:53 Comment: Jack Cork, he's had a busy game at the heart of the Swansea midfield,\n15:57 Comment: but he's lost out there.\n15:58 Comment: And this is Cesc Fabregas.\n16:0 Comment: Manchester Williams again, sensed the danger, knew exactly where to be.\n16:3 Comment: He certainly did, but Jack Cork having a word with the referee,\n16:6 Comment: he said, I was caught there, and I tend to agree with him.\n16:16 Comment: FANS ROAR\n16:18 Comment: Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Velosky.\n16:21 Comment: Making sure that Fabregas knew he was around him and had to rush it.\n16:25 Comment: Throw-in has gone, Chelsea's way.\n16:27 Comment: Next to the disgust of the Swansea bench.\n16:30 Comment: The assistant wasn't too sure, was he?\n16:32 Comment: I think he was waiting for the referee to make the decision.\n16:34 Comment: FANS ROAR\n16:44 Comment: Salon Kennedy.\n16:45 Comment: It's a presentable position for Chelsea.\n16:50 Comment: Moving the ball quickly, and it's Baba Rahman,\n16:53 Comment: and again no takers in the middle, dangerous ball whipped in.\n16:56 Comment: There's no takers, there's only one player in there.\n16:58 Comment: That's Pato.\n17:0 Comment: Pedro's lurking on the edge of the box, but...\n17:2 Comment: Got to get more in the box.\n17:4 Comment: Chelsea have scored 31 goals in 15 games in the Premier League\n17:11 Comment: since Jose Mourinho left the club.\n17:14 Comment: 18-16...\n17:15 Comment: Well, since Jose left the club,\n17:18 Comment: 18-16 before Jose Mourinho departed Stamford Bridge.\n17:21 Comment: So they have upped their goals ratio, and they need one here.\n17:25 Comment: And now they're up 2-0.\n17:27 Comment: And they're up 2-0.\n17:31 Comment: They're up 2-0.\n17:32 Comment: And they're up 2-0.\n17:33 Comment: They're up 2-0.\n17:33 Comment: And they're up 2-0.\n17:36 Comment: Swansea City are putting the squeeze on.\n17:41 Comment: Chelsea have Bertrand Traore readied.\n17:45 Comment: And he is about to come on here for the visitors.\n17:57 Comment: That's Fernandes.\n18:4 Comment: Again, excellent hold-up play there by Pielowski.\n18:15 Comment: Bertrand Traore will, we understand, be coming on to replace Alexander Pato,\n18:20 Comment: who, as we mentioned a couple of times, is still trying to hit his fitness peak.\n18:30 Comment: Where's Andre Ayoub?\n18:34 Comment: I was suggesting the trail he would start through the middle for Chelsea\n18:46 Comment: here today was that man there Alexander Pato who did and he's had a couple of\n18:49 Comment: opportunities he goes off and trail he comes on yeah yeah a couple of\n18:55 Comment: opportunities decent ones one at the end of the first half a good one snatched at\n18:58 Comment: it flick the second off maybe could have gone for it a little bit more\n19:3 Comment: conventionally but chose to a little bit cleverer\n19:11 Comment: Traore scored a wonderful goal against Stoke City's done well under Gus Hiddink\n19:16 Comment: on the pitch for Chelsea obviously Falcao not in the managers thoughts at\n19:22 Comment: the moment to play since October Radamel Falcao because of injury remains on the\n19:29 Comment: Chelsea bench\n19:33 Comment: well there\n19:39 Comment: Oscar Pedro\n19:47 Comment:

sent in by\n20:29 Comment: Fabregas taking charge in the middle was Rangel\n20:33 Comment: and the\n20:35 Comment: first goal of the season for Chelsea\n20:37 Comment: Kennedy\n20:40 Comment: strong enough in by Monteiro\n20:44 Comment: problem also has been scoring goals for Swansea isn't it only four teams scored\n20:49 Comment: less than them in the Premier League\n20:53 Comment: Riddle off his cheek was setting his sights his eyes lit up but Fernandes made\n20:57 Comment: the real important challenge in the midst of all that again not for the first time\n21:1 Comment: this afternoon\n21:3 Comment: Rayren\n21:21 Comment: Swann Siu again a mirage acquired the hint January in recent interviews from\n21:26 Comment: fora this week at first you heard the się year the

one's gone off there with a bit of pace, trickery.\n21:51 Comment: Man coming on, plenty of it.\n21:53 Comment: Rallage has been moved around a bit as Swansea City have changed their system.\n22:2 Comment: He was through the middle against Stoke City,\n22:6 Comment: back in his more natural position of wide right here.\n22:12 Comment: That's Polosky.\n22:14 Comment: And now Gylfi Sigurdsson, Ivanovic to his ground.\n22:16 Comment: Sigurdsson hooks up to the heavens.\n22:19 Comment: Recovered there, didn't he, Ivanovic, really well.\n22:21 Comment: Poor header.\n22:23 Comment: There's Pedro.\n22:29 Comment: Traore.\n22:32 Comment: Oscar.\n22:34 Comment: Now Fabregas.\n22:37 Comment: This is Azpilicueta.\n22:41 Comment: She ran away from Traore, who still tried to make the most of it.\n22:46 Comment: Chance here, possibly for Montero to run,\n22:49 Comment: but John Obi Mikel, again, he saw the danger\n22:51 Comment: and he slammed him with a challenge.\n22:53 Comment: Might not be his favourite position, but I tell you what,\n22:55 Comment: he reads it particularly well.\n22:57 Comment: A couple of times he's done that, once on the right, once on the left.\n23:0 Comment: Get his team out of trouble.\n23:8 Comment: Swansea City have built a reputation for bringing the Premier League big boys crashing down.\n23:13 Comment: It's just the kind of day that they relish.\n23:18 Comment: Although they've never done it to Chelsea in the Premier League.\n23:23 Comment: He were in the lastおくばうちょりあ Ish,\n23:24 Comment: he's going to be a bit better than Schen thankful.\n23:29 Comment: Every man screwed up.\n23:33 Comment: Before that injury, Schen doesn't seem to be away.\n23:38 Comment: Blame his own side this time.\n23:39 Comment: 악 Sentador to

now watch what he\n24:5 Comment: does here outside of his left foot nothing bull\n24:10 Comment: use your right foot just create something\n24:16 Comment: he's a very unfamiliar Chelsea team we are looking at here\n24:25 Comment: certainly is you just wonder what the incoming manager is going to do with it\n24:40 Comment: Pedro Pieloski again working hard about to be yellow carded for that challenge so on\n24:44 Comment: Pedro\n24:45 Comment: yeah\n24:46 Comment: he realizes he's going to get a yellow card striker trying to track back trying to help\n24:53 Comment: his team out gets it wrong not for the first time won't be for the last\n24:56 Comment: just gets away from him there just clips in there's a referee's position perfectly placed\n25:4 Comment: easy one for him\n25:5 Comment: no question Pieloski has been a striker fired up for this game today\n25:9 Comment: to force his way back into the starting lineup\n25:13 Comment: I like what I've seen from him\n25:15 Comment: genuine unlike players who come towards the man with the ball at the\n25:27 Comment: feet he'll do that disisode that but that's his willingness to do that go the other way\n25:36 Comment: as well\n25:37 Comment: see Jak those they're sitting in exactly that tell you what the referees had a good game\n25:41 Comment: possible is not took well if you make the applicable one here which is actually hopefully\n25:42 Comment: and don't even try nothing this one not clear what you're gonna have to do you're gonna have\n25:43 Comment: to have a audacious themalark plan to before rolling into the next round here is theieverybe broadcast\n25:44 Comment: I'll tell you what, the leg was there, wasn't it?\n25:50 Comment: I thought Cork had got a yellow card to start with.\n25:52 Comment: I think he's a little bit unfortunate there.\n25:56 Comment: Right now down below us, the fourth official, Kevin Johnson,\n25:58 Comment: is getting to know Gus Hiddink and Francesco Guedlin really well\n26:1 Comment: because they've just both been in his ears at the same time.\n26:10 Comment: Fourth official sandwich.\n26:14 Comment: Rangel, Rangel.\n26:19 Comment: I'm assuming, Gary, Gus Hiddink was making the point\n26:21 Comment: that you were just making about Pedro's yellow card.\n26:27 Comment: I mean, he's planted the foot, Jack Cork, and he's gone over it.\n26:32 Comment: You've seen that go the other way many, many times.\n26:40 Comment: Reuben Loftus-Cheek beating Leroy Furt in a punt.\n26:44 Comment: Kennedy's on the outside.\n26:46 Comment: Loftus-Cheek deflected.\n26:48 Comment: Fabianski was stranded.\n26:50 Comment: Well, Leroy Furt there having a real go at the referee.\n26:52 Comment: Thought he impeded him when that ball and that move was in progress.\n26:58 Comment: Had that gone in the back of the net,\n27:1 Comment: his mood would have been particularly good, I fear.\n27:7 Comment: Can Chelsea make one of these set pieces count?\n27:12 Comment: Pedro's made the move.\n27:13 Comment: Likewise.\n27:14 Comment: Fabianski always loves to try and command this penalty area,\n27:17 Comment: and he does just that.\n27:20 Comment: He sets Poloski away, but he is stopped in no uncertain terms by Oscar.\n27:28 Comment: It's now his Loftus-Cheek.\n27:30 Comment: Pedro.\n27:32 Comment: Finally getting players in forward positions, Chelsea now.\n27:36 Comment: A number of them in the box as well.\n27:38 Comment: That's a foul.\n27:40 Comment: That's a silly one to give away,\n27:41 Comment: because Rael is just deep in his own territory,\n27:43 Comment: under pressure.\n27:45 Comment: Pedro just takes that right away from him.\n27:51 Comment: Francesco Guidolin's name has been thrown into the ring\n27:53 Comment: to take over from Antonio Conte\n27:55 Comment: as the new Italy boss after the Euros.\n27:58 Comment: He's built a good reputation for himself in Italy.\n28:0 Comment: He was in with the chance the last time it was up for grabs.\n28:4 Comment: Conte beat him to it.\n28:13 Comment: He's still in there in Europe, merciless.\n28:16 Comment: After half an hour game...\n28:18 Comment: What a relief that modelling that Jack Corke has got,\n28:20 Comment: David\n28:35 Comment: as to what went wrong for Swansea this campaign.\n28:41 Comment: At the moment, they are not far off, making it 40 points.\n28:46 Comment: Chelsea can't believe that.\n28:49 Comment: I cannot believe that's not been given as a corner.\n28:51 Comment: There's Hiddink again.\n28:53 Comment: Look, he's in a fiery

    "summary": "In a match full of electrifying energy and tense moments, Swansea City narrowly and impressively defeated Chelsea 1-0 at the Liberty Stadium, securing three crucial points. The game was pivotal for both teams, albeit for different reasons, with Chelsea looking to finish the season strongly under the temporary stewardship of Gus Hiddink, while Swansea aimed to all but confirm their Premier League safety by hitting the magic 40-point mark.\n\nThe first half began with a sense of anticipation from both sets of fans, and early observations suggested Chelsea, who had just welcomed new manager Antonio Conte watching from afar, would be auditioning players under the unseeing eyes of Hiddink. Swansea, still not mathematically safe from relegation, played with a determination that reflected their desperation to seal their survival soon.\n\nThe home side started brightly, with Miloski setting the tone early on by pressing the Chelsea midfield. Arjou and Rangel were also keen to assert dominance as they looked to take the game to Chelsea from the onset. Leroy Fer, who has been impressive since his loan move to Swansea, was key to Swansea's attempts to navigate through the match and opened with a notable message of fighting spirit by feeding Ashley Williams. Williams, captain and defensive lynchpin, had described Swansea's season as unacceptable but noted they could have been far worse off had it not been for their recent revival.\n\nThe early minutes saw Chelsea's Ruben Loftus-Cheek show promise. His fine form had been a breath of fresh air for a Chelsea side looking for bright spots in a disappointing season. Chelsea were probing, with Pedro and Baba Rahman making forward runs, but Swansea's defense held resolute with Fernandes and Williams thwarting several attempts.\n\nAs the game progressed into the middle of the first half, tensions between players began to rise. Taylor and Oscar had a brief skirmish that the referee managed well. Montero's duet with Taylor kept Swansea’s left-wing active, testing Chelsea's defensive fortitude. Ferreira Monteiro, especially known for tormenting defenders, lived up to his reputation, consistently threatening on the wing and delivering dangerous crosses into the box.\n\nChelsea's offensive maneuvers saw Pato and Oscar look to carve through Swansea’s defense. Fabregas, trying to thread passes through to the forward line, saw his efforts foiled repeatedly by Swansea’s organized backline. Despite a promising spell where Loftus-Cheek drove into the box forcing Fabianski into action, Chelsea lacked the cutting edge to break the deadlock.\n\nOne of the game's most notable moments came just before the half-hour mark. Miloski's free-kick glided into the box, flustering Chelsea’s rear-guard. Montero’s skill didn’t go unnoticed, as he forced Azpilicueta into a poor challenge, earning a booking for the Chelsea fullback. Chelsea, despite their possession and effort, failed to take advantage of set-pieces, with Fabregas often finding his efforts cleared by Williams and Fernandez.\n\nAs the first half drew closer to its conclusion, Swansea pressed harder, particularly through Montero. His dazzling runs and tricky footwork continuously hassled the Chelsea backline. The breakthrough finally came as Montero’s cross was initially struggled with by the Chelsea defense, leading to a perfect opportunity for Gilfi Sigurdsson, who had been Swansea's talisman all season. He struck with precision, his volley from Montero's set-up rocketing past Begovic to give Swansea a crucial lead. This goal marked his ninth in fourteen games this calendar year, placing him among the Premier League's most prolific players since January.\n\nThe second half saw Chelsea make a notable halftime change, with Kennedy replacing Miazga and John Obi Mikel shifting to center-back. Chelsea came out with renewed vigor, looking to respond immediately. Loftus-Cheek continued his forward forays, but Nathaniel Rangel and Ashley Williams remained impenetrable. Fabregas delivered successive corners but found Fabianski alert and commanding in his area, consistently quelling Chelsea's aerial threats.\n\nSwansea, undeterred, continued to exploit Montero’s ability as an outlet on the wing. Chelsea struggled to find their rhythm, often losing possession cheaply and allowing Swansea to mount dangerous counter-attacks. This pattern continued, with Swansea feeding off Chelsea's errors in midfield and defense. Ruben Loftus-Cheek, while industrious, saw his attempts frequently staved off by Fernandez and a vigilant Swansea rearguard.\n\nAs the match entered its final stages, Chelsea introduced Bertrand Traore for a tired-looking Pato, with the young forward injecting a brief spell of energy up front. However, Swansea's cohesion and tactical discipline anchored their lead effectively. The likes of Sigurdsson and Fabregas conducted their sides’ midfields with authority, each contributing critically to their defensive and offensive duties.\n\nWayne Routledge provided Swansea with another attacking dimension upon his introduction, continuing the pressure on Chelsea's defense. Chelsea’s bench called upon Radamel Falcao, making his return since October, to find an elusive equalizer. Even with the extra manpower, their sharpness in front of goal deserted them, much to the frustration of Hiddink and the Chelsea faithful.\n\nFabianski remained vigilant, commanding his penalty area with authority and rendering Chelsea’s threat from set-pieces impotent. His crucial saves preserved Swansea’s narrow lead and ensured Chelsea could not capitalize on their ball dominance. Sigurdsson, ever the lynchpin, kept Swansea ticking with his clever distribution and timely interceptions.\n\nThe final minutes saw Chelsea relentless in their pursuit of a goal that never came. The Swansea crowd, sensing an important victory, buoyed their team through to the finish. Despite Chelsea’s late surges, notably with Fabregas and Traore combining in the midfield and forward regions, the Swans held strong.\n\nJefferson Montero’s substitution for Kyle Naughton towards the end marked a tactical switch, aimed at solidifying their defensive stand. Naughton slotted in seamlessly, keeping the likes of Pedro and Traore at bay. With this valiant defensive performance, Swansea ensured Chelsea would depart the Liberty Stadium empty-handed.\n\nThe full-time whistle signaled a victory that swung Swansea closer to Premier League safety, reaching the coveted 40-point threshold and putting distance between themselves and the relegation dogfight. Chelsea’s uncharacteristic defensive fragility, exacerbated by the absence of stalwart figures like John Terry and Gary Cahill, coupled with Swansea's incisive play, meant that the visitors left with more questions than answers, particularly regarding their squad's future under Antonio Conte.\n\nSigurdsson’s solitary goal, a strike of sheer quality, was enough to secure the Swans a memorable and significant victory. It showcased an enlightening game where resilience, strategy, and individual brilliance converged to hand the Liberty Stadium faithful a well-deserved triumph. This result left Swansea City fans breathing easier and looking forward to seeing safety officially confirmed, while Chelsea left reflecting on their season of missed opportunities and looking ahead to a summer of rebuild and change under their new manager-to-be."
