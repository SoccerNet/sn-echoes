    "input": "\n    Manchester City 1 - 2 Tottenham\n\nFirst Half:\n\n0:0 Comment: star studded, which we'll see, which approach prevails here.\n0:6 Comment: In perfect conditions.\n0:11 Comment: And if you love football, it is a very romantic day,\n0:15 Comment: although you could say that Leicester's passion was rather killed.\n0:21 Comment: And if Manchester City win here, I suppose we'll be looking at normal order,\n0:26 Comment: Taking over again against Leicester, the outsiders,\n0:31 Comment: and there they lead.\n0:32 Comment: It would be an extraordinary feat to win the league,\n0:35 Comment: they've only done it twice before, and the last time was 1961.\n0:40 Comment: They haven't finished second since 1963,\n0:43 Comment: and they've never finished third in the Premier League era.\n0:47 Comment: But Mauricio Pochettino has instilled his work ethic,\n0:51 Comment: no team I'm sure, even in the heavy industry of professional football,\n0:56 Comment: works harder than Spurs do in training.\n1:0 Comment: They're lean and mean,\n1:3 Comment: trying to show that they mean business, not just here,\n1:6 Comment: in the race for the big prize itself.\n1:11 Comment: Yeah, and you just see that incident,\n1:13 Comment: it calls down immediately Manchester City as they try to break.\n1:15 Comment: It's phenomenal, I think this Tottenham side, I've said it a couple of times now,\n1:18 Comment: the sum of the parts is as good as I've seen since I've committed football,\n1:21 Comment: of all the Tottenham teams.\n1:22 Comment: They've been great individuals in the past,\n1:24 Comment: and I take that, I understand that,\n1:26 Comment: but the way these guys work each other, what their manager has done,\n1:29 Comment: in an understated way, he doesn't go on about it all the time,\n1:31 Comment: and call himself a chosen one,\n1:34 Comment: it's just hard work, it's graft, and they've bought into it.\n1:37 Comment: And I tell you what, after what happened,\n1:38 Comment: Man City against Leicester last week,\n1:40 Comment: this normal three-point fixture for City,\n1:44 Comment: well, that's not so sure today.\n1:46 Comment: This time Tottenham won here,\n1:48 Comment: they actually got to fourth in the Premier League,\n1:50 Comment: and got into the Champions League under Harry Redknapp.\n1:54 Comment: And a Peter Crouch goal.\n1:58 Comment: And Danny Alex has got his body in front,\n2:0 Comment: and drew the foul.\n2:2 Comment: He's just about in range.\n2:4 Comment: Anyone wants to have a crack?\n2:6 Comment: Richard Eriksen could be that guy.\n2:16 Comment: Joe Hart calling for a wall of four,\n2:18 Comment: so he wants to guard against the long-range effort.\n2:25 Comment: Eriksen goes for more position and placement,\n2:29 Comment: which might be difficult from this distance,\n2:30 Comment: but Al Divider likes to give it a real crack.\n2:34 Comment: And here he comes.\n2:39 Comment: I think Mark Klattenberg has got a bit of a problem.\n2:42 Comment: I think Mark Klattenberg has maybe spotted a bit of a foul in the wall,\n2:46 Comment: as the free kick was taken quickly.\n2:56 Comment: It was a waste.\n2:57 Comment: It was a waste, yes.\n2:58 Comment: Annoying for the team.\n3:1 Comment: That would have led to a corner, but an unnecessary foul.\n3:4 Comment: Well spotted by the referee,\n3:5 Comment: we talked to Mugbig before the game,\n3:7 Comment: spotted things that some of us didn't even spot.\n3:16 Comment: He was running away from Yagel, too, right?\n3:21 Comment: Yes, a tough challenge.\n3:22 Comment: He won't be allowed to do this again without getting a card.\n3:24 Comment: It's early in the game.\n3:25 Comment: I think the referee has given him the benefit of the doubt.\n3:27 Comment: He's right beside it,\n3:28 Comment: but perhaps on the wrong side,\n3:30 Comment: not to see a lunge with the left foot.\n3:32 Comment: Maybe he hasn't seen it as much as\n3:34 Comment: as we could hear.\n3:35 Comment: He's having a word.\n3:36 Comment: Lucky perhaps it's so early in the game,\n3:37 Comment: I think, that he hasn't decided to caution him.\n3:40 Comment: One more.\n3:41 Comment: We've all read that.\n3:42 Comment: One more and he's in the book.\n3:43 Comment: But besides, lower down the table,\n3:45 Comment: watching this and thinking,\n3:46 Comment: if we made a foul that early in the game,\n3:49 Comment: Mark Klattenberg would have the cards out\n3:51 Comment: and Pochettino's talking to the fourth official, Mike Dean,\n3:55 Comment: maybe along those lines.\n3:57 Comment: Yes, I think it was a yellow card.\n3:59 Comment: First black mark, if you like,\n4:2 Comment: against Mark Klattenberg today.\n4:4 Comment: But I think he's taken the view\n4:6 Comment: that it's early in the game,\n4:7 Comment: let him off one time,\n4:8 Comment: try and keep the spirit of the game good at this point.\n4:11 Comment: But having said that,\n4:12 Comment: he'd be under some pressure if he was on a yellow now.\n4:16 Comment: Here's Rose.\n4:18 Comment: He's kept it in.\n4:21 Comment: Kept it in to a company defended rather tentatively.\n4:25 Comment: Rose has another chance.\n4:29 Comment: Zagalleta.\n4:31 Comment: Slightly unwell now to Pochettino.\n4:33 Comment: They were together at Espanyol in La Liga.\n4:37 Comment: Just look at the four shirts,\n4:38 Comment: five shirts around David Silva there\n4:40 Comment: as he tried to break out.\n4:44 Comment: They do play with very little fear, Spurs.\n4:48 Comment: Dembele.\n4:50 Comment: Another city free kick.\n4:52 Comment: Dembele just fell on the ball.\n4:54 Comment: Handled it.\n5:5 Comment: Otto Mendes kept his place.\n5:7 Comment: It's the other Argentine Demichelis\n5:9 Comment: who's been stood down.\n5:11 Comment: Here's another from Pochettino's home country.\n5:15 Comment: We have got a very sad story to report to you\n5:20 Comment: about a local band, the Earl of Beach.\n5:24 Comment: Nearly as of Saturday morning,\n5:27 Comment: they were all involved,\n5:29 Comment: faithfully involved in a car accident.\n5:33 Comment: They were in a car accident.\n5:40 Comment: They were all involved, faithfully involved\n5:42 Comment: in a car accident in Sweden.\n5:47 Comment: And the tribute here.\n5:50 Comment: We send our condolences\n5:52 Comment: along with Manchester City and their supporters\n5:55 Comment: for those who have lost their loved ones.\n6:1 Comment: Well said.\n6:2 Comment: Tragic news, City fans almost.\n6:6 Comment: It's funny.\n6:8 Comment: Craig Terry, a season ticket holder here.\n6:10 Comment: Absolutely.\n6:15 Comment: Wide by Kane.\n6:18 Comment: Now the Vardel.\n6:22 Comment: Kane taking it on.\n6:24 Comment: Sharp start by Spurs.\n6:27 Comment: They're not to get there.\n6:28 Comment: Full backs forward, whichever ones\n6:30 Comment: are put into the team.\n6:31 Comment: Kyle Walker's got his place back today.\n6:33 Comment: He's certainly been challenged by Akira and Trippier.\n6:37 Comment: Danny Rose and Ben Davis have almost been\n6:40 Comment: alternates, haven't they?\n6:41 Comment: Yeah, and it shows the importance of having\n6:44 Comment: some real zest and pace at full back.\n6:46 Comment: And he takes them in and out\n6:47 Comment: because he knows what the type of game they play.\n6:49 Comment: That sometimes that's where the space is\n6:50 Comment: and the critical space in games\n6:52 Comment: and all the closing down ends up around the outside.\n6:54 Comment: I'm lucky in this particular instance\n6:56 Comment: with Davis and Trippier.\n6:58 Comment: They're playing their part.\n7:0 Comment: As the season has gone on, they really have.\n7:3 Comment: Company.\n7:34 Comment: I was wondering where the company would come up.\n7:36 Comment: But he's on his way.\n7:40 Comment: Short of the corner before he's got there.\n7:42 Comment: He's arrived now.\n7:43 Comment: Sterling puts it in.\n7:45 Comment: Out by Alderweireld.\n7:47 Comment: Tabata coming in the middle.\n7:49 Comment: Tottenham looking to counter-attack here.\n7:51 Comment: And it's been stopped by handball.\n7:55 Comment: Yeah, looking for Man City in some respects\n7:57 Comment: and Markup would tell that because Del Alli was away.\n8:1 Comment: Quite a bit of a play by Del Alli.\n8:3 Comment: He had an open break but it was definitely handball.\n8:7 Comment: But had he not handled it and got it down with downhandling\n8:9 Comment: I think Man City might have been in a bit of trouble.\n8:12 Comment: I'm surprised that Alli's back in.\n8:15 Comment: Five goals and a couple of assists\n8:17 Comment: in his last six away games in the Premier League.\n8:21 Comment: The goals have been of rare quality.\n8:24 Comment: They sure have.\n8:25 Comment: And then just coming off the bench last week\n8:27 Comment: the buzz and the excitement he brought to the team\n8:29 Comment: to the crowd and the stadium\n8:31 Comment: has pressed him away, doesn't it?\n8:34 Comment: Yes, Raheem Sterling.\n8:37 Comment: And now it's been a head-off.\n8:39 Comment: Aguero this time.\n8:46 Comment: Company.\n8:58 Comment: Lovely work by Yaya Toure.\n9:0 Comment: Aguero.\n9:3 Comment: And then clip it through for Toure.\n9:11 Comment: Aguero tries again.\n9:13 Comment: Sterling takes it on.\n9:15 Comment: Leaves Spurs behind him.\n9:17 Comment: And Wimmer.\n9:19 Comment: Well, actually Kevin Wimmer hasn't\n9:21 Comment: conceded a goal in his relatively short Premier League career.\n9:25 Comment: Around 200 minutes at this point.\n9:27 Comment: Yeah, he's got a bit of a run in his feet.\n9:28 Comment: Yeah, he's a little unstable there\n9:30 Comment: but managed to get it clear.\n9:32 Comment: Good break down the left side.\n9:34 Comment: It really woke the city crowd up.\n9:37 Comment: Does make his way into the box for this corner.\n9:39 Comment: Company.\n9:41 Comment: He loves the run towards the near post, doesn't he?\n9:44 Comment: Hedging in that direction again.\n9:48 Comment: And it came at an awkward angle and height for Aguero\n9:52 Comment: and defeated even his technique to keep it down.\n9:55 Comment: Yeah, it comes very quick, you'll see.\n9:56 Comment: I think it's Fernandinho who gets his touch on it\n9:58 Comment: and it gets into his path, all right, but yeah.\n10:0 Comment: About six or eight inches too high for him\n10:2 Comment: to get up and over it.\n10:4 Comment: As it drops there, yeah, he wants to get at it first time.\n10:7 Comment: It's just a little too high for him.\n10:16 Comment: And a look around the City team.\n10:18 Comment: Title winners.\n10:20 Comment: And Tottenham still trying to\n10:22 Comment: have that pinned on their lapels.\n10:26 Comment: And the focus this week of Tottenham's potential\n10:29 Comment: title winners has been immense.\n10:31 Comment: They haven't had that this season yet\n10:33 Comment: and can they live with it?\n10:35 Comment: The weight of history says they can't.\n10:37 Comment: And sometimes since Tottenham are in this position,\n10:41 Comment: Pochettino's different.\n10:44 Comment: Pushed by David Silva, thought he was in behind.\n10:47 Comment: And he's not.\n10:49 Comment: And it's a little bit of a shame\n10:50 Comment: that Silva thought he was in behind\n10:53 Comment: Tottenham's midfield then.\n11:4 Comment: Well, this game is 10, 11 minutes in\n11:6 Comment: and surprisingly Tottenham are 58% in possession.\n11:9 Comment: It shows that they've come here today to play,\n11:11 Comment: to get the ball back quickly, to knock it around.\n11:13 Comment: City not having it all their own way.\n11:17 Comment: Well, I asked him on Friday whether really\n11:18 Comment: he thought they could win the league\n11:20 Comment: and he went, why not?\n11:22 Comment: Which I thought was a probably more positive answer.\n11:25 Comment: He wasn't hiding behind managerial speak.\n11:27 Comment: And I think that's been the key really.\n11:29 Comment: It's not all put on, it's not for show.\n11:31 Comment: It's hard work, hard graft on the training ground\n11:33 Comment: and they've all bought into it, which is exceptional.\n11:35 Comment: Those who didn't, they're not there anymore.\n11:37 Comment: Simple as that.\n11:39 Comment: And I didn't think it was quite possible\n11:41 Comment: to do something like that in this modern era.\n11:43 Comment: Players being so protected.\n11:45 Comment: But these first players have proved they can.\n11:46 Comment: Eriksen.\n11:52 Comment: Walker.\n11:54 Comment: And then.\n11:58 Comment: They're still having double sessions\n12:0 Comment: even at this stage in the season.\n12:2 Comment: Yeah, interesting.\n12:4 Comment: And Raniere Lester, who are top of the league,\n12:6 Comment: saying he gives them two days a week off.\n12:8 Comment: Total opposites.\n12:10 Comment: The Cochitino method is to do it early in the week\n12:13 Comment: and then it taper down towards match day.\n12:15 Comment: We'll see.\n12:17 Comment: This is very important for Salah's finance.\n12:32 Comment: Denis Aboulate.\n12:35 Comment: Back in the team, Bakri Saneh is one of the City players\n12:38 Comment: not injured at the moment.\n12:41 Comment: Probably wouldn't be able to play today.\n12:42 Comment: Sterling.\n12:44 Comment: He will have followed, I'm sure,\n12:46 Comment: his old club's success at Villa Park.\n12:49 Comment: We'll read the headlines of that game in tomorrow's papers.\n12:52 Comment: Valentine's Day Massacre.\n12:54 Comment: Six-man for Liverpool.\n12:59 Comment: By Fernando.\n13:4 Comment: And it's a goal.\n13:10 Comment: Yeah, he comes in quite good.\n13:12 Comment: He's in full control of it here at this point.\n13:14 Comment: And coming in from behind,\n13:16 Comment: it's not allowed in this game.\n13:18 Comment: And Fernando,\n13:20 Comment: kind of lucky again, perhaps,\n13:22 Comment: that he only gets a talking to from the referee.\n13:25 Comment: There's Eric Dier,\n13:27 Comment: one of those top players\n13:29 Comment: linked up with England for that get-together\n13:32 Comment: on Thursday.\n13:34 Comment: And we're in for two.\n13:38 Comment: Here he is.\n13:40 Comment: Hands offside.\n13:42 Comment: He's put it in too, from an improbable angle.\n13:44 Comment: But the flag was already up.\n13:46 Comment: Well, that flag may just save\n13:48 Comment: Joe Hart's embarrassment here.\n13:50 Comment: It's nice play again.\n13:52 Comment: Good switch play, a little switch ball in sight here\n13:54 Comment: at this point, yeah.\n13:56 Comment: Linesman gets it spot on, but at this point,\n13:58 Comment: I will take the view that Joe Hart must have seen\n14:0 Comment: that flag in the corner of his eye.\n14:2 Comment: He was looking in that direction, wasn't he?\n14:3 Comment: And he's got it.\n14:5 Comment: Teng.\n14:8 Comment: And he's got into the middle.\n14:10 Comment: And Ericsson has crossed.\n14:13 Comment: Unable to claim.\n14:17 Comment: Good aggressive run into the box there, wasn't it,\n14:19 Comment: by Del Alli?\n14:21 Comment: A little bit further out, he was under a chance.\n14:23 Comment: And comes\n14:25 Comment: Rivella-Rees purposefully and effectively.\n14:28 Comment: Dembele.\n14:31 Comment: Silva's header.\n14:33 Comment: Another touch for City.\n14:35 Comment: Fernando.\n14:37 Comment: A little bit of anxiety around\n14:39 Comment: the anti-hat at the moment.\n14:41 Comment: Yeah, because, as we said, as far as our bossing it, really,\n14:44 Comment: until City get some prolonged possession\n14:46 Comment: and find their key players in the box,\n14:48 Comment: it's a bit of a struggle.\n14:50 Comment: Yeah, it's a bit of a struggle.\n14:52 Comment: It's a bit of a struggle.\n14:55 Comment: Possession and find their key players in good areas.\n14:58 Comment: Tottenham seem to be the one that have\n15:0 Comment: started the brighter, but\n15:2 Comment: again, no keeper involvement\n15:4 Comment: as such.\n15:6 Comment: A lot to play for now.\n15:7 Comment: Klicic.\n15:13 Comment: Agüero.\n15:16 Comment: By Dembele.\n15:18 Comment: Interloper's sterling.\n15:19 Comment: Great kick to City.\n15:26 Comment: Sergio Agüero.\n15:30 Comment: He scored\n15:32 Comment: seven of the last nine goals in the Premier League\n15:35 Comment: that makes the City have amassed.\n15:37 Comment: Sergio Agüero.\n15:39 Comment: Leaving the late one here against Leicester,\n15:41 Comment: which is probably offside, actually,\n15:43 Comment: but was given and it's just a consolation.\n15:47 Comment: Nicely worked to Sterling.\n15:50 Comment: Back to David Silva again.\n15:53 Comment: Not easy to open up.\n15:55 Comment: The toughest defence in the Premier League,\n15:57 Comment: which is Tottenham's,\n15:58 Comment: but City were close to doing it.\n16:0 Comment: Yeah, as soon as they get their key players involved,\n16:2 Comment: that's what they have to do.\n16:3 Comment: It's great play, great trickery again from David Silva.\n16:5 Comment: You can see Jair screaming out of the back post,\n16:7 Comment: but the interception was good.\n16:10 Comment: City's brightest moment.\n16:20 Comment: It's a good leap by Agüero.\n16:25 Comment: It's Otamendi, rather, who's got it.\n16:27 Comment: They've been fooled because Agüero\n16:29 Comment: suddenly started heading goals,\n16:30 Comment: which he didn't do for the first three or four years\n16:33 Comment: that he had when he came here.\n16:39 Comment: It's important as well,\n16:41 Comment: the technique he used for the goal against Watford\n16:43 Comment: a few weeks ago.\n16:44 Comment: It's as good as you'll see.\n16:45 Comment: Unbelievable.\n16:48 Comment: Four of his last 15 Premier League goals\n16:52 Comment: have been headers,\n16:53 Comment: one from his first 77 games.\n16:55 Comment: You've been giving him lessons.\n17:0 Comment: And now he's using that new aerial power\n17:2 Comment: to defend.\n17:4 Comment: It just shows you when you have the ability he has,\n17:6 Comment: you don't see it very often,\n17:7 Comment: but when he hangs and gets a header on goal,\n17:10 Comment: for his size, it's...\n17:13 Comment: Kane trying to get it away from Otamendi,\n17:15 Comment: he got in the way.\n17:17 Comment: Zabaleta.\n17:21 Comment: Kane to drive on.\n17:23 Comment: Machlaber gave the foul for the first instant\n17:25 Comment: as he came into Dier.\n17:27 Comment: Dier gave him a good hard old-fashioned shoulder,\n17:29 Comment: but no advantage from this moment\n17:33 Comment: where he gets by here.\n17:34 Comment: That's where the free kick was given,\n17:35 Comment: but you see,\n17:36 Comment: Dier letting him know they're not here\n17:37 Comment: to be brushed aside easily, are they Tottenham?\n17:53 Comment: So, Dier.\n18:2 Comment: Just broken to a Sidique Nkane attack here,\n18:4 Comment: particularly if Yair Arturo turns on the burners,\n18:6 Comment: which he did.\n18:9 Comment: Aguero.\n18:12 Comment: Here comes Clichy at the gallop.\n18:14 Comment: So, too, is Fernandinho.\n18:18 Comment: So you see, they concentrated centrally\n18:20 Comment: defending in numbers by Spurs,\n18:22 Comment: but they haven't had to pry it out of trouble.\n18:29 Comment: Fernando.\n18:32 Comment: Kankayi Rather.\n18:35 Comment: David Silva.\n18:37 Comment: Sterling.\n18:40 Comment: Good block.\n18:42 Comment: Stopping the ball coming in by Walker.\n18:44 Comment: That's the full-backs' first job.\n18:46 Comment: Speak, you don't say anything.\n18:47 Comment: Nobody stops crosses anymore,\n18:48 Comment: but Pochettino is the Spurs team right at it.\n18:50 Comment: And it was nine white shirts\n18:51 Comment: in that last little move Sidique tried\n18:53 Comment: and couldn't get past him.\n19:0 Comment: That's a hold-up by Yair Arturo.\n19:4 Comment: There's no-one at the back post for Sidique.\n19:8 Comment: Skillfully defended by Alec.\n19:11 Comment: Just a little graphic here on Danny Rose.\n19:14 Comment: He's been used quite a lot.\n19:16 Comment: You can see 47% Spurs are attacking down this left side\n19:19 Comment: and he's the outlet, energetic young man that he is.\n19:24 Comment: He'll be loving that responsibility.\n19:29 Comment: I appreciate.\n19:32 Comment: And he's got a good shot.\n19:34 Comment: He's got a good shot.\n19:37 Comment: I appreciate.\n19:45 Comment: Walker.\n19:48 Comment: Pochettino's put into a new life,\n19:50 Comment: into Moussa Dembele as well.\n19:53 Comment: He's more confident than he gets a regular birth in the team,\n19:56 Comment: but he's started to score goals\n19:58 Comment: and involved in the creativity of the team as well.\n20:3 Comment: This is work rate too, then.\n20:4 Comment: He's one of those who's bought into it,\n20:6 Comment: looked at what Pochettino's done and said,\n20:7 Comment: I want some of that.\n20:8 Comment: And he's become a better all-round player.\n20:10 Comment: He's got more significant inputs into games ever since.\n20:14 Comment: What was terrifying for the commentary fraternity\n20:16 Comment: was that Spurs were looking to sign another Moussa Dembele from Fulham.\n20:24 Comment: It didn't go through in this window.\n20:26 Comment: We'd have managed, goodness knows,\n20:27 Comment: but I'm sure we would have found a way.\n20:36 Comment: And the VAR out.\n20:39 Comment: Wimmer.\n20:40 Comment: Remember, Tongan's still a couple of weeks away\n20:42 Comment: from recovering from a knee injury.\n20:48 Comment: Wimmer's deputy is hurt.\n20:52 Comment: The referee hasn't seen Yaya Tori come in late on Wimmer there.\n20:56 Comment: Yaya's got away with another one.\n21:0 Comment: Here's Zabaleta.\n21:3 Comment: Back on his feet.\n21:6 Comment: Otamendi.\n21:10 Comment: Glici.\n21:12 Comment: Varela able to come off.\n21:14 Comment: And Varela to front him up.\n21:15 Comment: He can't get past him.\n21:19 Comment: Yaya Tori looking not to be booked earlier.\n21:21 Comment: Let's have a look at this incident here.\n21:22 Comment: It's the first time I'm seeing it too since it happened.\n21:25 Comment: Oh, he's come in late.\n21:26 Comment: His left foot once again catches the ankle of the Spurs centre half.\n21:30 Comment: You'll see he flies in.\n21:31 Comment: When you don't make and win the ball in that situation there,\n21:34 Comment: and you clip the flare as he has,\n21:36 Comment: it's two he's got away with.\n21:39 Comment: And Zabaleta.\n21:43 Comment: Well by Rose, not neglecting his offensive duties.\n21:49 Comment: It's the responsibility of Gamil Kanthor down the left-hand side for Tottenham.\n21:58 Comment: I do sense they are recovering if they don't do it this season.\n22:1 Comment: Now with a new stadium to be built,\n22:4 Comment: and facilities to put them up with the super clubs,\n22:11 Comment: there's no reason at all to think they can hang on to this group of players\n22:14 Comment: while the future can be very, very bright indeed.\n22:18 Comment: But it might not be immediately bright here because they have\n22:22 Comment: thrown away a free kick.\n22:25 Comment: Yeah, after he played a pretty decent ball into Aguero,\n22:27 Comment: Aguero looks to feed him back in.\n22:30 Comment: Mark Clattenburg.\n22:33 Comment: Spot of the late challenge on Iaia, you can see here.\n22:35 Comment: He knocks it through, he's going for the return here.\n22:37 Comment: And it's Wimmer.\n22:39 Comment: Once again,\n22:41 Comment: surprised that the shirt hasn't been pulled from Mark Clattenburg.\n22:44 Comment: Wimmer blatantly stopped Iaia Turri there.\n22:52 Comment: One's never quite sure with his wide array of talent\n22:55 Comment: whether he's going to be quite on it.\n22:57 Comment: Iaia Turri can amble through not entire matches,\n23:0 Comment: but periods of games.\n23:1 Comment: But he's started very brightly here.\n23:8 Comment: Balls for Aguero.\n23:10 Comment: And for Sterling.\n23:12 Comment: It was Rose who threw himself into the line of it.\n23:16 Comment: Yeah, so brave of him, really painful.\n23:19 Comment: Now, what he's done for his team here is real good\n23:22 Comment: because this is on target from Sterling.\n23:24 Comment: First one isn't that good a shot, it makes its way back out,\n23:26 Comment: but this is on target and flying a pace.\n23:30 Comment: Danny Rose does an excellent job for his team.\n23:35 Comment: Test for the abs.\n23:39 Comment: Dembele.\n23:42 Comment: Ericsson.\n23:51 Comment: Well, it's a tough one to take,\n23:54 Comment: but he's so brave here, he doesn't hold back at all\n23:56 Comment: and I think it's a vital moment.\n23:58 Comment: It's a great technique, great volley on target.\n24:0 Comment: I think that's going into the net at a fierce pace.\n24:4 Comment: But just look at Rose, he puts everything on the line there\n24:7 Comment: and yes, as you said, Martin, the abs are tested.\n24:12 Comment: But Danny stood up for that test.\n24:14 Comment: Well done, Danny Rose.\n24:17 Comment: Not wilting.\n24:24 Comment: Wehme.\n24:29 Comment: Sloppy from Ericsson.\n24:36 Comment: And he's given it to...\n24:38 Comment: Ferdinandinho.\n24:41 Comment: Toure.\n24:45 Comment: Necessary piece of covering by Walker.\n24:47 Comment: And when he's done, he'll have to bounce a group.\n24:53 Comment: Rose.\n24:59 Comment: Ferdinandinho's come across a quite heavy challenge in Rose.\n25:1 Comment: He's had a tough couple of minutes, says Danny.\n25:4 Comment: Mark Clattenburg blew instantly,\n25:6 Comment: but once again, I think he's decided not to call the player over\n25:11 Comment: and throw caution out.\n25:12 Comment: In fact, not even speak to him, but he's come in late.\n25:14 Comment: And when you don't get the ball and you reach out like that\n25:17 Comment: and you don't get it, I think you're inviting a yellow card.\n25:20 Comment: Poor lad has also just had a whack a minute ago.\n25:22 Comment: He gets another one.\n25:24 Comment: It's been a good long day so far for the Dannys.\n25:25 Comment: Danny Welbeck, Danny Staric.\n25:28 Comment: Now the bar out.\n25:58 Comment: And I think last season,\n26:5 Comment: Spurs have beaten here 4-1.\n26:7 Comment: And Barraga got all four and actually missed another penalty.\n26:11 Comment: The season before it was 6-0.\n26:14 Comment: There's evidence of improvement.\n26:16 Comment: I say that again, and the Portuguese deserve such great credit for that alone.\n26:19 Comment: Never mind getting them into a title challenging position.\n26:23 Comment: But that last little bit of play,\n26:25 Comment: there Hugo Lars refused to kick the ball long\n26:27 Comment: and he was knocking it around to Ida Fulvik,\n26:29 Comment: knowing that City don't close down like Spurs do.\n26:32 Comment: And that's the secret.\n26:33 Comment: They do everything with tempo, everything with pace.\n26:40 Comment: A different team to what we've been looking at over the last couple of years.\n26:56 Comment: A busy month for Manchester City\n27:0 Comment: with the FA Cup coming up at Chelsea,\n27:2 Comment: the Champions League in Kiev,\n27:4 Comment: the Capital One Cup final, which you can see.\n27:6 Comment: It's the city live with us on Sky Sports.\n27:8 Comment: Watch against Liverpool.\n27:12 Comment: Spurs have got Europa League action against Fiorentina.\n27:17 Comment: Away and at home.\n27:18 Comment: They're still in the FA Cup as well there.\n27:21 Comment: Watch against Crystal Palace.\n27:26 Comment: Sterling.\n27:29 Comment: Harry, Eriksen, Dier,\n27:32 Comment: Chris from Tottenham.\n27:35 Comment: Moses.\n27:36 Comment: He's lacked a bit of elevation, but he goes again.\n27:40 Comment: And again, and again.\n27:42 Comment: Kane.\n27:47 Comment: He's not round the outside, it's Abueleta.\n27:49 Comment: He bounces back onto his feet.\n27:51 Comment: Eriksen.\n27:52 Comment: And it's only carried out.\n27:55 Comment: It looked like it was going in the direction of Alli.\n28:0 Comment: Cho Hearts.\n28:2 Comment: Pushes away.\n28:6 Comment: Dier.\n28:10 Comment: Another encouraging spell from Spurs.\n28:13 Comment: I'm not frightened to go back to Lloris,\n28:16 Comment: who does kick long this time.\n28:19 Comment: You can see why they want to play from the back more often than not.\n28:22 Comment: Sure, Dani Roses couldn't go back and make an angle for him.\n28:25 Comment: He'd worked so hard in the last few minutes.\n28:27 Comment: He wasn't there, so he'd have to go long.\n28:30 Comment: Spurs do really well at taking this game to Manchester City.\n28:34 Comment: Not creating yet, it must be said.\n28:36 Comment: Certainly not lying down and in the box.\n28:38 Comment: So.\n29:9 Comment: Spurs trying to make that happen here.\n29:16 Comment: Eriksen.\n29:22 Comment: Mbele.\n29:32 Comment: We know City are good with the ball.\n29:35 Comment: We'll find out how good they are without it.\n29:40 Comment: Spurs probe again.\n29:45 Comment: Still there.\n29:48 Comment: A debate as to whether the announcement of Pep Guardiola arriving\n29:52 Comment: next season is a good thing or whether it's had an adverse effect on the dressing room.\n29:58 Comment: So put out there for us in the public arena by Pellegrini himself.\n30:5 Comment: Nice footwork from Son.\n30:7 Comment: Kane.\n30:9 Comment: Keep him away from shooting positions.\n30:15 Comment: Trying to get on the outside of Sterling.\n30:17 Comment: He's seen him off.\n30:20 Comment: Extensive win in the City free kick as well.\n30:26 Comment: Joe Harness had to make his first save in the game.\n30:29 Comment: I think this might have swerved a little bit.\n30:31 Comment: You can see he decides to let fly from 25 yards.\n30:34 Comment: Yeah, it might have been even a deflection.\n30:36 Comment: But he does really well and gets a break that it didn't bounce out to a Spurs player.\n30:40 Comment: Good effort from Eriksen.\n30:45 Comment: Eriksen again.\n30:46 Comment: He hasn't got a previous games match to City in his Ajax days.\n30:52 Comment: Two good results in the Champions League.\n30:55 Comment: Group.\n30:57 Comment: On the way.\n30:58 Comment: Confrontation.\n30:59 Comment: Actually Eriksen played as an out striker in Amsterdam against City.\n31:2 Comment: Mancini City it was then.\n31:11 Comment: Cleared by Klicic.\n31:19 Comment: To Bimmer.\n31:24 Comment: Mbele.\n31:27 Comment: Eriksen.\n31:29 Comment: They're bossing the ball at the moment.\n31:30 Comment: Tottenham Hotspur.\n31:32 Comment: Klicic won't get there.\n31:34 Comment: Walker to get into him in the end.\n31:36 Comment: And he's held from what's amended.\n31:42 Comment: It's nothing that we aren't expecting is it today?\n31:44 Comment: We know Spurs will come out and they'll try and don and try and push.\n31:46 Comment: But they're just sitting a little bit sluggish to get going at the other end.\n31:51 Comment: Rare attack now with Aguero.\n31:54 Comment: Silva.\n31:57 Comment: Sterling.\n32:3 Comment: And he got a foot in.\n32:8 Comment: Fairness and fit.\n32:10 Comment: Tottenham Hotspur.\n32:13 Comment: Gone through the first half an hour here.\n32:16 Comment: Impressively in most of the aspects of their game.\n32:20 Comment: They've worked Joe Hart a bit more than Eriksen's shot.\n32:23 Comment: And they've been working on being more clinical in front of goal.\n32:30 Comment: Here's David Silva.\n32:31 Comment: He knows City can flick a switch.\n32:35 Comment: Individual excellence.\n32:37 Comment: Winning experience.\n32:39 Comment: Big players.\n32:41 Comment: Two of them trying to combine there.\n32:43 Comment: And Toure and Aguero.\n32:45 Comment: Aguero again.\n32:46 Comment: Sort of muddled across the face of the goal.\n32:48 Comment: It'll be a corner if it goes I think.\n32:50 Comment: Yeah, better for Man City.\n32:51 Comment: Good probe and play.\n32:53 Comment: Talk about the key players doing things well.\n32:55 Comment: It seems to be working real well there for the first time.\n32:59 Comment: Deflected shot.\n33:2 Comment: Sees I think their third corner.\n33:6 Comment: Fourth. Company up again.\n33:10 Comment: They're high on the list.\n33:11 Comment: Both these teams in Premier League.\n33:13 Comment: Scorers from set pieces.\n33:15 Comment: Corner from Sterling.\n33:16 Comment: Lloris goes hunting it.\n33:19 Comment: Helps it out of harm's way.\n33:28 Comment: A little bit risky by...\n33:30 Comment: But they got away with it.\n33:32 Comment: Continue to attack with the willing rows.\n33:40 Comment: It's a special moment for the players.\n33:43 Comment: Max Dini rows his way again.\n33:48 Comment: Alley.\n33:50 Comment: Squeezing it through to Eriksen.\n33:52 Comment: Kane waiting.\n33:53 Comment: Far post.\n33:55 Comment: Diak.\n33:56 Comment: Scored against the Caballero.\n33:58 Comment: The other City goalkeeper who deputised for\n34:0 Comment: Joe Hart down at White Hart Lane in September.\n34:4 Comment: Yeah, the shot's gone pretty wild there.\n34:10 Comment: Not a bad effort.\n34:13 Comment: It's going to throw it forward a couple of weeks for you.\n34:17 Comment: Manchester United play Arsenal in the Premier League.\n34:20 Comment: From one on Sky Sports 1.\n34:22 Comment: Followed by Manchester City in the Capital One Cup Final\n34:25 Comment: against Liverpool of course.\n34:26 Comment: From four.\n34:35 Comment: Eriksen.\n34:37 Comment: Scored.\n34:42 Comment: Gorgeous.\n34:44 Comment: The offender.\n34:45 Comment: City skipper.\n34:46 Comment: It's amazing that they haven't had that spine in the team\n34:49 Comment: in a league game since August.\n34:51 Comment: Incredible, yeah.\n34:52 Comment: And the stats tell you how much they've missed them.\n34:54 Comment: And listen, Manchester City are still in the tight race.\n34:56 Comment: You mustn't forget that.\n34:57 Comment: But it's because how they do against the teams outside the top six\n35:0 Comment: that they've got a poor record against their rivals.\n35:2 Comment: He knows that, but they've been excellent\n35:3 Comment: against the teams further down the league.\n35:5 Comment: When the pressure's been on, the company has been missed.\n35:7 Comment: They have been top for 100 days this season.\n35:10 Comment: Spurs have been top for 33 days in the entire history of the Premier League.\n35:15 Comment: This is the 24th season.\n35:18 Comment: That is a pretty telling start.\n35:26 Comment: 35 minutes gone, but they're not looking miscast\n35:31 Comment: as potential league winners Spurs.\n35:34 Comment: That's right.\n35:35 Comment: Man City are uncomfortable at the moment.\n35:37 Comment: They really stand their authority in the game well in midfield.\n35:39 Comment: Bit of creativity to come.\n35:43 Comment: He'll put me across.\n35:45 Comment: Every time he sort of stretches into a sprint, you just wonder.\n35:48 Comment: Persistent injury as a senior player.\n35:51 Comment: It's very, very hard.\n35:53 Comment: He must wonder.\n35:54 Comment: They must have given him a special programme for the calf strain.\n35:57 Comment: He came on with an attempted comeback, didn't he?\n36:0 Comment: And it lasted just a few minutes.\n36:5 Comment: Yeah, I think as good as it is to see him in the shirt,\n36:7 Comment: when he walks off injured in a game,\n36:9 Comment: it actually brings the level of disappointment even further into the club.\n36:14 Comment: Such a wonderful captain, such a wonderful leader.\n36:16 Comment: Great days here.\n36:17 Comment: I think most Man City fans would be delighted to see him\n36:20 Comment: get through the 90 minutes today and declare himself fit for the next match.\n36:23 Comment: I think that's the key.\n36:25 Comment: One at a time, or two at a time maybe.\n36:29 Comment: Sorely missed.\n36:30 Comment: Thank you.\n37:4 Comment: He's been rewarded already with an improved long-term deal.\n37:7 Comment: And I have to be paid for doing that.\n37:9 Comment: Daniel Levy doesn't dish it out willy-nilly.\n37:12 Comment: Willy-nilly, but deli-ally.\n37:15 Comment: When you think about it, as far as their search all around the world for talent,\n37:18 Comment: and they found it almost in the back garden, if you like, with this fella.\n37:22 Comment: And he's been superb.\n37:24 Comment: I think it's a real tonic for players further down the leagues,\n37:27 Comment: looking up at the Premier League and thinking they just always go for foreign players.\n37:32 Comment: Him, people like Vardy, you know, they're stars this season.\n37:35 Comment: Proof that we've got some real good talent back down there.\n37:50 Comment: Down a bit of pressing, forces an error.\n37:52 Comment: Forces an error.\n37:59 Comment: I'm sure City players who appreciate the qualities of Manuel Pellegrini\n38:4 Comment: would love to send him on his way with some silverware this season,\n38:7 Comment: because they're in for the shout of plenty.\n38:13 Comment: That was silver.\n38:16 Comment: And now a tour, Hound and Fire, Spurs collectively.\n38:20 Comment: Not amended.\n38:23 Comment: First time ball from silver.\n38:27 Comment: Sprinter, who is Raheem Sterling.\n38:32 Comment: You can't argue with Mark Clattenburg's decision, he was right on the spot.\n38:37 Comment: He was just emphasising the point to Sterling.\n38:39 Comment: Maybe just saying to him,\n38:42 Comment: either don't protest or don't go down as easily as that.\n38:45 Comment: I think he was also protesting because he seemed to get a little wallop on the mouth.\n38:49 Comment: Perhaps Mark Clattenburg hadn't spotted that, I mean that was his argument.\n39:10 Comment: Do you think Man City are missing a spark?\n39:12 Comment: The first 39, 40 minutes of the game, they've got this talent,\n39:16 Comment: they've tried one or two things, Spurs have been as irritable on them as possible\n39:21 Comment: by being right in their faces, working really hard.\n39:24 Comment: But around that, to get through it, there has to be some kind of collective spark.\n39:28 Comment: And relying on one or two of the big names to do that,\n39:31 Comment: you know, this is one of the first games I haven't seen a City full-back put a ball in yet.\n39:35 Comment: I haven't seen them get in the far side, I haven't seen them get in the far side.\n39:37 Comment: They're the home team.\n39:39 Comment: Some slip from Kane but it worked out OK.\n40:9 Comment: It's gone wide to Rose.\n40:13 Comment: David Silva, get back.\n40:15 Comment: He had to do a lot of work in his own half.\n40:17 Comment: Trying to find the key to the door in the other half.\n40:20 Comment: Eriksen.\n40:22 Comment: Dier.\n40:23 Comment: Come out to Rose again.\n40:26 Comment: Kane and Alli in the middle.\n40:30 Comment: Eriksen.\n40:32 Comment: Give and go.\n40:36 Comment: Tiro gives it away.\n40:38 Comment: Walker.\n40:47 Comment: A point was being made in the studio before the game.\n40:49 Comment: Have Spurs got the kind of player, even the Mahrez, to open up teams when they are on top?\n40:59 Comment: Harry Kane, of course, can finish off chances.\n41:1 Comment: They haven't made one for him yet.\n41:2 Comment: Penny Rose lets fly and it's a corner.\n41:5 Comment: Yeah, I think he believes that was going on target too.\n41:8 Comment: He was really disappointed to see the block.\n41:11 Comment: It's a decent enough clearance but lingering on the edge of the box, not hanging by the left back position.\n41:15 Comment: And you'll see there he holds his head in his hands because he thinks this is well on its way.\n41:20 Comment: I think he's right too.\n41:22 Comment: You can see Danny Rose going, oh, I think that was going in.\n41:27 Comment: Spurs a chance to show off their skill at set plays.\n41:30 Comment: And the VARO scored.\n41:32 Comment: A corner in the game down at White Hart Lane.\n41:33 Comment: It was flicked off.\n41:35 Comment: First Tottenham goal.\n41:38 Comment: Yeah, it was a nice flick this time as well but the referee spotted a little nudge from Del Alli as it was played in towards him.\n41:45 Comment: Decent ball.\n41:46 Comment: You can see a little nudge here now.\n41:47 Comment: There you go.\n41:48 Comment: A little push there on Klici.\n41:51 Comment: In truth, I think Klici would have cleared it had that not happened and the referees got a break.\n42:1 Comment: Do you think now there's been a little bit of afters from the Leicester defeat in this Manchester City first half performance here?\n42:7 Comment: A little bit lacking in the usual swagger.\n42:9 Comment: I think there is.\n42:10 Comment: I was looking for a response.\n42:11 Comment: I said it before the game to a couple of people.\n42:12 Comment: I want to see City say that that was a one off.\n42:14 Comment: And that they're really in this tight race and take the game with a spurt to the neck.\n42:17 Comment: But the fact of the matter is Spurs, particularly the likes of Del Alli, they've shown them what Sparks are about.\n42:22 Comment: They've shown them about energy and it's been a little bit disappointing.\n42:31 Comment: I mean he's a little bit annoyed with certain aspects but he can't be that displeased with the way they've taken the thing.\n42:37 Comment: Quite a scruff of the neck and are trying, they're not creating, but they're in charge in various areas of the field.\n42:43 Comment: And yeah, just to your point, Martin, City are a disappointing first half I would say.\n42:47 Comment: Of course Manchester, the current hub of the managerial merry-go-round in both rumour and reality.\n43:1 Comment: Pellegrini on the wrong end of the reality.\n43:3 Comment: Pochettino has been mentioned in the rumours.\n43:7 Comment: But he's saying it's his most enjoyable time in management.\n43:10 Comment: And it certainly should be.\n43:12 Comment: One of the young, gifted players he's got at his disposal.\n43:15 Comment: And he's making better, stronger.\n43:18 Comment: We're at the business end of this season, I guess we're going to find out in the next two or three months just how far is a walk in progress.\n43:26 Comment: Or how far it's actually been completed.\n43:28 Comment: Here comes Kylisic.\n43:31 Comment: Sterling. City strike before half-time here.\n43:36 Comment: With David Silva.\n43:38 Comment: And Dier is there.\n43:39 Comment: And too many players in the end.\n43:43 Comment: They're a bit lucky it bounced out of the ground.\n43:45 Comment: They're in danger of overcrowding their defensive efforts.\n43:49 Comment: Yeah, great play from Man City.\n43:51 Comment: They're capable of this.\n43:55 Comment: One little ball in here.\n43:56 Comment: Into the space.\n43:57 Comment: And as he looks up here, Aguero's hoping for the pullback.\n44:1 Comment: And you're right, there's that many white shirts there.\n44:3 Comment: They've got a little bit tied up in themselves.\n44:5 Comment: But they came away with it okay.\n44:24 Comment: Dier.\n44:45 Comment: Dembele.\n44:50 Comment: Rose.\n44:53 Comment: Made by Otamendi.\n44:56 Comment: Toure.\n44:59 Comment: I think Oda knew that Yaya Toure was away there.\n45:3 Comment: Yeah, because he makes the move and doesn't connect yet.\n45:8 Comment: He's complaining a little bit.\n45:9 Comment: But he can surely only complain the fact that he hasn't given one up to now.\n45:13 Comment: Because when you don't get the ball there and the player's away,\n45:16 Comment: it's a yellow card.\n45:17 Comment: But I do think he's annoyed that he's the first man in the book.\n45:21 Comment: After some of the tackles that happened from Man City players earlier.\n45:52 Comment: There's been no real big calls for Mark Clattenburg.\n45:54 Comment: Probably the tightest ones have been not to book Yaya Toure early on.\n46:0 Comment: Here's Danny Rose.\n46:1 Comment: There's been a real bundle of energy.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: of his acres of space but I think Sterling will possibly do a better defensive job although\n0:4 Comment: he's got a lot to offer going forward as well.\n0:7 Comment: He might pin Danny Rose back mightn't he?\n0:10 Comment: We'll see.\n0:13 Comment: Satisfactory first half for Spurs.\n0:16 Comment: Frustrating for Manchester City who started the season with seven wins in their first\n0:21 Comment: nine games under Manuel Pellegrini and their blip in that time was a 4-1 defeat at Spurs\n0:29 Comment: but they've only won seven of the 16 games they've played since in the league.\n0:35 Comment: Which is why they find themselves going into this game in fourth place.\n0:41 Comment: I think we all got a shock West Ham came here do you remember and tore them apart after\n0:45 Comment: they'd started so fantastically winning the first five games and it's been a bit of a\n0:49 Comment: struggle ever since for Manchester City.\n0:52 Comment: Up and down and I know there's some good performances as well but I think this game was all about\n0:58 Comment: making a statement for me that they could win this game really showed their title credentials\n1:2 Comment: today but so far first half flat.\n1:6 Comment: And the yellow card for the returning captain for dumping Ali on the turf.\n1:12 Comment: Dier.\n1:13 Comment: Walker.\n1:17 Comment: Son.\n1:20 Comment: Cleared by Klishy.\n1:26 Comment: It's over having to clear Kyle Walker.\n1:31 Comment: Certainly quiet the atmosphere here at Spurs.\n1:39 Comment: Dembele.\n1:41 Comment: Can they get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to\n1:57 Comment: Dembele.\n1:59 Comment: Can they put a bit of icing on the cake there with something in this part of the pitch and\n2:5 Comment: they haven't been able to do that even in the first half which they largely controlled.\n2:10 Comment: But they win the ball back Martin you see it there Spurs were careless City looked to\n2:14 Comment: go on a break and all the good players started to look to go back clamp them right on them\n2:18 Comment: win the ball back.\n2:19 Comment: Althia de Veld.\n2:21 Comment: First time knowledge of Cotutino.\n2:24 Comment: Espanol connection.\n2:30 Comment: We've had a buyer.\n2:32 Comment: Comes up a lot to support Sterling.\n2:37 Comment: To get that time.\n2:43 Comment: Harry came up your best place because he's got a lot of time.\n2:45 Comment: Because they want to.\n2:57 Comment: Now the chance to make the city from a set piece.\n3:0 Comment: Break the game open here.\n3:3 Comment: In the second half.\n3:4 Comment: Toray.\n3:8 Comment: By his standards.\n3:15 Comment: Yeah, it was a chance the came down early from the Q.\n3:22 Comment: But what happened really.\n3:27 Comment: You know what we do sometimes sometimes it's just like to reduce the\n3:29 Comment: tension anyway.\n3:30 Comment: Yeah, it was a chance that came out of nothing really.\n3:35 Comment: You see the ball loops up in the air from the block on Yaya Tori, but he's so alert,\n3:39 Comment: expecting things, far more alert than the Spurs defence.\n3:42 Comment: As it's coming down from an awkward height, if there was anyone you say might keep that\n3:47 Comment: down and keep it on target it would be Aguero, but not this time.\n3:49 Comment: That is a consequence of having so many players around the ball, as Spurs did, there would\n3:53 Comment: be naturally some space elsewhere and Aguero filled that space.\n3:57 Comment: He also read the fact that there was a shot coming in and goal and he wanted to be out\n4:1 Comment: of the blocks first.\n4:3 Comment: Fantastic play to get himself the chance, just very Aguero-like in terms of the finish.\n4:28 Comment: A bit of pace in the passing from Toure.\n4:32 Comment: Kylisi.\n4:38 Comment: Son able to take it away from Fernando.\n4:42 Comment: Dinho there to help his midfield colleague out, but Eriksen finds Dembele.\n4:49 Comment: Son again.\n4:53 Comment: He can't get away with the ball and they have it.\n4:56 Comment: Son.\n4:58 Comment: Alli.\n5:0 Comment: All the while, Kane waiting in case they decide to put it into a central striking position.\n5:10 Comment: Still trying to work Manchester City around deeper areas.\n5:13 Comment: Dembele loses out.\n5:16 Comment: Now Toure in silver.\n5:20 Comment: Here comes Kylisi.\n5:22 Comment: He can probably get away from some teams, but not from Carl Walker's ability to redress\n5:27 Comment: and De Vrij's pressure on Aguero.\n5:29 Comment: Then Dier makes it from a very Argentine striker.\n5:36 Comment: Dembele.\n5:39 Comment: Dier.\n5:40 Comment: Son.\n5:45 Comment: Dier.\n5:47 Comment: A little bit too intricate in the end.\n5:51 Comment: It's not really giving Manchester City major problems defensively.\n5:55 Comment: One back again quickly by Dier.\n5:57 Comment: Mark Lattenberg seemed to put the whistle to his mouth.\n5:59 Comment: I think what he was probably doing was saying it hit the player in the face.\n6:2 Comment: I think that's the message he was trying to give to the other players there.\n6:11 Comment: Walker.\n6:17 Comment: Eriksen.\n6:21 Comment: Spurs playing calmly and with authority again.\n6:29 Comment: Ali, nicely worked to Walker.\n6:31 Comment: Now a chance to cross for Kane.\n6:32 Comment: It's deflected, it comes to Dembele.\n6:37 Comment: Eriksen.\n6:40 Comment: Rose.\n6:42 Comment: Charged down by Sterling.\n6:45 Comment: Charged down by Sterling with his arms out.\n6:48 Comment: Mark Lattenberg says penalty here.\n6:53 Comment: Incredible decision to make, but I think it may well be the right one.\n6:56 Comment: He spotted the handball.\n6:58 Comment: You see he's a long way away here and this shouldn't hit his arm as he goes up.\n7:1 Comment: Oh, it's harsh.\n7:4 Comment: It's harsh, I have to say, Martin.\n7:6 Comment: He's got his back to it.\n7:8 Comment: He's not stuck his arm out to deliberately block it.\n7:11 Comment: And then he's waited to see if it was inside the box.\n7:13 Comment: Probably got some help from a linesman and City stunned.\n7:20 Comment: Manchester City very rarely give away penalties.\n7:24 Comment: And this has happened in contentious circumstances.\n7:27 Comment: Harry Kane is 100% from the spot this season.\n7:33 Comment: It's a wonderful opportunity to give Tottenham a lead.\n7:37 Comment: Tottenham a lead.\n7:40 Comment: In terms of their general play, they probably deserve.\n7:44 Comment: Joe Hart, of course, an English colleague, trying everything he knows to put Kane off.\n7:50 Comment: It's a battle of wits here.\n7:52 Comment: An important moment on an important day.\n7:56 Comment: And Kane wins it and Tottenham lead.\n8:0 Comment: It's a very good penalty.\n8:2 Comment: Man City are raging.\n8:4 Comment: But Spurs have taken full advantage.\n8:8 Comment: Raheem Sterling, well, he can't believe he's been pulled up.\n8:14 Comment: He does turn his back to the ball.\n8:16 Comment: As we look at the penalty, he looks and makes sure he waits for Joe Hart to dive in.\n8:19 Comment: Goes down the middle with it.\n8:21 Comment: Clever, confident penalty.\n8:22 Comment: But here's the cross, here's the incident.\n8:24 Comment: Goes in, he's got his back to goal, he puts his leg up.\n8:27 Comment: It hits his ribs.\n8:28 Comment: May just have ricocheted up and touched the bottom of his elbow from that side.\n8:33 Comment: The first question was, was it in the area?\n8:35 Comment: Yeah, I think as much as the handball is a strange thing, I think he was quite quick to point there.\n8:40 Comment: That's why I thought maybe he had some help.\n8:44 Comment: But that is the first Premier League penalty that Man City have conceded for 13 months.\n8:52 Comment: And it's a controversial one without a shadow of a doubt.\n8:58 Comment: But Tottenham have converted it.\n9:6 Comment: It's blocked by Rose with his arm down by his side and it's a corner.\n9:10 Comment: Well, Sterling being switched to that side of the pitch hasn't paid off, has it?\n9:14 Comment: One of those unfortunate things, I feel, from a referee who was so sure, though.\n9:21 Comment: Gone to the near post of Fernandinho this time.\n9:26 Comment: Yeah, he found a bit of space, but the stadium is still stunned by what's happened to Raheem Sterling and Manchester City.\n9:32 Comment: We'll just see it from another angle here as he turns his back, the whip is in.\n9:37 Comment: It hits him in the hip and probably just underneath his elbow in truth.\n9:42 Comment: But it's a tough one. A tough one to take.\n9:46 Comment: You don't see many given.\n9:47 Comment: No, I was going to say, 99 out of 100 you probably wouldn't see given.\n9:51 Comment: But earlier in the day, the away team led at the Emirates with a penalty.\n9:59 Comment: With a penalty.\n10:0 Comment: And lost the game.\n10:1 Comment: The home team weren't happy with.\n10:4 Comment: Here's Gario Toure trying to steer it, but Martin Klattenberg has pulled play back for a free kick to City.\n10:15 Comment: Yeah, he's led. See if there's any advantage here.\n10:17 Comment: You'll see as he comes in.\n10:18 Comment: Oh, it's crude, isn't it?\n10:20 Comment: Vimerick once again just blocks Silva this time crudely.\n10:24 Comment: And true, fair play to Klattenberg.\n10:26 Comment: He waited to see if anything was going to happen from it.\n10:29 Comment: But he gave the free kick.\n10:31 Comment: Came back with no advantage.\n10:38 Comment: Well, they've had to work hard to get their noses in front.\n10:43 Comment: Spurs, that lead could be in jeopardy here.\n10:48 Comment: David Silva, the master of the craft of lifting over the wall.\n10:53 Comment: Gario Toure doesn't really favour the right footer.\n10:56 Comment: He is the one who does take it.\n10:58 Comment: Off the bar.\n11:1 Comment: Back by company.\n11:4 Comment: Up in the air by Vimerick, who gave the free kick away in the first place.\n11:7 Comment: Fernandinho heads it forward.\n11:8 Comment: Punched out by Lloris.\n11:9 Comment: Sterling pressed by Eriksen and others.\n11:15 Comment: What an escape for Spurs.\n11:17 Comment: Although that might still not be the entire picture as City come again.\n11:24 Comment: On the subsequent throw.\n11:28 Comment: It's a marvellous free kick.\n11:34 Comment: The indignation, really, the sense of injustice that Manchester City felt about the penalty award\n11:38 Comment: might just be a trigger for something better from them.\n11:42 Comment: That's the way it feels.\n11:43 Comment: The stadium has really come to life.\n11:44 Comment: They're angry but they're getting a response from the players too.\n11:47 Comment: Terrific free kick.\n11:48 Comment: You'll see lots of whip on it.\n11:50 Comment: Just too high.\n11:51 Comment: It would have been disappointing and true to the keeper if it had gone in.\n11:55 Comment: With the various scrimmage and they're shown hunger for the first time.\n11:57 Comment: Just look at the technique here.\n12:0 Comment: Just needed to get it down an inch or two.\n12:3 Comment: Lloris did look beaten.\n12:14 Comment: Come on, come on.\n12:22 Comment: Company.\n12:35 Comment: Manchester City asking questions of our technical department down at touchline level.\n12:40 Comment: Trying to give a bit of a verdict on the penalty award.\n12:43 Comment: It's going to change the circumstances now that Harry Kane has put it away.\n12:47 Comment: Past Joe Hart.\n12:51 Comment: Kane started the season slowly and actually got going against Manchester City\n12:54 Comment: when he scored in that 4-1 win.\n12:57 Comment: Back in September.\n13:3 Comment: We've really got a game on our hands now.\n13:6 Comment: City probably still into life, best way of describing it.\n13:10 Comment: I would say that our two top referees have been stung into action in this too.\n13:16 Comment: The double header at the top of the Barclays Premier League.\n13:20 Comment: Martin Atkinson earlier today.\n13:23 Comment: And Mark Flattenberg here.\n13:25 Comment: Technically speaking I think the ball did brush the underside of his elbow.\n13:29 Comment: Raheem Sterling.\n13:31 Comment: Would have been where it was.\n13:33 Comment: The edge of the box would have been with his back to goal and no real direct intent on handling it.\n13:39 Comment: I'm very surprised it was given.\n13:41 Comment: Technically I can see why he probably did it.\n13:47 Comment: Sterling doubly determined himself to repair the damage that decision has caused his team.\n13:56 Comment: A bit of success against Tottenham in his Liverpool days.\n14:1 Comment: Fernandinho.\n14:3 Comment: Nicely done, trying to slide it into Sterling's territory.\n14:7 Comment: He's been involved again.\n14:9 Comment: Zabaleta.\n14:14 Comment: Sterling.\n14:20 Comment: Beautifully weighted pass from David Silva for Zabaleta.\n14:25 Comment: He's probably not as mobile as Jan Vertonghen, the player he's filling in for.\n14:31 Comment: There's a bit more of him than Jan Vertonghen and he got something in the way of the cross.\n14:34 Comment: Yeah, quite an interception there.\n14:37 Comment: There's a number of City players rushing into the box to try and get on the end of Zabaleta's cross.\n14:42 Comment: Beginning to put the squeeze on now, alright Man City.\n14:49 Comment: Eriksen.\n14:52 Comment: City have got to be careful not to over-commit in the pursuit of getting what they will believe to be justice.\n14:57 Comment: Something from the game.\n15:2 Comment: Fernandinho.\n15:4 Comment: Aguero.\n15:7 Comment: Spurs backpedalling.\n15:10 Comment: Aguero.\n15:12 Comment: Such a regular torture of Tottenham.\n15:16 Comment: He was just crowded out, wasn't he?\n15:18 Comment: Once again, the white shirts were desperate to get at him and put him off and that's what it did.\n15:26 Comment: It is strange. Both these games, which we were looking forward to so much, and that's not to minimise the effect of the middle match of Liverpool\n15:32 Comment: against Afton Villa, but not such consequence at the title-winning end of the table.\n15:38 Comment: They both needed a penalty decision really to spark them into life and goodness knows that.\n15:42 Comment: The life down at the Emirates was fantastic after that and it should be the same here.\n15:50 Comment: Kompany.\n15:54 Comment: Sterling.\n15:59 Comment: Rose just really went to get the ball but it flew to Son.\n16:6 Comment: They've upped their game, Manchester City, in terms of the work rate and the tempo of their play.\n16:12 Comment: Just starting to see one or two signs of Spurs who are so fit and so confident and now have a lead to boost that confidence,\n16:19 Comment: but feeling the strain of the opposition raising their game.\n16:24 Comment: Yeah, but the manager now, he doesn't have a whole heap of options on the bench, certainly not in terms of experience in the first team,\n16:31 Comment: but his team are reacting okay up to now.\n16:35 Comment: Torre nearly sliding it through for Aguero, just round the far end of the far out.\n16:43 Comment: Huishi, did well to keep it in and get the ball ahead of Son.\n16:48 Comment: Silva.\n16:55 Comment: Turre.\n16:57 Comment: It's Abueleta.\n17:3 Comment: Sterling.\n17:8 Comment: Now David Silva.\n17:11 Comment: Having to prove now that they are the best defensive side in the Premier League.\n17:17 Comment: Huishi, up goes the giant of a man that is Yaya Turre.\n17:25 Comment: Well, we've got to look at it again now.\n17:27 Comment: We sure do. You see from this angle here, probably tells us that it's...\n17:33 Comment: I think most of it has hit his ribs, you know.\n17:37 Comment: And it's possibly the faintest touch, maybe even not, you know. I think it is so, so harsh.\n17:43 Comment: I think from that point there, I have to say, despite the fact that I rate this man Mark Claddingworth so highly, Raheem Sterling has been hard done by.\n17:50 Comment: And therefore Manchester City have been hard done by.\n17:57 Comment: And are these two back-to-back home games against Leicester and now Tottenham going to define their Premier League season in the wrong direction?\n18:11 Comment: Sterling.\n18:15 Comment: Fernando.\n18:16 Comment: On from David Silva.\n18:19 Comment: They really didn't play well against Leicester at all, City.\n18:22 Comment: There are signs that they're...\n18:24 Comment: Again, because they've been stung into this.\n18:28 Comment: Yes, it's all about...\n18:29 Comment: Aghast at the decision that was given.\n18:31 Comment: Absolutely, but it's about creating chances now and I think it looks like Arjen Aerts now is the one to try and liven that part of it up.\n18:40 Comment: How can they get in behind this resolute, Darius Spurs defence?\n18:43 Comment: The wrong way is to get a second striker on and that's what they're going to do.\n18:49 Comment: And here it's probably Fernando who's coming off.\n18:54 Comment: Ali.\n18:56 Comment: He just got his body in front and I think she was going to confront him.\n19:2 Comment: It was going to be a free kick for the Tottenham teenager.\n19:13 Comment: Not easy to stay calm in these circumstances.\n19:18 Comment: Yeah, he's a happy man, he doesn't show it.\n19:20 Comment: But he's got to get the same commitment in his next 25 minutes or so from the Spurs team.\n19:35 Comment: Eriksen takes.\n19:40 Comment: He's going to get it over the head of the front man, Kylishin.\n19:43 Comment: And it's Silva.\n19:45 Comment: That's a wonderful pass in the circumstances.\n19:47 Comment: It ran off the wall for Tua Gueller.\n19:50 Comment: And then they tried to play Sterling in.\n19:52 Comment: Oh, and it might be played in.\n19:54 Comment: And mistakes in the...\n19:56 Comment: ...Moussa Dembele.\n20:6 Comment: Kane.\n20:7 Comment: He's behind himself.\n20:12 Comment: Flags up the offside against the player.\n20:15 Comment: Yeah, just a little bit sluggish getting back in.\n20:18 Comment: City are pressing hard but it looked as if they'd got themselves an open chance here.\n20:23 Comment: When Aguero turned and the ball ricocheted nicely after this pass through, he kind of miscontrolled it.\n20:29 Comment: But just look at Rahim Sterling up at the top and he sees him, sees him late.\n20:32 Comment: And when he does see him, doesn't put a good ball in.\n21:2 Comment: Kylishin.\n21:5 Comment: Can't get it beyond Aldevair.\n21:9 Comment: Ali.\n21:11 Comment: Son.\n21:13 Comment: Ali again.\n21:18 Comment: Kane looks it into feet but he looks for Son.\n21:21 Comment: Oh, it might reach Son. There's a chance here.\n21:24 Comment: And there's a hand ball for the Manchester City fans.\n21:28 Comment: Yeah, so...\n21:29 Comment: In the right direction.\n21:30 Comment: Ironic cheers from them.\n21:32 Comment: Of Man City's doing this.\n21:34 Comment: Should have cleared that quite easily.\n21:36 Comment: Yeah, there's the hand ball.\n21:37 Comment: Correctly given.\n21:39 Comment: City get to build again.\n21:41 Comment: Hand ball is the more orthodox variety, should we say, in these circumstances.\n21:49 Comment: Sterling.\n22:1 Comment: Kane.\n22:2 Comment: Kane Hatcher.\n22:4 Comment: Tiedy earned some international recognition from his first team appearances for Man City with Nigeria.\n22:16 Comment: Tom Carroll has some instructions in the top of the dugout.\n22:24 Comment: Don't ask me why, but players don't wear their match shirts until they're called on.\n22:31 Comment: I have no idea, Martin.\n22:33 Comment: I've spent enough time on the bench to be able to speak with authority in this, but I've always worn my jersey.\n22:40 Comment: I mean, that Joe, troubling Tottenham with some direct running there. Dembele did well.\n22:49 Comment: It's not a cool thing to do, apparently, these days for the substitutes.\n22:52 Comment: Tom Carroll is now properly shirted up.\n23:1 Comment: Now he's trying to bite into fate.\n23:10 Comment: Kane's just a little bit too anxious there to try and make something happen.\n23:14 Comment: He's desperate to make up for the injustice that happened and he's trying really hard.\n23:18 Comment: But he's needed to take it a little bit cooler on that last particular instance.\n23:25 Comment: Dyer.\n23:31 Comment: Eriksen.\n23:36 Comment: It's an easy foul. De Vrijal from Walker's header.\n23:41 Comment: Tottenham certainly giving the ball away more in this part of the match than they have been previously.\n23:49 Comment: But as long as they can still keep closing down, they'll be okay.\n23:53 Comment: You'll see in the last 10 minutes, City are kind of getting in at them, getting closer to goal.\n23:59 Comment: Not creating a whole lot, it has to be said.\n24:2 Comment: Hit the bar from the free kick, but other than that, I think they're being contained okay by Tottenham.\n24:7 Comment: A little more needed, though, from Man City.\n24:9 Comment: You don't sense a sea change in the game.\n24:16 Comment: Valley caught out by Zabaleta.\n24:23 Comment: Tottenham with a man down.\n24:29 Comment: Yeah, Harry Kane's only going to keep the ball in play, right?\n24:31 Comment: Danny Rose is still going.\n24:35 Comment: Decides to kick it out now.\n24:37 Comment: Some questions have been asked to him.\n24:39 Comment: Company is not happy and Zabaleta, furious that he didn't just kick it out so that Fizio could come on for Harry Kane.\n24:45 Comment: Rose has sensibly walked away from it.\n24:48 Comment: Manchester City trying to play on.\n24:51 Comment: Because they think they're entitled to do that.\n24:53 Comment: Yeah, there's a strong challenge from Zabaleta.\n24:55 Comment: He gets the ball and comes through.\n24:56 Comment: We'll watch it here.\n24:58 Comment: No problem with him getting the ball.\n24:59 Comment: There's a follow through which catches Harry Kane.\n25:2 Comment: There's a little bit on it, isn't there?\n25:3 Comment: Yeah, no doubt about that.\n25:5 Comment: He's okay.\n25:6 Comment: He's got a bit of a touch.\n25:8 Comment: He's still got a bit of a touch.\n25:9 Comment: He's still got a touch.\n25:14 Comment: He's okay.\n25:15 Comment: He'll be all right to go on.\n25:17 Comment: Referee allows City to go ahead and play on.\n25:22 Comment: There's a real edge to proceedings now here.\n25:28 Comment: We're still waiting for the right moment to bring Carroll on.\n25:38 Comment: They took it out on Danny Rose rather than Harry Kane staying down.\n25:41 Comment: But who's the first target?\n25:43 Comment: City.\n25:46 Comment: Sterling.\n25:49 Comment: And Virelde.\n25:51 Comment: Sees it out.\n25:52 Comment: Goal kick.\n25:53 Comment: Yeah, this is probably his first involvement in the game since coming on, Iheanacho.\n25:58 Comment: Didn't go well from there.\n25:59 Comment: Spurs now in a further effort to contain Manchester City.\n26:3 Comment: Carroll comes on.\n26:13 Comment: Tom Carroll, much more of a hard-working midfield player.\n26:17 Comment: Although he's done his stint in the middle of the pitch today.\n26:22 Comment: It's an attacker by instinct.\n26:25 Comment: A change of emphasis.\n26:32 Comment: I think to try and protect what's in front of the Spurs defence is important now.\n26:37 Comment: You see.\n26:38 Comment: Carroll is probably going to hold up a position on the right side.\n26:45 Comment: Dier and Dembele hold the anchor in front of the back four.\n26:48 Comment: It's about retaining possession now and not allowing City just to keep coming at them.\n26:53 Comment: And Carroll's energy and legs and ability should help to do that.\n26:57 Comment: Eriksen.\n26:59 Comment: Tom Carroll is joining in in the middle.\n27:0 Comment: Eriksen going on.\n27:2 Comment: Torre encouraging Christian Eriksen and telling him to get on with the throw.\n27:8 Comment: Down by Walker.\n27:9 Comment: Carroll.\n27:13 Comment: Walker again.\n27:16 Comment: And Eriksen.\n27:18 Comment: And Tom Carroll.\n27:20 Comment: And Eriksen.\n27:22 Comment: And Tom Carroll.\n27:29 Comment: Walker again.\n27:31 Comment: Dier.\n27:39 Comment: I'm sure Spurs would have expected the second half to be more testing.\n27:42 Comment: But they wouldn't have expected away from home to get the sort of penalty that they've been given.\n27:48 Comment: Sure. They've taken advantage of it.\n27:51 Comment: They've got themselves a great opportunity right now.\n27:56 Comment: Everything they can to hold on to it.\n27:58 Comment: And it's Carroll trying to flick it on.\n28:2 Comment: Dembele.\n28:5 Comment: There goes City's way. Dembele's not happy with that.\n28:16 Comment: Zabaleta.\n28:19 Comment: In action. Zabaleta.\n28:21 Comment: Sterling.\n28:25 Comment: Torre.\n28:26 Comment: Silva.\n28:31 Comment: It'll be the ultimate test now of Tottenham's ability to defend.\n28:36 Comment: Cliché.\n28:38 Comment: Oh, what a finish from Ithi in that joke.\n28:45 Comment: It's a splendid equaliser for Manchester City.\n28:48 Comment: And Tottenham couldn't defend that attack.\n28:51 Comment: He absolutely buried it.\n28:52 Comment: Oh, it was terrific. Into the roof of the net in the top corner.\n28:55 Comment: Cliché puts a wonderful ball. Silva hasn't done a lot all game.\n28:58 Comment: Just feeds in with Cliché. They're looking for things to do.\n29:3 Comment: He then gives him the ball back. He gets the run.\n29:5 Comment: And Walker.

    "summary": "In a pulsating Premier League encounter, Tottenham Hotspur edged out Manchester City with a 2-1 victory at the Etihad Stadium, in a match filled with highly debated decisions, dramatic moments, and critical shifts in momentum.\n\nThe atmosphere was electric from the outset, with spectators eagerly anticipating which approach would prevail in this clash of football titans. The weather was perfect, setting the stage for an engaging match. The early moments of the game saw both teams trying to settle into their play styles, with each looking to carve out an opening.\n\nTottenham demonstrated their characteristic work ethic, a trait that has been ingrained into them by Mauricio Pochettino. They appeared lean, mean, and eager to show they were serious contenders in the race for the Premier League title. The defensive organization from Spurs was notable, with players like Danny Rose and Kyle Walker flying forward energetically but always keeping an eye on their defensive duties. The team's pressing game was on display as they hassled Manchester City out of their rhythm.\n\nFrom the start, Tottenham’s tactics were clear—tighten up defensively, press tirelessly, and take the game to Manchester City whenever possible. They grew into the game, systematically working through City's lines. There were moments that encapsulated Tottenham’s determination and defensive organization, such as when Danny Rose made a crucial block from a goal-bound Raheem Sterling attempt.\n\nOn the other hand, Manchester City, led by captain Vincent Kompany, struggled to find their groove. Despite their early efforts to involve key players like Sergio Agüero and David Silva, they seldomly found a breakthrough against the resolute Spurs defense, led by Alderweireld and the newly included Kevin Wimmer. City's erratic form over their last 16 games, involving seven wins, played into this. Key misses and defensive lapses were symptomatic of a broader inconsistency.\n\nThe first half saw few clear-cut chances, with both teams largely cancelling each other out. City's attempts to find their talisman Agüero in scoring positions were stifled efficiently by Tottenham’s disciplined defensive lines. Manchester City, themselves renowned for their offensive prowess, labored to create a moment of magic, often being forced out wide or caught in possession by Spurs' midfield enforcers like Mousa Dembele.\n\nThe game’s first truly controversial moment came in the second half when a high-intensity Spurs push into City’s penalty area resulted in a handball decision against Raheem Sterling. A deep crossfield ball generated a scramble in City's box, with Danny Rose’s cross appearing to strike Sterling’s arm as he turned his back to it. Despite Sterling’s protests and the uncertainty of intentional handball, the penalty was awarded after deliberation. Harry Kane stepped up and calmly slotted the penalty past Joe Hart, giving Spurs the lead.\n\nThis decision sparked City into life. Fired up by a sense of injustice, Manchester City intensified their efforts, spurred by the crowd's reaction and their quest to right the perceived wrongs. This new-found aggression nearly paid off moments later when Yaya Toure’s curling free kick struck the crossbar. City’s hunger was palpable as they pushed forward with a renewed sense of urgency.\n\nManuel Pellegrini sought fresh impetus by bringing on Kelechi Iheanacho, a decision reminiscent of similar effective tactical shifts seen earlier in the season. This decision bore fruit as City mounted increased pressure on the Spurs defense. A swift and decisive move from Gael Clichy down the left flank ended with a perfectly executed cross to the on-rushing Iheanacho, who hammered the ball into the roof of the net, leveling the match and igniting hope among the home supporters.\n\nBut just as the game seemed to be heading towards a potentially favorable draw for City, Spurs showed remarkable grit and resilience. A fantastic run by Erik Lamela saw him weave through City’s midfield, threading a precise through ball to Christian Eriksen. As Eriksen found himself through on goal, he controlled the ball superbly before finishing with aplomb, delivering a sucker punch to City and tipping the balance sharply in Tottenham's favor once again.\n\nThe final minutes of the match saw Spurs tighten their defense further, with Mauricio Pochettino urging his players to hold onto this slender but crucial advantage. Manchester City continued to press, throwing everything they had at the Tottenham defense. There were critical last-ditch clearances, significant blocks, and moments where the ball bounced tantalizingly in the Spurs penalty area but never quite fell kindly for a City player.\n\nIn the dying moments, the pressure mounted as City intensified their search for another equalizer. Raheem Sterling flicked a cross into the box, only for the ball to evade Agüero casually. Tottenham’s defense held firm, showcasing the disciplined structure that had been the bedrock of their season.\n\nThe final whistle brought immense relief to the Spurs side and their fans, who could hardly contain their joy at the away triumph. Mauricio Pochettino's men exhibited not just tactical acumen but tremendous tenacity and fighting spirit to claim a win that has massive ramifications for the title race.\n\nFor Manchester City, this result was a setback. Critically, they failed to capitalize on home advantage, and despite some moments of brilliance, they couldn't overcome a resolute and well-drilled Spurs team. Questions continued over the pending managerial transition with Pep Guardiola set to take over next season, and whether the uncertainty was affecting the current squad’s performances.\n\nFor Tottenham, the victory was emblematic of their season under Pochettino—a blend of tactical innovation, physical endurance, and collective endeavor. Their drive and determination to stay in the title race were unmistakable, with this win reinforcing their credentials as genuine contenders.\n\nThis match was a splendid showcase of Premier League football's unpredictable and entertaining nature, underlined by contentious refereeing decisions, moments of individual brilliance, and unyielding team spirit—a truly memorable encounter that will be talked about for seasons to come."
