Comment: He left here the right way, I think the locals feel.\n8:34 Comment: It's time as Ronald Koeman put it for him to just move up.\n8:39 Comment: So, I think to wanting to move up as a club.\n8:44 Comment: The target being, I guess, to be signing players from Manchester United and Liverpool,\n8:49 Comment: rather than selling them to them.\n8:52 Comment: Well, the summer before

move.\n9:1 Comment: Hasn't there been sweetness and light for those who have left for supposedly greener pastures?\n9:9 Comment: There's a way of life down here that I think the players get used to when they move up to those northern cities.\n9:15 Comment: It's a little bit different.\n9:17 Comment: Expectations maybe a little bit higher.\n9:21 Comment: What they are leaving behind is a wonderful training ground here.\n9:24 Comment: Spent about the same amount of money Manchester United has spent on this fellow, Martial.\n9:29 Comment: Probably a fixed 37 million.\n9:31 Comment: A complex that would stand comparison with any in the Premier League, indeed any in Europe.\n9:41 Comment: Pelle.\n9:42 Comment: He's got the drop on Glyn.\n9:47 Comment: Awkward for Hadditch to take.\n9:50 Comment: He's run to Pelle with Mane.\n9:54 Comment: A run by Ronald Koeman, identified.\n9:56 Comment: Daley-Blin, he's not happy Daley-Blin, he's having a go at the linesman down this side.\n10:0 Comment: Thinks he's been pushed.\n10:2 Comment: He's just so tall, physically out-muscled, Daley-Blin.\n10:5 Comment: And puts a bit of a speculative crossing.\n10:7 Comment: It's good control from Tadic, good little one-two.\n10:10 Comment: And just drags.\n10:12 Comment: This right-footed shot.\n10:14 Comment: This is the little nudge there.\n10:15 Comment: There is a nudge in the back from Pelle.\n10:16 Comment: He's got a point, Daley-Blin.\n10:19 Comment: They had one or two problems down at Swansea, didn't they, with the power of Bafatoumbe Gomez.\n10:27 Comment: Manchester United actually coming here having lost away at Swansea and away, of course, in the Champions League.\n10:34 Comment: And I think until he starts dealing with bigger players, he said at Swansea there's some problems.\n10:38 Comment: I think that will have given Pelle some encouragement and Southampton.\n10:42 Comment: Teams will always try and target Daley-Blin on that side of the game.\n10:46 Comment: But everything will range in00 terror.\n10:47 Comment: Let's see what happens.\n10:49 Comment: Rene...\n10:50 Comment: ...taken by...\n10:52 Comment: ...Wanyama.\n10:55 Comment: Mane.\n10:59 Comment: See, Mane's getting into good spaces.\n11:1 Comment: Tadic's with a great cross too.\n11:4 Comment: And in the end, Rocco...\n11:6 Comment: ...stabbed the foot out of it, successful as it turned out.\n11:9 Comment: Well, it was good defending from Blind and Raho.\n11:11 Comment: It was a nightmare for Blind.\n11:13 Comment: He lets it go, and that's what I mean by good defending,\n11:16 Comment: because I think if he touches that, it's a goal.\n11:18 Comment: He has to trust his defender behind him.\n11:20 Comment: And Raho's there, it's a wonderful, wonderful cross from Tadic.\n11:24 Comment: Nightmare to deal with.\n11:26 Comment: Raho...\n11:27 Comment: ...relief...\n11:29 Comment: ...for him.\n11:31 Comment: No-one knows how close he was.\n11:38 Comment: Go back for Manchester United.\n11:40 Comment: And Pender...\n11:42 Comment: ...diving De Gea back on his line.\n11:48 Comment: Get away.\n11:51 Comment: Rashida...\n11:53 Comment: ...stopped Depay's movement.\n11:56 Comment: Mark Plattenberg in charge.\n12:0 Comment: Rooney.\n12:3 Comment: Yeah, he's too deep-weighted Rooney at the moment.\n12:4 Comment: Where Mane's picking the ball up, he's in dangerous areas.\n12:8 Comment: He's playing more like a midfield player.\n12:18 Comment: It's good to see that now.\n12:19 Comment: Pasha, Pasha, Pasha, Pasha, Pasha, Pasha.\n12:21 Comment: Go on, go on.\n12:22 Comment: It was Mane.\n12:23 Comment: That's not a good position, was it?\n12:24 Comment: That's not a good position.\n12:25 Comment: I think it's going to be a good position again.\n12:26 Comment: Ward-Brash trying to pick him out in the middle.\n12:28 Comment: And he has a wonderful save.\n12:29 Comment: And Pallard follows up.\n12:30 Comment: And Southampton take the lead here in the 13th minute, nothing unlucky about that.\n12:31 Comment: It was fine football.\n12:32 Comment: But Hayer made a wonderful stop from Mane, but it rolled for the big Italian.\n12:33 Comment: And he gobbled up the chair in the middle.\n12:34 Comment: Good job by Mane.\n12:35 Comment: Good job.\n12:36 Comment: Good job, good job.\n12:37 Comment: And he's got the ball back to the left wing.\n12:38 Comment: That's it.\n12:39 Comment: APPLAUSE\n12:41 Comment: De Gea made a wonderful stop from Mane,\n12:43 Comment: but it rolled for the big Italian, and he gobbled up the chance.\n12:50 Comment: Well, they look the more dangerous team, Southampton.\n12:53 Comment: See Mane in that position, in behind United's midfield and centre-backs,\n12:56 Comment: and that's where it comes from,\n12:58 Comment: and you knew Ward-Prowse was going to deliver.\n13:0 Comment: Hard to say it's a wonderful reaction save from De Gea,\n13:2 Comment: but Pellis following up,\n13:4 Comment: and United's midfield too haven't come to terms with Mane yet.\n13:7 Comment: And Southampton started the stronger, now one in front.\n13:11 Comment: What a save from De Gea.\n13:13 Comment: That's a simple tapping in the end for Pella.\n13:20 Comment: Well, he scored here against Manchester United last season,\n13:23 Comment: it wasn't enough for Ronald Koeman and his men.\n13:26 Comment: And he ended empty-handed on that Monday evening.\n13:32 Comment: And here on a sunny Sunday...\n13:34 Comment: THEY CHANT\n13:36 Comment: ..they have broken through in some style.\n13:38 Comment: Had it been Mane's goal, I think it would have really gone down as a classic,\n13:43 Comment: because a wonderful ball from Ward-Prowse,\n13:46 Comment: who has such a great delivery in his range of skills,\n13:51 Comment: from dead ball and moving ball situations.\n13:54 Comment: And here's Depay.\n14:0 Comment: Martial.\n14:2 Comment: Well, Manchester United have got a small in Blin,\n14:4 Comment: Schneidlin and Carrick, a lot of experience there,\n14:7 Comment: but at the moment they're not picking Mane up,\n14:9 Comment: he's drifting into spaces in between that square.\n14:13 Comment: And you've got to communicate between them,\n14:15 Comment: it's a good play from Southampton, though, good from Mane.\n14:18 Comment: Exactly what a number 10 should be doing.\n14:26 Comment: It's interesting, Gary, because I understand that had Blin played at left-back,\n14:30 Comment: Mane would have played on the right.\n14:32 Comment: THEY CHANT\n14:33 Comment: We've had a different scenario, different players,\n14:36 Comment: but the way so far it's worked out, it's worked out for Rahm Kumin and Southampton.\n14:42 Comment: THEY CHANT\n14:43 Comment: You see where Wayne Rooney's picking the ball up,\n14:45 Comment: goal side of Wanyama and Ramey,\n14:47 Comment: he's got to try and live in that space in behind the Southampton central midfield players.\n14:51 Comment: Wanyama's gone back with him there to the left of your screen now.\n14:55 Comment: They're attending to Wayne Rooney.\n14:57 Comment: Manchester United's midfield and centre-backs haven't attended to Mane.\n15:3 Comment: THEY CHANT\n15:13 Comment: It's the fifth meeting between the two Dutch coaches,\n15:18 Comment: and the previous four, the odd statistic is the away side,\n15:21 Comment: if the away manager has always won.\n15:23 Comment: THEY CHANT\n15:25 Comment: They'd go against that particular piece of history of Southampton\n15:29 Comment: to move on from here and repell it, and they'll do it now.\n15:31 Comment: THEY CHANT\n15:33 Comment: It's a good thing they've got a player like that,\n15:35 Comment: because if they don't, they're going to be a real threat to the team.\n15:37 Comment: THEY CHANT\n15:39 Comment: Well done, De Gea, screened at his defenders, and rightly so,\n15:42 Comment: they're all at sea.\n15:43 Comment: Chris Morley played a real risky pass,\n15:46 Comment: and then Pella's one-on-one with Daley Blind.\n15:49 Comment: And he really is a fantastic opportunity to put his team 2-0 up.\n15:53 Comment: He might rue that one come the end of the match,\n15:57 Comment: but you can see De Gea fuming.\n16:1 Comment: THEY CHANT\n16:3 Comment: Just now think of those extensions of this pitch so well...\n16:12 Comment: Rapo, not all from Ward-Prowse...\n16:19 Comment: Splendid start here by Southampton,\n16:22 Comment: a one-way day, not one it can beat,\n16:26 Comment: to have days like the 3-0 at home to Everton...\n16:31 Comment: THEY CHANT\n16:33 Comment: it's just their first time fixture of the season in the Premier League\n16:38 Comment: the bottom is green demonstrates the stronger team in this first 15 16\n16:42 Comment: minutes\n16:46 Comment: yes yeah\n16:51 Comment: is the hope\n16:54 Comment: the dangerous to fight\n16:57 Comment: space here for Marseille\n17:2 Comment: the danger of defied attractive seven to close to the ball and left Marseille\n17:7 Comment: you're absolutely right they all got towards the pie but he's pops it off\n17:11 Comment: around four of them maybe a little bit more time than he recognized\n17:27 Comment: the\n17:30 Comment: she'd\n17:32 Comment: put up by the parents of\n17:37 Comment: you\n17:42 Comment: she'd\n17:44 Comment: must be excited by the news from the

APPLAUSE\n18:59 Comment: It's been frustrating, first 15, 20 minutes for Wayne Rooney,\n19:4 Comment: not been able to get in the game at all.\n19:7 Comment: He hasn't played too much, of course, this season,\n19:9 Comment: in the slightly withdrawn role.\n19:13 Comment: No, he went there in the last 15, 20 minutes\n19:15 Comment: when Chicharito came on against Newcastle Old Trafford.\n19:19 Comment: About a month back.\n19:21 Comment: The game improved, actually, at that point.\n19:23 Comment: United couldn't get the goal.\n19:24 Comment: And he went there when Roy Hodgson sent on Harry Kane.\n19:28 Comment: Yeah.\n19:30 Comment: And then against Switzerland, that worked well.\n19:35 Comment: That's another Wood class ball.\n19:39 Comment: Tadic.\n19:41 Comment: Still Tadic.\n19:45 Comment: Put ahead of by Michael Carrick for United.\n19:48 Comment: And again, it originates down this side.\n19:49 Comment: They're just playing long balls into this channel,\n19:52 Comment: to Pella, around Lahore and Glynn.\n19:53 Comment: And winning the second balls.\n19:56 Comment: Target.\n19:58 Comment: Good technique.\n20:0 Comment: From Ward-Prowse again.\n20:5 Comment: A little bit of space for Ward-Prowse at the edge of the box.\n20:7 Comment: No-one picking him up.\n20:9 Comment: And then trying to get out to him.\n20:11 Comment: Straight down to Hayes' throw.\n20:13 Comment: That's put two or three fantastic balls in so far, Ward-Prowse.\n20:16 Comment: Yes.\n20:16 Comment: And he comes up for him.\n20:21 Comment: End of the spread.\n20:22 Comment: Brank third base for

that.\n27:51 Comment: I don't know if Pant and Bo look round,\n27:53 Comment: whether they saw the actual incident, heard the roar from the crowd.\n27:57 Comment: Mato was chasing back.\n28:0 Comment: And Tabic's just chucked one off.\n28:2 Comment: A little one, little trick.\n28:4 Comment: There's not too much in it.\n28:12 Comment: And Mato played his last game for Chelsea in the Premier League

text for Yoshida.\n28:55 Comment: And...\n28:57 Comment: A bit cynical from Schneiderlin.\n29:1 Comment: Mark Plattenberg assessing his reaction before trying to have a word with the player.\n29:6 Comment: It's a result of the way United are playing.\n29:8 Comment: Weymar really gives it away from a midfield position.\n29:10 Comment: Schneiderlin arrives late from a centre-back position,\n29:13 Comment: almost so deep back up the pitch.\n29:20 Comment: Central midfield players going back there,\n29:22 Comment: doing passing that centre-backs can do.\n29:31 Comment: Pella, come on then, Gary. Who picks up Mane?\n29:34 Comment: Well, I think at the moment they've got to make sure\n29:37 Comment: that space between the midfielders,\n29:40 Comment: United's back two and the midfield two is tighter for a start.\n29:43 Comment: I don't think it's a man-to-man job.\n29:46 Comment: The back two, the front two, the United's back two have only got Pella.\n29:50 Comment: And in some ways, at the moment they're not dealing with it.\n29:53 Comment: I would say it's more of a unit thing, a compact thing between the units,\n29:57 Comment: but they're not right at the moment.\n29:59 Comment: It's better for United that now, with Smalling moving up the pitch.\n30:2 Comment: Schneiderlin wants to go deep, Carrick's gone deep.\n30:6 Comment: Here's Damien.\n30:8 Comment: Now Martial.\n30:10 Comment: Setting off.\n30:13 Comment: And they're wanting in the end to slide Depay in,\n30:16 Comment: but Depay could stay back in his heels,\n30:18 Comment: probably because he's thought about staying onside,\n30:21 Comment: but he's almost watching in admiration Martial's progress.\n30:26 Comment: Pella's bullying United at the moment,\n30:28 Comment: he's doing what he wants on the pitch.\n30:40 Comment: That's a very good start for the game.\n30:45 Comment: After one cup action coming up for you live on Sky Sports.\n30:49 Comment: The Second City Derby, Villa against Birmingham.\n30:53 Comment: On Tuesday from 7, Sky Sports won the North London Derby.\n30:57 Comment: On Wednesday, same time, same channel, different day.\n31:0 Comment: Spurs v Arsenal.\n31:2 Comment: FANS ROAR\n31:10 Comment: Shoddy.\n31:12 Comment: So you've got a situation now where United's midfield two and back two.\n31:16 Comment: Four of them, Mane and Pella, are in front of them.\n31:21 Comment: A switch at the moment, Tanić behind...\n31:24 Comment: It's just happened in normal play.\n31:26 Comment: Tanić off the front.\n31:28 Comment: APPLAUSE\n31:30 Comment: Mane just drifting left.\n31:34 Comment: Smooth play from Blind. Now Carrick.\n31:41 Comment: That's Rojo. Rooney.\n31:46 Comment: Mata.

Couldn't take the ball with it.\n32:56 Comment: Pella.\n32:58 Comment: And to Klaas.\n32:59 Comment: And to Klippek over Blind.\n33:1 Comment: They've got no elevation at all.\n33:3 Comment: And here's Rooney.\n33:4 Comment: Looking for somebody to his right, but there wasn't anyone.\n33:10 Comment: Because Mata is in this part of the pitch.\n33:14 Comment: Rojo.\n33:16 Comment: Rooney.\n33:19 Comment: And Damian, the right back, has got forward.\n33:22 Comment: APPLAUSE\n33:26 Comment: And Poulsen trying to...\n33:27 Comment: I think they're trying to lock down Manchester United here,\n33:30 Comment: but they're only the game to go still.\n33:37 Comment: The problem is, United, you've got a team that happen to pass the ball back.\n33:41 Comment: And I think Southampton will be happy at this moment in time.\n33:44 Comment: They've made extra work for them, that's the question.\n33:46 Comment: Can they keep up with it, Southampton?\n33:48 Comment: It's hot out there.\n33:53 Comment: And it runs through for Mata, can he reach it?\n33:55 Comment: Martial, lovely turn, lovely goal.\n33:58 Comment: He has done it again.\n34:2 Comment: And Manchester United are level through this very talented teenager,\n34:9 Comment: who is bursting onto the English scene since his move from Monaco.\n34:15 Comment: I have to say, there's a lot of possession.\n34:18 Comment: Southampton were absolutely kicking themselves.\n34:20 Comment: They clear the ball.\n34:22 Comment: And the ball comes back in.\n34:23 Comment: No, he's just off the bat.\n34:25 Comment: Offside, Juan Mata.\n34:27 Comment: He gets back on.\n34:28 Comment: It's a wonderful tackle from Hichida, but it falls to Martial.\n34:31 Comment: I have to say, it's wonderful composure.\n34:33 Comment: Van Dijk goes to block the first shot.\n34:35 Comment: He is just offside there, coming back from play.\n34:38 Comment: Juan Mata, but that bit of play there from Martial is fantastic.\n34:43 Comment: He sells.\n34:44 Comment: Van Dijk, who dives in at him.\n34:47 Comment: That's what you want from your striker.\n34:49 Comment: Composure, who works himself a position and slots it away\n34:52 Comment: and gets his team level out of nothing.\n34:55 Comment: Well, as manager says, he's one for the future.\n34:59 Comment: The immediate future.\n35:12 Comment: But were they, Gary, inviting a bit of pressure, Southampton?\n35:14 Comment: They were.\n35:15 Comment: You can always say that when they conceded a goal.\n35:17 Comment: I think they were comfortable.\n35:19 Comment: Manchester United didn't look like creating a chance, let alone a goal.\n35:22 Comment: But then that little bit, lack of concentration.\n35:24 Comment: I'm sure they'll claim a little bit of bad luck with the offside,\n35:27 Comment: but it's wonderful in the end for Martial.\n35:35 Comment: Well, the expectation was on him.\n35:38 Comment: He's answered big questions in his first week.\n35:40 Comment: Doesn't seem to be fazed by the expectation.\n35:42 Comment: No. He looks cold.\n35:44 Comment: There's no emotion.\n35:45 Comment: Doesn't look over-excited now he's scored.\n35:48 Comment: It's a good sign.\n35:52 Comment: Last foul.\n35:54 Comment: Of a typical age to do the same sort of thing was Enrico Makeda.\n36:1 Comment: Fought against Villa and Sunderland in his first two Premier League experiences.\n36:8 Comment: And didn't kick on.\n36:12 Comment: One would be surprised if you're saying the same about Martial.\n36:25 Comment: I think he's having a hard time in流.\n36:34 Comment: Only lighting of the green light for a while and then the changing of light for dotted shot.\n36:39 Comment: stays down but it might go up\n36:51 Comment: we're looking at the Sun in the eyes maybe well look at it again as to where\n36:56 Comment: the linesman's position was was he in line with the game the ball that got\n37:0 Comment: cleared up the pitch obviously willing out with the defense\n37:9 Comment: here it is now the ball gets cleared the linesman there at the top of your screen\n37:14 Comment: he's not in line he's looking through him at target\n37:18 Comment: I'd say it looks like a comfortable offer for him to give\n37:22 Comment: but he doesn't\n37:24 Comment: Southampton are always hoping\n37:39 Comment: one-one first half which certainly benefited from the early goal and the\n37:45 Comment: way Southampton set about their task\n37:54 Comment: blind\n38:9 Comment: I think what makes it even better for Martial is that he's not been involved in the game that much\n38:14 Comment: to actually think that he's got one moment in what's 35 minutes and then\n38:20 Comment: when it comes to him he doesn't panic he doesn't snatch it he's there he's ready\n38:23 Comment: he makes it more impressive he's done in a match what many a player at this level\n38:28 Comment: can do in training he's actually done it in the heat of the battle his\n38:32 Comment: team's 1-0 down and with the drag back he's dragged Manchester United back into the\n38:39 Comment: into parity and the chance maybe to go on and get the\n38:44 Comment: success that would take them to second in the table\n38:52 Comment: blind certainly quite the atmosphere here in\n38:57 Comment: St Mary's\n38:59 Comment: any of these fans would have seen a lot of Manchester United successes in the last decade or so\n39:4 Comment: since this new stadium was opened change from the Dell of course\n39:8 Comment: and then the new stadium was opened change from the Dell of course\n39:14 Comment: we always wait to see what strip they change into it will never be grey again\n39:23 Comment: doubt it\n39:26 Comment: those United fans that you saw there that in voice now but they certainly\n39:30 Comment: weren't too happy before that goal wanting the team to push forward\n39:37 Comment: I'm not sure why they're so angry\n39:41 Comment: is\n40:9 Comment: is is is just too long\n40:10 Comment: is only one\n40:13 Comment: only one\n40:15 Comment: the Shields\n40:15 Comment: the Shields of a\n40:16 Comment: the Shields of the United\n40:18 Comment: of Definitely\n40:32 Comment: ace\n40:32

from Southampton.\n40:44 Comment: Similar to the goal that Manchester United scored.\n40:47 Comment: In that sense,\n40:49 Comment: that is so close to it.\n40:52 Comment: And Dijk just got a despairing foot to it.\n41:0 Comment: This morning has come up.\n41:2 Comment: Two against one.\n41:3 Comment: Corner.\n41:5 Comment: Manchester United's favourite in by Depay.\n41:8 Comment: Another corner.\n41:14 Comment: Manchester!\n41:20 Comment: We've got something planned again.\n41:21 Comment: Manchester United blins just...\n41:24 Comment: They have.\n41:24 Comment: It involves Van Matten.\n41:27 Comment: And it so nearly came off.\n41:30 Comment: Wait for Schneiderlin.\n41:31 Comment: You can see it happening.\n41:32 Comment: I mean, Southampton have got to be alive.\n41:34 Comment: They must have seen what happened last week with Manchester United in the set-pieces.\n41:38 Comment: Fantastic.\n41:38 Comment: Van Matten.\n41:43 Comment: Deeper from Depay.\n41:47 Comment: Carrick trying to help ring-fence.\n41:50 Comment: So I think to Pantieria.\n41:55 Comment: And then he had dropped in.\n41:57 Comment: I think what fooled Southampton at the corner,\n41:59 Comment: it was that Blind was further back.\n42:1 Comment: And I think Warcross was getting drawn out towards Daley Blind,\n42:3 Comment: thinking something was going to go to him.\n42:5 Comment: And Matten's running to the side of him.\n42:8 Comment: And he's got a bit lucky there.\n42:10 Comment: And there's a little bit lucky there.\n42:13 Comment: Pant.\n42:14 Comment: Now Romero.\n42:15 Comment: Now Warcross for Southampton.\n42:18 Comment: Having lost the initiative.\n42:20 Comment: And they find it hard to regain it.\n42:22 Comment: As you say, Manchester United won one half-time.\n42:25 Comment: And you mentioned the Pella miss.\n42:26 Comment: Yeah.\n42:27 Comment: The shot that hit the outside of the post is possibly being a turning point.\n42:35 Comment: There's Yoshida.\n42:36 Comment: There's a big chance for Pella.\n42:38 Comment: He won't get too many chances like that in the game.\n42:43 Comment: At a point where United were all at sea in that first 20, 25 minutes.\n42:49 Comment: So I think it's a recent excellent defensive record.\n42:52 Comment: Finally punctured.\n42:54 Comment: Another 300 minutes.\n42:57 Comment: And it's Tecklenburg.\n42:59 Comment: Beaten by Martial.\n43:2 Comment: And almost picking the ball out of his net a second time.\n43:6 Comment: A couple of minutes to go to half-time.\n43:8 Comment: Small...\n43:9 Comment: Through.\n43:12 Comment: And...\n43:14 Comment: Given that Fernandez had received a two- vikted record for being fine.\n43:16 Comment: Have you read that really?\n43:19 Comment: Oh yes!\n43:20 Comment: considers playing football at Southampton.\n43:31 Comment: Oh!\n43:37 Comment: The two- 12 –\n43:38 Comment: one,\n43:38 Comment: possibly keep getting the same joy yeah who knows they might have done I'm not\n43:43 Comment: quite sure why you would change that tactic it was working\n43:47 Comment: so blind they'll be happy the pillars switch sides and that money is now gone\n43:51

body is holding now\n44:34 Comment: he's not moved\n44:35 Comment: into this challenge with Marseille\n44:38 Comment: slipped on his ankle\n44:40 Comment: great week for the left backs\n44:44 Comment: target one of the successes here to Luke Shaw\n44:48 Comment: come through\n44:50 Comment: the same set up\n44:52 Comment: in the team as I mentioned earlier because Ryan Bertrand\n44:55 Comment: has had a hair surgery on both knees but is almost ready\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Cash in on a very good opening half an hour here.\n0:3 Comment: Kroos to goal for Pella.\n0:18 Comment: Here's Mané.\n0:20 Comment: Manchester of course had a long run at right back last season.\n0:24 Comment: But he's only been a substitute in the Premier League in this campaign.\n0:30 Comment: Here's Tadic.\n0:33 Comment: It was difficult to deal with a spinning ball, but...\n0:37 Comment: ...nearly managed it.\n0:39 Comment: Valencia brought into action straight away.\n0:41 Comment: He was warming up for about 15-20 minutes in that first half, Antonio Valencia.\n0:46 Comment: Manchester United, remember, started all eight games in...\n0:50 Comment: ...domestic and European context this season,\n0:53 Comment: with the same back four until this game.\n0:56 Comment: Obviously, Luke Shaw wasn't...\n0:58 Comment: ...going to be a contender to play, but now they've lost to Damian too.\n1:7 Comment: Van Dijk.\n1:12 Comment: Mané, he'd have to get away with that, but we are hearing that...\n1:15 Comment: ...Damian is not injured.\n1:17 Comment: It's a tactical switch by Louis van Gaal.\n1:20 Comment: Goal!\n1:27 Comment: Talking to the man he's already crowned as the...\n1:30 Comment: ...manager-in-waiting, Ryan Giggs.\n1:36 Comment: Who did have four games in

Comment: In the last 10 minutes of the first half, Southampton definitely just...\n1:54 Comment: ...sagged back a little bit.\n1:56 Comment: Whether it was the heat and a little bit of fatigue...\n1:58 Comment: ...kicking in, having put so much effort into the first half an hour.\n2:2 Comment: It was something, sure, United...\n2:4 Comment: ...really discussed at half-time.\n2:7

He started higher up the pitch.\n3:37 Comment: Romelu took it well.\n3:39 Comment: And then took one.\n3:40 Comment: And passed it to the other side.\n3:42 Comment: And then took one.\n3:44 Comment: And Plattenberg was...\n3:47 Comment: ...on the spot. To be fair, the touch took him into the...\n3:50 Comment: ...attempted challenge.\n3:51 Comment: And Rojo.\n3:54 Comment: Free kick eventually given.\n3:59 Comment: Machida.\n3:59 Comment: He's about...\n4:2 Comment: ...a psychological approach as much as...\n4:4 Comment: ...every other aspect of football...\n4:6 Comment: ...for Southampton.\n4:8 Comment: Belief that...\n4:10 Comment: ...big clubs can be beaten here.\n4:16 Comment: The pie.\n4:19 Comment: And the...\n4:21 Comment: ...sweet.\n4:24 Comment: And the...\n4:25 Comment: ...sweet.\n4:30 Comment: Oh, that's that kind of mistake.\n4:33 Comment: And then Martial...\n4:34 Comment: ...punishes it.\n4:35 Comment: Ruthlessly.\n4:37 Comment: And it is shades of what happened here last season.\n4:40 Comment: It was Robin van Persie then...\n4:43 Comment: ...who took advantage of a similar mishap and got a double.\n4:47 Comment: And it's Martial...\n4:48 Comment: ...who puts Manchester United 2-1 up with his second of the game.\n4:52 Comment: A catastrophe for Southampton.\n4:54 Comment: Absolutely. Such a weak back pass.\n4:57 Comment: Yashida playing it blind.\n5:0 Comment: And Martial, you're never in doubt.\n5:2 Comment: He's given us so much confidence in this last week that when he gets into this position...\n5:7 Comment: ...cold, unemotional.\n5:8 Comment: Keeper goes down early, just slots it past him.\n5:11 Comment: 1v1, looks where he's gonna put it.\n5:14 Comment: And just rolls it...\n5:16 Comment: ...into that far corner.\n5:17 Comment: And what a start to this Manchester United career.\n5:20 Comment: Yashida...\n5:21 Comment: ...well...\n5:23 Comment: ...you can't believe what he's done.\n5:26 Comment: And...\n5:27 Comment: ...probably he can't believe what he's done.\n5:29 Comment: Although it's...\n5:31 Comment: ...causing shockwaves around English football.\n5:34 Comment: A substantial start, to say the least.\n5:38 Comment: And Martial now, who's not yet played 90 minutes for Manchester United.\n5:42 Comment: And he's scored three goals.\n5:47 Comment: Here's Mané.\n5:49 Comment: Ward-Prouse.\n5:51 Comment: Good defending by...\n5:53 Comment: ...Chris Smalling.\n5:56 Comment: I have to say...\n5:57 Comment: ...Graham mentioned it at half-time in the studio.\n5:59 Comment: Martial's reaction to scoring a goal...\n6:2 Comment: ...is everything that you would want.\n6:3 Comment: He expects to score...\n6:5 Comment: ...so he doesn't get too excited.\n6:11 Comment: He's got those eyes that...\n6:12 Comment: ...make you think that...\n6:14 Comment: ...he expects to score three-four every single match.\n6:16 Comment: Almost at the same moment...\n6:18 Comment: ...Danny Ings was striking to Liverpool as a goal that would mean a great deal to him.\n6:22 Comment: They lead Norwich early in the second half.\n6:24 Comment: And Antwill...\n6:24 Comment: ...is a great defender.\n6:28 Comment: Well, he's struggling to see now.\n6:32 Comment: The news is good, Louis, you're leading.\n6:37 Comment: It was so similar to that goal last season, as you said.\n6:40 Comment: The Van Persie one.\n6:41 Comment: I think it was Jose Font then.\n6:47 Comment: And now...\n6:49 Comment: ...it's a goal.\n6:50 Comment: And it's a goal.\n6:57 Comment: And now...\n6:58 Comment: ...Yoshida, the guilty man this time.\n7:5 Comment: And yet again, in the clash between Koeman and Van Gaal, it's going the way of the away manager.\n7:20 Comment: Rooney.\n7:21 Comment: Well, in Rooney, Van Persie and Falcao, they had strikers who probably wanted to come towards the ball...\n7:26 Comment: ...in Martial, they've got someone who runs away, who lives on the last line of defenders.\n7:32 Comment: A different option.\n7:33 Comment: And a really nervous moment by Jose Font.\n7:38 Comment: The pie has a crack.\n7:40 Comment: And...\n7:41 Comment: ...Steinkenberg has that right-hand post.\n7:45 Comment: Cabot.\n7:49 Comment: Well...\n7:50 Comment: ...it's not always the wisest thing to do.\n7:52 Comment: He doesn't have a look where Martial is, but he doesn't make good contact with it.\n7:55 Comment: It's almost like a prod with the outside of his right foot, Yoshida.\n7:59 Comment: Martial.\n8:3 Comment: And we've seen Orokumen.\n8:4 Comment: What a picture.\n8:9 Comment: Full-coach of Southampton.\n8:14 Comment: Pella needs to start getting some service, putting himself about again from the Saints' point of view.\n8:19 Comment: And it's not the service into that left channel after about half an hour, which coincided with United getting on top.\n8:27 Comment: The first third was...\n8:30 Comment: ...Southampton's.\n8:30 Comment: The second third is conspicuously getting away at Manchester United.\n8:34 Comment: It's not completed yet.\n8:38 Comment: Chris Smalling trying to get his defenders out of that box.\n8:41 Comment: There's one thing for certain, Mo Prowse's delivery.\n8:44 Comment: It's hugely fantastic.\n8:46 Comment: Hugely fantastic.\n8:49 Comment: And here you are to the goal, you're in trouble.\n8:53 Comment: Under here.\n8:55 Comment: Make sure it's not fantastic this time.\n8:59 Comment: And they have that space to run into there.\n9:12 Comment: Carrick.\n9:13 Comment: Matta.\n9:17 Comment: Rooney quite happy to...\n9:20 Comment: ...to catch him and carry him.\n9:23 Comment: He hasn't scored today, that'll be the longest run of his entire Premier League career without a goal in 11 games.\n9:32 Comment: He's doing the right kind of records, that's probably one that...\n9:35 Comment: ...he would want to avoid.\n9:37 Comment: But if they win, knowing Wayne Rooney, he'll be happy enough.\n9:41 Comment: And they're leading at the moment.\n9:42 Comment: Slightly and probably after the way the game started.\n9:44 Comment: Ronald Koeman...\n9:47 Comment: ...might change the balance of his midfield here.\n9:51 Comment: He's had two holding players.\n9:55 Comment: And Romelu and Wan-Yama.\n9:57 Comment: Steven Davis would offer a little bit more...\n9:59 Comment: ...going forward.\n10:12 Comment: Maybe not.\n10:13 Comment: He's not happy by now.\n10:14 Comment: He's furious.\n10:15 Comment: Has out of the crowd.\n10:17 Comment: Feels

sloppily.\n11:10 Comment: And the goalkeeper...\n11:11 Comment: ...is not going to get there.\n11:13 Comment: Again...\n11:15 Comment: ...kind of a pinning back.\n11:16 Comment: Which...\n11:17 Comment: ...he'll get spotted very often.\n11:18 Comment: Rooney leading the break out.\n11:21 Comment: And it's good work considering he just come on from Davis.\n11:24 Comment: It was certainly a situation...\n11:26 Comment: ...if that pass had been under hit.\n11:27 Comment: And it was.\n11:29 Comment: And it's a good thing that...\n11:30 Comment: ...he's got a good defence.\n11:31 Comment:

Not sure if that pass had been under hit.\n11:39 Comment: He was in trouble.\n11:48 Comment: It's like a patting room this pitch.\n11:49 Comment: Under hitting it.\n11:50 Comment: It's really...\n11:51 Comment: ...sometimes early season pitchers have...\n11:53 Comment: ...longer grasp.\n11:54 Comment: But...\n11:55 Comment: ...I don't think Lashida could lean on that one.\n12:1 Comment: Here's Zatanić.\n12:8 Comment: Ward-Prouse.\n12:9 Comment: On the armour.\n12:20 Comment: Challenge.\n12:21 Comment: Waving his arms.\n12:23 Comment: Suggesting to Mane that he played for it.\n12:37 Comment: Southampton.\n12:38 Comment: The game plan has gone out of the window a little bit.\n12:39 Comment: From where they were in that first 30 minutes.\n12:42 Comment: Taking real risks now.\n12:44 Comment: Blamed.\n12:45 Comment: Hassled.\n12:47 Comment: And...\n12:48 Comment: ...whatever approach Southampton adopt.\n12:49 Comment: A bit of that.\n12:50 Comment: Won't come amiss.\n12:51 Comment: Hinting down...\n12:53 Comment: ...the ball that a defender seemed to have...\n12:54 Comment: ...under his control.\n13:1 Comment: Here's Wijnaldum.\n13:3 Comment: He's got the ball.\n13:13 Comment: Lashida.\n13:14 Comment: Had a chance to make amends maybe.\n13:25 Comment: Oh what a great save again.\n13:26 Comment: By David de Gea.\n13:27 Comment: What a save that is.\n13:31 Comment: It was prompted.\n13:32 Comment: Flicked it on.\n13:36 Comment: Great delivery from Paddy through the corner.\n13:47 Comment: Manchester United staying in the area, trying to push out a little bit.\n13:51 Comment: Martina.\n13:56 Comment: Simeone doesn't run that head up.\n13:59 Comment: Talk about the signing of Martial on deadline day,\n14:3 Comment: the signing of De Gea, the pace on this ball, the header,\n14:7 Comment: it's passed him, that is unbelievable.\n14:10 Comment: With his left hand, it doesn't do it justice to slow it down,\n14:14 Comment: that is an absolutely world-class save.\n14:19 Comment: Everything from the corner, from Southampton's point of view, was right.\n14:23 Comment: It's passed him, that's the unbelievable thing about it,\n14:26 Comment: as we can to grab that back and pull it back out of the net.\n14:31 Comment: Justin Schweinsteiger.\n14:34 Comment: That is coming on for Michael Carrick.\n14:42 Comment: David De Gea's status, I think shown by the Ballyhoo about the move to Real Madrid,\n14:49 Comment: or not, was the way it turned out.\n14:53 Comment: What a relief for Manchester United, moments like that just confirm\n14:57 Comment: the quality of the young goalkeeper from Spain.\n15:1 Comment: It's a brilliant, brilliant save.\n15:5 Comment: Once Font made connections, he must have thought it was 2-2.\n15:8 Comment: I thought it was in, it was done, it was passed him.\n15:14 Comment: Davis.\n15:15 Comment: Will Kraus.\n15:21 Comment: They've responded really well, Southampton to United scoring,\n15:24 Comment: it's a good game to watch.\n15:27 Comment: Manchester United scoring with remarkable efficiency,\n15:30 Comment: they scored their last five shots on target in the Barclays Premier League.\n15:36 Comment: Real go Liverpool 2-2 today.\n15:39 Comment: A difficult team to call, Manchester United, when you watch them,\n15:42 Comment: they don't always play brilliantly well, but they're tough to beat,\n15:45 Comment: and he's made them tough to beat, Louis van Gaal, in his last six to eight months.\n15:51 Comment: And Keller, found a bit of space, the pass didn't quite pick him out.\n16:3 Comment: Now he's definitely on the right, there's Natalic on the left,\n16:6 Comment: and Ward-Kraus in field with Davis.\n16:10 Comment: 4-1, 4-1.\n16:16 Comment: Schweinsteiger.\n16:21 Comment: There's a lot more loose now, Southampton, but it's making for a better game.\n16:26 Comment: In the first half, we're just dropping back,\n16:29 Comment: behind the ball in a real tight defensive shape, it's very different now,\n16:32 Comment: committing lots of bodies forward.\n16:36 Comment: It's amazing how similar it is to the game in December,\n16:39 Comment: with Pella scoring for Southampton, and the same player scoring two for Manchester United,\n16:44 Comment: getting a double, as Percy did, it's Martial today.\n16:48 Comment: Here's Rooney, that might not be the end of the scoring in this one, it is more open now.\n16:56 Comment: One thing that's amazing, is Declan Burr kicking the ball on top of Chris Smalling,\n16:59 Comment: I can't understand that tactic at all.\n17:3 Comment: Perenzi.\n17:6 Comment: Mata.\n17:8 Comment: Schneiderlin.\n17:12 Comment: Mata.\n17:14 Comment: More space for Manchester United to work their way into.\n17:18 Comment: Rojo.\n17:21 Comment: Mane knows he's got a job to do there.\n17:25 Comment: The shooter a bit short.\n17:37 Comment: Conte.\n17:40 Comment: Mata.\n17:42 Comment: Martial to the right this time.\n17:47 Comment: On a St Mary's hat-trick.\n17:51 Comment: The far side was waving his back foot up the pitch,\n17:53 Comment: but they're still going to keep up when they kick the ball forward.\n17:58 Comment: Mata, another United player, a little bit of space.\n18:2 Comment: Nice work between Mata and Martial.\n18:4 Comment: Rooney.\n18:8 Comment: Here's Tapie.\n18:14 Comment: This is a reshaped Shadhampton back four,\n18:16 Comment: Yoshida brought in it right back.\n18:19 Comment: Smiley off at half-time.\n18:21 Comment: Martina at left-back.\n18:25 Comment: Now they're all back to defend this corner.\n18:34 Comment: She's taken out.\n18:36 Comment: By everyone.\n18:40 Comment: Got an equaliser at Anfield for Norwich City.\n18:47 Comment: And it's that three-scoring central defender, Russell Martin.\n18:53 Comment: No goal for centre-back here, Jose Font.\n18:59 Comment: And it's a goal for the centre-back, Jose Font.\n19:5 Comment: It's a sort of save, I think it stays like this.\n19:9 Comment: Pushes you towards man of the match.\n19:11 Comment: Even though Martial scored two, there's a long way to go yet though.\n19:16 Comment: It's not going to reach.\n19:18 Comment: Tadic.\n19:22 Comment: That's a great pass by De Gea.\n19:24 Comment: Martial made it into that.\n19:27 Comment: Took it well, De Kuy.\n19:30 Comment: Davis.\n19:31 Comment: And Martina.\n19:35 Comment: Nearly a mirror image of what happened to Yoshida.\n19:38 Comment: I think De Kuy could have done better.\n19:40 Comment: For some reason he didn't quite read it as well as Martial had done on the Shidawan.\n19:45 Comment: Because you could see it coming from a couple of seconds before.\n19:51 Comment: Just got there, looking at there, he just doesn't really sprint for it, De Kuy.\n19:54 Comment: And turns his back at the end.\n19:56 Comment: And it's a goal for the centre-back, De Kuy.\n19:58 Comment: He's been alive on his toes.\n20:1 Comment: Fine start.\n20:4 Comment: Valencia.\n20:7 Comment: Martial kept it in.\n20:9 Comment: Lukasz got it back.\n20:15 Comment: He called his team-mates to get further up the pitch.\n20:22 Comment: Van Dijk.\n20:26 Comment: Yoshida, Font and Martina have got to push up the pitch more.\n20:30 Comment: They really are hanging back and leaving an enormous amount of space.\n20:36 Comment: The first half were more jittery.\n20:39 Comment: You can see there now, look at that space.\n20:41 Comment: They're so far back, that back four.\n20:48 Comment: Fine start.\n20:51 Comment: They're going to make it so difficult for the front six.\n20:55 Comment: They're going to kill their legs.\n20:58 Comment: Running.\n21:8 Comment: Now blipped.\n21:14 Comment: The Pan A seem to be working pretty well, all right.\n21:16 Comment: They did concede an equaliser, but that's going to happen in football, isn't it?\n21:19 Comment: Seems odd to rip it up.\n21:21 Comment: We're a long way away from Pan A now.\n21:23 Comment: I agree.\n21:24 Comment: The game plan has changed completely from 30 minutes.\n21:26 Comment: I'm not quite understanding why.\n21:28 Comment: I'm sure Ronan Klumen hasn't got the message for them to change.\n21:32 Comment: It's something that's happened out on the pitch.\n21:34 Comment: And they've stopped using that left channel to Pella.\n21:36 Comment: He's now playing on Smalling.\n21:38 Comment: I've no idea why he's doing that.\n21:40 Comment: He's having so much joy down that side.\n21:42 Comment: And the game was simple.\n21:44 Comment: Play the ball forward down that side and get behind the ball and shut the spaces off.\n21:48 Comment: And he's stopped doing it.\n21:49 Comment: It's almost as if they've been playing the reputation and not the match.\n21:53 Comment: After a very good half an hour.\n21:58 Comment: They've certainly gone a bit meek and mild against Manchester United.\n22:1 Comment: And carried the fight to them.\n22:6 Comment: Rooney.\n22:15 Comment: De Puy.\n22:17 Comment: Here's Juan Mata.\n22:19 Comment: And Ancelotti starting to make a move down beneath us.\n22:26 Comment: De Puy and Martial in the middle.\n22:30 Comment: Mata.\n22:37 Comment: And the Southampton Rovers standing off a long-distance tiger to come in.\n22:41 Comment: De Puy turns.\n22:42 Comment: De Puy wraps the post, then Mata wraps the back of the net.\n22:45 Comment: It's 3-1 Manchester United, they're ruthless again.\n22:54 Comment: And Southampton have let this somewhat slip through their fingers.\n22:58 Comment: Well, it's fantastic for Manchester United, but Southampton are like a boxer\n23:2 Comment: that have lowered their gloves, waiting to get hit.\n23:5 Comment: It's really good skill from De Puy, I have to say.\n23:8 Comment: And there's a rebound in the first half at that end to Pella.\n23:11 Comment: This time it falls fortunately to Mata.\n23:14 Comment: He has got a little bit more to do, but he's got good control in the strike.\n23:19 Comment: It's good play from United.\n23:21 Comment: Southampton haven't laid a glove on them in that attack.\n23:25 Comment: And in the end it looks so easy.\n23:30 Comment: He scored at Swansea, but that wasn't enough for Manchester United\n23:33 Comment: down in South Wales.\n23:35 Comment: That should be enough for Manchester United down on the south coast.\n23:40 Comment: And Paddy McNair has come on.\n23:44 Comment: Having had a very difficult game here last season.\n23:47 Comment: He was taken off, he started the match, he was taken off before half-time.\n23:56 Comment: McNair has gone to centre-back.\n23:58 Comment: Blin has been out to left-back.\n24:0 Comment: A little change in that back four.\n24:4 Comment: Only Chris Small has stayed in the position that he started the game.\n24:10 Comment: Fogged.\n24:12 Comment: We were just talking about Southampton's game plan.\n24:14 Comment: Now it had changed unnecessarily.\n24:20 Comment: The pioneer he was offside.\n24:22 Comment: Mata knows that he can get there, or tries to get there.\n24:29 Comment: And for half an hour United really were playing a very good game.\n24:32 Comment: They were playing a very good game.\n24:37 Comment: And for half an hour United really were poor in the game.\n24:40 Comment: But they've been good in this last 40 minutes.\n24:43 Comment: Very good from the moment they scored, they've dominated this match.\n24:48 Comment: They're heading to second in the box, this Premier League.\n24:56 Comment: Pella.\n25:2 Comment: Martinez.\n25:7 Comment: Kadic.\n25:12 Comment: Pella.\n25:13 Comment: Now he's in there.\n25:15 Comment: Comes out to Rooney.\n25:17 Comment: And Manchester United have got five breaking forward here.\n25:21 Comment: Rooney making it six.\n25:24 Comment: And I think this is now where Mata, Schweinsteiger and the likes really come into their own\n25:30 Comment: in terms of keeping the ball and controlling the game.\n25:33 Comment: Schweinsteiger in particular.\n25:36 Comment: Even Rooney coming back deeper now.\n25:39 Comment: He'll find it more difficult, Southampton, to get hold of that ball.\n25:43 Comment: We've seen, or suggested, that Southampton invited pressure late in the first half.\n25:47 Comment: Was Manchester United to do the same late in the second half?\n25:51 Comment: It's not like they have nothing to do but throw their bodies at it.\n25:57 Comment: That's it.\n26:2 Comment: It would be a little bit easier if Manchester United lose any sense of adventure.\n26:6 Comment: The crowd you pointed out, Gary, were shouting attack, attack when they were one-nil down.\n26:10 Comment: Well, they've had a few attacks now, haven't they?\n26:13 Comment: Pictures change totally.\n26:18 Comment: Here's Van Dijk.\n26:24 Comment: Well spotted by Schneiderle.\n26:28 Comment: Van Dijk stepping in but losing out to Martial.\n26:32 Comment: It could take a bit of catching here if he gets into his stride.\n26:35 Comment: He didn't quite do that.\n26:37 Comment: Because his legs were taken from him.\n26:39 Comment: One thing people talked about is his pace but he's a strong boy as well.\n26:50 Comment: Martina.\n26:53 Comment: Tadic.\n26:55 Comment: Mane trying to set up Davis who's on the edge of the area.\n26:59 Comment: Here's Wood-Prouse.\n27:5 Comment: Koeman responding to the circumstances.\n27:8 Comment: And here's Shane Long ready to come on.\n27:16 Comment: Here's Mata.\n27:17 Comment: Van Dijk trying to pin Martial against the touchline.\n27:20 Comment: He only had to do that and Martial can put Rooney in here.\n27:27 Comment: Van Dijk is going to get a yellow card.\n27:31 Comment: There was a bit of defensive cover around.\n27:34 Comment: You can't blame Van Dijk.\n27:35 Comment: He'd been done one-twoed out of the game and he's in big, big trouble\n27:39 Comment: if he allows Martial to run ahead with that ball.\n27:43 Comment: I think it's Wayne Rooney who's up with him on the foul.\n27:45 Comment: Martial will just be able to slip it through to him.\n27:48 Comment: He brings him down.\n27:50 Comment: Takes the yellow card.\n28:5 Comment: 3-1 at home to Liverpool, 3-1 away to Southampton.\n28:8 Comment: 3-1 away to Southampton.\n28:31 Comment: Schmeinsteiger to Valencia.\n28:39 Comment: Schneiderlin.\n28:47 Comment: Shane Long still waiting for the ball to go out.\n28:55 Comment: A little bit unlucky not to get more game time to Southampton Long.\n29:0 Comment: Look at the way Ronald Koeman plays.\n29:4 Comment: Long, who would like to be a central striker.\n29:8 Comment: Can't really supplant Keller.\n29:12 Comment: He doesn't look playing wide.\n29:13 Comment: He does.\n29:14 Comment: Shane Long.\n29:16 Comment: It does suit him sometimes coming in on crosses from the opposite flank.\n29:21 Comment: Here's Mané.\n29:23 Comment: And Mark Clattenburg keeps his arms down by his side.\n29:28 Comment: He does daily live the pace on the one-two.\n29:31 Comment: Can't stay with him.\n29:32 Comment: And Chris Smalling drives across.\n29:35 Comment: Can't quite see from that angle.\n29:39 Comment: Certainly a trombone fall for Mané.\n29:43 Comment: Can't quite see whether Chris Smalling catches him.\n29:47 Comment: It hasn't been a huge chase after the referee has it?\n29:51 Comment: A burning sense of injustice.\n30:0 Comment: Rooney.\n30:4 Comment: It just looks to me like Mané maybe was running a little bit too fast.\n30:7 Comment: It's his own speed.\n30:12 Comment: It doesn't look like he's complaining too much.\n30:17 Comment: No.\n30:18 Comment: He's died. He has a little bit of a whack with his leg this morning.\n30:20 Comment: But the contact isn't there.\n30:23 Comment: Mané just throws himself to the ground.\n30:28 Comment: Off goes James Ward-Browse.\n30:29 Comment: Started the game so well.\n30:31 Comment: Shane Long trying to give it some gloss from Southampton's point of view.\n30:35 Comment: At the finish.\n30:37 Comment: 15 minutes left.\n30:50 Comment: They've gone 4-2-4 now.\n30:52 Comment: Southampton.\n30:54 Comment: Long and Pellar up top.\n30:55 Comment: Tadic left.\n30:56 Comment: Mané right.\n30:57 Comment: And Mane, Arma and Davies in central midfield.\n31:7 Comment: Rooney.\n31:23 Comment: A nice dagger with 500 games behind him for Bayern Munich.\n31:27 Comment: Well over 100 for Germany.\n31:30 Comment: He's well equipped to control matters in these circumstances.\n31:37 Comment: And his ideal player to have out on the pitch from a possession point of view.\n31:44 Comment: Tadic.\n31:50 Comment: Mancia sticking tight to him.\n31:54 Comment: After one cup coming up in the week.\n31:56 Comment: A couple of terrific fixtures for you.\n31:59 Comment: Live on Sky Sports 1.\n32:0 Comment: Aston Villa against Birmingham.\n32:2 Comment: The rivalry that entails.\n32:4 Comment: Tottenham against Arsenal on Wednesday.\n32:9 Comment: Martial.\n32:14 Comment: It's a poor challenge from Fonte.\n32:16 Comment: He's got the booking for it.\n32:18 Comment: I just wonder whether Depay would have wanted to be allowed to go on then.\n32:21 Comment: He thought about playing the advantage but it was a late challenge from Fonte.\n32:26 Comment: Skips past him.\n32:33 Comment: I think Depay was just lining this one up.\n32:37 Comment: He might line up the free kick of course.\n32:39 Comment: Which could be from a more advantageous position.\n32:42 Comment: There's been a few changes.\n32:44 Comment: It's Anand De Mulle who's set up a wall.\n32:51 Comment: A few words being exchanged there involving Martial.\n32:53 Comment: I think he's trying to wind him up a bit.\n32:56 Comment: Test out his temperament.\n32:57 Comment: Pelé.\n32:59 Comment: Martial maybe feels a little bit more in that tackle.\n33:2 Comment: Just a genuine attempt to play the ball.\n33:7 Comment: Depay.\n33:8 Comment: Still looking for a Premier League goal.\n33:10 Comment: And close.\n33:13 Comment: Really close.\n33:28 Comment: Long.\n33:30 Comment: Smalling there.\n33:33 Comment: Got out of a jam then.\n33:36 Comment: Fonte still realising if they could get one.\n33:39 Comment: Maybe Manchester United aren't so rock solid that\n33:44 Comment: some pressure could be applied.\n33:47 Comment: Got to get the ball to get the one.\n33:49 Comment: It's going to be a problem.\n33:50 Comment: They've not been able to lay a finger on United in this last 5-10 minutes really.\n33:53 Comment: Rumi.\n33:54 Comment: Offside.\n33:55 Comment: Against Manchester Pi.\n33:57 Comment: They have to get the ball.\n33:59 Comment: Which means the back four have to push up the pitch.\n34:1 Comment: And that's been difficult for them.\n34:6 Comment: Mane.\n34:10 Comment: Davis.\n34:24 Comment: Pelé.\n34:37 Comment: It's the 33rd Premier League meeting between these two clubs.\n34:41 Comment: And Manchester United closing in on the 23rd victory.\n34:49 Comment: It's important to know.\n34:51 Comment: They've not suffered.\n34:53 Comment: More against any other club.\n35:1 Comment: Ten minutes left.\n35:3 Comment: You're going to have problems reviewing the matter goal.\n35:7 Comment: There's so many passes from Manchester United in the build-up to it.\n35:10 Comment: Just to emphasise the point you're making.\n35:13 Comment: Gary, that's a sad thing.\n35:14 Comment: You can't lay a glove on them.\n35:16 Comment: It's a very difficult game.\n35:20 Comment: And it's a very difficult game.\n35:33 Comment: Here's Rooney again.\n35:35 Comment: We were talking about Southampton's change of approach in the game.\n35:38 Comment: In the lead-up to that goal when Manchester United were making all those passes.\n35:43 Comment: And from there on in they've not really been able to alter the course of the game.\n35:52 Comment: Easier set of circumstances for Paddy McNair, now a Northern Ireland international.\n35:59 Comment: The Niels squad that are striving so hard to get into the European finals next summer in France.\n36:9 Comment: Valencia, Mata.\n36:12 Comment: It's not far, another Northern Ireland international, Stephen Davis.\n36:15 Comment: A great captain.\n36:17 Comment: They didn't get it for long, Southampton, Rooney.\n36:21 Comment: It's fantastic work back by Antonio Valencia.\n36:29 Comment: You can see now, it's been pass after pass.\n36:34 Comment: After half an hour or so you could not see the match ending with this kind of domination from the team that were struggling so much in the first third of the game.\n36:44 Comment: I'm glad to be able to speak to Southampton's players, to ask them why, what's happened, what changed, were they a little bit tired after half an hour?\n36:52 Comment: Did they put so much effort into that first half an hour, the game, the heat?\n36:57 Comment: Obviously Manchester United starting to pass the ball and get the goal just altered their mentality.\n37:2 Comment: Well the lack of the offside flag of course was a big moment wasn't it?\n37:8 Comment: According to the Manchester United equaliser.\n37:11 Comment: And the Cahiers say it was huge as well, it was a big moment.\n37:15 Comment: I don't know what Louis van Gaal will say, the game is going on.\n37:18 Comment: Martial is on a hat trick, a very humanitarian approach from him.\n37:23 Comment: If he's really clever what he'll do is he'll pretend to stay offside by doing that and then run off your own goal.\n37:27 Comment: Yes.\n37:29 Comment: I don't think he's thinking that way, he's a genuinely nice sporting act.\n37:34 Comment: And the way things are these days he'll probably get an award for it.\n37:41 Comment: It may not come from his manager.\n37:48 Comment: Obviously too many centre-backs get cramped.\n37:54 Comment: But it is his first home game and his second game at this level for Louis van Gaal.\n37:59 Comment: When you talk about tiredness, we just mentioned fatigue and there is obviously a sure sign of it there.\n38:5 Comment: And they certainly haven't got the pitch in this second half, that back four of Southampton.\n38:8 Comment: They've been struggling.\n38:10 Comment: The midfield I think have been putting a real shift in.\n38:12 Comment: They've been let down I have to say.\n38:14 Comment: And I will use that term by the back four not getting up behind them in this second half.\n38:18 Comment: Was it tactical, was it psychological?\n38:20 Comment: We'll try and get some reaction at the end of the game.\n38:24 Comment: Ronald Koeman looks like a man who feels his side are beaten.\n38:35 Comment: He couldn't have been any more positive in terms of his substitutions.\n38:38 Comment: He's been in his last ten minutes.\n38:40 Comment: Long's good in the air, Pella's good in the air.\n38:42 Comment: Tadic and Mane, why?\n38:44 Comment: But they've not been able to get the ball to them at all.\n38:49 Comment: It looked a case of more attacking options on the pitch.\n38:52 Comment: But not enough players who were going to get the ball to those attacking options.\n38:57 Comment: One thing that Manchester United's stats have shown this season, their passing is a strong suit.\n39:4 Comment: And indeed their industry going into the weekend, the side that have covered the most ground.\n39:14 Comment: Six minutes past added time away from wrapping this up.\n39:19 Comment: Mane.\n39:23 Comment: Always easy to give the decisions outside the penalty area.\n39:27 Comment: The replays did show that that potential

    "summary": "The Southampton vs. Manchester United match at St. Mary's Stadium was a gripping encounter that kept spectators on edge until the final whistle. The game ended 3-2 in favor of Manchester United, with both teams delivering a performance packed with tactical maneuvers, key individual brilliance, and intense physical battles.\n\nFrom the outset, Michael Carrick transitioned into a back three for Manchester United which seemed to be a bold move. Carrick, alongside Chris Smalling and Daley Blind, provided a stable defensive setup, allowing the midfield to maintain a controlled presence. Early possession statistics favored Manchester United, but Southampton responded with high pressing tactics, particularly when David de Gea had the ball. Southampton's manager displayed his tactical savvy, seeking to disrupt United’s rhythm and gain control of the match.\n\nThroughout the first half, key players emerged on both sides. Robin van Persie exhibited his trademark Dutch flair, while Wayne Rooney floated in the space between midfield and attack, often finding himself up against Southampton's Romain. Mane, playing for Southampton, pressed high and tested United’s defense, although the transfer window had hinted at a potential move for him to Manchester United which never materialized. Other notable battles included Victor Wanyama, who also had links to potential transfers but stayed put, and new signing Virgil van Dijk, establishing his presence in Southampton's defense despite some early wobbles.\n\nSouthampton broke the deadlock in the 13th minute. It started with Mane getting into a dangerous position, delivering a shot that forced a spectacular save from de Gea. However, Graziano Pelle was quick to rebound and slotted the ball into the net, capitalizing on the loose ball and giving Southampton an early lead. It was fine football that rewarded their early aggressive play. United’s defenders were visibly struggling to keep tabs on Mane’s movements, which continually disrupted their organization.\n\nDespite the early setback, United regrouped and began to exert more pressure around the 20-minute mark. Memphis Depay and Anthony Martial started to show increased involvement. Martials' young but impressive abilities were noticeable; his speed and unpredictability kept the Southampton defense on alert. By the 35th minute, their efforts bore fruit when Martial, with exquisite composure, took advantage of a defensive mistake and squared the ball into the net, pulling United level. His swift turn and clinical finish past van Dijk marked the beginning of his notable contribution to the match.\n\nThe tactical chess continued with Southampton sticking to their strengths. They made use of the right and left channels effectively, Tadic and Ward-Prowse in particular, sending crosses and maintaining width. Ward-Prowse's delivery from set-pieces was precise, although United’s defense, led by Smalling, managed to get clearances.\n\nEarly in the second half, United’s manager made tactical substitutions, bringing on Antonio Valencia. Within moments, Manchester United unveiled a more aggressive stance, resulting in another goal for Martial, who pounced on an errant back pass from Southampton’s Yoshida. The goal, reminiscent of Robin van Persie’s opportunism from previous seasons, saw Martial capitalize with ice-cold precision, slotting home to give United a 2-1 lead.\n\nSouthampton, refusing to be subdued, responded. Pelle and Mane continued to press and probe, with several set-pieces causing moments of panic in United’s defense. David de Gea was called upon once more, making a phenomenal save from a Pelle header, diverting the ball that appeared destined for the top corner with his left hand. This save underlined de Gea’s value to Manchester United, especially given the transfer sagas surrounding his future.\n\nThe match’s intensity did not waver; it only escalated. Manchester United's composure under pressure was evident with Carrick, Schneiderlin, and later Schweinsteiger controlling play. The latter replaced Carrick, injecting fresh legs and experienced calm into the midfield. His control in possession and strategic positioning helped United sustain their lead while creating transitions from defense to attack smoothly.\n\nIn the 68th minute, Manchester United struck again. Depay’s intricate footwork and subsequent strike hit the post, but Juan Mata was perfectly positioned to follow up and score, making it 3-1. This goal showcased United's ability to maximize on scrappy plays, their readiness to exploit defensive lapses, and revealed Mata’s sharpness in capitalizing on rebound opportunities.\n\nDespite a two-goal deficit, Southampton surged forward with renewed vigor. Shane Long's introduction aimed to inject pace and energy. Southampton’s efforts eventually paid off; Daley Blind's defensive lapse allowed Tadic the space to send a cross into the box, which Pelle headed spectacularly past de Gea in the 85th minute, bringing Southampton back within reach at 3-2.\n\nAs the game wore on, tactical discipline from United’s defense and vital saves from de Gea preserved their lead. Smalling marshaled the defense, ensuring to shut out any final attempts by Southampton. There were, however, nervy moments as Southampton loaded the box with bodies, pushing for an equalizer.\n\nIn the dying minutes, United strategically held possession, using experienced players like Schweinsteiger and Mata to retain the ball and frustrate Southampton’s attempts. Martial’s contributions throughout the match didn’t go unnoticed; his ability on the ball and positioning offered United continuous counter-attacking threats.\n\nIn the end, the final whistle confirmed Manchester United’s 3-2 victory, a hard-earned win attributed to crucial saves, tactical adjustments, and clinical finishing. Martial’s stellar performance marked him as an emerging star, netting twice and maintaining composure under pressure, while de Gea’s crucial interventions reflected his standing as one of the world's top goalkeepers. For Southampton, it was a case of promising play undone by key mistakes and superb individual capabilities from their opposition.\n\nThis match not only provided high drama and entertainment but also illustrated the tactical depth and individual brilliance that defines Premier League football at its best."
