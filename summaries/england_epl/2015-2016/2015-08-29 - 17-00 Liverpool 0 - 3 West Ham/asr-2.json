    "input": "\n    Liverpool 0 - 3 West\n\nFirst Half:\n\n0:0 Comment: football teams keen to enter that on a winning note. West Ham chasing a first league win\n0:3 Comment: at Anfield since 1963. Jeffers, Martin Peters the goal scorer that day. Liverpool seeking\n0:11 Comment: to make it back to back. Anfield wins after that win against Bournemouth. Brendan Rogers\n0:16 Comment: Gary this week saying the hunger is back at Liverpool. He said yeah exactly that, that\n0:21 Comment: the new players have brought a new drive to the team and it was so important that Liverpool\n0:24 Comment: started the season well. We said about the drubbing they received the last day of the\n0:28 Comment: season against Stoke, coupled with the defeat at Arsenal 4-1 last year and suddenly within\n0:33 Comment: the first four games of the season they've amended those two results already with a really\n0:37 Comment: strong start to the season. Dejan Lovren who's redeeming his reputation this season so far.\n0:44 Comment: Here is Clyne and now Lucas. Step over from Benteke Coutinho and tries to find a return\n0:52 Comment: ball. It's away by Reid. Lovren up early against Saka and it is Kouyate. They'll certainly\n1:0 Comment: look to Chaku Kouyate today. The energy from midfield and some goals added in as well last\n1:5 Comment: season and those have continued into this. Lucas for Clyne again. Dimitri Payet the closest\n1:19 Comment: West Ham man to hit. Here's Skrtomil. Part of a defence that yet to concede in the Premier\n1:24 Comment: League this season. Now Emre Can looking to take on Ogonap in that far side. Gets his\n1:29 Comment: cross in as well and Tomkins. Good shot there from Darren Randolph. Good start by Tomkins.\n1:36 Comment: He'll be slightly unfamiliar. I know he's played at right back on a few occasions for\n1:39 Comment: West Ham but as a centre back out wide against these tricky customers at Liverpool out there\n1:43 Comment: he could be in for a tough afternoon. It's important he gets a good start. Lovren underneath\n1:51 Comment: this again. Coutinho claiming it. Will be given Kouyate in West Ham's way. Very much\n2:5 Comment: the playmaker in this side these days. Slaban Bilic, ex-Everton of course. Something that\n2:12 Comment: won't have gone unnoticed today amongst the Liverpool fans. Mike gets turned. Player with\n2:20 Comment: loads of ability. Headed away by Skrto. He's going to come to Cresswell. Chokes his effort\n2:25 Comment: on goal but it's in. What a start for West Ham. Incredible start. We've talked about\n2:31 Comment: how hard it's been to even create chances against this new Liverpool team but straight\n2:35 Comment: away first attack, gets switched to the back post. A cross comes in and West Ham 1-0 up\n2:42 Comment: already. First Premier League start for Manuel Lanzini and he scores at the Kop end at Anfield.\n2:47 Comment: We've talked about a positive start for Liverpool but obviously West Ham desperately need something\n2:55 Comment: to go their way at the moment. The cross comes in and Nathaniel Clyne's defending very narrow\n3:0 Comment: brilliantly. Gets out to block it but unfortunately Gomez has just not cleared it. He had an opportunity\n3:6 Comment: but it seems to have gone through his legs.\n3:11 Comment: But Cresswell thrashed it in. It was always going off target.\n3:16 Comment: Credit Lanzini. He sensed there might be something on here. Gets there ahead of Gomez and beats\n3:22 Comment: Minula. Liverpool 0-1 West Ham. Lachau coming inside the opening three minutes.\n3:29 Comment: This will be an interesting test of Liverpool now because everything so far this season has gone the way they would like it. It will be a test of character now. Obviously we'll hear the crowd up. I'm sure they'll get behind the team which is important.\n3:42 Comment: We were talking before kick-off yourself and myself Gary saying this is a big game for Liverpool now after such a positive start.\n3:49 Comment: At home against West Ham, Sarn seem to be struggling.\n3:53 Comment: Absolutely. Going into that international break if they were to get a home win here they couldn't ask for much more from the first part of the season. It gives an opportunity just to regroup there and obviously players will go off to the international teams but they can do more work on the training ground with the younger players.\n4:7 Comment: And of course Sada can become a five man midfield now in front of the back four and Sakho up there on his own.\n4:15 Comment: A lead goal to protect. Early stages though.\n4:21 Comment: Lovren and Lucas inside to Chen.\n4:24 Comment: Milner will play a massive role here today. He's an experienced player, he's been in these situations many a times and you can see straight away he's getting Liverpool playing, getting them back into the groove.\n4:33 Comment: The last West Ham player prior to Manuel Lanzini to score a lead goal at Anfield, Bobby Zamora, August of 2006, nine years ago.\n4:41 Comment: It was a Martin Skrgel own goal that counted in West Ham's favour in the interim.\n4:47 Comment: It's been a long time for what you'd see as long suffering West Ham supporters when they come to this ground.\n4:54 Comment: You wonder what they were expecting coming here.\n4:57 Comment: And they've got off to an unbelievable start.\n5:0 Comment: They'll be delighted with that. You can hear him in full voice now as we're watching Coutinho get on the ball. It's going to be important now that he starts to get Liverpool to play.\n5:9 Comment: Back to the right hand side. Here is Clyne forward.\n5:13 Comment: Shadowed by Cresswell. Chen looking to turn.\n5:18 Comment: And a big day for Angelo Agbonne as well.\n5:21 Comment: A big day for Angelo Agbonne as well.\n5:24 Comment: Terrific debut for the ex-Juve man at Arsenal but then how often do you see a defender taken off in the first half as he was against Bournemouth when that's knocked down to an injury.\n5:33 Comment: It was incredible and he really got the run around from Callum Wilson who doesn't give you a moment's peace or close down at every opportunity.\n5:40 Comment: And that was a learning curve certainly for him and what it's like in the Premier League.\n5:43 Comment: Â£11 million here for Agbonne which having seen him at Juventus failed to force his way into that back three or back four.\n5:52 Comment: Antonio Conte or Max Allegri.\n5:55 Comment: A lot of money for West Ham to pay for him.\n5:58 Comment: It's always interesting when you see these players coming from the foreign leagues in terms of when the bigger clubs play the smaller clubs.\n6:6 Comment: And how often they get an easy game or whatever but you certainly don't get any easy games in the Premier League.\n6:14 Comment: Lucas doing what he's there to do. Dispossessing Saka.\n6:20 Comment: Skirtle net.\n6:24 Comment: Looks to have it at his near side. Tompkins very comfortable underneath it.\n6:29 Comment: And the goal scorer Lanzini trying to fashion it into midfield. Here's Koutsinia.\n6:33 Comment: Wides the first tackle and then looking to take it on.\n6:37 Comment: We've seen him score some spectacular goals including at Stoke on the opening day of this season.\n6:42 Comment: He won't get too down-hearted there. He knows he has the ability once he cuts in on to that right foot there to hit the top corners.\n6:48 Comment: Unfortunately here just didn't connect how he would have liked.\n6:52 Comment: It's interesting Gary with the arrival of Benteke.\n6:55 Comment: Not many thinking that Benteke can get crosses in and score goals.\n6:59 Comment: But Liverpool essentially in support of Benteke playing with two number 10s Coutinho and Firmino.\n7:4 Comment: Yeah I think that's key. People think that Liverpool with Benteke are going to get it wide across.\n7:7 Comment: I don't think that will be their plan. I think more often than not it will be a ball up to Benteke and he'll use his physical strength to bring those type of guys into play then.\n7:19 Comment: Minulek.\n7:23 Comment: Looks to go long. And it is Benteke the target.\n7:28 Comment: The advantage of Tompkins there is that you've essentially got two centre-backs marking him and Benteke goes that side.\n7:33 Comment: Exactly. I'm surprised to see him going Tompkins. You expect him to go and hang out on Cresswell and run us off of his flick-ons or bring it down his chest there.\n7:43 Comment: A character word Brendan Rodgers likes to use on a regular basis. They certainly have to show plenty of that when the fixture computer threw up Stoke away as they're opening the campaign.\n7:52 Comment: But they got their win there.\n7:55 Comment: Look at these away fixtures they've got to come.\n7:58 Comment: Really, really difficult. Old Trafford, Goodison, Wideout Lane, Stamford Bridge and the Etihad will be their next run of away games.\n8:5 Comment: There is Firmino. Takes it on. Great strike off the woodwork. Darren Randolph plunging to his right-hand side.\n8:13 Comment: Fantastic strike. Initially I thought he was going to roll in Klein who had done a great overlap from right back but he created the space, chopped back onto his left-hand side there and what a strike that is.\n8:23 Comment: Well Coutinho in particular had his issues with the woodwork at the Emirates.\n8:29 Comment: And Darren Randolph grateful that that post was right there when he needed it.\n8:39 Comment: Skirgle.\n8:42 Comment: And then West Ham dropping off denying the space for the likes of Coutinho in there.\n8:53 Comment: Milner.\n8:58 Comment: Lucas looking for an option.\n9:2 Comment: Champ.\n9:4 Comment: Held up by Noble.\n9:7 Comment: Patience might be the key for Liverpool today looking at West Ham have set up here.\n9:12 Comment: And Coutinho.\n9:16 Comment: Lucas.\n9:19 Comment: Lifts one in for Benteke whose goal side here is gone down under the challenge of Winston Reid.\n9:24 Comment: No whistle, no flag.\n9:27 Comment: Noble looking for a route out here.\n9:35 Comment: Janin Villa with his first goal for Sunderland as they lead at Aston Villa. Some early goals around today but Benteke thought he was in there.\n9:43 Comment: He did and it would be interesting to see whether or not the contact was blatantly a penalty or not.\n9:48 Comment: But you see Liverpool working, he couldn't do it and he put the ball in but I think Winston Reid has just been strong there.\n9:53 Comment: Powerful centre back and just made sure he slightly took Benteke under the ball.\n9:59 Comment: And he did enough but not too much there Winston Reid to draw the attention of Kevin Friend who is no friend of Benteke he'll feel.\n10:6 Comment: West Ham have got to be so careful just on the last phase of play for them.\n10:9 Comment: They won the ball back but they don't complete that pass.\n10:11 Comment: They need to do that up to their forwards just to give the rest of the defence and midfield an opportunity to squeeze up a little bit of respite.\n10:17 Comment: Because at the moment it just literally seems like attack versus defence.\n10:22 Comment: And Chen got that left foot across between Mann and Boer.\n10:26 Comment: Made sure the first contact was with him.\n10:35 Comment: Liverpool work at left hand side, Gomez.\n10:42 Comment: Maybe that's another plus for James Tompkins today.\n10:44 Comment: Gomez is so right footed, doesn't often go on the outside as we would see Clyne do on the other side.\n10:50 Comment: Yeah and you wouldn't expect his top deliveries that you expect from Nathaniel Clyne.\n10:54 Comment: Certainly one of the best right backs in the league at the moment, no doubt about that.\n10:57 Comment: A guy who loves defending, first and foremost that's the main job.\n11:1 Comment: But offers a great outlet offensively with his overlaps.\n11:5 Comment: The ball with Darren Randolph who made his debut for Charlton here, just turned 20, May of 2007.\n11:13 Comment: Back at Anfield today, his dad is a big Liverpool fan, we understand he's watching in Dublin today.\n11:18 Comment: So we welcome you along Mr Randolph.\n11:21 Comment: Good start for your son on his side so far.\n11:25 Comment: There's Kouyate, who's on there for Saka.\n11:28 Comment: We've found a gap between Liverpool defenders.\n11:37 Comment: Skirtle getting dragged out into that full back position, just clear your lines.\n11:40 Comment: Give yourself an opportunity to get caught in it now, out of position.\n11:43 Comment: It's unlike how Liverpool have been defending since the start of the season.\n11:49 Comment: Leon from Lanzini, Tompkins, where is Payet?\n11:51 Comment: There is Payet.\n11:55 Comment: Milner with the tackle, assistant referee five or six yards away.\n11:59 Comment: Good position this now for West Ham.\n12:8 Comment: Surprising Milner there to give a free kick, there's three on two,\n12:11 Comment: there's nowhere for him to go and yet he's given away a cheap one.\n12:13 Comment: This allows the opportunity for the two centre-backs and Tompkins to come up now and attack Liverpool.\n12:18 Comment: We see straight away marking areas.\n12:22 Comment: Big lads for West Ham can get a run and jump now.\n12:24 Comment: If the ball's right, this could be a real danger.\n12:26 Comment: Bonneri, Kouyate all in there.\n12:30 Comment: That's a good delivery and it's Payet looking to provide it.\n12:33 Comment: It skims off the head of Lucas.\n12:35 Comment: Tompkins sets it there for Noble to take on and beat Benteke.\n12:40 Comment: Corner conceded by Milner.\n12:43 Comment: That was a good delivery and he's been known for it Payet,\n12:45 Comment: his stats for his former club are fantastic,\n12:48 Comment: whether it's scoring goals himself or mainly assists\n12:50 Comment: and you can see the quality he has on those wide free kicks.\n12:53 Comment: 17 league-end assists for Marseille last season,\n12:56 Comment: won in his Premier League debut for Kouyate at the Emirates.\n13:2 Comment: It really was a tempter and Liverpool had trouble dealing with it.\n13:7 Comment: Short corner take, there is Cresswell.\n13:10 Comment: Good angle for the left footed cross.\n13:13 Comment: Winston Reid just couldn't climb high enough.\n13:16 Comment: That was really well. Cresswell came up late.\n13:18 Comment: Winston Reid and Tompkins then pilled to the back post.\n13:20 Comment: If he floats out, a bit of quality on his balls,\n13:23 Comment: which he's more than capable of.\n13:25 Comment: Good defending in the end.\n13:27 Comment: Liverpool look slightly vulnerable here.\n13:31 Comment: Payet across the take again.\n13:32 Comment: A chance on Ogbonna.\n13:42 Comment: A bit of a word first for Diafra Sakho.\n13:53 Comment: That's Riyokan Payet, very crisp delivery.\n13:57 Comment: That's good defensive work from Bentayga.\n13:59 Comment: He's a real presence in there.\n14:0 Comment: You give him that free roll in that six-yard box\n14:2 Comment: and just say, go and attack anything that comes in.\n14:6 Comment: If they're going to take them corners,\n14:7 Comment: they've got to try and take him out of the equation if they can.\n14:15 Comment: It's a home win apiece for these sides in the Premier League\n14:17 Comment: last season, early in the campaign.\n14:18 Comment: 3-1 for West Ham.\n14:20 Comment: They got off to a good start.\n14:22 Comment: They've got a good start.\n14:25 Comment: Very early goals from Winston Reid and Diafra Sakho.\n14:29 Comment: Again, when the sides met here at the end of January,\n14:31 Comment: 2-0 to Liverpool.\n14:34 Comment: Raheem Sterling scoring home and away for Liverpool\n14:36 Comment: in those games.\n14:38 Comment: But of course now, live post Gerrard and post Sterling.\n14:44 Comment: Lucas brings it forward.\n14:46 Comment: Here is Chan between the lines.\n14:48 Comment: Sets up clay.\n14:50 Comment: And he's got a chance.\n14:52 Comment: A chance to score.\n14:53 Comment: Chan between the lines.\n14:55 Comment: Sets up Clyne to cross.\n14:57 Comment: And take it on the penalty spot.\n14:59 Comment: And Bruno almost caused a problem for Reid there.\n15:3 Comment: West Ham survive and work a clear and it's Pied on it again.\n15:7 Comment: You can see the tactic for Liverpool straight away.\n15:9 Comment: The two full-backs giving a whip.\n15:11 Comment: It's a lovely first touch.\n15:12 Comment: Lanzini heading goalwards here, fancies another.\n15:16 Comment: And this one's Arx-Wight.\n15:20 Comment: An opportunity there.\n15:21 Comment: Why wouldn't he have the confidence?\n15:22 Comment: He's got his first goal.\n15:24 Comment: We're looking at Skrtle backing off, backing off.\n15:26 Comment: This is the first time that we've seen the opposition,\n15:28 Comment: certainly in this game, but others get at the two centre-backs\n15:31 Comment: without that midfield screen who have done so well for them,\n15:33 Comment: especially Lucas.\n15:37 Comment: Lanzini scored in his West Ham debut\n15:39 Comment: when they were knocked out of the Europa League at Astrid.\n15:42 Comment: First Premier League goal in the bag now as well.\n15:46 Comment: Firmino, that's for Coutinho.\n15:49 Comment: And Bona had a few yards head start.\n15:53 Comment: He's only got really Firmino to hit.\n15:54 Comment: He's found him.\n15:56 Comment: He's overrun it.\n15:58 Comment: Straight into Lanzini.\n16:0 Comment: He doesn't do Nobel any favours.\n16:2 Comment: Liverpool have it back again, but then Milner gives it away.\n16:6 Comment: And Bona.\n16:8 Comment: And he's got it.\n16:10 Comment: He's got it.\n16:23 Comment: A little fretful back there, West Ham.\n16:25 Comment: They've got to do better with that first pass\n16:27 Comment: just to relieve a bit of the pressure.\n16:28 Comment: Don't lash it.\n16:29 Comment: A bit of composure.\n16:31 Comment: Obviously we can hear the crowd getting up\n16:32 Comment: as soon as Liverpool close down,\n16:33 Comment: but you need to be stronger than that.\n16:35 Comment: Coutinho.\n16:37 Comment: Fizzes it into the feet of Benteke.\n16:38 Comment: Instant lay-off for Gomez.\n16:44 Comment: Coutinho, Escort and Lovren are in open play.\n16:47 Comment: Tompkins.\n16:48 Comment: Oh, as he almost presented that to Benteke.\n16:49 Comment: Risky header.\n16:52 Comment: Just about got enough on it.\n16:54 Comment: I think the initial shout he got was to let it go.\n16:56 Comment: And then when he hit it back to Randolph,\n16:57 Comment: I think he might have caught him unaware there,\n16:59 Comment: but he's quite composed the way he dealt with that.\n17:3 Comment: Obiang.\n17:9 Comment: By Lanzini.\n17:10 Comment: Here's Kouyate.\n17:12 Comment: Lovren in control.\n17:13 Comment: And Melno inside.\n17:15 Comment: Skrdo.\n17:23 Comment: You go away to Anfield and you're just saying to yourself,\n17:25 Comment: keep it nice and tight for the first 15 minutes.\n17:28 Comment: And West Ham have done reasonably well at this point.\n17:30 Comment: Obviously they've got the goal,\n17:31 Comment: but it just seemed like the pressure's starting to mount now.\n17:34 Comment: Great take from Chan.\n17:37 Comment: Lucas now.\n17:39 Comment: And it's a goal.\n17:41 Comment: Lucas now.\n17:43 Comment: He's headed up and he's crossed in.\n17:44 Comment: Good defending by O'Brien.\n17:48 Comment: Very good. Initially I thought he's gone too far past the near post,\n17:50 Comment: but Winston Reads called him back.\n17:53 Comment: It's so important for them to be strong today for these crosses.\n17:55 Comment: It seems to be coming in more so than you normally associate with a Liverpool team.\n18:0 Comment: Yeah, they're looking for an Arsenal performance today,\n18:2 Comment: not a Bournemouth one.\n18:8 Comment: Lovren.\n18:9 Comment: And here is Gomez.\n18:22 Comment: These phases of play at West Ham, don't get attracted to the ball.\n18:26 Comment: Don't get embarrassed by not having it.\n18:27 Comment: Just keep the shape, keep the distances right.\n18:33 Comment: Gomez again, always coming inside.\n18:36 Comment: Here's Benteke.\n18:40 Comment: Leave him, leave him, leave him!\n18:43 Comment: Moomin.\n18:46 Comment: Position across here.\n18:49 Comment: Charged out.\n18:58 Comment: Lucas.\n19:1 Comment: See West Ham, they're almost happy to let Lucas and Skrdl and Lovren have it.\n19:5 Comment: Well, they get the centre-half, but they're in least danger.\n19:8 Comment: Gomez, now followed away by Reid.\n19:10 Comment: That's the problem there for Gomez.\n19:12 Comment: If he cuts in certain to his right foot and then tries to put the ball in,\n19:15 Comment: it's actually easier to defend that as a centre-back,\n19:17 Comment: because it's coming right onto your head.\n19:19 Comment: It's when they get the width and they're playing them left-footed balls\n19:21 Comment: in between you and the goalkeeper that cause all the problems.\n19:24 Comment: Coutinho has found a little pocket of space.\n19:28 Comment: Shooting territory for Firmino.\n19:30 Comment: Dinks it with the outside of the right foot for Clyne.\n19:33 Comment: Liverpool win the corner.\n19:35 Comment: Good play, that's what they need to do.\n19:36 Comment: Keep probing through them central areas just to narrow West Ham up.\n19:40 Comment: And in doing so then it creates space for Clyne to attack down outside areas.\n19:48 Comment: And the first chance here for Skrdl and Lovren.\n19:51 Comment: Getting the opposition penalty area.\n19:57 Comment: 20 minutes gone.\n19:58 Comment: Moomin stands one up there towards Lovren.\n20:0 Comment: I think it was going on on both sides in there.\n20:3 Comment: Halfway as you often see, he'll give it away at the defenders.\n20:10 Comment: I think there's a push there as he's just leaning into him.\n20:14 Comment: As you're right, both got hold of each other's shirts,\n20:16 Comment: but I think probably the right decision there.\n20:24 Comment: And Brendan Rodgers, forward sees him now.\n20:26 Comment: Plenty of pressure on at the start of the campaign,\n20:28 Comment: but they've started well.\n20:30 Comment: He'll be behind today.\n20:34 Comment: Neatly tidied up by Lovren.\n20:39 Comment: I think Brendan Rodgers has been very aware of how well he needed to start this season.\n20:43 Comment: And obviously coupled with the fact he changed all his backroom staff,\n20:46 Comment: brought in new people that he hasn't really worked with before.\n20:49 Comment: Obviously the initial impression there straight away is that self-confidence is there.\n20:52 Comment: And I think that's what's been going on.\n20:53 Comment: Obviously the initial impression there straight away is that self-preservation\n20:56 Comment: because of the pressure that he was under remains to be seen.\n21:1 Comment: Suggestion from the Liverpool manager during the week that\n21:3 Comment: there'll be no more business done in the current transfer window.\n21:8 Comment: There's the danger man, Coutinho.\n21:12 Comment: Milner, Gomez.\n21:17 Comment: Milner again, Leoff and Firmino, Coutinho joining in.\n21:20 Comment: That's where those two can really cause problems.\n21:29 Comment: Milner again.\n21:30 Comment: It's for the run up on Tad Ghanoui, who'll chop it up and out of play.\n21:34 Comment: It'll be key for them at the moment, as we said.\n21:36 Comment: Standing captain Milner.\n21:38 Comment: And he'll be used to teams sitting deep against him, obviously with Manchester City.\n21:41 Comment: And he'll know about patience and just keep working the openings.\n21:46 Comment: Don't give away the ball too easily.\n21:49 Comment: I'm sure they'll be expecting West Ham, who are putting in a real good defensive shift at the moment,\n21:53 Comment: that they'll tire and then they'll hope to exploit that when it happens.\n21:56 Comment: He's got to be happy so far.\n21:58 Comment: Many sides are still easing into the new campaign.\n22:0 Comment: It's been all goal at West Ham. Slaban Bilic in as manager.\n22:3 Comment: Already into and out of the Europa League and the Premier League we've seen the sublime.\n22:7 Comment: And there we say the ridiculous as well.\n22:9 Comment: And of course off field then, issues with Diafra Saka with Ene Valencia.\n22:13 Comment: And the captain Kevin Nolan leaving during the week.\n22:17 Comment: Yes, he's been a good servant for West Ham over the last three or four seasons.\n22:21 Comment: But obviously when Sam Adlon-Dyce left,\n22:23 Comment: that wasn't a big surprise to see Nolan leave.\n22:25 Comment: But you're right, all those issues that he had to deal with,\n22:28 Comment: coupled with the fact that his owners like to speak quite a lot in the media,\n22:31 Comment: and have suggested this week that they had a deal in place for Benitez,\n22:34 Comment: and then suddenly you've just lost two home games as the new manager.\n22:38 Comment: It's not the greatest vote of confidence, is it, to talk about what could have been.\n22:43 Comment: It's all about looking to the future now for West Ham,\n22:45 Comment: particularly of course next season when they move to the Olympic Stadium.\n22:49 Comment: Fancy, they have to be a Premier League team by the time that comes around.\n22:53 Comment: Here's Obiang.\n22:54 Comment: It's a super ball out to the right-hand side.\n22:56 Comment: Lanzini just couldn't quite get there.\n22:59 Comment: But Obiang, who's a defensive midfielder, did well at Sampdoria.\n23:3 Comment: And he worked under some notable managers.\n23:6 Comment: Looking to show his passing range on that occasion.\n23:8 Comment: That's a lovely pass there.\n23:10 Comment: We saw a lot of energy from Lanzini.\n23:11 Comment: He must be buoyed by the fact that he's getting his goals,\n23:13 Comment: especially at a place like Anfield.\n23:19 Comment: Kouyate, not to chance that himself.\n23:23 Comment: And a nibble at the ankles of Gomez,\n23:24 Comment: and the Liverpool fans wanted a free kick for that.\n23:34 Comment: Tied it up by Ogonna.\n23:36 Comment: Gomez, an unusual substitute in the Champions League final last season.\n23:41 Comment: Without Juventus he was never getting in beyond Chiellini and Barzagli and Bonucci.\n23:46 Comment: That's a good touch from Gomez.\n23:48 Comment: Benteke into space.\n23:50 Comment: Liverpool with options on the far side.\n23:52 Comment: Firmino has the strength to hold off Nobel.\n23:56 Comment: Here's Klein now, looking for the early cross.\n23:58 Comment: And Randolph looking to prevent the corner.\n24:1 Comment: But he's not managed to do it.\n24:3 Comment: You can see Liverpool breaking at pace there.\n24:5 Comment: Mark Noble, unever so well, just to delay it slightly.\n24:8 Comment: This is a guy now who we talked about, Nolan Egan,\n24:10 Comment: will probably step up and be the club captain.\n24:12 Comment: Obviously West Ham born and bred.\n24:15 Comment: But we've got another difficult one now to defend in this corner.\n24:18 Comment: And it's interesting when the new manager comes in,\n24:20 Comment: how the system's changed,\n24:21 Comment: how you defend set pieces, corners especially.\n24:24 Comment: So I'm sure West Ham will still be quite new to it.\n24:27 Comment: And they'll drop it in there,\n24:28 Comment: and that fistful of the shirt of Benteke,\n24:30 Comment: which is right in the eye line of the referee it seems.\n24:33 Comment: Gomez.\n24:35 Comment: Lovren keeps it alive.\n24:38 Comment: Firmino.\n24:39 Comment: Good challenge by Tompkins.\n24:45 Comment: Alan Wilson, he's at it again.\n24:47 Comment: The destroyer of West Ham,\n24:48 Comment: he's got the lead goal for Bournemouth against Leicester.\n24:53 Comment: Welcome West Ham with play.\n24:54 Comment: All the options to the left.\n24:58 Comment: Kouyate, thrashes one goal,\n24:59 Comment: where it might break again.\n25:2 Comment: They're looking for a corner, Cresswell.\n25:6 Comment: Smacking the ground, no wonder.\n25:7 Comment: The goal suddenly opened up for him,\n25:9 Comment: just on the back of a ricochet.\n25:10 Comment: That was a wonderful opportunity to make it two.\n25:13 Comment: And Kouyate with this happy knack of popping up with a goal or two.\n25:18 Comment: It was a decent hit that was charged down,\n25:19 Comment: then the opportunity presented itself for Cresswell.\n25:23 Comment: Liverpool find it hard enough to break down West Ham as it is at one goal.\n25:26 Comment: They have to be careful,\n25:27 Comment: keep their concentration level high that it doesn't suddenly become two.\n25:32 Comment: Big day for Aaron Cresswell after what went on against Bournemouth,\n25:35 Comment: and of course he's a Liverpool lad,\n25:36 Comment: former Liverpool youth.\n25:39 Comment: Made his name,\n25:40 Comment: with Tranmere and then going on to a twitch.\n25:43 Comment: It'll be a massive day for him.\n25:44 Comment: And when you think about Cresswell coming in at Ipswich initially,\n25:47 Comment: you would know the work he'd do under Mick McCarthy,\n25:50 Comment: who is about defending first,\n25:52 Comment: and then whatever you give us going forward is a bonus.\n25:54 Comment: Same with Sam Allardyce,\n25:55 Comment: he's got some massive onus on doing your defensive work.\n25:59 Comment: So then to see the mistakes he made over the last couple of games,\n26:2 Comment: not just last week, but even against Leicester,\n26:4 Comment: he was really poor, was really surprising.\n26:5 Comment: Bearing in mind that is the player of the year for West Ham.\n26:8 Comment: Stunted all bar one League Cup game last season.\n26:11 Comment: Never present in the Premier League, Aaron Cresswell.\n26:15 Comment: Many people were looking at him for a potential England cap.\n26:19 Comment: Leighton Baines, Luke Shaw, Gibbs, Bertrand.\n26:22 Comment: Lots of options in that position at the moment.\n26:28 Comment: Free touch for Lovren.\n26:31 Comment: And he can set off here.\n26:34 Comment: He's lost it now, he's out of position.\n26:36 Comment: Lanzini looks to take advantage.\n26:39 Comment: It's towards Payet.\n26:41 Comment: Kline gets a toe in.\n26:43 Comment: And from Nino Bundles over Mark Noble.\n26:46 Comment: Great play again from the West Ham captain.\n26:48 Comment: Just no real options to pass forward,\n26:50 Comment: so he bought the free kick just to buy a bit of rest time now\n26:52 Comment: for his defensive players and midfield union.\n26:55 Comment: Given all that's gone on,\n26:56 Comment: Mark Noble, not just on the pitch, but off the pitch,\n26:59 Comment: he's a huge presence for West Ham at the moment.\n27:1 Comment: Made his debut under Alan Pardew as a 17-year-old.\n27:4 Comment: Legend goes, he plays for the reserves as a 15-year-old.\n27:8 Comment: He did, I remember being at West Ham in 2002.\n27:11 Comment: He would come in on his school holidays to train with the first team.\n27:14 Comment: He was that good a player.\n27:16 Comment: And obviously the fans take to people like that.\n27:18 Comment: Born and bred.\n27:20 Comment: Understand what it means to play for West Ham.\n27:22 Comment: One of their own as such.\n27:24 Comment: So, a massive, important player for them.\n27:27 Comment: Just to get the ethos and the feel of the club across to the new guys.\n27:31 Comment: Milner.\n27:33 Comment: There is Gomes.\n27:35 Comment: He's headed behind Coutinho.\n27:42 Comment: West Ham fans will be having a little look at the clock now.\n27:45 Comment: Almost 28 minutes played.\n27:48 Comment: Darren Rambolff hasn't been on duly troubled so far.\n27:51 Comment: No, he hasn't, and they'll be delighted.\n27:53 Comment: I think the players will be absolutely delighted with that.\n27:55 Comment: I think they'll be delighted with that.\n27:56 Comment: Randolph as well, because obviously goals were going in last week.\n27:59 Comment: But he actually played very well.\n28:1 Comment: Made a lot of good saves.\n28:2 Comment: It could have been considerably worse.\n28:4 Comment: It's a risky from Lovren.\n28:6 Comment: He's pressurised by Lanzini.\n28:7 Comment: He's lost it.\n28:9 Comment: Lanzini.\n28:10 Comment: He's got Sacco there with him.\n28:11 Comment: Squares it for Sacco.\n28:12 Comment: Kline to the rescue.\n28:13 Comment: Noble now.\n28:14 Comment: And West Ham lead by two goals to nil.\n28:18 Comment: Dejan Lovren, who was wrestling with the team last week.\n28:22 Comment: He's got a bit of a problem.\n28:24 Comment: Dejan Lovren, who was resurrecting his career it seemed this season\n28:28 Comment: with a huge error.\n28:29 Comment: And West Ham have taken ruthless advantage.\n28:32 Comment: Incredible.\n28:33 Comment: We said about it.\n28:34 Comment: Don't do anything stupid to make it go to two nil.\n28:36 Comment: And your centre half is trying to take people on in the left back slot.\n28:39 Comment: And you're right.\n28:40 Comment: Lovren had a really difficult first season.\n28:43 Comment: Got a bit of consistency now.\n28:44 Comment: With Liverpool playing full-backs narrow and stuff like that.\n28:47 Comment: But this is ridiculous.\n28:48 Comment: Just deal with it and get back to your centre half position.\n28:51 Comment: He gets away with it there.\n28:53 Comment: But makes matters even worse.\n28:55 Comment: And at first you feel make the right pass.\n28:57 Comment: They get a good block in there.\n28:58 Comment: But really good composure from the captain just to slot it in.\n29:3 Comment: It's a beautifully composed finish from Mark Noble.\n29:6 Comment: Kept his head when many were losing theirs.\n29:8 Comment: And just side-footed it beautifully into the back of the net.\n29:13 Comment: Less than half an hour played at Anfield.\n29:15 Comment: It's Liverpool nil.\n29:16 Comment: West Ham two.\n29:17 Comment: Incredible.\n29:18 Comment: Talk about Liverpool.\n29:19 Comment: Not even conceding any goals yet.\n29:20 Comment: And now they've given away two poor goals already.\n29:27 Comment: Just as we were speaking about what a key influence he is and has to be now for West Ham.\n29:32 Comment: Mark Noble pops up with the goal.\n29:37 Comment: This is an opportunity just for them to settle down now.\n29:39 Comment: No.\n29:40 Comment: Obviously I'd say Mark Noble's probably saying to the manager\n29:42 Comment: he doesn't know when to leave the midfield unit to go and engage.\n29:44 Comment: Should he just let Liverpool have the ball?\n29:46 Comment: And up to this point they've been making their decisions.\n29:48 Comment: Those key decisions.\n29:49 Comment: They've done really well.\n29:50 Comment: When to leave their slot.\n29:51 Comment: Because at the moment now it's up to Liverpool to break down.\n29:54 Comment: To find the space to create openings.\n29:58 Comment: Saka was injured in the flurry of play that preceded the Nobel strike.\n30:4 Comment: He's had an adductor problem.\n30:9 Comment: You see the communication with Obiang.\n30:11 Comment: They're just trying to figure it out exactly who goes and when they go.\n30:16 Comment: He's detailed with keeping tabs on who and what space.\n30:20 Comment: Brendan Rodgers talking to Gary McAllister there.\n30:23 Comment: The newly employed first team coach doing what they need to do.\n30:26 Comment: Now obviously now they're going to have to take risks.\n30:30 Comment: Because West Ham are just not coming out of them slots.\n30:32 Comment: But what they are doing is really counterattacking at pace.\n30:37 Comment: Well tactically they were set up nicely at 1-0 up.\n30:40 Comment: And how good is it looking at 2-0 up now?\n30:42 Comment: They frustrated Liverpool, denied them space.\n30:46 Comment: Particularly the two, Coutinho and Firmino, that they look to get on it.\n30:51 Comment: Half an hour gone. This is so important.\n30:53 Comment: These final 15 minutes for West Ham.\n30:54 Comment: Can they get to that half time with that two goal lead?\n31:1 Comment: They're turning into the Jekyll and Hyde team of the season already West Ham.\n31:7 Comment: It's incredible this Premier League this season in terms of\n31:10 Comment: how hard home teams are finding positive results.\n31:15 Comment: Lucas, Lucas, Lucas.\n31:18 Comment: Lucas.\n31:20 Comment: Firmino cushions it down for Milner.\n31:22 Comment: But again there's two and three.\n31:24 Comment: West Ham shirts always around the Liverpool player in possession\n31:27 Comment: once it enters that final third.\n31:32 Comment: Looks like it's Obiang who's down.\n31:34 Comment: No it's not.\n31:37 Comment: It's Kouyate, yeah it's Kouyate who's down.\n31:42 Comment: Not sure if he's landed awkwardly on his shoulder there.\n31:44 Comment: But as soon as he went down his other hand was raised\n31:48 Comment: to show that it's quite a serious one.\n31:51 Comment: West Ham we're hoping he's OK.\n31:53 Comment: He's holding his shoulder.\n31:55 Comment: You can see it when you stretch out that arm,\n31:58 Comment: trying to cushion your fall.\n32:0 Comment: I've seen these types of injuries before.\n32:3 Comment: We've seen Mark Noble talking to his teammates when there was a break in play.\n32:6 Comment: Now Milner needs to do the same.\n32:8 Comment: He needs to stress, listen, don't panic.\n32:10 Comment: There's still a lot of, an hour to go in the game.\n32:13 Comment: If they get one goal back it'll be interesting to see how West Ham react to that.\n32:20 Comment: Just checking the shoulder, maybe the collarbone.\n32:23 Comment: Checking Kouyate.\n32:25 Comment: There's a big presence in this side now.\n32:28 Comment: But it is incredible.\n32:29 Comment: West Ham scored just seven goals in their last 30 league visits to Anfield.\n32:32 Comment: We played 32 and a half minutes today, they've already got two.\n32:37 Comment: It's incredible.\n32:38 Comment: We talk about being a manager.\n32:40 Comment: And you've got a defence that's been playing ever so well\n32:42 Comment: for the first part of the season.\n32:44 Comment: You're just saying to them, just continue it.\n32:46 Comment: Don't change anything, don't try and be clever.\n32:49 Comment: And lo and behold, they're literally self-imploded.\n32:53 Comment: From Dejan Lovren's point of view,\n32:55 Comment: just as he was winning those Liverpool fans over again,\n32:58 Comment: he didn't just have one opportunity to clear it, he had two and three.\n33:2 Comment: It's incredible.\n33:3 Comment: And there has been a different change in how Liverpool are playing at home,\n33:6 Comment: as you would expect.\n33:7 Comment: Their full-backs are now high in wide, advanced areas.\n33:9 Comment: And it creates space then around the likes of Lovren and Skrtle.\n33:12 Comment: And even the best centre-halves in the league\n33:14 Comment: don't do particularly well if there's space everywhere.\n33:17 Comment: And the positive for Liverpool is there's still a good hour,\n33:20 Comment: you'd suggest, of this game to go.\n33:24 Comment: West Ham will be happy to force Gomez onto his left foot in those areas.\n33:28 Comment: It's always going to be difficult for him.\n33:30 Comment: This is a right-sided centre-back playing left-back\n33:32 Comment: and at times finding himself in left wing.\n33:35 Comment: Liverpool have to find better ways of opening West Ham up\n33:38 Comment: than Gomez being the out-ball.\n33:43 Comment: If he's looking for more down the left-hand side,\n33:45 Comment: it's a tricky one for Brendan Rodgers.\n33:47 Comment: He's got Alberto Moreno, a very attack-minded left-footed left-back,\n33:51 Comment: on the bench, but then Gomez has started the season so well.\n33:55 Comment: I guess with younger players coming in,\n33:57 Comment: you're always wary of confidence issues.\n33:59 Comment: Without a doubt.\n34:0 Comment: That young man has done fantastically well\n34:3 Comment: and looks like he's a very bright future ahead of him.\n34:5 Comment: But if you're dealing with this game in particular,\n34:8 Comment: then he might make that decision at half-time to say,\n34:10 Comment: we're going to have to start creating openings.\n34:12 Comment: At the moment, West Ham are defending so narrow and so deep\n34:16 Comment: that the only space is out in wide areas.\n34:19 Comment: Now, he wants a bit of quality, then he might well look to Moreno.\n34:22 Comment: I should say, of course, nothing wrong with the way Gomez is defending,\n34:25 Comment: it's just in that final third, as you said.\n34:28 Comment: He's done brilliantly.\n34:29 Comment: He might be slightly disappointed with the first goal,\n34:31 Comment: that he didn't clear it, because he was swinging his foot at it,\n34:34 Comment: but this is a young man who's going to learn over time.\n34:42 Comment: Skerredal comes to meet that.\n34:48 Comment: Jenkins out towards that far side,\n34:50 Comment: lovely touch from Payet to kill it.\n34:52 Comment: And it's Cresswell.\n34:54 Comment: Or Bonner to lift it forward.\n35:0 Comment: Skerredal.\n35:2 Comment: Hands on the back of Sakho.\n35:4 Comment: This is what we talk about Skerredal and Lovren,\n35:6 Comment: at times when there's a bit of pressure created,\n35:9 Comment: that's a silly foul to give away.\n35:10 Comment: Just lean up against him, his touch is probably going to take him back\n35:13 Comment: at your midfield anyway.\n35:14 Comment: Lucas is sweeping up those type of balls.\n35:17 Comment: But now they've given him a free opportunity to put the ball in the box,\n35:20 Comment: and it's caused him problems so far.\n35:23 Comment: Inside the last ten minutes of the first half,\n35:25 Comment: Liverpool 0-2 West Ham.\n35:28 Comment: Very early goal from Manuel Lanzini.\n35:32 Comment: The second just shy of the half-hour mark from Mark Noble.\n35:38 Comment: It's towards the back and Tompkins.\n35:41 Comment: Defensive header from Gomez, falls for Reid.\n35:44 Comment: He goes towards the back post.\n35:45 Comment: Milner to challenge, Noble's on it again.\n35:51 Comment: He's got his head in his hands and he should do,\n35:52 Comment: because he's got the ability to hit the target from there,\n35:54 Comment: no doubt about it.\n35:55 Comment: And that, coupled with Cresswell's chance earlier,\n35:58 Comment: Liverpool could be looking at four.\n36:2 Comment: It's not been a comfortable day so far for the home side.\n36:6 Comment: Lucas squeezes it forward for Firmino.\n36:13 Comment: Chep.\n36:16 Comment: A bustling style of his.\n36:19 Comment: Gomez.\n36:21 Comment: Mark could have crossed to Conlon,\n36:23 Comment: Milner's popped up in the penalty area.\n36:25 Comment: Risky from Tompkins.\n36:29 Comment: Gomez again.\n36:31 Comment: With the goal on the outside, Lanzini's back defending.\n36:34 Comment: Tompkins can clear, only as far as Coutinho.\n36:39 Comment: Good work from Lanzini again,\n36:40 Comment: right in front of those travelling supporters.\n36:44 Comment: And here goes Kouyate.\n36:45 Comment: Great play by Kouyate,\n36:46 Comment: that's just a relief of pressure once again.\n36:49 Comment: And we're seeing Gomez, unfortunately,\n36:50 Comment: getting caught in left-wing positions\n36:52 Comment: when you need a bit of quality,\n36:54 Comment: and that's not really his strength,\n36:55 Comment: certainly at this stage of his career.\n36:59 Comment: Daniel Sturridge back home and back training.\n37:2 Comment: Old timeline in his return to first-team action, though.\n37:9 Comment: No Jordan Henderson either, Adam Lallana also.\n37:11 Comment: Remains out of the side at the moment.\n37:18 Comment: And Noble is giving away the free-kick here,\n37:20 Comment: solidly in on Chan.\n37:28 Comment: Looks like he's got a sting in the shin there,\n37:29 Comment: or he might have just opened up his ankle.\n37:32 Comment: It was a block tackle,\n37:33 Comment: two players going in wholeheartedly.\n37:38 Comment: And it's a goal.\n37:46 Comment: And so to injury, yellow card for Mark Noble.\n38:0 Comment: I don't know why that's a booking, I've got to be honest.\n38:2 Comment: That's a bit of a different angle,\n38:3 Comment: it's slightly over the ball.\n38:6 Comment: Good referee in there in the end,\n38:7 Comment: but it looks like it's a very sore one for Mark Noble,\n38:8 Comment: he might have opened up his ankle.\n38:10 Comment: They're not easy to run off when you do that.\n38:13 Comment: Gomez,\n38:14 Comment: trying to slip it into Coutinho,\n38:15 Comment: just got stuck under his feet.\n38:19 Comment: And then Milner,\n38:20 Comment: using his natural Yorkshire strength to see off Lanzini.\n38:26 Comment: Gomez again.\n38:29 Comment: You've got to credit Gomez,\n38:31 Comment: he's not shying away from pushing high up that pitch.\n38:35 Comment: That says a lot about his character,\n38:36 Comment: he still wants that ball.\n38:39 Comment: Here he is again.\n38:42 Comment: Milner.\n38:44 Comment: Gomez feeds it in behind,\n38:45 Comment: lovely ball for Firmino,\n38:46 Comment: who beat it to the end line.\n38:50 Comment: Joshua stayed in play,\n38:51 Comment: Coutinho now,\n38:53 Comment: Reid with a brilliant smothering tackle.\n38:58 Comment: First suggestion was it did look out on the end line.\n39:2 Comment: Great feed from Payet,\n39:3 Comment: as he wiggles away from two.\n39:5 Comment: Still going,\n39:6 Comment: and again Chan with a great recovery tackle.\n39:13 Comment: Here's Firmino.\n39:18 Comment: Lanzini as well as the early goal.\n39:21 Comment: He has put in a shift defensively on this right side as well.\n39:24 Comment: They have real work weight that West Ham midfield,\n39:28 Comment: but they've just got to be careful.\n39:29 Comment: We're getting to the last five, six minutes of this first half now.\n39:31 Comment: Concentration will be key.\n39:33 Comment: Don't give away anything silly.\n39:34 Comment: They just need to get into half-time,\n39:36 Comment: tune it up.\n39:43 Comment: That's a little late with the tackle from Milner.\n39:54 Comment: Tompkins,\n39:55 Comment: that goes short to Lanzini.\n40:0 Comment: There's one for Kouyate to chase.\n40:1 Comment: Looking to trouble Lovren again.\n40:4 Comment: Tom is grateful to hear the whistle.\n40:6 Comment: Very grateful.\n40:7 Comment: Trying to let the ball bounce there,\n40:8 Comment: could quite easily have just headed that out,\n40:10 Comment: but it's just been a little bit too clever,\n40:12 Comment: and invited the pressure on him.\n40:20 Comment: Looks like the Kop end is going to have to prove\n40:22 Comment: to be Liverpool's inspiration in the second half.\n40:26 Comment: Struggling to find a goal in the first here,\n40:27 Comment: Firmino.\n40:31 Comment: Good touch from Aubameyang.\n40:33 Comment: Risky from Lanzini,\n40:34 Comment: right by Chan.\n40:36 Comment: West Ham rescue it.\n40:40 Comment: Pius, that's it there for Croswell.\n40:43 Comment: That one too heavy for Noble.\n40:56 Comment: Lovren.\n40:59 Comment: Coutinho.\n41:2 Comment: Firmino.\n41:3 Comment: That's Klein there with him.\n41:4 Comment: He's asked a lot of Klein there.\n41:7 Comment: Could Firmino have taken it on himself, I wonder.\n41:10 Comment: He's quick Klein, but not that quick.\n41:12 Comment: West Ham need to get to half-time now,\n41:14 Comment: because I'm looking at Mark Noble,\n41:15 Comment: just struggling to close the space there.\n41:17 Comment: Straight away doesn't get in,\n41:18 Comment: and I think he's struggling with that ankle.\n41:21 Comment: That's the thing, the distances and the depth\n41:23 Comment: that they've had up to this point\n41:24 Comment: have been really good for West Ham,\n41:25 Comment: and Liverpool found it hard to open it.\n41:28 Comment: If he doesn't emerge for the second half,\n41:30 Comment: then Rhys Oxford is there,\n41:31 Comment: who of course started at Arsenal,\n41:33 Comment: and didn't have a great day against Leicester,\n41:35 Comment: subbed for Obiang at half-time,\n41:36 Comment: and wasn't in the squad for the Bournemouth game.\n41:38 Comment: But Josh Cullen,\n41:40 Comment: the referee of Ireland U19 international,\n41:42 Comment: Martin Samuel, an 18-year-old Norwegian,\n41:44 Comment: striker Elliot Lee.\n41:47 Comment: Teenage defender Kyle Loyle is there,\n41:49 Comment: and Matt Jarvis, those are the outfield options.\n41:52 Comment: I think any of them young boys now watching\n41:54 Comment: will be desperate to get on at Anfield.\n41:59 Comment: Milner.\n42:1 Comment: Wrecking ball to the far side.\n42:10 Comment: It'll be interesting to see what the reaction is\n42:12 Comment: off of the crowd here,\n42:13 Comment: the Liverpool faithful, and whether or not\n42:17 Comment: they'll be happy with how the season has started.\n42:19 Comment: Of course they will, but\n42:20 Comment: I think they'll probably be thinking,\n42:22 Comment: are we going back to what we were last year?\n42:24 Comment: A really big half-time talk will be needed here.\n42:28 Comment: I think, Gary, as we were suggesting,\n42:29 Comment: that it was a 7-0-0 at the time,\n42:31 Comment: or maybe 1-0 down,\n42:32 Comment: that this is a big, big game for Liverpool today\n42:34 Comment: to show that this perceived improvement\n42:37 Comment: at the start of this season is the real deal.\n42:40 Comment: You said it, if you'd have got those 10 points\n42:41 Comment: in your first four games,\n42:42 Comment: I don't think any team could wish for more, really.\n42:45 Comment: Considering as well the way Liverpool finished\n42:47 Comment: the back-end of last season.\n42:51 Comment: That's Badrakhan Lovren,\n42:52 Comment: who's a bit gingerly to his feet there.\n42:55 Comment: He must be wishing he was that direct\n42:57 Comment: just before the half-hour mark.\n43:1 Comment: They've definitely changed their system\n43:2 Comment: over the last three games going into this one\n43:4 Comment: in terms of the two full-backs defending reasonably narrow\n43:8 Comment: and protecting, obviously, the midfield screen.\n43:10 Comment: And he's benefited from it, Lovren,\n43:12 Comment: like he did at Southampton under Snyder\n43:14 Comment: when you're on those type of guys.\n43:16 Comment: But as soon as they went a bit more expansive\n43:17 Comment: and space was created,\n43:19 Comment: he's looked at...\n43:20 Comment: Far less convincing.\n43:22 Comment: Payet, tied to the end line.\n43:25 Comment: And the corner conceded by Lucas.\n43:28 Comment: Inside the last 90 seconds of normal time\n43:30 Comment: in this first half.\n43:32 Comment: How ambitious will West Ham be here?\n43:35 Comment: The delivery's got to take Benteke out of it\n43:37 Comment: because as we said there, look,\n43:38 Comment: on that six-yard box,\n43:39 Comment: can pick up the flight and go and attack it.\n43:44 Comment: Payet looking for another quality delivery\n43:46 Comment: and he's got it.\n43:48 Comment: Payet looking for another quality delivery here.\n43:50 Comment: Reid on the move and in around Minulek.\n43:53 Comment: Payet towards the near post.\n43:55 Comment: Easily away by Lucas.\n43:56 Comment: Recycled though by Aubien.\n44:18 Comment: Tompkins.\n44:20 Comment: Sets it there for Lanzini.\n44:24 Comment: Confident to hold it.\n44:29 Comment: And Reid,\n44:30 Comment: at the boxers' clock inside his head\n44:32 Comment: now as they're not too far away\n44:34 Comment: from that half-time whistle mill.\n44:37 Comment: Have to go all the way back to Randolph.\n44:44 Comment: And it's Kewt needs to screen over now.\n44:46 Comment: Close the gaps\n44:48 Comment: this last couple of minutes.\n44:51 Comment: Klein.\n44:55 Comment: Good run here made by Firmino.\n44:56 Comment: Sets it there for Chan.\n44:58 Comment: Here's the cross towards Benteke.\n45:0 Comment: Too much on that.\n45:3 Comment: Lovely little set-up.\n45:6 Comment: Just the cross letting Liverpool down there.\n45:8 Comment: That's where you get the benefit of having a centre-back\n45:10 Comment: as such in Tompkins.\n45:11 Comment: That right-back, because he defends narrow.\n45:14 Comment: He allows his centre-half-back to concentrate on the ball\n45:16 Comment: because he's taking Benteke underneath him.\n45:19 Comment: Here is his Premier League debut\n45:21 Comment: across Stanley Park at Everton.\n45:23 Comment: James Tompkins.\n45:27 Comment: He came in for us seven years ago now.\n45:32 Comment: Chan.\n45:34 Comment: Continuo works it on to Benteke\n45:36 Comment: and then left to Milner.\n45:37 Comment: Cross prevented by Reid.\n45:38 Comment: Gomez inside to Chan.\n45:42 Comment: Not sure he realised Lanzini was there.\n45:45 Comment: Iyate, chance to stretch those long legs of his.\n45:54 Comment: Great play by him though.\n45:55 Comment: To relieve the pressure.\n45:57 Comment: Took about three players to stop him there in the end.\n45:59 Comment: Now take his time getting back up.\n46:2 Comment: And he's got it.\n46:3 Comment: He did have that awkward fall a few moments ago.\n46:5 Comment: So, last-time medics would be aware of that\n46:7 Comment: as he went to ground there.\n46:33 Comment: Go, Pedro!\n47:3 Comment: Gomez on that far side.\n47:6 Comment: Very good piece of defending.\n47:9 Comment: Naby Anderson, a good job in there.\n47:12 Comment: It's going to be interesting to see what Brendan Rodgers does at half-time\n47:14 Comment: because Gomez is getting that ball.\n47:16 Comment: Every time he cuts back onto his right foot\n47:18 Comment: he allows the west-hand defence to squeeze the box\n47:21 Comment: and narrow any space for anyone to play in.\n47:23 Comment: So, if he, of course, does come in\n47:24 Comment: he should really sail over their heads for a free catch for Randolph.\n47:28 Comment: Here's Gomez again.\n47:31 Comment: Continuo.\n47:34 Comment: Klein.\n47:40 Comment: Well happy not to jump in there.\n47:41 Comment: Just jockey his man forwards and back.\n47:47 Comment: Camino.\n47:54 Comment: Well done Lanzini again who just stood his ground.\n47:57 Comment: Continuo. That's for Milner.\n47:59 Comment: And he'll get there.\n48:1 Comment: Corner conceded by Noble.\n48:3 Comment: And inside the last minute of this first half\n48:5 Comment: is there to be a threat from Liverpool here.\n48:8 Comment: Initially it looked like Milner had got in and he shouldn't really\n48:11 Comment: but Noble just recovered in time.\n48:14 Comment: They could do with pulling one back here.\n48:16 Comment: Can West Ham see it through to half-time?\n48:19 Comment: Short corner taken.\n48:20 Comment: Some of the crowd not too happy with that\n48:22 Comment: and Continuo won't get the free kick.\n48:26 Comment: Can West Ham be able to play their way to half-time here?\n48:31 Comment: And certainly when Camino concedes the free kick.\n48:35 Comment: So wasteful. You've got an opportunity just before half-time\n48:37 Comment: to put it in the box.\n48:39 Comment: Can you imagine what Ben Tecco is saying to his teammates now?\n48:42 Comment: All in all Gary, a great first half.\n48:44 Comment: Maybe beyond what West Ham would have hoped for even.\n48:47 Comment: Without a doubt it's beyond what they'd hoped for.\n48:49 Comment: But having said that there's been other chances.\n48:51 Comment: We've looked at Liverpool and we applauded them earlier\n48:54 Comment: about how strong they've been defensively this season.\n48:57 Comment: And on the day then that they go a bit more expansive\n48:59 Comment: which you'd expect them to do at Anfield\n49:1 Comment: no doubt about it against a West Ham team.\n49:3 Comment: It just brought up the old frailties that you associate\n49:5 Comment: with the likes of Lovren.\n49:8 Comment: Well there you go. The narrative pre-game was\n49:10 Comment: that Liverpool on the up West Ham struggling\n49:12 Comment: though you wouldn't guess it.\n49:14 Comment: Lightning start. Manuel Lanzini's first Premier League start\n49:17 Comment: and his first Premier League goal coming inside three minutes.\n49:20 Comment: And then the Dejan Lovren error on the end line\n49:22 Comment: and on the touch line led to Mark Noble slotting home a second.\n49:26 Comment: Analysis to come from studio from Sam Allardyce and Matt Holland\n49:29 Comment: after the break.\n49:30 Comment: But at half time at Anfield it's Liverpool 0 West Ham 2.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Thank you Connor, right on cue and as we were suggesting in the first half, well\n0:3 Comment: Brendan Rodgers has gone for Alberto Moreno for the second half\n0:8 Comment: Jose Gomez, request to right back now it seems\n0:13 Comment: Scotland love for Nemanja, the centre back partnership\n0:20 Comment: here is Milner\n0:23 Comment: early touch for Moreno, Jose Gomez in a back three\n0:30 Comment: Skirtle, Liverpool will look to find the start of the second half\n0:35 Comment: along the lines that West Ham found in the first, that's worked on to Klein\n0:39 Comment: managed to keep it in play, but out for a West Ham goal kick\n0:43 Comment: so, Brendan Rodgers tinkered with his formation last season, it looks like now\n0:47 Comment: with Klein playing as a right wing back, maybe Moreno left wing back\n0:50 Comment: and maybe a more comfortable position for Jose Gomez alongside Skirtle and Lovren\n0:55 Comment: Yes, I think he'll be comfortable there, obviously he can use his pace as a three as such\n0:59 Comment: but\n0:59 Comment: they need to do something and now you've got the likes of Klein\n1:3 Comment: Moreno, in advanced areas and they've got good quality when they do get in there\n1:7 Comment: and hopefully they'll be looking to find that killer pass\n1:10 Comment: Benteke will be looking for service, Raheem Sterling from Manchester City has found an early second half\n1:16 Comment: right through, the ex-Liverpool man\n1:18 Comment: won't have gone unnoticed in these parts\n1:21 Comment: a big opportunity now for Alberto Moreno, just to force the manager's hand\n1:28 Comment: into the back of the net, and he's got it, he's got it\n1:29 Comment: and he's got it, he's got it, he's got it\n1:29 Comment: and he's got it, he's got it\n1:29 Comment: he's got it, he's got it\n1:30 Comment: S vely vor.\n1:31 Comment: He was a tough guys, terrible\n1:44 Comment: We're going into the quarter god Charli one hand and the bad guys at one and two\n1:53 Comment: scherta\n1:54 Comment: He celebrated a series of ÑÐ°Ð·ÑÐ°Ð±Ð¾Ñations in 2015\n1:59 Comment: for his game.\n1:59 Comment: Lanzini's header over Ogbunna,\n2:2 Comment: and calmly ushered back into the hands of Darren Randolph.\n2:6 Comment: Something different for West Ham to have a look at now, of course, as well.\n2:9 Comment: You've seen the ball up to Ben Tekin.\n2:11 Comment: I could see him just showing where he wants it on his chest.\n2:14 Comment: If it's up around his head, the two centre-backs of West Ham\n2:16 Comment: can take him under the ball, or they can make him head it up,\n2:19 Comment: and yeah, he'll get no control.\n2:20 Comment: He won't be able to bring any players into the game.\n2:23 Comment: That ball up to him has to be better than just lumped up there.\n2:25 Comment: Lanzini, a good challenge by Firmino.\n2:31 Comment: Can he find a way beyond the long legs of Obiang, though?\n2:37 Comment: Noble.\n2:38 Comment: Sacco, oh, almost.\n2:40 Comment: Just been a lot from there.\n2:42 Comment: Not seen a whole lot of Diapro Sacco so far.\n2:51 Comment: Here's Moreno.\n2:55 Comment: And Tompkins will have to think a little bit more now,\n2:59 Comment: right back with Moreno raiding up and down that left-hand side for Liverpool.\n3:4 Comment: Here's Milner with him.\n3:6 Comment: Squeezes it inside, but just beyond Coutinho.\n3:10 Comment: Noble to drive West Ham forward.\n3:14 Comment: Moreno from one side and Lucas from the other to win it back for Liverpool.\n3:20 Comment: Ben Tekin's lay-off.\n3:22 Comment: Here's Gomez.\n3:25 Comment: The second line of attack of Liverpool, Coutinho, Firmino.\n3:30 Comment: They've got to threaten in behind, because at the moment,\n3:31 Comment: whenever Ben Tekin comes short, the West Ham defenders know they can crowd him out.\n3:35 Comment: As they did then, but it's broken here for Clyne, Firmino.\n3:38 Comment: Can he find a little pocket of space in there?\n3:41 Comment: West Ham again with two and three men back defending the danger area.\n3:46 Comment: It's pietrific and just skip away with it.\n3:51 Comment: Very elegantly done, and he's found a ball through the middle as well.\n3:54 Comment: Moreno had to make that.\n3:55 Comment: He's got the tackle, and he did.\n3:58 Comment: That is great defending there.\n3:59 Comment: We're talking about a left wing back, so he's going to be in advanced areas, but it's your starting position.\n4:3 Comment: You can always join in, but if you're in the wrong starting position, you'll never recover like he did there.\n4:9 Comment: Coutinho, Cugliate rather, takes some catching as well.\n4:12 Comment: There's Coutinho in his range, but always rising.\n4:16 Comment: Listen, we know Coutinho is a threat from that distance, but if the West Ham defenders,\n4:20 Comment: if they're going to allow anything, they will allow that.\n4:22 Comment: At the moment, Liverpool just not getting enough people in support.\n4:25 Comment: Benteke, look at the back four.\n4:27 Comment: High line, keeping Liverpool out of the box.\n4:35 Comment: Coutinho has so often proven a spark for this side.\n4:40 Comment: He has, he's certainly grown since last year.\n4:43 Comment: A real key player.\n4:44 Comment: You suggest this will be a really big season for him and Liverpool.\n4:49 Comment: Moreno across to Schurter.\n4:55 Comment: Can West Ham produce this terrific defensive discipline and shape?\n5:1 Comment: Right the way through 90 minutes plus here.\n5:6 Comment: Lucas.\n5:8 Comment: Benteke.\n5:10 Comment: Looking to come back to support.\n5:11 Comment: Coutinho, eased off it by Lanzini.\n5:17 Comment: This one forwards, eased on by Lovren.\n5:20 Comment: There's Lucas.\n5:23 Comment: Klein.\n5:24 Comment: Look to leave it to.\n5:25 Comment: Milner.\n5:26 Comment: Get a second bite of this.\n5:30 Comment: It's just looking slightly messy.\n5:32 Comment: Liverpool's offensive player.\n5:34 Comment: Now Milner is the holding midfielder.\n5:35 Comment: Just stay there and just keep moving the ball about.\n5:37 Comment: Wait for the openings.\n5:38 Comment: Get your ball to your wide players' end.\n5:40 Comment: At the moment, Milner in his desperation to do well for Liverpool is running all over the place.\n5:44 Comment: Coutinho.\n5:45 Comment: Almost wriggled away from Obiang.\n5:48 Comment: Danger spotted by Tompkins.\n5:49 Comment: Here's Gomez.\n5:50 Comment: He won't be shy to push on from centre-back.\n5:52 Comment: Firmino.\n5:54 Comment: Blocked down.\n5:55 Comment: By Cresswell.\n5:56 Comment: Lucas.\n5:58 Comment: Pressure.\n5:58 Comment: But is there a goal for Liverpool?\n6:2 Comment: Wall of sky blue in front of them.\n6:4 Comment: Lucas towards Benteke.\n6:6 Comment: Up in the air from Reid.\n6:7 Comment: He'll have to go again.\n6:10 Comment: Saka.\n6:11 Comment: Does well for his side there.\n6:19 Comment: How well they use the ball in this situation, West Ham's key.\n6:22 Comment: They've got to give a breather to the back four.\n6:24 Comment: Things like that are great.\n6:25 Comment: You don't really want to see the central midfielders taking on people,\n6:28 Comment: but certainly won the free kick and bought a bit of time.\n6:31 Comment: That's a yellow card for Coutinho.\n6:32 Comment: He was booked late in the first half.\n6:35 Comment: And one of Liverpool's chief attacking weapons.\n6:41 Comment: Well, he's off.\n6:44 Comment: That is incredible.\n6:46 Comment: We just said about Liverpool, don't self-implode.\n6:49 Comment: We said it at 1-0.\n6:50 Comment: Don't do anything stupid to give them a second goal.\n6:52 Comment: And once again,\n6:53 Comment: now,\n6:54 Comment: such an unnecessary goal.\n6:55 Comment: Such an unnecessary tackle like that.\n6:57 Comment: He actually pulls out of it, but the contact's there\n6:59 Comment: because he's not in control of the slide into the player.\n7:1 Comment: The referee seemed to have a long think about this Kevin Friend.\n7:7 Comment: It was brilliant from Payet.\n7:8 Comment: The balance.\n7:9 Comment: And then he spun away.\n7:11 Comment: It was clumsy as much as anything from Coutinho.\n7:15 Comment: What now for Liverpool?\n7:17 Comment: Two down.\n7:18 Comment: A man down.\n7:19 Comment: And the significance of the man who is down.\n7:21 Comment: Exactly.\n7:22 Comment: That is exactly the point.\n7:23 Comment: And he's the one man that you'd expect to find.\n7:24 Comment: Space in these tight areas between West Ham's two units.\n7:28 Comment: That's a massive blow for Liverpool.\n7:33 Comment: And Coutinho will miss the game at Old Trafford next as well.\n7:36 Comment: You see the knock-on effect of it.\n7:38 Comment: Something like that.\n7:44 Comment: O'Driscoll there with Gary McAllister.\n7:46 Comment: The two new staff members for Brendan Rodgers.\n7:49 Comment: It'll be interesting to see where the system goes now,\n7:51 Comment: because they seem to be trying everything to a back three.\n7:53 Comment: Initially at the start of the second half.\n7:55 Comment: Weren't playing that particularly well with that system either.\n7:58 Comment: The likes of Milner running around.\n8:0 Comment: He should be just holding that central area.\n8:2 Comment: Let the creative players get on the ball.\n8:4 Comment: And that's probably the frustration of Coutinho,\n8:6 Comment: that he wasn't seeing enough of the ball.\n8:9 Comment: Might have been asking Gary McAllister if he's got the boots with him today.\n8:14 Comment: Without a shadow of a doubt, they could deal with his quality\n8:18 Comment: and also his experience, his cool head.\n8:20 Comment: Because this is the situations where you can't let a back three,\n8:22 Comment: you can't let a bad situation escalate into a terrible one.\n8:26 Comment: That's a very good point.\n8:28 Comment: There's Gomez for a climb.\n8:31 Comment: Even with 10, you'll fancy up.\n8:34 Comment: There's still plenty of possession here in Liverpool.\n8:36 Comment: West Ham won't mind about that.\n8:38 Comment: This will be a team, understand Allardyce,\n8:40 Comment: will be well drilled on this type of scenario.\n8:42 Comment: Attack three defence sessions, making sure your full backs are narrow.\n8:45 Comment: Don't be outside the post when crosses come in.\n8:47 Comment: Get a good screen in front of your centre backs.\n8:49 Comment: And at the moment, this is like a wrestler he's West Ham back for.\n8:51 Comment: Look, they're not having to run anywhere.\n8:53 Comment: They're just jockeying across the pitch, keeping the distances right.\n8:59 Comment: Lovren.\n9:1 Comment: That's a decent early service from Moreno,\n9:3 Comment: but how quickly Tompkins gets to him and how quickly Lanzini is there in support.\n9:8 Comment: From a long way out, it's a decent hit,\n9:10 Comment: and Randolph forced into his first meaningful save of the day\n9:13 Comment: to deny Dan Lovren.\n9:14 Comment: You're playing at the back for West Ham\n9:16 Comment: and you're seeing the opposition centre-back shooting from 30 yards.\n9:19 Comment: Your delight.\n9:21 Comment: You're playing with that.\n9:26 Comment: They've been struggling to pick a way through, so Lovren let fly.\n9:32 Comment: Looking for his first Premier League goal still for Liverpool.\n9:43 Comment: What this might do for West Ham's season now,\n9:45 Comment: if they can see it through to a victory here.\n9:49 Comment: International break to come, and...\n9:51 Comment: As we said at the very start,\n9:52 Comment: everyone wants to go into that off the back of a positive result.\n9:56 Comment: Something you can bring with you.\n9:57 Comment: Absolutely, that would have been the thing,\n9:59 Comment: because from the start of the season and winning at the Emirates,\n10:2 Comment: you're thinking, wow, what a fantastic result.\n10:5 Comment: Two home games to come, and they've been destroyed in both them two games.\n10:8 Comment: So you're going into the international break now,\n10:11 Comment: on the back of something like this would make a massive difference to these players.\n10:15 Comment: Moreno inside for Firmino.\n10:18 Comment: He's going to really have to step up in this second half as well.\n10:21 Comment: He's that creative force here.\n10:26 Comment: All of Liverpool's play here is being marked really by the midfield four, West Ham,\n10:30 Comment: and not even getting to the back four.\n10:32 Comment: Benteke, and Bonner,\n10:34 Comment: he's got the hand on his shirt again, risky.\n10:36 Comment: And he's gotten away with it.\n10:38 Comment: Very risky.\n10:39 Comment: The key to that situation, you can hold someone's shirt,\n10:42 Comment: but it's when you let go.\n10:43 Comment: He just seemed like he held on a little bit too long.\n10:46 Comment: The crowd gets up, suddenly the referee's got a decision to make.\n10:51 Comment: Nice scurvle, always going to be pressurised here by Saka.\n10:55 Comment: And he did well in the circumstances.\n10:57 Comment: Gomez now.\n11:2 Comment: Firmino.\n11:6 Comment: It's a nice ball, Tompkins on the stretch to get there.\n11:9 Comment: And it's to go to ground, James Tompkins.\n11:12 Comment: Spotted his opportunity there.\n11:15 Comment: I think the crowd was shouting, not really because of the first tackle on his right-hand side,\n11:18 Comment: but the training left leg coming to do the play.\n11:21 Comment: That seemed...\n11:24 Comment: Kevin Friend starting to come under some pressure, I bet.\n11:28 Comment: He will do, as the crowd's noise becomes more and more.\n11:32 Comment: Milner's got to be a good captain's role here.\n11:35 Comment: Work with the ref, try and get him onside.\n11:46 Comment: Just going back to the Coutinho sending off the first.\n11:49 Comment: My understanding is,\n11:50 Comment: it was for something he said when he didn't get a free kick late in that first half.\n11:55 Comment: Was the second for you a yellow card as well?\n11:59 Comment: I think the second one was certainly...\n12:1 Comment: would have been a card because of the way he just crashed into the back of Payet,\n12:4 Comment: but it wasn't malicious, it wasn't anything like that, more clumsy than anything else.\n12:8 Comment: But if it is for descent for the first one, then that's just not acceptable.\n12:14 Comment: Well, that's my understanding of it.\n12:16 Comment: We'll have to clear that up as we go on.\n12:20 Comment: Tompkins to play a forward, Payet, who when he's been on it today,\n12:24 Comment: he's looked a bit as silky as he was in his Zucks seasons at Marseille.\n12:31 Comment: Could be a big hit for the West Ham supporters,\n12:33 Comment: since we say that, he's given it away to Milner.\n12:36 Comment: Here's Lucas to play a forward, Firmino on halfway, but with his back to goal.\n12:40 Comment: And there's the pressure, and it came instantly from Obiang.\n12:43 Comment: Mark Noble's taken a strip off a part there for a poor pass that gave way to possession,\n12:48 Comment: because it's so important that they can get the ball,\n12:49 Comment: West Ham, and just allow the crowd to get anxious about the fact that their team's not attacking.\n12:58 Comment: Moreno.\n13:0 Comment: He wins the throw-in.\n13:7 Comment: There's Milner.\n13:10 Comment: Bentake is really having to work hard for anything that comes his way today.\n13:14 Comment: A block by Obunna, Klein, Randolph is scrambling, and he'll get there.\n13:19 Comment: That's a much better ball up to Bentake.\n13:21 Comment: If you drop it into his chest with no real pace in it,\n13:23 Comment: as the centre-backer can't come over the top of you,\n13:25 Comment: and then with his strength he's able to turn and swivel,\n13:28 Comment: Obunna done well to block the shot, but that is the route they need to start doing,\n13:31 Comment: mixing it up a little bit, because as much as they play the football\n13:33 Comment: in front of the West Ham back four, it'll be comfortable.\n13:36 Comment: They'll deal with that all day.\n13:40 Comment: That was good from Obunna, he knew he couldn't win that.\n13:43 Comment: He bothered his time and got his blocking.\n13:49 Comment: A real air of anxiety around Anfield at the moment as Saka was down.\n13:56 Comment: They've got to realise there's still a long way to go in this game.\n14:0 Comment: You have to be careful, West Ham, don't give the crowd an opportunity\n14:3 Comment: to get into the referee's ear.\n14:4 Comment: I mean, we've got an experienced referee here, no doubt about that.\n14:9 Comment: And Skojan Lovren believes there's a little bit of play-acting going on here.\n14:14 Comment: This is a term you'll hear quite a lot about, managing the game.\n14:17 Comment: Now, this gives you a perfect opportunity.\n14:18 Comment: I think all the back four, I think, might know, will be delighted with this.\n14:22 Comment: Just a little breather, just reassess the situation, little reminders.\n14:26 Comment: Listen, guys, we ain't got to get any more goals, just keep it tight.\n14:29 Comment: We'll get an opportunity because Liverpool will take chances.\n14:33 Comment: He was caught, certainly caught in that collision with Mignolet.\n14:37 Comment: That would be a painful one, right into the ribs.\n14:40 Comment: Goalkeepers always get a free one on that.\n14:43 Comment: I'm sure if Skojan Lovren had seen the exact impact there,\n14:46 Comment: I think they were turning away a little bit.\n14:48 Comment: I think he was going to be a little bit more aggressive at the time.\n14:50 Comment: They would have realised it's legitimate here from Diapra Sacco.\n14:53 Comment: It's time for Danny Ings then to make his debut.\n15:0 Comment: He's been itching for this moment.\n15:4 Comment: Terrific for Burnley for the last few seasons under Eddie Howe and then Sean Dyche.\n15:10 Comment: And it's Roberto Firmino to go.\n15:13 Comment: I think that's a good decision.\n15:15 Comment: I think with Ings up there, he can work off of Benteke's flicks.\n15:18 Comment: And he's quite elusive, Ings.\n15:19 Comment: Finds gaps, good finisher when he gets the opportunity.\n15:22 Comment: We know how important he was to Burnley when his goals dried up.\n15:25 Comment: Unfortunately, their fate seemed to be sealed.\n15:27 Comment: But this is an opportunity for him now.\n15:30 Comment: A big move for Danny Ings.\n15:32 Comment: Can he make a quick impression?\n15:39 Comment: He's got a half an hour plus stoppage time here.\n15:48 Comment: It looks like Russell Baker is going to take a look at the final mark.\n15:59 Comment: Brendan Rodgers.\n16:1 Comment: I mean, this is exactly the type of scenario we didn't want to see unfold today.\n16:8 Comment: You probably could've envisioned that this would happen.\n16:10 Comment: They've defended so well.\n16:12 Comment: But you have to question whether or not he's reverted to tight.\n16:14 Comment: This is a manager who puts a lot of emphasis on possession of the football.\n16:17 Comment: where he talked about owning the space, not necessarily the ball,\n16:22 Comment: but obviously at home, Anfield, you've had some really positive results,\n16:25 Comment: you're now playing a team that has been struggling to keep clean sheets,\n16:28 Comment: you're going to go for them.\n16:29 Comment: But that slight difference in formation and the space that it creates\n16:34 Comment: and the vulnerability it creates in certain players in this team\n16:37 Comment: has been shown up.\n16:44 Comment: David Gold and David Sullivan.\n16:47 Comment: And they've been here many a time and have left without a positive result.\n16:53 Comment: It's today to be there, they as well, I wonder.\n16:55 Comment: Well, there's half an hour to go.\n16:58 Comment: The key thing will be if Liverpool manage to get a goal\n17:1 Comment: with enough time to put the pressure on, because West Ham surely will fade.\n17:4 Comment: They've worked very hard, those defensive positions, getting back early.\n17:13 Comment: Could they plunder a third here?\n17:15 Comment: They've rented out to Cresswell.\n17:16 Comment: Good angle for the cross.\n17:17 Comment: A bit too much on that.\n17:22 Comment: And now they're caught to get Liverpool going again.\n17:24 Comment: At least he's trying to be.\n17:26 Comment: What a waste that is.\n17:27 Comment: You think the Liverpool are a man-dancer,\n17:29 Comment: suddenly the impact that has on the defensive shape of corners,\n17:32 Comment: the responsibilities that certain have.\n17:36 Comment: It's a nice ball by Gomez, Ings.\n17:42 Comment: And back to Gomez again.\n17:47 Comment: Love it.\n17:50 Comment: There's Moreno.\n17:51 Comment: Looks for the early cross.\n17:53 Comment: Tottenham's got himself into a good defensive position.\n18:6 Comment: Milner.\n18:8 Comment: As soon as he received it, Obiang right there on top of it.\n18:12 Comment: Moreno again, just behind Ings.\n18:14 Comment: It will come here for Milner.\n18:15 Comment: Ings was looking to get a little touch to divert it on target.\n18:20 Comment: That is a massive opportunity.\n18:23 Comment: Milner, the cross comes in, he finds himself on his own on the edge of the box,\n18:27 Comment: despite the numbers that West Ham had back there.\n18:29 Comment: We've seen frailties like this with West Ham early in the season at Leicester.\n18:32 Comment: They all get back in numbers, but no one deals with the actual cross or the man that they can only hit.\n18:38 Comment: That is a massive opportunity wasted for Liverpool.\n18:42 Comment: Ings wasn't too far away from contact there.\n18:45 Comment: motivo an onarado\n19:0 Comment: Nice back Blues.\n19:8 Comment: What a matchday for Real Madrid.\n19:10 Comment: Nice return Siege.\n19:10 Comment: Nice comeback.\n19:11 Comment: Chelsea When we come back a lot more similar, but Evening ëª°ï¿½ado Mane,\n19:12 Comment: Last game has picked up an results.\n19:13 Comment: He'sï¿½ï¿½.\n19:14 Comment: All in the match.\n19:14 Comment: Was able to garner a big shot.\n19:14 Comment: The two are passing up the chairs.\n19:15 Comment: overlapping.\n19:15 Comment: The goal section.\n19:15 Comment: See we're right up here.\n19:15 Comment: I could do it.\n19:15 Comment: He's been a little bit wasteful lately.\n19:17 Comment: They get the opportunity to make a pass and relieve the pressure,\n19:20 Comment: he's got to make sure, even if it's a simple pass,\n19:23 Comment: just keep the continuity, just stop Liverpool having the ball.\n19:32 Comment: Milner...\n19:34 Comment: To Ping, now to the far side in the general direction of Moreno.\n19:37 Comment: Followed away by Tompkins, on by Aubier.\n19:40 Comment: Here is Sacco, and Noble.\n19:42 Comment: Play it now, Sacco wants it in behind Skrtle.\n19:46 Comment: Almost.\n19:47 Comment: Challenged by Gomez, and then Milner quickly for Ings.\n19:51 Comment: Now Bonner out from the centre.\n19:54 Comment: Ings, little injection of pace, and off he goes.\n19:57 Comment: Good run from Danny Ings, Benteke tries to go back to him again.\n20:2 Comment: Bonner done ever so well there, looked like he overrun it,\n20:5 Comment: but he just managed to use his physical strength to stop the 1-2 back to Ings.\n20:9 Comment: But that's what you want, you need Ings in and around Benteke.\n20:11 Comment: If he's having a hard time,\n20:12 Comment: if he's trying to drive from right wing,\n20:14 Comment: surely the whiff will come from Klein.\n20:17 Comment: Well, positive from Danny Ings, but he couldn't find a way\n20:20 Comment: beyond the considerable frame of Angelo and Bonner in the end.\n20:29 Comment: Play it.\n20:31 Comment: Belon Kouyate, who receives it now from Tompkins.\n20:33 Comment: How do we?\n20:52 Comment: Ings!\n21:3 Comment: Nice first-time ball for Cresswell.\n21:7 Comment: It goes into the penalty area, across the face of goal,\n21:11 Comment: swept away by Scherbel.\n21:25 Comment: Milner.\n21:33 Comment: There's Lucas.\n21:38 Comment: There was games like this in the past when Liverpool were struggling.\n21:42 Comment: The X Factor, that was Luis Suarez, always seemed to find a way,\n21:45 Comment: but that's well in the past now.\n21:48 Comment: You're talking about a special player there, him and Sturridge.\n21:51 Comment: You can't replace those type of guys,\n21:52 Comment: certainly in the form they were in that season.\n21:55 Comment: But I'm looking at Liverpool now,\n21:58 Comment: they just seem to be playing off the cuff,\n22:0 Comment: I'm not quite sure any of them know exactly what they're supposed to be doing\n22:3 Comment: in the system.\n22:7 Comment: They've beaten four times here in the league last season,\n22:9 Comment: Aston Villa, Chelsea, Palace and Manchester United.\n22:14 Comment: They're about to succumb early in the campaign to an Anfield defeat to West Ham,\n22:18 Comment: that's sloppy from Lovren,\n22:20 Comment: he was never in control of that situation.\n22:29 Comment: I'd be very surprised if he doesn't get booked for that.\n22:31 Comment: Yeah.\n22:33 Comment: It looks like he's gotten away with it,\n22:35 Comment: terrific from Coyote on the flipside.\n22:42 Comment: That's a booking, left foot coming round.\n22:44 Comment: This is what you're talking about when you're under a bit of pressure.\n22:48 Comment: Players don't keep that discipline.\n22:59 Comment: Pallet looking for something short here, is he?\n23:3 Comment: I won't be hoping so, he's forward.\n23:6 Comment: He's getting his head on something.\n23:12 Comment: It's taken short, to Noble.\n23:16 Comment: Tompkins.\n23:18 Comment: He's got a right winger tricking him here, I wonder.\n23:20 Comment: Not quite.\n23:21 Comment: Now he's got to chase Moreno.\n23:23 Comment: He's just presented it straight back to Baia.\n23:27 Comment: Man free inside.\n23:28 Comment: Ogbonna.\n23:33 Comment: Not exactly where you want your centre-back, in the number 10 position.\n23:36 Comment: That's exactly what I was about to say there.\n23:39 Comment: If you're bringing your centre-backs up for a free kick, wide free kick,\n23:42 Comment: and you play it short...\n23:45 Comment: I can't explain what you're shouting at that player as you're running back.\n23:49 Comment: Speaking from countless experience, no doubt, Gary.\n23:54 Comment: They'll be making sure they didn't do it again.\n23:59 Comment: Here is Gomez.\n24:0 Comment: He's got a lot of Milneau there.\n24:4 Comment: Noble, caught by Lucas.\n24:6 Comment: And all these little fouls from a Liverpool point of view\n24:8 Comment: are just killing any momentum they're trying to build up.\n24:11 Comment: He's had a painful afternoon, Noble, but he's done great.\n24:14 Comment: Got his body in the way, one free kick just to relieve the pressure.\n24:17 Comment: He's done really well, that, a real captain's example.\n24:21 Comment: Lucas, the latest to be booked.\n24:28 Comment: That is a painful afternoon.\n24:30 Comment: That right ankle of Mark Noble's took a fair wet this afternoon.\n24:46 Comment: Scradle underneath.\n24:48 Comment: Pieces picked up by Dimitri Payet.\n24:51 Comment: There's Noble again.\n24:52 Comment: Once the ball rolled inside to Kouyate.\n24:57 Comment: That's fed again off Tompkins.\n25:0 Comment: That's a good one.\n25:3 Comment: Keep the ball moving.\n25:6 Comment: Payet, lovely little ball, dinked in behind for Lanzini.\n25:9 Comment: Two in the penalty area.\n25:11 Comment: Ferret arriving in Cresswell.\n25:13 Comment: Not the greatest of crosses, though, Kouyate.\n25:16 Comment: Cannons off Lovren.\n25:17 Comment: Look where Ings is here.\n25:20 Comment: I know Liverpool are down a man, but if you're going to get back in the game,\n25:24 Comment: you need Ings, one of your furthest men forward,\n25:27 Comment: not on the edge of your own box.\n25:30 Comment: That's a good one.\n25:31 Comment: Clarence clearance, it's Ricochet for Sacco.\n25:33 Comment: He hasn't had many sights on goal today.\n25:36 Comment: Lovren goes to ground, here's Lanzini.\n25:40 Comment: Trying to smuggle it through to Sacco again.\n25:42 Comment: Kouyate looking to place one.\n25:44 Comment: And Mignolet behind it all the way.\n25:46 Comment: I know we talked about the inexperience on the West Ham bench,\n25:49 Comment: but I'd be interested to see whether or not Jarvis comes on.\n25:52 Comment: I know Matt very well, blistering pace, whether or not he's still got it\n25:57 Comment: because he's had his injury problem, but you'd certainly think that him on the right wing,\n26:0 Comment: you're soaking up the pressure and just give the ball to him as an outlet.\n26:9 Comment: Mignolet, trying to walk us right here.\n26:14 Comment: Morena.\n26:16 Comment: Around the outside, a bit of ball to find him.\n26:20 Comment: And again, that was rarely a one-on-one situation for West Ham defensively.\n26:25 Comment: If you've got your wing-backs, you're saying to Morena,\n26:27 Comment: push really high and wide,\n26:29 Comment: and then Mignolet just letting them know,\n26:30 Comment: you've got to get the ball every time.\n26:31 Comment: At the moment he's playing too deep and then Mignolet's looking to overlap him.\n26:34 Comment: Back to play by Klein.\n26:36 Comment: And away by Ogbonna, only as far as the edge though.\n26:39 Comment: Lucas for Liverpool.\n26:44 Comment: Moreno.\n26:45 Comment: Now got across again.\n26:47 Comment: Outside of the left boot this time.\n26:50 Comment: West Ham can easily clear.\n26:52 Comment: Skirtless steps in.\n26:53 Comment: Here's Mignolet.\n26:55 Comment: That's a terrific toe-in.\n26:58 Comment: Good work by Obiang.\n26:59 Comment: And now they've got the ball.\n27:0 Comment: Two forward here.\n27:2 Comment: Sacco against Lovren.\n27:5 Comment: And Lovren stands his ground.\n27:13 Comment: West Ham will be hoping just for an opportunity or two now.\n27:17 Comment: A break or two and maybe find a third goal that would certainly win it.\n27:27 Comment: Winston-Reed.\n27:28 Comment: Stark contrast to Lovren in the first half.\n27:31 Comment: Facing the wrong way.\n27:33 Comment: Pressure from behind just clears it.\n27:38 Comment: Not a long way he's come.\n27:39 Comment: I remember being at his debut at Villa Park\n27:42 Comment: when he played it right back and had an absolutely torrid day, Winston-Reed.\n27:47 Comment: Massive player for West Ham now and there he is to win his head.\n27:49 Comment: He really is. He's a strong man at that back four.\n27:52 Comment: You can obviously see the work that he's done under Sam Allardyce,\n27:54 Comment: probably day in, day out, the defensive drills.\n27:57 Comment: He's a real presence back there from now.\n28:2 Comment: Kouyate feeling he was just stronger there against Lucas.\n28:5 Comment: Kevin Friend, the referee, thought otherwise.\n28:8 Comment: And again Milner with a hands-out stretch, looking for options further forward.\n28:12 Comment: Kept in play by Clyne but...\n28:14 Comment: He'll have to win it back again off Cresswell,\n28:16 Comment: which he's managed to do, a little inside ball for Milner.\n28:20 Comment: And Bonner steps out.\n28:27 Comment: And that's a bit sloppy from Cresswell.\n28:29 Comment: That is, he's going nowhere to give away a foul like that.\n28:32 Comment: It's just so...\n28:34 Comment: Such poor discipline there.\n28:36 Comment: Now he's just going to invite an easy ball into the box.\n28:46 Comment: The seconds and minutes continue to tick away.\n28:54 Comment: That's a good one.\n29:3 Comment: Milner, Kondra here.\n29:8 Comment: Bouncy movement in there.\n29:9 Comment: Goalkeeper stays at home.\n29:10 Comment: Benteke on his header but as the bodies went to ground,\n29:13 Comment: the whistle soon came.\n29:16 Comment: That's the type of ball you wouldn't mind defending,\n29:18 Comment: that floated one,\n29:19 Comment: allows you to get set and go and attack the ball.\n29:27 Comment: WHISTLE BLOWS\n29:57 Comment: HE CLEARLY SEEMS\n30:20 Comment: TO BE MAKING FIRE AT PRINCEised RELATIONSHIPS.\n30:23 Comment: CELEBRATING TOO YOU SEE THERE AND CREWS WELL.\n30:25 Comment: AND CREWS WELL. HE'S LIKE HEthe VENUESì\n30:26 Comment: HE'S LIKE HE'LL POSTAN outlets 117 een\n30:26 Comment: BATS TODAY, CHRANDWALT CREWS taiMMING...\n30:27 Comment: He's getting advanced area so clients not picking him up and he's dragging that right side center back out but good skills\n30:32 Comment: Should really maybe have looked for a pass when he got into a great position\n30:36 Comment: That's the home time boy carrying the threat here\n30:43 Comment: Wanna take him quickly it's a lovely ball out to Cresswell\n30:47 Comment: Seen a nice bit of invention on some of these corners and free kicks from West Ham today\n30:50 Comment: It certainly worked the extra man well on set pieces Danny Ings again having to come back and defend\n30:56 Comment: Initially when the substitution was made it was expected that they'd be peppering the West Ham goal. He hasn't materialized\n31:4 Comment: Then it's to Cresswell again time and again they've used that one Lanzini\n31:9 Comment: Open has come a long way. That's off climbing behind for a corner\n31:12 Comment: No\n31:25 Comment: Play it and absolutely no hurry to take this no surprise\n31:40 Comment: Oh\n31:42 Comment: decent ball in reed's head it flushes wide oh he knows he's seen he's picked the flight of that\n31:51 Comment: all the way got above his man didn't allow him to compete for the ball he should be hitting the\n31:57 Comment: target there what an opportunity that's why he's so frustrated he knows that his marker can't get\n32:9 Comment: near him and we talked about his ability to create chances with deliveries and what an opportunity\n32:14 Comment: that was to make it 3-0 well the back three has been jettisoned as jordan ibe comes on\n32:20 Comment: i think it had to be it wasn't working the idea of getting your two wing backs high and wide\n32:27 Comment: didn't affect west ham one bit\n32:29 Comment: that's the final roll of the dice in terms of substitutes for brandon rogers nil\n32:36 Comment: reyna wings and ibe\n32:39 Comment: his lever lifts it forward towards bentake who's stolen a yard here on reed\n32:43 Comment: and where's the support only had ings up there with him\n32:47 Comment: no answer straight red\n32:52 Comment: he's silly there martin noble he initially gets the foul on him which the referee gives\n32:59 Comment: but it's martin noble's lunge afterwards i'm not sure if he heard the whistle that a foul was given\n33:4 Comment: against him and in his desperation to make sure that he didn't lose possession he's done a\n33:8 Comment: stupid thing to do he's done a stupid thing to do he's done a stupid thing to do\n33:9 Comment: he's done a stupid thing to do he's done a stupid thing to do he's done a stupid careless tackle\n33:11 Comment: he was booked in the first half but it seemed to be a straight red that was issued by kevin friend there\n33:16 Comment: so down to 10 aside for the closing 12 minutes plus stoppage time noble looks absolutely bemused\n33:23 Comment: west ham are asking it will be explaining to him yes i gave the foul mark noble\n33:28 Comment: but in your desperation to win the ball before you realize the whistle's gone he's lunged in\n33:34 Comment: and that's so frustrating because when we talk about a key player for west ham this afternoon\n33:37 Comment: it's been here gets the ball in the middle of the field and then he's gone he's gone he's gone he's gone\n33:39 Comment: he's gone he's gone he's gone he's gone he's gone he's gone\n33:40 Comment: it's a foul there the whistle's blown and his study lunges in but it's nothing bad\n33:45 Comment: that's an incredible decision oh his stunts are on the ground all the way it looked like\n33:49 Comment: there for martin nobel he's stretching yeah so it looks like maybe he's not in control but he is\n33:57 Comment: the replay suggests he has cause for grievance here\n34:2 Comment: it wasn't a case of starting low and raising your boot which we've seen before\n34:9 Comment: It'd be interesting to know what the referee's view of that was,\n34:12 Comment: because if the play was ahead of him,\n34:13 Comment: he just sees Martyn Noble lunging from behind.\n34:17 Comment: And the fact that he saw it as a straight red as well,\n34:20 Comment: which it seemed to be,\n34:21 Comment: I didn't see a flash of his second yellow card and then a red.\n34:23 Comment: I think the lunge comes from his desperation to close the ball down.\n34:27 Comment: At no time did that seem reckless or going to be a chance.\n34:32 Comment: There he is, he's saying he's lunged with two feet.\n34:35 Comment: Well, he didn't. He didn't lunge with two feet.\n34:39 Comment: That's the one-block mark for West Ham today,\n34:41 Comment: but can they survive that?\n34:44 Comment: Falcao for Chelsea as they find a late leveller against Crystal Palace.\n34:49 Comment: Incredibly, that is West Ham's sixth red card this season alone.\n34:55 Comment: Hooked in by Moreno, away by Reid.\n34:59 Comment: Sixth in ten games between the Europa League and the Premier League.\n35:2 Comment: And of course, that will mean another suspension.\n35:9 Comment: In the fourth, but won't be unsäº«ed.\n35:11 Comment: Let's look at it carefully.\n35:17 Comment: And John Ward.\n35:19 Comment: What about that for a response from Crystal Palace?\n35:21 Comment: Incredible.\n35:22 Comment: You took care of a team that's good at counterattack\n35:24 Comment: and that's Crystal Palace with the pace they have\n35:25 Comment: and they've obviously made Chelsea play.\n35:28 Comment: But obviously, Nak,\n35:29 Comment: has been levelled up with the two sendings off.\n35:32 Comment: But the one player you didn't want to go for West Ham\n35:34 Comment: is Martyn Noble because of the fact\n35:35 Comment: that he'd be chatting and the captain ÑÐ¼\n35:38 Comment: Manoel Lanzini, the youngster whose goal got it all going so positively for West Ham here today.\n35:44 Comment: A day that he'll remember for a long, long time.\n35:56 Comment: I was about to say the 11 that's out there, but the 10 that's out there now is about to get even younger, of course.\n36:2 Comment: This highly talented and highly talented 16-year-old, Rhys Oxford.\n36:6 Comment: He earned rave reviews for his display at the Emirates on the opening day.\n36:10 Comment: The last game didn't go quite so well when he was taken off at half-time.\n36:14 Comment: He didn't feature in the squad for Bournemouth.\n36:18 Comment: Guess what position he's going to play in the closing stages here.\n36:22 Comment: The instruction should be just sit in front of that back four.\n36:25 Comment: Don't go chasing unless you've got a definite chance of making the pass or the ball.\n36:36 Comment: It's going to have to be a very, very late, late show here.\n36:43 Comment: Liverpool are to rescue their unbeaten starter this season.\n36:49 Comment: A country that hasn't looked likely.\n36:52 Comment: It's still time.\n36:54 Comment: Eib.\n36:58 Comment: Eib with the ball back towards the near post.\n37:1 Comment: Still alive for Milner.\n37:4 Comment: I'm looking at a bonnet.\n37:6 Comment: Milner there.\n37:7 Comment: He's in the left-back slot.\n37:8 Comment: Get to centre-back.\n37:9 Comment: Don't get involved with chasing anyone out in them areas.\n37:11 Comment: And he's bailed out by Obiang, who's been terrific today.\n37:14 Comment: Here's Clyne, and Obiang gets another foot in.\n37:19 Comment: Milner sets it there for Eib.\n37:21 Comment: Checks back again, and Obiang there once more.\n37:25 Comment: You should be loving this as a defender now.\n37:27 Comment: You'd have done this in training, day in, day out.\n37:29 Comment: Attack v defence.\n37:30 Comment: Just try and break us down.\n37:31 Comment: Start in good positions.\n37:32 Comment: Don't be dragged about, and that ball will come to you.\n37:36 Comment: Obiang worked under Tjero Ferrara and Sinisa Mihailovic\n37:39 Comment: amongst these managers at Sampdoria.\n37:41 Comment: They picked up a defensive thing or two from them, no doubt.\n37:45 Comment: Here's Milner onto the penalties.\n37:47 Comment: But Benteke wins the header, and the chance was there for Lovren.\n37:51 Comment: What an opportunity.\n37:55 Comment: So well, Benteke.\n37:56 Comment: Got up early.\n37:57 Comment: Good header down.\n38:0 Comment: Lovren's got to be scoring there.\n38:6 Comment: Well, Benteke will feel he did his bit.\n38:16 Comment: And Darren Randolph, as we were saying in the first half,\n38:20 Comment: made his Charlton debut, just turned 20 here.\n38:26 Comment: That's a separate, triumphant Anfield return.\n38:31 Comment: It'd be great if he does.\n38:32 Comment: Because obviously he comes into the team,\n38:34 Comment: plays against Bournemouth,\n38:35 Comment: and his defenders really let him down.\n38:37 Comment: He's seen as a goalkeeper he's letting for him.\n38:39 Comment: But as we said earlier, he made some fantastic stays in the game.\n38:42 Comment: And I would say today he's been relatively quiet.\n38:44 Comment: You wouldn't have expected that.\n38:47 Comment: Looking to catch the eye of...\n38:49 Comment: ...Roy Keane as well.\n38:52 Comment: It's forward by O'Bunner.\n38:55 Comment: A low-end-time player there.\n38:58 Comment: Lovren.\n39:1 Comment: Hands with the flick on.\n39:3 Comment: You have to say,\n39:4 Comment: even though they've gone down to ten,\n39:6 Comment: West Ham, in their own half,\n39:7 Comment: have made this Anfield pitch look quite tight today.\n39:10 Comment: They have.\n39:11 Comment: They'll be delighted with their distances between each player in the back four\n39:14 Comment: and then the distances between the units to the midfield.\n39:17 Comment: Very little space for Liverpool to get into.\n39:21 Comment: It looks like he's gone through the wringer today.\n39:23 Comment: He has done for the last few weeks, of course.\n39:25 Comment: The ups and downs of being a football manager,\n39:27 Comment: as Brendan Rodgers would testify.\n39:30 Comment: Yes.\n39:31 Comment: Brendan Rodgers has had a great start to the season.\n39:32 Comment: You wonder whether or not the criticism will be there.\n39:34 Comment: I think it will come again now,\n39:35 Comment: because this is certainly a game that Liverpool...\n39:38 Comment: ...Faith would expect with three points.\n39:42 Comment: Lovren, the outside of the right boot.\n39:45 Comment: It's been a tough day for Benteke.\n39:47 Comment: He's kept it in play, has he?\n39:51 Comment: He's fought for everything he's been given,\n39:53 Comment: but in terms of the quantity of service that's come his way,\n39:56 Comment: it's been lacking today.\n39:59 Comment: Sacco's touch.\n40:1 Comment: He's got his play.\n40:2 Comment: He's got to tie it.\n40:4 Comment: And tapping backwards, Danny Ings.\n40:7 Comment: And now he's got to be carded.\n40:20 Comment: I don't think Kevin Friend will be walking off this pitch\n40:22 Comment: as an either-side friend today.\n40:25 Comment: I reckon he'll get a couple of hugs off of the West Ham players\n40:28 Comment: if they continue to see out this game 2-0,\n40:30 Comment: but...\n40:31 Comment: It will be looked at again, the sending off,\n40:33 Comment: certainly of Mark Noble, because it doesn't look like one.\n40:37 Comment: Definitely a foul by Ings.\n40:54 Comment: I mentioned the phrase, game management.\n40:57 Comment: I wanted to do a disservice to Dimitri Payet, but...\n40:59 Comment: ...he now is excited.\n41:0 Comment: He knows exactly how long is left in this game.\n41:6 Comment: Chris London-Village, the ex-Everton player.\n41:8 Comment: This will be a sweet one today if they see it through now.\n41:13 Comment: Some of the West Ham fans are still...\n41:15 Comment: It looks like they're praying there.\n41:17 Comment: They'll be delighted with this.\n41:18 Comment: You should have come up here...\n41:21 Comment: ...obviously for your love of your team, your club,\n41:23 Comment: but not really expecting anything.\n41:24 Comment: Certainly how they played over the last two games\n41:27 Comment: in comparison to how Liverpool have played.\n41:30 Comment: So it will be something that they'll be absolutely delighted about now.\n41:36 Comment: Some of the home supporters seem to think the game is up today.\n41:45 Comment: Doesn't look like it's lasting damage for Dimitri Payet.\n41:49 Comment: And Matt Jarvis, who you suggest we might see at some point today,\n41:52 Comment: will be on for the closing minutes here.\n42:0 Comment: armas\n42:7 Comment: He'll be wishing these seconds away now.\n42:13 Comment: What a performance Eastside has put in today.\n42:15 Comment: And no doubt helped by...\n42:17 Comment: ...the early goal. Getting the early goal...\n42:18 Comment: ...when maybe you're a little bit fragile\n42:20 Comment: coming off the back of two poor defeats\n42:22 Comment: and lots of goals conceded in those two games.\n42:24 Comment: Well, that was obviously vital.\n42:27 Comment: Now, without a doubt,\n42:28 Comment: and what it gives you...\n42:29 Comment: is just something to hold on to defensively.\n42:31 Comment: They knew they'd have been under a lot of pressure,\n42:33 Comment: but it just changed the dynamic.\n42:35 Comment: And strangely enough, the Liverpool players seem to panic\n42:38 Comment: much more so than you would expect.\n42:40 Comment: It can happen you can go a goal down.\n42:41 Comment: Because they haven't conceded all season,\n42:44 Comment: they just didn't deal with it well enough.\n42:45 Comment: And we said, listen, keep it tight, but they didn't.\n42:47 Comment: And invariably a second goal came along.\n42:50 Comment: It was always going to be difficult to try and break them down then,\n42:52 Comment: but it just gave them something to hold on to.\n42:54 Comment: And they have done it very well,\n42:56 Comment: because as we said, Randolph hasn't had that much to do.\n42:59 Comment: And they're always about to be robbed here by Sacco.\n43:4 Comment: This to seal it.\n43:5 Comment: And the whistle had gone.\n43:18 Comment: Confirming that change, Dimitri Payet.\n43:21 Comment: Going off with Matt Jarvis coming on.\n43:26 Comment: For Brendan Rodgers, back to the drawing board now\n43:28 Comment: of the international draft.\n43:29 Comment: ications profile.\n43:31 Comment: And we'll be right back after the break.\n43:42 Comment: Breaks Remain.\n43:48 Comment: Then and then it can stop each time.\n43:51 Comment: The ball to the far side, Jarvis can he get there? Not quite.\n44:12 Comment: That was the perfect out ball for these closing minutes, Matt Jarvis.\n44:21 Comment: He did. Loads of pace, I'm not quite sure if he's lost a bit because of the injuries he's had recently, but he'll definitely give you that out there.\n44:29 Comment: He was unlucky last season, didn't feature a hole up because of injury.\n44:33 Comment: Lucas pushing forward, then taking with the lay off.\n44:39 Comment: Have they been, if you base it solely on the amount of work that Darren Randolph has had to do today, which hasn't been a whole lot,\n44:46 Comment: have they been devoid of ideas or a plan B today? He has shuffled it around, he's changed formations, Brendan Rodgers, he's changed personnel,\n44:53 Comment: but nothing seems to have worked for Liverpool today.\n44:56 Comment: No, when they went to a three, it didn't seem as if it was something they worked particularly well on it,\n45:2 Comment: because people seem to be doing things off the cuff, and that's such an important system.\n45:6 Comment: There's got to be good timings of people running wide,\n45:9 Comment: running long, and they didn't seem to have it.\n45:12 Comment: I think West Ham have been reasonably comfortable in all their formations that they faced against Liverpool today.\n45:16 Comment: They denied the space, and they've been fully deserving so far of this win.\n45:29 Comment: Oxford happy to stand off against Clyne, that's good from Cresswell.\n45:35 Comment: Looking to drive on here, Clyne, Brodie could nick it.\n45:39 Comment: And that's exactly what Slavan Bilic will want from Aaron Cresswell,\n45:42 Comment: if you can't take it to the corner flag, then win yourself the free kick.\n45:46 Comment: Too many of them silly fouls by Liverpool players.\n45:49 Comment: Cresswell's not really going anywhere, they've got numbers back, and to dive in like that is poor.\n45:55 Comment: It's a fifth yellow card for Liverpool players today, they include two for Coutinho.\n46:9 Comment: Liverpool, Liverpool, Liverpool!\n46:12 Comment: Seven minutes to be added on, so not done just yet Liverpool, but they need to, and that's only for a draw.\n46:19 Comment: Mightn't even get them that, because here's Sacco, and there is the third,\n46:23 Comment: and that completes a remarkable day for West Ham.\n46:28 Comment: Incredible.\n46:30 Comment: I think even with seven minutes remaining, I think they know that that is the final blow to Liverpool.\n46:36 Comment: What an incredible day for West Ham.\n46:39 Comment: We talked about them being low in confidence and how goals change games, they do, certainly they do.\n46:46 Comment: But even though they were 2-0 up, there were times they could have gone 3-4,\n46:49 Comment: but now to get the third goal, what an incredible result.\n46:55 Comment: He's been in the headlines for all the wrong reasons this week.\n46:57 Comment: This will make some positive ones though for Diapra Sacco.\n47:2 Comment: Held off the defence, the ricochet off Moreno was kind to him.\n47:6 Comment: And then he just waltzed forward and left-footed through the legs of Skirtle, beyond Mignolet.\n47:12 Comment: Liverpool nil, West Ham three.\n47:14 Comment: That's incredible defending by the Liverpool defence.\n47:16 Comment: We've been...\n47:19 Comment: praising them, how they've looked solid all season, but as soon as the game opens up\n47:23 Comment: and there's space for the opposition to play into, these players have been fan-wanting like they were last year.\n47:31 Comment: And all the questions are going to resurface surrounding Brendan Rodgers and Liverpool again, nil.\n47:36 Comment: It is one game and that Liverpool manager will be helping.\n47:41 Comment: And that will be as bad as it gets this season.\n47:45 Comment: But there is that confidence question, nil.\n47:49 Comment: Interesting, yeah, to see how they react.\n47:51 Comment: Obviously a lot of these players will go away with their international teams\n47:54 Comment: and he'll want to do the work on a training ground, but he won't be able to.\n47:58 Comment: As soon as we get him breaking play, we'll get you a man of the match, Gary.\n48:1 Comment: And we've got that now, so...\n48:3 Comment: Well, I think a lot of the West Ham players can take...\n48:6 Comment: big credit in how they performed today.\n48:8 Comment: I think Tompkins has done fantastically well at right-back.\n48:11 Comment: I thought that might be vulnerable, especially against the likes of Coutinho,\n48:14 Comment: but no, he's dealt with it.\n48:16 Comment: Mark Noble was fantastic as a captain, obviously the sending off is harsh,\n48:20 Comment: but I think he was brilliant at cajoling everyone.\n48:22 Comment: But if you go away to Anfield, up against a big-money signing like Benteke,\n48:26 Comment: and the free-flowing football that you associate with Coutinho, you've got to defend well.\n48:30 Comment: And I think the man who's been a rock solid at the back today is my man of the match,\n48:33 Comment: and that's Winston Reid.\n48:35 Comment: He has not put a foot wrong today for Savan Bilic,\n48:37 Comment: and an ex-Center-back, of course, will appreciate Reid's performance today.\n48:40 Comment: He is Gary Breen's choice as the MSL Motor Group top performer today, Winston Reid.\n48:48 Comment: What an occasion to find that performance in.\n48:51 Comment: 3-0 at Anfield.\n48:53 Comment: And these West Ham supporters, especially those of an older vintage\n48:56 Comment: who've been coming here year on year and leaving disappointed.\n49:0 Comment: How they will revel in this one.\n49:5 Comment: We will love, we will love, we will love, we will love...\n49:8 Comment: We won four as the chant from the West Ham supporters now.\n49:13 Comment: Jarvis happy just to play a little bit of keep ball.\n49:21 Comment: Haven't even had seven minutes added on.\n49:24 Comment: Liverpool haven't looked like scoring, have they?\n49:26 Comment: No, we can only associate the chances that they've had\n49:29 Comment: and how hard Randolph has had to work on the goal, and he's had no saves to make.\n49:33 Comment: And maybe now it's Ings.\n49:34 Comment: To get his shot away.\n49:36 Comment: And again, West Ham working hard.\n49:38 Comment: Oxford and O'Bonna blocking his route to goal.\n49:44 Comment: Clyde.\n49:49 Comment: Milner now.\n49:50 Comment: Looking for that little ball in behind Cresswell, and he will see it out.\n49:54 Comment: In front of a rapidly emptying Kop.\n49:57 Comment: How often you'd see that.\n50:0 Comment: I think Cresswell will be happy.\n50:2 Comment: He's looked at a far better time.\n50:4 Comment: He's a better player today than he has over the last couple of games.\n50:7 Comment: More like the player we associated with him last year.\n50:10 Comment: But you're right, Anfield, there's loads of empty seats at the moment.\n50:14 Comment: FANS ROAR\n50:18 Comment: What is it with West Ham?\n50:19 Comment: The last couple of seasons they've either been good second half and poor first, or vice versa.\n50:25 Comment: Especially the opening four games, they've been both of those.\n50:28 Comment: The highs and the lows.\n50:30 Comment: And the Afrosaco will go off to a huge ovation here.\n50:34 Comment: What a great moment for the teenager coming on.\n50:37 Comment: It's Josh Cullen.\n50:39 Comment: Republic of Ireland's under-19 international.\n50:43 Comment: To make his Premier League debut here.\n50:46 Comment: What a chance to do it.\n50:48 Comment: 3-0 up for Anfield.\n50:50 Comment: Even if he goes on to have a long, successful career, these type of results won't be commonplace, that's for certain.\n50:58 Comment: I think, come on, he just want a touch now, won't he?\n51:1 Comment: He might be desperate, he's full of running and everything.\n51:4 Comment: He might break for him here and he does get his touch.\n51:10 Comment: He's taking no chances.\n51:12 Comment: If I'm playing centre-back and he's done that, I'd be delighted.\n51:16 Comment: That's what you call a safety first with your first touch.\n51:18 Comment: 3-0 up.\n51:20 Comment: With less than a minute to go.\n51:24 Comment:

    "summary": "Liverpool 0 - 3 West Ham: In-Depth Match Report\n\nThe much-anticipated Premier League clash between Liverpool and West Ham commenced amidst a wave of expectations, with both teams keen to stage a memorable performance. Liverpool was striving to maintain their positive momentum following recent victories, while West Ham aimed to secure their first league win at Anfield since 1963.\n\nThe match started with palpable energy from both sides. Eager to prove themselves, each team set out to dominate from the opening whistle. Liverpool was looking to continue their strong start to the season, bolstered by manager Brendan Rodgers' assertions of renewed hunger and drive within the team. This newfound fervor had been credited in part to the influx of new players who had invigorated the squad.\n\nHowever, it was West Ham who struck first, shattering Liverpool's defensive confidence early on. In just the 3rd minute, Manuel Lanzini etched his name into West Ham folklore with a determined strike that set the tone for the rest of the match. The goal materialized following a scrappy piece of defending from Liverpool, particularly Nathaniel Clyne and Joe Gomez. Despite their efforts to block and clear, Lanzini seized the moment and slotted the ball past Simon Mignolet from close range.\n\nThis early goal was a significant test for Liverpool's character, a challenge to their resilience shown in the first few games of the season. As the first half progressed, Liverpool aimed to find their footing and impose themselves on the game. James Milner and Emre Can were energetic, working the midfield to try and create openings. Roberto Firmino and Philippe Coutinho, operating just behind Christian Benteke, were expected to spark the offensive play. Yet, West Ham's defensive discipline and strategic organization stifled Liverpool's efforts.\n\nAmid Liverpool's attempts to recover, their backline faced ongoing pressure. Dejan Lovren, who had been showing signs of redemption this season, found himself particularly challenged. Fans watched as he attempted a risky maneuver in the left-back position, which spectacularly backfired. In the 29th minute, Lovren's ill-advised decision to take on West Ham's attackers led to him losing possession near the touchline, a mistake that Lanzini exploited proficiently. Lanzini squared the ball, and despite an initial defensive clearance, the ever-composed Mark Noble arrived to calmly side-foot the ball into the net, making it 2-0 for the visitors.\n\nThe two-goal deficit profoundly impacted Liverpool, and the once-boisterous Anfield crowd fell silent. The rest of the first half witnessed a slew of attempts by Liverpool to break through the resolute West Ham defense, but their efforts lacked the decisive touch. Coutinho and Firmino's creativity in the final third were repeatedly quashed by well-timed blocks and tackles from West Ham's defensive duo of Winston Reid and Angelo Ogbonna. The half-time whistle blew, leaving Liverpool supporters anxious about their team's uphill task.\n\nThe second half saw Brendan Rodgers make tactical adjustments, introducing Alberto Moreno in place of Joe Gomez. This switch aimed to exploit Morenoâs attacking prowess from the left wing-back position, hoping it would provide the necessary width and service for Benteke. Liverpool briefly showed signs of improvement, with Moreno frequently making forays down the left flank. However, West Ham maintained their shape and composure, effectively neutralizing these threats.\n\nThe game took another dramatic turn just before the hour mark. Philippe Coutinho, already on a yellow card, committed a clumsy foul on Dimitri Payet. Referee Kevin Friend deemed the challenge worthy of a second booking, resulting in Coutinho's dismissal. This reduced Liverpool to ten men and significantly hampered their chances of mounting a comeback. The Brazilianâs exit not only diminished Liverpoolâs attacking potency but also left a gaping creative void in their midfield.\n\nThe man-down situation forced Liverpool into desperate measures. Danny Ings was introduced to provide additional attacking impetus, replacing the subdued Firmino. Ings immediately showcased his work ethic and tenacity, but West Hamâs defense remained steadfast. The Hammers capitalized on their numerical advantage, controlling the tempo and frustrating Liverpool's attempts to regain control.\n\nAs the game entered its final quarter, both teams were reduced to ten men. Mark Nobleâs unfortunate lunge after conceding a foul saw him receive a straight red card, a decision that puzzled many. Although West Ham was now numerically equal, they continued to execute their defensive strategy with discipline, effectively shutting down Liverpoolâs attacks.\n\nIn the dying minutes of the match, West Ham inflicted the final blow. As Liverpool pushed forward in desperate search of a lifeline, Sadio Mane's careless pass allowed Diafra Sakho to pounce. Sakho burst forward, evading challenges and coolly slotting the ball past Mignolet, making it 3-0. This goal sealed the fate of the match and highlighted the defensive frailties that had plagued Liverpool throughout the game.\n\nWinston Reid, pivotal in thwarting Liverpool's attacking endeavors, stood resolute in defense and earned the accolade of Man of the Match. His aerial dominance, coupled with impeccable timing in tackles, epitomized West Hamâs defensive masterclass. Supported ably by Ogbonna and the tireless efforts of players like Lanzini and Payet, Reid ensured West Ham left Anfield with a clean sheet and a historic victory.\n\nFor Liverpool, the match was a harsh reminder of the vulnerabilities that still linger within the squad. The international break provided a timely pause for introspection and rectification of the issues that marred their performance. Brendan Rodgers' strategic decisions and the team's defensive lapses would come under scrutiny, raising questions about their adaptability under pressure and consistency against varied opposition.\n\nIn conclusion, West Ham's 3-0 victory over Liverpool was a testament to their tactical astuteness, resilience, and clinical finishing. It marked their first league win at Anfield in over half a century and sent a strong message to the rest of the Premier League. For Liverpool, it was a day of reckoning, an opportunity to reassess and strengthen their resolve as they aimed to bounce back in the weeks to come. The match encapsulated the unpredictable and thrilling nature of Premier League football, where fortunes can shift dramatically, and history can be rewritten on any given day."
