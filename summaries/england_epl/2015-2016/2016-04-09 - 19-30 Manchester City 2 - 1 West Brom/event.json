The excitement was palpable, and the pace was set from the start. However, the early stages of the game were somewhat interrupted by the ball constantly going out of play. Within the first two minutes, the ball had already gone out multiple times, setting a slightly fragmented tone.\n\nAt the 47-second mark, Manchester City earned a corner, their first set-piece opportunity.

The crowd erupted in celebration as Manchester City players hugged and celebrated a well-deserved goal.\n\nFollowing the goal, West had to respond and went on the offensive.
