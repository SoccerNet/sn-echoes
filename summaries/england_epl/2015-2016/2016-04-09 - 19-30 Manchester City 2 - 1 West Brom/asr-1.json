originates there but then City are very passive in defense.\n5:36 Comment: And I believe that the goalkeeper is also responsible because the ball enters through his stick.\n5:40 Comment: Let's see what could have confused him if KOLAROV blocked him in the shot.\n5:45 Comment: But JOE HART did something very strange because he didn't seem too dangerous either.\n5:50 Comment: shot of

the ball falls to Kun Agüero.\n8:11 Comment: Mangala, Otamendi.\n8:17 Comment: The Argentine is looking for a partner, he finds his compatriot Pablo Zabaleta.\n8:21 Comment: That's where Beraino's pressure begins.\n8:25 Comment: Otamendi delays for Jouhard.\n8:29 Comment: Westbrook is the second least scoring team in the Premier.\n8:33 Comment: Just ahead of Lastonvila, the bottom player.\n8:39 Comment: And with today's goal he already surpasses Watford, which was tied at 30 goals.\n8:43 Comment: There is a mistake now, committed by Mangala on Beraino.\n8:51 Comment: We see the action, Mangala's grab for Salomón Rondón.\n8:57 Comment: The referee's assistant marked it.\n9:2 Comment: City entered the game very cold.\n9:4 Comment: Yes, getting infected from the environment. The stadium is not full, it has been raining for a long time and it hasn't gotten in yet.\n9:11 Comment: And be careful with set pieces, as we have already said that Westbrook are specialists and if they scored a second goal they would make the comeback very difficult.\n9:17 Comment: And losing today is a very serious blow for City.\n9:21 Comment: The scorer of the goal, Sessegnon, prepares.\n9:26 Comment: There goes the shot, ball to the far post.\n9:28 Comment: Center back Macaulay was about to finish the ball.\n9:33 Comment: He looked for the second post.\n9:36 Comment: There we see how Boni's back wins.\n9:39 Comment: Take out the outside of your right leg.\n9:42 Comment: Note that if he tried it with his left foot, I think he would have more room.\n9:45 Comment: The bounce of the ball also hurts him because, being on the field, it goes faster than expected, possibly.\n9:51 Comment: Pellegrini withstanding the downpour and never better said with this goal from Westbrook in the first minutes of the game.\n10:3 Comment: Nasri doubles Kolarov.\n10:6 Comment: There the side receives, puts the ball into the area, Boni does not arrive.\n10:9 Comment: Chester has to throw the ball out to avoid the City striker's shot.\n10:17 Comment: We see again the action of Nasri, the center of Kolarov.\n10:21 Comment: Boni is about to arrive and just in case Chester sends the ball wide.\n10:25 Comment: Good climb from Kolarov.\n10:30 Comment: He is charging a lot of play on City's left wing at the start of the game.\n10:35 Comment: Nasri, ball to the penalty spot.\n10:38 Comment: Fernando tried the header.\n10:42 Comment: Evans finally played.\n10:44 Comment: There will be a corner kick again for the locals.\n10:51 Comment: Nasri prepares again.\n11:5 Comment: Hit the Frenchman.\n11:6 Comment: Now he looked for Otamendi's shot.\n11:8 Comment: Kun Agüero did not arrive at the far post.\n11:11 Comment: He cleared the Westbrook defense again.\n11:14 Comment: And there will be another corner kick for Manchester City.\n11:21 Comment: In the second half, to the right, with a rebound from Kolarov.\n11:25 Comment: We see Nico Otamendi.\n11:29 Comment: He looked for the shot in the previous corner at the near post.\n11:36 Comment: Chased by Dawson.\n11:41 Comment: The referee approached to check the situation of the ball.\n11:47 Comment: And there

Brom's star signing without a doubt this season.\n12:21 Comment: There's Tony Pulis.\n12:26 Comment: Venezuelan forward who arrived from Zenit Saint Petersburg.\n12:31 Comment: He has seven goals this season in the Premier.\n12:33 Comment: It seems that Salomón Rondón is recovering.\n12:42 Comment: The note for the Bagui team.\n12:46 Comment: Evans.\n12:49 Comment: Sandro comes to receive.\n12:51 Comment: Dawson's touch.\n12:58 Comment: Sandro plays back with Evans.\n13:1 Comment: That's where City's pressure begins.\n13:4 Comment: And the center back that combines with Foster.\n13:11 Comment: The ball will be protected by Kolarov before the arrival of Sessegnon.\n13:15 Comment: Joe Hart plays.\n13:18 Comment: Bonnie head.\n13:19 Comment: The forward slipped away.\n13:21 Comment: Take the ball Fletcher.\n13:24 Comment: The combination with Rondón, Beraino.\n13:29 Comment: There's McLean facing Zabaleta.\n13:31 Comment: It goes outside.\n13:32 Comment: Point the center to the Irish.\n13:33 Comment: He hit the ball on City's right side.\n13:36 Comment: The team is still very cold.\n13:39 Comment: The lack of football in the middle is something we have been seeing for a long time at Manchester City.\n13:44 Comment: Not just this season.\n13:45 Comment: And I imagine that it will be one of the first things that Guardiola will correct.\n13:49 Comment: Today the Fernandino team has fallen.\n13:51 Comment: Fabian has entered.\n13:51 Comment: Van Delft.\n13:52 Comment: Which is actually more of the same.\n13:53 Comment: He is a midfielder with good physique but poor ball handling.\n13:59 Comment: And therefore the team today, without Silva, also has a hard time creating football.\n14:5 Comment: Silva who will surely be in trouble to try to reach that momentous appointment on Tuesday.\n14:14 Comment: In front of Laurent Blanc's team.\n14:17 Comment: With that 2-2 from the first leg.\n14:20 Comment: It's going to be a historic occasion.\n14:21 Comment: From City.\n14:23 Comment: To get into the Champions League semi-finals.\n14:29 Comment: Joe Hart plays for Nico Tamendi.\n14:37 Comment: Zabaleta.\n14:39 Comment: He went along that right side looking for the position of his compatriot Kun Agüero.\n14:46 Comment: Ball has gone out.\n14:47 Comment: It will be for the visitors.\n14:51 Comment: West Brom who have won four games away from their stadium

Fernando playing with Fabian Delft.\n16:31 Comment: Ball to Nasri.\n16:33 Comment: The short touch with Kun Agüero.\n16:37 Comment: Now Delft also appears, changing the game to the right.\n16:42 Comment: Skip McLean.\n16:44 Comment: Send the ball out.\n16:45 Comment: The ball.\n16:49 Comment: There you see Xisus Navas.\n16:50 Comment: The ball.\n16:52 Comment: Zabaleta for the Andalusian.\n16:55 Comment: The ball.\n16:56 Comment: Delft.\n16:57 Comment: Little by little West Brom is retreating.\n16:59 Comment: West Brom.\n17:0 Comment: And it is difficult for Pellegrini's team to find the spaces.\n17:4 Comment: It was at a very slow pace.\n17:5 Comment: There are few unchecks in front of the ball and the team plays at a level, at a very slow pace.\n17:11 Comment: Agüero's touch.\n17:13 Comment: Be careful, the Argentine has been hurt.\n17:14 Comment: Kolarov arrives.\n17:15 Comment: Enter Neares.\n17:16 Comment: He goes to the ground.\n17:16 Comment: We'll see.\n17:17 Comment: Let's see why the referee seems to have called the action of the West Brom defender, from Sessegnon.\n17:28 Comment: He didn't give a penalty, right? He was going backwards, but I saw him point to the penalty spot.\n17:31 Comment: Yes, it seems that Sessegnon's tackle on Kolarov gave him a penalty, but he misled us because he went to look at Kun Agüero.\n17:41 Comment: And we see again the fall of Alexander Kolarov inside the area.\n17:44 Comment: It doesn't look good here, but I do think it's on his left foot, in his attempt to defend.\n17:51 Comment: Sessegnon the scorer of the goal who committed that maximum penalty and also Kun Agüero who prepares the ball for the shot.\n18:0 Comment: We see the statistics of penalty shots. Kun Agüero has only scored one this season.\n18:7 Comment: There goes the Argentine, right leg, goal!\n18:9 Comment: Agüero goal that ties the game! Minute 19.\n18:13 Comment: From 11 meters, equal to Manchester City's contest, Kun Agüero scored, who was one goal away from entering the top 10 of City's top scorers.\n18:27 Comment: His 18th goal of the season.\n18:30 Comment: We have seen in the previous graph where he usually throws it, if it was that gap, Foster also sensed it well, he was almost there, but he cornered it very well.\n18:40 Comment: Good penalty shot by Kun.\n18:43 Comment: They tied the game on Manchester City's first chance, so they haven't played completely isolated.\n18:49 Comment: Well, that Kun Agüero statistic that continues to increase is now 96 goals in the Premier, 130 in total with the City shirt.\n18:59 Comment: And as we say, he enters the top 10 of Club Celeste's top scorers.\n19:5 Comment: Ball behind Navas.\n19:9 Comment: Kolarov who was the player who caused that maximum penalty.\n19:13 Comment: The next one that Sergio Agüero has transformed.\n19:18 Comment: Now Navas cannot receive.\n19:21 Comment: Beraino tries to protect the ball, manages to connect with Rondón.\n19:24 Comment: Beraino again.\n19:25 Comment: Receive Fletcher.\n19:27 Comment: The Scotsman relies on Sessegnon.\n19:29 Comment: Good opening now for Dawson's rise.\n19:33 Comment: The loose ball, attention to Sessegnon.\n19:35 Comment: It fell on him.\n19:37 Comment: Fernando jumps Otamendi, Boni controls.\n19:41 Comment: Now look for the exit with speed.\n19:44 Comment: The City.\n19:44 Comment: Kolarov.\n19:46 Comment: He has to stop because he can't find any unmarked teammate.\n19:52 Comment: Delft for Agüero.\n19:55 Comment: It seemed that he had been injured just in the action prior to the penalty.\n19:59 Comment: Kun Agüero and the alarms went off at City.\n20:4 Comment: Taking into account the proximity of the Champions League match.\n20:9 Comment: Pay attention to Nasri, he feinted with the long shot.\n20:11 Comment: Now the Frenchman tries it.\n20:13 Comment: The rejected ball.\n20:13 Comment: For Zabaleta.\n20:17 Comment: Navas.\n20:18 Comment: Now Nasri appearing on the right.\n20:21 Comment: He stuck his leg into Chester.\n20:24 Comment: Nasri protests but it's a ball for West Brom.\n20:33 Comment: There is.\n20:36 Comment: Let's see that Rondón can't continue.\n20:39 Comment: The Venezuelan who is going to leave the field injured.\n20:43 Comment: Garner was going to enter with the number 8 number.\n20:46 Comment: Important setback for West Brom with Rondón's injury.\n20:49 Comment: Yes, because it gave him a lot to try to send long balls.\n20:53 Comment: Surely Veraíno will now become the first striker.\n20:56 Comment: And Garner either plays from behind or goes to the right wing and stands at the midpoint.\n21:3 Comment: There he played precisely against Sunderland on that right wing Garner.\n21:8 Comment: And a very important loss for West Brom.\n21:11 Comment: Well.\n21:13 Comment: For the moment he remains in the midfield.\n21:14 Comment: Garner who has a problem in his head.\n21:17 Comment: A blow in the last game.\n21:19 Comment: And it was pointed out and continues on the right.\n21:22 Comment: First with the goal conceded by Tony Pulis' team.\n21:27 Comment: Kun Agüero's penalty goal.\n21:28 Comment: And then Rondón's injury.\n21:30 Comment: Two very important setbacks for the visiting team.\n21:37 Comment: Evans is going to put the ball in play.\n21:43 Comment: And that's it.\n21:48 Comment: Let's go to Macaulay who has positioned himself practically as a striker in this set-piece action.\n21:54 Comment: Ball up.\n21:55 Comment: Watch out for Kolarov's jump.\n21:56 Comment: Dawson arrives.\n21:58 Comment: Try to prevent the ball from coming out.\n22:0 Comment: Put the center on the side.\n22:2 Comment: He had crossed the line.\n22:4 Comment: Indicates a corner kick to the referee.\n22:8 Comment: Ball for West Brom.\n22:9 Comment: And that's it.\n22:12 Comment: Let's go to Craig Dawson, the right back.\n22:20 Comment: It hasn't stopped raining for a single moment, for quite a few minutes before the game started.\n22:26 Comment: With a pitch, he cut Delft, Navas.\n22:31 Comment: Fabian Delft runs, he has a field ahead of him.\n22:33 Comment: Attention to City's departure, Fabian Delft raises his head.\n22:36 Comment: He relies on Kun Agüero.\n22:38 Comment: Good control from the Argentine.\n22:39 Comment: Ahead to McLean.\n22:43 Comment: Agüero continues.\n22:45 Comment: Leave for Kolarov.\n22:47 Comment: Kolarov who feints with the shot.\n22:49 Comment: The shot goes over Foster's goal.\n22:52 Comment: He even touched the Westbrook goalkeeper.\n22:54 Comment: Corner hug, fans applaud the Serbian with that shot.\n23:0 Comment: From the front, Alexander Kolarov is about to score.\n23:4 Comment: Well, very important Kolarov in the team.\n23:5 Comment: I still can't explain it when Pellegrini chooses Clichy instead.\n23:9 Comment: Because I think Kolarov, more or less in defense, is at the same level.\n23:12 Comment: And in attack he contributes much more.\n23:15 Comment: We have seen how he has taken his team's first shot before.\n23:18 Comment: He forced the penalty.\n23:19 Comment: And now this occasion.\n23:22 Comment: Now cast Nari.\n23:23 Comment: The ball up.\n23:24 Comment: Mangala's auction.\n23:27 Comment: Point to surprise Foster.\n23:29 Comment: There we see the French central defender.\n23:33 Comment: Mesa struggles with Westbrook's defense.\n23:36 Comment: Nari's finish.\n23:38 Comment: He anticipates McCauley well.\n23:40 Comment: It is not easy to beat the Westbrook center back with a ball from above.\n23:45 Comment: Mangala has not yet debuted as a scorer this season.\n23:50 Comment: In the Premier.\n23:51 Comment: And there he has had a good opportunity to do so.\n23:55 Comment: Pellegrini now seated.\n23:59 Comment: Maybe calmer after the equalizer.\n24:3 Comment: The team is slowly reacting.\n24:8 Comment: After a very apathetic start to the meeting.\n24:12 Comment: Delft.\n24:14 Comment: Inside he plays for Agüero.\n24:16 Comment: McLean throws it on him.\n24:18 Comment: Sandro plays back for Evans.\n24:21 Comment:

    "summary": "In an exhilarating clash at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester City took on West Bromwich Albion in what turned into a nail-biting match ending with a scoreline of 2-1 in favor of the home team.\n\nThe game commenced under the heavy rain that showered down on the Etihad Stadium, setting a dramatic stage for this high-stakes encounter. Despite the slippery conditions, both teams were off to a fierce start. West Brom, led by Tony Pulis, had notoriously struggled against City in their past eight encounters, and they came into this match hoping to reverse their fortunes. From the outset, Manchester City sought to dominate possession, but it was West Brom who drew first blood.\n\nWest Brom's steadfast approach to the game bore fruit early. In the 6th minute, a well-executed recovery in midfield caught City off guard. The ball found its way to Stephane Sessegnon, who advanced with intent and unleashed a powerful strike from the edge of the box. Joe Hart, the City keeper, was left flat-footed as the ball rocketed into the back of the net, bringing the scoreline to 0-1. Sessegnon's goal brought surprise and concern among the City faithful, who watched in disbelief as their team went a goal down.\n\nThe early setback prompted City to increase their offensive efforts. Both Nasri and Kolarov were instrumental in driving the attack forward. The persistent rain made the footing precarious, causing slips and missed opportunities, yet City endeavored to string passes together and create openings. From corners to direct shots, attempts by City came close but were consistently thwarted by an organized West Brom defense and a vigilant Ben Foster in goal.\n\nA turning point arrived in the 18th minute when City was awarded a penalty. A swift attacking move saw Kolarov brought down in the box by Sessegnon, with the referee pointing to the spot. Sergio Agüero, City's ever-reliable marksman, stepped up to take the penalty, drilling the ball into the net to level the score at 1-1. Agüero's calm and precise finish not only restored parity but also intensified the belief among the City squad and supporters. The equalizer was Agüero’s 18th goal of the season, propelling him into the top 10 of City’s all-time scorers list.\n\nCity continued to press forward, with Fabian Delph and Fernando orchestrating play from midfield. Despite the slippery pitch, Delph endeavored to link up with City's attacking trio, creating several chances that kept the West Brom backline busy. The interplay between Nasri, Kolarov, and Agüero was a constant threat, albeit West Brom’s defense often proved difficult to breach.\n\nWest Brom’s attempts to counter were mostly snuffed out by City's defense, with Otamendi and Mangala proving resolute. Stefan Sessegnon, the goal-scorer, continued to be a bright spark for West Brom, frequently troubling City’s left flank, but his efforts were marred by a lack of support from his teammates. The visitors, while solid at the back, found it challenging to create clear-cut chances against a defensively disciplined City.\n\nAs the first half drew to a close, City appeared the more dominant side but had to be wary of West Brom’s ability to capitalize on set-pieces, a known strength of Tony Pulis's team. Joe Hart had relatively little to do after the early goal but remained alert to any potential threats.\n\nThe second half saw City assert their dominance further. Manuel Pellegrini made strategic changes, introducing Kevin De Bruyne and Yaya Touré, injecting fresh energy and creativity into the team. These substitutions would prove pivotal in tipping the scales in favor of Manchester City. De Bruyne's arrival injected a new level of agility and flair into City's attacks, making them more unpredictable and dangerous.\n\nIn the 66th minute, the breakthrough came. De Bruyne, who had been industrious since his introduction, started a move that saw Jesús Navas threading the ball into the path of Agüero. The Argentine found himself in a tight spot but managed to deliver a critical pass that eventually reached Nasri. Situated near the far post, Nasri coolly slotted the ball home, making it 2-1 to City. The goal triggered jubilant scenes among the home supporters as City turned the match around with anticipation building as to whether they could hold onto the lead.\n\nAs the match progressed, City continued to apply pressure, utilizing De Bruyne's vision and Touré’s midfield dominance. West Brom, not ready to back down, mounted several attempts to level the score again but were met with resolute defending. Notable in defensive duties, Otamendi and Mangala, alongside the industrious Zabaleta, warded off waves of West Brom attacks. The visitors had a golden opportunity through Berahino, who, under pressure, failed to convert after a scramble in the box. Joe Hart's goalkeeping was put to the test, but he managed to avert danger, making crucial saves to preserve City's lead.\n\nIn the final stretch of the match, the intensity heightened. Manchester City was determined to maintain their slim advantage, while West Brom threw everything forward, bringing on the young talent Leko to add fresh legs to their attack. The young debutant brought a spark but could not alter the outcome. The final moments saw West Brom almost snatch an equalizer when a cross into the box narrowly missed connecting with any attackers, leaving City fans gasping.\n\nDespite the pressure, Pellegrini's men held on firmly. Agüero, who endured a knock late in the game, was substituted possibly as a precaution, with Iheanacho taking his place. Agüero's departure was met with an ovation as fans acknowledged his significant contribution and wished for his quick recovery, particularly with the looming Champions League clash against PSG.\n\nThe final whistle blew, confirming Manchester City's hard-fought 2-1 victory. It was a crucial win that kept their hopes alive in the race for top-four Premier League finish. The match had everything - from early setbacks, a comeback, tactical adjustments, and thrilling football, making it a memorable encounter for all in attendance.\n\nThus, at the end of the day, Manchester City showcased why they are one of the top teams in the league. Their resilience and quality under pressure secured them an essential three points against a tough West Brom side, marking yet another chapter in their relentless pursuit of greatness in English football."
