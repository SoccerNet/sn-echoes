Dimitrescu.\n6:18 Comment: He's almost twice his age.\n6:21 Comment: Foul by Mangala.\n6:26 Comment: David Silva.\n6:27 Comment: Sterling's on the run as he loves to be.\n6:30 Comment: Aguero with him, Lindes forced him wide.\n6:34 Comment: Jesus Navas!\n6:39 Comment: What a good move.\n6:40 Comment: Counter-attack.\n6:41 Comment: What a good move that was, David Silva.\n6:43 Comment: I should expect wonderful awareness,\n6:45 Comment: I'm sure he does get the shout from Sterling.\n6:48 Comment: And he duly obliges.\n6:49 Comment: Navas not known for his clinical finishing, that's not an easy chance.\n6:55 Comment: The chest control pass, not bad to set him up,\n6:59 Comment: hasn't got a lot of the goal to look at.\n7:8 Comment: It's been a long time since Navas scored a Premier League goal,\n7:11 Comment: it was against Cardiff, I can tell you a bit in itself.\n7:16 Comment: There's been times this season when he's passed the ball,\n7:18 Comment: he's passed the buck when he

now.\n9:29 Comment: Aguero.\n9:32 Comment: Smalling going a long way with him.\n9:35 Comment: Aguero saying, come on then, foul me.\n9:37 Comment: Or if not, I'll do that to you.\n9:39 Comment:

here.\n9:49 Comment: This referee sent this player off.\n9:52 Comment: Well, he's on the yellow now.\n9:54 Comment: And even if he hadn't have been, I think,\n9:56 Comment: he'd think twice about going too far in\n9:58 Comment: because Aguero can do that to you.\n10:0 Comment: A little spin and burst of pace.\n10:3 Comment: There's no slouch, but over five yards,\n10:6 Comment: Aguero is so quick.\n10:7 Comment: Poor free kick from Yaya Toure.\n10:20 Comment: City looking for their 50th Derby win in all major competitions.\n10:24 Comment: United 170.\n10:30 Comment: Mangala.\n10:31 Comment: Came out by Damien.\n10:32 Comment: And there's the schnagel.\n10:37 Comment: And that's the free kick.\n10:39 Comment: Against Lingard this time.\n10:47 Comment: Jesus Navas.\n10:50 Comment: Nearly cross.\n10:53 Comment: Damien on the cover.\n10:56 Comment: So, yeah.\n10:57 Comment: Keep City going forward.\n11:0 Comment: Blin.\n11:3 Comment: Now Martial.\n11:7 Comment: Doing a bit better.\n11:11 Comment: He's\n11:14 Comment: been over the top of euro dólares for a while.\n11:16 Comment: Going for the lefty,\n11:18 Comment: just for 힘.\n11:20 Comment: Going over,\n11:25 Comment: and it was Mahyn with a no-shрос.\n11:29 Comment: The column,\n11:31 Comment: from Ray-J.\n11:33 Comment: This is from工- effectively.\n11:35 Comment: Not an elephant.\n11:36 Comment: Rashford played here last month in the under-21 derby, 61-1-0.\n11:50 Comment: Blin.\n11:57 Comment: Just about keeping United in possession.\n12:2 Comment: Lingard.\n12:6 Comment: That's a good run by Rashford.\n12:9 Comment: It's a corner for Manchester United.\n12:16 Comment: Certainly positive there, wasn't he?\n12:18 Comment: Only one thought to take on his man to try and get to the byline.\n12:25 Comment: Didn't look to pass the ball, pass it off.\n12:31 Comment: That did just come off Klitsch.\n12:36 Comment: No opponent near Joe Hart.\n12:41 Comment: As United line up deep.\n12:47 Comment: According to plan, they're fortunate to get another go at it.\n12:52 Comment: Of course, Michael Oliver wasn't set.\n13:6 Comment: Take two.\n13:8 Comment: You can see that.\n13:9 Comment: Nobody around the keeper.\n13:12 Comment: Joe Hart comes in.\n13:13 Comment: That's a good punch.\n13:15 Comment: Barrow, a little fortunate with the touch.\n13:20 Comment: Certainly not showing any derby day nerves.\n13:28 Comment: Sterling.\n13:29 Comment: Nearly went through for David Silva.\n13:32 Comment: Just needed a bit of height on it.\n13:35 Comment: Silva was away.\n13:36 Comment: Here's the ball from the back.\n13:39 Comment: From De Gea out to Rojo.\n13:41 Comment: But he's put Stadler in trouble.\n13:43 Comment: And there's Yaya Toure.\n13:46 Comment: Silva.\n13:47 Comment: Passing the ball and responsibility to Sterling.\n13:50 Comment: Back to Silva again.\n13:52 Comment: Over Toure.\n13:53 Comment: There's Navas.\n13:55 Comment: Well, David De Gea might not have seen that till late\n13:58 Comment: because Rojo was masking his view, but he kept it out.\n14:1 Comment: As he so often does.\n14:2 Comment: Nothing wrong with a strike on that occasion for Navas.\n14:5 Comment: Bit of swerve on it as well.\n14:6 Comment: Made it difficult for the keeper.\n14:18 Comment: In towards Mangala.\n14:21 Comment: Also Fernandinho in there.\n14:22 Comment: Who actually did meet it.\n14:24 Comment: But a good stop by De Gea.\n14:26 Comment: Yeah, good stop from a very good goalkeeper.\n14:31 Comment: Yaya Toure does well here because he slipped,\n14:33 Comment: but he manages to keep the attack alive.\n14:36 Comment: And again it's Navas.\n14:38 Comment: And he ends up with a chance through the legs of Rojo.\n14:44 Comment: Which as we know can make it really difficult for the keeper.\n14:49 Comment: Not through the legs of David De Gea.\n14:52 Comment: He used his right foot very effectively.\n14:59 Comment: Rashford.\n15:0 Comment: He's in here.\n15:1 Comment: He scores!\n15:2 Comment: Marcus Rashford.\n15:4 Comment: Takes yet another step away.\n15:6 Comment: Another step up the ladder.\n15:8 Comment: And it's a lad from Manchester.\n15:10 Comment: Who scores in the derby for Manchester United.\n15:16 Comment: I was just talking about nut and eggs I think.\n15:18 Comment: Marcus Rashford has just done one on Di Michalis here.\n15:22 Comment: He certainly left him on his backside.\n15:24 Comment: Lovely piece of skill from the 18-year-old.\n15:28 Comment: And again he's positive.\n15:30 Comment: Can I take on my man? No.\n15:31 Comment: He's just knocked it to the side.\n15:32 Comment: But Di Michalis gets beaten far too easily here.\n15:36 Comment: Having said that, how coolly does the teenager take it?\n15:41 Comment: His first Manchester derby.\n15:43 Comment: What a start for him.\n15:51 Comment: Well some pre-match talk about it's time to leave him out.\n15:54 Comment: I don't think so.\n15:58 Comment: He's kept him in.\n16:0 Comment: And he's now scored five goals in eight appearances.\n16:4 Comment: In a remarkable start.\n16:6 Comment: To what will surely go on to be an excellent Manchester United career.\n16:11 Comment: Marcus Rashford makes the headlines again.\n16:15 Comment: Well if those two braces were a highlight, that might have just beaten them.\n16:24 Comment: Two in the Europa League.\n16:25 Comment: Two in the Premier League on his debut against Arsenal.\n16:29 Comment: And now here, what, a quarter of an hour into his first derby.\n16:33 Comment: And he's the man of the moment again.\n16:36 Comment: The boy of the moment really.\n16:39 Comment: And City have been the team, the dominant side, you have to say, first 15, 16 minutes.\n16:49 Comment: It's been all City.\n16:54 Comment: Speedy striker, soft centre.\n17:1 Comment: We talked about Otamendi and the company not being there.\n17:4 Comment: And...\n17:6 Comment: Rashford just strove through the middle.\n17:8 Comment: And here's Martial, gonna do something similar.\n17:10 Comment: Beaten out by Hart.\n17:12 Comment: Again, Di Michalis beating all ends up.\n17:15 Comment: Just getting caught, two square on.\n17:17 Comment: That soft centre you're talking about, Martin.\n17:20 Comment: It's coming to fruition here.\n17:22 Comment: We've got to get organised, that City central defence.\n17:25 Comment: Particularly Di Michalis.\n17:27 Comment: Lingard on that occasion it was, skating past him.\n17:30 Comment: Good day for the English strikers.\n17:37 Comment: And he came very much in Roy Hodgson's plans.\n17:41 Comment: Marcus Rashford has had a mention already, which raised plenty of eyebrows.\n17:49 Comment: He took it with the composure of a veteran.\n17:51 Comment: Having left a Manchester City defensive veteran.\n17:57 Comment: And with the...\n17:58 Comment: The...\n18:0 Comment: The red on the face.\n18:2 Comment: And the boot by Rojo.\n18:7 Comment: Well, no signs of Europa League fatigue from Manchester United thus far.\n18:21 Comment: It's been a problem all season for City, hasn't it?\n18:23 Comment: Life without Vincent Kompany.\n18:25 Comment: They've never looked entirely secure.\n18:28 Comment: take it you now\n18:40 Comment: There's a fluidity and flexibility\n18:42 Comment: about\n18:43 Comment: Manchester United approaching their task here\n18:46 Comment: City are struggling\n18:47 Comment: to know whether Lingard's in the middle or on the right.\n18:50 Comment: Rashford is coming from a wide position.\n18:51 Comment: Martial is here in the middle.\n18:53 Comment: That's a great save.\n18:54 Comment: They haven't always had pace in this attack this season,\n18:57 Comment: season but a bit at the moment\n19:8 Comment: on the broader shoulders what comes the responsibility of giving city back into\n19:11 Comment: a big game\n19:21 Comment: looking for rashford\n19:24 Comment: having a good game just behind the centre forward there popping up in space using the ball well\n19:32 Comment: cliche\n19:37 Comment: first leicester derby goal of the season after the goalist draw at old chaffer in october\n19:44 Comment: and marcus rashford was nowhere near being part of it\n19:50 Comment: just to back up what you were saying in allen city nine clean\n19:53 Comment: cheats since the beginning of the season and i think the other team has done a great job\n19:53 Comment: and i think the other team has done a great job\n19:53 Comment: of being the best they can be in the league and i think the other team has done a great job\n19:53 Comment: and i think the other team has done a great job\n19:54 Comment: and we've got a lot of good games in the league and we've got a lot of good games in the league and\n19:54 Comment: we've got a lot of good games in the league and companies 12 premier league starts\n19:56 Comment: companies 12 premier league starts four clean cheats in the other 18 premier\n19:59 Comment: four clean cheats in the other 18 premier league games now\n20:1 Comment: league games now it's a huge blow\n20:6 Comment: there's plenty of players they can lose\n20:8 Comment: there's plenty of players they can lose from this team but he's not one of them\n20:18 Comment: from this team but he's not one of them\n20:35 Comment: a few tips off the captain but

nice spin\n20:44 Comment: lingard involved and it's a nice spin it's a nice strike\n20:47 Comment: it's a nice strike joe hartz\n20:48 Comment: joe hartz\n20:50 Comment: another example of their threat on the\n20:53 Comment: another example of their threat on the front foot at the moment united\n21:6 Comment: Stirling has to stay off for the moment.\n21:19 Comment: Silva takes.\n21:21 Comment: Well, it was an opportunity for Martin Di Michele to make some amends.\n21:29 Comment: They've got a bit more height and power, City, than United,\n21:31 Comment: and that is a golden opportunity up against Marcus Rocco.\n21:35 Comment: He's certainly got the beating of his man and should do a lot better.\n21:43 Comment: Rocco.\n21:51 Comment: David Silva.\n22:2 Comment: Sterling.\n22:5 Comment: Raheem Sterling.\n22:7 Comment: He's still limping.\n22:11 Comment: Might add to Manchester City's early problems here.\n22:15 Comment: Certainly doesn't look right at the moment.\n22:19 Comment: I think it was Juan Mata that waved a leg towards him.\n22:32 Comment: Sanya.\n22:35 Comment: Diseased for a ditch fallen ship.\n22:37 Comment: He's got a good style, doesn't he?\n23:1 Comment: Is that a save ?\n23:3 Comment: Stop the clock.\n23:4 Comment: That seems big.\n23:5 Comment: It's hard to get that, isn't it?\n23:5 Comment: That's a corner.\n23:8 Comment: Nearly on the stretch.\n23:11 Comment: That's Sato, City will see this as another opportunity to try and impose themselves on United.\n23:18 Comment: They've set pieces.\n23:29 Comment: Flynn.\n23:30 Comment: It's not the quickest player they've got forward.\n23:33 Comment: 169 this time, Matip, but it's a tidy one.\n23:37 Comment: Flynn under some pressure, keeping the ball.\n23:53 Comment: It's going to be Fernando.\n23:57 Comment: That seems for Olympian Sterling.\n24:3 Comment: Schneidle.\n24:9 Comment: Mourinho stepping in.\n24:12 Comment: Dropping over Smalling for Aguero to chase.\n24:18 Comment: Schneidle.\n24:20 Comment: And Damian.\n24:27 Comment: I presume that will push Yaya Toure further forward.\n24:32 Comment: And Silva will go out.\n24:33 Comment: That's on to the left-hand side, Alan.\n24:36 Comment: Offside here.\n24:37 Comment: What's that position can be made now?\n24:39 Comment: He's really struggling, Sterling, you don't want to make it even worse.\n24:42 Comment: It looks like the groin that he's tweaked.\n24:45 Comment: Last thing you want to do is tear it completely.\n24:48 Comment: 7-2.\n24:51 Comment: Shame for him. Back in the team.\n24:57 Comment: That's Matt's challenge, and that causes him to...\n25:1 Comment: Maybe just...\n25:3 Comment: He's stretching.\n25:4 Comment: Fernando.\n25:11 Comment: He's particularly disappointing, having got back in the starting XI today\n25:15 Comment: to last only 25 minutes.\n25:17 Comment: So that's an early recall for Fernando.\n25:24 Comment: Juan Mata, of course, last away game in the Premier League, was sent off.\n25:30 Comment: Two unwise challenges.\n25:33 Comment: Not really one of the Premier League hatchet men,\n25:37 Comment: but he's damaged Raheem Sterling here today.\n25:43 Comment: As you said, Martin, slight adjustment.\n25:45 Comment: Toure in a more advanced position, David Silva out to the left.\n25:51 Comment: And that familiar partnership at the base of midfield.\n25:59 Comment: Into Yaya Toure from Martin Dimichelis.\n26:3 Comment: That was a marvellous goal for Salah.\n26:8 Comment: I suppose he should stay out of Management League for sure.\n26:12 Comment: That's it, he needs to start flavouring himself better play.\n26:16 Comment: Whilst he's the ref.\n26:25 Comment: Newкра każdy are probably promoted to the Netherlands vão vanmakersumre.\n26:30 Comment: Luckily, the United got over.\n26:32 Comment: This is his 68th game, it's not the most wonderful ratio by Manchester United standards,\n26:39 Comment: but he can take great credit, Louis van Gaal, for involving today's scorer in the first team.\n26:47 Comment: Louis' lads might be a legacy if his reign does come to an end\n26:54 Comment: a year before the initial contract is completed.\n26:59 Comment: I won't say who's forced into it with injuries, but...\n27:2 Comment: Could have played Martial through the middle and Depay on the left.\n27:7 Comment: He could have.\n27:9 Comment: But United have had a few problems this season,\n27:12 Comment: defending their goal hasn't really been one of them,\n27:15 Comment: so they'll be fairly confident and hopeful of keeping City at bay\n27:19 Comment: at least until the break here.\n27:28 Comment: It's all right.\n27:31 Comment: There's Navas.\n27:34 Comment: On low.\n27:35 Comment: A lot of rising red shirts before.\n27:39 Comment: One City player who might have been a target, Sergio Guerra, had gone to the far post.\n27:45 Comment: Sane.\n27:48 Comment: Navas again.\n27:50 Comment: United doubling up on him.\n27:54 Comment: Fernando.\n27:58 Comment: Tora.\n27:59 Comment: That's a curve to where it might have cost the front of his man.\n28:6 Comment: A kick by David de Gea,\n28:9 Comment: Rashford recognising the intention of the goalkeeper as well.\n28:13 Comment: De Gea knowing that one ball put trouble on Manchester City.\n28:18 Comment: And he's very good with that distribution out of his hands.\n28:24 Comment: A long punt.\n28:25 Comment: That's a good one.\n28:29 Comment: And it is.\n28:33 Comment: Go Smalling.\n28:34 Comment: Think of the Paul Scholes scoring in Premier League Manchester derby.\n28:35 Comment: It comes from Salford.\n28:38 Comment: Not quite in tune with the locality not whether that counts as Manchester or not.\n28:43 Comment: Probably not.\n28:45 Comment: If you look at the distinction.\n28:46 Comment: It's very proud of the distinction.\n28:47 Comment: So you have to go back to Andy Ritchie.\n28:49 Comment: He's a genuine Mancunian scoring for United in a derby.\n28:51 Comment: Jimmy Amato.\n28:52 Comment: Andy Ritchie.\n28:53 Comment: He's got a big leagueКА.\n28:54 Comment: Andy Ritchie.\n28:57 Comment: APPLAUSE\n29:1 Comment: Pretty much a global event these days.\n29:7 Comment: Lingard.\n29:12 Comment: Bent on his backside.\n29:14 Comment: Loffrey actually in the end played the advantage.\n29:17 Comment: Matasenghwai got the ball in space.\n29:21 Comment: Did you really need to stop him?\n29:27 Comment: Yes, he did.\n29:37 Comment: Martial.\n29:40 Comment: Stopped quickly by Sane.\n29:42 Comment: He might get in again here.\n29:44 Comment: Mata.\n29:45 Comment: Martial again.\n29:47 Comment: Waiting for Damien.\n29:50 Comment: He was a little reluctant to get there\n29:52 Comment: and made it a bit easier, I think, for the Frenchman.\n29:57 Comment: Yeah, one matchup coming inside,\n29:59 Comment: so there was a big gap on the right for United.\n30:11 Comment: Bled.\n30:15 Comment: I think they'll be fairly happy, United,\n30:17 Comment: with the way things have gone since scoring that goal.\n30:21 Comment: Here is the scorer.\n30:24 Comment: Rojo.\n30:27 Comment: No chance to put in a dangerous ball then.\n30:40 Comment: Here's a corner.\n30:42 Comment: From Yves-Daily Blind.\n30:44 Comment: His next job, of course, is to link up with the Dutch national team,\n30:47 Comment: which includes a fixture at Wembley,\n30:49 Comment: in the week on Tuesday.\n30:53 Comment: He's been a great signing for Manchester United, Daily Blind.\n30:57 Comment: That's an intelligent footballer.\n30:59 Comment: Doing a turning central defence.\n31:8 Comment: Care if he'll get there first.\n31:15 Comment: Still plenty to toss it in towards in terms of teammates.\n31:22 Comment: Toure.\n31:23 Comment: Silva, Aguero, tight.\n31:27 Comment: And it goes against Manchester City.\n31:30 Comment: I think Juan Matu was the one most likely to keep him on.\n31:34 Comment: He's looking across the line, Aguero thinking that he had delayed it.\n31:42 Comment: Flag of the state down there in a really good position here.\n31:46 Comment: No, it wasn't Matu, was it? But he was level.\n31:51 Comment: He was level.\n31:56 Comment: Fernando.\n31:59 Comment: Toure.\n32:3 Comment: There's Navas.\n32:5 Comment: And Mourinho by the near post, just a bit offside.\n32:8 Comment: Back to Yaya Toure, his kind of distance.\n32:10 Comment: With either foot.\n32:13 Comment: A subtle strike that time.\n32:16 Comment: You can never discount him.\n32:18 Comment: 20 yards in.\n32:19 Comment: So capable on all the sides.\n32:21 Comment: Not too far away.\n32:28 Comment: Lindt.\n32:33 Comment: Well done by Rashford.\n32:40 Comment: He's going in quickly.\n32:45 Comment: He's got it.\n32:52 Comment: Bumper.\n32:53 Comment: Morgan Schneiderlin here.\n32:54 Comment: Hasn't been ahead of the play that often.\n32:56 Comment: But it's a throw for Rashford, not quite.\n32:59 Comment: He was on wasn't it that ball?\n33:1 Comment: Family-less on the pass, and you might just have got on the end of it, Rashford.\n33:9 Comment: Recent seasons with the growth of Manchester City...\n33:14 Comment: and the new money that came in...\n33:16 Comment: They've won six of the last nine Premier League derbies.\n33:19 Comment: noisy neighbours as Alex Ferguson called

play the ball out of defence\n34:51 Comment: got away with it this time\n34:53 Comment: Harper's in a hurry\n34:54 Comment: Clichy's in a hurry\n34:56 Comment: City a goal down at home in the

where Manchester United do look dangerous.\n36:57 Comment: Rojo's cross.\n37:0 Comment: Atta was trying to guess where she was going to back-head it to.\n37:7 Comment: It's very odd to see him get sent off in the day.\n37:12 Comment: He's one of the most genial guys in the game.\n37:18 Comment: And he kept fouling another.\n37:21 Comment: Darren Fletcher.\n37:37 Comment: And...\n37:44 Comment:

just need a bit more quality with that ball into the box.\n39:16 Comment: But started that move with City giving the ball away.\n39:19 Comment: They wanted a quick to close down the man.\n39:22 Comment: Showing a bit more intensity to the play at the moment, the visitors.\n39:26 Comment: Roberto Martinez.\n39:35 Comment: That's a good one.\n39:36 Comment: That's good attack.\n39:44 Comment:

an interesting episode\n41:35 Comment: because Glyn probably was all over\n41:37 Comment: Aguero to start with.\n41:39 Comment: And then\n41:41 Comment: Aguero went for the ball\n41:43 Comment: but in a dangerous manner, Alan.\n41:45 Comment: Did you think?\n41:47 Comment: Well, he's gone for the bouncing ball\n41:49 Comment: and it's one of those classic ones\n41:51 Comment: where the lad trying

Comment: was in the back.\n42:31 Comment: He's probably known\n42:33 Comment: from his birth,\n42:35 Comment: I would think,\n42:37 Comment: to a football family.\n42:41 Comment: Maybe a little family concern.\n42:45 Comment: A couple of minutes to go to half-time.\n42:47 Comment: Your thoughts on the first half, Alan?\n42:49 Comment: I've been impressed by\n42:51 Comment: Manchester United.\n42:53 Comment: They've caused a constant threat down this side.\n42:55 Comment: Whether it's Martial\n42:57 Comment: or Marcus Rashford\n42:59 Comment: drifting on to this flank.\n43:1 Comment: They've had some pace about them.\n43:3 Comment: Some real intent.\n43:5 Comment: And they've defended well.\n43:7 Comment: So the ball's in City's court now.\n43:15 Comment: Aguero consuming hostilities with Lindt.\n43:23 Comment: And it's a bounce back up again\n43:25 Comment: for Sergio Aguero.\n43:27 Comment: And I think it's probably as well for the referee\n43:29 Comment: that half-time is approaching.\n43:31 Comment: Danda is up here.\n43:33 Comment: He's on the run.\n43:35 Comment: And Lindt is with him.\n43:37 Comment: And I was surprised that\n43:39 Comment: there was\n43:43 Comment: a bit of a coming together.\n43:45 Comment: Yeah, surprised he got sucked in there,\n43:47 Comment: Daley Lindt, because\n43:49 Comment: Aguero was always going to\n43:51 Comment: make the ref\n43:53 Comment: aware of any kind of a shove in the back there.\n43:55 Comment: And he didn't need to.\n43:57 Comment: He had one go and then another.\n43:59 Comment: Talk about Aguero's Danda.\n44:1 Comment: He's got a good run up.\n44:3 Comment: I think Blitz was as well.\n44:5 Comment: It's a definite foul.\n44:7 Comment: But when you're looking to defend\n44:9 Comment: a 1-0 lead to half-time,\n44:11 Comment: however\n44:13 Comment: high rate you might have become,\n44:15 Comment: giving away a free kick in these circumstances\n44:17 Comment: is not the brightest thing to do.\n44:23 Comment: That's the last person you'd expect to do it as well.\n44:31 Comment: It's a chance for City\n44:33 Comment: to get level at half-time.\n44:35 Comment: Wow.\n44:37 Comment: He impeded there,\n44:39 Comment: Jago Toure.\n44:41 Comment: Look for a moment to see if there's going to be\n44:43 Comment: something fairly simple at the far post\n44:45 Comment: for the big man.\n44:47 Comment: Yes, Sonia, they got the flick on to cause the chaos.\n44:49 Comment: And a wrestling match with Michael Carrick.\n44:51 Comment: You could argue that\n44:53 Comment: Carrick had been fouled.\n44:55 Comment: Initially, Carrick's got hold of Toure.\n44:57 Comment: Just out of shot.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: West Ham, Liverpool, Leicester and Tottenham have all left here with three points\n0:4 Comment: remember City lost five Premier League home games in total in the previous four seasons combined\n0:13 Comment: practically invincible\n0:16 Comment: to make them vulnerable\n0:30 Comment: it's been a very good contest particularly given\n0:36 Comment: the European games it was just really as Manchester City would have wanted it\n0:43 Comment: what a shot and Hart has to come out and it's Martin Di Michele again\n0:50 Comment: he's caught him as well Hart just waved to the bench needs a bit of treatment he's on the deck\n0:55 Comment: Anthony Marcialo felt he was entitled to go for that\n1:0 Comment: could have been so much worse for City the penalty which wasn't given which most\n1:7 Comment: people in the ground thought should have been well the City fans probably feared\n1:11 Comment: that it would be given and then Di Michele's again\n1:15 Comment: you know what though Hart, I don't think Joe Hart actually wanted to pass it to Di Michele\n1:20 Comment: he had to think about it and thought that's my only option and then the back pass\n1:24 Comment: bit of a hospital back pass this one\n1:28 Comment: he's got to move forward, he's got to move forward and get back up there and give the ball to the right man\n1:29 Comment: he's got to move forward and get back up there and give the ball to the right man\n1:30 Comment: quickly Joe Hart just on the follow-through maybe catches the studs of Marseille on the calf\n1:38 Comment: oh he stretched it looks like a stretch\n1:43 Comment: not going well we'll talk about the England implications if he does have to go off of course\n1:52 Comment: Willy Caballero very much a oops doesn't look too good the hero of the Capital One Cup triumph over Liverpool\n2:0 Comment: with those three penalty saves in the shootout\n2:3 Comment: the calves are a bit of a problem at City aren't they\n2:10 Comment: they had to move quickly there just coming back from half-time he'd been sat in the dressing

Comment: Here comes the Wilfred Bonny again.\n27:4 Comment: Good block, it's a difficult ball for Fernando to strike, goalwards.\n27:11 Comment: This is the right-back, Bakary Sanja.\n27:13 Comment: Do you know who else has got to stop Sanja flicking it on at the near post?\n27:17 Comment: That's Thomas, he's done it now.\n27:19 Comment: Causing problems.\n27:22 Comment: But what about Aguero's chance?\n27:24 Comment: Well, bad too, really, Wilfred Bonny after that.\n27:27 Comment: This was probably the most clear-cut at the far post with his head.\n27:34 Comment: I'd say it was a simple one,\n27:36 Comment: but you can hear me in the fancy to loop it over to Haydn.\n27:40 Comment: Bonny just makes his move too early, the pass perhaps didn't help him.\n27:49 Comment: Fernandinho.\n27:57 Comment: Just to reinforce what this is about for Manchester United,\n28:0 Comment: if they can win the game,\n28:2 Comment: it really will leave the pitch with a belief that they can overtake Manchester City in the Premier League.\n28:7 Comment: They did so regularly, they were ahead of them for so many Premier League seasons,\n28:12 Comment: trophy-winning seasons.\n28:14 Comment: That's a good ball, not so much in recent times.\n28:17 Comment: And Ashford, who's got the sprinting golf ability to turn those channel balls into something more than just a clearance.\n28:27 Comment: There's two of his team-mates looking a little jaded, but he's still got plenty of running in him.\n28:47 Comment: Fernandinho.\n28:52 Comment: Torre, despite having licence to play further up the pitch, wants to come and influence.\n28:56 Comment: Torre has a bit of a bad form, but it's not a bad thing.\n28:58 Comment: He's got the ball, he's got the ball.\n28:59 Comment: It's less attention there.\n29:3 Comment: Navas.\n29:5 Comment: Navas Silva.\n29:6 Comment: Here is Yaya Torre, who'll come on to Manchester United from that deeper role.\n29:10 Comment: Aguero.\n29:12 Comment: Torre again.\n29:16 Comment: It'll continue to look very dangerous, Manchester City.\n29:18 Comment: Navas.\n29:22 Comment: Finally to find the back of the net in a Premier League game.\n29:25 Comment: Yeah, having done the whole thing,\n29:26 Comment: the hard part you might say, it's just a lack of confidence, I think, for me.\n29:30 Comment: I'm Navas, never any conviction.\n29:32 Comment: In the shot.\n29:38 Comment: Such a regular starter for Manuel Pellegrini.\n29:44 Comment: Before today, 70 Premier League games since his last goal in the division.\n29:48

challenge on Lingard.\n30:18 Comment: Michael Oliver produces the yellow card.\n30:25 Comment: The SCs cannot highlight what goes on within Ingres as Longoria rounded up following Greenwich 3–2.\n30:29 Comment: GERRARD GARCIA.\n30:31 Comment: Yeah, that's the attack.\n30:32 Comment: They need to get that back,aa!\n30:36 Comment: Yes, that's it, man.\n30:37 Comment: They need to do something, to do something.\n30:40 Comment: Ashley Leverne on the left, mailing that back to Ring.\n30:44 Comment: Nicola Ewing, who's come forward thisそんな soon as well.\n30:47 Comment: Here's the

have been there\n32:56 Comment: coming through the back of Aguero\n32:58 Comment: just wonder to add to that Alan\n33:1 Comment: if he hadn't been sent off by the same referee\n33:3 Comment: in the same fixture last season\n33:5 Comment: things like that do go through officials minds\n33:11 Comment: taken by David Silva\n33:17 Comment: and a header by Fernando\n33:30 Comment: it's all a bit messy for United\n33:33 Comment: in total Valencia as you said got sucked in\n33:36 Comment: so they lost the shape at the back\n33:37 Comment: and\n33:38 Comment: he committed the foul\n33:47

    "summary": "In a highly anticipated Manchester derby, Manchester City faced off against Manchester United at the Etihad Stadium, with both teams vying for critical Premier League points. The match was crucial for City's bid to cement their place in the Champions League spots as well as maintaining a respectable finish in the league. On the other hand, Manchester United sought to keep their hopes alive for a top-four finish and bolster their chances in the FA Cup. The atmosphere was electric from the get-go, with fans from both sides creating a cacophony of noise, setting the stage for what promised to be an enthralling battle.\n\nThe opening minutes saw Manchester City starting strongly, demonstrating their intent right from kick-off. Jesus Navas made early inroads, pushing forward aggressively. Despite his efforts, Matteo Darmian played it safe, conceding a corner to prevent any early threats. It was a strategic, albeit cautious, move from United's defender. Moments later, an opportunity presented itself for Yaya Toure from the resulting corner, which saw Manchester United’s defense on high alert as they scrambled to keep the ball out.\n\nAs the game unfolded, it became evident that both teams had prepared meticulously for this clash. United, led by their stalwart midfielder Michael Carrick, aimed not only to solidify their defense but also to create opportunities for their attackers. Jesse Lingard’s cross intended for Mata was thwarted, but it showcased United’s strategy of utilizing their flexible front four, with players like Marcus Rashford and Anthony Martial swapping positions to keep City’s defense guessing.\n\nCity's attacking prowess was undeniable, with David Silva’s vision and Sergio Aguero’s movement creating constant threats. Yet, they were met with resilient defending from United, particularly from Chris Smalling and Daley Blind, who were tasked with keeping the ever-dangerous Aguero at bay. There were notable instances where City's forward line, influenced by the darting runs of Raheem Sterling, managed to cause panic, but decisive interventions from United's backline averted any immediate danger.\n\nThe tension at the Etihad was palpable as City’s fans ramped up their support, yet the on-field proceedings did little to settle their nerves. After a vibrant start from City, United began to claw their way back into the game. Rashford, in particular, seemed to relish the spotlight. His quick pace and agility were evident when he made a determined run, only to see his efforts converted into a corner by City's diligent defense.\n\nMidway through the first half, City's confidence began to wane, with misplaced passes and a lack of cohesion in key moments. This period of uncertainty was exploited ruthlessly by Manchester United, particularly by the young and spirited Rashford. In the 16th minute, Rashford made a critical breakthrough for United. Displaying remarkable composure and dazzling footwork, he left City's veteran defender, Martin Demichelis, sprawling on the grass and slotted the ball past Joe Hart with a composed finish. The 18-year-old’s celebration was a testament to both his elation and the significance of the goal in such a crucial fixture.\n\nUnited's supporters erupted in joy, sensing a shift in momentum. The goal was a reflection of United’s tactical flexibility and the faith shown by manager Louis van Gaal in his young star. From then on, the game saw United adopting a more controlled approach, ensuring they maintained their lead while probing for opportunities to extend it. Martial, combining brilliantly with Mata and Lingard, came close to doubling United’s tally, but Joe Hart’s reflexes denied them.\n\nCity, on the other hand, found themselves grappling with injuries and tactical adjustments. Sterling’s early departure due to injury was a significant blow. The introduction of Fernando to the midfield reshuffled City’s formation, pushing Yaya Toure into a more advanced position and shifting Silva to the left. Despite these changes, City struggled to regain composure, with Demichelis particularly having a torrid time against United’s attackers.\n\nThe first half concluded with City pushing for an equalizer. An intense clash between Aguero and Smalling epitomized the relentless nature of the derby. As Aguero danced through United's defense, Smalling’s commitment resulted in a free kick for City just outside United’s box. Yaya Toure’s attempt, however, did little to trouble David de Gea.\n\nThe second half resumed with City increasing their tempo, desperate to overturn the deficit. However, it was United who almost inflicted further damage when Martial's challenge on Demichelis resulted in a clash involving Joe Hart. The following minutes were tense as Hart called for treatment, highlighting City's frailties at the back. Hart’s exit from the game, replaced by Willy Caballero, further complicated matters for City. The replacement goalkeeper, albeit a cup hero for City, faced a trial by fire in the high-stakes environment of a Manchester derby.\n\nCity’s attacking endeavours continued to stutter, with missed opportunities and brilliant defending from United maintaining the scoreline. Aguero hit the post with a glancing header, which was perhaps City’s best chance of the game. Silva and Navas tirelessly worked the flanks, but United’s rearguard action held firm. The introduction of Bastian Schweinsteiger added much-needed experience to United's midfield, playing a pivotal role in breaking up City’s play and setting up counter-attacks.\n\nWith time running out, City’s desperation grew. Exposing themselves to counter-attacks, they left gaps at the back which Rashford and Martial were keen to exploit. Rashford’s pace was a constant thorn in City’s side, nearly creating another goal-scoring opportunity. United’s tactical nous came to the fore, with Carrick and Schneiderlin orchestrating the midfield, ensuring City’s attacking moves were predictably stifled.\n\nAs the clock ticked, the tension in the stadium was unmatched. City threw everything at United in the closing moments, but resolute defending, coupled with De Gea’s safe hands, preserved the visitors’ lead. The final whistle echoed relief for United and frustration for City. United emerged victorious with a 1-0 win, courtesy of a memorable goal from their teenage sensation, Marcus Rashford. The win not only provided a crucial three points but also a significant morale boost in their quest for a top-four finish.\n\nCity, despite their efforts, had to reflect on a match where defensive lapses and missed opportunities defined their day. The loss meant they had now dropped crucial points at home, putting their Champions League aspirations under further scrutiny. The defeat, coupled with injuries to key players, made the path ahead more challenging.\n\nIn the end, the derby lived up to its billing—highly competitive, laden with drama, and defined by a moment of brilliance from a young local talent. Rashford's goal marked him out as not just a promising prospect but a key player capable of making an impact in the big games. For United, this victory was a testament to their tactical discipline and the growing influence of their younger players. For City, it was a wake-up call, highlighting areas that require immediate attention as they aim to finish the season on a strong note."
