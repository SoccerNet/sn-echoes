and Stoke City hope to finish in style.\n0:9 Comment: Stoke have won their last three games, they're trying to target a place in next season's UEFA Europa League.\n0:16 Comment: Chelsea, who haven't discounted progress in this season's Champions League,\n0:20 Comment: home on Wednesday to Paris Saint-Germain,\n0:23 Comment: have sights on further success in the FA Cup,\n0:26 Comment: as well as extending their 12-game and bean run in the league since Jose Mourinho left in December.\n0:35 Comment: One of those games with Steve Holland in charge,\n0:38 Comment: as Hiddink was looking on on that occasion when they were successful here against Sunderland.\n0:48 Comment: Hiddink in his second spell in charge of Chelsea.\n0:54 Comment: Last time around Tony Gale took them to an FA Cup success.\n1:0 Comment: He's certainly done the trick since he's come here so far this season.\n1:3 Comment: He's just taken the shackles off a little bit and let Chelsea relax about their football.\n1:8 Comment: Really let the players, again, take the responsibility.\n1:11 Comment: A few rested for Chelsea today, of course.\n1:14 Comment: Fabricas, Costa, all playing at Norwich in the week where I was, Tony.\n1:19 Comment: Chelsea rather cruise through that game, but the young man you see in shot there, Traore,\n1:24 Comment: he started on the right-hand side.\n1:26 Comment: Today he starts up front for Chelsea, right down the middle.\n1:30 Comment: It certainly was promising what I saw at Norwich.\n1:33 Comment: Interesting, and a few players getting their chance.\n1:37 Comment: On the other hand for Stoke, solid-looking team now,\n1:40 Comment: and a good footballing side that I think will test Chelsea this afternoon at their own game.\n1:45 Comment: Good side.\n1:48 Comment: Shaqiri scored the winner against Newcastle on Wednesday.\n1:52 Comment: Shaqiri's cross, which is easy for Courtois.\n2:0 Comment: Shadan Shaqiri, who arrived at Stoke last summer for £12m from Inter Milan,\n2:6 Comment: had a troubled time during the second half of last season in Italy,\n2:9 Comment: having joined them from Bayern Munich.\n2:12 Comment: Stoke's transfer record, which they've broken again during the January window,\n2:17 Comment: bringing in Gianelli and Boula.\n2:21 Comment: He was featured at Stamford Bridge already this season,\n2:24 Comment: and the UEFA Champions League for Porto.\n2:28 Comment: Afelaj?\n2:31 Comment: Good little breaks, just sitting in the pocket there, Afelaj,\n2:34 Comment: just trying to affect it there.\n2:35 Comment: It'll be interesting today with Chelsea with the two sitting midfield players,\n2:39 Comment: Matic and Mikel, whether they can play out as effectively\n2:43 Comment: when Fabregas plays with either one of the two.\n2:51 Comment: Maneesa came on as a first-half substitute for Phil Bardsley in the game on Wednesday evening.\n2:59 Comment: Stoke have had their defensive issues this season,\n3:3 Comment: several notable absentees including Ryan Shawcross and Glenn Johnson.\n3:10 Comment: Mark Lawson, another absentee.\n3:17 Comment: I think Traore's going to need a little bit of help today,\n3:19 Comment: and movement from the likes of Hazard, Oscar and Willian in behind.\n3:25 Comment: It'll be very difficult for him up against experienced defenders,\n3:28 Comment: he's going to need every help that he can get.\n3:30 Comment: Ivanovic.\n3:33 Comment: Really searching pass by Ivanovic, which is picked up by Asper Lakota.\n3:43 Comment: Well, great stuff from Chelsea, really more direct stuff,\n3:46 Comment: great pass from Ivanovic, finds Asper Lakota,\n3:49 Comment: and Traore really should get something on this on the volley,\n3:52 Comment: should be at least getting a right-foot, side-foot volley on that,\n3:56 Comment: as you can see.\n3:57 Comment: He tries to meet it on the volley, but as a complete air shot,\n4:0 Comment: that was a good chance.\n4:8 Comment: Traore made his first start in the Premier League\n4:10 Comment: and the win at Norwich on Tuesday.\n4:15 Comment: He's got his quota of goals already this season.\n4:20 Comment: Two of them have come in the FA Cup.\n4:27 Comment: It's Everton next weekend in the sixth round for Chelsea.\n4:31 Comment: Afelaj.\n4:34 Comment: Leg is up for an offside against Shaqiri, which was careless by Sturm.\n4:38 Comment: I think he wanted the ball earlier, he sat near Afelaj,\n4:40 Comment: he needed that ball earlier.\n4:42 Comment: Some lovely play from Mbula, who finds Afelaj in the pocket,\n4:47 Comment: tries to find Shaqiri, and he's just waiting,\n4:49 Comment: and then all of a sudden that pass didn't arrive.\n4:52 Comment: Should have seen it earlier, Afelaj.\n5:7 Comment: Good pressing by Peters.\n5:10 Comment: Here's Afelaj.\n5:15 Comment: Mbula.\n5:19 Comment: Shaqiri.\n5:21 Comment: Can't get away from Matic.\n5:29 Comment: Well, good start from Stokes, starting on the front foot,\n5:32 Comment: really zipping those passes about.\n5:34 Comment: That's a sort of traditional out of Mark Hughes's side,\n5:37 Comment: Mark Bowen and Eddie Niedzwiecki, the coaching staff alongside him,\n5:41 Comment: really like to play nicely and quickly in between the pockets\n5:44 Comment: and really zip their passes about.\n5:50 Comment: Mbula.\n5:53 Comment: Walshide.\n5:55 Comment: Afelaj.\n5:57 Comment: Losing out to Mikel.\n5:59 Comment: Chelsea get the free kick.\n6:11 Comment: I think Afelaj's got an important role to play in there,\n6:14 Comment: he's either got to sit on Matic or Mikel.\n6:16 Comment: You can see already, just sitting off,\n6:18 Comment: letting the centre-backs have it.\n6:22 Comment: Just Afelaj then engaging maybe Mikel or Matic\n6:24 Comment: when it gets into that midfield area.\n6:33 Comment: Willian.\n6:36 Comment: Chances on Foroska.\n6:40 Comment: That was a good ball, wasn't it, Willian?\n6:42 Comment: Nearly catches Cameron out,\n6:43 Comment: he's just sucked in a little bit too close to his centre-backs here.\n6:48 Comment: Just realises in time, but just driven a little bit too hard by Willian.\n6:53 Comment: What a great strike that was from the keeper, wasn't it?\n6:55 Comment: Jack Butlan really drove that in.\n6:58 Comment: Halfway into the Chelsea half.\n7:0 Comment: Off the floor, really great strike.\n7:3 Comment: Made it a bit easier for Willian.\n7:6 Comment: Butlan, he's got to be careful.\n7:8 Comment: He's got to be careful.\n7:21 Comment: Great strike.\n7:23 Comment: Amazing how far they can hit these balls now.\n7:29 Comment: Jack Butlan has been outstanding for Stoke this season.\n7:34 Comment: This is his 150th appearance in club football, he's only 22.\n7:40 Comment: Good goalkeeping at the other end by Courtois as well.\n7:45 Comment: Had to react smartly then as Andrautevic made his run.\n7:52 Comment: Hands out.\n7:55 Comment: Oscar.\n7:58 Comment: Shaqiri was unlucky there.\n8:0 Comment: Really good ball for Andrautevic.\n8:3 Comment: Aspela Kressa did really well coming round on the cover,\n8:5 Comment: but again a demonstration of the two wide players,\n8:8 Comment: how they like to hit each other from opposite sides.\n8:12 Comment: Just trying to get in behind centre-backs,\n8:14 Comment: or in between centre-backs and full-backs.\n8:19 Comment: Half a lap.\n8:21 Comment: Now Whelan.\n8:27 Comment: Now fly again at the centre of things for Stoke.\n8:31 Comment: Mbula giving Oscar the slip.\n8:39 Comment: It is a measure of the progress that Stoke have made,\n8:41 Comment: that they were able to go out and spend over £18 million\n8:45 Comment: on Gianelli Mbula, the French Under-21 international.\n8:48 Comment: Year on year there's been improvement for Stoke.\n8:53 Comment: Initially with Tony Poulos and now with Mark Hughes in charge.\n8:57 Comment: Whelan.\n8:58 Comment: Oscar.\n9:3 Comment: Traore.\n9:4 Comment: Looking again for Oscar, who's onside.\n9:6 Comment: Here's Whelan.\n9:9 Comment: Lovely work by Whelan.\n9:11 Comment: Oscar.\n9:12 Comment: Traore.\n9:16 Comment: Eased away eventually by Malcevic and here, Peters.\n9:21 Comment: Just delayed the pass a fraction too long there, Oscar.\n9:23 Comment: Really good a bit of combination play from Whelan and Oscar\n9:27 Comment: to get in behind.\n9:29 Comment: Given away by Afelaj.\n9:31 Comment: Given straight to Azad.\n9:33 Comment: Shaqiri.\n9:34 Comment: Giving Pabba the runaround.\n9:39 Comment: Jouf.\n9:46 Comment: Shaqiri.\n10:2 Comment: Cameron, who's only just back after a long spell on the sidelines\n10:5 Comment: with an ankle complaint.\n10:6 Comment: He was saying that he was sore again on Wednesday evening\n10:9 Comment: but needs must at the moment for Stoke defensively.\n10:23 Comment: Azad.\n10:27 Comment: Now Willian.\n10:30 Comment: Mikel.\n10:33 Comment: Cameron with the interception.\n10:44 Comment: Stoke took advantage of the break that they had during the\n10:48 Comment: last round of the FA Cup, the fifth round to go to Dubai.\n10:51 Comment: Came back refreshed and defeated the bottom club Aston Villa\n10:55 Comment: with two goals from Marko and Artjavic.\n11:3 Comment: Shaqiri.\n11:9 Comment: Given away by Macic.\n11:23 Comment: Three successive Premier League wins for Stoke City.\n11:25 Comment: Before that, they'd gone four Premier League games without a win.\n11:29 Comment: Four games without a win or a goal.\n11:31 Comment: A sequence which produced just one point but they seem to have\n11:34 Comment: got their season back on track now.\n11:40 Comment: Artjavic, offside.\n11:42 Comment: Well, in the early stages of this game, I know we're only 12\n11:44 Comment: minutes in but Stoke had a better passing side.\n11:48 Comment: You can see how much they've worked on their play, Mark using\n11:51 Comment: his staff.\n11:52 Comment: It just doesn't come overnight, a change of style but it's\n11:56 Comment: really do zip it about.\n11:58 Comment: Mosca, picked out by Willian.\n12:1 Comment: Looking for Hazard.\n12:3 Comment: Helped away by Munier.\n12:15 Comment: Fijians.\n12:17 Comment: And Artjavic.\n12:26 Comment: On point flicked by Artjavic which didn't come off.\n12:53 Comment: Shaqiri.\n12:57 Comment: Lovely ball that was, reverse pass.\n13:0 Comment: Shaqiri's left footed plan on this right hand side.\n13:3 Comment: So everything they do, they just play on his back foot.\n13:6 Comment: So he's protecting the ball from the fullback.\n13:10 Comment: Lovely play, comes in off the flank.\n13:12 Comment: Now look at this for a reverse pass.\n13:13 Comment: Good spot, Dufus in behind.\n13:15 Comment: Would have been a close call.\n13:17 Comment: Just a fraction over here.\n13:19 Comment: Loves to come inside asking the fullback the question.\n13:23 Comment: Looks one way, passes the other.\n13:24 Comment: Dufus just can't quite get on to it.\n13:34 Comment: That was pulled by Munier.\n13:36 Comment: Mikel.\n13:40 Comment: Willian, taking on Peters.\n13:42 Comment: Mikel.\n13:45 Comment: Well there's your sitting midfield player.\n13:48 Comment: Making the top tier of the Chelsea stand.\n13:50 Comment: At the shed end.\n13:52 Comment: Well played Willian.\n13:54 Comment: But I'm sure if he'd have thought he was passing it back to Mikel there.\n13:57 Comment: Look, that's the difference when you're a defensive midfield player.\n14:0 Comment: You're totally on your heels.\n14:5 Comment: Diego Costa, unimpressed.\n14:7 Comment: Giannopoli Micalu did score in the Champions League.\n14:10 Comment: In Paris in the first leg of that round of 16 fixture.\n14:15 Comment: And he's got a good shot.\n14:16 Comment: Micalu didn't have a look in.\n14:18 Comment: With Jose Mourinho in charge during the first half of the season.\n14:23 Comment: Shaqiri.\n14:42 Comment: Shaqiri, a good shot.\n14:44 Comment: Shaqiri has just had a quiet word with those on the Stoke City bench.\n14:49 Comment: Hands up.\n14:51 Comment: At the La Quinta.\n14:57 Comment: Well someone like Matisz is going to have to join the front players.\n15:1 Comment: They're going to hit crosses in.\n15:4 Comment: Half a lie.\n15:6 Comment: Now Duf.\n15:13 Comment: Duf.\n15:23 Comment: This will be a problem as well for Glenn Whelan who broke his nose against\n15:27 Comment: Aston Villa last weekend.\n15:29 Comment: Did try wearing a face mask.\n15:32 Comment: Something which is very much in vogue in the Premier League at the moment.\n15:35 Comment: Training on Monday and Tuesday but discarded it for the league fixture\n15:39 Comment: on Wednesday against Newcastle.\n15:41 Comment: And he's done without it again today.\n15:45 Comment: Once more and out of each offside.\n15:47 Comment: Not for the first time in this first half.\n15:50 Comment: Yeah Whelan was just involved in the challenge.\n15:54 Comment: Just with John Ovi Micalu.\n15:56 Comment: Maybe just a little bit late on him.\n15:58 Comment: Caught his foot.\n16:0 Comment: You can see he was stretching into the challenge.\n16:2 Comment: He was always going to win it.\n16:4 Comment: Just caught a little bit of a glancing blow.\n16:8 Comment: Glenn Whelan one of three.\n16:10 Comment: Three ever presents for Stoke this season.\n16:12 Comment: Along with Eric Peters and Jack Dutton.\n16:16 Comment: How's that?\n16:21 Comment: Oscar.\n16:23 Comment: Hit his own team mate.\n16:25 Comment: And that's a good in the way of that shot.\n16:41 Comment: Chelsea beginning to find some fluency.\n16:43 Comment: Oscar.\n16:49 Comment: Peters.\n16:51 Comment: Pursued by Traore.\n17:11 Comment: Trojan.\n17:34 Comment: Austin.\n17:36 Comment: еР\n17:36 Comment: from any a sir great little turn from Oscar very difficult the mini ace and\n17:43 Comment: not so touchy I mean to give away the penalty but great tight turn you can see\n17:47 Comment: turns really well difficult to score from there though try always there just\n17:52 Comment: in case butlin spilt it\n17:55 Comment: in bullet\n18:2 Comment: buffalo looks a player doesn't he in Bula really good on the ball doesn't\n18:8 Comment: panic it doesn't have to release it he just doesn't release it for it doing its\n18:13 Comment: sake really good pass with a bull here's a polite turned away by court to up\n18:22 Comment: impressive shot equal by the safe yeah good strike lovely height though for\n18:27 Comment: course well but six foot seven maybe difficult to beat from there doesn't\n18:33 Comment: risk catching it but makes real sure getting it away from the danger area\n18:37 Comment: good stiff hands to get it away with the my security go keep a stretching and he\n18:46 Comment: needed the assistant of after like way to to get the ball to safety for Chelsea\n18:52 Comment: I think he is struggling moves me a little bit you can see him hobbling a\n18:56 Comment: little bit there's Shikiri but just played the little short kick routine\n19:0 Comment: just to move the defenders about a bit but good defending on the far post\n19:5 Comment: out of it almost on the goal line Cameron Ford with Volsci money a set\n19:24 Comment: was catching the killer one in many a sir at the other\n19:30 Comment: nice start to the game though good passing from both teams Chelsea obviously\n19:34 Comment: lacking a big striker today so gonna find it difficult and also like in John\n19:41 Comment: Terry everybody's wondering maybe be fit for that PSG game but I think Chelsea\n19:46 Comment: may keep it the same because John's a mr. good few weeks now be a hard game to\n19:52 Comment: come back to hamstring problem for John Terry hamstring problem as well for\n19:58 Comment: Pedro another one who's not been considered today good zoom of the other\n20:3 Comment: long-term absentee with knee ligament damage which will keep him out of the\n20:8 Comment: European Championships in France this summer it knows it will be there with\n20:15 Comment: Belgium\n20:28 Comment: I\n20:35 Comment: Oscar\n20:39 Comment: William\n20:45 Comment: Oscar\n20:48 Comment: Nicked away by Mbule.\n20:52 Comment: Djuff.\n20:53 Comment: Now Afelaj.\n20:55 Comment: It's a break of great promise this for Stoke.\n20:58 Comment: Djuff!\n21:0 Comment: Glorious opportunity for Stoke.\n21:3 Comment: What a great play that was.\n21:5 Comment: Mbule from defence slid it into Djuff, great ball to start it off.\n21:9 Comment: And look at this for a ball from Afelaj, outside of the foot,\n21:13 Comment: and Djuff doesn't keep it down.\n21:15 Comment: Just gets on top of that, that's 1-0 for Stoke.\n21:18 Comment: Great movement from front to back in about 3 or 4 passes,\n21:21 Comment: but look at that for a final ball.\n21:23 Comment: Wonderful pass, should really have scored.\n21:26 Comment: I know he's on the stretch, but you've got to get down and over that,\n21:29 Comment: even when you're stretching.\n21:31 Comment: Top goal scorers, I think, would have scored that one.\n21:36 Comment: There's medical assistance for both Stoke players involved there.\n21:41 Comment: Djuff is now back on his feet, he is OK.\n21:45 Comment: But there's clear concern of Afelaj, who was really stretching,\n21:49 Comment: as you said, Tony, to deliver that cross.\n21:52 Comment: He took it really well, it's a difficult technique,\n21:55 Comment: he took it off to what you call the front foot, Tony.\n21:57 Comment: So he's maybe just stretched his hamstring slightly on the other side.\n22:1 Comment: Maybe slipped on impact, unless he's done his fingers.\n22:6 Comment: Yeah, they're nasty.\n22:9 Comment: Cracked them back into place at half-time.\n22:12 Comment: Oh, dear.\n22:15 Comment: Yeah, and the fingers, yeah, strap them all together.\n22:29 Comment: Great chance, really good play from Mbula at the start of it.\n22:33 Comment: Mbula started it, he broke play up, fed it in straight away to Djuff,\n22:38 Comment: and it just carried on from there.\n22:40 Comment: Great stuff from Stoke.\n22:42 Comment: Like you were saying beforehand, that he felt that Mbula's pace\n22:46 Comment: could cause Chelsea one or two problems.\n22:51 Comment: Walters put in a real shift up front for Stoke on Wednesday.\n22:55 Comment: You've just got to take those chances, aren't you,\n22:57 Comment: when you come to places like this.\n22:59 Comment: Great play to open them up, but you've got to take the chance.\n23:7 Comment: Afelaj now back on.\n23:12 Comment: Matic.\n23:16 Comment: Oscar.\n23:18 Comment: Hazard.\n23:23 Comment: Here's Djuff.\n23:29 Comment: He ties the challenge from Baba.\n23:36 Comment: It's a free kick which Stoke have taken quickly, too quickly.\n23:42 Comment: It's something they like to do, though.\n23:44 Comment: They like to try quick free kicks or quick balls in general play,\n23:48 Comment: just from Anatovic coming in off that left-hand side\n23:51 Comment: and trying to get him in between the centre-back and the full-back.\n23:55 Comment: OK, he's down as a left-sided player.\n23:58 Comment: He's right-footed, loves to come inside and get his shots away.\n24:11 Comment: Matic.\n24:17 Comment: Anatovic back to trap the runner.\n24:19 Comment: Afelaj-Kueta missed the win at Bournemouth because of illness\n24:22 Comment: but bounced back with two goals against Aston Villa last weekend.\n24:34 Comment: He's hit in charge until the end of the season.\n24:36 Comment: He's made it clear that he doesn't see himself\n24:39 Comment: in Chelsea's long-term future at the age of 69 now.\n24:43 Comment: It's a speculation about who will take over.\n24:46 Comment: Antonio Conte, the Italian national coach, among the favourites.\n24:51 Comment: Along with Diego Simeone at Atletico Madrid.\n25:2 Comment: A little bit of a knee in the back here from Gary Kael.\n25:5 Comment: You can see he's just preferring to volley it out wide.\n25:9 Comment: Just catches him in the back.\n25:28 Comment: Love the angle which he's running at here, Shaqiri.\n25:30 Comment: He's going to go the other way.\n25:32 Comment: He'll come out to his right-hand side.\n25:34 Comment: But look at the way he's shaping up.\n25:36 Comment: Looks like he's going to hit it over the signage on the far side.\n25:41 Comment: Swept in by Shaqiri.\n25:43 Comment: He's helped on by Cameron.\n25:45 Comment: He comes right across it on impact, doesn't he?\n25:49 Comment: And they know exactly where it's going, the Stoke players.\n25:51 Comment: There you go, right around the corner.\n26:0 Comment: He's caught by Cameron.\n26:2 Comment: Oh dear.\n26:4 Comment: Fair old shout though, wasn't it?\n26:6 Comment: Eh?\n26:11 Comment: Hazard definitely caught, but there was a big yield.\n26:21 Comment: Mikel.\n26:31 Comment: Danovic.\n26:36 Comment: Mikel.\n26:40 Comment: Hazard.\n26:47 Comment: Solid challenge again by Cameron.\n26:56 Comment: Danovic losing out to Maspelaqueta.\n26:59 Comment: Willian!\n27:4 Comment: Well, it's great defending from Maspelaqueta\n27:6 Comment: because he's not easy to wrestle the ball off and out of it.\n27:9 Comment: Cross-field ball, he's got to defend it better.\n27:12 Comment: But look, great nick.\n27:13 Comment: And when you nick it there, it puts you straight into the back four.\n27:16 Comment: Willian's unlucky on the drive.\n27:18 Comment: Although Butler looked like he always had it covered.\n27:21 Comment: He's just cutting across it slightly on his left peg.\n27:23 Comment: Makes it go wide.\n27:25 Comment: Good strike.\n27:27 Comment: Even when Chelsea were struggling during the early part of the season,\n27:31 Comment: Willian was one of their shining lights.\n27:47 Comment: The play's going to be stopped here because Jeff Cameron\n27:50 Comment: was hit in the head by the ball.\n27:56 Comment: Joe! Joe!\n28:2 Comment: Just goes in on the floor.\n28:3 Comment: And then whack from about a yard out.\n28:5 Comment: Even though the balls are a lot softer nowadays, that still hurts.\n28:12 Comment: And dazzled a bit.\n28:20 Comment: Good start from Stoke.\n28:22 Comment: Coming up to about the half-hour mark,\n28:24 Comment: foul, Mark Toney, but I think they've started really well.\n28:27 Comment: Shown that they can play the best teams at their own game,\n28:30 Comment: play some good football, Stoke City.\n28:32 Comment: And the introduction of some quality players,\n28:35 Comment: particularly the lad in midfield in Bula,\n28:37 Comment: the last of the sign-ins.\n28:40 Comment: I think he looks quality,\n28:41 Comment: probably looks a little bit better than\n28:43 Comment: maybe the Chelsea holding midfield players\n28:45 Comment: in Mikel and Matic.\n28:46 Comment: He's got a little bit more about him on the ball.\n28:49 Comment: Looks like a real steal for me.\n28:51 Comment: It was a gap that Stoke wanted to fill after Steven Nzonzi\n28:55 Comment: decided to leave the club and go to Spain and join Sevilla.\n28:59 Comment: Looks like a good swap.\n29:4 Comment: Cameron back on.\n29:7 Comment: Knocked on by Juv.\n29:9 Comment: Shaqiri.\n29:12 Comment: Shaqiri looking for help and is yet not his fourth coming.\n29:17 Comment: Good defending Gary Cahill, just looks at the ball there.\n29:20 Comment: Wasn't having any of the Mikel Flatley tactics.\n29:36 Comment: Shaqiri.\n29:39 Comment: In by Cameron.\n29:40 Comment: Out by Cahill.\n29:49 Comment: How's that?\n30:7 Comment: Back, back.\n30:14 Comment: See how difficult it is for Chelsea without someone like Fabregas\n30:17 Comment: to instigate the moves from deep.\n30:20 Comment: And obviously someone like Costa up front to hold the ball in there.\n30:33 Comment: How's that?\n30:36 Comment: Tried it offside.\n30:37 Comment: Yeah, good line and Youngster a little bit sucked into it there,\n30:40 Comment: Troy Orre.\n30:41 Comment: Great opportunity for him this afternoon,\n30:43 Comment: starting up front.\n30:44 Comment: He was on the right-hand side in midweek and\n30:47 Comment: got about 70 minutes and today starting.\n30:50 Comment: And this is what Chelsea wanted to see more of.\n31:0 Comment: Fabregas among the Chelsea substitutes today.\n31:7 Comment: Just in conversation there with Hoselu, the Spaniard who's on the bench for Stoke.\n31:17 Comment: William.\n31:21 Comment: How's that?\n31:28 Comment: At the Ligueta.\n31:30 Comment: Mikel. William.\n31:41 Comment: Peters.\n31:43 Comment: Zouf.\n31:50 Comment: Just too much pace on the pass for Anatovic.\n31:53 Comment: But Stoke threatening again on the break.\n31:59 Comment: Mosca.\n32:0 Comment: Looking the better of the two teams at the moment.\n32:6 Comment: Another great shot from Medina.\n32:8 Comment: The ball is bounced straight back here to Hazard.\n32:10 Comment: Troy Orre waits.\n32:12 Comment: Mosca.\n32:13 Comment: Troy Orre.\n32:15 Comment: Now William.\n32:17 Comment: Initial block by Muniesa and then Peters.\n32:23 Comment: At the Ligueta.\n32:26 Comment: William.\n32:27 Comment: Onside. Three to pick out.\n32:28 Comment: And it bounces away.\n32:30 Comment: Off Butlun for a Chelsea corner.\n32:32 Comment: Well, he didn't have a chance to get his hands raised there, Jack

playing up against the likes of Whelan,\n27:39 Comment: one of the more experienced players in the Premier League,\n27:42 Comment: using his body well, holding him off,\n27:44 Comment: and Whelan eventually fouling him.\n27:46 Comment: But, again, it's real good experience,\n27:48 Comment: all this under-21 football they play,\n27:50 Comment: it's all without any physical contact,\n27:52 Comment: without any, shall we say, know-how\n27:55 Comment: from seasoned players,\n27:57 Comment: but playing up against this is much better for these young boys,\n28:1 Comment: they're getting great, great experience.\n28:14 Comment: Whelan still arguing his defence.\n28:17 Comment: Butlin wants a bit more defence,\n28:19 Comment: wants a bit more protection in that defensive wall.\n28:25 Comment: And here's Whelan.\n28:30 Comment: And Whelan has scored with six free kicks already this season.\n28:35 Comment: It is Whelan, and Butlin's in trouble.\n28:40 Comment: Whelan normally goes for the other corner with these free kicks,\n28:42 Comment: but maybe he was trying to double-guess Butlin,\n28:45 Comment: but he's got that comfortably covered.\n28:48 Comment: Had it hit the target, it would have been an easy take, easy catch.\n28:52 Comment: And it's going to start there.\n28:55 Comment: Well, enterprising move this year, holding midfield player.\n29:1 Comment: Boyan coming on, so real enterprising move.\n29:5 Comment: That means Afolai goes a little bit deeper with Mboula,\n29:10 Comment: and Boyan will be playing just in behind.\n29:12 Comment: So, Stoke looking to get back into this game.\n29:16 Comment: Positive move.\n29:20 Comment: Boyan has sat out the last four Premier League games.\n29:25 Comment: He's really wearing his first season with Stoke City\n29:28 Comment: until he picked up a knee injury on Outovic.\n29:42 Comment: Boyan has spent the best part of eight months on the sidelines\n29:45 Comment: after he picked up that injury against Rochdale in the FA Cup\n29:49 Comment: at the start of last year.\n29:54 Comment: That was a good one.\n29:55 Comment: Afolai has been preferred for much of this season\n29:56 Comment: since Boyan returned to full fitness.\n30:8 Comment: Shakira.\n30:11 Comment: Now, Boyan offside.\n30:14 Comment: Well, it's a great little ball from one little man to another.\n30:19 Comment: Shakira to Boyan.\n30:22 Comment: You can see, look, he's going to spot the run if it's made.\n30:24 Comment: It's coming.\n30:25 Comment: From deep.\n30:26 Comment: He's holding his arm.\n30:27 Comment: Oh, that is ever so close.\n30:29 Comment: Ever so close.\n30:31 Comment: Stoke a little bit unfortunate there.\n30:54 Comment: Stoke.\n30:54 Comment: Very straightaway suggestion from Mark Lattenberg\n30:56 Comment: that Boyan had used his arm as well to control the through ball.\n31:7 Comment: Even that was close.\n31:8 Comment: Yes.\n31:18 Comment: Given the start of the season which Chelsea had\n31:20 Comment: and the disruption that filtered through the club before Christmas,\n31:24 Comment: when Jose Mourinho left,\n31:26 Comment: there's plenty to play for when you consider they've got the Champions League this coming week\n31:29 Comment: and also the sixth round of the FA Cup competition,\n31:33 Comment: which goes hitting one in his first spell in charge.\n31:35 Comment: And they've lost just one of the 24 games that he's taken control of\n31:42 Comment: and his two spells with Chelsea.\n31:44 Comment: And he's got it.\n31:45 Comment: He's got it.\n32:7

Mark Clattenburg I think has given him the benefit of the doubt\n34:19 Comment: and may be saying\n34:19 Comment: well did Oscar make a little bit too much of it\n34:23 Comment: but\n34:23 Comment: I don't know if he's going to make it\n34:23 Comment: That's so easily a second yellow.\n34:26 Comment: Ivanovic quickly over there to try and get it for him.\n34:30 Comment: Which is no business of his.\n34:32 Comment: But there we go, in it, round the corner.\n34:35 Comment: And you can see, definitely clips him with his right foot.\n34:39 Comment: And maybe a shade fortunate not to get a second yellow.\n34:44 Comment: Eric Peters pointing out to Ivanovic that he tried to pull out of the challenge.\n34:53 Comment: Matich.\n34:56 Comment: He knew where the ball was when Shaqiri

    "summary": "The Barclays Premier League match between Chelsea and Stoke City concluded with a score of 1-1 in an engaging and action-packed game at Stamford Bridge. With only ten games left in the season, both teams were eager to secure points to achieve their respective goals: Chelsea aiming to extend their positive run under interim manager Guus Hiddink and Stoke City fighting for a spot in next season’s UEFA Europa League.\n\nThe first half saw a mix of strategic prowess and missed opportunities from both sides. Chelsea, buoyed by their recent undefeated streak in the league, came out with a relatively dynamic line-up despite resting key players such as Cesc Fabregas and Diego Costa. The young forward Bertrand Traore was given the nod to lead the attack, replacing Costa, and it soon became evident why. Traore, who had impressed in the prior fixture against Norwich, looked sharp and eager to make the most of his chance starting in a central role.\n\nStoke, on the other hand, fielded a solid team even though they were missing crucial defensive personnel like Ryan Shawcross and Glen Johnson. Their recent form had been commendable, coming into this match with three consecutive victories. Swiss international Xherdan Shaqiri, a noteworthy figure in the Stoke line-up, demonstrated why the club invested heavily in him despite his uneven spell at Inter Milan the previous season.\n\nThe match kicked off with a hefty pace, and within just two minutes, Chelsea was already signaling their intent with incisive passing and attacking maneuvers. As the first half progressed, Chelsea displayed a blend of assertive ball-play and quick transitions, complemented by the likes of Eden Hazard, Oscar, and Willian. However, it was Stoke who seemed more assertive in their passing, dictating the tempo with swift exchanges, especially between Shaqiri, Ibrahim Afellay, and Gianelli Imbula.\n\nStoke’s best early chance came when Imbula picked out a brilliant pass to Shaqiri, whose cross was comfortably claimed by Thibaut Courtois. Chelsea responded with a near miss through Traore, who failed to connect properly with an astutely delivered pass, shooting an \"air\" volley that otherwise could have drawn first blood.\n\nPossession fluctuated between the two sides, with Stoke showcasing their adaptability by pressing Chelsea effectively. Chelsea’s Branislav Ivanovic’s long searching passes and Cesar Azpilicueta’s darting runs down the flank caused some nervous moments for the Stoke defense. Chelsea began to find rhythm, though they lacked the clinical edge in the attacking third despite several key build-ups.\n\nMidway through the first half, Stoke dialed up the intensity. A notable highlight was Courtois making a fine save in reaction to an audacious run and shot by Marko Anautovic. Soon after, Chelsea had another promising stint as Willian, and Oscar combined well within Stoke’s half, resulting in a near breakthrough. Conversely, Stoke’s robust defense, meticulously helmed by Phillip Wollscheid and Marc Muniesa, held firm against Chelsea’s penetrating moves.\n\nJust before the halftime whistle, an exciting passage of play erupted. Traore who had shone in patches, managed to capitalize on a quick interchange and turn past Stoke's defenders, unleashing a venomous left-footed strike past the outstretched Butland. The goal was a testament to Traore's flair and precision, putting Chelsea 1-0 ahead.\n\nThe second half started with Stoke showing renewed zeal. Their attacks became more coordinated, leveraging the creativity and agility of their midfield maestros. Chelsea, holding onto their slim advantage, continued to press but were cautious to avoid defensive lapses. Peter Odemwingie and Ibrahim Afellay produced bursts of inspired play, keeping Chelsea’s defense alert.\n\nThroughout the second half, Stoke City would not relent in their pursuit of an equalizer. Possession remained equally contested. Chelsea’s defensive linchpins, Gary Cahill and Ivanovic, were called into action multiple times, keeping out several Stoke attempts. Afellay had a well-struck shot palmed away by Courtois, evidence of the Belgian goalkeeper’s exceptional performance on the day.\n\nAs the game approached the final quarter, Stoke made a strategic substitution, bringing on the creative forward Bojan Krkic to intensify their attacking threat. This change bore fruit in the dying embers of the match. In a quick sequence initiated by Shaqiri down the right flank, a well-placed cross was put into a dangerous area. Courtois managed to parry it, but unfortunately for him, it fell right into the path of Mame Diouf who made no mistake in heading home the equalizer, making it 1-1.\n\nThe dramatic finale saw end-to-end football with both sides seeking a late winner. Chelsea tried to employ their substitutes, with seasoned playmaker Cesc Fabregas and the lively Loic Remy coming on to provide fresh legs and experience. William, perhaps Chelsea's standout player this season, orchestrated several late attacks but was continually met with stout defending by Peters and Wollscheid.\n\nAnother opportunity arose when Loftus-Cheek, showing a good burst of pace and understanding of the game, was brought down in the penalty area, with calls for a penalty being waved off by the referee, Mark Clattenburg. The decision prompted heated debates but ultimately went unpunished.\n\nAs the final whistle blew, both teams had shown resilience and competitive spirit. Chelsea sitting eighth on the table with their unbeaten streak intact under Hiddink will focus on their forthcoming Champions League tie. Stoke City would be heartened by their late comeback, maintaining their charge towards European football qualification through steady, determined performances.\n\nAll in all, the match was an excellent watch, filled with tactical ingenuity, individual brilliance, and a relentless drive from both sides, culminating in a well-deserved 1-1 draw that highlighted the competitive nature of the Premier League."
