Coates and Cabral, since they've come to the club\n3:26 Comment: And as soon as Sam came in he'd given them that little bit of insurance\n3:29 Comment: By playing one in between them\n3:30 Comment: They do make a mistake, they have got that insurance of the experienced man behind them\n3:38 Comment: He missed a bit late here on Pedro as he just clips through Toivonen and catches him\n3:50

who's been bang out of form this season, Ivanovic\n6:3 Comment: Wasn't it going to be the way that one of the most out of players forms\n6:6 Comment: It's, he's left Mourinho, goes and scores the goal\n6:11 Comment: Good header though it was\n6:13 Comment: Really the marking should have been better in that penalty area\n6:16 Comment: Perfect start for those boys and just lightens the load on the likes of\n6:19 Comment: Eddie Newton and Steve Holland down there\n6:22 Comment: Steve Holland and Eddie Newton in charge for just the one game before\n6:26 Comment: Gus Hiddink takes over\n6:32 Comment: Eddie Hiddink's second spell as a\n6:35 Comment: Tenthly manager at Chelsea, he's got the job until the end of the season\n6:38 Comment: He was offered it after he had a successful spell here\n6:42 Comment: When he took Chelsea to the Champions League semi-final and then FA Cup success\n6:49 Comment: He's suggesting that his stock had dropped somewhat after\n6:52 Comment: Disappointment with the Netherlands and Turkey and Russia as well before that\n7:1 Comment: He's been tightening the challenge in earning Chelsea the free kick\n7:4 Comment: It's the perfect start for Chelsea isn't it, does take the sting out of the crowd somewhat\n7:9 Comment: Perfect start for them\n7:12 Comment: Sam Allardyce would be absolutely livid conceding such a\n7:15 Comment: Maybe soft goal at a set piece like that, straight in\n7:18 Comment: One header, Kepa Pantelimon had no chance but the marking was really poor\n7:26 Comment: Someone showing their vulnerability at the back\n7:28 Comment: 31 goals they've now conceded, the same as Bournemouth and Newcastle\n7:39 Comment: William still complaining that the Sunderland Wall hasn't retreated far enough\n7:45 Comment: No spread, is that the suggestion?\n7:48 Comment: William and Zouma the two over this, it's William and it's easy enough for Pantelimon\n8:13 Comment: Wall certainly didn't look 10 yards away but easy picking for Pantelimon there\n8:18 Comment: Straight down his throat from William\n8:27 Comment: Ivanovic\n8:37 Comment: Asperler-Koethe, kept in play by Tedrova, that wasn't to Chelsea's advantage\n8:46 Comment: Watmoth\n8:48 Comment: Good recovery by Oscar\n9:20 Comment: Even referees can be forgetful\n9:24 Comment: Rodman\n9:26 Comment: Now Tedra\n9:34 Comment: Van Anoos\n9:36 Comment: For McChelsey Jr\n9:41 Comment: Just taking that sting off the cross\n9:43 Comment: I don't think he actually meant it, he may have said something\n9:46 Comment: William, Oscar\n9:50 Comment: Chelsea playing with a flourish\n9:54 Comment: Oscar\n9:56 Comment: That was too elaborate\n9:59 Comment: I was just looking at the penalty area, that's been one of the main complaints from Marine Yoan\n10:5 Comment: He's been complaining about the penalty area\n10:10 Comment: I was just looking at the penalty area, that's been one of the main complaints from Marine Yoan\n10:15 Comment: And the staff that Diego Costa hasn't been committing himself enough to the penalty area\n10:20 Comment: Staying too far out in the wings, not getting him where it hurts\n10:24 Comment: That time he was in that penalty area, in and around it but still need to commit more players to it\n10:32 Comment: Diego Costa was on target when Chelsea defeated Sunderland at the end of last season having claimed the title\n10:41 Comment: Pedro\n10:43 Comment: Again by Diego Costa\n10:46 Comment: Real urgency from Chelsea in these early stages\n10:53 Comment: Ivanovic, kicked down by Oscar\n10:58 Comment: Diego Costa\n11:0 Comment: Ivanovic again\n11:2 Comment: Tordman got back to him\n11:3 Comment: There's not any respite for Sunderland at the moment\n11:6 Comment: They're struggling to get out of their own half\n11:12 Comment: That's exactly what they didn't want Sunderland, an early goal\n11:14 Comment: Just said the first 15 or 20 was key but Chelsea scoring that early goal has really put it on Sunderland\n11:20 Comment: They've got to hang on him here now for the next 5 or 10\n11:24 Comment: Diego Costa\n11:25 Comment: Oscar\n11:27 Comment: Back with Oscar\n11:29 Comment: Pedro\n11:32 Comment: Up the back right there\n11:35 Comment: Fabregas\n11:39 Comment: Just a little bit too elaborate again\n11:41 Comment: Sometimes you've just got to put the ball in the back of the net\n11:44 Comment: And then you've got to get the ball back in the net\n11:52 Comment: A little bit too elaborate again\n11:54 Comment: Sometimes you've just got to put the ball in that area\n11:56 Comment: If the centre forward Costa is getting in there\n11:58 Comment: You've got to give him something to attack\n12:4 Comment: Oscar\n12:6 Comment: Pedro\n12:9 Comment: Ivanovic again, picked out\n12:13 Comment: It's come to Pedro\n12:15 Comment: 2-0 for Chelsea\n12:18 Comment: 2 in under 13 minutes\n12:22 Comment: Chelsea 2-0\n12:30 Comment: The shot but couldn't keep it out\n12:32 Comment: Chelsea are flying\n12:34 Comment: Well there's that commitment to the penalty area that I'm talking about\n12:36 Comment: Good switch of play from Pedro out to Ivanovic\n12:39 Comment: He follows the ball into the area\n12:40 Comment: In it goes to Costa\n12:41 Comment: 3 players commit themselves\n12:43 Comment: Falls to Pedro\n12:45 Comment: And bang it's in the back of the net\n12:46 Comment: That's no coincidence\n12:48 Comment: Chelsea haven't been committed players there\n12:49 Comment: They did\n12:50 Comment: And Pedro finishes well\n12:52 Comment: 2-0 Chelsea\n12:54 Comment: And there's cluster where he should be in and around that six-yard area ball falls down to Pedro bang back at the net\n13:0 Comment: 2-0\n13:5 Comment: It's the first goal that Pedro has scored in the Premier League since he scored on his debut against West Brom back in August\n13:12 Comment: It still hasn't won the Chelsea crowd over again. They're singing Jose Mourinho\n13:22 Comment: I\n13:34 Comment: What about antagonism amongst those watching\n13:40 Comment: Rodwell\n13:44 Comment: Ivanovic\n13:52 Comment: Really has been one of Chelsea's few successes this season\n13:58 Comment: Fabregas\n14:1 Comment: Matich his William\n14:5 Comment: Will be a corner a\n14:7 Comment: Great little ball from Matt it's shape to shoot disguise the shot into a pass into the path of William on side\n14:13 Comment: Shot blocked away for a corner, but again look at those players in and around the area three or four\n14:18 Comment: We haven't been seeing that from Chelsea\n14:22 Comment: So\n14:29 Comment: Some let know that they've got to be a bit more watchful in by William almost neck by John Terry\n14:39 Comment: Once again lost of an of its their time he never wasn't looking at the bull\n14:43 Comment: Nearly lost him again like he did for that first cup and by Oscar\n14:48 Comment: The benefits you managed to get the flick on\n14:53 Comment: Well the first goal is a real killer for Sunderland isn't it and it's such a soft one to concede from a set-piece\n14:58 Comment: Coates marking of an of its look poor marking doesn't really have to get up. Oh a great header\n15:3 Comment: Yes, but look at the marking from a six-foot-four center back doesn't get off the floor\n15:9 Comment: That's the delight of the Chelsea staff up there pretty relieved early on in this game\n15:18 Comment: And then of it shoes at his injury problems this season he was hurt while it was away with Serbia\n15:23 Comment: But as we mentioned earlier, he has been out of form particularly in the early weeks of the campaign after a long run of Premier League games\n15:31 Comment: successive starts\n15:38 Comment: Once of course we're way on tour at the end of last season they came back late for preseason training\n15:42 Comment: They struggled in the United States\n15:45 Comment: By the New York Red Bulls\n15:48 Comment: It was effectively a reserve and youth team that the Red Bulls put out with Jose Mourinho shaking his head afterwards\n15:55 Comment: Well, whatever could have gone wrong at Chelsea this season has gone wrong. Tony has met from preseason onwards\n16:2 Comment: just couldn't erode the script for what's happened and\n16:5 Comment: To the point where they were thinking they were worrying worrying about relegation. I mean that was never in doubt for me, but\n16:11 Comment: This team certainly could have been a lot better than what it has been\n16:14 Comment: I\n16:17 Comment: Think the cost of almost getting in\n16:20 Comment: All sorts of problems from day one\n16:23 Comment: To to draw here against Swansea City fallout with the club doctor\n16:28 Comment: Canyaro, which may still end in an employment court\n16:34 Comment: Issues with referees stadium back\n16:45 Comment: Oh\n17:3 Comment: Yeah, go Costa\n17:7 Comment: The shag\n17:9 Comment: I\n17:18 Comment: Think he gets to the stage where some of the crowd are fed up appealing for the penalties Tony, but\n17:24 Comment: Look like he was slightly checked there by John O'Shea, but not a penalty for me\n17:29 Comment: Pedro\n17:33 Comment: William it's come to Ivanovic or nearly dead now. There's a chance for someone to count us swiftly with van Arnold\n17:41 Comment: It\n17:57 Comment: Diego Costa was getting away from Coates Oscar\n18:7 Comment: Magic\n18:12 Comment: Toyvan looking for defo\n18:18 Comment: Good position in Gent so he just gave himself a head start marking the channel instead of the man there\n18:23 Comment: Ensuring that swiveling his ball couldn't curl round him\n18:36 Comment: Oscar\n18:41 Comment: Oh\n18:48 Comment: Dancing way off the heel of Kurt Zuma\n18:50 Comment: Oh\n19:5 Comment: Statements from Chelsea this week including one from Michael\n19:9 Comment: You know the technical director\n19:11 Comment: Where is the challenge on Costa in the box not for me?\n19:15 Comment: John O'Shea just on his ground and a game we find Diego Costa down far so easily\n19:20 Comment: Oh\n19:38 Comment: I Paper does\n19:44 Comment: His mattress\n20:20 Comment: It's something very difficult to get off the Chelsea at the moment.\n20:25 Comment: Obviously the way it was set out, it was to be difficult to break down.\n20:28 Comment: But once you've conceded two early goals, in-game planning slightly goes out the window.\n20:33 Comment: It's just a case of trying to hold it in there now and maybe get to half-time.\n20:37 Comment: But, well, a case of changing it around.\n20:39 Comment: But, as a start, it couldn't have gone much worse for Sam.\n20:51 Comment: Sam Allardyce made a first-half change last weekend when he felt that he got his tactics wrong.\n20:56 Comment: You just wonder, looking at that shot of Sam Allardyce and those moving behind him on the Sunderland bench,\n21:2 Comment: whether or not there might be an early opportunity for Adam Johnson.\n21:20 Comment: Basker.\n21:25 Comment: Fabregas.\n21:34 Comment: Van Arnold.\n21:43 Comment: What's your assessment of some of the statements which have come out from Chelsea this week?\n21:49 Comment: Saying that it's time to act.\n21:51 Comment: Anybody with an affiliation to the club could understand that something had to be done.\n21:56 Comment: That was the view of the board.\n21:59 Comment: Yeah, it just strikes me that the people that were making those comments\n22:4 Comment: maybe shouldn't have been the ones that were making the comments.\n22:7 Comment: Because, I think, first of all, you shouldn't be listening to players\n22:10 Comment: if they're going running to the ball and running to other people.\n22:13 Comment: The only point of contact should be through the manager,\n22:15 Comment: not the eyes and ears of other people who are listening to players.\n22:19 Comment: Well, here is that change.\n22:22 Comment: Sebastian Cuartez has been unwell during the course of the week, he's going off.\n22:26 Comment: But I suspect that this is tactical from Sam Allardyce, Adam Johnson coming on.\n22:32 Comment: Yeah, going back to a back four, Tony, with just O'Shea and Kabul downing.\n22:36 Comment: Sometimes when you play a back three like that, there's only one up against you in Diego Costa.\n22:41 Comment: The runners are coming through the midfield areas.\n22:43 Comment: It tends to be that there's, at times, nobody marking anyone.\n22:47 Comment: So I think this will suit them a little bit better going to a back four.\n22:54 Comment: Willian.\n22:59 Comment: D'Adda.\n23:13 Comment: Fabregas.\n23:17 Comment: Mbula.\n23:30 Comment: It's a little scrap for someone to keep their place in the Premier League at the end of last season.\n23:35 Comment: They didn't really want to repeat this time around.\n23:44 Comment: Johnson.\n23:46 Comment: Now De Feu.\n23:51 Comment: Dovernet.\n23:56 Comment: Johnson's short of alternatives, but one is now provided by Jones.\n24:1 Comment: Just going for a 4-5-1 now, Sandlund, or 4-4-1-1 if you like,\n24:6 Comment: which will have been just in behind De Feu.\n24:8 Comment: But Paulette Johnson on one side gets on the ball, Young-Wat will on the other.\n24:14 Comment: Just get up against this Chelsea midfielder who's been running the game so far.\n24:22 Comment: There have been too many opportunities for Adam Johnson this season.\n24:25 Comment: He's featured off the bench now in the last four games.\n24:30 Comment: De Feu.\n24:46 Comment: Someone who certainly suffered under the Mourinho reign.\n24:49 Comment: Oskar found himself not in the side much.\n24:53 Comment: Maybe he'll get a little bit more of a run now, especially with the injury to Edin Hazard.\n25:0 Comment: Ivanovic.\n25:6 Comment: Fabregas.\n25:11 Comment: Oskar.\n25:15 Comment: It's Oskar, and still he goes on!\n25:18 Comment: And he's denied by Panteleimon.\n25:21 Comment: Yeah, yeah, centre-backs there, the full-backs, the whole of that back four just stood aside\n25:26 Comment: and let him run through as if to say,\n25:28 Comment: you want to score, go and score, but he's kind of reluctant to shoot.\n25:31 Comment: Didn't really have to beat anyone, look, just shifts the ball to the right,\n25:35 Comment: and it just opens up completely.\n25:37 Comment: Awful, awful defending from Sunderland, and in the end he should have scored,\n25:40 Comment: but Panteleimon a good save.\n25:42 Comment: He won't be happy with that, big Sam.\n25:49 Comment: Sunderland has this management built upon organisation and discipline in defence.\n25:56 Comment: Oskar has been able to pick out Ivanovic.\n26:1 Comment: Maybe the coach has made his move.\n26:4 Comment: Willian.\n26:6 Comment: Fabregas.\n26:9 Comment: Oskar.\n26:11 Comment: A little bit cheeky there with that keel, which...\n26:15 Comment: Well, they started well, Chelsea.\n26:16 Comment: ...Pedro.\n26:17 Comment: They started well, Chelsea, their confidence is up,\n26:19 Comment: but Sunderland really are not out of races, are they?\n26:23 Comment: That midfield is getting nowhere near Chelsea at all,\n26:25 Comment: just sitting in the passes in, there's no shield in front of that.\n26:28 Comment: Now a back four instead of a three or the five as it was,\n26:31 Comment: and it's so easy to get through there.\n26:42 Comment: It's not going to get any easier for Sunderland either,\n26:43 Comment: their next fixture is at Manchester City, then they're at home to Liverpool.\n26:47 Comment: At the start of next year, they have a home fixture against Aston Villa,\n26:49 Comment: who are currently propping the table up.\n26:57 Comment: Matitja Toivan.\n27:4 Comment: Half the way by Atalacueta, but only as far as Rodwell.\n27:9 Comment: Jones.\n27:18 Comment: Go on, go on, go on.\n27:19 Comment: Two steps, two steps.\n27:22 Comment: Go on, keep it up, go on.\n27:28 Comment: Villa.\n27:37 Comment: Watnock.\n27:40 Comment: Almost got away from Atalacueta, who was guilty of the foul.\n27:45 Comment: Yeah, lucky not to get a yellow card.\n27:46 Comment: Normally that warrants a yellow card when the player turns,\n27:49 Comment: he gets away as Watmore did, and he cleared a drag back.\n27:52 Comment: This normally is a yellow card, no question.\n27:54 Comment: There you go, complete drag back.\n27:57 Comment: He's lucky to get away with it.\n28:8 Comment: Van Vliet.\n28:9 Comment: Villa.\n28:12 Comment: I suppose we weren't expecting that.\n28:14 Comment: They're very slack from Chelsea on the set-piece.\n28:16 Comment: Let's see if Villa on the outside here gets his cross in.\n28:19 Comment: Terry Ancosta over in on the cover there, but very slack from the set-piece.\n28:23 Comment: Only Pedro out there.\n28:32 Comment: And of course, for the former Chelsea youngster, van Arnoldt.\n28:40 Comment: Watnock.\n28:45 Comment: In the Sunderland throat.\n28:48 Comment: Which has been made the season of the success of Jamie Vardy for Leicester City,\n28:52 Comment: and Sunderland can also point to Duncan Watmore,\n28:55 Comment: a former Manchester United junior who was playing in the non-league\n28:58 Comment: in the North West while he was studying for a university degree.\n29:5 Comment: And he finds himself a Premier League regular.\n29:10 Comment: I think that he's a...\n29:13 Comment: The main thing about him is he's a trier.\n29:15 Comment: When you see these teams down at the bottom, heads down, shoulders slumped.\n29:19 Comment: He's a young lad, this...\n29:21 Comment: Like Watmore comes in, plenty of enthusiasm.\n29:24 Comment: Just wants to get on with the game.\n29:26 Comment: He gives everyone a little bit of a lift.\n29:29 Comment: Schmeichel coming on as a substitute when Jermaine Defoe was injured\n29:33 Comment: against Stoke at the end of November.\n29:35 Comment: Kept his place subsequently.\n29:39 Comment: Hey!\n29:49 Comment: William.\n29:52 Comment: Fabregas.\n29:54 Comment: Diego Costa.\n29:55 Comment: Shoulder to shoulder with O'Shea.\n30:2 Comment: Shoulder to shoulder, Tony, but ends up on the floor again.\n30:5 Comment: Spends half of his time on the floor, Diego Costa.\n30:8 Comment: Really just needs to pinge on O'Shea in there.\n30:11 Comment: Just getting some instructions from Steve Holland down on the line there.\n30:14 Comment: Interesting to see if he listens to him.\n30:18 Comment: Defoe got his measure this season, or defenders got his measure this season?\n30:21 Comment: I don't think he's proved to be a very good listener.\n30:24 Comment: And I don't think it's any disguise in the fact that\n30:29 Comment: he was one of the ones rebelling against the manager.\n30:33 Comment: Oscar.\n30:35 Comment: William.\n30:36 Comment: Oscar again.\n30:46 Comment: Diego Costa got 20 goals in the Premier League last season.\n30:49 Comment: The majority coming in the first half of the campaign\n30:52 Comment: after joining Chelsea from Atletico Madrid.\n30:55 Comment: He's struggling in the second half of the season,\n31:5 Comment: having the recurrence of the hamstring problems,\n31:8 Comment: which bite at the back end of his time in Spain.\n31:14 Comment: He forced him off early in the Champions League final against Real Madrid.\n31:26 Comment: Oscar.\n31:53 Comment: Strong header by John Terry.\n31:56 Comment: Mvira.\n31:58 Comment: Now what more?\n32:1 Comment: Well, he did exceptionally well to just work the ball away from Zouma then.\n32:4 Comment: Well, the first touch was excellent,\n32:6 Comment: but just needed to take another touch out of his stride.\n32:8 Comment: Look, great ball from Mvira, outside of the foot.\n32:10 Comment: He's in here.\n32:12 Comment: Defoe wants the pass, but I think he's right to take it on,\n32:14 Comment: but just needed another touch because the ball's under his feet.\n32:19 Comment: Just needed another touch away from Zouma.\n32:21 Comment: Good run.\n32:25 Comment: Some encouragement at last for Sundlund.\n32:30 Comment: It was a little time against Watford last weekend,\n32:32 Comment: but he did okay at the Emirates against Arsenal a fortnight ago.\n32:37 Comment: A story of missed opportunities, and Sam had a saying afterwards\n32:40 Comment: that maybe if Jermain Defoe had been in from the start\n32:43 Comment: and he'd been given his chance because he was fully fit,\n32:46 Comment: well, Sundlund might have emerged from that game with something.\n32:56 Comment: Come on, lad.\n33:7 Comment: The Acosta still growling.\n33:25 Comment: Oh, no.\n33:36 Comment: O'Shea.\n33:38 Comment: Come on.\n33:43 Comment: O'Shea's got the free kick.\n33:44 Comment: A typical Sam free kick is just to give it a bit of elevation,\n33:48 Comment: and even if defenders win it, they can't get much distance on it\n33:50 Comment: because there's height on the ball, never driven into strikers.\n33:53 Comment: You see this one's helped on, and Defoe trying to pin John Terry,\n33:56 Comment: but really John Terry far too strong for him.\n34:17 Comment: Matic.\n34:23 Comment: Brilliant.\n34:27 Comment: Oscar.\n34:30 Comment: Oscar again.\n34:31 Comment: Diego Acosta.\n34:33 Comment: Brilliant.\n34:34 Comment: Oscar.\n34:36 Comment: Diego Acosta!\n34:41 Comment: Again, imprecisiveness in the heart of that Sundlund defence.\n34:44 Comment: Look, they're allowed it now in Chelsea, two and three touches in there.\n34:47 Comment: Shouldn't be.\n34:48 Comment: Willian Acosta tries to get it across, and Jono Shea has a poor touch,\n34:52 Comment: Acosta strikes it into the ground and over the top.\n34:55 Comment: Again, no-one really getting tight enough to affect the pass.\n34:58 Comment: Poor touch, Jono Shea.\n35:0 Comment: He gets away with it.\n35:1 Comment: Acosta's over the top.\n35:7 Comment: Not a bad couple of games to come in in charge,\n35:9 Comment: with Sundlund and Watford in your first couple of games up.\n35:11 Comment: It was a strange one, maybe, to get rid of Mourinho before these games,\n35:15 Comment: as you wouldn't say that those two at home are probably the hardest on the fixture list,\n35:21 Comment: but I suppose the easiest for a manager coming in, or interim managers to manage,\n35:26 Comment: to try and get everyone on their side.\n35:32 Comment: Chelsea look to recruit in January.\n35:38 Comment: That'd be some talk that Didier Drogba might be returning to Stamford Bridge,\n35:42 Comment: if only to train during the break in the North American season, the MLS.\n35:49 Comment: Pedro.\n35:51 Comment: I think he's a good move, just get him in that dressing room and in amongst the players.\n35:55 Comment: Because I don't think he'll stand for any of the nonsense that's been going on.\n35:59 Comment: Resentment against managers, I think he'll stand up and they'll stand up to be counted as well.\n36:6 Comment: Because he's one of those players who had Chelsea at heart, Tony,\n36:9 Comment: and that's what you've got to be thinking about the football club.\n36:12 Comment: The January window comes open, of course,\n36:14 Comment: but Chelsea, I don't think they've got any chance of qualifying for the Champions League,\n36:18 Comment: so the attraction of players is just money.\n36:21 Comment: So, Champions League, qualifying for that, other than winning it,\n36:24 Comment: is going to be very difficult.\n36:27 Comment: Chelsea are on in the last 16, and for the third season running,\n36:30 Comment: they'll be playing Palestinian man.\n36:36 Comment: They've got one hell of a run to get up there and in amongst those Champions League places,\n36:40 Comment: but there is one consolation about that,\n36:43 Comment: that everyone seems to be beating everyone at the moment, so...\n36:47 Comment: Chances are slim, but...\n36:50 Comment: you've got to go for it.\n36:54 Comment: Jason Miliu was always putting a positive spin on it,\n36:56 Comment: suggesting that Chelsea would be capable of claiming one of the top four positions,\n37:1 Comment: but even he conceded defeat last weekend after Chelsea had been beaten at Leicester.\n37:9 Comment: I mentioned Watford next, but Chelsea beyond that,\n37:12 Comment: they've a trip to Manchester United,\n37:14 Comment: and then they go to South London to take on Crystal Palace.\n37:22 Comment: Brilliant.\n37:24 Comment: Here's Pedro.\n37:26 Comment: Fabregas.\n37:27 Comment: Pedro.\n37:29 Comment: Diego Costa!\n37:31 Comment: The ball just didn't end up exactly where it should be again,\n37:34 Comment: exactly where he hasn't been in his last dozen games or so.\n37:38 Comment: He's in that penalty area, gets up against the ball,\n37:41 Comment: and he's that unlucky on that far post.\n37:43 Comment: You can see good, incisive play, quick play from Chelsea.\n37:46 Comment: Pedro hangs it up for Costa,\n37:48 Comment: and just the coffee could all push him off enough so he can only hit it wide.\n37:53 Comment: Important as a centre-back that you make contact,\n37:55 Comment: even if you don't win it, and he does, that makes it difficult for Costa.\n38:2 Comment: Diego Costa did his damage for Chelsea during the first half of last season.\n38:6 Comment: They...\n38:8 Comment: had the title almost rubbed up, didn't they, by January?\n38:11 Comment: CHEERING\n38:41 Comment: FANS SHOUT OUT\n38:46 Comment: Jürgen Lombard is shagged towards Kabul.\n39:11 Comment: Brilliant.\n39:15 Comment: Johnson.\n39:17 Comment: Degene.\n39:21 Comment: Rodwell.\n39:23 Comment: Jack Ford by Jones.\n39:25 Comment: It's good to have the Lacroix in turn has been able to pick out Oscar.\n39:31 Comment: Sunderland again forced to retreat quickly.\n39:35 Comment: Pedro.\n39:37 Comment: FANS SHOUT OUT\n39:40 Comment: Matic.\n39:44 Comment: Ivanovic.\n39:50 Comment: Fabregas.\n39:53 Comment: Diego Costa.\n39:55 Comment: Change in the interception.\n40:2 Comment: Too easy for Chelsea to put those balls into the feet of the players in the pocket.\n40:5 Comment: Sunderland should be a lot tighter.\n40:7 Comment: Tighter than they're now back four,\n40:9 Comment: and that midfield should be making it a lot more difficult for Chelsea to thread the ball through.\n40:16 Comment: Straight down by Rodwell.\n40:23 Comment: Matic, he's got a...\n40:25 Comment: fractured nose and cheekbone.\n40:27 Comment: That's the reason he's wearing the mask, Phil.\n40:29 Comment: Pedro, tormenting again.\n40:33 Comment: Tore away by Pantelema.\n40:35 Comment: Again, good play by Pedro, and there's Costa in that penalty area.\n40:40 Comment: Kabul again, good defending.\n40:45 Comment: Brilliant.\n40:47 Comment: He's given the ball to Toivonen.\n40:50 Comment: He fell ahead of him.\n40:51 Comment: This is Watmore.\n40:52 Comment: Watmore getting away from Asper La Quetta.\n40:54 Comment: They're almost doing so.\n41:1 Comment: That's the second one from Asper La Quetta in quick succession as well.\n41:4 Comment: Normally that results in a yellow card.\n41:6 Comment: Watmore escapes him yet again.\n41:7 Comment: It's not a drag back this time, it's a foul.\n41:10 Comment: Surely it should be a yellow card.\n41:13 Comment: It's a foul.\n41:20 Comment: Surely it should be a yellow card.\n41:23 Comment: It's a foul.\n41:49 Comment: Cotto is still organising his defensive wall.\n41:52 Comment: Toivonen has joined it.\n41:54 Comment: Along with O'Shea.\n42:23 Comment: Van Arnoldt.\n42:25 Comment: And for the second time.\n42:29 Comment: Not the best of free kicks.\n42:31 Comment: When you're that far out, you should be easily getting it over the wall and down in and in on that target.\n42:38 Comment: Not the best of starts for Sam down there with Paul Bracewell and the rest of his staff.\n42:42 Comment: Set piece goal conceded.\n42:45 Comment: Another goal inside that six yard area, or just outside.\n42:48 Comment: Not the best of starts are up against it, aren't they?\n42:51 Comment: The notebook is out.\n42:52 Comment: It's turned to plan B already.\n42:55 Comment: Having brought on Adam Johnson.\n43:4 Comment: Brilliant.\n43:7 Comment: Moskit, another of Chelsea's bright sparks in the first half.\n43:10 Comment: Willian again.\n43:12 Comment: Pedro.\n43:14 Comment: Well gathered by Font-Hillemont.\n43:16 Comment: Having a lot more driving from Chelsea in those central positions.\n43:19 Comment: Which has opened up the wider sides.\n43:21 Comment: And you can see Oscar again.\n43:22 Comment: Little option there, but then they switch it.\n43:24 Comment: Willian to Pedro.\n43:25 Comment: Pedro again crossing it, not thinking twice.\n43:29 Comment: Happening.\n43:30 Comment: Just didn't happen there with that cross.\n43:31 Comment: But again, a lovely quick break from Chelsea.\n43:34 Comment: One member of Jojo Marina's backer team who has stayed at the club this week.\n43:50 Comment: Ivanovic.\n43:58 Comment: Oscar.\n44:3 Comment: Chelsea at the moment are reluctant to play Gary Cahill, who's turned 30 today.\n44:7 Comment: He has had a back problem.\n44:8 Comment: It's one of the reasons that Juntaer and Zouma have been paired together in so many of their fixtures.\n44:17 Comment: Pedro.\n44:30 Comment: Pedro made a spectacular start to his career in the Premier League.\n44:32 Comment: Having joined Chelsea from Barcelona.\n44:34 Comment: A goal and an assist in a win at West Bromwich Albion at the end of August.\n44:41 Comment: He felt somewhat unloved at Barcelona, where he was always, it seemed, on the fringes.\n44:47 Comment: Despite his undoubted ability.\n44:50 Comment: Spectacular conclusion to his Barca career as well when he got the winner in the UEFA Super Cup.\n44:57 Comment: That's the thought. What was happening here?\n\nSecond Half:\n0:1 Comment: Someone got the ball moving at the start of the second half\n0:4 Comment: Made a second change\n0:6 Comment: Fabio Barrini, the former Chelsea junior, is on in place of Euler Teuvenen\n0:11 Comment: Sam Ardice already deciding to make a switch in the first half\n0:15 Comment: Sebastien Poitiers going off to be replaced by Adam Johnson\n0:19 Comment: There is Barrini\n0:22 Comment: This is scored from the penalty spot when Sunderland enjoyed a win\n0:26 Comment: at Stamford Bridge with Gus Poyett in charge\n0:29 Comment: And here is Barrini\n0:32 Comment: Watthorpe, who's offside\n0:34 Comment: Too much delay on the pass from Barrini\n0:36 Comment: That was a good opportunity maybe to get a shot away right early in this second half\n0:39 Comment: But obviously Sam and I agree, Teuvenen very ineffective in that first half\n0:44 Comment: Lack of movement, just maybe Barrini's going to get in and around that midfield area\n0:49 Comment: Particularly on this left-hand side and maybe affect the game a little bit more\n0:54 Comment: Watthorpe's out on the right, De Foe up front in that three up front system\n0:58 Comment: And Johnson's just gone into that midfield with Ombria and Rodwell\n1:2 Comment: So he'll just sit in front of them and try and affect it in that way\n1:5 Comment: A little bit more movement about the Sunderland starting eleven for this second half\n1:10 Comment: And hopefully they can reset about Chelsea and get a little bit closer than what they did in the first\n1:15 Comment: Nigel Coates will try and accentuate the positive\n1:18 Comment: But Sam Hardy, our startlist, will have gone in at a hard time and suggested to his team\n1:22 Comment: That given the problems that Chelsea have had in recent weeks\n1:25 Comment: That here is still an opportunity should they get an early goal\n1:33 Comment: Coates claiming that it was foul by Zouma\n1:35 Comment: And Rodrous, the referee, unimpressed\n1:37 Comment: Rodrous, the referee, unimpressed\n1:43 Comment: So again, back on the Diego Costa\n1:45 Comment: That will give him off quite easily there\n1:47 Comment: Just getting under the flight of the ball, ensuring that he can't flick it on\n1:50 Comment: Rodwell nearly getting caught in that area just in front of the back four\n1:53 Comment: Got to be very careful\n1:56 Comment: Rodwell again\n2:2 Comment: Barrini\n2:4 Comment: Johnson looking for Jones\n2:9 Comment: Sunderland finding a little bit of width\n2:13 Comment: Mbila\n2:16 Comment: Johnson\n2:18 Comment: Rodwell\n2:21 Comment: Mbila again\n2:25 Comment: Here's Oscar, who was really lively in the first half\n2:28 Comment: Pedro\n2:30 Comment: Left by Diego Costa\n2:31 Comment: Willian\n2:33 Comment: Or has he been taken down?\n2:34 Comment: The answer is yes\n2:36 Comment: And Chelsea get a penalty\n2:38 Comment: The question was, was he denying a goal scoring opportunity as well?\n2:43 Comment: Yellow card for Pantelimon\n2:47 Comment: We may say that Willian may have got onto this\n2:49 Comment: It's a good ball from Pedro\n2:50 Comment: Chelsea on the break\n2:52 Comment: Gets there first, taps it round him\n2:54 Comment: Or maybe he's right, the referee, someone on the line as well\n2:57 Comment: And that's affecting it\n2:59 Comment: And maybe going a little bit wide\n3:1 Comment: But looks like it's definitely a clip, yeah\n3:4 Comment: And Pantelimon clips him\n3:6 Comment: And a very good view from the referee\n3:8 Comment: Roger East, easy decision, penalty\n3:12 Comment: A little further concern for Sunderland\n3:14 Comment: Antje van Aert who is stretching to try and make the interception\n3:20 Comment: He's in deep trouble\n3:30 Comment: Chelsea haven't had a penalty this season\n3:34 Comment: And now Aiden Hazard who\n3:37 Comment: Was their regular penalty taker during their championship winning campaign\n3:45 Comment: The only difficult thing about this penalty is the delay that's on it\n3:48 Comment: So, big delay but\n3:50 Comment: Should this go in the back of the net, surely game, set and match\n3:53 Comment: And it's a case of how many for Chelsea\n3:55 Comment: Making a change at half time, Sam\n3:57 Comment: He certainly would have liked it to last a little bit longer than this\n4:1 Comment: Before maybe another goal goes in\n4:7 Comment: Oscar against Pantelimon\n4:11 Comment: Easy for Oscar, easy now for Chelsea\n4:15 Comment: They lead by three goals to now\n4:17 Comment: Well, just a delay in the run up\n4:19 Comment: Ways to go, well done\n4:22 Comment: Well, just a delay in the run up\n4:24 Comment: Ways for Pantelimon to move\n4:26 Comment: And puts it in the opposite corner\n4:29 Comment: From probably Chelsea's best player on today's evidence in that first half, Oscar\n4:33 Comment: And he caps it with a goal but\n4:35 Comment: Here you can see he stands him up and then puts him down\n4:38 Comment: And just passes it the wrong way\n4:40 Comment: There you go, easy one\n4:43 Comment: 3-0 Chelsea\n4:46 Comment: Still the chance go up for Mourinho\n4:50 Comment: Oscar pumps the badge\n4:53 Comment: Just like Branislav with NMH after he put Chelsea in front\n4:58 Comment: And Chelsea's supporters have taken the chant up to another level\n5:2 Comment: Chance of Jose Mourinho\n5:8 Comment: A special one, not the forgotten one\n5:19 Comment: The crowd asking the question where were they when they weren't so good\n5:28 Comment: And he's been smuggled in\n5:30 Comment: Smuggled him into again once upon a time, didn't they?\n5:41 Comment: Van Aert\n5:42 Comment: And he's got it\n5:47 Comment: And Samoa Dias knew that he had to be bold\n5:49 Comment: Having conceded those two first half goals\n5:53 Comment: And just go on, Fabio Borini\n5:55 Comment: He's seen his team now concede a third\n5:58 Comment: Probably the worst times to concede\n6:1 Comment: Really early on in a game when you set out a plan\n6:3 Comment: And that's out the window\n6:4 Comment: And you go for a second plan in the second half\n6:6 Comment: And concede straight away again\n6:8 Comment: So that one's out the window\n6:12 Comment: And he's got it\n6:17 Comment: And a sloppiness from Chelsea giving the ball away there\n6:22 Comment: It's the case of Chelsea, can they hold their game together now\n6:26 Comment: And go on and win this game by more goals\n6:34 Comment: And a report by Oscar\n6:43 Comment: And here might fancy a go at this free kick\n6:45 Comment: By Ronald Triborne in the first half\n6:47 Comment: They're having a look but\n6:49 Comment: Johnson would appear to be the favourite\n6:56 Comment: In by Johnson\n6:57 Comment: Kapal\n7:0 Comment: Sunderland have scambled a goal back\n7:4 Comment: Borini's trying to claim it\n7:6 Comment: Kapal's there it was across the face of goal\n7:8 Comment: Which Courtois couldn't hang on to\n7:11 Comment: And Sunderland have hope again\n7:13 Comment: Well off the marking from Chelsea\n7:14 Comment: Kapal's totally free on the far post\n7:16 Comment: He heads it correctly across the goal\n7:18 Comment: Courtois saves but straight into the path of Borini\n7:21 Comment: And he taps home\n7:22 Comment: Look at this\n7:23 Comment: Kapal all on his own on the far post\n7:26 Comment: Courtois can only tap it into the path of Borini\n7:29 Comment: And he scrambles it home\n7:31 Comment: And they're back into the game\n7:34 Comment: Will there be a wobble from Chelsea\n7:36 Comment: This was all happening from the sloppy bit of possession they had\n7:39 Comment: That gave the free kick away\n7:43 Comment: Fabio Borini's goal\n7:49 Comment: Well worked free kick by Sunderland\n7:51 Comment: Courtois initially might have been expecting\n7:53 Comment: The curled shot from Johnson\n7:58 Comment: Fabio Borini tidying up after\n8:0 Comment: Younes Kaboul had caught the Chelsea\n8:3 Comment: Defence flat footed and wrong footed\n8:9 Comment: Younes Kaboul\n8:17 Comment: John Serry\n8:28 Comment: This is a foot shoot\n8:29 Comment: Which over the years has produced plenty of goals\n8:35 Comment: Chelsea Virgins put seven past\n8:37 Comment: Some of them when Carlo Ancelotti was in charge\n8:42 Comment: Pedro\n8:45 Comment: Pedro taking on Jones\n8:46 Comment: Almost getting beyond him\n8:48 Comment: Johnson\n8:54 Comment: The goal has certainly lifted Sunderland\n8:58 Comment: So it should, I mean you needed something like that\n9:0 Comment: It came right at the right time after conceding that third goal\n9:4 Comment: Sloppy bit of play from Chelsea that gave them this goal\n9:6 Comment: You could see\n9:7 Comment: They play into Matich in midfield\n9:9 Comment: He just plays blind\n9:11 Comment: Trying to play it out to this right hand side\n9:14 Comment: Then Oscar gives away the free kick\n9:15 Comment: And from the resulting free kick\n9:17 Comment: Kaboul's all on his own\n9:18 Comment: Heads it across goal\n9:20 Comment: And stop Courtois but can only help it in the path of Borini\n9:23 Comment: Sloppy play from Chelsea\n9:27 Comment: Only one of those frustrated by his lack of opportunities\n9:29 Comment: When he was at Chelsea\n9:36 Comment: His career in England had a go backwards before he went forwards again\n9:42 Comment: Jones\n9:44 Comment: Watnock\n9:48 Comment: Now Ronaldos being pushed further forward now\n9:50 Comment: By Sunderland\n9:52 Comment: Johnson\n9:55 Comment: Rodwa\n9:57 Comment: Here's Defoe\n10:1 Comment: That's a great turn from Jermain Defoe\n10:4 Comment: Ivanovic was tight but the first touch ensured\n10:6 Comment: That he just swivelled on a sixpence here\n10:8 Comment: Look at this, what a good touch that is\n10:10 Comment: Turns around, squares up Ivanovic\n10:12 Comment: Doesn't get anywhere near to him\n10:13 Comment: Gets his shot away\n10:15 Comment: Ivanovic is petrified to make a tackle in this situation\n10:18 Comment: But just drags his shot wide\n10:21 Comment: That's what you've got to do to Defoe\n10:23 Comment: Just get the ball into his feet in that penalty area\n10:25 Comment: Still one of the best\n10:34 Comment: Defoe who arrived at Sunderland back in January\n10:39 Comment: Facing a relegation fight\n10:42 Comment: And managed to claw their way to safety then\n10:46 Comment: Johnson\n10:47 Comment: Borini\n10:49 Comment: Another super opportunity for Borini\n10:52 Comment: What a difference he has made in this second half\n10:54 Comment: What a wobble zone\n10:55 Comment: Johnson gets in that area, operates him behind the strikers\n10:58 Comment: Finds Borini who's the spare man on his left hand side\n11:1 Comment: He curls it just wide, you can see\n11:2 Comment: Well played Johnson, stretches the defence\n11:5 Comment: Curls just wide of that far post\n11:7 Comment: And the wobble's on from Chelsea\n11:9 Comment: This is where they've wobbled time and time again this season\n11:12 Comment: To be fair to Coutuari, he's got it covered\n11:14 Comment: Much better from Sunderland\n11:31 Comment: 3-0, uncomfortable\n11:32 Comment: 3-1\n11:34 Comment: Suddenly getting twitchy\n11:42 Comment: Made the right buy-out shape, but only as far as Willian\n11:46 Comment: Willian, one of those who's been absolved of any blame\n11:50 Comment: For Chelsea's early season woes\n11:58 Comment: Moscow\n12:2 Comment: Ivanovic\n12:6 Comment: Matic\n12:13 Comment: Moscow again, allowed to advance a long way\n12:17 Comment: Willian\n12:22 Comment: A bit of a hand-healer\n12:28 Comment: Chelsea just trying to establish a bit more control again\n12:32 Comment: Just take the sting out of Sunderland's little fight back\n12:37 Comment: Moscow\n12:38 Comment: Diego Costa\n12:40 Comment: Matic\n12:42 Comment: There's Pedro\n12:43 Comment: Diego Costa wants it, but he wasn't going to get it\n12:46 Comment: Well, Pedro's really missing it\n12:48 Comment: He's all on his own, Costa on the far post\n12:50 Comment: He's only got to lift it\n12:52 Comment: There's a couple of runs into the area\n12:54 Comment: Which again was better from Chelsea\n12:56 Comment: Fabregas moaning about the quality across\n12:59 Comment: Steve Holland down there on the line\n13:3 Comment: I wonder what influence he had in the dressing room before the game\n13:7 Comment: It was just the time for the players to take control\n13:17 Comment: Chelsea lost in the Premier League for the ninth time this season\n13:21 Comment: They'd lost on Monday, they'd lost their last two\n13:23 Comment: Chelsea, Chelsea\n13:27 Comment: Last success was here against Norwich City\n13:29 Comment: Who made it difficult for Jose Mourinho's Chelsea\n13:32 Comment: But they switched off a little bit during the second half\n13:34 Comment: And presented Diego Costa with the opportunity to get a winning goal late on\n13:45 Comment: Zouma\n13:48 Comment: Mudge by Jones\n13:49 Comment: Very, very important for Sunderland to keep this little minor wobble on for Chelsea in this game\n13:54 Comment: Okay, they've only had a little bit, five minutes of the play\n13:56 Comment: But just got to keep pressing against Chelsea\n13:59 Comment: Maybe take a risk or two\n14:2 Comment: It's a shame that Chelsea under pressure this season have wobbled\n14:20 Comment: Mudge by Jones\n14:41 Comment: Sunderland have effectively taken a step forward in two steps back in recent weeks\n14:45 Comment: A bit of deception there by Jose as Diego Costa sprinted away from Sunderland's back line\n14:55 Comment: Johnson\n14:56 Comment: I'm wishing the free-kick that he's got in the centre of midfield now\n15:1 Comment: He was looking for help\n15:4 Comment: Sunderland get this right\n15:15 Comment: Watmore\n15:29 Comment: Great strength from Watmore\n15:32 Comment: And the shot from Van Arnolp which is wide\n15:35 Comment: Snapshot\n15:36 Comment: Came to him quickly but got him running again by Watmore\n15:38 Comment: Well nice and direct and I don't know what Ivanovic is moaning about\n15:41 Comment: Watmore's not trying to dive here, I think he's just stumbling over\n15:44 Comment: As you can see with the presence of players, look\n15:46 Comment: Stumbling over and then eventually over the top\n15:48 Comment: Ivanovic moaning at the referee\n15:50 Comment: What for?\n15:52 Comment: Not Watmore\n16:8 Comment: That's it\n16:10 Comment: Well Rodwell get a yellow card here\n16:13 Comment: This is an accumulation of fouls from Jack Rodwell\n16:16 Comment: Really silly, needless yellow card for him\n16:20 Comment: Already been won by the referee, given a chance\n16:23 Comment: But that's good refereeing to have given that chance\n16:25 Comment: And then, well if you take a liberty too many as he does here\n16:29 Comment: You have to give him a yellow card\n16:31 Comment: It's the fifth portion of the season for Jack Rodwell\n16:34 Comment: Which means that he misses\n16:35 Comment: The game against his former club Manchester City next\n16:40 Comment: Handball\n17:6 Comment: Villa\n17:9 Comment: Fabregas.\n17:22 Comment: Diego Costa.\n17:29 Comment: Done again by Fabregas.\n17:32 Comment: And he still loses out to Borini.\n17:35 Comment: De Feu available, and Germain De Feu offside.\n17:38 Comment: That's very unlike Germain De

    "summary": "In a highly eventful match at Stamford Bridge, Chelsea secured a 3-1 victory over Sunderland, providing some respite and hope for their beleaguered fans in a tumultuous season marked by the recent sacking of Jose Mourinho.\n\nThe game began with a palpable sense of tension in the air after Mourinho's departure. The crowd's reaction to the playing squad was mixed, reflecting widespread but divided opinions regarding the former manager’s exit. As Chelsea took to the field, speculations and debates among fans and pundits were rife about the impact of this managerial change on the team's fortunes.\n\nFrom the onset, Chelsea displayed an urgency to prove their worth, dominating possession and pressing high up the pitch. Sunderland, under the guidance of Sam Allardyce, was expected to capitalize on Chelsea's instability. However, the visitors' strategy to keep Chelsea quiet early on was soon undermined.\n\nChelsea's intentions were clear from the get-go. An early defensive error by Kurt Zouma was almost capitalized on by Duncan Watmore, but Zouma’s recovery exemplified the kind of grit the team would need to show throughout the game. Particularly noticeable was Romelu Ivanovic's tenacity, as he redeemed himself for earlier critiques with a commanding presence.\n\nIn the fourth minute, Chelsea earned a corner from relentless pressure. Willian's delivery found Ivanovic who powered a header into the net, giving Chelsea a vital lead just five minutes into the game. The joy among Chelsea supporters was palpable, and chants for Mourinho were louder than ever. The goal was a sign of rejuvenation for a side that desperately needed it.\n\nAs Sunderland struggled to make their presence felt, Chelsea capitalized again in the 13th minute. Again, Pedro was involved, showing significant drive and intent. Costa was heavily involved in the build-up, and when the ball fell to Pedro in a scrappy exchange, he made no mistake, slotting it home for Chelsea's second goal. This early two-goal cushion greatly lifted the Blues' spirits but failed to fully placate their fans, who continued to chant for Mourinho.\n\nDespite Sunderland’s attempts to regroup, the match saw another pivotal moment shortly after the halftime resumption. Sunderland made tactical adjustments bringing on Fabio Borini for Toivonen, and earlier, Adam Johnson for an unwell Sebastian Coates. Their strategy showed sparks of aggression, but Chelsea remained dominant.\n\nOnly three minutes into the second half, another breakthrough came for Chelsea. A swift drive forward saw Diego Costa leave the ball cleverly for Willian who was brought down inside the box by goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon. The referee had no hesitation in awarding the penalty, which Oscar coolly converted with a composed finish, sending Pantilimon the wrong way. The scoreboard now read Chelsea 3, Sunderland 0, essentially sealing the match.\n\nHowever, Sunderland showed resilience and determination not to fade away silently. In a swift response to Chelsea's third goal, they managed to carve a goal back in the 53rd minute. A free-kick from Adam Johnson saw Younes Kaboul rise at the far post to nod the ball back across the face of the goal, and Fabio Borini was on hand to tap it past Thibaut Courtois, giving Sunderland a glimmer of hope.\n\nThe game opened up, and Sunderland began to push harder, sensing an opportunity to get back into the match. Jermaine Defoe, feeding off scraps, managed to cause trouble for Chelsea's defense, with his quick turn and shot going narrowly wide, showing just how dangerous he could be given half a chance.\n\nChelsea responded by looking to reassert their control. They introduced John Obi Mikel for Cesc Fabregas, signaling a shift towards solidity over flamboyance in the central areas. The match saw plenty of end-to-end action, and Chelsea nearly regained a three-goal margin when Loic Remy, on for Costa, drew an excellent save from Pantilimon following a quick counter-attack.\n\nDespite these efforts, Chelsea’s confidence occasionally waivered, allowing Sunderland to press more aggressively. Borini almost notched a second with a curling shot that drifted wide, and Defoe continued to find pockets of space with unsettling frequency. Another scramble in Chelsea's box saw Defoe nearly capitalize on a defensive mix-up, but his half-volley flew over the bar.\n\nThe closing stages of the game were marked by Chelsea’s tactical play to see out their lead. Oscar, the standout performer of the match, was replaced by Ramirez, further strengthening the midfield and providing cover for the back line. Chelsea dealt with Sunderland’s set-pieces efficiently, with Courtois commanded his area with authority.\n\nThe final whistle brought relief and jubilation for the home side. Stamford Bridge echoed with chants for Mourinho, underlining the complex emotions surrounding the club during this period. The 3-1 victory was much needed, providing a stop-gap for criticism swirling around Stamford Bridge and giving interim managers Eddie Newton and Steve Holland a winning start.\n\nFor the players, it was a moment to show they still had the fight and quality to climb back up the table. Branislav Ivanovic’s opener was critical in setting the tone, while Pedro's efforts highlighted the collective determination to turn the situation around. Oscar’s penalty sealed the game, reaffirming his value to the side.\n\nIn conclusion, this match was a microcosm of Chelsea's season - a mix of brilliance, tension, and unpredictability. The win against Sunderland, bolstered by solid individual performances, hopefully, marks a turning point in a tumultuous campaign. Even amidst controversy and change, Chelsea showcased the depth of talent and spirit that can guide them through this difficult period. Sunderland, on the other hand, demonstrated resilience and will take positives from their second-half performance as they continue their battle against relegation."
