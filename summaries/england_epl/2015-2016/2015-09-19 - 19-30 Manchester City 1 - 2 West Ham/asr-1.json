Now that's coming infield, wasn't expected\n2:30 Comment: to start the game of course, he was named amongst the substitutes, young Patrick Roberts,\n2:35 Comment: the man they signed from Fulham, has taken his place on the bench, here's De Bruyne with\n2:39 Comment: an early chance to cross, a chance he took, and Winston-Reed had to clear at the expense\n2:44 Comment: of a corner. Well he did well, he recognised the danger, Winston-Reed got himself to the\n2:48 Comment: front post to lock that particular door. De Bruyne couldn't really have put it into a\n2:53 Comment: much better area than he did.\n2:58 Comment: Well, the miss wins some company on these set pieces, he's already scored a couple of\n3:1 Comment: goals this season, and now they're part to play in the one here against Juventus in the\n3:5 Comment: Champions League. Otamendi taking his place, and he is in the middle of that group of players,\n3:10 Comment: on the edge of the six-yard box, and the head of Australia on the other hand, of Adrian,\n3:14 Comment: although he couldn't hold on to it, at least he was in the right place to deny an early\n3:18 Comment: City goal here.\n3:20 Comment: He's a little bit fortunate, he was straight down his throat there.\n3:23 Comment: Kolarov with a lovely ball for De Bruyne.\n3:29 Comment: And back it goes to Sanier, who's made a very consistent start to the season with Zabaleta\n3:35 Comment: still out injured, and likely to be for some time.\n3:40 Comment: Fernandinho, Jai Arturo, who takes over as captain in Kompany's absence.\n3:45 Comment: There's Kolarov, another who's made a great start to the season for City.\n3:50 Comment: There's Otamendi.\n3:52 Comment: The Argentine international.\n3:53 Comment: Made his debut against Juventus as a sub in the last 15 minutes.\n3:58 Comment: Creswell with the career on West Ham.\n4:3 Comment: Fernandinho with the first dangerous moment in the game there, gets above Mark Noble.\n4:7 Comment: Decent movement there to get half a yard on the West Ham midfielder.\n4:11 Comment: He's a little bit unfortunate, into either corner it would have been a problem.\n4:15 Comment: Fernandinho has scored a couple of goals already this season.\n4:18 Comment: Hayek.\n4:23 Comment: A possession for Manchester City, but West Ham will have expected that.\n4:28 Comment: De Bruyne's team enjoy more of the ball than most in the Premier League.\n4:35 Comment: And he has won five of his six previous games against West Ham.\n4:40 Comment: The City's manager including that victory last season.\n4:48 Comment: Here's Payet.\n4:51 Comment: West Ham.\n4:52 Comment: They're finding it difficult to get forward at the moment and after that early flurry.\n4:58 Comment: Lebiang.\n5:0 Comment: He's coming to the side to replace the injured Fiyate.\n5:6 Comment: Tompkins will be glad to be back in the centre of defence.\n5:9 Comment: He has been filling in a lot of it right back this season.\n5:14 Comment: But yeah, he drops off into that midfield space and finds room.\n5:18 Comment: Finds a team-mate in Moses.\n5:20 Comment: Who?\n5:21 Comment: Finds!\n5:22 Comment: The net with a sensational strike.\n5:25 Comment: Just six minutes gone and West Ham take the lead.\n5:29 Comment: It's the first league goal that City have conceded this season.\n5:33 Comment: Nobody getting out to the ball here for Manchester City.\n5:36 Comment: Neither when Payet gets it, nor when Moses picks it up.\n5:39 Comment: Payet gets it here.\n5:42 Comment: None of City's holding players getting out to him.\n5:44 Comment: Moses loads of time to get it out of his right side.\n5:51 Comment: Oh, he's got a lovely shot.\n5:52 Comment: He's got a lovely shot.\n5:52 Comment: He's got a little bit of a cut on that.\n5:53 Comment: Moved it a little bit left to right.\n5:56 Comment: Which just managed to tuck it inside Joe Hart's left-hand post.\n6:0 Comment: Keeper has no chance with that.\n6:3 Comment: But I certainly think question marks in terms of City getting out to the ball.\n6:7 Comment: First to Payet, and then more importantly to Victor Moses.\n6:12 Comment: Well, Moses did make a superb debut on Monday night against Newcastle.\n6:16 Comment: And was unlucky enough to score himself, remember?\n6:18 Comment: When he hit the woodwork with the attack that eventually led to Payet.\n6:22 Comment: Second goal.\n6:23 Comment: But what a start he's made again here.\n6:27 Comment: He was a very consistent goal scorer a couple of seasons ago with Chelsea.\n6:31 Comment: He scored ten goals, I remember that, in one campaign for them.\n6:34 Comment: But was never able to hold down a regular place.\n6:38 Comment: So an unexpected start to this game, Davey.\n6:42 Comment: Well, just the start of West Ham wanted us, for sure.\n6:44 Comment: But I'm not surprised that Payet was involved.\n6:51 Comment: Oh, good.\n6:52 Comment: elected two ils th CONNECTIONS\n6:53 Comment: and he did redefine himself but they just ciudad\n6:59 Comment: penny\n7:16 Comment: self-ictions\n7:18 Comment: of what he wants to achieve here is a success.\n7:21 Comment: Never been any doubt about his ability,\n7:23 Comment: maybe his consistency has been lacking at times.\n7:26 Comment: Played over his skin on Monday night,\n7:29 Comment: and what a start he's made to this one.\n7:33 Comment: This time the sixth different club that Moses has represented\n7:36 Comment: now in the Premier League.\n7:39 Comment: Sacco trying to get in the end of this one,\n7:42 Comment: N'Gala got there first, but Sacco doesn't give up.\n7:44 Comment: He's got a bit of a scrap there, in front of the assistant.\n7:48 Comment: And then a foul throw.\n7:52 Comment: Did well to win the throw, and there's going to be a lot of that today\n7:55 Comment: for the West Ham striker.\n7:58 Comment: There will be times where he's isolated up there.\n8:1 Comment: If he can win the odd free kick or throw in,\n8:3 Comment: it gets West Ham up the pitch.\n8:5 Comment: And I wonder if he's just smiling at the moment.\n8:8 Comment: And Sadat is smiling.\n8:9 Comment: He's got a bit of a smile on his face.\n8:13 Comment: Incidentally, West Ham have never won a Premier League game here at Etihad,\n8:17 Comment: but remember, they hadn't won at Anfield for over 50 years,\n8:21 Comment: and look what happened there.\n8:28 Comment: Does well with the interception, but it could turn into a problem,\n8:31 Comment: as hard came all the way!\n8:33 Comment: And of all people, you would have expected Aguero to find the net there.\n8:37 Comment: Maybe fully off the speed he really would have.\n8:41 Comment: Lovely early ball throw from De Bruyne.\n8:43 Comment: Cresswell on the stretch can only knock it down for Aguero.\n8:47 Comment: Adrian, very fortunate he made no contact with the City striker,\n8:51 Comment: or he could have been looking at a red card here.\n8:55 Comment: Never on the target, was it?\n8:57 Comment: Always moving away from the far post here.\n9:2 Comment: You'd have had the money on Aguero from that range, wouldn't you?\n9:5 Comment: Actually, by his standards, he's not made a brilliant start to the season,\n9:9 Comment: just one goal in six games when City beat Chelsea 3-0 here.\n9:13 Comment: But no-one can ever doubt his threat.\n9:18 Comment: Didn't materialise then, though.\n9:20 Comment: Victor Moses winning the throw, and Manu has found the net.\n9:25 Comment: What a good goal it was, perfectly placed.\n9:37 Comment: Breed.\n9:39 Comment: Given away to Otamendi.\n9:41 Comment: Hesania.\n9:43 Comment: It's G improved.\n9:54 Comment: Galla.\n9:56 Comment: He's played in every game so far.\n9:58 Comment: With Kompany missing today, Otamendi here replacing him.\n10:8 Comment: Aguero in the middle.\n10:10 Comment: Now that's joining him.\n10:11 Comment: Little decision.\n10:12 Comment: De Bruyne! 2-0.\n10:13 Comment: City, Toure, here's Otamendi, Sania on the right flank.\n10:21 Comment: Otamendi.\n10:26 Comment: Cloud stunned by that early West Ham goal,\n10:29 Comment: finding their voices again here.\n10:31 Comment: Over 50,000 inside the stadium\n10:33 Comment: after the extra seats were added in the close season.\n10:38 Comment: And they've got a record European attendance here\n10:39 Comment: against Juventus in midweek.\n10:42 Comment: Here's Sania.\n10:43 Comment: Toure striding away and finding Sania again.\n10:51 Comment: That as well.\n10:52 Comment: With the block.\n10:54 Comment: I think if they are going to leave a pass for City,\n10:56 Comment: West Ham will leave it down the sides\n10:57 Comment: and they'll be confident that they can defend crosses.\n11:0 Comment: City in the front four have very little height.\n11:3 Comment: It's going to have to be a very good cross to pick anyone out.\n11:6 Comment: Toure doing well on the line.\n11:8 Comment: Sterling in the centre.\n11:10 Comment: Just hesitated.\n11:11 Comment: And that was enough.\n11:13 Comment: And it's not.\n11:14 Comment: Fernandinho.\n11:17 Comment: Now on him, but the referee, Bobby Madler,\n11:20 Comment: said play on the City in possession.\n11:24 Comment: And as often happens in those situations,\n11:26 Comment: no real advantage came their way.\n11:32 Comment: Fernandinho waiting to make sure,\n11:34 Comment: no surprise that Mark Noble has put this foot in.\n11:37 Comment: What a terrific start he's had to the season, Mark Noble.\n11:40 Comment: Anthony Kaye, contact the nearest...\n11:41 Comment: And among the goals as well.\n11:42 Comment: Anthony Kaye, contact the nearest...\n11:43 Comment: Irish student.\n11:44 Comment: Thank you.\n11:46 Comment: De Bruyne.\n11:47 Comment: Sanya.\n11:49 Comment: Here's Otamendi.\n11:52 Comment: Ndala.\n11:55 Comment: Qualero.\n11:55 Comment: Now enjoying his longest run in City's starting XI,\n11:59 Comment: if you include the end of last season.\n12:2 Comment: Carl Klitsch has been out injured.\n12:8 Comment: Neves.\n12:10 Comment: Coming in a lot from his usual right-wing position.\n12:13 Comment: Fernandinho.\n12:16 Comment: Here's Aguero.\n12:20 Comment: Sterling with a little flick.\n12:25 Comment: I think Adrian just failed to prevent that going for a corner.\n12:29 Comment: He did.\n12:33 Comment: Adrian back in the last-time goal.\n12:35 Comment: After a three-match ban for his sending off against Leicester.\n12:38 Comment: Aaron Randolph deputised.\n12:42 Comment: Neves with the corner.\n12:43 Comment: Neves.\n12:46 Comment: Ndala near the penalty spot.\n12:47 Comment: Yaya Torre always a threat from these set pieces.\n12:51 Comment: In the end, there's nothing to worry about as Otamendi headed wide.\n12:55 Comment: Really good ball and difficult one to defend, isn't it?\n12:57 Comment: Dipping right into that front post area.\n13:1 Comment: He did score a number of headed goals, Otamendi.\n13:6 Comment: This was the moment of matter.\n13:8 Comment: You know, when Moses picks the ball up,\n13:10 Comment: Kolorov drops off.\n13:11 Comment: I'm not quite sure why.\n13:12 Comment: Mangala's left to try.\n13:13 Comment: Can get out to the ball.\n13:14 Comment: Can't get there quickly enough.\n13:16 Comment: And to be fair to Joe Hart,\n13:17 Comment: in such a sweet strike from Victor Moses,\n13:20 Comment: he's never getting there with his left hand.\n13:23 Comment: But I do think City could have pressed the ball a little bit better,\n13:25 Comment: both when Payet picked it up\n13:26 Comment: and certainly when Moses had it on the edge of the box there.\n13:31 Comment: Sacco dispossessed meanwhile.\n13:34 Comment: Subdued reaction, wasn't it, from Bilic,\n13:36 Comment: realising no doubt that a goal coming that early\n13:39 Comment: means there's an awful long time\n13:42 Comment: for City to get level again.\n13:43 Comment: And remember, they've scored in every game so far.\n13:51 Comment: Otamendi to Mangala.\n13:53 Comment: Those two played alongside each other, incidentally, at Porto.\n13:58 Comment: So they should know each other's game.\n14:2 Comment: Kolorov.\n14:8 Comment: Jenkinson with a header.\n14:11 Comment: Benadino for City.\n14:13 Comment: He's got a good shot.\n14:14 Comment: And a good one.\n14:18 Comment: Strong player with excellent technique.\n14:21 Comment: Mining De Bruyne.\n14:22 Comment: He's dispossessed by Payet.\n14:24 Comment: He's done well.\n14:25 Comment: He's going to have a little bit more work to do\n14:26 Comment: playing left side today, Payet.\n14:30 Comment: We did expect him to play centrally,\n14:32 Comment: but Lanzini is playing in that role.\n14:36 Comment: Payet's going to have a bit of work to do\n14:38 Comment: going with Bakary Sanja on this side of the pitch.\n14:43 Comment: No surprise in that possession start.\n14:46 Comment: West Ham,\n14:47 Comment: I don't think we'll bother too much about\n14:49 Comment: how little of the ball they had.\n14:50 Comment: Had less possession than Newcastle on Monday night.\n14:54 Comment: But they use it pretty well when they do get it.\n14:58 Comment: City beat West Ham 2-0 here last season.\n15:0 Comment: They've actually won eight of their last nine\n15:1 Comment: home games against them in the Premier League,\n15:4 Comment: including the last half a dozen in a row.\n15:7 Comment: They've got to come from behind on this occasion\n15:8 Comment: to keep that run going.\n15:12 Comment: West Ham,\n15:13 Comment: I mean,\n15:13 Comment: they've got to come from behind on this occasion\n15:13 Comment: No great hurry to take the throw in over on that far side.\n15:25 Comment: Kolarov's headed clearance.\n15:28 Comment: And Moses, offside.\n15:36 Comment: We've gone quiet here,\n15:38 Comment: and it's his team that's brought this\n15:40 Comment: rather subdued atmosphere to bear.\n15:43 Comment: I think we've got a close game in the final 30 minutes.\n15:48 Comment: But they've got to come back.\n15:49 Comment: And they've got to come back.\n15:51 Comment: Looking for the run from Sagnac.\n15:53 Comment: As well,\n15:54 Comment: he could let it run to Adrián.\n15:56 Comment: Yeah, got in really narrow very quickly,\n15:58 Comment: Aaron Criswell.\n16:1 Comment: Conscious effort here from West Ham\n16:2 Comment: to try and play a bit higher\n16:3 Comment: to get the two centre-backs up the pitch.\n16:7 Comment: Downside of that, of course,\n16:8 Comment: is that there's a lot of room for Aguero\n16:9 Comment: to get into anything that's knocked over the top.\n16:13 Comment: And obviously,\n16:13 Comment: they feel they've got the pace at centre-back to do with that.\n16:16 Comment: Hayet in possession again, just trying to slide it through for Sacco.\n16:39 Comment: Robianc.\n16:41 Comment: Noble.\n16:43 Comment: There's Tompkins.\n16:49 Comment: Jenkinson.\n16:51 Comment: Robianc.\n16:53 Comment: Can't find Moses this time, Kolarov intercepts.\n16:57 Comment: They're getting a little bit, City are quickening the pace.\n17:13 Comment: What a man, D.\n17:16 Comment: Toure.\n17:24 Comment: Kolarov.\n17:26 Comment: Into the feet of Sterling.\n17:32 Comment: Ogian for West Ham.\n17:34 Comment: Mancini hasn't seen much of the ball in these early stages.\n17:40 Comment: He couldn't retain possession there.\n17:43 Comment: Fernandinho.\n17:46 Comment: Navas.\n17:49 Comment: De Bruyne outside him.\n17:53 Comment: It's a decent ball!\n17:56 Comment: Roswell eventually gets it away to Payet.\n17:59 Comment: Sacco.\n18:3 Comment: And Whistler's going for a West Ham free-kick.\n18:5 Comment: Referee had to think about it, didn't he?\n18:7 Comment: Trying to let the game breathe, no advantage for West Ham.\n18:10 Comment: Good ball in from De Bruyne,\n18:12 Comment: Criswell determined that it's not going to be a good one, but...\n18:13 Comment: He's going to come in on his goal side, but leaves a half-yard on his inside.\n18:21 Comment: De Bruyne has produced a couple of good early crosses from this right-hand side.\n18:27 Comment: Sacco up against Otamendi.\n18:30 Comment: Here's Mangala.\n18:34 Comment: Kolarov.\n18:35 Comment: Kolarov! Kolarov! Kolarov!\n18:40 Comment: Kolarov! Kolarov! Kolarov! Kolarov! Kolarov!\n18:42 Comment: Otamendi.\n18:46 Comment: Mangala's signed from Valencia.\n18:51 Comment: De Bruyne, finds Navas.\n18:54 Comment: Just too far for serving.\n19:2 Comment: A hit to complete a full 90 minutes, incidentally, for City.\n19:6 Comment: His first goal in the English Blue Shirts against Watford.\n19:12 Comment: Of the three finishes of the Dual Split bueno,\n19:15 Comment: Reality schedule.\n19:17 Comment: Down to four paint!」\n19:20 Comment: !\n19:21 Comment: That's our hat-trick for a t venom-eым match.\n19:22 Comment: I must be aren't very get be the goalie.\n19:23 Comment: Up to retreat!\n19:24 Comment: He's got his tall member Keely Brown here,\n19:26 Comment: being a striker, right now.\n19:28 Comment: He's got an essential weight on the right.\n19:32 Comment: Bошan BersetICE сделал that on a kickoff-match.\n19:35 Comment: All this saying,\n19:36 Comment: you can't waste youraka fi.\n19:38 Comment: Only transfers are following Grandos to a free kicker in Bermuda.\n19:40 Comment: And that's Dustin Fyke, Light hasn't played yet for NL B largagre single for Southampton,\n19:41 Comment: whose después se apropos of fields and bizarro programa.\n19:42 Comment: Mancini.\n19:47 Comment: He's quite happy to go backwards for the moment.\n19:50 Comment: Now Tompkins takes them forward.\n19:53 Comment: Moses.\n19:55 Comment: Tompkinson still there.\n19:57 Comment: And he's got Sacco well placed in the centre.\n19:59 Comment: That was a really important block there by Otamendi.\n20:3 Comment: Otherwise Sacco's scoring, you would think.\n20:9 Comment: Absolutely vital block.\n20:12 Comment: Sacco's got a tap in there.\n20:15 Comment: First time now that West Ham have managed to get Jenkinson forward.\n20:22 Comment: Otamendi starting again for the first time for City.\n20:26 Comment: Making a vital contribution there.\n20:29 Comment: As Reavers come forward to meet this.\n20:31 Comment: He can do it though.\n20:34 Comment: Noble with a difficult decision there.\n20:35 Comment: He didn't know whether to play forward or backwards.\n20:39 Comment: So Adrian had to go a long way from goal.\n20:41 Comment: He's a bit fortunate, Mark Noble, I think.\n20:43 Comment: I don't think he has to be told.\n20:45 Comment: Surprised he let the ball bounce.\n20:46 Comment: If he had a problem.\n20:52 Comment: Overall, you'd have to say that\n20:53 Comment: this has been a very decent first 20 minutes or so for West Ham.\n20:59 Comment: Otamendi.\n21:1 Comment: Fernandinho.\n21:4 Comment: His collar off.\n21:11 Comment: Couldn't right에\n21:14 Comment: couldn't righte\n21:14 Comment: transcendably there by Fernandinho to Sacco.\n21:18 Comment: It would have been besteht by assistati's\n21:19 Comment: defenders.\n21:20 Comment: That suddenly opens up for staying.\n21:30 Comment: And that's gotta be a great kind.\n21:32 Comment: Possibly even a Balkansi.\n21:34 Comment: And we know exactly what gramost to a tackle free kick.\n21:39 Comment: Wasn't he in the West Ham or shop.\n21:40 Comment: Or.\n21:41 Comment: The shows Hi.\n21:41 Comment: South coast.\n21:41 Comment: at the back is Sippy Brokia\n21:43 Comment: he's decided that he was going to stop the game\n21:48 Comment: another call for the Argentine\n21:52 Comment: going to have to be careful, a lot of football left\n21:56 Comment: in this game and he was playing right in the middle of midfield\n21:58 Comment: where he's going to have to\n22:0 Comment: make a tackle or two\n22:1 Comment: Thierry\n22:7 Comment: De Bruyne\n22:9 Comment: already making a run down the left\n22:12 Comment: here he is, against Moses\n22:14 Comment: keeping a good shape at the moment, West Ham\n22:19 Comment: two wide players have got to put in a really good\n22:22 Comment: shift here for West Ham\n22:23 Comment: Moses and Payet on this near side\n22:26 Comment: City push the full backs on\n22:29 Comment: it's a great effect at

sideways West Ham get a chance to drop into shape and it's a very good\n23:12 Comment: shift\n23:13 Comment: there's a few groans all around us as well\n23:15 Comment: Otamendi\n23:18 Comment: Sane\n23:21 Comment: Otamendi goes for the long ball this time and gets it wrong\n23:26 Comment: not too satisfied I think with the way his team have started here despite all their possession\n23:36 Comment: a bit ponderous again having a bit deliberate in their build up\n23:41 Comment: that was the problem against Juventus\n23:43 Comment: there were times they just couldn't quicken it in the last third\n23:46 Comment: can Toure do that for them now?\n23:49 Comment: nope, he wants to turn back as well\n23:52 Comment: but finds Sanea\n23:54 Comment: Navas\n23:57 Comment: Hey!\n23:59 Comment: I'm trying to claim that went out of play, it didn't\n24:2 Comment: and he finds Sanea\n24:4 Comment: Navas pulled back by him making it easy for\n24:7 Comment: Mark Noble\n24:8 Comment: back towards town, quite happy to park the bus now with that one goal lead\n24:14 Comment: Toure with a clever ball but it was well read by Jenkinson\n24:22 Comment: in any case the flag had gone up for offside the referee has said play on\n24:25 Comment: not yet\n24:28 Comment: back for Lansini, Creswell, Sanea\n24:32 Comment: back for Lansini, Creswell\n24:34 Comment: the left back has got a long way forward here could he regret that\n24:38 Comment: as Toure brings City forward\n24:40 Comment: De Bruyne\n24:42 Comment: Sterling to his left, Navas to the right\n24:44 Comment: and it's the

counter-attack.\n30:25 Comment: In their 12th game of the season,\n30:27 Comment: as well, West Ham, and they're only in September.\n30:29 Comment: Remember, their campaign began in July\n30:31 Comment: with the Europa League qualifiers,\n30:33 Comment: which they failed to get through.\n30:40 Comment: Jenkinson and Reid forward for this corner.\n30:43 Comment: Reid got it well.\n30:46 Comment: And they've scored again, haven't they?\n30:48 Comment: They look to the linesman, but the flag stays down.\n30:52 Comment: What a start it is here at the Etihad\n30:54 Comment: with West Ham forcing a second goal.\n30:57 Comment: Winston Reid is totally unmarked.\n31:1 Comment: City have gone man-to-man.\n31:2 Comment: I'm not quite sure who is supposed to be picking Winston Reid up here.\n31:6 Comment: What's number two?\n31:9 Comment: Completely unmarked here.\n31:13 Comment: They're looking for offside.\n31:14 Comment: They're never getting it.\n31:15 Comment: City can't get it clear.\n31:18 Comment: And Sacco can't quite believe it is luck.\n31:20 Comment: But Winston Reid allowed a free run at the ball.\n31:23 Comment: Header's not on target.\n31:24 Comment: They maybe get a little bit fortunate.\n31:27 Comment: But Sacco is on target.\n31:29 Comment: Goal for West Ham.\n31:30 Comment: No more than a knockdown from Winston Reid.\n31:32 Comment: Terrific reaction from the striker, wasn't it?\n31:36 Comment: And Sacco has now scored four goals already this season.\n31:44 Comment: Should have been a corner.\n31:48 Comment: Tough call for the assistant,\n31:50 Comment: who I think is a couple of yards from the line in any case.\n31:52 Comment: Can't call it properly.\n31:54 Comment: City were unhappy about that.\n31:56 Comment: And then unhappy.\n31:57 Comment: Thinking there might have been an offside.\n32:0 Comment: But the goal stands.\n32:1 Comment: And we have a very surprising scoreline here.\n32:5 Comment: Surprise for me is that they allow one of the West Ham centre-backs to be completely unmarked.\n32:9 Comment: An obvious target, Winston Reid, isn't it?\n32:18 Comment: This will have ruined a few pre-match predictions, I'm sure.\n32:22 Comment: But West Ham.\n32:24 Comment: Winners at the Emirates and at Anfield.\n32:27 Comment: Now home.\n32:27 Comment: They have a 2-0 lead.\n32:30 Comment: And we're still in the first half.\n32:31 Comment: 15 minutes of that left with stoppage time.\n32:34 Comment: Here at Manchester City.\n32:38 Comment: Does well conceding the free kick.\n32:44 Comment: Do they have a case for a possible offside there, City, David?\n32:46 Comment: Not sure. I don't think so.\n32:54 Comment: Sterling.\n32:56 Comment: Fernandinho.\n32:58 Comment: An incredibleゾ\n33:6 Comment: Don'tdino again.\n33:10 Comment: Here's Sterling.\n33:17 Comment: The decision's going their way at the moment.\n33:19 Comment: To the standing skipper's frustration.\n33:22 Comment: I think Yaya Ture's reaction probably tells the story there.\n33:26 Comment: Should have had the decision.\n33:32 Comment: Yeah, but I think Yaya Touré's knee is behind the line,\n33:34 Comment: so should have had the corner.\n33:37 Comment: Not much going City's way right now.\n33:41 Comment: Certainly not that scoreline.\n33:43 Comment: The only team in all four divisions of English football\n33:46 Comment: who haven't conceded a single-league goal before today\n33:50 Comment: now find themselves 2-0 adrift.\n33:55 Comment: Noble's header on.\n33:56 Comment: Yes.\n34:3 Comment: That's a free kick.\n34:5 Comment: That'll be Yaya Touré.\n34:26 Comment: GOOFER RAPIDS\n34:33 Comment: Tompkins, free kick, looking for Sacco.\n34:35 Comment: Headed away by Otamendi.\n34:39 Comment: Here's Noble, though, for West Ham.\n34:45 Comment: Sturdy.\n34:48 Comment: Looking for Sergio Aguero, who's offside.\n34:52 Comment: That's the chance the West Ham are going to have to take,\n34:55 Comment: if they want to.\n34:56 Comment: They're going to have to make the pitch shorter for their midfield players today.\n35:0 Comment: They're going to have to play pretty high.\n35:2 Comment: Half a yard at most.\n35:4 Comment: Winston-Reed can see the ball being played,\n35:8 Comment: he can see Aguero,\n35:10 Comment: he steps up just in time.\n35:23 Comment: West Ham are busier to do it, the two sides.\n35:26 Comment: City having the right in shape of the ball,\n35:28 Comment: not surprisingly, but...\n35:30 Comment: boy, have West Ham used it well when they've had possession.\n35:39 Comment: Sampo heads on and out.\n35:42 Comment: Manchester City have suffered just one defeat\n35:44 Comment: in their last 19 home games in the Premier League.\n35:47 Comment: That was when Arsenal beat them 2-0 here,\n35:49 Comment: that was back in January.\n35:52 Comment: They will need some performance to turn this one around.\n35:56 Comment: They're not going to be able to win this one, though.\n36:1 Comment: The West Ham fans must be in dreamland.\n36:4 Comment: They've got back a very popular former player on the bench there,\n36:8 Comment: it's Levan Bilic.\n36:11 Comment: And they have made the start of the season\n36:13 Comment: that in their wildest dreams they couldn't have hoped for.\n36:22 Comment: Sane.\n36:24 Comment: Working hard to deny him space.\n36:28 Comment: Navas.\n36:32 Comment: Sane.\n36:36 Comment: Navas hits it early, looking for Sterling on the back post.\n36:41 Comment: Raises his back, helping his defence.\n36:44 Comment: And doing a good job.\n36:47 Comment: Noble.\n36:48 Comment: Sacco.\n36:49 Comment: Has he brought down? Yes.\n36:50 Comment: Another decision that angers the home fans.\n36:53 Comment: Good play from the striker, though, takes all the pressure off West Ham.\n36:59 Comment: Two centre-backs to get further up the pitch,\n37:1 Comment: had started to camp a little bit on the edge of the box.\n37:6 Comment: Conscious effort here, I think, from Levan Bilic\n37:8 Comment: to get higher up the pitch than they were on Monday night.\n37:13 Comment: I mentioned that Manchester City have scored in every game,\n37:16 Comment: so West Ham, who now have 13 goals, more than City themselves.\n37:23 Comment: And they've gone from one goal to another.\n37:25 Comment: And they've taken the ball in, and it's a good ball.\n37:27 Comment: And they've taken it to the right place.\n37:29 Comment: Good pressure high up the field from City.\n37:31 Comment: Oh!\n37:33 Comment: Good pressure.\n37:34 Comment: Oh!\n37:52 Comment: Otamendi.\n38:1 Comment: Lebrun up.\n38:3 Comment: Navas.\n38:5 Comment:

a shot.\n38:23 Comment: Terrific one, Atami.\n38:24 Comment: Terrific kick from Aguero.\n38:25 Comment: There wasn't a just drop to shoulder to lose Sacco.\n38:29 Comment: He's back both side.\n38:32 Comment: And you get another sign of rust here from Sergio Aguero.\n38:37 Comment: There's a hard bit here to make a shooting chance.\n38:40 Comment: Not a problem for Aguero.\n38:45 Comment: Pellegrini says that Aguero is 100% fit again.\n38:49 Comment: But obviously having missed.\n38:51 Comment: Quite a bit of action.\n38:53 Comment: He can't be as sharp as the manager would have wanted.\n38:58 Comment: Fernandinho.\n39:0 Comment: Here's De Bruyne.\n39:8 Comment: Toure.\n39:13 Comment: That's a good ball for Sanya.\n39:15 Comment: Aguero near post.\n39:17 Comment: Sterling

Payet's there again.\n40:24 Comment: Preswell.\n40:28 Comment: Obiang.\n40:30 Comment: That's clumsy from him.\n40:32 Comment: Straight to the feet of Raheem Sterling.\n40:34 Comment: Aguero.\n40:36 Comment: Two to his left.\n40:38 Comment: He picks out De Bruyne.\n40:46 Comment: The obvious target there.\n40:48 Comment: The only bit of height arriving in the box for Manchester City.\n40:49

Noble\n41:45 Comment: Obiang\n41:49 Comment: Payet tries to slide it through\n41:52 Comment: and he's banged away through as well\n41:54 Comment: crucial challenge then by N'Golo\n41:56 Comment: to prevent what could easily have been a third West Ham goal\n41:59 Comment: could have been\n42:0 Comment: Kolo was claiming it was foul\n42:2 Comment: I just think it was onside\n42:4 Comment: I don't think he sees the runner on his outside here Kolo\n42:11 Comment: Payet gets his head up\n42:13 Comment: never getting a free kick for that\n42:19 Comment: Sako thought he was getting the shot away here\n42:22 Comment: N'Golo did brilliantly to get his toe to it\n42:26 Comment: he had a lot of critics in his first season in the Premier League\n42:31 Comment: but he has become a much more assured defender\n42:36 Comment: and proved his power of concentration there\n42:44 Comment: this is the build up to the second goal here\n42:49 Comment: and the ball is in the air\n42:51 Comment: is there an offside there?\n42:54 Comment: I don't think so\n42:55 Comment: I think Sako is level there as the ball comes in\n42:58 Comment: was the ball out?\n42:59 Comment: I don't think the assistant can call out\n43:0 Comment: because he's a couple of yards from the corner flag\n43:5 Comment: Winston Reid\n43:10 Comment: wins the knockdown here\n43:11 Comment: Obiang is at the back post\n43:12 Comment: but again he's level at worst\n43:14 Comment: and certainly no offside there\n43:17 Comment: Winston Reid couldn't quite believe that\n43:18 Comment: he got a free run and a free header there\n43:23 Comment: that's finishing wide as well\n43:26 Comment: Fernandinho kept it alive\n43:29 Comment: Sako's injury you'd expect a striker to be\n43:33 Comment: seems that the officials got the big decisions right there\n43:37 Comment: Sako's goal stood\n43:39 Comment: as he limps off\n43:40 Comment: and received treatment\n43:41 Comment: after that challenge by N'Golo\n43:43 Comment: limps off a little too slowly for the home fans liking\n43:48 Comment: it's a surprise West Ham have seen very little of the ball\n43:55 Comment: that was probably the game plan to keep City in front of them\n43:59 Comment: allow them to pass it across them\n44:3 Comment: very rarely have they been opened up in this first half\n44:7 Comment: Sako has come back on\n44:8 Comment: against the

Follow-up.\n44:25 Comment: There's De Bruyne. Only Aguero in the box.\n44:27 Comment: Now that's joining him for City.\n44:29 Comment: It's Aguero!\n44:30 Comment: And it's off target again.\n44:32 Comment: Winston-Reed not happy that West Ham don't stop the cross\n44:36 Comment: coming into the box.\n44:39 Comment: I think Aguero loses his standing leg here as he pulls the trigger.\n44:42 Comment: WHISTLE BLOWS\n44:46 Comment: Aguero again taking his time with the goal kick.\n44:49 Comment: That's why the Kings are a bit angrier.\n44:59 Comment: Sheldon Ruffalo will have a word if he does that again.\n45:3 Comment: Four minutes of stoppage time for the play.\n45:5 Comment: The full-fledged has indicated a remarkable first half.\n45:8 Comment: Four minutes of time added on.\n45:10 Comment: A minute and four minutes.\n45:12 Comment: And it's off target again.\n45:17 Comment: City in a hurry to try and get something back before the end of it.\n45:20 Comment: Otamendi.\n45:27 Comment: N'Gara.\n45:30 Comment:

Oh, well played.\n45:44 Comment: It looks as though he could have been brought down there.\n45:46 Comment: But no free kick has been given.\n45:49 Comment: Navas.\n45:53 Comment: Samyar.\n46:0 Comment: That leads it to Otamendi.\n46:8 Comment: Aguero.\n46:9 Comment: Slips it through to De Bruyne.\n46:11 Comment: Yes!\n46:15 Comment: Manchester City have got the goal they needed just before half-time.\n46:20 Comment: And it's Kevin De Bruyne.\n46:22 Comment: The first goal he's ever scored in English football.\n46:26 Comment: How important is it going to be as well?\n46:28 Comment: Aguero does really well.\n46:29 Comment: This ball is wrapped into his feet.\n46:31 Comment: Decent control.\n46:32 Comment: A little reverse here.\n46:33 Comment: Mark Noble can't get across to De Bruyne.\n46:36 Comment: And Adrian has no chance.\n46:38 Comment: Goal for City.\n46:40 Comment: Terrific strike.\n46:41 Comment: Good first touch.\n46:42 Comment: And his first in a City shirt for number 17, Kevin De Bruyne.\n46:45 Comment: And a wonderful strike.\n46:46 Comment: When City needed it most as well, you would have to say.\n46:49 Comment: Just escapes the two West Ham holding players.\n46:55 Comment: Might just stand this game in its head.\n46:59 Comment: City's record signing has scored a crucial goal\n47:1 Comment: and they're in the mood for another one here.\n47:4 Comment: And so is he.\n47:6 Comment: Toure.\n47:8 Comment: He needs to stand firm now at West Ham.\n47:13 Comment: Not much left of this half.\n47:20 Comment: Ben Andino.\n47:21 Comment: A new spring in the step of these City players now.\n47:25 Comment: Now that's calling for the ball down the right.\n47:27 Comment: And a splendid pass to pick him out.\n47:29 Comment: And it goes towards Toure.\n47:35 Comment: And they've finally gone up for a West Ham free kick.\n47:38 Comment: Winston Reid, I think, caught late as he tried to clear it.\n47:42 Comment: And West Ham will be in no hurry to take this.\n47:44 Comment: Bad enough that they've lost one in the dying minutes in the first period.\n47:50 Comment: Good football for Divic now.\n47:52 Comment: And one is a relief for Pellegrini.\n47:54 Comment: Well, the psychology of the game changes, doesn't it?\n47:56 Comment: All of a sudden City have a bit of momentum\n47:59 Comment: at a time when they were really struggling.\n48:1 Comment: Wonderful finish from Kevin De Bruyne.\n48:9 Comment: Good offence by Van Gaal.\n48:10 Comment: ijk.\n48:11 Comment: Yes, who Cowan made a very nice shot\n48:38 Comment:

reputation in Italian football with Sampdoria being a tough tackler picked up quite a\n49:25 Comment: few cautions in Serie A as well\n49:31 Comment: that has prolonged the first half\n49:35 Comment: Cardinalsas prob are resorting to they better get return to hate\n49:46 Comment: well Dina will take the free kick just about enough time\n49:57 Comment: quierego take the pre-k till I dare I'm sterling\n50:1 Comment: take time to him again needs to be here take the pre-k till I dare I'm sterling\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: midfield City with David Silva being injured, remember, in the warm-up.\n0:4 Comment: But how much will Kevin De Bruyne's first City goal in first-half stoppage time\n0:9 Comment: change the outcome of this game?\n0:10 Comment: I'm sure that's the question that fans of both teams will be asking\n0:14 Comment: as the second half gets underway, and it should be an intriguing 45 minutes this day.\n0:18 Comment: It certainly should, I think the tendency of teams in West Ham's position\n0:23 Comment: as the game wears on is to drop deeper,\n0:25 Comment: I think they have to try and avoid that,\n0:27 Comment: they have to deal with what they were doing early in the match.\n0:30 Comment: Javier doing just that, taking them forward again.\n0:36 Comment: Mancini taking on Sanya, and getting his cross in, too deep for Sacco,\n0:40 Comment: but Moses is on the end of it.\n0:43 Comment: He already scored, remember?\n0:48 Comment: Trying to leave as much of the inside of his left foot on this as possible,\n0:52 Comment: trying to find the inside of Joe Hart's left-hand post.\n0:56 Comment: Kolarov refuses to dive in here, he's quite happy with his angles.\n1:6 Comment: Kolarov.\n1:10 Comment: It's Toure, who was injured just before half-time, looking to pick out Sterling.\n1:14 Comment: The header almost took the ball to Agüero.\n1:17 Comment: It's a bit quick there, and he was,\n1:20 Comment: but the home fans have liked what they've seen of him.\n1:27 Comment: So we've got an all-Argentine central defence for Pellegrini's team.\n1:35 Comment: As Navas takes them forward.\n1:38 Comment: Dubrojna.\n1:40 Comment: Sterling.\n1:42 Comment: Here's the cross, and it's a bit of a mistake.\n1:47 Comment: Here's Dubrojna again.\n1:50 Comment: Bernardinho.\n1:55 Comment: Usual measured build-up, this, from City.\n2:0 Comment: And Toure tries the shot from long range,\n2:2 Comment: he's claiming it, flicked off a defender, and should be a corner.\n2:6 Comment: The referee has given a goal kick, he has.\n2:9 Comment: It's something pretty special, isn't it, to beat Adrian from that angle, from that range.\n2:13 Comment: Did the keeper get anything on it?\n2:16 Comment: If he did, you can't blame the referee for not sporting it, can you?\n2:21 Comment: Nobody's scored this season, of course, Yaya Toure against West Bromwich Albion.\n2:25 Comment: And that's a pretty good scoring record against West Ham, incidentally.\n2:31 Comment: Sterling.\n2:36 Comment: Three kicks been given, just as West Ham thought,\n2:39 Comment: and snuffed out the danger there.\n2:46 Comment: Yaya Toure.\n2:48 Comment: Searching ball, which Croswell had to reach.\n2:52 Comment: And he completes the clearance for the moment.\n2:58 Comment: Dubrojna.\n3:7 Comment: Same pattern as much of the first half,\n3:9 Comment: with City pretty much encamped in the West Ham half.\n3:14 Comment: It's West Ham's power and pace on the break that they have to beware of.\n3:18 Comment: Got it back here with Toure.\n3:20 Comment: A challenge by Noble, but Fernandinho picks up the loose ball.\n3:26 Comment: Dubrojna.\n3:27 Comment: Aguero knew the penalty spot there, West Ham might have cleared the danger\n3:33 Comment: without the expense of a corner there, but Reid wasn't to know that.\n3:37 Comment: And then a poor pullback gives Saka the chance to relieve his defenders.\n3:42 Comment: Couldn't take it though.\n3:43 Comment: Maybe Chelis wins it back.\n3:46 Comment: Dubrojna and Navas linking.\n3:50 Comment: Aguero near the penalty spot.\n3:52 Comment: Keeper had to make a good save, Noble gets it away.\n3:56 Comment: City looking ominous again here.\n3:58 Comment: Fernandinho, Navas.\n4:1 Comment: Ball in the box for City, and they can stay there, they've got a corner.\n4:5 Comment: Well again, good angle from the wide area from Post to Krosno,\n4:8 Comment: City to defeat West Ham.\n4:10 Comment: They've got good numbers at the front post, any time the ball does come in.\n4:13 Comment: Winston Reid may have been a little bit lucky previously,\n4:16 Comment: when he didn't get a lot on the ball.\n4:21 Comment: City have that momentum that's come from the goal.\n4:26 Comment: Toure on the near post, leaving Dani Chelis free behind him.\n4:31 Comment: Chelis didn't quite know where the ball was.\n4:34 Comment: Dubrojna tries a very ambitious effort, but this had already gone\n4:37 Comment: for a West Ham free kick.\n4:44 Comment: City's decision to extend his contract, when there was so much speculation\n4:47 Comment: about his future at the beginning of this season,\n4:50 Comment: has proved to be a very wise move indeed.\n4:52 Comment: It's just settled everyone down, I think, here.\n4:56 Comment: And that has been reflected in City's early results.\n5:0 Comment: If they can take something out of this, having been 2-0 down,\n5:3 Comment: it will be another excellent performance.\n5:7 Comment: West Ham holding on to their lead.\n5:12 Comment: Dani Chelis.\n5:15 Comment: Goes up to Mendy.\n5:17 Comment: Polloro. Dubrojna.\n5:19 Comment: Excellent move. Sterling.\n5:21 Comment: Onside.\n5:22 Comment: Looking for Agüero in the centre.\n5:28 Comment: Good work there by Lanzini.\n5:30 Comment: Got to try and look after the ball a little bit better, West Ham.\n5:33 Comment: That assurance that we saw in the first part of the game has gone now.\n5:37 Comment: Here's Toure for City. Dubrojna.\n5:43 Comment: He's not yet doing well to lose his man, Fernandinho.\n5:46 Comment: He's got Sacco down the centre.\n5:48 Comment: Wanted it earlier, Sacco.\n5:50 Comment: Eventually had to check, he knew he was running offside.\n5:53 Comment: Too many touches from Kaya.\n5:56 Comment: He also had Moses on mark down the right.\n5:58 Comment: Moses really angry with him.\n6:0 Comment: Not finding it. Here's Fernandinho.\n6:8 Comment: Dubrojna.\n6:11 Comment: On to Kolorov.\n6:14 Comment: Sterling.\n6:20 Comment: Dubrojna slides it in to Toure.\n6:22 Comment: And gets it back again. Now Kolorov.\n6:26 Comment: Here's Sterling. Agüero wants it near post.\n6:29 Comment: It comes out to Toure.\n6:31 Comment: Great block. Fernandinho.\n6:33 Comment: Fernandinho.\n6:36 Comment: He had to make sure he couldn't get the shot away.\n6:38 Comment: But here's Navas to keep City on the front foot here.\n6:43 Comment: Big shout for apology from the fans, I have to say.\n6:46 Comment: The Bronos are feeling a lot more half-hearted.\n6:48 Comment: I think it's Winston-Reid who's on Agüero at the front post.\n6:51 Comment: Shake of the head there from Winston-Reid.\n6:53 Comment: Navas too quick down the outside here for Lanzini.\n6:59 Comment: Not enough for me.\n7:4 Comment: Come on, come on, come on.\n7:8 Comment: Come on, come on.\n7:13 Comment: Straight back in again.\n7:14 Comment: That's Amendi following it all the way.\n7:19 Comment: If they can get the ball forward here quickly, West Ham.\n7:21 Comment: City have committed a lot of men, but it's City who regain possession with Sterling.\n7:26 Comment: Look at James Tomkins down in the box here.\n7:29 Comment: I think it's Tomkins playing everyone on safe here.\n7:32 Comment: Sterling.\n7:34 Comment: Just chipped over the ball.\n7:37 Comment: Moses.\n7:42 Comment: Well, City seem to be winning every challenge at the moment.\n7:45 Comment: The Breuner.\n7:47 Comment: Toure.\n7:50 Comment: Agüero.\n7:51 Comment: He can hit them from here.\n7:53 Comment: Chose not to.\n7:54 Comment: And Noble, very grateful.\n7:57 Comment: Moses.\n7:58 Comment: He's got men left and right.\n8:2 Comment: He's gonna get a 3K, and Kolarov's gonna get a yellow card, I think.\n8:5 Comment: Yeah, a cynical one, isn't it?\n8:9 Comment: He was always gonna make the challenge, Kolarov.\n8:14 Comment: No way he was allowing Moses to get any further up the pitch there.\n8:20 Comment: A bit of respite for West Ham, who really have been under the caution since the second half began.\n8:26 Comment: That's City's first caution of the game.\n8:28 Comment: Aubieng and Lansini were booked by the referee in the first half.\n8:40 Comment: Reid.\n8:42 Comment: Creswell.\n8:52 Comment: Creswell again.\n8:55 Comment: Creswell.\n9:0 Comment: West Ham force backwards towards their own goal.\n9:8 Comment: Now Adrian takes them forward with a long punt up towards Sacco.\n9:12 Comment: Headed away by Otamendi, De Bruyne, a lovely instant control by him.\n9:16 Comment: And a good ball infield to Sterling.\n9:18 Comment: Well played though, Carl Jenkinson.\n9:20 Comment: That's a big old side, Jenkinson, didn't he?\n9:22 Comment: A really good offer there from Sterling.\n9:25 Comment: Good spot there from the full-back.\n9:28 Comment: Thuray, Fernandinho.\n9:38 Comment: Kolarov.\n9:40 Comment: Out on the left.\n9:43 Comment: Finding Sterling.\n9:49 Comment: Thuray.\n9:50 Comment: Chance for him to go between two defenders.\n9:56 Comment: Not quite sure how he got goal-side there, Jairzoula.\n9:59 Comment: I was expecting him to go down.\n10:2 Comment: And a wonderful run-man by Aguero, holds it just outside the penalty area.\n10:6 Comment: With the hometown screaming for a free kick.\n10:9 Comment: It's looking ominous at the moment for West Ham.\n10:12 Comment: City getting closer and closer.\n10:17 Comment: Thuray.\n10:18 Comment: Never got it, did he?\n10:21 Comment: Never got his three-a-tough on the edge of the box.\n10:24 Comment: This wonderful change of pace from Yaya Thuray, from almost static to get goal-side.\n10:30 Comment: Adrian did really well to get out as quickly as he did.\n10:33 Comment: One or two would have gone down there had he been in Yaya Thuray's position.\n10:36 Comment: To be fair to him, he stayed on his feet.\n10:40 Comment: Jenkins forced into the hasty clearance, and that did well with the second header.\n10:48 Comment: But cause for concern for Bilici's team at the moment.\n10:51 Comment: He just can't get hold of the ball and keep it.\n10:53 Comment: Navas.\n11:1 Comment: Good defender, really good defender, Cresswell.\n11:3 Comment: A little bit lucky with the last ricochet that wins West Ham the goal kick.\n11:9 Comment: But he's aware of how quick Navas is here.\n11:14 Comment: Just backs off, doesn't get too tight, leaves himself in a good position to make the block.\n11:19 Comment: Crossland's Player of the Year with fans and teammates last season.\n11:24 Comment: He's played every single minute for them in the Premier League since they signed him for Midswitch.\n11:35 Comment: Michelis wins it back.\n11:39 Comment: Reid beaten to the header.\n11:40 Comment: Aubameyang.\n11:42 Comment: Mancini.\n11:48 Comment: And City can save a free kick.\n11:55 Comment: No surprise, City bossing it completely now.\n12:0 Comment: I think more important, starting to find one or two holes in that West Ham rearguard.\n12:7 Comment: But Sacco could find a hole in City's!\n12:10 Comment: He did, but he couldn't find the net.\n12:13 Comment: I knew he was only going to get one touch as Joe Hart was bearing down on him.\n12:17 Comment: Really good run here from in to out, in to the channel, he's onside.\n12:24 Comment: Joe Hart on his face, he wasn't going to get two touches.\n12:33 Comment: Here comes City again.\n12:36 Comment: And that's gone out of play before Sterling's intervention.\n12:44 Comment: Trying to slow things up, West Ham, I think just trying to take the heat out of the game,\n12:48 Comment: trying to quieten the crowd again.\n12:50 Comment: Trying to get through this first 15 minutes without any damage.\n13:1 Comment: Lemien Cernys.\n13:13 Comment: Navas.\n13:15 Comment: Here's Fernandinho.\n13:16 Comment: On to Toure.\n13:31 Comment: Sanea.\n13:34 Comment: Navas, De Bruyne is on that far side as well, the City right.\n13:38 Comment: Toure, that's a lovely little through ball.\n13:40 Comment: Lagredo was near post there, they couldn't quite pick him out though.\n13:44 Comment: Winston Reid has done brilliantly at that front post this afternoon, so many times he's been there when it most counted.\n13:51 Comment: De Bruyne there to win it back for Manchester City.\n13:56 Comment: And gets it back, and finds Toure.\n14:0 Comment: Here's Kolarov.\n14:2 Comment: The crowd wanted him to shoot, and he obliged.\n14:5 Comment: Well, he's good, Kolarov, but from that range I'm not sure that's the right choice.\n14:9 Comment: He had Sterling on his left-hand side.\n14:18 Comment: Change on the way here for West Ham United.\n14:22 Comment: It's West Ham's scorer Victor Moses, who will be coming off to be replaced by Gareth Antonio.\n14:29 Comment: He's West Ham and indeed Premier League debut, the man they signed on transfer deadline day from Monaghan Forrest.\n14:35 Comment: He scored 15 goals for Forrest last season, he was their player of the year in fact.\n14:44 Comment: So a chance for him to show the fans and his manager what he's capable of at this level.\n14:51 Comment: He's taken up a position out on the left.\n14:55 Comment: That should mean a shift inside for Payet, who has been playing left.\n15:7 Comment: Come on play from the back by Manchester City, and then the long ball for Agüero, who took it in his stride.\n15:14 Comment: And then went down too theatrically.\n15:18 Comment: Growing defender against the grid, wasn't it?\n15:21 Comment: Agüero looked favoured, when he got Winston Reid one on one it looked as if West Ham might be in bother.\n15:27 Comment: Defender did really well.\n15:50 Comment: Outnumbered defence, he tried the shot and that is on the corner.\n15:53 Comment: And De Bruyne took one or two really good corners this afternoon.\n15:57 Comment: Taking them from either side.\n16:0 Comment: Don't know what for West Ham to do here.\n16:4 Comment: Short to Sterling.\n16:7 Comment: He escapes the attention of Lansini and holds it up nicely.\n16:12 Comment: De Bruyne.\n16:17 Comment: Sterling's there again.\n16:21 Comment: De Bruyne.\n16:25 Comment: And Michalis.\n16:26 Comment: Here's Fernandinho.\n16:31 Comment: Antonio just got a foot in there, but it's deflected to Sagnac.\n16:35 Comment: And now to Toure.\n16:37 Comment: So strong in those positions, but this time he loses out.\n16:41 Comment: Noble with a good ball to again relieve a little bit of the pressure on West Ham here.\n16:46 Comment: They just need to try and keep it.\n16:49 Comment: And they can't do that.\n16:52 Comment: De Bruyne.\n16:54 Comment: Nemes.\n16:58 Comment: Toure was the closest to him.\n17:1 Comment: And they couldn't find him.\n17:2 Comment: Winston Reid again.\n17:4 Comment: No choice but to go out into the wide area and did his job by stopping it coming across the face.\n17:10 Comment: West Ham.\n17:13 Comment: Looking a little bit ragged though.\n17:18 Comment: The pressure continues from City.\n17:20 Comment: Yaya Toure's got away from the challenge.\n17:27 Comment: Relief for Aubiang there.\n17:31 Comment: Who I think could be doing better here is Yaya Toure.\n17:33 Comment: Gets him into the channel.\n17:36 Comment: Aubiang, that's a very weak challenge.\n17:40 Comment: Winston Reid, not on that occasion getting across.\n17:44 Comment: Couldn't have struck him much better, Yaya Toure, could he?\n17:49 Comment: Frustration on the bench.\n17:52 Comment: Well, I would say including stoppage time, still half an hour or so to play here.\n17:57 Comment: It's going to be a long 30 minutes or so you feel for West Ham United.\n18:6 Comment: Mancini.\n18:18 Comment: Off the boney.\n18:20 Comment: Reminding the manager of his presence and it looks as though it's work.\n18:23 Comment: He's about to come on.\n18:32 Comment: Sterling.\n18:34 Comment: Toure.\n18:36 Comment: Sterling's there again.\n18:40 Comment: Winston Reid for the umpteenth time in this game, reading the danger and dealing with it.\n18:45 Comment: Yep, off the boney.\n18:46 Comment: It was rather disappointing against Juventus.\n18:49 Comment: But you could say that of several City players on the night.\n18:52 Comment: He's about to come on here.\n19:3 Comment: Demi Cheri sees the chance to go forward.\n19:6 Comment: And he's got it.\n19:11 Comment: Demi Cheri sees the chance to go forward.\n19:14 Comment: And finds De Bruyne.\n19:16 Comment: Sterling.\n19:20 Comment: De Bruyne.\n19:22 Comment: Collar on.\n19:25 Comment: Aguero near post.\n19:26 Comment: Adrian did really well to get anything on that.\n19:29 Comment: But the danger hasn't gone yet.\n19:32 Comment: Demi Cheri's throwing round the first challenge, finding De Bruyne.\n19:36 Comment: Thought about hitting it.\n19:38 Comment: In the end slides it through to Navas.\n19:41 Comment: And Adrian again to West Ham's rescue.\n19:44 Comment: Getting some terrific work done either side now.\n19:46 Comment: City, West Ham just hanging on.\n19:50 Comment: Beautiful ball inside Antonio here.\n19:52 Comment: Navas can take a touch.\n19:55 Comment: Adrian perhaps a little bit lucky he got it safe.\n20:0 Comment: He certainly justified his recall in place of Dan and Randal.\n20:3 Comment: Substitution for City.\n20:4 Comment: Number 7, Raheem Sterling.\n20:7 Comment: Raheem Sterling is the player who's going to make way for Wilfried Bonny.\n20:11 Comment: Wilfried Bonny.\n20:16 Comment: Bonny hasn't been able to repeat anything like the success he had in front of goal for Swansea.\n20:21 Comment: Just two goals in 17 appearances for City so far.\n20:29 Comment: Immediately takes up a position near the penalty spot.\n20:31 Comment: A good header of the ball of course.\n20:32 Comment: They've got a few in there City.\n20:37 Comment: Reeded is again who clears the danger.\n20:41 Comment: De Bruyne.\n20:42 Comment: Demi Cheri's.\n20:45 Comment: Options all over the place for City at the moment.\n20:47 Comment: And they look to get another corner out of this.\n20:55 Comment: And some rear guard action by West Ham.\n20:58 Comment: This is when the ball is going to be taken.\n21:0 Comment: This is when the concentration tends to go when the pressure has been so intense.\n21:8 Comment: Very poor corner letting them off the hook.\n21:11 Comment: No hurry to get out either here West Ham.\n21:19 Comment: Fernandinho.\n21:24 Comment: Demi Cheri's.\n21:26 Comment: Oh dear that's poor.\n21:28 Comment: West Ham gladly, gleefully accept the gift.\n21:31 Comment: They haven't seen much of the ball in the City half.\n21:34 Comment: But they have now with Sacco.\n21:39 Comment: Mancini's edge of the box.\n21:40 Comment: He's gone instead for a more difficult ball and got it wrong.\n21:43 Comment: That's for who's trying to pick out.\n21:46 Comment: They've been trying to pick out Antonio but Mancini was set with the pass.\n21:51 Comment: Bonny.\n21:54 Comment: Toure.\n21:58 Comment: Reid there again.\n22:0 Comment: Optimistic shout of handball.\n22:3 Comment: Otwar Tate skipped up onto his chest didn't he.\n22:9 Comment: Three quarters of the way through and West Ham still lead here.\n22:12 Comment: Those two first half goals.\n22:15 Comment: Moses and Sacco.\n22:17 Comment: But Breuner replied in first half stoppage time for City.\n22:23 Comment: Tolero.\n22:27 Comment: Fernandinho.\n22:31 Comment: Demi Cheri's.\n22:40 Comment: De Bruyne.\n22:46 Comment: Intelligent ball.\n22:47 Comment: Kassania who has Navas in support.\n22:50 Comment: And finds him.\n22:51 Comment: Toure with a little flick.\n22:53 Comment: It comes back to Toure.\n22:55 Comment: Well how many times has the combination of Reid and Atlean come to West Ham's rescue.\n23:1 Comment: First goal unlucky.\n23:2 Comment: He knows he's outside the front post for Jaya Toure.\n23:4 Comment: He's trying to help the first one.\n23:6 Comment: Across the six yard port.\n23:7 Comment: Almost got lucky.\n23:13 Comment: He stopped the corner being taken because West Ham wanted to make a change.\n23:18 Comment: Nikita Jelovic will come on for his West Ham debut in fact.\n23:23 Comment: And they signed on.\n23:24 Comment: Transfer deadline day from Hull City.\n23:27 Comment: And the village knows very well he gave him his first caps for Croatia.\n23:35 Comment: Manuel Lanzini the player who goes up.\n23:41 Comment: Positive move in the sense he's bringing on a striker here.\n23:44 Comment: Well if interesting to see a probably play off the right hand side.\n23:47 Comment: But the ball generally sticks when it's played up to Jelovic.\n23:50 Comment: And that's what West Ham need right now.\n23:53 Comment: They need to protect the ball better when it is knocked up.\n23:57 Comment: First thing he has to do though is defend.\n24:5 Comment: Go back to De Bruyne to make a better angle.\n24:8 Comment: Here he is again.\n24:11 Comment: Noble heads away.\n24:12 Comment: De Bruyne.\n24:14 Comment: Virtually every City player is camped inside the West Ham half here.\n24:18 Comment: And they've earned another corner.\n24:23 Comment: In fact Joe Hart is the only player who isn't in the opposition territory.\n24:37 Comment: Eleventh corner this.\n24:39 Comment: Navasic.\n24:41 Comment: Eleventh corner this.\n24:43 Comment: Navasic to take it.\n24:45 Comment: Demichelis had a chance and missed it.\n24:50 Comment: Took a knick off a West Ham player at the front post.\n24:52 Comment: Almost very costly there.\n24:55 Comment: They've knocked in some very good corners City from either side.\n24:58 Comment: I'm sure if you offered West Ham a point before this game they'd have gladly accepted it.\n25:4 Comment: At the moment they're still looking at three.\n25:7 Comment: Twenty minutes to go.\n25:16 Comment: And the crowd have found their voice.\n25:18 Comment: And they're going to be there.\n25:26 Comment: And the crowd have found their voices.\n25:30 Comment: Don't forget, live only on Sky Sports tomorrow.\n25:33 Comment: The London derby at White Hart Lane.\n25:35 Comment: Spurs against Crystal Palace.\n25:36 Comment: Twelve-thirty Sky Sports one.\n25:39 Comment: And then Southampton take on Manchester United on the same channel.\n25:47 Comment: Sacco.\n25:49 Comment: Giving away to Toure.\n25:50 Comment: Fernandinho.\n25:51 Comment: Lasagna.\n25:53 Comment: Navas.\n26:5 Comment: Otamendi.\n26:6 Comment: Hops it on to Colaro.\n26:13 Comment: Demitriades.\n26:18 Comment: It's a good ball for the goalkeeper.\n26:20 Comment: It's a good ball for Toure.\n26:22 Comment: Boney near post to Guero.\n26:23 Comment: Edge of the box.\n26:30 Comment: Samuel with a chance to cross.\n26:33 Comment: And Boney couldn't reach it.\n26:37 Comment: But inevitably, when West Ham clear it goes back to a blue city shirt.\n26:42 Comment: Colaro playing it in this time.\n26:46 Comment: Here's Otamendi.\n26:48 Comment: Demitriades.\n26:50

take into account the width that City have had as well,\n36:17 Comment: the service they've managed to get into the box from either side,\n36:21 Comment: I think if you'd offered Manuel Pellegrini this before the game,\n36:24 Comment: he might have been happy.\n36:27 Comment: West Ham have defended so well.\n36:33 Comment: Hans Geurens wasn't the best.\n36:35 Comment: Sacco.\n36:38 Comment:

    "summary": "In what turned out to be an enthralling game at the Etihad Stadium, West Ham United managed to pull off a stunning 2-1 victory against Manchester City. The match opened under the intense scrutiny of the City faithful, who expected their team to continue their early season dominance, while West Ham fans hoped for another upset in a season already filled with surprises.\n\nThe first few minutes of the match saw City attempting to dominate possession, but West Ham, under the guidance of Slaven Bilic, had different ideas. Just six minutes into the game, the visitors shocked the home crowd. Victor Moses, who had already shown his potential in previous matches, picked up the ball from a well-placed pass by Dimitri Payet. City's defense, uncharacteristically sluggish, failed to close down Moses, giving him ample time to unleash a remarkable strike from the edge of the area. The ball swerved past Joe Hart and nestled into the bottom corner, handing West Ham an unlikely early lead. It was the first league goal that City had conceded this season, prompting Manuel Pellegrini's men to regroup quickly if they were to salvage their flawless record.\n\nCity tried to respond immediately, with Sergio Aguero coming close to equalizing less than ten minutes later. A misjudged header from Aaron Creswell landed perfectly for Aguero, but the Argentine, surprisingly, missed the target, his attempt going wide of Adrian's far post. The level of disbelief was palpable among the fans as the usually clinical Aguero was thwarted.\n\nHowever, West Ham were not to be passive spectators in their lead. In the 31st minute, Winston Reid's header following a corner wasn't cleanly dealt with by the City defense. The ball fell kindly for Diafra Sakho, who showed his opportunistic instincts by pouncing and tucking the ball into the net from close range. The Hammers now had a two-goal cushion which left City in a tight spot. Bilic's side had become the first team to score more than once against City in the league this season, building on their remarkable away form with previous victories at Arsenal and Liverpool.\n\nCity, however, displayed resilience. In first-half stoppage time, Kevin De Bruyne marked his full debut with a goal that not only brought his team back into the contest but also boosted the morale of his teammates and supporters. A slick interchange between Aguero and De Bruyne saw the Belgian in space just outside the box. His shot was confidently placed beyond Adrian, cutting West Ham's lead as they headed into halftime. \n\nAs the second half commenced, the scenario was set for an intense 45 minutes. Manchester City took control of possession, pushing West Ham into a defensive stance, attempting to break their resilience. Despite enjoying much of the ball, City's attacks found themselves thwarted by a well-disciplined West Ham backline, with Adrian and Winston Reid standing out in their efforts to maintain the advantage.\n\nCity nearly found themselves level within the first ten minutes of the second half. Fernandinho, Navas, and the ever-threatening De Bruyne linked effectively, but somehow the final ball continually evaded them, whether it was Reid's block or Adrian's reflexes keeping City at bay. Aguero, known for his lethal finishing, found himself on the receiving end of several promising attacks, but fortune seemed to be favoring the visitors as West Ham's defenders put their bodies on the line to keep him from getting his shots on target.\n\nIn response to City's intensifying pressure, Bilic decided to make a tactical change, introducing Michail Antonio for the tiring Moses in the 60th minute. Despite the substitution, it was all about survival for West Ham, who had to withstand wave after wave of City assaults. The support from the stands grew louder, urging their team forward. Raheem Sterling and David Silva, both operating in the middle and creating chances, were orchestrating the attacks. Fernandinho, making late runs, and Kolarov, with his overlapping, were constant threats. \n\nThen came perhaps the best chance of the second half. With around 20 minutes left, Wilfried Bony, brought on to provide a different type of threat, connected with one of Navas' whipped-in crosses. His header seemed destined for the back of the net, but Adrian showed why he had quickly reclaimed his spot between the posts after suspension, producing a world-class save to deny the Ivorian from close range.\n\nWest Ham's resoluteness was becoming the story of the match. Reid, time and again, found a way to be in the right place at the right time, making clearances, intercepting passes, and winning aerial duels. Bilic’s decision to bring on Jelavic in place of Lanzini was aimed at providing a target man who could hold up play and relieve some pressure off of the defense.\n\nCity’s continual pressing led to a staggering total of 14 corners, exemplifying their domination of territory, yet not one of these set-pieces bore fruit. Kelechi Iheanacho's introduction in the final minutes hinted at desperation from Pellegrini as he looked to his bench for a last-ditch equalizer. The young striker found himself involved immediately, but his efforts along with De Bruyne and Toure's relentless surges were absorbed by a stoic West Ham defense.\n\nBy the time the final whistle blew, West Ham had not only held on for the victory but had also cemented their place as formidable giant killers this season. The statistics might have illustrated City’s dominance in possession and chances, but the scoreline bore testimony to West Ham’s tactical discipline and clinical finishing. It was a magnificent performance of defensive solidity and counter-attacking precision by Bilic’s men, who left the Etihad with their third major scalp of the season.\n\nIn the end, the match served as a reminder of the unpredictability of the Premier League. For Manchester City, it was a night of missed opportunities and stern frustration as they scorned several excellent chances to change the game's result. For West Ham United, it was a night of jubilation and a significant hint that this could be a special season for them."
