Premier League season?\n0:7 Comment: And even though it's only the fifth league game they've played,\n0:9 Comment: the champions can't afford to fall any further behind Manchester City.\n0:14 Comment: There is the potential this weekend they could finish 11 points behind\n0:18 Comment: in the race for the title.\n0:20 Comment: This is a huge game for both of these teams today.\n0:22 Comment: Yeah, it is.\n0:23 Comment: And a nice little early sharpener, a wake-up call, you'd say,\n0:26 Comment: for Brendan Galloway there.\n0:28 Comment: Pedro on him like a flash.\n0:31 Comment: Closing him down quick.\n0:32 Comment: It's a big game for him today with Pedro, the experience of Pedro running at him.\n0:36 Comment: I know Galloway hasn't trained much this week,\n0:38 Comment: so Martinez might be a little bit worried about that.\n0:42 Comment: And the ripple of applause around Goodison Park for the first touch\n0:45 Comment: for John Stones, which won't surprise anybody.\n0:48 Comment: Here's Matic for Chelsea.\n0:51 Comment: And it's going to be interesting, Glenn, isn't it, early on in this match,\n0:54 Comment: just to see how the balance in the Chelsea side looks today,\n0:57 Comment: bearing in mind...\n0:58 Comment: John Obi Mikel comes in to start for the first time this season.\n1:1 Comment: Yeah, as we can see that he's gone square of Matic.\n1:4 Comment: They're playing deep in front of the two centre-halves.\n1:6 Comment: And Farragas is playing in the pocket, just in behind Costa.\n1:10 Comment: The key is Mikel will give you the defensive responsibilities.\n1:13 Comment: For me, he's got to look forward more.\n1:14 Comment: And if Farragas is clear, if he's in space,\n1:17 Comment: he doesn't get the ball in there quick enough.\n1:20 Comment: So Eden Hazard, who was part of a successful Belgium side\n1:24 Comment: during the transfer window, but criticised by his international manager,\n1:28 Comment: Ivanovic with the first chance to get forward.\n1:31 Comment: And the first touch for the Everton goalkeeper, Tim Howard, as well.\n1:35 Comment: Barclay sends it forward towards Lukaku.\n1:37 Comment: That's going to be an interesting battle today, isn't it?\n1:38 Comment: Both of them strong and both of them quick.\n1:41 Comment: Kurt Zouma up against Romelu Lukaku.\n1:49 Comment: Here's Mikel.\n1:51 Comment: Pedro.\n1:52 Comment: Fabregas.\n1:54 Comment: Pedro, who's got some licence to roam in this Chelsea match.\n1:59 Comment: David westwood, red flag blue flag,\n2:1 Comment: Kyrie, new\n2:9 Comment: trendy sound if he has a shirt.\n2:18 Comment: Lальные,\n2:19 Comment: Cancel or sensations,\n2:22 Comment: he'll be doing well.\n2:26 Comment: Davouti.\n2:26 Comment: THAT'S NOT GOOD.\n2:27 Comment: THEY'RE NOT GOOD.\n2:27 Comment: first game after the international break and the closing of the transfer window\n2:32 Comment: all of the managers now know they've got the full complement until January at\n2:36 Comment: least\n2:48 Comment: as Kona just looking to slip it through there towards the car coup has our\n2:55 Comment: towards Diego Costa who at this stage of last season already scored seven goals\n3:1 Comment: for Chelsea including a hat-trick against Swansea\n3:4 Comment: just the one so far and you wonder whether this is the day when things can\n3:8 Comment: really explode for the Spanish international in the meantime his\n3:12 Comment: message for Everton with a bit of hesitation from Zuma\n3:24 Comment: clearly his lines there\n3:25 Comment: but he just moved back and that Bezic run at him nice little break from\n3:29 Comment: Everton but as you see here it's the break I thought Zuma can come across and\n3:34 Comment: he just well he just holds his line and holds his place I think there's a an\n3:38 Comment: ankle injury maybe here for Bezic\n3:44 Comment: there's good defending from Zuma he thought as Michael said he might come\n3:48 Comment: out and cut it out but I think Bezic has gone down and he's pulled a\n3:51 Comment: hamstring or something doesn't look happy there the boy this is the\n3:54 Comment: concern of the team and the team is not doing well in the final three games of the season\n3:55 Comment: this is the concern of the team and the team is not doing well in the final three games of the season\n3:55 Comment: for Roberto Martinez Tom Cleverley's already\n4:1 Comment: injury was drafted in during the course of the transfer window and Kevin\n4:6 Comment: Morales is among the Everton subs as well today\n4:14 Comment: he was also the the victim of one of the most bizarre dismissal to think I've\n4:18 Comment: seen he was sent off for throwing chewing gum at one of the Andorra\n4:22 Comment: players and he's off the field for now for Everton and he's off the field for now for\n4:24 Comment: Everton and he's off the field for now for Everton certainly was helpful there\n4:28 Comment: certainly was helpful there re like OK\n4:38 Comment: you said Barkley\n4:42 Comment: you're to get the crochet behind the\n4:45 Comment: deflection for nan other targets lock\n4:49 Comment: playing against Mccarkey all keep the\n4:52 Comment: quality quite planted certainly was a courtety Holey and he has taken hitters\n4:53 Comment: pointed right here he made two out of the\n4:54 Comment: certainly was a foul but Lukaku just to give him a little nudge a little bang\n4:57 Comment: next time he comes for a catch he'll be thinking himself I hope he's not round\n5:2 Comment: me Everton with the ten players at the moment with Besic still receiving a\n5:8 Comment: little bit of treatment off the pitch in the meantime here's Petra\n5:15 Comment: Mikel Fabregas space out wide here for Ivanovic which was closed down quickly\n5:22 Comment: by Brendon Galloway\n5:26 Comment: Petro was on the move in the penalty area and then Gareth Barry back there\n5:30 Comment: shielding the Everton defense a job that he's done so well down the years for a\n5:35 Comment: variety of clubs here's Petro for Chelsea now Fabregas quickly to Hazard\n5:43 Comment: and then Mikel now Ivanovic and they've got plenty of white weighting for the\n5:47 Comment: cross\n5:50 Comment: and then Brendon Galloway gets back into his defensive position\n5:52 Comment: here on the box\n5:52 Comment: to make an important challenge on Branislav Ivanovic.\n5:55 Comment: Yeah, we see Basic just coming on now, and he is.\n5:57 Comment: Glenn was right, he's holding his hamstring,\n5:59 Comment: so it's definitely a hamstring injury,\n6:1 Comment: and I'm astonished to see him on the pitch still.\n6:3 Comment: Yes, Hazard wriggling away.\n6:4 Comment: We hear that Stephen Naismith is preparing himself on the far side.\n6:8 Comment: Away by Jackie Elka, not very far.\n6:10 Comment: Now Kona, they're a little bit boxed in here, Everton.\n6:14 Comment: And in the end, Aspilicueta runs out of room,\n6:18 Comment: and Everton get the goal kick,\n6:20 Comment: but it was a decent pressure there from Chelsea, Glenn.\n6:21 Comment: Yeah, you saw different phases there of Chelsea.\n6:24 Comment: They looked as if they're at it with the ball,\n6:26 Comment: they're crisp, their movement's excellent.\n6:28 Comment: Hazard's coming off his perch, coming in there, causing problems.\n6:31 Comment: Pedro will do the same,\n6:32 Comment: and Everton have really got to be concentrated defensively.\n6:42 Comment: Seamus Coleman.\n6:45 Comment: He's set without his usual partnering crime\n6:47 Comment: in the other full-back position for the moment, Leighton Baines.\n6:50 Comment: Pedro wins it back.\n6:52 Comment: He's got a good shot for Chelsea,\n6:53 Comment: and then was looking to set Hazard away.\n6:57 Comment: Lovely little knock-back again, wasn't it, from Pedro there.\n6:59 Comment: Classy.\n7:1 Comment: Just saw someone running right at him.\n7:2 Comment: He slips it through the legs.\n7:6 Comment: It's interesting, though.\n7:7 Comment: You put a shape up at the beginning of the game of Chelsea,\n7:9 Comment: and when they're in possession, that shape just goes out the window.\n7:12 Comment: They've got so much good movement with Pedro, Hazard making movement.\n7:16 Comment: They're really doing to change well at the moment.\n7:21 Comment: Certainly will work out in the finalход years.\n7:26 Comment: It got Eh differentiate from their preferential loop with Barclay,\n7:30 Comment: which is the victory constituted by\n7:32 Comment: interconnectdd in a groansome hashtag in L Привет\n7:35 Comment: to deliver the half-reu Notice the movement before mule's\n7:38 Comment: and to when headway wins it.\n7:40 Comment: That ball's almost done.\n7:41 Comment: показd e Ciutat to lead by two minutes will be relocated\n7:44 Comment: e to construct the immediate approach of\n7:46 Comment: Escobar to Todo Ridaer and Plat early.\n7:48 Comment: Pap Film's going to show the latest greatinterview,\n7:51 Comment: This is his initial injury, you see there, his left leg just almost...\n7:57 Comment: Well, it goes there, I know exactly that feeling.\n8:1 Comment: I'm just so surprised he came back onto the pitch,\n8:3 Comment: because once you do that and you see his reaction,\n8:6 Comment: he knew he'd done something bad.\n8:11 Comment: And up to the place, number 14, Steven Nesmith.\n8:17 Comment: So, Besic's opportunity in the absence of Tom Cleverley lasts less than nine minutes.\n8:23 Comment: And Steven Nesmith, who got the winning goal here the last time Everton beat Chelsea\n8:28 Comment: in the Premier League at Goodison Park,\n8:30 Comment: is the man that's going to be sent on by Roberto Martinez.\n8:43 Comment: Slightly different type of player, isn't he, Nesmith, Glenn?\n8:46 Comment: Yes, he certainly is.\n8:47 Comment: He's just going to fill the same role, though.\n8:48 Comment: He's come out here on the left-hand side.\n8:50 Comment: He'll work up and down.\n8:52 Comment: And Ivanovic is pushing himself way, way forward.\n8:54 Comment: So I think he's going to have to tighten up and get across and help the full-back out.\n9:0 Comment: That's Mikel providing a bit of muscle in central midfield,\n9:2 Comment: which is what he's been brought in to do today by Jose Mourinho.\n9:6 Comment: Chelsea's worst start to a season for 20 years, three defeats already.\n9:10 Comment: They only lost four matches in all competitions over the whole of last season,\n9:14 Comment: 50-plus games,\n9:16 Comment: which illustrates the fact that they're going to be a tough team.\n9:17 Comment: 50-plus games, which illustrates the fact that they're going to be a tough team.\n9:17 Comment: It illustrates just how out of character this start has been\n9:20 Comment: for the defending Barclays Premier League champions.\n9:22 Comment: But they started well here, and Tetra in particular getting on the ball early.\n9:26 Comment: Now Ivanovic, and Galloway not for the first time across quickly\n9:31 Comment: to be in the right place to block the Ivanovic cross.\n9:34 Comment: He did particularly well there, he just held up play a little bit.\n9:36 Comment: Naismith got caught, and you see him there,\n9:38 Comment: he got caught on the other side of the pitch and all of a sudden it was 2v1.\n9:41 Comment: He just held his ground, held his ground for a bit of time,\n9:44 Comment: went with the runner, good defending from the youngster.\n9:47 Comment: He was the under-21s player of the year last season, Brendan Galloway,\n9:50 Comment: still only 19, started the first three Premier League matches of the season.\n9:54 Comment: And back in today with Leighton Baines still out.\n9:58 Comment: Here's the corner from Pedro, and the defending done this time by McCarthy.\n10:5 Comment: Back in by Fabregas towards Zouma,\n10:8 Comment: who was just able to get half a yard in front of Gareth Barry\n10:11 Comment: but couldn't find the right finish.\n10:14 Comment: As the corner comes in there, just one interesting thing\n10:16 Comment: is Naismith marking Ivanovic, that to me looks like a bit of a miscalculation.\n10:22 Comment: I think if Chelsea see that from the bench, or Ivanovic gets a signal,\n10:25 Comment: they've got to play to him, great space and let him be 1v1 with him,\n10:29 Comment: because he'll out-moss him.\n10:46 Comment: THEY CHANT\n10:59 Comment: A real press from Chelsea, hasn't there, early on?\n11:2 Comment: Trying to prevent Everton from playing out from the back,\n11:4 Comment: which is what they like to do.\n11:7 Comment: Here's Kone.\n11:9 Comment: Seamus Coleman's made a really good run forward from right back,\n11:11 Comment: but Kone couldn't quite get it out to him, although he will now.\n11:16 Comment: THEY CHANT\n11:20 Comment: Here is Coleman.\n11:23 Comment: And there's a more whip for Everton here from McCarthy.\n11:27 Comment: And in it goes towards Naismith,\n11:28 Comment: who just tried to ghost in towards the far post and get in behind Ivanovic.\n11:36 Comment: Yeah, it's a good, decent ball in, isn't it?\n11:38 Comment: Ivanovic has closed himself off, really, not really aware of Naismith,\n11:42 Comment: it's inches from him getting in on the back post,\n11:45 Comment: but that attack comes in,\n11:46 Comment: and it comes from John Stones, not panicking,\n11:48 Comment: in front of his own penalty area, under pressure from Costa,\n11:51 Comment: football in centre-half, goes inside him and sets up an attack.\n11:56 Comment: It was a real goals feast last season when the sides met.\n11:58 Comment: 6-3 to Chelsea.\n12:0 Comment: Six of the nine goals were scored in the second half.\n12:3 Comment: It was a day as well where Everton had 61% of the possession,\n12:6 Comment: or there or thereabouts, and still conceded six goals at home.\n12:11 Comment: Both of these sides at this stage of the season without a home win so far,\n12:14 Comment: Chelsea and Everton.\n12:16 Comment: advances in the top three at the moment.\n12:31 Comment: Here's Azpilicueta.\n12:33 Comment: Of course, Babba Rachman was one of the players brought in by Chelsea\n12:37 Comment: during the window, he's not even on the bench today,\n12:39 Comment: the young Garnier in international.\n12:46 Comment: Naismith going quickly for Everton, now Barron, Lukaku.\n12:53 Comment: A little fall for Naismith, but it will work its way through here to Ross Barkley.\n13:1 Comment: Well, Galloway, it's good football this from Everton,\n13:3 Comment: Ivanovic, though, manages to nick it back for the champions,\n13:7 Comment: and now Matic can bring Chelsea the other way.\n13:11 Comment: Here's Hazard.\n13:12 Comment: Ted's run.\n13:13 Comment: Galloway again, working back well defensively and getting the ball back for his team.\n13:19 Comment: Had a really good start, left-back, the youngster Galloway.\n13:22 Comment: Yeah, it's a big test for him, we mentioned at the start of the game,\n13:24 Comment: against the experience of Pedro Ivanovic, trying to support him as well,\n13:28 Comment: so a lot of the time he's had two men but done well so far.\n13:32 Comment: Of course, Howard Webb with us again here at Goodison Park today in the truck,\n13:36 Comment: any contentious decisions that we need Howard's assistance with,\n13:39 Comment: and he will provide it during the course of the game here on the pitch.\n13:42 Comment: And he will be back on VT Sport.\n14:0 Comment: It's neatly done by Barry.\n14:1 Comment: Here's Lukaku.\n14:4 Comment: McCarthy looking to get it forward slightly quicker this time,\n14:7 Comment: Aruna Kone.\n14:12 Comment: Ivanovic is always going to be favourite for that one.\n14:19 Comment: Lovely quick ball from McCarthy, and that's what Everton have got to do,\n14:22 Comment: when they can play forward, can they play it forward quickly?\n14:24 Comment: Here you see Ivanovic here, already done his defensive duties much better.\n14:29 Comment: That's been a question mark about him this season,\n14:32 Comment: and he looks like he's got a real defensive head on him.\n14:35 Comment: A little kick out there wasn't it from Naismith,\n14:37 Comment: but he did kick the ball first and then just had a little bit of a follow-through of Ivanovic,\n14:40 Comment: and I know exactly where he's coming from.\n14:41 Comment: Oh, snap.\n14:42 Comment: That's for a slight end of the world,\n14:44 Comment: as Leverkusen just got shielded out,\n14:45 Comment: you can't get past them to get to the ball.\n14:52 Comment: Jackie Elkir away.\n15:1 Comment: How did Chelsea look in midfield for you, Glenn?\n15:3 Comment: We talked about the balance this morning,\n15:4 Comment: we talked about the fact that Jonovi and Mikel's come in alongside Matic,\n15:7 Comment: are they slightly more solid in there?\n15:9 Comment: Much more solid, Fletch, much more.\n15:11 Comment: Here's Diego Costa, Hazard sends him away,\n15:14 Comment: still Diego Costa, really good defending by Kylian Mbappe.\n15:18 Comment: The kind of chance last season, Michael, that Costa would have gobbled up.\n15:21 Comment: Well, I think he was just waiting for the penalty there,\n15:23 Comment: I think he was thinking Jagielka was going to make a little contact\n15:26 Comment: and then he would go down,\n15:27 Comment: because it was certainly an area where you think it's going to be virtually impossible to shoot,\n15:32 Comment: he either needs to cut back inside or win a penalty.\n15:34 Comment: Just a little bit of a far out, bit of a bad angle to let one go.\n15:41 Comment: Just getting back to that Chelsea point in midfield there, Fletch,\n15:44 Comment: definitely Matic and Mikel not getting in front of the ball,\n15:48 Comment: staying behind the ball, even when Chelsea are in possession.\n15:51 Comment: It's him pressing all the time, doing his job,\n15:53 Comment: but they're protecting the two centre-halves and allowing the four up front to really go and play.\n15:58 Comment: We also saw the benefit there, Gleneva goalkeeper with a decent first touch,\n16:1 Comment: that was fizz-backing, wasn't it, to Tim Howard.\n16:5 Comment: Here's Galloway.\n16:11 Comment: Now Naismith.\n16:14 Comment: It's good skill to get away from Matic, and then Galloway and Everton are looking on the goal here,\n16:17 Comment: and Naismith has come off the bench to score the opening goal against Chelsea,\n16:22 Comment: just to add to Jose Mourinho's early season troubles.\n16:33 Comment: Well, for a lad of his size, he doesn't half-win some headers.\n16:36 Comment: There's another one to go on his tally, fantastic play down the left-hand side again,\n16:40 Comment: we mentioned him earlier, Brendan Galloway,\n16:43 Comment: he's given Chelsea something to think about now,\n16:46 Comment: he's started with Naismith and finished with Naismith, good turn,\n16:49 Comment: and that's a fantastic ball in that corridor that we always talk about,\n16:53 Comment: between the defence and the goalkeeper,\n16:55 Comment: and he keeps it down, does Naismith, lovely header.\n17:0 Comment: That's a great run into the box from Naismith, he's played it,\n17:3 Comment: and he's gone again, but for me, Zouma's sleeping,\n17:5 Comment: Zouma's got to get across, he's got to be on the goal side of Naismith,\n17:9 Comment: and he clears that, he's sleeping.\n17:12 Comment: Well, it's an early birthday present for Naismith,\n17:15 Comment: who's 29 on Monday, scored the winner the last time Everton beat Chelsea,\n17:20 Comment: and he's got the Merseysiders ahead inside 18 minutes here at Goodison Park,\n17:24 Comment: and it's another problem to add to the growing list for Jose Mourinho in Chelsea.\n17:37 Comment: There's Mikel.\n17:39 Comment: CHEERS\n17:42 Comment: Now, Aspilicueta,\n17:44 Comment: the noise has just been ratcheted up an extra notch since the Everton goal.\n17:49 Comment: Aspilicueta, the Chelsea challenge there by Seamus Coleman,\n17:53 Comment: and then Aruna Kone via John Stones able to get it away.\n17:57 Comment: They certainly don't lack for confidence, do they, Everton,\n17:59 Comment: when they play it out from the back.\n18:1 Comment: Yeah, and it stands on the back now, and it stands on John Stones, that calm and influence.\n18:5 Comment: CHEERS\n18:13 Comment: That's what you call an impact off the bench, Glenn, isn't it?\n18:16 Comment: Well, it is, and sometimes, you know, I don't think Martínez would have been ever thinking of making that substitution,\n18:20 Comment: but by injury, Bezic has to go off, and Naismith's come on and made the difference.\n18:25 Comment: And he looks dangerous. What I liked about his goal is he played,\n18:27 Comment: he didn't stand and watch his good pass, he got himself in the box.\n18:33 Comment: Jose Mourinho made the decision before the game to bring back John Terry,\n18:36 Comment: and Terry with Kurt Zouma today, Gary Cahill is amongst the Chelsea subs today,\n18:41 Comment: having played for England during the international break.\n18:44 Comment: Neither centre-back can do anything about the Steven Naismith header.\n18:48 Comment: Here come Everton again with Seamus Coleman, and they've got plenty in blue to pick out as well.\n18:53 Comment: In it goes towards KONE!\n18:55 Comment: BEZIC'S FINGER-TIP TO THE FOOTBALL\n18:56 Comment: Begovic got a finger-tip to that, fantastic save.\n18:59 Comment: Everton so close to a second goal, they look so threatening when they come forward.\n19:3 Comment: Yeah, great save from Begovic, but again, I thought,\n19:5 Comment: Coleman was gonna swing it in straight away, because Everton had the numbers.\n19:9 Comment: Look at that, three men in the box, not a bad header from KONE,\n19:12 Comment: just didn't quite have the power on the cross to get the necessary power.\n19:17 Comment: And Barkley somehow gets the short corner back again.\n19:23 Comment: Now McCarthy, Everton play with so much confidence, and they test Begovic again.\n19:27 Comment: And for the second time in quick succession, equal to it.\n19:31 Comment: Yeah, great spell of football from Everton now, really getting confidence from the goal,\n19:34 Comment: they've got good strike, good save again, Begovic right on good form.\n19:42 Comment: Everton can keep the pressure on with the corner, which is delivered in by Barkley this time.\n19:46 Comment: Cleared as far as Naismith.\n19:49 Comment: Now Barkley.\n19:53 Comment: That's Pellegrini and Diego Costa combining to win it back,\n19:56 Comment: and then Galloway quickly on Pedro, but this is looking like a big five minutes or so for Chelsea, isn't it, Glenn?\n20:2 Comment: Everton really have their tails up.\n20:3 Comment: Yeah, he's gone.\n20:4 Comment: Yeah, they've got to show a lot of character, it's not just about silky football.\n20:7 Comment: This is the ball in from KONE, it's a decent header,\n20:10 Comment: and what a great save, fingertip save, he's half anticipated it, but lovely ball from Coleman.\n20:16 Comment: And that's a decent header, he's hit the target, wonderful save.\n20:20 Comment: But no, it's a testing time for Chelsea now, this five minute, they've got to weather the storm,\n20:24 Comment: compose themselves and keep believing, getting them to the top four players.\n20:27 Comment: Those players up front, there's something going to happen if they keep believing in themselves.\n20:34 Comment: They have to manage, that's the second attack and the second goal of the second league.\n20:38 Comment: That's what I know, I'm always watching Eиваем,\n20:41 Comment: and now as we've seen the game starting, it's very difficult to pre-evaluate the weave,\n20:46 Comment: so it's one of tiger still going down to council here at Arsenal.\n20:49 Comment: See a line has been saved quite fast.\n20:51 Comment: Nice groin draw in the back there fromании gifts for K Zainder,\n20:54 Comment: and a tiny bit of tackle by work.\n21:0 Comment: probably quite frightening for him, but he's got that in him, hasn't he?\n21:3 Comment: He's got that real nasty streak in him, Costa, that's what makes him tick.\n21:6 Comment: Maybe looking for something to get him going again as well.\n21:8 Comment: He's only got the one goal this season, in fact he's only scored four times\n21:12 Comment: in his last 17 Chelsea appearances back towards the end of January.\n21:16 Comment: He was so lethal in the early weeks of last season, Costa.\n21:20 Comment: Here's Naismith with another one!\n21:21 Comment: And Everton double the lead!\n21:23 Comment: And what an introduction, Stephen Naismith!\n21:30 Comment: Well, Chelsea are giving Everton all kinds of space,\n21:36 Comment: and they're running rampant in these last few minutes.\n21:39 Comment: Ivanovic, he's backing off, that's his man.\n21:43 Comment: Taking off and away from Naismith.\n21:46 Comment: He gets the ball in a bit of space, opens himself up and thumps it with his left foot.\n21:51 Comment: You see Everton breaking, and it's just too easy,\n21:54 Comment: they're getting on to the back four of Chelsea.\n21:56 Comment: Ivanovic, he does nothing, he stands there,\n21:59 Comment: you either force him wide or you just...\n22:0 Comment: or you close him down, and he just stands and stands and invites the shot.\n22:4 Comment: Well, you're going to do that, pick that out the back of the net.\n22:8 Comment: Chelsea were so solid as they virtually cruised to the Championship last season, Glenn,\n22:13 Comment: but they are being ripped apart here by Everton.\n22:15 Comment: Well, they are, and Mourinho's got a massive problem.\n22:18 Comment: He's put Mikel in there and told Matic and Mikel to stay in there and make it nice and tight,\n22:22 Comment: and they're 2-0 down with 22 minutes gone.\n22:25 Comment: So he's got to do something from the bench here, he's got to look more attacking.\n22:29 Comment: He's going to have to change his midfield.\n22:30 Comment: If he's going to change his midfield shape, then go for it a little bit more.\n22:33 Comment: Big, big problems for Chelsea, and that man shows Mourinho.\n22:37 Comment: 2-0 down to Everton.\n22:41 Comment: And just listen to the atmosphere inside Goodison Park now.\n22:54 Comment: I won't mind, but Bagovic has made a couple of fantastic saves already.\n22:58 Comment: Obviously, there's been two.\n23:0 Comment: But it could have been four for Everton already.\n23:3 Comment: Chelsea really haven't threatened Everton's back four at all yet.\n23:7 Comment: 2-0 scoreline is fully justified.\n23:11 Comment: Here's Costa.\n23:13 Comment: Now Matic.\n23:14 Comment: Costa has just left one of the Everton players on the ground.\n23:20 Comment: And the attack continues with Pedro.\n23:21 Comment: He's just popped up on the left-hand side this time, but he's got what's on the shot.\n23:25 Comment: And Tim Howard had it covered, and Seamus Coleman back on his feet\n23:28 Comment: after that collision with Diego Costa.\n23:30 Comment: Costa.\n23:34 Comment: Well, these two have had a little bit of previous, haven't they?\n23:36 Comment: You just see the flailing arm there of Costa.\n23:39 Comment: Flicks Coleman in the face.\n23:44 Comment: Lucky that the referee didn't see that.\n23:51 Comment: We talked about the problems, Glenn, that Jose Mourinho's got.\n23:55 Comment: What do you do? Put yourself in his position.\n23:57 Comment: 24 minutes gone and 2-0 down. What's the next step?\n23:59 Comment: Let's see.\n24:0 Comment: He's got to change the shape in that midfield and go a bit more offensive.\n24:3 Comment: You know, it's no good hanging on to this result.\n24:6 Comment: He's got to get a goal and then build from there.\n24:9 Comment: But, you know, they've got the players to do that.\n24:12 Comment: But at the moment, they're all over the place.\n24:14 Comment: Pedro.\n24:15 Comment: He's looking to try and play it through towards Fabregas,\n24:18 Comment: who made a run from midfield.\n24:19 Comment: Now Matic.\n24:23 Comment: Chelsea have now conceded 11 goals\n24:25 Comment: in what is their fifth Premier League match of the season.\n24:29 Comment: They've conceded more goals.\n24:30 Comment: They've conceded more goals than any other side.\n24:31 Comment: Sunderland the nearest to them with 10.\n24:33 Comment: Of course, Chelsea have played 24 and a half minutes more than them so far.\n24:37 Comment: But just not something you associate with the Mourinho side.\n24:40 Comment: Easy to score on.\n24:42 Comment: And that's been the problem in the early weeks of the season for them.\n24:44 Comment: And it's very much in evidence here today.\n24:46 Comment: Barkley caught there.\n24:47 Comment: Goal!\n25:8 Comment: Quickly on Kone.\n25:13 Comment: Here's Ivanovic.\n25:14 Comment: She might just be thinking twice now about getting forward so much down the right-hand side.\n25:22 Comment: Hazard.\n25:24 Comment: Now Costa.\n25:28 Comment: Mikel.\n25:28 Comment: THEY CONFER\n25:34 Comment: John Terry, and they've worked it nicely here, Chelsea,\n25:37 Comment: and they've got options here, and Azpilicueta might go himself.\n25:41 Comment: Well, he did do, and Tim Howard, for the first time, really,\n25:43 Comment: called into action and made an important save there for Everton.\n25:47 Comment: Yeah, Kony needs to know what he's doing here.\n25:50 Comment: He hasn't got a clue where Azpilicueta is.\n25:53 Comment: Takes John Stones to come across and save his mate there.\n25:58 Comment: I thought initially that Tim Howard might have got a touch,\n26:2 Comment: but it is John Stones who's steered it behind.\n26:4 Comment: Here's the corner, which is very deep towards John Terry,\n26:7 Comment: who wins it for Chelsea, away by Aruna Kone.\n26:13 Comment: Now Matic.\n26:15 Comment: Big men have stayed forward here from the corner for Chelsea,\n26:18 Comment: Matic's looking to deliver it,\n26:19 Comment: and Gareth Barry standing tall defensively for Everton.\n26:25 Comment: Yeah, they're still going to have to defend well, Everton.\n26:28 Comment: They're still going to have to defend well, Everton.\n26:28 Comment: You know, 2-0 up, Chelsea are going to throw everything at them.\n26:31 Comment: And it goes from Matic again, again, it's Gareth Barry with the header.\n26:35 Comment: And then a really nice knockdown by Lukaku,\n26:38 Comment: and here's the pace of Kone.\n26:40 Comment: Everton flooding forward.\n26:42 Comment: Romelu Lukaku, the target, couldn't quite reach it first time.\n26:45 Comment: Still not away for Chelsea.\n26:47 Comment: Lukaku, really good cross, well defended by John Obi Mikel.\n26:52 Comment: How important might that clearance turn out to be?\n26:54 Comment: And then Juventus back down in third.\n26:57 Comment: And corazón Makio.\n27:0 Comment: Do you see that?\n27:1 Comment: So Farley.\n27:2 Comment: And ikke Itaki fantastic and lost football.\n27:5 Comment: Yes, yes.\n27:7 Comment: In that third Paul decisively led the Game 3,\n27:9 Comment: till now it had fallen.\n27:14 Comment: And Luuk Antwerp and Mariner stood literally a yard or two away,\n27:18 Comment: gives the free kick.\n27:19 Comment: Some respite...\n27:20 Comment: to Chelsea.\n27:21 Comment: Another opportunity though for Everton.\n27:23 Comment: It was.\n27:24 Comment: Just moments before that.\n27:35 Comment: Here's Ivanovic.\n27:36 Comment: Next goal is the full-time, 21 minutes, 19 seconds.\n27:44 Comment: Hazard has been able to really stamp his authority on the match so far,\n27:48 Comment: it's been a problem for the Footballer of the Year\n27:50 Comment: in the early weeks of the season.\n27:52 Comment: He's got to get the free kick here for that lunging challenge\n27:55 Comment: by the Everton captain, Phil Jagielka.\n27:59 Comment: He's got a foul for his team, he's come over on the right side,\n28:2 Comment: he's been out on the left, through the centre,\n28:4 Comment: trying to seek the ball, but just a little bit of a foul there,\n28:7 Comment: Jagielka, and they've gone asleep.\n28:9 Comment: Here's Ivanovic from the quick free kick, Galloway,\n28:11 Comment: they woke up quickly and then Gareth Barry, not for the first time,\n28:14 Comment: gets in there to win it back for Everton,\n28:16 Comment: and here they come again with Naismith, if he can beat Mikel to it.\n28:19 Comment: Not this time.\n28:21 Comment: The real problem, though, here,\n28:22 Comment: for Chelsea, Mikel, in transition, when Everton start to break,\n28:25 Comment: they're finding so much space and so many opportunities.\n28:28 Comment: Yeah, and that's why we say first goals in games are so important,\n28:31 Comment: because it almost dictates the shape of the game,\n28:33 Comment: the way the game's gonna pan out,\n28:34 Comment: and obviously Chelsea now need to play possession football,\n28:37 Comment: they need to penetrate Everton, stay in their half, camp in their half,\n28:41 Comment: and Everton have just hit them on a counter-attack with all this pace,\n28:44 Comment: so the game has taken shape.\n28:46 Comment: Saw the counter-attack very effectively at Southampton, didn't we,\n28:50 Comment: on BT Sport a few weeks ago, and it's a...\n28:52 Comment: a similar game here that's developing for them.\n28:56 Comment: Here comes Chelsea, no touch-up, looking to wriggle through,\n28:58 Comment: and John Stones did really well,\n29:1 Comment: and then you see the confidence oozing through the England defender,\n29:4 Comment: with a little crud turn inside the penalty area,\n29:6 Comment: and all of a sudden Everton are going the other way.\n29:8 Comment: Well, that's what he does, he doesn't panic,\n29:10 Comment: he places a footballing centre-half in the Rio mould\n29:13 Comment: and sets his team on attack from the last third,\n29:16 Comment: in the defensive third, it's wonderful to see.\n29:19 Comment: There's Mkharkov, now Barkley.\n29:21 Comment: So much for the game.\n29:21 Comment: So many players in this Everton team playing with so much confidence today.\n29:25 Comment: Barkley to Lukaku...\n29:29 Comment: Now Barry...\n29:31 Comment: McCarthy...\n29:51 Comment: Kovacic...\n29:57 Comment: What a frustration maybe there from Ivanovic.\n30:1 Comment: Steven Naismith won't mind too much though, two goals already.\n30:3 Comment: Kovacic...\n30:5 Comment: Yeah, and he was going nowhere, wasn't he?\n30:6 Comment: He was probably facing a little bit of trouble,\n30:8 Comment: may have had to go back to his goalkeeper,\n30:10 Comment: so he's probably delighted to feel the little clip from Ivanovic.\n30:14 Comment: You look at Chelsea at the moment, last year they were very hard to play against.\n30:17 Comment: You didn't want to play against them, they had pressure, they were physical.\n30:20 Comment: Kovacic...\n30:21 Comment: I think the difference this season is opposition have got time on the ball.\n30:24 Comment: I mean, that's what they were good at, Matic's there,\n30:26 Comment: just as people were arriving on the ball, they were closing.\n30:30 Comment: They haven't done that this season and they're paying the price for it.\n30:33 Comment: They've given too much time and space to teams.\n30:51 Comment: They've been playing for ages and they have done something to the team and now it's time to go back.\n30:56 Comment: It's a good ball out to Diego Costa, he's onside,\n30:59 Comment: although pretty much alone in the final third.\n31:3 Comment: Chelsea was well dealt with by Coleman...\n31:7 Comment: There's Aspilicueta, Diego Costa, not much in the middle though, from a Chelsea standpoint.\n31:13 Comment: Petro was looking to fill the void but Stones was out there quickly to him.\n31:21 Comment: And Barkley gives it away, Pedro for Chelsea.\n31:25 Comment: Now Hazard.\n31:27 Comment: Ivanovic starts to make his way forward from full-back.\n31:30 Comment: Fabregas.\n31:34 Comment: Where is Ivanovic?\n31:36 Comment: Cesc Fabregas.\n31:39 Comment: Lemanja Matic.\n31:42 Comment: Mikel.\n31:43 Comment: Costa.\n31:45 Comment: Looks for the quitters coming to join in.\n31:49 Comment: Costa needs him in the end.\n31:51 Comment: Now Mikel.\n31:52 Comment: They've got a lot of bodies though between Chelsea and Tim Howard's goal.\n31:57 Comment: Ivanovic.\n31:59 Comment: And the block comes in from Naismith.\n32:1 Comment: And that's a Chelsea corner.\n32:14 Comment: So Kurt Zouma has gone to join John Terry in the penalty area for the corner.\n32:19 Comment: Ivanovic was the target.\n32:20 Comment: Pone.\n32:21 Comment: With the header.\n32:23 Comment: Now Pedro.\n32:30 Comment: Hazard.\n32:33 Comment: Placed here by Coleman.\n32:34 Comment: John Terry.\n32:36 Comment: Matic.\n32:37 Comment: Can't find a way through Chelsea.\n32:39 Comment: Costa.\n32:41 Comment: Costa with the delivery when really you want Diego Costa on the end of crosses like that.\n32:47 Comment: Yeah, McCarthy and Barry are doing a very good job.\n32:50 Comment: Just in front of the centre.\n32:51 Comment: Making it very difficult for Chelsea who want to go through the middle at the moment as well.\n32:55 Comment: Making it easy for Everton to defend.\n32:57 Comment: But they've got to break on them quickly as they have been.\n33:9 Comment: Barkley.\n33:9 Comment: And now there's a bit of room here for Seamus Coleman.\n33:13 Comment: This is an Everton Football Club announcement.\n33:16 Comment: Barkley.\n33:17 Comment: More supporters.\n33:18 Comment: And it goes towards Kone and Lukaku away.\n33:21 Comment: Like Terry.\n33:22 Comment: But Everton will get the possession straight back again.\n33:28 Comment: Barkley.\n33:33 Comment: It's worked it nicely here out to Seamus Coleman.\n33:36 Comment: Aspilicueta comes out defensively for Chelsea.\n33:39 Comment: Here's Aruna Kona.\n33:41 Comment: He's got support from McCarthy and from Coleman.\n33:43 Comment: Here is McCarthy.\n33:44 Comment: And the block there by Aspilicueta.\n33:47 Comment: One or two appeals there for a handball.\n33:49 Comment: And the arm was certainly raised by the Spanish international.\n33:51 Comment: Andre Marin are happy to allow the game to continue.\n33:54 Comment: And they've kept it in there through Gareth Barry, Everton.\n33:57 Comment: Here's Kone.\n33:58 Comment: A little clip in towards Lukaku.\n34:1 Comment: And then on towards Nafe, who's on a hat-trick of course.\n34:4 Comment: And he just up-nutters Ivanovic over.\n34:8 Comment: And the look on Michael's face suggests he's not too convinced about that being a free kick.\n34:14 Comment: Yeah, I'm not keen on that at all.\n34:15 Comment: And Ivanovic, he's got a reputation for going down too easy.\n34:18 Comment: He was lucky there.\n34:19 Comment: Because one day a referee won't...\n34:21 Comment: He's got to buy it.\n34:22 Comment: And Everton could have picked the ball up then and gone on the attack.\n34:49 Comment: Petros back on the right side now.\n34:50 Comment: Having had a go on the left against Coleman for a while.\n34:53 Comment: He's back out here against Brendan Galloway.\n35:1 Comment: Here's Ivanovic.\n35:4 Comment: Petro.\n35:6 Comment: Mikel.\n35:7 Comment: Matic.\n35:9 Comment: Matic is going to try.\n35:10 Comment: He's... Look here!\n35:10 Comment: And he hits an absolute beauty!\n35:12 Comment: What a strike from Matic!\n35:14 Comment: And Chelsea back in it.\n35:18 Comment: Wow, it's a thunderball from Matic.\n35:20 Comment: As soon as it left his foot, he was arrowing into that top corner.\n35:24 Comment: And that gets him back in it.\n35:26 Comment: It's a simple throw in.\n35:28 Comment: Not much pressure on the ball, but it's 30, 35 yards out, but he hit it so well.\n35:34 Comment: You can just see the flight of the ball.\n35:36 Comment: It's hardly spinning or anything.\n35:38 Comment: It's just purely struck from Matic.\n35:40 Comment: Thumping finish.\n35:42 Comment: He doesn't score many, does he, the man in Matic?\n35:44 Comment: He got one last season here in the 6-3 win that Chelsea had against Everton.\n35:48 Comment: But you don't hit them any better than that, Glenn.\n35:50 Comment: That's a wonderful strike.\n35:52 Comment: And you pay the price if you don't close players.\n35:54 Comment: Barkley there could have got a little bit tighter, as Ivanovic could have done for Naismith.\n35:58 Comment: And at this level, at this quality, you pay the price.\n36:2 Comment: What a character shown by Chelsea.\n36:4 Comment: Nine minutes before half-time.\n36:6 Comment: And a goal that does change the complexion of this game.\n36:10 Comment: A game that was looking so easy for Everton.\n36:16 Comment: Zadiel Cassandra above Costa.\n36:18 Comment: And the free kick.\n36:20 Comment: The free kick will go Everton's way.\n36:36 Comment: Good control by Koné.\n36:38 Comment: Now Lukaku.\n36:40 Comment: Seamus Coleman.\n36:44 Comment: And they've got four waiting for the cross.\n36:46 Comment: And it goes towards Barkley.\n36:48 Comment: And it's about to go a long way there.\n36:58 Comment: Of course, you make the comparison a lot, don't we, between Manchester City and Chelsea.\n37:4 Comment: As Costa comes forward, people were expecting those two to battle for the Championship.\n37:8 Comment: City yet to concede a goal in the Premier League so far.\n37:12 Comment: Here's Hazard.\n37:14 Comment: Hazard's going to shoot.\n37:16 Comment: And it's almost... took it beyond Howard.\n37:18 Comment: It was a real battle about that shot was being sent in towards Howard's goal.\n37:24 Comment: Between Costa and Jackie Elka as well, just outside the penalty area.\n37:26 Comment: As we've said, the top four players, the four at the top there,\n37:30 Comment: were all rotating, were all getting plenty of the ball.\n37:32 Comment: They're never out of this game, Chelsea.\n37:34 Comment: There's no doubt about that.\n37:36 Comment: Great run from Fabregas, really, to make the space for Hazard.\n37:38 Comment: Here's the Fabregas corner, which is in towards Zouma.\n37:40 Comment: Away by Koné.\n37:42 Comment: It's not been a goal threat so far, Costa.\n37:44 Comment: But he's certainly been a physical threat, hasn't he,\n37:46 Comment: trying to use his size and bulk to disrupt these Everton defenders, Michael?\n37:50 Comment: Yeah, but that's what he offers, isn't it?\n37:52 Comment: Hazard has got a bit of freedom from the corner as well.\n37:56 Comment: McCarthy with the initial challenge, in towards John Terry.\n38:0 Comment: He's got plenty of power on the header, but not quite the direction.\n38:4 Comment: Yeah, pressure's mounting now, isn't it, from Chelsea?\n38:8 Comment: Game has taken a little turn.\n38:10 Comment: They're in the ascendancy.\n38:12 Comment: I think a birdie.\n38:14 Comment: Martínez will be wishing half-time, he'll come now.\n38:28 Comment: Hazard is offside.\n38:34 Comment: So, a huge week coming up on BT Sport.\n38:38 Comment: Champions League tonight, Tuesday, 6 o'clock.\n38:44 Comment: Manchester City versus Juventus.\n38:46 Comment: Half past seven start, that's an Ultra HD as well.\n38:52 Comment: It's on BT Sport Europe from half past seven the following night.\n38:56 Comment: Chelsea against Maccabi Tel Aviv.\n38:58 Comment: That's at 7 o'clock Wednesday, BT Sport 2.\n39:4 Comment: Don't forget that PSV against Manchester United.\n39:8 Comment: Danimo Zagreb against Arsenal.\n39:10 Comment: Both live as well.\n39:12 Comment: And then, the game will be live in the Champions League on BT Sport.\n39:16 Comment: To access all the games, cable and satellite viewers will be able to press red.\n39:20 Comment: And BT TV viewers can select BT Sport Extra on the EPG.\n39:24 Comment: That's all to come from Tuesday on BT Sport.\n39:26 Comment: The Champions League well and truly underway with the group stage.\n39:30 Comment: And Chelsea, of course, have that home match against Maccabi Tel Aviv to come on Wednesday.\n39:34 Comment: And, of course, the Europa League on Thursday, too.\n39:36 Comment: Big week in Europe and a big week on BT Sport.\n39:38 Comment: Here's Petro for Chelsea.\n39:40 Comment: And now Ivanovic.\n39:42 Comment: A bit more threat about the champions now.\n39:44 Comment: Away by Jagielka.\n39:48 Comment: One back by Fabregas.\n39:50 Comment: Here's Ivanovic.\n39:52 Comment: Matic.\n39:54 Comment: And they know he can hit them from here.\n39:56 Comment: He's going to try it again.\n39:58 Comment: Why not?\n40:0 Comment: Gareth Barry with the block.\n40:2 Comment: Corner to Chelsea.\n40:4 Comment: If only Gareth Barry or somebody else had made that block in the first goal.\n40:6 Comment: It was a similar area, wasn't it?\n40:8 Comment: 30, 35 yards out.\n40:10 Comment: And he just took aim.\n40:12 Comment: The two obvious threats.\n40:14 Comment: No defender scored more goals than him in the Premier League era.\n40:18 Comment: John Terry.\n40:20 Comment: And it goes.\n40:22 Comment: Kono for the umpteenth time.\n40:24 Comment: Winning the header from the corner.\n40:28 Comment: There's Petro and now Hazard.\n40:30 Comment: They've just switched off a little bit.\n40:32 Comment: Barry, though, read it well.\n40:36 Comment: And then when the Pels seem to be holding Lukaku.\n40:38 Comment: Andre Mariner disinterested.\n41:2 Comment: Hazard is just finding a little bit more space.\n41:4 Comment: Just a growing influence on the match.\n41:6 Comment: Following the Matic goal.\n41:8 Comment: Now Mikel.\n41:10 Comment: Fabregas.\n41:12 Comment: Costa.\n41:14 Comment: Costa's going to strike one.\n41:16 Comment: And again the block came in.\n41:18 Comment: This time from Stones.\n41:20 Comment: Which took it away from Howard's goal.\n41:22 Comment: Yeah, great play from Stones there.\n41:24 Comment: Because he wouldn't have been able to see much of this ball.\n41:26 Comment: Costa just takes on his back leg.\n41:28 Comment: And then cuts across his front.\n41:30 Comment: Always important not to get too close to the centre forward in that play.\n41:32 Comment: But he's got to get the ball in.\n41:34 Comment: Make sure you can see the ball.\n41:36 Comment: Get the block on.\n41:38 Comment: Chelsea, they're always a danger from the set piece.\n41:40 Comment: And it goes from Fabregas.\n41:42 Comment: And this time it was Zouma attacking it.\n41:44 Comment: The last touch off Jagielka.\n42:2 Comment: And it's a goal.\n42:4 Comment: And away this time by Stones.\n42:6 Comment: As far as Hazard.\n42:8 Comment: Who lines it up.\n42:10 Comment: And the final touch I think came off Ivanovic.\n42:12 Comment: The deflection.\n42:14 Comment: Andre Barron has given the goal kick to Everton.\n42:16 Comment: But he could have gone anywhere that.\n42:18 Comment: Yeah, when you hit it hard and low with that type of power.\n42:22 Comment: He's always got a chance of taking a deflection.\n42:28 Comment: One thought in his mind then as he walks onto it.\n42:30 Comment: Yeah, he steadied himself really well.\n42:32 Comment: And...\n42:34 Comment: You feel the pressure's just building up on Everton.\n42:36 Comment: Half time's going to be a good half time for them.\n42:38 Comment: Didn't think we'd be saying that midway through the half.\n42:42 Comment: That half time can't really come soon enough for Roberto Martinez at the moment.\n42:46 Comment: But that goal from Matic has changed things a fair bit.\n42:54 Comment: Mikel has caught Coleman who's stayed down.\n42:56 Comment: Everton continue to attack here with McCarthy.\n42:58 Comment: Now Barry.\n43:4 Comment: And we've seen the calmness of Stones.\n43:6 Comment: There's the distribution that didn't quite get Galloway away.\n43:16 Comment: It's really good perseverance though, isn't it?\n43:18 Comment: From the young left back of Everton.\n43:22 Comment: He's got to get back into his defensive position now.\n43:26 Comment: As Fabregas threads it through.\n43:28 Comment: And the flag would have been up against Diego Costa.\n43:30 Comment: Had Tim Howard not been able to deal with it.\n43:32 Comment: Yeah, Costa just started to get the ball.\n43:34 Comment: He's starting to make those runs in behind now.\n43:36 Comment: Getting in between the two centre-halves.\n43:38 Comment: Looking to go in behind rather than to feet.\n43:40 Comment: And it's a danger.\n43:42 Comment: Here's Coleman.\n43:44 Comment: Now Barry.\n43:46 Comment: Clicks on up towards Kone.\n43:54 Comment: So a busy weekend as always after the Champions League and Europa League.\n43:58 Comment: Fletching South. We're back next Saturday 10 o'clock live from Stamford Bridge.\n44:2 Comment: Because we've got a cracker for you next week.\n44:4 Comment: London derby.\n44:6 Comment: Chelsea against Arsenal.\n44:8 Comment: Jake and the team from midday.\n44:10 Comment: That available on Ultra HD.\n44:12 Comment: And of course on BT Sport 1 as well.\n44:14 Comment: Quite a week of football coming up on BT Sport.\n44:16 Comment: Everton 2.\n44:18 Comment: Chelsea 1.\n44:20 Comment: Final minutes of what's been a riveting first half here at Goodison Park.\n44:28 Comment: Here's Diego Costa.\n44:30 Comment: We're at Matic.\n44:32 Comment: Still going here Matic.\n44:34 Comment: And he's looking to tee up Pedro.\n44:36 Comment: Alert defending from Jagielka.\n44:38 Comment: Now Hazard.\n44:40 Comment: Pedro.\n44:42 Comment: Pedro with the shot.\n44:44 Comment: Again it took...\n44:46 Comment: Well I thought it took a deflection.\n44:48 Comment: It's going to be a goal kick.\n44:50 Comment: Just see Matic now just starting to get involved a little bit more.\n44:54 Comment: With Hazard.\n44:56 Comment: With Pedro.\n44:58 Comment: But just a little bit off balance there.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: after four matches. He has been eight points behind before after four games.\n0:4 Comment: It was in his final season at Real Madrid and he went on that season to\n0:8 Comment: finish 15 points behind Barcelona. He is a front\n0:12 Comment: runner, notoriously Jose Mourinho, but he's got a different\n0:16 Comment: set of problems to deal with at the moment, although there were signs towards the end of the first\n0:20 Comment: half with a Matic goal that the tide may be turning.\n0:30 Comment: The ball is forward in the second half by Mikel, which is away by Seamus Colvin.\n0:40 Comment: And it's Aruna Kone.\n0:43 Comment: Matic with the challenge for Chelsea. It was a case of Chelsea possession in the first half and Everton being very effective on the counter-attack, Michael, particularly for the first half an hour or so.\n0:55 Comment: I wonder what the respective managers might have done at half-time just to check on the game.\n1:0 Comment: Did they change things in their favour?\n1:2 Comment: Well, I think Glenn mentioned in the first half that it could have been a totally different conversation at half-time hadn't the Matic goal gone in.\n1:10 Comment: And then Chelsea put Everton under a lot of pressure at the last part of that first half.\n1:14 Comment: So I don't think they'll be changing too much. More of the same, I'd say, from Jose Mourinho.\n1:19 Comment: And obviously from Roberto Martinez, he just needs to get back to how they were doing in the first part of the game.\n1:25 Comment: It's not easy when you've got so many top players like Chelsea. You have to stem that tide.\n1:31 Comment: I just felt Chelsea were too far in the centre of the pitch.\n1:33 Comment: Hazard came in, Pedro and Fabregas, all three of them were playing too tight.\n1:37 Comment: Now they've spread a little bit and the movement's become much better for Chelsea.\n1:45 Comment: That was Hazard, who was more influential towards the end of the first half.\n1:49 Comment: Now Fabregas in towards Diego Costa, away by McCarthy this time.\n1:56 Comment: There's Ivanovic.\n2:1 Comment: Matic.\n2:3 Comment: Matic's first Chelsea goal came on this ground last season.\n2:7 Comment: And he scored one to remember in the first half here today.\n2:11 Comment: There's Barriere with a challenge on Hazard.\n2:13 Comment: He's done that well today, Gareth Barriere.\n2:25 Comment: It's his 567th appearance.\n2:29 Comment: In the Premier League today, Gareth Barriere.\n2:31 Comment: And Roberto Martinez will be pleased with what he's seen from his midfielder so far.\n2:36 Comment: Only Ryan Giggs, Frank Lampard and David James have played more games in the top flight than Gareth Barriere.\n2:42 Comment: And he's been strong today, Gareth.\n2:43 Comment: Yeah, he's closed down exceedingly well.\n2:45 Comment: And what he does is he closes when people are receiving the ball.\n2:49 Comment: Whilst he's still got the energy, as people are receiving it, he's actually down their throat getting their heads down.\n2:53 Comment: And he's pinched the ball for Everton today.\n2:55 Comment: Can he continue it for 90 minutes?\n2:59 Comment: Little incidents off the ball again there, Michael, with Diego Costa,\n3:2 Comment: he's not been a stranger to those today.\n3:5 Comment: No, well, there was a flailing arm in the first half on Coleman,\n3:9 Comment: and then there was definitely a little kick-out again there on Naismith,\n3:12 Comment: so he's that type of player, he sails close to the wind, doesn't he,\n3:15 Comment: and you'd say he's one of the bankers to get a yellow card.\n3:18 Comment: That's Lukaku, Matic was tracking back,\n3:21 Comment: but he's so strong, isn't he, when he's on the ball,\n3:24 Comment: and they're begging to test the hurry here,\n3:26 Comment: because McCarthy was applying the pressure.\n3:30 Comment: Made those two really important saves, didn't he, Begovic,\n3:34 Comment: in the first half, when Everton really had their tails up,\n3:36 Comment: they might be very significant for Chelsea today.\n3:40 Comment: Here's Seamus Coleman.\n3:43 Comment: McKellen with the challenge, but Coleman didn't give it up for Everton.\n3:45 Comment: McCarthy to Naismith.\n3:47 Comment: Naismith through towards Lukaku, just reached there by Zouma,\n3:52 Comment: and then Fabregas just caught by Naismith as he played it away,\n3:54 Comment: and that's being brought back.\n3:56 Comment: For a Chelsea free kick.\n4:1 Comment: Yeah, just catches him, there's Fabregas looking to feed Costa early,\n4:4 Comment: he'd gone early, just caught him though as a foul for Chelsea,\n4:7 Comment: but they've given the ball away again needlessly.\n4:14 Comment: The challenge by Zouma on Lukaku, here's Matic.\n4:24 Comment: Hazard.\n4:26 Comment: Costa.\n4:30 Comment: Hazard again, but nobody to really pick out at this stage,\n4:34 Comment: which allowed McCarthy to make the challenge.\n4:45 Comment: Of course, the season's gone by, Glenn, you'd like to see you centre-forward,\n4:48 Comment: leaving a bit on the defenders and that kind of thing,\n4:50 Comment: but he's frowned upon these days.\n4:52 Comment: Diego Costa in days gone by would've been a dream, wouldn't he,\n4:55 Comment: for... for... for... for you.\n4:56 Comment: for managers\n4:56 Comment: I think he does it\n4:59 Comment: too late as well\n5:0 Comment: I mean whilst there's\n5:1 Comment: a challenge to be done\n5:2 Comment: you can understand that\n5:3 Comment: but I think he does it\n5:4 Comment: in between play\n5:5 Comment: he gets himself\n5:5 Comment: all raggled\n5:6 Comment: and he's got to\n5:7 Comment: keep a cool head\n5:8 Comment: he's got to be\n5:8 Comment: thinking about\n5:9 Comment: getting goals\n5:10 Comment: can't do it these days\n5:12 Comment: ten corners\n5:13 Comment: for Chelsea\n5:14 Comment: this one delivered\n5:16 Comment: by Fabregas\n5:17 Comment: and delivered a long way\n5:18 Comment: away by Jagielka\n5:26 Comment: Ivanovic has gone out here\n5:33 Comment: to try the long throw\n5:35 Comment: it's not much of a run up here\n5:36 Comment: but good as some park\n5:38 Comment: some big players\n5:40 Comment: in the Chelsea side\n5:41 Comment: this one sent in\n5:42 Comment: towards Matic and Zouma\n5:43 Comment: and it falls here\n5:44 Comment: for Zouma\n5:45 Comment: and the block made there\n5:47 Comment: by Jagielka\n5:48 Comment: and Zouma again\n5:49 Comment: seemed to use his arm\n5:50 Comment: which the Everton supporters\n5:52 Comment: appealed for\n5:53 Comment: the officials\n5:53 Comment: didn't agree\n5:54 Comment: and he's stayed down here\n5:58 Comment: Zouma as well\n5:59 Comment: and Hazard will kick it\n6:0 Comment: out of play\n6:0 Comment: so his team mate\n6:1 Comment: can get some attention\n6:2 Comment: looks like the right knee\n6:4 Comment: Michael doesn't it\n6:5 Comment: yeah\n6:5 Comment: not good does it\n6:7 Comment: someone goes down\n6:8 Comment: holding a\n6:9 Comment: a knee\n6:10 Comment: let's just hope\n6:14 Comment: it was a bang\n6:14 Comment: and not a twist\n6:15 Comment: because\n6:15 Comment: they're the dangerous ones\n6:18 Comment: looks as if it was\n6:20 Comment: a clash of knees\n6:20 Comment: or\n6:21 Comment: a clash of knees\n6:23 Comment: Barry again there\n6:23 Comment: Gareth Barry\n6:24 Comment: again putting in challenges\n6:26 Comment: all day long\n6:26 Comment: for his team\n6:27 Comment: and that's the job\n6:28 Comment: he's got to do today\n6:29 Comment: I think it's just a clash\n6:30 Comment: of knees\n6:30 Comment: I don't think there's anything\n6:31 Comment: there twisted\n6:32 Comment: he would be the\n6:35 Comment: replacement\n6:36 Comment: if there is anything\n6:37 Comment: wrong with Kurt Zouma\n6:39 Comment: that means he can't carry on\n6:40 Comment: Gary Cahill\n6:40 Comment: who was away on\n6:41 Comment: England duty\n6:42 Comment: would that have been\n6:44 Comment: a difficult decision\n6:45 Comment: for Jose Mourinho today\n6:46 Comment: Glenn\n6:46 Comment: who his centre-backs would be\n6:47 Comment: with John Terry\n6:48 Comment: free from suspension\n6:49 Comment: possibly yes\n6:51 Comment: I think he's gone\n6:51 Comment: for the strength\n6:52 Comment: I think he knows\n6:52 Comment: here at Goodison\n6:53 Comment: he's going to be a tough guy\n6:54 Comment: in Lukaka\n6:55 Comment: strength\n6:56 Comment: and he went for Zouma\n6:57 Comment: and he's nursing\n6:58 Comment: Zouma into his team\n6:59 Comment: he's played him in midfield\n7:0 Comment: at times\n7:1 Comment: in different positions\n7:2 Comment: but I think he sees him\n7:3 Comment: as a centre-half\n7:3 Comment: long term\n7:4 Comment: he's become a dad this week\n7:5 Comment: Kurt Zouma\n7:6 Comment: which is why he wasn't\n7:7 Comment: part of the French squad\n7:8 Comment: for the international break\n7:9 Comment: so it's been a\n7:10 Comment: happy week off the pitch\n7:11 Comment: for the young French international\n7:13 Comment: and he's back on the field\n7:15 Comment: here at Goodison Park\n7:16 Comment: as well\n7:17 Comment: for Chelsea\n7:24 Comment: here's Pedro\n7:31 Comment: just a spin away here\n7:36 Comment: from Seamus Coleman\n7:37 Comment: he's got that low centre of gravity\n7:39 Comment: a fantastic balance\n7:40 Comment: Pedro\n7:40 Comment: couldn't quite link up this time though\n7:43 Comment: with Fabregas\n7:44 Comment: and Coleman can bring it away\n7:45 Comment: for Everton\n7:46 Comment: and Naismith\n7:47 Comment: towards Romelu Lukaku\n7:49 Comment: it was a good idea\n7:50 Comment: from Naismith\n7:51 Comment: always got that option\n7:54 Comment: having to do that\n7:54 Comment: having to put the ball in\n7:55 Comment: behind the Chelsea defence\n7:56 Comment: and allow Lukaku\n7:57 Comment: to run onto it\n7:58 Comment: yeah he works the channels\n7:59 Comment: quite well\n8:0 Comment: does Lukaku\n8:1 Comment: as long as he's a big man\n8:3 Comment: you need him\n8:3 Comment: in and around the box\n8:4 Comment: link and play\n8:5 Comment: but he can\n8:5 Comment: make a good run into a channel\n8:7 Comment: there's Lukaku again\n8:9 Comment: I think it's just\n8:11 Comment: slightly quicker than\n8:12 Comment: McCarthy to it\n8:14 Comment: Chelsea have only lost\n8:24 Comment: successfully\n8:24 Comment: in the Premier League\n8:25 Comment: games once\n8:26 Comment: under Jose Mourinho\n8:27 Comment: it came way back in May 2006\n8:29 Comment: against Blackburn\n8:30 Comment: and Newcastle\n8:31 Comment: and by then\n8:32 Comment: they already wrapped up\n8:33 Comment: the championship that year\n8:34 Comment: so when something's on the line\n8:37 Comment: they don't tend to lose\n8:37 Comment: back-to-back games\n8:38 Comment: in the Premier League\n8:40 Comment: but they're losing here today\n8:42 Comment: on the back of the defeat\n8:45 Comment: against Crystal Palace\n8:46 Comment: before the international break\n8:48 Comment: that's Kennedy preparing\n8:49 Comment: to come on\n8:50 Comment: for Chelsea\n8:51 Comment: the Brazilian player\n8:52 Comment: getting the final words\n8:53 Comment: and instructions\n8:54 Comment: for the Premier League\n8:54 Comment: from his manager\n8:55 Comment: in the meantime\n8:56 Comment: here's Coleman for Everton\n8:57 Comment: loves to burst forward\n9:0 Comment: down this right-hand side\n9:1 Comment: John Terry across for Chelsea\n9:2 Comment: now his challenge\n9:4 Comment: leads to an Everton corner\n9:5 Comment: a positive play from Coleman\n9:10 Comment: getting at John Terry\n9:11 Comment: he's thinking about\n9:12 Comment: taking it on the outside\n9:13 Comment: but good defending\n9:14 Comment: look he's holding him off\n9:15 Comment: stays on his feet\n9:17 Comment: until he needs to go on ground\n9:18 Comment: and make the tackle\n9:19 Comment: experience showing there\n9:20 Comment: Barkley's out here\n9:21 Comment: to take the corner\n9:22 Comment: this time\n9:23 Comment: for Everton\n9:24 Comment: I would approve\n9:26 Comment: I was going to do\n9:27 Comment: any líder\n9:28 Comment: would have been\n9:29 Comment: Ajax\n9:30 Comment: friendly\n9:30 Comment: leave it\n9:31 Comment: lots of mistake\n9:32 Comment: there comes\n9:34 Comment: Westashi\n9:35 Comment: and when\n9:37 Comment: this\n9:43 Comment: much\n9:46 Comment: pressure\n9:46 Comment: made\n9:48 Comment: from\n9:50 Comment: Westashi\n9:51 Comment: it's jumping\n9:52 Comment: on Jericho\n9:53 Comment: now\n9:53 Comment: away from Werder\n9:54 Comment: water\n9:54 Comment: Mikel off and Kennedy on Glenn.\n9:56 Comment: Yeah, you felt always chasing the game\n9:58 Comment: as they are at the moment, 2-1, that there was going to be\n10:0 Comment: more of an offensive look to\n10:2 Comment: Chelsea at some stage in the second half and\n10:4 Comment: Fabregas will slide in that deeper role\n10:6 Comment: and Kennedy's come out here on the left-hand side\n10:8 Comment: so it's slightly personnel change.\n10:10 Comment: I don't think the shape will change. They'll have that rotation\n10:12 Comment: that they've been doing ever so well\n10:14 Comment: all afternoon and it's just a matter\n10:16 Comment: of time. Can they just open\n10:18 Comment: Everton up and get that equaliser?\n10:20 Comment: Only 19, Kennedy.\n10:21 Comment: He signed for just over 6 million\n10:23 Comment: from Fluminense in the summer.\n10:25 Comment: Came on to make his debut against Crystal Palace\n10:27 Comment: before the international break\n10:29 Comment: and he's quickly into the action here.\n10:32 Comment: Mourinho will hope\n10:33 Comment: he can have the same kind of success\n10:35 Comment: that the likes of Oscar and\n10:37 Comment: Willian have had, Brazilian players at Stanford Bridge.\n10:42 Comment: This Fabregas,\n10:44 Comment: slightly lower tempo though, isn't there, about the game in this\n10:47 Comment: second half? It was\n10:49 Comment: slightly pacier and maybe\n10:51 Comment: a little bit\n10:51 Comment: more direct in the first.\n10:53 Comment: Paul Cagey since the restart.\n11:8 Comment: Gets away from Kennedy.\n11:10 Comment: Here's McCarthy.\n11:13 Comment: Phil Jagielka, the Everton\n11:15 Comment: captain.\n11:18 Comment: Galloway.\n11:21 Comment: Looked at Barclay just to see how much time he'd got.\n11:24 Comment: Still going here, Ross Barclay, good feet from the youngster\n11:27 Comment: and then Matic who does do that job so well just outside his\n11:31 Comment: own penalty area, able to use those long legs to win it back\n11:33 Comment: to Chelsea.\n11:37 Comment: And he's no smithing with a challenge on Petro.\n11:40 Comment: And the result is a Chelsea throw.\n11:45 Comment: Yeah, good feet from young Barclay there.\n11:47 Comment: Almost like a slalom, wasn't it?\n11:48 Comment: The way he's gone by Chelsea defenders there.\n11:51 Comment: Look.\n11:51 Comment: Beautiful feet, but Matic's doing what he's very good at.\n11:54 Comment: In and around that penalty area and then distributing it from there.\n12:11 Comment: He's been forward towards Lukaku.\n12:13 Comment: Good positioning there from Terry.\n12:16 Comment: What a ball as well with his left foot.\n12:18 Comment: Hard volley from John Terry.\n12:20 Comment: Really good on the ball.\n12:21 Comment: And then a good ball.\n12:24 Comment: Jackie Elka's challenge on Costa.\n12:26 Comment: It's been a good ground this for Chelsea.\n12:29 Comment: It's been a good fixture as well.\n12:30 Comment: They've won five of the last six meetings between the sides of Chelsea.\n12:35 Comment: Lukaku looking to extend the lead here.\n12:37 Comment: And he's in here, Lukaku!\n12:39 Comment: Straight at Begovic and then a little bit of a mix-up between\n12:42 Comment: Goldkeeper and centre-back.\n12:44 Comment: And the approach and the back-back through.\n12:45 Comment: And you can understand why the crowd and why the Everton players\n12:49 Comment: felt the free kick should have gone their way.\n12:50 Comment: Absolutely.\n12:51 Comment: Yeah, and absolutely.\n12:52 Comment: That's got to be a back-pass.\n12:53 Comment: John Terry's just trying to get out of the way for the goalkeeper\n12:55 Comment: and then just taps it back to him as we see.\n12:58 Comment: He just touches it back to him and he picks it up.\n13:1 Comment: He's waiting for Begovic to come and smother the situation.\n13:4 Comment: Good run again from Lukaku.\n13:5 Comment: Hits it hard and low.\n13:6 Comment: But look at this now.\n13:7 Comment: And he toes it back into his hands.\n13:10 Comment: It's a mistake, I feel, from the referee.\n13:13 Comment: It doesn't say anything in the rulebook about the distance of a pass-back.\n13:17 Comment: That's a pass-back.\n13:18 Comment: And it should be a free kick to Everton there.\n13:20 Comment: But John Terry knows exactly what he's doing.\n13:23 Comment: It's a dangerous position for them.\n13:24 Comment: And his wily experience comes into play there.\n13:28 Comment: Got away with it, though.\n13:35 Comment: And we'll try and get Howard Websey on that when we get the opportunity.\n13:39 Comment: It did seem pretty straightforward for Andre Marr, didn't it?\n13:45 Comment: Here's Ivanovic.\n13:46 Comment: Ivanovic.\n13:46 Comment: Galloway goes across.\n13:51 Comment: Ivanovic still manages to squeeze it in towards Eden Hazard.\n13:54 Comment: And then away by Jagielka.\n13:56 Comment: He seems to be enjoying that physical battle with Costa tonight.\n13:58 Comment: GALLON FANS CHEER\n14:17 Comment: Here's Kennedy.\n14:19 Comment: GALLON FANS CHEER\n14:24 Comment: Howard's talk us through it.\n14:26 Comment: From our position here, that seemed to be a relatively straightforward decision for Andre Marr.\n14:30 Comment: And a back pass, wasn't it?\n14:31 Comment: I'd agree with you, Fletcher.\n14:32 Comment: The only thing that Andre Marr has got to decide is a deliberate action.\n14:36 Comment: I've looked at it. He has a clear view on it.\n14:39 Comment: Unless he thinks he's just hit John Terry.\n14:41 Comment: You can see there's a clear movement by John Terry's right toe towards the ball which goes to Couture.\n14:46 Comment: Unless he thinks he's just hit John Terry. You can see there's a clear movement by John Terry's right toe towards the ball which goes to Couture.\n14:46 Comment: Bye-bye.\n14:46 Comment: That's a back pass.\n14:48 Comment: Thanks, Howard.\n14:49 Comment: That clears that up.\n14:51 Comment: That won't please the Everton supporters, though,\n14:53 Comment: even though Howard's turned it up for us.\n14:55 Comment: They still need 2-1, though, that will please them at this stage.\n14:59 Comment: And it's not been the Chelsea onslaught at the start of this second half,\n15:2 Comment: Michael, that it might have been.\n15:3 Comment: They'd finished the first half pretty strongly,\n15:6 Comment: but they've not been able to pick up where they left off so far.\n15:8 Comment: No, not yet.\n15:9 Comment: Still a long way to go, half an hour,\n15:10 Comment: and that man's still got a couple of substitutions up his sleeve,\n15:14 Comment: hasn't he, if he needs it.\n15:15 Comment: So I'm sure he'll throw a little bit more caution to the wind\n15:19 Comment: as the game progresses.\n15:26 Comment: One or two new faces on the Everton bench.\n15:29 Comment: Aaron Lennon on there.\n15:31 Comment: The Argentine, Ramiro Funes Mori as well,\n15:34 Comment: and Gerard Delefeu, of course, who joined in the summer.\n15:36 Comment: A slightly deeper squad for Roberto Martinez\n15:38 Comment: to pick one following the closing of the transfer window.\n15:43 Comment: He'll be targeting the top six.\n15:45 Comment: Again, this season, as although he needs some significant improvement\n15:49 Comment: from his team to get it, 72 points in 2014,\n15:52 Comment: became 47 last season.\n15:56 Comment: And now here's Lukaku.\n15:58 Comment: Terry over there, and Lukaku from an extremely tight angle\n16:1 Comment: chanced his arm.\n16:5 Comment: Well, I can't believe he was having a shot there.\n16:7 Comment: I think he just mishit across, but Azpilicueta gets drawn out,\n16:10 Comment: leaves that channel that really exposes John Terry.\n16:13 Comment: He doesn't want his full-backs to go too far forward.\n16:15 Comment: Means he has to make the run and follow.\n16:18 Comment: Send the forward into the channel.\n16:34 Comment: Full clearance from Jagielka.\n16:36 Comment: Here's Hazard for Chelsea.\n16:38 Comment: Now Kennedy, Fabregas, Hazard.\n16:43 Comment: Kennedy again.\n16:44 Comment: Had to make a bit of room.\n16:45 Comment: For a shot, maybe.\n16:46 Comment: And then Pedro was trying to slip it through towards Hazard.\n16:49 Comment: Here's the Everton counter-attack that was so effective in the first half,\n16:52 Comment: led by Ross Barkley.\n16:55 Comment: Now Kone, for some reason, had stopped running.\n17:0 Comment: I think he wanted it earlier from Ross Barkley.\n17:3 Comment: Pulled away square.\n17:4 Comment: Shown in the space where he wanted to play.\n17:6 Comment: And I think the young lad, Ross, just probably overplayed\n17:10 Comment: just a slight second.\n17:11 Comment: He thought he was going to veer offside, I think, Kone.\n17:15 Comment: It looked a strange one to me, because I thought Zouma's position was a little bit strange.\n17:22 Comment: Obviously, the ball from Barkley was quite weak and he got away with it.\n17:29 Comment: Away by Fabregas.\n17:30 Comment: Here's Barry.\n17:31 Comment: Now Barkley, what can he do this time?\n17:33 Comment: Fabregas with him.\n17:35 Comment: Lukaku.\n17:38 Comment: Now McCarthy.\n17:42 Comment: Steven Naismith.\n17:43 Comment: Now Kone gets on the ball.\n17:46 Comment: He's got Ivanovic over there with him and he's going to try one himself.\n17:49 Comment: Straight to the big figure of Asmir Begovic in the Chelsea goal.\n17:53 Comment: Who looks to set Hazard away quickly.\n17:56 Comment: Although Jagielka across and then...\n17:59 Comment: Barry alive to things again.\n18:10 Comment: Just wanted to gasp in the crowd.\n18:13 Comment: McCarthy played the ball there.\n18:14 Comment: I think the biggest gasp came from McCarthy as well.\n18:18 Comment: Here's Kone.\n18:20 Comment: Now Barkley.\n18:22 Comment: Challenge by Matic.\n18:23 Comment: Barkley went down.\n18:24 Comment: Kone's trying to win it back here for Everton.\n18:27 Comment: And in the end they get away with it there, Chelsea.\n18:30 Comment: And now Petro can rig it away.\n18:34 Comment: Hazard.\n18:35 Comment: Andre Mariner plays the advantage.\n18:37 Comment: Galloway it was.\n18:38 Comment: He was late in the challenge.\n18:41 Comment: Here's Fabregas.\n18:42 Comment: Now Kone.\n18:43 Comment: Now Costa.\n18:47 Comment: Has to look later.\n18:51 Comment: And it goes towards Hazard.\n18:53 Comment: And Tim Howard took matters into his own hands.\n18:55 Comment: And that would be a Chelsea corner.\n18:58 Comment: Yeah, expect the referee to bring play back a little bit here.\n19:2 Comment: Maybe show the yellow card.\n19:3 Comment: Yeah, good refereeing from Andre Mariner.\n19:5 Comment: Fantastic, yeah.\n19:6 Comment: Good.\n19:8 Comment: Good the way he let play go on.\n19:10 Comment: It was a bad tackle on Pedro actually.\n19:12 Comment: Everton fully deserves a yellow card.\n19:27 Comment: Wonderful break from Chelsea though.\n19:28 Comment: Great bit of football.\n19:29 Comment: From one end to the other.\n19:30 Comment: Four or five passes and they're in behind.\n19:32 Comment: And attacking Everton.\n19:35 Comment: First yellow card of the game there.\n19:36 Comment: Shown by Andre Mariner.\n19:37 Comment: For Brendan Galloway.\n19:39 Comment: In goes the corner towards Pedro.\n19:45 Comment: No touch there for Mike.\n19:47 Comment: Ray Smith.\n19:48 Comment: And a free kick to Everton.\n19:53 Comment: I think even Pedro realises he wasn't going to get that one.\n19:56 Comment: Yeah.\n19:57 Comment: He went down quite easily, didn't he?\n20:0 Comment: Here we see the yellow card and Pedro Mane go.\n20:3 Comment: He just gets the toe in and it's not going to hurt Pedro like that.\n20:6 Comment: But obviously he went to ground and...\n20:8 Comment: You can't do that.\n20:9 Comment: He's Barkley.\n20:10 Comment: Aaron Lennon preparing himself to come on for Everton.\n20:15 Comment: Lennon who was effective on loan from Spurs towards the end of last season.\n20:20 Comment: Signed on a permanent transfer on deadline day.\n20:23 Comment: Fabregas up towards Kennedy.\n20:25 Comment: And he's got it.\n20:26 Comment: He's got it.\n20:42 Comment: The teenager's done well there for Chelsea.\n20:44 Comment: Now Costa.\n20:46 Comment: Ivanovitch.\n20:48 Comment: And that went out.\n21:6 Comment: I think Mourinho looking there pensive\n21:11 Comment: would be a little bit disappointed that Chelsea\n21:13 Comment: haven't peppered Everton's goal\n21:15 Comment: coming in they finished the half really well\n21:17 Comment: they played decent football in midfield\n21:19 Comment: but they haven't really created those chances\n21:21 Comment: that they looked like they were going to do\n21:22 Comment: at the back end of the first half\n21:25 Comment: there's Kona\n21:29 Comment: with a room to turn\n21:31 Comment: in the midfield\n21:32 Comment: and now Nate Smith\n21:33 Comment: and Ivanovic's committed himself and got the ball\n21:37 Comment: and then Kennedy was helping out too\n21:38 Comment: although Nate Smith was determined\n21:40 Comment: and that determination's well inside the corner\n21:43 Comment: yeah it's great isn't it\n21:45 Comment: a few tackles going in the crowd

pace and his width\n23:58 Comment: so the Chelsea change is\n24:0 Comment: Tetreault\n24:1 Comment: replaced by Falcao\n24:3 Comment: and then the ball is in the net\n24:5 Comment: and it's a real positive move by Mourinho\n24:7 Comment: he doesn't normally look to play those two strikers together\n24:9 Comment: but it's he needs the goal doesn't he\n24:11 Comment: so it's probably the right thing to do\n24:13 Comment: but they've got to defend it well as a team also\n24:15 Comment: Barkley gets it back here from Barry\n24:17 Comment: and then Matic manages to stand tall\n24:19 Comment:

decides not to at the far end there's a ball in there\n25:1 Comment: that he decides not to play and then you see the ball in the net\n25:3 Comment: Costa's onside\n25:4 Comment: expecting him to get

position\n25:48 Comment: but this shouldn't be hard really\n25:50 Comment: you know it's a poor ball\n25:52 Comment: it's a miss it ball\n25:53 Comment: you only have to either hit it\n25:55 Comment: it's almost like a pass\n25:56 Comment: either hit it hard and low across\n25:58 Comment: or dink it to the back post\n26:1 Comment: but neither\n26:2 Comment: neither\n26:2 Comment: I think it's a\n26:4 Comment: really it's a\n26:4 Comment: it's an opportunity wasted\n26:5 Comment: Ramon McConaughey gets the evasion from the crowd\n26:12 Comment: and Aaron Lennon\n26:13 Comment: will come

post\n27:18 Comment: knee injury for Falcao in the Premier League remains to be seen\n27:21 Comment: I think that's the key the knee injury that was before the knee injury they were so exciting during that season\n27:27 Comment: Falcao was probably one of the best in the world if not the best striker at\n27:30 Comment: that time he hasn't quite got over that knee injury he's not as sharp but if\n27:35 Comment: you give him chances he'll put the ball back in the back of the net\n27:39 Comment: Willian looks as though he's gonna be the next Chelsea change the final\n27:44 Comment: change

Comment: I'm sure Glenn's going to talk glowingly about John Stones in a second\n29:39 Comment: There's Coleman\n29:41 Comment: quite ten round enough to\n29:42 Comment: it was all about the beginning of that move for you Glenn\n29:44 Comment: It's fantastic to see a young English centre-back playing like that under pressure\n29:49 Comment: you know how he'd come out on the ball through three players\n29:52 Comment: and to certain players some players you say oh that's a risk\n29:55 Comment: that's risky football it's not for him\n29:57 Comment: he does that it's food and drink for him\n29:58 Comment: sets off so many good attacks for Everton\n30:0 Comment: and for me as an international manager\n30:3 Comment: you're looking for players like that\n30:5 Comment: that's where they concede space\n30:6 Comment: teams in the Euros coming up in the summer\n30:9 Comment: they'll give us space at the back\n30:11 Comment: and those players like John Stones\n30:13 Comment: if you've got somebody that can use the ball like that\n30:16 Comment: it's a massive bonus to get your key players on\n30:19 Comment: on the ball in midfield\n30:20 Comment: Is his partner important therefore\n30:22 Comment: if he's going to play it through his own penalty area as we've seen today\n30:25 Comment: does he need a partner next to him who's happy to have it in the back of his hand?\n30:28 Comment: Exactly you can't switch off\n30:30 Comment: because he'll play your balls under and put you under a bit of pressure\n30:33 Comment: so you've got to\n30:34 Comment: it's just it's okay admiring his play\n30:36 Comment: but he's got to be able to do it at the right time for his partner as well\n30:40 Comment: because if not if they're not as accomplished as him\n30:42 Comment: they're going to put them under too much pressure\n30:48 Comment: So 14 minutes to go\n30:52 Comment: We've got Ramiro Funes Mori preparing to come on for Everton\n30:55 Comment: in the meantime here's Costa and now Falcone\n30:58 Comment: and Kennedy who was looking to play it through towards Falcao\n31:7 Comment: Again isn't it? John Stones there cool as you like\n31:10 Comment: almost fainting to swing it away\n31:13 Comment: and just come in as man leaving it back to the goalkeeper\n31:16 Comment: I mean I'm with Glenn\n31:17 Comment: an absolutely fantastic player\n31:21 Comment: So here's the Everton change\n31:22 Comment: Seamus Colvin off\n31:24 Comment: and the Argentina international Ramiro Funes Mori\n31:28 Comment: £9.5 million from River Plate\n31:33 Comment: He's on to make his Everton debut\n31:35 Comment: He was in Houston last Saturday\n31:37 Comment: playing for Argentina against Bolivia\n31:39 Comment: Lionel Messi and Sergio Aguero both scored that night\n31:42 Comment: and here he is on Merseyside to try and see Everton over the line\n31:46 Comment: bidding for their first win at Goodison Park since April\n31:49 Comment: Ivanovic with the cross towards Falcao\n31:54 Comment: Here's Hazard and now Willian\n31:58 Comment: Aspilicueta\n32:0 Comment: Willian\n32:1 Comment: McCarthy's there for Everton\n32:3 Comment: Willian with a bit of acceleration\n32:5 Comment: then Gareth Barry defends the near post well\n32:7 Comment: and clears it away\n32:11 Comment: Here's Aspilicueta\n32:16 Comment: Everton have effectively got everybody apart from Lukaku in a defensive position here\n32:24 Comment: And here's the first goal\n32:26 Comment: and the first goal\n32:27 Comment: It's Sturgeon's first goal\n32:29 Comment: and now it's a left-hander\n32:30 Comment: Yes!\n32:31 Comment: Here's the first goal\n32:33 Comment: and it's a right-hander\n32:34 Comment: And now it's a right-hander\n32:36 Comment: Willian\n32:38 Comment: We'll see John Stone's versatility now with\n32:41 Comment: Ramiro Funes Mori on because he's gonna be at right-back the rest of the way\n32:45 Comment: Here's Hazard\n32:47 Comment: Now Matic\n32:54 Comment: It looks to float one towards the far post\n32:56 Comment: and now Falcao, Willian, Costa, Hazard, Matic,\n33:3 Comment: all waiting for the cross, the deflection brings Chelsea to corner.\n33:8 Comment: This is a real key moment for Everton in the game,\n33:11 Comment: what with 78 minutes, they've made a few changes,\n33:13 Comment: why the new centre-half coming in,\n33:15 Comment: he's not going to be used to playing with Jagielka or anyone else,\n33:18 Comment: and now John Stones has gone to right back,\n33:21 Comment: his substitute's on, Lennon now from set plays,\n33:23 Comment: and I think this is a real key time for Everton to stick in there,\n33:27 Comment: if they get through this 10 minutes they might weather the storm.\n33:30 Comment: John Stones has got Branislav Ivanovic for this one,\n33:32 Comment: Brendan Galloway's got the job of marking Diego Costa,\n33:36 Comment: Stephen Naismith rises to win the header at the back there for Everton,\n33:39 Comment: they cleared a bit further away by Funes Mori,\n33:43 Comment: here's Willian,\n33:47 Comment: and Brendan Galloway showing real composure inside his own penalty area\n33:51 Comment: to take a touch and then clear it away.\n33:57 Comment: Gabe Martel,\n34:13 Comment: Tana Matich.\n34:18 Comment: Zouma.\n34:21 Comment: Kennedy who looks to take a run at Naismith,\n34:24 Comment: he's still going here the young Brazilian.\n34:26 Comment: On the block by Naismith.\n34:32 Comment: There's Willian. Chelsea applying the pressure,\n34:36 Comment: can't find a way through to Tim Howard.\n34:38 Comment: Matic, Kennedy.\n34:44 Comment: Matic again has already hit one from range in the match,\n34:47 Comment: and he's going to try his luck again.\n34:48 Comment: And a missed on the block from Galloway in the corner for Chelsea.\n34:51 Comment: They can't get out, Michael, at the moment, Everton.\n34:54 Comment: No, they can't, but Chelsea aren't carving them open,\n34:57 Comment: they're not getting clear-cut chances,\n34:58 Comment: still waiting for Tim Howard to really be tested in this game,\n35:1 Comment: he's only really picked the ball out the back of the net once,\n35:4 Comment: and that's about it, so Everton defend him really well despite the pressure.\n35:8 Comment: Willian's corner this time.\n35:11 Comment: And it's gone out before it came back in again,\n35:13 Comment: so a wasted opportunity for Chelsea,\n35:16 Comment: and a goal kick that will bring some respite for Everton.\n35:20 Comment: I think on the back of that as well,\n35:22 Comment: Lukaku's got to play a big part.\n35:24 Comment: When your team's defending like this, and they're going to have to,\n35:26 Comment: Chelsea will throw caution to the wind,\n35:28 Comment: if that release ball comes up and it's coming straight back at you,\n35:31 Comment: you build that pressure yourself.\n35:33 Comment: Lukaku's got a massive job, when Everton do get the ball up in possession,\n35:37 Comment: he's got to retain the ball for them so they get a breather\n35:40 Comment: and they can get their team up the pitch.\n35:44 Comment: Of course, Everton get the week off after this before they go to Swansea next weekend,\n35:48 Comment: but Mkhitary Tel Aviv come to Stamford Bridge on Wednesday for Chelsea,\n35:51 Comment: and then they've got the small matter of Arsenal,\n35:56 Comment: to make them a bit better.\n35:59 Comment: Well done by the side.\n36:1 Comment: Another game you'll see on BT Sport next Saturday,\n36:4 Comment: and then the League Cup against Walsall.\n36:6 Comment: It's a really important month or so for Jose Mourinho's team,\n36:9 Comment: with Porto away on the horizon as well,\n36:11 Comment: and the trip to Newcastle,\n36:12 Comment: where of course they lost for the first time in the Premier League last season.\n36:18 Comment: Into the last nine minutes of this one,\n36:20 Comment: Everton 2, Chelsea 1.\n36:54 Comment: Here's Naismith on the hat-trick, and he gets the hat-trick!\n36:57 Comment: And that might well finish off Chelsea!\n37:12 Comment: Simply sensational football by Everton, down on this right-hand side,\n37:16 Comment: again the likes of Stones, Naismith involved in the build-up,\n37:20 Comment: lovely play as well from Barkley,\n37:22 Comment: but look at this, one-touch play.\n37:24 Comment: And then this is a brilliant run, a lovely little diagonal run,\n37:27 Comment: you can see it's onside, Barkley has a great vision.\n37:30 Comment: Not sure the goalkeeper should be coming that far out\n37:32 Comment: and letting anything go underneath him.\n37:34 Comment: If you're gonna come far out, you've got to get low,\n37:37 Comment: make sure someone's gonna go over the top,\n37:39 Comment: but Naismith does all he can, hits it hard and low,\n37:41 Comment: and he's the hat-trick hero of the day.\n37:45 Comment: If you would have said to Naismith this morning,\n37:48 Comment: what do you want for your 29th birthday on Monday,\n37:50 Comment: you might want to have said a hat-trick against Chelsea,\n37:52 Comment: that's what he's got, his first hat-trick in the Neverton shirt,\n37:54 Comment: and that might well seal it, Glenn.\n37:56 Comment: When he took his seat on the bench at the start of the game,\n37:59 Comment: I don't think anyone would have imagined he was gonna score a hat-trick,\n38:2 Comment: but credit to him, he's finished them ever so well,\n38:4 Comment: all three goals, great finishing.\n38:6 Comment: But a great move from Everton, it really was,\n38:8 Comment: one-two touch football, movement off the ball,\n38:10 Comment: all the good things you want to see on a football pitch,\n38:13 Comment: and finished off this time.\n38:16 Comment: The problems continue to mount for Chelsea,\n38:18 Comment: and Chelsea are really our Manchester City winner,\n38:21 Comment: if not a winner.\n38:22 Comment: It's been a little bit of a battle palace this afternoon,\n38:24 Comment: it won't be easy the way Alan Pardew's side are playing.\n38:26 Comment: And Chelsea would be 11 points behind the leaders of the Premier League after five matches,\n38:31 Comment: which would have been unthinkable to everybody\n38:33 Comment: when we did all the predictions during the course of the summer, Michael.\n38:37 Comment: Yeah, definitely, I was in the Chelsea camp before the season started,\n38:41 Comment: thought they were gonna muscle their way to another title,\n38:44 Comment: but as you mentioned, 11 points,\n38:46 Comment: I don't care what time of the season, 11 points is a long, long way back.\n38:50 Comment: Yes, Hazard, six minutes,\n38:52 Comment: and a little bit more to go.\n38:57 Comment: Hazard lifts it in towards Falcao, gets his head to it,\n39:0 Comment: can't find the necessary power,\n39:2 Comment: and it was straightforward in the end for Tim Howard,\n39:5 Comment: half a chance though, wasn't it, for Falcao?\n39:7 Comment: More than half a chance, especially for him, who's so good in the air.\n39:10 Comment: Just pulling back onto that back post, perfect little ball in from Hazard,\n39:13 Comment: I'm expecting him to do a lot better than that, put it that way.\n39:20 Comment: If they do go on to lose this match, Chelsea,\n39:22 Comment: it'll be their worst start to a league season since they were a second division side\n39:26 Comment: under Bobby Campbell back in 1988.\n39:30 Comment: Which really does emphasise just how bad it's been for them\n39:33 Comment: over the first five matches of this Barclays Premier League season,\n39:38 Comment: and just how significant from that statistic the hat-trick is\n39:41 Comment: for Steven Naismith, who's then fouled by Willian,\n39:44 Comment: and he brings a free kick to Everton.\n39:52 Comment: I think in the past, Chelsea, over the years,\n39:55 Comment: we just see this little foul here, a little bit of frustration from Willian,\n39:59 Comment: but they had that little dimension where they could just throw Drogba on from the subs\n40:2 Comment: and just knock balls up to him and play off him,\n40:4 Comment: and that's what got them back in game sometimes,\n40:6 Comment: not the intricate football, but he's got a lot of thinking on his plate now, Mourinho, he really has.\n40:11 Comment: The Everton fan to sing in, you're getting sacked in the morning,\n40:14 Comment: he was defiant in the morning newspapers,\n40:16 Comment: but the problems continue to mount for the special one,\n40:20 Comment: who's not feeling very special at the moment.\n40:22 Comment: Less than five minutes to go, Barkley with the free kick,\n40:25 Comment: and a bit of catching practice in the end for Aspir Begovic,\n40:29 Comment: but it's been a really good performance, hasn't it, today from Everton,\n40:33 Comment: they've had to soak up a bit of pressure at times,\n40:35 Comment: but when the chances have came, they've taken them emphatically.\n40:39 Comment: Yeah, some brilliant performances all over the pitch,\n40:41 Comment: you've seen Young Galloway there making another good tackle,\n40:43 Comment: this lad on the ball has been sensational today,\n40:46 Comment: and a hat-trick hero, there's been so many good performances,\n40:50 Comment: it's been a really good game.\n40:51 Comment: Stones gives it away this time, and then fouls Kennedy,\n40:54 Comment: which is going to bring the free kick to Chelsea,\n40:58 Comment: and he's kicked the ball away there, John Stones, as well,\n41:0 Comment: which I think is going to bring him a yellow card for his trouble.\n41:4 Comment: Just proved he's still a young man, he's got a lot to learn,\n41:7 Comment: he's got tremendous talent there, but again,\n41:9 Comment: he's come out nice and cool on the ball, just overplayed that time,\n41:12 Comment: there was a blue shirt there, don't ruin your good work,\n41:15 Comment: stick it to a blue shirt, get an ovation from the crowd again, just overplayed.\n41:19 Comment: So, Willian over the free kick,\n41:21 Comment: less than four minutes to go if Chelsea are to respond.\n41:25 Comment: They'd better be quick about it.\n41:36 Comment: Willian decides to float one in towards Diego Costa,\n41:39 Comment: and away by Jagielka, back in by Azpilicueta.\n41:44 Comment: Galloway here tussling with Falcao, a Chelsea throw.\n41:51 Comment: Gololy, it isn't safe today.\n41:53 Comment: He's got quite the speed, he's got quite the ball.\n41:54 Comment: And he's been in a whirl.\n41:55 Comment: And he doesn't water the nearby boys like 구\n42:8 Comment: Binks could ever have shown to do,\n42:10 Comment: because you've just gone on the pitch and you think,\n42:12 Comment: well, this might not be enough.\n42:16 Comment: C'est Ivanovic…\n42:18 Comment: Oh, and Stone's just got a bit of room to run into now,\n42:20 Comment: Yeah, Glen will tell you more than me, but I bet your manager's delighted\n42:23 Comment: when your players just do that, you see a foul, come and get a little toe,\n42:27 Comment: kills the game a little bit.\n42:29 Comment: Got a Chelsea player with a yellow card.\n42:31 Comment: Just keeps eating into that clock, and that's what Everton are gonna do now.\n42:50 Comment: FANS ROAR\n42:57 Comment: There's Barkley.\n42:59 Comment: That's it back from Lukaku.\n43:6 Comment: Now Barry, Romelu Lukaku.\n43:20 Comment: FANS ROAR\n43:22 Comment: Well, they've got to play the ball in behind here for Stones,\n43:25 Comment: who gets there ahead of Hazard and delivers it in towards Lennon.\n43:28 Comment: There's Terry back there, and then a missed kick by Haskell at Quetta.\n43:32 Comment: And Everton will have the opportunity to keep the possession.\n43:34 Comment: They're looking to beat inside Chelsea, Glen.\n43:36 Comment: Well, they do,

    "summary": "Everton triumphed over Chelsea with a convincing 3-1 win at Goodison Park, showcasing a blend of tactical discipline and sharp finishing that left Chelsea grappling with yet another early-season setback.\n\nFrom the onset, the anticipation among the Everton fans was palpable. The Toffees had yet to secure a victory at home this season and faced a formidable challenge against Chelsea. Despite only being five matches into the Premier League season, Chelsea, the reigning champions, couldn’t afford another misstep, with the risk of falling significantly behind Manchester City in the title race.\n\nThe game kicked off under sunny skies, with an electric atmosphere enhancing the occasion. Chelsea, donning their traditional blue, immediately set about asserting their dominance. Pedro, who had been given the license to roam, was quick to pressure young Brendan Galloway. Martinez’s decision to field Galloway, who had limited training during the week, seemed risky, especially with Pedro's wealth of experience and aggressive play.\n\nThe opening exchanges highlighted a tactical shift in Chelsea's lineup, with John Obi Mikel making his first start of the season alongside Nemanja Matic in a deeper midfield role. This allowed Cesc Fabregas to push further forward in support of Diego Costa. However, the early balance barely hinted at the dramatic events to come.\n\nEverton's defensive frailties were tested early when a swarm of Chelsea attacks aimed to unsettle the backline. Tim Howard was forced into action, and Ross Barkley found Romelu Lukaku isolated against Kurt Zouma in a telling physical duel, signaling an intense personal battle brewing.\n\nChelsea’s approach, with tight passes and clever movement, kept Everton pegged back. Yet the Toffees found a route to settle into the game, thanks to Galloway's unwavering resolve and John Stones' composed defensive touches, which drew applause from the home fans with his very first touch.\n\nEverton’s first significant opportunity emerged from Barkley's penetrating pass towards Lukaku, thwarted by Zuma only after a nervy hesitation. Further misfortune struck Everton early on, with midfielder Mo Besic forced off the pitch due to a hamstring injury, necessitating an early substitution. Stephen Naismith was introduced to the fray, a decision that would yield unimaginable dividends.\n\nNaismith’s arrival seemed innocuous, but he was quick to disrupt Chelsea’s rhythm. The diminutive forward exemplified Everton’s persistence by forcing Chelsea into errors, and it wasn’t long before the first breakthrough came. A swift move down the left saw Brendan Galloway serve an inch-perfect cross, meeting Naismith’s precise, diving header to give Everton the lead in the 18th minute. The timing of Galloway’s cross and Naismith's clinical finish illuminated Everton's counter-attacking prowess.\n\nChelsea, visibly rattled, saw an enforced shift in their strategy as the hosts found joy in exploiting spaces behind their full-backs. Naismith’s movement, particularly his ability to find pockets of space, continuously stretched Chelsea’s defense. Galloway and Stones combined well to stymie any forward pressure, but Chelsea's discomfort was compounded by a spirited Everton pressing game that forced Chelsea into hasty clearances and misplaced passes.\n\nChelsea's plight deepened ten minutes later. Everton, riding a wave of momentum, found Naismith again in space. This time, the Scottish international seized the initiative from the edge of the box, driving a low shot past Begovic, doubling the lead with a goal that seemed to sap Chelsea's resolve.\n\nJose Mourinho, recognizing the precarious nature of his team’s position, urged his players forward. Chelsea responded by reigning in Everton’s tempo, as intricate play from Pedro and Hazard sought to unsettle the disciplined Everton defense. Fabregas orchestrated from deeper positions, threading passes that pinned Everton back. The continual surge eventually bore fruit when, against the run of expectations, Chelsea found a lifeline.\n\nNemanja Matic’s thunderous strike from approximately 30 yards out in the 35th minute was a moment of sublime individual brilliance. The Serbian midfielder unleashed an unstoppable shot that sailed past Tim Howard into the top corner, reducing the deficit and revitalizing Chelsea’s hopes. The goal’s timing was crucial, granting Chelsea an added impetus heading into the break.\n\nThe second half began with Chelsea maintaining their hunt for an equalizer. Mourinho opted for more offensive vigor, introducing Kennedy in place of Mikel, while Everton made tactical adjustments that included tightening their defensive lines. Galloway, frequently under pressure, diligently shielded his side’s left flank, understanding Chelsea's need to exploit wide areas.\n\nAs Chelsea pressed, they committed more players forward. However, the Toffees, adept in their counter-attacking setup, remained a constant threat. Lukaku's pace and strength kept the visitors on high alert, culminating in Begovic being forced into critical saves.\n\nChelsea sought to capitalize on set-pieces with Fabregas' deliveries pinpointing the towering figures of Zouma and Terry, but Everton's defense, marshaled superbly by Jagielka and Stones, held firm. Gareth Barry, in his 567th Premier League appearance, underlined his value with crucial interceptions and positional acumen, continually disrupting Chelsea's attempts to carve open clear solutions.\n\nEverton, though defensively diligent, continued to probe on the break. Naismith, brimming with confidence, lurked dangerously, galvanizing his side’s forward ventures. In the 82nd minute, Everton effectively sealed the match. A slick passing move saw Naismith released into the right channel. Despite the acute angle, he smartly dispatched his third goal beneath Begovic, completing a remarkable hat-trick and sending Goodison Park into raptures.\n\nDespite Mourinho’s efforts to reinvigorate his side by introducing Falcao and Willian, Chelsea couldn’t muster a significant comeback. Everton, buoyed by Naismith’s heroics and a steadfast defense, comfortably saw out the remaining minutes.\n\nThe victory showcased Everton's potential, reaffirming their resolve and tactical acumen under Roberto Martinez. With players like Stones exuding calmness and maturity, and veterans like Barry leading by example, Everton’s blend of youth and experience presented a formidable challenge to the reigning champions.\n\nFor Chelsea, the defeat amplified their early-season woes, with defensive lapses and a lack of cutting edge in the final third elucidating their struggles. Mourinho’s post-match reflections would inevitably pivot towards finding a remedy to halt the alarming slump, with looming fixtures against Maccabi Tel Aviv and Arsenal presenting immediate opportunities for redemption.\n\nIn essence, the match at Goodison Park captured the contrasting fortunes of both teams – Everton’s ascent fueled by clinical finishing and unwavering determination, in stark counterpoint to Chelsea's unexpected fragility. Naismith emerged as the unequivocal hero, his perfect hat-trick encapsulating a day of vindication for the Toffees, and a day of reckoning for the beleaguered Chelsea."
