sees that\n12:34 Comment: it's a penalty simple as that\n12:36 Comment: just look at that careless careless sloppy defending from Ivanovic\n12:40 Comment: instead of doing his job and blocking the

that\n29:56 Comment: out to Chelsea in the week but not for this as he serves out his domestic ban\n30:5 Comment: I prefer to look when he was on the bench for Chelsea today along with\n30:9 Comment: Pedro\n30:16 Comment: Tadic now Bertrand\n30:20 Comment: Mane\n30:23 Comment: Mane who won a penalty here last year is asking the question as to whether he should have had another\n30:32 Comment: you know and the referee does look as if he's going to put the whistle to his mouth and you\n30:35 Comment: know what once he gets the ball past him and there's a bit of contact he's entitled to ask\n30:40 Comment: the question you'll see he flicks it to the side Ramirez doesn't make contact with the ball there\n30:44 Comment: seems to be a slight touch on his foot all right well within reason to ask the question here you\n30:53 Comment: can see\n30:53 Comment: you can see he's got the ball in the middle of the field\n30:53 Comment: he flicks it in inside of his foot and when you reach out like that Ramirez and you don't get the ball you're always in a little bit of trouble\n31:1 Comment: my first thought was to look at the referee he brought the whistle halfway up his body but then put it back down and wave play on\n31:11 Comment: well two penalty appeals now that Chelsea have been lucky to survive\n31:23 Comment: Mr Rub\n31:25 Comment: Mane\n31:25 Comment: And he goes

puts his hand up and then he takes it down\n31:58 Comment: i think he was close to giving that you know and then poor old money gets himself booked for dive\n32:3 Comment: in a minute later that moment are those two moments boatman chelsea's way and also of course\n32:10 Comment: he's booked him for a dive for that one and didn't book him for a dive when he went down for the\n32:14 Comment: penalty which presumably he thought he had done yeah well here's the dive now what we're calling\n32:19 Comment: the dive is there a touch there from ivanovich oh it wasn't a good 60 seconds for him was it\n32:33 Comment: carding controversies seem to affect this uh picture remember ss fabregas being unlucky to be\n32:39 Comment: booked for one in the previous match against southampton\n32:44 Comment: so if you're the south manager now it is not very insane we should have two penalties\n32:49 Comment: we'll go down they've done not a lot wrong in this game great three kick to william but\n32:54 Comment: so far the river the green has gone chelsea's way\n33:7 Comment: wanyama and again cleared by terry here's victor wanyama now sadio manet\n33:19 Comment: downed and then billy is

Mane.\n34:10 Comment: Tadic.\n34:11 Comment: And in slides.\n34:12 Comment: Ivanovic.\n34:30 Comment: And there it's going into Mane.\n34:31 Comment: Now Mane himself under a bit of pressure with\n34:33 Comment: precautional ready for the dive.\n34:42 Comment: And there it is.\n34:45 Comment: It's Font.\n34:51 Comment: Romelu.\n34:54 Comment: Wanyama.\n34:57 Comment: Good closing down from Chelsea there.\n35:0 Comment: You can see it would have been easy just to back off\n35:1 Comment: and let Sanat come out with the ball.\n35:3 Comment: But there's three players right on.\n35:6 Comment: They wouldn't back.\n35:8 Comment: But sadly with...\n35:9 Comment: A bit careless and gave it away again.\n35:11 Comment: But you can see that there's a bit more...\n35:12 Comment: A bit more spark about Chelsea tonight.\n35:20 Comment: Well Mourinho made it clear.\n35:21 Comment: It didn't matter how they got them.\n35:22 Comment: They had to get the three points here tonight.\n35:29 Comment: Heading in the right direction.\n35:32 Comment: Here we go again.\n35:33 Comment: You can see lots of blue shirts pushed right up\n35:35 Comment: and they're pressing and pressing.\n35:36 Comment: Making it go back to the goalkeeper.\n35:40 Comment: Collectively they're really at it tonight Chelsea.\n35:42 Comment: But it's a good team.\n35:44 Comment: He did it, is it?\n35:46 Comment: There he sƒ±kn –∏—Å–ø worth„Éâ.\n35:53 Comment: What do you think of those\n35:56 Comment: Ironic cheers from the fans.\n36:0 Comment: I think he can't win the ball there.\n36:1 Comment: I think it's a bad one for Cahill to give away.\n36:4 Comment: You just gotta sometimes realize that okay he's ÏãúÏûë production\n36:7 Comment: He's gonna get over it as long as he doesn't do anything with it.\n36:8 Comment: My stay in good shape but he's\n36:10 Comment: giving away and he was free kick there.\n36:11 Comment: He's trying to win a ball.\n36:42 Comment: It's Davies who plays it in, Van Dijk who came in on it and turned behind by Gary Cahill.\n36:47 Comment: Very important interception from Cahill, it was a lovely header across the goal and I think Mane is waiting to tap it in, you'll see as it comes across here, yeah he's at the far post there.\n36:57 Comment: But luckily for Chelsea, great effort from Cahill to get it away out of danger.\n37:4 Comment: Stephen Davies with a corner for Southampton.\n37:12 Comment: And it's a good one for the ref.\n37:19 Comment: I don't want to say in the crowd, it actually appealed to the ref, but he took it seriously that the ball wasn't in the correct position.\n37:30 Comment: Very close to applying a touch.\n37:32 Comment: Here's Waniyama.\n37:37 Comment: And Pekka Visi, having to be careful and he didn't look too certain with that.\n37:40 Comment: Well he was scrambling but he did very, very well.\n37:42 Comment: Because that ball was moving all over the place and may even have taken a little lift.\n37:46 Comment: Yeah I think it's taken a little deflection off Ramirez and it's in a dangerous area.\n37:50 Comment: Begovic does well in the end.\n37:57 Comment: Van Dijk trying to force the goalkeeper a bit of aggravation but he stayed strong then, Azmir Begovic.\n38:7 Comment: Seventh game in a row he started for the injured Courtois, Azmir Begovic.\n38:12 Comment: And even though results haven't always gone Chelsea's way, his performances have generally been of a high standard.\n38:24 Comment: Here's Victor Waniyama.\n38:27 Comment: Kasper Laquetta.\n38:29 Comment: On by Cedric to Dusan Tadic.\n38:34 Comment: Tariq's header clear.\n38:36 Comment: That's what happened, they've done really, really well this last seven or eight minutes.\n38:39 Comment: They're starting to believe that they can get something now.\n38:43 Comment: And their attention a little bit more forward.\n38:45 Comment: I think Koeman will be happy enough with that.\n38:47 Comment: Disappointed with some refereeing decisions.\n38:49 Comment: But his team aren't in awe of Chelsea by any stretch of the imagination.\n39:0 Comment: Here's Van Dijk.\n39:2 Comment: Now Romelu.\n39:4 Comment: Cedric.\n39:6 Comment: Van Dijk.\n39:7 Comment: Cedric.\n39:13 Comment: And over Azpilicueta.\n39:16 Comment: Hazard.\n39:17 Comment: Had nowhere to turn, ran into Tadic.\n39:20 Comment: Mane rides that challenge from Oscar.\n39:22 Comment: Tries to play in Ryan Bertrand!\n39:24 Comment: And Begovic is the hero for Chelsea.\n39:27 Comment: Oh, great save, Begovic.\n39:28 Comment: What a ball for Mane to release Bertrand.\n39:31 Comment: You can see he rides that tackle, looks up, spots the run, treads it brilliantly between centre-half and full-back.\n39:36 Comment: He's onside.\n39:37 Comment: And luckily for Chelsea, Begovic is able to spread that big body of his and deny a wonderful opportunity for Southampton.\n39:51 Comment: Pull-up from Davies.\n39:57 Comment: Smile, a wry smile on the face of Koeman.\n40:0 Comment: That's only their second attempt. Davies missed a good chance earlier, which was off target.\n40:4 Comment: But that one was very much on.\n40:6 Comment: And I think he realises how good a moment it could have been for Southampton.\n40:27 Comment: Here's Azpilicueta.\n40:30 Comment: Ramirez.\n40:33 Comment: Ivanovic.\n40:36 Comment: Bertrand.\n40:38 Comment: Auriel Romero.\n40:42 Comment: Mane does get the free kick this time.\n40:51 Comment: And Ramirez walking a bit of a tightrope.\n40:57 Comment: There's a card this time for Ramirez.\n41:1 Comment: I think it might have been a bit of totting up here as well, you know.\n41:4 Comment: You can see he comes in.\n41:5 Comment: I don't think it's the nastiest of challenges I've ever seen.\n41:8 Comment: But he has been called up by the referee and given fouls against him on three or four occasions.\n41:15 Comment: Eventually finds his way into the book.\n41:19 Comment: He has been sent off four times already in his Chelsea career, Ramirez.\n41:22 Comment: And he's another one under pressure now.\n41:24 Comment: Pel√© with the chest down for Davies!\n41:27 Comment: What a hit!\n41:28 Comment: And Chelsea stunned so close to half-time with a goal from Steven Davies.\n41:33 Comment: A terrific strike.\n41:34 Comment: A terrific strike from Davies.\n41:36 Comment: Wonderful play from Pel√© to lay it down to him.\n41:40 Comment: And I told you Sadat were beginning to believe.\n41:42 Comment: The last ten minutes or so they were really beginning to own the ball.\n41:45 Comment: And they've made it pay.\n41:46 Comment: You see the diagonal ball.\n41:47 Comment: Defenders hate that one.\n41:49 Comment: You'll have a look.\n41:50 Comment: Cahill thinks he has him.\n41:51 Comment: He's fighting him.\n41:52 Comment: But the big man just chests it down.\n41:53 Comment: And just look at that for a calm finish.\n41:56 Comment: Great technique from Davies.\n41:58 Comment: There you go.\n41:59 Comment: Lovely lay-off to him.\n42:0 Comment: And he hits it so well.\n42:1 Comment: Begwitch can't keep it out.\n42:2 Comment: That's a terrific play from the big man.\n42:3 Comment: The centre forward knocks it down.\n42:7 Comment: Classic smash and grab moment for Southampton.\n42:11 Comment: And a great moment for Steven Davies on his 67th club appearance since his last goal against Stoke.\n42:17 Comment: The former fuller man comes back to West London.\n42:21 Comment: And strikes a real blow against Chelsea here.\n42:25 Comment: Who had been riding their luck.\n42:33 Comment: And here's Ivanovic.\n42:34 Comment: Now Ramirez under pressure.\n42:35 Comment: Could the balance be about to tilt?\n42:36 Comment: Mane goes down.\n42:37 Comment: Picked up by Tadic.\n42:38 Comment: Ivanovic recovers to make the tackle.\n42:39 Comment: And here's Davies.\n42:40 Comment: And Aspilicueta gets his body in the way.\n42:41 Comment: Well, just look at those last ten minutes.\n42:42 Comment: Chelsea defending.\n42:43 Comment: And keeping the ball at midfield at best.\n42:44 Comment: But Sadat really piling it on.\n42:45 Comment: And that's the end of the match.\n42:46 Comment: We'll be right back.\n42:57 Comment: Pella with the lay-off.\n43:6 Comment: It's beyond Davies this time and cleared by Terry.\n43:10 Comment: Ramirez.\n43:11 Comment: And suddenly Chelsea's frailties are upon us and we can see them quite clearly.\n43:20 Comment: Just giving the ball away now for fun.\n43:21 Comment: The confidence is drained.\n43:22 Comment: It's going to need something special at half-time.\n43:23 Comment: And it's going to be a good one.\n43:27 Comment: And now Mourinho needs half-time to come quicker and it will come in two minutes because\n43:34 Comment: that's the amount of stoppage time added on.\n43:42 Comment: Oscar.\n43:47 Comment: This is Ivanovic.\n43:51 Comment: Ramirez.\n43:57 Comment: Here's Azpilicueta.\n44:12 Comment: This is Hazard.\n44:25 Comment: He's done well here, Eden Hazard.\n44:40 Comment: Fabregas.\n44:41 Comment: Oscar.\n44:42 Comment: And Oscar taken down by Victor Wanyama.\n44:45 Comment: Surely has to be Willian again.\n44:46 Comment: You would think so.\n44:47 Comment: Wanyama's complaining.\n44:48 Comment: But once he doesn't get the ball there, he's always going to be a free kick.\n44:49 Comment: Oscar fainted the shoot.\n44:50 Comment: Probably not going to be a free kick.\n44:51 Comment: But he's got to be.\n44:52 Comment: He's got to be.\n44:54 Comment: Oscar fainted the shoot.\n44:55 Comment: Pulls it back inside.\n44:56 Comment: And yeah.\n44:57 Comment: I think the ref's right to give that one.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: better goals than most people.\n0:30 Comment: the back foot.\n0:35 Comment: It's all about the response now from Chelsea.\n0:37 Comment: Chelsea look at him, he's changed, he's got Matic on the field.\n0:41 Comment: He'll look for much better application, he'll want people to stay with runners and\n0:45 Comment: Matic, from that point of view, it's good to have him out there.\n0:49 Comment: But Ward-Prowse, I think that's probably\n0:52 Comment: a more imaginative or a more creative\n0:54 Comment: substitution in that he'll be looking to get forward\n0:57 Comment: as much as he can, certainly far more than the man he replaced.\n1:0 Comment: Remy was the holding player there for a long period,\n1:5 Comment: so finally balance this game.\n1:8 Comment: It's a 100th senior game for James Ward-Prowse,\n1:12 Comment: all of them for Southampton, a club he joined at the age of 8.\n1:17 Comment: Here is number 8 for Chelsea, Oscar...\n1:21 Comment: to Cesc Fabregas.\n1:30 Comment: And here's Matic.\n1:35 Comment: Ivanovic.\n1:41 Comment: The draw would not move Chelsea in the table, it would mean\n1:45 Comment: there would still be only four clubs below them\n1:48 Comment: in the Premier League.\n1:50 Comment: West Brom, Villa, Sunderland and Newcastle.\n1:54 Comment: And they would be below still all of last season's promoted clubs.\n2:0 Comment: And that would make tough reading for Chelsea fans,\n2:3 Comment: but you get the feeling this is as important\n2:6 Comment: as 45 minutes as they've had this season.\n2:13 Comment: Jose Mourinho didn't shy away from it.\n2:15 Comment: Even he's describing this as a must-win.\n2:22 Comment: Already Chelsea's worst start for 15 years.\n2:26 Comment: A run that cost Gianluca a lot of time.\n2:30 Comment: And now he's got to give this to Viali,\n2:32 Comment: his job, after five matches.\n2:36 Comment: Davies sliding this one through towards Mane,\n2:38 Comment: but the danger was read by Gary Cahill.\n2:42 Comment: Now, Eden Hazard.\n2:49 Comment: Looked to pick out Willian, but Bertrand in the way.\n2:52 Comment: Now, Tadic.\n2:54 Comment: Bertrand.\n2:57 Comment: Keller with another lay-off to Davies.\n2:59 Comment: to withdraw because he knew he would have been offside but they can find him now Mane and Begovic\n3:4 Comment: spreads himself at Mane's feet to deny Southampton a lead there but Mane still going\n3:10 Comment: and that one propelled back off Gary Cahill as Southampton crank up the pressure at the start\n3:16 Comment: of the second half this is Tadic and he's left Ivanovic for dead there can he pull it across\n3:22 Comment: Mane another block and Ward-Prowse with a shot that's wide and Chelsea all at sea all at sea it's\n3:29 Comment: sixes and sevens great play from Southampton first of all this is a later incident to her the early\n3:35 Comment: release to get the first chance in which Begovic does well Terry makes a great block there from\n3:41 Comment: Ward-Prowse missed a chance but just look at this great hold of play great layoff from the centre\n3:44 Comment: forward Mane knows he's offside but the ball in here is just exquisite right in the patch from\n3:50 Comment: Tadic to Mane and Begovic\n3:52 Comment: saves Chelsea's blushes once again\n4:3 Comment: Mane denied by Begovic and by Cahill's block and Ronald Koeman's side making their intentions plain\n4:11 Comment: Jose Mourinho must be worried about the apparent lethargy of his side they did have that European\n4:17 Comment: commitment in the week but that would count as no excuse\n4:22 Comment: I don't think so\n4:22 Comment: I don't think I've ever seen Ivanovic being turned so easily inside in his own box on the byline\n4:29 Comment: there's something not right about his game he's as strong as an ox has been for years he just\n4:33 Comment: looked weak but great spirits great ability don't get me wrong but there's something vital missing\n4:43 Comment: he is a survivor in the team Branislav Ivanovic no\n4:46 Comment: player in the

against the Spanish full-back.\n7:20 Comment: And the heat's on now.\n7:21 Comment: And it's a good start for Jose.\n7:25 Comment: I said we'd learn an awful lot about Jose\n7:28 Comment: and this team's current state of mind.\n7:31 Comment: And reinforce that.\n7:35 Comment: Desperately needs a victory here.\n7:40 Comment: Even a draw would extend it to being their worst start\n7:44 Comment:

wriggle his way through though\n10:50 Comment: as I'm looking to reintroduce that little bit of sparkle for Chelsea that's\n10:54 Comment: gone missing\n10:57 Comment: bringing the challenge out of Davis and Cedric slices it clear finds his man\n11:2 Comment: Dusan Tadic who wins the head of Capella they offer when you're just a touch too\n11:7 Comment: heavy and Matich wins it back this is Oscar Fabregas through to Falcao first\n11:15 Comment: touch heavy still got there for a second taken down was he no it's a dive and\n11:20 Comment: he's gonna get a booking well I have to say he looked second favorite to get to\n11:27 Comment: the ball as he grappled with the defender you'll see he looks to be a\n11:30 Comment: half a yard down but he pulls him and gets around and you know what I think\n11:34 Comment: he's entitled to go down there I think it's a bit harsh on the referee he gets\n11:37 Comment: his touch the goalkeeper\n11:37 Comment: comes out his boots seem to rub off the ribs of the goalkeeper you'll see he\n11:42 Comment: gets himself in behind the defender there's a touch there's contact is it\n11:47 Comment: enough for a penalty who knows the referees the only one who can decide\n11:50 Comment: that the yellow cards harsh for diving\n12:0 Comment: he certainly had a few of these calls to make in a busy afternoon the referee\n12:7 Comment: it's in the clear now this is a good moment you get to pass the goalkeeper\n12:17 Comment: his feet definitely hit the shoulder and ribs of Steppenberg well you know what\n12:25 Comment: he's thinking\n12:31 Comment: this is a good moment he gets it past the goalkeeper as Pete definitely hit the\n12:37 Comment: shoulder and ribs of Steppenburg well you know what he's thinking well you know what he's thinking\n12:37 Comment: from the first smile a sarcastic one of the night and just look at Falcao's disgust\n12:44 Comment: a not getting the penalty would be to get a yellow card for diving\n12:49 Comment: well he felt that was insult to injury\n12:56 Comment: here's Dusan Tadic\n12:57 Comment: Pella trying to work it through for Ryan Bertrands pushing the back of Willian\n13:17 Comment: well he might say it's a question of these things evening themselves out yeah he'd have a point\n13:27 Comment: furious John Terry saying come on whatever about not giving the penalty and\n13:34 Comment: Steckenberg did well to pull his hands away to make it look like an obvious foul he did\n13:38 Comment: very well Steckenberg in that instant but there was contact and I'm not so sure it\n13:42 Comment: was a penalty I'm not saying it was blatant but the yellow card is harsh\n13:57 Comment: here's Pella Fabregas Willian\n14:13 Comment: Davis\n14:16 Comment: Bertrand\n14:23 Comment: and a bit with the header back to Gary Cahill they've given away to Tadic\n14:27 Comment: and or will it be Vnai captains\n14:46 Comment: passed on this again to substitute Beck has managed to get beyond Terry

terry's come back ruined but ruined i think by a lack of confidence\n15:36 Comment: and the ability just to deal with the situations and the problems that are arising out there\n15:42 Comment: well even for someone as self-assured as jose marino he must wonder\n15:48 Comment: where to turn next the call was for john terry to come back\n15:53 Comment: he\n15:54 Comment: duly put him back in he was turned by sadio mane for the goal that's left chelsea under pressure\n16:1 Comment: here and now they really have to prove that they've got that title spirit back from last\n16:7 Comment: season

got to get it in the right way and\n16:23 Comment: you've got to get it in the right way and you've got to get it in the right way and you've got to get it in the right way\n16:24 Comment: that situation should have been dealt with long before it made its way to the edge of the box\n16:28 Comment: where he made his mistake\n16:31 Comment: yes there's a slip from cahill as well in the build-up and giving it away to do santanich\n16:41 Comment: here's virgil van dyke\n16:44 Comment: davis manet\n16:53 Comment: van dyke\n17:13 Comment: font\n17:16 Comment: now cedric\n17:23 Comment:

line brilliantly all night\n27:33 Comment: and when the pass came out to him the form he's in at the moment you almost\n27:39 Comment: knew he was gonna score him this stadium which has been eerily quiet\n27:43 Comment: put it under Southampton fans well it's in disbelief but what about this the\n27:48 Comment: substitute subbed Nemanja Matic who came on for the second half has lasted\n27:54 Comment: only until 17 minutes from the end as another throw the dice from Jose Mourinho\n27:59 Comment: sees Loic Remy thrown on to try and do what they did at Newcastle and he's got a great run\n28:3 Comment: and saves something from being two goals behind curious curious decision to take\n28:9 Comment: Matic off\n28:13 Comment: here's Pedro\n28:19 Comment: I just wonder Rob before the goal went in and Remy was looking to come on a\n28:24 Comment: wonder was it going to be Matic well it's an interesting point it could be\n28:28 Comment: that as soon as the ball landed in the back of the net Jose Mourinho changed\n28:32 Comment: the player that he wanted to score and now he's got to get it back to the pitch\n28:33 Comment: to make sure that the ball is not going to go to the net and that's what he was\n28:36 Comment: planning to bring off\n28:41 Comment: I don't think the goal was up to do it in my think I feel it you had it would\n28:43 Comment: give him one away a couple of minutes earlier it's a real sloppy pass into the\n28:47 Comment: danger area and said after sees on it\n28:51 Comment: the two strikers on the pitch that's fine\n28:57 Comment: Matic well\n29:1 Comment: Pella deserves his goal you have that massive part to play in the first goal\n29:3 Comment: for Southampton\n29:14 Comment: look at the attempts down in that corner there Southampton\n29:18 Comment: 12 attempts Chelsea six at Stamford Bridge and you know what those six were\n29:23 Comment: six at half time they haven't had one attempt at goal in the second half\n29:33 Comment: and you think how this used to be an arena of invincibility under Jose Mourinho\n29:40 Comment: until the first point shook things up and then Alan Pardew followed suit and\n29:44 Comment: now Ronald Koeman is pleased to do the same if his team can hold on for the final 15 minutes here\n29:50 Comment: it's going to take something really special now for Chelsea to get back in\n29:54 Comment: the playing void of confidence there making mistakes\n29:58 Comment: so many errors today\n30:0 Comment: OMG!\n30:2 Comment: and at Poghlan's, they probably fancied themselves to get another one.\n30:12 Comment: Davis, and Mane looking to get through the middle of the defence again.\n30:16 Comment: And Cahill is the one who's involved in the struggle with him,\n30:20 Comment: from which Mane emerges victorious.\n30:22 Comment: They cannot knock this man off the ball,\n30:24 Comment: and it's another opportunity for Tadic!\n30:27 Comment: And the block comes in and saves the day.\n30:31 Comment: And John Terry is the man who put his body on the line.\n30:34 Comment: Oh, could easily have been four, but he's won the battle so well here, Mane.\n30:38 Comment: Absolutely gets passed with ease against Cahill,\n30:40 Comment: and here he decides to fake it onto his left.\n30:42 Comment: At that point, you fear the worst, but John Terry comes to the rescue.\n30:46 Comment: Could easily have been four.\n30:48 Comment: It all started with Pedro giving the ball away again in midfield.\n30:53 Comment: I mean, he can't be disappointed with his charges.\n30:57 Comment: And it was a golden chance, but it's something I never thought I'd see here.\n31:1 Comment: It's down for Bridge under a Jose Mourinho team.\n31:2 Comment: Chelsea falling apart.\n31:6 Comment: Ward-Pras, his corner font, went for it,\n31:8 Comment: and couldn't quite apply the killer touch.\n31:15 Comment: Oscar leading the charge out and looking for Loic Remy.\n31:19 Comment: Delivers early, this time more successfully,\n31:22 Comment: although Hazard still forced wide.\n31:25 Comment: And Bertrand pursuing him.\n31:29 Comment: Oscar!\n31:31 Comment: A real waste for Chelsea from what had been a promising break.\n31:34 Comment: Well, it is. It's good play, and Oscar finds himself in a great position,\n31:37 Comment: but a lack of confidence or a lack of awareness,\n31:39 Comment: something that's just not there.\n31:41 Comment: I mean, it's a pretty hopeless idea that he had, never mind the execution.\n31:54 Comment: Well, he's bemused, isn't he?\n31:57 Comment: Well, times like this, you expect a special one.\n32:1 Comment: It was already at a close, at the last minute.\n32:2 Comment: BLANK moment,\n32:4 Comment: He wanted to have a break out of a very close chapter,\n32:6 Comment: but now it's gone into the next phase,\n32:8 Comment: so takes away someƒüin' the best of hope.\n32:11 Comment: ACC must be damm'd this season.\n32:14 Comment: Latin several months and years of personal fall now.\n32:17 Comment: You know that that's frustrating and if you haven't done so yet,\n32:20 Comment: only cooks and putters have to be mo'.\n32:26 Comment: It's only twice you've done so.\n32:27 Comment: It could be better, for obvious reasons.\n32:28 Comment: It is still so,\n32:29 Comment: but somehow,\n32:30 Comment: Valcao with the flick here's Pedro\n32:41 Comment: Fabregas Azpilicueta\n32:47 Comment: Valcao climbing but Van Dijk climbing higher\n32:52 Comment: Ivanovic\n32:55 Comment: Fabregas\n33:1 Comment: Pedro\n33:4 Comment: Azpilicueta\n33:12 Comment: cleared by James Ward-Prowse\n33:19 Comment: here's

Azpilicueta has to try to do it, but Sedrick has got months enquanto\n34:20 Comment: Well, look at him over there at the rest.\n34:23 Comment: the disappointment in his face by the way there was a caution earlier for\n34:31 Comment: James Ward-Prowse the move that ended with Oscar knocking the ball widely\n34:34 Comment: pulled back that player in the incident and for that tug on the shirt\n34:43 Comment: yellow card was shown to James Ward-Prowse\n34:53 Comment: Ivanovic\n35:15 Comment: lonely shot Jose Mourinho's bowed heads in the\n35:20 Comment: background I can't understand what's happening for\n35:23 Comment: this match.\n35:23 Comment: I think it's going to be a close game.\n35:29 Comment: He himself must be struggling to come to terms with it.\n35:34 Comment: So you don't become a bad team overnight.\n35:36 Comment: Do you become a bad team in three months.\n35:39 Comment: It's incredible the drain of confidence.\n35:45 Comment: The drain and ideas that they have possession of times that\n35:49 Comment: have fabric that's on the ball in areas but nothing doing.\n35:53 Comment: As if there are any\n36:7 Comment: others quite as things as proper.\n36:8 Comment: Only Falkel Rem√© and Stecklenburg No more Oh no Stoak vic\n36:17 Comment: Grodd clos the eyes and eyes.\n36:23 Comment: Good there you go.\n36:23 Comment: It's a nice cross, but he should deal with it better.\n36:26 Comment: He should hold on to it.\n36:28 Comment: It doesn't quite fall for Hazard.\n36:30 Comment: Stegenberg gets away with it.\n36:31 Comment: Comes back out and Pedro's well wide.\n36:38 Comment: Chelsea fans doing their best now.\n36:40 Comment: Everybody getting behind their team.\n36:41 Comment: They want them to finish strong.\n36:45 Comment: So that will just have to deal with it.\n36:47 Comment: Keep doing what they're doing.\n36:47 Comment: They've been excellent tonight.\n36:53 Comment: Played through early towards Remy, but Font had it covered.\n37:7 Comment: Koeman on the brink of a fine achievement for Southampton.\n37:16 Comment: It would be their first away win since February.\n37:21 Comment: When Sadio Mane, the winner of the Premier League,\n37:23

game to win it for two\n42:51 Comment: they had to come from behind here his Cesar Azpilicueta\n43:0 Comment: and Cedric standing strong to get either way only as far away as Oscar\n43:5 Comment: while he was aiming that one at Cesc Fabregas but as so much has gone wrong for Oscar so that one did\n43:12 Comment: too well he seems void of ideas as a lot of them do tonight I mean that ball came out to him a\n43:17 Comment: confident Oscar will probably try and put that in the top corner but just look Chelsea's 11 attempts\n43:22 Comment: to set up 13 that is not telling the story so that would have been more superior they've had\n43:27 Comment: the better chances they're five on target to Chelsea's three and they've got to get that one\n43:30 Comment: up that's more like it that tells

the other end\n44:17 Comment: clearance though falls for Cahill who's managed to pick out Cesc Fabregas Bertrand holding him up\n44:25 Comment: and it's Pedro looking for a way through and not finding a way through\n44:30 Comment: but after such an off-field run at the end\n44:32 Comment: Sara\n44:39 Comment: had a chance there to thread him in Pella just picked the wrong ball for Manchester

the crowd.\n45:20 Comment: He felt a victim in the first half\n45:21 Comment: when one of two contentious penalty appeals went against him,\n45:25 Comment: but his side kept going, Koeman's side,\n45:27 Comment: and they've had their just desserts,\n45:30 Comment: or they're close to their just desserts.\n45:37 Comment: And Sadio Mane is going to be taken off at this late stage.\n45:45 Comment: Maia Yoshida coming on in a clear defensive move.\n45:48 Comment: Yeah, he's been terrific, Mane,\n45:49 Comment: a real pawn in the side of the Chelsea players.\n45:52 Comment: Terrific

    "summary": "Chelsea faced Southampton in a Premier League battle that ended in a stunning 3-1 defeat for the reigning champions. The game, filled with drama, tactical maneuvers, and moments of individual brilliance, was a display of everything football can offer, from explosive attacking moves to controversial decisions by the referee.\n\n**First Half:**\n\nFrom the kickoff, the tension was palpable as Chelsea, the title-holders, had experienced a rocky start to the season, losing five out of their eleven matches. The spectators were eagerly anticipating a much-needed resurgence. The first few minutes saw Chelsea maintaining possession, probing at Southampton's organized defensive setup. Cesar Azpilicueta sent an early cross into the box which was headed clear by Jose Fonte, and Victor Wanyama's attempted clearance only made it to Ramirez, whose long pass aimed for Radamel Falcao was effortlessly shielded out by Cedric Soares. \n\nSouthampton, setting up with a cautious midfield arrangement featuring Victor Wanyama and Oriol Romeu, indicated a defensive mindset. Romeu, who had an unfortunate history of injuries at Chelsea, now lined up against his former club, perhaps with a point to prove. \n\nChelsea's Eder Hazard, who had not yet reached the heights of his previous season‚Äôs performances, tried to influence the game. The first real threat came in the 6th minute when Willian's slick pass found Oscar, whose attempt fizzled out without troubling the defense. Chelsea‚Äôs defense was marshaled by John Terry, who was looking to redeem a backline that had recently shown vulnerability, particularly on set-pieces.\n\nOn the other side, Southampton wasn't just defending; they looked to exploit any mistakes. Graziano Pelle, Sadio Mane, and Dusan Tadic formed a potent attacking trio. Mane, who had scored against Chelsea in the previous season, was especially lively. \n\nEden Hazard executed a fine dribble through midfield in the 8th minute, but Oriol Romeu brought him down, earning the first yellow card of the match for an untidy challenge. This gave Chelsea an early free-kick, and fans' excitement reached a fever pitch when Willian stepped up. The Brazilian, who had scored from free-kicks in three consecutive games, delivered again with a stunning strike that deceived Stekelenburg, finding the back of the net to give Chelsea a 1-0 lead.\n\nChelsea's spirits were lifted, but Southampton quickly settled and began building their rhythm. On the 12th minute, Steven Davis sent in a wicked delivery from a free-kick, causing confusion in Chelsea's box, but Virgil van Dijk's attempt was blocked. This indicated an oncoming wave of Southampton pressure.\n\nSouthampton began turning up the heat. In the 14th minute, Dusan Tadic swung a corner into the box causing a heart-stopping moment for Chelsea as Fons moved unmarked towards it but failed to connect. Southampton‚Äôs increasing aggression was met with stout Chelsea defense headed by Terry and Cahill under the watchful eye of keeper Azmir Begovic who had been reliable for them in Courtois' absence.\n\nBy the 21st minute, Chelsea‚Äôs midfield started losing its grip. Fabregas, while brilliant on the ball, often floundered defensively, letting Davis and Wanyama control the tempo. Then, in the 27th minute, Sadio Mane, in a brilliant individual effort, played Ryan Bertrand through, but Fabregas, having registered his name in the book for stopping a dangerous break, thwarted the danger with a crucial tackle.\n\nSouthampton‚Äôs persistence finally paid off at the stroke of half-time. In the 40th minute, Pell√®, after outmuscling Cahill, chested down a precise ball and smartly laid it off to Davis. The Northern Irish midfielder struck it beautifully, beating Begovic at his near post to level the score 1-1, a superb execution that reinvigorated Southampton's hopes heading into the break.\n\n**Second Half:**\n\nMourinho recognized the need for greater stability in midfield and brought on Nemanja Matic for the second half. Yet, it was Southampton who started brighter. In the 47th minute, Mane almost doubled his tally when Bertrand‚Äôs cross was initially saved by Begovic who thereafter blocked Ward-Prowse‚Äôs attempt ensuring Chelsea stayed level.\n\nSouthampton was relentless with Mane and Tadic orchestrating attacks that left Ivanovic and Terry struggling. In an incident-packed 56th minute, Southampton sprung a counter where Mane earned himself a penalty appeal after Cahill's misjudgment. However, Mane was booked for simulation. A similar situation minutes later when Falcao found himself one-on-one with Martin Stekelenburg, his fall was interpreted as a dive, earning him a booking and incensing the home fans.\n\nSouthampton‚Äôs efforts bore fruit in the 60th minute when a lapse in Chelsea‚Äôs defense saw Pell√® effortlessly hold off Terry to release Mane, who slotted the ball under Begovic, putting Southampton 2-1 up. The visiting fans erupted while Stamford Bridge fell silent.\n\nMourinho responded by introducing Loic Remy for Matic, an attacking move signaling Chelsea's desperation. However, this left Chelsea vulnerable at the back, further capitalized by Southampton in the 69th minute. Azpi closed Mane down but a one-two with Davis allowed the striker to go past him and deliver a cross to Pell√®, who made no mistake from close range, sealing a deserved 3-1 scoreline.\n\nThe last 20 minutes saw Chelsea throw everything forward, but Southampton‚Äôs defense remained resolute. Fonte and Van Dijk were superb, clearing crosses and blocking shots, leaving Falcao and Remy frustrated. A final free-kick in the 84th minute saw Falcao‚Äôs effort glancing off Bertrand‚Äôs head, missing by inches, a microcosm of Chelsea's tale of missed opportunities and bad luck.\n\nIn the dying moments, Yoshida replaced the tireless Mane, another defensive reinforcement that ensured Southampton saw out the game comfortably. Despite the hurried attempts by Chelsea's attackers, the match ended in chaos for the home side, who were subjected to boos from their own fans.\n\nThis result underscored the burgeoning crisis at Chelsea, while Southampton reveled in a well-earned victory. The win marked their first away triumph since February and symbolized a night of tactical masterclass from Ronald Koeman, with his team executing the game plan to perfection. Southampton showcased resolve, character, and clinical finishing, qualities Chelsea glaringly lacked in their troubled campaign to retain the Premier League crown."
