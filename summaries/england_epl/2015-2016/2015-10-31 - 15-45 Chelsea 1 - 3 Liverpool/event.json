Their efforts resulted in several shots on target, but Liverpool’s defense, buoyed by their lead, stood firm. The final minutes saw end-to-end action with both teams continuing to showcase their attacking prowess. Liverpool managed clock control expertly, with cleared balls and defensive lines effectively neutralizing Chelsea's offensive sorties.\n\nThe game's high-octane conclusion was marked by another round of fouls and free-kicks as both sides displayed commendable tenacity.
