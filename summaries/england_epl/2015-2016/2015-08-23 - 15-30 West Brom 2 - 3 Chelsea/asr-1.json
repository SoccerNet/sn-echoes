It doesn't matter if he's perhaps looks a little bit isolated at times.\n1:4 Comment: If they are defending they know they have an out ball with him.\n1:8 Comment: Yes, Fabregas who was sent off here in rather silly circumstances back in May.\n1:13 Comment: During a break in play he booted the ball towards a pack of players and hit Chris Brunt.\n1:26 Comment: Hazard.\n1:28 Comment: Diego Costa.\n1:39 Comment: Kurt Schubert's header. He's in for Gary Cahill.\n1:41 Comment: And you have a bit of insight into Cahill's...\n1:43 Comment: Yes, just been speaking with him at the Chelsea camp and they said that Gary's been working all week\n1:49 Comment: with a protective mask on.\n1:51 Comment: Asmir Begovic caught him in the face at Manchester City and actually broke his nose\n1:55 Comment: and gave him a gash on the cheekbone.\n1:57 Comment: So it's not been a comfortable week's work for him.\n1:59 Comment: So in some ways I'm sure that would have had a bearing on the Zouma decision as well.\n2:3 Comment: We all expected or we were all sort of coming to the ground today\n2:7 Comment: wondering what was going to be happening with John Terry.\n2:9 Comment: But I think that one may just have made the manager's mind up a little bit more.\n2:13 Comment: Hazard.\n2:18 Comment: Costa down on the floor for the first time, not for the last.\n2:21 Comment: Here's Fabregas.\n2:24 Comment: Hazard. Costa's picked himself back up.\n2:30 Comment: Ivanovic.\n2:34 Comment: And a break for Jakob.\n2:42 Comment: Chelsea need more tempo in their games, John.\n2:44 Comment: I have watched them against Swansea, obviously against City.\n2:48 Comment: They've been too slow.\n2:49 Comment: Players having too many touches on the ball.\n2:52 Comment: And then your best players don't have the room to operate.\n2:55 Comment: They've got the quality, they can play one touch.\n2:58 Comment: We know that.\n2:59 Comment: I think we need to see a little bit more of that from them today.\n3:5 Comment: Zouma was a little late on Morrison there.\n3:10 Comment: Morrison has stayed down.\n3:11 Comment: McManaman to Jakob.\n3:16 Comment: Dawson.\n3:19 Comment: And Rondon.\n3:20 Comment: And Rondon nearly had a second bite at it.\n3:25 Comment: Good start from West Bromwich Albert.\n3:27 Comment: Absolutely the right way.\n3:28 Comment: It's not working.\n3:29 Comment: Chelsea in those wide areas.\n3:30 Comment: Get that ball in the box.\n3:32 Comment: Just need the numbers in there.\n3:33 Comment: I think it was James McLean, very unlucky,\n3:36 Comment: but he couldn't supply the finishing touch there.\n3:38 Comment: Interesting to see if Mark Clattenburg goes back and talks to Zouma\n3:41 Comment: after a late challenge that has left Morrison limping.\n3:44 Comment: Hasn't yet been a break in play.\n3:47 Comment: Pedro to Fabregas.\n3:51 Comment: Now Willian.\n3:54 Comment: Fabregas once more.\n3:57 Comment: Hazard.\n3:59 Comment: Diego Costa.\n4:1 Comment: Costa with a chance.\n4:4 Comment: Big chance.\n4:5 Comment: Big chance from Diego Costa.\n4:8 Comment: Did well actually to resist that challenge this time.\n4:10 Comment: He's happy there.\n4:11 Comment: He knows exactly where McCauley is.\n4:12 Comment: He can field him and he enrolls him.\n4:14 Comment: He just takes another touch.\n4:15 Comment: Having got that yard, that's a poor finish.\n4:18 Comment: This was the one earlier when Dawson steps inside.\n4:20 Comment: Asperly-Quetta fires it.\n4:21 Comment: And look at McLean on the far side.\n4:23 Comment: Just nips in beyond Ivanovic.\n4:26 Comment: The goalkeeper has to be smart to get something on it.\n4:30 Comment: Already.\n4:31 Comment: So now being in those areas, in that wide positions,\n4:34 Comment: just getting half a yard, getting the ball in the box,\n4:37 Comment: and then you've got to ask people to get on the end of it.\n4:45 Comment: The West Brom players.\n4:48 Comment: Led by Chris Brunt, who's one of the most experienced men.\n4:52 Comment: In words with Mark Clattenburg.\n4:55 Comment: He's made it clear to Zuma that he saw what happened.\n4:58 Comment: That was it.\n4:59 Comment: Yeah, it's a nasty one.\n5:2 Comment: Thankfully, James Morrison's up and moving about a little bit better now.\n5:8 Comment: You get that, John?\n5:9 Comment: It's a fast surface.\n5:10 Comment: It's a rain that's teeming down.\n5:13 Comment: Players commit to challenges, can't always get them right.\n5:19 Comment: The voice of Andy Townsend, who played for both these clubs, of course.\n5:32 Comment: Fabregas.\n5:36 Comment: Willian.\n5:40 Comment: Diego Costa.\n5:43 Comment: Pedro.\n5:49 Comment: As for the Quetta.\n5:54 Comment: Now Fabregas.\n6:2 Comment: Patient from Chelsea, a little pedestrian.\n6:12 Comment: Here's Branislav Ivanovic, one of the six players named by\n6:15 Comment: Mourinho this week as having been disappointing.\n6:23 Comment: He's been good at the entire back four.\n6:30 Comment: He then went on to say that he too had been disappointing Mourinho,\n6:32 Comment: and that he would be going to the gym rather more to make up for it.\n6:36 Comment: Quite sure of the relevance of Mourinho going to the gym.\n6:38 Comment: Fabregas.\n6:47 Comment: Matic.\n7:9 Comment: Now with McAuley.\n7:11 Comment: Back to Barzmajil, who continues to deputise for Ben Foster.\n7:28 Comment: Mourinho, in public at least, is a fairly brooding presence at the moment.\n7:31 Comment: Yeah, he is, yeah.\n7:32 Comment: I think he knows his team are 25% short of what they're capable of.\n7:37 Comment: He's having a little look at Willian at the moment.\n7:39 Comment: He's not happy with just a little simple touch layoff that he gave a few moments ago\n7:44 Comment: that was just a little bit casual.\n7:46 Comment: Not quite there.\n7:48 Comment: That's why we're seeing and hearing a lot of what he says.\n7:50 Comment: He's all born out of frustration.\n7:51 Comment: Knows what his players are capable of and they haven't delivered.\n7:53 Comment: But, you know, he has utilised pretty much the same bunch of players now\n7:58 Comment: for a fair while, Jose Mourinho.\n8:1 Comment: Lots of managers.\n8:4 Comment: You see him rotating, changing.\n8:5 Comment: Chopra moving players around.\n8:8 Comment: He's reluctant to do that.\n8:10 Comment: They just look a little bit flat.\n8:11 Comment: They have done up to now.\n8:13 Comment: Started okay here.\n8:14 Comment: Room for improvement.\n8:22 Comment: Fletcher.\n8:23 Comment: Terry.\n8:36 Comment: Just see with the extra man in the middle of the park, I think,\n8:38 Comment: for West Bombardier when it does help\n8:40 Comment: when they've got Jakob who can sit in front of Olsen and McCauley.\n8:45 Comment: Look for Azar, Pedro and Willian if they're running in off the line, etc.\n8:48 Comment: It's important that West Bombardier have a presence there.\n8:51 Comment: But also important that Rondon has someone to get up and get up alongside him.\n8:55 Comment: Make the numbers up when they get wide and deliver it into the box.\n8:58 Comment: That's the way it's done.\n9:0 Comment: Diego Costa for Willian.\n9:4 Comment: And an Azar.\n9:11 Comment: And a goal.\n9:29 Comment: Matich.\n9:37 Comment: West Brom as one would expect from a few of this team.\n9:39 Comment: Well drilled.\n9:45 Comment: Matich.\n10:0 Comment: Azar.\n10:2 Comment: Skipping away from Jakob.\n10:7 Comment: Diego Costa didn't get the chance.\n10:9 Comment: Chris Brunt saw to that.\n10:11 Comment: Great run, Aidan Azar.\n10:12 Comment: Brilliant spin and immediately drove into a gap.\n10:19 Comment: Tony Peel is taking issue with that decision.\n10:22 Comment: Him sprinting out of his technical area.\n10:30 Comment: I think there we saw that passage of play, John, where Albion were very much at a solid shape.\n10:36 Comment: And Chelsea were just trying to probe and find the right moment.\n10:40 Comment: The right pass.\n10:42 Comment: And that's what West Brom, Albion and Tony Peel's teams do.\n10:44 Comment: They don't sell themselves diving into silly challenges.\n10:47 Comment: If you do that against the best players, your team will very quickly lose its shape and you get pulled apart.\n10:52 Comment: So you'll see plenty of that where players are standing up, showing people how to play.\n10:56 Comment: You'll see plenty of that where players are standing up, showing people infield, showing them into traffic.\n11:1 Comment: Just making life difficult.\n11:16 Comment: Jonas Olsen.\n11:19 Comment: Morrison.\n11:21 Comment: Rondon. Flags up.\n11:23 Comment: Even had he got it on target, it wouldn't have counted.\n11:26 Comment: I like that though.\n11:27 Comment: Really clever ball that initially from Olsen into Morrison who just peeled off it.\n11:31 Comment: Just in behind Matic, that outstretched leg.\n11:33 Comment: He can't stop the ball and then Rondon's on his way.\n11:35 Comment: But he's just a little bit too eager.\n11:39 Comment: It's good play that is though.\n11:41 Comment: It's good football. It's the right idea.\n11:44 Comment: That's the sort of movement that Rondon will give this team.\n11:47 Comment: He's always looking for anything over the top and he is a good finisher.\n11:51 Comment: He does have a track record in that respect.\n11:53 Comment: He'll be a little bit disappointed that even though the flag was up, he didn't actually make a little bit more of the shot.\n11:59 Comment: Well when Tony Pulas spends Â£12 million here, the money that he spends, it has to be a hit.\n12:6 Comment: It's got to be right. It's got to be right. Absolutely.\n12:14 Comment: Morrison.\n12:16 Comment: Pulas.\n12:17 Comment: Very upset at the shenanigans during the last few days of the transfer window.\n12:23 Comment: McManaman.\n12:25 Comment: McManaman goes over.\n12:27 Comment: Matip gets his penalty.\n12:31 Comment: Chelsea concede a penalty.\n12:33 Comment: Matic downcast as the rain pours.\n12:37 Comment: And Mourinho with a little shake of the head.\n12:40 Comment: Looked like it was a bad decision didn't it?\n12:42 Comment: From the player I mean, not the referee.\n12:44 Comment: I think the referee gets it absolutely spot on.\n12:46 Comment: McManaman's ducking back.\n12:48 Comment: He's going away from goal.\n12:49 Comment: Stay on your feet.\n12:51 Comment: You've got two on one there as Piliqueta and Matic.\n12:53 Comment: You don't need to commit to that challenge right there.\n12:56 Comment: We see him make many good interceptions but that was a poor decision.\n13:0 Comment: Advantage West Bromwich Albion here.\n13:2 Comment: Chance for James Morrison.\n13:5 Comment: Saved by Couture.\n13:7 Comment: With the trailing leg.\n13:14 Comment: It's a poor penalty.\n13:15 Comment: I've got to say.\n13:17 Comment: That is a poor penalty.\n13:19 Comment: I've never been a favour in that one.\n13:21 Comment: Where people come up and just smash one down the middle.\n13:24 Comment: Courtois is a big man.\n13:25 Comment: When they dive the legs are always liable to get something on it.\n13:28 Comment: Pick a spot.\n13:29 Comment: Be brave enough to go for the corner.\n13:36 Comment: West Brom try to clear their heads.\n13:39 Comment: An infringement spotted by Mark Clattenburg.\n13:43 Comment: It's going to be a free kick for Chelsea to clear their line.\n13:45 Comment: So Morrison.\n13:46 Comment: Well he took the responsibility.\n13:48 Comment: Ordinarily Berrugino would have had a shout.\n13:50 Comment: Or had Ricky Lambert missed a 100% at Southampton started.\n13:53 Comment: He would surely have taken it.\n13:55 Comment: Exactly right.\n13:56 Comment: I'm just surprised James Morrison.\n13:57 Comment: This is a clever footballer.\n13:58 Comment: This is the decision again.\n14:0 Comment: It's a bad challenge that.\n14:1 Comment: It's a silly challenge in the box.\n14:4 Comment: Really is.\n14:5 Comment: As Piliqueta has passed him on.\n14:6 Comment: He said go on.\n14:7 Comment: You just keep driving him back.\n14:8 Comment: But that's a poor penalty.\n14:9 Comment: I think James Morrison is better than that.\n14:11 Comment: He can step up and drill one into the corner.\n14:16 Comment: This young man has come to Matiches and his team's rescue there.\n14:20 Comment: It would have been just the start that the Albion wanted.\n14:29 Comment: So still West Brom.\n14:31 Comment: The only Barclays Premier League team this season yet to score.\n14:42 Comment: Pedro.\n14:45 Comment: Diego Costa.\n14:54 Comment: As Piliqueta.\n14:59 Comment: Pedro went down. No foul.\n15:1 Comment: Chelsea have the ball anyway.\n15:4 Comment: Pedro with no one to cross to at the moment.\n15:7 Comment: As Piliqueta.\n15:8 Comment: Fabregas.\n15:13 Comment: Referee against this playoff.\n15:26 Comment: Matich.\n15:30 Comment: Already there's some activity down on the Chelsea bench below us.\n15:33 Comment: Just seeing.\n15:34 Comment: Jose Mourinho turn around to Falcao and say get warmed up.\n15:58 Comment: Mourinho has never been afraid of a substitution earlier in the game.\n16:2 Comment: That's Matich again on McManaman.\n16:3 Comment: The last one cost a penalty.\n16:4 Comment: This one will cost a yellow card.\n16:5 Comment: Yeah.\n16:6 Comment: Quite right.\n16:9 Comment: Good feet, Calum McManaman.\n16:10 Comment: He dabs the ball and he invites a challenge.\n16:12 Comment: Look.\n16:14 Comment: Again, Matich.\n16:17 Comment: Diving in unnecessarily.\n16:18 Comment: Conceding cheap free kicks against the team that have a lot of big,\n16:21 Comment: powerful centre halves that are going to put it in your box.\n16:25 Comment: Those two centre backs are McCauley and Olsen.\n16:27 Comment: And they're both adjacent to the penalty spots.\n16:30 Comment: As Hazard leans into McManaman.\n16:33 Comment: It's another free kick.\n16:34 Comment: And this one will come in from a far better angle.\n16:37 Comment: It's exactly the right sort of area now where you get the right\n16:40 Comment: trajectory, the right pace on this.\n16:43 Comment: At the moment, Calum McManaman is the only one to be able to\n16:45 Comment: get a free kick.\n16:46 Comment: And he's got a chance to do it.\n16:48 Comment: He's got a chance to get a free kick.\n16:53 Comment: At the moment, Calum McManaman is proving a difficult customer.\n16:56 Comment: Every time he gets the ball, he's positive.\n16:58 Comment: He wants to run at somebody.\n16:59 Comment: He wants to take people on.\n17:5 Comment: West Brom have had the disappointment of the penalty\n17:7 Comment: failure, but they are making the running here.\n17:12 Comment: Five waiting.\n17:13 Comment: Morrison's delivery.\n17:15 Comment: Oh, and it was a good delivery too.\n17:17 Comment: And the leap was by Craig Dawson.\n17:19 Comment: Yeah.\n17:20 Comment: Just couldn't get over it.\n17:21 Comment: It was a good ball in.\n17:23 Comment: It's a good leap.\n17:24 Comment: Good run and leap.\n17:25 Comment: But just can't quite get over the top of that.\n17:27 Comment: He's always beating John Terry, but Dawson just can't keep it down.\n17:33 Comment: Chelsea at the moment, John, looking like they're just\n17:36 Comment: struggling in terms of playing under pressure a little bit.\n17:39 Comment: Questions being asked.\n17:40 Comment: We've spoke about that.\n17:43 Comment: At the moment, they're hanging in there.\n17:44 Comment: They had the one little opportunity with Diego Costa.\n17:47 Comment: And I think he should have hit the target.\n17:48 Comment: That aside, they've had very little.\n17:52 Comment: Falcao continues to warm up out of your picture down below our\n17:56 Comment: commentary position.\n17:57 Comment: In fact, he's just had a word with the kit man.\n17:59 Comment: So he wants to change his boots.\n18:3 Comment: It's the rain, Andy.\n18:4 Comment: Soft going.\n18:15 Comment: Matich.\n18:22 Comment: That's Pellegretta for a strangely hesitant Chelsea.\n18:48 Comment: Had that penalty gone in?\n18:50 Comment: I know it's all ifs, buts and maybes.\n18:53 Comment: Then Chelsea would now be bottom of the Barclays Premier League.\n18:59 Comment: I know the table means nothing, but in a sense, it's symbolic of\n19:2 Comment: their opening to the season.\n19:3 Comment: Oh, it is.\n19:14 Comment: Olsen.\n19:15 Comment: Fabregas.\n19:21 Comment: It's Pedro.\n19:24 Comment: Has it back from Fabregas?\n19:26 Comment: No, it's Hazard.\n19:27 Comment: And it's Pedro.\n19:28 Comment: And it's danger!\n19:30 Comment: And it's the lead for Chelsea.\n19:34 Comment: Pedro on his debut.\n19:40 Comment: And it's taken less than 20 minutes.\n19:47 Comment: Great run.\n19:48 Comment: It looked like there was a deflection.\n19:49 Comment: It seemed to go past Boaz Mahil a little bit too easy for me.\n19:52 Comment: Look, lots of shirts back behind the ball.\n19:54 Comment: This time, the more committed little give and go with Aiden Hazard.\n19:58 Comment: And there's a deflection off of Jonas Olsen.\n20:0 Comment: Looks like it just catches him on the inside of his leg.\n20:2 Comment: And it just drifts in that post just inside.\n20:6 Comment: Boaz Mahil can't get to it.\n20:7 Comment: It's a good positive run.\n20:11 Comment: There's two players out there in Chelsea shirts today that are going to create something.\n20:16 Comment: And Pedro and Hazard are those two players.\n20:17 Comment: Involved heavily there.\n20:19 Comment: He'll be delighted with that.\n20:21 Comment: And his manager will be breathing a lot easier.\n20:23 Comment: Because they haven't started yet.\n20:26 Comment: It's not necessarily a scoreline that reflects the play that we've seen.\n20:29 Comment: But 99 goals for Barcelona.\n20:31 Comment: Now goal number one for Chelsea.\n20:39 Comment: Last goal for Barca was the decider in that nine-goal European Super Cup\n20:43 Comment: against Sevilla a couple of weeks ago.\n20:49 Comment: And the chant, predictably, from the Chelsea fans...\n20:52 Comment: Are you watching Manchester?\n21:0 Comment: Olsen.\n21:1 Comment: Sold it horribly short.\n21:3 Comment: Pedro.\n21:5 Comment: Up with him.\n21:6 Comment: Diego Costa.\n21:8 Comment: Taken from him by Dawson.\n21:12 Comment: That's where they have to be very careful.\n21:13 Comment: Those sort of passes there that Olsen is the first to salute, push front and apologise.\n21:20 Comment: If you let this guy pick the ball up there and have 20, 30 yards to run into,\n21:24 Comment: then Tony Piggis and his team are going to be in trouble.\n21:26 Comment: What they can't afford to do, they've no need to beat themselves up,\n21:28 Comment: they've won down, but they're playing okay.\n21:30 Comment: They cannot afford to concede another.\n21:34 Comment: That'll be a corner.\n21:49 Comment: That's McLean with an attempted clearance.\n21:55 Comment: Pulls in from Wigan, over the summer.\n22:8 Comment: Slightly deeper this time, but not deep enough.\n22:13 Comment: That's a goal.\n22:14 Comment: Slightly deeper this time, but not deep enough.\n22:20 Comment: Fabregas.\n22:35 Comment: Again there, just recognising exactly what sort of service Rondon wants.\n22:39 Comment: He's running John Terry into the gully, looking for something maybe down the line.\n22:44 Comment: Ball pinged into him to try and just take it on his chest and hold it up.\n22:55 Comment: Back up on the far side.\n23:9 Comment: He's just grabbed the ball there, James Morris.\n23:11 Comment: It looks like that's a little bit of a discussion with regards to actually\n23:15 Comment: who should be taking the penalty.\n23:17 Comment: It seems to sort of brush James McLean away and say,\n23:19 Comment: look, I'm going to do it.\n23:21 Comment: So whether or not somebody else was designated to actually take the penalty,\n23:25 Comment: we'll find out afterwards.\n23:27 Comment: Either way, it was a poor strike and it's had a big effect on the game.\n23:31 Comment: It's a big impact on the game.\n23:35 Comment: Either way, it was a poor strike and it's had a big effect on the game.\n23:38 Comment: Because Osprey and Jalbin had their tails up if they'd have gone into the lead at that point.\n23:45 Comment: Chelsea would have been suffering even more, as it is.\n23:48 Comment: Chelsea weathered that little moment and got themselves in front.\n24:5 Comment: PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PEDRO PED\n24:35 Comment: Here this is, one of only three Premier League managers to have beaten Mourinho's team more than once.\n24:50 Comment: Marc Hughes and Arsene Wenger, well, Arsene Wenger would love to be in that list, but Marc Hughes and Alan Tardieu are the two that share that distinction.\n25:35 Comment: Here's Mairi.\n25:47 Comment: Here's Hazard.\n25:51 Comment: Intercepted by Morrison.\n25:53 Comment: Rondon.\n26:1 Comment: Fletcher's pass, charged down by Hazard.\n26:3 Comment: Diego Costa.\n26:5 Comment: Eden Hazard, and a corner.\n26:7 Comment: Might have been worse for the Baggies.\n26:9 Comment: Yeah, they've got careless with their passing actually,\n26:11 Comment: last ten minutes, West Bromwich Albion.\n26:13 Comment: That's another really poor one, poor decision from Darren Fletcher.\n26:16 Comment: You cannot risk the ball, can't give it away there.\n26:18 Comment: They're lucky in the end that Hazard just takes a little bit too much time\n26:22 Comment: and the angle's too acute.\n26:24 Comment: The cross gets stopped.\n26:28 Comment: Corner just beyond John Terry, headed out by Olsen.\n26:33 Comment: Fabregas.\n26:35 Comment: Oh, nasty collision.\n26:37 Comment: One enjoyed by the home supporters.\n26:41 Comment: It's involved Diego Costa and Emmanuil Matic.\n27:0 Comment: Still seeking his first goal of the season.\n27:4 Comment: Chelsea fans seem to have found their collective voice again today.\n27:10 Comment: Stunned into near silence at the Etihad a week ago.\n27:16 Comment: Taunting the West Brom fans by saying they're the champions of England,\n27:20 Comment: you'll never be able to say that.\n27:23 Comment: And the fans are still in the stands.\n27:28 Comment: The fans are still in the stands.\n27:29 Comment: Saying they're the champions of England, you'll never be able to say that.\n27:33 Comment: It's Hazard.\n27:39 Comment: A lot of the Chelsea attacks, a lot of the moments they've had\n27:43 Comment: just all been because of poor decisions.\n27:46 Comment: West Bromwich Albion again there, Dawson taking too much time.\n27:51 Comment: Terry.\n27:53 Comment: Jakob.\n27:55 Comment: Fairness to West Bromwich, should point out that they have won the English title,\n27:58 Comment: albeit 95 years ago.\n28:6 Comment: Fletcher.\n28:8 Comment: McManaman.\n28:12 Comment: Oh, he did well to get across in from that.\n28:15 Comment: Turns a corner.\n28:17 Comment: I'd get the ball out to this kid as often as I could\n28:20 Comment: if I was in the middle of the park for the home team today.\n28:22 Comment: Because he looks like he wants to drive at people with a real pace\n28:25 Comment: and a real intensity about what he's doing.\n28:28 Comment: One or two others taking too many touches,\n28:30 Comment: this kid just wants to immediately eat up the ground in front of him\n28:33 Comment: and commit people.\n28:34 Comment: That's what you need.\n28:36 Comment: He's been given an opportunity today,\n28:37 Comment: probably hasn't played as much as he'd like, Calum McManaman.\n28:41 Comment: He does look out of sorts in this sort of company.\n28:45 Comment: So far he's given Azpilicueta plenty to consider.\n28:49 Comment: No team scored more set-piece goals than West Brom last season.\n28:53 Comment: No team scored more headers.\n28:55 Comment: It's Brunt's kick.\n28:56 Comment: Rondon was closing in.\n29:0 Comment: Great ball, great ball.\n29:2 Comment: Willian.\n29:4 Comment: Azpilicueta who found him.\n29:6 Comment: Pedro.\n29:8 Comment: Chelsea in again.\n29:10 Comment: And turned in.\n29:12 Comment: He's off the mark for the season, Diego Costa.\n29:15 Comment: Later than he might have expected.\n29:19 Comment: He gives thanks.\n29:21 Comment: As the rain teams from the skies.\n29:24 Comment: And Chelsea have found their goal touch again.\n29:26 Comment: Do you know, John, that's the first time this season I've seen them\n29:28 Comment: when they've had an opportunity,\n29:30 Comment: they're really committing people forward as quick as they can,\n29:33 Comment: as fast as they can.\n29:35 Comment: Costa is onside as Pedro strikes that shot.\n29:39 Comment: That's more like it.\n29:40 Comment: That's much better tempo from Chelsea,\n29:41 Comment: more intent to get people forward.\n29:44 Comment: One touch passing.\n29:45 Comment: On the edge of their own 18-yard box,\n29:47 Comment: within two or three passes,\n29:48 Comment: they're in the opposing 18-yard box.\n29:51 Comment: And Diego Costa supplies the finishing touch.\n29:54 Comment: You know, even in the early moments in this game,\n29:56 Comment: when they've had a chance to counter,\n29:57 Comment: they've allowed West Brom to recover.\n29:59 Comment: There, there was no opportunity for the home team\n30:1 Comment: to get back and ever get a set\n30:3 Comment: and get ready to defend much better.\n30:7 Comment: Welcome back, Chelsea.\n30:8 Comment: Yeah.\n30:9 Comment: At least the Chelsea that we were so familiar with\n30:12 Comment: for much of last season.\n30:16 Comment: Remember, they could well have been a goal down here,\n30:18 Comment: having conceded a penalty in the 12th minute.\n30:20 Comment: Saved by Couture from Morrison.\n30:26 Comment: Tony Pires now sits down.\n30:28 Comment: He spent most of the first half hour standing,\n30:30 Comment: barking the orders.\n30:31 Comment: I think he knows, John.\n30:32 Comment: I think that expression is one that...\n30:34 Comment: Of course he's disappointed, but he knows.\n30:36 Comment: You get a chance against the best teams,\n30:38 Comment: like that penalty, you've got to take it.\n30:39 Comment: You've got to get it.\n30:40 Comment: It's got to go in.\n30:42 Comment: Haven't done a lot wrong, honestly, the home team.\n30:45 Comment: But just since that penalty was missed,\n30:48 Comment: they had a ten-minute spell where their passing\n30:50 Comment: got a little bit sloppy.\n30:52 Comment: They've conceded possession\n30:54 Comment: and his team have just gradually recovered.\n30:57 Comment: Realised that they've got away with something\n30:59 Comment: and then they've kicked on.\n31:2 Comment: West Brom must now be regretting Morrison's penalty failure.\n31:6 Comment: Willian.\n31:8 Comment: Chelsea tied, sweeping forward.\n31:11 Comment: Oh, yeah!\n31:16 Comment: Now the Albion have to be careful,\n31:18 Comment: that it really doesn't get away from them.\n31:22 Comment: What they can't do is recover a two-goal lead in five minutes.\n31:25 Comment: They've got to make sure\n31:27 Comment: that they stay nice and solid up to half-time\n31:29 Comment: and have a rethink, regroup.\n31:41 Comment: CHANTING\n32:0 Comment: The noise around this ground has something of a Cockney twang to it.\n32:3 Comment: There's no reason for West Brom fans to sing.\n32:12 Comment: He's not a happy bunny, Mourinho.\n32:15 Comment: Even now, it's the referee that's drawn his eye this time.\n32:23 Comment: Standing there, his side leading 2-0,\n32:25 Comment: but with a face like thunder.\n32:27 Comment: I'm not so sure, again, if that was aimed more at Ivanovic,\n32:30 Comment: who put the ball out, trying to referee the game.\n32:33 Comment: Get on with the game.\n32:35 Comment: Ivanovic is saying he puts the ball out, but why?\n32:37 Comment: Nothing wrong with Pedro, he's OK.\n32:39 Comment: He's bounced straight back up on his feet.\n32:41 Comment: He had the ball at his feet, keep it.\n32:54 Comment: You see that a lot with Chelsea players.\n32:57 Comment: There's lots that do it, but they're almost trying to ref the game.\n33:0 Comment: Costa hits the floor and he's immediately looking at the referee.\n33:3 Comment: Get on with it.\n33:5 Comment: I think they might get it from the manager.\n33:7 Comment: I don't think they should.\n33:37 Comment: Well played.\n33:44 Comment: Gives it up for Morrison.\n33:46 Comment: He comes and wins it back.\n33:48 Comment: Well done.\n33:51 Comment: Matic, Azpilicueta.\n33:56 Comment: Something rather more artful about Chelsea now.\n33:59 Comment: Oh, no.\n34:6 Comment: Stumble by Zouma.\n34:9 Comment: Rondon is lacking company.\n34:12 Comment: Morrison.\n34:14 Comment: Chelsea have regrouped.\n34:18 Comment: Chris Brunt.\n34:22 Comment: James McLean.\n34:24 Comment: And then Chelsea give it straight back to West Brom and Jakob.\n34:37 Comment: Olsen.\n34:45 Comment: McLean.\n34:48 Comment: Rondon.\n34:50 Comment: And Morrison!\n34:55 Comment: That's more like it.\n35:2 Comment: Makes up in part for the penalty miss and puts the baggies back in business.\n35:6 Comment: That all stemmed actually from that little slip by Kurt Zouma.\n35:9 Comment: I don't think the ball from Ivanovic to him was good either.\n35:12 Comment: And then West Brom and Jalbin continue to recycle the ball,\n35:15 Comment: just as they did there.\n35:17 Comment: Rondon doing really well to acrobatically keep that going,\n35:20 Comment: keep that alive.\n35:22 Comment: In behind Ivanovic, he can't get there.\n35:24 Comment: The cross is a little bit too big.\n35:26 Comment: But then watch James Morrison this time.\n35:28 Comment: He just watches it, composes himself.\n35:30 Comment: The one thing he's saying, get over the top of this, don't sky it.\n35:33 Comment: He keeps it down and it flies through the traffic straight into the back of the net.\n35:39 Comment: But the actual ball from Ivanovic to Zouma,\n35:43 Comment: when they were comfortable in possession, Chelsea,\n35:46 Comment: I don't think was a great one.\n35:48 Comment: The player slipped.\n35:49 Comment: And in that moment, the Albion never let Chelsea breathe\n35:52 Comment: and got themselves right back in the game.\n35:58 Comment: So West Brom become the 20th and last Premier League side\n36:3 Comment: to score this season.\n36:6 Comment: There's a yellow card there.\n36:8 Comment: Pedro chopped down by James McLean.\n36:16 Comment: A booking for the baggie.\n36:20 Comment: Mark Clatton being very precise in where the ball needs to be placed.\n36:37 Comment: Terrier late arrival in the penalty area.\n36:41 Comment: Skimmed off a West Brom head.\n36:43 Comment: Hence a corner.\n36:49 Comment: That's hard to take.\n36:53 Comment: Clear by Rondon.\n37:20 Comment: Morrison.\n37:22 Comment: McLean.\n37:27 Comment: Brunt now.\n37:29 Comment: Jakob.\n37:31 Comment: And the ball.\n37:33 Comment: And it's in.\n37:55 Comment: McManaman.\n37:57 Comment: Turning away from Fabregas.\n37:59 Comment: Here's Fletcher.\n38:1 Comment: Spare man out wide.\n38:4 Comment: And James McLean rather wasted the position.\n38:13 Comment: Willian.\n38:19 Comment: Ball from Hazard.\n38:20 Comment: He needs more goals in his game, Willian.\n38:22 Comment: I think he's capable of it.\n38:25 Comment: James McLean with that cross just a few moments before.\n38:29 Comment: Just fired it straight at Courtois.\n38:32 Comment: He's back up on his feet now.\n38:34 Comment: He's barking his orders, he'd be happier.\n38:38 Comment: Just think they sometimes play this square ball into either Jakob or Fletcher\n38:41 Comment: and he's getting picked off, John, and they're causing their own problems.\n38:44 Comment: They try and go into Rondon or go wider and then get it back into Morrison\n38:47 Comment: and then he goes wide from there.\n38:49 Comment: It suits them a lot better to me.\n38:53 Comment: Jakob's never going to recover.\n38:55 Comment: If he loses possession when he's up against Willian, Pedro or Hazard,\n38:58 Comment: he's going to be in big trouble.\n39:1 Comment: Crossed up.\n39:3 Comment: Here's Pedro. Olsen lunged in.\n39:5 Comment: Pedro's still on his feet.\n39:7 Comment: Willian!\n39:13 Comment: That's it.\n39:15 Comment: Again, they've made the most of that space.\n39:17 Comment: He's annoyed.\n39:18 Comment: That's got to end up in the back of the net.\n39:20 Comment: Willian's got to be putting that one in.\n39:23 Comment: Olsen here commits to this challenge, knowing he's never going to get there.\n39:26 Comment: Pedro does really well, doesn't panic.\n39:30 Comment: He's got to score that one. It's not even close, is it?\n39:32 Comment: He might have hit the post or scraped the post.\n39:36 Comment: He's a yard wide when really and truly that.\n39:39 Comment: He's got to be going in.\n39:45 Comment: Hey!\n40:5 Comment: They're rather wayward.\n40:7 Comment: Getting grunt on the back foot.\n40:15 Comment: Hey!\n40:17 Comment: Go!\n40:27 Comment: As we approach half-time, the identity of West Brom's penalty taker\n40:30 Comment: will be a subject of interval debate.\n40:32 Comment: It ended up being Morrison.\n40:34 Comment: Ordinarily, Berrahino would have had a shout.\n40:36 Comment: Ricky Lambert had he started.\n40:38 Comment: We saw Chris Brunt with the ball at one stage in the build-up to it.\n40:40 Comment: He's a fine striker of a dead ball.\n40:44 Comment: Morrison it was. Courtois saved.\n40:46 Comment: It was nil-nil at the time.\n40:49 Comment: Chelsea going two in front through Pedro and Costa.\n40:52 Comment: One full-back by James Morrison for West Brom.\n41:14 Comment: Cesc Fabregas.\n41:27 Comment: It's Hazard.\n41:29 Comment: He's the season's player of the year.\n41:33 Comment: Disentangling himself from James Morrison.\n41:35 Comment: Fabregas.\n41:38 Comment: And Costa goes over as Piniqueta follows up.\n41:41 Comment: And Chelsea have their two-goal cushion back.\n41:53 Comment: That's a rarity.\n41:54 Comment: You don't normally see as Piniqueta up in the 18-yard box.\n41:56 Comment: Great run. Great running off the line.\n41:58 Comment: It's been actually well spotted by McManaman,\n42:0 Comment: but he doesn't really go the full distance with him,\n42:2 Comment: not tight enough.\n42:3 Comment: Costa does well to resist the challenge.\n42:5 Comment: That little scoop pass from Fabregas.\n42:8 Comment: He just does well to hang on to that.\n42:10 Comment: And in the end, as Piniqueta takes a chance, makes his run.\n42:14 Comment: I think it goes through Gareth McCaul, his legs.\n42:17 Comment: Just inside that near post again.\n42:19 Comment: There's been some soft goals conceded by West Bromwich Albion,\n42:22 Comment: but well played as Piniqueta.\n42:25 Comment: It's not what he's all about.\n42:26 Comment: He's in the team for his defensive work.\n42:29 Comment: He denies the opponents.\n42:30 Comment: Well, there he's took a chance and got himself a very important goal.\n42:37 Comment: Three goals from Spanish internationals.\n42:41 Comment: Pedro Costa.\n42:45 Comment: A place for Spain, despite being born in Brazil.\n42:47 Comment: And as Piniqueta.\n42:57 Comment: The head of Zouma and the chest of as Piniqueta.\n43:5 Comment: The first lips of a manager who knows that already the game is up.\n43:11 Comment: And the first time he's scored in a knockout competition.\n43:26 Comment: As Piniqueta's goal.\n43:27 Comment: His first in the Barclays Premier League.\n43:31 Comment: Previously scored in a knockout competition.\n43:33 Comment: For Chelsea.\n43:41 Comment: Their second goal bet all the hallmarks of a top team.\n43:44 Comment: Where they were defending and very quickly counter attack was so rapid.\n43:49 Comment: Great work from Costa to get in the box and finish it off.\n43:52 Comment: I think Tony Pulis will be disappointed with the manner they've conceded.\n44:10 Comment: Hazard.\n44:11 Comment: Willian.\n44:20 Comment: Chelsea.\n44:21 Comment: Use of the hand.\n44:41 Comment: Chelsea who made such a hesitant start here.\n44:43 Comment: Approaching the midway point of this Premier League game in pretty fine fettle.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Chelsea in the black strip today\n0:5 Comment: West Bromwich Albion having scored their first Barclays Premier League goal of the season\n0:10 Comment: have been far too accommodating to Chelsea on occasion hence the visitors 3-1 lead\n0:20 Comment: Olsen\n0:23 Comment: Zouma returned with interest\n0:26 Comment: if no subtlety\n0:30 Comment: and\n0:33 Comment: What's gonna happen John for West Bromwich Albion to get right back into this\n0:38 Comment: if Rondon or\n0:40 Comment: McLean, McManaman anybody gets a chance. I've got to take it\n0:44 Comment: Because despite the fact that I can still feel that the Albion will create chances\n0:50 Comment: I also think that there's gonna be more there for Chelsea if they\n0:54 Comment: Play their fast accurate football\n0:57 Comment: That Pedro was involved in at times in the first 45 minutes\n1:0 Comment: I mean it's more of that if they get the fourth then they can\n1:4 Comment: Pretty much get what they like here today you feel\n1:6 Comment: Next goals a really big one a key one in this game.

eyes straight ahead and down the tunnel.\n9:51 Comment: Substitution is happening now, Gary Cahill.\n9:53 Comment: It is a free kick just outside the penalty area.\n9:57 Comment: Cahill wearing that face mask\n9:59 Comment: because of the accidental collision in training this week.\n10:3 Comment: And Willian is being sacrificed here.\n10:15 Comment: So, can Rondon complete the job?\n10:18 Comment: It was he who was bursting clear.\n10:21 Comment: Rondon it is, and only a corner.\n10:32 Comment: They've got a bit of organising to do now,\n10:34 Comment: because, of course, you lose John Terry, you lose a lot of...\n10:37 Comment: You lose a voice, you lose someone that is usually very good\n10:41 Comment: with his defensive work.\n10:44 Comment: And...\n10:45 Comment: I'm sure Gary Cahill will have been drilled in that respect\n10:48 Comment: before he gets out onto the field.\n10:49 Comment: He's got to know exactly who he's got.\n10:53 Comment: McManaman.\n10:55 Comment: It's Gruntz.\n10:56 Comment: Would have preferred it on his left, but still.\n11:7 Comment: It did look like a significant amount of contact, John, did it?\n11:11 Comment: Not to me, it didn't.\n11:12

Matic.\n12:5 Comment: What an awkward day for goalkeepers.\n12:7 Comment: No chances taken by Myhill.\n12:9 Comment: Yeah, he's delighted to actually see that.\n12:13 Comment: Boaz Myhill in front of him\n12:14 Comment: and then just get his hands on it and push it round the post\n12:16 Comment: because a couple of soft ones have found their way in the net.\n12:19 Comment: The first one with a deflection.\n12:27 Comment: Pedro.\n12:39 Comment: Manaman losing it to Fabregas.\n12:44 Comment: Hazard.\n12:54 Comment: West Brom are plotting a change.\n12:56 Comment: Ricky Lambert is coming on in place of James McLean.\n13:2 Comment: That's at the next break in play.\n13:7 Comment: Tony Pulis doesn't need quite so many bodies in the middle of the park now\n13:10 Comment: so he can afford to do that.\n13:12 Comment: Playing against 10, he can play two up top,\n13:14 Comment: he can play more of a traditional 4-4-2.\n13:23 Comment: Morrison.\n13:24 Comment: McManaman.\n13:25 Comment: Had a very lively first half.\n13:27 Comment: Brunt.\n13:32 Comment: McManaman.\n13:33 Comment: Great header.\n13:34 Comment: It's a super goal back.\n13:38 Comment: James Morrison.\n13:41 Comment: Might have had a hat-trick and he scored the penalty.\n13:43 Comment: As it is,\n13:44 Comment: he's hauled West Brom back into the game a second time.\n13:48 Comment: Really good play again from Callum McManaman.\n13:50 Comment: Sidesteps Ivanovic, just puts it in there.\n13:53 Comment: James Morrison completely facing the wrong way\n13:55 Comment: but knows exactly what he's doing.\n13:57 Comment: You just want a little nick on this, a little glance.\n14:0 Comment: He doesn't really know whether that's going in at the far post\n14:2 Comment: or whether that's going to somebody else.\n14:4 Comment: Once he turns around and sees it in the back of the net, he's delighted.\n14:8 Comment: Game on again now.\n14:12 Comment: It shows a seed of doubt in Chelsea.\n14:14 Comment: He finds a man down and only now one goal up.\n14:19 Comment: Here's the substitution.\n14:25 Comment: Fain making way for Ricky Lambert.\n14:31 Comment: He's up on his feet again, Tony Pulis,\n14:33 Comment: which tells us a lot about the balance of the game.\n14:37 Comment: FANS ROAR\n14:53 Comment: Matic.\n14:56 Comment: Interesting one for Mourinho now,\n14:58 Comment: whether or not with the likes of Hazard, Pedro and Fabregas.\n15:2 Comment: Man short.\n15:4 Comment: Listen, they're great going forward and they're keeping the ball,\n15:6 Comment: but they're never going to give you a tremendous amount going back the way.\n15:9 Comment: That's the decision the Chelsea manager's got to make right now.\n15:13 Comment: Do you still feel with those goals?\n15:14 Comment: his team are capable of scoring more.\n15:17 Comment: Does he maybe bring on a Mikel or Loftus-Cheek,\n15:19 Comment: anything else with a little bit more physical presence?\n15:34 Comment: Matic.\n15:44 Comment: A game that is proving far from straightforward.\n15:52 Comment: And a start to the season for Chelsea\n15:54 Comment: that has been far from straightforward.\n15:59 Comment: Twice they've established a two-goal lead.\n16:2 Comment: Now it's Cahill with the problem of Rondon.\n16:14 Comment: And Gary Cahill's just poked that out of play, hasn't he?\n16:21 Comment: Referee's actually changed his mind and seen that.\n16:27 Comment: Just a throw.\n16:29 Comment: It must be awkward playing with those facial masks, you know.\n16:32 Comment: Difficult at times, I'm sure.\n16:34 Comment: Just conscious of it.\n16:44 Comment: Yes!\n17:6 Comment: Northorn's a much noisier place now.\n17:8 Comment: Yeah, it is.

Comment: He hit that very sweet.\n17:34 Comment: Good early ball in from Pedro.\n17:38 Comment: It's Diego Costa watching.\n17:39 Comment: He spreads that out wide.\n17:40 Comment: Now he's looking to

    "summary": "On a rain-soaked Saturday afternoon at The Hawthorns, Chelsea eked out a defiant 3-2 victory over West Bromwich Albion in a pulsating Premier League encounter. The Champions faced early adversity and a determined West Brom side, but moments of high-quality football and individual brilliance secured the three points for JosÃ© Mourinho's men.\n\nFrom the opening whistle, West Brom looked eager to set the tone and capitalize on any hesitations from a Chelsea side that had been less than convincing in their early season displays. Early touches for goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois calmed initial fears, while mentions of other key players like Cesc Fabregas and Eden Hazard helped set the scene for a tense and gripping contest.\n\nChelsea's defensive steel was already stretched with Gary Cahill wearing a protective mask due to a facial injury suffered against Manchester City. Mourinho's pre-match decisions had included the replacement of Cahill with Kurt Zouma, a reflection of the cautious approach the manager needed to take amidst a campaign marred by injuries and low confidence.\n\nIn the early minutes, West Bromâs strategy was clearâthey pressed high and wide, trying to exploit Chelseaâs full-backs and get crosses into the box. This culminated in several dangerous moments, particularly courtesy of Calum McManaman whose runs and deliveries kept the Chelsea defense on tenterhooks. James McLean was also lively, narrowly missing the finishing touch on a couple of Dawson's crosses.\n\nChelsea, on the other hand, invoked more patient build-ups afforded by the creative outlets of Fabregas and Diego Costa. The tension continued to bubble until the 13th minute when Zouma was a touch late on Morrison, signaling West Brom's intent. Efforts from Pedro, Willian, and Hazard illustrated Chelsea's capacity to probe and seek openings, though final deliveries often lacked the required precision.\n\nOn the 20-minute mark, a horrible foul by Matic on McManaman resulted in a penalty for West Brom. It was an apparent mistake; McManaman, already drifting away from the goal, didn't seem in a place to demand such a challenge. James Morrison stepped up to take the penalty but saw his effort saved masterfully by Courtois, who used his trailing leg to maintain the scoreline at 0-0. The miss seemed to sting Albion's initial buoyancy as Chelsea began to exert more control.\n\nPedro, on his debut, injected life and verve into Chelsea's play. In the 20th minute, a deflected shot from Pedro, after a give-and-go with Hazard, found the back of the netâbringing Chelsea the lead. The deflection off Jonas Olsson left Boaz Myhill stranded, a hint at the fortuitous edge Chelsea would need on the day.\n\nCutting through the West Brom defense like a hot knife through butter, Pedro again found relevance in the next critical moment. A swiftly orchestrated counter-attack saw Pedro firing off a shot that Costa tapped in after Myhill failed to properly clear. Costa, hungry for his first goal of the campaign, made no mistake from close range.\n\nA glimpse into the rhythm would see West Brom continuing to pursue a tactical response. Despite missed opportunities, Morrison redeemed himself partially by converting a thumping header past Courtois after Rondon challenged Ivanovic and kept the ball alive. The belief was rekindled among the home supporters, temporarily anyways.\n\nAs the half progressed, Chelsea had other chances to extend their lead. An unmarked Ivanovic couldn't capitalize, and a stinging Hazard strike yielded nothing more than residual tension. Just before halftime, a whipped cross from Fabregas found Costa whose initial effort was blocked, but Azpilicueta followed up, slotting home to re-establish the two-goal cushion. This ill-tempered first half by the visitors kept Chalky Tony Pulis visibly agitated on the home side's technical area.\n\nThe second half promised more drama, starting with a Mourinho-led cautious advancement. The play was temporarily acute until an incident that marked a shift in the game. Costa, never far from confrontation, was booked alongside Jacob after a fiery exchange, an undercurrent that defined much of the game's chippy moments.\n\nIn the 54th minute, John Terry, lagging against Rondonâs pace, tugged the Venezuelan forward to the ground, leaving Mark Clattenburg no alternative but to issue the Chelsea captain a straight red card. Cahill was introduced, yet the dynamics had shifted, favoring West Brom on paper at least.\n\nWest Brom immediately tried to capitalize on the man advantage but suffered setbacks from a resolute Courtois. The goalkeeper's dexterous save off a thunderous free-kick exemplified his marque capabilities that kept Chelsea's hopes alive. Ricky Lambert was introduced by Pulis to enforce a more traditional two-up-front approachâit bore fruit quickly as Morrison headed in another goal to cut the deficit to one. Suddenly, the game was hanging by a thread.\n\nMourinho had to make strategic merit calls, injecting Obi Mikel to fortify defensively. Hazard continued to threaten, snaking through defenders, his shots reminding West Brom that resilience would be key. The game hung tantalizingly, poised for a memorable climax.\n\nSeveral chances came and went for both teams. Costa and Hazard tested Myhill, while Rondon and Lambert kept Courtois busy. The chess match, nuanced by tactical decisions and changes in momentum, was mesmerizing.\n\nLate in the game, physical and mental fatigue was apparent. In what should have been a routine clearance, Craig Dawson mishandled, but fortuitously saw no blue-shirted finish. An inspiring Hazard drew fouls, preserving brief respites for Chelsea, who looked to see out the game with five players in defense. \n\nIn the final moments, despite the incessant noise and increasing pressure from the home crowd, Chelsea held firm. Myhill swept as an additional defender, but all efforts proved futile.\n\nAs the final whistle blew, it was clear the champions had weathered the storm. They secured their first win of the season, Pedro's dynamic debut intertwining with defensive resilience and Courtois' excellence on penalties. Meanwhile, West Brom could reflect on what might have beenâa valiant game marred by missed opportunities and a feeling of \"what if\" after Morrisonâs earlier penalty miss.\n\nThe game was a testament to Premier League drama, skill, tempers, and unpredictabilityâwith crucial talking points and lessons for both teams moving forward. For Chelsea, a sigh of relief; for West Brom, a rueful glance at opportunities missed. The rain had poured and set the drama, but it was Chelsea who emerged from the deluge with a hard-fought, memorable victory."
