    "summary": "The clash between West Bromwich Albion and Chelsea on the hallowed grounds of The Hawthorns was an enthralling affair, teeming with fervor, controversy, and high-octane action. As the match progressed, it became clear that Chelsea’s tactical acumen would be tested against West Brom's perseverance. This vivid depiction of the game's timeline will take us through the significant events that shaped this riveting encounter.\n\nAs the clock struck to signal kickoff, West Brom had the honor of starting the action, and within the first few moments, the ball had already found its way out of play—a pattern that would punctuate the game, reflecting both teams' relentless effort to gain control. West Brom continued to dominate the early minutes with throw-ins, trying to assert authority on home turf. Chelsea, however, quickly adapted and had the first significant scoring chance, with Pedro, Eden Hazard, and Diego Costa forming a lethal trio that kept probing the West Brom defense.\n\nIn one notable early play, James Morrison won a penalty for West Brom at the 12-minute mark. Nemanja Matic’s foul presented an opportunity on a silver platter, but Morrison’s low shot was brilliantly read by Thibaut Courtois, denying West Brom an early lead. The missed penalty led to a series of frenetic plays, with both teams committing fouls and each side being awarded indirect free-kicks in quick succession.\n\nChelsea’s first goal came in the 20th minute, a slick combination play that saw Eden Hazard slip the ball to Pedro who calmly slotted it into the bottom right corner beyond the reach of goalkeeper Boaz Myhill. Just minutes after Pedro's goal, Chelsea doubled their lead. It was Pedro again who was at the heart of the action, this time providing an assist to Diego Costa for a tap-in, making the score 2-0 in favor of the visitors. The furious tempo continued, with West Brom struggling to keep pace but showing resilience.\n\nJames Morrison managed to reclaim some honor for West Brom around the 35th minute, capitalizing on a Salomon Rondon pass to score and reduce the deficit to 2-1. However, Chelsea regained their two-goal cushion deep into the first half, Cesar Azpilicueta firing a shot from outside the box into the bottom left corner after a precise pass from Diego Costa. \n\nThus, the first half drew to a close with Chelsea leading 3-1. It was a half where both sides had showcased their contrasting styles—West Brom with their opportunistic long balls and Chelsea with their dominating possession play.\n\nThe second half began with the same electrifying pace. Chelsea looked poised to cement their advantage while West Brom sought to claw their way back. An early foul by Pedro gave West Brom a chance, but the ensuing indirect free-kick bore no fruit. As play continued, John Terry’s foul became the match's pivotal moment in the 9th minute of the second half. It resulted in a red card, reducing Chelsea to 10 men, and forcing them to substitute Willian for Gary Cahill to bolster the defense. \n\nWest Brom could smell the blood in the water and had numerous chances to pull closer. James Morrison, Callum McManaman, and Salomon Rondon all created and squandered opportunities. West Brom’s persistence was finally rewarded in the 62nd minute when James Morrison brilliantly headed a cross from McManaman off the crossbar into the net, narrowing Chelsea’s lead to 3-2.\n\nFurther substitutions saw McClean, McManaman, and Morrison make way for Rickie Lambert, Serge Gnabry, and Craig Gardner, respectively, as West Brom manager Tony Pulis sought fresh legs to capitalize on their numerical advantage. Chelsea's resilience was on display as they defended with tenacity, marked by multiple clearances and crucial interceptions, to protect their slim lead.\n\nDespite incessant pressure and numerous chances created by West Brom, Chelsea's defense, marshaled effectively by Courtois, stood firm. The dying minutes of the game saw end-to-end action, with shots off target from both Eden Hazard and Craig Brunt epitomizing the frantic finish.\n\nThe final whistle blew with Chelsea edging out West Brom 3-2. The visitors' blend of clinical finishing and strategic audacity, coupled with a robust defensive shutdown post Terry's red card, underscored their victory. West Brom, despite their tenacious effort and inspired comebacks, were left to rue missed opportunities and defensive lapses early on.\n\nIn summary, the game was a tactical masterclass interspersed with moments of brilliance, errors, and drama. Chelsea’s victory was a testament to their proficient strategy and lethal attacking prowess, while West Brom’s spirited fight exemplified their resilience, making this contest a memorable chapter in Premier League lore."
