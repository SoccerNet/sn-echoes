    "input": "\n    Chelsea 2 - 0 Aston\n\nFirst Half:\n\n0:0 Comment: Before the season kicked off, few could have imagined that,\n0:4 Comment: eight games in, a glance at the Barclays Premier League table\n0:7 Comment: would show defending champions Chelsea four points outside the relegation zone.\n0:12 Comment: There hasn't been too much cheer for followers of Aston Villa either,\n0:17 Comment: third bottom and without a win since the opening day at Bournemouth on August 8th.\n0:22 Comment: Villa might have been expected to struggle,\n0:26 Comment: but what do you make of Chelsea's start, Tony Gale?\n0:29 Comment: Well, iffy to say the least, Tony.\n0:31 Comment: No-one predicted it, I was tight for one, thought they'd retain the Premier League title.\n0:34 Comment: I think you can fairly say that's out the game now.\n0:37 Comment: I think it's all about getting the season back on track and qualifying in that top four.\n0:41 Comment: Big, big game today, you can feel the pressure in and around the stadium,\n0:45 Comment: down the dressing room area and everything down the tunnel.\n0:48 Comment: I think it's up to Chelsea to perform today, and Villa have got problems of their own.\n0:51 Comment: Another team who need to perform for their manager.\n0:54 Comment: APPLAUSE\n0:58 Comment: Five changes for Chelsea, four changes for Aston Villa.\n1:6 Comment: Chelsea supporters doing their best to back their team and also their manager.\n1:10 Comment: Who has been at the centre of yet more controversy following the 3-1 home defeat\n1:14 Comment: to Southampton before the international break.\n1:18 Comment: Spoke out afterwards, comments which were picked up by the Football Association,\n1:21 Comment: who issued him with a £50,000 fine, a one-game stadium ban.\n1:25 Comment: Suspended for 12 months.\n1:28 Comment: And a cry, Jose Mourinho has already gone up from the Chelsea support.\n1:37 Comment: Here's Hatton.\n1:38 Comment: CLIP\n1:40 Comment: Clipped by Pedro.\n1:44 Comment: Well, the couple of... Here's the foul on Alan Hatton by Pedro,\n1:49 Comment: trying to just get back after the ball.\n1:51 Comment: Big, big shock, Eden Hazard not starting today, Tony, I think.\n1:54 Comment: Only being on the bench.\n1:55 Comment: Best player in the country, or the Premier League, sorry, last season.\n2:0 Comment: And when I look at this Villa side, I think it's a statement of intent by Tim\n2:3 Comment: that he's got a fair share of attacking players out there,\n2:5 Comment: but Gil, Ayoub, Grealish and Gestede up front as well,\n2:9 Comment: so he's having a go, and Jose Mourinho, of course,\n2:13 Comment: bringing a couple of those youngsters in today, Mbaba and Loftus-Cheek.\n2:19 Comment: Here's Richardson.\n2:21 Comment: Here Richardson starting in the Premier League for the first time this season.\n2:25 Comment: Coming ahead of Jordan Amavi in the left-back row.\n2:31 Comment: Grealish, Gestede in the middle.\n2:42 Comment: Loftus-Cheek.\n2:44 Comment: He'll pick up the pass for Diego Costa when maybe Willian was better placed for Chelsea.\n2:49 Comment: Well, he had a great chance of a break there in just picking the pass,\n2:53 Comment: that's where you might be wanted, and Eden Hazard on the ball doing that.\n2:56 Comment: But gotta give the youngster a chance today,\n2:59 Comment: gotta give him a chance to fit in there and start playing his stuff in there with Chelsea.\n3:3 Comment: Fabregas just looks like he's holding in there with Ramirez at the moment,\n3:7 Comment: that will alternate, and Loftus-Cheek can relax and either play in front or alongside Ramirez,\n3:12 Comment: so interesting Chelsea rotating that central midfield around a little bit\n3:17 Comment: and giving the youngster his chance today, which he deserves.\n3:24 Comment: Robin Loftus-Cheek, the 19-year-old's only previous appearance in the Premier League this season,\n3:28 Comment: was off the bench when Chelsea lost here to Crystal Palace at the end of August.\n3:33 Comment: Two home defeats for the champions already,\n3:36 Comment: it really has been a miserable start for Jose Mourinho's team.\n3:42 Comment: Frustrated in his attempts to sign John Stones,\n3:45 Comment: Everton in England set to half just before the deadline closed at the end of August,\n3:51 Comment: looking to strengthen in defence.\n4:2 Comment: Mourinho loses out.\n4:7 Comment: Grielich, who managed to get away from the challenge,\n4:10 Comment: or he stumbled away from the challenge, but Villa do get the free kick.\n4:15 Comment: That's where Grielich is trying to be, behind that Chelsea midfield and in front of their back four.\n4:20 Comment: It's up to Ramirez and Fabregas to pick him up, they've had problems there this season,\n4:24 Comment: screening the back four.\n4:26 Comment: Grielich, although only a youngster, they'll be expecting big things of him today,\n4:30 Comment: given that position of freedom just behind the striker.\n4:34 Comment: RUDI GERSTED\n4:38 Comment: Tim Sherwood knows that his team have to play to their strengths.\n4:41 Comment: Rudi Gersted, a formidable force in attack.\n4:44 Comment: Richards has also gone forward.\n4:50 Comment: Wild and wide by Carlos Hill.\n4:55 Comment: It was a difficult chance, came out on the half-volley,\n4:57 Comment: good header by John Terry, going backwards, he got a little bit of distance on it,\n5:0 Comment: and he was just over the top with the half-volley.\n5:4 Comment: It was Heldy from a Valencia midfielder who scored when making his first start\n5:10 Comment: in the Premier League this season at Leicester, where Villa imploded.\n5:15 Comment: They're led by two goals to nil and they crumbled in the closing stages.\n5:19 Comment: It was a demoralising defeat, a confidence-knocking defeat.\n5:23 Comment: Yeah, they've had some strange results.\n5:25 Comment: I saw them, as I said earlier on, Tony, first game of the season,\n5:28 Comment: and Gersted came on in that game and scored.\n5:31 Comment: When you've got a player like him up front who's so devastating in the air,\n5:34 Comment: temptation is to go longer, but I think Villa have got to try and progress\n5:38 Comment: into that last third, then get their crosses into him,\n5:41 Comment: and believe you me, if the cross is coming at the right angle,\n5:43 Comment: it's nigh on impossible to stop if he's attacking that ball alongside a centre-back.\n5:50 Comment: The Brazilian just fielding his left jaw.\n5:55 Comment: He's clocked up a few air miles this week,\n5:58 Comment: wearing international duty with Brazil,\n6:1 Comment: who've started qualifying already for the next World Cup.\n6:6 Comment: Loftus-Cheek.\n6:10 Comment: The Costa down.\n6:13 Comment: What a great challenge it was by...\n6:17 Comment: I think it was Nick O'Richards who went up with him in a challenge,\n6:20 Comment: but he really clattered into him.\n6:22 Comment: Fair challenge, ball fell in the middle of him in the air and he clattered him.\n6:28 Comment: Pedro.\n6:30 Comment: Loftus-Cheek.\n6:33 Comment: Ball was spinning away from Gozan, Chelsea get the corner.\n6:37 Comment: Gersted didn't move his feet enough, did he, Loftus-Cheek,\n6:40 Comment: to get it out from between them and get a clean strike on goal.\n6:45 Comment: Pedro sets him up with a nice little ball inside,\n6:47 Comment: he's backing off, he's just trying to curl over the far corner,\n6:50 Comment: but it wasn't really going to happen.\n6:52 Comment: That was well stood up by Lesko.\n6:57 Comment: Just helped away from Zouma.\n7:6 Comment: Dani.\n7:8 Comment: Villa looked to counter quickly.\n7:12 Comment: Here's Fabregas.\n7:14 Comment: Fabregas who made his 100th appearance for Spain last weekend.\n7:18 Comment: One of a select few to reach that milestone.\n7:49 Comment: We'll be watching that one closely, John Terry up against Gersted,\n7:52 Comment: and Gersted's got to try and rough those two central defenders up,\n7:55 Comment: Terry and Zouma.\n7:58 Comment: It's tough to play against Gersted.\n8:0 Comment: Not many centre-backs will come up against centre-forwards like that this season.\n8:3 Comment: They're so prolific in the air, so powerful.\n8:7 Comment: So you've got to play them well, maybe drop off on occasions and let them win it.\n8:10 Comment: Diego Costa with Leskos.\n8:14 Comment: Richards' chief again trying to put pressure on Guzak,\n8:16 Comment: and he hasn't given up the chase.\n8:20 Comment: It's that raw enthusiasm which has quickly won the hearts of the Chelsea support.\n8:26 Comment: Well put under pressure there by Richards because he put it onto his wrong foot,\n8:31 Comment: his non-kicking foot, the right foot.\n8:34 Comment: He's got to be careful.\n8:35 Comment: So many of the big guns on the bench for Chelsea, including Matic.\n8:45 Comment: Matic substituted as a substitute against Southampton.\n8:51 Comment: Straightforward enough for Begovic.\n8:57 Comment: And it's a goal for Chelsea.\n8:59 Comment: Straightforward enough for Begovic.\n9:17 Comment: It's a poor ball by Barber, he's got to relax into this Chelsea framework\n9:21 Comment: and get that ball passing nice and quickly and into feet,\n9:24 Comment: not getting hurried and giving giveaways like that.\n9:29 Comment: Barber is a Ghanaian team-mate of Aston Villa's Jordan Ayo,\n9:36 Comment: signed from Augsburg of the German Bundesliga.\n9:42 Comment: Here's Ayo.\n9:52 Comment: A Chelsea threat.\n9:54 Comment: He's had fewer opportunities at Villa than his brother at Swansea City.\n10:15 Comment: Grealish.\n10:20 Comment: The mascot of Chelsea.\n10:24 Comment: Now Richards.\n10:32 Comment: Richards again.\n10:36 Comment: Taking on Barber, and getting beyond him.\n10:39 Comment: Gerstead wakes in the middle, joined by Grealish.\n10:42 Comment: It's back with Hutton.\n10:44 Comment: He was fortunate to get a second opportunity.\n10:47 Comment: He's wasted both of them, he's got in a great position,\n10:50 Comment: he out-powered and out-muscled Barber,\n10:52 Comment: rag-doled him out of it here, gets to this near-the-dead ball line,\n10:55 Comment: now he's got to pick someone out.\n10:57 Comment: Doesn't do, goes to that near post, comes off of Begovic,\n11:0 Comment: and again he's a little bit hurried in having a shot.\n11:3 Comment: Could have slid that into maybe Gerstead,\n11:5 Comment: but that was easy, overpowering the left-back,\n11:8 Comment: new into the team.\n11:10 Comment: And twice he's just a little bit hurried when he's in that last third.\n11:14 Comment: Chelsea! Chelsea! Chelsea!\n11:20 Comment: Branislav Ivanovic likely to be out for three weeks,\n11:22 Comment: he has not the best of seasons, the Serb who normally operates as Chelsea's right-back.\n11:29 Comment: More than 60 consecutive appearances in the Premier League,\n11:31 Comment: but it's meant to change at the back, with Barber coming in at left-back,\n11:36 Comment: and Aspilicueta switched to right-back.\n11:40 Comment: Roman Abramovic, the owner, high in the stands,\n11:43 Comment: kicking every ball.\n11:49 Comment: Cisneros saying this week that he had the opportunity to sit down\n11:52 Comment: with the owner after the home defeat by Southampton\n11:55 Comment: and was reassured that his job was safe.\n12:6 Comment: Willian.\n12:13 Comment: Chelsea! Chelsea! Chelsea!\n12:18 Comment: Hilton now trying to put pressure on Barber.\n12:23 Comment: And then it's Gerstead who's forced the error out of Begovic.\n12:26 Comment: We have a good start, Villartoni,\n12:28 Comment: and just take the game in 15-minute segments,\n12:31 Comment: and we're 13 minutes into it, this little first segment,\n12:34 Comment: and a quick start, they've pressed in on Chelsea.\n12:37 Comment: Goff this cheek has had a chance, but Hatton had a two-in-one.\n12:41 Comment: Chance is just in the same sort of movement,\n12:43 Comment: but Villar started well and on the front foot.\n12:46 Comment: The question is, can they keep it going?\n12:57 Comment: Ramirez.\n13:2 Comment: Ball has struck the shins of Lescott,\n13:5 Comment: which was perhaps fortunate for Villar, with Diego Costa threatening.\n13:11 Comment: Pedro.\n13:22 Comment: Willian, now Fabregas.\n13:24 Comment: After La Puerta has made a move,\n13:26 Comment: and he's been picked out by Fabregas,\n13:28 Comment: searching cross-field pass.\n13:31 Comment: Pedro.\n13:33 Comment: And chucked away from Willian by the allééed Gane.\n13:41 Comment: Payet.\n13:45 Comment: It's nice and open, isn't it?\n13:47 Comment: I think teams, they've lost that fear factor here at the Bridgetone.\n13:51 Comment: They have a go at teams now, and you can see that the way Villar started.\n13:54 Comment: I mean, this is a team who's down the bottom of the table,\n13:57 Comment: and a little bit of turmoil at the moment in terms of results,\n14:1 Comment: and they've come here right on the front foot with no fear.\n14:4 Comment: Just got to hang in there, and you get that half-hour mark,\n14:7 Comment: that's the next bit.\n14:11 Comment: Diego Costa gives chase.\n14:13 Comment: Watched by Richards.\n14:15 Comment: And away from Richards.\n14:18 Comment: It's an excellent recovery.\n14:21 Comment: That was a good battle, wasn't it?\n14:23 Comment: He was trying to cut in there on Michael Richards,\n14:25 Comment: and trying to make him make the foul.\n14:27 Comment: Richards did well to shepherd him out in the end.\n14:30 Comment: Just got a little bit too tight and let him get on the outside.\n14:33 Comment: Zouma's made his move.\n14:36 Comment: Touched away by Guzak.\n14:40 Comment: Hill.\n14:45 Comment: Gustav.\n14:50 Comment: Here's Grealish.\n14:54 Comment: Neatly done by Jack Grealish.\n14:57 Comment: And it's in.\n14:58 Comment: Neatly done by Jack Grealish.\n15:1 Comment: It's a tight angle for him.\n15:3 Comment: No fear again, Gustav did well, switched it out to Grealish,\n15:6 Comment: and he just had one thing in mind, he wanted to get his shot away,\n15:9 Comment: and Babas had a tough start to the game here on the left-back spot.\n15:12 Comment: Grealish chinks past him easily,\n15:14 Comment: gets his shot away through the legs of Aspilla Queta,\n15:17 Comment: but Babas a little bit isolated at the moment,\n15:21 Comment: it seems like they're picking on that side just to try and get at him.\n15:25 Comment: It's nothing you shouldn't really expect,\n15:28 Comment: only you come into the side as a youngster,\n15:30 Comment: or you're new into the side, transferred,\n15:32 Comment: they're going to pick on you.\n15:34 Comment: So he's got to stand up to this little bit.\n15:55 Comment: Good shot.\n16:20 Comment: Let's go.\n16:21 Comment: Now Richardson.\n16:25 Comment: Grealish.\n16:35 Comment: Richards.\n16:39 Comment: Touchdown by Gustav.\n16:43 Comment: One back by Pedro.\n16:45 Comment: Hill thought he was fouled.\n16:51 Comment: Legers raised for an offside against Diego Costa.\n16:55 Comment: That was unlucky, Loftus-Cheek did well there,\n16:57 Comment: but it was also good defending by Villa,\n17:0 Comment: because they held the line knowing he was offside.\n17:2 Comment: But chinks inside a couple of challenges there, Loftus-Cheek,\n17:5 Comment: and look, they hold the line, Villa.\n17:7 Comment: Good play, you can see Richardson holding it alongside his centre-backs there.\n17:11 Comment: Did well to play him off.\n17:13 Comment: Costa available to Chelsea again today\n17:15 Comment: after serving his three-game suspension.\n17:21 Comment: One goal in the Premier League so far\n17:23 Comment: and the win at West Bromwich Albion.\n17:27 Comment: He's scored 11 in his first ten games last season\n17:30 Comment: when he was in the top ten.\n17:33 Comment: He's got a good team,\n17:35 Comment: he's got a good team,\n17:41 Comment: ten games last season when\n17:43 Comment: Chelsea began with such a swagger.\n17:53 Comment: The title is almost sewn up, isn't it, by the half-way point.\n17:58 Comment: He just cruised into it in the end,\n18:0 Comment: but I wonder if that cruising sort of went into the next season.\n18:3 Comment: It's only a little bit of an effect there\n18:5 Comment: and a little bit of complacency.\n18:11 Comment: As you were saying before, it is the worst start for a Premier League winning side since\n18:22 Comment: the days when you played for Blackburn Rovers and Tim Sherwood was your captain, Blackburn\n18:29 Comment: winning the title just after you'd left.\n18:31 Comment: Blackburn Rovers made the poorest start to any Premier League winning team.\n18:39 Comment: Chelsea with eight points from eight games, it's their worst start for 37 years.\n18:52 Comment: Fabregas.\n18:57 Comment: Willian.\n19:4 Comment: I just caught him I thought, but Richardson was half pulling out of this challenge.\n19:8 Comment: The referee deemed it was nothing malicious here, look just taps it around him, he's kind\n19:12 Comment: of pulling out and he just gets clipped so correct decision, no yellow card.\n19:21 Comment: Given away by Pedra, won back by Banner.\n19:31 Comment: Alphalacrata.\n19:34 Comment: Willian.\n19:36 Comment: Had gone out of play.\n19:41 Comment: He's got goals with free kicks in each of his last four games.\n19:47 Comment: Chelsea head against Southampton, and on target again this week with Brazil.\n19:52 Comment: That's well played Jack Grealish wasn't it, just didn't knock it off, just hoping to find\n20:6 Comment: a pass, he realised he had no support, had to bravery it a whole run to the ball.\n20:9 Comment: I think this kid's a talent, I really do.\n20:14 Comment: Missed a chunk of the early part of the season with an ankle problem, the 20 year old who\n20:18 Comment: broke through last season.\n20:22 Comment: Westwood.\n20:35 Comment: A bobble with the interception.\n20:47 Comment: Missed that with Zuma.\n20:50 Comment: Hayek.\n20:52 Comment: He's had it.\n21:5 Comment: Villa's back line of four where at the Bordemois Heath training ground this week, the only\n21:9 Comment: absentee was Alan Hutton who was away with Scotland, Matt Goozant was away with the United\n21:15 Comment: States on international duty.\n21:18 Comment: They played Mexico in a qualifier for the Confederations Cup in Pasadena.\n21:25 Comment: In by Richardson, Gested.\n21:30 Comment: Good play by Villa again, this time they build up down there left hand side and can get into\n21:34 Comment: those dangerous areas but failing to lift the ball in the air, they've got to lift it\n21:38 Comment: in the air for Gested.\n21:41 Comment: Get over the top of defenders, he's a good header of the ball, they've got to use his\n21:44 Comment: strengths.\n21:46 Comment: Grealish.\n21:50 Comment: Yes, running into Aspilicueta but Villa got the free kick.\n21:54 Comment: Good play again, the kid really brave on the ball, not releasing it early, having plenty\n21:59 Comment: of touches on it, draws the challenge from Aspilicueta and the foul as well.\n22:3 Comment: Clear block off.\n22:5 Comment: He's had a good start, Jack Grealish.\n22:7 Comment: I think he must have been given instructions, get on that ball, you play, you can play so\n22:12 Comment: you must play.\n22:16 Comment: Good play.\n22:26 Comment: Plenty of alternatives here for Aston Villa.\n22:29 Comment: Richardson has stepped away.\n22:46 Comment: Begovic in trouble.\n22:50 Comment: Yes, I just didn't think he quite had the power on it from Ayoub, really.\n22:55 Comment: It's a trouble Begovic, I think he's over here and he's getting this one covered.\n22:58 Comment: It's not bad but you can see that Begovic has got the time to get over there, he's just\n23:3 Comment: over the top.\n23:6 Comment: Look to score in the Premier League, having joined Aston Villa from Bologna in France.\n23:11 Comment: 13 signings made by Villa during the summer months.\n23:24 Comment: Tim Sherwood did his job at the end of last season, securing another year in the top flight\n23:29 Comment: for Aston Villa.\n23:32 Comment: Arrived in February, replacing Paul Lambert, took Villa to the FA Cup final as well.\n23:42 Comment: Getting after the ball well in that midfield aren't they? Westwood and Ganner, they're\n23:48 Comment: getting after the ball and Grealish is coming back to supplement it.\n23:53 Comment: Getting after it really quickly.\n23:55 Comment: Good chance here Chelsea, set piece, Fabregas to deliver.\n23:59 Comment: Get some height up for this.\n24:1 Comment: Chery in there with Zouma.\n24:4 Comment: He's been headed away from Guzan by Richards.\n24:7 Comment: Ramirez.\n24:11 Comment: Pedro.\n24:13 Comment: Zouma.\n24:15 Comment: And this time Guzan holds on.\n24:17 Comment: Well probably the one you don't want out on the dead ball line there, Zouma.\n24:20 Comment: Just getting out to that left hand side and really should have been offside if the line\n24:23 Comment: was better than this.\n24:25 Comment: They'd just gone a little bit deep there Villa but they were lucky the cross wasn't all that.\n24:35 Comment: Another problem here for Micah Richards.\n24:42 Comment: She's not moving too easily.\n24:47 Comment: Back in England after a stint in Italy with Fiorentina.\n24:53 Comment: Diego Costa's kicked the ball out for a throw in here, it's made Chelsea.\n24:58 Comment: Tidden Villa in, normally you just give it back to the keeper and it's cleared up the\n25:1 Comment: pitch but Villa can't go anywhere from here.\n25:12 Comment: Hudson looks for Gstaad.\n25:17 Comment: Fabregas.\n25:27 Comment: Zouma.\n25:34 Comment: Richardson with the interception.\n25:42 Comment: Gstaad.\n25:57 Comment: A little bit of free kick to Chelsea.\n26:11 Comment: Willian.\n26:15 Comment: Ramirez.\n26:22 Comment: Gstaad with John Terry.\n26:31 Comment: They just had a shaky start to the game, Babra in that left back spot and he just wanted\n26:35 Comment: him to get out of a couple of balls and make a few nice passes and easy passes and get settled\n26:40 Comment: into it.\n26:41 Comment: A little bit unsure at the moment, making the players around him a little bit unsure.\n26:52 Comment: Ramirez.\n26:57 Comment: Kicked to safety by Richardson and picked up now by Grealish.\n27:3 Comment: Hill.\n27:10 Comment: Grealish.\n27:14 Comment: He was bundled into touch then.\n27:34 Comment: Bedrick, took his eye off the ball.\n27:40 Comment: Is that some of Chelsea's season?\n27:43 Comment: Well, someone like Pedro has a poor first touch then, you know you're struggling.\n27:47 Comment: He's looking to see what he's going to do with the ball when he's got it rather than\n27:50 Comment: get it in under control first.\n27:52 Comment: Just took his eye off it.\n27:54 Comment: Mourinho, I think, is just trying to spur his team on down the line there, trying to\n28:0 Comment: do the horrible side of the game as well as, obviously, the control and the passing but\n28:6 Comment: get after the ball quickly, trying to get the most out of them.\n28:11 Comment: A little clip in midfield, nothing much in that one for me.\n28:14 Comment: Westwood.\n28:21 Comment: £50,000 fine being appealed by Jose Mourinho.\n28:25 Comment: Means that he's clicked the ball in the right direction.\n28:29 Comment: He's got a chance to get it in.\n28:35 Comment: £50,000 fine being appealed by Jose Mourinho.\n28:39 Comment: Means that he's collected over £180,000 worth of fines in his time in management.\n28:53 Comment: Triple ball by Pedro to find Rafa Liqueira.\n28:57 Comment: Villa suddenly stretched.\n29:0 Comment: Good work by Ayo who got that.\n29:1 Comment: Aware that Richardson was out of position.\n29:3 Comment: Yeah, I think Ayo had let him go initially and then realised and got back and did well.\n29:9 Comment: This will be a way-swinging corner kick from Fabregas.\n29:19 Comment: On by Ramirez.\n29:21 Comment: Out by Hutton, only as far as Pedro.\n29:24 Comment: Oh, silly foul.\n29:26 Comment: Silly foul there by Westwood on the edge of the area.\n29:28 Comment: Pedro had already established control of the ball.\n29:31 Comment: He couldn't really nick it in this situation.\n29:33 Comment: Once he knows he can't get it, he can't dive in like that.\n29:36 Comment: Now you've given a free kick away right in the middle of goal.\n29:40 Comment: Gives the opportunity for the kicker, whoever it is, because there's four of them queuing up to go either side of Guzan.\n29:46 Comment: Very difficult for a keeper to get his wall lined up when the ball's in the middle of the goal.\n29:56 Comment: Willian is trying to elbow everybody else out of the way.\n30:2 Comment: Having scored four goals in his last four games from free kicks, who can blame him?\n30:16 Comment: It's Zouma!\n30:19 Comment: He did its job.\n30:23 Comment: In the way by Fabregas.\n30:25 Comment: And then Krilis is knocked to the ground.\n30:28 Comment: Clumsy more than anything by Ramirez, but again good control by Krilis.\n30:32 Comment: Because any...\n30:34 Comment: It's not a midfield player who's just hoofed it up the pitch, but he's looking to run it out.\n30:37 Comment: Poor free kick from Zouma, touched to the side by Willian, fired it straight into the wall.\n30:41 Comment: Didn't even get it off the floor.\n30:43 Comment: Go on, go on, go on, go on, go on!\n30:54 Comment: Krilis has committed his international future to England.\n30:57 Comment: He played for the Republic of Ireland at Ered 21 level.\n31:2 Comment: Aye.\n31:6 Comment: Gostad!\n31:8 Comment: Glorious opportunity for Vela.\n31:9 Comment: What an opening for Rudi Gostad, having been set up by Jordan Ayoub.\n31:14 Comment: Good play by Krilis initially.\n31:15 Comment: Watch this little backflip, Tony, there.\n31:17 Comment: Then Ayoub's release down this left-hand side.\n31:20 Comment: Gets it in, he gets across John Terry.\n31:22 Comment: Find it hard how he's hit that one over the top.\n31:24 Comment: He's come across with the outside of his foot.\n31:26 Comment: Ball's gone over the top.\n31:28 Comment: Surely that's got to go low.\n31:29 Comment: There you go.\n31:30 Comment: Gets in front of Terry.\n31:32 Comment: And he's managed to scoop that one over.\n31:34 Comment: It was a difficult chance, but at least should have been a goal.\n31:37 Comment: It was a difficult chance, but at least should have been on target.\n31:42 Comment: Big chance for Vela.\n31:46 Comment: Talking about those segments, we've gone into over the 30-minute mark now.\n31:50 Comment: Just those 15-minute segments when you're playing the big sides.\n31:53 Comment: Think it's key that you're still in and around that game.\n31:56 Comment: Vela are well in it and have the best chance so far.\n32:0 Comment: Vela without a win in seven games in the Premier League.\n32:3 Comment: Everyone which has seen them produce just one point.\n32:8 Comment: One on the opening day at Bournemouth, a 1-0 success.\n32:25 Comment: In by Willian.\n32:26 Comment: John Terry!\n32:29 Comment: Got the first run.\n32:33 Comment: Got in behind Richard's ear, Tony.\n32:35 Comment: He's a little bit disappointed.\n32:36 Comment: He's got too much on the flick.\n32:38 Comment: He just wanted to help that on his way.\n32:39 Comment: They're not easy headers.\n32:41 Comment: Willian's curling it in.\n32:42 Comment: He's just got to help it on his way, but he gets too much on it.\n32:45 Comment: He's got such a good forwards instinct when he's up there attacking the ball, John,\n32:49 Comment: that he's a little bit choked that he doesn't get that on the target.\n32:51 Comment: 70 years this month since John Terry made his Chelsea debut.\n32:55 Comment: Made it in a League Cup tie against Aston Villa here at Stamford Bridge.\n33:0 Comment: And Luca Biali was the man in charge.\n33:10 Comment: That was dreadful by Guzan.\n33:12 Comment: Willian's got the ball.\n33:13 Comment: He's got the ball.\n33:21 Comment: Willian.\n33:23 Comment: It's a gift for Chelsea.\n33:25 Comment: And a gift for Diego Costa.\n33:28 Comment: Horrible model involving Guzan and Lescott.\n33:32 Comment: And Chelsea got lucky.\n33:33 Comment: Maybe that's the lift that Jose Mourinho and his team need.\n33:39 Comment: Well, when you're really being under pressure as a manager, you don't need this.\n33:44 Comment: You don't need goalkeepers taking stupid risks.\n33:48 Comment: And this is what this is from Guzan.\n33:50 Comment: All the time in the world he puts Lescott under pressure.\n33:53 Comment: Willian nicks it and he's got the presence of mind.\n33:55 Comment: Just a square at the Costa is onside.\n33:58 Comment: And that's a simple tapping.\n33:59 Comment: But what on earth is Guzan doing here?\n34:2 Comment: Pitching it on the half-volley to Lescott.\n34:4 Comment: Okay, control could have been better.\n34:6 Comment: But he has dropped him right in the mire there.\n34:9 Comment: And Willian makes him play.\n34:10 Comment: Yeah, good closing down.\n34:12 Comment: Good presence of mind to set up Costa.\n34:15 Comment: But Guzan, what are you doing?\n34:20 Comment: Just had to stay behind the ball there, Diego Costa.\n34:22 Comment: And he does so and he finishes.\n34:24 Comment: And Chelsea from having a real poor and indifferent start.\n34:28 Comment: A 1-0 head.\n34:30 Comment: When you talk about managers, their lives are in the players' hands.\n34:36 Comment: Well, Guzan's put his manager in it there, hasn't he?\n34:41 Comment: Diego Costa with his second goal of the Premier League season on his return from a three-game suspension.\n34:47 Comment: How will that lift the mood inside Stamford Bridge?\n34:50 Comment: What will it do to Aston Villa's confidence?\n34:55 Comment: The thing as a centre-back, when you've got your back to goal, as Lescott did there, Tony.\n34:59 Comment: When a goalkeeper gives you like that and he's got plenty of time on the ball,\n35:3 Comment: you're assuming there's no-one behind you.\n35:5 Comment: There's no-one pressurising you.\n35:7 Comment: Admittedly, Lescott's control should have maybe been better and at least defended the ball.\n35:12 Comment: But he's just put his centre-half under all kinds of pressure with a forward closing him down at top speed.\n35:20 Comment: And that vital mistake has been made.\n35:22 Comment: And there's not a first time.\n35:24 Comment: It's not the first time it's happened to him this season, either, Tony.\n35:26 Comment: He's made some poor mistakes like that.\n35:28 Comment: Not learning from them.\n35:31 Comment: No need to do it, you're right.\n35:34 Comment: Well, it was significant even in the early stages.\n35:36 Comment: Whenever the ball was heading in the direction of Brad Guzan,\n35:39 Comment: Chelsea were trying to put him under pressure, didn't they?\n35:41 Comment: They tried to put him under pressure, didn't matter if it was Pedro or Loftus-Cheek or Costa.\n35:49 Comment: And now Chelsea have been rewarded when Guzan was under no pressure.\n35:54 Comment: Should have been a straightforward clearance by the Aston Villa goalkeeper.\n36:3 Comment: Villa's good work has gone to waste.\n36:12 Comment: Chelsea! Chelsea!\n36:19 Comment: He's getting his ankles clipped by Pedro.\n36:28 Comment: I'm all for these keepers trying to play the balls out the back, but they do get carried away now.\n36:32 Comment: They really get carried away and ends up as the best form of attack sometimes.\n36:36 Comment: The ball goes back to the keeper, let him have it.\n36:38 Comment: And you just pressurise the players in that back four who's going to give it to you.\n36:45 Comment: Baba.\n37:2 Comment: Pedro, getting away from Hutton, but not Richards.\n37:6 Comment: Chelsea get the free kick.\n37:15 Comment: The actions of Richards and also a moment or two ago,\n37:19 Comment: Jolion Lescott showing Villa's frustration at the moment.\n37:23 Comment: Richards just ran across the path of Pedro there and just blocked his path.\n37:27 Comment: He didn't get a yellow card, I don't think, Tony, but...\n37:31 Comment: The keeper's feeling a little bit of pressure now.\n37:33 Comment: We all know that's his mistake.\n37:37 Comment: It's like the things that happen to you when you're down in and around the bottom,\n37:40 Comment: but they can't happen to you.\n37:46 Comment: Wilkins, the former Chelsea favourite, having a quick word with Jose Mourinho.\n37:56 Comment: What can Willian produce here?\n37:59 Comment: He's gone for goal!\n38:4 Comment: A bit optimistic going for goal from here, this is straight down the throat of Guzan.\n38:28 Comment: Ramirez with the interception.\n38:31 Comment: Stunned challenge by Richards.\n38:34 Comment: Now, Grealish has been brought down by Ramirez.\n38:38 Comment: I think Grealish is pointing out how many times can Ramirez foul me.\n38:41 Comment: He keeps getting the wrong side of him and he keeps clipping him, bringing him down.\n38:44 Comment: Costa's moaning at the other end, but that was a great challenge from Richards,\n38:47 Comment: who's had a real good start to the game.\n39:0 Comment: Gestede with the header on.\n39:2 Comment: Pell.\n39:3 Comment: Now Grealish.\n39:4 Comment: Westwood!\n39:8 Comment: Clip it up to Gestede and get in and around him.\n39:12 Comment: Grealish again does well, he's first to the knockdown.\n39:15 Comment: Holds it up well, little bit of composure, presence of mind, locks it off to Westwood.\n39:19 Comment: Deflection takes a little bit of pace off it for Begovic.\n39:23 Comment: Richardson.\n39:27 Comment: Hayek.\n39:52 Comment: Grealish.\n39:55 Comment: Pell.\n39:56 Comment: Backwards Grealish.\n40:0 Comment: Well played again.\n40:1 Comment: Great signs from Grealish.\n40:3 Comment: This all goes well for England, Tony.\n40:6 Comment: This kid's got ability, one-on-ones.\n40:8 Comment: He's lost Fabregas a couple of times here.\n40:10 Comment: Look, give and go on him, Fabregas doesn't follow.\n40:12 Comment: Then he's confronted by Ramirez and Asperler-Koethe.\n40:15 Comment: Still gets to their ball line, doesn't quite cut it back enough, but had a good first half.\n40:23 Comment: Can't get play for England because FIFA have to ratify his switch,\n40:28 Comment: having featured for the Republic of Ireland under-21s.\n40:31 Comment: He did play for England at junior level, under-16s,\n40:35 Comment: but then decided to side with the Republic of Ireland.\n40:39 Comment: But he is a Brummie, he's a big Aston Villa fan, boyhood fan.\n40:43 Comment: Now he says he wants to commit to England.\n40:52 Comment: Diego Costa.\n40:54 Comment: Asperler-Koethe.\n40:56 Comment: Pedro.\n40:58 Comment: Now Willian.\n41:4 Comment: Well done by Fabregas.\n41:7 Comment: Fabregas again.\n41:14 Comment: Fabregas, one of those who really hasn't been playing for a while.\n41:18 Comment: Fabregas, one of those who really hasn't sparkled so far this season for Chelsea.\n41:25 Comment: No, one who hasn't really fulfilled his potential this season.\n41:29 Comment: Certainly he's a quality player, Fabregas, but had a slow start to this term.\n41:48 Comment: Oh, the keeper's not been nervy, isn't he?\n41:52 Comment: That time Richardson just can't sort his feet out, the keeper.\n41:56 Comment: He's left-footed and sometimes they tend to be putting it back on his right foot.\n41:59 Comment: That doesn't help him, admittedly.\n42:3 Comment: Fabregas.\n42:6 Comment: Asperler-Koethe.\n42:8 Comment: Villa again, stretched.\n42:10 Comment: Fabregas.\n42:14 Comment: Asperler-Koethe.\n42:16 Comment: Villa again, stretched.\n42:25 Comment: It was a bad foul. I think Fabregas is late there, Tony.\n42:28 Comment: I think he may get away with it.\n42:30 Comment: But he's late.\n42:33 Comment: Garner's overstretching into the challenge.\n42:36 Comment: Done him a favour, really. Didn't roll about in agony there.\n42:38 Comment: Gets the challenge and look, he's late.\n42:40 Comment: Normally that's warranted in a yellow card.\n42:45 Comment: Oh, here we go again.\n42:47 Comment: Wayward again by Richardson.\n42:49 Comment: It's Diego Costa.\n42:51 Comment: Costa goes down.\n42:53 Comment: Chelsea look for a penalty.\n42:55 Comment: And it's a goal kick.\n42:57 Comment: They thought the referee was pointing, didn't they?\n42:59 Comment: But again Villa causing themselves problems.\n43:2 Comment: Wasn't a keeper this time, Richardson dropped Lescott's short.\n43:5 Comment: Costa intervened. I think the referee's got it right.\n43:8 Comment: Look, there's Richardson there.\n43:10 Comment: Is there a collision?\n43:13 Comment: No, not for me. He dragged his leg slightly there, Costa.\n43:16 Comment: But there was no collision.\n43:20 Comment: Just wonder what Jorge Mourinho will make of that one.\n43:31 Comment: It's said in the past that referees have turned a blind eye\n43:36 Comment: to Chelsea's penalty appeals.\n43:42 Comment: It's a penalty.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Chelsea get the second half underway, having made a change

the heights this season\n0:43 Comment: there's a man who hasn't touched the heights in his start, Babba's had a poor game so far unfortunately for him\n0:51 Comment: Grealish taking on Afolakweta\n0:56 Comment: not sure if that was shot or cross\n0:59 Comment: I tell you what, it was a shot\n1:0 Comment: Afolakweta is one of the best one on one defenders around, look and Grealish faces him up, I like this kid, he's terrific\n1:6 Comment: no fear, I'm going to have a go at him, when am I going to go, right or left, I want to get my shot away\n1:10 Comment: I come right and he does get his shot away, it's wide of the post but again he's trying for it\n1:14 Comment: and as I said before Afolakweta is great at blocking shots, getting close and stopping people getting shots and crosses in\n1:22 Comment: and he gets his away\n1:30 Comment: Fabregas, Diego Costa, caught again by Ramirez\n1:43 Comment: Patten giving a nudge in the back, Fabregas showing his irritation\n1:56

going to be a card for Ayo\n3:6 Comment: well that's been no worse than some of the ones that Ramirez made in that first half\n3:15 Comment: as you can see he clips in with his other foot rather than trying to scoop it round\n3:19 Comment: the fact that it was right next to Jose Mourinho and the arms were aloft\n3:23 Comment: may have helped the fact that he gets a yellow card\n3:26 Comment: but he's got to be careful\n3:26 Comment: I don't think there's any worse than the ones Ramirez has been making Tony\n3:30 Comment: but the fact that he gets a yellow card rather than trying to scoop it round\n3:38 Comment: the fact that it was right next to Jose Mourinho and the arms were aloft\n3:42 Comment: well done by Ramirez\n3:46 Comment: I think it's any worse than the ones Ramirez has been

    "summary": "On a cool, crisp afternoon at Stamford Bridge, defending champions Chelsea took on Aston Villa in a pivotal clash within the English Premier League. This narrative captures the significant moments and unfolding drama of a match that saw Chelsea emerge victorious with a 2-0 win over a beleaguered Aston Villa side.\n\nThe story began well before the referee's whistle. Chelsea found themselves unusually low in the league table, languishing just four points above the relegation zone after eight games. The atmosphere was tense around the stadium, with fans nervous about their team's uninspiring start to the season. Aston Villa’s situation was no better as they hovered in the relegation zone with dismal performances and only one win since their opening day triumph over Bournemouth.\n\nAs the match commenced, the build-up to the game was palpable. Stamford Bridge was buzzing, with both sets of fans cheering and willing their teams to gain some much-needed points. Chelsea supporters particularly rallied behind their under-pressure manager Jose Mourinho, who had recently been embroiled in controversy following comments that led to a substantial fine and a suspended stadium ban.\n\nMourinho made five changes to his lineup, notably benching Eden Hazard, last season's Premier League Player of the Year. Instead, he opted to give Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Baba Rahman opportunities to shine. For Aston Villa, Tim Sherwood made four changes, hoping this refreshed roster could produce a better outcome.\n\nThe game got underway with Chelsea adopting a cautious yet assertive approach. The opening exchanges saw the Blues controlling possession but unable to break through Villa’s defensive shape. Loftus-Cheek attempted to initiate several attacks, but his passes often lacked precision. The youngster seemed determined to make the most of his chance, yet the absence of Hazard’s creativity was noticeable.\n\nVilla, on the other hand, looked to exploit any opportunity on the counterattack. Grealish was particularly dynamic, continuously taking on Chelsea defenders and winning free kicks in dangerous areas. Despite Grealish’s efforts, Villa struggled to produce clear-cut chances, and their final ball often let them down.\n\nChelsea’s midfield, orchestrated by Cesc Fabregas and supported by Ramirez, tried to probe for weaknesses in Villa’s resolute defense. Fabregas made his 100th appearance for Spain just a week before and, today, seemed intent on demonstrating his finesse and vision. However, much like the rest of his team’s initial attempts, his efforts often lacked the sharpness needed to penetrate Villa’s defensive lines.\n\nThe breakthrough came for Chelsea just before halftime, a moment born out of a catastrophic defensive error from Aston Villa. Brad Guzan, Villa's goalkeeper, played a risky short pass to Joleon Lescott, who failed to control it under pressure from Willian. The Brazilian winger promptly seized upon the mistake, squared the ball to Diego Costa, who had no trouble slotting it home from close range. The goal was a much-needed lift for Chelsea, allowing them to head into the break with a narrow 1-0 lead.\n\nThe second half saw Mourinho make a tactical adjustment, withdrawing Loftus-Cheek for the experienced Nemanja Matic. This change seemed to offer Chelsea more control and stability in midfield. Villa continued to show resilience and Grealish remained their most potent threat, often trying to engineer something on his own against a well-drilled Chelsea defense.\n\nChelsea doubled their lead in the 54th minute, albeit through an element of fortune. A move that began on the right saw Willian advance and deliver a ball intended for Costa. The ball, however, deflected off Alan Hutton and nestled into the back of Guzan’s net for an own goal. This misfortune further disheartened Villa, who looked increasingly vulnerable.\n\nWith a two-goal cushion, Chelsea played more freely, but Villa had their moments too. Grealish’s tenacity was on full display as he continued to challenge Chelsea’s defenders, though his final attempts often lacked the necessary precision or were well-handled by the experienced duo of John Terry and Kurt Zouma.\n\nThroughout the latter stages of the match, Chelsea controlled the tempo, with Fabregas pulling the strings from midfield. There were flashes of the team that had dominated the Premier League last season, but it was clear there was still work to be done. Costa remained a physical presence up front, constantly pressuring Villa's backline and keeping them on their toes.\n\nVilla introduced Jordan Amavi in place of Kieran Richardson, aiming to inject some fresh legs and attacking intent from the left-back position. There were spells where Villa threatened, and Ayew had a decent chance, but every opportunity seemed to falter at the crucial moment, either through poor execution or solid defending.\n\nChelsea made their intent clear by bringing on Eden Hazard in the final ten minutes. The magic and flair Hazard possessed were immediately apparent, as he dribbled past defenders, creating spaces and opportunities. However, the Belgian's introduction wasn’t enough for Chelsea to add to their tally. Guzan redeemed himself with a couple of crucial saves to prevent the scoreline from becoming more lopsided.\n\nWillian, whose energy and vision had proven essential throughout the game, received an ovation as he was substituted for Ola Aina in the dying moments of the match. Stalwart performances from the likes of Azpilicueta, who was formidable in his defensive duties, ensured Chelsea kept their clean sheet intact.\n\nThe final whistle blew with Chelsea securing a 2-0 victory, a result that provided much-needed relief for Mourinho and the Chelsea faithful. It wasn’t a perfect performance by any means, and the struggles of the early season were still evident. However, the win was a step in the right direction, and it allowed Chelsea to climb the Premier League table, albeit incrementally.\n\nFor Aston Villa, it was another painful chapter in what had been a challenging season. Despite moments of promise and individual brilliance from players like Grealish, the team’s inability to convert chances and defensive lapses cost them dearly. Sherwood’s side left Stamford Bridge without a point and remained mired in the relegation zone.\n\nIn conclusion, Chelsea’s 2-0 triumph over Aston Villa was a blend of tactical adjustments, individual errors, and moments of brilliance. It exemplified the unpredictable nature of football and highlighted the complexities both teams faced in trying to climb out of their respective early-season slumps. While Chelsea celebrated a scrappy yet important victory, Villa was left to ponder what might have been and hope for better fortunes in the matches to come."
