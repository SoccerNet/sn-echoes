against West Bromwich Albion last week.\n6:14 Comment: But as he said after the game, Newcastle have got to play like that every game.\n6:17 Comment: Newcastle have got to play like that every week now.\n6:19 Comment: And they've had the worst possible start today.\n6:26 Comment: What they don't want to do here is react by going and chasing the game.\n6:29 Comment: Trying to force it.\n6:31 Comment: They've got to make sure they stay compact.\n6:33 Comment: Don't lose another one in the next five, ten minutes.\n6:38 Comment: It's Teote.\n6:39 Comment: That's a Colaccini.\n6:43 Comment: Taylor.\n6:44 Comment: He made his first appearance since August.\n6:46 Comment: In the match against West Brom last week.\n6:52 Comment: To be fair to Steve McLaren, he's had a horrendous injury list of late.\n7:1 Comment: Townsend.\n7:3 Comment: And he wants the return ball.\n7:7 Comment: He had the forward that he wanted it, but he still gets his cross in.\n7:11 Comment: Just couldn't quite get the height.\n7:12 Comment: Newcastle had decent support, had it come in.\n7:14 Comment: They are three in the box.\n7:16 Comment: They're not going to be able to get it in.\n7:17 Comment: I think Townsend in particular will enjoy playing with Jonjo Shelby,\n7:20 Comment: who switches the play so quickly into either wide area.\n7:24 Comment: Those two January signings have certainly hit the ground running for Newcastle.\n7:28 Comment: They'll get a free kick now themselves.\n7:42 Comment: Shelby will take this.\n7:46 Comment: We'll see what happens.\n7:47 Comment: They'll take this.\n7:48 Comment: They're getting a free kick.\n7:49 Comment: They're going to get a free kick.\n7:52 Comment: They'll get a free kick.\n7:53 Comment: They're going to get a free kick.\n7:56 Comment: And the two centre-backs, Colaccini and Taylor, just ahead of him.\n8:4 Comment: All depends on the delivery here from Jonjo Shelby.\n8:10 Comment: That wasn't good.\n8:11 Comment: Easily cleared by Fabregas at the near post.\n8:16 Comment: A free kick there, and a terrible mistake has given Newcastle real problems again,\n8:22 Comment: and given Chelsea a second goal in the space of three minutes.\n8:26 Comment: Enro the scorer.\n8:30 Comment: That young Rolando Ahrens doesn't have to be told.\n8:34 Comment: Slap-square passes very often put you in trouble,\n8:37 Comment: and never more so than in this case here.\n8:39 Comment: I think it's Jan-Marty who tries to find...\n8:42 Comment: Doesn't have to go square here.\n8:45 Comment: Looked as if there might be a break-on, Newcastle get the ball back.\n8:49 Comment: So many options, and chooses the wrong one.\n8:52 Comment: To be fair, it's a terrific finish.\n8:56 Comment: To be 2-0 down after nine minutes is not what Steve McClane was looking for here.\n9:2 Comment: Beautiful finish from Pedro with the inside of his foot.\n9:6 Comment: And Aaron Ahrens knows...\n9:10 Comment: ..he won't have to be told.\n9:12 Comment: He's got the ball, he's got the ball, he's got the ball.\n9:15 Comment: The Spanish international has scored for almost the second time\n9:19 Comment: in his last 22 appearances for Chelsea.\n9:24 Comment: And Newcastle already facing a massive problem.\n9:27 Comment: Can they get one back here? Well, there's a chance.\n9:30 Comment: They've already whistled so much.\n9:34 Comment: Good example, though, of what the two Chelsea centre-backs are going to be up against today\n9:38 Comment: when Newcastle want to miss the midfield up...\n9:41 Comment: ..miss the midfield out.\n9:42 Comment: And they've got the ball on, Mitrovic offers them a terrific target.\n9:49 Comment: They were saying the first 20 minutes would be crucial.\n9:52 Comment: How right he was.\n9:54 Comment: We didn't expect it to be crucial in this manner.\n9:57 Comment: And Willian takes Chelsea forward again here.\n10:0 Comment: A lay-off by Costa.\n10:3 Comment: Sissoko...\n10:5 Comment: ..extremely furious with his team-mates.\n10:12 Comment: N'Oldum...\n10:15 Comment: ..takes Townsend...\n10:18 Comment: ..behind Jovanovic.\n10:23 Comment: Three targets in the middle and then picks out Shelby.\n10:26 Comment: Reflection for a corner.\n10:28 Comment: Fabregas did well, saw the danger and got himself out very quickly to the ball.\n10:34 Comment: Good set-up here from Townsend, good first touch from Shelby as well.\n10:39 Comment: Fabregas in his face.\n10:42 Comment: Lishley relieves Charles D dah diameter and the festering fertigum where it's over.\n10:45 Comment: Holds a nice free pass.\n10:49 Comment: N'Oldum, still almost two yards\n11:9 Comment: Good support fromaker.\n11:10 Comment: and he scored six away goals this season you can see it is in fact the worst\n11:17 Comment: record in all four divisions what they are doing is putting so much pressure on\n11:22 Comment: themselves at home got to stop picking up some points and on the road\n11:40 Comment: it was just four minutes between the two Chelsea goals\n11:59 Comment: there's connoche any shelving\n12:8 Comment: which down the middle\n12:10 Comment: and decides to switch it to Sissoko on the right\n12:12 Comment: Jan Narch can't keep possession\n12:15 Comment: Giotte\n12:17 Comment: shelving\n12:19 Comment: here's Taylor\n12:20 Comment: Colaccini\n12:26 Comment: makes a change for Chelsea to find themselves in this position they've\n12:32 Comment: drawn each of their last four home games\n12:35 Comment: Taylor\n12:39 Comment: Sissoko\n12:40 Comment: Mitrovic with the layup\n12:42 Comment: tojuan Aldem\n12:46 Comment: Willian\n12:56 Comment: well still unbeaten after 11 games and remarkably he's lost just once in 32\n13:1 Comment: games in all competitions Chelsea Interim\n13:6 Comment: Group 6\n13:8 Comment: as a Chelsea interim manager.\n13:14 Comment: Couldn't have wished for a better start today.\n13:20 Comment: Hazard.\n13:24 Comment: Pedro.\n13:29 Comment: Not doing well to win it back.\n13:32 Comment: Looked upfield, it was only Mitrovic for the target.\n13:36 Comment: Here's Fabregas.\n13:38 Comment: Hazard.\n13:42 Comment: Two Newcastle men going for the same ball there,\n13:44 Comment: but in the end, it's Townsend who comes out.\n13:48 Comment: Taking the wrong option.\n13:50 Comment: Aronson made a really good offer on the outside there.\n13:54 Comment: Really a winger, of course,\n13:55 Comment: but he's been forced into the unfamiliar left-back role\n13:58 Comment: in the last couple of games after injury to Paul Dumit.\n14:8 Comment: A full credit to those travelling Newcastle fans\n14:12 Comment: still making plenty of noise behind the goal.\n14:16 Comment: I've just seen Chelsea score twice.\n14:26 Comment: It's only consolation to those Geordies.\n14:29 Comment: Chelsea have dropped more home points this season\n14:31 Comment: after taking the lead than any other team in the Premier League.\n14:34 Comment: APPLAUSE\n14:38 Comment: They come again with Costa.\n14:44 Comment: Aronson across on the cover.\n14:50 Comment: Shelby.\n14:53 Comment: Colaccini.\n14:55 Comment: Taylor.\n15:2 Comment: Cahill wins the head-up.\n15:4 Comment: Shelby.\n15:6 Comment: Sissoko.\n15:11 Comment: Naught.\n15:14 Comment: Cross-block by Asker Ikweta.\n15:21 Comment: Naught.\n15:23 Comment: Sissoko.\n15:25 Comment: Townsend.\n15:28 Comment: Clever feet by him.\n15:30 Comment: Sissoko.\n15:32 Comment: Terry deals with the cross.\n15:35 Comment: Townsend.\n15:38 Comment: Taylor.\n15:48 Comment: It's maybe a bit of a surprise, Newcastle seeing more of the ball.\n15:52 Comment: Could be that they've reacted far too late.\n15:55 Comment: They have so much to do now at 2-0.\n16:1 Comment: They can't afford to give the ball away again in that kind of position.\n16:4 Comment: Costa up against Colaccini here.\n16:6 Comment: And support arriving from Willian, amongst others.\n16:9 Comment: It's Willian who picks it up, and it's Willian who scores!\n16:13 Comment: A superb breakaway goal, Chelsea three up,\n16:17 Comment: not even 17 minutes on the clock.\n16:20 Comment: Diego Costa so unselfish.\n16:23 Comment: It's a great supporting run from Willian.\n16:26 Comment: When the ball is played into the channel,\n16:29 Comment: it's immediately obvious that Costa's quicker than Colaccini.\n16:33 Comment: Takes a yard out the centre back there to get possession,\n16:36 Comment: needs a bit of help here,\n16:38 Comment: and it arrives from Willian.\n16:42 Comment: Terrific start from Chelsea,\n16:44 Comment: and Diego Costa, who we talked about before the game,\n16:48 Comment: getting right up to speed now.\n16:55 Comment: Colaccini thinks he's gotten where he wants him,\n16:58 Comment: but Willian made a beautiful angle for him.\n17:3 Comment: One assist and one goal for Willian already.\n17:6 Comment: That takes him on to nine goals for the season.\n17:8 Comment: Only Costa himself has scored more for Chelsea.\n17:16 Comment: Well, the phrase uphill battle does not do justice\n17:19 Comment: to the task facing Newcastle now.\n17:23 Comment: Sissoko.\n17:27 Comment: Pedro with the lay-off.\n17:29 Comment: Looking to get it back.\n17:31 Comment: Tall lay-off.\n17:33 Comment: This time by Costa.\n17:36 Comment: Diote.\n17:37 Comment: Sissoko.\n17:39 Comment: Shelby.\n17:45 Comment: Still Shelby.\n17:50 Comment: And still.\n17:55 Comment: Young-Nard.\n17:57 Comment: Cleared by Azpilicueta.\n18:0 Comment: Unlucky there for Costa.\n18:2 Comment: It's come to him anyway.\n18:4 Comment: And holed down quite deliberately by Steven Taylor.\n18:8 Comment: He'll be lucky to escape a car for that.\n18:10 Comment: He's not escaped it.\n18:11 Comment: Yellow.\n18:12 Comment: He knew he was in trouble, Steven Taylor.\n18:14 Comment: Costa got his body across the front of the centre back.\n18:17 Comment: He was always likely to win the race,\n18:19 Comment: had even the right to continue it.\n18:27 Comment: He was the one who said last week that in their position in the league table,\n18:31 Comment: Newcastle needed bags of character.\n18:33 Comment: They certainly need it now.\n18:40 Comment: Sissoko.\n18:42 Comment: Young-Nard.\n18:45 Comment: Matic.\n18:51 Comment: Fabregas.\n18:52 Comment: Willian.\n18:58 Comment: Good average for Chelsea.\n18:59 Comment: Four attempts on goal.\n19:0 Comment: It's only on target.\n19:4 Comment: Now in the driving seat here.\n19:6 Comment: It's a case of stick or twist now for Steve McClung.\n19:9 Comment: If Newcastle go and chase this, they could take a real hiding.\n19:14 Comment: He wouldn't want to be in his position.\n19:17 Comment: Or theirs.\n19:26 Comment: Azpilicueta.\n19:28 Comment: Aguilar.\n19:30 Comment: Pedro.\n19:32 Comment: Fabregas.\n19:42 Comment: And this, remember, is a Newcastle side that has only managed two wins on the road all season.\n19:47 Comment: Only the modern club Aston Villa have a worse away record than they have.\n19:54 Comment: Fabregas.\n19:56 Comment: Pedro.\n19:58 Comment: too much on that for Willian\n20:0 Comment: again it was a slack header there from\n20:2 Comment: John Joe Shelby who normally looks after the ball\n20:4 Comment: really well but who gave it\n20:6 Comment: away and that's been\n20:8 Comment: a problem so far giving the ball away\n20:10 Comment: in areas that are liable to hurt you\n20:13 Comment: I don't know if you've ever been in this kind of position\n20:18 Comment: in your career as a player Davey but\n20:20 Comment: it must be very easy to get\n20:22 Comment: down hearted and resign\n20:24 Comment: to defeat even at this stage\n20:26 Comment: the reaction is to go and try and force\n20:28 Comment: the game and chase the game to get back into it\n20:30 Comment: which fairly often is the wrong\n20:32 Comment: thing to do\n20:45 Comment: Aaron\n20:46 Comment: there's Connachini\n20:50 Comment: Taylor\n20:56 Comment: and that's short as well\n20:58 Comment: much of what Stephen Taylor is\n21:3 Comment: protesting about here he was so light\n21:4 Comment: with the pass back\n21:5 Comment: put Morvell in all sorts of trouble\n21:15 Comment: and\n21:16 Comment: I've got plenty of time when he gets it here Stephen Taylor\n21:19 Comment: which I'm happy with the challenge in the keeper\n21:26 Comment: They really are shooting themselves in the foot at the moment.\n21:41 Comment: Well, let's go down to our touchline reporter, Jeff Shreves, for a moment.\n21:46 Comment: Alan, it looks like a bit of a problem\n21:48 Comment: between John Terry and Alexander Mitrovic.\n21:50 Comment: There was a challenge just now which left John Terry hobbling.\n21:53 Comment: It looked like there might have been a little bit of afters as well.\n21:56 Comment: Words were spoken and they've just gone nose to nose\n21:58 Comment: for a little chat, shall we say.\n22:2 Comment: He doesn't shy off Mitrovic.\n22:6 Comment: A bit like Diego Costa in that regard.\n22:8 Comment: He's quite happy to face Conor against centre-backs.\n22:12 Comment: He really walks away.\n22:14 Comment: I said he loves a physical challenge\n22:16 Comment: and we've just seen evidence of that.\n22:18 Comment: He's got to be careful, though.\n22:22 Comment: Baylor came with a reputation for being fiery.\n22:26 Comment: Even before he made his first appearance for Newcastle.\n22:29 Comment: But to be fair to him, he's kept out of the referee's notebook\n22:32 Comment: for quite some time now, over a dozen games, in fact.\n22:36 Comment: He put a poor start in that respect.\n22:40 Comment: Will he add?\n22:44 Comment: Jan Nog.\n22:47 Comment: He's not even got scraps to feed off at the moment, Mitrovic.\n22:50 Comment: No wonder he's getting frustrated.\n22:53 Comment: Cahill.\n22:55 Comment: Ivanovic.\n22:56 Comment: Good skill.\n22:59 Comment: And then he gives it away to Townsend.\n23:6 Comment: Townsend's gone for the return here.\n23:26 Comment: Cahill.\n23:34 Comment: Marenz.\n23:37 Comment: Guilherte finds Shelby.\n23:41 Comment: Taylor.\n23:45 Comment: Sissoko.\n23:52 Comment: Dwelling on the ball, but he's got away with it.\n23:54 Comment: Palacini.\n23:54 Comment: James Taylor\n23:59 Comment: Mitrovic the target it's all too easy at the moment for misses Terry and Cahill\n24:6 Comment: William\n24:8 Comment: Fabregas\n24:11 Comment: Hazard\n24:16 Comment: William\n24:19 Comment: here's Pedro\n24:24 Comment: that's Piediqueta with a lovely ball for Pedro and a chance for two Chelsea players to find the net again it was Ivanovic who took the shot in the end blocked for a corner\n24:37 Comment: I think it's too haughty that Pedro runs off here makes the run in behind nobody matching that run he's onside\n24:43 Comment: he picks the right ball I think across the six yard box nobody's getting there\n24:48 Comment: Newcastle managed to get a block on\n24:52 Comment: I guess this is the end of the game\n24:54 Comment: it does not look good with a quarter of the game gone\n24:56 Comment: there were so many gaps there\n25:1 Comment: I did say before the game Steve McClann mentioned the importance of looking after the ball they've done anything but\n25:12 Comment: Piediqueta heads back in\n25:13 Comment: now off the line by Teota as far as Shelby\n25:16 Comment: good early ball finds Townsend\n25:22 Comment: good idea\n25:23 Comment: trying to get Wijnaldum in with the early ball in behind\n25:38 Comment: not a touch\n25:40 Comment: not really managed to get close to Mitrovic and Mitrovic to be fair has very few chances to protect the ball when it's been played up he's heavily outnumbered up there\n25:49 Comment: Piediqueta heads back in\n25:51 Comment: and a good chance of getting the ball in\n25:53 Comment: I mentioned before kick off that only goal difference was keeping Newcastle out of the bottom three\n25:58 Comment: well of course this scoreline makes that even worse for them\n26:3 Comment: Piediqueta heads back in\n26:5 Comment: and a good chance of getting the ball in\n26:7 Comment: Shelby\n26:8 Comment: and a good chance of getting the ball in\n26:9 Comment: there's Colaccini\n26:10 Comment: Piediqueta heads back in\n26:11 Comment: Ahrens\n26:12 Comment: Piediqueta heads back in\n26:13 Comment: Townsend\n26:16 Comment: Piediqueta heads back in\n26:17 Comment: Townsend\n26:18 Comment: Piediqueta heads back in\n26:19 Comment: Townsend\n26:29 Comment: Hazard\n26:30 Comment: clever little flick of Willian\n26:32 Comment: Ivanovic\n26:33 Comment: and back in he goes again into a dangerous area\n26:36 Comment: Diego Costa was in a great position then at the far post\n26:39 Comment: and unmarked again\n26:40 Comment: Thioti did well just to stop the cross\n26:43 Comment: Newcastle shot at the back there had it come across the face\n26:47 Comment: all hands on deck here at the moment for Newcastle\n26:48 Comment: at the moment for Newcastle.\n26:52 Comment: Chelsea finding gas with alarming regularity\n26:55 Comment: and running off the ball has been outstanding, hasn't it?\n26:59 Comment: Newcastle just so open in midfield and, you know...\n27:4 Comment: Steve McClarn must have thought about getting Jack Cole\n27:7 Comment: back into the centre of midfield beside Shelby and Tioti.\n27:14 Comment: He's been injured for a while.\n27:16 Comment: There was a thought that he might be used at left-back today.\n27:20 Comment: Here's Tioti.\n27:23 Comment: Jan-Marc.\n27:25 Comment: Shelby.\n27:27 Comment: Now Taylor.\n27:30 Comment: Colaccini.\n27:38 Comment: No good options for him.\n27:42 Comment: Taylor.\n27:46 Comment: No good options for him.\n27:50 Comment: It's all neat and tidy from Newcastle,\n27:51 Comment: but it's not really getting them anywhere.\n27:53 Comment: Chelsea taking a rest here.\n27:57 Comment: Tioti.\n28:6 Comment: Well, Tioti and Shelby are the ones\n28:8 Comment: who are doing the donkey share of the work here.\n28:11 Comment: Yeah.\n28:13 Comment: I've never tried to tell Steve McClarn how to do his job,\n28:16 Comment: but...\n28:16 Comment: If they're not to be overrun,\n28:18 Comment: if they can get Cole back on, have a central three,\n28:20 Comment: it would probably mean taking Wijnaldum off.\n28:24 Comment: But he's not really been in it.\n28:26 Comment: And he has been out of form of late anyway,\n28:29 Comment: leading scorer.\n28:34 Comment: Shelby.\n28:36 Comment: Tioti, who had a goal chalked off last week.\n28:39 Comment: It would have been a sensational goal had it stood.\n28:44 Comment: Sissoko now gives it away.\n28:46 Comment: Oh, yeah.\n28:47 Comment: With the early ball for Costa.\n28:49 Comment: This time, Cotaccini gets ahead of him.\n28:56 Comment: What a touch there from Fabregas.\n28:59 Comment: I'd love that.\n29:1 Comment: I can't afford to put on the style at the moment.\n29:4 Comment: Chelsea.\n29:5 Comment: Not yet half an hour gone.\n29:7 Comment: Three goals still good.\n29:8 Comment: Come on!\n29:10 Comment: Fabregas.\n29:16 Comment: Willian.\n29:21 Comment: There's Matic.\n29:27 Comment: Pedro finds Hazard.\n29:29 Comment: Then the return ball.\n29:30 Comment: Those two enjoying a good understanding here.\n29:35 Comment: Fabregas edge of the box.\n29:37 Comment: Well, he wanted that.\n29:38 Comment: Pedro got in his way.\n29:39 Comment: He distracted.\n29:42 Comment: Newcastle just

League.\n32:27 Comment: That's a worrying factor.\n32:28 Comment: Their way forward in particular really has let them down.\n32:32 Comment: It gives them so much to do at St James' Park.\n32:36 Comment: And they don't seem able to follow\n32:40 Comment: with one good performance with another.\n32:44 Comment: Really up and down and inconsistent.\n32:48 Comment: He's not even jumping there,

Comment: And as you've seen, taken quite a few himself.\n34:21 Comment: I mean, when you see Chelsea playing like this, Davey,\n34:24 Comment: it's even more mysterious that they started the season so badly.\n34:28 Comment: We kept waiting for them to put a winning run together.\n34:31 Comment: It never materialised.\n34:32 Comment: It hasn't.\n34:33 Comment: It hasn't materialised.\n34:34 Comment: And given the individual talent they have,\n34:36 Comment: I think we're all left scratching our heads.\n34:43 Comment: Janmaat did well to reach that.\n34:44 Comment: And a good pullback.\n34:47 Comment: Should really have been a goal back there.\n34:50 Comment: And Wijnaldum knows it.\n34:51 Comment: Great set-up from Janmaat.\n34:53 Comment: Looked as if this might get away from him.\n34:57

fourth for Chelsea.\n36:28 Comment: Newcastle light in the central area again,\n36:30 Comment: Colaccini has to go to the ball there,\n36:33 Comment: he knows he's gonna be taken out by the

even so it's another disruption to the back four.\n37:37 Comment: That's Pellegueta who can play either side.\n37:42 Comment: Ivanovic no stranger to the centre-back role.\n37:47 Comment: Valarman has

frustrated.\n39:23 Comment: He might be unlucky there.\n39:25 Comment: He wasn't prepared to give it up.\n39:29 Comment: He said nothing to work with the striker.\n39:32 Comment: I can understand why he's frustrated.\n39:40 Comment: Willian.\n39:42 Comment: Well, cleverly done.\n39:44 Comment: And that's a very good lay-off, though.\n39:48 Comment: Seems to get that one wrong.\n39:53 Comment:

more games than Newcastle\n0:55 Comment: and that disastrous first half performance by Steve McLaren's team\n1:0 Comment: has seen them drop now into the relegation places at the moment on goal difference.\n1:7 Comment: Newcastle have spent heavily in an attempt to preserve their place in the Premier League.\n1:12 Comment: Reportedly around £45 million in the summer,\n1:15 Comment: another £30 million in January, more than any other club in Europe.\n1:19 Comment: So, no lack of investment, Dave.\n1:22 Comment: No, I think Steve McLaren has acknowledged that.\n1:24 Comment: He's had terrific support from the owner.\n1:29 Comment: Hazard for Chelsea.\n1:33 Comment: Beautifully done by him.\n1:36 Comment: And Villarroel has got the ball caught between his feet there.\n1:41 Comment: Back here by Rahmon, who's not required.\n1:44 Comment: Mitrovic.\n1:46 Comment: The overlapping young man.\n1:49 Comment: Sissoko.\n1:50 Comment: Nobody in the box.\n1:52 Comment: Here's Mitrovic, though.\n1:54 Comment: The winner against West Brom last week.\n1:56 Comment: Back to Sissoko, it's a decent ball.\n1:58 Comment: And that's Pellequeta, couldn't take any chances there,\n2:1 Comment: didn't really know what was behind him.\n2:3 Comment: It's a really good ball in, Andros Townsend,\n2:5 Comment: I think we'll feel like he'd gambled there, he might have got across the front.\n2:8 Comment: A pass to Pellequeta.\n2:11 Comment: Mitrovic caught down there at the back of the left Achilles.\n2:18 Comment: And that's Plumsey, at best, from Fabregas.\n2:23 Comment: He does have that in him at times, doesn't he, Cesc Fabregas?\n2:27 Comment: He can be as spiky as any.\n2:30 Comment: And he's left Mitrovic in real pain here.\n2:36 Comment: Difficult one for the referee to spot,\n2:38 Comment: otherwise Cesc Fabregas would have been in a bit.\n2:43 Comment: As if things weren't bad enough for Steve McLaren.\n2:46 Comment: He's got his main striker in trouble.\n2:51 Comment: Newcastle, tidy build-up, nobody in the box,\n2:53 Comment: but this is a terrific ball in.\n2:55 Comment: Townsend at the back post, I don't think he can be found from wide right,\n2:59 Comment: I think he's got to try and get himself across the front of Pellequeta.\n3:3 Comment: And this is really painful for Mitrovic.\n3:8 Comment: I had the referee spotted that, every chance he's given a penalty,\n3:11 Comment: it's on the line which counts as in.\n3:16 Comment: It's a moment of controversy here, at the start of the second half.\n3:22 Comment: Matariste yet to produce a card.\n3:26 Comment: I presume he's waiting to see how Mitrovic recovers, if he recovers.\n3:34 Comment: He's holding his knee as well now.\n3:38 Comment: He looks in real trouble.\n3:39 Comment: He's going to have to go off the field for the resulting corner.\n3:44 Comment: Don't think he would take a chance with him, it's 3-0 down.\n3:48 Comment: If you had a goal down, you would try and get him to continue.\n3:51 Comment: 3-0 down, you're very tempted to get Riviere on you.\n4:3 Comment: And he's kicked away.\n4:5 Comment: Another corner. Great delivery from Shelby.\n4:17 Comment: There was no card for Fabregas.\n4:27 Comment: Looking towards Taylor, Shelby.\n4:35 Comment: Huge clearance.\n4:39 Comment: And Chelsea pick up the second ball.\n4:45 Comment: Too many cooks in all that there. Costa and Willian not on the same wavelength.\n4:57 Comment: He's back on the field. Mitrovic.\n5:0 Comment: Ahrens.\n5:2 Comment: Sissoko.\n5:5 Comment: And there's four away games in a row, Newcastle.\n5:12 Comment: And it will take a miracle to rescue this one.\n5:15 Comment: I think it's a way to play that will really disappoint Steve McClennan.\n5:18 Comment: After a terrific performance against West Brom.\n5:21 Comment: Barely recognisable today.\n5:27 Comment: It's Keir Hardie.\n5:28 Comment: And it's a goal.\n5:35 Comment: And then switching over to the right for the moment.\n5:39 Comment: Teote.\n5:41 Comment: Taylor.\n5:49 Comment: And John Joe Shelby.\n5:53 Comment: Ahrens.\n5:54 Comment: Sissoko making an early run to make himself available.\n5:57 Comment: Here he is.\n5:59 Comment: Shelby.\n6:2 Comment: Fullback.\n6:4 Comment: Townsend.\n6:5 Comment: This looks promising for Newcastle.\n6:10 Comment: And another good cross as well. Shelby couldn't get anything on it.\n6:14 Comment: And it was deflected behind for a corner.\n6:16 Comment: Terrific block by Gary Cahill at the front post.\n6:18 Comment: Townsend did brilliantly.\n6:20 Comment: To deliver. Looked as if he was being squeezed out.\n6:22 Comment: Got a great ball in and Gary Cahill at full stretch did so well.\n6:29 Comment: Along the ground too, Shelby, this time.\n6:36 Comment: Teote.\n6:38 Comment: Much better this from Newcastle.\n6:41 Comment: Sissoko.\n6:43 Comment: And that is Paul.\n6:44 Comment: And so was the attempted clearance there by Cahill.\n6:48 Comment: Newcastle claiming a deliberate backpass. I don't think so.\n6:52 Comment: It's Cahill's first start, incidentally, in the Premier League since Boxing Day.\n7:11 Comment: They're claiming a free kick that hasn't been given.\n7:13 Comment: Ahrens. That looked short. He gave Elliot a lot to do.\n7:23 Comment: Offside!

Why not?\n14:19 Comment: Less than an hour on the clock.\n14:21 Comment: He can save himself for the battle against PSG in the Champions League on Tuesday.\n14:29 Comment: And of course that gives an opportunity for one of the fringe players, if I can call him that.\n14:35 Comment: Bertrand Traore making his second Premier League appearance, the 20 year old.\n14:44 Comment: This season that is.\n14:47 Comment: Here's Fabregas.\n14:52 Comment: Pedro.\n14:55 Comment: Mourinho.\n15:0 Comment: It should be a walk in the park now for Chelsea.\n15:4 Comment: They've made a slight improvement in the early stages of this second half.\n15:9 Comment: That fourth goal will surely, surely finish them off completely.\n15:22 Comment: Willian.\n15:23 Comment: It's a horrible phrase, damage limitation, isn't it?\n15:27 Comment: As John Jo Shelby's anger and frustration gets the better of him.\n15:31 Comment: That's all it is.\n15:38 Comment: He hasn't really had a chance to influence the game, John Jo Shelby.\n15:43 Comment: He might be fortunate that was just a yellow.\n15:47 Comment: Unless he was known for one or two silly challenges in his swans.\n15:53 Comment: He does remember Gary Monk.\n15:55 Comment: The word about that.\n15:58 Comment: They've got to keep their discipline now in Newcastle.\n16:3 Comment: Let play go on here.\n16:5 Comment: And that's for the equator coming in from the back post.\n16:8 Comment: Another opening for Chelsea.\n16:10 Comment: Downhearted, dispirited, surely beaten.\n16:15 Comment: Anything left now for Luka Tvo, as I say, is to avoid any unnecessary red cards.\n16:22 Comment: It's Kovac, and it's another foul.\n16:40 Comment: Strangely enough, Gus Hiddink was without a home win in the Premier League.\n16:47 Comment: Since he took over from Mourinho.\n16:49 Comment: I think we can say that has been erased now.\n16:52 Comment: He's got the benefit of picking up a strong side today.\n16:55 Comment: I thought he might have left a few out ahead of the PSG game.\n17:2 Comment: They're enjoying themselves now, these Chelsea players.\n17:8 Comment: Good well.\n17:10 Comment: Off Kovac, can he prevent the corner?\n17:12 Comment: Nope, it's been given.\n17:37 Comment: Off to Spain for a few days after this game.\n17:39 Comment: I don't think it's going to be a holiday somehow.\n18:7 Comment: They're in a training camp in warm weather.\n18:11 Comment: I think they're going to find themselves doing a lot of running.\n18:20 Comment: They're in a perilous position as well now.\n18:23 Comment: The difference as we mentioned in the first half has taken a real battering here.\n18:28 Comment: They're in the bottom three at the moment.\n18:30 Comment: I don't think there's any embarrassment in losing here.\n18:32 Comment: It's the way they've lost.\n18:38 Comment: Shelby.\n18:47 Comment: Teote, back to Colaccini.\n18:54 Comment: Looking really on for him.\n19:2 Comment: They're still singing the Glegen races.\n19:7 Comment: Newcastle fans behind the goal.\n19:9 Comment: Full marks to them.\n19:12 Comment: They're sticking loyal and not turning on the players.\n19:15 Comment: Which I fear so many fans do these days.\n19:22 Comment: Colaccini.\n19:28 Comment: It's Shelby.\n19:29 Comment: Colback.\n19:33 Comment: Mitrovic.\n19:38 Comment: Chelsea!\n19:42 Comment: Raman.\n19:47 Comment: Chelsea!\n19:54 Comment: Chelsea almost playing it at testimonial game pace at the moment.\n19:59 Comment: His biggest worry now, Guceric, would be picking up an injury or two.\n20:3 Comment: Having lost John Terry first half.\n20:8 Comment: Newcastle! Newcastle!\n20:10 Comment: Particularly when Newcastle are four down,\n20:12 Comment: where players, if they get a chance, are really going to put their foot in.\n20:15 Comment: Like that.\n20:17 Comment: Teote on Willian.\n20:20 Comment: He's gone down and slid down.\n20:30 Comment: This is a worry for Chelsea at 4-0 ahead.\n20:32 Comment: Teote clearly takes the ball.\n20:37 Comment: There's a follow through.\n20:45 Comment: What can he do?\n20:46 Comment: Steve McClaren.\n20:49 Comment: Here's the first answer.\n20:52 Comment: Teote's coming off.\n20:56 Comment: Jamal Lascelles will come on in his place.\n20:58 Comment: He was suspended for last week's game against West Bromwich Albion\n21:1 Comment: after being sent off at Everton.\n21:3 Comment: He's seen enough.\n21:7 Comment: It's going to be indicating they're going to change things at the back.\n21:11 Comment: Looks like three at the back.\n21:23 Comment: I wonder how Steven Taylor is going to be in what is left of this game?\n21:26 Comment: He must be feeling the paces.\n21:29 Comment: Having been out for six months, he must be feeling the paces.\n21:32 Comment: Chelsea have really worked them.\n21:38 Comment: Took Newcastle to mid-October to win the first game in the Premier League this season.\n21:43 Comment: They've only managed five more wins since.\n21:46 Comment: He's been out of action for most of that time, of course.\n21:50 Comment: Back three, as you see it there.\n22:0 Comment: Shelby.\n22:7 Comment: It's a difficult question, David, because of the inconsistent nature of their performances this season.\n22:14 Comment: But do Newcastle have enough to get out of trouble?\n22:17 Comment: I think they should have.\n22:19 Comment: I've been watching them against West Brom last week and I said I don't recognise them today.\n22:25 Comment: They appear to be a completely different team than St James' Park.\n22:28 Comment: Steve McClaren must wonder what it's going to take for this team to reproduce that form on the road.\n22:34 Comment: Their away record at the moment is going to give them so much to do at home.\n22:40 Comment: McClaren has been insisting all season that Newcastle have been playing better than their results suggest.\n22:45 Comment: However, it doesn't really stack up when you look at the performance like today.\n22:50 Comment: And in their current position, they can't be as sloppy as Newcastle have been anywhere far, let's see Stamford Bridge.\n22:58 Comment: Chelsea, let's not take anything away from Chelsea, they've been very slick today.\n23:4 Comment: But Newcastle have handed much of this to them.\n23:16 Comment: That again kind of sums up, there was no real pressure on Arons and he just sort of panicked and gave away the corner.\n23:23 Comment: I'm assuming he got a shout from Rob Elliott and didn't hear him perhaps.\n23:28 Comment: He knew the danger was on his shoulder.\n23:39 Comment: That's Pellegretta inside to Hazard.\n23:45 Comment: Willian.\n23:48 Comment: Barged aside completely by Thames End.\n23:54 Comment: No complaints from Andres Thames End, I'm sure he's been blocked off a few times like that himself.\n24:5 Comment: Fabregas, and again.\n24:8 Comment: 1-2 is inside the opposition penalty area, he shouldn't really be able to get away with that.\n24:23 Comment: Newcastle are going to make another change in a moment.\n24:30 Comment: Well, it's not the way he would have been wanting to make his debut, that's for sure.\n24:33 Comment: Sadio Dubia, Ivory Coast international striker who's on loan from Roma, will replace Mitrovic.\n24:41 Comment: He had what, just over 20 minutes to go and his team 4-0 down.\n24:45 Comment: The good thing is that Mitrovic is still able to jog off the pitch, when he took the one-two and it was a kill, he's still able to get away with it.\n24:50 Comment: He's still able to jog off the pitch, when he took the one-two and it was a kill, he's still able to get away with it.\n24:56 Comment: Newcastle will need every one of those players, particularly this boy, in the weeks ahead.\n25:3 Comment: Dubia has scored a lot of goals this season in the Russian league.\n25:10 Comment: He's been on loan there as well.\n25:17 Comment: Once a poor lay-off by William, but what a good game again he's had. What a great season he's had.\n25:22 Comment: He's picked a bunch in what has been a poor season. He's been the obvious standout.\n25:28 Comment: Made more appearances than any other Chelsea player and been an outstanding performer from some distance.\n25:34 Comment: He's been an outstanding performer from some distance.\n25:38 Comment: Fabregas, Hazard, Willian, Aspericueta.\n25:45 Comment: Atia probably on the right now, that's where he started his Chelsea career, right back.\n25:51 Comment: Chilore, Hazard, Willian, Matic.\n26:1 Comment: Everyone getting a touch in this Chelsea attack.\n26:4 Comment: Rahman, Matic, Fabregas.\n26:14 Comment: Rahman.\n26:23 Comment: Oh, terrible ball and that gives Dubia his first touch. He couldn't do anything with it.\n26:29 Comment: Pedro who played the slack one.\n26:33 Comment: I really like the slack pass from young Arons that led to Chelsea's goal.\n26:37 Comment: He can smile at 4-0 up.\n26:41 Comment: At this point, 0-0. Might have had a different expression on his face.\n26:47 Comment: On Hat-trick now of course.\n26:51 Comment: He just needs a header to complete a Hat-trick. Left foot, right foot.\n26:58 Comment: Call back.\n27:12 Comment: Chelsea have it back again with Matic and now Hazard.\n27:18 Comment: Aspericueta.\n27:20 Comment: Loads of time and space down that left hand side for Chelsea.\n27:25 Comment: Willian, Fabregas.\n27:38 Comment: Pedro.\n27:40 Comment: Goes back to Rahman.\n27:42 Comment: Traore, the target, there he is. Just nudged up the middle.\n27:46 Comment: Did his best to try and win it back though.\n27:50 Comment: Ivanovic.\n27:52 Comment: Fabregas.\n27:57 Comment: Over elaborate in the end.\n27:59 Comment: Dubia.\n28:9 Comment: Oh, terrible ball.\n28:10 Comment: He's got it.\n28:17 Comment: He did well to hold it up and win a throw for his side.\n28:20 Comment: It's up there on his own.\n28:23 Comment: Newcastle look as if they've settled for four.\n28:25 Comment: Quite happy to get out of town with a 4-0 to back five.\n28:31 Comment: For most of this.\n28:34 Comment: Four on midfield and just the one striker.\n28:40 Comment: Call back.\n28:43 Comment: The South.\n28:47 Comment: Shelby.\n28:58 Comment: I mentioned all the money that Newcastle have spent in the summer and then again in January.\n29:5 Comment: Could it be a case that perhaps they've brought in almost too many players?\n29:9 Comment: It's taken too long for them to settle and gel as a side.\n29:13 Comment: I'm not sure Steve McLaren had a choice.\n29:15 Comment: I think he had to bring in New Blood in the January window, which is never ideal.\n29:19 Comment: And time is not on his side.\n29:23 Comment: Much will be down to Newcastle's judgement in the market in terms of bringing the right players in.\n29:27 Comment: Not one, not two, but three games for you live only on Sky Sports tomorrow.\n29:30 Comment: Super Sunday kicks off with Arsenal against Leicester.\n29:32 Comment: 11.30 Sky Sports 1.\n29:34 Comment: We follow that with Aston Villa versus Liverpool on the same channel.\n29:37 Comment: And then round off the day with Manchester City versus Spurs from four.\n29:41 Comment: And it's a draw.\n29:43 Comment: It's a draw.\n30:27 Comment: VARIOUS PLAYERS CHANTING\n30:58 Comment: Enjoying the additional space in that more central role.\n31:1 Comment: And finding Aarons.\n31:11 Comment: Kovac.\n31:13 Comment: Aarons.\n31:16 Comment: Kovac's there again.\n31:20 Comment: Looking for Dunbier.\n31:22 Comment: Headed away by Ivanovic for the corner.\n31:23 Comment: Decent ball in there, Matis just backed off Jack Kovac.\n31:28 Comment: You see up until now there's been no sign of slackness in this Chelsea performance,\n31:32 Comment: even at 2-3-0 up.\n31:34 Comment: The foot's been on the gas, continuously.\n31:41 Comment: That's a good take by Claude Touart.\n31:44 Comment: And a good early throw as well, a brilliant throw.\n31:47 Comment: That's Aaron.\n31:48 Comment: He's up.\n31:50 Comment: Pedro, two goals already, looking for his hat-trick.\n31:52 Comment: He's in the middle, can he pick him out?\n31:55 Comment: And he nearly did.\n31:58 Comment: Sissoko.\n32:3 Comment: Taylor.\n32:6 Comment: That's too much there of Jan Marth down the right.\n32:9 Comment: Townsend, rather, down the right.\n32:18 Comment: Pedro.\n32:48 Comment: The reigning champions.\n32:53 Comment: Matic.\n32:55 Comment: Hazard.\n33:1 Comment: A handball there, as it was cleared.\n33:6 Comment: Shelby gives it away to Matic.\n33:8 Comment: Here's Fabregas.\n33:12 Comment: Traore.\n33:14 Comment: And again, Traore!\n33:16 Comment: Good block by Kovac.\n33:19 Comment: Sissoko for Newcastle.\n33:24 Comment: And back well by Aspirecueta.\n33:26 Comment: Willian.\n33:28 Comment: Hazard.\n33:34 Comment: Aspirecueta.\n33:36 Comment: Pedro, let it run!\n33:38 Comment: Fabregas with the shot.\n33:42 Comment: And another with it back.\n33:49 Comment: Pedro really unselfish there, to step over and leave it for Fabregas.\n33:54 Comment: He did a head-to-head himself.\n33:55 Comment: Off the stick, about to make his appearance.\n33:59 Comment: Yes, it will be the 20-year-old's fifth appearance in the Premier League this season.\n34:6 Comment: And he will take the spotlight and take the applause, and deserves every bit of it.\n34:18 Comment: Last season it was Hazard, this season it is most definitely Willian.\n34:49 Comment: There's Fabregas.\n34:53 Comment: Off the stick.\n34:56 Comment: Onto Hazard.\n34:59 Comment: Off the stick, keeps running.\n35:6 Comment: Takes it off him.\n35:13 Comment: Chelsea totally dominant again.\n35:19 Comment: Pedro.\n35:22 Comment: Fabregas.\n35:32 Comment: Pedro.\n35:36 Comment: He's got himself in a good position, edge of the box, here he is!\n35:40 Comment: Willian has been very unselfish again there.\n35:43 Comment: He might have taken it on and had a shot himself.\n35:45 Comment: Nobody up the pitch for Newcastle, apart from Dumbia.\n35:49 Comment: I don't think Jeng could hope for it, there was a throw-in.\n36:21 Comment: That's Pere Guetta, all the time in the world to pick out Fabregas.\n36:30 Comment: Lascelles.\n36:32 Comment: It has been every bit as straightforward and, dare I say, easy for Chelsea as the scoreline suggests.\n36:45 Comment: They've made it easy for themselves, certainly Newcastle have contributed to that.\n36:50 Comment: Chelsea have gone about their business, and they've got a good team.\n36:53 Comment: They've made it easy for themselves, certainly Newcastle have contributed to that.\n36:59 Comment: Chelsea have gone about their business, and they've got a good team.\n37:3 Comment: I wonder whether they can kick on from here.\n37:5 Comment: So often this season it's been one step forward and then two back.\n37:24 Comment: Fabregas.\n37:31 Comment: That's Pere Guetta.\n37:34 Comment: He gets the return ball.\n37:36 Comment: And that's a lovely ball, and it's a lovely finish as well!\n37:40 Comment: What a moment for that young man!\n37:43 Comment: His first ever Premier League goal, and Chelsea have five.\n37:50 Comment: Terrific ball in.\n37:52 Comment: This is why teams spend so much time crossing and finishing and training.\n37:59 Comment: Lovely little exchange to get Pere Guetta in behind, it's a wonderful ball in.\n38:4 Comment: And Triori's timbers run to get half a yard on Steven Taylor at the front post.\n38:9 Comment: Terrific piece of football.\n38:13 Comment: Get a wide area early, they get it in early, and someone on the end of the cross.\n38:17 Comment: Terrific to watch.\n38:21 Comment: Triori had scored in the FA Cup, now he's scored in the Premier League as well.\n38:25 Comment: He's been with Chelsea quite some time, but he had to wait his turn because he had problems\n38:30 Comment: after joining them, obtaining the necessary work permit.\n38:36 Comment: Very few opportunities in the first team.\n38:41 Comment: He has his goal to remember.\n38:51 Comment: And he's got it.\n38:57 Comment: You mentioned before the kick-off that Newcastle have a surprisingly good record in recent years\n39:2 Comment: against Chelsea. That's disappeared, and how, here today?\n39:9 Comment: That would be the worry for Steve McLaren, that a 5-0 beating does affect the confidence.\n39:14 Comment: Coming off the back of a good win and a good performance against West Brom, he'd have been\n39:19 Comment: hoping for much more today.\n39:22 Comment: Something to build on again.\n39:26 Comment: Supporters are the one constant about Newcastle, I suppose you could say.\n39:30 Comment: Very little to cheer today.\n39:37 Comment: Kovac, Townsend.\n39:44 Comment: Cine finds Kovac.\n39:49 Comment: And Shelby.\n39:51 Comment: Shizuoka.\n40:7 Comment: I'm sure the Geordie army back in the North East will be watching this,\n40:13 Comment: and the clubs around, in hindsight, they won't have enjoyed it.\n40:21 Comment: Valentine's Day is not going to be happy for those wives and girlfriends in Newcastle tomorrow.\n40:30 Comment: Sunderland's win earlier in the day has made this a thoroughly miserable 24 hours for the Geordie.\n40:44 Comment: Hazard.\n40:47 Comment: Fiore, got the taste now, locked his cheek.\n40:52 Comment: Shelby wins it back.\n40:58 Comment: Mbie.\n41:0 Comment: He's possessed by magic.\n41:2 Comment: That's been the problem all day, getting the front player onto the ball.\n41:6 Comment: He never really managed to get out by hitting the front target and him protecting the ball.\n41:20 Comment: Hazard, could it be six?\n41:24 Comment: Oh, it should have been.\n41:27 Comment: I'll show you how you missed it.\n41:29 Comment: Acknowledgement there of the...\n41:31 Comment: Again another quarterback pass from Fabregas, who, even when he's playing in one of the two holding positions, can hurt you from deep in the pitch.\n41:38 Comment: Just can't quite sort his feet out here, Hazard.

    "summary": "The evening match at Stamford Bridge featuring Chelsea and Newcastle was one to remember for fans of the Blues, as Chelsea resoundedly defeated Newcastle United 5-1 in a ferocious display of attacking football. The atmosphere was buzzing from the outset, despite the wet and windy conditions that swept across West London. With a crowd of over 40,000 packed into the iconic ground, anticipation was high, and the Chelsea faithful were not disappointed.\n\nFrom the very start, Chelsea showed their intent. Diego Costa, who has found a rich vein of form under interim manager Guus Hiddink, spearheaded a fierce and relentless attack that Newcastle simply had no answer to. Within the first six minutes, Chelsea had already made their mark with a dazzling display that shook the Newcastle defense to its core.\n\nChelsea's breakthrough came in the 5th minute. A delightful ball from Cesc Fabregas found Diego Costa in the box. Costa, with a deft first touch, controlled the ball brilliantly and slotted it past the goalkeeper. The Blues' striker wheeled away in celebration, having scored his eighth goal in ten games since Hiddink took over as manager. The early strike was just what Chelsea needed to settle any nerves and set the tone for the rest of the match.\n\nEmboldened by their early success, Chelsea pressed forward with vigor. Barely five minutes had passed before another goal arrived. A Newcastle error in defense allowed Pedro to latch onto a loose ball, and he made no mistake, firing it past the hapless Rob Elliott to make it 2-0. The goal exemplified Pedro's sharp instincts and opportunistic finishing, qualities that had earned him a rare start in this match.\n\nAs Newcastle struggled to regroup, Chelsea continued to dominate. Willian, who has been one of the standout performers for Chelsea this season, was a constant threat down the right-hand side. His pace and skill tormented the Newcastle defense, creating multiple opportunities for his teammates. In the 17th minute, Willian was rewarded for his tireless efforts. A brilliant move saw Diego Costa lay the ball off to Willian, who coolly finished to extend Chelsea's lead to 3-0. The Brazilian's goal, his ninth of the season, put the game beyond doubt even at such an early stage.\n\nDespite being three goals down, Newcastle attempted to muster a response. They enjoyed spells of possession but were unable to penetrate Chelsea's well-organized defense. Jonjo Shelvey and Andros Townsend, two of Newcastle's January signings, tried to make things happen with some enterprising play, but their efforts were largely in vain. Chelsea's defense, marshaled by the experienced John Terry and Gary Cahill, held firm, cutting out numerous crosses and through balls.\n\nThe game was characterized by Chelsea's clinical finishing and cohesive teamwork. The likes of Fabregas, Hazard, and Matic orchestrated play from midfield with precision and creativity. Hazard, in particular, showed glimpses of the form that had made him one of the Premier League's most feared attackers in previous seasons. His interplay with Fabregas was a joy to watch, and their chemistry was evident in Chelsea's fluid attacking moves.\n\nAs the first half drew to a close, Newcastle's woes were compounded by yet another goal. In the 59th minute, Pedro struck again with a superb finish to make it 4-0. Fabregas was again the provider, delivering a perfectly weighted pass that Pedro controlled expertly before firing home. The Spanish winger's brace highlighted his importance to the team and his ability to make a significant impact when given the opportunity.\n\nThe second half brought little respite for Newcastle. Chelsea continued to apply pressure, and their relentless attacking play yielded further rewards. In the 83rd minute, Bertrand Traore, who had come on as a substitute for Diego Costa, capped off a memorable performance with a goal. Aspilicueta delivered a pinpoint cross, and Traore timed his run perfectly to score his first Premier League goal. The young forward's joy was evident as he celebrated with his teammates, basking in the appreciation of the home crowd.\n\nDespite Chelsea's dominance, Newcastle did manage to grab a consolation goal late in the game. Andros Townsend, who had been one of the few bright sparks for the Magpies, scored a fantastic goal in the 90th minute. Townsend's strike, his first for Newcastle, was a small reward for his efforts on a disappointing evening for the visitors.\n\nThe final whistle blew, and the scoreline read Chelsea 5, Newcastle 1. It was a statement victory for Chelsea, who moved up the league table with the three points. The win extended Chelsea's unbeaten run to 11 games under Guus Hiddink, who continues to steer the team in the right direction after their turbulent start to the season.\n\nFor Newcastle, it was a sobering defeat that saw them drop into the relegation zone on goal difference. With only 24 points from 25 games, the road to Premier League survival looks increasingly challenging. Steve McClaren will need to rally his troops and instill a sense of belief and resilience if they are to avoid the drop.\n\nIn summary, it was a night where Chelsea's attacking prowess was on full display. Costa, Willian, Pedro, and Traore all got on the scoresheet, and the team's overall performance was a testament to their quality and determination. For Newcastle, it was a night to forget, but they must regroup quickly and refocus on the task ahead. The gulf in class between the two sides was evident, and Chelsea thoroughly deserved their comprehensive victory. As the fans streamed out of Stamford Bridge into the cold London night, they could reflect on a scintillating performance from their team and look forward to the challenges ahead with renewed optimism."
