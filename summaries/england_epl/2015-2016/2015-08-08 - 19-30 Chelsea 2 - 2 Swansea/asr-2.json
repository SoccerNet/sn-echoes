of Swansea but here they are side\n0:11 Comment: by side on the start line they are equals the champions of 2015 begin their\n0:18 Comment: defense with the ball at the feet of their number one star Aidan Azhar\n0:21 Comment: William alongside, Ivanovic forward early it's William for Chelsea who was\n0:28 Comment: threatening to penetrate very early and Jefferson Montero did well to make up\n0:34 Comment: the ground fabulous start from Chelsea was Montero originally breaking down the\n0:38 Comment: left-hand side but Chelsea proven they're quick to counter-attack looking\n0:43 Comment: to get Costa in the game as soon as possible and I think this will be\n0:46 Comment: interesting for Chelsea do they start like last season and blow teams away or\n0:50 Comment: are they pragmatic like the second half of the season\n0:54 Comment: Oscars corner with whip up into the air by\n0:58 Comment: Gomes\n0:58 Comment: here again by Cahill partially clear by Kyle Norton it's awkward for Taylor\n1:3 Comment: Ivanovic recycles, Oscar heaves it in, Costa is round the back and riffles the\n1:11 Comment: side netting difficult chance for Diego Costa at the far post as it comes back\n1:18 Comment: across you see Swansea have got to do better Gary Cahill wins that header\n1:22 Comment: Ivanovic plays it out wide driven to the far post I think really Costa's got to do better Gary Cahill wins that header Ivanovic plays it out wide driven to the far post I think really Costas is not going to win this one he's not going to win this one either\n1:28 Comment: has got to get his foot around that and just sort of loop it back towards the far post but that man\n1:33 Comment: is the difference so alex ferguson his time used to drive his team on to win trophy after trophy\n1:39 Comment: and i think that's why the chelsea are the favorites this season because of jose mourinho\n1:44 Comment: well last year as you rightly say chelsea just flew out of the blocks it's a habit they have\n1:48 Comment: they haven't lost a premier league game in august since 2006 27 august games unbeaten\n1:55 Comment: they left the rest behind right from the start a year ago\n1:59 Comment: started that season on monday night at burnley and won they were unbeaten in their first 14 games\n2:14 Comment: norton for touch that's gonna question with the throw left full back the only position where\n2:20 Comment: chelsea don't appear to have two obvious alternatives now that felipe luis has gone\n2:25 Comment: it's a game of chance for chelsea and it's a game of chance for chelsea\n2:25 Comment: an area they may strengthen there's talk of danny rose from spurs we'll see\n2:29 Comment: there's cahill ivanovich snatched upon by taylor\n2:39 Comment: who is certainly first pick left fullback for swansea this year because jazz richards has\n2:44 Comment: disappeared to fulham in the championship not very far away from here fernandez\n2:54 Comment: chelsea's pressing already\n2:55 Comment: is really obvious to see in the moment that swansea get on the ball in the defensive half\n3:0 Comment: costa pushes forward hazard pushes forward william all trying to put those swansea players\n3:5 Comment: under pressure we know how good swansea are playing out of the bank and chelsea trying to stop it at\n3:9 Comment: source\n3:15 Comment: charlie kee last year you may recall scored on the opening day at old trafford where swansea won\n3:21 Comment: lifted forward for costa fabiansky kate\n3:23 Comment: שנ다\n3:24 Comment: Fabianski came to very good effect, it's a splendid and important piece of judgement from the Pole.\n3:32 Comment: Hazard, away from Ayew.\n3:37 Comment: Norton got a piece of it, and Williams found Fabianski.\n3:44 Comment: That's a concerning sight for Chelsea folk.\n3:48 Comment: Is that Oscar down?\n3:51 Comment: I think it is.\n3:53 Comment: Yeah, just having a little look round.\n3:55 Comment: Looks like he's maybe just caught a bang in the face.\n3:57 Comment: Courtois obviously went down in the warm-up.\n4:0 Comment: Unfortunately for Swansea, he's fit,\n4:3 Comment: but of course they have a fantastic replacement,\n4:6 Comment: I mean, Azmi Obegovic now as the second-choice goalkeeper.\n4:9 Comment: But not quite seen it, but I think Oscar might have just taken a little bang\n4:13 Comment: as he made that challenge with Key.\n4:16 Comment: Having a look there, can't see anything too much.\n4:21 Comment: Slow-motion replays.\n4:23 Comment: They don't really give us an awful lot.\n4:27 Comment: Has he gone down after that challenge?\n4:29 Comment: Doesn't appear to, he might have caught a finger in the eye there.\n4:32 Comment: Maybe that's what it is, when you see him holding his eye there,\n4:35 Comment: perhaps it was a fingernail, nothing more.\n4:43 Comment: Taking a scratch in the eye, Oscar, who got a couple of goals at Swansea in January,\n4:47 Comment: in fact he hasn't scored in the Premier League since then.\n4:53 Comment: Haven't you looked down to see him at all?\n5:12 Comment: Romero onto an NBA signing,\n5:16 Comment: and that'll have to do for him anyway.\n5:18 Comment: Well, then.\n5:19 Comment: Nice jump out there.\n5:20 Comment: And none too bad, penalty shoots,\n5:22 Comment: didn't win a pre-season game in 90 minutes.\n5:26 Comment: Pretty sure Jose Mourinho would tell you, though,\n5:28 Comment: they count for nothing.\n5:29 Comment: Whether you have a good pre-season or bad pre-season in terms of results,\n5:33 Comment: it's all about being ready for the start of the Premier League season.\n5:36 Comment: And by the looks of it so far, Chelsea look fit, they look eager,\n5:41 Comment: and they look pretty determined to retain their title.\n5:47 Comment: That's where he...\n5:48 Comment: Ayew throwing himself in.\n5:52 Comment: He and his brother taking their respective bows in the Premier League today.\n5:55 Comment: Jordan for Aston Villa, down at Bournemouth earlier.\n5:59 Comment: And Andre, the older brother, newly arrived from Marseille,\n6:5 Comment: for whom he scored 10 goals in 28 Ligue 1 games last year.\n6:9 Comment: Marseille, hardly disappointing you, finished fourth.\n6:13 Comment: Montero, got it back from Sigurdsson.\n6:17 Comment: And Winterkorn again.\n6:18 Comment: A big, big cannery off Ivanovic.\n6:21 Comment: Smart bit of work by the Ecuadorian.\n6:24 Comment: Fabregas just caught in possession,\n6:25 Comment: being swarmed around by Sigurdsson in the first place.\n6:29 Comment: Montero, with Ivanovic out of position,\n6:32 Comment: didn't really have anywhere to go.\n6:33 Comment: But Chelsea will have to defend now.\n6:36 Comment: Williams come up from back, Gomez as well.\n6:38 Comment: All good, strong plays in the air.\n6:39 Comment: So then there's right at the back,\n6:40 Comment: and Xavi whips it in.\n6:41 Comment: Comice!\n6:43 Comment: Got there first.\n6:44 Comment: And that is an alarm for the champions.\n6:48 Comment: Well, this is something you don't see very often.\n6:50 Comment: Chelsea losing out to headers.\n6:52 Comment: It just gets the run on Ivanovic.\n6:54 Comment: It gets blocked off.\n6:55 Comment: This is what Chelsea are absolutely superb at doing at the other end of the pitch.\n6:59 Comment: He steals half a yard, can't quite direct his header on goal.\n7:3 Comment: Having got there, you're expecting him to score.\n7:6 Comment: Well, also with nobody on the post as well.\n7:8 Comment: On that back post, could have quite easily just dropped in.\n7:12 Comment: Courtois would have been stranded.\n7:16 Comment: Must get forward by Williams.\n7:18 Comment: And here by Cahill.\n7:20 Comment: Rodriguez can't keep it alive.\n7:25 Comment: And these big boots to fill.\n7:28 Comment: Starting as the primary striker.\n7:30 Comment: Beginning of the season now,\n7:31 Comment: in the absence of Wilfred Boni for the first time.\n7:35 Comment: His second season since leaving Lyon.\n7:43 Comment: Fernandes.\n7:44 Comment: Norton.\n7:46 Comment: Sharply in for Sigurdsson.\n7:48 Comment: Striker hit by Shelby.\n7:50 Comment: Out by Ivanovic.\n7:51 Comment: Williams.\n7:52 Comment: Fabregas.\n7:53 Comment: Terry.\n7:54 Comment: Matic.\n7:55 Comment: Chelsea finding a rhythm.\n7:56 Comment: Williams.\n7:57 Comment: Oscar.\n8:1 Comment: Fabregas.\n8:2 Comment: And now Matic.\n8:3 Comment: Fabregas.\n8:18 Comment: FABRIGAS GRIFFIN.\n8:20 Comment: Mosca.\n8:22 Comment: Fabregas.\n8:24 Comment: Hazard.\n8:26 Comment: Rolled in towards Costa.\n8:28 Comment: And leapt upon by Fabianski.\n8:32 Comment: Delightful passage of play.\n8:34 Comment: Superb one-and-two touch football, and that's what Chelsea are all about.\n8:38 Comment: This is where Swansea will find it difficult.\n8:40 Comment: Two players go to shut the ball down, Chelsea players can deal with that.\n8:44 Comment: They have the quality, they have the attitude,\n8:47 Comment: not to be concerned.\n8:48 Comment: Most players under that much pressure give the ball away.\n8:51 Comment: The Chelsea players don't,\n8:53 Comment: and that means somebody else is unmarked on the pitch.\n8:56 Comment: Very strong holding off Matic, but imprecise in his pass.\n9:3 Comment: Finished last season well, four goals in his last five games for Gary Monk,\n9:7 Comment: who in his first full season in charge\n9:11 Comment: achieved Swansea's best ever Premier League finish.\n9:17 Comment: Still only 36, fresh-faced.\n9:21 Comment: And a young man who, given the pressures of his job,\n9:24 Comment: conducts himself immaculately in the Premier League.\n9:28 Comment: Goldfish ball.\n9:30 Comment: Mosca.\n9:35 Comment: Led by Taylor, but Willian has it back.\n9:37 Comment: Taylor won't let him rest.\n9:39 Comment: Michael Oliver penalises him.\n9:44 Comment: That's what Swansea have to do, though.\n9:46 Comment: Can't give Chelsea players any time or space on the ball.\n9:50 Comment: They're good enough to deal with the pressure.\n9:52 Comment: If you give them time and space, they will rip you apart.\n9:58 Comment: Willian.\n10:0 Comment: Ivanovic has a clout.\n10:5 Comment: Spent a lot of last Sunday's Community Shield in the attacking third.\n10:9 Comment: Not that Chelsea were at their coherent and penetrative best,\n10:13 Comment: but he showed that customary inclination to get in.\n10:15 Comment: Well, the Chelsea defenders, and especially Ivanovic,\n10:18 Comment: always get you a few goals.\n10:20 Comment: I think Ivanovic is normally a bit more prolific from inside the 18-yard box.\n10:35 Comment: In by Cahill.\n10:37 Comment: That went Norton.\n10:39 Comment: Down went Ayew, and Swansea have a free kick.\n10:41 Comment: Not a big man, just 5ft 9.\n10:43 Comment: Dwarfed by Chelsea, back four.\n11:1 Comment: Williams for Shelton.\n11:3 Comment: Drifted out wide for Norton.\n11:5 Comment: Face to face here with Azpilicueta.\n11:7 Comment: That's a good one.\n11:9 Comment: And that's Pellequeta.\n11:11 Comment: Ayew.\n11:13 Comment: Shelby.\n11:17 Comment: Around, that's Pellequeta.\n11:21 Comment: Looking to thread it into the corridor of uncertainty,\n11:23 Comment: but Courtois, red OK.\n11:26 Comment: Good play from Shelby.\n11:28 Comment: Azpilicueta shows in the line.\n11:30 Comment: Shelby can't quite get enough on it to get that ball away from Courtois.\n11:34 Comment: But you just see there, three Chelsea defenders,\n11:36 Comment: all backing up their goalkeeper just in case.\n11:39 Comment: The second collections trophy,\n11:40 Comment: Greenwich away from this olympic than he can get this top.\n11:42 Comment: As pipelines attack.\n11:44 Comment: Chapman behind Cheshire inter rulers will group them up.\n11:46 Comment: And the twoieltion of which has taken ten longer in this series.\n11:49 Comment: Honey, I think Gavin Hood.\n11:50 Comment: The up- Würmeths shortungen.\n11:52 Comment: And here's the big one atvate.\n11:56 Comment: Red envisioning a safer group of fans in the\n11:57 Comment: Matichesr .\n12:0 Comment: Good win by Thierry.\n12:5 Comment: Looks like Wales to win,\n12:7 Comment: but Cheshire payments off.\n12:8 Comment: FANS ROAR\n14:13 Comment: Shelby\n14:14 Comment: Gomis onside\n14:17 Comment: Lingered, Terry got back and Cahill heaved it out\n14:24 Comment: Best two chances of the game have fallen\n14:27 Comment: to Bafa Gomis one-headed opportunity, one\n14:30 Comment: eyeball to eyeball with Courtois and Terry\n14:36 Comment: Was a great chance\n14:38 Comment: for Gomez, just seemed to hesitate, couldn't quite get his touch right to get the shot away earlier.\n14:44 Comment: Montero, this time beyond Gomez.\n14:53 Comment: Key.\n14:56 Comment: Gomez, Key! Beaten out by Courtois, landed conveniently for Matic and Fabregas starts a\n15:3 Comment: Chelsea counter and they're three on three here. Oscar Costa searching Klaas Fernandes\n15:10 Comment: whose challenge is worth only a corner. Well Diego Costa is absolutely furious.\n15:18 Comment: Michael Oliver instantly pointed to the corner flag, he'd made up good ground because it was\n15:24 Comment: a very quick attack. We'll just have a look at the replay as he slides in, I think penalty.\n15:30 Comment: I don't think any contact is made with the ball.\n15:33 Comment: Oh maybe from that angle. This is how difficult it is, you know even in slow motion for the first\n15:39 Comment: angle you say penalty, the second angle you say not. So difficult for referees. In by Fabregas\n15:44 Comment: and I sympathize entirely with your plight Danny but I think that second replay when Jose Mourinho\n15:50 Comment: sees it may just calm his temper because it does appear that Fernandes got a toe on the ball.\n15:59 Comment: Costa's offside now. I'm sure we'll see that several times in the next few minutes.\n16:0 Comment: I'm sure we'll see that several times in the next few minutes.\n16:3 Comment: A nice starter that a side came into play on this wing there is\n16:19 Comment: Dowd. Yeah 아니야 got that as well in that round run by a player who's had quite a longick tosoo\n16:25 Comment: he's taken a late winger's set. I don't want\n16:27 Comment: to talk too much all day so let's just talk.\n16:29 Comment: Port analys arrived to the table in a strange start if we'll see him get back on the field and\n16:32 Comment: we sit down and we'll see what happens.\n16:33 Comment: It is for that very spine you've been speaking to this the second.\n16:33 Comment: Fętosa passes the Comma please do you Career?\n16:33 Comment: He's got a good shot for him.\n16:43 Comment: Ayoub, Lawton...\n16:45 Comment: Wasn't a kind pass.\n16:47 Comment: Matic, Oscar, as he got past those two.\n16:50 Comment: Fabregas, Willian ahead of him.\n16:52 Comment: And Neil Taylor got there in the nick of time.\n16:58 Comment: Pitch was just a little sticky,\n17:0 Comment: that ball needs to be a couple of yards ahead of Willian,\n17:3 Comment: I think he was past Neil Taylor and in on goal.\n17:6 Comment: I think we have to give great credit to the referee.\n17:8 Comment: From first look, I wasn't quite sure.\n17:11 Comment: Referee gave the corner.\n17:13 Comment: First look at the replay, I thought penalty.\n17:15 Comment: Second look at the replay, maybe not, perhaps got some of the ball.\n17:18 Comment: Matic, deflection, Fabianski pouched it.\n17:26 Comment: Well, it's a really open game.\n17:28 Comment: This is not really the man that Matic's special had to either.\n17:31 Comment: I've seen him do it once or twice,\n17:33 Comment: last season, especially for an international team as well.\n17:36 Comment: Really open game, really exciting game, I think, for the start.\n17:40 Comment: No sort of nerves or caginess,\n17:42 Comment: and both teams really going out to win the game.\n17:47 Comment: Lawton bounced off Gomes, came to Fabregas,\n17:50 Comment: run back momentarily by Shelby,\n17:53 Comment: and Mike Wildley by Joncho Shelby,\n17:56 Comment: who is going to see his season's first yellow card.\n18:3 Comment: You always run the risk, any tackle from behind,\n18:6 Comment: even if you get the ball, you run the risk of getting a yellow card.\n18:11 Comment: You see there, Joncho Shelby, he doesn't, he gambles,\n18:14 Comment: he's got to stay on his feet.\n18:15 Comment: Had one or two disciplinary issues in his career.\n18:18 Comment: Oscar, smashing diagonal, Ivanovic beats his way past Monteiro.\n18:24 Comment: Here's Willian.\n18:26 Comment: Nudged away by Taylor, kept in play by Key.\n18:29 Comment: FILE FOOTBALL PLAYS\n18:31 Comment: Slap for Monteiro.\n18:35 Comment: Willian.\n18:38 Comment: He picks him out of trouble, Monteiro hits it too early.\n18:41 Comment: Kehle has it back for Chelsea, now Fabregas.\n18:50 Comment: Monteiro once more caught on it, Costa holding it up.\n18:55 Comment: Forward again by Azpilicueta.\n18:59 Comment: Swansea just can't keep the ball up.\n19:1 Comment: The ball, Azhar.\n19:6 Comment: Willian, Oscar.\n19:9 Comment: Willian has a free kick.\n19:12 Comment: Challenged by Monteiro.\n19:15 Comment: Monteiro's had an absolute shock in two or three minutes.\n19:18 Comment: He got caught out in the first place.\n19:20 Comment: Not sure there's too much in that one.\n19:23 Comment: He got caught in the first place with Ivanovic,\n19:25 Comment: then gave the ball away four times on the spin.\n19:28 Comment: And that just keeps your team under pressure, makes it very, very difficult.\n19:30 Comment: And now Chelsea can deliver.\n19:32 Comment: Oscar, great delivery.\n19:34 Comment: Ivanovic, Matic, Costa, Terry, all strong in the air.\n19:41 Comment: One-man Swansea wall.\n19:43 Comment: Oscar over the ball.\n19:45 Comment: With Wipp.\n19:51 Comment: Splitting the gap between goalkeeper and the nearest on rushing striker.\n19:55 Comment: Well, Oscar looks a little bit puzzled.\n19:57 Comment: And I almost agree with him.\n19:59 Comment: It's a great ball in.\n20:1 Comment: In that area, the goalkeeper doesn't want to come forward, it's too far out.\n20:4 Comment: Defenders don't want to go backwards.\n20:6 Comment: Nobody gambled on that ball going into that area.\n20:9 Comment: You see those two wide players for Swansea,\n20:12 Comment: I think they've just got to narrow a little bit.\n20:14 Comment: You know, give Gomez a little bit of help at the moment,\n20:17 Comment: especially down Chelsea's right, Swansea's left.\n20:20 Comment: It's a little bit too easy for Chelsea.\n20:26 Comment: Kick against Keat.\n20:29 Comment: I think what is interesting so far, though, Peter,\n20:32 Comment: is sort of the new regulations coming in about feigning injury and players getting in trouble.\n20:37 Comment: Most players so far, when they've been kicked, have jumped up pretty soon.\n20:43 Comment: You know, there's been no...\n20:45 Comment: There's been a lot less simulation and play acting and players rolling about on the floor.\n20:50 Comment: That is an interesting observation, Danny.\n20:53 Comment: It would be fascinating to know how typical that's been over the course of the afternoon games\n20:57 Comment: in the Barclays Premier League.\n20:58 Comment: Which we haven't been privy to, and indeed how long that mood will last.\n21:3 Comment: Ayoub's got a minor problem, I think only minor,\n21:8 Comment: down to the side of the head.\n21:10 Comment: Don't suppose he'll be absent for long.\n21:17 Comment: This may not be your first Premier League watch of the day,\n21:20 Comment: but if it is, then...\n21:22 Comment: Just to remind you, there are one or two little tweaks\n21:25 Comment: in terms of officiating games.\n21:28 Comment: The first one is the off-the-game by referees,\n21:31 Comment: relating to the behaviour of players in their vicinity\n21:34 Comment: and relating to the way players deal with feigned injury.\n21:39 Comment: That's a free-kick against Gomis.\n21:44 Comment: Change on Azpilicueta in a dangerous area.\n21:48 Comment: Can't keep giving free-kicks away in and around the penalty area.\n21:52 Comment: Oscar's last delivery was absolutely magnificent.\n21:56 Comment: This, I expect, very, very similar.\n21:58 Comment: He'll be aiming towards the far post.\n22:0 Comment: If nobody touches it, he'll be looking to hit the inside of that far post and creep in.\n22:6 Comment: Again, just a one-man wall.\n22:8 Comment: Again, Oscar with...\n22:9 Comment: Ball away!\n22:12 Comment: Champions League!\n22:18 Comment: 22 minutes into the start of their defence.\n22:22 Comment: Oscar with purity of strike, just as we remember him.\n22:29 Comment: Wow, thank you, Oscar.\n22:31 Comment: Just said moments before, whip that across the goal.\n22:34 Comment: If nobody touches it, in off the far post.\n22:37 Comment: He's missed the far post by about a foot.\n22:40 Comment: But that's exactly the problem the goalkeeper has.\n22:42 Comment: Look at the angle there.\n22:43 Comment: The goalkeeper's expecting Gary Cahill to get a touch.\n22:46 Comment: If not, Ivanovic gets a touch.\n22:49 Comment: The goalkeeper's got no chance to react to that.\n22:51 Comment: Jose Mourinho, well, hardly even a smile, but he would be delighted with that.\n22:57 Comment: Mourinho apparently unexcited.\n22:59 Comment: But Oscar happy enough with his first Premier League goal since he scored two at Swansea in January.\n23:7 Comment: And the one that launches Chelsea's title defence on their own ground.\n23:15 Comment: On a ground where they haven't lost to Swansea since 1925, 90 years ago.\n23:19 Comment: Swansea...\n23:21 Comment: Enjoyed that victory and only that victory in this part of the world.\n23:25 Comment: They have a dreadful record here.\n23:28 Comment: Oscar, Hazard...\n23:36 Comment: Straight out to Costa, rolled forward again by Ivanovic.\n23:39 Comment: That'll be a change of direction from Oscar.\n23:42 Comment: Driving on is Fabregas.\n23:44 Comment: Willian...\n23:51 Comment: Taylor got in the way.\n23:55 Comment: The problem that Swansea now have is if they start to attack, they're a bit more expansive.\n24:0 Comment: They'll get caught with a sucker punch and on the counter-attack.\n24:3 Comment: Now the pace of Willian, Hazard, Diego Costa is absolutely superb.\n24:9 Comment: Swansea, I think, have done reasonably well up to now, but Oscar's first free-kick was brilliant.\n24:13 Comment: No one got on the end of it.\n24:14 Comment: The second one...\n24:15 Comment: Different class.\n24:16 Comment: Knew exactly what he was trying to do.\n24:18 Comment: No one touched it and it paid off.\n24:21 Comment: I think he's looking to beat the long throw of Ivanovic.\n24:24 Comment: That came to nothing.\n24:25 Comment: This most certainly didn't.\n24:27 Comment: No issues about offside in the slightest, even in Eslip.\n24:31 Comment: There's a new tweak to that rule as well.\n24:33 Comment: Gary Cahill, look.\n24:35 Comment: The goalkeeper thinks that he's going to get a touch.\n24:39 Comment: He almost...\n24:40 Comment: He should and he probably misses it accidentally.\n24:43 Comment: And then behind that, you've got Ivanovic.\n24:46 Comment: Again, the goalkeeper has to wait to see if he gets a touch before he dives.\n24:49 Comment: And by the time it's past Ivanovic, he's gone.\n24:50 Comment: He's gone.\n24:51 Comment: Ivanovic too late for the goalkeeper.\n24:53 Comment: Hazard.\n24:54 Comment: Norton's got a problem.\n24:55 Comment: That problem is Aidan Hazard.\n24:56 Comment: And actually, he solved the problem well.\n24:58 Comment: Hazard perhaps showed him more of the ball than customarily the Belgian does.\n25:3 Comment: Even so, Norton reacted adeptly.\n25:9 Comment: The full-back's worst nightmare.\n25:16 Comment: Fabregas with the corner.\n25:17 Comment: Gomis with the half clearance.\n25:19 Comment: Hazard.\n25:21 Comment: Got it back from Terry.\n25:23 Comment: Cahill slips in a comic cuts moment.\n25:32 Comment: Lost his bearings and lost his footing.\n25:34 Comment: Lost a little bit of his dignity.\n25:36 Comment: He was winding up for an absolute thunderbolt, wasn't he?\n25:40 Comment: Sadly, didn't quite get his body in the right position.\n25:43 Comment: Standing leg just went from under him.\n25:45 Comment: Cahill.\n25:47 Comment: And there he is.\n25:59 Comment: Fabregas.\n26:0 Comment: Oscar.\n26:1 Comment: Delightful touch.\n26:2 Comment: Hazard.\n26:4 Comment: .\n26:5 Comment: Oscar.\n26:6 Comment: .\n26:16 Comment: Let's go.\n26:22 Comment: Fabregas.\n26:24 Comment: Willian.\n26:26 Comment: Right across the face.\n26:28 Comment: Again, it only needed a touch.\n26:31 Comment: Chelsea now starting to exert some real pressure.\n26:35 Comment: Unusual trick from Willian.\n26:37 Comment: Normally he has that little feint with the right foot,\n26:39 Comment: just knocks it with the outside of the foot\n26:41 Comment: and then goes round the outside,\n26:43 Comment: just drags his shot across.\n26:44 Comment: The difference between the two teams at the moment,\n26:47 Comment: Chelsea are very, very comfortable,\n26:49 Comment: every single player receiving the ball under pressure.\n26:52 Comment: You see there, Gomez under pressure gives it away.\n26:55 Comment: Fabregas.\n26:56 Comment: Costa.\n26:57 Comment: Driving through Williams.\n26:59 Comment: Fabregas.\n27:1 Comment: Williams stuck to his task really boldly.\n27:10 Comment: Key.\n27:11 Comment: Shelby.\n27:12 Comment: Swansea finding it so hard to escape at the moment.\n27:14 Comment: But escape, at least temporarily they have.\n27:19 Comment: Gomez.\n27:22 Comment: He has a bit of pressure.\n27:29 Comment: Swansea just been rocked by that goal, I think.\n27:31 Comment: They're just starting to back off a little bit,\n27:32 Comment: give Chelsea a little bit more space\n27:35 Comment: and just sit a little bit deeper.\n27:37 Comment: Norton.\n27:37 Comment: Gomez.\n27:38 Comment: Norton.\n27:39 Comment: Sigurdsson surging into the box.\n27:42 Comment: Too close to Courtois.\n27:44 Comment: This is the last time for the Swansea team.\n27:46 Comment: I think they're going to be the winners.\n27:49 Comment: I think Sigurdsson actually was left out of the Swansea team\n27:51 Comment: for the last of their pre-season friendly games\n27:53 Comment: against Deportivo La Coruña last weekend.\n27:56 Comment: And word is he hadn't had a great pre-season up to then\n28:0 Comment: and might have been omitted from this starting XI altogether.\n28:4 Comment: Turned out to be nothing more than speculation.\n28:9 Comment: Been key to them over the last couple of years.\n28:11 Comment: Here's Montero.\n28:13 Comment: Gomez!\n28:13 Comment: Great save!\n28:14 Comment: Ayew!\n28:14 Comment: Oh, wonderful stop, Ayew again, 1-1!\n28:21 Comment: Debut goal for Andre Ayew, and the champions are pegged back at home.\n28:29 Comment: The Welsh invaders with reason to smile.\n28:34 Comment: Reason given them by their Garnier new boy.\n28:38 Comment: Courtois did all he could, it wasn't enough.\n28:41 Comment: Well, just as I thought, Sonzi were on the back foot.\n28:43 Comment: What a fantastic piece of play.\n28:45 Comment: Great play, great ball into the box.\n28:48 Comment: Really good header, fabulous save.\n28:50 Comment: And I thought they'd chance it gone.\n28:52 Comment: Gary Cahill makes that stop, helps out his goalkeeper with a fantastic block.\n28:57 Comment: Throwing his body in the way.\n28:58 Comment: But then Ayew, as quick as anybody, gets up, reacts, but then keeps his composure.\n29:4 Comment: Wait here, he just has a little pause.\n29:6 Comment: He stops, drags it back, and fires it into the far corner.\n29:10 Comment: Fantastic finish from Ayew.\n29:13 Comment: Andre Ayew, who finished last season with three goals in his last five games for Marseille\n29:18 Comment: against Lorient and Monaco and Lille right at the end of that French season.\n29:23 Comment: He scored once in pre-season at Nottingham Forest.\n29:27 Comment: And now he has his first goal in the Barclays Premier League.\n29:30 Comment: And despite dominating the bulk of the first half hour here,\n29:35 Comment: Chelsea are back where they started.\n29:40 Comment: Fabregas.\n29:43 Comment: Hazard.\n29:47 Comment: Willian.\n29:48 Comment: It's looped in!\n29:51 Comment: Cool deflection.\n29:54 Comment: Willian will claim it as his own.\n29:58 Comment: Chelsea won't run back for long.\n30:1 Comment: Their one goal lead quickly re-established.\n30:6 Comment: This is devastating for Swansea.\n30:9 Comment: Willian is just looking to feed this into the box.\n30:12 Comment: That's going.\n30:13 Comment: That's going across the six-yard box.\n30:15 Comment: Maybe going absolutely nowhere near the goal.\n30:19 Comment: It bounces, loops up over the goalkeeper.\n30:23 Comment: Babianski has absolutely no chance.\n30:26 Comment: There's nothing anybody really can do that.\n30:29 Comment: You could argue that Fernandes could get a little bit tighter.\n30:32 Comment: But he is so unfortunate.\n30:33 Comment: That ball could go absolutely anywhere.\n30:36 Comment: The only place it could go is loop up into the far corner.\n30:39 Comment: That causes Swansea a problem.\n30:40 Comment: And that's what it is.\n30:42 Comment: Less than two minutes.\n30:43 Comment: And they find themselves back behind.\n30:46 Comment: Now Swansea were level for 92 seconds.\n30:52 Comment: Last season's fixture here was sort of thrills and stills.\n30:56 Comment: Six goals, including an own goal actually, scored by John Terry.\n31:0 Comment: Chelsea won it 4-2.\n31:4 Comment: And after six goals in the whole of that game,\n31:6 Comment: three in the first half hour of this.\n31:8 Comment: And Chelsea are hungry for more with Hazard.\n31:11 Comment: Away from key.\n31:14 Comment: AC bought number 14 a new territory\n31:39 Comment: The heat from Shadow Goal at a также\n31:42 Comment: I think someED team.\n31:42 Comment: And his moment of joy was very short-lived.\n31:45 Comment: Sigurdsson.\n31:48 Comment: He'd left Cahill on the ground,\n31:49 Comment: but Matic was there to complete the Chelsea defending.\n31:54 Comment: Hazard, Oscar...\n31:59 Comment: Fabregas.\n32:9 Comment: Ljubanovic, Costa...\n32:12 Comment: Set-back for Ljubanovic.\n32:17 Comment: Costa...\n32:18 Comment: Khabianski applied a palm.\n32:21 Comment: Instinctively, as much as anything else,\n32:23 Comment: I'm not quite sure he knew where it was going.\n32:26 Comment: And Matic has come across and fouled Sigurdsson.\n32:32 Comment: More good play from Chelsea. They do look very, very dangerous.\n32:35 Comment: Especially on the counter-attack.\n32:37 Comment: Really good centre-forward,\n32:39 Comment: but they're not going to be able to get past it.\n32:41 Comment: It's a good game.\n32:42 Comment: Good forward play from Diego Costa.\n32:44 Comment: Ljubanovic breaking from right-back.\n32:46 Comment: As it comes out, Costa...\n32:48 Comment: He has this sort of language style sometimes, doesn't he?\n32:51 Comment: Just fires it across goal.\n32:53 Comment: Khabianski's not quite sure what to do,\n32:55 Comment: and in the end just gets a palm on it.\n32:57 Comment: Chelsea look like they want to go and attack,\n32:59 Comment: a little bit like they did at the start of last season.\n33:4 Comment: Norton.\n33:6 Comment: It's a very tidy take.\n33:7 Comment: Has Pellequeta at his back.\n33:9 Comment: He's got nowhere to go, a little by way of assistance.\n33:13 Comment: So a throw is about as much as he could have hoped for.\n33:16 Comment: Suggestion to Mike Malarkey, the assistant there,\n33:19 Comment: that he's having his shirt tugged.\n33:22 Comment: Nothing doing.\n33:29 Comment: Pellequeta, as you rightly implied, Danny,\n33:31 Comment: has the feel in terms of last season\n33:33 Comment: of a pre-Christmas Chelsea performance.\n33:36 Comment: Pellequeta.\n33:37 Comment: Pellequeta, a bit of swagger and attacking intent,\n33:41 Comment: I was at Wembley last weekend for the Community Shield\n33:44 Comment: and there's always this conversation.\n33:46 Comment: Gary Monk might have rehearsed it himself mentally\n33:49 Comment: after what he saw against Arsenal.\n33:52 Comment: How much do we read into it?\n33:54 Comment: And it is immediately apparent that from Chelsea's perspective\n33:57 Comment: at least, we read very little.\n33:59 Comment: They were tepid...\n34:0 Comment: And, uh...\n34:1 Comment: They had left this sort of performance in the locker\n34:5 Comment: for the day when it really mattered.\n34:7 Comment: Costa.\n34:12 Comment: Powerful, full of bulk and will.\n34:15 Comment: Williams stayed with him.\n34:19 Comment: Always so difficult as a defender\n34:21 Comment: when players are prepared to get the ball and run at you.\n34:26 Comment: You're on the back foot, you're going backwards, you're off balance.\n34:29 Comment: Sometimes the best that you can do is, even if you get a toe-in,\n34:32 Comment: give away a corner or even a throw-in deep in your own half.\n34:37 Comment: It's Taloska to take.\n34:47 Comment: Demis with the header out.\n34:51 Comment: Savagas out-muscled by Ayew.\n35:37 Comment: He's making this such a good watch.\n35:39 Comment: The evidence of our eyes suggests all is certainly not lost for Swansea.\n35:44 Comment: They have scored a goal.\n35:45 Comment: Gomes has had a couple of very good goal-scoring chances beside that.\n35:51 Comment: Key.\n35:53 Comment: Montero looking to tease Ivanovic.\n35:55 Comment: He's got away from Ivanovic.\n36:0 Comment: Cahill shifts it out from the near post.\n36:4 Comment: Williams got himself into trouble.\n36:5 Comment: Montero.\n36:7 Comment: And Sigurdsson.\n36:9 Comment: Courtois got across.\n36:14 Comment: Oscar won the header.\n36:16 Comment: As Pellequeta can lead the break.\n36:24 Comment: Savagas.\n36:26 Comment: Spread for Williams.\n36:29 Comment: Another tussle for Taylor.\n36:31 Comment: Backpedalling furiously.\n36:35 Comment: Williams.\n36:36 Comment: Savagas.\n36:37 Comment: Hazard.\n36:39 Comment: Oscar.\n36:42 Comment: Costa to retrieve.\n36:59 Comment: Costa.\n37:1 Comment: Davidez.\n37:3 Comment: Ivanovic.\n37:4 Comment: Savagas.\n37:6 Comment: Protected by...\n37:7 Comment: Costa.\n37:8 Comment: From Selby.\n37:15 Comment: Frustration, I think, for Diego Costa,\n37:17 Comment: just sitting down on the ground.\n37:18 Comment: I don't think that's an injury concern at all.\n37:22 Comment: Key.\n37:25 Comment: Montero, who sometimes looked lively with the ball in the Chelsea half,\n37:30 Comment: though he's been a bit of a defensive liability from time to time in his own half.\n37:37 Comment: Shelby Sigurdsson\n37:42 Comment: Montero ran away from Ivanovic lovely return from Sigurdsson Montero has\n37:49 Comment: Pellequeta with an important touch Norton for Comis\n37:54 Comment: just he controlled it on his chest just brought his right arm I think it was\n37:58 Comment: forward for Montero causing Ivanovic all sorts of problems I almost go say as a\n38:3 Comment: traditional old-fashioned winger and as a fullback you have to just say you know\n38:7 Comment: what stay in there half don't come back and try and help me out because like you\n38:12 Comment: just said he's causing more problems when that happens get in the ball and\n38:16 Comment: let him run it about of it Ivanovic has got has got power he hasn't got blister\n38:21 Comment: in place is not particularly quick off the mark and Montero is so so sharp\n38:26 Comment: that's I think can be Swansea's best opportunity to get back in it\n38:29 Comment: Matich William fancies this\n38:33 Comment: six and a half minutes till half-time really engaging opening to Chelsea's\n38:40 Comment: title defense here at Stamford Bridge in the Barclays Premier League it's Key just\n38:45 Comment: too heavy for Comis Key has actually pulled up don't want that he was\n38:52 Comment: fundamental to so much of what they did well last season Ki Seung-yong the South\n38:56 Comment: Korean international he scored their first goal of last season at Old Trafford\n39:1 Comment: concern that for Key just holds on for a while now but it's a good start for the\n39:3 Comment: team to get back in the game and he's got a little bit of a worry about\n39:6 Comment: his right hamstring really good break forward but just look again John Terry\n39:10 Comment: just caught a little bit ball-watching not quite aware where Comis is he's got\n39:15 Comment: to check his shoulder very unlike John Terry that's almost twice he's been\n39:19 Comment: caught out now with Comis just peeling off and then running that diagonal in\n39:23 Comment: behind him but I think this is gonna be a little bit of a worry hopefully might\n39:28 Comment: just be a little bit of an overstretch a little bit of cramp even this early on\n39:31 Comment: for Key Seung-yong and it's not a snapped hamstring\n39:33 Comment: this is a selection on look even for Comis but right now he's got a little bit\n39:37 Comment: there he's gotten back in form to set up his business for last season collapsed\n39:41 Comment: Mayor outlook nothing new there was no change in the tendinool last season\n39:46 Comment: key soon young once saw his business was effectively done he was taken out of it\n39:51 Comment: for what's described as minor knee surgery wasn't a real snack he was\n39:57 Comment: always going to be ready for the start of this season he's played a full part a\n40:0 Comment: preseason\n40:1 Comment: Jose Mourinho once he was able to name Diego Costa had fully fit squad or very\n40:10 Comment: nearly\n40:20 Comment: this is low-key feels he needs to withdraw himself that's a that is a shame\n40:26 Comment: for Swansea to say he he started 30 of 38 Premier League games last year only\n40:33 Comment: missed brief period in January because he went off to represent his country in\n40:37 Comment: the Asia Cup otherwise an ever-present and this is\n40:43 Comment: rather sad farewell at least for today he bids for travelling Swansea supporters\n40:49 Comment: he's got to be replaced by a player who owes Chelsea plenty Jack Cork a former\n40:55 Comment: captain of the Chelsea\n40:56 Comment: you\n40:56 Comment: youth team and reserves came through at this club they remember him fondly\n41:1 Comment: though he never played a first-team game for them before moving on to South\n41:7 Comment: Hampton via loans at Scunthorpe and Watford to Burnley\n41:15 Comment: technically a very good player Jack Cork you know likes to get hold of the\n41:18 Comment: ball keep the passing moving from side to side little probing balls forward but\n41:24 Comment: I think they'll miss the\n41:26 Comment: touchdown to 해도 need 50 any\n41:39 Comment: Leipzig\n41:40 Comment: ofいて young that's what he's very comfortable that he's veryaceing tys\n41:45 Comment: long box-to-box runs needed\n42:25 Comment: Shelby.\n42:29 Comment: Montero, another chance to run at Ivanovic.\n42:33 Comment: And away from Willian.\n42:36 Comment: And here comes Taylor, protected by Ayew.\n42:42 Comment: Snatched away by Willian.\n42:47 Comment: Hazard.\n42:50 Comment: Slight miscue.\n42:51 Comment: And here we go.\n42:54 Comment: Dispossessed by Fabregas.\n42:57 Comment: And he's then fouled.\n43:14 Comment: 18 assists in the Premier League last season for Cesc Fabregas.\n43:19 Comment: One of the great creators.\n43:21 Comment: One of the creators of chances.\n43:26 Comment: And free to start this season.\n43:27 Comment: Remember, he was sent off at West Brom in a slightly comical event\n43:30 Comment: right at the back end of last year when Chelsea had already won the title.\n43:35 Comment: He was initially given a three-game ban, but it was reduced to just one.\n43:46 Comment: Fabregas.\n43:47 Comment: Willian.\n43:51 Comment: Hazard.\n43:56 Comment: Retrieved by Ivanovic.\n44:0 Comment: He's held up by Montero.\n44:2 Comment: And a reversal of roles.\n44:8 Comment: Sigurdsson.\n44:9 Comment: Shelby.\n44:10 Comment: Cork.\n44:12 Comment: Sold Shelby short.\n44:17 Comment: Hazard.\n44:18 Comment: Fabregas.\n44:21 Comment: And\n44:49 Comment: the result.\n44:50 Comment: FANS ROAR\n44:58 Comment: With his right foot, I'm not sure he can score from this angle.\n45:1 Comment: Even him.\n45:2 Comment: As we head into three minutes of first-half stoppage time.\n45:6 Comment: FRAWL CONFERENCE PLAYER\n45:11 Comment: Lofted in by Oscar.\n45:13 Comment: Attacked by Costa.\n45:15 Comment: Lifting out by Shelby, who misses out to Cahill.\n45:27 Comment: That's how it went to throw.\n45:29 Comment: What Chelsea are exceptional at is recycling possession.\n45:32 Comment: When they've had one attack, the ball comes back out,\n45:35 Comment: they're first to the next ball, and they win it again,\n45:38 Comment: so they recycle it and they keep the pressure on.\n45:40 Comment: It's wave after wave after wave of attack,\n45:43 Comment: and that's eventually what breaks you down.\n45:45 Comment: FANS ROAR\n45:51 Comment: Again there, they put the pressure on, they win the ball,\n45:54 Comment: and suddenly the ball's back in their hands.\n45:57 Comment: Ayoub.\n45:59 Comment: Lawson.\n46:2 Comment: That's nicely worked by Sigurdsson.\n46:4 Comment: Cork.\n46:6 Comment: Chances to be a little expansive here.\n46:9 Comment: Taylor for Monteiro.\n46:11 Comment: Again, Ivanovic on the back foot.\n46:13 Comment: Jefferson Monteiro.\n46:15 Comment: Bullied off it by Matic.\n46:17 Comment: And Willian can set off and go, or would have done\n46:20 Comment: had he not been cynically hauled back by Jack Cork,\n46:23 Comment: who must expect a booking.\n46:25 Comment: I have to say, that's actually a clever foul by Jack Cork.\n46:29 Comment: He's taken one for the team,\n46:31 Comment: cos if Willian gets away there and gets running,\n46:34 Comment: Jack Cork's certainly not going to catch him,\n46:37 Comment: and then Chelsea are running at the back two, back three.\n46:45 Comment: FANS ROAR\n46:47 Comment: Nicely done by Hazard.\n46:49 Comment: Kept alive by Oscar.\n46:51 Comment: FANS ROAR\n46:59 Comment: Hazard.\n47:3 Comment: Tidy from Cork.\n47:4 Comment: And he's this time on the receiving end.\n47:7 Comment: FANS ROAR\n47:9 Comment: APPLAUSE\n47:11 Comment: WHISTLE BLOWS\n47:13 Comment: Shelby from quarter-back.\n47:15 Comment: Gomis offside.\n47:17 Comment: FANS ROAR\n47:19 Comment: Might have had a goal or two in this first half.\n47:21 Comment: Baffa, Tembe, Gomis.\n47:23 Comment: FANS ROAR\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: the crowd is still on their feet here, competitive juices are flowing again\n0:3 Comment: they played some really cohesive football at times in the first half\n0:9 Comment: and whilst they had that momentary wobble\n0:13 Comment: they've broadly speaking been in charge, so Swansea have it all to do\n0:18 Comment: and here's Montero\n0:22 Comment: De Niro, Vovanovic and then he had his ankle tapped\n0:25 Comment: and the first free kick of the second half is a Swansea free kick\n0:30 Comment: opportunity, I think Montero provides the biggest\n0:33 Comment: threat for Swansea, Ayew has been bright and lively, obviously has got his goal\n0:38 Comment: so that they do have a an attacking threat, I think if they're going to have\n0:42 Comment: any success, get Montero high up the pitch, get him\n0:46 Comment: the ball and let him run at Ivanovic\n0:51 Comment: of course Sigurdsson is capable from this range, Jonjo Shelby likewise\n0:55 Comment: will be a fantastic player\n1:0 Comment: Sigurdsson, it was who scored the winner in Old Trafford\n1:4 Comment: in the opening day of last season\n1:10 Comment: an impact perhaps of a similar type here at the home of the champions\n1:15 Comment: Dolphy Sigurdsson, it's looped up off the wall and\n1:19 Comment: Swansea have a corner\n1:22 Comment: didn't quite get the same fortune as Chelsea got in the first half, but they\n1:25 Comment: first half of that William shot deflected of Fernandes and looping into\n1:30 Comment: the far corner he's got an exciting year ahead Gorky Sigurdsson Iceland look as\n1:34 Comment: though they're gonna qualify for Euro 2016 their first major international\n1:39 Comment: tournament\n1:42 Comment: Shelby's ball in, Gomez can't find space there was just nowhere to go and Oster\n1:49 Comment: scrapes it away second third real good chance of Bafidemir Gomez just hesitated\n1:55 Comment: yet again terrific from Montero against Ivanovic behind for another corner\n2:1 Comment: Ivanovic did all he could to keep his hands out the way at some personal\n2:6 Comment: expense I think\n2:10 Comment: Diego Costa misses that first opportunity and Gomez he just hesitates\n2:16 Comment: doesn't quite make his mind up\n2:18 Comment: early on\n2:19 Comment: enough and that gives the Chelsea defenders just that fraction of a\n2:22 Comment: second to make a block good start to the second half from Swansea Shelby's\n2:29 Comment: corner\n2:32 Comment: headed over by Fernandes who is still to score his first goal for the Swans\n2:37 Comment: having in the first half notched one inadvertently against them well that's a\n2:43 Comment: couple of chances from set pieces that Swansea have had they had one in the\n2:46 Comment: first half Ivanovic\n2:48 Comment: got left a win today Gomez got across him at the near post\n2:52 Comment: unlike Chelsea so far defensively they've given away probably four or five\n2:58 Comment: half chances which is very unlike them there is just a hint of vulnerability\n3:4 Comment: which is part of what makes the contest\n3:9 Comment: so engaging. Fabregas\n3:13 Comment: There are a lot of players here who are hoping that this will be the first day of an 11-month\n3:21 Comment: season which might climax in their national colours in Paris 10th, 11th of July with the\n3:29 Comment: final of Euro 2016.\n3:31 Comment: It's one of those marathon years.\n3:37 Comment: Romis, Ayew, Shelby, Montero, Taylor, Cork, Montero, around Ivanovic but not past Fabregas\n4:4 Comment: and it's another Swansea corner.\n4:7 Comment: Another opportunity to whip this ball into the danger area.\n4:14 Comment: Chelsea normally so strong, so powerful and dominant from set pieces have looked a little\n4:19 Comment: bit tentative.\n4:20 Comment: They're urged on by a typically vocal Welsh gathering behind that goal.\n4:25 Comment: Swansea passionately followed.\n4:30 Comment: Shelby to the near post, he hit the near post, Sigurdsson followed up and crashed it into\n4:35 Comment: the crowd.\n4:36 Comment: That's a good one.\n4:37 Comment: I think it just caught everybody by surprise that the ball didn't look like it was particularly\n4:52 Comment: well struck and as it almost came into the box it looked like it was almost in slow motion.\n4:58 Comment: Free kick against Costa.\n5:1 Comment: That's a well done by the Chelsea keeper.\n5:4 Comment: That's a good one.\n5:8 Comment: Wobbly first five minutes of the second half for the Barclays Premier League champions at\n5:12 Comment: home here.\n5:13 Comment: There's Ayew testing that to Likweta.\n5:17 Comment: Leaning away from Matic.\n5:19 Comment: Cork.\n5:20 Comment: And again Jack Cork.\n5:25 Comment: Tipped over the azard.\n5:31 Comment: But again, players jumping up quite quickly.\n5:35 Comment: Not really making any progress.\n5:36 Comment: Not really making anything of any of the challenges or any of the fouls so far.\n5:40 Comment: Let's hope this is really a case in point and continues for the rest of the season.\n5:46 Comment: Shelby.\n5:47 Comment: Too much loft for Khabib.\n5:52 Comment: Wasted this time from Shelby.\n5:54 Comment: But this is the corner.\n5:56 Comment: It comes in.\n5:57 Comment: Costa's there again.\n5:58 Comment: See the post that it hits.\n6:0 Comment: I'm not quite sure.\n6:1 Comment: If that had been six inches further to the right that Courtois would have been able to get it.\n6:4 Comment: The fact that he was diving backwards.\n6:7 Comment: I think that was deliberate.\n6:8 Comment: No I don't.\n6:9 Comment: The way that the ball came in.\n6:11 Comment: It looked like a little bit of a miss hit.\n6:13 Comment: Didn't look like he hit it particularly cleanly.\n6:15 Comment: Costa.\n6:16 Comment: Willian.\n6:18 Comment: That's out nicely for Taylor.\n6:23 Comment: Monteiro.\n6:24 Comment: Gomis.\n6:25 Comment: Monteiro.\n6:26 Comment: Sigurdsson.\n6:27 Comment: Shelby.\n6:28 Comment: Lifted over the top for Gomis.\n6:29 Comment: That's a good one.\n6:33 Comment: Lifted over the top for Gomis.\n6:34 Comment: Flag has stayed down.\n6:35 Comment: It's back for Gomis.\n6:36 Comment: Met by Courtois.\n6:37 Comment: Penalty.\n6:38 Comment: I think yellow card before he pulls it out of his pocket.\n6:43 Comment: It's red.\n6:44 Comment: Thibaut Courtois walks.\n6:49 Comment: Champions down to ten.\n6:51 Comment: Mourinho with a problem and a frown.\n6:53 Comment: Swansea with a penalty.\n6:55 Comment: Game changer.\n6:56 Comment: Third time that Gomis has got in behind Terry and Cahill.\n7:1 Comment: He's just peeled off a couple of times.\n7:2 Comment: Lost his man and they're running behind.\n7:3 Comment: You just see here.\n7:4 Comment: He's just got in behind.\n7:5 Comment: In between the two.\n7:6 Comment: Cahill doesn't know where he is.\n7:7 Comment: Ivanovic puts his hand up for offside.\n7:8 Comment: I don't think that's a goalscoring opportunity.\n7:9 Comment: It may even be outside the box.\n7:10 Comment: I was going to say, if the line decision is an important one, in or out of the box, it's\n7:11 Comment: marginal.\n7:12 Comment: I think he has a touch away from goal.\n7:13 Comment: My understanding of the law is the ball has to be moving goalwards, denied to the right.\n7:14 Comment: It's a goal.\n7:25 Comment: I think he has a touch away from goal.\n7:29 Comment: My understanding of the law is the ball has to be moving goalwards, denying a clear and\n7:33 Comment: obvious goalscoring opportunity.\n7:35 Comment: I'm not sure with his next touch that that would have been a goalscoring opportunity,\n7:40 Comment: the fact that he's gone wide.\n7:43 Comment: Melodrama at the home of the champions on the opening day of the Barclays Premier League\n7:47 Comment: season.\n7:48 Comment: Comice is going to have to wait here whilst Chelsea establish who is going to give way\n7:54 Comment: in order to afford Asmir Begovic a Chelsea debut.\n7:59 Comment: Meantime, John Terry has become engaged in conversation with the official Harry Leonard.\n8:10 Comment: And the Chelsea captain has been booked.\n8:13 Comment: Oscar is the sacrifice.\n8:16 Comment: And here is Asmir Begovic, who finished last year with Stoke City on the wrong end of the\n8:24 Comment: line.\n8:24 Comment: On the right end of a 6-1 thrashing of Liverpool.\n8:29 Comment: He was in the Stokes side that beat Swansea last October and conceded a Wilfred Boney\n8:37 Comment: penalty.\n8:38 Comment: What a debut for Asmir Begovic.\n8:40 Comment: He's either going to be a hero or picking the ball out the back of the net.\n8:45 Comment: It's been a long wait for Donovan.\n8:54 Comment: He's got a real test of nerve.\n8:55 Comment: What a big moment for Asmir Begovic.\n8:57 Comment: What a big moment for Bafa Comice, who equalises for Swansea.\n9:7 Comment: Now then, champions, what have you got?\n9:11 Comment: 11 against 10.\n9:13 Comment: Comice has Swansea level.\n9:17 Comment: High drama at the bridge.\n9:21 Comment: On opening day.\n9:23 Comment: Cool casual penalty.\n9:25 Comment: Didn't change his mind.\n9:27 Comment: Begovic guesses the wrong way.\n9:29 Comment: Not an awful lot he can do about that, you know, coming straight on.\n9:32 Comment: But this is the problem.\n9:33 Comment: This has happened a couple of times.\n9:35 Comment: There's a chameleon that is deep playing everybody onside.\n9:38 Comment: But that's the third time that Comice has got in.\n9:43 Comment: Now, you'll remind me of the law.\n9:45 Comment: The line is inside or outside?\n9:47 Comment: It's in, isn't it?\n9:49 Comment: Is it?\n9:50 Comment: That's why I'm reminded of the law.\n9:55 Comment: Well, here is Comice.\n9:59 Comment: Ayew.\n10:0 Comment: Comice.\n10:3 Comment: Winning the Swansea sale.\n10:4 Comment: Well done.\n10:5 Comment: Norton.\n10:6 Comment: Cahill away.\n10:8 Comment: Norton again.\n10:9 Comment: Ayew.\n10:19 Comment: But I must say, before discussing the colour of the card,\n10:23 Comment: my first query was over the line decision.\n10:26 Comment: Michael Oliver seemed immediately sure.\n10:29 Comment: Ivanovic.\n10:33 Comment: Chelsea vulnerable.\n10:34 Comment: Having lost the first half here.\n10:36 Comment: Willian.\n10:42 Comment: Fabregas.\n10:46 Comment: High from Fernandes.\n10:48 Comment: Willian.\n10:55 Comment: Fabregas.\n10:58 Comment: And out walks Fernandes.\n11:0 Comment: Comice.\n11:4 Comment: I expect to hear an awful lot about penalties in the press conferences from both managers.\n11:8 Comment: Of course, the one that wasn't given on Diego Costa,\n11:11 Comment: that we only really got to see twice.\n11:14 Comment: It wasn't shown an awful lot even on the replays.\n11:16 Comment: And then, obviously, the one that was just given against Thibaut Courtois.\n11:19 Comment: Montero.\n11:24 Comment: Didn't locate Sigurdsson.\n11:26 Comment: Now, if you're in the Swansea dugout now, Danny Mills, what are you thinking?\n11:30 Comment: Are you thinking, be brave?\n11:32 Comment: This is a game we've got to have the guts to go and try and win.\n11:35 Comment: Challenge on Costa.\n11:36 Comment: No free kick.\n11:38 Comment: Williams got away with that.\n11:39 Comment: Michael Oliver is the villain of the piece here.\n11:45 Comment: I think if you're sat there now, 2-2 is a fantastic result away to Chelsea.\n11:50 Comment: I think you have to play it a little bit cagey.\n11:52 Comment: You know, you're against the ten men.\n11:55 Comment: You know they have players that can hurt you.\n11:57 Comment: They're very, very dangerous players.\n12:0 Comment: You play tight and you wait for your opportunity.\n12:3 Comment: You will get a couple of opportunities.\n12:5 Comment: You just have to wait and be patient.\n12:6 Comment: Don't chase the game.\n12:11 Comment: So what about Chelsea?\n12:13 Comment: Do they dare to chase the game or do they wait their moment?\n12:16 Comment: Because they'll get a moment too.\n12:17 Comment: Oh, they will.\n12:19 Comment: Mourinho will tell you, you cannot win the Premier League in August.\n12:24 Comment: But if you don't have a very good August, you can go a long, long way to not winning it.\n12:28 Comment: You know, and that's the problem.\n12:29 Comment: This is just a draw.\n12:30 Comment: So at the moment, it's no big problem at the moment for Chelsea.\n12:33 Comment: And Harry Leonard there, the assistant on the far side, is the one who may have whispered in Michael Oliver's ear\n12:41 Comment: in respect of the line decision, which side of the line was it, penalty or free kick?\n12:46 Comment: Michael Oliver will have had to decide the colour of the card.\n12:53 Comment: Monteiro leading away from Ivanovic and having a crack.\n12:57 Comment: And Degovic makes his first Chelsea save.\n13:3 Comment: Gomis, coaxed out uncertainly by Fabregas.\n13:8 Comment: Recycled here for Sigurdsson.\n13:10 Comment: Set for Shelby.\n13:13 Comment: He wants to take on Terry.\n13:17 Comment: Terry stands up.\n13:19 Comment: Well, just talking about the referee, obviously John Terry got booked for his protests in that.\n13:25 Comment: Gary Monk will be delighted.\n13:27 Comment: In the first half, he wasn't 100% certain about giving the penalty on Costa.\n13:31 Comment: He didn't give it.\n13:32 Comment: This one he gave.\n13:33 Comment: So you have to think that the referee was 100% sure.\n13:36 Comment: In by Shelby.\n13:37 Comment: Swansea have never taken a Premier League point at Stamford Bridge.\n13:45 Comment: Played for, lost for here.\n13:46 Comment: Costa.\n13:49 Comment: William.\n13:52 Comment: That's a really good committed block by Jack Corr.\n13:55 Comment: APPLAUSE\n13:57 Comment: WHISTLE BLOWS\n13:58 Comment: APPLAUSE\n14:5 Comment: GERRARD.\n14:17 Comment: That's up.\n14:19 Comment: Professor couldn't give it in back.\n14:20 Comment: GERRARD.\n14:24 Comment: Just over 30 minutes left, Mourinho must start to think about,\n14:29 Comment: when do I make the substitution?\n14:32 Comment: Who do I bring on? Do I bring on Remy, Falcao?\n14:35 Comment: Putting them both on?\n14:36 Comment: That's what will be going through his mind right now.\n14:39 Comment: This is his 99th home game in the Premier League\n14:43 Comment: with Chelsea's Jose Mourinho.\n14:45 Comment: He's lost one of them.\n14:48 Comment: He is certainly vulnerable now.\n14:54 Comment: The game has caused Chelsea to take on a certain fragility.\n15:2 Comment: It is tantalisingly poised.\n15:4 Comment: Montero.\n15:5 Comment: We've got nine months of this ahead, we'll settle for it.\n15:14 Comment: Lifted back in by Williams.\n15:16 Comment: One aerially by Azpilicueta, came to Fernandes.\n15:20 Comment: Nick Ford for Cork, who's left it for Sigurdsson,\n15:22 Comment: lovely take and turn from Sigurdsson.\n15:24 Comment: Now Montero.\n15:25 Comment: Jefferson, Montero, and...\n15:28 Comment: Pegavic got big in his near post.\n15:32 Comment: Great opportunity from Montero, in the end a decent shot,\n15:35 Comment: I think he should have hit it early.\n15:37 Comment: Go now, left foot, drive it towards the far post.\n15:41 Comment: It gives Pegavic the opportunity to set himself,\n15:44 Comment: and then very difficult to squeeze that in at the near post.\n15:46 Comment: APPLAUSE\n15:48 Comment: And then a good shot by Mourinho.\n15:50 Comment: That's the end of the match.\n15:56 Comment: Shelby's corner and Pegavic was nearly outfoxed by another Shelby in-swinger.\n16:1 Comment: I think Shelby's clearly trying to put it right under the bar\n16:6 Comment: on the goalkeeper's head.\n16:8 Comment: Players tumbling, I don't think he's going for goal.\n16:10 Comment: Shelby this time for Cork.\n16:13 Comment: Drifted up towards Fernandes, lifted in towards Ayew,\n16:18 Comment: and Pegavic takes charge.\n16:19 Comment: And gets rid in a hurry.\n16:21 Comment: That's too much for Mourinho.\n16:23 Comment: That's too much for Mourinho. That's too much for Mourinho.\n16:23 Comment: That's too much for Mourinho.\n16:28 Comment: Chelsea have got plenty of time.\n16:30 Comment: No need for them to panic, just keep playing their usual game.\n16:33 Comment: Yes, they might be a man down, but they have the talent,\n16:35 Comment: they have the ability to still create and eke out chances.\n16:39 Comment: On the day the Premier League soap opera resumes,\n16:47 Comment: we have the first really substantial plot twist here.\n16:53 Comment: So, what's the final score?\n16:55 Comment: Well, it's 2-0, and they're going to be down by 16.\n16:58 Comment: They're going to be down by 16.\n17:1 Comment: You can hear the Welsh voices.\n17:8 Comment: Resonating from out of the valley in the shed,\n17:12 Comment: Monteiro, Sigurdsson...\n17:14 Comment: Monterey, Sigurdsson...\n17:18 Comment: Fernandes, Cork...\n17:22 Comment: Fernandes, Cork, Sigurdsson,\n17:27 Comment: shifted up to Gomez, who got it all wrong.\n17:32 Comment: But he's believing now.\n17:34 Comment: On another day, might have had a hat-trick,\n17:36 Comment: he does have the goal that's broken his duck for the year now from the spot.\n17:39 Comment: But again, look, he's just running off the back.\n17:41 Comment: This is the goal, or the opportunity that leads to the penalty.\n17:45 Comment: He just runs off the back of Blaise, that's the third time he's done that.\n17:49 Comment: It's very, very difficult to tell whether that's inside,\n17:52 Comment: whether that's outside.\n17:53 Comment: Look at the referee's position.\n17:55 Comment: The referee's got no chance of spotting that.\n17:57 Comment: And I think, look, the ball is going away from goal.\n17:59 Comment: Cahill is coming back around.\n18:1 Comment: That's why I think it's a yellow card.\n18:4 Comment: But the big debate is going to be whether it was inside\n18:7 Comment: or whether it was outside.\n18:9 Comment: By the time we get technology and slow motions\n18:11 Comment: and virtual reality lines, we might have a clear view.\n18:17 Comment: But if the referee and linesman aren't 100% sure, they can't give that.\n18:21 Comment: But, oh, fair play to Gomez.\n18:22 Comment: He did his job, put the ball away.\n18:25 Comment: Montero.\n18:27 Comment: Gomez, Shelby.\n18:30 Comment: I can tell you, Michael Oliver has not had a quiet week.\n18:32 Comment: He was in charge of a Champions League qualifier in Norway on Tuesday.\n18:36 Comment: He finished Mulder 3, Dinamo Zagreb 3.\n18:39 Comment: He gave three penalties and one red card.\n18:43 Comment: And it's not got a whole lot quieter here.\n18:46 Comment: He's clearly missed football over the summer.\n18:48 Comment: Yeah.\n18:52 Comment: Just a tweak in Chelsea's formation.\n18:57 Comment: They've effectively gone 4-3-2 with Costa and Hazard up front.\n19:11 Comment: That's the money man thinking, the supporter-in-chief,\n19:15 Comment: Abramovich, who expects to win at home.\n19:18 Comment: Chelsea just do win at home.\n19:22 Comment: Nobody beat them here in the Premier League last season,\n19:25 Comment: only Bradford, shockingly, in the FA Cup.\n19:28 Comment: Ivanovic and Willian.\n19:31 Comment: Away by Fernandes, who, despite the blip of that slightly cruel own goal,\n19:36 Comment: has looked essentially solid.\n19:42 Comment: Ivanovic, too much for Costa, but he'll be first to fetch.\n19:50 Comment: It's bizarre how we think, isn't it?\n19:52 Comment: Chelsea 2-2, Chelsea were 2-1 up,\n19:54 Comment: and we're almost talking like Chelsea have lost it already, it's incredible.\n19:58 Comment: You just don't expect them from that position to lose another goal.\n20:2 Comment: Hazard.\n20:5 Comment: Matic.\n20:6 Comment: For everything in sport, certainly professional sport,\n20:8 Comment: everything is relative to expectation.\n20:12 Comment: And you just expect Chelsea to win here.\n20:15 Comment: Foul by Shelby.\n20:21 Comment: Stamberg has downed.\n20:22 Comment: And it's a goal from Fabregas.\n20:30 Comment: Fabregas over the dead ball, 25 minutes to play.\n20:35 Comment: As the sun goes down over Stamford Bridge.\n20:40 Comment: Fabregas plays it in, and Ivanovic with the header over.\n20:48 Comment: So dangerous from this position. Brilliant ball in from Fabregas.\n20:51 Comment: Fabregas plays it in, and Ivanovic with the header over.\n20:53 Comment: So dangerous from this position. Brilliant ball in from Fabregas.\n20:55 Comment: But look at that.\n20:56 Comment: Almost four Chelsea players against one Swansea player.\n20:59 Comment: And then there's absolutely no chance.\n21:1 Comment: A little bit more quality from Ivanovic.\n21:3 Comment: And that's 3-2 back in the league.\n21:7 Comment: Certainly one of those defenders who scores a goal,\n21:9 Comment: certainly one of those defenders who scores a goal,\n21:11 Comment: four in the Premier League last year,\n21:13 Comment: as well as one in the League Cup semi-final.\n21:15 Comment: As well as one in the League Cup semi-final.\n21:17 Comment: And a tight Champions League tie against Paris Saint-Germain in Paris.\n21:21 Comment: He tends to score really important goals as well, doesn't he?\n21:23 Comment: You know, not just the odd goal.\n21:25 Comment: You know, three or four a season, whatever it may be,\n21:28 Comment: but at crucial times.\n21:30 Comment: You know, three or four a season, whatever it may be,\n21:31 Comment: but at crucial times.\n21:33 Comment: Kork, Shelby.\n21:35 Comment: I wonder if Swansea got the pluck.\n21:37 Comment: Shelby's inclined.\n21:39 Comment: The shot hit Gomis.\n21:41 Comment: If shot indeed it was.\n21:43 Comment: Taken back by Kork.\n21:47 Comment: Sigurdsson, Kork. Spooned right over.\n21:49 Comment: Spooned right over. Spooned right over.\n21:50 Comment: It's a side for Montero.\n21:54 Comment: Taylor.\n21:56 Comment: Taylor. Shelby.\n22:0 Comment: Toying with Fabregas.\n22:3 Comment: Neatly in for Taylor.\n22:4 Comment: Goodies!\n22:6 Comment: Flags up.\n22:10 Comment: Was a very, very late flag from the official.\n22:15 Comment: He looked offside.\n22:17 Comment: We'll see now on the replay whether it was or not.\n22:21 Comment: Just.\n22:22 Comment: Just offside.\n22:23 Comment: But the flag went up very, very late.\n22:25 Comment: Probably half of the ball had hit the back of the net.\n22:29 Comment: Chelsea fans with, well, hearts and mouths for a moment.\n22:32 Comment: I think he knew.\n22:34 Comment: It was a half smile, a sort of admission of guilt.\n22:39 Comment: Harry Leonard, as Danny Mills rightly said,\n22:41 Comment: gave himself a heartbeat.\n22:43 Comment: A moment to think and be sure.\n22:45 Comment: He's certainly been in the game, the assistant on that far side.\n22:50 Comment: Beyond question he got that one right.\n22:56 Comment: .\n23:1 Comment: No problem for Swansea here.\n23:3 Comment: Jefferson Monteiro, who's had, as we mentioned in the first half,\n23:6 Comment: a really good game when on the front foot.\n23:9 Comment: He's feeling a bit of cramp.\n23:12 Comment: Tend to see that on the opening day, especially when it's warm.\n23:16 Comment: .\n23:45 Comment: . .\n24:13 Comment: Radamel Falcao is one of those.\n24:20 Comment: Chelsea's new number nine.\n24:27 Comment: Just a quick clarification.\n24:29 Comment: The line is inside the penalty area.\n24:33 Comment: According to my research from the internet.\n24:37 Comment: Ivanovic.\n24:40 Comment: I believe we've got that right.\n24:42 Comment: William.\n24:44 Comment: Away from Williams, but not from Fernandes.\n24:51 Comment: That makes me more inclined, as I wasn't at the time to believe,\n24:55 Comment: that it might just have been right to call that a penalty,\n24:57 Comment: though there's still a long way short of certainty.\n25:5 Comment: I think Jose might argue otherwise.\n25:8 Comment: Quite.\n25:9 Comment: Ivanovic with a hefty throw.\n25:11 Comment: Cahill with a hefty challenge.\n25:13 Comment: Well, there's no penalty.\n25:16 Comment: Here we go.\n25:20 Comment: Good.\n25:23 Comment: Cahill.\n25:23 Comment: Good push.\n25:26 Comment: Quihin.\n25:27 Comment: Off to Laurel.\n25:28 Comment: Good edges.\n25:30 Comment: Man.\n25:34 Comment: What a night, against another sort of well-aimed pal,\n25:38 Comment: Awhere the two lines go,\n25:40 Comment: More전�,\n25:41 Comment: Marcos.\n25:42 Comment: Seiten.\n25:42 Comment: Cleo.\n25:43 Comment: Salvo.\n25:43 Comment: Zez stick.\n25:43 Comment: when he had the ball at his toes and was running at Ivanovic.\n25:48 Comment: Routledge, another, who likes to skip at a full-back\n25:51 Comment: and create a problem.\n25:53 Comment: Going forward, he was very, very good.\n25:55 Comment: You know, Ivanovic didn't really have an answer to his pace,\n25:59 Comment: knocking the ball past him and running.\n26:1 Comment: And I just wonder, you know,\n26:3 Comment: Gomez has got in two or three times behind Terry and Cahill.\n26:7 Comment: Ivanovic, you know, has had one or two problems\n26:10 Comment: with the pace of Montero running at him.\n26:11 Comment: But is this just an opportunity for other sides to think,\n26:15 Comment: you know, this Chelsea back line is ageing?\n26:17 Comment: Get the ball in behind them, get them turned,\n26:19 Comment: might just cause them a problem or two.\n26:23 Comment: William.\n26:28 Comment: That's hard.\n26:34 Comment: Holding for Fabregas, Williams continued his run.\n26:41 Comment: And Taylor got rid.\n26:45 Comment: A little bit surprised there isn't a bit more movement\n26:48 Comment: on the Chelsea bench at the moment.\n26:53 Comment: Just lost their way a little bit, I think.\n26:56 Comment: Maybe that we see Falcao before very long.\n27:1 Comment: This was a fairly vigorous warm-up.\n27:4 Comment: That's Pellequeta with the throw.\n27:6 Comment: Aimed at Costa, flicked out by Shelby.\n27:9 Comment: First involvement now for Routledge.\n27:11 Comment: Come on us, Swan mirror!\n27:17 Comment: From Taylor, fabulous pace here for Comice.\n27:21 Comment: First time Chelsea really looked as though\n27:22 Comment: they were a player short in midfield.\n27:24 Comment: Shelby, Wayne Routledge.\n27:28 Comment: Routledge!\n27:34 Comment: Good save from Begovich, but again...\n27:39 Comment: He let him run in behind, and that gives\n27:40 Comment: Cahill a such grace towardsfortiness.\n27:41 Comment: problem in his then fate he's in the area he's one-on-one\n27:45 Comment: Routledge cuts back inside doesn't quite get enough in the shot but\n27:49 Comment: Chelsea at times defending hasn't been as clinical as we would usually expect\n28:6 Comment: Shelby\n28:7 Comment: Taylor\n28:24 Comment: are you shelving nicely done Taylor Sigurdsson he's found a little pocket now\n28:33 Comment: going away from Fabregas that's it Cahill clear\n28:37 Comment: Fernandes caught are you ahead of him and come east Cahill's header out\n28:56 Comment: Shelby starting to find space Cahill away Terry away William on the run\n29:5 Comment: Costa up ahead of him Fabregas square\n29:7 Comment: Hazard square the other way Eden Hazard running at Taylor for Chelsea\n29:13 Comment: Hazard\n29:16 Comment: belted against Fabianski who just stood his ground at the near post\n29:22 Comment: pretty much hit Fabianski rather a great save but problems for Swansea there was four on four\n29:35 Comment: there it is four on four great opportunity for Swansea to take the lead there's the opening and there's the line up at the back of the net\n29:36 Comment: Great opportunity for Chelsea. Hazard, he's got Taylor one-on-one.\n29:40 Comment: Goes down the outside, drives the ball downwards.\n29:44 Comment: I'm sure Fabianski knows too much about that.\n29:47 Comment: Hits him in the face in the end.\n29:49 Comment: You have to say, good save, doesn't matter how, as long as you keep it out.\n29:58 Comment: William.\n30:2 Comment: Running at Taylor and Routledge.\n30:4 Comment: Set back for Ivanovic, who hit it against Fabregas and behind.\n30:8 Comment: And Chelsea, far from throwing on Falcao, in an attacking manoeuvre,\n30:13 Comment: are looking to reinforce here defensively\n30:15 Comment: by sending on Kurt Zouma, presumably to hold midfield,\n30:21 Comment: instead of Cess Fabregas.\n30:26 Comment: Well, I think what we are seeing now is the true Jose Mourinho.\n30:31 Comment: Ten men, two each.\n30:34 Comment: It's just thinking, you know what, do not lose this game.\n30:38 Comment: A point is not a problem.\n30:40 Comment: Controversial possible penalty, I'll make the excuses for that, whatever it may be.\n30:45 Comment: But we've got a point.\n30:46 Comment: It's not the end of the world.\n30:48 Comment: I think that will be what will be in Jose's thinking.\n30:53 Comment: Very interesting to see what's in his thinking next Sunday,\n30:55 Comment: when of course they go to Manchester City.\n30:57 Comment: Threw by Shelby, Gomez is offside again.\n31:4 Comment: It'll be interesting to see how tight this decision is again.\n31:9 Comment: There's Gomez, he's running off the back of people.\n31:11 Comment: I think that's probably onside.\n31:15 Comment: I think Chelsea might find themselves very fortunate in that instance.\n31:21 Comment: Well, he's certainly playing with the line,\n31:23 Comment: after Timmy Gomez.\n31:28 Comment: Let's watch Chelsea's next fixture because it is one of the first giant games of the Barclays.\n31:34 Comment: Premier League season next Sunday up at the Etihad.\n31:38 Comment: And habitually, it's the sort of game that Mourinho has gone to,\n31:42 Comment: as it were, settling for the point he starts with.\n31:45 Comment: And anything else is a bonus.\n31:46 Comment: Those big away games against United and City and Arsenal.\n31:49 Comment: But if they were to drop two points here on the opening day,\n31:53 Comment: I wonder whether that would affect his mindset.\n31:55 Comment: Of course, there'll be no Thibaut Courtois.\n31:57 Comment: Begovic will keep goal.\n31:58 Comment: Jamal Blackman, one assumes, will be on the bench for Chelsea in the goalkeeping department.\n32:3 Comment: I don't know.\n32:4 Comment: I don't think it will change Mourinho's mindset at all.\n32:7 Comment: You know, two points over two games.\n32:9 Comment: Yes, he'll be disappointed.\n32:10 Comment: But you can probably only lose four, maybe five games\n32:15 Comment: if you're going to win the Premier League title.\n32:17 Comment: Mourinho knows that this Chelsea side will win enough games\n32:21 Comment: as long as they don't lose.\n32:23 Comment: And losing to Manchester...\n32:24 Comment: He'd almost prefer to lose to Swansea than he would to Manchester City.\n32:29 Comment: Matic, Zouba.\n32:31 Comment: He could beat Swansea.\n32:32 Comment: Atta.\n32:34 Comment: And Zouba scores.\n32:36 Comment: Carried out by Taylor.\n32:38 Comment: Hit early by Shelby.\n32:39 Comment: Asking a bit too much of Ayew, who applauded the idea.\n32:48 Comment: They're going to have another Swansea debutant in a moment.\n32:51 Comment: Portuguese striker Adair is preparing.\n32:54 Comment: Adair.\n33:4 Comment: Beautiful spread for Ivanovic.\n33:19 Comment: He's got away from Routledge and is worrying Taylor.\n33:24 Comment: Taylor stuck to his task.\n33:30 Comment: Routledge fell in touch.\n33:31 Comment: It's going to be interesting as the game goes on to see how deep Swansea get.\n33:37 Comment: How nervous do they get?\n33:39 Comment: Even, you know, with the draw, with their two goals and an extra man,\n33:45 Comment: I think they might just drop a little bit too deep at times,\n33:48 Comment: a little bit nervy, and that might just give Chelsea\n33:50 Comment: one or two opportunities in the last 12, 13 minutes.\n33:55 Comment: 27-year-old Adair.\n33:56 Comment: There's a five-million count capture from Braga\n34:0 Comment: in the Portuguese.\n34:1 Comment: He's scored four goals in his last three games for them,\n34:4 Comment: back end of last season.\n34:6 Comment: Reached the cup final, scored in the cup final,\n34:9 Comment: but missed his penalty in a shootout that they lost.\n34:13 Comment: He is a full Portuguese international,\n34:15 Comment: and he has replaced Bafa Gomes for the last 11 minutes plus here.\n34:31 Comment: Let's get that picture in the screen.\n34:41 Comment: F buat, let's keep it gathered.\n34:43 Comment: F stood in last with меньше無.\n34:47 Comment: F ball off the table.\n34:51 Comment: Table half watered.\n34:54 Comment: Two goals scored.\n34:55 Comment: F scored for Bayern.\n34:56 Comment: New base is big.\n34:58 Comment: Winning by St-Palastdoor.\n34:58 Comment:

    "summary": "Chelsea and Swansea contested a thrilling 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge that provided a scintillating start to the Premier League season.\n\nThe defending champions began their title defense with an air of confidence as Eden Hazard took control right from the off. Within the first few minutes, Willian, partnered by Branislav Ivanovic, surged forward, displaying Chelsea's characteristic quick counter-attacking play. Jefferson Montero, playing on the left for Swansea, made an early defensive impact by tracking back effectively, foiling Chelsea’s initial attempts to penetrate deep into the box.\n\nChelsea forced their first corner kick within the initial minutes, whipped in by Oscar. Gomes and Gary Cahill contested the aerial ball, with Cahill winning the duel. Despite the initial defensive clearance from Kyle Naughton, Ivanovic recycled the ball and Oscar sent in a cross. Diego Costa managed a difficult shot at the side netting, signaling Chelsea's attacking intent.\n\nFrom the outset, pundits debated whether Chelsea would exhibit their early season dominance reminiscent of their previous campaign or adopt a more pragmatic approach. With a 27-match unbeaten streak in August stretching back to 2006, the champions looked to exert early pressure on Swansea.\n\nChelsea's high pressing game ensured that Swansea’s attempts to build from the back were consistently thwarted. The relentless pressing from Costa, Hazard, and Willian meant Swansea found creating space a substantial challenge. Hazard's continued dynamism brought him head-to-head with Andre Ayew, with the Belgian winger out-maneuvering the Ghanaian before being checked by Naughton, necessitating a timely clearance by Ashley Williams.\n\nAs Chelsea settled into their rhythm, they effectively neutralized Swansea's formations, turning every defensive rebound into a potential offensive assault. Swansea's Ki Sung-yueng showed echoes of his prior season’s form with careful possession and precise passing but was repeatedly stymied by Chelsea’s midfield marshaled by Nemanja Matic and Cesc Fabregas. \n\nThroughout the first 20 minutes, notable passages of play emerged between Chelsea’s forward line and Fabregas. The Spanish playmaker orchestrated numerous attacks, demonstrating why he managed a commendable tally of assists the prior season. Hazard, maneuvering past numerous challenges, laid off to Costa, producing a delightful passage of one-touch, intricate football, although ultimately intercepted by Lukasz Fabianski.\n\nMontero remained Swansea’s most reliable outlet, repeatedly venturing past Ivanovic, showcasing his pace and dribbling. However, Chelsea's robust defense, particularly through Terry and Cahill, denied Swansea clear-cut chances. Nevertheless, Montero’s crossing left the Chelsea defense slightly unsettled, illustrating Swansea’s capability on the counter.\n\nOn 27 minutes, Chelsea's early dominance bore fruit. Oscar, showing precision from set-pieces, delivered a free-kick from a promising area. A seemingly straightforward delivery was left untouched as it drifted towards the far post, outwitting Fabianski. The ball nestled into the net, granting Chelsea the lead and justifying their ascendancy.\n\nSwansea's response was marked by deterred aggressiveness. Montero continued troubling Ivanovic down the left, creating an avenue instead for Ki and Jonjo Shelvey to exploit centrally. Moments before the halftime mark, Montero whipped in a cross that led to Ayew scoring on his debut. Keen reactions from Ayew saw him first have a shot blocked by Courtois before calmly dispatching the rebound, injecting renewed vigor into the Swansea bench.\n\nAny hope of a level playing field was short-lived. Merely 92 seconds post-Ayew’s goal, Chelsea reclaimed their lead. Willian's speculative cross took an unfortunate deflection off Federico Fernandez and looped deceptively over Fabianski into the far corner. Such strokes of misfortune underscored the cruel nature of football, placing Swansea back in a disadvantaged position.\n\nWith the first half near its conclusion, Costa remarkably avoided defense's reaches to receive a clipped ball from Fabregas. His contest with Ashley Williams resulted in an animated appeal for a penalty call, which referee Michael Oliver dismissed. The ensuing moments saw Matic release Hazard on the counter. Taylor's robust, yet fair challenge nullified what seemed a promising Chelsea onslaught.\n\nInto the second half, the game resumed with the atmosphere still vibrant. Fabregas and Costa renewed their relentless pressing on Swansea's back line, ensuring little respite. Knowing they trailed, Montero extensively tested Ivanovic one-on-one, earning several corners for his side through sheer tenacity. Bafetimbi Gomis squandered chances bred from such corners, showing hesitancy when conviction was required.\n\nThe game turned dramatically on the hour mark. Gomis latched onto Montero's deft ball, breaching Chelsea's high-line to face Courtois. The Chelsea goalkeeper rushed out, clattering into Gomis—a penalty ensued. The dramatic scene was compounded by Courtois' direct red card, reducing Chelsea to ten men. Asmir Begovic came on, replacing Oscar to assume immediate pressure. Displaying ice-cold nerves, Gomis dispatched the spot-kick confidently, leveling the scores.\n\nAs Chelsea adapted without Courtois, Mourinho's tactical reshuffle saw Hazard and Costa pegged ahead to capitalize on counter-attacking opportunities. Swansea, emboldened by numerical superiority, controlled possession primarily through Shelvey's distribution and Sigurdsson’s probing passes.\n\nGomis, despite getting in behind Chelsea's defense multiple times, found himself flagged offside as the assistant referee stayed vigilant. Chelsea's defense appeared momentarily fragile but not conceding further. Chelsea’s tenacity, symbolized through Hazard’s dazzling dribbles and Costa’s aggressive forward pressing, kept hopes alive.\n\nWilliam and Ivanovic's successive combination threatened Swansea intermittently, although Shelby remained a constant disruptor. The introduction of Radamel Falcao for Chelsea signaled Mourinho’s intent to possibly seize a late winner. Swansea's counter involved substitute Routledge occasionally getting in behind Ivanovic, emphasizing potential chinks in Chelsea's defensive armor.\n\nWith time trickling, Chelsea escalated urgency levels. The home fans’ roars multiplied attempts in the dying minutes. Diego Costa's complaints over non-awarded free-kicks further energized the tense atmosphere. Chelsea desperately sought the winner, invoking multiple aerial assaults into Swansea's box.\n\nAs the game edged into stoppage time, tensions heightened. The likelihood of hearing Ivanovic’s iron-fisted defensive efforts or Routledge breaking unpredictably at one end remained palpable. The final whistle saw Chelsea's ten see the contest through, ensuring Swansea couldn't exploit the pockets of space left as Chelsea sought victory.\n\nMourinho will confer over missed penalty claims and defensive mishaps, yet this draw highlighted depth in character and adaptability even when hampered. Swansea, earning a valued point, glean optimism heading into the season with such resilient displays against the league’s elite.\n\nThe season unfolding promises such thrilling back-and-forth spectacles, eclipsed neither by tactical battles nor goalmouth actions. This pulsating encounter left everyone at Stamford Bridge acknowledging the Premier League's magnetic allure."
