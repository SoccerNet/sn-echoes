the club have come out and said\n1:1 Comment: there's still room for negotiation maybe in the summer\n1:5 Comment: some dependence on hands up being the manager\n1:11 Comment: John Terry pitching for that particular job but maybe one day\n1:24 Comment: not been quite his\n1:25 Comment: own self to voorícula since he came back from injury\n1:31 Comment: about a lot of Chelsea plus this is he's obviously had less protection than he\n1:35 Comment: didn't the title-winning campaign\n1:42 Comment: the criticism from home here\n1:45 Comment: this work this season energetic\n1:48 Comment: effective\n1:51 Comment: together\n1:53 Comment: mets\n1:54 Comment: gr journalist in place right now is the world's best golf solution сейчас\n1:55 Comment: clubs.\n1:57 Comment: Chelsea extending an undefeated run since letting go Jose Mourinho for ten games in all competitions.\n2:5 Comment: Manchester United have lost only one of their last eight.\n2:9 Comment: A run which started with that goalless draw home to Chelsea on December 28.\n2:15 Comment: It was a decent game too.\n2:17 Comment: The right side had chances.\n2:25 Comment: Martial, linking with Lingard.\n2:28 Comment: Now Damian.\n2:34 Comment: Lingard, nicely done.\n2:36 Comment: Fellaini, Rooney coming in, he probably would have been offside but\n2:39 Comment: Ivanovic wasn't taking that risk.\n2:41 Comment: Lingard gets it down, Carrick intervenes.\n2:44 Comment: Manchester United trying to start on the front foot here.\n2:52 Comment: Three goals in each of their last two games.\n2:54 Comment: A way to go.\n2:55 Comment: A great move by Stoke.\n2:57 Comment: Stoke in the Premier League.\n2:59 Comment: And the opening one against Stoke was created by Cameron Borkwood-Jackson\n3:2 Comment: who's put in a pretty decent cross there as well.\n3:5 Comment: Beauty wasn't it?\n3:6 Comment: Gets it on his left foot there.\n3:8 Comment: Youngster and he can deliver.\n3:9 Comment: Just Curley, then Ivanovic who doesn't do enough.\n3:12 Comment: Awkward one for Zouma.\n3:14 Comment: There's a talent now this lad.\n3:17 Comment: Good temperament too.\n3:19 Comment: That assist on Tuesday was on his 19th birthday.\n3:22 Comment: He's got a good birthday.\n3:32 Comment: You'd expect Manchester United to be confident, wouldn't you, as you said,\n3:35 Comment: Martin, they've had a good couple of performances looking much more like it.\n3:40 Comment: It has been a bright start from them.\n3:42 Comment: And Louis van Gaal saying they can still win the title.\n3:46 Comment: Yes, yes, yes.\n3:48 Comment: Martial.\n3:51 Comment: He's got his game going again.\n3:54 Comment: It will be a real challenge, you feel, to Bransan Ivanovic here.\n3:57 Comment: Yes, he's just going to suck it.\n3:59 Comment: That is a key area of the pitch.\n4:0 Comment: I think Martial is absolutely flying at the moment.\n4:3 Comment: Ivanovic has got a real challenge on his hands here.\n4:6 Comment: If the Frenchman gets enough ball...\n4:9 Comment: Ivanovic has been given a new one-year deal by Chelsea.\n4:19 Comment: And Gregor Kosovic.\n4:21 Comment: He's trying to bicycle kick that forward.\n4:23 Comment: He's trying to connect with the man behind him.\n4:28 Comment: That led to an early flash point.\n4:30 Comment: A lot of talk, of course, in the Watford game about that incident.\n4:34 Comment: I actually think it didn't reflect particularly well on players from both sides.\n4:40 Comment: Maybe it wouldn't have made so many headlines had there been more in the match.\n4:44 Comment: Chelsea, I think, have drawn too many despite this good run.\n4:49 Comment: Since he returned as an interim boss.\n4:51 Comment: Arvind Matic and Fellaini.\n4:54 Comment: That's a heavyweight clash, isn't it?\n4:56 Comment: Those two coming head-to-head.\n5:1 Comment: There's Blin.\n5:7 Comment: Hawford-Jackson.\n5:8 Comment: He's giving it a try to zoom it.\n5:10 Comment: His hands are constant now, and the right-sided centre-back burns.\n5:14 Comment: He's got a bit of a back-and-forth.\n5:18 Comment: A side-and-centre-back burn.\n5:20 Comment: With Terry or Cahill.\n5:24 Comment: But it's been Terry and Cahill for a while in the Premier League.\n5:28 Comment: That's good news for Gary Cahill.\n5:30 Comment: The Euro's coming up, of course.\n5:31 Comment: And his England players are possibly under threat.\n5:33 Comment: He's not playing for his club.\n5:46 Comment: Damian.\n5:48 Comment: Now Fellaini, past Oscar, past Fabregas.\n5:56 Comment: Oh, what a first by Davia.\n6:2 Comment: Lingard, who's in a bit of an old-fashioned look over his shoulder,\n6:6 Comment: but at the corner, there's a crude for Manchester United.\n6:10 Comment: Yeah, get away with it, it wasn't the best of balls,\n6:12 Comment: he didn't really want it in there, Lingard.\n6:14 Comment: APPLAUSE\n6:16 Comment: Chelsea, surprisingly, have conceded some headers in the Premier League this season.\n6:22 Comment: They're more used to them scoring with headers,\n6:23 Comment: with the aerial presence there has been in the team.\n6:27 Comment: FANS ROAR\n6:31 Comment: The men on the post, not many teams do that these days,\n6:33 Comment: Willian at the far.\n6:35 Comment: Touch on by Diego Costa, and that will be a corner on the opposite flank.\n6:42 Comment: Decent ball in.\n6:44 Comment: Costa just trying to flick it.\n6:46 Comment: All the way out of danger.\n6:54 Comment: Not too many forwards relish being given defensive duties.\n6:58 Comment: Diego Costa is covering the front post.\n7:2 Comment: It's a normal marking role, he just deals with any under-hit corners.\n7:6 Comment: He has done with one from the other side.\n7:10 Comment: They come in front of him.\n7:12 Comment: And here he is, able to head it away.\n7:14 Comment: And Draper did that so superbly for so many years.\n7:17 Comment: That's a shot on target from Cameron Borkut-Jackson.\n7:21 Comment: Costa in a hurry to set Chelsea on a counter-attack,\n7:25 Comment: and then realising that not all his team-mates were quite on the same wavelength.\n7:30 Comment: They do have an advantage, numerically, there.\n7:33 Comment: Chelsea United back in position,\n7:36 Comment: as they pretty much have done for most of the season defensively.\n7:40 Comment: They've been organised.\n7:42 Comment: It's going the other way.\n7:43 Comment: It's been a good game.\n7:45 Comment: The risky right-back, who was closed down by Mata.\n7:51 Comment: Smalling to David de Gea.\n7:55 Comment: Costa trying to get into his face.\n7:58 Comment: And he's...\n8:0 Comment: unable to connect with anything.\n8:3 Comment: Forward from Matic, she was well offside.\n8:8 Comment: Martial.\n8:9 Comment: Ivanovic got back.\n8:11 Comment: Got the foot in.\n8:13 Comment: Willian.\n8:14 Comment: That's Villaqueta still needing the mask.\n8:18 Comment: She had a cheek injury, or...\n8:21 Comment: double cheek injury.\n8:28 Comment: Carrick.\n8:34 Comment: That's a chance for Mata to get that down, well forward.\n8:38 Comment: Carrick out.\n8:41 Comment: Oscar needed to...\n8:42 Comment: check the right...\n8:43 Comment: back's run.\n8:44 Comment: Yeah, he stopped it that time, but Chelsea have allowed crosses to come into the box.\n8:48 Comment: From the left and the right, in this opening.\n8:51 Comment: Eight or nine minutes.\n8:53 Comment: Manchester United...\n8:55 Comment: are far the better team in the opening stages here.\n8:57 Comment: FANS ROAR\n9:0 Comment: Another corner for Chelsea to defend.\n9:4 Comment: Manchester United set a modest door on David Bin's quality.\n9:9 Comment: FANS ROAR\n9:10 Comment: On his left foot.\n9:11 Comment: Whether it's long or short.\n9:13 Comment: Back to Damian.\n9:15 Comment: A touch-on from Terry.\n9:18 Comment: Chelsea still penned back in the early minutes here at the bridge.\n9:22 Comment: FANS ROAR\n9:45 Comment: SILENT FANS ROAR\n9:45 Comment: FANS ROAR\n9:47 Comment: SILENTVERSE\n9:49 Comment: THESE SC saint brides when I was in the Beatles\n9:52 Comment: AND THEY WON IT\n9:54 Comment: SEPTEN看\n9:55 Comment: THEY WON IT\n9:56 Comment: Pятry\n9:58 Comment: to the Passing\n10:0 Comment: Couples\n10:2 Comment: It's football.\n10:3 Comment: SEPTEN\n10:5 Comment: 가지\n10:8 Comment: ARE SELFIES\n10:11 Comment: BECAUSE\n10:11 Comment: BECAUSE THEY'RE\n10:12 Comment: Yeah, they're gonna be ramping up.\n10:13 Comment: was a good idea\n10:23 Comment: so it is the duel between the very senior dutch coaches here they have what they\n10:28 Comment: both described in the past couple of days a relationship that is just professional\n10:35 Comment: not pals then i would say not powers\n10:38 Comment: incidentally back after missing the bench duty at stoke against stoke because of a family issue\n10:55 Comment: struggling to get the ball into costa at the moment chelsea\n11:4 Comment: good form goal scoring wise isn't he under hitting\n11:8 Comment: five in our six premier league games\n11:14 Comment: just been told to concentrate on what he does well as a footballer and not\n11:22 Comment: stoking up the opposition all the time\n11:30 Comment: marcia\n11:34 Comment: matter\n11:36 Comment: i honestly worked here for both of them\n11:38 Comment: to try and deliver again\n11:42 Comment: up for manchester united in these early minutes we're strong down that left-hand\n11:45 Comment: side with the youngster getting forward in support of marcial\n11:53 Comment: and again\n11:57 Comment: chelsea pulled everyone back so the fact that the central defender is taking a corner isn't\n12:1 Comment: a problem for manchester united\n12:4 Comment: the only of course is an obvious\n12:6 Comment: that's the problem for manchester united\n12:7 Comment: the only of course is an obvious\n12:8 Comment: target\n12:8 Comment: it's over him\n12:10 Comment: and a remake can volley it much better than that\n12:14 Comment: good pass though\n12:16 Comment: backed by blinn\n12:18 Comment: that's Mourinho slaving their two\n12:20 Comment: that's where diego costa is so how much else are you going to get out here\n12:26 Comment: they're not how's the answer\n12:28 Comment: blinn\n12:30 Comment: polanyi\n12:32 Comment: score 12 make sure it doesn't bounce back off him from michael carrick\n12:36 Comment: and that's the end of the match\n12:37 Comment: we'll see you next week on the pitch\n12:38 Comment: michael carrick\n12:39 Comment: Michael Carrick\n12:40 Comment: that was decent effort\n12:44 Comment: is\n12:44 Comment: this one\n12:46 Comment: chelsea haven't got\n12:48 Comment: the ability\n12:50 Comment: to counter attack\n12:51 Comment: as well without reading a czar without his place in the team\n12:59 Comment: financially of course in the champions league and\n13:2 Comment: the fa cup here against manchester city the tire\n13:5 Comment: tacken 명\n13:6 Comment: ад\n13:6 Comment: next round\n13:6 Comment: Dominant start.\n13:8 Comment: They dominated the game last April here, Manchester United,\n13:12 Comment: and lost 1-0 a couple of weeks before Chelsea went on to button up the title.\n13:19 Comment: There's a purpose to the play out here today, Manchester United.\n13:23 Comment: They might be quite threatening down these flanks.\n13:27 Comment: All four backs getting forward over the last couple of games,\n13:30 Comment: Damian being one of them.\n13:32 Comment: He used the word again that he used in the press conference on Friday,\n13:37 Comment: Louis van Gaal, when he came here today, sparkling.\n13:40 Comment: He's said about his team in the last couple of games.\n13:45 Comment: He does deny the fact that he's let them off the leash a bit.\n13:49 Comment: He's just more confident.\n13:58 Comment: Marseille certainly has sparkled in those couple of matches.\n14:2 Comment: Whatever you think about the general description of the United boss,\n14:7 Comment: who is still very much the United boss.\n14:9 Comment: There's a Marino talk, of course.\n14:12 Comment: You can understand with Pep Guardiola coming into Manchester City\n14:15 Comment: how if Louis van Gaal is going to be replaced,\n14:19 Comment: he's got one more year on his deal, so why should he be?\n14:22 Comment: Obviously, the lack of style from his team this season,\n14:29 Comment: if they don't get in their Champions League places,\n14:31 Comment: it's going to be a move for change.\n14:33 Comment: Whoever's going to set up against Guardiola is going to be able to match\n14:38 Comment: fire with fire.\n14:40 Comment: He could, of course.\n14:42 Comment: I don't think the comeback trail is there for Alex.\n14:45 Comment: Certainly cranks up the pressure, hasn't it?\n14:48 Comment: Across town at Old Trafford with Guardiola's arrival in the summer.\n14:53 Comment: Fellaini going in.\n14:56 Comment: A hint of a bit of Chelsea confusion there.\n15:1 Comment: Oh, it's a good one.\n15:3 Comment: Tops the ball, it's a good one.\n15:5 Comment: William trying to take the fight to Manchester United.\n15:8 Comment: Chelsea found it hard to do that thus far, but they've got four forward here.\n15:12 Comment: Oscar.\n15:14 Comment: He's played ten times before against today's opponents and not scored.\n15:22 Comment: Oh, William might have been offside.\n15:25 Comment: He'll have a gasp.\n15:29 Comment: They're in behind here.\n15:31 Comment: And Matic has run it behind.\n15:34 Comment: Should have done better.\n15:36 Comment: There, Matic.\n15:38 Comment: He's burst into life a little bit, Chelsea, for the first time with William at the heart of it.\n15:43 Comment: Bit of physical pressure from Fellaini and it's enough to force the miscontrol.\n15:47 Comment: He's been the player of the season, hasn't he?\n15:49 Comment: Here by some distance, really.\n15:51 Comment: Surgeon run a minute ago.\n15:57 Comment: He'll provide some legs in midfield because the real runner, the road runner,\n16:0 Comment: Ramirez, has gone very big fee to Chinese football.\n16:8 Comment: We'll hear more about players moving to big fees to that part of the world.\n16:14 Comment: But Matic is not exceptionally great. Fabregas, likewise.\n16:19 Comment: Oscar, probably likewise.\n16:24 Comment: Well, they haven't been able to get the passing going yet, Chelsea.\n16:27 Comment: So, Williams.\n16:28 Comment: They've gone forward with the ball.\n16:30 Comment: At least gave them a little bit of a threat.\n16:34 Comment: Matic.\n16:49 Comment: William.\n16:56 Comment: Here's Matic.\n16:58 Comment: Manchester United have got plenty of players forward here.\n17:1 Comment: Oh.\n17:3 Comment: It didn't really look too much support, Anthony Martial,\n17:6 Comment: who went in to score against Stoke on Tuesday.\n17:9 Comment: Well, opponents should have seen more than enough of this lad\n17:12 Comment: not to allow him to cut in and side on that right foot.\n17:15 Comment: I mean, that's a beautiful strike, and it is a top-class save from Courtois.\n17:19 Comment: It really is.\n17:22 Comment: Goal!\n17:27 Comment: Got to shove him down the line, haven't you?\n17:29 Comment: Martial, inside on his right foot.\n17:32 Comment: As you saw against Stoke, he's deadly.\n17:42 Comment: People won this time.\n17:43 Comment: Very well defended by Zouma against Fellaini.\n17:50 Comment: Chelsea, well, they're having to resort to just clearing their lines.\n17:54 Comment: Nice down by Fabregas, and Costa backed him up as well.\n18:1 Comment: William.\n18:2 Comment: Oscar.\n18:7 Comment: Looking for Costa, who was calling for the ball to be played in.\n18:18 Comment: You know, United have done what they would have wanted to.\n18:20 Comment: Frustration within Stamford Bridge.\n18:22 Comment: Fans not happy here.\n18:24 Comment: They haven't done their...\n18:25 Comment: No team has done to Chelsea.\n18:27 Comment: They haven't conceded a goal to Chelsea in the first 15 minutes of any Premier League game this season.\n18:32 Comment: Though they have conceded, so far, more goals than they did in the entire title-winning campaign.\n18:38 Comment: But they've always started reasonably solidly.\n18:45 Comment: Lingard.\n18:47 Comment: That's good movement from Manchester United.\n18:52 Comment: Farrick.\n18:54 Comment: City.\n18:55 Comment: phaene.\n19:1 Comment: tile.\n19:2 Comment: Stamford.\n19:3 Comment: Street.\n19:4 Comment: friendly strike.\n19:5 Comment: Black Nowzy na gauzig oe\n19:11 Comment: Nación, goes again.\n19:19 Comment: Right, wen Blint.\n19:22 Comment: Small one.\n19:24 Comment: Nice.\n19:24 Comment: Plenty of room to move into, and then, in the end,\n19:29 Comment: a little unsure of what the best move was from that kind of position.\n19:33 Comment: Gave the ball away, but Chelsea do likewise,\n19:35 Comment: and they just really haven't got going yet, the home team.\n19:40 Comment: Another example of poor passing.\n19:43 Comment: Lack of understanding between the players in blue.\n19:47 Comment: What a matter there you saw on the ball.\n19:48 Comment: He's picking it up in all sorts of space at times.\n19:50 Comment: Mikel Normatic can get a hold of the Spaniard,\n19:55 Comment: getting a good round of applause from his old fans here.\n19:58 Comment: I appreciate they remember what he provided.\n20:2 Comment: Handed away by Terry, flounced on by Oscar.\n20:5 Comment: Held up by Diego Costa well.\n20:8 Comment: Oscar, going to go square to William.\n20:13 Comment: A little bit too willing to push him into the overlap there\n20:17 Comment: because Marseille he's got to deal with,\n20:19 Comment: and then William has to...\n20:20 Comment: He has to go it alone and can't deliver the cross.\n20:31 Comment: It's the kind of fixture that does produce the famous faces from around the world.\n20:38 Comment: Boris Becker, of course, is a well-known football fan\n20:41 Comment: and has been a football reporter on Champions League games for German television.\n20:49 Comment: He's in tears the other day.\n20:50 Comment: I mean, Djokovic won the Australian Open.\n20:54 Comment: The coach of Djokovic now, of course.\n21:0 Comment: Nice gig to get by Wacom.\n21:2 Comment: Go!\n21:11 Comment: And from Rooney, Mata.\n21:14 Comment: He's often been parked wide by Manchester United.\n21:19 Comment: Nice to play off the front.\n21:20 Comment: Rooney.\n21:23 Comment: Marseille can play through the middle.\n21:26 Comment: Of course, as well, he's got to cross in here towards the lane in.\n21:29 Comment: Matic was in the right place there.\n21:31 Comment: It's good game intelligence from Marseille.\n21:33 Comment: He had two against one, so he's picking the right thing at the right time.\n21:37 Comment: He knew he couldn't really find a way through,\n21:39 Comment: so he just shifts it and puts the ball in the net in the box,\n21:42 Comment: and it's a good ball, too.\n21:50 Comment: Marseille is learning game craft.\n21:52 Comment: You sense that.\n21:59 Comment: He's got so much individual ability\n22:1 Comment: that he's probably relied on that to get where he is.\n22:5 Comment: Even more than that at this level,\n22:6 Comment: and he's in behind Chelsea again.\n22:10 Comment: And in the end,\n22:11 Comment: it's effort to win in the corner.\n22:12 Comment: Yeah, asleep Chelsea there from the restart.\n22:16 Comment: He's having a busy old first half of Vanavich.\n22:19 Comment: And so is Daley Glenn.\n22:20 Comment: Because he's coming forward to take these corners.\n22:26 Comment: Nearly out swing up.\n22:28 Comment: I can see it.\n22:32 Comment: One of the moments at Anfield where Glenn Cornwall is headed against the bar\n22:36 Comment: by Fellaini, and Rooney wrapped in the rebound.\n22:39 Comment: That's Smalling going for that.\n22:41 Comment: It'll be another corner.\n22:50 Comment: Looking for Marseille.\n22:52 Comment: And that's Bendis steering to a goal,\n22:56 Comment: and now it goes for Makinghurt,\n22:57 Comment: but...\n22:59 Comment: past races mentally\n23:2 Comment: in Bledsoe,\n23:4 Comment: and there's Bobby fi invoke.\n23:8 Comment: And this is the All-N�UTri guest.\n23:11 Comment: ложьšo pari....\n23:13 Comment: Marseille's wipe-off,\n23:18 Comment: Very good run by 손alic,\n23:19 Comment: but certainly the belgian didn't like the foul\n23:25 Comment: shoving the bat from small and the crowd but chelsea at the moment\n23:29 Comment: quite up against it here when you're on top you need to score\n23:38 Comment: the ninth manchester united corner again\n23:42 Comment: doesn't fall quite their way in the box in chelsea trying to find a way out\n23:46 Comment: it's been easy for them gas finding oscar\n23:52 Comment: that's been the shape of the first quarter of the game\n23:57 Comment: the shape of chelsea doesn't look the best when you look at\n24:1 Comment: william and oscar neither really going to hug the touchline\n24:6 Comment: aren't playing with too much whip and hanovich has been the greater haven't\n24:11 Comment: been able to contribute going forward as fullbacks\n24:16 Comment: when you're looking at the women's final hey betsy\n24:42 Comment: malicious\n24:43 Comment: look at small thing before the ball arrived\n24:44 Comment: got to it\n24:46 Comment: APPLAUSE\n24:50 Comment: Brilliant.\n24:55 Comment: Matic, driving on, and only trying to stay with him.\n24:59 Comment: A bit more progressive, this, from Chelsea.\n25:2 Comment: It's going to crutch up, back to Matic.\n25:5 Comment: Can Chelsea get a corner?\n25:11 Comment: It's been harder for Matic, this season, not playing with that authority.\n25:15 Comment: But he did last season.\n25:25 Comment: Brilliant to take Chelsea's first corner.\n25:31 Comment: He'd be just like John Terry to get his head on this.\n25:33 Comment: And make a headline.\n25:40 Comment: And Diego crossed that.\n25:45 Comment: He was infuriated.\n25:54 Comment: He's an experienced referee now, but he's five years younger than Terry.\n26:2 Comment: Diego Costa clearly feeling he'd been wronged, he'd been fouled.\n26:6 Comment: In that box.\n26:8 Comment: Daley Blint just leaning into him, he's got hold of his arm.\n26:18 Comment: I think this morning, he's done this so many times this season,\n26:22 Comment: but I don't think he'll get a penalty for that.\n26:24 Comment: This morning was penalised at Newcastle, wasn't it?\n26:27 Comment: Absolutely having hold of Mitrovic, he grabbed back,\n26:31 Comment: but the last grab was penalised.\n26:33 Comment: Yeah, the Blint one wasn't as obvious, was it?\n26:35 Comment: Ah.\n26:37 Comment: I think Diego Costa was letting the referee know in his own distinctive style.\n26:42 Comment: Keep an eye on what happens in future corners.\n26:46 Comment: That's supposing Chelsea get some.\n26:48 Comment: And he's doing a bit better here.\n26:57 Comment: On from Fellaini.\n26:59 Comment: That's for Lekweta.\n27:1 Comment: Tight on Lingard.\n27:7 Comment: That's a good one.\n27:13 Comment: Smaller.\n27:19 Comment: Manchester United actually going into the weekend\n27:21 Comment: committed the most fouls of any Premier League team this season.\n27:25 Comment: And they haven't had a player sent off.\n27:27 Comment: And Chelsea, the most fouled team.\n27:35 Comment: Fellaini.\n27:36 Comment: Stopped by Aspilicueta, though.\n27:38 Comment: Manchester United's attempt to make tracks.\n27:40 Comment: This time down this side, most of the attacks have come from Martial's side.\n27:46 Comment: Matic.\n27:48 Comment: Backed up by Fabregas.\n27:50 Comment: Mikel.\n27:52 Comment: Rolls it out to Willian.\n27:56 Comment: Coming on the inside is Ivanovic this time.\n27:58 Comment: So Martial went with him as he had to do.\n28:2 Comment: And it is another Chelsea corner.\n28:4 Comment: Well, I hope they need a bit of that. Don't let Chelsea get in those holes.\n28:6 Comment: They have been\n28:16 Comment: Busby Peters.\n28:18 Comment: kę\n28:21 Comment: lek\n28:33 Comment: 30\n28:35 Comment: 40\n28:36 Comment: 51\n28:36 Comment: 57\n28:36 Comment: know why really being asked to pick up the chelsea captain john terry you wouldn't see it as a natural\n28:44 Comment: little parent maybe the others will benefit anyway

He's the prime suspect to produce something William.\n0:30 Comment: So.\n0:34 Comment: Manchester United played a certain amount of style in the first half Chelsea had the better chances.\n0:43 Comment: Here's Fellaini.\n1:0 Comment: Fellaini.\n1:7 Comment: Chelsea slopping back into their defensive organization.\n1:12 Comment: Jackson wasn't able to get forward as much in the second part of the first half as he did in the first 20 minutes or so.\n1:16 Comment: Carrick.\n1:18 Comment: Rune.\n1:24 Comment: Right in front of Chelsea at the moment.\n1:30 Comment: Likewise, Rune gets his head to it.\n1:33 Comment: Those can loop in as Alan Smith knows only too well.\n1:36 Comment: It's a beautiful ball from Klaas Mata.\n1:39 Comment: Has a little bit of time to lift his head and pick his spot, which he does brilliantly.\n1:43 Comment: And Wayne Rune not quite time in the header.\n1:48 Comment: Not an easy one by any stretch.\n1:51 Comment: But it was a chance.\n2:1 Comment: Kaba Gas with a touch and Costa trying to power away here.\n2:4 Comment: Smalling recovers.\n2:6 Comment: Here comes to Matic.\n2:9 Comment: Just one strike too many.\n2:12 Comment: Telegraphed his intentions of shooting and Smalling came out to be involved in the defending again to make the block.\n2:19 Comment: there again\n2:30 Comment: I'll pick out Rune.\n2:37 Comment: Here's Zuma\n2:42 Comment: Maybe somebody breaking from the back\n2:52 Comment: Give enough a chance\n2:55 Comment: What point will be weighing up the options\n3:1 Comment: Brought him on\n3:3 Comment: What foot on Wednesday\n3:7 Comment: Concerned about the number of matches coming up and pushing hazard looking about giving him more minutes\n3:14 Comment: So guess he might get a longer out. There's a substitute here\n3:18 Comment: Goalless\n3:21 Comment: Sanja man, I'm there on the horizon in the Champions League\n3:24 Comment: once in life for that, but\n3:27 Comment: As you say played in the cup\n3:30 Comment: Keens\n3:32 Comment: Parents at Watford can't be far off now\n3:38 Comment: Perfect Jackson\n3:50 Comment: Tight room\n3:54 Comment: Interception\n3:57 Comment: We're only able to turn and let fly\n4:0 Comment: I was taking no chances as to whether that was going in or not, but he knocked it back\n4:9 Comment: Anyone following up the Manchester United might have had a real chance\n4:14 Comment: Anticipation and this is an awkward one bouncing in front of the keeper\n4:18 Comment: I've been going wide but couldn't take that chance and here comes Clinton Manchester United again\n4:24 Comment: Cleared by Oscar\n4:27 Comment: Get involved here\n4:30 Comment: Sports\n4:32 Comment: Marginally by Lingard no foul given\n4:39 Comment: Matter\n4:41 Comment: Yeah\n4:45 Comment: Go all the way here\n4:49 Comment: The angle more and more promising well handled it pretty well after that opening 15 minutes or so\n4:55 Comment: On the inside just trying to squeeze it in maybe give the keeper the eyes\n5:0 Comment: find that near post\n5:4 Comment: One across the bows towards the other side might have been the better option\n5:12 Comment: Certainly\n5:14 Comment: Positivity joining in\n5:16 Comment: Attacking third admire Martin because you think he could get exposed for pace and power\n5:20 Comment: But he's such a good leader of the game. He cropped up at Derby to score a really crucial goal on the night\n5:28 Comment: Get through\n5:34 Comment: Smalling drops for Rooney now linger matter goes outside it\n5:47 Comment: Off the

season will come from outside the penalty area\n6:19 Comment: I'm supposed to come up and work it into the United box then\n6:23 Comment: That's the La Quetta here's Terry\n6:31 Comment: To buy Fabregas sharper edge to the side of the second half\n6:39 Comment: Terry emphasizing that point\n6:43 Comment: Help win the game and maybe send a message to the border and\n6:48 Comment: Good\n7:7 Comment: Min耐 is good\n7:9 Comment: Just before half-time.\n7:10 Comment: Nice for Lainey there.\n7:16 Comment: He's been touched by Carrick.\n7:18 Comment: That's good.\n7:19 Comment: And he punished him for it.\n7:26 Comment: Damian.\n7:28 Comment: Now Lingard.\n7:31 Comment: Rooney's cross.\n7:33 Comment: Martial.\n7:35 Comment: Lingard!\n7:36 Comment: Lingard had turned away, but not out of play by Courtois.\n7:40 Comment: Driven back by Rooney, and there's a corner now.\n7:43 Comment: Well, a bit like the first half, United started this second period really well on the front foot.\n7:51 Comment: Another good save from Courtois.\n7:54 Comment: Really well, with a little bit extra this time.\n7:58 Comment: Desire in front of goal.\n8:6 Comment: Trying to block off defenders so that Kovanevic can get the run at it.\n8:16 Comment: And there he came, his way.\n8:17 Comment: And shanked away by Zouma.\n8:23 Comment: Hooked away by, dangerously, by Matic.\n8:26 Comment: And Aspen are quick to show what clearing the ball is all about.\n8:31 Comment: Well, it hasn't waited even ten minutes.\n8:38 Comment: And Hazard, called on by Husserl.\n8:42 Comment: Great swap for Oskar.\n8:47 Comment: Hazard, who scored the only goal of this fixture here last year.\n8:55 Comment: The last goal in matches between Chelsea and Manchester United.\n9:3 Comment: Well, he's obviously been a shadow of the force of last year.\n9:7 Comment: He's apologised to Jose Mourinho, hasn't he?\n9:9 Comment: Sent him a little text, which is a nice touch, I thought.\n9:12 Comment: First goal of the season in the FA Cup at Milton Keynes.\n9:16 Comment: So he'll be hoping to kick on now, these last few months of the season,\n9:20 Comment: and produce what we know he can.\n9:25 Comment: Timo Thyssen kicking ability at Courtois, which passes the test.\n9:31 Comment: Smaller.\n9:35 Comment: Too tidy from Mikel.\n9:38 Comment: Oh, he's injured himself, Zouma there.\n9:41 Comment: I wonder if he's landed awkwardly there.\n9:46 Comment: Back of the knee, top of the calf.\n9:50 Comment: That's a really sharp play.\n9:55 Comment: He kind of jumped for the ball and almost mistimed his jump.\n10:0 Comment: And then wasn't really in a position to land properly,\n10:4 Comment: that's what it seemed to me, first time of looking.\n10:18 Comment: No, that's a bit...\n10:20 Comment: Some were saying stay, and then Hazard was saying make the change.\n10:25 Comment: He just tried to come through and he said,\n10:27 Comment: oh, he just maybe overextended the knee.\n10:30 Comment: It looks really painful on that.\n10:43 Comment: One man's pain is another man's gain.\n10:46 Comment: Yes, Gary Cahill, Mike Oliver,\n10:49 Comment: indicating the structure to be brought on.\n11:1 Comment: Chelsea, as I was saying in the first half,\n11:3 Comment: have rather turned their back on the experienced pairing of Cahill and Terry.\n11:8 Comment: If this is serious for Zouma,\n11:10 Comment: he might have to see them through\n11:13 Comment: or what lies ahead over the next three months or so.\n11:17 Comment: Obviously for the players' sake,\n11:20 Comment: it's not as bad as it appeared to look.\n11:24 Comment: So, Terry and Gary Cahill was the partnership that won the league,\n11:30 Comment: that was their week in, week out.\n11:33 Comment: He's a great player.\n11:39 Comment: Right from the start of the season it was John Terry who was substituted and left out.\n11:54 Comment: The thing about young players is they have very little experience of injuries.\n12:2 Comment: Getting the proper kind of advice here.\n12:7 Comment: As you know, Chelsea have restructured some aspects of their medical department this season.\n12:12 Comment: If official is Greg Pawson getting ready to officiate the change of personnel.\n12:42 Comment: Well, they can hardly have a better man really.\n12:49 Comment: Gary Cahill has, as you say, cornerstone of the title winning side.\n12:54 Comment: He's got a new four-year deal a few days before his 30th birthday.\n12:59 Comment: Chelsea policy after 30, you only get one year.\n13:2 Comment: You tend to forget the risk that players take to entertain us.\n13:18 Comment: Sometimes the most innocuous challenges can be, not even challenges,\n13:24 Comment: but when you land awkwardly on your own.\n13:27 Comment: That's when your body can't react because you don't expect that kind of impact.\n13:34 Comment: Roy Hodgson watching here will have a chance to assess Gary Cahill for over half an hour.\n13:57 Comment: Two changes in quick succession.\n14:0 Comment: One by choice, one enforced.\n14:7 Comment: Two more for him to analyse here.\n14:10 Comment: He's on the left-hand side where you'd expect him to be.\n14:12 Comment: Chance maybe to get it to Odamian and he's bound to come inside when he gets the opportunity.\n14:18 Comment: Try and link up with Costa and Co.\n14:22 Comment: Played as a centre-back.\n14:25 Comment: He's on the left-hand side where you'd expect him to be.\n14:28 Comment: Chance maybe to get it to Odamian and he's bound to come inside when he gets the opportunity.\n14:33 Comment: Try and link up with Costa and Co.\n14:37 Comment: Played as a central striker at Old Trafford in the normal draw late December when Diego Costa was missing.\n14:47 Comment: He was missing.\n14:53 Comment: Carrick.\n14:54 Comment: He can reach Martial.\n14:56 Comment: That'll be good news for Manchester United.\n14:58 Comment: That's a brilliant goal from Jesse Lingard.\n15:8 Comment: Absolutely fantastic.\n15:13 Comment: A spin, a shot and a lead at Stamford Bridge.\n15:18 Comment: But it is sensational from the youngster, it really is.\n15:22 Comment: He had it all to do when he received this with his back to goal.\n15:26 Comment: But it's about balance, agility and awareness.\n15:31 Comment: Swing of the leg and you need a bit of luck under these circumstances just to keep it on target.\n15:38 Comment: But Courtois is not getting near this.\n15:41 Comment: He's top to wide right in the corner.\n15:44 Comment: What a finish.\n15:53 Comment: In his time, that will be one of the best moments he's had as Manchester United manager.\n15:59 Comment: Certainly arguably the best moment he's had as a Manchester United player, Jesse Lingard.\n16:3 Comment: A corker.\n16:7 Comment: It's four and nine Premier League games in this run.\n16:12 Comment: The one who's come through the ranks.\n16:13 Comment: And you might remember, Alan's been out on loan and played for Birmingham City and scored four on his debut.\n16:22 Comment: So that right for goal for midfield has been apparent.\n16:27 Comment: Now it's working out well for his parent club.\n16:31 Comment: So, after this long run without beating Chelsea, Manchester United have scored first at Stamford Bridge.\n16:41 Comment: Rooney.\n16:46 Comment: Had a great view of that.\n16:48 Comment: Would have been proud to have scored it himself.\n16:51 Comment: Yeah, he'd have enjoyed watching it, wouldn't he?\n16:53 Comment: I was impressed with his goal against Stoke actually, just popping up at the far post.\n16:57 Comment: But this was a different matter entirely.\n17:0 Comment: He would have enjoyed it more than anybody in this stadium, Jesse Lingard.\n17:11 Comment: Hit on the long half volley, and it will stay long in the memory of the scorer.\n17:23 Comment: Here's Willian.\n17:24 Comment: Chelsea going to respond here.\n17:26 Comment: Diego Costa trying to muscle his way past Daley Blind to make contact.\n17:31 Comment: And Michael Oliver has penalised Blind with the foul and the card.\n17:39 Comment: That's one of those little nudges that you try, not quite shoulder to shoulder,\n17:44 Comment: and that's why it's a foul.\n17:46 Comment: Nudge in the back.\n17:50 Comment: Tight one, but I think it was outside without question.\n17:53 Comment: Chelsea entrusting the right foot of Willian, and now is conventionally a left-footed position.\n18:11 Comment: Willian has been a star at set-pieces.\n18:15 Comment: Only wanting two in the wall from this angle.\n18:21 Comment: Chance for Chelsea to level it up.\n18:25 Comment: Good little header away.\n18:28 Comment: Header away.\n18:34 Comment: Pabregas in a hurry to take the corner.\n18:46 Comment: Whisted away by Lingard.\n18:58 Comment: Chelsea! Chelsea! Chelsea!\n19:17 Comment: Matip.\n19:18 Comment: Fellaini.\n19:21 Comment: Here's Martial inside to Nemanovic.\n19:24 Comment: Well read by Courtois, as it had to be.\n19:27 Comment: Chelsea going two down.\n19:28 Comment: Nemanovic wasn't going to catch the speed Martial.\n19:34 Comment: As he gets going, you can say goodnight.\n19:41 Comment: Another speculative effort from Lingard.\n19:48 Comment: Chelsea just didn't close down and it's bounced up so invitingly for him to try and dip one over the keeper.\n19:55 Comment: Jamie Vardy, the other night.\n20:1 Comment: Here's Mata.\n20:10 Comment: He might not make Willian, he technically did.\n20:15 Comment: No-risk manoeuvre.\n20:17 Comment: A little bit of help in the end.\n20:18 Comment: And then the young left-back can cross.\n20:20 Comment: He's very good at that.\n20:23 Comment: Just curls it round his man as he tries to beat him.\n20:26 Comment: Really capable left foot.\n20:31 Comment: I don't say they've been good value, they've been impressive.\n20:33 Comment: Here today in Manchester United.\n20:37 Comment: They do look a different proposition these days, much more excited.\n20:41 Comment: I know it's only been a couple of games but much more like it from them.\n20:46 Comment: Chelsea have now conceded as many goals at home as they've scored in the Premier League this season.\n20:50 Comment: 20.\n21:8 Comment: Willian.\n21:9 Comment: Fabregas.\n21:17 Comment: He's going to make his third change.\n21:21 Comment: This is an interesting one because when Pedro signed in the summer,\n21:25 Comment: there was a bit of a hoo-ha that Manchester United had him pinned down.\n21:30 Comment: But let him get away, let Chelsea come in and seize him.\n21:35 Comment: United know a fair bit about him because he scored against them in a Champions League final,\n21:39 Comment: of course, for Barcelona at Wembley.\n21:46 Comment: From the football games out with a calling problem.\n21:51 Comment: Fabregas just dropping back.\n21:53 Comment: It's to Mikel.\n21:56 Comment: See if Pedro takes up a central wall.\n22:5 Comment: That's the other option, is to play Hazard off the front.\n22:11 Comment: That's a sign to come across to be involved here.\n22:17 Comment: Mikel.\n22:19 Comment: Nicely worked by Willian to Fabregas.\n22:23 Comment: That's Bilacueta.\n22:27 Comment: Fantastic piece of football.\n22:29 Comment: And the volley from Ivanovic on his so-called weaker foot.\n22:34 Comment: And De Gea kept it out.\n22:37 Comment: Ivanovic could not have caught this any better when it pops up in the air.\n22:42 Comment: He really couldn't have, but Bilacueta, first half in that goal, what a stop from De Gea.\n22:49 Comment: Protecting United's lead, but they've got the corner to face now.\n22:52 Comment: Hendel trying to steer it on.\n22:54 Comment: Off by Lingard.\n23:4 Comment: Hazard.\n23:7 Comment: 1-2 with Costa.\n23:11 Comment: And Willian, Pedro going into the middle.\n23:13 Comment: There's plenty in there in blue.\n23:16 Comment: And a poor one from Willian.\n23:17 Comment: Unlucky, too easy for the keeper.\n23:19 Comment: Not so easy a couple of seconds ago.\n23:24 Comment: Ivanovic gets the form into the back behind him.\n23:28 Comment: You can say goalkeepers can reach up easier than reach down,\n23:31 Comment: but I have to say that was so well hit.\n23:33 Comment: It was a brilliant stop and a fantastic effort.\n23:36 Comment: And this second half has been much more in keeping with the history of the fixture in the Premier League years.\n23:46 Comment: Daded has lived up to the poster of the Spanish flag.\n23:55 Comment: I suppose the contest has lacked a bit of intensity at previous meetings\n23:59 Comment: because of the respective positions of the two teams.\n24:4 Comment: It should get pretty spicy now as Chelsea try and get back into this.\n24:9 Comment: It's been a good second half.\n24:11 Comment: Fellaini.\n24:16 Comment: And Fabregas.\n24:19 Comment: I see a lot out of the wood at the bottom half of the table.\n24:29 Comment: Willian.\n24:31 Comment: Now Pedro against the all-point Jackson.\n24:35 Comment: And Willian's job again against the Spaniard.\n24:45 Comment: And they've got Cahill as well as Terry to try and deal with here.\n24:53 Comment: Gary Cahill went into...\n24:55 Comment: Actually, it came across his man.\n24:58 Comment: It might have been a reasonable chance.\n25:0 Comment: I don't know why Fellaini stopped there.\n25:2 Comment: Whether he got a shout, but he could have gone his head to it.\n25:8 Comment: Some dragging in there.\n25:11 Comment: Tom.\n25:13 Comment: Mike Oliver.\n25:16 Comment: Seen nothing wrong and United able to clear.\n25:23 Comment: Hazard.\n25:27 Comment: Pedro.\n25:31 Comment: Seen a different set-up for Chelsea with the substitutions\n25:35 Comment: and Manchester United might find that to their liking.\n25:39 Comment: Work on the counter-attack.\n25:42 Comment: Rooney.\n25:47 Comment: Damian.\n25:49 Comment: Fellaini.\n25:56 Comment: And it's a all-point Jackson.\n25:58 Comment: Martial.\n26:3 Comment: Mata.\n26:9 Comment: Carrick not giving Martial a better chance of getting it that time.\n26:12 Comment: Fabregas.\n26:14 Comment: A tackling history, of course, from his Arsenal days against Manchester United.\n26:18 Comment: Allegedly a bit of pizza throwing in the dressing room at Old Trafford.\n26:29 Comment: Fabregas.\n26:31 Comment: Now Pedro.\n26:38 Comment: Hazard.\n26:40 Comment: Great turn by Fabregas, it's opened up and just tried to overpower De Gea.\n26:44 Comment: But he wouldn't be overpowered.\n26:47 Comment: Lovely little shimmy, kidding to go one way and...\n26:51 Comment: Ducking inside.\n26:53 Comment: Seen some top saves this afternoon, we really have, that's another.\n26:59 Comment: Up goes Terry.\n27:3 Comment: Moved away by Martial.\n27:8 Comment: Here's Terry.\n27:11 Comment: Moved away, that's for the crosser.\n27:15 Comment: Here's Pedro.\n27:17 Comment: Made space for the cross.\n27:19 Comment: He's taken it out.\n27:22 Comment: The turn was good, the touch not quite so good.\n27:26 Comment: Fabregas pushing on, getting involved from that deeper position now.\n27:32 Comment: Lovely awareness from each of the players.\n27:34 Comment: Again, gets plenty behind it.\n27:50 Comment: How about that for technique as well with the kick.\n27:53 Comment: Put it right on the money for Fellaini.\n27:55 Comment: That's their ball upfield.\n27:57 Comment: He jumps for it, they've got the throw.\n28:0 Comment: You'd expect a response from the home team, we have seen one.\n28:4 Comment: Chelsea.\n28:5 Comment: Matta.\n28:36 Comment: Martial.\n28:38 Comment: For a second here.\n28:40 Comment: With Rooney.\n28:42 Comment: Not anything that Lingard can do.\n28:45 Comment: Kapkan can match.\n28:48 Comment: I think, why Rooney invented the play to do this kind of thing.\n28:52 Comment: Think of that overhead kick against Manchester City.\n28:55 Comment: Wouldn't bet against him.\n29:6 Comment: Pretty easy for Chelsea, up against a United team that's full of experience, full of players.\n29:11 Comment: Know how to keep hold of possession.\n29:12 Comment: When you think of Matta and Rooney, Michael Carrick.\n29:21 Comment: Jose Mourinho has designed some of the manager's job at Manchester United.\n29:25 Comment: He needs his old players to get going here and make it difficult for Louis van Gaal.\n29:35 Comment: Pabregas.\n29:37 Comment: Pabregas for the queta.\n29:42 Comment: Hazard.\n29:44 Comment: Nearly for Kosta, nearly for Pedro.\n29:46 Comment: Nearly not enough for Chelsea.\n29:51 Comment: It's more like it from Hazard, that little burst of acceleration.\n29:54 Comment: Going past his man, we saw it so often last season.\n29:59 Comment: Hit the ball.\n30:2 Comment: United aren't happy with it.\n30:6 Comment: Here's Rooney.\n30:8 Comment: He stops so carefully, gets some attention.\n30:13 Comment: He's not made a big fuss of it, which is always nice to see.\n30:15 Comment: And he doesn't look badly hurt.\n30:20 Comment: On the stretch, McKeown.\n30:30 Comment: Studs are certainly showing, but\n30:32 Comment: I think what saved him was the player who was away from the ball more than anything.\n30:35 Comment: Although he did catch Carrick.\n30:38 Comment: Not as bad as Mathieu Flam and he's early on this afternoon, which is two-footed.\n30:44 Comment: As reckless as Juan Llamas yesterday.\n30:49 Comment: Rooney is really out of control.\n30:51 Comment: When the ball is running away from the player who is chasing it, as McKeown was there, there's always the risk.\n30:56 Comment: Pursuit of possession.\n30:57 Comment: He will do something that contravenes the way the laws are interpreted.\n31:0 Comment: These days.\n31:30 Comment: Manchester United.\n31:35 Comment: Pedro.\n31:37 Comment: Willian.\n31:43 Comment: Hazard.\n31:47 Comment: Into Diogo Costa.\n31:48 Comment: He's slowed it down.\n31:50 Comment: He couldn't for himself.\n31:52 Comment: Hazard.\n31:54 Comment: That's a lovely ball in to start off with from Hazard.\n31:57 Comment: Link can't get the block on it.\n32:1 Comment: He's got to have a future in movies afterwards.\n32:3 Comment: He's got the most expressive features.\n32:7 Comment: The new Clint Eastwood.\n32:25 Comment: Fellaini.\n32:31 Comment: Yes, yes, yes, yes!\n32:36 Comment: Worked it well here, Manchester United, until it came to Diogo Couto Cross from Jesse Lingard.\n32:47 Comment: That's going to be one midfield player for another.\n32:51 Comment: And then...\n32:53 Comment: Paul Fellaini.\n33:1 Comment: Fellaini getting the nod, hasn't he?\n33:3 Comment: Last of the games instead of Schneidlin.\n33:8 Comment: Schweinsteiger, of course, is the candidate to be in there, not fit.\n33:18 Comment: Manchester United.\n33:20 Comment: Twelve minutes or so away.\n33:22 Comment: Finding a very barren run against Chelsea.\n33:25 Comment: And keeping themselves, there's Louis van Gaal and indeed Michael Carrick.\n33:28 Comment: And they've pretty much checked with us, saying that they believe they're in the title race.\n33:39 Comment: Another card for Lingard.\n33:44 Comment: There's the striker's tackling.\n33:46 Comment: Felt he had to make up the yards and put in a challenge.\n33:51 Comment: He'll take that if it leads to a win.\n33:55 Comment: Willian.\n33:59 Comment: He's in there, it's Willian.\n34:1 Comment: It's the aerial route, which he doesn't.\n34:4 Comment: And the advantage will...\n34:6 Comment: ...be on Willian's.\n34:8 Comment: He'll defend it.\n34:13 Comment: Willian.\n34:27 Comment: John Terry.\n34:28 Comment: Trying to be everywhere at the moment in Chelsea's time of need.\n34:31 Comment: He's just come back from an offside position.\n34:36 Comment: And it always, the law is, you can't be offside in your own half.\n34:41 Comment: Where Chelsea can take the...\n34:44 Comment: ...free kick is the other side of the line.\n34:48 Comment: He has a red card against Chelsea on his CV.\n34:53 Comment: For Southampton.\n34:59 Comment: Tom Pysma, I'm sure, to provide a bit of protection.\n35:5 Comment: Pedro.\n35:7 Comment: In for Thwick-Jackson, stopping the supply.\n35:13 Comment: Into the last ten minutes at Stamford Bridge.\n35:28 Comment: Many a great sporting occasion, live here on Sky Sports,\n35:31 Comment: including Super Bowl 50 for you from the Chelsea fans.\n35:36 Comment: It's now 10pm this evening.\n35:38 Comment: Sky Sports 1 and Sky Sports 3.\n35:40 Comment: Carolina against Denver.\n35:54 Comment: Pedro.\n36:0 Comment: There you go, Costa.\n36:3 Comment: Willian.\n36:6 Comment: United can break here.\n36:9 Comment: And that's a...\n36:10 Comment: ...42 man, I think.\n36:13 Comment: From Pedro, Diego Costa giving full chase.\n36:16 Comment: And make Fraggen, at the very least, do that.\n36:19 Comment: And get Chelsea up the pitch.\n36:22 Comment: With numbers around his throat.\n36:30 Comment: No individual inspiration on for Hiddink,\n36:32 Comment: with the hand side of Pedro.\n36:37 Comment: Pass out to...\n36:39 Comment: ...Miquel.\n36:42

falls on the ground and...\n37:1 Comment: ...well, if that was deliberate, that's got to be a booking, hasn't it?\n37:4 Comment: Yeah.\n37:5 Comment: On the booking it is, but...\n37:7 Comment: ...that ball was not going to pass...\n37:10 Comment: ...at any cost.\n37:13 Comment: Phil Jones likes to do this, one little header on the floor.\n37:18 Comment: Smalling's had another solid game today.\n37:22 Comment: Sprawling Smalling.\n37:26 Comment: And a free kick.\n37:27 Comment: This is very much in Willian's territory.\n37:35 Comment: David Costa just trying to block off a...\n37:38

...not ready.\n38:52 Comment: Indicated the free kick could be taken.\n38:55 Comment: And he'll be complaining if this leads to an equaliser.\n39:0 Comment: That's for the quitter.\n39:5 Comment: Pedro.\n39:9 Comment: Fabregas.\n39:10 Comment: Pedro.\n39:14 Comment: And then...\n39:15 Comment: ...serving his side nobly.\n39:16 Comment: Caught right out of position.\n39:21 Comment: Chelsea try again.\n39:30 Comment: Go on!\n39:37 Comment: Dvorec rounding up.\n39:39 Comment: Two as matter to clear.\n39:42 Comment: That's what the quitter did well really.\n39:43 Comment: Would have hoped that that would have stuck with him.\n39:48 Comment: Handed away.\n39:50 Comment: And a new better quality from those wide areas.\n39:52 Comment: United at the moment doing well to...\n39:55 Comment:

goalscorer Jesse Lingard.\n40:45 Comment: No, he's certainly left an imprint on the game with an outstanding goal.\n40:49 Comment: And he would say...\n40:51 Comment: ...worthy of winning a match of this magnitude goal.\n40:54 Comment: He's not going to forget today in the OAC.\n40:56 Comment: Oh, is he?\n40:58 Comment: That was a pearler.\n41:9 Comment: Best shooting since Jesse James.\n41:20 Comment: Forward by Cahill.\n41:27 Comment: Rooney's done well this time.\n41:29 Comment: Martial...\n41:31 Comment: ...has taken it into traffic.\n41:36 Comment: Forward by Mikel.\n41:42 Comment: Chris Smalling, who has been booked...\n41:44 Comment: ...as has Elie Blint of course.\n41:46 Comment: So he's up against two central defenders.\n41:50 Comment: He's not got too much change over Chris Smalling.\n41:52 Comment: But he's got to watch it. It is a habit.\n41:54 Comment: Two arms around the body.\n41:57 Comment: Mikel Oliver did send Smalling off in a Manchester derby...\n42:1 Comment: ...a couple of years ago.\n42:8 Comment: Pedro...\n42:9 Comment: ...William.\n42:16 Comment: They've sounded both halves well, Manchester United.\n42:18 Comment: Do you feel they've done enough to win this, Alan?\n42:21 Comment: They have so far, I think.\n42:23 Comment: They have so far.\n42:24 Comment: It's been a reflection of their...\n42:26 Comment: ...upturn in performance, really.\n42:30 Comment: A lot more positive in possession.\n42:33 Comment: A lot more adventurous.\n42:35 Comment: And when you...\n42:37 Comment: ...and when you appreciate it's been a pretty average season...\n42:40 Comment: ...hasn't it, from United's standards?\n42:41 Comment: But the recent winner, Liverpool...\n42:43 Comment: ...and now this one at Chelsea...\n42:46 Comment: ...adds up to something much better.\n42:54 Comment: Mikael.\n43:6 Comment: Ivanovic.\n43:9 Comment: And that's something that...\n43:11 Comment: ...Luis Valha...\n43:13 Comment: ...Valha won't want, is defenders giving away unnecessary free kicks...\n43:16 Comment: ...in this kind of area.\n43:18 Comment: No, just quick feet from Mazar did for him.\n43:20 Comment: Throw in everything. That's it now.\n43:22 Comment: Chelsea.\n43:25 Comment: Points aren't heading yet for...\n43:27 Comment: ...Ole Trafford.\n43:32 Comment: It's about time with that stoppage for Kurt Zouma's

easy.\n43:49 Comment: It's that daily blimp marking him tightly...\n43:52 Comment: ...and maybe just doesn't enough.\n43:55 Comment: To make the job difficult, to make it hard, to keep it on target...\n43:58 Comment: ...but it is a chance.\n44:1 Comment: It's a good chance for the centre forward.\n44:9 Comment: Manchester United fans haven't had too much to sing about...\n44:12 Comment: ...as Stamford Bridge down the years.\n44:15 Comment: It's only been a second league win in 14 visits...\n44:19 Comment: ...and the other was in contentious circumstances in 2012.\n44:22 Comment: Chelsea ended with nine men.\n44:24 Comment: The winner for United, Javier Hernandez, he was offside.\n44:27 Comment: He was the manager that day.\n44:31 Comment: He would have enjoyed watching this tonight.\n44:36 Comment: No work to do though.\n44:38 Comment: Are we heading into hitting time?\n44:40 Comment: Yes.\n44:42 Comment: It might be rooney time.\n44:49 Comment: Fabregas.\n44:51 Comment: Good pressure by Mata, to whom the win here would be very special.\n44:55 Comment: Mikel.\n44:56 Comment: Chelsea haven't given it up.\n44:58 Comment: Curry's playing up front but Mikel's given up the ball.\n45:1 Comment: He's just looking ahead to see what he was going to do there.\n45:4 Comment: Mikel.\n45:5 Comment: Six added minutes but...\n45:7 Comment: ...Defy.\n45:10 Comment: The substitute, Schneiderlin...\n45:12 Comment: ...was really, it wasn't a difficult pass.\n45:17 Comment: No, that's a waste.\n45:18 Comment: Schneiderlin, acres of space there.\n45:20 Comment: Moving forward.\n45:29 Comment: Pedro.\n45:31 Comment: Willian.\n45:33 Comment: Hazard.\n45:39 Comment: Fabregas.\n45:41 Comment: And it's Diego Costa.\n45:43 Comment: Still Diego Costa.\n45:45 Comment: 1-1 Diego Costa.\n45:51 Comment: It's late.\n45:53 Comment: But it's great in his first match for Chelsea against Manchester United.\n45:57 Comment: They got him in.\n46:2 Comment: There was a little slip in the middle of the park, Daley Blint I think it was.\n46:6 Comment: That creates the gap.\n46:9 Comment: He keeps himself onside, balls with Jackson, maybe a yard behind where he should be.\n46:13 Comment: And he can't make up for it.\n46:16 Comment: But it's a call head.\n46:17 Comment: Of an experienced, deadly striker there.\n46:20 Comment: Just when you need that composure.\n46:22 Comment: Diego Costa produces it.\n46:25 Comment: And Chelsea's persistence has paid off here.\n46:28 Comment: And still more time for something to happen in this match.\n46:39 Comment: Well, the first time United have faced him.\n46:42 Comment: And they felt...\n46:44 Comment: ...at the end, the force of him, Diego Costa.\n47:18 Comment: And...\n47:20 Comment: Safety first from the...\n47:22 Comment:

good football.\n47:36 Comment: And Chelsea have had to shuffle their pack for all sorts of reasons.\n47:41 Comment: And Wijnaldum.\n47:42 Comment: Another free kick given away.\n47:45 Comment: Still

equaliser here against Everton.\n48:31 Comment: In the last home game.\n48:34 Comment: Manchester United might not be finished yet.\n48:38 Comment: With Rooney.\n48:40 Comment: He gets past Ivanovic

    "summary": "On a blustery day in West London, Chelsea played host to Manchester United at Stamford Bridge. The festivities kicked off under the shadow of swirling winds, adding an element of unpredictability to an already high-stakes Premier League clash.\n\nFrom the initial kickoff, both sides exhibited a penchant for ball control and short passes with Chelsea starting more methodically, while Manchester United pressed with a foreboding intensity. The first few minutes saw Chelsea's Ivanovic and Manchester's Michael Carrick endeavoring to gain control of the midfield. Carrick tried numerous times to orchestrate play, hinting at his vast experience, having been a pivotal figure in many matches of significant magnitude for United.\n\nAs the match progressed, the intensity heated up. In the early stages, Carrick attempted to influence proceedings by linking up effectively with teammates, suggesting he might still have a few more years at the top level, despite rumors about his future. On Chelsea's side, John Terry showcased classic defensive solidity. Indeed, Chelsea had not quite been the imperious force they were in their title-winning campaign of the previous season, but they still showed steely resolve.\n\nChelsea enjoyed a good spell, extending an undefeated run for ten games in all competitions after parting ways with Jose Mourinho. Manchester United, not to be outdone, had also showcased resilience, losing only one of their previous eight matches before this encounter—a run that began with a goalless draw against Chelsea on December 28th.\n\nThe game's tempo shifted often, with Manchester United looking a cohesive unit, a stark contrast from the inconsistencies that plagued much of their campaign. Martial and Lingard were particularly enterprising, Martial's dynamism linking well with Lingard to put Chelsea's defense under pressure. Notably, Martial found space frequently down the left, exploiting Ivanovic who struggled to contain the young Frenchman as he threaded passes and took on defenders with gusto.\n\nFellaini and Rooney combined menacingly, although Ivanovic's cautious defensive acumen ensured no early goals dented Chelsea’s efforts. As the opening half wore on, it became clear that Manchester United had the better of the initial exchanges.\n\nChelsea's defensive unit, under siege from a flurry of Manchester United attacks, was anchored by timely interventions from Terry and Zouma. Ivanovic wasn’t found wanting either; his vigilance foiled several United forays. Meanwhile, Martial continued to be an absolute menace down the left, creating opportunities and testing Courtois on multiple occasions.\n\nChelsea had some fleeting moments of promise too. Costa found himself in half-chances but found it hard to muster an impact. United's defensive line, with Smalling and Blint staunch at the center-back positions, kept the Blues at bay. The Red Devils' tactic to involve their defenders in the attacking build-up, particularly through disciplined passes reaped dividends as Carrick and Blind supplied the front men. This tactical ploy pinned Chelsea back for considerable periods, limiting their chances dramatically.\n\nChelsea's pluckiness manifested in set-pieces, with Willian providing credible threats from corners and free kicks. Manchester United, however, held firm, with De Gea showcasing phenomenal saves ensuring the match remained evenly poised.\n\nAs the first half neared an end with neither side breaking the deadlock, Chelsea's renewed vigor was palpable. They gradually garnered more possession, with quick breakout plays involving Fabregas and Matic. The rhythm saw Hazard pushed into a more central role where his incisive dribbling could exert more influence; however, his recent injury layoffs meant he was still finding his match stride.\n\nWith the whistle marking the end of the first half, both teams retreated with a 0-0 scoreline, United perhaps rueing their missed opportunities while Chelsea would have been hopeful of capitalizing on their late momentum.\n\nAs the second half commenced, the occasion was marked with a tribute to the 1958 Munich air disaster, which added an emotional backdrop to proceedings. Chelsea seemed to have adopted a more attacking posture. Costa and Willian increasingly found their groove, combining to create several nervous moments for the United defense. William's cheeky runs, coupled with precise crosses, troubled United but stalwart defending from Smalling kept his goal safe.\n\nUnited did, however, respond in kind, with Wayne Rooney charging forward and attempting dangerous crosses into the box often aimed at Lingard. Their approach culminated in a spectacular moment just shy of the hour mark when Jesse Lingard received the ball with his back to the goal inside the penalty area. A swift pirouette later, Lingard fired an unstoppable shot past Courtois to give Manchester United a deserving lead. The goal was a testament to Lingard's nimble footwork and sharpness, leaving Chelsea’s defenders flat-footed.\n\nDespite the goal, Chelsea’s tenacity was undeterred. Manager Guus Hiddink opted for tactical changes, bringing on Pedro and introducing more attack-minded formations. The sight of Hazard moving with intent on the pitch was heartening for the Chelsea faithful. The Blues dug deep for an equalizer, their efforts characterized by intelligent crosses from Fabregas and driving runs from Ivanovic. A notable spell saw Ivanovic produce a fierce volley on goal only for De Gea to parry it expertly.\n\nAn injury scare for Chelsea came in the form of Zouma, who landed awkwardly, prompting his substitution with Gary Cahill. As Zouma was stretchered off, Cahill had to quickly adapt to the pace and intensity of the game. His entrance revitalized Chelsea’s defense, offering the dual advantage of defensive solidity and attacking set-piece threat.\n\nThe game progressed with Chelsea chasing the crucial equalizer while United sought to consolidate their lead. Courtois made a few important saves, ensuring United's lead remained slender. As they pressed forward, however, Manchester United could not maintain their early second-half momentum.\n\nIn the dying embers of the match, Chelsea’s resilience bore fruit. A probing run by Mikel, who had been industrious throughout, linked up with Hazard who deftly directed the ball into Costa’s path. With the goal in his sights, Costa shielded the ball from Blind and coolly slotted it past De Gea to tie the game at 1-1. The goal instigated roars from the Chelsea supporters, who had been behind their team through thick and thin throughout the match.\n\nThe final moments saw frantic end-to-end action with both teams looking for a decisive factor. Rooney attempted an audacious chip over Courtois, which did not quite come off. Chelsea, on the other hand, piled bodies forward in search of a winner, but De Gea stood strong. The match ultimately concluded with a 1-1 draw.\n\nIt was a captivating encounter characterized by tactical acumen, robust defending, and moments of individual brilliance. Lingard's remarkable opener showcased United's attacking potential, while Costa's equalizer epitomized Chelsea's grit and determination. The draw left both teams with plenty to ponder as they continued their respective campaigns, each earning a hard-fought point in a match befitting their storied rivalry."
