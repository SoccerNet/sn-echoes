The match, held at West Ham's home stadium, was a testament to the excitement and unpredictability of football, with goals, fouls, substitutions, and a flurry of set-piece actions. Let’s dive into the extended detailed description of both halves of this pulsating match.\n\n### First Half:\n\nThe match commenced with Manchester kicking off the proceedings at the sound of the referee’s whistle. Within the very first minute, West Ham's attacking prowess was on display as they managed to create an early chance. At 52 seconds, West Ham fired a shot on target, and just a second later, the ball found the back of the net, sending the home fans into a delirium of joy. This swift attack earned West Ham an early 1-0 lead and set the tone for what was to be an engaging contest.\n\nManchester, determined to bounce back, resumed play with their kick-off at 1 minute and 47 seconds. However, West Ham's aggressive approach saw them committing a foul at 2 minutes and 6 seconds, gifting Manchester an indirect free-kick at 2 minutes and 37 seconds. The game then experienced its first interruption as the ball went out of play at 4 minutes and 10 seconds. Manchester had an opportunity to equalize via a corner at 4 minutes and 36 seconds, but the ball soon went out of play again at 5 minutes and 35 seconds.\n\nAs the game progressed, possession switched frequently between the teams, with a series of throw-ins and ball-clearances disrupting the rhythm of the game. West Ham's defensive line exhibited moments of resilience, but their aggressive tactics led to another foul at 7 minutes and 20 seconds. Manchester struck back with a shot on target at 8 minutes and 45 seconds, immediately earning a penalty. The Manchester player took the shot with clinical precision, scoring the equalizer at 8 minutes and 46 seconds. The score was now level at 1-1.\n\nWest Ham restarted the game with a kick-off at 9 minutes and 24 seconds. The tempo of the game saw another upward shift until West Ham decided to make an early substitution at 12 minutes and 11 seconds, likely an adjustment to counter Manchester's growing confidence. A foul by Manchester at 13 minutes and 28 seconds handed West Ham another indirect free-kick opportunity at 13 minutes and 39 seconds, though it did little to change the scoreline.\n\nThe game continued with both sides trading fouls and trying to assert dominance. Notably, Manchester received a yellow card at 31 minutes and 26 seconds for a particularly rough challenge.

Manchester’s defensive unit efficiently cleared the ball at 5 minutes and 53 seconds, attempting to switch the momentum in their favor. Their efforts were met with resistance, culminating in another flurry of fouls and set pieces.\n\nMidway through the second half, West Ham scored again in dramatic fashion. At 10 minutes and 23 seconds, they registered a shot on target which rippled the net, sending their supporters into raptures and pushing them ahead 2-1.
