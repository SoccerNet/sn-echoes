They've been here before of course and hung on in\n0:10 Comment: there, can they survive again? Well that is a big ask. I was watching them in the tunnel\n0:17 Comment: Ian, just to see their faces, how they were looking and they looked very relaxed I\n0:23 Comment: have to say and right away what a backing they're receiving.\n0:30 Comment: Fabregas, well that's a little loose. Defoe, taken out by Cahill, now what a decision this is.\n0:41 Comment: Mike Jones shows a yellow card to Gary Cahill. Yeah I think it's the right decision, I think John Terry\n0:47 Comment: was back on the cover. Says Fabregas just doesn't look at all, there's lots of\n0:52 Comment: grappling, it is a foul, Jermaine Defoe bearing down on goal. Cahill all over the top of him\n0:58 Comment: but he's got a lot of ground.\n1:0 Comment: It's unfortunate for him, I think John Terry was back on the cover.\n1:9 Comment: It could have been a lot worse that, Gary Cahill and Chelsea.\n1:16 Comment: In the opening seconds of the game.\n1:24 Comment: What a chance for Sunderland to make an early impression here.\n1:26 Comment: Well, just going, what the goalkeeper at least.\n1:32 Comment: Courtois back from a ban and might be called upon very early on.\n1:41 Comment: Kazri, looks like he fancies this.\n1:50 Comment: Kazri straight against the wall and straight to Eden.\n1:51 Comment: That's a good one.\n1:55 Comment: And straight to Eden Hazard.\n1:56 Comment: Yeah, a very short run up from Kazri.\n2:1 Comment: Didn't get it up whatsoever.\n2:2 Comment: And Arnholdt will go back to Kona.\n2:9 Comment: John Terry rising.\n2:13 Comment: You missed Kabul, was actually still up there.\n2:16 Comment: And he's out of position now as William looks to put Hazard in.\n2:21 Comment: And Arnholdt covers.\n2:22 Comment: Yeah, Kabul pushing forward.\n2:23 Comment: Kershaw just pre-fixed.\n2:24 Comment: Well done.\n2:25 Comment: Kershaw just providing a bit of extra cover, dropping it to centre-back.\n2:31 Comment: Chelsea side do have a bit of quality in the final third, don't they?\n2:40 Comment: Costa.\n2:41 Comment: Fabregas takes over.\n2:43 Comment: Mikel Fulwian.\n2:46 Comment: Ivanovic.\n2:47 Comment: That's a good one.\n2:58 Comment: Brighton, Breezy start.\n2:59 Comment: And talking of Breezy, there is quite a cool one around the Stadium of Light.\n3:4 Comment: That's the new there.\n3:12 Comment: Jermaine Defoe says he's relishing the challenge of trying to keep Sunderland up.\n3:17 Comment: He's hitting.\n3:18 Comment: Setting the build-up to this game.\n3:21 Comment: That Defoe was a beautiful player.\n3:22 Comment: And he's going to do it.\n3:23 Comment: And he's gone from there.\n3:24 Comment: That was a nice hang-up.\n3:25 Comment: He knows how to keep that arm going into thefield, like, you know, as he's been doing\n3:26 Comment: all day over these past months.\n3:27 Comment: He's going to have to keep the ball up and down and around and do it.\n3:36 Comment: And he's that guy going toές for much of his Hyundai Charade.\n3:45 Comment: eating it from up and down.\n3:47 Comment: Oh, he's just gone for out his career.\n3:50 Comment: Chelsea have won on nine of their last ten visits here.\n3:51 Comment: A goalless draw.\n3:53 Comment: Yeah, the stadium's crackling just now.\n3:56 Comment: And I think they identified that they have to get behind the side.\n4:1 Comment: It's imperative that Sunderland keep up tempo in this match.\n4:3 Comment: They can't let Chelsea settle.\n4:6 Comment: Williams' error.\n4:8 Comment: Now Barini to try and seek out De Vos.\n4:12 Comment: Sunderland on the front foot again.\n4:14 Comment: Well, those types of balls, just turning Chelsea's back to it,\n4:18 Comment: will be absolutely crucial,\n4:19 Comment: because Gary Hay, Cahill, is already on a yellow card.\n4:23 Comment: And to demean the ball, or just want to run on there.\n4:27 Comment: Kazari.\n4:33 Comment: Yedlin.\n4:38 Comment: Hazard.\n4:40 Comment: Tracked by Yedlin, but he's found William.\n4:44 Comment: Diego Costa powering through the middle here,\n4:46 Comment: but that should carry to Manoni.\n4:49 Comment: A little close.\n4:50 Comment: Yeah, I think he judged it.\n4:52 Comment: We'll say he judged it.\n4:52 Comment: He did it to perfection, but Costa's run was brilliant.\n4:55 Comment: Made the mind up already.\n4:57 Comment: Just took off.\n5:0 Comment: Coutinhole cut out by Terry.\n5:4 Comment: Hazard.\n5:6 Comment: Hold back.\n5:9 Comment: Kershaw, free kick for Chelsea.\n5:15 Comment: Hazard.\n5:16 Comment: Great take, great first touch.\n5:18 Comment: Kershaw will be vital in front of the back four, won't he?\n5:22 Comment: Just providing the X a bit of cover.\n5:32 Comment: Sunderland with so many draws of late, one win in nine,\n5:35 Comment: but it was, crucially, at Norwich.\n5:39 Comment: Also in the bottom three, Costa battling with Kabul here.\n5:43 Comment: Free kick for Diego Costa.\n5:49 Comment: It's not often you see the big man smiling.\n5:52 Comment: No, it's scowling and growling, everyone.\n5:55 Comment: .\n6:1 Comment: Azpilicueta.\n6:2 Comment: .\n6:4 Comment: Yedlin tries to close the door and succeeds.\n6:6 Comment: .\n6:8 Comment: Azpilicueta definitely gets a touch for me before Yedlin,\n6:11 Comment: but there's nothing in it.\n6:12 Comment: .\n6:15 Comment: Two fullbacks going side to side.\n6:16 Comment: You can see that Azpilicueta gets the last touch,\n6:19 Comment: but absolutely no penalty.\n6:21 Comment: .\n6:22 Comment: Sunderland have failed to score in their last three home games.\n6:25 Comment: It's 11 years since they went four matches without a goal here.\n6:28 Comment: .\n6:38 Comment: Azpilicueta will take this throw.\n6:43 Comment: Costa.\n6:45 Comment: Kershaw, quickly in and around Hazard.\n6:51 Comment: . Fabregas now.\n6:52 Comment: Mikel, Willian, Ivanovic screaming for the ball away on the right and that's where it's going\n6:59 Comment: Katamol, some anticipation from the Sunderland supporters\n7:12 Comment: they're on the attack again\n7:14 Comment: Vershoff\n7:16 Comment: Verrini\n7:19 Comment: just away from defer\n7:21 Comment: I don't think Jermaine Defoe was expecting the ball to be pushed through the legs of Mikel\n7:25 Comment: a little overcooked from Kershaw in the first to find a foot\n7:50 Comment: Kershaw\n7:50 Comment: Chelsea, I mean\n7:51 Comment: moved into the top half of the table in March\n7:53 Comment: it's been a woeful season by their high standards\n7:56 Comment: Costa\n8:2 Comment: perfect challenge from Kershaw\n8:5 Comment: doesn't really come to anything yet for Sunderland though\n8:9 Comment: Kazri\n8:11 Comment: Vershoff\n8:21 Comment: !\n8:34 Comment: just slightly over had he had 2 options Kershaw\n8:36 Comment: Kazri 1, Yedlin the other\n8:37 Comment: I can see he is onside\n8:38 Comment: Siren! Siren!! signs out\n8:39 Comment: Tsin! Tsin! TrianSt limited Weespo's boy\n8:50 Comment: S commissioner!\n8:50 Comment: Sunderland really did look awful at the start of the season, they have improved significantly\n9:5 Comment: yet remain in a perilous position in the bottom three.\n9:10 Comment: Scored that late, late penalty at Stoke last week to scramble a point.\n9:18 Comment: Three point really is precious at the moment.\n9:21 Comment: Sunderland home again here in midweek to Everton, they finish away to Watford.\n9:29 Comment: Norwich also have a midweek game and home to Watford, they finish at Everton.\n9:33 Comment: Newcastle with a game less, Villa today, home to Spurs then.\n9:39 Comment: Hazard is away here for Chelsea and Willian is supporting, he doesn't really connect.\n9:44 Comment: Lovely little Kevin Goat, that's from a quitter.\n9:48 Comment: Great little goal from Willian.\n9:48 Comment: Little touch from Hazard, he's off on his bike, he's got no one to hit in the middle.\n9:52 Comment: Willian just checking his run, just doesn't quite catch the shot, chokes on it a little with the left foot.\n10:1 Comment: Uncomfortable in the end for Minori.\n10:18 Comment: Cabool.\n10:19 Comment: Side against Jermain Defoe anyway.\n10:24 Comment: Mikel, Hazard.\n10:30 Comment: Diego Costa has just taken his gloves off.\n10:37 Comment: I don't think it's that warm yet, Ian.\n10:40 Comment: Matic.\n10:45 Comment:

think he was so poor at the start of the season\n17:10 Comment: looks like he's starting to find a lot of better form again just in time for the euros\n17:16 Comment: amazingly those three goals were his first in the premier league\n17:20 Comment: this season it's quite incredible but in today's game you know with Sunderland pressing so hard\n17:25 Comment: from the backfield to the backfield it's

towards the front of the pitch\n17:38 Comment: Hazard is the one that's causing the most problems\n17:40 Comment: he's finding little pockets of space he's dropping wide he's giving Edmund a real

think he's level\n19:20 Comment: Sunderland need a bit more of that yeah just weight of numbers in the box as well\n19:25 Comment: few options\n19:26 Comment: making Chelsea have to defend cross balls one of the stats for me and I\n19:33 Comment: pulled out was the bonus the bonus scored with two headers the least amount\n19:37 Comment: of crosses in the Premier League so that would have been a surprise at the floor\n19:41 Comment: stuck that one away\n19:46 Comment: Diego Costa has made the difference so far yeah it's a huge slice of luck look\n19:51 Comment: he knocks around the corner KL continues his run he gets a slice of luck but what\n19:56 Comment: he's done is he's got a bit of a finish beautiful just passed with the instep\n20:0 Comment: inside that far post nine goals and five assists for Diego Costa since\n20:7 Comment: Hiddink arrived his stats under Jose Mourinho not quite so hot familiar story for a few\n20:17 Comment: here's Fabregas Hazard\n20:20 Comment: it's

down but nothing doing\n21:0 Comment: yeah great pass from Lee Catamount it wasn't a bad take from Barini\n21:4 Comment: suggestion of handball as well from I think it was Ivanovic possibly\n21:11

make.\n22:5 Comment: Take by Byrini, a little bit heavy as it comes back off of Ivanovic.\n22:9 Comment: Purely accidental for me, so close to him.\n22:14 Comment: That's a great pass, it's Cahill gets the stab in.\n22:16 Comment: And if anything, he maybe does brush the hand, but certainly it's an accident.\n22:25 Comment: It's the 21st time that Sunderland have conceded first in the Premier League this season.\n22:31 Comment: Worryingly, they have a one when that's happened.\n22:34 Comment: And even more worryingly, they've only taken four points when that's happened.\n22:41 Comment: Catamount.\n22:44 Comment: Kindly to Byrini.\n22:49 Comment: A gasp from the fans there, Ian, but I knew exactly what Catamount was trying to do.\n22:53 Comment: He's trying to put it through the legs

Convier!\n23:5 Comment: Oh dear.\n23:6 Comment: It was all so promising until that last bit.\n23:9 Comment: Well, it takes a great touch and you're just saying, go and hit it with the laces.\n23:13 Comment: Put the foot right through the back of the ball, but it goes for just a little side foot finish.\n23:19 Comment: Leaning back.\n23:21 Comment: Wrong decision.\n23:25 Comment: acious effort production.\n23:27 Comment: Bесьer poured into the box and it went into nothing.\n23:30 Comment: He\n23:37 Comment: Anyways.\n23:39 Comment: above in this one and 1972.\n23:47 Comment: 寂 and pr wolves

Comment: Yeah, I didn't think it went out by Costa.\n38:47 Comment: I think Sandler just switched off.\n38:50 Comment: He does a little turn there.\n38:53 Comment: And it's maybe touch and goal.\n38:56 Comment: But I didn't think the whole ball was out.\n38:57 Comment: Mignone had to be careful.\n39:2 Comment: Chelsea not hanging around, Costa thinking about a back heel for Fabregas but Hazard is on the scene, no surprise there, crosses screen by Yedlin, Diego Costa up against Fabio Barini\n39:20 Comment: Barini again doesn't jump, another elbow he takes in the side of the head, I think it's the same side of the head, I think Barini would come out with a crash helmet on in the second half\n39:34 Comment: Kazric, one of it's trying to foul him and it will be brought back by Mike Jones\n39:47 Comment: some of the fans are going berserk\n39:50 Comment: they think they had a breakaway on, Mike Jones decided to pull it again back\n39:55 Comment: you see that it's a clear foul, he gets away, maybe the opportunity to get the head up and spread the pulley\n40:20 Comment: and on hold then to take this, Cabool showing interest, Mikel there for Chelsea, Kone there for Sunderland\n40:29 Comment: Oh Kazric, with a stunner, with a screamer, what a goal that is\n40:40 Comment: and it's considerably lifted the spirits at the Stadium of Light\n40:45 Comment: Kazric has just scored an absolute screamer\n40:50 Comment: and it's hit with such ferocity that it takes most of these fans about a second to realise that it's hit the back of the net\n40:58 Comment: it's a bit of head tennis, Chelsea don't clear it, it's popped back in, it's popped back out\n41:5 Comment: and when it drops, what about that?\n41:9 Comment: that's all about technique, it's side on, it's keeping the knee up, it does take a little knick\n41:14 Comment: but I think it's only going to help it into the back of the net\n41:17 Comment: Courtois is not getting that, it's not going to help it into the back of the net\n41:20 Comment: but it's only going to help it into the back of the net\n41:20 Comment: what a strike that is and gets Sunderland right back in the game\n41:25 Comment: spectacular, a big goal for Big Sam\n41:31 Comment: from Wabi Kazri, winter window arrival from Bordeaux\n41:36 Comment: and listen to the noise now\n41:45 Comment: as we enter the final few minutes of the first half\n41:50 Comment: at this stadium of light\n41:51 Comment: Sunderland would have taken a scrappy goal\n42:6 Comment: they got a brilliant goal\n42:10 Comment: yeah, that was an absolute thing of beauty\n42:13 Comment: no hesitation from Kazri, just takes it on the drop\n42:18 Comment: such a difficult\n42:20 Comment: technique to execute\n42:21 Comment: but didn't he just do it\n42:23 Comment: a big, big boost just before the break for Sunderland\n42:33 Comment: I was just going to say it's perfect timing\n42:36 Comment: but speaking about the goal itself and how ferocious it was\n42:42 Comment: and the technique is absolutely top draw\n42:45 Comment: it's coming down from the height\n42:48 Comment: so it's so hard to get you to the top of the net\n42:49 Comment: it's kind of hard to get your timing correct\n42:50 Comment: but he gets that right, he gets the power in it\n42:56 Comment: and the direction in it\n42:58 Comment: and it's a quite special goal\n42:59 Comment: and there's a celebration, Ian\n43:4 Comment: I think it took him by surprise just a little\n43:5 Comment: it flew some\n43:6 Comment: past Cottoire\n43:8 Comment: and it was just what Sunderland needed\n43:12 Comment: they're playing just something away with Diego Costa there\n43:16 Comment: but....\n43:17 Comment: the stadium of light here on tele cultivator ground\n43:18 Comment: Sadie Moulin has come alive now.\n43:23 Comment: They've been trying their best, the Sunderland fans, to lift their team.\n43:27 Comment: That's a foul given against Fabio Barini.\n43:30 Comment: But now they have something to shout about.\n43:33 Comment: Yeah, that's warmed the fans up, hasn't it?\n43:36 Comment: Barini being penalised for a charge into the corner.\n43:40 Comment: Shoulder to shoulder.\n43:41 Comment: I think Barini is the more aggressive.\n43:44 Comment: But it's not a foul for me.\n43:45 Comment: Both shoulder to shoulder.\n43:46 Comment: That's all about strength and desire to win the ball.\n43:53 Comment: It's a harsh call against Fabio Barini.\n44:1 Comment: There will be a matter of added time, you would imagine,\n44:5 Comment: with those injuries to Thierry and Barini.\n44:9 Comment: They are in the last minute of the first half.\n44:12 Comment: That's a goal and a free kick for Sunderland.\n44:16 Comment: That's the goal.\n44:19 Comment: And a free going across to Gary Cahill, who was booked in the first minute.\n44:23 Comment: Yeah, it just takes Catamount out.\n44:25 Comment: I think it's accidental.\n44:27 Comment: It takes one on the side of the head, actually, from Catamount.\n44:31 Comment: But he times it wrong.\n44:33 Comment: It was an accidental collision.\n44:36 Comment: And I think Mike Jones will just be telling him,\n44:38 Comment: you have to be very careful.\n44:40 Comment: Sunderland.\n44:46 Comment: Ending the half on a high.\n44:51 Comment: An opportunity here for the team in the bottom three.\n44:56 Comment: So close to halftime.\n44:58 Comment: Don't try anything fancy.\n44:59 Comment: Just work it in there.\n45:1 Comment: And let's see what happens.\n45:3 Comment: Kone and Kershoff and Cabool to aim for.\n45:7 Comment: Barini and Defoe lurking.\n45:10 Comment: There will be three minutes of stoppage time\n45:12 Comment: at the end of this first half, starting now.\n45:16 Comment: And the goal is a goal.\n45:19 Comment: Casri to whip it in.\n45:20 Comment: Away by Costa and Willian.\n45:24 Comment: Yedlin.\n45:27 Comment: Kone.\n45:29 Comment: John Terry steers it away.\n45:33 Comment: Diego Costa.\n45:35 Comment: Loses out to Barini.\n45:40 Comment: Sunderland finishing with a flourish in this first half.\n45:45 Comment: Villa now.\n45:46 Comment: In this Cabool.\n45:48 Comment: It's turned into a left winger.\n45:50 Comment: Away by Terry.\n45:54 Comment: Away by Azpilicueta.\n45:56 Comment: Some relief now for Chelsea.\n45:59 Comment: Could be on a break of their own.\n46:1 Comment: Matic here for Fabregas.\n46:4 Comment: Important challenge from Jan Mvir.\n46:16 Comment: Whoops...\n46:17 Comment: Tivo Kotear made a complete hash of that.\n46:21 Comment: And the Sunderland fans are liking it.\n46:24 Comment: They couldn't take any chances and let it bounce.\n46:26 Comment: Defoe was shutting that down.\n46:28 Comment: And got it all wrong.\n46:35 Comment: Yedlin.\n46:37 Comment: He would take this through.\n46:44 Comment: Yedlin looking for a Kershoff flick on, which he managed.\n46:46 Comment: but Courtois should have that.\n47:4 Comment: Big Sam looks rather calmer than most at the moment inside the Stadium of Light.\n47:8 Comment: Yeah, that chewing gum's getting a right doing though.\n47:16 Comment: Kershaw. Offside it would have been any way against Domain de Verte.\n47:24 Comment: He makes some brilliant runs though, doesn't he?\n47:28 Comment: Just one of those times if he keeps making them, he might just get in.\n47:35 Comment: Fabregas. Mikel.\n47:39 Comment: One back briefly by Kazri. The goalscorer.\n47:46 Comment: Matic.\n47:49 Comment: Knocked on by Fabregas.\n47:51 Comment: It's found a way through to Azpilicueta.\n47:53 Comment: And here is Matic!\n47:55 Comment: And he has put Chelsea back in front!\n47:58 Comment: And that is a bitter blow in first-half stoppage time for Sunderland.\n48:4 Comment: Yeah, it's a super finish. Again, it's composure.\n48:7 Comment: It's horrific defending right on half-time.\n48:10 Comment: Watch Patrick van Aanholt play everyone onside.\n48:13 Comment: I think he's a couple of yards deeper on first-load.\n48:16 Comment: Yeah, everyone's deeper.\n48:18 Comment: Van Aanholt's deeper. There's the ball into Matic.\n48:21 Comment: He's onside. And he takes a nice touch.\n48:24 Comment: Both centre-backs are advanced to the game.\n48:27 Comment: Both full-backs are deeper. That causes all sorts of problems.\n48:30 Comment: This time it's Matic breaking forward from midfield.\n48:34 Comment: Lovely little cushioned header. And a super finish.\n48:38 Comment: A horrible finish to the first half for Sunderland.\n48:41 Comment: But a very, very good one for Chelsea.\n48:44 Comment: And it was a good one.\n48:45 Comment: And it was in the final few seconds of the first half.\n48:49 Comment: Vic Sam thought they were going in level at the break.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: on such a high when they equalized the stadium of light was buzzing big time but from a high to a low\n0:7 Comment: just like that that Matic goal which restored Chelsea's lead Sunderland have to come again\n0:15 Comment: yeah I'm pretty sure Sam Allardyce would have been having an inquest especially the two centre-backs\n0:21 Comment: why they were so high why the full-backs were so deep and so disjointed just see out the first\n0:27 Comment: half get in there on the ascendancy just the game flipped in an instant\n0:36 Comment: Mikel Ivanovic\n0:41 Comment: Hazard starting ahead of the injured Pedro\n0:49 Comment: after his wonder goal against Tottenham\n0:55 Comment: well Jermaine Defoe is working the ball in behind\n0:58 Comment: as I've been going on about in the first half Cahill on a booking he's playing on that side\n1:3 Comment: just wants it lobbed over the top for a race Cahill then can't touch him\n1:10 Comment: Ivanovic\n1:14 Comment: Willian Cabul now for Mvir here's Van Aanholt Defoe\n1:22 Comment: Kazri who scored that spectacular equalizer looking for another opening here\n1:27 Comment: just trying to do a little bit too much perhaps yeah they had Van Aanholt in the 8c\n1:33 Comment: Kershoff Willian slipped and Kershoff found his route blocked by Terry\n1:40 Comment: Yedlin ready to return it perhaps\n1:45 Comment: they seem to quite have it under control\n1:50 Comment: Diego Costa Cabul will get there ahead of Hazard\n1:57 Comment: Van Aanholt\n2:7 Comment: Sunderland need to dig deep and bounce back again\n2:17 Comment: Kazri\n2:18 Comment: will not let it go\n2:43 Comment: Uwe Hum क state of pressure stays onチャンネル for the right-hand dreader\n2:45 Comment: before the stroke hit the pot\n2:46 Comment: big shot for defoe\n2:47 Comment: Spread the play nicely, just fed into there, Barini's close,\n2:52 Comment: Devoe just couldn't get it on the end of it at the back post.\n2:57 Comment: It's thought to me that his last eight goals have come away from home,\n3:1 Comment: Jermaine Defoe, Sunderland felt there might have been a handball there from Fabregas,\n3:5 Comment: there's Pellequitas cross here, Fabregas stopped.\n3:12 Comment: It's actually Mvir who got back to dig that out to Sunderland.\n3:16 Comment: Yeah, super play, midfield play, one minute he's up,\n3:20 Comment: in the final third the next he's back cleaning up the danger.\n3:29 Comment: Chelsea have won more away games than home this season.\n3:34 Comment: Hazard, he's got Diego Costa moving ahead, it's Costa!\n3:38 Comment: It's a critical save for Manoni.\n3:41 Comment: Yeah, big stop there, great run from Costa,\n3:45 Comment: and a little feed-in.\n3:46 Comment: A little win from Hazard.\n3:49 Comment: Kazric, advancing.\n3:53 Comment: Defoe.\n3:56 Comment: Jermaine Defoe sees his route blocked by Gary Cahill.\n4:0 Comment: Yeah, he was helped out by Ivanovic as well, doubling up.\n4:13 Comment: Van Aanholt.\n4:16 Comment: Doreenie.\n4:18 Comment: Van Aanholt was shut off there by John Obi Mikel,\n4:22 Comment: a free kick on the edge of the area.\n4:27 Comment: Yeah, Van Aanholt's just going for the little give and go.\n4:30 Comment: There it is there inside, Mikel having no interest in the ball whatsoever.\n4:34 Comment: Just steps across Patrick Van Aanholt, but this is a chance,\n4:38 Comment: it's a super run from Costa.\n4:40 Comment: But it's straight at Manoni, thankfully for Sunderland.\n4:42 Comment: And...\n4:46 Comment: ...\n4:52 Comment: Well, Kazric has already scored a screamer.\n4:55 Comment: He might fancy a repeat of that.\n5:2 Comment: Kabul and Kershoff in there.\n5:10 Comment: Kazric and Ekster floated in.\n5:13 Comment: Courtois ball.\n5:14 Comment: ...\n5:45 Comment: Babragas\n5:54 Comment: Ivanovic\n5:59 Comment: Sunderland are gonna have to bring on John O'Shea for Lamina Kone shortly\n6:6 Comment: Chelsea keeping the ball again Ivanovic\n6:19 Comment: Hazard\n6:22 Comment: taken out by Cadamore who will probably receive a yellow card\n6:26 Comment: yeah it's not it's not a dirty one whether he's gonna hurt Hazard I think\n6:30 Comment: it's just a trip Hazard with a lovely little back heel turn and then\n6:36 Comment: just puts on the afterburners.

    "summary": "In a thrilling Premier League encounter, Sunderland edged Chelsea 3-2 in a match that encapsulated the passion, drama, and unpredictability of football. Billed as a must-win fixture for Sunderland to boost their survival hopes, the game lived up to its high stakes, offering moments of brilliance, tension, and controversy.\n\n**First Half:**\n\nSunderland started with a sense of urgency, understanding the gravity of their situation. They needed to maintain a position among the elite of English football. The initial minutes saw a few anxious moments, with Gary Cahill receiving a yellow card very early on for a foul on Jermain Defoe, bringing Sunderland fans to their feet as they anticipated an early breakthrough. Wahbi Khazri stepped up for the resulting free kick but could only manage a shot that deflected off the wall, falling to Eden Hazard who guided the play away.\n\nDespite the cagey start, Sunderland were eager to show intent. Fabio Borini and Defoe combined well but couldn't pierce through the steady Chelsea defense. Chelsea, who had a formidable record at the Stadium of Light, started asserting themselves. Diego Costa, operating as the focal point up front, constantly put pressure on Sunderland's backline.\n\nThe breakthrough came when Chelsea’s persistence paid off, exploiting a bit of misfortune for Sunderland. Diego Costa, alert to a deflection off Yedlin, seized the opportunity and slotted it past Sunderland's keeper, Manone, with composure. This goal underlined Chelsea's efficiency in front of goal and was Costa's 16th of the season, leaving Sunderland trailing.\n\nDetermined not to be pushed into a corner, Sunderland fought back. Their resilience was rewarded spectacularly later in the half. Wahbi Khazri, who had been industrious throughout, scored a phenomenal goal, a screamer from the edge of the area that left the Chelsea defense and their keeper, Thibaut Courtois, helpless. The Stadium of Light erupted as the goal breathed new life into Sunderland's survival bid.\n\nHowever, the joy was short-lived. Just as Sunderland thought they’d see the half out on level terms, Chelsea struck a telling blow in stoppage time. Nemanja Matic, another dynamic presence in midfield, found the net after a quick exchange between the Chelsea forwards. This cruel twist, right at the stroke of halftime, saw Sunderland heading to the dressing room with the score at 2-1 to Chelsea.\n\n**Second Half:**\n\nComing out for the second half, Sunderland knew the importance of getting back on level terms quickly. Manager Sam Allardyce seemed to have galvanized his squad, who displayed an intense work ethic and desire.\n\nChelsea, though, almost silenced the home crowd once more as Diego Costa forced an excellent save from Vito Mannone. This seemed to act as a catalyst for Sunderland who, backed by their vociferous fans, gradually began to exert more pressure. Van Aanholt and Kazri were instrumental in these efforts, utilizing the flanks effectively.\n\nThe game changed with the introduction of Duncan Watmore and John O'Shea, who brought added energy and experience to Sunderland’s tactics. During a sustained period of pressure, Sunderland’s persistence paid off again. An attacking push saw Borini find a bit of space, and his powerful shot could only be parried by Courtois, as the ball found its way into the net. It was a crucial equalizer that reinvigorated Sunderland and their supporters, setting up a nervy final segment to the match.\n\nChelsea signaled their intent to throw everything forward with the introduction of Bertrand Traore and Oscar. But Sunderland continued to show remarkable resilience and managed to turn the game on its head. Another significant moment came soon after, when Jermain Defoe found himself in the right place at the right time. The seasoned striker latched onto a well-timed pass and delivered a clinical finish, sending the Stadium of Light into raptures. Defoe’s goal made it 3-2, completing a remarkable turnaround and highlighting his value to Sunderland’s survival quest.\n\nAs the match edged closer to its conclusion, the tension escalated. Chelsea, now behind, pressed desperately for an equalizer. Sunderland, knowing the importance of holding onto their lead, defended with determination, their every clearance greeted with cheers from the home fans. The drama peaked when John Terry, Chelsea’s iconic captain, received a second yellow card for a clumsy challenge on Khazri, reducing the London club to ten men and further complicating their pursuit of a draw.\n\nThe final moments of the match were filled with frantic, edge-of-the-seat action. Sunderland had to negotiate several nervy situations, but Vito Mannone’s standout saves and the steadfast defense ensured that Chelsea couldn’t find a way back. When the final whistle blew, the roar from the Sunderland faithful was deafening - they had witnessed a memorable and potentially season-defining victory.\n\nIn summary, this match was a microcosm of the trials and triumphs of a Premier League relegation battle. Sunderland showed heart, resilience, and no small amount of skill to overcome Chelsea, who themselves were no pushovers despite having little left to play for in the league. For Sunderland, every player contributed to a memorable victory that threw a lifeline to their hopes of staying in the Premier League. \n\nTheir triumph against Chelsea was not just about the three points but about the character shown in adversity, the tactical nous to overturn deficits, and the collective spirit of a team fighting for its very existence among England’s footballing elite. As the relegation battle looms large on the horizon, this game will be remembered as a pivotal moment for Sunderland and their supporters."
