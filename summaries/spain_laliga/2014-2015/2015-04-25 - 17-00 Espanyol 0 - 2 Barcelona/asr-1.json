    "input": "\n    Espanyol 0 - 2 Barcelona\n\nFirst Half:\n\n0:0 Comment: Suarez as 11 and let's not forget Suarez took a while before he made his debut. Anyhow it's Barcelona\n0:5 Comment: kicking from right to left across your screens. Vital game one they do need to win because let's\n0:10 Comment: remind you even though they are two points ahead of Real Madrid, Real Madrid have a superior\n0:15 Comment: head-to-head goal difference because they beat them 3-1 in the Santiago Bernabéu whereas\n0:21 Comment: not so long ago Barca beat Real Madrid by two goals to one in the camp. Now that would mean in the\n0:25 Comment: event of them ending the season level on points Madrid would be on top.\n0:32 Comment: And is Rafinha getting a touch and it goes back to Piqué.\n0:38 Comment: Spreads it out to Jordi Alba.\n0:44 Comment: And Javier Mascherano. Also finding his feet in up front for Espanyol is big number 20\n0:51 Comment: Ecuadorian striker Felipe Caicedo who's very impressive against Villarreal recently.\n0:57 Comment: He's got nine goals this time around. Good pressuring in the back in the middle there\n1:4 Comment: from Barcelona on Abram but Espanyol coming away with the ball. Duarte looking to get things going.\n1:21 Comment: Looking for Leo Messi but that was easily cut out. It's with Cañas to Lucas. Unknown from Real Madrid\n1:28 Comment: Lucas Vázquez so he's obviously got a bit of an incentive to perform today. I'm sure they'll be\n1:34 Comment: very happy at Madrid for him to give them a helping hand today. So here the crowd in Correa\n1:43 Comment: giving Barcelona but I think it's not full um which is a little bit disappointing I think\n1:49 Comment: you know it's been that I think it's four o'clock local time but I think Barcelona derby. I was quite\n1:54 Comment: surprised there before the game you can see quite a lot of gaps in in the stands that's Barcelona\n1:58 Comment: but it was the biggest game for Espanyol at home. Hang on a second here come Barcelona on the attack.\n2:5 Comment: Kiko Garcia does well to save but you get the feeling that Barca should have done a bit better\n2:9 Comment: there. I think Kiko Garcia actually did brilliantly today. He looked like he got a deflection which\n2:14 Comment: could have caught him out but he did well to react to it. Rafinha to Jordi Alba.\n2:21 Comment: I wonder if Neymar was caught in two minds on that chance. We'll have a look again in a moment\n2:27 Comment: I'm sure. Once again it's Mascherano. A jefecito to Pique. Looking to sweep things up and find\n2:36 Comment: Andres Iniesta. Iniesta had possibly his best 45 minutes of the season on Tuesday against Paris\n2:43 Comment: Saint-Germain. Fantastic move since Seneb Barca's opening. Brilliant burst of pace as well which\n2:48 Comment: hadn't seen from Iniesta for a few years. The press were quick to pick up on it as well.\n2:52 Comment: Iniesta's back and he said it he said he'd never been away. Rafinha. A jefecito turn to Neymar.\n3:5 Comment: Barcelona controlling the ball right from the start.\n3:13 Comment: We get the sense looking at these first minutes much like Barca last week.\n3:17 Comment: It's like possessions can be heavily in their favor. Espanyol no rush\n3:21 Comment: to run out and push Pique or Mascherano on the ball. Exactly I guess the thing was last week Valencia\n3:28 Comment: if you saw that game pressured Barca much higher up the field right from the off caused them all\n3:33 Comment: sorts of problems. Rafinha once again nice footwork from Neymar.\n3:40 Comment: Rafinha once again nice footwork from the young midfielder.\n3:49 Comment: And Pique again. Barca edging forward. Espanyol looking increasingly compact.\n3:56 Comment: It's messy just takes a little flick from Busquets. It's another chance for Neymar.\n4:0 Comment: Stickel through the middle just loses his balance and the ball goes through to Gacidia.\n4:5 Comment: Espanyol fans think he may have just taken a little bit of a tumble that.\n4:12 Comment: Espanyol fans are all looking at us here.\n4:15 Comment: I think it's just going off balance rather than diving. Here's the chance lovely bit of interplay.\n4:21 Comment: Onside yeah. He's trying to cross it to Suarez actually rather than shoot it.\n4:29 Comment: There was I think he'd have been greedy maybe he should have been.\n4:31 Comment: Well Barcelona gaining the recovering possession after about 10 seconds. Espanyol\n4:37 Comment: having the ball and it's with Suarez who gives it back to Iniesta.\n4:44 Comment: And Alba and Neymar once again.\n4:48 Comment: Messi.\n4:53 Comment: Still Leo Messi. Apparently he has a couple of new tattoos on display.\n4:56 Comment: Looking at the papers today unfortunately he's got um.\n5:0 Comment: Alba on the end of that one. It's Gacidia once again. Still a dangerous not cleared.\n5:8 Comment: Kiko Gacidia denies Luis Suarez there.\n5:13 Comment: Very good save. Look at it here from the from the replay.\n5:17 Comment: That's a great save. Has to get down. It's not exactly going at his body. It's not as if the\n5:21 Comment: head has gone into him. Suarez does everything here. He knocks it down.\n5:24 Comment: Suarez does everything here. He knocks it down. He tries to keep it low. Very good save.\n5:31 Comment: So five minutes gone. Two good chances for Barcelona already.\n5:43 Comment: It's charged down. Timid appeals for offside. So for handball and that one sent straight out.\n5:49 Comment: So five minutes gone. Barcelona having two chances already. The first carved out by Neymar.\n5:58 Comment: And the second one. Jordi Alba gets in really well behind the defense and Suarez\n6:4 Comment: sees that goal bound header denied by Kiko Gacidia.\n6:8 Comment: Despite everything. Well, despite everything. I think a lot of people thought Espanyol might be struggling a bit more this season.\n6:25 Comment: It's all very well said here. I think the slight dent in this season for Espanyol was that cup\n6:33 Comment: semi-final where after the first leg there was a big sense around Barcelona that they were going to\n6:38 Comment: reach that final against Barcelona. It would have been a Barcelona derby in the cup final.\n6:43 Comment: And I feel that was just a big blow for the fans. It's the only maybe the slight blemish in Sergio's\n6:51 Comment: season. Well, he reached the semi-final. I mean he took over after just six months inside\n6:57 Comment: of the B team. A lot of people thought he was a cheap option. Proved them wrong.\n7:3 Comment: Dani Alves getting a little bit of manhandling there from Caicedo.\n7:8 Comment: Taken very quickly by Barcelona once again. It's out wide. Suarez looks to not make Moreno but he goes out for a goal kick.\n7:18 Comment: Tom Moreno, the Mexican across, missed part of the season after an injury. He suffered in the World Cup final.\n7:26 Comment: In the World Cup finals he picked up an injury. Broke his leg in fact.\n7:32 Comment: Also a player who's been linked for about a season and a half now with clubs all over Europe.\n7:39 Comment: It's difficult for Espanyol to hold on to any of their players. They're more of a selling club.\n7:43 Comment: Sort of Eric Bailly earlier in the season. The young Ivorian defender who's looking brilliant\n7:49 Comment: coming through. Literally just broke his foot. He's got the VRL. Snatched him up.\n7:55 Comment: Luis Enrique. I wonder what he's obviously trying to put. He tried to put a very positive face on the\n8:0 Comment: Champions League draw against Bayern. Against obviously Pep Guardiola who is his friend and\n8:4 Comment: who was first team coach when Luis Enrique was the B team coach here. But the fact is there's\n8:8 Comment: no way getting around it. It is gonna lead to comparisons isn't it? It's difficult and it's a bit unfair but\n8:16 Comment: he is sooner along the line going to be compared to Pep Guardiola. As we said after 50 games he's\n8:21 Comment: actually got better numbers than Pep. Yeah well that's the thing. Luis Enrique despite a lot of criticism\n8:28 Comment: is having a brilliant season. The final of the cup. Barcelona are fresh at the end of the season.\n8:32 Comment: They're playing good football. They're top of the league. They're in the same as the Champions League.\n8:36 Comment: People just can't get that tag off him. Suarez turns.\n8:41 Comment: Pulls that one across the far post. It's only half cleared as far as Dani Alves.\n8:50 Comment: Suarez moving out wide now. Still all Barcelona's opening nine minutes.\n8:56 Comment: Two good chances so far. Two good responses from Kiko Kasia.\n9:1 Comment: Kanyas in there to dispossess Neymar.\n9:9 Comment: Luis García to Caicedo. Good challenge from Macerano.\n9:16 Comment: Rafinha moving things to Barca.\n9:18 Comment: Busquets. Good pressure from Sergio García. Caicedo's picked himself up. He seems to be okay.\n9:36 Comment: Good challenge. Once again Busquets.\n9:45 Comment: Rafinha.\n9:51 Comment: It's a bit of Alves. If he just gets in the way a little bit.\n9:56 Comment: So Alba rather than Alves.\n10:5 Comment: Now this is Amarilla to see that one out for a throw in.\n10:9 Comment: We see how the game is panning out to be one of those classic Barcelona patient games where\n10:15 Comment: they're going to have the ball. They're going to be in that final third slowly going from side to\n10:19 Comment: side with 11 players boxed in. And as much as the as long as the clock keeps on ticking\n10:28 Comment: the more anxious they're probably going to get. We've seen it a million times.\n10:32 Comment: Exactly. We have to say a draw isn't a good result for them.\n10:36 Comment: Another little flick just over the bar. The offside flag was up though against Neymar on this occasion.\n10:45 Comment: Wouldn't have counted if it had gone in. As the gentleman behind him seems to be reminding him.\n10:53 Comment: Very tight. It's Alvaro who's actually waiting with his hand up saying oh\n11:1 Comment: offside. I don't know if he was. The referee gave it which is the important thing.\n11:6 Comment: That's normally the player waving his arm.\n11:12 Comment: A little bit of space now is there for\n11:16 Comment: for Lucas.\n11:19 Comment: Dispossessed quickly by Jordi Alba.\n11:24 Comment: Once again Busquets.\n11:26 Comment: Tomas Serrano to start again for Barcelona.\n11:31 Comment: The one thing though about the difference I'm seeing in this game from other\n11:36 Comment: games which have panned out like this for Barcelona is that they have\n11:39 Comment: found two or three occasions where despite being a number of Espanol players in the box\n11:44 Comment: they've carved them open with passes like this in between the lines.\n11:48 Comment: Perhaps there's a slight little gap there they can exploit in between\n11:51 Comment: They've had a couple of clear chances in that one which was ruled out for offside wrongly so.\n11:58 Comment: Still got to be careful at the back though and there Mascherano to Bravo.\n12:2 Comment: Very calmly gives that to the number 14.\n12:9 Comment: Neymar loses that one. He's trying to be a bit too clever but Iniesta and Busquets between them\n12:14 Comment: start the monologue again. Rafinha spreads it out to Dani Alves.\n12:19 Comment: Messi dropping deep.\n12:22 Comment: Kanye's looking to close down Messi but it's with Neymar. Messi into space. Suarez!\n12:30 Comment: And offside. Up against the Uruguayan. That one did look a bit clearer.\n12:43 Comment: And that one is exhausted.\n12:45 Comment: And that one is exactly a lot clearer but once again Barcelona finding the men when they need to.\n12:54 Comment: They're finding it. 1-2's Messi with a big gap there to play the ball to Suarez.\n13:1 Comment: Even if Suarez was offside Messi still had way too much time and space in that sort of area.\n13:6 Comment: It's another ball over the top this time. Espanyol have pushed forward a wee bit.\n13:8 Comment: It's just given Neymar space to run into. He's got Arriba in front of him. He's done well there.\n13:15 Comment: Tabasco. Not quite so well that time. He's got away with it.\n13:24 Comment: And Sergio Garcia. Although Mateo...\n13:29 Comment: Full play up for a free kick for Espanyol.\n13:33 Comment: Takes a little bit of contact in the back there from Pique and I think the way things are going rather than have the advantage of Espanyol probably would rather have the chance of a set piece to get that ball forward. Lucas is out wide on the right in space. Goes the other way.\n13:55 Comment: And that is wasted. Alves happy to see that one out for a goal kick.\n14:1 Comment: That makes no sense though. Even if he had got that to his team. It was on his own.\n14:7 Comment: With the long ball coming from the air miles away. What's he going to do if he even gets to control that ball?\n14:12 Comment: I think if he's going to hump it forward and attack the penalty spot he's probably going to hope for some chaos and see what happens.\n14:17 Comment: Get Caicedo in there please.\n14:26 Comment: Anyhow, back with Barcelona. Alves and Rafinha. Stange a couple of passes. He goes across to Pique.\n14:36 Comment: Macerano. Alves is in space and he picks him out.\n14:44 Comment: Messi very mobile as usual.\n14:47 Comment: Easily recognisable with his arm warmers on.\n14:50 Comment: Alves has to actually protect his tattoos or if he's feeling the cold because it's only like 22 degrees here in Barcelona this afternoon.\n14:58 Comment: Done well there Sergio Garcia just pulling back. Creates a little bit of space but it's passed to Alves.\n15:6 Comment: Or to Alvaro who was intercepted.\n15:10 Comment: And by Alves who was fouled.\n15:16 Comment: Back with Barcelona. Passed the 15 minute mark. There's a possession 77% for Barcelona.\n15:26 Comment: 23 for Espanyol.\n15:32 Comment: Still feel that 23 is a little bit generous.\n15:36 Comment: There you see Espanyol completing 26 passes in 15 minutes. Barcelona 194.\n15:46 Comment: Wow. That's what I can say. I think that is rather relevant isn't it?\n15:54 Comment: Surely just looking at that if you've completed 26 passes you surely don't have 23% of possession.\n16:0 Comment: But when the ball's out for set pieces that does count as being in your possession apparently. I suppose.\n16:6 Comment: That's probably what it is. For the statisticians among you.\n16:16 Comment: Barcelona with the rondo.\n16:18 Comment: It's Messi.\n16:24 Comment: Once again Leo Messi.\n16:28 Comment: Slips that one forward. Showed his patience. Alvar!\n16:30 Comment: And that is a fantastic opening goal from Football Club Barcelona. Neymar's a scorer.\n16:36 Comment: But take what you see in the replay. Just sit back and unless you're an Espanyol fan just enjoy the football on display there.\n16:44 Comment: You thought Messi was doing nothing there.\n16:46 Comment: Two or three passes with Busquets. Thank you very much.\n16:49 Comment: Diagonal ball into space. First time cross from Alvar.\n16:53 Comment: The dummy from Suarez and the finish. Outstanding football from Barcelona who now lead 1-0.\n16:59 Comment: One of the biggest weapons this Barcelona side have used in past seasons is the full backs.\n17:5 Comment: Marauding forward and Jordi Alba always. Once he gets going he's just an express train.\n17:10 Comment: There's no following. He's got absolutely brimming with pace.\n17:13 Comment: You'll see. Look at this again. Alvar first time.\n17:16 Comment: You think Suarez is going to score. He leaves it. Fools everybody.\n17:20 Comment: But you know they're talking about the Madrid Triple E, BBC, Benzema, Bale and Cristiano.\n17:27 Comment: But the understanding here is just you can't buy that with money.\n17:32 Comment: That's incredible. Suarez is running at that ball. At no moment do you see him look behind him.\n17:37 Comment: He knows. He's aware of the situation. He knows Neymar is going to attack the back post without even looking.\n17:42 Comment: The dummy fools about three Espanyol defenders. A big chunk of that goal is that dummy from Luis Suarez.\n17:48 Comment: Who could possibly have scored himself had he tried. Outstanding goal from Barcelona.\n17:54 Comment: So they've broken the deadlock here which is quite often the toughest thing to do.\n18:0 Comment: Can Espanyol get back into things quickly? They have a free kick.\n18:3 Comment: A free kick. About 10 yards into the Barcelona half.\n18:13 Comment: A bit of a push there from Moreno.\n18:17 Comment: Just another thing there about that goal. Luis Suarez is a player who I think stats don't do him justice.\n18:24 Comment: That's the thing about football. Some players you just can't read into stats to see just how effective they are to a side.\n18:30 Comment: That dummy doesn't go down as anything. Doesn't even go down as contact with the ball.\n18:35 Comment: Exactly. And there's a lot of things like that he does. Pressing, runs, dragging defenders.\n18:41 Comment: Such a very clever player. Incredibly intelligent football player.\n18:45 Comment: Albert does well. Doesn't keep it in though but it was still a decent leap from the left back.\n18:50 Comment: Arriba will take the throne for Espanyol.\n19:3 Comment: Sergio Garcia but dispossessed by Busquets and Macherano.\n19:9 Comment: A little bit of pressure there from the striker.\n19:12 Comment: As is Leo Messi working deep and getting himself into a little bit of trouble.\n19:17 Comment: Victor Alvarez. But Barcelona look to be up for this.\n19:24 Comment: Good advantage played by Mateu Loth. You might think about having a word with the Espanyol player afterwards.\n19:30 Comment: Messi twists Kanyas inside and out and now just overhitting that pass towards Neymar.\n19:47 Comment: Kanyas back at Espanyol after... well back in Spain after an unsuccessful season with Swansea last year.\n19:57 Comment: From a Betis player.\n20:3 Comment: Which gets impeded enough there. Neymar for the referee to give a free kick.\n20:17 Comment: Busquets wins another ball in the middle of the park. He's swept everything up today, hasn't he?\n20:33 Comment: So far 20 minutes gone. Barcelona 1-0. That goal scored three minutes ago by Neymar after a splendid team move by Barcelona.\n20:40 Comment: He's just brought Espanyol forward a few yards to try and increase the pressure on Barcelona.\n20:46 Comment: There's no point defending a 1-0 defeat. Long way to go yet though.\n20:50 Comment: Busquets.\n20:54 Comment: Alba to Neymar. Alba carries on his run.\n20:57 Comment: Carlos Paz there and Sergio Garcia collects but the ball lasts about half a second with the Espanyol forward as we go to the Dani Iarque 21st minute applause.\n21:19 Comment: Barcelona keep in possession.\n21:28 Comment: A bit of pressure there from Sergio Garcia.\n21:37 Comment: Macerano has descended across the pique and gets it back from the central defender.\n21:42 Comment: It might have gone all the way back to Brava. That wasn't quite as intelligent from Sergio Garcia.\n21:47 Comment: Here we have Dani Iarque, the former Espanyol captain who unfortunately died of heart failure in pre-season a few years ago while in Italy.\n21:58 Comment: Nice to see that he's still remembered though every single home game that 21st minute.\n22:4 Comment: Sergio Garcia booked for that.\n22:7 Comment: Macerano was waiting for him there, inviting him in.\n22:11 Comment: It's an unnecessary challenge there from the Espanyol striker.\n22:20 Comment: Just to push the midway point in the first half is Macerano.\n22:28 Comment: To Iniesta.\n22:31 Comment: Once again Lionel Messi dropping deep from Barcelona.\n22:34 Comment: He's trying to exploit a bit of space.\n22:37 Comment: When he does Messi's he drops deep. Somebody has to come with him and then they look to knock it in behind him.\n22:44 Comment: Talking of intelligent players, Messi right up there.\n22:49 Comment: It's been Neymar's side, it's not quite working out for them this time but Barcelona get the throw in.\n23:0 Comment: Nice to stay down for a moment.\n23:10 Comment: Mateu lost his cursor to see what's wrong with him.\n23:15 Comment: As Alba loses possession.\n23:26 Comment: Rafinha thumps that one forward.\n23:32 Comment: It's not an easy day to be Felipe Caicedo today.\n23:36 Comment: When you see that ball that's just gone forward towards him there's nothing you can do with that.\n23:41 Comment: Look at him, Neymar.\n23:44 Comment: Just a little hand isn't it in the hand of Ia.\n23:47 Comment: Nothing's going to keep you down though is it?\n23:50 Comment: Unless it catches you in a delicate spot.\n23:54 Comment: Victor Alvarez for Espanyol.\n23:57 Comment: Once again Macerano cuts it out.\n24:0 Comment: Iniesta looking confident again today.\n24:3 Comment: Andres Iniesta to Neymar.\n24:5 Comment: If he looks up he's got Alves with acres of space.\n24:8 Comment: Alves still in mace acres of space.\n24:17 Comment: A little bit too long to get it out to him perhaps.\n24:19 Comment: There he is, Dani Alves.\n24:20 Comment: He's waited, patience brings its own reward.\n24:22 Comment: He sends it down the line to Luis Suarez.\n24:27 Comment: Suarez looks to have a go at Duarte.\n24:29 Comment: In the end it comes to Iniesta.\n24:33 Comment: Messi!\n24:35 Comment: Iniesta!\n24:37 Comment: Messi makes it 2-0 to FC Barcelona.\n24:42 Comment: Once again Barcelona's passing rips their rivals apart.\n24:49 Comment: And Messi after looking for a fraction of a second like he made a mess of it\n24:53 Comment: puts the ball in the back of the net.\n24:55 Comment: One might have a replay just to see if there is an offside.\n24:57 Comment: On first impressions I thought Luis Suarez might have been offside.\n25:3 Comment: If he's not, again it's devastating football from Barcelona.\n25:7 Comment: How they can link up between three players in such a close proximity inside the box is amazing.\n25:12 Comment: And again Suarez, that ability to find the player who's on mark.\n25:17 Comment: Look at it here.\n25:18 Comment: Let's have a look at this, right.\n25:19 Comment: Is there an offside in this move?\n25:21 Comment: I'm going to say there is.\n25:24 Comment: There isn't here.\n25:26 Comment: But I think Suarez should have been called offside.\n25:29 Comment: Not here.\n25:31 Comment: It's when the ball comes over the top.\n25:34 Comment: This again here is what's brilliant from Suarez.\n25:36 Comment: Another player would give that ball to Iniesta and forget about it.\n25:39 Comment: He gives the ball, he runs across.\n25:41 Comment: And then Iniesta picks him out over the top.\n25:43 Comment: Probably as you say offside I'd be inclined to say that maybe he is a fraction offside.\n25:49 Comment: The interchange is great but...\n25:52 Comment: There's that slight doubt.\n25:54 Comment: I have no doubts.\n25:55 Comment: No doubts, okay.\n25:59 Comment: So a little bit of controversy in the second goal.\n26:2 Comment: That should take too much away from what we're seeing from Barcelona.\n26:5 Comment: We're seeing another 26 minutes of exceptional football from...\n26:10 Comment: Well, I was going to say from the Catalans but in this case they're both Catalan sides.\n26:14 Comment: Let's not forget though against Sevilla in the Sanchez-Pirouan.\n26:17 Comment: Barca produced one of their best halves of the campaign and they ended up having to settle for a draw.\n26:23 Comment: Sevilla possibly a better side than Espanyol I think.\n26:28 Comment: Still a long way to go in this game.\n26:34 Comment: I'm hoping Luis Enrique gets the credit he deserves.\n26:38 Comment: And I bang on about it quite a bit but...\n26:41 Comment: The way this Barca side has been pressing of late against PSG today.\n26:45 Comment: They just look that much better than last year.\n26:49 Comment: The thing is last season and the season before you got the impression in the last two or three months.\n26:54 Comment: For example 2013 Barca played Bayern in the last 7-0 in aggregate.\n26:59 Comment: Got the impression of a side running on empty even though they ended up winning the league.\n27:3 Comment: Last season you got the impression of a side that physically just ran out of steam as the season came to a key moment.\n27:10 Comment: This season what you're seeing is a Barca that actually looks to be getting better.\n27:13 Comment: And is playing more games than anybody.\n27:16 Comment: And a lot of that is down to all those rotations that Luis Enrique has made that were questioned back when they were done.\n27:22 Comment: Now it's reaping its rewards.\n27:24 Comment: And for me clear favourites for the Champions League.\n27:53 Comment: It's decent delivery into the box.\n27:55 Comment: Mascherano clears.\n27:58 Comment: Nice control there from Abraham.\n28:1 Comment: Spaniol enjoying a little spell of possession.\n28:4 Comment: Lucas slips after flicking it forward and Mascherano gives it back to Bravo.\n28:10 Comment: Once again Caicedo pressures.\n28:18 Comment: Jordi Alba.\n28:20 Comment: To Piquet.\n28:24 Comment: Very comfy Gerard Piquet today.\n28:28 Comment: Just there available as a spare man.\n28:31 Comment: It's the kind of game he enjoys I suppose.\n28:34 Comment: A lot of time on the board to just spread passes around.\n28:37 Comment: No one pressing on him, no one biting at his ankles.\n28:42 Comment: Messi once again just brings it down, opens it up to Alves.\n28:45 Comment: And again Jordi Alba.\n28:47 Comment: Neymar.\n28:54 Comment: Candre Siniesta.\n29:1 Comment: Caicedo does well.\n29:2 Comment: Piquet does better intercepts.\n29:6 Comment: As Mateo decides that's a free kick.\n29:10 Comment: As we're approaching the half hour.\n29:13 Comment: Again that was the best Caicedo could hope for.\n29:15 Comment: To get a foul.\n29:17 Comment: Such a solitary figure up front.\n29:21 Comment: Yeah, Mascherano does just have a little high foot on him there.\n29:25 Comment: Well seen by the ref.\n29:28 Comment: The drawing in terms of fouls given away a bit carelessly.\n29:32 Comment: 6-5 now to Espanyol in the foul camp.\n29:35 Comment: Neymar brought down.\n29:36 Comment: Messi directing things.\n29:38 Comment: Rafinha.\n29:41 Comment: And looked at Dani Alves on the right and thought now I'm going the other way.\n29:45 Comment: Siniesta.\n29:49 Comment: A lot of play has been down the left wing much more than it has been on the right wing.\n29:53 Comment: Surprisingly enough Alves is always such a focal player in every Barcelona attack.\n29:59 Comment: But today they've opted to go down the left wing.\n30:1 Comment: They have got options on both sides.\n30:3 Comment: You've got Alba and Alves.\n30:5 Comment: They will miss Alves if he decides in the end to not sign a new contract.\n30:11 Comment: I understand why he wouldn't want a one year deal depending on appearances.\n30:16 Comment: Somewhere in England he could probably sign for three.\n30:20 Comment: Once again Busquets and Messi just.\n30:24 Comment: They've got a lot of options.\n30:25 Comment: He could probably sign for three.\n30:28 Comment: Once again Busquets and Messi just.\n30:31 Comment: Playing it short.\n30:35 Comment: There is Messi.\n30:37 Comment: Since every third sub to the ball seems to be him.\n30:40 Comment: Siniesta.\n30:41 Comment: Asadana doesn't quite read that one.\n30:45 Comment: He just makes a slightly unforced error.\n30:55 Comment: Give him the offside.\n30:56 Comment: I don't understand why he is not ready to play it.\n31:3 Comment: No real need to give the offside this season.\n31:6 Comment: Casillas just pumps it forward.\n31:11 Comment: Quite an interesting banner there on the far side of the stand.\n31:14 Comment: It says Catalunya is Messi's club.\n31:17 Comment: You see Barcelona.\n31:19 Comment: Always made.\n31:22 Comment: Across the world.\n31:23 Comment: They themselves appear the club in Catalonia.\n31:26 Comment: The team in the Catalan region that represents Catalonia.\n31:29 Comment: An independent.\n31:31 Comment: The independence movement perhaps.\n31:33 Comment: Which is logical really.\n31:34 Comment: Especially if the other team is called Espanyol.\n31:37 Comment: But there is a banner there that says Catalonia is more than one club.\n31:42 Comment: Which is true because you think of Madrid and it's not just Real Madrid.\n31:46 Comment: It's Atletico and Rayo as well.\n31:49 Comment: They are possibly out of most big footballing cities in Europe.\n31:55 Comment: The most one-sided derby.\n31:58 Comment: And probably the most one-sided city in terms of one club having the power and everything.\n32:3 Comment: Exactly. Political, economic, etc.\n32:10 Comment: Lucas goes into...\n32:13 Comment: Iniesta.\n32:15 Comment: A little bit of a meal of it I think.\n32:21 Comment: As you know, he does get winded let's say.\n32:25 Comment: He's thinking about Barcelona.\n32:27 Comment: There's a really historic team in the Barrio Gracia Europa.\n32:30 Comment: One of the founding sides of the league.\n32:33 Comment: One of the first sides.\n32:35 Comment: Now in the third division.\n32:37 Comment: Which is like basically...\n32:40 Comment: The 15th category really in Spain.\n32:44 Comment: The fifth category really.\n32:46 Comment: I'm just talking of those slogans.\n32:49 Comment: There's another one I really like about Espanyol which is...\n32:52 Comment: It's a marvellous minority.\n32:54 Comment: That's what they call themselves.\n32:56 Comment: It's not easy living in Barcelona and deciding to choose Espanyol.\n33:0 Comment: I think some of the things the club has said is show your individualism and support Espanyol.\n33:10 Comment: Sometimes it's a bit easier isn't it to support a team that wins every week.\n33:14 Comment: That's why the hardcore fan is the fan that's there every week.\n33:19 Comment: Supporting a side that's 10th and not really aiming for everything.\n33:23 Comment: Maybe thinks about catching the underground to watch their side away from home now and then as well.\n33:28 Comment: Fraffigna, although they do tend to make away prices for these sort of games really exorbitant.\n33:34 Comment: I haven't checked to see how much they cost actually.\n33:36 Comment: Quite often for example when Getafe are at home to Real Madrid they're asking 100 euros for a ticket.\n33:41 Comment: Which is over $100 because they don't want a lot of away fans.\n33:45 Comment: To make it so they get more of an atmosphere.\n33:49 Comment: A hostile atmosphere.\n33:51 Comment: Espanyol looking to get back into this game.\n33:53 Comment: The trail at the moment.\n33:55 Comment: Two goals to nil.\n33:57 Comment: This goal scored by Neymar and Leo Messi.\n34:0 Comment: He's 36th of the season.\n34:2 Comment: It's been all Barca so far.\n34:6 Comment: But as we saw against Sevilla a couple of weeks ago.\n34:10 Comment: Two nil isn't necessarily decisive.\n34:21 Comment: And Sergio attempts to demonstrate.\n34:29 Comment: Forcing it, an error from Neymar.\n34:31 Comment: Espanyol have the throw in.\n34:33 Comment: Brings the fans here in the Power 8 stadium.\n34:37 Comment: It's a life.\n34:40 Comment: Fidel Villa.\n34:45 Comment: Álvaro.\n34:49 Comment: And Moreno.\n34:51 Comment: And Zabram.\n34:56 Comment: Just approaching the last 10 minutes of this first half.\n35:11 Comment: Cent long.\n35:13 Comment: Looking for Arrier as well.\n35:16 Comment: Sergio García.\n35:18 Comment: Only player booked so far.\n35:21 Comment: Busquets and Iniesta.\n35:24 Comment: And Pique to establish a bit of calm on proceedings.\n35:30 Comment: Muffini who's also slotted in nicely today.\n35:33 Comment: The number 12.\n35:35 Comment: Not done anything spectacular but kept the ball moving.\n35:38 Comment: This time it was Busquets who does lose out.\n35:40 Comment: That's a good ball from Caicedo but that is not great control.\n35:44 Comment: From Victor Alvarez.\n35:46 Comment: That's the best chance Espanyol have had.\n35:48 Comment: Victor, first touch took it long.\n35:50 Comment: Macerano gets across to cover.\n35:57 Comment: Good claim from Claudio Bravo.\n35:59 Comment: He's not had anything to do really so far.\n36:2 Comment: Came out there and dominated his area well.\n36:5 Comment: What we saw there really was Busquets.\n36:8 Comment: He's been so comfortable 2-0.\n36:10 Comment: Maybe that's the one danger, one threat that Barcelona could have today.\n36:14 Comment: Complacency, maybe taking their foot off the pedal, not being completely focused.\n36:19 Comment: And make a sloppy mistake like that and they almost got punished for it.\n36:23 Comment: Just pushed forward a bit now.\n36:25 Comment: The Espanyol, well I would say front five, Caicedo and Sergio García are pressing more the ball as it looks to come out.\n36:30 Comment: And Lucas.\n36:32 Comment: Cañas and...\n36:34 Comment: ...Abramo also just sending a little bit more weight to the pressure.\n36:38 Comment: And the defence is now more, is closer to the halfway line.\n36:41 Comment: Forcing Barcelona maybe to look for more direct route over the top.\n36:49 Comment: That's gone out though from Duarte.\n36:57 Comment: I still think, as opposed to that severe game, I think that the team is going to be a bit more aggressive.\n37:3 Comment: I think Barcelona's biggest threat today is themselves.\n37:7 Comment: It's how much, if they're able to keep their focus in it, concentration levels, everything.\n37:13 Comment: What happens in the game, the outcome, for me is completely in their hands.\n37:18 Comment: Whereas in the severe game, Sevilla turned it around, took it away from them.\n37:22 Comment: And we're almost in Sevilla's hands.\n37:24 Comment: And I've shown in the last week or so that there was no footnote, no coincidence.\n37:28 Comment: Great fight back against Zenit-St. Petersburg just over a week ago.\n37:31 Comment: And then getting the result they needed in Russia to qualify for the semi-finals of the Europa League.\n37:38 Comment: Again.\n37:40 Comment: It's amazing how well they've done in that competition.\n37:43 Comment: Here's Barca on the ball. Rafinha.\n37:46 Comment: So she has a little bit of neat footwork. Messi.\n37:50 Comment: To Dani Alves.\n37:59 Comment: It's again Rafinha. To Busquets.\n38:3 Comment: Just slightly careless from Busquets, but Espanyol just eased off the pressure for a bit.\n38:8 Comment: Now they're stepping on again. Look at Sergio Garcia.\n38:11 Comment: Abraham and Caicedo looking to close down Macherano.\n38:16 Comment: Shouldn't worry Barca too much.\n38:17 Comment: They might know that once they get past that line of pressure, the other thirds who have got it then work deep.\n38:22 Comment: And if Barcelona can't find spaces now, they will find them as the game progresses.\n38:33 Comment: Iniesta to Alba.\n38:38 Comment: Busquets.\n38:41 Comment: Looking for that diagonal again, but Alba hadn't made the run and Casillas collects.\n38:48 Comment: And there's a man who's really turned his reputation around.\n39:1 Comment: Remember at Roma, things didn't go too well for him.\n39:5 Comment: To give Roma's more problems with the dressing room.\n39:8 Comment: With the big names.\n39:10 Comment: Quite a spiky character, Luis Enrique.\n39:12 Comment: Turned it around at Celta, really well.\n39:15 Comment: But what I like is he showed the humility to go to Celta.\n39:19 Comment: That's true.\n39:21 Comment: Which is a decent job.\n39:23 Comment: And playing nice football and showing it again this season.\n39:26 Comment: It will be very interesting.\n39:28 Comment: I'm not convinced that Madrid's trip to Palo Alto tomorrow is not a gimme by any means.\n39:33 Comment: Not at all.\n39:35 Comment: And also those sort of sides really marking red on the calendar.\n39:40 Comment: Barcelona at home, Madrid at home.\n39:41 Comment: Those are the games you want to win.\n39:43 Comment: You're playing against the big sides.\n39:45 Comment: And it's not going to be an easy time for them.\n39:48 Comment: Alba as well to dispossess Arrilla.\n39:50 Comment: Which leaves that one a little bit short.\n39:52 Comment: But Barca come away with it.\n39:54 Comment: Busquets to thread it through.\n39:56 Comment: Neymar.\n39:58 Comment: Great save from Casillas.\n40:0 Comment: Once again the Suarez-Neymar.\n40:2 Comment: Combination so nearly.\n40:5 Comment: It's paid out for the Barca.\n40:7 Comment: Had it not been for the Espanyol keepers third decent save.\n40:11 Comment: Of the match.\n40:13 Comment: Would have been looking at 3-0 here.\n40:15 Comment: First time volley does really well Casillas.\n40:17 Comment: Luis Suarez is just a dream to play with.\n40:20 Comment: If you're an attacking player.\n40:22 Comment: You're a forward.\n40:24 Comment: He just finds any way possible to get you through on goal.\n40:27 Comment: With a dummy before.\n40:29 Comment: With a little dink there over the defence.\n40:31 Comment: It's incredible how he finds ways of setting his attacking teammates off.\n40:36 Comment: I do think a third goal in it is game over.\n40:38 Comment: The sort of thing we don't want to see.\n40:40 Comment: It's probably a flag pole.\n40:42 Comment: Don't know if it was thrown or fell or any.\n40:45 Comment: Not good.\n40:47 Comment: There's nothing right in England you can't take flags into the ground.\n40:50 Comment: Because for obvious reasons.\n40:59 Comment: Once it's taken again.\n41:9 Comment: Neymar.\n41:11 Comment: Well cleared by Sergio Garcia.\n41:17 Comment: Andres Iniesta.\n41:19 Comment: To Neymar.\n41:25 Comment: That's been sent a long way up in the air.\n41:28 Comment: And it goes out for a Barcelona throw.\n41:35 Comment: Daniel Ness will take it.\n41:38 Comment: It's a free kick.\n41:40 Comment: Now it's an Espanol throw in.\n41:42 Comment: We've got just over three minutes of normal time here in the Power 8 stadium.\n41:48 Comment: Barcelona leading by two goals.\n41:50 Comment: They're looking for that third that might just kill things off.\n41:53 Comment: And here's Leo Messi.\n41:55 Comment: Chased.\n41:57 Comment: By Lucas.\n41:59 Comment: And it's a free kick.\n42:6 Comment: And by Lucas.\n42:8 Comment: And Arrilla.\n42:10 Comment: Jordi Alba.\n42:12 Comment: Still got Messi.\n42:14 Comment: Rafinha's in support.\n42:16 Comment: Alba and Iniesta.\n42:18 Comment: Barcelona.\n42:20 Comment: Quite calm just to move the ball around.\n42:22 Comment: And once again it's a hasty from Macherano.\n42:26 Comment: Once again they see the stats.\n42:28 Comment: 74% for Barcelona.\n42:30 Comment: We're going to say we're going to round it up to 75.\n42:33 Comment: Three quarters of possession for the league leaders.\n42:36 Comment: They've just taken the foot off the gas for the last seven or eight minutes perhaps.\n42:41 Comment: They're still looking pretty comfy against Espanyol who have not yet managed a shot on target.\n42:48 Comment: Again Busquets just a little bit careless.\n42:51 Comment: Iniesta.\n42:52 Comment: Busy.\n42:53 Comment: Effective.\n42:54 Comment: Back to Pique.\n43:2 Comment: Plenty more football obviously in Spain this weekend.\n43:3 Comment: Straight after this Atletico Madrid are playing Deportivo.\n43:7 Comment: Getafe against Levante.\n43:9 Comment: And Real Sociedad entertaining game ending up the day against Villarreal this afternoon, this evening.\n43:18 Comment: Neymar.\n43:23 Comment: To Suárez.\n43:25 Comment: Messi just bundled out.\n43:27 Comment: Abraham collects the ball.\n43:30 Comment: And again out wide to Duarte.\n43:34 Comment: Clarence is charged down.\n43:43 Comment: On the left back looks for a few options.\n43:45 Comment: One of them you saw there was Victor Alvarez.\n43:48 Comment: It's difficult to see how Sergio González is going to come up with anything at half time to change this around.\n43:56 Comment: They might have to bring in Stoane but that would mean playing with three up front and playing a more direct football.\n44:1 Comment: Pressure Barca as they look to bring the ball out but obviously leave spaces in other areas.\n44:7 Comment: They get past that line of pressure.\n44:10 Comment: And Luis Enrique bearing in mind his side of the midweek round of matches.\n44:15 Comment: Somebody's enjoying a big cigar down there.\n44:17 Comment: If I may just comment.\n44:18 Comment: Suárez curls that shot down wide.\n44:20 Comment: It's not been the first time I've seen it.\n44:22 Comment: A couple of times.\n44:23 Comment: I was thinking are you allowed to smoke in stadiums in Spain?\n44:26 Comment: You are in some.\n44:28 Comment: Obviously in this one.\n44:31 Comment: I'm not sure if it's the new San Mames.\n44:33 Comment: I'm not sure if it's been.\n44:34 Comment: No it still has been.\n44:35 Comment: I think there's moves to ban it.\n44:38 Comment: But I do like to see someone there with an enormous great cigar.\n44:44 Comment: Which is a spectacle of the gentleman in front of our camera is smoking.\n44:53 Comment: Closing seconds of normal time.\n44:57 Comment: I think that's the club just saying please don't finish.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: by doing that, what a severe spanner in the works of Barcelona's title chances.\n0:6 Comment: Things have to change though, whether or not we can see them change over the next 45 minutes,\n0:11 Comment: we'll find out between myself and Bruno. Bruno, how do you see the second half panning out?\n0:16 Comment: As you say, things have got to change drastically from the first half for anything to change on the scoreline.\n0:23 Comment: And the biggest worry for Espanyol is what I said in the first half,\n0:27 Comment: the main thing that has to change is Barcelona's performance.\n0:30 Comment: If Barcelona play at the standard they played in the first half,\n0:33 Comment: then I'm terribly sorry for Espanyol, but I just can't see any way of them getting back in this,\n0:38 Comment: because Barcelona have been quite simply brilliant.\n0:40 Comment: Exactly, some outstanding movement of the ball.\n0:44 Comment: Casillas comes out and makes a long clearance,\n0:47 Comment: not a bad clearance actually, but straight through to Claudio Bravo, his opposite number for Barcelona.\n0:54 Comment: We'll just have to see what Espanyol do in the second half,\n0:57 Comment: they've got players such as Cristian Stoani who can certainly come around and put a bit of pressure on up front,\n1:1 Comment: but whether or not Sergio Gonzalez would be willing to sacrifice a midfielder is a moot point as for Barcelona.\n1:9 Comment: Well, they've got options on the bench such as Rakitic, Xabi Hernandez to maybe take a little bit of the sting out of the game,\n1:15 Comment: Pedro Rodriguez, Mateu.\n1:19 Comment: Some strength in depth they do indeed have.\n1:22 Comment: Luis Suarez controls, gives it to Neymar.\n1:29 Comment: And Leo Messi makes the interception.\n1:34 Comment: We've seen Messi dropping quite deep today at times, haven't we?\n1:38 Comment: It's been a real... just to give an extra man in the midfield there for Barcelona.\n1:42 Comment: I think that's where Messi has the biggest effect on games.\n1:47 Comment: Sergio Gonza...\n1:49 Comment: Garcia, sorry, to count.\n1:51 Comment: To Caicedo.\n1:52 Comment: It's his attempted cross against Macerano.\n1:54 Comment: And it is a corner though for the home side.\n1:56 Comment: Not really had his chance to shine Sergio today.\n1:59 Comment: Former Barcelona beating player Espanyol's, definitely his main man.\n2:4 Comment: But corners might just be an option for the home side.\n2:8 Comment: Probably the best option given what we've seen in the first half.\n2:13 Comment: I found it very difficult to generate any sort of goal scoring chance.\n2:17 Comment: And then on the corner it's a little bit more of a level playing field.\n2:20 Comment: Victor Alvarez with the corner.\n2:23 Comment: It was well defended by Pique.\n2:25 Comment: It's going backwards.\n2:27 Comment: And that's out for another corner.\n2:30 Comment: It's better from Espanyol.\n2:32 Comment: Good delivery there from Victor Alvarez.\n2:36 Comment: He moves across to this side to take it as well.\n2:39 Comment: Espanyol fans are finding their voice.\n2:50 Comment: They're pushing and shoving there between Alves and Sergio.\n2:55 Comment: Duarte gives it back to Victor Alvarez.\n2:58 Comment: Decent corner, not a decent cross.\n3:0 Comment: It's nodded in and Caicedo!\n3:4 Comment: I think it would have been a goal.\n3:6 Comment: It's nodded in and Caicedo!\n3:8 Comment: I think it would have been ruled out anyhow.\n3:11 Comment: But it just went over the bar.\n3:13 Comment: Caicedo's just saying, no it's not offside.\n3:16 Comment: Which really doesn't make any difference.\n3:18 Comment: He is offside, in fact.\n3:20 Comment: Slightly, you can see his back heel.\n3:23 Comment: It makes no difference what he's saying to the fans when he's missed the chance anyways.\n3:27 Comment: I always wonder about that.\n3:28 Comment: Why do people complain so much when they've missed?\n3:32 Comment: I don't know.\n3:36 Comment: Nice little interchange.\n3:38 Comment: And there, that's one for Dani Alves to chase.\n3:41 Comment: He's not going to chase it effectively enough though.\n3:43 Comment: It's cut out well by Alvaro.\n3:45 Comment: Casilla...\n3:47 Comment: No, does keep it in.\n3:49 Comment: Loses out to Iniesta.\n3:50 Comment: Hand Leo Messi twists and turns and gives it back to the number 8.\n3:58 Comment: So Barcelona 75% of possession in the first half.\n4:3 Comment: They look as if they're going to try and repeat that.\n4:6 Comment: Duarte.\n4:11 Comment: It's cleared long.\n4:12 Comment: Caicedo wins the header.\n4:17 Comment: And...\n4:22 Comment: Piedra's offside by the looks of things.\n4:24 Comment: Just come back from an offside position there.\n4:27 Comment: Goes out to Jordi Alba.\n4:33 Comment: Neymar at pace.\n4:37 Comment: Of course, it's a crude challenge.\n4:38 Comment: Referees wave play on.\n4:39 Comment: It was certainly, whatever it was, it was outside the penalty area.\n4:42 Comment: Watched Curless though from Abraham losing out to Leo Messi.\n4:50 Comment: And here is Messi again.\n4:52 Comment: Gets his pocket picked up by the number 9.\n4:54 Comment: And here is Messi again.\n4:56 Comment: Gets his pocket picked by Cagnes.\n5:0 Comment: A little bit untidy moment in the game.\n5:4 Comment: In the end Busquets wins the ball and here is Neymar who's got Suarez with him.\n5:9 Comment: Oh, that's another great save by Kiko Casilla.\n5:13 Comment: Ball still not clear though.\n5:17 Comment: Neymar.\n5:18 Comment: Cagnes clears.\n5:19 Comment: Caicedo.\n5:25 Comment: Pique and Sergio Garcia tangle.\n5:27 Comment: Espanyol recover the ball and that looks like a foul from Jordi Alba.\n5:34 Comment: Another...\n5:35 Comment: For which he could possibly have been booked.\n5:38 Comment: Perhaps.\n5:39 Comment: Another big save from Kiko Casilla.\n5:42 Comment: That's about 3, 3 or 4 he's made today.\n5:46 Comment: He's made 2 in the first 5 minutes and he's made another good save\n5:49 Comment: when from the Neymar's chance later on in the first half.\n5:53 Comment: That's it, 4 good saves so far.\n5:55 Comment: 4 good saves.\n5:57 Comment: Javier.\n5:59 Comment: Machiarano.\n6:0 Comment: Not the place to mess around with it.\n6:3 Comment: Completed the clearance and it's intercepted by Moreno.\n6:7 Comment: Foul Suarez.\n6:13 Comment: It's a cracking...\n6:14 Comment: I guess it was a brilliant save from Kiko Casilla.\n6:16 Comment: I wonder...\n6:18 Comment: I think it came off his face.\n6:20 Comment: We'll have to see the replay.\n6:21 Comment: I think it's his hand isn't it? He sticks up.\n6:23 Comment: I think it's the face.\n6:25 Comment: Let's see, this will bring out any doubts.\n6:29 Comment: Or not.\n6:30 Comment: I still think it's his face but you know, you've got to put your face there to be honest.\n6:35 Comment: You put it on the line.\n6:36 Comment: Exactly.\n6:37 Comment: That little ball maybe just runs a tiny bit away there from Neymar.\n6:41 Comment: He did have the option of crossing it to Suarez.\n6:46 Comment: A bit more feisty this start of the second half.\n6:48 Comment: Espanyol have come out a little bit more with a bit between the teeth.\n6:53 Comment: It is a derby and in the first half you didn't get that sense that it was...\n6:57 Comment: Derbys are normally a lot more than just normal games.\n7:1 Comment: There's a lot of hard tackles and...\n7:3 Comment: That was a hard tackle there from Hichamp.\n7:11 Comment: Messi down.\n7:14 Comment: Duarte the left back.\n7:19 Comment: That's much more derby.\n7:21 Comment: That's a bit more derby-esque.\n7:22 Comment: He has to go with the foot here.\n7:25 Comment: He has to go with his arm and then he has to hack at him.\n7:48 Comment: Andres Iniesta.\n7:49 Comment: Meanwhile, the clock is ticking.\n7:51 Comment: Espanyol are just showing a bit more bite in their football,\n7:54 Comment: which is something to be grateful for, I think, for the game as a spectacle.\n7:58 Comment: Alba.\n8:3 Comment: Andres Iniesta.\n8:7 Comment: It's a bit out wide to Gio the Alba.\n8:10 Comment: Looks for the little return and...\n8:12 Comment: Here is Alba.\n8:14 Comment: Forcing a corner.\n8:19 Comment: And getting a booking because it wasn't a corner\n8:21 Comment: and he disagreed with the referee by the looks of things.\n8:25 Comment: Quite still.\n8:27 Comment: He was very far away for the referee to pick up on anything...\n8:32 Comment: Tavoli could have said.\n8:36 Comment: I think it's a correct call.\n8:37 Comment: It's a correct goal.\n8:38 Comment: He kicked the ball away.\n8:41 Comment: That's enough to get a booking.\n8:43 Comment: He's not got another one, has he?\n8:44 Comment: Surely all this complaint can't be just about a booking.\n8:47 Comment: I think he sent him off.\n8:49 Comment: Let's have a look.\n8:51 Comment: Now we're hearing the tondo tondo chants from the crowd.\n9:3 Comment: Has he another little goal?\n9:7 Comment: Sinema Daru.\n9:9 Comment: He doesn't look like he does too much.\n9:11 Comment: After he gets the booking.\n9:12 Comment: Considering that Matt Della is the referee who is sort of known for...\n9:18 Comment: Letting things go a little bit.\n9:20 Comment: That does seem to be like...\n9:21 Comment: That's a very sensitive decision from the referee.\n9:26 Comment: It's all part of the same action though, isn't it?\n9:28 Comment: He's shown dissent for...\n9:30 Comment: I think...\n9:31 Comment: I don't know how you could say it because it's basically dissent for the first...\n9:33 Comment: For the kicking the ball away and then the swearing.\n9:35 Comment: I suppose he must have said something.\n9:37 Comment: But it looks as if two yellows are a direct red in...\n9:41 Comment: I think that looks like a direct red.\n9:43 Comment: It's a yellow and then a direct red.\n9:45 Comment: And then a direct red afterwards.\n9:46 Comment: I think it's a bit excessive.\n9:49 Comment: But then again, also looking at it from the point of view of Jordi Albert.\n9:53 Comment: To complain that much about a corner kick.\n9:56 Comment: But it's probably a correct decision.\n9:58 Comment: It's not going to change the game anyways if you get the corner.\n10:0 Comment: I mean, if it's a penalty, I can understand why you might want to do that.\n10:3 Comment: But it's not going to change the game anyway.\n10:5 Comment: If it's a penalty, I can understand why you might want to go a little bit more crazy about it.\n10:8 Comment: It's just a corner.\n10:10 Comment: It's certainly a chance for Espanyol.\n10:12 Comment: It just opens a little chink of hope for the home side.\n10:15 Comment: I just wonder what Luis Enrique will do now.\n10:17 Comment: Will he...\n10:20 Comment: Think about bringing in Adriano or Jeremy Mateu?\n10:24 Comment: We'll soon find out.\n10:26 Comment: At the moment it looks as if...\n10:28 Comment: Busquets has just dropped into the hole.\n10:30 Comment: Into central defence.\n10:31 Comment: And Macerano's going to cover at left back.\n10:33 Comment: I can't imagine he's going to stick with that for long.\n10:37 Comment: Ah, that Suarez save might be...\n10:40 Comment: That Casillas save from Neymar might be really decisive now.\n10:47 Comment: I still think it's a little bit excessive though from Mateu.\n10:50 Comment: Offside against Luis Suarez.\n10:53 Comment: Well, we'll see after the game what he writes down in the act.\n10:59 Comment: It's not the first time he's been a bit lippy, Jordi Albert.\n11:2 Comment: Yes, he had an unpleasant incident with a journalist after the World Cup, didn't he?\n11:7 Comment: Oh, here's Leo Messi.\n11:9 Comment: Leo Messi, can he finish?\n11:10 Comment: Would work!\n11:13 Comment: That corner!\n11:16 Comment: I think that's perhaps why Casillas was left standing.\n11:20 Comment: I think Messi's shot might have just come off, canoned off the defender slightly.\n11:23 Comment: Lovely little backheel.\n11:24 Comment: Lovely little touch.\n11:26 Comment: Just does enough, doesn't he?\n11:28 Comment: Moreno gets across.\n11:30 Comment: He's aiming for the far post.\n11:34 Comment: That's a good response though from Barcelona after going down to 10 men.\n11:38 Comment: And a brilliant link-up again between those front three players.\n11:41 Comment: Whenever they link up, no defence in the world can live up to that.\n11:45 Comment: Go back to the Albert thing.\n11:47 Comment: He may be a bit excessive, but he's only got himself to blame.\n11:50 Comment: Yes, and as I mentioned before, for a corner kick, it's not something really worth going that far about.\n11:59 Comment: There's Leo Messi just trying to worm through a gap that wasn't there.\n12:3 Comment: But certainly, if anything, brought more life to the fans here in Cornellia.\n12:6 Comment: It's Messi!\n12:8 Comment: And Duarte hacks the ball clear.\n12:13 Comment: And just to finish off the Albert thing, as you said, vitally important.\n12:17 Comment: Everything about a decision which was right.\n12:21 Comment: So he wasn't even...\n12:22 Comment: He didn't have motive to show that disagreement with the referee.\n12:29 Comment: Well, he missed a little midweek rest against Getafe.\n12:36 Comment: Maybe more than that.\n12:37 Comment: If it's foul and insulting language, he could easily get a couple of games.\n12:47 Comment: Oof.\n12:49 Comment: That's a free kick.\n12:50 Comment: And a booking.\n12:51 Comment: There's no question about that.\n12:54 Comment: Challenge from Alvaro Busquets.\n12:56 Comment: Busquets wants a couple of explanations from the central defender.\n13:2 Comment: It's quite strange though.\n13:3 Comment: There was Martel Lovre brandish the yellow card, but he seemed to be aiming at Dani Alves.\n13:9 Comment: I'm sure it wasn't.\n13:10 Comment: No, no, it's for this.\n13:11 Comment: It's got to be for this.\n13:12 Comment: Oof.\n13:16 Comment: Alvaro Busquets is full-deam rolling.\n13:22 Comment: Messi.\n13:24 Comment: What's with that focusing?\n13:26 Comment: Unbelievable.\n13:28 Comment: It looked like he was pointing towards Alves.\n13:32 Comment: Messi's blocking.\n13:33 Comment: Has he booked Alvaro as well?\n13:35 Comment: He must have booked Alvaro for that challenge.\n13:38 Comment: I don't understand.\n13:39 Comment: Alves came sprinting over.\n13:41 Comment: Obviously to us, I imagine, for a booking because it was a nasty challenge.\n13:46 Comment: And he's quickly taken...\n13:49 Comment: Obviously, the players have got to look at this and say,\n13:51 Comment: you can't say a thing today.\n13:55 Comment: He's not letting them have any sort of conversation with him.\n14:2 Comment: And it looks like Alvaro's escaped the booking.\n14:8 Comment: Maybe if Alves oversteps the line, the booking's justified.\n14:11 Comment: But once again, I don't see how you can not book Alvaro for absolutely steamrolling.\n14:18 Comment: Messi.\n14:19 Comment: Salva Sevilla's going to come on for Espanyol in a moment or two.\n14:28 Comment: They'll be sharpening the knives in the editorial office of Diario Sport,\n14:31 Comment: I think, as we speak.\n14:37 Comment: Diario Sport is a Barcelona paper dedicated to, as you may guess,\n14:41 Comment: to sport, and mainly Barca, to be honest.\n14:46 Comment: Rafinha made a bit of a theatrical dive there.\n14:50 Comment: Got to be careful here, the referee.\n14:52 Comment: He's just getting a little bit...\n14:55 Comment: Got out of control.\n14:56 Comment: Getting a little bit more heated, a little bit more niggly.\n15:1 Comment: I think he's also incensed the players a little bit with those bookings.\n15:4 Comment: He's handed out for talking.\n15:11 Comment: I just think that as Abrahamos come off for Salva Sevilla,\n15:14 Comment: he's likely to put in a bit more pace.\n15:20 Comment: I think you've just got to have what you're saying in Spain,\n15:22 Comment: a little bit of a longer arm sometimes, and just...\n15:25 Comment: Just know that if you book somebody,\n15:27 Comment: just give them a second or two to calm down, and not just...\n15:32 Comment: It's all part of the same action, the same disapproval for a decision.\n15:37 Comment: You can't just expect him to cool down in one second.\n15:40 Comment: Especially not Scrappy Do.\n15:43 Comment: Jordi Alba.\n15:47 Comment: And yeah, Barca, while this is going on, are still keeping Espanyol pinned back.\n15:52 Comment: Once again, just getting a bit untidy.\n15:53 Comment: This is one of those situations where you should probably be...\n15:58 Comment: Just stopping things before there's a spare boot that goes flying in.\n16:1 Comment: Well, we asked for a derby after the first half,\n16:4 Comment: and we're certainly getting it on the second half.\n16:6 Comment: And a capital letter with a D as well.\n16:13 Comment: There's Leo Messi.\n16:20 Comment: Alves.\n16:23 Comment: Getting involved in Espanyol, have a little bit of space behind them.\n16:26 Comment: Here's Lucas Vázquez. Great work from Macerano.\n16:29 Comment: Iniesta just carries it past Salva Sevilla.\n16:34 Comment: And there's Neymar, getting pulled back.\n16:38 Comment: And that's going to be a bookie, it's got to be.\n16:40 Comment: From RBJS shirt-pulling.\n16:43 Comment: If you're not playing the ball,\n16:45 Comment: especially the way this game is turning at the moment,\n16:50 Comment: there's no way you're going to escape without a yellow card.\n16:55 Comment: It's also interesting that Luiz Henrique still hasn't made a substitution\n17:0 Comment: regarding that Jordi Alba sending off a dismissal.\n17:4 Comment: Does he take a striker off, or does he want to risk losing a midfielder?\n17:8 Comment: Let's see, 13 fouls committed by Espanyol, 7 from Barcelona.\n17:14 Comment: I think the way Amluk makes it, it's two bookies for Espanyol.\n17:17 Comment: Hang on a second, here is the chance for Barca to kill it!\n17:20 Comment: Oh!\n17:23 Comment: Neymar! Once again, great work from Luis Suárez.\n17:28 Comment: Neymar should have just allowed them to relax a little bit more.\n17:33 Comment: Great work from Iniesta, lovely movement from Suárez.\n17:38 Comment: I can't understand though, Hector Moreno is looking at Luis Suárez,\n17:43 Comment: so he knows where the offside line is, and he doesn't step out before the pass.\n17:47 Comment: He allows him to be onside.\n17:49 Comment: To be honest, that's a very easy chance by Barcelona's standards, I think.\n17:54 Comment: Very easy.\n17:56 Comment: They should have made it 3-0.\n17:58 Comment: And Suárez could be more selfish as well, taking it on himself.\n18:1 Comment: Selfless?\n18:2 Comment: Selfless.\n18:4 Comment: Even in the corner for Espanyol.\n18:8 Comment: A game which has heated up several degrees after Jordi Alba's sending off.\n18:16 Comment: That was just ten minutes ago.\n18:21 Comment: Once again it will be Victor Alba with the corner.\n18:25 Comment: Only half cleared.\n18:28 Comment: And that's over the bar.\n18:33 Comment: For Lucas.\n18:36 Comment: Barcelona making the substitution now, it's going to be Mattel coming on.\n18:42 Comment: I think you see which way...\n18:47 Comment: ...Rafinha coming off.\n18:49 Comment: That's Rafinha coming off.\n18:56 Comment: Quite a logical substitution, Jeremy Mattel can play left-back, he can play in the middle.\n19:0 Comment: He can also push forward reasonably well, so...\n19:4 Comment: And Prosokos is digging the air, so if Espanyol do look to more route one,\n19:8 Comment: as the game progresses, he will be able to give them more power from set-pieces.\n19:13 Comment: To defend and to attack, of course.\n19:16 Comment: Scored two vital goals with his head.\n19:20 Comment: In the last month, Jeremy Mattel, the opening goal against Real Madrid.\n19:25 Comment: And the only goal of the game in Vigo, which gave Barcelona a vital 1-0 win.\n19:32 Comment: All this does do though is leave Iniesta and Busquets on their own in the middle,\n19:36 Comment: though it looks like Messi will drop down.\n19:38 Comment: Messi will drop back a bit deeper though, and I wonder how long it will be before\n19:41 Comment: we see someone like Xabi Orakiti coming.\n19:43 Comment: And it's a goal for Real Madrid, and it's a goal for Real Madrid.\n19:46 Comment: And it's a goal for Real Madrid.\n21:5 Comment: Messi.\n21:9 Comment: What is it?\n21:10 Comment: That's Duarte, isn't it, who's gone in for a nap?\n21:17 Comment: I don't know what the complaint can be here from Duarte.\n21:21 Comment: Only one player has made contact with the ball.\n21:24 Comment: And the other one's gone right through him.\n21:28 Comment: I'm getting the standards from Mateo Lata.\n21:29 Comment: A bit strange here.\n21:31 Comment: I don't really know what is...\n21:33 Comment: It's not booked.\n21:34 Comment: ...worthy of a booking. What is it?\n21:35 Comment: It's not booked to Messi again.\n21:36 Comment: Once again, so about two...\n21:39 Comment: And their leg's quite high.\n21:41 Comment: No chance of getting the ball.\n21:43 Comment: How can that not...\n21:44 Comment: That's a terrible chance.\n21:45 Comment: Sorry, I really...\n21:47 Comment: There are times when Mateo Lata, as we said,\n21:49 Comment: has a reputation for letting some physical stuff going.\n21:52 Comment: But he's basically left Barcelona with ten players\n21:55 Comment: and booked Alves for something that Alves said\n21:58 Comment: and something that Alba said.\n21:59 Comment: Well, there's two or three Espanyol players,\n22:1 Comment: I'm going to say Alvaro and there Duarte,\n22:3 Comment: have not been booked after basically very rustic challenges.\n22:11 Comment: I'm not saying that Alba shouldn't have been booked\n22:13 Comment: and that Alves shouldn't have been booked,\n22:14 Comment: but you've got to sort of draw the line as well somewhere\n22:18 Comment: when it comes to physical challenges like that.\n22:22 Comment: And also, the booking from Alves comes from the frustration\n22:26 Comment: of seeing that a challenge like that is not being punished.\n22:29 Comment: Anyhow, we'll see if Barca can make something from the free kick.\n22:33 Comment: Neymar and Messi standing over it.\n22:36 Comment: Messi hits it straight into the wall.\n22:38 Comment: It might have been a better place for Neymar to take.\n22:42 Comment: That one just escapes him.\n22:43 Comment: Anyhow, the clock is ticking down.\n22:44 Comment: 67 minutes gone.\n22:46 Comment: Barcelona lead 2-0.\n22:47 Comment: But the game has a slightly different complexion\n22:50 Comment: to the first half.\n22:51 Comment: Barcelona down to ten men.\n22:52 Comment: Jordi Alba sent off something he said to the referee.\n22:57 Comment: So Barcelona playing with a man less.\n22:59 Comment: And just looking down there, we've got Stoani going to come on as well.\n23:2 Comment: Powerful, aggressive Uruguayan striker.\n23:10 Comment: Stoani doesn't go for that.\n23:11 Comment: He knows.\n23:12 Comment: He just drifted offside.\n23:27 Comment: Salva Sevilla.\n23:34 Comment: Nice turn from Sergio Garcia.\n23:36 Comment: Pique's clearance bounces back off the Espanyol striker.\n23:40 Comment: The bounce is kind for him, but he's shot.\n23:44 Comment: After being reasonably well shepherded by Macherano,\n23:48 Comment: ends up in the arms of Claudio Bravo.\n23:52 Comment: Not offside, as you can see.\n23:54 Comment: Brilliant persistence from Sergio Garcia.\n23:56 Comment: Ball got away from him, got his foot into the channel,\n23:59 Comment: bundled up, away at it.\n24:1 Comment: Macherano got the shot away.\n24:5 Comment: First shot on target, in fact.\n24:7 Comment: 70 minutes in.\n24:13 Comment: Iniesta.\n24:19 Comment: Gets his shirt pulled.\n24:27 Comment: Shirt pulling is a booking, isn't it?\n24:29 Comment: Especially if it's played in an attempt to stop an attack.\n24:34 Comment: You just don't know, with Mateu, what is a booking.\n24:38 Comment: Ceyda goes off Stoani.\n24:44 Comment: The thing is, that's not just the way you read a challenge.\n24:51 Comment: It's shirt pulling.\n24:52 Comment: It's there in the rules.\n24:53 Comment: If you're not playing the ball, you're pulling someone's shirt.\n24:55 Comment: It's a booking.\n24:57 Comment: At least in that post.\n25:4 Comment: Suarez!\n25:5 Comment: Great last-ditch challenge from Moreno.\n25:11 Comment: Still Suarez on the ball.\n25:15 Comment: Busquets to Iniesta.\n25:17 Comment: Leo Messi.\n25:18 Comment: Suarez.\n25:23 Comment: Goes well there, Mateu.\n25:24 Comment: Throw in, says the referee.\n25:34 Comment: It's a great challenge from Moreno.\n25:35 Comment: Might be a hint that Suarez just used his body as well to edge Javi out of the way.\n25:40 Comment: I've seen them give him.\n25:46 Comment: Macherano.\n25:49 Comment: Pique.\n25:55 Comment: They're just making life a little bit over-complicated for themselves, Barcelona here.\n26:1 Comment: Good weather from Alves.\n26:7 Comment: Looking for the overlap.\n26:11 Comment: Another big challenge from Hector Moreno.\n26:14 Comment: A bit of frustration there from Suarez.\n26:19 Comment: Arriba!\n26:22 Comment: And there's balance from Busquets, who looks up, tries to find Neymar.\n26:26 Comment: Just nipped away from him by Arriba.\n26:31 Comment: What's the answer to that?\n26:32 Comment: Neymar's actually done a decent job getting back to cover, hasn't he, in this game?\n26:35 Comment: Something he's worked on, definitely.\n26:39 Comment: Yeah, well, he was probably out of the three the least hard-working defender.\n26:44 Comment: Come Espanol again, it's Lucas Vázquez, who...\n26:48 Comment: That looks like obstruction there from Macherano, it's what the referee's given him.\n26:55 Comment: Oh, no, he's got the dive.\n26:58 Comment: It's the guessing game with Mr. Mateo, that one.\n27:5 Comment: He does look like he's eager to go to ground.\n27:9 Comment: It's a bit of a meal of it, I think it would be fair to say.\n27:11 Comment: I did also think that Macherano made a bit of a gesture to close him off, so...\n27:19 Comment: It's the Wheel of Fortune show, with Mr. Mateo Loos.\n27:23 Comment: Only oppy.\n27:25 Comment: Duarte.\n27:35 Comment: Espanyol looking to get a goal that would really put the cat among the pigeons.\n27:39 Comment: Salva.\n27:41 Comment: Victor Alvarez.\n27:42 Comment: A bit of space for Duarte, who's pushed forward with the left back.\n27:45 Comment: That's a good one.\n27:46 Comment: Just a little bit of an over-hit looking for Stoani.\n27:50 Comment: And Mateo.\n27:53 Comment: Neymar skips past his marker with consummate ease.\n27:57 Comment: Just well worked there by Lucas.\n28:0 Comment: Just forcing Barcelona to check.\n28:5 Comment: Macherano will give this to Piqué.\n28:10 Comment: Dani Alves.\n28:12 Comment: A challenging play there from the full-back.\n28:25 Comment: Another substitution for Espanyol.\n28:28 Comment: This will be the third and final throw of the dice on Sergio.\n28:33 Comment: González, and it's Victor Alvarez who comes off.\n28:37 Comment: Third place by Montañez.\n28:40 Comment: Pico Montañez.\n28:58 Comment: I'm going to give a bit more width to the Espanyol attack.\n29:2 Comment: Here he is.\n29:4 Comment: Salva Sevilla.\n29:9 Comment: Didn't have anywhere to go there.\n29:11 Comment: Alves, and that is definitely Espanyol's best chance.\n29:14 Comment: Goes.\n29:17 Comment: He's had a corner.\n29:19 Comment: Goal kick.\n29:21 Comment: Well, these complaints here for this is not going their way.\n29:26 Comment: It's a bit of a shame.\n29:27 Comment: Goal kick.\n29:29 Comment: Well, these complaints here for this is not going their way.\n29:34 Comment: They look about as vociferous as Jordi Alves' complaints.\n29:37 Comment: I think Jordi Alves was probably a bit more vociferous.\n29:39 Comment: Maybe the words employed by Jordi Alves were what got him sent off.\n29:43 Comment: Stoani just over.\n29:46 Comment: That chance there, Barcelona have done it a couple of times today.\n29:49 Comment: Sometimes you've just got to hoof the ball out from defence.\n29:52 Comment: Couldn't quite get an angle to clear it, could he?\n29:54 Comment: It was clear it could be that was the problem.\n29:55 Comment: Maybe Alves couldn't have a chance to do it.\n29:57 Comment: But they've never looked like they want to just clear the ball.\n30:0 Comment: They want to pass it out.\n30:1 Comment: Sometimes, I know it's not the Barca way, but why did that happen?\n30:6 Comment: Kick it out sometimes.\n30:8 Comment: Another free kick.\n30:14 Comment: Luis Suarez has an opinion there, but he keeps it, I think, under his breath probably.\n30:19 Comment: Cañas.\n30:20 Comment: To Salva Sevilla.\n30:21 Comment: Sergio Garcia being pressured by Macherano.\n30:26 Comment: Concedes a throw in.\n30:27 Comment: When's the last 15 here in Cornellà, in the Power 8 stadium?\n30:38 Comment: Busquets makes a good challenge once again.\n30:39 Comment: The referee plays on.\n30:44 Comment: I think there's probably other referees who might well have given a free kick for that.\n30:48 Comment: Carlos from Barcelona.\n30:50 Comment: Alves.\n30:51 Comment: One of his better games in a long time.\n30:54 Comment: One of his best games in a long while, I find.\n30:56 Comment: Reckoning.\n30:57 Comment: Suarez makes life difficult for Moreno.\n31:0 Comment: He gets brought down.\n31:4 Comment: Good hustling, good bustling from Luis Suarez.\n31:8 Comment: Again, it's a case for a yellow card perhaps.\n31:21 Comment: That challenge was...\n31:22 Comment: Look at the self on Busquets again, actually.\n31:25 Comment: Looks like he just flicked the ball away.\n31:27 Comment: Old studs, maybe.\n31:39 Comment: Pique tips that one wide.\n31:41 Comment: Wide to Neymar, who loses out to Arrilla.\n31:44 Comment: But Kjell is still from Lucas.\n31:46 Comment: It's with Neymar again.\n31:47 Comment: Still Neymar.\n31:49 Comment: Lines up the shot, got a push.\n31:50 Comment: Still Neymar!\n31:52 Comment: Oh, brilliant save once again as Messi...\n31:58 Comment: ...has that shot blocked.\n32:0 Comment: When it looked as if it was going to be 3-0.\n32:2 Comment: And now it's Moreno's down.\n32:5 Comment: What about that for acceleration from Neymar?\n32:8 Comment: Unbelievable.\n32:9 Comment: And then the vision.\n32:11 Comment: Incredible.\n32:12 Comment: So actually...\n32:13 Comment: That's why he just clips, accidentally catches Moreno with his studs there.\n32:18 Comment: Right in the face.\n32:22 Comment: The way he just puts it into third gear there.\n32:25 Comment: Incredible.\n32:26 Comment: And that vision, as you say, to spot Messi and pick him out.\n32:30 Comment: Brilliant football.\n32:33 Comment: Was it Rakitic on the touchline for Barcelona?\n32:37 Comment: Might be for...\n32:38 Comment: Might be interesting to see.\n32:43 Comment: Ooh, needed a touch from Bravo.\n32:48 Comment: As Lucas just had the beating of Mattel there for pace.\n32:52 Comment: And you felt that was a penalty waiting to happen.\n32:54 Comment: Mattel was always...\n32:55 Comment: Just that half a yard behind.\n33:2 Comment: It's a decent delivery.\n33:3 Comment: And once again, Bravo gets half a punch on it.\n33:10 Comment: Is he giving the free kick or is it a goal kick he's given there?\n33:13 Comment: I'm pretty sure it's a free kick.\n33:16 Comment: It did look like a blatant barge at Bravo.\n33:19 Comment: Nothing too subtle about it from the Espanyol player.\n33:25 Comment: It's not here.\n33:26 Comment: It's now when he gets up.\n33:28 Comment: Even the first time there, you can see Moreno just trying to clatter into Bravo.\n33:33 Comment: Yes, Moreno.\n33:38 Comment: Pretty clear free kick.\n33:42 Comment: Barcelona making the substitution.\n33:43 Comment: Suárez coming off.\n33:46 Comment: Great performance on Luis Suárez.\n33:49 Comment: He's not going to goal, does he?\n33:50 Comment: No.\n33:51 Comment: He's not going to goal.\n33:56 Comment: He's not going to goal, does he?\n33:57 Comment: Probably won't even have an assist.\n33:58 Comment: Oh, he will have an assist for the second goal.\n34:1 Comment: And he is being replaced by Rakitic.\n34:7 Comment: Well, the stats say one assist, but in reality we can say it's two assists.\n34:13 Comment: I'd say that dummy is a council assist for me.\n34:17 Comment: Another excellent performance from Luis Suárez.\n34:19 Comment: He'll be back in the starting line-up against Getafe, I dare say.\n34:27 Comment: He's done quite well because he is actually just one booking.\n34:30 Comment: Him and Mateo are actually just one booking off suspensions.\n34:34 Comment: Can he stop up there?\n34:38 Comment: That's probably one of the first bookings for an actual challenge in this game.\n34:48 Comment: Speeds of this far I'm way better than Busquets.\n34:56 Comment: The yellow card is four for Espanyol.\n34:58 Comment: They are four for Arbilla, Cañas, Lucas and Sergio García.\n35:3 Comment: Two for Barca.\n35:4 Comment: Presumably it's the first one for Alves and the one for Dani.\n35:8 Comment: And the first one for Alba and Dani Alves'.\n35:12 Comment: So I think Alba must have got a direct red after a yellow card.\n35:17 Comment: It's managing a referee display that I think Mateo Lopez probably isn't going to leave anyone happy.\n35:22 Comment: No, not at all.\n35:25 Comment: Especially Barcelona.\n35:29 Comment: All those little challenges that have gone, or all those harsh challenges that haven't gone punished.\n35:34 Comment: Salva Sevilla.\n35:39 Comment: Moreno.\n35:41 Comment: Montañez.\n35:46 Comment: You hear the caller, without a foul, without a foul.\n35:49 Comment: Then Montañez nearly works his way through.\n35:54 Comment: Cañas is a little bit careless but Alvaro is able to send it long.\n35:57 Comment: A little bit frantic and Sergio García can't keep that one in.\n36:2 Comment: Just getting the while thing for Salva Sevilla,\n36:3 Comment: who's left a great margin because of Diego Correa.\n36:8 Comment: Both left and right for Banner.\n36:9 Comment: Manchester United 50-59\n36:14 Comment: Let's be careful with upper-right cloud here,\n36:16 Comment: a bit worse than the reverse cloud but not really monotonly.\n36:20 Comment: It's a hunt for three and one in that black box,\n36:23 Comment: that far right print where the two forwards were just looking as if they were starving.\n36:29 Comment: They need to foresee this.\n36:31 Comment: So they've seen much more of Espanyol in the second half, they've shown more bite.\n36:36 Comment: Since that red card, they believe in themselves a little bit more, believe in their chances.\n36:41 Comment: And especially, yeah, that bite, those challenges, they've made it much more of a hard game for Barcelona.\n36:47 Comment: A lot more will be taken out of the players from Barcelona after that second half.\n36:52 Comment: And the first half were reasonably comfortable, yeah.\n37:1 Comment: Come on, Lucas! Come on, Lucas!\n37:5 Comment: Come on, Lucas!\n37:8 Comment: Yes, yes, yes!\n37:10 Comment: Yes, Lucas! Yes, Lucas!\n37:12 Comment: Espanyol fan, come on, Lucas! Come on, Lucas!\n37:15 Comment: And Lucas comes in to throw it.\n37:22 Comment: Another thing, also, to be fair, the atmosphere has been quite good today.\n37:25 Comment: You can hear the fans have been chanting and singing.\n37:28 Comment: It's just a point, there's only 30,000 in a 40,000 capacity.\n37:31 Comment: That's a surprising step.\n37:37 Comment: Another booking.\n37:42 Comment: It's time for Busquets.\n37:43 Comment: It's a clear booking, isn't it? It is a clear booking, but we've seen Oda's shirt pulling.\n37:46 Comment: It's precisely before we saw him tugging his shirt.\n37:50 Comment: On Iniesta, and he didn't get the booking.\n37:54 Comment: It's just...\n37:56 Comment: You just don't know what's...\n38:0 Comment: What's going to go on in the next few minutes.\n38:2 Comment: It's just...\n38:12 Comment: What's going to get you in the book?\n38:14 Comment: That should get you in the book under any circumstances.\n38:21 Comment: Pique.\n38:24 Comment: Salva Sevilla.\n38:37 Comment: It's been a sent long, but bravo.\n38:39 Comment: He's only had to make one save, really, hasn't he?\n38:44 Comment: Almost jumped out of his own box there.\n38:46 Comment: The easiest of balls.\n38:49 Comment: But yeah, he only had to make one save.\n38:51 Comment: They haven't really worked him too much.\n38:53 Comment: Whereas Kike Casillas had a lot of work to get through.\n38:57 Comment: And responded very well this afternoon.\n39:7 Comment: It's Mateo.\n39:10 Comment: The reason to be content, Luis Enriquez,\n39:12 Comment: so far 30 minutes with a player less on the pitch.\n39:36 Comment: Bit of space now.\n39:40 Comment: And Messi.\n39:44 Comment: Does very well, once again.\n39:45 Comment: He's going to have a run at Kanye,\n39:46 Comment: see, instead he gives it back to Rakitic.\n39:51 Comment: Dani Alves.\n39:53 Comment: Just dispossessed this time by Montagnès.\n39:55 Comment: He's been lively in the 5-10 minutes since he's come on.\n39:57 Comment: The former Zaragoza player, if I'm not mistaken, yeah.\n40:2 Comment: Barcelona have their last substitute ready to come on\n40:4 Comment: and it's Xavi Hernandez making,\n40:6 Comment: could be his last ever derby appearance.\n40:8 Comment: Who knows?\n40:10 Comment: Of course, you always say that Xavi's his last cup,\n40:12 Comment: his last game against Atletico.\n40:13 Comment: His last game.\n40:14 Comment: If he decides to go to either America or Qatar,\n40:16 Comment: you know, there's still chances that he might sign for another year.\n40:19 Comment: He's got another year in his contract, hasn't he?\n40:21 Comment: Yeah, trying to persuade him to playing it out.\n40:25 Comment: The one thing we're sure of is that once Xavi comes on here,\n40:28 Comment: all these last five minutes,\n40:30 Comment: Espanyol probably can see even less of the ball than they have seen.\n40:34 Comment: I think it's quite wise not having put him on too early, though, Luis Enriquez.\n40:37 Comment: He just doesn't want to lose too much pace on the pitch.\n40:39 Comment: Yeah.\n40:40 Comment: He can control the ball, but just taking Xavi on,\n40:42 Comment: Espanyol are bottom players such as Montagnès, Salva Sevilla,\n40:46 Comment: who are both quick and it might have been,\n40:48 Comment: I want to say, Montagnès looks to go through\n40:50 Comment: and there is a chance for Stoani!\n40:56 Comment: That was an excellent chance, actually.\n40:58 Comment: Everyone seemed to stop for a fraction of a second.\n41:0 Comment: I almost feel Bravo stopped as well.\n41:2 Comment: I'll see here if he could have come out or not.\n41:4 Comment: No, maybe, yeah.\n41:6 Comment: It was better for him to stay behind.\n41:8 Comment: And Stoani could have done much better than he did there.\n41:11 Comment: It was on his left foot, which is his weaker foot,\n41:13 Comment: but he had a lot of time to pick where he wanted to place that shot.\n41:17 Comment: Now, three and a half minutes left of normal time.\n41:40 Comment: Barcelona make their final substitution.\n41:44 Comment: It's straight swap is Iniesta of Xavi Hernández.\n41:50 Comment: Iniesta applauded by the local fans.\n41:54 Comment: Well, he had that gesture with Dani Harker,\n41:56 Comment: he didn't even score the World Cup winning goal,\n41:59 Comment: he lifted his shirt and he said,\n42:0 Comment: Harker, you're always with us.\n42:2 Comment: And I think that's left its mark on the Espanyol fan base,\n42:5 Comment: despite him being quite a bit of rivals.\n42:8 Comment: Well, he's quite popular in his rounds all around Spain.\n42:11 Comment: There's only one place where he gets a bit stick.\n42:13 Comment: Yeah.\n42:17 Comment: Xavi probably deserves, well,\n42:19 Comment: probably deserves massive respect.\n42:22 Comment: It's interesting, the ground where they cheer Xavi,\n42:24 Comment: or applaud Xavi, they boo Iniesta.\n42:26 Comment: And here they applaud Iniesta and boo Xavi.\n42:30 Comment: Not going to say which ground that is, however.\n42:34 Comment: And once again, Espanyol maybe have a case there for obstruction.\n42:36 Comment: Referees played on once again.\n42:38 Comment: The ball lofted in and another good claim from Bravo.\n42:41 Comment: It's not a lot to do.\n42:44 Comment: Sergio Bravo, but everything he's done today\n42:46 Comment: is done very tidily, very effectively.\n42:49 Comment: Says it should have been an obstruction.\n42:53 Comment: Or a foul.\n42:55 Comment: Yeah, well, he's got his legs.\n42:57 Comment: The fact is, if Mascherano's hopping away,\n43:0 Comment: complaining of a contact,\n43:3 Comment: that might just have been a little clue.\n43:6 Comment: That's a foul.\n43:7 Comment: There's another one.\n43:11 Comment: Duarte hasn't taken that one to...\n43:13 Comment: See, once again, it's just a bit of a hack there from Pique, isn't it?\n43:36 Comment: In fact, this is Xavi's 500th league appearance.\n43:43 Comment: So that's no mean feat there from a player who's got a lot of those records.\n43:49 Comment: There's not many.\n43:50 Comment: Just imagine that Barcelona have never lost in this game.\n43:52 Comment: They've never lost in this game.\n44:3 Comment: Just imagine that Barcelona have never lost in this ground since it was opened.\n44:7 Comment: And it's looking as if they're going to have...\n44:11 Comment: Got their way through another one of these...\n44:15 Comment: Tricky games.\n44:16 Comment: And if you'd looked in at the run of the season, you'd have said,\n44:18 Comment: Well, Valencia at home.\n44:20 Comment: Sevilla away.\n44:22 Comment: Espanyol away.\n44:23 Comment: And Atletico Madrid...\n44:26 Comment: Away.\n44:27 Comment: And, well, they're dropped two points away to Sevilla.\n44:28 Comment: They beat Valencia.\n44:30 Comment: Looks like they're going to take all three points from Espanyol.\n44:32 Comment: The only other really nasty game...\n44:36 Comment: On paper, obviously, they're all going to be played on the pitch.\n44:39 Comment: It's Atletico Madrid away in the penultimate match of the season.\n44:44 Comment: Who knows what situation might be then.\n44:47 Comment: That's the thing that could play in their favour there.\n44:50 Comment: So Atletico Madrid might have third place sealed by that game.\n44:55 Comment: Might not be playing for anything.\n44:57 Comment: I'm not going to say they're going to let themselves lose the game.\n45:2 Comment: But Atletico Madrid players are always going to be a bit more up for beating Real Madrid.\n45:6 Comment: And they are going to be up for beating Barcelona.\n45:8 Comment: And more so if it's a decisive game in the title run.\n45:13 Comment: I'm not saying Atletico Madrid are going to throw away that game.\n45:16 Comment: I think any team with Simeone in charge...\n45:20 Comment: Yeah, that's...\n45:22 Comment: That's true.\n45:23 Comment: Is going to give everything.\n45:25 Comment: Whether or not the morale is one thing or another is a moot point.\n45:32 Comment: But, anyhow, let's take it as Simeone is so much.\n45:36 Comment: Let's take it one game at a time.\n45:38 Comment: There's still the question of the Champions League semi-finals against Bayern Munich.\n45:41 Comment: Remember, they've got to play Juve.\n45:42 Comment: Madrid have got to go to Valencia and Sevilla as well.\n45:44 Comment: They've got to go to Sevilla and entertain Valencia.\n45:49 Comment: Got to go to Vigo tomorrow.\n45:50 Comment: And it looks as if they're going to go to Vigo five points behind Barca.\n46:2 Comment: Another booking. Is that for complaining as well?\n46:9 Comment: Moreno.\n46:10 Comment: I think he could have been booked for that rugby tackle earlier on, couldn't he?\n46:14 Comment: And, yeah, I was going to say, I think he did the exact same thing he's done with Jordi Alba.\n46:18 Comment: It looks like he's...\n46:20 Comment: Was Moreno on a booking before this?\n46:22 Comment: I didn't see it given.\n46:23 Comment: I get the sense that he flashed the yellow card twice here again.\n46:27 Comment: We'll see.\n46:28 Comment: One.\n46:30 Comment: And when he walks away, it looks like he...\n46:33 Comment: Again, yeah, there it is.\n46:36 Comment: He's done the exact same thing as he's done with Jordi Alba.\n46:39 Comment: It's not bright from Moreno, is it?\n46:40 Comment: But it's just a bit unnecessary.\n46:44 Comment: Again, it's the same action, getting punished two times.\n46:49 Comment: He'd have been good in the wild west with Mateo Lante.\n46:51 Comment: He was quick on the draw.\n46:53 Comment: The thing is, he's a referee who on occasion has the reputation for letting things go.\n46:57 Comment: And he's let some bad challenges go today.\n    \n\n    #######TASK \n    Provide a factually correct and detailed textual description of the game compiled from the information presented above from different sources, in more than 1000 words.\n            \"Comment.\": represents the real-time noisy commentary from the commentator as the game progresses.\n    Don't mention sources of information like commentators or captions, write as if you saw them live.\n    \n    ",
    "summary": "In a captivating Barcelona derby that saw neighbors Espanyol take on Barcelona, the match unraveled with a blend of skillful brilliance, tactical discipline, and a generous sprinkle of drama across the 90 minutes. It concluded with Barcelona triumphing 2-0 over Espanyol in an encounter that provided plenty of talking points.\n\nThe first half kicked off with Barcelona needing a win to keep a solid grip on their title hopes, knowing that despite being two points ahead of Real Madrid, Real’s superior head-to-head goal difference could become a deciding factor if the teams ended the season level on points. Barcelona dominated from the outset, controlling possession and patiently searching for openings in a compact Espanyol defense.\n\nFrom the early minutes, eyes were on Barcelona’s attacking trio of Messi, Suarez, and Neymar. The first notable chance fell to Neymar, who after some lovely interplay within the Barcelona ranks, saw his cross aiming for Suarez thwarted by Espanyol's goalkeeper Kiko Casilla. Casilla’s brilliant reflexes prevented the visitors from taking an early lead despite almost being caught off guard by a deflection.\n\nAs the match developed, both Jordi Alba and Javier Mascherano became integral in maintaining Barcelona’s defensive stability while also pushing forward to support attacks. Andres Iniesta, having shown a resurgence in form recently, was pivotal in midfield, linking up play seamlessly and driving forward with intensity.\n\nBarcelona’s patient build-up play finally bore fruit in the 17th minute. Messi, operating almost as an auxiliary midfielder, combined with Sergio Busquets in tight spaces before releasing Alba into acres of space. Alba's first-time cross saw Luis Suarez cleverly dummy the ball, allowing it to run through to Neymar, who clinically slotted home to give Barcelona a deserved lead. The brilliance of the goal was in its execution, from Messi's precise pass to Suarez’s intelligent dummy – a fine example of Barcelona’s telepathic understanding and quick, incisive play.\n\nEspanyol, though disciplined in the first half, found themselves increasingly pressured. They struggled to maintain possession against Barcelona’s relentless press, with the statistics laying bare this disparity – Espanyol completed just 26 passes in the first 15 minutes against Barcelona’s 194. Even when Felipe Caicedo did manage to get involved, usually it was against the disciplined tandem of Mascherano and Gerard Pique that he'd often find himself stymied. \n\nThe second Barcelona goal also showcased the team's impressive fluidity in midfield. Iniesta found Messi, who then launched a sequence of passes ending with Iniesta again, who provided a deft pass for Messi to control and score, making it 2-0 in the 25th minute. There was a slight controversy as some suggested Suarez might have been offside during the build-up, but the replays gave enough room for doubt meant the goal stood, further enhancing Barcelona's control over the match.\n\nDespite being two goals down, Espanyol did have moments they could have built upon. Corners, which few and far between opportunities, were wasted or well defended by Barcelona, with Pique and company maintaining a formidable presence. The swarming Barcelona press meant any attempt by Espanyol to counter was often quelled before reaching Claudio Bravo’s goal.\n\nThe second half introduced a different dynamic, particularly following the sending off of Jordi Alba around the 55th-minute mark. Alba, having initially earned a yellow card for kicking the ball away in disagreement over a corner decision, was swiftly shown a direct red card for dissent. The dismissal introduced a glimmer of hope for Espanyol, who felt that with a one-man advantage, they might claw their way back into the encounter. Alba appeared overly aggrieved for what seemed a minor incident, but such showings against referee decisions are rarely tolerated.\n\nLuis Enrique, recognizing the situation, adjusted by pushing Sergio Busquets into central defense and bringing on Jeremy Mathieu to fortify the back line. Barcelona, reduced to ten men, still managed to carve out scoring opportunities, primarily orchestrated by Messi who nearly added a third but saw his shot cannon off the post. Kiko Casilla, a formidable figure for Espanyol throughout, continued to keep his side within touching distance, pulling off vital saves including a close-range effort from Neymar.\n\nEspanyol, spurred on by the sending off, applied more pressure through the likes of substitute Cristian Stuani and Captain Sergio Garcia. Garcia, determined to lead by example, forced Bravo into his only save of the match after a determined run and shot. While Espanyol looked to capitalize on their numerical advantage, Barcelona’s high defensive line and compact shape left Espanyol frustrated for large parts.\n\nBarca’s final changes included bringing on Xavi Hernandez for what might have been his last Catalan derby appearance, aiding in keeping possession and nullifying Espanyol's advances. Xavi's introduction symbolized calm and control, adding further stability in the closing stages.\n\nDespite a book-full collection of minutes, yellow cards dominated proceedings with both sides showing physicality reciprocally. Espanyol's eagerness boiled over into reckless challenges, yet Barcelona's players, especially Neymar, consistently showed skill in retaining possession and drawing fouls.\n\nEspanyol's best chance to pull one back came in the form of a Stoani opportunity that he spurned, terribly mishitting from a decent position. Bravo collected the loose ball comfortably, signaling the epitome of Espanyol’s frustrations. The home side’s inability to break down a meticulously organized Barcelona was evident, even as they threw more men forward.\n\nAs the final whistle approached, Barcelona’s professional and disciplined display, even with a man down, showcased the depth and tactical nous instilled by Luis Enrique. Messi’s omnipresence, either as playmaker or a threat in the box, underlined why Barcelona leaned heavily on his soccer brilliance.\n\nBarcelona’s 2-0 victory over Espanyol meant they sustained their lead at the top of the table, keeping their title aspirations firmly within their grasp. For Espanyol, the match was a learning curve – whilst they displayed glimpses of fight, the quality gap was evident. The narrative of Barcelona’s season, supported by meaningful rotations and stellar individual performances, continued unblemished. The derby underlined their resilience; seeing off stern challenges would be key in their pursuit of La Liga glory."
