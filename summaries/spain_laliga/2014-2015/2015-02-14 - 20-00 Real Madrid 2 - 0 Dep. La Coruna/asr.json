minutes\n0:37 Comment: or so.\n0:38 Comment: It will be vital, I think, for Depor to maintain the 0-0 as long as they can in this first\n0:44 Comment: half.\n0:45 Comment: Easier said than done, though, because Real Madrid are really going to be pushing for\n0:49 Comment: goals early on.\n0:50 Comment: Because the longer they go without scoring, the more the Bernabeu could potentially get\n0:54 Comment: on their backs.\n0:55 Comment: Indeed.\n0:56 Comment: Bale then, combining with Benzema.\n0:58 Comment: The overlap is there for Marboloa.\n0:59 Comment: Bale on the ball.\n1:0 Comment: Has support.\n1:1 Comment: The ball inside now for Kroos.\n1:2 Comment: Big match as well for Ilaura.\n1:3 Comment: Ilaura has to really force his way into this midfield.\n1:12 Comment: And with players like Cadeira and Modric out, it's his opportunity to make a good impression.\n1:19 Comment: Bale.\n1:20 Comment: Gareth Bale plays it in and it'll be a first corner for Real Madrid.\n1:24 Comment: Initial pressure from the home team, pretty much as we expected.\n1:28 Comment: Gareth Bale just couldn't be on for defence.\n1:30 Comment: We'll see how the centre-backs cope with this.\n1:32 Comment: Marboloa Pablo, 39 years old, this is the very first game he's ever played as a centre-back.\n1:38 Comment: And, yeah, it's a great stadium to make that kind of debut, if you want to call it that.\n1:43 Comment: As the ball swung in, it's just flicked over by Bale, I think it was.\n1:47 Comment: Picked up by Isco.\n1:48 Comment: Isco.\n1:49 Comment: And he may have overrun it.\n1:52 Comment: Did well to keep it in.\n1:54 Comment: And good play from Lauri.\n1:59 Comment: This could be one of the key players for Depo.\n2:2 Comment: The number 19, Ivan Cavallero, one of several Portuguese players in the Depo squad.\n2:8 Comment: Lauri, now.\n2:9 Comment: Cavallero, he's one of those players, he's part of an investment fund from Jorge Mendes.\n2:15 Comment: And part of a trio of players who are out on loan at various clubs, just to get some experience.\n2:23 Comment: Was playing for Benfica last season.\n2:26 Comment: Joao Cancelo at Valencia is another player in that pizza-limb investment fund.\n2:31 Comment: And really, they're trying to put him in the shop window, but it's very difficult when you're part of a relegation-struggling team.\n2:37 Comment: Is that the same Jorge Mendes who's got players in Valencia, players in Madrid?\n2:41 Comment: It's that lad, he gives just his little toy, isn't it?\n2:44 Comment: His close personal friend of Cristiano Ronaldo, as well.\n2:47 Comment: And Nuno Espírito Santo, of course, his very first client.\n2:51 Comment: When he was playing for Deportivo La Coruña, as goalkeeper, Jorge Mendes signed him.\n2:56 Comment: His very first client.\n2:57 Comment: Now manager of one of Real Madrid's rivals.\n3:0 Comment: He gets everywhere.\n3:1 Comment: Back to the action then.\n3:2 Comment: Real Madrid maintaining possession.\n3:4 Comment: Here, Lauri, just pushing it back.\n3:6 Comment: Another outing for the youngsters, Nacho and Varane at the back.\n3:10 Comment: Didn't have a good game last weekend, standing in for Pepe and Ramos.\n3:16 Comment: Just shows how key Pepe and Ramos are to the side.\n3:19 Comment: You can replace one of them, you can bring in Varane, you can bring in Nacho,\n3:22 Comment: and they can do a job.\n3:23 Comment: Very difficult replacing two centre-backs in the middle of a season.\n3:26 Comment: As you said, they didn't have a good game last week.\n3:28 Comment: These centre-half pairings here, Varane and Nacho.\n3:31 Comment: But Varane is very highly thought of.\n3:34 Comment: And every transfer window, there are rumours about him.\n3:37 Comment: There's Victor Fernandez back in Spain, managing Deportivo La Coruña.\n3:40 Comment: His first season with Deportivo La Coruña.\n3:42 Comment: Of course, former manager of their deadly rivals, Celta.\n3:46 Comment: But Varane, for me, is one of the most elegant centre-halves in many a year.\n3:52 Comment: He tends to get the ball and just the ball.\n3:55 Comment: So many centre-halves, they go in and you get the feeling\n3:58 Comment: that they're going to make contact with something.\n4:0 Comment: The ball, the player, whatever.\n4:2 Comment: But Varane, a very elegant, very classy midfielder.\n4:8 Comment: Top-class centre-back, Rafael Varane.\n4:10 Comment: But the only question really around him is his relative lack of fitness.\n4:15 Comment: Very rarely plays two games in a row.\n4:17 Comment: It's one of the first occasions where we've seen him put together a run of two games.\n4:21 Comment: Real Madrid, indeed, have had a series of muscular, mainly muscular problems,\n4:27 Comment: injury problems this season.\n4:28 Comment: Questions are being asked.\n4:30 Comment: Back to the action.\n4:31 Comment: Deportivo have got their first corner of the game.\n4:35 Comment: I thought it had come off...\n4:36 Comment: No, it was just a very poor shot, wasn't it?\n4:38 Comment: I think you've been very charitable to Aureol Riera.\n4:40 Comment: I was, indeed. Aureol Riera, of course, ex-Barca B-boy, on loan from Wigan.\n4:47 Comment: Did a very good job last season with Osasuna Aureol Riera.\n4:53 Comment: Didn't really work out for him at Wigan.\n4:55 Comment: Leo Messi's former roommate at La Masia.\n4:59 Comment: Cuenca, another ex-Barca boy.\n5:2 Comment: Wigan to take on Alba Loa.\n5:4 Comment: Alba Loa does the little pass inside.\n5:6 Comment: It was a very well-worked run and...\n5:9 Comment: The best opportunity of the game.\n5:11 Comment: Five minutes gone and it's Isaac Cuenca.\n5:16 Comment: Cavalero now plays the ball in and it's pushed away by Ilara.\n5:20 Comment: Two very good moves there by the blue and whites.\n5:23 Comment: Looks like Cuenca was just trying to use the element of surprise there.\n5:26 Comment: Everybody expecting him to cut it back decides,\n5:28 Comment: maybe he'll try and test Garcia at the near post.\n5:31 Comment: Very nearly worked out for him.\n5:33 Comment: I'm not sure if Garcia saves this or just hits him in the head, more or less.\n5:38 Comment: But it still goes down as a save and it will now indeed be a first corner of the game\n5:42 Comment: to be taken by Cavalero.\n5:49 Comment: Boca Juniors couldn't control it but the ball still in Depo's position.\n5:53 Comment: Possession, Luzinho's ball in.\n5:56 Comment: It's Luzinho again.\n5:57 Comment: Oh! And over the crossbar.\n5:59 Comment: Well, it's early troubling times for Real Madrid.\n6:4 Comment: It's Cuenca again, this time from distance.\n6:9 Comment: You were saying earlier, Duncan Cuenca's not exactly impressed the Depo fans so far\n6:14 Comment: but he's started out well today, hasn't he?\n6:17 Comment: He has started out strongly.\n6:18 Comment: The criticism really of Isaac Cuenca is that they know he's talented.\n6:22 Comment: Pep Guardiola brought him in to FC Barcelona's first team,\n6:26 Comment: played him in a Clasico even.\n6:29 Comment: He just hasn't really performed as expected for Deportivo Lacroni\n6:33 Comment: but you can tell he has for class when you see him on the ball.\n6:35 Comment: Just on that point, there is a level of expectation around all of Expo's boys\n6:41 Comment: and that can be positive and as you say, sometimes negative\n6:45 Comment: because the expectation level is much higher than it would be for players\n6:49 Comment: who come from other clubs.\n6:51 Comment: Let's get back to the action.\n6:52 Comment: Laura now in possession, looking for a free kick that doesn't come.\n6:56 Comment: He really should have been looking more towards the linesman who's on the spot there.\n7:0 Comment: Contact with the ball, I think from Isco and the ball eventually goes out\n7:4 Comment: for a goal kick in favour of Florentino Perez.\n7:7 Comment: Metal alongside him, ex-Prime Minister Jose Afnan.\n7:15 Comment: Of course, certain sections of the sports press love to see him next to the ex-president.\n7:20 Comment: It fuels all kinds of conspiracy theories.\n7:23 Comment: But let's concentrate on the action.\n7:25 Comment: It's Verran combining there with Ilarda.\n7:28 Comment: Ilarda has Kroos at front, he plays it back to Nacho.\n7:32 Comment: Nacho outside to the Brazilian left back.\n7:40 Comment: Marcelo in position now.\n7:45 Comment: This is going to be a big half season for Ieromendi.\n7:49 Comment: He was almost on his way out to Athletic Club.\n7:52 Comment: They couldn't work out a transfer.\n7:54 Comment: He's got a chance to impress now.\n7:56 Comment: He's never really justified that price tag.\n7:58 Comment: He's never really got much of a chance to play.\n8:0 Comment: Bale looking to combine with Isco.\n8:3 Comment: Isco, lovely little chip over.\n8:5 Comment: Arbelo is there, should be able to get this one in.\n8:8 Comment: Flicks it in, but the offside flag had gone off,\n8:11 Comment: even though Cristiano Ronaldo delighted us with a fairly well executed overhead kick.\n8:17 Comment: We wanted that shot because last weekend only one shot for Real Madrid.\n8:23 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo just getting his shooting boots on.\n8:26 Comment: Still haven't had an attempt on goal from Real Madrid\n8:29 Comment: when we're coming up to the ten minute mark.\n8:31 Comment: So good start here for the Galicians.\n8:34 Comment: The ball having gone out, not offside.\n8:36 Comment: Arbelo unable to keep the ball in and Cristiano Ronaldo at least got off.\n8:42 Comment: Similar overhead kick in practice.\n8:44 Comment: Ilara unchallenged.\n8:46 Comment: Pushing it forward, a little bit of head tennis.\n8:49 Comment: Ends up with Arbelo winning it.\n8:56 Comment: Bale, a few whistles there for Gareth Bale as well.\n9:0 Comment: It's another one of you, you always get stories.\n9:3 Comment: When you're watching Real Madrid, the same I suppose can be said of Barcelona,\n9:7 Comment: there's always so many stories, isn't there?\n9:9 Comment: It's not just about the three points.\n9:11 Comment: Real Madrid in theory should be happy.\n9:14 Comment: That defeat apart, they're still top of the table.\n9:17 Comment: They still have a one point gap over Barcelona,\n9:19 Comment: which may be four if they win this afternoon.\n9:22 Comment: But there's always stories.\n9:27 Comment: Benzema combining with Marcelo.\n9:29 Comment: Marcelo has Cristiano outside him, inside to the Frenchman instead.\n9:32 Comment: Little combination with Isco.\n9:34 Comment: And that will be nothing, that'll be a goal kick.\n9:38 Comment: But a good ball from Isco.\n9:42 Comment: Marcelo the one side of Lowry.\n9:46 Comment: Wasn't even really worth Marcelo going down.\n9:49 Comment: There's no way that the referee was going to give that.\n9:55 Comment: Good defending there from Lowry and good performance,\n9:58 Comment: good opening ten minutes so far for the Depo boys.\n10:2 Comment: And the longer this goes on, without a goal for Real Madrid,\n10:6 Comment: the better for Depo because Bernabeu may turn on Real Madrid.\n10:14 Comment: Ten years ago, Valentine's Day, a similar story.\n10:17 Comment: There was a Ronaldo wedding a few days before the game.\n10:23 Comment: Real Madrid came out to applause.\n10:25 Comment: Lost 2-0 to Atletico Bilbao and obviously didn't go off to applause.\n10:29 Comment: It's Depo pushing forward again, they've shot this time from Lucas.\n10:33 Comment: And not too much of a problem there for Iker Casillas.\n10:38 Comment: And again a mix of applause with the odd whistle thrown in for the Real Madrid captain and idol.\n10:47 Comment: Calo Ancelotti asked yesterday if one of the changes he was going to make was in between the sticks.\n10:52 Comment: But Kelo Navas doesn't get a run out today.\n10:56 Comment: Calo Ancelotti standing by Iker Casillas once again.\n11:1 Comment: Ilara looking for Bale.\n11:6 Comment: Mabalo again making the run in and once again unable to play the ball in.\n11:10 Comment: Doesn't have to though because it would be a corner to Real Madrid.\n11:14 Comment: Iker Casillas came under criticism for saying that apart from the goals,\n11:18 Comment: he didn't think Real Madrid played too badly last weekend.\n11:21 Comment: Maybe not what the fans wanted to hear.\n11:24 Comment: Certainly not. Ilara going to return the ball.\n11:31 Comment: To Cruz.\n11:34 Comment: This time Ilara spreading it to Marcelo.\n11:37 Comment: Marcelo has Benzema to his left.\n11:40 Comment: Set the half still in the box.\n11:42 Comment: Varane, one of them, waiting to see if he'll get the opportunity.\n11:46 Comment: The ball go out for a throw in.\n11:47 Comment: Varane.\n11:48 Comment: And Nacer will make their way back to their normal positions.\n11:52 Comment: There's Manuel Pablo, 39 years of age.\n11:55 Comment: Cruz, partner in, not crime, but partner in beauty with Valeron of Deport.\n12:1 Comment: As Cristiano Ronaldo!\n12:3 Comment: Off the crossbar. Benzema looking to get on the end of the replay.\n12:7 Comment: There was no flag.\n12:10 Comment: First shot of the game for Real Madrid.\n12:14 Comment: Looks like one side there.\n12:18 Comment: Bale lays it off. It's a good touch from Ronaldo.\n12:20 Comment: Two defenders around who could maybe have played through Benzema there.\n12:23 Comment: You can't really fault it when he's so very nearly put Real Madrid ahead.\n12:28 Comment: It just takes that awkward bounce back, which means that Lare can recover and Benzema can't quite put it past Pavarotti.\n12:35 Comment: They've been looking for a flag for Benzema. He's definitely on the side.\n12:38 Comment: There was Isco.\n12:40 Comment: Takes on two on the near side.\n12:42 Comment: Isco, little flick to the back post!\n12:45 Comment: And he'll go over for a corner.\n12:50 Comment: Bale looking to get on the end of it.\n12:52 Comment: Didn't really look like there was enough space there for Isco to get the ball over.\n12:57 Comment: Well, he's a player who can conjure up space from nothing.\n13:0 Comment: Such good footwork, Isco.\n13:2 Comment: Excellent control as well from long balls over.\n13:5 Comment: And he can just get that extra metre where he can get the ball across.\n13:10 Comment: Real Madrid beginning to dominate over the last two minutes or so.\n13:15 Comment: Pichet to Cruz.\n13:17 Comment: That would be a free kick to the challenge by Manuel Pablo.\n13:21 Comment: It's one of those storms that Deportivo Lacrosse will have to weather because now Real Madrid are finding their groove a bit.\n13:27 Comment: That shot against the crossbar will have boosted Real Madrid.\n13:31 Comment: They will have to stay organised and not let Real Madrid really get on top of them.\n13:37 Comment: They need to keep the ball if they get it and move things forward slowly.\n13:41 Comment: Because those early chances they had, they haven't converted them.\n13:45 Comment: And now it's Real Madrid's turn to attack.\n13:48 Comment: Free kick for the white.\n13:52 Comment: Oran and Nacho at the back of the line of players.\n13:56 Comment: And it's...\n13:58 Comment: I think he said the halfs they were going for but well collected there by Fabrizio.\n14:5 Comment: Real Madrid will be missing those two big men, Pepe and Pichet.\n14:9 Comment: Offset pieces, off corners and free kicks into the box.\n14:14 Comment: Oran has been known to score the odd header but nowhere near as prolific as Sergio Ramos.\n14:21 Comment: It's another Deportivo corner.\n14:25 Comment: I'm sure Victor Fernandez will be very happy indeed with the start made by the blue and white.\n14:40 Comment: A change of taker, it's not going to be Cavalero anymore, it's Celso Borges for new signing.\n14:46 Comment: Costa Rican international flings this one into the edge of the six.\n14:51 Comment: Real Madrid, this is where they can be dangerous. The pace of Ronaldo and Bale.\n14:57 Comment: It's Cristiano Ronaldo.\n15:1 Comment: He's thinking of the...\n15:3 Comment: ...long ball, played it short instead to Hilaria.\n15:6 Comment: Ronaldo this time finding Varane, outside in his Arbiloa.\n15:11 Comment: Inside for Kroos.\n15:13 Comment: Topo plenty of time to reposition themselves, Hilaria.\n15:27 Comment: And there's a little nipple on Kroos, brings him down, it'll be another free kick.\n15:30 Comment: They'll have to be taken a few metres back.\n15:33 Comment: Now, Oriol Riera just breaking up play.\n15:41 Comment: Varane inside for Hilaria, Hilaria will find Disco.\n15:50 Comment: That's good, turns the ball to put a little knock there from Borges.\n15:54 Comment: Kroos.\n15:58 Comment: Another with Bale, Disco.\n16:1 Comment: Pulled through well read by Lucinho.\n16:4 Comment: Topo come forward once more.\n16:11 Comment: I think combining with Lucas, it was a big shout there.\n16:14 Comment: I'm not sure if there was that much intensity, but it was a big shout.\n16:18 Comment: I think combining with Lucas, it was a big shout there.\n16:21 Comment: I'm not sure if there was that much intensity, but it was a big shout.\n16:24 Comment: Hilaria, the man hurt.\n16:27 Comment: You could hear the blow and the shout.\n16:30 Comment: Well, Riera Mendy had every right to go for that 50-50 ball.\n16:36 Comment: Looks like just followed through Lucas.\n16:40 Comment: Nothing too untoward there, but that does smart even with shin pads on.\n16:44 Comment: Disco looks to turn, well read by Borges again.\n16:48 Comment: Costa Rica have a good game in midfield.\n16:51 Comment: Cavalero also involved, the 1-2 doesn't quite come off and Real Madrid with a chance to push forward.\n16:56 Comment: I think the fans looking for a little bit more pace from Real Madrid.\n17:4 Comment: Good possession by Real Madrid, but they need to maybe step up the gear in the last third.\n17:9 Comment: It hasn't really been working out for them on the wings just yet.\n17:13 Comment: Abelo is coming on the right-hand side.\n17:15 Comment: Benzema looking for Abelo.\n17:19 Comment: It's a fine challenge by Lozinho once more.\n17:23 Comment: Kuenke pushes it back. Lozinho up towards the halfway line.\n17:30 Comment: It's Oriol Riera.\n17:38 Comment: You would have thought they would have ran at Manuel Pablo.\n17:42 Comment: With all respect, I'm not talking necessarily about his age, but as he is a fullback, not a centre-half.\n17:49 Comment: I haven't really seen Real Madrid concentrating their attacks on the left-hand side of the centre-half pairing.\n17:56 Comment: On the right-hand side as they stand.\n17:59 Comment: What a shot from Bale.\n18:1 Comment: Fabrizio got a touch on it as well that might have pushed it onto the bar.\n18:4 Comment: We were just saying they hadn't attacked Manuel Pablo.\n18:6 Comment: He slipped up in the build-up to that.\n18:7 Comment: That allows Bale the opportunity to pop that off with the left foot.\n18:13 Comment: I think he does get a touch in it for Fabrizio. That is a very good stop.\n18:17 Comment: Incredible save then. That's two crossbars for Real Madrid as they begin to warn Deport.\n18:28 Comment: No boost for Gareth Bale there. He had no other option available and he really went for that, pulling the trigger from outside the box.\n18:38 Comment: He's still losing out midfield. Picked up by Riera.\n18:43 Comment: He's pulled forward. Paul won and it's Real Madrid in possession now with Rafael Varane.\n18:52 Comment: Potentially it is a very dangerous move to have Manuel Pablo in a fullback.\n18:58 Comment: Never played there and he's not... well, he might be matched for it, but he's spent most of his time on the bench this season\n19:3 Comment: rather than playing. Attempting to move into a more managerial role.\n19:7 Comment: He's been taken under the wing by Victor Fernandez.\n19:10 Comment: But he's going to be slightly off the pace, whatever.\n19:13 Comment: And you're going up against arguably the most potent strike force in all of the Liga, if not Europe.\n19:18 Comment: That's a real test for this Deport back four.\n19:21 Comment: But as we said, nine players unavailable for Victor Fernandez.\n19:25 Comment: Real Madrid win possession in the middle of the field.\n19:28 Comment: It's Nacho. Nacho playing it forward.\n19:30 Comment: Nacho's joined the attack. Benzema will shoot.\n19:34 Comment: Shot is blocked. Deport now will bring it forward.\n19:39 Comment: Very good stuff from Lowry there. Just came across.\n19:42 Comment: Saw that space in the middle and made sure he closed it down.\n19:46 Comment: Bale. Gun of Bale inside to Benzema!\n19:50 Comment: It's a corner.\n19:53 Comment: In the end it was good defensive work once more by the Blue Mites.\n19:57 Comment: They were looking for a possible offside there.\n20:4 Comment: Bale makes the pass.\n20:6 Comment: I think the defender just throws himself to the ground rather than at the feet of the attacker, Karim Benzema.\n20:13 Comment: But it did the job. Just a light scuff round the post.\n20:17 Comment: Cruz with Real Madrid's fourth corner. The ball punched away.\n20:20 Comment: It'll be picked up by Ilara.\n20:23 Comment: Ilara looking for support.\n20:24 Comment: Does well. Finds Isco. Isco a little nibble over the back four.\n20:30 Comment: Bale! And into the hands of Fabrizio.\n20:34 Comment: But a bright start from the Welshman.\n20:37 Comment: He's been accused of being selfish but he's had very little other option of what he could do in that circumstance.\n20:44 Comment: Haven't been shot before.\n20:46 Comment: He's trying to conjure up something from nothing there. The ball over the top. Lowry lost track of it.\n20:51 Comment: Ball's there for Nacho as he recovered the ball well. Gave it to Verlander.\n20:55 Comment: Verlander plays it to the halfway line. It'll be a free kick for the challenge by Benzema.\n20:59 Comment: I say Gareth Bale is one of those players who started the strongest in this game.\n21:4 Comment: You can't really be booing and criticising a player who's looking the most up for this game of any player in the Real Madrid line-up.\n21:12 Comment: It's a nice touch there from Nacho. Possibly foot high but he's got a good shot.\n21:18 Comment: Deppel with an opportunity. Offside against Riera.\n21:23 Comment: That's how he likes to play Riera. Just alongside the last man. He's an old style centre forward.\n21:31 Comment: Although he has got a few tricks in his boots.\n21:34 Comment: That's how Deppel will look to hit him today. Just over the top. The long ball.\n21:39 Comment: Not leaving themselves too exposed and committed forward.\n21:42 Comment: Kroos intercepts well. Finds Cristiano Ronaldo. Arbelo joining the attack out of Bale.\n21:48 Comment: Bale. Lovely ball into Benzema. Ronaldo. Isco.\n21:56 Comment: Isco. What are you just...\n22:2 Comment: Didn't know what was going on. Who was going to put the ball in the back of the net?\n22:6 Comment: In the end it's Isco.\n22:7 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo. A little smile on his face thinking maybe I should have got a touch on that.\n22:13 Comment: But delightful ball in initially.\n22:17 Comment: What we expected. It's taken half of the first half to get there.\n22:22 Comment: But Real Madrid have established the lead.\n22:24 Comment: Isco makes sense of the chaos. Pulled across by Benzema.\n22:28 Comment: Nine times out of ten Ronaldo puts that in.\n22:30 Comment: And he's just got to get the ball in.\n22:31 Comment: And again I think it came from a bit of defensive chaos.\n22:34 Comment: Manuel Pablo going across to the right hand side of a defence.\n22:37 Comment: That left a bit of space for the initial move.\n22:39 Comment: Two delightful balls there. Obviously the finish from Isco.\n22:42 Comment: And the initial pass with the outside of the boot by Cristiano Ronaldo.\n22:45 Comment: And the goal.\n23:28 Comment: Start to the game.\n23:33 Comment: Cruz.\n23:34 Comment: Lovely ball out to Marcelo.\n23:37 Comment: Ronaldo outside him.\n23:39 Comment: I don't see much of Ronaldo on the wing.\n23:45 Comment: Looking to get around Lore. He can't do so.\n23:48 Comment: Well you could have given him the free kick either way I think.\n23:51 Comment: Ronaldo assumed that he was being impeded.\n23:55 Comment: And then pushed Laura out of the way.\n23:58 Comment: And then got the free kick given for the initial challenge.\n24:3 Comment: Cruz having a joke there but he'll know that Ronaldo decides the free kicks.\n24:9 Comment: Well there's, yeah, didn't spot the shirt pull.\n24:14 Comment: And Laura trying to make it look as if he'd been put over.\n24:17 Comment: But made sure he still kept a hand on that shirt just in case Cristiano Ronaldo got away.\n24:21 Comment: This is going to be very, very tricky for the Depo defence.\n24:24 Comment: Because Ronaldo could very well shoot from here.\n24:27 Comment: I think that's what we're expecting.\n24:28 Comment: Ronaldo into the body of Fabrizio.\n24:35 Comment: Just about two man wall ahead of him.\n24:36 Comment: He thought he would pop off a shot.\n24:43 Comment: Perhaps question the decision making there from Ronaldo.\n24:45 Comment: It was almost too predictable.\n24:48 Comment: Both ones, you've really got to try and catch the goalkeeper by surprise.\n24:52 Comment: But I think everybody knew Cristiano Ronaldo was going to go for goal from that position.\n24:57 Comment: He's scoring.\n24:58 Comment: Impeded.\n24:59 Comment: That'll be a free kick to Real Madrid.\n25:0 Comment: Looks like Carlo Ancelotti's had more touches than some of the Depo team.\n25:3 Comment: The La Coruña players over the last few minutes.\n25:10 Comment: Depo have to respond quickly.\n25:11 Comment: They can't just sink back and try and defend.\n25:15 Comment: Because Real Madrid, now that they've scored one, they will push forward even more.\n25:22 Comment: Veran inside to Nacho.\n25:24 Comment: Nacho will find Isco.\n25:27 Comment: Isco with a long ball forward.\n25:28 Comment: Looking for Ronaldo.\n25:30 Comment: Finds the hands of Fabrizio.\n25:33 Comment: Didn't see too much of Cristiano Ronaldo with the ball at his feet in the opening 25 minutes.\n25:38 Comment: It's been mostly Bale and Isco who've been doing the shift with that.\n25:45 Comment: Ronaldo's going to be looking for a goal desperately before the end of the first half.\n25:49 Comment: Certainly before the end of the game.\n25:55 Comment: First on Ancelotti's mind.\n25:57 Comment: Of course it's the three points to re-establish a four-point lead over Barcelona.\n26:4 Comment: Those games, not last week but the week before, those two games for Real Madrid, Sevilla and Atletico Madrid,\n26:10 Comment: were always going to be key for showing a real state of play in La Liga.\n26:15 Comment: Because up until then, from around about November, Real Madrid had always had that game in hand.\n26:21 Comment: And that game in hand was always going to be against Sevilla, potential banana skin for them.\n26:26 Comment: Then Atletico Madrid right after.\n26:28 Comment: And it just shows how tight La Liga is after the turn of a new year.\n26:36 Comment: La Liga has certainly been boosted this season.\n26:39 Comment: Not only with Atletico Madrid but Valencia and Sevilla, both capable of getting results against anyone.\n26:45 Comment: Sides which take points off the big teams as well.\n26:49 Comment: Valencia only conceding points to FC Barcelona and even then they pushed them all the way.\n26:56 Comment: Caballero, closing to the box, cleared from the edge of the six.\n27:4 Comment: Now they'll have to defend Nacho once again with the clearance.\n27:7 Comment: Lucas, got the overlap on the left hand side, the ball played back in towards Riera.\n27:13 Comment: It's cut out though by Cruz.\n27:20 Comment: It's a well put double recover, the ball flicked away by Varane.\n27:25 Comment: Caballero is challenged by Marcelo.\n27:28 Comment: Marcelo with one of the most graceful of clearances but he does the job, he'll be a threat.\n27:35 Comment: It's a good ball from Bergantinos.\n27:44 Comment: Deport, looked very impressive in the first five minutes there.\n27:49 Comment: He's got a good shot, he's got a good shot.\n28:1 Comment: Very impressive in the first five minutes there.\n28:4 Comment: Launching an attack now after some sustained pressure from Real Madrid and the goal of Cruz.\n28:9 Comment: Marcelo losing out, Caballero will just about get there and the ball has gone out for a goal kick in favour of the All Whites.\n28:26 Comment: Cruz combining with Hilario, Hilario pushes it out.\n28:29 Comment: There's the run from Ronaldo.\n28:32 Comment: It's a failed interception, Ronaldo has Benzema inside, can't get around Lopo.\n28:39 Comment: The Spaniards send a half and it'll be another corner in favour of Real Madrid.\n28:44 Comment: Ronaldo has waited for a bit more support than simply Karim Benzema.\n28:50 Comment: What Lopo just said to Cristiano Ronaldo, he didn't seem to appreciate that.\n28:54 Comment: He said it with a smile, I'm all in favour of some tension breaking jokes.\n29:1 Comment: But as you say, Ronaldo didn't really join in as the ball played in towards Benzema.\n29:6 Comment: It's over the crossbar, they're looking for a push by the Frenchman.\n29:12 Comment: I don't think they wanted a free kick to be given, but it's just to, the next time that there's a corner,\n29:19 Comment: just have the referees aware, just have any contact they can look to the referee to stop a play and ensure that Real Madrid, every move is vigilated.\n29:32 Comment: Certainly looked like it could have been a push on that, Alex Bergantinos by Benzema as the ball played forward.\n29:38 Comment: Now, the back heel doesn't work for Cavalero, but Depo picked it up again, Lucas.\n29:45 Comment: Second time we've seen Marcelo slip in this game.\n29:55 Comment: Berton Tullius involved on the edge of the area, the shot comes in, fired wide.\n30:2 Comment: Let's hear that quaker once again.\n30:6 Comment: It was off target and Cavalero said, why don't you pass it off to me?\n30:9 Comment: I think Depo, some of the players want to keep possession and someone like Cuenca, whenever there's an opportunity,\n30:16 Comment: we've seen him shoot two, three times in the game so far.\n30:21 Comment: He's one of those who's a little bit more trigger happy.\n30:25 Comment: 30 minutes gone in the Bernabeu, it's Real Madrid 1-0 Depo, a fine finish from Isco Isco.\n30:33 Comment: Played back to Fabrizio, Fabrizio under some pressure, clears up towards the halfway line,\n30:39 Comment: Varane gets up very well, but there was an elbow out, I think that's what Estrada Fernandez has blown.\n30:48 Comment: Yeah, Aurelio Riera trying to beat Varane to the punch.\n30:52 Comment: He was trying to back up onto him and make the bet as well afterwards.\n30:56 Comment: Nothing too underwhelming, because he's trying to get the momentum in order to get the header forward.\n31:2 Comment: You could argue against the free kick even there, because he's cleared the ball before there's any contact with Aurelio Riera.\n31:10 Comment: But the referee's very keen on Bruno Mars and players with their arms out when they jump,\n31:15 Comment: as we've seen the other day, and he's got a good shot.\n31:18 Comment: Aurelio Riera, but the referee's very keen on Bruno Mars and players with their arms out when they jump,\n31:25 Comment: as Lucinio brings it forward for Depo, the ball in, another header away by Varane.\n31:31 Comment: It will be a blue and white throw.\n31:34 Comment: Lucinio's an interesting one, because all the time in the second division he was playing as a midfielder, as a winger on the left,\n31:41 Comment: and Victor Fernandez prefers him to play at left back, where he doesn't seem to push forward too much.\n31:49 Comment: Obviously there are advantages, though, if you have a fullback who's normally a winger or midfielder,\n31:55 Comment: because you would expect him to do exactly that, push up more.\n31:59 Comment: There's a natural tendency.\n32:2 Comment: That was probably the first run towards the corner flag for Lucinio in this first half,\n32:7 Comment: but Depo have impressed in patches, haven't they?\n32:11 Comment: There's some good midfield possession, they look good going forward.\n32:17 Comment: The story of their season, what's really let them down has been a lack of efficiency in front of goal\n32:24 Comment: and defensive mistakes, even with their first choice defence at Sydney,\n32:28 Comment: had an absolute horror show against Real Madrid at Ria Thor in the first half of the season.\n32:37 Comment: Six goals away from home, the lowest in La Liga for Deportivo.\n32:43 Comment: We're expecting more goals this afternoon.\n32:45 Comment: Nacho.\n32:49 Comment: Inside for Isco.\n32:57 Comment: This ball's played back to Casillas.\n33:2 Comment: Ripples of applause for Iker Casillas, he didn't seem to have a fairly comprehensive stop from him.\n33:8 Comment: And they'd whistled him beforehand in the game when he was taking a goal kick.\n33:12 Comment: Isco impeded, it'll be a free kick to be taken by Toni Kroos.\n33:20 Comment: Ilara.\n33:22 Comment: It's put wide to the right, Gareth Bale.\n33:25 Comment: Bale pushes it the wrong side, but it's picked up by Kroos, Marcelo.\n33:31 Comment: Lovely ball into Ronaldo.\n33:35 Comment: Benzema.\n33:36 Comment: With the ball to Cristiano Ronaldo, it was a wonderful, another inside of the group ball from Marcelo.\n33:43 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo's cross past the area just too high.\n33:50 Comment: Deportivo bring it forward again with Borges.\n33:54 Comment: Lowry.\n34:0 Comment: Straight to Kroos.\n34:4 Comment: It is very much underrated, it's not quite at the level of Dani Alves and Messi,\n34:9 Comment: but Marcelo and Cristiano Ronaldo combining on the left-hand side is a very important combination.\n34:15 Comment: Maybe not in terms of assists from Marcelo, but in playing that overlap, allowing Ronaldo to run forward,\n34:20 Comment: overlapping him, cutting the ball back, it's all so important on that left-hand side,\n34:25 Comment: the understanding between those two players.\n34:27 Comment: Marcelo brought down for a free kick in favour of Ancelotti's men.\n34:34 Comment: Fiorano.\n34:38 Comment: I don't think Ancelotti would be especially happy if it was only 1-0 by half-time.\n34:42 Comment: I feel that Real Madrid should have at least 2 or 3 in the bag.\n34:49 Comment: Ilaria combining with Isco.\n34:53 Comment: Inside for Kroos.\n34:57 Comment: A triangle between the midfield trio.\n35:2 Comment: Combining again now, bringing in Marcelo.\n35:4 Comment: Isco has made the run down the left.\n35:7 Comment: Ilaria almost caught on the ball.\n35:10 Comment: It's a decent clearing ahead of a match on Marcelo.\n35:13 Comment: Inside, Isco into Ilaria.\n35:16 Comment: Isco pushing it back.\n35:20 Comment: It's Verrani who finds Alba Loa.\n35:27 Comment: Ronaldo drops off for Bale.\n35:30 Comment: There's the beating of Lucino this time.\n35:32 Comment: Bale looking to cut it back into the area.\n35:34 Comment: Ronaldo!\n35:38 Comment: While he was stretching for that one, maybe Isco would have had a better option.\n35:44 Comment: You certainly couldn't call Gareth Bale selfish on this move.\n35:46 Comment: Great drag back for him to find the space.\n35:50 Comment: Crosby maybe was aiming for a Kabima-Benzema overhit.\n35:54 Comment: It will be charitable to say he was looking for Ronaldo.\n35:57 Comment: Isco was waiting behind.\n35:59 Comment: Would have had a much better chance of getting the position on it.\n36:3 Comment: Getting his head over the ball rather than under it.\n36:8 Comment: I don't really think Isco is in the position to make the call to Cristiano Ronaldo to leave it.\n36:15 Comment: Not yet, but Isco certainly consolidated his place in the starting eleven this season.\n36:21 Comment: There were people worried that Isco would not quite make it and would have to move on.\n36:27 Comment: But he's performed well enough to be a starter every week.\n36:32 Comment: With the injuries to James Rodriguez during the season, he's slotted into a midfield spot.\n36:38 Comment: And then he had a game after in the cup where that line of three in the midfield was now the attacking trio.\n36:44 Comment: He's played on the left-hand side of the attack as well.\n36:48 Comment: He's a player who can do it all. He always impresses Isco wherever they put him.\n36:53 Comment: And he's one of the main beneficiaries from all these injuries for Real Madrid.\n36:58 Comment: As Ronaldo I think penalised there.\n37:2 Comment: I think it's just as well for Real Madrid because if they'd have been forced to let Isco go,\n37:7 Comment: they might have lived to regret it because Isco would be signing for a top side.\n37:12 Comment: It was interesting when he first joined Madrid from Manuel Pellegrini at Manchester City,\n37:18 Comment: his former manager at Malaga, top sides would come in for Isco and he would do a job anywhere.\n37:26 Comment: This is a wonder to watch.\n37:31 Comment: Can't help but feel he'd be driving his national team midfield for a decade or so.\n37:38 Comment: Benzema's won the ball there. The free kick though will go against the Frenchman.\n37:45 Comment: He's a little bit too keen to get around Lopo and gave away the free kick.\n37:50 Comment: It was a good first touch.\n37:53 Comment: Again, a shirt pulling from both players. He could have given it either way.\n37:59 Comment: Benzema's pulling him back by the arm but Lopo has more of a grip across the chest\n38:4 Comment: and he shows some of Lopo's handiwork to the referee.\n38:7 Comment: I think Lopo's lucky there because he was trying to trick Benzema with the drag back.\n38:11 Comment: It just shows how difficult it is to be a referee because your initial impression was yes,\n38:16 Comment: he got it right, Benzema was the culprit.\n38:18 Comment: But as you say, looking at the replay, you can see that it was a clever challenge by Lopo.\n38:25 Comment: Bale is on the end of this one. He's got Benzema and Ronaldo inside.\n38:30 Comment: Ronaldo goes down looking for the free kick.\n38:33 Comment: Estrada Fernandez is not convinced.\n38:39 Comment: Gareth Bale, you just saw the pace that he's got.\n38:42 Comment: Luis Senior's no slouch in terms of a sprint and he's just left him for dead.\n38:47 Comment: Sports driven in, Interlander Casillas.\n38:51 Comment: No real appeal there for a penalty, no real case for it.\n38:55 Comment: Luis Senior had his foot out, Cristiano Ronaldo didn't even make contact though.\n39:4 Comment: Lucas Caballero.\n39:9 Comment: It's a bit more to Bruton Tinius.\n39:13 Comment: Lucas into the middle.\n39:16 Comment: Again, Ferrandez not really missed any of those headers today.\n39:22 Comment: Those long balls there have been quite predictable towards Riera and Caballero.\n39:28 Comment: Another line of blue and white shirts there.\n39:30 Comment: None of them could get on the end of the ball and Real Madrid will once again use the pace of Bale.\n39:37 Comment: Ronaldo to his right, Benzema to his left.\n39:39 Comment: Look for the one-two, Bale goes down.\n39:41 Comment: Big shout from the crowd, nothing from the referee.\n39:43 Comment: Estrada Fernandez hasn't produced any yellow cards and I think he's had an excellent first 40 minutes.\n39:50 Comment: I think he might have out-sprinted Gareth Bale there because he was slightly ahead of play.\n39:55 Comment: Bale had dropped back and the ball came back to him.\n39:57 Comment: We'll see if it actually was a foul.\n39:59 Comment: Estrada Fernandez, he's got a bit of a run in.\n40:2 Comment: He almost sprinted ahead of the action there because Benzema was just holding things up.\n40:9 Comment: There have not really been any untoward challenges in this game so far.\n40:12 Comment: A bit of shirt pulling, a couple of tussles, a few non-convincing penalty appeals but nothing too controversial.\n40:22 Comment: That's a bit short there and well recovered by Manuel Pablo.\n40:27 Comment: Benzema completely threw him for six there.\n40:32 Comment: Real Madrid not happy with the free-kick.\n40:39 Comment: It's another penalty.\n40:41 Comment: You could understand why the decision would be given against Lopo but he's under no illusions.\n40:46 Comment: He's got a great shot, he's got a great shot.\n42:2 Comment: It happens in the... Over to Ronaldo.\n42:7 Comment: Alcil has made the run inside.\n42:9 Comment: Nutmeg there and the ball comes off Cavalero.\n42:11 Comment: It'll be a corner to Real Madrid just before half-time.\n42:14 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo, well he should really have shown a bit more respect for his elders there.\n42:19 Comment: The Elastico nutmeg on Manuel Pablo.\n42:24 Comment: Welcome back to La Liga, Manuel Pablo.\n42:28 Comment: Corner to the All Whites to be taken by Tony Cruz.\n42:33 Comment: Real Madrid, sixth of this first half.\n42:39 Comment: Fabrizio gets a good punch on him.\n42:43 Comment: And Dempre will look to break.\n42:46 Comment: Lucas the player furthers forward, Cuenca combining with Cavalero.\n42:53 Comment: And Sanford for Quintinhos.\n43:2 Comment: Real Madrid, sixth of this first half.\n43:7 Comment: Ramiro Riera really needs to be in the centre.\n43:11 Comment: Makes his way there now.\n43:14 Comment: Riera.\n43:16 Comment: Still Riera.\n43:18 Comment: He was looking to get a shot off but he does get a corner.\n43:21 Comment: Good time in the first half to get a corner as well for Victor Fernandez's men.\n43:27 Comment: I just think if they could nick one just before half-time that would completely change things around.\n43:32 Comment: What would be reflected on as a very positive first half for Real Madrid would end up looking quite negative.\n43:38 Comment: It does change the whole half-time chat doesn't it when a goal is scored just before the half-time whistle.\n43:46 Comment: Yeah, they're looking slightly concerned on the bench there alongside Ancelotti.\n43:52 Comment: Cuenca, Fernando Riera, one of those people who looks permanently concerned.\n44:2 Comment: Still Cuenca, drills the ball in.\n44:5 Comment: Easily dealt with once again by Varane.\n44:12 Comment: It's Dempre, will cover the ball.\n44:16 Comment: Kroos in turn gets it back from Real Madrid.\n44:19 Comment: We're into the last minute of the first.\n44:22 Comment: Kroos is pulled back and that will be a yellow card because as we know referees will almost always give a yellow card for a player being pulled back.\n44:31 Comment: It's also Borges going into the first yellow card of the game.\n44:37 Comment: That little cuddle with Toni Kroos.\n44:41 Comment: Kroos stopping immediately.\n44:45 Comment: Can't imagine we'd have too much added on at the end of this first half.\n44:48 Comment: We'd have almost no breaks in play.\n44:52 Comment: They've seen the physios on so it'll just be this last attack from Real Madrid.\n44:56 Comment: Bale, still Bale, chance to play their bets.\n45:0 Comment: Almost on the end of it but it's Fabrizio who collects.\n45:4 Comment: So we have a half-time score in the Bernabeu of Real Madrid 1-0.\n45:10 Comment: A fair reflection of what we've seen Duncan?\n45:12 Comment: Well we've seen Real Madrid hit the crossbar a couple of times.\n45:15 Comment: Depo starting strong but since then it's been all Real Madrid.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: at the top of La Liga. It's Depor who get us underway. They're attacking the goal to our left, Real Madrid\n0:6 Comment: in the old white shirts attacking the goal to our right.\n0:11 Comment: Don't appear to be any changes at halftime. We'll run through quickly the 11th for you. Real Madrid\n0:18 Comment: with Iker Casillas in goal, captain there. Back four of Marcelo Nacho Varane and Albeloa.\n0:25 Comment: The midfield trio is Isco Cruz and Ilarra up front at BBC. Bale, Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo.\n0:34 Comment: Depor line up with Fabrizio in goal, Lore, Manuel Pablo the captain, Lopo and Lucinho in the back.\n0:41 Comment: Percantinos, Lucas and Borges in midfield. Further upfield, Cuenca, Caballero and Oriol Riera.\n0:49 Comment: It's Real Madrid in possession, Nacho and Varane the centre half pairing.\n0:55 Comment: Haven't had too much work this afternoon. Albeloa back inside to Ilarra. Ilarra\n1:1 Comment: swings the ball inside for Nacho. Nacho will find support here from Isco, 73,000 in the\n1:8 Comment: Santiago Bernabeu today. Ronaldo looking to combine with Benzema. Benzema and foot in there from Isac Cuenca.\n1:20 Comment: Decent attendance today at the Santiago Bernabeu, 73,000 coming out. It's still quite chilly in Madrid.\n1:31 Comment: You see the substitutes warming up with the jumpers on. Juan Dominguez, one of those players who might\n1:38 Comment: be brought on just to shore up the midfield maybe. We've got Borges who's on a yellow card. He may\n1:43 Comment: come in to replace him. Borges the only player booked in the first half. Marcelo now receives\n1:49 Comment: from Isco. Marcelo sets off on a run, plays it back instead. Nacho provides, cruises with the ball.\n1:57 Comment: Everybody except Casillas in the depot half. The ball swung in by Isco but into the hands of Fabrizio.\n2:4 Comment: Looking at the bench for Real Madrid. Keilo, Naves is the reserve goalkeeper. Chicarito, Carabajal,\n2:11 Comment: Pese, Lucas Silva. We might get some minutes from him. Two youngsters, Medran and Derik joined\n2:18 Comment: on the bench. That's the free kick given for the challenge on Oriol Riyad at the depot bench.\n2:26 Comment: David the reserve keeper. Borja, Kania, Juan Dominguez, Madun Janine, Wilk and Helder Costa.\n2:35 Comment: Madun Janine is perhaps the most creative option they can bring on in the midfield.\n2:41 Comment: Second yellow card of the game. First for Real Madrid. Nacho going into the book.\n2:50 Comment: Riera, running with Cavalero. A run out signed in by Laura.\n2:57 Comment: This is Cavalero. It's a good run, drills it back. There's options here. He's shot off the post.\n3:5 Comment: What a real opportunity for Borges.\n3:8 Comment: Almost looked as if the Real Madrid defence were somewhat static then. Duncan.\n3:15 Comment: Icaro Casillas was static as well and he was criticised for not even going for...\n3:20 Comment: As the header comes in. Oh, what a save from Casillas.\n3:25 Comment: Well, just as we were saying, Casillas lacked movement. Look at this for movement.\n3:32 Comment: Very quickly redeeming himself for Icaro Casillas. Didn't know too much about that first shot which\n3:37 Comment: hit the post. That would work. Down on the left-hand side of the Santiago Bernabéu.\n3:42 Comment: It's been tested three times so far today. Casillas was beaten there but he wasn't the\n3:48 Comment: second time around. A good push out. Right start then to the second half by Depor as this\n3:55 Comment: header from Lobo unchallenging. It's now Real Madrid pushing forward Cristiano Ronaldo. Space\n4:0 Comment: on this near side for Bale. Benzema is the option. Benzema pulls it back. Isco. Benzema.\n4:10 Comment: And there was a flag and a free kick in favour of Depor. But was it for the challenge on the goalkeeper?\n4:17 Comment: It was for offside on Karim Benzema. It was a great idea though from Isco.\n4:22 Comment: Everybody was expecting him to make the shot. I think he just had that vision to find Benzema but\n4:29 Comment: offside flag up very early against the Frenchman. Benzema then catching Fabrizio accidentally in the\n4:37 Comment: top of his head. But Isco could have shot from there. It was similar to the\n4:42 Comment: position to where he got the goal from.\n4:44 Comment: Yeah we've seen he's very much capable of those curling efforts into the far post.\n4:52 Comment: Here's the challenge and it was a left foot.\n4:58 Comment: Goalkeepers can become a little bit wary of playing against Benzema. There was of course the Beto incident in the Sevilla-Real Madrid game.\n5:7 Comment: Fabrizio smarting but I think there's no danger of David being brought on to replace him.\n5:13 Comment: No Germain looks. Another player is out injured.\n5:18 Comment: He might be left over. Víctor Fernández undertaking a change of clothes and coming on himself because\n5:24 Comment: very much down to a bare bones Deportivo La Coruña.\n5:32 Comment: Well there's obviously some change in formation or maybe we will see movement from the bench for Deportivo.\n5:42 Comment: Just kept in by Marcelo. Marcelo the pressure. Plenty of blue and white shirts around him.\n5:51 Comment: The Boca in the way. Camilero.\n6:1 Comment: Inside now for Bergentinos.\n6:3 Comment: Companion with Borges.\n6:5 Comment: Borges who hit the post moments ago.\n6:7 Comment: Riera.\n6:9 Comment: Boutelore.\n6:11 Comment: And it'll be a corner. It is a good opening five or six minutes of the second half for the Galicians.\n6:20 Comment: We saw them start strong in the first half. Likewise in the second period.\n6:26 Comment: Best couple of chances that we've seen for them in this game.\n6:28 Comment: Shot against the post and the parry away from Casillas.\n6:38 Comment: Camilero. Camilero into the box.\n6:40 Comment: And it'll be a goal kick. Lucas's shot.\n6:47 Comment: I'm not sure if it was going in but it hit one of his own players and the flag was raised.\n6:53 Comment: May have been offside against Lopo. It might have been on there but it hits him and goes out.\n6:59 Comment: So the end result the same. Wolf around Madrid.\n7:4 Comment: Riera has support here from Luzinho.\n7:24 Comment: Bergentinos.\n7:27 Comment: Killed away once again by Varane.\n7:31 Comment: That's a risky header. Well recovered there by Manuel Pablo.\n7:47 Comment: A challenge on Varane.\n7:49 Comment: And Sanford Cruz.\n7:52 Comment: There's Otao Baloa. Baloa has to pass quickly.\n7:56 Comment: Fante Lara.\n8:4 Comment: Ronaldo.\n8:8 Comment: Francisco. Little one two. Ronaldo.\n8:10 Comment: Still Ronaldo. Benzema.\n8:12 Comment: Flipped away. Picked up by Isco. He was looking two feet. Benzema.\n8:19 Comment: And Bale was screaming for that in the middle.\n8:21 Comment: And he was left wide open. Just needed that cross in and Gareth Bale would have had a fairly easy tap in.\n8:35 Comment: Lola.\n8:37 Comment: This time Bale does get the ball.\n8:39 Comment: Takes on the full back. Drills it back across the goal.\n8:44 Comment: The offence was there to clear.\n8:46 Comment: Strange from Cristiano Ronaldo. Usually would make that run to the post. Instead decided to stay back.\n8:52 Comment: And left Gareth Bale with very little option.\n8:58 Comment: Recovered by Nacho.\n9:0 Comment: Marcelo.\n9:6 Comment: Nacho caught out there but on the covers.\n9:14 Comment: Ronaldo.\n9:20 Comment: Antonio Cruz.\n9:22 Comment: And Sanford Lara.\n9:24 Comment: Lara plays it back. This is Veran.\n9:30 Comment: Ronaldo.\n9:34 Comment: Certainly can't fault Depo's efforts in this second half.\n9:39 Comment: Come out really with that air of believing in themselves as Boccontinos takes the swipe.\n9:47 Comment: But it picked up by Cuenca. Lucas won't get there. The ball is short.\n9:51 Comment: De Lara always the favourite. Passes it out to Gareth Bale.\n9:57 Comment: Bale unable to get it back. Luisinho.\n10:5 Comment: Isco finds Ronaldo.\n10:9 Comment: Still Ronaldo. Isco.\n10:17 Comment: Marcelo.\n10:21 Comment: Just been nibbled at there by Laurid.\n10:25 Comment: 10 minutes into the second half. Just the one goal in it. A wonderful curler from Isco.\n10:35 Comment: Isco on the ball now.\n10:39 Comment: Cruz.\n10:43 Comment: Hans-Peter Bernhardt is slightly restless.\n10:47 Comment: 10 minutes into the second half.\n10:49 Comment: Had a few whistles in the first period but nothing too critical.\n10:57 Comment: However now with just a little lull in play.\n10:59 Comment: Hearing a few whistles and boos.\n11:1 Comment: With Depo Thiebelakker only getting more chances.\n11:4 Comment: Luisinho plays it inside to Borges.

Comment: stopping short of going over to the referee\n33:3 Comment: and asking him for a yellow card\n33:5 Comment: he more or less did that with a little kick out at Cuenca\n33:7 Comment: the referee had no choice there\n33:11 Comment: and of course he knew exactly where he was\n33:13 Comment: he knew he was outside the area\n33:15 Comment: and realised that he would take the yellow for it\n33:17 Comment: and there will be another substitution\n33:19 Comment: Carvajal\n33:21 Comment: about to come on for Abeloa I would imagine\n33:27 Comment: just a little warm up maybe for Carvajal\n33:31 Comment: probably expect him to play against Schalke rather than Abeloa\n33:35 Comment: and you know 12, 13, 14 minutes here today\n33:37 Comment: would be useful for him\n33:39 Comment: to get the engine running again\n33:43 Comment: and if you've got a player on a yellow card\n33:45 Comment: and you've got a substitute on the bench\n33:47 Comment: why not bring him on\n33:49 Comment: so many reasons to make this substitution\n33:51 Comment: Lucas after a fine run just moments ago\n33:53 Comment: being replaced\n33:55 Comment: it's Medoun Janine who's going to come on\n33:57 Comment: and he might jog over and ask\n33:59 Comment: if he can take the free kick\n34:1 Comment: because he's a specialist from set pieces\n34:3 Comment: I think Cavalero is going to wave him off though\n34:7 Comment: he's not even setting up for it\n34:9 Comment: Cavalero and well\n34:11 Comment: maybe should have left it for the Bosnian\n34:13 Comment: it was a rather unconvincing dummy\n34:15 Comment: from Medoun Janine\n34:17 Comment: not even setting himself up\n34:19 Comment: barely stopping his jog onto the pitch\n34:25 Comment: James going to see Isco come off\n34:27 Comment: I'm surprised by

replaced\n34:39 Comment: by Carvajal\n34:43 Comment: really bizarre choice\n34:45 Comment: from Carlo Ancelotti\n34:47 Comment: for the last few minutes\n34:49 Comment: surely he's not going to sit back\n34:51 Comment: and play a defensive game\n34:53 Comment: against Deportivo La Coruña\n34:55 Comment: no he'll have his motives\n34:57 Comment: Carvajal then sits in\n34:59 Comment: right

    "summary": "In a highly anticipated La Liga clash at the Santiago Bernabeu, Real Madrid took on Deportivo La Coruña. With a bustling crowd of 73,000 fans braving the chilly Madrid weather, everyone knew the importance of maintaining momentum in the title race.\n\nFrom the outset, it was evident that Deportivo came with a defensive mindset, aiming to keep Real Madrid at bay for as long as possible. The Galicians showed early resilience with their close-marking strategy, clearly intending to frustrate the home side and their fervent supporters.\n\nWithin the first few minutes, Real Madrid exhibited their intent. Gareth Bale executed an early run, creating an overlap opportunity for Alvaro Arbeloa. Bale’s movement drew a foul, resulting in a corner, though it didn’t materialize into anything significant. This opening attack set the tone, emphasizing that Real Madrid was here to dominate.\n\nDeportivo, despite their defensive outlook, showed glimpses of attacking vigor. Isaac Cuenca provided the visitors with early hope, exhibiting skillful footwork and vision. His sharpness was evident as he played a key part in Deportivo’s initial attacks. Cuenca’s surprise attempt to beat the Real keeper, Iker Casillas, at the near post demonstrated Depor's readiness to seize on any opportunities.\n\nDepor’s set-piece strategies were intriguing, hinting at their preparedness to exploit any Real Madrid defensive lapses. However, with players such as Varane and Nacho keen to redeem themselves from recent performances, Real’s backline appeared more composed and alert.\n\nReal Madrid slowly but surely began asserting control. Isco, playing with a blend of elegance and determination, orchestrated most of Real Madrid’s midfield play. His combination with Toni Kroos and Illarra saw the trio dominate possession, making it increasingly difficult for Deportivo to build any meaningful attacks. \n\nAs the game progressed, Real Madrid’s urgency to find the back of the net grew palpable. They hit the woodwork twice, once through Cristiano Ronaldo and another time through Gareth Bale, echoing their attacking prowess and bad luck. These near-misses stoked the Bernabeu faithful’s anticipation, knowing that a goal was inevitable given the sustained pressure from Los Blancos.\n\nThe breakthrough came in the 22nd minute. Real Madrid’s mounting pressure paid off when Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo combined beautifully, with Benzema delivering a delicate touch to Isco. The Spaniard showed composure and finesse to curl the ball past Fabrizio, giving Real Madrid a deserved lead. The build-up to the goal was exemplary of Real Madrid’s skill in quick, intricate play, leaving Deportivo’s defense scrambling.\n\nDepor, now trailing, had no choice but to open up. They attempted to reassert themselves, and players like Lucas and Borges tried to orchestrate midfield plays to feed their forwards. However, while their efforts were commendable, Real Madrid’s defense, particularly Varane, held firm and thwarted any significant threats.\n\nInto the second half, Depor appeared rejuvenated. Borges came agonizingly close to leveling when his fierce shot struck the post. The early minutes of the second half saw Deportivo come at Real Madrid with newfound vigor, forcing Casillas into a remarkable save from a header, further cementing his status as one of the world’s elite goalkeepers.\n\nNevertheless, Real Madrid soon found their rhythm again. The trio of Ronaldo, Bale, and Benzema roamed the attacking third with purpose, continually testing Depor’s defenses. A pivotal moment came when Benzema, in a flash of brilliant footwork and awareness, found the net once more, effectively confirming Real Madrid’s control over the game. Ronaldo played a key role in the build-up, unselfishly setting up Benzema for the finish, illustrating their seamless attacking synergy.\n\nReal Madrid’s bench strength was evident, with the introduction of Lucas Silva, giving the young signing a taste of La Liga action amidst the experienced campaigners. Silva slotted into midfield, contributing defensively while providing fresh legs for attacking transitions.\n\nAs the game neared its conclusion, Real Madrid’s intent remained clear. They sought not just to win but to dominate convincingly. The defensive organization of Depor did hold up under immense pressure, but they couldn’t find the cutting edge needed to produce a comeback. The physicality and tactical awareness of Madrid's defenders, including a standout performance from Nacho, ensured a clean sheet.\n\nReal Madrid made their final substitutions with Jesse Rodriguez coming on for Benzema. The young forward provided a fresh spark, executing a memorable run that nearly set Cristiano Ronaldo up for what would have been a sensational goal.\n\nAs the clock ticked towards the final whistle, Deportivo continued to push, albeit more out of obligation than belief. Real Madrid’s defensive structure came through again, this time with Casillas and Varane standing like fortresses at the back. Marcelo, brilliant at both ends of the pitch, carried knocks, yet his resilience encapsulated Real Madrid’s robustness.\n\nThe referee’s final whistle confirmed a 2-0 victory for Real Madrid. The scoreline might suggest a routine win, but the match was anything but straightforward, with Depor providing moments of genuine concern for the home crowd.\n\nReal Madrid’s victory reaffirmed their position atop La Liga, adding a gap to their title rivals. The Bernabeu faithful left jubilant, reassured by the three points but reminded of the competitive nature of the league. Isco’s opener and Benzema’s sealing strike showcased the attacking brilliance at Real Madrid’s disposal.\n\nFor Deportivo, the battle was far from over. Victor Fernandez would draw positives from their spirited performance, knowing full well they have the mettle to tackle the challenges ahead. The upcoming Galician derby against Celta would be paramount, not just for pride but also for maintaining their climb up the table.\n\nReal Madrid’s victory was a testament to their depth, tactical awareness, and the sheer individual brilliance of players who, on any given day, can change the course of a match single-handedly. As the Bernabeu lights dimmed, the focus shifted to the international stage with a forthcoming Champions League clash. The victory over Deportivo La Coruña served as both a confidence booster and a reminder that every game in Spain’s top division is a battle replete with its own stories and dramas."
