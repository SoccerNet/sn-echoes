It was 5-0 by the break,\n0:17 Comment: 4-0 almost by the half hour.\n0:19 Comment: I don't know if it will be that easy for them today.\n0:22 Comment: There's Luso looking to get down the left there\n0:26 Comment: for Córdoba.\n0:31 Comment: Nice work there from the number 6.\n0:33 Comment: Decent ball into the area as well.\n0:34 Comment: Alba, only got a one game ban for his comments to the referee\n0:38 Comment: against Espanyol a week ago.\n0:46 Comment: That ball sent out wide. Bebe couldn't keep it in.\n0:49 Comment: He's done quite well since coming in the January transfer window.\n0:54 Comment: Bebe's shown a few touches, shown why Sir Alex Ferguson\n0:57 Comment: in his day may have wanted to sign him.\n1:1 Comment: I think his best performance was also that game against Madrid at home.\n1:4 Comment: That's another thing for Córdoba.\n1:5 Comment: A game like this is an opportunity for a lot of these players\n1:8 Comment: who are going to go down to the second division\n1:10 Comment: to prove themselves to other clubs,\n1:12 Comment: to show what they're capable of against a side of the calibre of Barcelona.\n1:16 Comment: A lot of them could maybe seal a deal next season\n1:19 Comment: to stay in the league of BBVA with a good performance today.\n1:22 Comment: Exactly. So there's plenty at stake for Córdoba\n1:24 Comment: even though they are, I'd say, defeat would seal their relegation.\n1:31 Comment: This might be slightly difficult for Barcelona.\n1:33 Comment: Obviously, home advantage is an advantage for a certain reason.\n1:36 Comment: When Barca play in the camp now, it's nicely manicured,\n1:39 Comment: nicely watered, helping the ball move, skip quickly across the playing surface.\n1:44 Comment: If you remember, Barca struggled winning Granada not so long ago.\n1:51 Comment: They were really struggled to beat Granada\n1:54 Comment: who looked like they were going to be joining Córdoba going down as well.\n1:57 Comment: Anyhow, here's the ball out wide to Alves.\n2:0 Comment: Dani Alves whips that ball in\n2:2 Comment: and that should have been the first goal of the game.\n2:5 Comment: There's Neymar getting in behind his marker\n2:9 Comment: and volleying over from all of eight yards.\n2:12 Comment: Great ball from Alves. Neymar should have scored.\n2:15 Comment: What's incredible also, Córdoba got five defenders lining up today.\n2:19 Comment: You can see all five of them right there inside the box\n2:22 Comment: and Neymar still finds a way to be unchallenged\n2:25 Comment: and get his foot on the end of that.\n2:27 Comment: But a player of his quality has to put that away.\n2:30 Comment: José Antonio Romero, the Córdoba coach.\n2:33 Comment: Third coach this season.\n2:35 Comment: He actually was promoted from the Córdoba B team after Djokic sacking him.\n2:39 Comment: It has to be said, the Córdoba B team, when he was promoted,\n2:42 Comment: had bottom of their group as well,\n2:44 Comment: but maybe more to do with their budget\n2:47 Comment: rather than his coaching ability, to be brutally honest.\n2:51 Comment: Probably guilty of, when they were being promoted,\n2:55 Comment: not making the signings necessary, possibly because of financial reasons,\n2:59 Comment: to assure Primera Liga survival.\n3:2 Comment: It has to be said, remember, they came through the playoffs\n3:5 Comment: after finishing seventh in the Spanish second division.\n3:8 Comment: And miraculously came through, beating Las Palmas.\n3:11 Comment: Absolute last-minute goal on the buzzer.\n3:14 Comment: But it's never right. There's always something going wrong at a club\n3:17 Comment: when you've had three different managers in a season,\n3:19 Comment: like Granada, Córdoba.\n3:21 Comment: Obviously the problem isn't in the dugout,\n3:23 Comment: it's the squad they've prepared for the season.\n3:26 Comment: A manager can't do miracles for these players.\n3:28 Comment: Exactly. Granada's, by the way, sacking coach Abel Recino\n3:32 Comment: after Thursday's home defeat to Espanyol.\n3:35 Comment: Abel, who was in charge for that 9-1 humiliation in the Bernabeu,\n3:38 Comment: and to be fair, they haven't won since then.\n3:43 Comment: And it's no coincidence, aside bottom and second from bottom,\n3:46 Comment: that now's in the third coach of the season.\n3:48 Comment: Meanwhile, Barcelona on the ball, Rakitic to Busquets.\n3:54 Comment: Javier Macerano once again, space for Dani Alves.\n4:1 Comment: Edi Mar just a bit of a close down Alves there a little bit.\n4:7 Comment: Barcelona keep in possession once again.\n4:9 Comment: Macerano looks to spread that one out wide,\n4:11 Comment: and Alves gets half a touch,\n4:13 Comment: but this time can't get the ball across.\n4:18 Comment: Piqué.\n4:23 Comment: Leo Messi.\n4:26 Comment: Neymar to Messi, 38 goals this season.\n4:31 Comment: Lovely little dummy there from Iniesta.\n4:33 Comment: Leo Messi once again.\n4:38 Comment: Very patient football from Barcelona.\n4:40 Comment: Two lines of defenders from Córdoba in the penalty area.\n4:46 Comment: Leo Messi, we should say, this week celebrated\n4:49 Comment: the 10th anniversary of his first ever Barcelona goal.\n4:53 Comment: Against Alves, was that first goal.\n4:58 Comment: It's Alves again coming up into space,\n5:0 Comment: and surely this has to... No, it isn't.\n5:2 Comment: Well, he spoke too soon.\n5:4 Comment: Neymar and Messi between them.\n5:8 Comment: Managing to not even get a shot in.\n5:11 Comment: I think that looked like a good last-ditch challenge,\n5:13 Comment: maybe from the Córdoba player.\n5:14 Comment: I think he just about maybe got his foot on the ball,\n5:16 Comment: or did enough to put off Messi.\n5:19 Comment: Acres of space there for Neymar,\n5:22 Comment: and it's David who got the foot in.\n5:27 Comment: Again, that's about the third time we've seen Barcelona\n5:29 Comment: inside the box with a whole amount of space.\n5:32 Comment: The good news for Barcelona is that they're creating chances,\n5:34 Comment: and so are Córdoba, however.\n5:36 Comment: That was a lovely ball into the penalty area there from Edi Mar.\n5:41 Comment: And it was Florian, I think, with the header,\n5:43 Comment: who couldn't quite direct it on target.\n5:48 Comment: That pace, a hint of offside,\n5:50 Comment: but it's tight enough not to give.\n5:53 Comment: And these are two of the best performers this season\n5:55 Comment: for Córdoba, Edi Mar and Florian Andoni.\n5:57 Comment: Definitely two of the players who will look to stay in the top flight.\n6:2 Comment: But it may be done a little bit better, that header.\n6:6 Comment: Plenty of power, just send it over the top.\n6:8 Comment: Plenty of power, just send it over the bar.\n6:11 Comment: Florian Andoni has got five goals this season.\n6:16 Comment: Just talking about the dry pitch that you were saying before.\n6:19 Comment: Have you seen that patch in front of Claudio Bravo\n6:21 Comment: where there's absolutely no grass?\n6:23 Comment: It's not very nice to dive down on that.\n6:25 Comment: Your elbows and knees are going to take a right grass spin.\n6:27 Comment: Here's Luis Suárez.\n6:30 Comment: Once again, Neymar to Suárez.\n6:33 Comment: Lovely twisting and turning from Suárez,\n6:35 Comment: but once again, dispossessed, just talking about goals.\n6:38 Comment: Córdoba has scored 21 goals all season.\n6:41 Comment: Messi scored 38.\n6:44 Comment: And Neymar has scored 20.\n6:50 Comment: But what makes football obviously worth watching is\n6:52 Comment: it doesn't always go according to plan.\n6:55 Comment: And here comes Córdoba, trying to upset those plans once again.\n6:58 Comment: It's Edi Mar.\n7:2 Comment: Hacked away by Macerano.\n7:8 Comment: They're having a little bit of success\n7:10 Comment: attacking down this left flank at Dani Alves.\n7:13 Comment: He's always been a little bit suspect on defensive duties.\n7:17 Comment: And it looks like they're pinpointing him,\n7:18 Comment: trying to have a go at Alves with Edi Mar\n7:20 Comment: coming forward from left back instead of taking on Jordi Alba.\n7:27 Comment: There's Luis Enrique down\n7:30 Comment: by the touchline.\n7:33 Comment: He was a bit evasive yesterday when he was asked about\n7:36 Comment: whether or not he'll be staying at Barcelona next season.\n7:39 Comment: There's a slight current of opinion that he may,\n7:41 Comment: no matter what he does, may not want to stay\n7:44 Comment: because he's found a job so stressful and demanding.\n7:49 Comment: That patch in around October or November, I think.\n7:52 Comment: And just after Christmas as well,\n7:54 Comment: when they lost to Real Sociedad\n7:56 Comment: and there was all the stories about his relationship with Messi.\n7:59 Comment: Messi.\n8:4 Comment: That's where I think a lot of credit has to be given to Luis Enrique,\n8:7 Comment: that he didn't implode and try to take on Messi.\n8:10 Comment: He knew how to take the back seat\n8:13 Comment: and let Messi and Neymar play the minutes they have to play.\n8:17 Comment: To be fair, that result was the catalyst for Barcelona's charge to the top of the table.\n8:23 Comment: We're in the final of the Cup.\n8:25 Comment: We've got to play Bayern in the Champions League.\n8:27 Comment: A big, very emotive day.\n8:28 Comment: That's going to be on Wednesday when Pep Guardiola comes back to the camp now\n8:31 Comment: as the rival coach.\n8:34 Comment: And if they win today, it's a massive step towards the league title.\n8:39 Comment: However, they have to win.\n8:45 Comment: Cordeba's hit up 20 points at the moment.\n8:47 Comment: That's come from three wins and 11 draws.\n8:51 Comment: So they've actually lost 20 matches.\n8:55 Comment: And only picked up two points in the whole of the second half of the season.\n9:0 Comment: With stats like that, they've got no chance of staying there.\n9:2 Comment: It did look as if, just when Dukic came,\n9:5 Comment: the first five or six matches, it looked as if he might turn it around.\n9:8 Comment: Well, they picked up a win at San Mames.\n9:10 Comment: That's something they'll take back with themselves to the Liga del Ande.\n9:14 Comment: Exactly. Here goes Barca again.\n9:17 Comment: Rakitic to Alves.\n9:19 Comment: Incredible athletic trouble.\n9:20 Comment: Lost at home to the two sides bottom of the table.\n9:23 Comment: Cordeba and Granada.\n9:24 Comment: I think otherwise they'd be having their tickets booked for the Europa League.\n9:29 Comment: And to Elche as well. They're lost at home to.\n9:34 Comment: It's a little bit wayward.\n9:35 Comment: Out for Cordeba.\n9:36 Comment: Throw in after those two early chances.\n9:39 Comment: Barca just easing up a little bit.\n9:43 Comment: The warmest...\n9:44 Comment: Well, not the warmest day of the season, being kicked off in mid-August.\n9:47 Comment: But certainly the warmest day of the season this year in 2015.\n9:54 Comment: Alves comes away with the ball, just getting ahead of Florin Andone.\n9:58 Comment: With Iniesta.\n10:3 Comment: As well, they're ahead of Luzo.\n10:6 Comment: Once again, though, the ball is given away a little bit carelessly.\n10:9 Comment: Cordeba will look to attack at speed.\n10:14 Comment: This is Krien.\n10:24 Comment: Andone and Mats Urawa just having a little discussion.\n10:29 Comment: It's a contact lens.\n10:32 Comment: Mats Krien doesn't look convinced of what he's trying to show him.\n10:37 Comment: Just an old school battle between the centre-half and the striker.\n10:40 Comment: But you can see the crowd's been lifted up by these attacks now.\n10:43 Comment: It's like disappointing attendance in the archangel.\n10:46 Comment: And it's like disappointing Krien as well.\n10:49 Comment: I was quite surprised.\n10:51 Comment: If you look at that end behind the goal, a lot of empty seats.\n10:55 Comment: And it's not as if Barça are in town every year.\n10:56 Comment: They haven't been here 42 years.\n10:58 Comment: Or more. Was it 72 the last time?\n11:0 Comment: 71, 72 season.\n11:1 Comment: 72 it would have been, though.\n11:5 Comment: It's Neymar.\n11:6 Comment: Suarez has got a little bit of space.\n11:8 Comment: Messi has got less space, but looks to find Suarez.\n11:11 Comment: Once again, that neat little backheel just cut out.\n11:13 Comment: Alves doesn't get there.\n11:16 Comment: Just to remind you, Suarez is still on a bump.\n11:19 Comment: One booking away from suspension.\n11:21 Comment: Drakic.\n11:24 Comment: And that just bounces off Messi for a corner.\n11:28 Comment: Well, off Messi and off a defender.\n11:30 Comment: So if Suarez gets booked today, he would miss next weekend's game\n11:34 Comment: against Real Sociedad, which must be a bit of a temptation,\n11:38 Comment: thinking that after that, they'll have to go to the Calderon.\n11:40 Comment: Oh, yeah, I think that's probably something maybe Luis Enrique has talked to him about.\n11:45 Comment: You'd rather have him, of course, at the Calderon than at home against Real Sociedad.\n11:49 Comment: Who are doing OK at the moment, as we said, David Moyes' side.\n11:56 Comment: Well met there by Krin.\n12:3 Comment: Real Sociedad will be without Miquel Gonzalez next week in the Calderon.\n12:8 Comment: He's suspended.\n12:12 Comment: And once again, Dani Alves.\n12:16 Comment: Just opens up a little bit in front of Alves.\n12:18 Comment: He's got Messi outside him, though.\n12:24 Comment: It's again good work, though, battling back from Bebe.\n12:27 Comment: Rakitic.\n12:29 Comment: Busquets.\n12:30 Comment: It's again Leo Messi.\n12:34 Comment: Playing very tight.\n12:37 Comment: Playing in very tight spaces, Barcelona and Bebe.\n12:39 Comment: Once again, half clears.\n12:41 Comment: Rakitic just collects.\n12:45 Comment: And it's back to Macerano.\n12:47 Comment: Busquets to Rakitic.\n12:51 Comment: And Dani Alves.\n12:56 Comment: The corner of the player there just...\n13:0 Comment: Feeling a bit groggy. It's Luso.\n13:3 Comment: Flos Gomes just bringing on some...\n13:8 Comment: Strange, though. He's touching his knee and his head.\n13:13 Comment: Don is looking at... He's getting his face checked as well.\n13:16 Comment: Is he saying he's feeling a bit dizzy?\n13:18 Comment: Let's have a look.\n13:20 Comment: A clash of heads there with Busquets, yeah.\n13:24 Comment: He just looks a little bit...\n13:27 Comment: A little bit groggy.\n13:29 Comment: That's good refereeing by Flos Gomes.\n13:31 Comment: You can't take risks with some loser, the knock on the head.\n13:34 Comment: Especially what we've seen a lot of occasions in the past.\n13:38 Comment: It's been quite serious.\n13:40 Comment: That might be what Flodin and Donny complained about.\n13:43 Comment: Is it contact lens, perhaps?\n13:46 Comment: Yeah, you can see him there, putting in a little liquid.\n13:51 Comment: I thought he was looking at his knee as well.\n13:53 Comment: It might have gone down.\n13:55 Comment: He might have just landed badly.\n13:57 Comment: A little minor stop for medical treatment.\n14:9 Comment: This won't help Barca because it's just breaking the play up.\n14:12 Comment: It's just stopping the flow of things.\n14:14 Comment: The side that's defending, having to work hard,\n14:16 Comment: is all getting a nice little drink of water.\n14:18 Comment: The game really has broken into a lull of not much happening.\n14:23 Comment: He's got a bit of a run-up.\n14:25 Comment: Not much happening.\n14:27 Comment: You've got to keep your intensity,\n14:29 Comment: you've got to keep your concentration.\n14:34 Comment: Messi spreads that one out wide.\n14:38 Comment: Neymar controls.\n14:39 Comment: Fans say maybe that was his arm.\n14:41 Comment: A free-out of Juventus says it wasn't.\n14:47 Comment: The Cordoba fans certainly in a mood to cheer everything today.\n14:51 Comment: That's a bad challenge from Neymar.\n14:56 Comment: A little bit of excessive rolling around, but...\n15:2 Comment: it's not a good challenge.\n15:6 Comment: He's being caught for the rolling.\n15:8 Comment: It's funny, he rolls until Neymar starts speaking to him,\n15:11 Comment: then he stops rolling.\n15:13 Comment: The more you roll, the less it hurts.\n15:20 Comment: It was quite a bad challenge from Neymar.\n15:23 Comment: The sky, and his contact lenses.\n15:28 Comment: You think this is difficult,\n15:30 Comment: but when you play with contact lenses on dirt pitches,\n15:33 Comment: that's when it's really nasty.\n15:35 Comment: I can't say I know what it feels like,\n15:37 Comment: because I don't wear contact lenses myself, or glasses.\n15:40 Comment: No, my day.\n15:43 Comment: There's nothing like the joy of a bit of grip behind,\n15:45 Comment: between your eye and the lens.\n15:47 Comment: It's a bit of a challenge.\n15:51 Comment: It's Cordoba looking to push forward.\n15:53 Comment: Neymar again.\n15:59 Comment: Bebe.\n16:0 Comment: Being chased back by Rakitic.\n16:2 Comment: It's a foot in, and that is a Cordoba throw-in.\n16:4 Comment: 16 minutes gone, no score here in the new Arkansas Stadium.\n16:8 Comment: They got caught there again by the hand of Pique.\n16:31 Comment: So far, no score in the new Arkansas.\n16:33 Comment: Barcelona having a couple of early chances from Neymar,\n16:35 Comment: and Mexico, who are in the lead.\n16:37 Comment: Neymar and Messi.\n16:39 Comment: Florin and Doni wasting a good one for Cordoba.\n16:42 Comment: It's with Leo Messi.\n16:45 Comment: Once again, dropping deep, as he has done in recent matches.\n16:49 Comment: He hasn't stopped from scoring goals, mind.\n16:51 Comment: And he is with Alves.\n16:54 Comment: Alves to Macerano, obviously, always provides a...\n16:59 Comment: ..a get-out.\n17:1 Comment: Javier Macerano.\n17:4 Comment: To Jordi Alba.\n17:7 Comment: Suarez looks to turn his marker, but that's good work.\n17:12 Comment: Once again from Inigo.\n17:15 Comment: That's a decent ball down the latch-handle, but Pique's across quickly.\n17:20 Comment: You can see how that ball bounced, just how dry this pitch is.\n17:23 Comment: That was a long ball, pinged with quite a lot of pace.\n17:26 Comment: And it almost stopped dead when it bounced on the ground.\n17:31 Comment: That's what home advantage is for something, you know.\n17:33 Comment: You leave the pitch a little bit longer.\n17:36 Comment: You leave it a little bit drier.\n17:44 Comment: Good work from Alves, getting the block in.\n17:47 Comment: Busquets clears, but...\n17:50 Comment: ..he's going to go out now for a Barcelona throw-in.\n17:56 Comment: I don't think it's going to be easy to play as defensively as Cordoba playing.\n18:2 Comment: For 90 minutes, with this heat, we're approaching 30 degrees, I think it said.\n18:7 Comment: There's a lot of rain behind the ball. They haven't got any of the ball.\n18:10 Comment: Well, it's Kerlitz from Rakitic giving away to Bebe, who in turn...\n18:16 Comment: ..is a little bit profligate with possession.\n18:18 Comment: It's with Andres Iniesta.\n18:20 Comment: As always, the ball swept up by Busquets.\n18:22 Comment: You've seen Messi just pull into space.\n18:24 Comment: Once again, the ball just blows up for Messi.\n18:26 Comment: Edimar's on to him.\n18:29 Comment: Alves fails to control.\n18:32 Comment: Then does well to recover.\n18:34 Comment: And Macerano, you know he's going to win those sort of challenges, don't you?\n18:37 Comment: Back with Leo Messi.\n18:39 Comment: Still Messi.\n18:41 Comment: Looks for Iniesta, but well cut out there by Karim.\n18:49 Comment: Cordoba, looking to bring it away, but there's...\n18:52 Comment: ..Ajeficito, the little boss, just steps in Macerano.\n18:58 Comment: Suarez.\n19:12 Comment: Macerano.\n19:14 Comment: Iniesta.\n19:16 Comment: Cordoba fans in decent voice as Alva makes the overlap.\n19:19 Comment: Messi half-controls it, and it's a corner, says the referee.\n19:25 Comment: Still every Barcelona cross has managed to find a Barcelona player in the box,\n19:29 Comment: although they're absolutely outnumbered.\n19:34 Comment: Just Messi, just Suarez as well.\n19:36 Comment: Both of them have found space, actually.\n19:38 Comment: With four or five defenders.\n19:40 Comment: A little bit guilty of ball-watching there.\n19:42 Comment: They just dropped off.\n19:44 Comment: Filio, who got the challenge in.\n19:48 Comment: Rakitic with the corner.\n19:55 Comment: It's a goal.\n19:57 Comment: Cleared by Juan Carlos, who's been in outstanding form of late,\n20:1 Comment: the goalkeeper, a player who I suspect will, whatever happens,\n20:4 Comment: be in the Primera next year.\n20:6 Comment: Yeah, well, when we're talking about those names,\n20:8 Comment: he'll probably stay up.\n20:10 Comment: Juan Carlos is definitely a goalkeeper.\n20:12 Comment: Someone's going to want to get their hands on him.\n20:14 Comment: His performance against Villarreal a couple of weeks ago at the Madrigal,\n20:17 Comment: where they scraped a 0-0 draw,\n20:19 Comment: one of the best goalkeeping performances of the season, no doubt.\n20:21 Comment: Rakitic here a couple of weeks ago.\n20:23 Comment: It's a decent ball in and...\n20:24 Comment: Hacked away from Suarez by Edimar.\n20:27 Comment: Just as once again it looks as if Barcelona are certain to score.\n20:30 Comment: Suarez, once again Edimar.\n20:32 Comment: Alves.\n20:36 Comment: Might well go back to the full-back.\n20:43 Comment: Barcelona start again with...\n20:47 Comment: Neymar.\n20:49 Comment: Iniesta looking for options, finds Alves.\n20:57 Comment: Rakitic.\n21:8 Comment: And Chan just slips that one out to Alba,\n21:11 Comment: who controls, crosses it first time, just...\n21:15 Comment: over Luis Suarez.\n21:18 Comment: Once again Bebe...\n21:20 Comment: doing some good defensive work.\n21:21 Comment: That wasn't quite such good defensive work, however.\n21:23 Comment: Suarez controls.\n21:24 Comment: Lion Messi on his left foot.\n21:26 Comment: Messi!\n21:27 Comment: Great block...\n21:30 Comment: from David at the expense of a corner.\n21:32 Comment: To be fair to Cordoba's defence,\n21:34 Comment: they have done well to block out all those attempts from Messi.\n21:37 Comment: Every time they have found space in the box,\n21:39 Comment: there's been a Cordoba player lunging in,\n21:41 Comment: getting a foot in.\n21:42 Comment: They've ensured the Barcelona players can't put away the ball at ease.\n21:46 Comment: Getting bodies in the way, some last-ditch challenges.\n21:53 Comment: 22 minutes gone, almost.\n21:55 Comment: Rakitic with another corner.\n21:58 Comment: Still 0-0 in the Nuevo Arc Angel.\n22:6 Comment: To Alves.\n22:8 Comment: I was thinking, as that flew towards Alves,\n22:10 Comment: I was thinking, if that goes in, it's going to be a hell of a goal.\n22:13 Comment: It hasn't gone in. Goal kick.\n22:16 Comment: I think it's something they've worked on, though.\n22:18 Comment: He has time to line it up.\n22:20 Comment: It's a difficult one, though.\n22:22 Comment: It's one of those...\n22:23 Comment: He's complaining about the pass.\n22:25 Comment: Don't think it was such a bad pass, to be honest.\n22:28 Comment: It should have been six inches lower.\n22:30 Comment: I'm not sure the volley going there was down to where the pass went.\n22:34 Comment: We've seen them put away.\n22:36 Comment: Now and then, one of those goes away.\n22:38 Comment: Paul Scholes springs to mind for me immediately.\n22:41 Comment: I think Oscar, when he was at the former Barcelona midfield\n22:45 Comment: and when he was at Albacete on loan,\n22:47 Comment: we're talking about 1993 or something like that.\n22:52 Comment: Oscar Garcia, who went on to coach Brighton, obviously.\n22:58 Comment: Maccabi...\n22:59 Comment: And a brief spell of Watford as well,\n23:1 Comment: because of their health problems.\n23:9 Comment: Watford, who have obviously been promoted to the Premier League this season in England.\n23:16 Comment: Good work there from Krin.\n23:20 Comment: Crespo.\n23:24 Comment: Luso doing well, and there's an overlap here.\n23:29 Comment: Great work from Crespo on the overlap.\n23:31 Comment: He looks up, Bebe's charging in,\n23:33 Comment: and he's actually got a good head on it there, the Portuguese striker.\n23:36 Comment: Alves did just enough to put him off as well,\n23:39 Comment: but good, thrusting counter-attack there from the home side.\n23:43 Comment: Who's certainly not going to give up their Premier League status without a battle.\n23:47 Comment: Brilliant run from Crespo.\n23:49 Comment: It's been the full-backs who have pushed well today.\n23:51 Comment: Edimar on the left and Crespo on the right.\n23:53 Comment: Have surged forward and they've found an end product with a good cross.\n23:57 Comment: That's not been bad from Cordova.\n23:59 Comment: They've looked to play three in the middle corner,\n24:1 Comment: but keeping it tight across there and just allowing the full-backs that little extra space.\n24:5 Comment: Because I don't think Barcelona are going to use those wide extremities quite as much.\n24:9 Comment: It's not particularly well read there by Busquets.\n24:12 Comment: Once again, Cordova doing quite nicely, but Alves controls to Rakitic.\n24:20 Comment: Macerano.\n24:24 Comment: Neymar.\n24:25 Comment: He's dropped the pace a little bit, ups it up a little bit too much.\n24:30 Comment: Pantic gets it back to his keeper, Juan Carlos.\n24:33 Comment: Picks out Bebe, lovely little flick there.\n24:37 Comment: He's going to...\n24:39 Comment: 190.\n24:41 Comment: In the metres.\n24:43 Comment: A little bit taller than Alves.\n24:46 Comment: Rakitic.\n24:48 Comment: Leo Messi.\n24:54 Comment: Dani Alves.\n24:58 Comment: Crespo wins the head.\n24:59 Comment: He's stuck at that one bar second of the ball, he hit the full screen.\n25:2 Comment: Now Cordova slinging five across the middle of the par.\n25:5 Comment: Four in defence and just leaving Andone a little bit further forward to try and hold things up.\n25:12 Comment: He's done really well there.\n25:13 Comment: Macerano makes a crunching challenge though.\n25:17 Comment: Rakitic gives it away.\n25:18 Comment: Not his best so far, Ivan Rakitic.\n25:21 Comment: And here come Cordova again.\n25:23 Comment: Bebe.\n25:24 Comment: He's got Edimar coming to on the overlap.\n25:26 Comment: Which is exactly where it goes.\n25:28 Comment: He should get in the area here, Edimar.\n25:30 Comment: And had Florin been able to control that, wouldn't have been a bad chance.\n25:34 Comment: 25 minutes gone.\n25:35 Comment: Cordova showing some signs of life here against Barcelona.\n25:40 Comment: Here they come again.\n25:41 Comment: Home fans responding to their team's efforts.\n25:49 Comment: Alba was looking for Bravo to maybe come for that.\n25:52 Comment: And then he had to turn away.\n25:55 Comment: Once again it's Macerano with the ball.\n25:58 Comment: Once again it's Macerano offering the way out.\n26:3 Comment: Busquets.\n26:4 Comment: Rakitic.\n26:7 Comment: It's interesting to see that we said that there's a lot of empty spaces, but it doesn't sound like it at all.\n26:12 Comment: The fans are really responding, trying to make that 12th man atmosphere.\n26:17 Comment: Barcelona looking for the goal that would momentarily give them a five point lead over Real Madrid.\n26:24 Comment: It's with Neymar.\n26:27 Comment: Again, the sheer weight of numbers in the middle keeping them at base so far.\n26:33 Comment: Alba.\n26:36 Comment: Gerard Pique comes forward.\n26:37 Comment: He just moves the ball a bit quicker.\n26:40 Comment: Barca back to the common.\n26:41 Comment: The grass is a little bit longer.\n26:43 Comment: It's a bit drier than the cap now.\n26:45 Comment: Here's Messi.\n26:46 Comment: Oh, it's Leo Messi.\n26:47 Comment: Leo Messi saved by Juan Carlos.\n26:51 Comment: What a way that would have been to celebrate his 10th anniversary.\n26:55 Comment: It's incredible how this player, you might have seen him 600 times in your life,\n26:59 Comment: and he can still get you off your seat with things he does.\n27:2 Comment: How he got through all those body of players is incredible.\n27:5 Comment: He's three players, four.\n27:8 Comment: And when you think he's going to score, it's the shot that lets him down.\n27:15 Comment: Remarkable though.\n27:16 Comment: It's just the day he won't be here will value what this player has been.\n27:22 Comment: Bright new tattoo, by the way, he's got on his arm there.\n27:29 Comment: Speaking of tattoos, David Beckham's thought of today.\n27:31 Comment: Happy birthday, David.\n27:37 Comment: Very nicely linked.\n27:40 Comment: Man who did a great deal to raise the interest worldwide of La Liga.\n27:43 Comment: Let's not forget that.\n27:51 Comment: Careless, very careless between Alves and Rakitic.\n27:56 Comment: Once again, it needed Busquets and this time Pique to get Barca out of jail.\n28:1 Comment: It's interesting how Beckham's arrival actually sparked a golden era more for Barca\n28:6 Comment: with the signing of Ronaldinho.\n28:10 Comment: That Laporta campaign, where they were talking about he was going to bring in Beckham.\n28:16 Comment: And in the end, it was Beckham to Madrid, Ronaldinho to Barcelona.\n28:18 Comment: And that's what's kickstarted that golden era.\n28:22 Comment: When we talk about Messi, what a brilliant player Ronaldinho was also.\n28:27 Comment: Still going.\n28:29 Comment: Maybe it is Barcelona time, but a little bit of a cloud.\n28:33 Comment: Possibly more for off the field officials.\n28:38 Comment: I'm sure the income at some of the bars in Barcelona has dropped since he left.\n28:48 Comment: A player who connected with the fans though, enormously.\n28:54 Comment: He's on 49 goals in all competitions this season, Leo Messi.\n29:10 Comment: Suarez looks to get through.\n29:12 Comment: Number 50 resisting so far.\n29:19 Comment: It was Rakitic to Dani Alves.\n29:26 Comment: Suarez looks to make a move in front and then he goes to Ivan Rakitic.\n29:31 Comment: Not a lot of movement there amongst the Barcelona front players.\n29:34 Comment: Just looking a little bit languid at times.\n29:38 Comment: He comes out to Jordi Alba.\n29:41 Comment: He's going to have a go at Crespo here.\n29:45 Comment: And that'll be another corner.\n29:48 Comment: Crespo wants a free kick.\n29:57 Comment: Suarez has such a low centre of gravity.\n30:0 Comment: So hard to knock him off the ball when he's running at players.\n30:4 Comment: Fourth corner of the game for Barcelona.\n30:7 Comment: Once again it's Rakitic to take it.\n30:9 Comment: He's going to take it.\n30:17 Comment: It's a little bit disappointing. It's well cut out by Fidel.\n30:23 Comment: Another chance though for Rakitic and once again,\n30:26 Comment: easily claimed by a corner but defence is Messi again.\n30:33 Comment: Picks out Alba.\n30:34 Comment: Torri and Iesta.\n30:36 Comment: Crespo cuts out the cutback.\n30:40 Comment: Great challenge from Busquets there.\n30:50 Comment: Messi.\n30:54 Comment: Space for Sergio Busquets.\n30:56 Comment: Pulls that one back. Suarez!\n31:1 Comment: And once again the final shot. A little bit disappointing.\n31:5 Comment: But again we see Barcelona players inside the box with time.\n31:10 Comment: Busquets to pick out a pass.\n31:12 Comment: All those shirts there. Still finds Suarez.\n31:14 Comment: Suarez can turn, lay it off for Iiesta.\n31:17 Comment: Off the chest.\n31:19 Comment: It's difficult to place it through all those bodies of\n31:22 Comment: Maybe a strong shot would have been the better option.\n31:25 Comment: Flicks off somebody, leaves the keeper.\n31:27 Comment: So fifth corner for Barca.\n31:29 Comment: It's again Rakitic.\n31:31 Comment: Once again a corner, but head on it this time.\n31:32 Comment: It's Kroen again.\n31:34 Comment: That'll be Barcelona throw in.\n31:37 Comment: So it's pressure from Barcelona, but so far Cordeba doing reasonably well.\n31:45 Comment: Nasty deflection and safety first there the option.\n31:52 Comment: As Pantic explains.\n31:54 Comment: Puts two balls on the pitch.\n31:56 Comment: Not the first time in this game it's happened.\n32:0 Comment: Messi.\n32:2 Comment: And Iiesta's got a little space there.\n32:4 Comment: It's Messi once again.\n32:6 Comment: Looks to break through, but Fidel sticks a challenge in.\n32:9 Comment: Mascherano.\n32:11 Comment: Busquets.\n32:13 Comment: Alba. Mascherano.\n32:15 Comment: And here's Neymar.\n32:18 Comment: Two players go across to cover him.\n32:20 Comment: And finds Andres Iiesta.\n32:23 Comment: Spinning Iiesta to Alba.\n32:25 Comment: Good challenge from Crespo.\n32:27 Comment: Very nearly lovely football from Barcelona.\n32:29 Comment: Ball just holds up a tiny bit there on the pitch.\n32:30 Comment: But they recovered it well.\n32:32 Comment: See like Barca.\n32:34 Comment: We think about their great football, the way they move it.\n32:37 Comment: What we should also see is the intensity of the pressure once they lose possession.\n32:41 Comment: That's something they've regained in these past few months with Luis Enrique.\n32:46 Comment: And today despite the pitch being long grass, dry,\n32:49 Comment: they're finding a way to play one touch football,\n32:51 Comment: passing around, running circles around the Cordeba defenders.\n32:55 Comment: Crespo's got a problem.\n32:57 Comment: It looks like he might have done a muscle.\n32:59 Comment: It was a challenge he went in with, I don't know if it was Iiesta or Neymar.\n33:3 Comment: It's like 50-50.\n33:6 Comment: Once again everyone just takes advantage to get a drink of water,\n33:10 Comment: cool down a wee bit.\n33:12 Comment: I think he's stretched there and done something.\n33:14 Comment: No, there's no contact.\n33:16 Comment: No contact at all.\n33:18 Comment: Doesn't seem like he's gone down strange.\n33:20 Comment: He gets up and his gesture when he gets up is like something's gone clunk.\n33:23 Comment: Experienced defender Crespo has been around the houses a bit.\n33:26 Comment: It looks like his contribution to this game is ended.\n33:42 Comment: So very well giving him a bit of a magic rub down.\n33:46 Comment: But if it is a slightly strained muscle,\n33:49 Comment: it's not a problem.\n33:50 Comment: But if it is a slightly strained muscle, it's...\n33:56 Comment: not a long-term solution.\n34:3 Comment: Bravo gets a touch of the ball.\n34:6 Comment: As Cordeba return it to Barcelona deep in their own half.\n34:10 Comment: So Cordeba just down at 10 men for a minute.\n34:12 Comment: It looks like Crespo's going to come back on when the referee gives him the OK.\n34:16 Comment: Might not be well, this is...\n34:18 Comment: He has given him the OK.\n34:20 Comment: See how he...\n34:22 Comment: How he is. I'd be testing him out straight away if I was Barca.\n34:26 Comment: I'm not, however, Barcelona.\n34:30 Comment: If I was a Barca player,\n34:32 Comment: I think that could have gone out to Jordi Alba.\n34:35 Comment: Maybe for him to have a run at Crespo there, just to see how that leg's going to stand up.\n34:39 Comment: There is Alba. Crespo goes across to cover.\n34:43 Comment: Once again, Barcelona, 35 minutes.\n34:47 Comment: Controlling the ball. Cordeba had a couple of decent counter-attacks,\n34:50 Comment: but still no score.\n34:52 Comment: That must be a little bit worrying for Luis Enrique.\n34:55 Comment: It's like just slightly lacking the spark of last Saturday's display against Espanyol,\n35:1 Comment: in which they were outstanding in the first half,\n35:3 Comment: or the first half against Getafe, when they were just...\n35:7 Comment: just a bit too good.\n35:8 Comment: Almost terrifying, to be honest, on Tuesday.\n35:12 Comment: Yeah, maybe one of their best 45 minutes of the season.\n35:16 Comment: And we've seen glimpses of that today.\n35:20 Comment: But maybe it's been a lot of matches in quick succession,\n35:23 Comment: a lot of factors adding up for them to not quite have that spark.\n35:29 Comment: Alba keeps it in.\n35:31 Comment: He estimates himself available.\n35:33 Comment: A little bit careless there, and Alba wins it back.\n35:36 Comment: A little fortunate perhaps not to be penalised. Neymar!\n35:40 Comment: Once again, though, there's just five players around Leo Messi.\n35:45 Comment: Alves loses out on that challenge.\n35:49 Comment: And that's good speed from Bebe.\n35:53 Comment: If he looks up, there's players arriving on the far post in the end.\n35:57 Comment: And it's a bit of a problem for Alba.\n35:59 Comment: If he looks up, there's players arriving on the far post in the end.\n36:2 Comment: It's a disappointing cross to Bravo.\n36:6 Comment: And this is now where Cordova can be exposed.\n36:8 Comment: When they attack, and they lose a couple of players,\n36:10 Comment: if Barcelona can make a quick transition,\n36:12 Comment: which it doesn't look like they're going to go for.\n36:14 Comment: They've just slowed it down a wee bit.\n36:16 Comment: It's Neymar. Once again, Iniesta.\n36:19 Comment: Alves looks to go in at the far post.\n36:21 Comment: Iniesta slows it down, gives it back to Neymar.\n36:23 Comment: Messi over the top.\n36:26 Comment: And that's somehow not caught in!\n36:30 Comment: Unbelievable!\n36:32 Comment: It was Neymar with the shot, I think, rather than Suarez.\n36:35 Comment: We could say he was unlucky, but we could also say\n36:38 Comment: Cordova would have been unlucky if it went in.\n36:40 Comment: It looked like a bit of a scuff from Neymar.\n36:42 Comment: Sometimes in that sort of situation, the scuff is the best.\n36:45 Comment: The clean one sometimes goes straight at the keeper.\n36:48 Comment: The team is in a bit of a slump.\n36:50 Comment: The clean one sometimes goes straight at the keeper.\n36:53 Comment: The attack still isn't over, though. It's Messi.\n36:55 Comment: Once again, being hounded by three Cordova players.\n36:58 Comment: And...\n36:59 Comment: So this time the pitch does go in Barca's favour.\n37:2 Comment: As Jordi Alva keeps it in.\n37:6 Comment: And once again, Juan Carlos makes a reasonably comfortable save.\n37:16 Comment: And that's the shot from Iniesta.\n37:21 Comment: Here's the previous attempt. No offside!\n37:27 Comment: I wonder if Suarez's presence just put Neymar off a little bit there.\n37:32 Comment: Could be. Also the defender.\n37:36 Comment: And then that could have gone anywhere.\n37:38 Comment: That's quite well getting off his line, Juan Carlos.\n37:40 Comment: We'll say if he'd have hit that flat on, it might well have gone straight against the keeper's body.\n37:45 Comment: Still.\n37:46 Comment: Another chance for Barcelona. Referees play on that.\n37:50 Comment: I'm sure Suarez is over-impressed by that.\n37:52 Comment: It's with Messi.\n37:59 Comment: Krim gets it out to Alba.\n38:1 Comment: Here's Lionel Messi. A little space for Messi.\n38:3 Comment: To the one-two with Rakitic.\n38:5 Comment: Once again, Barcelona looking for spaces that don't exist.\n38:11 Comment: It's all very narrow.\n38:12 Comment: Rakitic jogs to give a little bit of width.\n38:22 Comment: Once again, Barcelona controlling the ball.\n38:24 Comment: Probably up to 75%, I would say. Possession something along those lines.\n38:28 Comment: Big stats, the goals.\n38:29 Comment: 0-0.\n38:30 Comment: And we're just approaching the 39th minute, or the 40th minute of the match.\n38:34 Comment: We're in the 39th.\n38:37 Comment: What's remarkable here, you don't see the goalkeeper's face.\n38:40 Comment: What's remarkable here, you don't hardly ever see all 22 players so close to each other.\n38:47 Comment: Couldn't quite keep it in there, Dani Alves.\n38:49 Comment: Goal kick.\n38:51 Comment: Absolutely. You could draw a circle on the pitch.\n38:54 Comment: Every single player that's on the pitch is packed in together.\n38:59 Comment: It's almost like schoolboy stuff when they're about five years old,\n39:2 Comment: where everyone's following the ball, no one's staying in their position.\n39:5 Comment: You get the head down and you try and beat everyone.\n39:7 Comment: Exactly.\n39:11 Comment: Juan Carlos made a couple of good saves for Cordoba.\n39:17 Comment: Don't ask me about that.\n39:19 Comment: Was that Crespo, by the way, who's had the slight groin problem?\n39:24 Comment: No, it wasn't.\n39:25 Comment: I was caught looking at the shorts.\n39:27 Comment: I didn't know how I was going to see who it was.\n39:32 Comment: Iniesta.\n39:36 Comment: Messi racketed to Alexey on the first.\n39:39 Comment: Still Ivan Rakitic.\n39:44 Comment: Doing all the defending Cordoba.\n39:45 Comment: You might get the feeling that they're not actually being stretched as quickly\n39:49 Comment: as they might want to be.\n39:51 Comment: Suarez draws the challenge there from Pantic.\n39:56 Comment: Has experience right there from Suarez.\n39:58 Comment: And an experience from the young Pantic.\n40:1 Comment: Just lets him roll into his game.\n40:3 Comment: To be fair, there's not a lot there, but he does just catch his hip, doesn't he?\n40:7 Comment: Suarez is waiting for it, waiting for it.\n40:9 Comment: Get that body in the way, go down.\n40:11 Comment: So we're in either Neymar or Messi territory.\n40:15 Comment: Five minutes to go.\n40:19 Comment: Suspect he's going to be Messi, don't you?\n40:23 Comment: Packing order quite evident when it comes to free kicks.\n40:27 Comment: And he's got a good shot.\n40:29 Comment: Packing order quite evident when it comes to free kicks.\n40:32 Comment: Especially at this time and this situation in the game.\n40:36 Comment: So Luso's got his trousers wound up like he's going to go sort of paddling on the beach.\n40:50 Comment: Well, let's have a look. Neymar and Messi over the free kick.\n40:59 Comment: And it's Messi who takes it off the wall. Corner!\n41:4 Comment: It's not that far across, but I do get the impression that Neymar...\n41:7 Comment: We've seen Neymar take some superb free kicks this season.\n41:10 Comment: It was just a little bit more to his side.\n41:13 Comment: It was more for a right-footed player.\n41:15 Comment: Always easier to get the curl onto the near post for a right-footed player there.\n41:19 Comment: Sixth corner for Barcelona. It's Rakitic again.\n41:29 Comment: Once again, Cordoba defence in numbers.\n41:33 Comment: It's actually a bad pass that's turned out from Alves, but let's not kid ourselves, it was a shot.\n41:37 Comment: Suarez collects.\n41:41 Comment: Good defending with Messi.\n41:45 Comment: Here's Rakitic. Ivan Rakitic puts Barcelona ahead!\n41:51 Comment: Well, it's taken a long, long time and Cordoba have shown real talent.\n41:57 Comment: Cordoba have shown real courage.\n41:59 Comment: But a little moment of magic and yet another Leo Messi assist sets up Ivan Rakitic.\n42:5 Comment: Barcelona lead in Cordoba and how important could that goal be?\n42:11 Comment: Rakitic is fifth of the season.\n42:13 Comment: It's incredible the small details that define things in football.\n42:16 Comment: That crazy half-volley from Alves could have gone absolutely anywhere.\n42:22 Comment: Could have gone miles into the stands.\n42:24 Comment: It turns out it's a pass for Suarez. The play continues.\n42:27 Comment: And that's how Barcelona get their first goal.\n42:29 Comment: Yeah, exactly. Let's not kid ourselves. Alves was shooting, wasn't he?\n42:33 Comment: You've got to ask yourself why he's shooting from there on the bounce.\n42:36 Comment: All that intricate passing that Barcelona have produced.\n42:39 Comment: And it's a mishit pass from Alves which helps open the Cordoba defence up.\n42:44 Comment: Which sort of says a little bit about fortune, good and bad fortune in football.\n42:50 Comment: They're going to have to go push forward a little bit more.\n42:52 Comment: Which is probably good news for Barca.\n42:56 Comment: That's quite similar to Madrid's game midweek against Almeria.\n42:59 Comment: Almeria held out. It seemed like they were going to go into half-time.\n43:2 Comment: Just before half-time, James scored that screamer as well.\n43:5 Comment: One nil and then it's very difficult to keep your head up in the second half.\n43:9 Comment: Then the own goal as well.\n43:13 Comment: Offside flag goes up.\n43:14 Comment: That's just annoying, isn't it? Waiting until somebody touches the ball.\n43:19 Comment: I just don't think it helps anybody.\n43:24 Comment: Incredible. The audacity to try and attempt that from Daniel Alves.\n43:29 Comment: He's obviously got his shooting boots on. He saw he had that volley earlier.\n43:32 Comment: And this is how it comes about. Suarez inside and outside.\n43:35 Comment: Everyone really narrow. And it's just a great pass from Messi.\n43:38 Comment: A great pass from Messi whose assist count is...\n43:42 Comment: To be honest, if you had to decide who was the best striker at the moment,\n43:45 Comment: it's not just the goals, it's the assistances. Or the assists.\n43:50 Comment: And here is Leo Messi.\n43:55 Comment: To Alves. Just a minute of normal time left here in the Nuevo Argent.\n43:59 Comment: It's only going to be a couple of minutes injury time.\n44:1 Comment: Could have had a couple of injuries.\n44:4 Comment: Messi didn't quite control that one.\n44:8 Comment: Córdoba just got to keep it tight now to the break.\n44:11 Comment: Second goal now probably would be fatal to their aspirations.\n44:17 Comment: Staving off the inevitable for another week.\n44:25 Comment: If they lose today, the maximum amount of points they can get is 29.\n44:33 Comment: And of course then we're just waiting to see what happens with Almeria.\n44:37 Comment: Some places they're on 31 and in other places they're on 28.\n44:41 Comment: But I think they still go down a corner because of head-to-head goal difference from Depos.\n44:51 Comment: Having won three games all season, you'd imagine the head-to-head is probably losing out on everyone.\n44:55 Comment: It's probably not good, yeah.\n44:56 Comment: Here's Neymar. Racket it. He's got Alves in a lot of space.\n45:0 Comment: Here is Dani Alves.\n45:3 Comment: Good challenge.\n45:5 Comment: Zfidlou got across strongly there.\n45:10 Comment: And we have two minutes of injury time.\n45:16 Comment: Once again, very active Dani Alves in this game.\n45:19 Comment: He's getting penalised for that challenge there.\n45:21 Comment: Referee just gives a clear calm down gesture.\n45:25 Comment: Let's not forget Alves committed his future to Barcelona the other day, they said on the radio.\n45:32 Comment: He said he's happy here, he doesn't care about the money he gets off at PSG.\n45:36 Comment: He likes living in Barcelona, he likes playing for Barcelona.\n45:38 Comment: He's always seemed happy here, hasn't he? Let's be honest.\n45:44 Comment: He just wants two years, does he? Two or three years rather than...\n46:1 Comment: Juan Carlos, finally beaten on 42 minutes by that Ivan Racket.\n46:6 Comment: It's volley but still some football to be played here.\n46:8 Comment: Barcelona can't settle for 1-0.\n46:10 Comment: Could well mean there were some very nervy Barca fans in the last few minutes if it stayed like that.\n46:16 Comment: They could take it at half-time though.\n46:22 Comment: And you just wonder what looking at them play, if they're trying to conserve a little bit of energy the way for...\n46:28 Comment: You feel they... we're seeing glimpses all over the game.\n46:32 Comment: You just feel sometimes they steady themselves, they just want to win doing the minimum amount.\n46:37 Comment: It's dangerous though, isn't it?\n46:39 Comment: Bebe trying again.\n46:41 Comment: They're buying into quite a lot of important injuries.\n46:48 Comment: It'll be very interesting to see what mind games Pec Guardiola tries against his former players.\n46:53 Comment: It's another chance. Suarez!\n46:55 Comment: 2-0 to Football Club Barcelona.\n46:58 Comment: We said Cordova can't afford to concede one before the break.\n47:3 Comment: Barcelona however will be delighted to have scored one.\n47:7 Comment: Suarez, once again. 15 straight starts for Luis Suarez.\n47:11 Comment: And that is his 14th league goal of the season.\n47:15 Comment: In the 47th minute, the last kick of the half.\n47:21 Comment: It's not been pretty today. Barcelona have made hard work of things.\n47:24 Comment: But Luis Suarez here, from his fantastic pass from Andres Iniesta,\n47:29 Comment: I would say has probably done enough to make those three points.\n47:34 Comment: Almost certainly Catalan put the pressure on Real Madrid.\n47:38 Comment: There's 45 minutes to be played in the second half.\n47:41 Comment: Can Cordova produce a miracle and get back into this?\n47:44 Comment: We'll find out after the break.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: pushing forward. Let's see if Gunino can reach a similar level to the former Sevilla man.\n0:10 Comment: So the way things were standing, Cordova could continue to defend really deep and then look to\n0:16 Comment: try and attack on the break. They created a couple of chances through Bebe, Florent Andone,\n0:22 Comment: Luso got in there, Edimar, the left back or the wing back was doing, was looking decent.\n0:26 Comment: 2-0 though, you've got to step forward a wee bit, especially if your defeat means you are\n0:32 Comment: mathematically relegated. I think we all accept that Cordova are going down whatever happens,\n0:37 Comment: but you don't want to go down just lying down and taking it so to speak. Yeah, that's very\n0:43 Comment: important. I'm sure the fans will expect them to go down, well at least. There's a saying in Spain,\n0:49 Comment: morir matando, which literally means to die killing, which I think we specimens have a go.\n0:54 Comment: Well, that's what they'll expect from them, I suppose. And now Daniel Alves once again.\n0:59 Comment: Leo Messi makes it 3-0. That is a lovely goal from Barcelona and to be fair, we're saying morir\n1:6 Comment: matando. They were already dead on that goal. There was nobody attentive there. Barcelona make\n1:14 Comment: it 3-0. So much for going down with a fight then. One minute and it's just those psychological goals\n1:23 Comment: that always talk about in football. They've received every single one they could today.\n1:27 Comment: Just before the half-time break, two goals and when you come back, think, oh if we get one,\n1:31 Comment: we can get back in it. Nothing. Look at Messi there. When Alves looks up to cross, Messi's not\n1:36 Comment: even in shot. That's a lovely heady goal from Leo Messi. It's 39th of the season. Does that\n1:42 Comment: put him level or ahead of Cristiano? Level, I believe. He was one behind before the game.\n1:48 Comment: Someone won't be smiling at that. Someone who wasn't smiling when Alba Loa scored the other day.\n1:54 Comment: But there's one of Messi's most underrated strengths, the header. As long as he doesn't\n2:0 Comment: have to jump alongside a six-foot central defender. He has actually scored a decent\n2:4 Comment: number of goals with his head. That is his 50th goal of the season in all competitions as well.\n2:10 Comment: A good round of applause for the goal as well from the Córdoba fans. That's to be said, they've\n2:14 Comment: been a good example all season in the Arkhangelsk. But it's funny, I was watching a game earlier\n2:22 Comment: today which was Leicester City against Newcastle in the Premier League and same thing. It was 2-0\n2:26 Comment: to Leicester at half-time. He was first. We were saying, well, what Newcastle need to do now is\n2:29 Comment: keep it tight and see if they can get back into things. Two minutes in and they're 3-0 down.\n2:33 Comment: Same thing. It's a big psychological blow. Basically, Barcelona have scored three goals\n2:40 Comment: in four minutes. It's impossible. It just completely knocks the stuffing out of you. I think it's\n2:47 Comment: mentally, if it's an uphill struggle playing Barcelona, holding on and thinking, oh, we're\n2:52 Comment: right in this, we're going to go into half-time at nil-nil. And then suddenly, one minute later,\n2:56 Comment: you think, what's going on? We're 2-0 down. It's just such a huge mountain to face.\n3:3 Comment: I don't know how these players can pick themselves up for the rest of this game.\n3:7 Comment: Exactly. It is very good news for Barca though, because it does mean they might just be able to,\n3:12 Comment: I don't see they're going to take the foot off the gas drastically, but they do have the slight\n3:17 Comment: question of a Champions League semi-final first leg against Bayern Munich on Wednesday.\n3:26 Comment: Which might be a factor. You try telling Messi, you've got to take him off for that game now.\n3:33 Comment: That's Suarez. There is Leo Messi. Neymar. He's been rotating. He has been offside against\n3:42 Comment: Alba, who just came back from an offside position. One thing Luis Enrique has done recently,\n3:47 Comment: after knowing a couple of players, is he has, how can I put this, rotated his rotations. He sort of\n3:53 Comment: started to mix it around, who is...\n3:56 Comment: Xavi, you were once a boy. You were a boy as well. I think somebody wants a shirt.\n4:1 Comment: He's not asking for it, is he? He's just telling him that you were once a kid,\n4:3 Comment: which Xavi can go and say, yes, that's right.\n4:6 Comment: I think it's fair. I think the implication is clear.\n4:9 Comment: Yeah, obviously.\n4:11 Comment: So, you know, you were once a kid. Make this kid happy.\n4:15 Comment: The kid might not get a shirt, but at least he's appeared on television all over the world.\n4:19 Comment: Xavi 18 when he debuted under the guidance of Luivin Khal.\n4:32 Comment: Remember, there was a program of sort of the day, it's the Monday after he debuted,\n4:37 Comment: that they showed him sort of Xavi coming into the camp now with his shirt on.\n4:41 Comment: And he's been on the pitch for a while.\n4:45 Comment: And it was like, kid comes to make his debut, you know, and 18 years later.\n5:2 Comment: It's a deflection that shot from Neymar.\n5:4 Comment: Neymar sees it out for a corner.\n5:9 Comment: Absolute footballing legend.\n5:11 Comment: 700 appearances, isn't it?\n5:19 Comment: Barca fans in the corner.\n5:22 Comment: It's Rakitic who goes over to take another corner.\n5:24 Comment: Seventh of the game for Barca.\n5:29 Comment: Suarez jumps, Suarez heads over.\n5:31 Comment: Goal kick for Cordova.\n5:35 Comment: It's perhaps been one of the weaker points of Barcelona's performance\n5:38 Comment: that it has been.\n5:39 Comment: Of Barcelona's performance that it has been, the corners from Rakitic.\n5:42 Comment: That one was a little bit better,\n5:43 Comment: but the ones in the first half didn't seem to get past the first man at the front post.\n5:50 Comment: And it wasn't a bad ball, but asking a lot of Suarez to score from that sort of situation.\n5:57 Comment: No, exactly.\n5:57 Comment: It's interesting, Barcelona, people caught us in the early era.\n6:1 Comment: Even in fact, before that, people used to consider that corners was perhaps their weakness.\n6:6 Comment: They didn't score enough from corners.\n6:7 Comment: They'd take short corners.\n6:8 Comment: They wouldn't look to get it in the box.\n6:9 Comment: They didn't have a particularly tall side.\n6:12 Comment: I think only Atletico Madrid have been more effective from set pieces this season than Barca.\n6:19 Comment: But still, you'd think there's tags that some sides can't get rid of.\n6:24 Comment: And although they're the second most effective side,\n6:26 Comment: people will probably still consider them to be weak at set pieces.\n6:33 Comment: No, exactly.\n6:33 Comment: Yes, it's one of those clichés.\n6:38 Comment: There's a booking there for Luzo.\n6:40 Comment: He's catching those kids a little bit late.\n6:53 Comment: Well, that third goal is also done.\n6:55 Comment: It's just calm.\n6:56 Comment: It's killed the atmosphere a bit.\n7:7 Comment: So, it goes across to Piqué.\n7:17 Comment: Well, Barcelona will be absolutely over the moon if they can kill the atmosphere with this.\n7:23 Comment: I'm quite sure they're quite happy.\n7:24 Comment: They're quite happy to just spend the next 35 minutes basically strolling around the archangel.\n7:31 Comment: I think they'll be able to, but the least effort they can make, the happier Luis Enrique will be.\n7:38 Comment: It's a good ball from Alves, who's certainly not strolling.\n7:41 Comment: Once again, Dani Alves looks up and...\n7:44 Comment: FONEL!\n7:46 Comment: Luis Suarez scores his second of the game.\n7:52 Comment: And this could end up being a football score, a rugby score,\n7:56 Comment: an American football score if it carries on like this.\n7:58 Comment: Córdoba, as you were saying, brave, committed, solid in the first half.\n8:6 Comment: Everything they haven't been in the second half, unfortunately.\n8:8 Comment: That third goal doing a lot of damage.\n8:13 Comment: You can see Juan Carlos absolutely going ballistic at his players.\n8:16 Comment: Well, look at the marking there.\n8:18 Comment: Well, you can't because...\n8:18 Comment: It's just like the Messi goal.\n8:20 Comment: He's been left exposed in goal.\n8:23 Comment: Those two goals, no chance whatsoever.\n8:24 Comment: Saying that, it's a fantastic header from Suarez.\n8:27 Comment: Absolutely perfect positioning.\n8:30 Comment: Perfect angle into the corner.\n8:32 Comment: But Juan Carlos, we were saying before, he's probably one of their best players.\n8:36 Comment: Capable of saving almost anything thrown at him.\n8:38 Comment: But he's got no chance.\n8:39 Comment: He's been absolutely left exposed with the Rakitic goal, this goal, the Messi goal again.\n8:45 Comment: Acres of space.\n8:46 Comment: I don't know what the defending is from Córdoba today.\n8:48 Comment: They've got the players, but they just don't have...\n8:50 Comment: Pantic, to be fair, when they've got many numbers,\n8:52 Comment: they've sort of held themselves in there.\n8:54 Comment: But they've basically been tactical errors.\n8:55 Comment: You know, Pantic was just nowhere near Suarez.\n9:1 Comment: Normally, he's meant to be marking.\n9:2 Comment: He wasn't close.\n9:3 Comment: And the same for Suarez, going the first half.\n9:6 Comment: A bit of ball watching.\n9:7 Comment: It just seems...\n9:9 Comment: We commented that several times, didn't we?\n9:10 Comment: They were in a line, ball watching.\n9:12 Comment: And that's frustrating for a manager, because it's not down to...\n9:17 Comment: How you prepare a side.\n9:18 Comment: That's just concentration.\n9:19 Comment: It's lazy, almost.\n9:22 Comment: I don't know, maybe it's fatigue also, where you just can't...\n9:24 Comment: You know, I think it might also explain why Córdoba are in the second division next time.\n9:32 Comment: Next season.\n9:33 Comment: If you saw it, they defended like second division players, unfortunately.\n9:38 Comment: That's a decent cross.\n9:43 Comment: No pressure though on Alves.\n9:58 Comment: And Barcelona.\n9:59 Comment: Just been given a little bit of space.\n10:1 Comment: Córdoba not pressing them that far up the field anymore.\n10:4 Comment: Once again, Alves.\n10:8 Comment: Thinks about putting his foot down.\n10:24 Comment: I said this is a huge...\n10:25 Comment: This is a big win.\n10:27 Comment: Not because Córdoba are the toughest rival Barça have to face,\n10:31 Comment: but because what's happening later on today.\n10:33 Comment: Because Real Madrid have to play away to Sevilla.\n10:36 Comment: And Sevilla in the Sanchez-Piquan Stadium have not lost in all competitions in their last 34 matches.\n10:43 Comment: Now there's three games left for Barcelona after today.\n10:45 Comment: There'll be three games left for Real Madrid.\n10:48 Comment: You have to say, if that gap was four points,\n10:52 Comment: Barcelona have two home games, Real Sociedad,\n10:55 Comment: and the last game of the season.\n10:57 Comment: And they have one away game where they could well drop points,\n11:0 Comment: which is away to Atletico Madrid.\n11:5 Comment: So Barça, they receive next week.\n11:16 Comment: Next week it's Real Sociedad.\n11:18 Comment: Then it's Atletico.\n11:20 Comment: And then Deportivo to finish off.\n11:22 Comment: Deportivo who are in the relegation zone.\n11:24 Comment: In or around the relegation zone.\n11:26 Comment: Here's a chance for Córdoba.\n11:28 Comment: Luso will look to get in there.\n11:33 Comment: It's hard to imagine Barça dropping four points from those games.\n11:36 Comment: You could see them dropping two points or even losing in the Calderon.\n11:42 Comment: It's a little bit sandwiched, but it's enough for a penalty.\n11:45 Comment: But still, the form Barcelona are in,\n11:49 Comment: I can't even see them losing at the Calderon, to be honest.\n11:52 Comment: I just think they've taken their football up.\n11:55 Comment: Two or three notches in this past month.\n11:58 Comment: And also in the Champions League.\n11:59 Comment: I think it's going to take something incredibly special from either of the three sides left\n12:4 Comment: to stop Barcelona from winning the Champions League.\n12:7 Comment: The thing is, if they were level on points with Real Madrid,\n12:9 Comment: imagine say Madrid win today and win their remaining three games,\n12:11 Comment: and Barça drew in the Calderon,\n12:13 Comment: the title would be Real Madrid's because of head-to-head goal difference.\n12:17 Comment: Real Madrid beating Barcelona 3-1 in the Bernabeu earlier this season.\n12:21 Comment: And Barça beating Real Madrid 2-1 in the camp now.\n12:26 Comment: Substitution for Cordoba.\n12:38 Comment: But Luso comes off.\n12:41 Comment: And it's Eking who comes on.\n12:43 Comment: It's only one change left for Cordoba.\n12:51 Comment: The thing about the calendar as well, also in the past weeks,\n12:55 Comment: is that Barcelona played before Madrid for the past two or three games.\n13:0 Comment: And Madrid have seen spectacular performances against Getafe.\n13:4 Comment: Today again, they're going to be in the Champions League.\n13:6 Comment: And they're going to be in the Champions League.\n13:38 Comment: And there's a substitution now from the Cordoba...\n13:44 Comment: ...supporters.\n13:45 Comment: Edimar, very good first half, but that's cut out by...\n13:49 Comment: ...Piqué.\n13:54 Comment: And again.\n14:4 Comment: Again, he's just come on.\n14:6 Comment: And he produces Cordoba's best chance of the game.\n14:9 Comment: Some big effort there from the number five.\n14:12 Comment: And Claudio Bravo...\n14:16 Comment: ...shows he's not just around to do a bit of to visit the Mesquita.\n14:22 Comment: Cracking save.\n14:24 Comment: Good shot from a king for a player who hasn't been on years.\n14:27 Comment: Probably still a little bit cold.\n14:29 Comment: No, I don't think he's cold, it's 83.\n14:33 Comment: Bebe will take the corner.\n14:37 Comment: Iniesta just helps it onwards.\n14:41 Comment: Where Neymar probably would be keen to get on the score sheet.\n14:45 Comment: Gets things moving, it's with Leo Messi.\n14:48 Comment: Suarez.\n14:49 Comment: On a hat-trick of course, let's not forget.\n14:51 Comment: Instead it's Neymar!\n14:55 Comment: Well, he should have got on the score sheet.\n14:59 Comment: Once again Suarez, generous...\n15:3 Comment: ...with his passing.\n15:5 Comment: And Neymar...\n15:7 Comment: ...took his eye off the ball, literally.\n15:8 Comment: Substitution for Barca.\n15:11 Comment: Iniesta gets a nice well-earned break.\n15:13 Comment: They're looking after him out there.\n15:14 Comment: They're just making sure he's not over...\n15:17 Comment: ...over-tired.\n15:18 Comment: And he's replaced by Xavi.\n15:20 Comment: And he's looking better also, Iniesta, in this end too.\n15:23 Comment: The campaign...\n15:25 Comment: ...that was quite famously mentioned throughout the season\n15:27 Comment: that he hadn't provided an assist or a goal.\n15:30 Comment: He's looking better.\n15:32 Comment: We're getting that spark from a couple of seasons ago.\n15:35 Comment: Here's another look at that chance.\n15:37 Comment: Look how Suarez looks up.\n15:39 Comment: Perfect.\n15:40 Comment: Bounces up nicely for him.\n15:42 Comment: Just tries to put it...\n15:44 Comment: That's...\n15:45 Comment: ...that's a bad miss really.\n15:46 Comment: You'd feel a bit disappointed if you missed that in the park on Saturday afternoon.\n15:51 Comment: And he hung over.\n15:53 Comment: He's missed two already today, let's not forget the first half.\n15:55 Comment: He also had that early volley from the cross from Alves.\n15:58 Comment: So another substitution for Barca by the way.\n16:0 Comment: They've put Mateu for...\n16:1 Comment: Mateu for Macerano.\n16:3 Comment: Whereas Fedde has come on for Bebego.\n16:13 Comment: So Kordub have used their full quota...\n16:16 Comment: ...of substitutions already.\n16:20 Comment: All this does, the Neymar misses, is that...\n16:22 Comment: ...if Luis Enrique wants to throw on...\n16:24 Comment: ...Pedro...\n16:25 Comment: ...at some stage...\n16:28 Comment: ...Neymar's not going to be happy about getting off because he's...\n16:31 Comment: ...going to be thinking about those two goals he's missed.\n16:34 Comment: Exactly.\n16:36 Comment: That was Flory looking to...\n16:39 Comment: ...charge into the Barcelona penalty area.\n16:44 Comment: Gets a corner.\n16:47 Comment: So Pique can't believe it.\n16:50 Comment: It's always, I think, harder for a central defender to come in cold.\n16:54 Comment: He's got to adapt to the pace of the game.\n16:58 Comment: It's a decent corner as well, Pique.\n17:5 Comment: Alba slices that one out.\n17:17 Comment: Another decent ball in there but Bravo...\n17:20 Comment: ...makes a claim.\n17:28 Comment: I think Neymar thought he was going to get a whistle.\n17:31 Comment: I think so, otherwise he might have gone on a bit more towards...\n17:35 Comment: To be fair, he did look like he used a little bit too much...\n17:38 Comment: ...of the shoulder barging into the defender.\n17:40 Comment: I thought he was going to give it the left foot to be honest.\n17:57 Comment: So Barcelona just slowing things down.\n18:14 Comment: Gerard Pique taking his time, no need to hurry.\n18:18 Comment: 63 minutes gone, Barcelona killing this game off.\n18:23 Comment: In double quick time in this second half.\n18:24 Comment: Further goals from Leo Messi and Luis Suarez.\n18:29 Comment: Putting them 4-0 up against Córdoba who will be appearing in the second division next season.\n18:35 Comment: No, we don't know who's going to come up yet.\n18:37 Comment: It's all very tight in the battle for promotion.\n18:39 Comment: Real Betis look like they're probably...\n18:42 Comment: Betis are looking to go back, who also wear green and white stripes.\n18:44 Comment: And are also under Lithuania.\n18:46 Comment: Good to see Betis.\n18:48 Comment: But while saying that, Betis are back.\n18:50 Comment: There's still a question of those issues of the games against Valladolid and Osasuna last season.\n18:54 Comment: Which may have to be investigated.\n18:58 Comment: Although I don't think that would probably affect Betis as a club.\n19:2 Comment: It might affect a couple of individual players.\n19:8 Comment: But never seems there's going to be a sentence on any of those things.\n19:11 Comment: It's been ongoing for quite a few years now, other games of course.\n19:17 Comment: Suarez looks to stab that one through.\n19:19 Comment: I think in this case there is going to have to be.\n19:21 Comment: Certainly in the case of the Zaragoza-Levante match.\n19:25 Comment: From 2013?\n19:32 Comment: Or maybe before. I think Ander Herrera was at Zaragoza.\n19:36 Comment: Yeah, you're right. So it must have been four years ago.\n19:47 Comment: Another corner for Barca. Rakitic takes it.\n19:49 Comment: Pique makes it 5-0.\n19:52 Comment: As we say, Barca very affected from set pieces. Gerard Pique celebrates.\n20:0 Comment: Join the sunshine.\n20:2 Comment: And Barcelona, after finding it hard work for 42 minutes, are really now on the downhill stretch.\n20:10 Comment: I think Juan Carlos is hating a lot of his teammates.\n20:13 Comment: You can see his face just moving his head from side to side.\n20:18 Comment: Again, it's a free header in the box.\n20:21 Comment: Marqui is not outstanding.\n20:23 Comment: It's ball watching again. You can see he's not even looking where Pique is.\n20:26 Comment: He's looking at the ball.\n20:28 Comment: And if you're looking at the ball, you'd imagine you're going to judge the flight of the ball correctly.\n20:32 Comment: He hasn't even done that. He hasn't judged either thing.\n20:34 Comment: It's Inigo in this case. It's just a basic defensive error.\n20:39 Comment: So 5-0 here in the Nuevo Arc Angel.\n20:48 Comment: It's quite interesting. You saw in the background when that goal came out on the big boards in the stadium,\n20:55 Comment: it said, no one gives up here.\n20:58 Comment: I think. It came straight after the goal.\n21:0 Comment: Interesting. The difference obviously, we'd have counted in Barcelona.\n21:3 Comment: In Spain, it's head-to-head goal difference if you level on points.\n21:6 Comment: If it was in England, the same as in England and in most leagues, Barcelona would have a massive advantage.\n21:13 Comment: That goal gives them a goal difference of plus 83.\n21:20 Comment: Real Madrid's goal difference is plus 72.\n21:23 Comment: So if it were England, Barcelona would be able to afford to draw one of their three games.\n21:29 Comment: But obviously it isn't.\n21:31 Comment: And the rules is the rules.\n21:33 Comment: It'd be interesting to see if that goal difference, where that goal difference ranks amongst the best goal differences in the history of the league.\n21:40 Comment: It's plus 80. Was it 82 or 83?\n21:41 Comment: It's plus 83 at the moment.\n21:44 Comment: It's not a bad figure.\n21:48 Comment: Most teams don't score 83 goals.\n21:56 Comment: So Barcelona with 25 minutes to go, just about.\n22:1 Comment: Lead 5-0 away to Córdoba, who were put up a solid fight until half-time and in the second half haven't.\n22:8 Comment: Whereas Barca, that second goal from Lionel Messi just after the break was clearly important in destroying any chance Córdoba had of getting back into this if they had much.\n22:20 Comment: Obviously Suárez making it 4-0 after 52 and now a peak after 65.\n22:25 Comment: Here's Lionel Messi.\n22:27 Comment: Just wide.\n22:31 Comment: Juan Carlos just gave up on that shot.\n22:32 Comment: What was interesting in that run, you see Suárez dragging the defence across and telling Neymar, give it to Messi, I'm doing the run, I'm just dragging the players away.\n22:40 Comment: He took the whole Córdoba defence with him.\n22:42 Comment: The thing is, as a Trident, it's hard.\n22:44 Comment: Obviously Real Madrid are fantastic attacking trio when they work as Ronaldo, Benzema and Bale.\n22:49 Comment: But these three just seem to have a slight, and they're all spectacular.\n22:54 Comment: But I think the way that Bale and Ronaldo play, there's not that same almost telepathy as you get with Suárez and Messi.\n23:2 Comment: Another start that's going to get rest. It's Rakitic coming off.\n23:7 Comment: And he's going to be hit by Pedro.\n23:9 Comment: That's not what you want when you're Córdoba, you're 5-0 down.\n23:11 Comment: And they bring another striker.\n23:13 Comment: And they take off Rakitic and they bring on a striker.\n23:16 Comment: So that's the three substitutions made, isn't it?\n23:19 Comment: We've had Mateu on for Maturano, we've had Xabi on for Iniesta and we've got Pedro on for Rakitic.\n23:24 Comment: And then Busquets is over the moon.\n23:27 Comment: It's talking that they want four substitutes next season.\n23:30 Comment: Oh yeah?\n23:32 Comment: I think I've seen it as well.\n23:34 Comment: Which, I can see the logic in it.\n23:37 Comment: Because especially in weeks where you've got three matches in a week, you do see teams picking up muscle injuries in the second game, a couple more in the third.\n23:47 Comment: Maybe there's an option to hang on to say, here's a chance for Córdoba.\n23:54 Comment: But unfortunately Fede hits that one over the bar.\n23:57 Comment: The thing about the substitutions though is, with three substitutions, a manager has a greater input in what happens in a side's performance.\n24:6 Comment: He has to gamble, he has to take the risk.\n24:8 Comment: You're not obliged to get it right.\n24:10 Comment: You're not obliged to make them. But certainly in weeks where you've got three matches, I think the second would be a help perhaps.\n24:17 Comment: Think how many players do pick up a few little niggling muscle injuries this week and have had the chance to be rotated a wee bit more.\n24:23 Comment: You know, for example.\n24:37 Comment: And also going back to that trident.\n24:41 Comment: Conversation about which trident is better, comparisons, etc, etc.\n24:46 Comment: I think Bale and Ronaldo, the problem is they're both originally wingers.\n24:50 Comment: So.\n24:52 Comment: Hang on a second.\n24:54 Comment: Suárez.\n24:56 Comment: So it's turning into a little bit of a turkey shoot this at the moment in the Nuevo Arc Angel.\n25:1 Comment: Córdoba dead on the feet.\n25:5 Comment: Barcelona without really stepping on the accelerator.\n25:9 Comment: Just see that there's more goals there for the taking.\n25:11 Comment: Again, the simplest of runs. Splits two defenders apart.\n25:16 Comment: And that finish reminded me it looks a little bit like the Suárez goal he scored against England at the World Cup.\n25:21 Comment: Not to bring back any heartache for anyone, but.\n25:25 Comment: Had it assumed by then 18 shots.\n25:34 Comment: From Barca four for Córdoba.\n25:45 Comment: That's nice work from Fidel.\n25:54 Comment: Very good from Córdoba.\n25:55 Comment: Can they get a consolation goal?\n25:59 Comment: And Donnie.\n26:1 Comment: Couldn't hit the target.\n26:2 Comment: Once again, nice weather from Fidel.\n26:5 Comment: Shame there for Andon.\n26:6 Comment: It's the control that let him down.\n26:8 Comment: Is it took him?\n26:10 Comment: Just a bit wide.\n26:11 Comment: It's the offside.\n26:13 Comment: And the ball doesn't run through either.\n26:22 Comment: Changed Mattel nicely.\n26:37 Comment: Barca on him again.\n26:42 Comment: Mattel.\n26:43 Comment: Jeremy Mattel was quite a decent first season at Barcelona.\n26:48 Comment: Gerard Piqué.\n26:53 Comment: Scored with Barca's fifth.\n26:59 Comment: And Jordi Alba couldn't quite get to that one.\n27:5 Comment: Problem with Mattel is his season's slightly been tainted by\n27:9 Comment: those smoking photographs of him smoking and it seems\n27:14 Comment: people are quicker to instead of\n27:17 Comment: talk about his how his footballing has been his performances.\n27:20 Comment: They like to always mention.\n27:22 Comment: Well, you know, he's a smoker.\n27:23 Comment: He's a chain smoker.\n27:25 Comment: They got caught one photograph.\n27:26 Comment: I can't remember where it was in Paris or something.\n27:29 Comment: Smoking with a goal.\n27:31 Comment: Jordi Alba.\n27:33 Comment: Another decent cross.\n27:46 Comment: Piqué was battling away that possibly called it was best\n27:48 Comment: effort of the game.\n27:49 Comment: Shot which he saw parried away by Claudio Bravo.\n27:56 Comment: And it's a goal.\n27:57 Comment: Claudio Bravo.\n28:1 Comment: Just ticking away comfortably for Barcelona.\n28:13 Comment: Cordova coach that Jose Antonio Romero.\n28:17 Comment: Probably when he took over from the B team moved up from the B\n28:20 Comment: team after Dukic is sacking.\n28:22 Comment: It was looking the writing was very much on the wall, wasn't it?\n28:26 Comment: Since since the last few games is merely been colored in.\n28:30 Comment: Also, the chairman didn't want to spend any money on a new\n28:32 Comment: coach because he knew what was going to happen.\n28:35 Comment: The problem was he didn't spend any money on the new players\n28:37 Comment: when they were promoted.\n28:40 Comment: Really relying just on\n28:42 Comment: castoffs and loan players that the squad isn't really much\n28:44 Comment: stronger than the one.\n28:45 Comment: I don't think it is any stronger than the one that was promoted\n28:48 Comment: from the from the second division.\n28:50 Comment: So via the playoffs,\n28:52 Comment: which is a huge disadvantage because the playoffs in Spain\n28:56 Comment: start late\n28:58 Comment: and finish later and give teams\n29:1 Comment: if you win, if you come up with a playoff, even more so than in\n29:3 Comment: England, you have so little time. Hang on a second\n29:6 Comment: to prepare for the full season because you can't actually start\n29:8 Comment: making signings until you're up.\n29:11 Comment: By the time you're up, it's back in the June.\n29:17 Comment: Well, if we have to go on about\n29:20 Comment: things that are not right\n29:22 Comment: in terms of the federation in the league, it could be getting\n29:24 Comment: on for half an hour.\n29:26 Comment: It's a huge, huge setback for teams that have come up for the\n29:29 Comment: for the playoffs.\n29:30 Comment: PK fancies his chances again, doesn't he?\n29:35 Comment: A little stroll forward there.\n29:36 Comment: The Barcelona centre defenders.\n29:37 Comment: One of the good pieces of news that came out yesterday is the\n29:41 Comment: the government has passed a decree, which means that there\n29:44 Comment: will now be\n29:47 Comment: rather than each club negotiating their own TV deals, there'll be\n29:50 Comment: a unified deal.\n29:52 Comment: From from not next season, the season after\n29:55 Comment: the past, and it will still get the same amount, but it should\n29:58 Comment: mean everybody else getting proportionally a bit more as\n30:1 Comment: well.\n30:3 Comment: Which has been a long time in the waiting should have happened\n30:6 Comment: a long time ago.\n30:7 Comment: I think the international rights are all going to be evenly\n30:9 Comment: distributed.\n30:10 Comment: So more in the line of the Premier League, although with\n30:13 Comment: Barcelona, Real Madrid still guaranteed more.\n30:18 Comment: What it has done, the\n30:20 Comment: inequality in Spanish football\n30:23 Comment: has meant I think the coaching standards have had\n30:26 Comment: they're probably above, I'd say, the whole of Europe.\n30:29 Comment: I think the coaching standards in Spain are top notch.\n30:32 Comment: Young players.\n30:33 Comment: I was in just in San Sebastián on Monday looking at Real\n30:38 Comment: Sociedad and their youth system is outstanding.\n30:42 Comment: Outstanding.\n30:43 Comment: Fantastic setting.\n30:45 Comment: Lovely place.\n30:46 Comment: You have to sort of learn where to play football or go and\n30:49 Comment: train every day in Zubieta where Real Sociedad train, you'd\n30:52 Comment: have to say.\n30:53 Comment: The worst places in the world to work and just a place which\n30:56 Comment: would make you want to play football every day.\n30:58 Comment: It's really, really good.\n31:0 Comment: And Real Sociedad team have had financial problems, got six\n31:3 Comment: best most used productive youth system in La Liga, which has\n31:7 Comment: been reflected, you know, with the production of players such\n31:10 Comment: as last couple of seasons, Griezmann, Iaramendi, obviously\n31:15 Comment: Stalwarts, Bergara, Xavi Prieto, Aguirreche.\n31:19 Comment: You know, you could easily find a Real Sociedad team made up\n31:24 Comment: almost entirely of youth team players.\n31:27 Comment: And it's also an incentive for the youth team player who knows\n31:30 Comment: he's going to get a chance to make the leap, which in England\n31:33 Comment: there was an article the other day about players who won the\n31:36 Comment: FA Youth Cup with Chelsea and none of them take the next step\n31:40 Comment: onto the first teams.\n31:41 Comment: It's impossible for them to crack through.\n31:43 Comment: There's a couple of them getting games in the championship.\n31:46 Comment: Patrick Bamford, the striker on loan at Middlesbrough, looking\n31:49 Comment: a very good bet.\n31:50 Comment: Whether he'll get the chance at Chelsea next year, whether he\n31:52 Comment: might stay on loan at Middlesbrough, is perhaps another\n31:55 Comment: moot point.\n31:56 Comment: It will depend.\n31:57 Comment: Pedro Messi looks to reproduce a carbon copy of his first goal.\n32:4 Comment: So far his only goal doesn't quite hit the target.\n32:9 Comment: Surprisingly.\n32:11 Comment: A player who knows how to have the ball is improved.\n32:13 Comment: Once again, lovely ball in.\n32:15 Comment: Messi running in from deep.\n32:17 Comment: It's Pedro with the cross.\n32:19 Comment: And you've got to ask the same question as in every goal.\n32:21 Comment: Who's following Messi?\n32:23 Comment: It's not as if it's, you know, John from down the road.\n32:26 Comment: It's Messi.\n32:27 Comment: I think he just sees the defender looming a bit big in the\n32:29 Comment: headlights there.\n32:36 Comment: And directs that header wide.\n32:41 Comment: Once again, Dani Alves.\n33:7 Comment: Pedro.\n33:9 Comment: Been linked to several clubs in England in recent weeks.\n33:12 Comment: Arsenal.\n33:14 Comment: Certainly one of them, I think.\n33:16 Comment: Pedro is exactly what Arsenal need right now.\n33:25 Comment: What's for sure is wherever he goes, he'll be a very good\n33:28 Comment: addition to that club.\n33:30 Comment: Very good signing.\n33:34 Comment: Alves once again just given basically the cup blanche to\n33:37 Comment: walk Stoel forward down that touchline.\n33:57 Comment: Alba just looking a little bit.\n34:1 Comment: Hamstring is just feeling there.\n34:2 Comment: To be fair, the way the game is, even though Barca have\n34:5 Comment: taken made the three substitutions, I can't see.\n34:7 Comment: Hang on a second.\n34:8 Comment: It's Pedro Suarez.\n34:11 Comment: Neymar, Messi.\n34:12 Comment: Someone scored six nil to Barcelona.\n34:15 Comment: Quite sure who put that one in the back of the net at the end.\n34:19 Comment: Another thing that's really good thing to see is that they're\n34:21 Comment: all.\n34:22 Comment: The great thing to see there is that all congratulating each\n34:25 Comment: other no matter who scored.\n34:27 Comment: There's someone looking a little bit miffed there.\n34:29 Comment: You can imagine a couple of newspapers called Marco and us\n34:32 Comment: highlighting it, but they've all celebrated it together.\n34:35 Comment: We're giving it to Messi.\n34:37 Comment: It's his 40th league goal of the season.\n34:39 Comment: Arsenal lead by six goals to nil.\n34:41 Comment: Lovely work from Pedro.\n34:45 Comment: Just really well.\n34:46 Comment: There he's looking to get the pass.\n34:48 Comment: It's probably a penalty on Suarez because I think I just pushes\n34:51 Comment: him over.\n34:52 Comment: But rather than penalty red card, I think the goal is much\n34:55 Comment: better.\n34:56 Comment: They see Gornino no attempt to follow Pedro.\n34:59 Comment: The nice thing to see is Pedro is a player who needs goals for\n35:2 Comment: his confidence, and we've seen already a couple of times this\n35:5 Comment: season when he has had the chance to score.\n35:7 Comment: He's provided the assist for a teammate.\n35:10 Comment: Yeah, he's got the team's interests at heart.\n35:13 Comment: And that is brilliant to see Messi and Neymar both battling\n35:16 Comment: for that goal.\n35:17 Comment: But Neymar, well, sportingly happy to see Messi and Gornino\n35:22 Comment: Possibly the easiest goal he's scored this season.\n35:28 Comment: Well, especially if you keep in mind his biggest opponent to\n35:31 Comment: score the goal was Neymar and not a defender.\n35:35 Comment: Iasked anybody.\n35:37 Comment: I do think he'd have found many takers the six NL.\n35:41 Comment: Not at all.\n35:44 Comment: But if you know, you see in the second half, maybe the half\n35:47 Comment: person who knows this player came to help a defensive end.\n35:52 Comment: Then your chances of having it have to fly out of this house\n35:55 Comment: long distance will just become a little more immediate.\n35:58 Comment: Corrections will be issue.\n35:59 Comment: Maybe you can score what they ask you to score.\n36:1 Comment: Who knows.\n36:2 Comment: Ah, deceptive haste to that end.\n36:3 Comment: Maybe you would have said a bit more.\n36:5 Comment: I think if you'd seen the second half to be fair, it would have been a no contest, wouldn't it?\n36:9 Comment: First half Coda were fine. Worked really hard, showed commitment, showed courage, made some basic defensive errors but compensated for it by just sheer commitment.\n36:18 Comment: In the second half, the wheels have very much come off.\n36:21 Comment: I'm sure most of these players...\n36:30 Comment: Whips that one across there Neymar, just a little bit too much on it.\n36:33 Comment: Could have taken Suarez's head off if he was.\n36:36 Comment: The great thing is they're all looking to help each other. They're not all going for glory.\n36:44 Comment: He has a little chuckle about it.\n37:14 Comment: Jordi Alba.\n37:28 Comment: Xavi.\n37:44 Comment: Surely players if the referee could blow the final whistle now.\n37:59 Comment: Thank you very much.\n38:0 Comment: Massive weight off their shoulders.\n38:3 Comment: I don't know how you can get up to play these final seven minutes when you're 6-0 down, you're getting battered.\n38:12 Comment: You're going down.\n38:19 Comment: There's Neymar.\n38:22 Comment: Penalty.\n38:25 Comment: I'm sure that wasn't an easy decision as in it was a clear penalty for the referees.\n38:30 Comment: It's got to be almost heartbreaking at 6-0 to say, oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, but I've got to give this penalty.\n38:38 Comment: You've clearly caught him.\n38:41 Comment: Just adding insult to injury.\n38:43 Comment: Clumsy defendant.\n38:45 Comment: Yep.\n38:46 Comment: No one will take it.\n38:54 Comment: Yeah, it is pretty clear penalty to be brutally honest.\n38:57 Comment: Two times as well.\n38:59 Comment: Oh, and he'll have his chance to score at least.\n39:17 Comment: Cool penalty, sort of penalty without too much pressure.\n39:23 Comment: And Barcelete by seven goals to nil.\n39:26 Comment: Scoring five goals in the second half and poor Mr. Romero still trying to encourage the troops, but I suspect deep inside he also wants this game to be over.\n39:37 Comment: Neymar has also scored as many goals this season as the entire Cordoba team.\n39:43 Comment: 21.\n39:45 Comment: That's a very tough statistic to have one player score as many goals as your whole side in the season.\n39:55 Comment: And you felt well given the game Neymar's had today, he's probably going to miss that one.\n40:1 Comment: But calm as you like, cool and collected.\n40:4 Comment: Barca in the last two league games has got 13 goals without reply.\n40:26 Comment: And another thing that makes it even harder for Cordoba in these five minutes, Barca don't take the foot off the gas at all.\n40:33 Comment: They all want to score goals.\n40:34 Comment: They just enjoy playing attacking football, free-flowing football.\n40:40 Comment: And if they've got five minutes left, instead of putting the game to bed and sleeping it, they want more goals.\n40:47 Comment: But to be fair, they're doing it.\n40:48 Comment: But I think it's the great news for Barca is they're doing it without actually expending too much energy.\n40:53 Comment: They're very, very comfortable.\n41:5 Comment: It's a bit shabby.\n41:7 Comment: I mean, look at the game.\n41:8 Comment: I know it's hot, but it is basically not much more than a walking pace.\n41:16 Comment: It does look a bit like a training session.\n41:22 Comment: It must be painful for the Cordoba players because I'm sure they are really hurting at this.\n41:28 Comment: The pride of 7-0 defeat has always got to be at home.\n41:32 Comment: 7-0 at home, exactly.\n41:37 Comment: And I suppose they might have had some expectations after really pushing Real Madrid at home.\n41:42 Comment: They probably looked at that game and thought, we've got what it takes to maybe give these sorts of teams a scare.\n41:49 Comment: 7-0.\n41:51 Comment: At least make life a little bit uncomfy.\n41:54 Comment: This isn't particularly uncomfy.\n41:56 Comment: 69% for Barca.\n42:5 Comment: Jordi Alba.\n42:12 Comment: Now offside, 8-0 to Barcelona.\n42:15 Comment: Luis Suarez completes his hat-trick.\n42:19 Comment: Oh, that.\n42:20 Comment: So cruel.\n42:21 Comment: So, so cruel.\n42:23 Comment: It almost hurts to see how that shot deflects and just fools the Suarez.\n42:29 Comment: Everything that could have gone wrong has gone wrong.\n42:32 Comment: That deflection could have gone anywhere.\n42:34 Comment: It just sits perfectly to Suarez.\n42:38 Comment: No offside.\n42:43 Comment: So cruel.\n42:46 Comment: I find it difficult to watch a side just go into the silence in the stadium after that ball went in.\n42:53 Comment: Almost like, that can't be, can it?\n42:56 Comment: 8-0.\n42:58 Comment: To be fair, they've stayed to the end, the fans, haven't they?\n43:0 Comment: Maybe they've stayed to have a...\n43:5 Comment: It looks like they're going to give them a piece of what they think they are.\n43:8 Comment: Might be a little bit of a bronca, as they say in Spain.\n43:13 Comment: I hope the referee doesn't add too much injury time.\n43:15 Comment: It's one of those, one minute, thank you very much.\n43:19 Comment: I'm quite sure that the 90th minute almost all the way through the game,\n43:23 Comment: the 90th minute almost all the way through the game,\n43:25 Comment: there's no need to prolong this agony for Córdoba anymore.\n43:46 Comment: There you see it in.\n43:48 Comment: Black and white, or in blue and white in this case.\n43:51 Comment: Neymar, 5th minute, well, there you've seen it.\n43:54 Comment: Basically, the highlights, Hat-trick from Suárez, 2 for Leo Messi, Piqué.\n44:4 Comment: Neymar, Rakitic, which is probably the most important goal of the game.\n44:10 Comment: Yeah, because of when it came as well, just before half-time.\n44:22 Comment: This always feels like a bully at school, just picking on the weak little child.\n44:28 Comment: And it's not as if Barcelona are...\n44:31 Comment: They're not being cocky, they're not showboating.\n44:34 Comment: It's not showboating.\n44:35 Comment: There's none of those little backheels on stepovers, it's just serious, it's just doing our job.\n44:39 Comment: And it's showing in that way, they're actually respecting their rivals.\n44:41 Comment: There's none of that, trying to be a little bit too clever.\n44:43 Comment: It's just incredible superiority, it's a different level, they're on two complete different levels.\n44:49 Comment: They're extremely superior to Córdoba, and you just see the players playing it about in quick passes.\n44:55 Comment: And it's just one of those agonising moments, which you've said, it looks like a second division side.\n    \n\n    #######TASK \n    Provide a factually correct and detailed textual description of the

    "summary": "In a lopsided affair, Cordoba faced off against Barcelona at the Nuevo Arcangel Stadium. The match concluded with a resounding 8-0 victory for Barcelona, illustrating the stark difference in class and form between the two sides. From the opening whistle to the final goal, the showdown was characterized by exquisite play from Barcelona and an unfortunate lack of resilience from a soon-to-be-relegated Cordoba team.\n\nThe match began with some early dominance from Barcelona as they quickly settled into their rhythm. The first real opportunity arose when Dani Alves whipped a ball into the penalty area, only for Neymar to volley over the bar from a promising position, just eight yards out. It was an early warning sign from Barcelona and highlighted Neymar's intent to be a central figure in this match. Cordoba set up with five defenders, aiming to thwart Barcelona's attacking threats, but even this setup did not prevent Neymar from getting this opportunity.\n\nCordoba, despite finding themselves on the back foot, attempted to show some offensive spark. Florian Andone had a chance to put them in the lead, but his header sailed over the bar, reflecting the team's struggles in the attacking third throughout the season. Soon enough, Barcelona capitalized on Cordoba's vulnerabilities. Andres Iniesta, Sergio Busquets, and Lionel Messi exhibited brilliant one-touch football, waiting patiently for the right openings.\n\nLionel Messi, celebrating the 10th anniversary of his first goal for Barcelona, was instrumental as always. Frustration started to manifest amongst the Cordoba defense, as they struggled to keep the tireless waves of Barcelona attacks at bay. Nevertheless, Cordoba showed signs of promise in patches, particularly through Edimar and Bebe who attempted to create opportunities down the left flank but were often outmatched by Barcelona's tactical discipline and individual talent.\n\nAs the game approached the end of the first half, Barcelona cranked up the pressure. Rakitic put in a corner kick that momentarily relieved Cordoba's defense, but the danger was incessant. Finally, Barcelona's relentless pressure bore fruit. In the 42nd minute, a bit of good fortune and excellent positioning culminated in Ivan Rakitic scoring the opening goal with a stunning volley. Barcelona's lead was no less than they deserved, having dictated play with their swift and precise passing.\n\nCordoba was evidently rattled by conceding so close to halftime, and Barcelona wasted little time in capitalizing further. Just before the whistle for the midway point, Luis Suarez found himself on the scoresheet, effectively putting the game beyond Cordoba's reach. Andres Iniesta delivered a fantastic pass, and Suarez, with his predatory instincts, doubled Barcelona's advantage. In this single moment, Barcelona showcased why they are a force to be reckoned with - clinical finishing from Suarez and an astute pass from Iniesta.\n\nAt halftime, Cordoba found themselves in a perilous position, failing to manage even a single shot on target. Barcelona, meanwhile, were comfortably cruising, showing no signs of relenting in the second half.\n\nLuis Enrique, contemplating his mid-week Champions League semifinal against Bayern Munich, might have expected a tempered performance in the second half. However, Barcelona came out with equal, if not greater, intensity. Within minutes of the restart, Lionel Messi rose unchallenged to head home a Dani Alves cross, extending Barcelona’s lead to three goals. This was Messi's 39th league goal of the season, equalling Cristiano Ronaldo’s tally and adding another feather to his illustrious cap.\n\nCordoba’s resolve seemed utterly broken after conceding this early second-half goal. It was a classic example of the devastating psychological impact that quick succession goals can have on a team’s morale. As the saying goes, \"morir matando\" – to die killing – did not quite describe Cordoba’s fate as Barcelona continued their incessant march forward.\n\nAs the pace of the game intensified, Dani Alves was a constant threat down the right flank, delivering cross after cross into the Cordoba box. In the 53rd minute, his persistence paid off as his pinpoint delivery found Luis Suarez. The Uruguayan striker made no mistake, expertly guiding the header into the net, making it 4-0. Juan Carlos, Cordoba's beleaguered goalkeeper, could do nothing but despair as his defense was left in tatters.\n\nBarcelona's offensive juggernaut showed no signs of slowing down. Ten minutes later, after a corner taken by Rakitic, Gerard Pique headed in Barcelona’s fifth goal. With Cordoba’s backline now all but collapsed, it was merely a matter of how many more Barcelona would score. Pique’s goal underlined the defensive frailties and the inability of Cordoba to deal with set-pieces effectively.\n\nAs the game wore on, Neymar, who had already missed a couple of golden opportunities, redeemed himself by converting a penalty which made it 7-0. The Brazilian was a lively presence, running at defenders with his usual swagger but his frustration at missing several opportunities was evident. Nevertheless, his goal was a small consolation for his efforts throughout the match.\n\nPedro, coming off the bench, added to the attacking threat, providing another dimension to Barcelona’s forward play. His cross in the 88th minute allowed Suarez to complete his hat-trick with a calm finish. Suarez’s third goal underscored his clinical finishing and relentless work rate, ensuring a memorable outing for the Uruguayan.\n\nBarcelona’s dominance was absolute, suffocating Cordoba’s any hope of a comeback. The game ended with an emphatic 8-0 scoreline, a result that speaks volumes about the chasm between the two sides. It’s worth noting that Cordoba, after putting up a spirited first-half performance, capitulated entirely in the second, possibly due to a combination of exhaustion and low morale. \n\nTaking stock of the entire match, Cordoba’s defense was repeatedly found ball-watching, allowing Barcelona to dictate terms. Despite early attempts to contain the Catalans, Cordoba failed to muster meaningful resistance. Their relegation was sealed not just by this defeat but also by the systemic issues that plagued their campaign all season long.\n\nFor Barcelona, this win was another step towards clinching the La Liga title. The lethal combination of Messi, Suarez, and Neymar up front continues to torment defenses, and their collective effort in this match ensured Barcelona extended their lead at the top of the table, even if temporarily. Dani Alves showcased his attacking prowess, while the midfield trio of Busquets, Rakitic, and Iniesta orchestrated play with their typical precision and poise.\n\nLooking ahead, Barcelona’s focus will undoubtedly shift towards their imminent clash against Bayern Munich. The confidence from this resounding victory will serve them well, though Luis Enrique will hope his team conserves enough energy for the intense European encounter. Cordoba, left to rue their disastrous second half, must now prepare for life in the second tier, reflecting on a season that promised much but delivered little.\n\nIn sum, Barcelona’s virtuoso performance at the Nuevo Arcangel was a testament to their supremacy in La Liga, while Cordoba's capitulation mirrored their struggles and made their impending relegation an unmistakable reality."
