And Kameni saves it well.\n28:5 Comment: And well chicharito. Isco fought for the ball on the left wing and managed to get the pass with the ball.\n28:10 Comment: Isco is short. Marcelo to play the ball over Álvaro Arbeloa.\n28:15 Comment: The lower Arbeloa. He puts pressure on Samu Castillejo. He delays the ball for Pepe.\n28:19 Comment: It's already over in Rabaz.\n28:21 Comment: Surrounded by the opposite.

    "summary": "Real Madrid faced off against Málaga in an encounter that saw an eventual victory for the Madridistas, with the final scoreline reading 3-1 in favor of the home side. The match took place at the Santiago Bernabéu, where Real Madrid continued their chase in the league standing, seeking to keep the pressure on the top teams.\n\n**First Half:**\n\nThe match kicked off with Málaga taking the initiative right from the first whistle. They executed a long ball strategy aiming for Juanmi, but Real Madrid's defense, led by Pepe and Sergio Ramos, responded well. The opening few minutes saw Real Madrid attempting to control possession and manage the early aggression from Málaga. \n\nLuka Modric, providing a creative presence in midfield, linked up with Marcelo and Isco effectively. However, an early concern arose when Gareth Bale went down clutching his left ankle. Despite the early minutes providing no clearer goal threat, the injury to Bale seemed to rattle the Madrid camp. Bale attempted to continue but eventually had to be substituted off early in the 4th minute, with Chicharito Hernández coming on in his place.\n\nMálaga, despite their vigor and attempts to disrupt Madrid's plans, found themselves often curtailed by the defensive solidity of Ramos and Pepe. Real Madrid assumed control of the ball, moving it across the pitch as they saw fit. Marcelo and Ronaldo particularly made concerted efforts to penetrate Málaga’s lines, but found it tough to break past a compact defense.\n\nDespite dominating possession, the first real breakthrough for Real Madrid came through a set-piece situation. In the 23rd minute, Cristiano Ronaldo delivered a free-kick into the box, finding Sergio Ramos who made no mistake and put Madrid ahead with a left-footed finish past Kameni, making it 1-0.\n\nRonaldo constantly tried to take control, and his individual skills were on full display, executing audacious flicks and heeling passes to break down the resilient Málaga defense. They had periods of pressure, especially on the right flank with efforts from Marcelo and James Rodríguez, but clear chances were limited.\n\nMálaga's attempts to break on the counter found some success as they pressed Madrid's backline. A direct approach from Málaga saw several crosses into the box, but they were efficiently dealt with by Iker Casillas and his defenders. \n\nAs the first half drew to a close, Málaga had moments that could have led to an equalizer but lacked the finishing touch. They also had a well-organized defensive effort that made it difficult for Madrid's attackers to find clear opportunities.\n\n**Second Half:**\n\nThe second half began much like the first, with Real Madrid pushing for control and Málaga eagerly trying to find a way back into the match. The initial moments saw some aggressive pressing from Málaga, forcing mistakes from the Madrid backline. Arbeloa, who had been involved in some skirmishes, found himself substituted with Dani Carvajal being called upon to bolster the defense against Málaga’s increasing pressure from Boca.\n\nMálaga showed more intent and almost capitalized on a few chances, but Madrid’s defense remained vigilant. The turning point came when Real Madrid orchestrated a smooth counterattack involving Cristiano Ronaldo and Isco. Around the 21st minute of the second half, Cristiano Ronaldo earned a penalty after a swift interplay with Isco and James. He stepped up to take it, but his effort struck the post, keeping the score at 1-0 to Real Madrid and giving Málaga a lifeline.\n\nMadrid, spurred on by the missed penalty, came alive. This invigorated spirit led them to their second goal in the 24th minute of the second half. A brilliant team move saw James Rodríguez completing a marvelous one-two with Isco before unleashing a blistering strike that Kameni couldn’t quite grasp fully, doubling Real Madrid's lead to 2-0.\n\nHowever, Málaga quickly responded. An inch-perfect cross from Rosales found Juanmi, who sneaked in behind Pepe and Sergio Ramos to head the ball past Casillas, closing the gap to 2-1 and reminding Madrid that the game was far from over.\n\nReal Madrid sought to regain their control and tempo, with Toni Kroos and Modric pulling the strings in midfield. The relative inaccuracy and lack of fluidity at times saw Málaga taking advantage of turnovers and marauding down the pitch looking for an equalizer. During these moments, Málaga exhibited a lot of heart and pressed as Real Madrid fought to secure their lead.\n\nAn additional scare came with an injury to Luka Modric who, after a clash, had to be substituted due to concerns over his knee. This changed the dynamic slightly for Madrid as they had to reorganize themselves. Illarramendi came on to take his place as Madrid looked to add fresh legs and maintain a midfield presence.\n\nIn the dying moments of the match, Real Madrid finally put the game to bed. In the 43rd minute of the second half, a goal from Cristiano Ronaldo, who had been tirelessly pushing forward all game, sealed the victory. An interception by Pepe sparked the buildup from the back, with the ball quickly finding Chicharito. The Mexican forward burst down the left flank, expertly maneuvered away from Angeleri, and squared it for Ronaldo who finished with ease to make it 3-1.\n\nThe referee's final whistle brought an end to an engaging contest, which saw Real Madrid triumph despite facing initial scares, a missed penalty, and player injuries. The victory kept their hopes in the league alive and added to their momentum going forward into the crucial stages of the season."
