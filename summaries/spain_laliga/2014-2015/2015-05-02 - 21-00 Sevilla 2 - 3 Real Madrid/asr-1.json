Bernabeu.\n8:19 Comment: And getting some whistles as well from the fans.\n8:22 Comment: Ancelotti, and I have to agree with him, I think,\n8:24 Comment: saying he doesn't understand how the Bernabeu

side.\n9:20 Comment: Yes, indeed.\n9:21 Comment: It was great pounce.\n9:22 Comment: A decent finish from Cristiano Ronaldo.\n9:25 Comment: But the best of all was the save by Sergio Rico.\n9:32

Real Madrid.\n10:12 Comment: It appears now that they're...\n10:14 Comment: setting the pace.\n10:15 Comment: And Sevilla are just trying to soak up the pressure a little bit more.\n10:18 Comment: Unai Emery sides always have these spells in the game\n10:21 Comment: in which they just allow the other side to have possession.\n10:24 Comment: And then they go into another phase in which they go out into all-out attack.\n10:29 Comment: Wonderful save that is from Sergio Rico.\n10:32 Comment: Did have work to do.\n10:33 Comment: Didn't just have to put his body in the way.\n10:35 Comment: Had to extend his arms as well.\n10:40 Comment: Rico it is.\n10:41 Comment: On the ball now for Sevilla.\n10:43 Comment: Sevilla.\n10:44 Comment: I'll tell you what.\n10:44 Comment: Beto is going to have a hard job getting his place back.\n10:48 Comment: Hero as much as he is for the penalty saves in the derby in Europe last season.\n10:55 Comment: Ball cleared for a corner.\n10:57 Comment: First of the game in favour of Real Madrid.\n11:4 Comment: And Sevilla conceded a few through set pieces in recent weeks.\n11:9 Comment: One against Granada.\n11:12 Comment: It's got my mind a couple of weeks ago.\n11:14 Comment: I've got the tallest of players either, Sevilla.\n11:24 Comment: Cornwall spun in.\n11:25 Comment: Headed away by Mbiya.\n11:27 Comment: Cruz.\n11:29 Comment: I was thinking when the shot didn't get the angle.\n11:32 Comment: Varane gives the ball away.\n11:34 Comment: But Real Madrid recover the ball.\n11:35 Comment: Played off the Frenchman.\n11:36 Comment: It'll be kept in by Isco.\n11:38 Comment: I think they really needed a bit more of a sprint there from Baco.\n11:43 Comment: Because Mbiya was waiting.\n11:44 Comment: to release for counter-attack.\n11:54 Comment: Strong challenge from Bakker.\n11:56 Comment: Bakker involved in a couple of incidents already.\n12:0 Comment: A little push on Pepe at the start of the game.\n12:4 Comment: And that elite challenge on Sergio Ramos.\n12:14 Comment: Ball picked up by Varane.\n12:19 Comment: Ronaldo.\n12:21 Comment: Ronaldo does have support on the outside.\n12:24 Comment: Isco twists, turns, plays the ball in.\n12:28 Comment: And the header was on.\n12:29 Comment: But James is unable to get his head quite around it.\n12:34 Comment: So it will be Sevilla to bring the ball away.\n12:43 Comment: That was a little bit careless.\n12:44 Comment: By Reyes.\n12:45 Comment: He's given Carvajal the ball.\n12:48 Comment: James.\n12:51 Comment: Combining there with Isco.\n12:52 Comment: Marcelo's on the overlap.\n12:54 Comment: Marcelo should get there.\n12:55 Comment: And unable to do so.\n12:57 Comment: It'll be goal kick in favour of Sevilla.\n13:1 Comment: So bright start by Sevilla.\n13:3 Comment: Real Madrid though.\n13:4 Comment: Just edging towards a Sevilla goal on more occasions in the last five minutes or so.\n13:10 Comment: Duncan.\n13:11 Comment: Yeah, I think Unai Emery's got his side organised at least.\n13:14 Comment: But Real Madrid, they're always going to get chances against any team in the league.\n13:19 Comment: Especially when that side is sitting back.\n13:22 Comment: But haven't really seen too much weakness from Sevilla.\n13:26 Comment: And hint that they might be looking for the counter-attack with Carlos Bacca through the middle.\n13:30 Comment: Just haven't been able to find him just yet.\n13:32 Comment: They're looking for him again here.\n13:34 Comment: Mbia's ball is reachable.\n13:36 Comment: Bacca.\n13:38 Comment: Bacca being marshaled by Pepe Reyes.\n13:41 Comment: Reyes plays it forward.\n13:42 Comment: Will there be a flag?\n13:43 Comment: No.\n13:44 Comment: Well there.\n13:44 Comment: There wasn't.\n13:45 Comment: I think most of us were looking for a flag on Alex Vidal.\n13:50 Comment: That was a real opportunity for Sevilla.\n13:53 Comment: I think Alex Vidal was looking for it as well.\n13:55 Comment: He almost apologetically shot that one.\n13:59 Comment: Reyes pings it in.\n14:0 Comment: The ball brought down cleverly by Ewa Benega.\n14:4 Comment: Alex Vidal in support.\n14:6 Comment: And that would have gone out for corner.\n14:8 Comment: Just kept in.\n14:9 Comment: Pepe now clears it up towards the halfway line.\n14:14 Comment: And it's a real opportunity there for Sevilla.\n14:16 Comment: Just to be the best of the game.\n14:18 Comment: It was a very narrow angle.\n14:20 Comment: Iker Casillas had it covered.\n14:22 Comment: This is Reyes.\n14:24 Comment: Goes inside to Bacca.\n14:26 Comment: The one-two is complete.\n14:28 Comment: The ball played back.\n14:30 Comment: There's no flag again.\n14:32 Comment: And twice now.\n14:34 Comment: Real Madrid's back four have been caught out.\n14:36 Comment: Sliced open very easily.\n14:38 Comment: Now at the other end.\n14:40 Comment: Ronaldo grabs the ball.\n14:42 Comment: And it's a good shot.\n14:43 Comment: Ronaldo's ball.\n14:45 Comment: Just played behind the Mexican forward though.\n14:47 Comment: And runs out for a goalkeeper.\n14:49 Comment: Real opportunities here, Duncan.\n14:51 Comment: Well, you'd have to say.\n14:53 Comment: The linesman deciding he's in line with Marcelo.\n14:55 Comment: But as you said, it really looked like Vidal was.\n14:57 Comment: Even signaling don't pass it to me.\n14:59 Comment: Because I'm in an offside position.\n15:1 Comment: He wanted that pass to go to Benega.\n15:3 Comment: And when he got it, no flag up.\n15:5 Comment: Takes a look up.\n15:7 Comment: And it's a good shot.\n15:13 Comment: Because I have to shoot this now.\n15:15 Comment: Casillas doing a good job there.\n15:17 Comment: And this man, we've seen him advancing as well.\n15:19 Comment: It's left them a bit vulnerable.\n15:21 Comment: Tremolinos pushing up from left back.\n15:23 Comment: They've covered well though when Real Madrid have hit on the counter.\n15:27 Comment: That's another delightful ball.\n15:29 Comment: Behind the Real Madrid back four.\n15:31 Comment: Vidal playing it in.\n15:33 Comment: Unable to get it around Varane.\n15:35 Comment: Says Benega.\n15:37 Comment: That's a short blocked.\n15:39 Comment: Real Madrid have it.\n15:41 Comment: But...\n15:43 Comment: Sevilla.\n15:45 Comment: With a couple of very interesting attacks over the last couple of minutes.\n15:51 Comment:

He's turned into a real\n25:25 Comment: box-to-box midfielder.\n25:27 Comment: That's something really useful.\n25:29 Comment: That Sevilla bench looks very strong\n25:31 Comment: as well. When they played Barcelona earlier\n25:33 Comment: this season, they probably actually have a\n25:35 Comment: stronger bench.\n25:37 Comment: If you look at the\n25:39 Comment: quality on that bench, Navarro,\n25:41 Comment: seasoned pro, Iborra,\n25:43 Comment: Gaimero, Koke,\n25:45 Comment: Vidaló, and Denis Suárez.\n25:48 Comment: Always like to see\n25:49 Comment: Suárez come on.\n25:52 Comment: He's only just come back\n25:53 Comment: into favour with\n25:56 Comment: Unai Emery.\n25:57 Comment: After being left out for a few match\n25:59 Comment: days.\n26:0 Comment: He's jeered as well at Vicente Pichuano\n26:3 Comment: a couple of match days ago.\n26:5 Comment: One of two players on loan\n26:7 Comment: from Barcelona, looks like Gerard\n26:9 Comment: de la Feu.\n26:11 Comment: Carvajal\n26:12 Comment: catching Mbia there.\n26:14 Comment: Let's have another look.\n26:18 Comment: They're both entitled\n26:19 Comment: to go for it.\n26:20 Comment: There's not too much in that because\n26:22 Comment: Carvajal's just following through when he catches\n26:25 Comment: Mbia.\n26:26 Comment: Yeah.\n26:27 Comment: He's just unfortunate to plant his foot at the same time.\n26:29 Comment: I don't even see the\n26:31 Comment: offence there from Carvajal.\n26:33 Comment: He's concentrating on the ball,\n26:35 Comment: clears the ball, and then as you say,\n26:37 Comment: Mbia goes over him rather than the other way around.\n26:40 Comment: Reyes again,\n26:41 Comment: probing, pushes it through to\n26:43 Comment: Bakker, back inside.\n26:45 Comment: There was an offside flag though against the\n26:47 Comment: Colombian this time.\n26:49 Comment: But it's got to be Warriam Franchelotti.\n26:52 Comment: That was an absolute nightmare for Pepe.\n26:53 Comment: He didn't know whether to go for Reyes, go to Bakker\n26:56 Comment: who was making the run.\n26:57 Comment: Meyendi was caught in the middle and luckily saved by\n27:0 Comment: Leidenstam's flag.\n27:6 Comment: I'm certain Ancelotti will be speaking to his defence\n27:10 Comment: at half-time.\n27:10 Comment: They've been caught out on a number of occasions.\n27:13 Comment: This could be the goal though.\n27:15 Comment: Ronaldo unable to finish it.\n27:18 Comment: Much to the amusement of the home fans.\n27:22 Comment: From Molinas.\n27:27 Comment: Mbia.\n27:30 Comment: Against Ronaldo, the target man inside the box.\n27:35 Comment: Players looking to find some defence.\n27:38 Comment: Well aware of the threat of Cristiano Ronaldo.\n27:40 Comment: They've always put a man on him when a ball comes into the box.\n27:44 Comment: Diogo.\n27:45 Comment: Combining with Mbia, Benega.\n27:49 Comment: It's Alex Vidal.\n27:51 Comment: Diogo.\n27:52 Comment: Gets the pence there but\n27:55 Comment: loses the ball to Cruz.\n27:57 Comment: He scores.\n27:59 Comment: Ball goes beyond Marcelo.\n28:1 Comment: It'll be a throw-in in favour of Sevilla.\n28:6 Comment: This is the ball in by Chicharito\n28:8 Comment: and Cristiano Ronaldo just missing it basically.\n28:23 Comment: I'm not sure if he was trying for the backheel\n28:25 Comment: or whether he was trying to side-foot\n28:27 Comment: it.\n28:27 Comment: He's got it in and just completely hit fresh air.\n28:32 Comment: It's an unlucky turn for Cristiano Ronaldo as we see\n28:34 Comment: Paca caught offside again.\n28:36 Comment: It was Pepe.\n28:37 Comment: Didn't know whether to play the offside trap.\n28:39 Comment: Go to Reyes or go for Paca.\n28:43 Comment: It's the kind of confusion Sevilla will be wanting\n28:46 Comment: to invoke in the defence.\n28:48 Comment: There's a clunch here.\n28:50 Comment: Sergio Ramos again involved.\n28:53 Comment: He seems to have\n28:54 Comment: come off the worse.\n28:57 Comment: Both players certainly with their eyes on the ball.\n29:4 Comment: Czajariak.\n29:5 Comment: Polish midfielder.\n29:7 Comment: And Sergio Ramos.\n29:9 Comment: Oh dear me.\n29:12 Comment: It's almost like he nosed him rather than headed him.\n29:16 Comment: We have another look there at Cristiano Ronaldo's\n29:19 Comment: inability to finish this one off.\n29:21 Comment: There was a little bounce\n29:22 Comment: before it got to him.\n29:25 Comment: May well have put him off.\n29:27 Comment: A little bubble as the ball approached him.\n29:29 Comment: Sergio Ramos.\n29:31 Comment: Czajariak being looked at.\n29:33 Comment: Czajariak looks to have come off the worse from the exchange.\n29:35 Comment: If it's blood on Ramos it might just be from the nose of Czajariak who is bleeding.\n29:37 Comment: And that means Sevilla will have to go down to ten men for a little while because that shirt is probably going to have to be changed.\n29:48 Comment: As we know you're not allowed to...\n29:50 Comment: Oh dear me.\n29:52 Comment: It was his nose that made the difference.\n29:57 Comment: The impact with the back of Sergio Ramos' head.\n30:1 Comment: On the pole.\n30:2 Comment: On the...\n30:3 Comment: Oh dear.\n30:4 Comment: Looking at it again.\n30:6 Comment: I'm going to turn away I think.\n30:12 Comment: Unai Emery's got a big decision to make now.\n30:14 Comment: Does he take off Krajcowiak?\n30:16 Comment: Does he make the change to ensure that he keeps eleven men on the pitch?\n30:21 Comment: Or does he risk playing with ten men for what might be five minutes trying to stem that blood?\n30:26 Comment: Change for shirt and get Krajcowiak ready to continue.\n30:30 Comment: The thing is it's not just the injury to the nose.\n30:33 Comment: It's the possible effect on the player's concentration.\n30:36 Comment: You know that looks like an injury that's worth taking a player off for.\n30:41 Comment: And he's got replacements on the bench.\n30:44 Comment: If ever there was a moment to bring on Iborra.\n30:46 Comment: Iborra can play in that position easily.\n30:49 Comment: Has been doing so.\n30:50 Comment: Back to the game then Cristiano Ronaldo unable to play the ball in with any accuracy it's ever been.\n30:55 Comment: Benega.\n30:56 Comment: Benega twisting and turning.\n31:2 Comment: Mbiya.\n31:3 Comment: Very calm play indeed from Mbiya.\n31:7 Comment: Spacker.\n31:8 Comment: Pins it into the path of Alex Vidal.\n31:10 Comment: He combines with Diogo.\n31:14 Comment: Vidal continuing his run.\n31:16 Comment: And the block is there from Marcelo.\n31:18 Comment: It'll be a throw into Sevilla into the last quarter of the first.\n31:25 Comment: Trotting to the right for Dier.\n31:27 Comment: Delaya.\n31:28 Comment: A great forehand.\n31:29 Comment: Bum-push.\n31:31 Comment: But then,\n31:32 Comment: well the shot was on.\n31:38 Comment: Casillas hasn't really had a lot to do so far in this game.\n31:41 Comment: Couple of close-range stops.\n31:43 Comment: That's about it.\n31:44 Comment: It's all at his near post with not too much option for the Sevilla player.\n31:49 Comment: To get it past him.\n31:52 Comment: Hasn't really had to challenge for anything in the air either.\n31:55 Comment: the\n31:59 Comment: still down to 10 men Duncan said the decision will have to be made shortly\n32:8 Comment: and I would say that Mburu should be warming up\n32:14 Comment: he just sat back down on the bench they've got a spare shirt for Kraychovyak\n32:18 Comment: I think they're going to leave this decision right until the last moment\n32:25 Comment: we have Vitolo who's taken his bib off and is sat on the bench\n32:30 Comment: Mburu's the number 12 who's warming up\n32:34 Comment: it's Marcelo for Real Madrid\n32:36 Comment: can they take advantage of Sevilla being one man short? Isco\n32:41 Comment: Marcelo plays it in the ball cleared\n32:43 Comment: only as far as Kroos Sergio Ramos\n32:47 Comment: looking for Ronaldo the ball played away was actually\n32:51 Comment: directed towards Chicharito Marcelo picks it up\n32:55 Comment: and a poor ball from the Brazilian full-back\n33:4 Comment: and Ancelotti will be asking questions at both ends I think\n33:8 Comment: will be asking how Pepe has been beaten\n33:12 Comment: and Baku has managed to get in behind him on a couple of occasions\n33:16 Comment: and the finishing hasn't been of the highest order either from Real Madrid\n33:22 Comment: well you would expect he is going to at some point bring down\n33:25 Comment: Gareth Bale in preparation if nothing else for the Champions League\n33:30 Comment: we'll probably mean they're playing a 4-4-2 now\n33:34 Comment: it might mean 4-3-3 back to Gareth Bale on the right\n33:38 Comment: as James Rodriguez might have to make way\n33:40 Comment: he might try and switch things up with the defence\n33:42 Comment: he's got Ramos on the pitch\n33:44 Comment: maybe rotate the players around to try and accommodate Gareth Bale in the second half\n33:48 Comment: but it will require a change of tactics\n33:52 Comment: I think the player most at risk in that\n33:55 Comment: forward six if you like of Real Madrid\n33:57 Comment: it's probably Isco\n34:0 Comment: who's not the highest in the pecking order\n34:3 Comment: as Alex Vidal goes down\n34:5 Comment: another clash of heads\n34:7 Comment: Varane, well it's more of an elbow on Vidal's head\n34:12 Comment: it'll be a free kick\n34:13 Comment: no yellow cards so far in this game\n34:16 Comment: almost ten minutes to half time\n34:19 Comment: well surprisingly for this game which usually has quite heated temperatures\n34:23 Comment: not just in the weather conditions\n34:26 Comment: but on the pitch there's some real fiery aggressive sides\n34:29 Comment: back up\n34:30 Comment: unable to get to the ball ahead of Pepe\n34:36 Comment: haven't really seen any untoward challenges\n34:39 Comment: that collision between Ramos and Krajchovic\n34:41 Comment: just a normal football incident of course\n34:46 Comment: James bringing forward for the All Blacks\n34:48 Comment: points with Chicharito\n34:53 Comment: has been almost five minutes since Krajchovic was taken off the pitch\n35:0 Comment: Marcelo\n35:1 Comment: finds Isco\n35:6 Comment: Ronaldo\n35:8 Comment: gets it\n35:10 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo\n35:12 Comment: and Unai Emery might be asking himself whether he's made the right decision this time\n35:17 Comment: to play five minutes with ten men\n35:20 Comment: a power play moment taken advantage of\n35:23 Comment: by Cristiano Ronaldo\n35:25 Comment: Real Madrid a one up\n35:27 Comment: 40 La Liga goals for Cristiano Ronaldo\n35:30 Comment: he's a deadly striker\n35:32 Comment: you have to put everything\n35:34 Comment: in your power in his way\n35:36 Comment: Sevilla playing with ten men\n35:38 Comment: just as they were upping the pace\n35:40 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo it's a\n35:42 Comment: great little run for him\n35:44 Comment: but just one step forward\n35:46 Comment: a couple of steps back\n35:47 Comment: it's a great finish from Ronaldo\n35:49 Comment: as you say though\n35:50 Comment: questions will be asked\n35:51 Comment: as to whether it was the right strategy to play for five minutes with ten men\n35:57 Comment: it's a good ball by Isco\n35:58 Comment: two targets waiting for it as well\n36:5 Comment: Ronaldo celebrating with fellow Portuguese international Coentrou\n36:16 Comment: and the goalie\n36:18 Comment: is a good ball\n36:20 Comment: and the goalie is a good ball\n36:24 Comment: Coentrou looked to have had a quick word with Cristiano Ronaldo\n36:27 Comment: in midweek\n36:29 Comment: when Arbeloa had scored\n36:30 Comment: and Cristiano Ronaldo was so frustrated\n36:32 Comment: Arbeloa were just teasing Ronaldo a bit\n36:34 Comment: but they are great friends\n36:38 Comment: and Unai Emery checking with his Polish midfielders\n36:42 Comment: to whether he can come back on the headers\n36:44 Comment: there it's two!\n36:45 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo two goals in a minute\n36:54 Comment: goal number 41\n36:56 Comment: for Ronaldo\n36:58 Comment: and a big blow for Sevilla's European aspirations\n37:4 Comment: Unai Emery will be I imagine fuming inside with himself\n37:10 Comment: two goals from inside the box from Cristiano Ronaldo\n37:13 Comment: they look to hit him again\n37:16 Comment: let's have a look at James Rodriguez\n37:18 Comment: flicked on Ronaldo's onside there\n37:20 Comment: no doubt about it\n37:22 Comment: the foot is slightly high but he's got every right to go for it\n37:25 Comment: with Sergio Rico not anywhere near it\n37:28 Comment: it's prodded in by Cristiano Ronaldo\n37:31 Comment: and what a blow that is for Sevilla just before half time\n37:34 Comment: look at the flick as well by Chicharito\n37:37 Comment: he's definitely aware of the presence there\n37:41 Comment: that flick on is a wonderful one and\n37:44 Comment: he's everything he does goals plus assists will help his cause\n37:49 Comment: the flick just takes some of the power off the delivery in from James Rodriguez\n37:55 Comment: Ronaldo did not have to adjust his run at all\n37:57 Comment: two goals for him in the space of a minute\n38:0 Comment: it's a bleak reading for Sevilla who have Krojchovic back on the field of play\n38:4 Comment: but perhaps too late\n38:6 Comment: Sevilla will need to strike he would have thought before half time if possible\n38:12 Comment: is Sergio Ronaldo\n38:14 Comment: almost brings the ball down\n38:16 Comment: persistent play there from Beneguer\n38:20 Comment: but the ball goes out for a throw in favour of the All Blacks of Real Madrid\n38:28 Comment: really is a wonderful header on by the Mexican forward\n38:41 Comment: Sevilla throwing\n38:42 Comment: Mbia\n38:44 Comment: Helmed\n38:46 Comment: the 21\n39:6 Comment: click on a blank\n39:7 Comment: finishing tour\n39:8 Comment: 'll have two more attempts\n39:9 Comment: the aspirations from San Francisco\n39:10 Comment: late bit of a flick was too straight\n39:11 Comment: to make it 4-3\n39:12 Comment: after that one\n39:13 Comment: away by Pepe, still got a job to clear it though. Vidal, Mbiya! But he caught it well,\n39:22 Comment: high and wide but powerful shot there from the Cameroon midfielder.\n39:34 Comment: He really latches onto it and Alessio Vidal, probably soft cushioned header into the box,\n39:39 Comment: first time we've really seen Mbiya get forward.\n39:47 Comment: Brought down neatly by Isco. Isco is caught, there's a big shout, there will be a free kick.\n40:7 Comment: Mbiya with the arm out.\n40:10 Comment: Yes, a little blow for Sevilla, five minutes left in the first half, it's going to be a real struggle for them.\n40:22 Comment: Do they make the changes after half-time? Do they stick with the same line-up?\n40:27 Comment: I think Carlo Ancelotti is going to make some changes.\n40:30 Comment: Despite the two goals, he can't be too happy with the performance of his side so far.\n40:36 Comment: Goals change that half-time talk though, don't they?\n40:39 Comment: If it wasn't for those two goals, I think Ancelotti would have been going in and speaking to his defence\n40:44 Comment: and wondering whether they could create more up front as well.\n40:47 Comment: But with the two goals in the bank, you can only go in and say, keep it up lads.\n40:52 Comment: And, you know, just maybe a little word in the ears of one or two of the defenders\n40:58 Comment: who in the early stages of this game were being caught out and opened up.\n41:3 Comment: But at the moment the scoreline is Sevilla 0 Real Madrid 2.\n41:7 Comment: Real Madrid give the ball away in midfield.\n41:8 Comment: Reyes.\n41:12 Comment: Pinned forward towards backer but Diogo's ball, not accurate enough.\n41:20 Comment: Well, the first time these two teams met this season, it was a delayed fixture\n41:24 Comment: because Real Madrid were in action in the World Club Championship over Christmas.\n41:29 Comment: So it was delayed until back in February.\n41:34 Comment: Real Madrid went into a break 2-0 up then with goals from Real Madrid.\n41:38 Comment: But that's not all.\n41:39 Comment: They've got James Rodriguez and Xhese.\n41:41 Comment: Sevilla pulled one back late, so don't rule them out just yet.\n41:45 Comment: Sevilla still with options and they can change things up on the bench.\n41:49 Comment: They've got the likes of Gameiro to come on who could maybe change the game around\n41:53 Comment: and steal a goal from somewhere.\n41:56 Comment: Marcelo unable to keep it in.\n42:1 Comment: You'd have to say with Sevilla, if they are to get back in this game, they need more presence up front maybe.\n42:8 Comment: And one option, as you say, is to bring Gameiro on alongside backer.\n42:18 Comment: This is Reyes.\n42:22 Comment: Fends Diogo.\n42:24 Comment: Inside the 1-2 with Alex Vidal not coming off.\n42:28 Comment: Francisco looks to bring it away.\n42:30 Comment: Handball is given.\n42:33 Comment: Real Madrid push the ball forward to Cristiano Ronaldo.\n42:35 Comment: Carvajal is outside him.\n42:38 Comment: He's inside to James.\n42:40 Comment: James is looking to feed Chicharito.\n42:47 Comment: Unable to do so.\n42:53 Comment: And two minutes to half-time.\n42:59 Comment: How does the scoreline reflect what we've seen so far, Duncan?\n43:4 Comment: Well, Real Madrid, they've had some chances in the early going.\n43:7 Comment: Sevilla had come out of the blocks really strongly.\n43:10 Comment: Just looks as if Sevilla were beginning to come back into the game.\n43:13 Comment: They had a couple of pullbacks, a couple of runs.\n43:16 Comment: I think that was a Cricoviac injury.\n43:19 Comment: He's back on the field of play now.\n43:21 Comment: But that delay in getting him back on has proven really costly.\n43:25 Comment: Sevilla completely relinquished possession to Madrid during that five-minute spell.\n43:30 Comment: And Real Madrid, in particular, Cristiano Ronaldo, have taken advantage.\n43:35 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo, by the way, back in front in the race for the Pachichi Trophy for top scorer.\n43:41 Comment: He overtakes Messi again with now 41 goals.\n43:45 Comment: Sergio Ramos blocking Mbia there.\n43:54 Comment: No yellow cards so far from Gonzalez.\n43:59 Comment: Watch out for Evo Banega from his free kick.\n44:2 Comment: He's got a really good delivery.\n44:9 Comment: He's lining up the wall.\n44:13 Comment: Banega scored against Barcelona from this kind of distance earlier on this season.\n44:17 Comment: He's got a really good delivery.\n44:21 Comment: I think he's going to go for power on this one there, Evo Banega.\n44:24 Comment: A really solid right boot.\n44:26 Comment: Jose Antonio Reyes, of course, a candidate as well.\n44:32 Comment: He looks like Banega.\n44:34 Comment: Floats it over. There's no flag.\n44:36 Comment: Third opportunity for Sevilla.\n44:43 Comment: It was a wonderfully worked free kick and Real Madrid once again caught out, Duncan.\n44:48 Comment: I think they were lulled into the predictability of it all.\n44:52 Comment: And maybe Sevilla over-egged the pudding there as it was chested down.\n44:57 Comment: Perhaps the shot would have been on.\n44:59 Comment: Bakker didn't look to be the best option.\n45:3 Comment: It's maybe just one punts too many as the ball brought forward by Banega.\n45:11 Comment: Reyes looking to recover it.\n45:13 Comment: The ball cleared by Pepe.\n45:15 Comment: Mbiya goes in.\n45:17 Comment: The ball pinging back and forth between the blacks and the whites.\n45:27 Comment: Luis Vidal.\n45:29 Comment: Just to get away from Marcelo.\n45:31 Comment: Will he be able to get the ball in?\n45:32 Comment: He's gone down.\n45:33 Comment: He's looking for something.\n45:35 Comment: He may get it as well.\n45:38 Comment: The linesman is taking up position.\n45:41 Comment: And it's a penalty.\n45:44 Comment: And Sergio Ramos is booked.\n45:47 Comment: What a wonderful moment then for Sevilla.\n45:50 Comment: A real chance.\n45:51 Comment: And you'd have to go with the referee on that one.\n45:54 Comment: I know you can argue both ways, but contact there certainly is.\n46:0 Comment: There's no contact with the ball there.\n46:1 Comment: He just misses out by centimeters.\n46:3 Comment: Sergio Ramos, he does bring Aleix Vidal down.\n46:7 Comment: And it's silly really because he was going too far along towards the goal line.\n46:11 Comment: It was a risky challenge and he picks up the yellow card.\n46:14 Comment: Now Carlos Bacca looking for goal number 20 in the league this season.\n46:18 Comment: Would be a wonderful moment to get it.\n46:22 Comment: Bacca.\n46:23 Comment: Bacca!\n46:25 Comment: Sevilla have brought themselves back into this game with Bacca.\n46:29 Comment: Bacca.\n46:31 Comment: And that is a great moment for Sevilla to score.\n46:36 Comment: Fantastic.\n46:37 Comment: You always say a goal before half time can change everything.\n46:41 Comment: Sevilla pulling one back.\n46:42 Comment: Suddenly the game seems a bit more attainable.\n46:45 Comment: And it's almost the last kick of the first half.\n46:49 Comment: It is indeed the last kick.\n46:50 Comment: Bacca reduces Real Madrid's lead to one and again changes the half time conversation between...\n47:1 Comment: Real Madrid.\n47:2 Comment: Real Madrid are two goals ahead of one in the game against Pizjuan.\n47:5 Comment: With the same result that was...\n47:7 Comment: Real Madrid are two goals ahead of one in the game against Pizjuan.\n47:12 Comment: What?\n47:13 Comment: You are out.\n47:14 Comment: card.\n47:15 Comment: SCORE\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Navas, Coentrou, Obeloa, Nacho, Hilara Mendejese and Gareth Bale.\n0:7 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo goes down in protest but nothing doing since Gonzalez.\n0:16 Comment: It seems to go down very easily, just Venerl.\n0:19 Comment: We're just talking about no changes at half-time,\n0:22 Comment: but I do expect Gareth Bale to be brought on at some point.\n0:26 Comment: Bale returning from injury, you would imagine would be necessary\n0:31 Comment: for the Champions League game coming up.\n0:35 Comment: Sevilla then line up with Rico Ingola, back four of Diogo,\n0:39 Comment: Calicio, Polo and Tremolinas at the back.\n0:42 Comment: In midfield, a trio of Embiid, Ewa Benegra and Kouchaouiak.\n0:48 Comment: And up front, Alisvidal, Reyes and Paka.\n0:52 Comment: Bale, Madrid, Casillas, Ingola, back four of Marcelo, Varane, Pepe and Carvajal.\n0:57 Comment: Hold on amids the ball played in and headed away by one of the four defenders, Pepe.\n1:4 Comment: Midfield is held by Isco Cruz and Sergio Ramos.\n1:8 Comment: Up front, Chicharito, Cristiano Ronaldo and James.\n1:13 Comment: First corner of the second half in favour of Sevilla.\n1:22 Comment: Ronaldo defending back of them.\n1:25 Comment: Oh, and he's been scuffed and that could have been costly.\n1:30 Comment: No effort on goal in the end though.\n1:36 Comment: Sevilla have possession.\n1:44 Comment: Benegra on the ball, another play.\n1:47 Comment: May not see last the 90 minutes.\n1:52 Comment: Ball played through, it's a good run from Alisvidal.\n1:55 Comment: And there'll be another corner, early pressure here being applied by Sevilla.\n1:59 Comment: Much like how they started the first half, the opening minutes are really going at Real Madrid.\n2:5 Comment: They would have been boosted by that goal just before half-time.\n2:8 Comment: Benegra moves over to take the corner.\n2:15 Comment: Fires it in, cleared by Varane.\n2:21 Comment: Picked up again by the white shirts of Sevilla.\n2:28 Comment: Combining with Tremolinas and the goal.\n2:31 Comment: That goal certainly charged the atmosphere here.\n2:42 Comment: And the goal is in.\n2:45 Comment: It's a goal for Real Madrid.\n2:48 Comment: And it's a goal for Sevilla.\n2:51 Comment: And it's a goal for Real Madrid.\n2:54 Comment: And it's a goal for Sevilla.\n3:2 Comment: Towards the six, and it's just wide from Vidal.\n3:11 Comment: Mbilla, rather.\n3:15 Comment: He's wrestling with Pepe, who's all over him.\n3:17 Comment: They're all over each other, in fact.\n3:19 Comment: Mbilla's got a handful of shirt as well.\n3:22 Comment: Very little jump as he gets the header.\n3:25 Comment: And it's only just wide. Casillas had his feet planted.\n3:29 Comment: Wouldn't have been much he could have done to stop that going inside the post.\n3:32 Comment: Had Mbilla been a bit more accurate.\n3:35 Comment: Casillas nowhere near getting to that ball, as you say.\n3:38 Comment: It was a real opportunity for Sevilla.\n3:40 Comment: Alix Vidal clashing with Marcelo.\n3:42 Comment: Diogo plays the ball into Cristiano Ronaldo.\n3:45 Comment: He keeps it in. Isco is crowded out.\n3:52 Comment: And there's some fine movement from Reyes.\n3:56 Comment: Starting the game brightly, Jose Antonio Reyes.\n3:59 Comment: Looking fresh again at the start of this second half.\n4:4 Comment: Carvajal for Real Madrid.\n4:6 Comment: Pings it inside. Chicharito finds Cristiano Ronaldo.\n4:11 Comment: Cristiano looking to line up the shot.\n4:13 Comment: Gives it to Cruz. And just wide.\n4:16 Comment: Yes, Toni Cruz's shot. He broke the deadlock last weekend.\n4:20 Comment: From a similar kind of distance.\n4:23 Comment: He hasn't scored too many goals this season.\n4:26 Comment: Just a couple to his name in La Liga.\n4:29 Comment: But he's always a threat from outside the box.\n4:32 Comment: That was some game last week, wasn't it?\n4:35 Comment: Between Celta and Real Madrid.\n4:37 Comment: I think one of the most enjoyable games of the season so far.\n4:41 Comment: It was a wonderful end to Sunday night.\n4:44 Comment: It was a late fixture.\n4:46 Comment: 4-2 victory in the end for Real Madrid.\n4:49 Comment: But Celta pushed them all the way.\n4:52 Comment: Using similar tactics to Severe.\n4:55 Comment: Playing the ball around.\n4:57 Comment: Looking to hit them down the wings and through the middle.\n5:0 Comment: Along the ground.\n5:2 Comment: Chameleon has brought down and out of the box.\n5:5 Comment: And it's a very good game.\n5:8 Comment: Chameleon has brought down and an obvious yellow card.\n5:18 Comment: Another look.\n5:20 Comment: Carvajal putting an arm out.\n5:23 Comment: He can't do that.\n5:25 Comment: An opportunity to go down. Chameleon has took it.\n5:28 Comment: Free kick. And a yellow card for Daniel Carvajal.\n5:32 Comment: The yellow cards have been shown to both players.\n5:35 Comment: A look from suspension.\n5:37 Comment: Saka Ramos for the penalty.\n5:39 Comment: Only got a yellow.\n5:41 Comment: And Daniel Carvajal.\n5:43 Comment: Starting their collection early.\n5:45 Comment: Five minutes into the second half.\n5:47 Comment: It's Severe 1, Real Madrid 2.\n5:50 Comment: Gareth Bale has just started warming up.\n5:55 Comment: The ball played into the six.\n5:57 Comment: It's decent ahead.\n5:59 Comment: The shot comes in from Reyes.\n6:1 Comment: It took a deflection.\n6:3 Comment: The players are waving their arms at the fans.\n6:9 Comment: Just to see if they can get a little bit more.\n6:12 Comment: Going behind the goal there.\n6:16 Comment: And they've responded.\n6:18 Comment: The ball played in.\n6:19 Comment: And there was a free kick.\n6:24 Comment: Sears blocking it.\n6:26 Comment: Pepe the player who goes down.\n6:29 Comment: Must have flung him out of the way.\n6:31 Comment: For Pepe to go that far.\n6:33 Comment: A little nudge.\n6:35 Comment: But an obvious free kick.\n6:39 Comment: Taken by Iker Casillas.\n6:45 Comment: If we assume Bale is to come on.\n6:47 Comment: Who do you think will be replacing?\n6:50 Comment: It might very well be Rodriguez.\n6:53 Comment: He's been playing more in the midfield.\n6:56 Comment: But if it's going to be a change.\n6:58 Comment: On the right-hand side of the attack.\n7:0 Comment: And making it a 4-3-3.\n7:2 Comment: Then you would assume that Rodriguez would make way.\n7:4 Comment: Or Isco.\n7:6 Comment: That man will come off.\n7:7 Comment: Rodriguez will move over to the left-hand side of the midfield.\n7:10 Comment: Where he had been playing before he got injured.\n7:14 Comment: Plenty of opportunities to make a switch.\n7:17 Comment: But Gareth Bale probably has to come on.\n7:19 Comment: To get some match fitness.\n7:21 Comment: Coming into the game in midweek against Juventus.\n7:23 Comment: Trebellinus' ball in.\n7:24 Comment: Cleared by Pepe.\n7:26 Comment: Cost of the throw.\n7:30 Comment: I don't know if they'll have Karim Benzema back for that game.\n7:33 Comment: But Luka Mottridge certainly won't feature.\n7:35 Comment: He's only likely to be back for the final game of the season.\n7:40 Comment: Good recovery there from Trebellinus.\n7:42 Comment: The ball in.\n7:43 Comment: And just over back up.\n7:46 Comment: Shot from Reyes.\n7:49 Comment: A very bright start indeed.\n7:52 Comment: To the second half for Sevilla.\n7:55 Comment: It's a good strategy from Sevilla as well.\n7:58 Comment: Get the ball into the box.\n7:59 Comment: Shoot on sight as well.\n8:1 Comment: That's going to get the fans behind the Sevilla side.\n8:3 Comment: They were ushering them from the corner.\n8:5 Comment: To come on and give us some cheers.\n8:7 Comment: Help us along on our way.\n8:9 Comment: And there's a real

Comment: James.\n8:37 Comment: James goes down.\n8:38 Comment: It's a good position.\n8:43 Comment: That's a similar position.\n8:46 Comment: First half.\n8:48 Comment: Ronaldo.\n8:51 Comment: Free kick that went over the crossbar.\n8:57 Comment: You'd have to fancy Ronaldo again.\n8:59 Comment: Sergio Ramos having a word.\n9:2 Comment: Sergio Ramos always wants to be involved.\n9:4 Comment: But nobody's going to be taking that ball away from Cristiano Ronaldo.\n9:12 Comment: Looking for his hat-trick.\n9:15 Comment: He's got to get the ball over the wall.\n9:17 Comment: But under the crossbar.\n9:22 Comment: Ronaldo against Rico.\n9:25 Comment: Ronaldo into the wall.\n9:31 Comment: Sevilla look to counter.\n9:36 Comment: Reyes.\n9:37 Comment: Alesh Vidal back on the foul post.\n9:39 Comment: And it's a goal.\n9:41 Comment: Reyes.\n9:42 Comment: Alesh Vidal back on the foul post.\n9:45 Comment: Reyes being harried away.\n9:47 Comment: Isco manages to keep the ball in.\n9:54 Comment: But Sevilla have been gifted possession.\n9:56 Comment: Banega.\n9:57 Comment: Still Banega.\n9:59 Comment: Lovely movement from Banega.\n10:1 Comment: Plays it in!\n10:2 Comment: To the hands of Casillas.\n10:4 Comment: But it was a wonderful little dance there from Ever Banega.\n10:12 Comment: Moving in slow motion Banega.\n10:14 Comment: But he's got such a good touch.\n10:18 Comment: James Rodriguez did well defending there off the counter attack.\n10:21 Comment: He pushed Reyes wide.\n10:22 Comment: Made sure he couldn't get the pass to Alesh Vidal.\n10:24 Comment: Who was waiting outside the box.\n10:28 Comment: And Sevilla have recovered the ball this second half.\n10:30 Comment: Definitely in favour of the all-whites.\n10:32 Comment: Of Andalusia.\n10:37 Comment: Reyes.\n10:39 Comment: A bit too much on that ball for Vidal.\n10:43 Comment: Could be a goal kick to be taken by Casillas.\n10:51 Comment: Fans claim in a corner there.\n10:58 Comment: You can see Isco looking over the bench I think.\n11:3 Comment: He knows that he's got a fairly good chance of being the one\n11:6 Comment: to be replaced by Ganev Bale.\n11:12 Comment: No substitution so far by either team.\n11:16 Comment: Vidal robbed of the ball by Marcello.\n11:18 Comment: Marcello gets the ball off to Ramos.\n11:20 Comment: Ramos finds Isco.\n11:30 Comment: I just get the feeling that Sergio Ramos enjoys playing in the midfield.\n11:35 Comment: Even though we recognise him as a centre-half.\n11:42 Comment: He's one of those regular defenders who seems to have started out as a centre-forward.\n11:48 Comment: He loves getting up, going for the goals.\n11:50 Comment: I think he likes having slightly less defensive responsibility as well.\n11:56 Comment: Not the best of balls and it will be a goal kick in favour of Sevilla.\n12:0 Comment: He asked to rank Ramos on the list of defenders that he's managed.\n12:4 Comment: An illustrious list of course.\n12:6 Comment: Turam, Cannavaro, Nesta, Maldini played alongside Barresi as well.\n12:11 Comment: He says maybe Cannavaro had better defensive instincts.\n12:15 Comment: But in terms of being a complete player, Sergio Ramos had the edge over almost anybody that he'd managed.\n12:22 Comment: If you're saying that he's one of the most complete centre-halves,\n12:25 Comment: I've got to say that he's one of the most complete centre-halfs.\n12:28 Comment: I've ever seen. Why then play in the midfield?\n12:33 Comment: Bultman's out for a throw in favour of the All Blacks at Real Madrid.\n12:38 Comment: We have seen that man Pepe play in the midfield position a couple of seasons ago.\n12:44 Comment: With Ramos staying back in the defence.\n12:50 Comment: I agree, Sergio Ramos hasn't done too much in this game in the midfield to really warrant his positioning there.\n12:57 Comment: I think he's used a far better effect in his natural position as centre-half\n13:4 Comment: rather than in the middle or at full-back where he has been played on occasion at right-back.\n13:9 Comment: I don't think he's too much of a fan of playing at right-back,\n13:12 Comment: even though he's had such success with Spain playing there before.\n13:19 Comment: Cholinas in São Ficolo.\n13:27 Comment: Long ball by Sergio Rico.\n13:29 Comment: Flipped on by Bakker, but he'd come from an offside position.\n13:41 Comment: Easy call for a referee's assistant to make. He was several paces off there, Bakker.\n13:47 Comment: Lazy offside there.\n13:49 Comment: Colombian forward, Carvajal for Real Madrid.\n13:53 Comment: Could it just be some tiredness setting in for Bakker?\n13:56 Comment: Could we see Gamero come on imminently?\n14:1 Comment: This will be a pick-up at the back. Looking to bring it forward with Vidal.\n14:11 Comment: Spaniard for Benega.\n14:14 Comment: Easy then, multiple inside.\n14:17 Comment: Reyes, Reyes looking for Benega.\n14:24 Comment: Players forward. Ball needs to be delivered.\n14:27 Comment: It's a poor delivery though.\n14:30 Comment: Straight to Carvajal.\n14:32 Comment: They were desperately trying to keep that move going,\n14:34 Comment: but they didn't have any pace. They were zigzagging all over the pitch.\n14:37 Comment: Real Madrid have the time to get players back.\n14:42 Comment: Isco, can the team switch it to the right-hand side?\n14:45 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo was waiting. The ball goes out for a throw-in.\n14:54 Comment: Ramos.\n14:56 Comment: Finds Marcelo. Isco.\n15:2 Comment: Still Isco.\n15:4 Comment: He has got that chubby-like quality, hasn't he?\n15:7 Comment: Of not losing the ball always.\n15:10 Comment: Seems to be able to protect it.\n15:13 Comment: I'd say more like David Silva, who he must have played alongside\n15:17 Comment: at least in a couple of training games when he was at Valencia.\n15:21 Comment: Just one of those players who, especially in training,\n15:24 Comment: is so hard to win the ball.\n15:26 Comment: Every other player says it's impossible.\n15:28 Comment: Like they say about David Silva.\n15:30 Comment: Isco.\n15:32 Comment: A real step up in quality for him this season.\n15:35 Comment: Isco on the ball now.\n15:38 Comment: Taking on Diogo.\n15:40 Comment: Diogo gets a foot in and he'll go out for a throw-in\n15:42 Comment: in favour of Real Madrid.\n15:44 Comment: 15 minutes into the second half.\n15:46 Comment: And Sevilla 1 Real Madrid 0.\n15:48 Comment: Bad news for Barcelona.\n15:50 Comment: Good news for Valencia, of course.\n15:53 Comment: As we see Carvapel preparing to come on.\n15:55 Comment: Marcelo.\n15:57 Comment: Pings it back to Varane.\n15:59 Comment: Pepe.\n16:3 Comment: To Carvajal.\n16:5 Comment: Full-back looking inside the area.\n16:7 Comment: Plays it instead. Short to James Cruz.\n16:11 Comment: Isco.\n16:13 Comment: Lovely ball over!\n16:15 Comment: Ronaldo.\n16:17 Comment: Heading it back in towards Chicarito.\n16:21 Comment: But Rico was there.\n16:25 Comment: But it was a wonderful pass from Isco.\n16:29 Comment: He just had the right amount of pace on it.\n16:33 Comment: And he's got a good pass.\n16:37 Comment: He's got the right amount of pace on it.\n16:40 Comment: Dipped for Cristiano Ronaldo.\n16:42 Comment: And he knew he had to cut it back to Chicarito.\n16:44 Comment: It was just too close to the goalkeeper in the end.\n17:2 Comment: Another one for Baglia to chase.\n17:4 Comment: Casillas gets there first.\n17:7 Comment: Just looking at the upcoming fixtures for Real Madrid.\n17:10 Comment: They've got a really tough run in.\n17:12 Comment: Because they've got Juventus the first leg in midweek.\n17:16 Comment: Then Valencia in between the two games against Juventus.\n17:20 Comment: Then up against Espanyol in the final run.\n17:24 Comment: A severe play.\n17:26 Comment: Almost all of the same teams as Valencia.\n17:28 Comment: Real Madrid, of course, have to play Valencia.\n17:31 Comment: And then it is Salto Vigo for Sevilla.\n17:35 Comment: Fiorentina still in European action.\n17:38 Comment: Sevilla also in a European semi-final against Fiorentina.\n17:45 Comment: So they've got that sandwiching the Salto game.\n17:48 Comment: And then Almeria coming up in the final matchday.\n17:52 Comment: If it's all going to be settled by then,\n17:56 Comment: it could be crucial for both Real Madrid and Sevilla.\n18:0 Comment: Still a couple of big games between the top teams coming up.\n18:4 Comment: We mentioned earlier Atletico Madrid, Barcelona.\n18:7 Comment: Real Madrid, as you say, also have to entertain Valencia.\n18:11 Comment: Two tremendous games.\n18:13 Comment: The league is not over, whatever happens here today.\n18:18 Comment: Van Esferdou in South of Reyes.\n18:21 Comment: Marcelo is there, doesn't get the right touch on it.\n18:25 Comment: And maybe a little bit over elaborate there.\n18:30 Comment: It's something that's happened three or four times in this game.\n18:34 Comment: Sevilla have looked quite tasty going forward.\n18:37 Comment: And then just taking momentum out with too many touches.\n18:41 Comment: James.\n18:43 Comment: He was going direct for goal there.\n18:46 Comment: Didn't really get enough power in the shot to feed the ball through.\n18:51 Comment: Now Sevilla move from defence to attack in milliseconds almost.\n18:58 Comment: Pepe rubs the ball off Alexfiedel.\n19:3 Comment: Carlos Bakker was sandbagging a bit there.\n19:6 Comment: He looked as if he'd slowed down, he was too tired.\n19:8 Comment: Burst into a sprint towards the goalkeeper.\n19:10 Comment: It hadn't been picked up by Alexfiedel.\n19:18 Comment: Ronaldo.\n19:21 Comment: Mane, James, Sergio Ramos, Fiennes, Droos, Isco.\n19:27 Comment: It's time for Marcelo.\n19:35 Comment: Calverao.\n19:39 Comment: Sergio Ramos, he finds Marcelo.\n19:49 Comment: Prolonged possession here from Real Madrid.\n19:53 Comment: The ball not cleared. Calveao whips it in.\n19:56 Comment: Flicked on by James, Cristiano Ronaldo, Isco in support.\n20:1 Comment: The shot comes in and...\n20:4 Comment: Well, wide from Kroos, but Rico wasn't getting there.\n20:12 Comment: Second shot we've seen from Toni Kroos from outside the area.\n20:15 Comment: He kept the first one low and that one,\n20:17 Comment: he didn't beautifully hit it, had it gone into the top corner.\n20:20 Comment: It just half slices it, opening up his body.\n20:24 Comment: Toni Kroos has his eye on another La Liga goal,\n20:27 Comment: having scored against Celta last week.\n20:30 Comment: And it's a bit of a change, Chicharito to come off.\n20:35 Comment: He'll be disappointed, but not too surprised maybe.\n20:41 Comment: You had the feeling that he would be left on the pitch then.\n20:46 Comment: Chicharito.\n20:48 Comment: Maybe James Rodriguez might be the player who made way,\n20:51 Comment: but I think there's a pecking order there.\n20:53 Comment: I think it's going to still be a 4-4-2 with Gareth Bell and Ronaldo up top.\n20:59 Comment: With James playing on the right, Isco on the left.\n21:6 Comment: Another offside decision against Sevilla.\n21:9 Comment: Kroos just pecked it.\n21:13 Comment: Not enough to hold a free kick and the yellow card for Reyes.\n21:19 Comment: First player booked for Sevilla and he's going to miss the next match for them.\n21:25 Comment: Which is the game coming up against Celta Vigo.\n21:28 Comment: A few players who've been suspended, having picked up red cards in matchday 34,\n21:33 Comment: available to play today because the commission did not meet yesterday.\n21:37 Comment: Friday a bank holiday and thus none of the suspenders could be contested or awarded.\n21:43 Comment: So we've seen some players who featured for their sides\n21:47 Comment: despite red cards.\n21:50 Comment: Unusual indeed.\n21:52 Comment: Bakker felt he was being held off.\n21:57 Comment: Let's have a look.\n22:1 Comment: Both have put their arms out.\n22:4 Comment: Is it really in it?\n22:7 Comment: Grab of the arm from Bakker on Pepe that means that the arm's\n22:12 Comment: on his shoulder and his face.\n22:16 Comment: Sena and Ronaldo facing two defenders.\n22:21 Comment: And that ball's not going out.\n22:26 Comment: Ronaldo felt he was impeded.\n22:29 Comment: He continues, Sevilla in possession.\n22:35 Comment: Halfway through the second half it's Sevilla 1, Real Madrid 2.\n22:38 Comment: A victory for Real Madrid.\n22:41 Comment: Would close the gap back to two points at the top of the table for Barcelona.\n22:49 Comment: Would allow Valencia of course the chance to go back ahead on points\n22:53 Comment: of Sevilla, their level with them so far.\n22:56 Comment: And still to play, they play tomorrow against Eibar at Mestalla.\n23:1 Comment: Bale's ball in to Ronaldo!\n23:4 Comment: Sevilla 1, Real Madrid 3.\n23:8 Comment: Sevilla 1, Cristiano Ronaldo 3.\n23:14 Comment: Last season he scored a hat-trick against Sevilla.\n23:17 Comment: He couldn't play against Sevilla earlier on in this season\n23:20 Comment: through injury or suspension.\n23:23 Comment: A hat-trick today, Gareth Bale.\n23:26 Comment: What an instant impact upon arrival from the Welshman.\n23:29 Comment: What a header from Cristiano Ronaldo.\n23:32 Comment: Not much more the defender could have done about that.\n23:35 Comment: There's not much anybody can do.\n23:37 Comment: The cross is exceptional.\n23:39 Comment: It's just where Ronaldo wants it.\n23:42 Comment: And the ball headed across the path of Rico.\n23:46 Comment: And as you said, the immediate impact\n23:50 Comment: from the introduction of the Welsh wizard.\n23:55 Comment: There's an acknowledgement of Gareth Bale's contribution\n23:58 Comment: from Calogane Celotti.\n24:0 Comment: He'll be happy.\n24:2 Comment: He'll be as vindicated as you can be\n24:4 Comment: when you bring on a player who's cost around 90 million\n24:8 Comment: into your side.\n24:9 Comment: You know he's going to make some kind of impact.\n24:11 Comment: And it brings on Gareth Bale.\n24:13 Comment: And Bale immediately providing the assist.\n24:21 Comment: So a substitution now by Emery.\n24:26 Comment: Well, Danny Suarez has come on for the home side.\n24:31 Comment: And off goes Diogo.\n24:38 Comment: Musavir.\n24:40 Comment:

Comment: 20 minutes to go in this game.\n25:6 Comment: And I don't think we're going to get much rest.\n25:10 Comment: Musavir won't give up easily here.\n25:15 Comment: Isco giving away the free kick.\n25:18 Comment: It's a goal.\n25:22 Comment: It's caught Reyes.\n25:23 Comment: Reyes booked for a similar offence just moments ago.\n25:27 Comment: And it felt there should have been a yellow.\n25:30 Comment: We see the replay there.\n25:31 Comment: No penalty at all.\n25:36 Comment: Coming off Carrizo's side.\n25:39 Comment: It's Nash Vidal combining well with Suarez.\n25:42 Comment: Vidal unable to get around Varane.\n25:48 Comment: Isco picks up the ball from Cruz.\n25:50 Comment: Lovely lifted ball over by Isco.\n25:56 Comment: Still Isco.\n25:58 Comment: Looking for Bale.\n26:1 Comment: Real Madrid just seem to have turned things up a gear\n26:4 Comment: after Gareth Bale's arrival.\n26:6 Comment: He's added some freshness and some pace.\n26:8 Comment: It doesn't look as if he's missed a beat.\n26:10 Comment: He set him up for Cristiano Ronaldo\n26:12 Comment: and upping the tempo.\n26:15 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo with that goal.\n26:17 Comment: 42.\n26:18 Comment: He has to Leo Messi's 40.\n26:21 Comment: Leo Messi gave away a penalty to Neymar today.\n26:25 Comment: Allowed the Brazilian to take it and score against Cordoba.\n26:31 Comment: He might live to regret that perhaps by the end of the season.\n26:34 Comment: There is a competition there to be the top scorer in Spain.\n26:39 Comment: Sometimes you get forward saying it's not really important.\n26:42 Comment: It's all about the team.\n26:44 Comment: No, I don't believe that.\n26:46 Comment: Of course you want to be the top scorer.\n26:49 Comment: In previous years it's acted almost as a consolation prize\n26:52 Comment: when Barcelona have won the league\n26:54 Comment: and Real Madrid have had Cristiano Ronaldo as top scorer.\n26:57 Comment: Likewise with Messi, vice versa.\n26:59 Comment: It's a competition.\n27:5 Comment: As the shot comes in, another shot from Cruz.\n27:10 Comment: This one not troubling Rico.\n27:12 Comment: The crowd a little bit subdued by that third goal from Ronaldo.\n27:25 Comment: Just get the feeling they've set the other two.\n27:28 Comment: Scoring in the next few minutes.\n27:30 Comment: Of course it's also the possibility that they score.\n27:33 Comment: A late challenge there from Reyes.\n27:37 Comment: Real Madrid on the attack again with Cristiano Ronaldo.\n27:41 Comment: Inside to Marcel looking for the one-two.\n27:43 Comment: Doesn't quite come off.\n27:45 Comment: And Sevilla will look to counter.\n27:47 Comment: They give the ball away.\n27:49 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo.\n27:59 Comment: They give the ball away in midfield.\n28:1 Comment: Carvajal.\n28:3 Comment: Bale looking to return the ball to the full-back.\n28:9 Comment: Sevilla can see the throw-in.\n28:15 Comment: Could the longest running home streak in European football\n28:20 Comment: be coming to an end?\n28:21 Comment: Sevilla haven't lost since February of 2014\n28:25 Comment: at the Sanchez Pizjuan.\n28:29 Comment: Sevilla.\n28:37 Comment: Suarez.\n28:39 Comment: Pins the ball inside.\n28:41 Comment: It's Fidel now on the ball for Sevilla.\n28:43 Comment: Looking for Suarez.\n28:45 Comment: Varane with the header away.\n29:0 Comment: Lovely ball from Reyes.\n29:2 Comment: Finds Alish Vidal.\n29:4 Comment: Vidal pings it in.\n29:6 Comment: It was going towards the near post.\n29:8 Comment: They're claiming because he has got on it.\n29:12 Comment: I think he went straight into the side netting.\n29:18 Comment: He might get a touch for the other side of the net.\n29:21 Comment: He doesn't even do that.\n29:24 Comment: There we see again Bale's ball.\n29:26 Comment: It's a perfect ball for Cristiano Ronaldo.\n29:29 Comment: It comes after having to hold off the challenge from Reyes.\n29:35 Comment: Some fine work by Gareth Bale.\n29:37 Comment: Sergio Ramos is down.\n29:45 Comment: He's given away the free kick.\n29:47 Comment: Oh, dear me.\n29:50 Comment: Following through.\n29:55 Comment: Ramos in some pain.\n29:57 Comment: There's more blood.\n29:59 Comment: Echoes of the first half.\n30:1 Comment: Ramos was a player who got head-busted in the back of the\n30:4 Comment: head by Krajcovac.\n30:6 Comment: Krajcovac drawing blood.\n30:8 Comment: Ramos now has a bloody nose to deal with himself.\n30:14 Comment: The beer was the only thing that was left.\n30:17 Comment: It may well be that Ancelotti will have to ask Unai Emery if\n30:21 Comment: they have another mask.\n30:28 Comment: Celebrations there between Ancelotti, Ronaldo and pretty\n30:31 Comment: much all of the team.\n30:33 Comment: What needs is Ramos running along the beach for a nice\n30:36 Comment: romantic scene in slow-mo.\n30:38 Comment: It doesn't look as if Ramos is going to be able to get a\n30:47 Comment: nose anywhere near as serious as Krajcovac in the first half.\n30:50 Comment: That black shirt useful as well.\n30:52 Comment: Covering up the blood stain that is far more obvious on a white\n30:56 Comment: Sevilla shirt than it is on a black Real Madrid shirt.\n30:59 Comment: More substitutions.\n31:1 Comment: Ibra and Romero coming on.\n31:3 Comment: I think Unai Emery would have wanted to have brought a\n31:7 Comment: With the score at 2-1 or 2-2.\n31:9 Comment: Just a little bit more in the game for Sevilla because he can\n31:12 Comment: score late on.\n31:13 Comment: He has a great

    "summary": "In an electrifying encounter at the Estadio Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán, Sevilla locked horns with Real Madrid in a match that kept fans on the edge of their seats right until the final whistle. This high-stakes game saw Real Madrid narrowly edge past Sevilla with a 3-2 victory, largely thanks to the heroics of Cristiano Ronaldo, who scored a crucial hat-trick. \n\nThe match kicked off with Sevilla playing in their traditional all-white kit, showcasing a starting eleven primed for a fierce contest. Real Madrid, donned in all black, brought along a strong bench with the likes of Gareth Bale and goalkeeper Keylor Navas. Sevilla started on the front foot, with Jose Antonio Reyes, a seasoned veteran and former Real Madrid player, leading by example in the early stages. At the 10-minute mark, Sevilla earned the first corner of the game, accompanied by a speculative shot from Reyes, showing their intent to take the game to their illustrious visitors.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo had the first opportunity for Real Madrid in the 16th minute, looking to match Lionel Messi in the race for the Pachichi trophy with his 40th goal of the season. However, his free kick effort sailed over the crossbar. Despite early dominance by Sevilla, Real Madrid began to find their rhythm, with Isco and Marcelo linking up well. Ronaldo looked particularly threatening, desperate to break his mini goal drought which was perhaps compounded by some whistles in midweek fixtures against Eibar.\n\nSevilla's defense, marshaled by Mbia, Kala Rico, and Kolo, faced physical tests from Real Madrid's forwards. Chicharito and James Rodriguez worked tirelessly to pierce through Sevilla’s backline. Yet, despite this, Sevilla had significant breakthroughs themselves. Late in the first half, they consistently managed to bypass Real Madrid’s defense, challenged continuously by a vigilant Iker Casillas, aiming to match Zubizarreta's record for the most Liga wins.\n\nThe turning point of the first half arrived in the 32nd minute, when Ronaldo connected beautifully with a cross from Isco. This move displayed a seamless interplay between Marcelo and Isco before Ronaldo applied the finishing touch, leaving goalkeeper Sergio Rico helpless. Real Madrid capitalized yet again a minute later when Ronaldo made it two, leveraging a deft flick from Chicharito and a sublime delivery from James Rodriguez. This double blow within a minute's span disrupted Sevilla's composure and strategically forced them to rethink their approach.\n\nAs the first half was drawing to a close, Sevilla clawed their way back. A contentious penalty was awarded right before the half-time whistle—a mistimed tackle by Sergio Ramos on Aleix Vidal saw Ramos booked and Carlos Bacca stepping up confidently to slot home, reducing the deficit and reigniting Sevilla's hope just before they headed into the locker rooms.\n\nThe second half resumed with both teams adopting cautious approaches initially, though the intensity soon picked up. Sevilla began asserting more pressure, targeting quick breaks and set pieces to unsettle Real Madrid. A couple of close calls went by, with headers and long-range shots by Mbia and Reyes nearly finding the back of the net. On Real Madrid’s side, Ronaldo continued his pursuit of a hat-trick, coming close several times only to be denied either by Rico or narrow misses.\n\nIn the 58th minute, a crucial substitution saw the introduction of Gareth Bale, returning from injury, who replaced Chicharito. Bale’s first impact came almost immediately, reminiscent of a magician pulling off an awe-inspiring trick. The Welshman's precise cross found Ronaldo once again, who leaped magnificently to head the ball back across the path of Rico, completing his hat-trick and putting Real Madrid 3-1 up. It was a masterclass in clinical finishing and a display of why Ronaldo remains one of the most feared forwards in world football.\n\nSevilla did not back down; Unai Emery’s tactical adjustments injected fresh vigor into the side, notably with the introduction of Kevin Gameiro and Vicente Iborra. This paid dividends almost instantaneously when in the 79th minute, Sevilla managed to stage a thrilling counter-attack. Gameiro’s incisive pass set up Aleix Vidal, who in turn found Iborra. The latter's clinical finish rekindled hopes for the home side, as the scoreboard now reflected a tantalizing 3-2 in favor of Real.\n\nThe final ten minutes were frenetic. Sevilla, spearheaded by Reyes and Vidal, surged forward with fervor, creating a series of nail-biting moments inside Real Madrid’s penalty area. Denis Suárez and Fran Tremoulinas tried to unlock Real’s defense with clever interplay, yet Casillas's reflexes and Madrid's resolute defense held firm.\n\nAs the clock ticked down, Real Madrid made defensive substitutions, bringing on Asier Illarramendi to bolster the midfield and ensure defensive solidity. This tactical nuance helped Madrid withstand Sevilla’s onslaught, which didn’t seem to abate until the very last second.\n\nUltimately, Real Madrid’s ability to press effectively and convert key opportunities made the difference. Cristiano Ronaldo’s hat-trick exhibited not only his exceptional talent but also his ability to deliver under pressure and spearhead his team's ambitions. For Sevilla, despite the loss, their performances against one of Europe's most elite clubs demonstrated their tenacity and tactical acumen, laying a solid foundation for their forthcoming domestic and European commitments. Both teams, fortified by this intense battle, march forward with valuable lessons and reinforced conviction.\n\nThe final whistle confirmed Real Madrid’s triumph, Ricardo’s frustration after a spirited comeback falling short palpably clear. A 3-2 scoreline encapsulated a match full of drama, class, and the unending allure that characterizes La Liga.\n"
