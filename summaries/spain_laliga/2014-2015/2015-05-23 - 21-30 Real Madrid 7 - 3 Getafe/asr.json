they are arriving easily, maybe good to finish, no\n12:10 Comment: but with the feeling of danger\n12:15 Comment: Nacho James James and Marcelo\n12:22 Comment: Barceló and Nacho Nacho, who is another of the footballers in the Real squad\n12:27 Comment: Madrid has obviously had to know every minute he has enjoyed\n12:31 Comment: Well, in a very sweet way it must have been something especially pleasant for him\n12:35 Comment: But he is another footballer with projection who claims space who wants space\n12:39 Comment: But I think that today is a reward for Marcelo's ball\n12:46 Comment: Christian\n12:49 Comment: Christian who scores with an excellent tight header that ends inside\n12:55 Comment: Getafe's goal but Marcelo's ball is something to take your hat off to\n13:0 Comment: Marcelo's ball is extraordinary, the shot is also extraordinary, but what we are talking about\n13:5 Comment: The lack of tension, the four defenders are fine\n13:9 Comment: placed well positioned but in the end you practically can't leave\n13:14 Comment: Finish, you're only three meters away, you have the line of defenders, it's fine.\n13:19 Comment: Retreat well but you are too far from lack of lack of tension\n13:24 Comment: competitive that also has to do with the game and of course if you are a Christian\n13:30 Comment: And Marcelo, you let them think, you let them execute, in the end, goals come out of this\n13:36 Comment: Clear level but it is a shot in which Alexis, who is the defender who is more\n13:40 Comment: Nearby it is practically two and a half meters, three meters away from Roberto\n13:44 Comment: Christians have also celebrated it in an obvious way, also thanking a\n13:47 Comment: sector of the stands and the Christian figures that far exceed 30\n13:52 Comment: Goals in favor that Getafe has this season to make a comparison\n13:55 Comment: Well, Christian, right now there are 46 in the league and he is one away from getting the best\n14:1 Comment: record in the entire season since he arrived at real madrid\n14:5 Comment: Yes, he is on his way to achieving his best overall numbers in one\n14:10 Comment: Christian goalscoring season wants to continue progressing in that aspect\n14:15 Comment: ball by javier hernández headbutt by juan rodríguez tony cross\n14:21 Comment: James Marcelo gave him a solution but James has another one in his left boot\n14:27 Comment: That James Rodriguez ball that was half shot and half center Javier\n14:31 Comment: Hernández already touched the ball outside, it was a complicated ball for him\n14:35 Comment: Poisoned goalkeeper because he puts a lot of screws into it, it seems like he's going out and in the end\n14:39 Comment: With that thread he almost gets into the field and Caesarito is a player with\n14:44 Comment: A lot of honor and he fights for all the balls because he was close to being able to\n14:48 Comment: Not to shoot but to throw the ball back, I don't know, it would be messing with someone's head\n14:55 Comment: footballer like Cristiano Ronaldo's achievements in terms of scoring figures\n14:59 Comment: I would say that they are amazing, they break with any precedent but of course that\n15:7 Comment: satisfaction of making that figure so high and not having specified it in this case in\n15:12 Comment: The league title for the footballer has to be a contradiction, it doesn't have to\n15:15 Comment: that being strange to live is a contradiction, it is true that in the end they have\n15:19 Comment: United at this time two true leaders and monsters at the end at the level of\n15:26 Comment: players at the level of scorers and it has to do with consistency in the end\n15:31 Comment: We are talking about the league that I think a little the one that marks you\n15:36 Comment: competition that marks your regularity and in the end Madrid that lasted four months\n15:39 Comment: sensational for the last three months it has not been good and the one that has been more\n15:44 Comment: Barcelona has been regular and in the end the league wins but in the end you are\n15:47 Comment: Talking about great teams with great numbers, offensive teams with great numbers\n15:51 Comment: players and Cristiano is a very ambitious player who has natural talent\n15:56 Comment: For the goal the league ends leaving each team in its place in the place in\n16:2 Comment: What they deserve in the case of Getafe, those 37 points have given them the\n16:6 Comment: salvation a salvation that has cost others to bind has cost them more\n16:10 Comment: And they have obtained it with 35 and I am talking about the sports team from La Coruña and Granada\n16:16 Comment: what they have achieved today\n16:19 Comment: Pablo Sarabia the ball from behind, which is not good for him to take the ball\n16:22 Comment: Pedro León and the clearance is a clearance that can have consequences not because\n16:27 Comment: Chicharito doesn't arrive, I think Getafe got a cushion of points\n16:30 Comment: important with the work of Kike Flores and then with the problems\n16:34 Comment: institutional cases of players who leave a coach and Kike enters\n16:38 Comment: Kike gives the team a boost, gets a good cushion of points and then later\n16:44 Comment: With Kike's departure, the team has not yet achieved a good dynamic\n16:49 Comment: Positive but he did have that cushion that gave him the possibility\n16:53 Comment: Also those at the bottom were very hooked, they didn't finish adding up and well\n16:57 Comment: Well, since Getafe finished badly, the league was worth it with those\n17:2 Comment: 37 points to save the particular thing is that a team changes or\n17:7 Comment: See three coaches on your bench one season saying it's not a team and no\n17:11 Comment: It's going through very difficult times and they were looking for a solution, but it hasn't been like that\n17:15 Comment: He left because he had better professional prospects and\n17:19 Comment: Well, for Getafe, I combine that situation\n17:23 Comment: And the fact that he arrived and the team didn't get worse is more like you said, it was going well\n17:27 Comment: situation but also and there I do not get involved in other situations he left\n17:31 Comment: team and in the end Pablo Pablo Franco is the one who has come to finish the job\n17:35 Comment: but atypical if it has been the season and as a rule when there is a team in this one\n17:40 Comment: situation and there is a change and you change coaches three times as a rule it is because\n17:44 Comment: You have the second division for sure because in the end the planning has been\n17:48 Comment: Good because the work has not been good and when you change coaches because\n17:52 Comment: The team doesn't work anymore, in the long run, all the work does no more than no\n17:56 Comment: Don't let it reach you to save you, Sergio Escudero, his center hits\n18:0 Comment: arbeló to a corner kick we are at 18 in the first half\n18:4 Comment: the second half of the race\n18:7 Comment: Real Madrid is winning, Real Madrid is close to Cristiano Ronaldo\n18:10 Comment: Goal that came in the 13th minute, the corner for Getafe\n18:17 Comment: Real Madrid is going to place the ball to Pablo Saravia, who defends with all his strength\n18:23 Comment: The team in the area does not pick up anyone, Getafe leaves it there one last time\n18:27 Comment: A last defender Sergio Escudero is effective to avoid problems in the\n18:33 Comment: Ball cleared by the Portuguese, Gesee takes it, that ball ends up coming out.\n18:42 Comment: Getafe is playing, Diego Castro. Diego Castro is improving, breaking down as he goes.\n18:49 Comment: He widens the field a little by playing with Pedro León.\n18:52 Comment: Pedro León directs the ball to his leg, less good to the left.\n18:57 Comment: Juan Rodríguez, Vigaray.\n18:59 Comment: Vigaray who connects again with Juan Rodríguez, Marcelo crosses.\n19:7 Comment: I insist, Pedro León's position is that he is forgetting about the band.\n19:10 Comment: The band is for Vigaray when Getafe attacks.\n19:13 Comment: Pedro León always in interior positions.\n19:14 Comment: Yes, especially because since Real Madrid is letting him play, they are letting him develop,\n19:20 Comment: Well, he goes inside to try to find superiority with the ball\n19:23 Comment: And that his team is capable of combining and being close to the area.\n19:28 Comment: He is a man who has shots, a man who can knock down a wall at a given moment.\n19:32 Comment: The space and breadth are left to Vigaray.\n19:36 Comment: I think Iker Casillas, Roberto didn't understand anything and neither did I.\n19:39 Comment: It seemed to me that the assistant was indicating a goal kick\n19:42 Comment: And in the end this ended in a corner.\n19:45 Comment: But as you indicated, the captain of Real Madrid, there we see the shot,\n19:48 Comment: How he catches the ball out of bounds, but it had already gone out,\n19:52 Comment: This is what Iker Casillas was telling him.\n19:53 Comment: Ball that Ramendi, a Getafe player, had already driven.\n19:56 Comment: He throws himself at Pedro León.\n19:59 Comment: Cristiano clears the ball again.\n20:2 Comment: That has cleared it up, I think that with him...\n20:3 Comment: With the shoulder.\n20:5 Comment: With your back, shoulder.\n20:6 Comment:  Well.\n20:7 Comment: It's a strange punt.\n20:8 Comment: Well, in the end this type of player has so much talent that they are capable of\n20:13 Comment: Handling up to that kind of beating.\n20:15 Comment: There are a lot of surfaces, well, drive.\n20:18 Comment: Look with your back.\n20:19 Comment: He took a risk there.\n20:20 Comment: No, but in the end all types of surfaces are controlled.\n20:23 Comment: Illarra, James.\n20:27 Comment: James Rodríguez with Marcelo.\n20:28 Comment: Marcelo as a heel for Cristiano Ronaldo.\n20:31 Comment: Cristiano sees James' movement as having unfolded well.\n20:34 Comment: James, who has concentrated, who codina clears.\n20:36 Comment: Marcelo doesn't capture, that's how Illarra does it.\n20:38 Comment: The shot was good, it hit Juan Rodríguez.\n20:41 Comment: Yes, what a good move.\n20:42 Comment: As Marcelo has abandoned the band, he has gone in search of the finishing touch because\n20:46 Comment: James has also come to try to combine with Cristiano.\n20:49 Comment: And Marcelo has tried with the ball.\n20:52 Comment: And Marcelo has tried to find that finish.\n20:54 Comment: We miss the moment when James has arrived.\n20:56 Comment: In that first post to Chicharito, who in the end is the center forward.\n21:0 Comment: And he is the one who has to go look for that possibility of center, which in the end by play has occurred.\n21:6 Comment: Toni Kroos.\n21:9 Comment: The German's ball headed by Cristiano.\n21:11 Comment: That ball is very high.\n21:13 Comment: Kroos taking the corner.\n21:16 Comment: In this Real Madrid, about how much has been said in this epilogue of the season,\n21:21 Comment: It is perhaps the excess kilometers on our legs when we see those who are absent again,\n21:24 Comment: including Ancelotti.\n21:25 Comment: We said the excess kilometers on the legs of some footballers.\n21:29 Comment: How the casualties have also weighed on some very specific areas of the field\n21:33 Comment: throughout the season.\n21:35 Comment: Kroos is on the list of untouchables, of irreplaceables at Real Madrid.\n21:40 Comment: Man, I think Kroos, especially because he has surprised us all in that care.\n21:45 Comment: Fredy Néstronza, Néstronza's ball.\n21:47 Comment: Pepe, Marcelo and the aforementioned Toni Kroos who snatches the ball from Diego Castro.\n21:52 Comment: He didn't see Diego Castro coming.\n21:54 Comment: Diego Castro puts an intelligent ball in front.\n21:56 Comment: Medi Laufen, who prevented the Algerian's comfortable shot.\n22:0 Comment: If you try, what a goal.\n22:1 Comment: Sergio Escudero, great goal from Escudero.\n22:4 Comment: Tremendous left foot that bounces in front of Casillas.\n22:8 Comment: And Getafe equalized the match with a goal of great quality, 1-1.\n22:13 Comment: I think it's a goal that maybe there are two or three players ahead of that shot.\n22:22 Comment: And it could bother Casillas because it is a very far shot.\n22:27 Comment: Look how far Escudero hits it.\n22:30 Comment: Yes, it is true that there are two players, I think, ahead.\n22:32 Comment: Casillas stares, but it's a very distant shot.\n22:38 Comment: Let's see how Pepe turns out again.\n22:40 Comment: Maybe the hitting is really good.\n22:43 Comment: And well, a great goal.\n22:46 Comment: Roberto is once again entering the realm of sensibilities.\n22:50 Comment: I suppose you brought the applause meter on one side and the whistle meter on the other.\n22:55 Comment: Because lately this is starting to become almost common at the Bernabéu.\n22:58 Comment: Practically any intervention that Iker Casillas makes begins to be a trial.\n23:2 Comment:  Whistles appeared after Real Madrid's goal was conceded, but little by little they were silenced by applause.\n23:7 Comment: It's over.\n23:9 Comment: What it was like these seconds after the goal.\n23:12 Comment: But there is still that pulse, that little trial in the stands around Iker Casillas.\n23:17 Comment: With whistles, with applause, depending on the intervention he makes.\n23:20 Comment: One or the other appears sooner.\n23:22 Comment: I'm not going into evaluating, obviously it's not my job,\n23:26 Comment: what the public who pays for a ticket says on the playing field or values ​​or reacts.\n23:33 Comment: What is true is that it's up to you professionals.\n23:36 Comment: You have to live with it.\n23:38 Comment: Let's go see that ball.\n23:39 Comment: Arbeloa touched back at the end.\n23:40 Comment: It's going to come out on the side.\n23:41 Comment: Yeah, man.\n23:42 Comment: I believe that, and especially a man like Casillas, a veteran, mature player,\n23:46 Comment: Who knows he's been here for so many years.\n23:48 Comment: And you know that in this situation there is a demand.\n23:51 Comment: He knows he's as old as he is.\n23:54 Comment: The possibility that there will be a change and that a young goalkeeper

the season being\n43:38 Comment: headline, shot out, le\n43:40 Comment: the loose ball drops,\n43:42 Comment: precisely the one referred to\n43:44 Comment: Pedro León, to Murciano, his\n43:46 Comment: shot near the left post,\n43:48 Comment: all the balls are there\n43:50 Comment: shocking Getafe when there is\n43:52 Comment: a rejection, all of them\n43:54 Comment: They are picking up the footballers\n43:56 Comment: by Pablo Franco.\n43:58 Comment: Getafe is more attentive to the\n44:0 Comment: shops played, the balls\n44:2 Comment: divided, the team that\n44:4 Comment: He wins because he is more attentive to\n44:6 Comment: What happens, be more attentive to\n44:8 Comment: transitions with the ball,\n44:10 Comment: is more attentive to\n44:12 Comment: transitions without the ball and good\n44:14 Comment: In this case it is noted that the one who\n44:16 Comment: Getafe is more involved,\n44:18 Comment: then it has the limitations that\n44:20 Comment: He has, but Getafe\n44:22 Comment: we count the possibilities of\n44:24 Comment: shots on goal taking in\n44:26 Comment: He says he has had the last few\n44:28 Comment: three goals of the season,\n44:30 Comment: what makes us think\n44:32 Comment: that Getafe is a team that\n44:34 Comment: He has had a great performance.\n44:36 Comment: All season long\n44:38 Comment: He had 30 goals, he has 3 today,\n44:40 Comment: takes 10% of all\n44:42 Comment: I had done it in 37 days\n44:44 Comment: previous.\n44:46 Comment: More than striking result,\n44:48 Comment: Squire who arrives alone, centers\n44:50 Comment: Squire, touch Gesé's veil,\n44:52 Comment: Gesé crosses his path\n44:54 Comment: Diego Castro, he doesn't see that there was\n44:56 Comment: Teixeira Betien is missing in the\n44:58 Comment: second part, when I insist\n45:0 Comment: are the interpretations of the\n45:2 Comment: Colleges, but there is Teixeira\n45:4 Comment: He is rigorous and interprets it\n45:6 Comment: another way, because you can get in\n45:8 Comment: in an expulsion Gesé that has been\n45:10 Comment: warmed by previous action.\n45:12 Comment: It's gotten hot, it has to do\n45:14 Comment: with youth, before\n45:16 Comment: remained stopped because there is no\n45:18 Comment: I understand that they didn't whistle one\n45:20 Comment: missing which I think was not\n45:22 Comment: missing and the next action then\n45:24 Comment: The Getafe player has\n45:26 Comment: Stolen that ball, he did it\n45:28 Comment: a good return and for me it is\n45:30 Comment: The yellow one is well taken.\n45:34 Comment: There Teixeira Betien tried\n45:36 Comment: reduce tensions, let the tone\n45:38 Comment: It was a little more relaxed,\n45:40 Comment: I guess you saw that cardboard\n45:42 Comment: Yellow and Pedro León who has\n45:44 Comment: a free kick in one\n45:46 Comment: dangerous and very position\n45:48 Comment: favorable to their conditions.\n45:51 Comment: Minute 45 completed, almost a\n45:53 Comment: More minute, and the team\n45:55 Comment: Teixeira Betien, who has\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: You know, mobile landline, fiber with 300 megabytes and now you get a free smartphone and\n0:4 Comment: Form yourself at 900, 200, 182 and you will win. The second period that has started begins this\n0:12 Comment: The second half we will see if it has the same traces as the first half, unpredictable and\n0:16 Comment: Full of goals and what we can already see from Roberto Rodríguez is that there has been a new change.\n0:22 Comment: And also in the defensive zone it is now Arbeloa who has stayed directly in the locker room,\n0:28 Comment: Carvajal takes his place, let's remember that during the first half Pepe had to be replaced by\n0:33 Comment: Varane. A change that probably also responds to some type of physical problem and is\n0:39 Comment: At this point in the season, those who have the most and those who have the least already have discomfort, complications and\n0:46 Comment: Some who already reach the limit. Perhaps Arbeloa has had an action with Escudero, a divided ball\n0:53 Comment: He complained about a blow, it could have been that action. Be careful James, he had taken advantage of a good\n0:57 Comment: First touch from Cristiano, Jordi Codina saves. Codina tried to surprise with it\n1:3 Comment: Long kick with the hand, the ball did not reach Pablo Sarabia, very fast Dani Carvajal.\n1:10 Comment: Nacho, the Real Madrid defense now formed by Marcelo on the left, Carvajal on the right,\n1:15 Comment: Nacho and Varane are the centre-backs. Guillermo Mendy, Kroos and James, the one who hasn't touched anything is\n1:26 Comment: Pablo Franco, the Getafe coach who today has a bench full of kids. Normal\n1:32 Comment: Also because his team has responded well. Marcelo crosses, Cristiano hits the post, he doesn't reach the goal\n1:38 Comment: Rejected ball, James, finally because of Chicharito. Real Madrid made the fourth, they were close to\n1:44 Comment: Christian makes it the fourth, but the prize ends up going to Javier Chicharito Hernández, 4-3.\n1:52 Comment: Yes, we were commenting that it's normal that it doesn't change, Getafe had played at a good level,\n1:57 Comment: But well, now there is possibly Real Madrid, who will have talked about it at half-time,\n2:3 Comment: It's going to give him more intensity, more rhythm, especially without the ball, with the ball the team has played\n2:8 Comment: Well, maybe he lacked intensity and good ball circulation, but I was good with this goal\n2:13 Comment: I think the team is going to be more comfortable and then what, well, if Madrid lowers the intensity\n2:20 Comment: Getafe is going to get involved, because Getafe knows that it is an opportunity to enjoy a great stadium.\n2:27 Comment: It is the fourth of Carlo Ancelotti's team, Javier Hernández who continues to add, Roberto\n2:34 Comment: Seventh goal in the league. Yes, a Chicharito who is saying goodbye to Real Madrid in this way, since at\n2:39 Comment: In the end the white team did not exercise, at least it has not made it official, if it has done so,\n2:43 Comment: The option I had to buy him from Manchester United, let's remember that he is on loan, so the\n2:49 Comment: Mexican player leaves Real Madrid after this match and you were talking about Chavales,\n2:54 Comment: which was how Pablo Franco, from Chavales, had practically completed the call as well\n2:59 Comment: There is one on the Real Madrid bench, it is Martín Odegar, who is warming up right now,\n3:3 Comment: It would be the last change that Real Madrid made and it would be the debut of this kid with the\n3:8 Comment: first team. The Norwegian footballer who has already been in the squad has already been in the\n3:11 Comment: bench, but he has not yet played a single official minute with the first team outside\n3:16 Comment: Javier Hernández's game. Well we have already seen him play against Castilla, a technical condition, a talent\n3:21 Comment: Extraordinary, but it doesn't stop him from having anything he has, he has to be very careful, he is in a club\n3:26 Comment: Complicated, it has to have its journey, its time, but I know it is true that it has had a very\n3:34 Comment: Keep an eye on Madrid and he is a player with a great future. Cut to Marcelo, send the ball to\n3:41 Comment: Martín Odegar, as it seems to be the closest pronunciation to Norwegian.\n3:49 Comment: Although it seems to me that at this point learning Norwegian is not so difficult anymore.\n3:55 Comment: Rafael Varane, sending the ball out, four minutes into the second half, a second half\n4:0 Comment: Started with the goal scored by Javier Hernández. That Getafe bench, as we said,\n4:5 Comment: full of very young people, Jona, Velázquez, Babá, Ibiastra and Peremilla and Alex Felipe.\n4:12 Comment: The ball that could not be reached as Juan Rodríguez intended when he was looking for the shot.\n4:18 Comment: Juan Rodríguez and Nacho have a friction there, while Seco goes strong for the ball, Sergio Escudero.\n4:28 Comment: Well, now, well, Getafe takes out, I thought they took out Madrid.\n4:31 Comment: Launch error, Illa Ramendi, surprised Gesé, Juan Rodríguez arrives, Illa Ramendi finishes\n4:39 Comment: Capturing that ball, good pass for Javier Hernández, Gesé, Cristiano, Marcelo on the side\n4:45 Comment: On the contrary, he demanded that Cristiano give him back one of the many things he was giving him\n4:49 Comment: Marcelo to Cristiano, he is giving him great balls. Dani Carvajal, Javier Hernández,\n4:54 Comment: Javier Hernández-Gesé, we'll see if he can get there, he manages to prevent the ball from coming out but\n4:59 Comment: Teixeira also has, what he does is indicate the foul on Chicharito.\n5:5 Comment: It seems to me that Madrid has Dani Carvajal, a full-back with a lot of future, with a lot of experience,\n5:11 Comment: That when, with room for improvement, that when he is capable of all that he has as a footballer and\n5:19 Comment: As a good defender, rest assured, I believe that at a certain moment he rushes,\n5:24 Comment: But when he has that peace of mind to play, because he has football too, it will be a\n5:28 Comment: Great side. But there will be competition next season. Well, it is what it is\n5:35 Comment: Thinking that he plays for the team he plays for, in the end a Madrid team, double bet\n5:41 Comment: Always and they have great players. Getafe did not place the barrier well on the free kick\n5:47 Comment: What Cristiano achieved, there are James and Cristiano, it's going to be the Colombian, it doesn't matter how he places the\n5:54 Comment: barrier, it doesn't matter if you get on a chair, no one gets there, neither has Codina,\n6:0 Comment: James Rodríguez's shot was perfect, the fifth for Real Madrid. The hit was spectacular,\n6:8 Comment: The subtlety with which he hits it, notice that it is complicated, because you are very close to the line\n6:15 Comment: The large area, because you have little space, because you have a barrier, look how complicated\n6:21 Comment: It's very complicated to get it in, it even goes in at a high speed, but it hits you with a thread,\n6:27 Comment: Look how hard he hits it, beautiful, look how he jumps the Getafe barrier, great goal,\n6:33 Comment: Great goal, it has to do with the quality that this player has. I insist, a packed game\n6:41 Comment: Of goals, of great goals, we are seeing that the bar is very high and that it seems that they are going away\n6:46 Comment: beating every scorer, trying to surpass Real Madrid's previous fifth, eight in the game,\n6:53 Comment: Well, it's an end to the party, Roberto, perhaps not the end to the party that either of these two wanted.\n6:59 Comment: teams, but at the end of the day it is the culmination of a season. The season that at the moment\n7:5 Comment: What he is going to leave is James Rodríguez equal in goals with Bale, because with this one they are 13 in the league,\n7:11 Comment: He wears the same ones as the Welshman and James Rodríguez has been injured for quite some time. I\n7:16 Comment: It seems like James has had a great season, but not just because of the numbers, because of the goals,\n7:21 Comment: Because of what it gives to the team with the ball, without the ball I think we were surprised by the\n7:25 Comment: defensive task and what has been committed for defensive work. Corner kick Pedro León,\n7:32 Comment: Pedro León's ball, Oceana's goalkeeper, was saved and Ramendi was already on the line, a ball that slipped through.\n7:38 Comment: In the end it has to do again with the issue of defensive tension, as part of both\n7:43 Comment: teams and well when you have players of this level you have a great success, you are doing\n7:49 Comment: great goals, but because there is also defensive ease and lack of tension when the teams\n7:55 Comment: They don't have the ball.\n7:58 Comment: Blau Maix, formerly of Bale on the bench, Gareth Bale is not warming up Real Madrid, he has one change left and right now\n8:6 Comment: Seeing the intensity of Odegaard's warm-up and how the match is going, he has many\n8:11 Comment: The Norwegian is honored to be the one who debuts with the Real Madrid first team shirt.\n8:17 Comment: Cristiano, the pass was not accurate towards Javier Hernández, Alexis Ruano has time to arrive.\n8:23 Comment: I think he wants to pass with the outside, which is the surface that is closest to him and the pass is not good.\n8:32 Comment: Baran, Dani Carvajal, José Carvajal, Villarra, Fredy Nestroza charges him, the ball still reaches the feet of Nacho James.\n8:49 Comment: James Rodríguez, who for those who didn't know him, gave a great demonstration in the last world championship.\n8:59 Comment: He already had a brilliant career in Portugal and with Monaco, but with his national team he already presented the credentials clearly.\n9:9 Comment: Real Madrid hired him, I get the feeling that at the time he was one of those signings that perhaps didn't raise so much expectation.\n9:18 Comment: As you said before, this season he has shown everything he has, which is a lot.\n9:25 Comment: The performance has been extraordinary, but especially considering that I was lucky enough to experience it and see it at the U20 World Cup in Colombia four years ago.\n9:35 Comment: You could see what he has, the football he has, the talent he has, but not that spirit of sacrifice and how committed he has been to defensive work.\n9:47 Comment: Footballers who improve, who want to acquire a new dimension. It would be a case in that aspect, comparable to that of Isco at Real Madrid.\n9:55 Comment: James steals the ball, James drives the ball until they find the way to the right. Cristiano already receives the use, he hits Cristiano.\n10:2 Comment: This time Cristiano was clear, he ended up having other options that he preferred not to take advantage of, but the shooting option was also clear.\n10:11 Comment: Yes, it was clear, I had a chance, Getafe's defense closed very well, I had the option of unchecking Chicharito.\n10:16 Comment: He was very good at giving him the option from behind, making a very interesting split. Look, the kid is going to come out.\n10:26 Comment: In fact, both Fernando Hierro and Paul Clement have claimed Odegar, so it will be the third and last change for Real Madrid and a debut in the first division that points to the ranks of Real Madrid.\n10:36 Comment: Right now a hug from Fernando Hierro to the Norwegian player and last advice.\n10:39 Comment: What quality Marcelo had, how he carried the ball, he was jumping over obstacles and the ball seemed stuck to his boots.\n10:46 Comment: I think Adolfo Odegar will be the youngest player to make his debut for Madrid, because...\n10:54 Comment: We're talking about 16.\n10:56 Comment: 16 years, yes. The previous one, I think, was Rivera.\n11:0 Comment: So Riberita, right?\n11:2 Comment: Riberita, who was 17 years old at the time. It was in Vigo, I remember, because I played that game, we had been champions of the League in 94 and Valdano understood that he had to make his debut.\n11:14 Comment: Dani Carvajal, who had created a wall with an opponent, had hit the ball at Alexis and it favored Carvajal.\n11:21 Comment: The ball comes out and this change is going to be completed at Real Madrid.\n11:25 Comment: We already warned that this match was going to have other stories beyond the fight for the three points.\n11:32 Comment: And one of the details to take into account and that will be written there in the personal history of Odegar and also of Real Madrid,\n11:40 Comment: It is the Norwegian's debut with the first team at the age of 16.\n11:44 Comment: It's Nacho's turn and I think that moment Roberto has arrived.\n11:48 Comment: Indeed, the referee indicates that they have not yet made the change and the one who is leaving is Cristiano Ronaldo. So the ovation is going to be great.\n12:0 Comment: Well, it is a change with a very clear objective.\n12:3 Comment: May Cristiano leave with a hat-trick in his pocket and receive a unanimous ovation at the Santiago Bernabéu.\n12:13 Comment: Yes, because Cristiano's year has been very good, the numbers have been very good.\n12:19 Comment: They have not reached Madrid to achieve the objectives that are maximum,\n12:25 Comment: But Cristiano's numbers and Cristiano's season have been very good.\n12:31 Comment: 48 goals. That is Cristiano Ronaldo's scoring performance in the League.\n12:37 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo, I insist, is truly outrageous.\n12:42 Comment: It is always said when we see these types of figures, Luis Villa used to talk about the coincidence of time,\n12:48 Comment: of two footballers as different, as special as Leo Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo,\n12:53 Comment: And it is always said, well, it's just another football, it's different from other times.\n12:57 Comment: It gives me the feeling that there is something more.\n12:59 Comment: We are talking about, it is not that they have skipped a football generation,\n13:3 Comment: It's like they have taken, in the case of Cristiano, a step much further.\n13:7 Comment: I think they have taken a step further because in the end...\n13:10 Comment: Let's see, Gesé comes out codina, the ball that went over the baseline,\n13:15 Comment: Gesé, who ended up falling, there is nothing, goal kick.\n13:19 Comment: Yes, we were commenting on Messi and Cristiano, I think you are talking about two players who at this time,\n13:24 Comment: where everything improves tactically, physically, where it is not easy to have imbalances,\n13:31 Comment: They are two players who are totally disruptive to rival teams,\n13:37 Comment: And that in these times is not easy.\n13:40 Comment: Possibly, we are talking, we can compare with great players,\n13:44 Comment: Those great players at that time, let's go from Di Stéfano, Pelé,\n13:48 Comment: At this time they would possibly be great players, we would have to see them,\n13:53 Comment: They would have had to adapt to the speed, the rhythm, the intensity,\n13:56 Comment: But we are talking about two players who I think are going to be,\n13:59 Comment: When they retire, we will talk about players of the level of Pelé, Di Stéfano,\n14:4 Comment: From Cruyff, from this type of players, from Maradona.\n14:9 Comment: Marcelo had to give that ball a lot of screwing if he wanted it to reach Chicharito,\n14:13 Comment: But it is true, in a time when everything has become equal,\n14:16 Comment: Suddenly two strange phenomena appear that break from afar any hint of equality with others.\n14:24 Comment: Cristian who today seems totally relaxed and who has generated tears from that young fan handing over a sweatshirt.\n14:36 Comment: Great detail from Cristiano.\n14:37 Comment: Now he is delivering more, sorry, so you can imagine that this is truly crazy\n14:42 Comment: what's around the Real Madrid bench.\n14:44 Comment: Iker Casillas is going to take out.\n14:48 Comment: Once again it generates sound movements in the grass every time Iker Casillas receives the ball.\n14:54 Comment: Carlos Vigaray, Lassen, Odegar intercepts, Odegar falls to the ground...\n15:2 Comment: Let's see Toni Kroos, sorry, Odegar has fallen on the right side.\n15:5 Comment: I was the wrong blonde.\n15:7 Comment: Yes, physically they are that far alike.\n15:12 Comment: Martín Odegar that in the end Luis, the general of football fans, followers of Spanish football,\n15:19 Comment: They have heard a lot about him, but in the end what is the position, what is the place, what is the function that he can contribute when Sarabia is hit badly,\n15:27 Comment: That ball goes and it was also out of play.\n15:30 Comment: What is today's football?\n15:31 Comment: Yes, I think Odegar is a player, compared to a player on the squad, a player like James,\n15:37 Comment: a player like Isco, creative players who have great technical quality, but have great vision,\n15:44 Comment: They already understand because of their age, they understand what is needed at all times.\n15:50 Comment: And well, it is true that what we were talking about before, no matter how old it is, it has room for improvement,\n15:55 Comment: He is in a complicated, difficult club, he is playing for Castilla, he has not had it easy at Castilla,\n16:0 Comment: because the second division B is very complicated and especially for young players.\n16:6 Comment: And well, I think that Madrid signed a talent, but that it has to go little by little, it has to polish it.\n16:13 Comment: Real Madrid-Castilla that was looking for promotion, returns to the second division, in the options that it ended up losing,\n16:19 Comment: In the final stretch. The truth is that the incorporation of Odegar, who will surely join Real Madrid,\n16:26 Comment: It was to look for that qualitative leap and achieve that promotion, because in the end it has not had that desired effect.\n16:33 Comment: Meanwhile, in these last moments, what you are saying about Odegar,\n16:36 Comment: Cristiano had to distribute 5 to 6 sweatshirts, from the bench to the public,\n16:40 Comment: until it's finally gone, and gone, and gone.\n16:43 Comment: Well, nothing, holiday, right? Cristiano has understood it that way,\n16:48 Comment: After his substitution, after his hat-trick, Chicharito and Alexis.\n16:52 Comment: They have been quick to react, Alexis Ruano, Codina, Sergio Escudero.\n17:0 Comment: The getafe that has been able to be involved in the young players' floor,\n17:6 Comment: But the last two goals, Chicharito's and James's,\n17:9 Comment: They are in a splendid direct foul.\n17:13 Comment: They have once again put ground in the middle in favor of Real Madrid,\n17:16 Comment: a margin that already seems difficult for Getafe to cut,\n17:21 Comment: But that's where Pablo Franco's team is.\n17:23 Comment: Fredy Nestroza steals from Odegar, but Pedro Ramos receives the ball,\n17:28 Comment: and the getafe, the getafe, the getafe, the getafe, the getafe, the getafe, the getafe,\n17:33 Comment: Nestroza steals from Odegar, but Pedro León receives the ball.\n17:38 Comment: Pedro León, Diego Castro, shoots with his left foot, hits a defender-corner.\n17:45 Comment: Getafe is going to continue insisting.\n17:47 Comment: He is coming to the Bernabéu, we said it at the beginning of the broadcast,\n17:50 Comment: with an important motivation, even if nothing is at stake,\n17:53 Comment: because it means playing in this stadium, and he will continue to insist.\n17:56 Comment: Another thing is for Madrid to lower its intensity and for Getafe to get into the possibility again,\n18:1 Comment: That he could score a goal, but it has to do with what he can,\n18:5 Comment: with the rhythm and intensity that he puts into Madrid.\n18:7 Comment: If Madrid goes down, Getafe has a chance to get in.\n18:12 Comment: Corner kick, the strategy actions that are being\n18:16 Comment: a permanent source of opportunities for getafe.\n18:20 Comment: Autopase, Sarabia and Yarra, who puts his body in, but Sarabia fights,\n18:24 Comment: The remote, in the mouth, from Alexis' goal, out.\n18:28 Comment: It seemed more difficult for the goal to be away from the goal than inside.\n18:33 Comment: I think that Alexis, who is not used to being in that situation to top it all off,\n18:37 Comment: because in the end there is a very center forward position,\n18:40 Comment: I don't know if he didn't believe in Sarabia, but then he tried with him...\n18:45 Comment: Of course, he had to correct his posture, he tried with the outside, but it didn't work.\n18:49 Comment: I think he didn't have much faith in giving Sarabia continuity in the play.\n18:55 Comment: Escudero, Odegaard, who limited Escudero's margin of movement,\n19:1 Comment: Carvajal, Carvajal and Gesé steal.\n19:4 Comment: Martin Odegaard, who can't get hold of the ball, Escudero is very fast,\n19:9 Comment: Gesé has remained there touched, also now a Getafe footballer,\n19:13 Comment: Specifically Sergio Escudero, both already on their feet and recovered.\n19:18 Comment: There are two players, well three, Nacho, Ilarra, Gesé,\n19:24 Comment: Cichari had participated more in all the last games,\n19:27 Comment: And the one who is at the best level I really like Ilarra,\n19:30 Comment: I have the feeling that it is at a good level,\n19:33 Comment: And perhaps the one he notices the most who hasn't played for a while is Gesé,\n19:37 Comment: Nacho is always a compliant man, he is firm in that defense,\n19:43 Comment: But the one who is having a harder time is Gesé.\n19:46 Comment: We are informed from Real Madrid that tests will be carried out on Pepe tomorrow,\n19:49 Comment: since the area is in the ischium, of the left leg,\n19:53 Comment: and tests will be carried out, and that in Arbeloa's case it was simply a blow,\n19:56 Comment: With which we understand that it was in that play with Escudero,\n19:59 Comment: About ten minutes from the end of the first half,\n20:1 Comment: where problems occurred on the side.\n20:3 Comment: Thank you Roberto, the updated medical report after Pepe and Arbeloa's physical problems,\n20:11 Comment: Vigaray, forces me to make an effort that I think I no longer opted for,\n20:16 Comment: Pedro León had to go for that ball from Vigaray,\n20:19 Comment: and it was already forced,\n20:21 Comment: Kroos, great ball towards James Rodríguez,\n20:24 Comment: Gesé goes to the middle,\n20:25 Comment: A little more open on the right, Chicharito, and also Martín Odegaard,\n20:29 Comment: Javier Hernández, rehearses from afar, Codina stops.\n20:33 Comment: Well, from now on possibly,\n20:36 Comment: match in which individual actions are seen,\n20:39 Comment: in which I play collectively, there will be collective play,\n20:42 Comment: But there are players who try situations,\n20:44 Comment: That maybe in other situations, at other times,\n20:47 Comment: They are not going to try them, and now possibly how the game is,\n20:50 Comment: And since it's the last game,\n20:53 Comment: There are going to be situations like this,\n20:55 Comment: to try things that in other situations,\n20:57 Comment: with more tension, with more demand,\n21:0 Comment: Well, don't try it.\n21:2 Comment: The team that Real Madrid has on the field right now,\n21:5 Comment: headlines, headlines,\n21:7 Comment: We would talk about Casillas and the two full-backs,\n21:10 Comment: James, When Gesé Falls,\n21:14 Comment: He has touched the ball, but also a photo-list Vigaray,\n21:16 Comment: Vigaray who has a cardboard that he saw in the first half,\n21:19 Comment: and maybe there I will follow you,\n21:22 Comment: It's calming down a bit, given the situation,\n21:27 Comment: But we said that, that Real Madrid team that right now,\n21:30 Comment: Kroos, Marcelo, Casillas, Carvajal,\n21:34 Comment: James, they are the very titular ones, let's say.\n21:38 Comment: Taking advantage of James not being Christian,\n21:40 Comment: immediately, immediately he whistled,\n21:43 Comment: He called the foul, he went to look for the ball,\n21:47 Comment: There is Naranjo, perhaps it is not a very good profile for him,\n21:52 Comment: but after the foul he threw,\n21:54 Comment: Well, he will be convinced, he is very confident,\n21:57 Comment: and there are not even two left-handers,\n21:59 Comment: Marcelo is not going to throw it in that situation.\n22:2 Comment: There goes James, hit James,\n22:4 Comment: Codina, how sure, how sure because also,\n22:7 Comment: It seemed like I was doing a grinding, first I went a little to the right,\n22:10 Comment: and then he darted to the left.\n22:12 Comment: Because what James has been looking for is the longest stick,\n22:15 Comment: And before he has looked for the stick over the barrier,\n22:18 Comment: What I wanted to deceive Codina with.\n22:21 Comment: Good pressure from James and theft from Chicharito,\n22:23 Comment: The robbery of Diego Castro is also good now,\n22:26 Comment: Who needs Marcelo.\n22:31 Comment: And Diego Castro takes it, Lazen.\n22:36 Comment: Escudero tried a roulette,\n22:38 Comment: that ends Escudero on the ground,\n22:41 Comment: and with the lack of James Rodríguez.\n22:44 Comment: I'm really liking James' attitude,\n22:47 Comment: Look, I could, with the result as it is,\n22:50 Comment: and it is having a lot of activity,\n22:52 Comment: He's putting a lot of energy into it,\n22:54 Comment: especially without the ball, helping the team.\n22:58 Comment: Sarabia, Pedro León,\n23:2 Comment: Vigaray, Pedro León.\n23:5 Comment:  From tomorrow,\n23:7 Comment: that period opens,\n23:12 Comment: in which many footballers,\n23:14 Comment: They are simply finishing off the last days of commitment with their teams,\n23:18 Comment: others will head towards the Copa América,\n23:21 Comment: Let's see that ball, it goes high.\n23:24 Comment: The shot with full intention,\n23:26 Comment: The Pablo Sarabia squad has searched.\n23:29 Comment: We said that it will be that interval,\n23:31 Comment: in which some are already facing vacations,\n23:33 Comment: other international commitments,\n23:35 Comment: of a different nature,\n23:37 Comment: some competitive, some not.\n23:39 Comment:  And of course,\n23:41 Comment: names and rumors,\n23:43 Comment: future of each one of them,\n23:45 Comment: All of that is going to be present.\n23:47 Comment: A very long summer, especially in Madrid,\n23:50 Comment: where there have been no titles,\n23:52 Comment: and when there are no titles,\n23:54 Comment: In the end what Madrid is looking for is an improvement in the squad,\n23:58 Comment: Possibly there will be a change of coach,\n24:2 Comment: And since that change of coach,\n24:4 Comment: I don't know if it has to do with the philosophy or the game model,\n24:8 Comment: or the way of understanding the game like Ancelotti,\n24:12 Comment: but if not,\n24:14 Comment: A coach will come with a different type of concept,\n24:17 Comment: with another game idea,\n24:18 Comment: Maybe there are players who aren't worth it,\n24:21 Comment: or who wants to give a certain concept to the team,\n24:26 Comment: and look for another type of player,\n24:28 Comment: And from there the speculation will begin.\n24:32 Comment: To what purpose? Roberto has not made any changes,\n24:34 Comment: But he already has the first one ready.\n24:36 Comment: Yes, he is going to use more of the players who come from the reserve team,\n24:39 Comment: It's Felipe, the one who is going to enter, Alex Felipe,\n24:42 Comment: player who has participated in some other match,\n24:45 Comment: He has accumulated minutes, but not too many,\n24:47 Comment: There will be some disputes at the Bernabéu.\n24:49 Comment: You talk about the season being over,\n24:51 Comment: Everything is now with the feeling of the end of the course,\n24:54 Comment: To the point where Cristiano Ronaldo was a few minutes ago\n24:57 Comment: Already signing shirts on the bench.\n25:0 Comment: Well, these are obviously unusual situations,\n25:4 Comment: and that respond to this very particular situation,\n25:7 Comment: Now Cristiano's decision, he shoots, he scores a goal.\n25:13 Comment: The low ball, very tight, crossed far from Codina's reach,\n25:19 Comment: I know he was another of those who needed that beast balm,\n25:24 Comment: What are the goals and the minutes for a footballer who is unemployed for so long.\n25:28 Comment: Adolfo, it usually happens when you say that there is a player who has been around for a while\n25:31 Comment: and that I needed this, and that it just can't be found,\n25:34 Comment: We haven't just seen him active, well, he scored a great goal,\n25:38 Comment: with James, and he finished fantastically, looking for the longest stick,\n25:43 Comment: He scored a great goal, and I think that against Gesee,\n25:46 Comment: which has not had too much continuity, too much confidence,\n25:49 Comment: Well, I think that going on vacation with a goal will give the boy confidence.\n25:56 Comment: And the change in Getafe, so that Alex Philippe has to leave one of them,\n26:0 Comment: and it is Juan Rodríguez who leaves the field of play.\n26:2 Comment: Change player in the same position, Alex Philippe plays, he is a center half.\n26:8 Comment: I like it, Luis.\n26:9 Comment: Yes, he is a player who handles the ball well,\n26:12 Comment: That tactically he positions himself well, that he is very correct with the ball, then good.\n26:19 Comment: Footballer who also took advantage of the Cup matches,\n26:22 Comment: And then so much Bayern and so many absences at Getafe,\n26:26 Comment: In the end, as Roberto said, he hasn't accumulated many minutes,\n26:29 Comment: But he has ended up putting together a bunch of games that have made him visible in the First Division.\n26:34 Comment: I remember him participating more in Quique's time.\n26:41 Comment: Maybe in the last games not so much, but in Quique's time he did count on him more.\n26:48 Comment: Bigaray, Bigaray's mistake, Gesee, James took the ball with his arm, Medi Lazen.\n26:55 Comment: José Antonio Teixeira appreciated it, and you have...\n27:2 Comment: ...6-3, 9 goals in one game.\n27:5 Comment: A result that is more tennis than football.\n27:9 Comment: Odegaard, Dani Carabascal, James, Javier Hernández, Martín Odegaard,\n27:17 Comment: Odegaard controlling with his left foot, Odegaard putting the pass for Chicharito offside.\n27:21 Comment: It wasn't a bad idea.\n27:23 Comment: Yes, what happens is that you have to make that idea in principle,\n27:28 Comment: Then later when he makes the first control and Carabascal gets involved,\n27:32 Comment: So that first control is to make everything slow down.\n27:40 Comment: Codina is going to take out.\n27:44 Comment: The ball from the Getafe goalkeeper, headed by Bigaray, is a gift for James, Javier Hernández,\n27:49 Comment: Hinaldo controls, who came to recover the place, recovered the place and the ball.\n27:55 Comment: Escudero sends the ball out, Odegaard takes it.\n27:59 Comment: The Norwegian with Illaramendi, Varane, Kroos,\n28:5 Comment: Toni Kroos, Gesee, Odegaard, James returns, the left-hander again,\n28:10 Comment: The Norwegian opens for Marcelo to receive, Marcelo centers, James sees Marcelo as this time\n28:16 Comment: Well, perhaps he made the only mistake in the form of a bad center in the entire game.\n28:20 Comment: It's strange, the truth is that it catches your attention that he makes a mistake in a center,\n28:23 Comment: because he is a player who handles that aspect phenomenally,\n28:27 Comment: But hey, now the game is the way it is, there are players who are going to want to finish the game well\n28:33 Comment: and others that maybe, now, as the result is, players who have participated more,\n28:38 Comment: But players who haven't participated as much as Gesee, who just scored,\n28:41 Comment: Odegaard, Illaramendi, well, they want this to continue, others not so much,\n28:47 Comment: And in Getafe the same thing happens, the younger ones, the ones who have fewer minutes,\n28:51 Comment: Well, they are looking forward to this continuing and being able to enjoy being able to play in a field like the Bernabéu.\n29:0 Comment: Kroos, Illaramendi, I think Pablo Franco himself was talking about that\n29:4 Comment: When asked about the last league game for Getafe, already saved,\n29:8 Comment: And he talked about the possibility of playing against a great team like Real Madrid,\n29:12 Comment: on a big stage like the Bernabéu, and this doesn't happen every day for many footballers,\n29:19 Comment: And in fact there are many who may not have this situation in their careers,\n29:24 Comment: I'm talking about players whose football career is perhaps limited to the second division\n29:29 Comment: or at other levels, and in short, it is always an opportunity.\n29:34 Comment: Especially the young players will be looking forward to it, please name me,\n29:38 Comment: which is an opportunity to not make my debut, but play in the first division in a field like the Bernabéu.\n30:4 Comment: Almost definitively, Real Madrid, in their favor, launches James, Sergio Escudero, Dani Carvajal,\n30:13 Comment: Carvajal and Sarabia, there is a lack of Carvajal on Pablo Sarabia.\n30:22 Comment: These are fellow friends, by age they have coincided in Castilla,\n30:29 Comment: I had both of them in the national team of their age, one could have been playing in the club where he started,\n30:38 Comment: and the other has had to look for another accommodation like Sarabia.\n30:43 Comment: Pablo Sarabia that perhaps this year has already been, and that is to say within the anarchy that Getafe has experienced,\n30:50 Comment: For him it has not been a bad year, he has had moments, it is true that he continues perhaps to suffer from those ups and downs,\n30:57 Comment: But he has had brilliant moments.\n30:59 Comment: And above all, I repeat, in Quique's time the team played better, in a more solid team,\n31:5 Comment: And I think it coincided with Sarabia's moment as well,\n31:9 Comment: I think Sarabia will have played, I don't know how many games he will have played, but 30 for sure,\n31:13 Comment: And it seems to me that he is already a player, well, an important player who is establishing himself in the first division.\n31:21 Comment: Fourth season, if memory serves at Getafe,\n31:24 Comment: And as Luis Milla said, he is already one of those players with enough maturity to have responsibility\n31:30 Comment: and be a first division team, in this case Getafe, then we'll see what path Pablo Sarabia takes in football.\n31:38 Comment: Ódega receives the ball from Toni Kroos, touches Azen, it is a pass, which in the end Azen accidentally does,\n31:43 Comment: Ódega who leaves the ball so that he ends up forgiving that...\n31:48 Comment: How great Chicharito, giving him continuity, leaving the ball facing Ódega,\n31:52 Comment: that Ódega has played with Chicharito on that diagonal, and Chicharito has left her very well in her face,\n31:58 Comment: And he has hindered Ódega a little, and well in the end Gese is close to finishing again.\n32:4 Comment: Dior de Codina, who deflected that ball, sent the ball for a corner, Marcelo,\n32:12 Comment: Marcelo looks for the exit along the baseline, the Brazilian's center is too long,\n32:17 Comment: Ódega, Kroos, Rafael Varane, Nacho, now a lot of positional disorder after the last action,\n32:31 Comment: Nacho, I think he tried the trick, Vigaray closed that door and there was a corner kick.\n32:37 Comment: That's what the game is for, so that players can let go, the game is the way it is,\n32:43 Comment: And there are players who try things that are not attempted in other situations.\n32:51 Comment: Toni Kroos\n32:52 Comment: The second change, one of the authors of the game's great goals leaves,\n33:20 Comment: Diego Castro leaves, Papa Diaguara enters.\n33:24 Comment: Dad, who is another of those who has experienced a season between injuries,\n33:29 Comment: and that the different technicians have not counted on him either, for almost an irrelevant season.\n33:37 Comment: It hasn't had much continuity, it was a team that practically always played with a striker,\n33:41 Comment: As a rule, Álvaro Vázquez was the starting player, and this player has not had much continuity.\n33:50 Comment: Álvaro Vázquez had shoulder surgery, I don't know if my memory is failing,\n33:56 Comment: I think the other one had already had surgery, they both had surgery with joint problems,\n34:0 Comment: And that already left him out of the season, but also, like Pablo Sarabia,\n34:5 Comment: He lived his moment of streak, both in terms of football and in his case,\n34:10 Comment: which is what is important for a striker in terms of goals.\n34:14 Comment: He is still the team's top scorer, in fact, Nacho.\n34:20 Comment: Nacho is one of those who today was clear that he wanted to take advantage of his moment,\n34:25 Comment: And he didn't have a moment to relax, Gesee, he scored a goal Gesee,\n34:30 Comment: And we also see him now with explosiveness in this final stretch of the game,\n34:34 Comment: He came in hard, Naldo down, foul and card for Alexis for protesting Teixeira.\n34:45 Comment: Alexis Ruano saw the yellow one.\n34:51 Comment: Naldo explaining to Teixeira what happened in the play.\n34:57 Comment: And the game that took place without cards.\n35:3 Comment: See how the first one arrives.\n35:7 Comment: Naldo anticipates, that's Gesee, he manages to get the ball then Gesee,\n35:15 Comment: He hits the air and ends up tripping over Naldo.\n35:21 Comment: Less than 10 for this match to end, for the season to end Naldo.\n35:31 Comment: Corner for the whites who have margin and from what we are seeing too,\n35:35 Comment: As Luis Milla highlighted, particular desire and ambitions to continue increasing the score,\n35:42 Comment: That's what Carlos Ancelotti's men want.\n35:46 Comment: On this strange day, I insist, it seems like the end of the party,\n35:53 Comment: that the party is over and it is those hours before closing in which\n35:58 Comment: The one who has the most and the one who has the least is already very tired.\n36:2 Comment: There we see Teixeira's yellow.\n36:5 Comment: What we have talked about before, lack of competitive tension that has to do with everything\n36:10 Comment: and the moment you are in and many players wishing it was over,\n36:14 Comment: as asked by the referee and others with those who have had fewer minutes,\n36:18 Comment: trying to take advantage, trying to do things, trying to look for individual situations.\n36:24 Comment: The 38th in which Deportivo de La Coruña and Granada breathed a sigh of relief\n36:28 Comment: Because they have saved the category, Eibar, Almería, Córdoba cannot say the same.\n36:33 Comment: Athletic Club has taken seventh position, Atlético de Madrid has confirmed itself\n36:39 Comment: in the third and Valencia in the fourth.\n36:42 Comment: In short, there were loose ends, ends that have been wrapped up.\n36:48 Comment: Well, there was no cardboard Roberto and now they come in pairs.\n36:52 Comment: In this final stretch of the game, it may be that the referee doesn't want him to get away either,\n36:57 Comment: What I said, this end of the season, this end of the party, these last minutes of the game\n37:2 Comment: And now it was Marcelo who saw the yellow card.\n37:5 Comment: You can now see a preview of the first half.\n37:9 Comment: That foul that Gese committed.\n37:13 Comment: I had left it in the pipeline, but come on, Marcelo, Gese, Alexis, all three reprimanded.\n37:25 Comment: The foul in favor of Getafe.\n37:30 Comment: A very close one, Casillas with problems against Alexis, ends up jamming Iker Casillas.\n37:35 Comment: Casillas launches the counterattack, the ball goes to Javier Hernández, Carvajal runs, he is the fastest.\n37:40 Comment: Chicharito holds on, he looked for the change of direction towards James, but he didn't hit well.\n37:48 Comment: The idea was good, but perhaps having to spend so many minutes on the field,\n37:55 Comment: The hitting was not good because of that, because of the fatigue.\n38:1 Comment: Getafe has prepared the last change, Ibi López.\n38:4 Comment: He is the one who is going to enter the field, another player who has not played many games, who has had minutes.\n38:9 Comment: And the Bernabéu that starts with shouts of Iker Iker.\n38:14 Comment: Well, that's it, isn't it?\n38:16 Comment: Iker Iker, many shout, others whistle.\n38:21 Comment: Well, it's the detail of the fans, and I also think it's deserved,\n38:25 Comment: Because in the end we will see if Iker makes the decision based on what happens,\n38:29 Comment: To stay or not to stay, but I think this is what a man deserves,\n38:33 Comment: of his career, of the years he has been here,\n38:36 Comment: and what he has done for Real Madrid and for Spanish football.\n38:41 Comment: It is Pedro León who leaves so that Ibi comes in, having completed the three changes in both teams.\n38:46 Comment: We only have to look at what you indicated well, in these last minutes of the game,\n38:52 Comment: Those signs, those gestures that players can leave us,\n38:55 Comment: Some of them in this way, for sure, it is already their last game with the Real Madrid shirt.\n39:0 Comment: I insist that many members of Getafe are also experiencing a very similar situation,\n39:7 Comment: some of those transferred, others because they end with a deal,\n39:10 Comment: Many are going to move this Getafe, which I think next season is going to be quite unrecognizable,\n39:16 Comment: And well, starting with Pedro León, we will see what situation he is in after this year,\n39:21 Comment: in which you remember, he was left out.\n39:23 Comment: Yes, I have the feeling too, because I think there is going to be a new project,\n39:26 Comment: because it has to come, there was even talk of some buyers,\n39:30 Comment: some investors who could buy the club,\n39:35 Comment: There will be a new coach, and from the new coach,\n39:39 Comment: I think Getafe has already known, it is already a little on the wire,\n39:45 Comment: With the possibility of being able to go down, he has to strengthen the team,\n39:48 Comment: Because if you don't, you're going to have difficulties.\n39:50 Comment: Alexis, who manages to put his head in front, leave it.\n39:57 Comment: Dani Carvajal, Guillarra Mendy,\n40:2 Comment: Guillarra and Kroos,\n40:5 Comment: Marcelo,\n40:8 Comment: James, receives the Colombian, leans on Nacho,\n40:12 Comment: Toni Kroos of the first sword, James Rodríguez,\n40:15 Comment: James Rodríguez, who scored a goal, and who is now going to be in the center.\n40:20 Comment: Now he has Fuelle left to go in the race and play with Chicharito.\n40:24 Comment: Javier Hernández and Marcelo, again the Mexican, who has also done his part,\n40:28 Comment: Gesé also scored, backheel, Chicharito,\n40:31 Comment: Codina, who puts his leg in the second time, indicates,\n40:34 Comment: Isheira's lack, and you have, a play in which they could have also hurt each other,\n40:39 Comment: Because the footballers were falling there like dominoes.\n40:43 Comment: Gesé, who apologizes to Codina,\n40:46 Comment: and we see Fantasia's play.\n40:49 Comment: It's a Fantasy play, and James is the one who starts it,\n40:52 Comment: and the one who gives it continuity,\n40:54 Comment: from a series of actions, from knocking down walls,\n40:58 Comment: And the one who comes trying to find that second option is James.\n41:3 Comment: We are seeing him very active, eager to finish the season well,\n41:7 Comment: I think that for him, individually, it has been very good.\n41:11 Comment: Missing on that jump,\n41:13 Comment: Sánchales, Felipe,\n41:18 Comment: Pablo Sarabia, Escudero,\n41:21 Comment: Sergio Escudero, who scored a good goal,\n41:24 Comment: Varane, turn the ball to Escudero,\n41:27 Comment: What a good feint and what a good dribble, shoot at Escudero,\n41:30 Comment: That position has taken a hit.\n41:33 Comment: He made a good move,\n41:36 Comment: And he has the confidence of the goal, well, the normal thing is that he is encouraged.\n41:39 Comment: The Real Madrid that is going to finish the season with 92 points,\n41:46 Comment: with 117 goals,\n41:51 Comment: figures from another galaxy,\n41:54 Comment: 37 points for Getafe, saved in the end two above that barrier\n42:0 Comment: of 35.\n42:3 Comment: Kroos,\n42:4 Comment:  James,\n42:6 Comment: Villarramendi,\n42:9 Comment: Dani Carvajal,\n42:13 Comment: Martino Odegar,\n42:16 Comment:  James,\n42:18 Comment: James, who hasn't slowed down at any point in the game, nor has Marcelo.\n42:23 Comment: We were looking, it was also agreed that Madrid had signed a player very similar to\n42:28 Comment: James, very similar to Odegar in the way he moves and plays,\n42:32 Comment: which is Asensio, the Mallorca player,\n42:35 Comment: And I also think he is a great signing, a young player too,\n42:39 Comment: They also have to give him their way, we have to see what Madrid thinks about him,\n42:43 Comment: If you have to give it to a first-edition team so that it has a run,\n42:46 Comment: But a very good-looking player, who has had a very good season in Mallorca.\n42:50 Comment: Juan, you have been part of this club and you know it first hand.\n42:54 Comment: Make any prediction of what is going to happen in terms of movements,\n42:59 Comment: Let's see the center of scale, it's Javier Hernández, very forced.\n43:2 Comment: He said to make forecasts two months from now of the movements that there may be in Real Madrid,\n43:7 Comment: Right now it's science fiction.\n43:9 Comment: It is very complicated, but it is true that there will be movements,\n43:12 Comment: And it is not a match that is going to be done in a period of two months,\n43:15 Comment: It is a match that will take place in three months,\n43:17 Comment: It's science fiction.\n43:19 Comment: It is very complicated, but it is true that there will be movements,\n43:22 Comment: because this club always has the demand and the ambition to win titles,\n43:27 Comment: And when you don't win titles, well, it happens that you're going to look for another new project,\n43:34 Comment: another coach, and you have to see that coach what ideas he comes with,\n43:38 Comment: What do you want, where do you want to be strong in the team,\n43:41 Comment: What type of player are you looking for, and from all that,\n43:43 Comment: Well, possibly the summer, which is going to be long,\n43:46 Comment: Well, the news of the possible players who may come will appear,\n43:49 Comment: The coach who may come. Be careful.\n43:51 Comment: What a great ball from Sarabia! Iker Casillas leaves a great intervention,\n43:56 Comment: and that plebiscite that is taking place in the stands, well now the pros are making themselves more noticeable.\n44:4 Comment: Well, it's also an opportunity for him to make a good intervention,\n44:7 Comment: A great shot from Sarabia, at minute 90, to end the game, I think it's good,\n44:14 Comment: Because in the end people do too, because for him, emotionally, I think it's positive.\n44:19 Comment: Pablo Sarabia, the footballer who has enjoyed this last opportunity,\n44:24 Comment: Medi Lassen, Javier Hernández, Alex Phelip finished off, Alex Phelip lacked forcefulness there,\n44:30 Comment: Marcelo Chicharito took advantage of it, James had a doubtful position,\n44:34 Comment: But the one who took the ball is Jesús, and Marcelo!\n44:38 Comment: Real Madrid scores the seventh, the Real Madrid that has remained hungry until the last seconds,\n44:45 Comment: And Marcelo, I think in the end he gets a well-deserved award, because he is one of those who has shown a lot of ambition.\n44:51 Comment: Yes, a transition of those electric transitions that Madrid has accustomed us to,\n44:56 Comment: With a lot of speed, with a lot of precision, and in which Getafe has not defended it well,\n45:4 Comment: It has cost him a lot already, because it is already 90 minutes away, but a great action by Madrid,\n45:9 Comment: In a dead ball action, which was taken advantage of, Gesey conducted it very well,\n45:14 Comment: He made a great pass, and he wasn't selfish at all,\n45:17 Comment: and that he has always tried to find the best option in the play.\n45:21 Comment: Real Madrid is on its way to closing the season, Roberto, with a win that borders on both,\n45:26 Comment: But scandalous, 10 goals in the game, 7-3 for Real Madrid, and Marcelo cheered.\n    \n\n    #######TASK \n    Provide a factually correct and detailed textual description of the game compiled from the information presented above from different sources, in more than 1000 words.\n            \"Cap:\": represents the captions published in the online portal usually within 30 seconds of the event.\n            \"E:\" represents events recorded exactly after the event happened.\n            \"Comment.\": represents the real-time noisy commentary from the commentator as the game progresses.\n    Don't mention sources of information like commentators or captions, write as if you saw them live.\n    \n    ",
    "summary": "The Estadio Santiago Bernabéu hosted an incredibly thrilling and high-scoring encounter between Real Madrid and Getafe. The match, which saw a staggering 10 goals, ended with Real Madrid triumphing 7-3 in a game that was packed with action, drama, and remarkable moments from both sides.\n\nThe match began with Real Madrid setting the pace early on. As the clock ticked, it was evident that both teams were finding their rhythm, and Getafe seemed comfortable despite Real Madrid's early pressure. The fans at the Bernabéu, though not in full attendance, stood in anticipation, knowing any game involving Real Madrid could turn into a goal fest, and they wouldn’t be disappointed on this occasion.\n\nReal Madrid's Carlo Ancelotti, observed by fans mindful that this might be his curtain call as manager, seemed determined to end the season on an exhilarating high, and his team responded. As the game settled, the searchlight fell on several key players who influenced the entire first half. Despite the reshuffling of coaches and possible squad changes looming, Real Madrid showed professionalism and intent.\n\nThe initial minutes saw Real Madrid looking sharper with their movements, and their intent became clearer when Cristiano Ronaldo made a fine run, although Getafe's defensive line held strong. There was talk of Getafe looking to change their coach, and it seemed evident that some players were eager to cement their positions for the forthcoming reshuffling.\n\nAround the 11th minute, Jesse and Nacho were linking well with Arbeloa and Marcelo, yet it was clear that both teams were evenly matched in the early exchanges. Getafe, under Pablo Franco, deployed a strategic 4-2-3-1 formation, looking compact and ready to counter. Pedro León was playing more centrally, trying to exploit spaces behind Real Madrid's midfield, a move which showed Getafe’s tactical flexibility.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo soon found his stride and, in the 13th minute, demonstrated why he is one of the greatest, scoring with a sublime header from a Marcelo cross. Marcelo's assist was nothing short of perfection, curving the ball exquisitely to meet Ronaldo's head for a clinical finish. The Getafe defense, although well-positioned, could only watch as Ronaldo skillfully found the back of the net. The Bernabéu erupted, acknowledging yet another piece of brilliance from their talisman.\n\nGetafe responded defiantly; their players, aware that Real Madrid’s attacking prowess had them constantly on the back foot, began asserting themselves more aggressively. In the 22nd minute, Sergio Escudero showcased his impressive technical ability by hitting an outstanding shot from distance. His effort ricocheted in front of the goal before nestling in the net, leveling the score at 1-1. Iker Casillas, perhaps unsighted, couldn't prevent the goal.\n\nJust minutes later, Getafe seized another opportunity. Working the ball smartly, they found Medi Lazen at the edge of the box, who struck a fantastic shot past Casillas, making it 2-1. The goal, struck with precision, left the Madrid defense and their supporters momentarily stunned.\n\nIn response, Real Madrid recalibrated and started to put immense pressure on Getafe's goal. Cristiano Ronaldo, unfazed by the sudden deficit, and driven by his relentless hunger for goals, resumed his brilliance. In the 31st minute, Ronaldo equalized for Madrid with a ferociously dipped free-kick. The technique and power he used were awe-inspiring, leaving Codina rooted to the spot. This marked Ronaldo's 47th goal of the season, moving him closer to his personal best.\n\nRonaldo was not done. Shortly after leveling the scores, he was at the center of another Real Madrid attack, controlling a superb pass from Illara Mendy with impeccable ease. Running towards goal, he set Javier Hernández, also known as “Chicharito,” perfectly before Vigaray brought Chicharito down inside the box. The referee pointed to the spot, and Ronaldo completed his hat-trick by coolly converting from the spot, making it 3-2 for Real Madrid.\n\nThe match continued at a manic pace, with Real Madrid's constant attacking putting Getafe under relentless pressure. However, Getafe weren't out of it yet. Moments after Ronaldo's hat-trick, Real Madrid's lingering defensive frailties were exposed. From a Pedro León corner, a scramble ensued, and Medi Lazen found himself unmarked, managing to poke the ball home to make it 3-3. The match at this point was proving to be an unpredictable roller-coaster, maintaining a frenetic tempo and high energy.\n\nAs the second half began, Real Madrid made another tactical substitution with Dani Carvajal replacing Álvaro Arbeloa, who had a blow earlier. The change added fresh legs to Real Madrid's right flank, with Carvajal known for his speed and forward surges.\n\nWithin minutes into the second half, Real Madrid took the lead again. Javier Hernández was on the score sheet after reacting quickly to a rebound from a Cristiano Ronaldo effort that struck the post. The Mexican pounced on the loose ball, slotting it into the net to make it 4-3. The goal, a testament to his poacher's instincts, was celebrated with fervor by the Bernabéu faithful.\n\nReal Madrid continued to press vigorously, and James Rodríguez added his name to the score sheet in spectacular fashion. Taking a free-kick from outside the box, he expertly curled the ball over the wall and into the top corner, leaving Codina no chance. It was a world-class strike that exemplified James' technical brilliance and made it 5-3.\n\nAmidst the entertaining encounters, Carlo Ancelotti decided to bring on Martín Ødegaard, making him one of the youngest ever debutants for Real Madrid. Ødegaard slotted into the creative midfield, his youthful presence and flair drawing applause.\n\nThe tempo did not drop, and soon Gesé, showing his intent throughout, was rewarded. After another fluid move involving Marcelo and James Rodríguez, Gesé found space to calmly finish past Codina, extending Real Madrid’s lead to 6-3. The goal was a relief for Gesé, who had seen limited game time due to injuries but showed glimpses of his potential.\n\nThe game continued with both sides creating chances but Real Madrid's dominance was apparent. Marcelo, one of the standout performers of the match, displayed a remarkable zeal to finish strongly. In the dying moments, after a beautifully orchestrated counter-attack, Marcelo made a marauding run and coolly slotted home to complete the scoring spree. The Brazilian’s goal made it 7-3, capping off a thoroughly entertaining day for Los Blancos.\n\nThis emphatic victory for Real Madrid was not just about winning the three points but sending a message of their potent offensive capabilities. With 92 points and 117 goals in the La Liga campaign, their attacking prowess was unmatched. However, the team also reflected on the season gone by, pondering on what could have been, especially in crucial moments where defensive lapses had cost them dearly.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo’s hat-trick secured his status as the top scorer with an incredible 48 goals in the league, a remarkable achievement by any standard. His performance was pivotal and indicative of his enduring quality and unquenchable thirst for success. James Rodríguez’s contribution, both in terms of goals and overall play, was vital, reaffirming his place in the team’s attacking setup.\n\nFor Getafe, despite the heavy defeat, there were positives to take away. They fought valiantly and managed to breach Real Madrid's defense thrice, something few teams could boast of. The goals from Escudero and Lazen were particularly brilliant, showing the attacking potential within their ranks. This match was a reflective moment, hinting at the changes and rebuilding that lay ahead in the summer.\n\nThe final whistle blew, bringing an end not only to the match but also to Real Madrid's La Liga season. Fans at the Bernabéu, regardless of the season’s underachievement in terms of trophies, had reasons to cheer and celebrate the sheer entertainment and attacking football their team delivered, with dreams of a more successful campaign in hindsight."
