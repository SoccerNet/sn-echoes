and in some\n0:38 Comment: cases thrashed even resoundingly.\n0:41 Comment: Everyone knows each other in the world of football and the Almería players know what\n0:45 Comment: is visiting the Bernabéu, but they also know that in football there is a lot of pure mathematics\n0:52 Comment: Sometimes it doesn't work, so they go find their option.\n0:55 Comment: Carlo Ancelotti's players also know that, they cannot be trusted.\n0:58 Comment: Gesé, Real Madrid's Canarian player, progressing with the ball.\n1:3 Comment: Let's see the start.\n1:4 Comment: It was relying a lot on his top speed.\n1:7 Comment: Dubarbier had the advantage.\n1:9 Comment: Gesé is fast and powerful, but Dubarbier had the position well earned.\n1:16 Comment: Litranza Corona playing with Ángel Trujillo.\n1:18 Comment: He attacked Xcaver Hernández.\n1:21 Comment: Chicharito is doing everything possible so that once he has made a space for himself\n1:30 Comment: As a starter, don't let anyone take it away from you, at least give Carlo Ancelotti a headache.\n1:37 Comment: He is achieving it by goals and by attitude too.\n1:39 Comment: He has shown that he is an excellent professional, who fights in every training session to be able to\n1:50 Comment: Earn an opportunity and so that when that opportunity comes, give your best.\n1:55 Comment: That is what in the end has made him a fundamental player in these last games.\n2:4 Comment: Manu, you expected four in the middle of the field.\n2:6 Comment: We have seen him now in a defensive position at Real Madrid.\n2:9 Comment: Gesé to the right, James to the left.\n2:11 Comment: Kroos and Llarra, both in the center.\n2:14 Comment: Yes, because Ancelotti, since he arrived at Madrid, was very clear that he likes to free the people at the top.\n2:25 Comment: Obviously when you play with three, you can't free all three.\n2:29 Comment:  Careful.\n2:30 Comment: The first touch for James.\n2:31 Comment: James' ball.\n2:32 Comment: Cristiano is not going to arrive, but the ball does not finish coming.\n2:35 Comment: Save the ball Cristiano Ronaldo.\n2:38 Comment: Bicycle and Wizards who end with a touch of heel for

ball.\n2:49 Comment: I said that Ancelotti likes to free those at the top.\n2:54 Comment: Especially when he can play with that 4-4-2.\n2:58 Comment: And it's normal.\n2:59 Comment: Although in attack Gesé will normally play many times at the same level as Cristiano and Chicharito.\n3:10 Comment: But in defense clearly without the ball he will get into that line of four.\n3:15 Comment: It's Keylor Navas' turn for Rafael Varane.\n3:18 Comment: Fabio Coentrão wants to be intense in the pressure.\n3:22 Comment: Almería up now.\n3:24 Comment: Mané is playing ahead of Dubarbier.\n3:26 Comment: In

Comment: at the entrance to the area with an Almería player.\n4:2 Comment: Yes, I think it's totally voluntary.\n4:5 Comment: Madrid's play was very good.\n4:7 Comment: Because from Keylor Navas' possession, close to his goal,\n4:13 Comment: He's already starting to get the ball played.\n4:15 Comment: Good mechanisms, with good support and passing possibilities in front and to the sides.\n4:21 Comment: Playing short and long, look for breadth.\n4:25 Comment: There is a good movement by Gesé inwards to empty that left wing.\n4:33 Comment: And here appears Arbeloa who throws a good cross before another extraordinary arrival from James\n4:38 Comment: from the second line, something he does fantastically.\n4:42 Comment: He couldn't control Illara's ball.\n4:44 Comment: Gesé recovers Almería, ball for Berza.\n4:46 Comment: Two Real Madrid players close him down,\n4:48 Comment: James and Kroos were there.\n4:50 Comment: To the pressure on the footballer from Sergi Baryoan's team.\n4:54 Comment: What Almería is saying to Madrid in these first minutes\n4:59 Comment: If you don't come to pressure me, I know how to play and I know how to have it and I can kill the game.\n5:6 Comment: This does not mean that Madrid is going to go crazy,\n5:11 Comment: But he is going to be forced to press above.\n5:15 Comment: Tomás, Tomás and Corona.\n5:18 Comment: Corona that looked for Manés and anticipated Arbeloa.\n5:21 Comment: James Rodríguez claims the ball.\n5:23 Comment: James has enjoyed a good opportunity,\n5:26 Comment: He hit a header that went wide.\n5:28 Comment: Foul on James, very clear, committed by Chimo Navarro.\n5:31 Comment: The ball that...\n5:33 Comment: Well, well, Chicharito's pass, spectacular.\n5:37 Comment: Giving continuity and depth to the game.\n5:42 Comment: A dangerous game in Arbeloa's action in that recovery against Tomás.\n5:47 Comment: Villanueva Church is now warning Chimo Navarro,\n5:51 Comment: Who was the one who committed the foul on James a few moments ago.\n5:55 Comment: We see Chicharito's pass giving it continuity.\n6:0 Comment: And Cristiano, who has...\n6:2 Comment: Well, a strange thing, isn't it?\n6:5 Comment: A control in the race that he usually does magnificently,\n6:9 Comment: It hasn't turned out very well.\n6:11 Comment: He steals the ball, Toni Kroos, there is no foul, they are left protesting.\n6:13 Comment: Berzán, Cristiano, James arrives, Cristiano with his left foot, Rubén.\n6:18 Comment: The ball ends up in a corner, I had up to three chances.\n6:22 Comment: James, Cristiano, four if we count on the one he finally chose,\n6:25 Comment: That was his shot on goal.\n6:29 Comment: Another clear one for Real Madrid.\n6:32 Comment: In just over six minutes he has already had twelve opportunities\n6:36 Comment: Carlo Ancelotti's team scored the first goal of the game.\n6:40 Comment: James Rodríguez, James' ball, Cristiano who jumped very alone,\n6:44 Comment: But he hasn't been able to give the ball the right direction.\n6:48 Comment: We said that Almería was forcing Madrid to put pressure.\n6:55 Comment: The shot goes to the center because when orienting it to the left,\n7:0 Comment: The ball stays in the air a little bit and he hits it very well.\n7:5 Comment: It stops it coming out in the center.\n7:8 Comment: Ruben doesn't have many problems.\n7:10 Comment: We see Luka Modric continuing to try to shorten the deadlines for his recovery.\n7:19 Comment: A list that Carlo Ancelotti obviously wants to have at his disposal as soon as possible.\n7:24 Comment: Something similar to Roberto is happening with Karim Benzema.\n7:27 Comment: Although some predicted that he could be present in the first Champions League match\n7:32 Comment: against Juventus, the information is contradictory.\n7:35 Comment: That might be too risky.\n7:38 Comment: On that list we must also include Gareth Bale,\n7:40 Comment: who already posted on social media how he was doing work in the gym\n7:44 Comment: And he was even optimistic about this League match,\n7:47 Comment: But it is clear that one of the priority objectives for Real Madrid\n7:50 Comment: When it comes to recovering players it is the Champions League.\n7:52 Comment: There are teams that right now are fortunate to be alive in several competitions\n7:57 Comment: and important competitions.\n7:59 Comment: This is the case of Real Madrid.\n8:0 Comment: The possibility of getting lost exists.\n8:2 Comment: When we see Odegar there, 16 years old, substitute for Real Madrid,\n8:8 Comment: He trains with Real Madrid, he visited the best clubs in Europe\n8:12 Comment: and in the end he ended up in the white team.\n8:15 Comment: It's not a typical story, is it?\n8:17 Comment:  No no no.\n8:19 Comment: The only thing I wish for the kid is that everything turns out like him...\n8:26 Comment: I was going to say how he dreamed it, if in reality he is still dreaming it,\n8:31 Comment: because it has to be a dream for him.\n8:34 Comment: He has quality, he is a special player, a special footballer,\n8:37 Comment: And, well, good luck,\n8:42 Comment: But for that luck to come to you, you have to have a lot of work, a lot of dedication,\n8:47 Comment: a lot of effort and train and practice,\n8:50 Comment: and learn from all the great teachers around you.\n8:54 Comment: He's not Norwegian, he's from Parla, I'm talking about Mayoral, he's also on the bench,\n8:58 Comment: He is also very young and has gotten excited about scoring goals with him, with the youth team.\n9:2 Comment: He's the typical footballer, pardon the expression, maybe a little clumsy,\n9:6 Comment: What moves him if goals fall, well that happens with Mayoral,\n9:10 Comment: But Mayoral has signed with Castilla right now, by the way.\n9:14 Comment: Well, that quality is not easy,\n9:18 Comment: How many times have we said that what many teams lack are goals,\n9:22 Comment: That's what you pay for, that's what's hard to find.\n9:25 Comment: Well, if Mayoral has that great quality,\n9:29 Comment: and the fact of having gone, of being gaining time from time,\n9:33 Comment: to go from youth B to youth A and Castilla and score goals,\n9:37 Comment: Well, you can see that he is having an extraordinary progression, let him continue like this.\n10:7 Comment: Well, the idea was good, look for Edgar's power with the ball into space,\n10:19 Comment: But Edgar also came from a tremendous effort,\n10:23 Comment: because he had gone down to defend the corner.\n10:37 Comment: Illarra with Cristiano Ronaldo, Cristiano with Javier Hernández,\n10:40 Comment: Chicharito, Chicharito who has not managed to escape the pressure that Chimo Navarro exerted.\n10:47 Comment: Tomás, Chimo Navarro, Edgar, Tomás again,\n10:53 Comment: The Ghanaian footballer gives the ball to Berza,\n10:56 Comment: Berza with some fortune makes a difference to Illarra,\n10:58 Comment: The pass to Corona and he opens for Mané, Dubarbier deploys,\n11:2 Comment: He stretches himself in Almería and does it with discretion,\n11:4 Comment: Mané's ball, Rafael Varane headed it,\n11:7 Comment: The ball falls to Fabio Cuentrano,\n11:9 Comment: Now there are more spaces, the Almería attack had been launched\n11:13 Comment: and Real Madrid can find free ground, but no,\n11:16 Comment: Recomposes the defensive figure quickly in Almería,\n11:20 Comment: They didn't let him run there,\n11:22 Comment: Mark me Rodríguez.\n11:24 Comment: The moment, Almería is organized well in defense,\n11:29 Comment: grouping together, but with the ball trying to look for first safety passes\n11:35 Comment: in order to have a longer possession.\n11:41 Comment: Mané cross, Tomer Emed, Varane, the ball returns to Mané,\n11:44 Comment: This one plays with Berza, Berza and Corona, Edgar opens and receives,\n11:49 Comment: Let's see if Chimo Navarro doubles him, no, the side remains static,\n11:53 Comment: Now you have the ball, Tomás,\n11:56 Comment: the backheel of the African player, closed by Varane,\n11:59 Comment: Chicharito, I don't know if it would have been even a better idea to let it pass,\n12:3 Comment: He wanted to control the ball and Mauro dos Santos took the ball away from him.\n12:7 Comment: We are seeing a brave almería,\n12:9 Comment: an almería that moves the ball well, moves it with sense\n12:14 Comment: And that allows him to incorporate players from the opposite field,\n12:17 Comment: We have seen this last attack play,\n12:21 Comment: that there were four players in finishing zones,\n12:25 Comment: plus one to cross and two on the rebound,\n12:28 Comment: Of course, that also means that if there is a loss,\n12:33 Comment: like the ball that Tomás lost,\n12:35 Comment: Madrid is going to have a lot of space to run,\n12:39 Comment: And Madrid really likes to run.\n12:43 Comment: Villarra, Kroos, Chicharito, stepping on Kahn's line,\n12:46 Comment: Open wide, James,\n12:48 Comment: It is Cristiano who arrives as a center forward,\n12:50 Comment: The ball goes towards him, Cristiano rises,\n12:52 Comment: the ball that is going to fall behind the Portuguese's back,\n12:55 Comment: Gese couldn't reach him, if Mané does,\n12:58 Comment: Emed, Pepe is chasing him,\n13:0 Comment: Emed endures the dispute and then Mané and Berza\n13:4 Comment: they find sufficient width of the playing field\n13:8 Comment: so that Almería can breathe, oxygenate itself and not feel overwhelmed.\n13:12 Comment: It's well scaled, it's well scaled,\n13:14 Comment: they alternate in the first reference to get the ball played,\n13:19 Comment: Berza and Corona alternate,\n13:22 Comment: and then ahead of them Thomas,\n13:24 Comment: that moves to one side and the other of Kroos.\n13:28 Comment: And Gemmert is also making good support moves,\n13:32 Comment: with which the Almería player who has the ball\n13:35 Comment: He has quite a few chances of passing\n13:37 Comment: because there are many colleagues offering solutions.\n13:40 Comment: And this is allowing you,\n13:42 Comment: Well, this is what we're seeing,\n13:44 Comment: have the ball, take it to the opposite field.\n13:46 Comment: Beware Corona, with option to trigger,\n13:48 Comment: try left-handed,\n13:49 Comment: touched on a Real Madrid player,\n13:51 Comment: There is a corner kick.\n13:53 Comment: He is having difficulties in the Real Madrid midfield,\n13:56 Comment: We have seen some loss from Illarra,\n13:58 Comment: Before a foul by Pepe committed on Mané,\n14:1 Comment: Almería there with Corona, Berza, Tomás,\n14:4 Comment: Even the wide players who are also coming in to get the ball,\n14:7 Comment: Well, he's finding that, possession.\n14:10 Comment: Yes, because they are doing things very well since recovery.\n14:15 Comment: The first security pass and from there,\n14:18 Comment: Do not repeat in the same place.\n14:22 Comment: Berza, inside Berza, Chicharito cleared,\n14:26 Comment: What good James has left for Toni Kroos,\n14:28 Comment: Lack of Corona, lack that was not enough.\n14:30 Comment: But look, look how Madrid runs.\n14:32 Comment: Real Madrid runs, there are four bullets that come out,\n14:34 Comment: Geseke looked for the pass for Chicharito,\n14:37 Comment: Dumavier cut in, the Almería can return the coin now,\n14:40 Comment: But no, Almería does not want to fall into precipitation.\n14:43 Comment: Tomás very well staged there,\n14:46 Comment: Looking for Kroos's back or moving to his sides.\n14:53 Comment: Mané, Mané from a distance, Mané's ball to the right of Keylor Navas' frame.\n14:59 Comment: Almería is not intimidated, there is a detail Roberto,\n15:3 Comment: We arrived early at the Bernabéu,\n15:5 Comment: We have seen the Almería footballers step on the grass,\n15:7 Comment: still in the official team suit.\n15:10 Comment: And Sergi Barjohan, I think he was doing psychological work with them.\n15:14 Comment: Especially with the two full-backs, both with Dumarvier and with Chimo,\n15:17 Comment: He was talking to them, come on, quite a few minutes before they even went to the locker room\n15:22 Comment: and he was doing important, psychological work,\n15:26 Comment: I think that at the time it was a brave team and they wanted to go out.\n15:29 Comment: And for now, come on, that's what he's doing.\n15:32 Comment: Sergi, who has played in big teams,\n15:36 Comment: He has a tremendous career as a footballer\n15:39 Comment: And he obviously knows football, and he knows a lot,\n15:44 Comment: And although in this Almería I think there are few inexperienced players,\n15:49 Comment: Yes, it is often important to scare away possible fear or intimidation\n15:54 Comment: that he can perform, in this case facing the second in the competition and in this scenario.\n16:0 Comment: That is fundamental, that is fundamental.\n16:2 Comment: If you go to any field, if you go with fear,\n16:9 Comment: If you're tight, if you're not loose, if you don't trust yourself,\n16:14 Comment: In short, the normal thing is not that you lose, it is not that you get beaten.\n16:19 Comment: They can also do it if you are very ambitious,\n16:24 Comment: but the sensations are very different\n16:28 Comment: And especially the feelings you can have after the game.\n16:31 Comment: And so far what Almería is showing is that it is competing head-to-head with Madrid.\n16:58 Comment: Almería is now having more of the ball.\n17:2 Comment: Simón Navarro again with the ball, he plays towards Tomás, he does it badly.\n17:7 Comment: The ball for Pepe.\n17:10 Comment: The central defender who sees how he is is Illaramendi, who now puts order in Real Madrid's game against Cristiano.\n17:18 Comment: Mauro Santos played.\n17:21 Comment: 17 in the match, 0-0.\n17:24 Comment: Real Madrid has just won in Balaidos in a match that was truly crazy at times.\n17:30 Comment: Yes, but beautiful.\n17:33 Comment: Ancelotti's team finally won the victory, but it went through its difficulties.\n17:37 Comment: Yes, because of course, Celta is a team that does things very well, that plays very open and very beautiful football.\n17:44 Comment: James, James towards Cuentrao, he has a lot of Real Madrid people in the area, to the center of Cuentrao, he took the ball, crown.\n17:54 Comment: Iglesias Villanueva reprimands Edgar.\n18:5 Comment: We see how...\n18:6 Comment: I don't think he liked it.\n18:8 Comment: I don't know, he made the gesture, I don't know if in the end he ended up showing the cardboard.\n18:11 Comment: I think not, I think not.\n18:14 Comment: There the Galician referee went with great determination to look for the Almería footballer.\n18:20 Comment: Finally that nuisance has occurred.\n18:24 Comment: Yes, Iglesias Villanueva's wake-up call to Edgar was also done before with Chimo Navarro.\n18:31 Comment: He takes a free kick, James came in looking for the shot, Varane cleared two saints, Toni Kroos, Cristiano.\n18:38 Comment: Varane and Chicharito were offside, they were regaining their place.\n18:45 Comment: Ruben, who has taken out towards Dumarvier.\n18:47 Comment: Almería beat Eibar 2-0 in a match that was vital because it was at home, because it was against Eibar.\n18:55 Comment: And Sergi's team pulled it off.\n18:57 Comment: Look how Cristiano opens his arms because he wants the help of his teammates to go and press and for the team to accompany him.\n19:8 Comment: It's a signal for him to transmit to his companions, but in the meantime he has to be smart enough not to go if the rest don't go with him.\n19:21 Comment: Unless it's such a clear play that he can only do damage.\n19:26 Comment: Let it be now from the left side, you can't center because it crosses.\n19:32 Comment: Chimo Navarro, he has already stayed in the center.\n19:34 Comment: It's crossed, Chimo Navarro, Iglesias Villanueva has already taken a goal kick.\n19:40 Comment: It didn't seem to me, it's true that we have a long distance to that position.\n19:47 Comment: It's a corner.\n19:48 Comment: Chimo Navarro, the last one to clearly touch Geseno, before not even the feint.\n19:51 Comment: The referee doesn't see it because Chimo Navarro is covering the ball, but it's a corner.\n19:58 Comment: Rubén, Rafael Varane, Berza, Berza with a crown, Mané.\n20:5 Comment: Mané who is going to the middle permanently when Almería attacks.\n20:11 Comment: Fabio Cuentrao Edgar is shot down.\n20:15 Comment: Lack of Portuguese.\n20:18 Comment: In strategy, Almería has also shown that it is a team that has power.\n20:26 Comment: There it will surely be Mané with an inward trajectory who takes the foul.\n20:34 Comment: And there go the center backs.\n20:37 Comment: We saw Sergi talking to Ramón de Quintana with his second.\n20:43 Comment: 20 good minutes from Almería, 20 minutes in which there were no goals.\n20:47 Comment: Almería now enjoys an opportunity from a set piece.\n20:55 Comment: Real Madrid's defensive line.\n20:57 Comment: Mané's ball was very advanced in a rehearsed action.\n21:1 Comment: I was trying to touch towards the penalty spot.\n21:4 Comment: Edgar has not achieved what he intended.\n21:8 Comment: Winning the cut is essential in these faults, in this type of actions.\n21:15 Comment: Both to defend and to attack.\n21:18 Comment: But of course, the ball went too low to be able to take advantage of it.\n21:23 Comment: Fabio has entered with Cristiano.\n21:25 Comment: The two Portuguese now turn to the left side.\n21:28 Comment: He takes the ball to crown.\n21:30 Comment: Tomer Emed.\n21:31 Comment: Kituka for Edgar.\n21:33 Comment: Tomer Emed is providing many solutions.\n21:36 Comment: The surveillance on him is not being the most appropriate on the part of Pepe and Varane.\n21:43 Comment: Varane's foul that the referee let continue.\n21:45 Comment: The play continues with a ball for Dubarbier.\n21:48 Comment: The last center.\n21:50 Comment: Edgar is going to arrive from the opposite side.\n21:53 Comment: Real Madrid is a bit lost.\n21:55 Comment: Almería is getting stronger and more and more determined.\n21:59 Comment: Tomás wants to go the other way.\n22:1 Comment: How good the cut.\n22:2 Comment: Puts the ball back.\n22:3 Comment: Shoot Mané.\n22:5 Comment: Gese is going to take the ball.\n22:7 Comment: Gabir Hernandez.\n22:8 Comment: He runs and anticipates sending the ball.\n22:11 Comment: Angel Trujillo out.\n22:13 Comment: This is what I was referring to when I just commented that the monitoring of Emed by Varane and Pepe is not being adequate.\n22:24 Comment: Every time Emed goes to receive, he receives and combines and that relieves the team a lot.\n22:33 Comment: Look how Trujillo went to bite there, to pressure Chicharito and he anticipated him.\n22:40 Comment: And what I see Roberto is Carlo Ancelotti already showing some signs of concern.\n22:45 Comment: You could even add disgust because in some moments you can see how his team does not end up generating all the danger that he likes to do.\n22:52 Comment: Chicharito and Arbeloa.\n22:53 Comment: The center of Arbeloa.\n22:54 Comment: The ball was going towards Gese.\n22:56 Comment:  Head.\n22:57 Comment: Chimo Navarro.\n22:58 Comment: Cross.\n23:1 Comment: The German footballer moves the ball.\n23:4 Comment: It was Arbeloa who was going to try to finish it off, but the Almería players should be attentive, as they are not making a single mistake behind and are also becoming more and more daring in attack.\n23:19 Comment: Van Eyck, Dumarvier.\n23:21 Comment: Sebastian Dumarvier.\n23:23 Comment: Van Eyck, the two full-backs in that left lane.\n23:27 Comment: Tomer, Emed and Tomás.\n23:28 Comment: Emed is doing things very, very, very well.\n23:31 Comment: And Thomas too.\n23:34 Comment: Edgar.\n23:35 Comment: Edgar put the ball ahead.\n23:38 Comment: I thought he was going to make a run towards Tomer Emed's goal.\n23:41 Comment: Because in principle when Edgar has the ball and is setting up his leg, Emed is behind Pepe.\n23:50 Comment: And that's why Edgar tries that pass, which was a very good idea.\n23:57 Comment: What happens is that precisely at that moment it was like when Emed wanted to get ahead of Pepe.\n24:4 Comment: Gesé.\n24:5 Comment: Gesé crosses Gesé's ball, which was tremendously dangerous.\n24:10 Comment: Ruben hesitated, he didn't want to go out.\n24:12 Comment: Chicharito hesitated, he couldn't get there.\n24:14 Comment: And the ball that finally crossed the small area.\n24:17 Comment: Yes, it's one of those centers that you don't expect because Gesé has the ball deep inside.\n24:22 Comment: Because he has the opposite on him.\n24:24 Comment: But there are those centers for goal men, they are the ones who have to wait because they can arrive.\n24:37 Comment: Thomas.\n24:40 Comment: Tomás with Dubarbier.\n24:42 Comment: Everything that Almería does measures a lot.\n24:45 Comment: He doesn't go out madly on the counterattack.\n24:48 Comment: On the counterattack he is measuring every step he takes and he is taking it with great precision.\n24:53 Comment: They are enjoying themselves very much.\n24:59 Comment: Especially Berza, Corona, Gemmert, Tomás.\n25:8 Comment: Kroos.\n25:10 Comment: Real Madrid had very clear chances in the first minutes.\n25:14 Comment: It's already a long time ago.\n25:16 Comment: He intimidates Rubén.\n25:18 Comment: Trujillo touched the ball.\n25:20 Comment: Illarra gets the ball.\n25:22 Comment: Illarra falls.\n25:23 Comment: English to Villanueva.\n25:26 Comment: Signals goal kick.\n25:28 Comment: I have to see it again.\n25:30 Comment: I have to see it because Illarra is ready here and takes the ball away.\n25:40 Comment: Arm your leg to hit.\n25:43 Comment: When he puts his foot back to serve, he has Dubarbier.\n25:49 Comment: But Dubarbier doesn't try to put his leg in.\n25:51 Comment: If I had tried to put my leg in, it would have been a penalty.\n25:54 Comment: But Dubarbier doesn't try to put his leg in and it's Illarra who hits Dubarbier.\n26:1 Comment: For me there is nothing.\n26:3 Comment: Tomás is fouled on Illarra Mendy.\n26:8 Comment: Kroos.\n26:9 Comment: Simon Navarro.\n26:12 Comment: I sent the ball out to Simón Navarro.\n26:15 Comment: Simón Navarro paired with Cristiano Ronaldo at this specific moment of the match.\n26:21 Comment: Cristiano moving along the entire Real Madrid attack line.\n26:26 Comment: Gese Kroos.\n26:28 Comment:  James Rodriguez.\n26:31 Comment: James trying to sneak through the center.\n26:35 Comment: They have not allowed it to the Almería defenders and there is a foul on Real Madrid's 10.\n26:41 Comment: A foul that is very far from Rubén's goal.\n26:46 Comment: But he has qualified players from Real Madrid to look for the goal.\n26:51 Comment: Starting with the one who is placing the ball, Cristiano.\n26:56 Comment: That's James' downfall.\n26:58 Comment: Man, Edgar complains that it's not a foul, but with his hand he unbalances him, with his body a little more.\n27:6 Comment: It seems missing.\n27:7 Comment: The place for Cristiano is extraordinary.\n27:13 Comment: Because he has no problem with power and that distance allows him to give the ball time to go down slightly.\n27:22 Comment: Varane and Pepe have placed themselves on the barrier. Now he moves away, throws at Cristiano.\n27:27 Comment: Rubén was petrified because the ball had a diabolical effect.\n27:34 Comment: It took him first to the left, then to the right and he fell over the crossbar.\n27:37 Comment: And it has arrived much earlier than Rubén was supposed to.\n27:42 Comment: Look how the ball seems to go to the left and at the end it opens a little.\n27:52 Comment: Rubén, what's he going to serve? About minute 28.00.\n27:58 Comment: Tomás, Álvaro Arbeloa, Keylor Navas.\n28:5 Comment: Keylor towards Cristiano Ronaldo.\n28:9 Comment: Fabio Cuentrao.\n28:12 Comment: Cuentrao and Cristiano, change of pace. Chivo Navarro is also very fast.\n28:16 Comment: He reacted very well there on the albería side.\n28:23 Comment: Cuentrao will take the sideline.\n28:25 Comment: As you said, Cristiano appearing all over the attacking front.\n28:32 Comment: Now lately a little more to the left.\n28:36 Comment: The ball is left behind for Ramendi after Cuentrao's pass.\n28:41 Comment: And the albería that can run and does, but not in a crazy way.\n28:45 Comment: He doesn't look for a direct ball to Tomé Remed.\n28:47 Comment: It was a mistake in the pass, not too difficult.\n28:53 Comment: But again there is always a staggered player.\n28:59 Comment: Whether it's Corona, whether it's fundamentally Tomás or Remed.\n29:5 Comment: They are the ones who can receive and can give continuity to the game.\n29:9 Comment: Because they are not pressed well enough, because they have not had the opportunity to make a good pass.\n29:14 Comment: Because they are not sufficiently pressured, because there is no close surveillance on them.\n29:23 Comment: And that is the main problem that Madrid is having.\n29:26 Comment: Because that is forcing him to have to run behind the ball more than they thought.\n29:33 Comment: And above all to run backwards.\n29:35 Comment: Yarra, James, who is perhaps looking for something different in Real Madrid's game.\n29:42 Comment: Cross, forced and risky pass, but Chicharito gets the ball.\n29:47 Comment: Arbeloa with the Mexican, Javier Hernández.\n29:52 Comment: Chicharito's ball comes out without anyone touching it.\n29:56 Comment: I think Edgar doesn't play it and neither does Cuentrao.\n29:59 Comment: But James is playing more of the inside zone.\n30:1 Comment: Because in reality the one who gives breadth and depth to the band is Cuentrao.\n30:7 Comment: And James tries to work more inside to receive and from there to reach.\n30:18 Comment: The ball goes to Edgar, Varane has to go and cover the wing.\n30:23 Comment: Edgar and Varane, hit Varane, the throw-in in favor of the Andalusian team.\n30:28 Comment: It's been more than half an hour into the game.\n30:31 Comment: The Real Madrid that entered the match with determination and generating opportunities.\n30:36 Comment: Well, all that has fallen by the wayside.\n30:40 Comment: And Almería has managed to make few things happen and convey a feeling of control.\n30:46 Comment: Chimo Navarro, center of Chimo Navarro, Arbeloa.\n30:49 Comment: Of control and danger.\n30:52 Comment: James, James, playing intelligent and dangerous ball.\n30:55 Comment: On the opposite side is Cristiano Chicharito.\n30:58 Comment: I think he wanted to play with Cristiano.\n31:1 Comment: It was the idea, the gesture of the Mexican, but it was not executed well.\n31:5 Comment: Yes, but Trujillo has come to help very well there.\n31:9 Comment: Besides, he didn't rush, he got close, but he didn't enter in a crazy way.\n31:15 Comment: And that has allowed him in the end to be able to deflect the ball and...\n31:21 Comment: and get hold of it.\n31:23 Comment: Look, practically the two or three times that Almería wanted to play long\n31:29 Comment: That was when he lost the ball the earliest.\n31:32 Comment: And now the Trujillo who made the mistake.\n31:35 Comment: The first part that Egemed is doing is almost, almost, almost bordering on perfection.\n31:43 Comment: Because all the balls that have come to him,\n31:45 Comment: He has given everyone continuity.\n31:47 Comment: And also not continuity in any way, continuity to progress in the game.\n31:53 Comment: If he also steals balls, then I won't even tell you.\n31:58 Comment: Cristiano, James, Eze waiting on the right wing, but the ball is not going to reach them.\n32:4 Comment: Lack of Chimo, Navarro, and the anticipation against Cristiano.\n32:9 Comment: Pepe comes to talk to Carlo Ancelotti to give him some kind of indication.\n32:13 Comment: It seems that even the central defender has some idea of ​​what the authentic Italian is proposing.\n32:20 Comment: That's it with the message Pepe.\n32:23 Comment: Let's see if it has any visible consequences.\n32:28 Comment: Those instructions that Carlo Ancelotti gave you.\n32:31 Comment: At the moment he is speaking with Illa Ramendi. Pepe has gone directly to speak with the midfielder\n32:35 Comment: to convey to you what you have discussed with the Italian coach.\n32:38 Comment: Another direct foul in favor of Real Madrid.\n32:41 Comment: Another foul that Cristiano is going to take. Now more focused on the left side.\n32:47 Comment: This was a more perpendicular shot. It just missed.\n32:51 Comment: A distance of one second.\n32:53 Comment: Pepe, the midfielder, the midfielder, the midfielder.\n32:56 Comment: This was a more perpendicular shot. It just missed.\n33:0 Comment: A similar distance.\n33:8 Comment: Cristiano, the English Villanueva who gives the order to launch.\n33:12 Comment: This time the ball doesn't fall.\n33:14 Comment: It was straight on an upward trajectory.\n33:17 Comment: I think it was last year when, I don't know if it was last year or the year before,\n33:21 Comment: When Cristiano at a certain moment chose, because in the shooting of fouls,\n33:30 Comment: don't make such a gesture... to hit the ball too hard,\n33:38 Comment: and make a softer gesture to look for a little more placement.\n33:43 Comment: And I think it turned out well.\n33:45 Comment: I think it turned out well. Now I see that he once again wants to use too much force.\n33:52 Comment: He wants to use too much force and that is why he does not achieve the priority objective,\n33:59 Comment: which is for the ball to go between the three sticks.\n34:1 Comment: He continues to play the ball very well in Almería. Corona.\n34:6 Comment: Corona and Dubarbier. Dubarbier towards Tomás. Arbeloa crossed and almost favored a rival.\n34:13 Comment: Atomer Emed recovered Real Madrid. Ball by James Gesé.\n34:19 Comment: They have left a couple of internments by the gang. One of them resolved with a dangerous center,\n34:24 Comment: But it is true that it is appearing very intermittently in Real Madrid's game.\n34:28 Comment: But it's normal, it's normal. Gesé is a footballer who needs a lot of minutes to get better,\n34:36 Comment: Not only the form, but to find oneself within the field of the game.\n34:39 Comment: Because when you're away from the field of play for so long,\n34:43 Comment: You need to adapt to the situations of the game. And that is based on minutes, obviously.\n34:50 Comment: Cuentrao bordering on offside. The ball goes to James. James loses the ball.\n34:55 Comment: Dos Santos. Tomás. Foul by Álvaro Arbeloa on Tomás.\n35:2 Comment: Real Madrid is blocked. They don't see the resource to tighten the rope a little.\n35:10 Comment: And Almería continues to transmit solidity.\n35:13 Comment: In the end you get rushed. It's a bit like what happened to James.\n35:18 Comment: He could have continued, but he quickly wants to get the ball off of him to make a pass.\n35:25 Comment: However, the opposite is happening in Almería.\n35:29 Comment: You see the players relaxed, daring, wanting the ball, offering themselves and being successful with the ball.\n35:40 Comment: But I think that the main problem that Madrid is having is that, after the loss,\n35:48 Comment: It takes a long time to recover the ball. And it is fundamentally because of the surveillance\n35:56 Comment: About the off-hook men, who are usually Tomás and Gemet, they are not being good.\n36:5 Comment: And that allows Almería to have longer possessions and play more freely.\n36:16 Comment: Gesé sees free space. He takes advantage of it. Gesé returns Cristiano.\n36:19 Comment: Tomás was there again, completely alone.\n36:23 Comment: Edo Barbier's pass was not easy because he was under pressure.\n36:29 Comment: But if it had been a little more precise, all the effort of six players to go to the top pressure,\n36:36 Comment: It wouldn't have been of any use.\n36:39 Comment: James, Cristiano Ronaldo, Gesé tried to make a pass.\n36:44 Comment: But he's not giving you anything.\n36:47 Comment: To the Real Madrid winger. The ball went to a corner.\n36:51 Comment: Play fast looking for the surprise. James, Arbeloa, James.\n36:55 Comment: James only has the front of Toni Kroos. He leaves his body behind. High blow.\n37:0 Comment: I like that type of hitting. It's not the same hitting from the front, as Maradona has done on some occasions,\n37:7 Comment: and he puts it close to the stick from below.\n37:9 Comment: Or in the square, to a ball that comes parallel to the goal, you have to turn,\n37:15 Comment: You have to hit it another way. It's much more complicated.\n37:23 Comment: Rubén, Tomás, Emed. And finally it is the Israeli who takes the ball and plays it with Berza.\n37:30 Comment: Corona and Mané. Tomás, Corina, Arbeloa, James.\n37:35 Comment: And he plays it with Berza. Corona and Mané. Tomás, Corona, Berza.\n37:43 Comment: Dubarbier stopped, he was surprised by Berza's ball.\n37:47 Comment: Peper, the ball from Emed. Kroos, Dubarbier, who steals the ball.\n37:52 Comment: Tomás who picks up the ball, arranges it, hides it, protects it.\n37:55 Comment: And finally he lost the Ghanaian midfielder.\n37:58 Comment: James Rodríguez, Chimo Navarro, who is hitting him almost always, prevents the ball from reaching Cristiano.\n38:5 Comment: Edgar waiting for me to give him the ball, Chimo Navarro.\n38:8 Comment: Stuck to the side. The Canarian footballer delays for Berza, this one with Corona.\n38:15 Comment: Again from the humidity. He returns to what is giving him such good results, making the ball circulate.\n38:21 Comment: Mané, Trujillo.\n38:24 Comment: Yes, but the pressure from Madrid is a pressure at the wrong time.\n38:29 Comment: Look, once again Emed receives very easily.\n38:33 Comment: Carlo Ancelotti is desperate. Berza. Now Roberto is far from hiding his anger Carlo Ancelotti.\n38:43 Comment: It's a possession of training when you work on that.\n38:47 Comment: You work on ball possession without an objective at times, rather than keeping the ball and giving enough touches.\n38:57 Comment: And you can see the embería players enjoying themselves. They are very comfortable.\n39:1 Comment: James towards Gesee. Duvalbier has no help. Gesee plays towards Illarra. Illarra in the area.\n39:7 Comment: He takes the ball out again for Gesee. The canary hangs up, he doesn't carry it. Cristiano.\n39:12 Comment: Finally the ball back. It was Dos Santos who touched the save Rubén.\n39:15 Comment: Now he did reach the side of the area. Real Madrid from the dangerous center.\n39:23 Comment: Intervention by Rubén. As you can see, he hits the ball into the body of Mauro Dos Santos.\n39:31 Comment: Edgar. Cross. The ball is lost on the side.\n39:35 Comment: Come on, the goal is for Madrid to improve its game and find itself in a different situation than the one it is having in this first half,\n39:58 Comment: For Ancelotti it is that the team does a joint job at the time of recovery,\n40:8 Comment: That is not individual pressure or pressure from two players on their side.\n40:15 Comment: This is good. What they have done with that coordination is more out of sync than football.\n40:20 Comment: A la lemon. They took James and countered. The same throw-in that had to be repeated.\n40:28 Comment: Corona, Cristiano Ronaldo knocks him down. Foul.\n40:32 Comment: And then following the line of recovery work, activate after the loss much sooner.\n40:40 Comment: Those close to the loss of the ball go to press and those who are in the second line of pressure and especially those who are on surveillance,\n40:55 Comment: have much closer surveillance.\n41:0 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo with his arm in Corona's face.\n41:4 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo is one card away from completing his cycle.\n41:11 Comment: That's something he knows best.\n41:14 Comment: Yes, but sometimes what we have mentioned, in one of these actions in which you measure wrong,\n41:21 Comment: And the way the game is developing, Madrid is very uncomfortable,\n41:24 Comment: That they come to you hastily, that you are not comfortable.\n41:29 Comment: He leaves with a goal, he received from James, he continues with a goal, Cristiano and Mauro dos Santos, with a goal, he protests, there is no foul.\n41:37 Comment: Dos Santos now apologizes because he sent the ball wide. He gets angry and how Sergio Barjoan does.\n41:45 Comment: In his technical area doing his homework. There we see Luka Modric who seems a little perplexed by what is happening\n41:51 Comment: And what happens is that Real Madrid marks it, that Almería is not only holding up,\n41:57 Comment: He is trying to make a football that is not based at all on defending, but on attacking what can get the ball a lot.\n42:6 Comment: What happens is that sometimes a strategic move unclogs all that.\n42:11 Comment: Corner. Toni Kroos, Javier Hernández in the small area, the rest of the Real Madrid players in the front.\n42:20 Comment: Toni Kroos's ball, Cristiano Rubén heads.\n42:27 Comment: Ruben who takes the ball. Cristiano who seemed to have hurt himself, Roberto.\n42:34 Comment: Go back now with your head slightly lowered to recover your position, it seems that nothing has been done either.\n42:48 Comment: The afternoon is falling in Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu, time is running out in the first period.\n42:56 Comment: Take out Caves, a mistake that Edgar made.\n43:0 Comment: Real Madrid has to take action again, Varane is doing it now.\n43:2 Comment: Pepe, Pepe and Arbeloa. Kroos gives you an easy solution.\n43:8 Comment: Coming closer to claim the ball, Illarra now has it.\n43:11 Comment: This was Illarra Mendy, Fabio Cuentrao.\n43:15 Comment: Illarra went on the attack trying to surprise, but his teammates did not see that break.\n43:22 Comment: Illarra Mendy.\n43:23 Comment: Illarra, James is very covered up, and so is Cuentrao.\n43:27 Comment: He plays towards Varane, a certain murmur of impatience is awakened in the stands of the Santiago Bernabéu.\n43:37 Comment: Dubarbiér manages to anticipate Gesé, Mané, Berza.\n43:44 Comment: Berza and Mané.\n43:48 Comment: Dubarbiér.\n43:50 Comment: Whenever... Look, of the few times he's lost, the few balls he's lost.\n43:56 Comment: I cut the ball from Toni Kroos, he renews the defense.\n43:59 Comment: Tremendous shot from James to the squad!\n44:7 Comment: James appears with the broom to sweep up what fell there.\n44:12 Comment: What fell was a ball that James has polished and transformed into a superb goal.\n44:17 Comment: Last minute of the first half, Real Madrid takes the lead.\n44:22 Comment: Goal by James, 1-0.\n44:24 Comment: The hitting is extraordinary. How well he attacks the ball, how well he hits it from the outside corner.\n44:30 Comment: But where does it come from? Where does it come from? From a stolen ball, from the very few balls that have been stolen from Jemez when they have played with him.\n44:39 Comment: This has caused the forward pass to not be sufficiently well armed.\n44:44 Comment: In addition, James' faith in attacking that ball and the quality of his hitting is what completes the action.\n44:52 Comment: But the origin is in recovery.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: This second half begins with the ball for Almería and a 1-0 lead for Real Madrid.\n0:8 Comment: It's Férico who played long for the Almeria team, Pepe who came to play, Keylor Navas who came out of his goal,\n0:14 Comment: A ball that was cushioned well by Javier Hernández who plays with James Rodríguez.\n0:19 Comment: Cross, we are going to see immediately if there has been any change, we already know that not in footballers, but in attitudes or positions\n0:28 Comment: I'm thinking mainly about Real Madrid because Almería, it's true, is losing, but I don't think the plan was going badly.\n0:35 Comment: No, no, no, things weren't bad for him. What you said is true, no, it's not like he went far and finished dangerously,\n0:44 Comment: But for Almería to take so much time off the ball from Madrid and somehow play as comfortable as they found in the first half,\n0:58 Comment: It was not expected.\n1:0 Comment: Corona holds the ball, Álvaro Arbeloa was missing it, Corona protected Corona very well.\n1:7 Comment: The Toledo native who delayed for Dumarvier, leaves the ball short, Dumarvier intercepts Gesei who then makes a mistake,\n1:13 Comment: He was so fast, he had the play so worked out in his head that he sent the ball too fast and too long to Cross.\n1:20 Comment: Yes, he didn't want to drive, he didn't want to drive, he gives it to Cross so that Cross can then beat him in the race.\n1:26 Comment: Berza, Chicharito who cut, James loses the ball, Cross and Sergi Yarramendi.\n1:39 Comment: And Madrid is having a problem with the ball and that is due to the characteristics of the players.\n1:51 Comment: I am referring to the fact that it is not having enough breadth, when you have a team that is put together well,\n1:58 Comment: As Almería is being set up, you need people on the outside to give you breadth and depth.\n2:6 Comment: And of course, it is not the same that Carvajal and Marcelo play on the outside, which does give you a lot of breadth and depth,\n2:14 Comment: Let Coentrao and Arbeloa play, since their characteristics are different.\n2:18 Comment: Tomás, Edgar doesn't arrive, Marcelo does, but he loses the ball. Corona, Dubarbier is waiting, Corona has seen him in Dubarbier's career.\n2:29 Comment: Pepe also goes to the cross very quickly, but Dubarbier manages to cross, Keylor.\n2:33 Comment: Alón for the Tico.\n2:35 Comment: Tomás, Edgar and Gemmell both arrived very well. Dubarbier's center was forced.\n2:48 Comment: Gesei, Cristiano. Cristiano, Ronaldo. Gesei again. Gesei crosses.\n2:56 Comment: And Mauro Santos, who prefers to concede a corner than to have gotten into difficulties.\n3:2 Comment: Just like what happened in the first half, Pepe returns to the bench area.\n3:8 Comment: Although in this case it is no longer that he is talking to Ancelotti, but rather he is addressing Paul Clement, the second coach.\n3:14 Comment: And also, well, for now Isco and Nacho are starting to warm up.\n3:20 Comment: While Pepe was asking for Espadalapos to attach to the shin guard.\n3:23 Comment: The corner is taken with Pepe waiting to hold the shin guard.\n3:27 Comment: That is to say, Real Madrid practically have one less man, let it be from the inside, the intelligent pass.\n3:31 Comment: Toni Kroos, Cristiano in goal. Score, Score, Cristiano. He scores the second. The gift of Toni Kroos.\n3:37 Comment: Cristian who widens the gap for Real Madrid. After the corner kick, that Portuguese connection that unites.\n3:46 Comment: It ends in the second of the game. Dulcerao, Cristiano.\n3:49 Comment: The key is Gesé's pass. Gesé's pass is brutal. It's brutal.\n3:57 Comment: That ball that goes inside Kroos.\n4:0 Comment: Christian who marks and who does not leave any special celebration.\n4:7 Comment: I don't know if Cristiano knows it. I don't know if he's the Almería player.\n4:14 Comment: It's true, I correct myself. That was the gesture Cristiano made. The goal is not his. That's what he was saying.\n4:20 Comment: Mauro Santos is the one who scores in his own goal.\n4:23 Comment: Mea, mea, mea.\n4:25 Comment: Mea culpa, rectification. Dos Santos' goal at his own goal.\n4:30 Comment: It was Cristiano's gesture.\n4:36 Comment: That was right, he didn't celebrate anything because he was so happy. Of course, his team scored, but it didn't reach its signature.\n4:43 Comment: Well, and between the resolution of the goal, Podegar came out to warm up.\n4:48 Comment: And they also said that it was the second goal of the season.\n4:51 Comment: Podegar has gone out to warm up.\n4:54 Comment: And they also said that Real Madrid's 101st goal in this league was an own goal.\n4:59 Comment: Already above 10.\n5:1 Comment: Area center, Chicharito and Cristiano.\n5:4 Comment: Chicharito didn't arrive, Cristiano wanted to finish, he didn't finish it.\n5:8 Comment: Fabio Cuentrao, Edgar missing.\n5:13 Comment: Well, Almería is conceding goals at very critical moments.\n5:16 Comment: Last minute of the first half and just after the start of the second.\n5:22 Comment: Well, now the game and the result are coming up to see the kid.\n5:32 Comment: Let's see if Ancelotti decides to give him minutes.\n5:38 Comment: James, alone on the barrier. Edgar in the area.\n5:43 Comment: You can count up to 5 Real Madrid players defending Almería with all their might.\n5:49 Comment: Pending, where does James Rodríguez put the ball?\n5:52 Comment: The Colombian international commands the center, Dubarbier.\n5:57 Comment: Marbeloa who collected the ball headed by Dubarbier.\n6:2 Comment: Tomás Sánchez attacks the ball and ends up committing a foul.\n6:7 Comment: Six minutes into the second period.\n6:12 Comment: That long list of players that Roberto told us are warming up.\n6:16 Comment: Three from each team in the band.\n6:19 Comment: The Almería that, I insist, even with 1-0 could continue thinking.\n6:24 Comment: There we see confirmation of Dos Santos' own goal.\n6:29 Comment: The issue is that Almería is still going to trust him in that game.\n6:33 Comment: The 2-0 is already a result that forces more.\n6:38 Comment: From Sergi Marjolán to be daring.\n6:41 Comment: Thomas and Edgar.\n6:45 Comment: Chimo Navarro is clearly going on the attack now.\n6:48 Comment: Choose to center Edgar.\n6:50 Comment: The ball falls soft into the hands of Keylor Navas.\n6:54 Comment: With the ball I think Almería is going to try\n6:58 Comment: keep doing the same thing.\n7:1 Comment: Among other things, and fundamentally, because it has gone very well.\n7:5 Comment: Because except for scoring chances,\n7:10 Comment: in what it is in possession and in combinations,\n7:13 Comment: He's doing great.\n7:15 Comment: The two goals conceded can undermine their defensive attitude.\n7:21 Comment: Because that still makes them a little more strong.\n7:25 Comment: Because that makes them no longer have the same intensity.\n7:33 Comment: Or perhaps understanding that the game is practically decided.\n7:40 Comment: Almería has a very tough schedule at the end of the season.\n7:45 Comment: Today is an example facing Real Madrid.\n7:47 Comment: Jesus Center.\n7:49 Comment: Now it's Trujillo who clears.\n7:51 Comment: Today Real Madrid.\n7:52 Comment: But the next game is already in the thirty-fifth\n7:56 Comment: It will be an Almería Celta, then Almería Málaga, then Seville-Almería,\n8:0 Comment: then Almería-Valencia.\n8:2 Comment: That is the final stretch of the season for Sergi Barjot's team.\n8:5 Comment:  Hard hard.\n8:7 Comment: Corner.\n8:9 Comment: James is coming.\n8:12 Comment: Although it doesn't seem like I'm going to count on cross country.\n8:15 Comment: Short cross by Toni Kroos.\n8:17 Comment: Edgar heads, throw-in.\n8:23 Comment: James and Kroos.\n8:25 Comment: Ask Pepe for the ball.\n8:27 Comment: Something in the center.\n8:29 Comment: Kroos is leaving the balls very short.\n8:31 Comment:  Crown.\n8:33 Comment: I don't know if he saw Javier Hernández coming or just sensed him\n8:37 Comment: But he prevented the ball from being stolen from the Mexican.\n8:39 Comment: It's been a while, I think it's been a while since Corona\n8:42 Comment: He's not enjoying a game like he is today.\n8:46 Comment: Despite losing by two.\n8:50 Comment: Pepe, what a mistake for Pepe.\n8:52 Comment: The ball that Mané touched.\n8:54 Comment: Simon Avarro.\n8:56 Comment: The ball is going to go over the baseline.\n8:58 Comment: There is a corner kick.\n9:1 Comment: Corner for Almería.\n9:3 Comment: Simón Avarro is now letting loose a little more.\n9:6 Comment: Trying to accompany Edgar more in attack.\n9:10 Comment: I think something similar is going to happen on the left side.\n9:15 Comment: Dubarbier's contribution in attack.\n9:19 Comment:  Bertha.\n9:23 Comment: Players very close in the area, Almería players looking for blocks.\n9:27 Comment: Javier Hernández heads.\n9:29 Comment:  James.\n9:31 Comment: James towards Chicharito.\n9:33 Comment: Chicharito who loses the ball.\n9:35 Comment: Simon Avarro, Edgar.\n9:37 Comment: How nice the control.\n9:39 Comment: I control the ball, Edgar.\n9:41 Comment: Missing James.\n9:45 Comment: What the Colombian is arguing about.\n9:47 Comment: I didn't think so at first.\n9:49 Comment: James says he touches the ball.\n9:53 Comment: And it does seem to touch her.\n9:56 Comment: Finally the Galician referee.\n9:59 Comment: Ten minutes of the second period.\n10:1 Comment: The Real Madrid that has doubled its advantage.\n10:4 Comment: Thanks to Mauro dos Santos' own goal.\n10:11 Comment: With this he has put Earth in the middle.\n10:16 Comment: Now he transfers to Almería that risky situation of looking for the ball.\n10:22 Comment: The Andalusians are not ambitious with the risk of conceding more goals.\n10:26 Comment: Don't keep measuring your steps too much.\n10:29 Comment: Mané.\n10:31 Comment: The ball that didn't touch him.\n10:34 Comment: Trujillo clears Pepe.\n10:36 Comment: Committed clearance also from the Portuguese.\n10:42 Comment: Another corner for Almería.\n10:47 Comment: Mané places the ball.\n10:49 Comment: Corona is also offered there.\n10:51 Comment:  Crown.\n10:53 Comment: Mané.\n10:55 Comment: Looks like what he's going to do is hang up.\n10:57 Comment: He closes the ball a lot.\n10:59 Comment: The hibriferico plays in Barán.\n11:1 Comment: Angel Trujillo's final header.\n11:3 Comment: I was about to touch the Tomás there in the short.\n11:6 Comment: It would have been an extension there.\n11:12 Comment: Illarramendi pay attention to defend the first post.\n11:16 Comment: Barán had also been embedded.\n11:18 Comment: Well, it is true that Mané threw with great danger.\n11:22 Comment: Still out of the Saints game.\n11:29 Comment: Almería is already

Ball stopped and stepping into the Real Madrid area.\n14:48 Comment: Which is why the Italian does not want to rush.\n14:52 Comment: Ball headed by Baranes for Mauro dos Santos.

Comment: We see here in the replay how there are two players in the finishing zone.\n16:27 Comment: One who accompanies from the second line.\n16:29 Comment: The changes that are now going to

there are still few balls arriving.\n16:56 Comment: What I said, change in Almería.\n16:58 Comment: The first one who will perform is Calván Celotti.\n17:0 Comment: Isco is going to enter.\n17:2 Comment: And we will immediately clear up doubts about who the substituted player is.\n17:7 Comment: But there is more.\n17:9 Comment: There will be two.\n17:11 Comment: Ancelotti is going to make a double change.\n17:13 Comment: So it will equal the number of changes to Almería.\n17:19 Comment: Well, it could very well be James and Kroos.\n17:29 Comment: The ball for Mané.\n17:34 Comment:  Crown.\n17:36 Comment: Chimo Navarro.\n17:38 Comment: Jonathan Zongo opens up.\n17:40 Comment: Emed waits in the center.\n17:42 Comment: Chimo Navarro has asked Emed for something that Emed can no longer give him.\n17:46 Comment: That maybe he can't hit it at any time.\n17:48 Comment: That's so much speed to get to that ball.\n17:50 Comment:  It was impossible.\n17:52 Comment: And the change of Sergi, of Espinosa, for Tomás.\n17:58 Comment: I interpret it as a player who can give me a lot, Tomás.\n18:5 Comment: I'm not going to wear him out too much.\n18:8 Comment: In a match that can practically be said to be decided.\n18:13 Comment: Christian.\n18:14 Comment: Christian, the same, painting and dribbling, but without being able to go deep towards the goal.\n18:22 Comment: Nor finding a partner.\n18:24 Comment: Pepe loses the ball, Roma-Corona gets ahead of him a lot.\n18:27 Comment: Enabled Emed.\n18:29 Comment: Emed, he's very alone.\n18:31 Comment: Solidarity Zongo gives him a way out.\n18:33 Comment: Espinosa also does it on the left side.\n18:35 Comment: The ball for Zongo.\n18:37 Comment: He read the pass.\n18:39 Comment: And Ramendi was cutting a ball that was very dangerous.\n18:41 Comment: It had turned out very well.\n18:43 Comment: Illa-Ramendi had done very well to cover Pepe's rise.\n18:50 Comment: The changes to Paris arrive at Real Madrid.\n18:54 Comment: Well, the first one to leave is James, author of the great goal with which Real Madrid opened the scoring.\n19:0 Comment: And he will leave surrounded by significant applause.\n19:4 Comment: And the next change will be that Illa-Ramendi will leave so that Lucas can enter.\n19:9 Comment: Illa-Ramendi hasn't found out.\n19:13 Comment: The band, Chendo Illa-Ramendi, is telling him now.\n19:17 Comment: I don't know if he hadn't found out or didn't want to find out.\n19:19 Comment: No, he hadn't found out.\n19:22 Comment: I told him about Kroos for two reasons.\n19:27 Comment: Because Kroos is a player who can be very important for the rest of the season.\n19:36 Comment: As he has been throughout this season that he is playing.\n19:41 Comment: And for the fact that it gives more confidence to Illa-Ramendi.\n19:49 Comment: Especially given the situation, as you said, there have been a couple of moments in which it seems that there is a certain sector of the public that does not agree with the game that Illa-Ramendi plays.\n20:1 Comment: He is a footballer who clearly needs confidence, but confidence is not in a drawer, you open it and take it out.\n20:7 Comment: You have trust or you don't have it.\n20:10 Comment: And right now Illa-Ramendi doesn't have it, he doesn't reflect it on the field.\n20:14 Comment: The crowd also doubts him.\n20:16 Comment: Even his coach at certain times has also doubted him.\n20:20 Comment: If we adhere to the decisions made.\n20:23 Comment: Your situation is not easy.\n20:27 Comment: It is difficult for me to disagree with Ancelotti about anything.\n20:32 Comment: And if I have a drawback, it is the fact that for my taste I should have done more rotations, to put it simply, throughout the season.\n20:50 Comment: He's starting to do them in this last stretch, for four or five games.\n20:56 Comment: I think I should have done them much sooner.\n20:59 Comment: And it is one of the few times that I am going to disagree with Ancelotti.\n21:3 Comment: Third change in the Almería ranks, third and last.\n21:7 Comment: And I think, just as Roberto Manu Saroya hinted before, that Sergi is thinking about the next game.\n21:13 Comment: He's thinking about him, Celta.\n21:15 Comment: Indeed, it removes Bersa, who is one of the fixed players, one of the pillars around which this Almería is founded.\n21:22 Comment: It indicates that he is already thinking about future meetings.\n21:25 Comment: Bersa leaves in rear.\n21:29 Comment: Corner kick for Real Madrid.\n21:31 Comment: Iglesias Villanueva stopped the game for a moment to avoid, to ask that there be no holds in the area.\n21:38 Comment: Chicharito was the one who was there struggling with an Almería defender.\n21:42 Comment: Kroos, Kroos' ball goes very long and there are no options for potential Real Madrid finishers.\n21:48 Comment: Mane mirrored.\n21:51 Comment: Arbeloa.\n21:53 Comment: Isco and Kroos ask Kroos for peace of mind because the ball reaches the German comfortably.\n21:57 Comment: Isco.\n21:59 Comment: Isco cuts to one side, he wanted to put the pass for Gesé, he returns the ball to Isco.\n22:4 Comment: Isco and Arbeloa.\n22:6 Comment: Alvaro Arbeloa.\n22:8 Comment: Shoot the ball in Dubarbier.\n22:11 Comment:  Corner kick.\n22:14 Comment: Isco came out plugged into the game, absorbing the ball, looking for ball possession and also facing players.\n22:22 Comment: Yes, 25 minutes to take advantage of and enjoy. The game is now on.\n22:32 Comment: Kroos, finish, he's going to leave.\n22:37 Comment: Mauro Dos Santos, who stayed there, almost on top of Rafael Varane so as not to let him head easily.\n22:46 Comment: The Frenchman's ball, as you see, has gone to the left of Rubén's goal.\n22:50 Comment: What fights are there in the area. Everyone plays their weapons, the attacker and the defender.\n22:59 Comment: Varane put his body in, Dos Santos held him with his arm.\n23:5 Comment: Rafael Varane, crown, Tomer Emed.\n23:10 Comment: Emed turns, puts a good ball for Zongo.\n23:13 Comment: The stealing of the ball on the counter is not bad either.\n23:15 Comment: Isco and Kroos. Kroos sends the ball towards Gesé.\n23:20 Comment: Gesé receives. Chicharito is arriving in the area too, Cristiano.\n23:25 Comment: Another corner kick.\n23:28 Comment: This time Gesé's center hits Duarvier.\n23:34 Comment: Real Madrid is looking for the third. Real Madrid, I don't know if it's a coincidence or not, but the two players who have entered, who almost haven't entered yet,\n23:42 Comment: The team has changed. There is a little more speed, we are seeing a little more spark.\n23:48 Comment: Perhaps more than the presence of the two players has been the message, which perhaps has penetrated.\n23:54 Comment: Today also has to do with what Almería is contributing.\n24:0 Comment: His ownership has significantly decreased.\n24:6 Comment: Chimón Avarro has gone to the left.\n24:8 Comment: His ownership has significantly decreased.\n24:12 Comment: Chimón Avarro escapes. Chimón Avarro puts in the center. Keylor Navas.\n24:16 Comment: Their possession has significantly decreased. It is more difficult for them to reach the defensive retreat.\n24:28 Comment: It was a foul from Cristiano. He put out his arm and stopped him.\n24:31 Comment: Mauro Santos, Cristiano Ronaldo, who was superior in the race.\n24:37 Comment: Villanueva has not indicated anything.\n24:40 Comment: Kroos.\n24:43 Comment: Isco.\n24:45 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo runs quickly to the finishing zone. Chicharito has seen him.\n24:49 Comment: Cristiano.

Cristiano. Shows the shot. Doesn't execute.\n25:15 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo in good condition.\n25:17 Comment: Before Madrid received in intermediate zones between the line of midfielders and defense of Real Madrid we have barely seen it.\n25:30 Comment: And now we are seeing it more and more.\n25:34 Comment: Clara is missing. He grabs her arm, stops her from running. Clara is missing.\n25:41 Comment: Ruben, he hits that ball with his right leg. Pepe heads it.\n25:47 Comment: Mauro dos Santos. Lucas Silva. Jonathan Zongo. Cristiano and Chivo Navarro.\n25:55 Comment: Dangerous play by Chivo Navarro. He took the ball, showing the iron there.\n26:0 Comment: Real Madrid came out quickly. Isco. Isco to the box. Isco who cuts. Isco who dribbles. Isco continues. A ribbon.\n26:8 Comment: Isco, in the end, can't handle Ángel Trujillo, who is the one who takes the ball away from him.\n26:15 Comment: Isco has that particular constitution and obviously that talent.\n26:20 Comment: There are times when when the tape breaks it seems like it's even going to fall to the ground.\n26:24 Comment: That he is almost defeated but no. The one who is defeated is the defender.\n26:27 Comment: From Barbier. This is what happened to Gordillo.\n26:30 Comment: It seemed like he was going to fall and he was on the ground and suddenly he threw a cut to an extraordinary center.\n26:37 Comment: Chivo Navarro.

Real Madrid floor.\n27:24 Comment: It generated feelings of possibility of getting closer to the goal but the center lasted very little.\n27:32 Comment: Chivo Navarro. Zongo. Jonathan Zongo.\n27:37 Comment: He deploys his stride there and then takes a cross.\n27:41 Comment: Tiar Veloa easily leaves with the chest for Keylor Navas.\n27:46 Comment: Keylor Navas. He played very little game as a starter and in the end he could hardly be valued.\n27:58 Comment: Yes. We saw now how he was addressing Varane.\n28:5 Comment: Duvalier mismeasured. Crosses to Cristiano. What a ball from Cristiano. Remote. Chicharito out.\n28:11 Comment: Dos Santos bothered Javier Hernández just enough so that the shot was not accurate.\n28:18 Comment: Cristiano's passing and hitting is wonderful and Chicharito had gained the position well from Dos Santos.\n28:27 Comment: But he can't fully turn his ankle because to gain position he had to get too far ahead of the near post.\n28:36 Comment: And there you have to turn your ankle a lot and the ball was very touched and it is a difficult technical action.\n28:46 Comment: Álvaro Arbeloa. Mané's turn. Throw-in.\n28:52 Comment: It is the tenth game that Keylor Navas has played as a starter. Memory was being made there.\n28:58 Comment: During his time at Levante, in a match they got to Keylor Navas, I'm not going to say a number.\n29:5 Comment: More than ten games that Godfather watches.\n29:8 Comment: The truth would still be missing, of course, but the games were mainly at home with Real Madrid.\n29:13 Comment: The rival's arrivals are very few.\n29:18 Comment: Isco and Kroos complain about a lack of Zongo.\n29:23 Comment: Iglesias Villanueva did not indicate to him that in the last few minutes some infractions were being left out.\n29:31 Comment: Toni Kroos.\n29:34 Comment: Odegar who warmed up and Odegar who went to the bottom of the bench because Carlo Ancelotti did not consider that he had won.\n29:44 Comment: Chivo Navarro is having a good soba.\n29:47 Comment: In his first yellow of the game, Beco came on with that foul against Chivo Navarro.\n29:54 Comment: Slap has appeared there on the beak.\n29:59 Comment: It's a good match.\n30:7 Comment: That action is what costs the yellow team, the Portuguese.\n30:12 Comment: Well, let's see if Manea the third gets it right.\n30:17 Comment: Manea's goal.\n30:20 Comment:  Third.\n30:35 Comment: Manea's goal.\n30:38 Comment: It's short again, the three of them have been very short.\n30:41 Comment: Also pay attention to Arbeloa, who I think already foresaw where the ball was going to go after the previous serves.\n30:47 Comment: Isco lets Kroos pass, Lucas Silva.\n30:50 Comment: The Brazilian used his body well to get away from Mauro dos Santos.\n30:54 Comment: Pepe joins the attack, Cristiano runs waiting for Gesee.\n30:57 Comment: The Canary and Dumarvier.\n30:59 Comment: Gesee has tried that action three times in the game and all three times Dumarvier has read it to him.\n31:2 Comment: That attempted shot on the run, subtle touch.\n31:6 Comment: He has waited for her, he has waited for her well.\n31:9 Comment: Pepe, Gesee, Kroos, Isco.\n31:13 Comment: There you saw how Manea was, how tired he is.\n31:16 Comment:  Cristiano Ronaldo.\n31:19 Comment: He manages to get his left leg into Chivo Navarro.\n31:22 Comment: Good defense by Chivo Navarro, going inside where he has help and being very attentive to put his foot in to intercept the ball.\n31:33 Comment: I don't know if both Roberto and you have a better memory than me.\n31:38 Comment: I want to remember, let's see that ball from Hachí Charito, that Chivo Navarro has already had good games paired with Cristiano in confrontations against Real Madrid.\n31:49 Comment: Matches in which Cristiano, above all, fell towards the left wing.\n31:53 Comment: I thank you for trusting in my memory, but it's not enough for me.\n31:58 Comment: And Roberto Caglia with which he grants.\n32:2 Comment: Ruben is going to take out.\n32:5 Comment: Today he is certainly playing an extraordinary game.\n32:9 Comment: But not only with Cristiano, Cristiano has moved at times on his side, but he has appeared in many more places.\n32:19 Comment: Kroos, Corona plays, take the ball from Kroos, Tomer, Emid.\n32:24 Comment: Emid, counter, Rafael Barán takes the ball, Emid, Emid slips.\n32:31 Comment: He went to the ground and well when he already seemed to have the possibility of the shot.\n32:36 Comment: Among other things due to fatigue.

I think they have found a better Almería than they expected.\n38:2 Comment: An Almería with brashness, but above all with very clear ideas, especially with the ball.\n38:8 Comment: The explosive Gesee gets into the kitchen. Gesee's pass was not selfish.\n38:13 Comment: He looked for Cristiano.\n38:15 Comment: But the thing is that from the outline of the play it seemed that it was going to be Gesee who finished it.\n38:20 Comment: Chimo Navarro has calf problems after the last jump he had with Cristiano.\n38:25 Comment: In this sprint it has already been noticed that he was lagging a little behind.\n38:27 Comment: He is trying to stretch Almería's right back.\n38:29 Comment: He gave Mauro dos Santos a sideways glance, indicating that he was going to have to help him because he was going to have a very difficult time.\n38:35 Comment: What surprises me is that it's just Chimo Navarro because the truth is that Chimo has taken a beating, but well, so have the rest of his teammates.\n38:43 Comment: Cross. Cristiano touches the ball that went backwards, towards the outside of the area.\n38:49 Comment: As almost always in these situations, Cristiano is...\n38:53 Comment: Disco Chicharito, Chicharito...\n38:55 Comment:  Chicharito...\n38:58 Comment: Arbeloa golea.\n39:1 Comment: The pose of the Mexican and Arbeloa who was in the hunting area, goals.\n39:7 Comment: And that only adds to his tally that is meager in goals throughout his career at Real Madrid.\n39:13 Comment: But there's another one left for the score 3-0 and Real Madrid, in case there was any doubt, I think they've finished tying up the game.\n39:22 Comment: I think there was no doubt. I have already said several times that at 2-0 the game was over.\n39:32 Comment: Isco's pass is extraordinary. Chicharito's control of space is great to give continuity to the play with that first touch.\n39:42 Comment: And then he does what he has to do. I mean, he makes a pass, he throws a pass down the middle.\n39:48 Comment: Cristiano was behind Arbeloa waiting for him. He was there almost celebrating the goal. I think that if Arbeloa realizes that Cristiano is there, he moves away.\n39:58 Comment: He has the last change in Real Madrid's line. In the end, Ancelotti, who was expecting the third, is going to make it.\n40:4 Comment: Well, Varane leaves, Nacho comes in. A Varane who leaves very, very applauded. A Varane who this season is fulfilling the...\n40:11 Comment: Well, greater participation with the white team, so I...\n40:15 Comment: But today he didn't have a good game.\n40:21 Comment: We wouldn't have expected more from him.

He is a player who has extraordinary qualities. He has many things to learn because he is very young.\n40:51 Comment: But the powers he has, the conditions he has are to be a first-class central defender, which he already is.\n41:1 Comment: Change of pace from Cristiano. Cross from Cristiano. Chicharito who arms his right leg. He wanted to hook Molea's ball. He did it.\n41:9 Comment: But not as he would have liked.\n41:12 Comment: Sometimes those hits, when you attack them from top to bottom, knock you off and the goalkeeper has the trouble of going over him.\n41:25 Comment: But this time it came out too strong.\n41:30 Comment: Ruben who is going to send the ball into the opponent's field. Ancelotti who has already looked for Comodo on his bench.\n41:41 Comment: I think that that border, that of Real Madrid's third goal, Carlo Ancelotti had been waiting for for a long time.\n41:47 Comment: I say it for everything.

He is the Rivera. Rivera then. Then he became Rivera on his own merits.\n42:25 Comment: A nice professional career, by the way.\n42:27 Comment: He was one of the players with the greatest transformation.

    "summary": "On a bustling evening at Santiago Bernabéu, Real Madrid faced off against Almería in a thrilling La Liga encounter. From the opening whistle, the tone of the match was profoundly influenced by key absences and strategic adjustments on both sides. \n\nThe preliminary observances indicated that Real Madrid had slightly unorthodox lineups due to missing some regular starters. Javier Hernández, affectionately known as Chicharito, started energetically, looking towards the heavens as the game commenced. Noteworthy interactions featured him teaming up with James Rodríguez and Álvaro Arbeloa, each striving to assert early domination.\n\nEarly in the first half, Almería exhibited a surprisingly resolute posture. Despite historical thrashings at Bernabéu, the team seemed buoyed by optimism and determination. This commitment was seen in Fran Soriano and Wellington engaging proactively, while Silva and Thievy provided occasional flashes of offensive aspiration. Real Madrid, obliged to adjust by the absence of marquee players like Luka Modric and Gareth Bale, saw contributions from youth fill-ins as Carlo Ancelotti refreshed the squad. The defensive and midfield configurations involved Fabio Coentrão, Toni Kroos, and Illarramendi supporting, while Gesé Rodriguez patrolled the flanks.\n\nReal Madrid began probing down the flanks with Arbeloa and Cristiano Ronaldo featuring early incursions. Ronaldo's trademark dribbles occasionally mesmerized, although physical duels, particularly with Chimo Navarro, became a recurring theme. On 16 minutes, the combination between Fabio and Kroos exhibited Real Madrid's intent, which continued to culminate in several promising but unfulfilled opportunities. James Rodríguez and Chicharito grappled tirelessly for sustained penetration against a well-positioned Almería defense helmed by Angel Trujillo and Mauro dos Santos.\n\nFor every Real Madrid attempt containing Cristiano’s famed bicycle kicks or fancy footwork, Almería was resolute in organizing promptly to stave off danger. The noticeable absence of Karim Benzema influenced Real Madrid's fluidity, accentuating the headline that new scorers had to step up. Meanwhile, Keylor Navas mirrored his team's concentration with strategic goalkeeping, ensuring smooth builds from the back through Varane and Coentrão.\n\nThe restless rhythm saw Javier Hernández fretting bemused refereeing decisions and sustaining dogged contention from Almería's rugged midfield and defense. By the 19th minute, the match's narrative depicted Real Madrid’s relentless yet stifled attempts against an Almería fortified with tactical discipline. Restless work on the wings by Gesé and Cristiano catalyzed a different attacking dimension; a tactical reshuffling often placed James more centrally, thus engendering substantial ventures into the final third, despite few clear-cut chances materializing.\n\nOn the other end, Almería’s blend of counter-attacking craft yielded intermittent threats, chiefly through Edgar Mendez, who frequently capitalized on spaces left unattended by Real Madrid’s forward pushes. Fabien Dubarbier also anchored Almería’s left corridor effectively, countering incursions while strategically forwarding plays up the park. Real Madrid weathered compressed possessive moments with patient tick-tack movement, reliant on Kroos' precise passing and Illarramendi's aptitude to distribute lateral safety plays.\n\nApproaching the 30-minute mark, Almería expressed tactical reprieves, gaining composure with sequences orchestrated by Berza and Corona, interchanging to alleviate midfield pressure. Mané’s crosses aimed at the darting figures of Emed reinforced tactical balance, although the opportunities deciphered posed transient dangers to Navas' vigilant keeping.\n\nEventually, Real Madrid’s volleys intensified; near the 35th minute, consequent rebounds invited scrambles with Varane, James, and even Chicharito questing for scoring breaks. Ronaldo's physical resolve and tactical awareness impacted every attacking flux and countermeasure.\n\nAs the first half dwindled with minutes ebbing away, significant sequences unfolded. Real Madrid’s urgency transformed into fruition in the 44th. Toni Kroos, fast exploiting turnovers, initiated a loose ball battleground. The loose ball opportunist, James Rodríguez, capitalized on an ill-cleared sphere with a superbly executed strike curling into the opposing net’s top left corner—a clinical testament to his proficiency, rendering the crowd ecstatic and Real Madrid leading by an exhilarative solitary margin at the halfway whistle.\n\nInto the second half, despite Almería's aspirations of a bounce back, Real Madrid resumed briskly, amplifying intensity. Javier Hernández cushioned initial plays, relaying effective partnerships with James and Cristiano. By the 48th minute, continuous pressure on Almería culminated in an Own Goal from Mauro dos Santos after a well-orchestrated corner. The miscommunication saw a defensive try cushioning past an aghast Ruben, further widening Real Madrid's lead to 2-0.\n\nAlmeria's resolve and spirited tactical competence remained commendable—they regaled in mindful buildup, foreseeing openings frequently prompted by players like Jonathan Zongo who entered as a substitute. However, Real Madrid's interception schemes and consolidations by players such as Arbeloa, enforced by Lucas Silva's advent from the bench, prevented conclusive threats on the hosts' goal.\n\nMatching tactical nous by regularly pacing the game saw both managers adjusting. Ancelotti's directive yielded captivating momentum—Odegaard's warm-up and Isco's eventual introduction provided flair and fortitude. With increased dynamism on the ball, Isco seamlessly connected passes, facilitating direct runs and escalated involvement from Javier Hernández and Cristiano Ronaldo. Noteworthy, Chicharito embraced sensibility over showmanship, delivering effective shorter passes complementing play instead of resorting merely to goal poaching.\n\nAlmeria's chronic crosses, while demonstrating an attacking intent, fell prey repeatedly to the precision of Real Madrid’s defensive structure. Keylor Navas responded proficiently whenever crosses posed glimmering threats. The  James' movement, on and off the ball, continued to elucidate as he orchestrated incisive plays with Gesee, feeding Cristiano and Chicharito.\n\nThe game's fulcrum shifted decisively by minute 84 when yet another chance orchestrated by Isco culminated in a third goal. Arbeloa affirmed a seldom occurrence, clinching a well-positioned rebound off trick shots between Chicharito and Cristiano. This goal, albeit not abundant in glory over his illustrious Real Madrid tally, underscored Arbeloa cementing the win at 3-0, ending Almería’s hopes.\n\nIn the concluding minutes, gnawing Real Madrid’s remaining sprint for pride was evident, compelling Almeria’s resilience but overstretched defenses broke their movements lethargic. The Santiago Bernabéu reverberated in acclaim, signaling three points favoring Real Madrid. With the fixture’s significance in prelude to an intense La Liga chase, Carlo Ancelotti gathered his troop insights ahead of an identical week’s monumental duel against Sevilla.\n\nConclusively, Real Madrid’s blend of disciplined open plays, strategic substitute deployments, and couple moments of class finishers played out an edict deserving victory. Amidst challenges, the Blancos conditioned themselves top-tier, absorbed and adapted to carve out another assert showing. On the contrary, commendations too for Almería; despite setbacks, they presented a foretaste of tactical age and vigorous adversary testers walking away sans due spoils but heads held commendably high."
