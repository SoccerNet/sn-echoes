You mentioned it.\n9:40 Comment: No no. At first it seemed that there could be some doubt, but the feeling is clear that Arroyo hits the left foot of Luis Suárez with his left foot, who had made good control.\n9:50 Comment: I don't know if the ball went too long or not, but the control had been good.\n9:54 Comment: Suárez who was inside the area, the foul is also clearly seen to be inside the area.\n9:58 Comment: It starts with Suárez's foot above the line and starts already inside the area.\n10:2 Comment: I mean, no doubt. Penalty that seemed clear to us and to the referee too.\n10:8 Comment: And that he transformed by entrusting Panenka, Leo Messi.\n10:13 Comment: Getafe cannot go out due to that pressure, loss of FC Barcelona.\n10:16 Comment: They immediately put pressure on the ball holder.\n10:19 Comment: They don't let him raise his head, see the passing options if he has them.\n10:23 Comment: And therefore in most cases they cause the error.\n10:27 Comment: Leo Messi's 37th goal so far this season.\n10:31 Comment: Always talking only about the league, of course.\n10:34 Comment: 37 in the league.\n10:37 Comment: And Barça will continue to dominate the ball.\n10:42 Comment: That doesn't change.\n10:45 Comment: Playing Omar Bartra.\n10:49 Comment: Barça with complete tranquility. Neymar barely endured Getafe.\n11:1 Comment: By the way, Roberto, it was very surprising.\n11:3 Comment: I don't know if you paid attention to Luis Enrique or the sublets.\n11:6 Comment: Messi's Panenka-style goal was very surprising in that area.\n11:10 Comment: Well, the truth is that the faces were indeed surprising.\n11:12 Comment: Not in Luis Enrique but in assistants and technicians who were close to him.\n11:15 Comment: Since we were coming from a season in which Messi's ability to score penalty goals had been questioned.\n11:20 Comment: That they had crossed each other, that he excelled by throwing the Lopa Nenka.\n11:24 Comment: Well, it already seems confirmation that this is a more than resolved chapter.\n11:28 Comment: And to highlight more than reactions, in the seconds before the penalty shot, Luis Enrique called Bartra.\n11:33 Comment: And he was talking a lot with him.\n11:35 Comment: By his gestures he gave the whole situation that he was talking to him about.\n11:37 Comment: Focus on what FC Barcelona is doing now.\n11:40 Comment: From moving the ball from side to side.\n11:42 Comment: Well, Barça constantly moving it.\n11:44 Comment: Luis Enrique's team had it almost all the time.\n11:46 Comment: Messi wanted to go inside.\n11:48 Comment: Now he stole Lago.\n11:50 Comment: Try to score that ball for Inés Troza.\n11:52 Comment: Bartra crossed well.\n11:53 Comment: Aymar Bartra was very attentive.\n11:57 Comment: And this is what Roberto Rodríguez told us before.\n12:1 Comment: Those instructions from Luis Enrique to Marc Bartra.\n12:5 Comment: Before the penalty was taken by Messi.\n12:7 Comment: Maybe they are also going along the lines they expected.\n12:10 Comment: Probably just one striker.\n12:12 Comment: And Franco's team appears with two forwards.\n12:15 Comment: With Freddy Inés Troza and with Baba.\n12:17 Comment: With both of them in that position.\n12:18 Comment: And maybe there is some slogan for a more scoring player.\n12:21 Comment: Matíe maybe more marker.\n12:22 Comment: And Bartra freeing a little.\n12:24 Comment: And when they meet two against two.\n12:26 Comment: Well, maybe I wanted to clarify it.\n12:31 Comment: It is a foul that Rafinha receives.\n12:33 Comment: Very close to the peak of the area.\n12:35 Comment: The right peak according to Barça's attack.\n12:37 Comment: A Barça that is practically playing in 40 meters at most.\n12:40 Comment: And a Getafe too.\n12:41 Comment: Because Barça is almost in the Getafe area all the time.\n12:46 Comment: Monopolizing the position of the ball.\n12:48 Comment: The clear foul as seen in the replay.\n12:50 Comment: The clear contact with Rafinha and the knockdown.\n12:53 Comment: Therefore, to those who want to be international.\n12:57 Comment: To all of Brazil.\n12:58 Comment: And pay attention to the strategy that FC Barcelona is achieving many goals this year.\n13:2 Comment: In League plays.\n13:4 Comment: Well, Messi is ready there.\n13:6 Comment: Messi and Xavi.\n13:7 Comment: Go two.\n13:8 Comment: It does not seem like it is a position for a direct shot from Leo Messi.\n13:12 Comment: Therefore, it is normal for Juan to arrive.\n13:14 Comment: In the center of Xavi.\n13:15 Comment: What's going on.\n13:16 Comment: Xavi's delivery went to the far post.\n13:18 Comment: And that's a corner.\n13:19 Comment: For the Catalan team.\n13:21 Comment: To the left of Güeyta's goal.\n13:28 Comment: And the goal of the second half.\n13:31 Comment: The ball that Xavi is going to leave there on the ground.\n13:36 Comment: Messi is nearby.\n13:37 Comment: Behind him.\n13:41 Comment: Uploaded the centrals.\n13:42 Comment: Two excellent headers.\n13:44 Comment: Bartra and Mathieu.\n13:47 Comment: In the center of Xavi.\n13:48 Comment: And Rafinha's shot above.\n13:51 Comment: It's not the whole strategy.\n13:52 Comment: No no.\n13:53 Comment: That's how it comes out.\n13:54 Comment: Also with all the intention.\n13:55 Comment: And a strong shot from Rafinha.\n13:57 Comment: Launching\n13:58 Comment: A little bit has gone up.\n13:59 Comment: Yes Yes.\n14:0 Comment: Rehearsed play.\n14:1 Comment: He really is a player who is at the front of the area.\n14:4 Comment: And seeing that it is not covered by anyone.\n14:6 Comment: They generate that space so that no rival comes.\n14:9 Comment: And there Rafinha appears.\n14:12 Comment: Although no one had closed conveniently on Getafe's part.\n14:18 Comment: Güeyta kicks out of the door.\n14:21 Comment: And Baba fighting for the ball.\n14:23 Comment: With Sergio Busquets.\n14:24 Comment: That ball that is left for the end.\n14:26 Comment: A mirror of Hadrian.\n14:27 Comment: A real octopus.\n14:28 Comment: It reaches all the balls.\n14:32 Comment: Head touch.\n14:33 Comment: The exceptional Sergio Busquets.\n14:35 Comment: Be careful, he looked good.\n14:36 Comment: Comes out.\n14:37 Comment: Watch out for Bravo.\n14:38 Comment: And at...\n14:41 Comment: Almost goal for Getafe.\n14:43 Comment: But it was almost a goal.\n14:45 Comment: In the same line.\n14:46 Comment: Bravo corrected his own mistake.\n14:49 Comment: And he avoided the goal.\n14:50 Comment: And Getafe's goal.\n14:55 Comment: And he avoided Getafe's tying goal.\n14:58 Comment: He had gone out to Ewsington.\n14:59 Comment: Nor are they Claudio Bravo.\n15:0 Comment: He stayed halfway.\n15:1 Comment: From nowhere.\n15:3 Comment: But then he reacted very well.\n15:5 Comment: He backtracked on his own steps and avoided Getafe's goal.\n15:9 Comment: Keep an eye on Messi now that he is looking for Barça to lead 2-0.\n15:10 Comment: After that scare he had.\n15:13 Comment: We'll see the replay when it's convenient.\n15:14 Comment: Because Getafe was on the verge of tying.\n15:17 Comment: After a mistake.\n15:19 Comment: This one by Claudio Bravo.\n15:20 Comment: The shipment of Inestroza.\n15:22 Comment: And there Claudio avoids the goal.\n15:24 Comment: Claudio Bravo who arrived with just enough to avoid the 1-1.\n15:28 Comment: You say it well, you say it well. Serious mistake by Claudio Bravo. He can't get out when\n15:33 Comment: rival player is with a defender, but the subsequent reaction is truly extraordinary.\n15:39 Comment: How he reacts and how he even deflects the ball when it was almost penetrating the\n15:44 Comment: goal. Therefore, good correction from Claudio Bravo.\n15:48 Comment: I screw it up and I, if the term is valid, screw it up. Claudio Bravo did it all. It\n15:54 Comment: did everything. The bad and then the good for Barça.\n15:56 Comment: And good definition of Freddy. Freddy's action above the Chilean\n16:0 Comment: Nestroza. Let's see if this encourages Getafe. Emi, you seem quite cheerful. Watch out for Baba.\n16:6 Comment: Baba, Baba's finishing touch. Good unchecking by Baba. And two notes since he has good\n16:10 Comment: Emi. Two details from Emi. And Getafe that is beginning to show signs of\n16:14 Comment: that can go up. What we were saying, as the game progresses, logically\n16:19 Comment: Yes, they can grow in confidence despite having conceded that penalty goal from Leo Messi,\n16:23 Comment: but it is the second arrival of Franco's men.\n16:26 Comment: Sergio Busquets opens for Messi. Well, a sign that Getafe is alive in the game.\n16:32 Comment: That penalty hasn't left him out yet. The ball for Luis Suárez. The center of Suárez.\n16:36 Comment: And Messi is going to hit that ball. It's again for the Uruguayan.\n16:41 Comment: And in Suárez playing, having the pause to enable Dani Alves. Suárez, line of\n16:46 Comment: background. Ball for Getafe. Goal kick.\n16:49 Comment: He was surprised by the subsequent assistance of...\n16:54 Comment: Again the previous action of Claudio Bravo.\n17:0 Comment: Bravo's reaction is enormous, because generally when you fail, at the moment of failure, it is difficult\n17:11 Comment: react mentally to the error. Problems now in Getafe. Babas has\n17:15 Comment: He was left lying there on the grass, sitting. The doctors of the Madrid team leave\n17:20 Comment: and FC Barcelona players. They also take the opportunity to come closer so they can take a look,\n17:24 Comment: as is the case of Dani Alves, who seems to have some discomfort on the outside\n17:28 Comment: of the left leg at the ankle. Well, the theme of Babas comes from the play\n17:32 Comment: Getafe's attack. That shot, that deep assist. Here we see the action of\n17:37 Comment: penalty. Bartra's assists. Point to point to Babas, yes. And the lack of a stream.\n17:47 Comment: Contacts inside. Even though he receives the ball outside the area, the contact with the\n17:51 Comment: left foot is inside the area. Yes, there was no doubt about that situation. we said\n17:56 Comment: that Babás' sixth problem has been precisely in the auction, that assist from Emi.\n18:1 Comment: Emi Buendía, on whom we have to stop a little, because he is a player born in\n18:5 Comment: Mar del Plata, Getafe youth player. He comes from Getafe B, therefore he knows it very well\n18:10 Comment: well Pablo Franco and he is still 18 years old. Who celebrated December 25, the day of\n18:15 Comment: Christmas. She turned 18 years old. Emi Buendía, Getafe's number 32. The kid who already\n18:22 Comment: He has left two very good details in this match. Bartra opened for Alves. Alves searching\n18:31 Comment: to Messi. Messi leaning on Alves. The return that is not good in this case. He intercepted\n18:36 Comment: the Lake pass. Juan Rodríguez serves for Pedro León. Let's see Pedro León's shipment. He\n18:42 Comment: Mathieu's mistake. Finally, in Estroza, the Frenchman's doubts and mistakes could not be taken advantage of.\n18:50 Comment: Mathieu. Busquets. Busquets pass. Neymar has to accelerate a little to avoid\n18:57 Comment: that football was out of bounds. 19 minutes of the first half. Long gone. With this 1-0\n19:4 Comment: to leader forum. Opening to Messi. Messi enters. Change the orientation of the game by searching\n19:12 Comment: and finding Neymar. Then Hadrian. They played against each other in the Getafe games. Neymar continues.\n19:16 Comment: They measured Hadrian's hand. Neymar in the area's timetable. Neymar's cross delivery. and lake\n19:22 Comment: He prevented the ball from reaching Messi who was behind Getafe's left back.\n19:26 Comment: Messi. To Dani Alves. Alves gets into the area. He tries to overflow. No. Leave Messi behind.\n19:32 Comment: Messi has the shot. Messi out. Rosarino's stud takes the goal. Take off\n19:39 Comment: door for Danto for Getafe. Guaita will do it. Dani Alves returns to his position.\n19:49 Comment: So far very fixed. There is also no offside as seen in the book.\n19:59 Comment: As long as the book doesn't say otherwise. On that level it seemed like it was enabled.\n20:3 Comment: Luis Suarez. Touch behind by Sergio Busquets. And there is a man from Getafe lying on the grass.\n20:12 Comment: He's going to recover. And it is Inestroza.\n20:17 Comment: Now it's Inestroza. Before, it was Babal who had some physical problem. But the Colombian is also recovering.\n20:22 Comment: What we are seeing is that the three forwards of FC Barcelona maintain their position more than usual.\n20:28 Comment: usual. We saw them in the last game at Cornellal Prat and they were constantly changing,\n20:34 Comment: exchanging positions. And today Messi remains a lot. On the right wing as 9 Luis\n20:41 Comment: Suárez and Neymar totally attached to the band. There goes Luis Suárez. The ball moves forward a lot even though\n20:46 Comment: finally takes it. He has to clear Alexis to Corner. In the previous Corner this strategy came with\n20:52 Comment: that shot from Rafinha that narrowly missed the mark. Let's see now. Barça's strategy in this\n21:1 Comment: corner kick. Also to the left of Guaita's goal. As Messi says to Xavi.\n21:7 Comment: The captain is going to be number 6, the one who hangs that ball.\n21:15 Comment: About the Madrid team area.\n21:26 Comment: Xavi. And the shot that goes to Bartra. He entered like a bull, like a rocket with great determination\n21:33 Comment: with Mar Bartra. But he couldn't specify the shot between the three sticks.\n21:42 Comment: Guaita. While we see Pablo Franco.\n21:46 Comment: With some of his players. Emi Buendía specifically is the one he is talking to.\n21:54 Comment: The Medi Lacen play begins for Getafe. He opens for Lago under pressure from Messi. Messi's foul on the ground.\n22:4 Comment: For Getafe.\n22:8 Comment: He put the ball into play. Lacen for Lago. Getafe lost. Messi. The return of Luis Suárez to\n22:14 Comment: Lionel Messi. The Argentine turns around. Rafinha supports him. The ball is for Luis Suárez. He wants to surprise\n22:21 Comment: Guaita. She hit him too loosely. Do not touch height. He didn't give the Valencian any problems.\n22:28 Comment: Getafe's Valencian goalkeeper.\n22:34 Comment: A gift it was in that case.\n22:41 Comment: Guaita long route. Searching for Baba. He touches Baba's head. Ines Troza controls.\n22:46 Comment: Sergio Busquets was very attentive, as always, the one who recovered for Rafinha.\n22:50 Comment: Hadrian.\n22:53 Comment: Hadrian is not needed. The ball goes straight out. To the left side.\n23:3 Comment: It looks like a statue. Luis Enrique absolutely concentrated.\n23:8 Comment: In the band. Robles and Ballon Matíez. The former Valencia player was attentive there.\n23:13 Comment: Velázquez preceded himself. The player on loan from Atlético de Madrid. Look out for Ines Troza arriving.\n23:17 Comment: Baba is waiting in the center. And Emi was also at the second post. That's from the left.\n23:22 Comment: The first for Getafe that has a great pitcher. Be careful with this situation too. It is a great\n23:26 Comment: pitcher like Pedro León. And great heads Alexis, Juan Rodríguez, Velázquez, Babá.\n23:32 Comment: Ines Troza. They all go very well together.\n23:38 Comment: And it wouldn't be the first time that Barça was scored against in Getafe. I remember a goal from Valera in the Coliseum.\n23:46 Comment: Which served to win the game. The last time Getafe beat Barcelona was on that occasion.\n23:54 Comment: Yes sir. Pedro León's ball. First suit. Velázquez's shot too. Apparently in\n24:0 Comment: strategy is anticipated in the first suit. And the finish there with the twist of the neck. Velazquez\n24:6 Comment: but he didn't score a goal. The Uruguayan's shot. Sergi Busquets playing.\n24:16 Comment: Neymar with Xavi. Xavi again for Neymar. This delays Sergi Busquets.\n24:27 Comment: Busquets opened. Dani Alves open on the wing. Messi receives. Messi's center.\n24:35 Comment: What a goal from Luis Suárez.\n24:41 Comment: What a great goal Barça just scored thanks to Lionel Messi's pass.\n24:48 Comment: And for the unchecking and the marvelous definition of a true devourer of goals that is Luis Suárez.\n24:57 Comment: Luis Suarez. What a great goal Messi and Suárez have produced. The 2-0.\n25:3 Comment: Very difficult. Very difficult. Yes, it is true that Leo Messi's assist was very good but Luis Suárez almost had his back to the goal.

that was too past and too strong\n42:43 Comment: that each arrival is either a goal or almost a goal.\n42:46 Comment: Almost a goal, indeed, or a goal or almost a goal, and it has logically affected Getafe\n42:51 Comment: because of how the goals have arrived, even though they have a wonderful aesthetic,\n42:56 Comment: but logically the self-esteem of Franco's players has to make them react.\n43:5 Comment: Within that mutual marking that is done, that is done in Barça and Real Madrid,\n43:13 Comment: Well, in this match there are still incentives for Barça, but one of them I think would be\n43:19 Comment: overcome the big win of the season so far, which if I remember correctly is 9-1,\n43:24 Comment: from Real Madrid to Granada, a few days ago.\n43:28 Comment: Within that marking always between the two coconuts, between the two big ones,\n43:33 Comment: Well, maybe that also nests in the heads of the Barça players to try to achieve\n43:37 Comment: the biggest win of the season, as I say, surpassing Real Madrid's 9-1\n43:43 Comment: to Granada a few weeks ago.\n43:47 Comment: At the moment 5-0 at halftime, for now, there are two minutes left.\n43:52 Comment: That

Comment: Alex Philippe and Ibi are warming him up, they are the two whom Pablo Franco has sent to warm up\n44:7 Comment: Since this first part has already escaped him, he will not be able to do anything,\n44:11 Comment: The party is, it is difficult to say, but it is already more than sentenced, so it will give options\n44:16 Comment: to players from the quarry, as he did today in the starting eleven with Emi.\n44:20 Comment: Rafinha playing for the moment, Rafinha for Sergio Busquets, he turns with absolute calm.\n44:26 Comment: Busquets, Rafinha, Xavi, Xavi opens, Xavi for Neymar, Neymar combines with Xavi,\n44:36 Comment: Xavi opens, well with a pause for Adriano's arrival.\n44:43 Comment: The goal is for Getafe already in the last minute of the first half, Emi left behind,\n44:47 Comment: Lago, Inestroza's header, it's good for Emi, Emi arrives under pressure from Dani Alves,\n44:53 Comment: Emi who drives, Emi who finds Baba, Baba who can shorten the distance

    "summary": "Barcelona displayed an extraordinary performance, thrashing Getafe 6-0 in a La Liga match played at the Camp Nou.\n\nFrom the opening whistle, Barcelona's dominance was clear. Gerard Piqué watched from the stands as Luis Enrique's team systematically dismantled Getafe's defense. Sergio Busquets, Adriano, and Dani Alves were exceptional, threading precise passes and orchestrating the attack with skill and composure.\n\nThe match's early moments set the tone for Barcelona's control. Barcelona's midfield, led by Xavi in his 501st league appearance, orchestrated the fluid movement of the ball. Neymar, Messi, and Luis Suárez continuously probed Getafe's defensive lines, creating an atmosphere where a goal seemed inevitable.\n\nAdriano, deputizing for the suspended Jordi Alba, showed his versatility and awareness on the left flank. Messi and Alves combined brilliantly on the right side, consistently pushing Getafe back and creating numerous opportunities. Getafe, struggling to find their footing, were pinned back in their half as Barcelona monopolized possession.\n\nAround the seventh minute, Barcelona's relentless pressure bore fruit when a defensive error by Arroyo led to a penalty. Luis Suárez was clipped inside the box after a quick interplay involving Marc Bartra and Messi. The referee, Fernández Borbalán, pointed to the spot without hesitation. Messi stepped up and executed a calm, Panenka-style penalty, sending the goalkeeper the wrong way. With this early breakthrough, Barcelona had the 1-0 lead.\n\nThe Catalans continued to press, maintaining a high defensive line and suffocating any Getafe attempts to progress beyond their half. Marc Bartra, alongside Mathieu in defense, thwarted a brief moment of Getafe resurgence through precise interceptions and clearances.\n\nIn the 25th minute, Messi turned provider, lofting a delightful ball into the path of Suárez. The Uruguayan, with his back to the goal, managed an acrobatic finish, showcasing his predatory instincts to double Barcelona's lead. Getafe's defense looked helpless against the fluid, attacking prowess of the home side.\n\nNot long after, another defensive lapse from Medi Lachen, caught in possession deep in their half, led to a third goal for Barcelona. Neymar, benefiting from the pressure exerted by the Barca forwards, received the ball in a dangerous area. With finesse and composure, Neymar slid the ball past Guaita, making it 3-0.\n\nIn the space of a few minutes, Barcelona had dismantled any semblance of resistance from Getafe. The midfield duo of Rafinha and Xavi continued to exert their influence, while Busquets masterfully dictated the pace, sweeping up any loose balls with his characteristic calmness.\n\nApproaching the half-hour mark, Xavi created another moment of magic. Receiving the ball just outside the area, he curled a magnificent shot into the top corner, leaving Guaita no chance. The Camp Nou erupted in acknowledgment of their iconic captain's brilliance, celebrating a remarkable team effort capped with a solo moment of genius.\n\nThe goals continued to flow as Barcelona's front trio seemed insatiable. Suarez, once again displaying why he’s considered one of the world's elite strikers, added a fifth. Assisted by Messi, Suárez's powerful shot from the edge of the box found the back of the net. Barcelona's 5-0 lead before halftime highlighted not just their offensive capabilities but their sheer efficiency and hunger to dismantle Getafe completely.\n\nBy halftime, the scoreline showed a decisive 5-0, reflecting Barcelona's control and ruthless finishing. Any semblance of resistance from Getafe had been comprehensively quashed. As the teams returned to the dressing room, Barcelona's players displayed unwavering focus and drive, poised to continue their attacking assault.\n\nThe second half began with more of the same relentless pressure from Barcelona. Getafe's coach Pablo Franco attempted to stir things up by making substitutions, bringing in fresh legs such as Ibi for Babá and Alex Felipe for Juan Rodriguez. However, these changes did little to alter the course of the match. Just two minutes into the second half, Barcelona once again found the net. Messi, positioned on the right, cut inside and unleashed a powerful left-footed shot that nestled into the corner of the Getafe goal. With his double, the score rose to 6-0, further asserting Barcelona’s dominance.\n\nFrom then on, the Camp Nou witnessed a controlled performance from Barcelona as they eased off the accelerator yet continued to maintain overwhelming possession and create chances. Getafe found it incredibly challenging to break through, with Barcelona's defense marshaled expertly by Bartra and the industrious efforts of Adriano and Montoya, the latter having replaced Dani Alves in the second half.\n\nDespite Barcelona’s reduced intensity, they still managed to carved out opportunities. A particularly memorable attempt saw Messi and Suárez, showcasing their immaculate understanding, engage in a mesmerizing interplay narrowly missing another scoring chance.\n\nGetafe's chances to close the gap remained sparse, but their most notable moment came from Freddy Nestroza, whose shot hit the post following an uncharacteristic mistake by Claudio Bravo. This moment of danger underscored Barcelona's almost impeccable defensive performance. Bravo's quick recovery and subsequent positioning, however, ensured that his mistake went unpunished.\n\nAs the game moved towards its conclusion, Luis Enrique integrated fresh legs by introducing Pedrito, a fan favorite whose entrance was met with resounding applause. Pedro replaced Xavi, who left the field to a standing ovation, his performance a testament to his continued excellence and influence.\n\nThe latter stages of the match saw Barcelona comfortably managing the game, retaining their considerable lead. The occasional forays by Getafe were quickly snuffed out by a well-organized home defense, which transitioned smoothly from attack to defense.\n\nTowards the final minutes, Getafe attempted to press and find a compensatory goal, but their efforts were in vain. They were again thwarted by the disciplined defensive lines and quick counter-pressing led by Busquets and Rafinha.\n\nIn conclusion, Barcelona's 6-0 victory over Getafe was a masterclass in football, demonstrating their attacking prowess, tactical discipline, and overall superiority. The relentless display of goals from Messi, Suárez, Neymar, and Xavi underlined their championship credentials. The victory was a crucial step towards consolidating their position at the top of La Liga, providing yet another unforgettable night at the Camp Nou."
