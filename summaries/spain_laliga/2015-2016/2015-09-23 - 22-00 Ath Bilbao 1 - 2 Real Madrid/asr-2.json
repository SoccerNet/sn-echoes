taking that Card to Mateo Laoz.\n6:25 Comment: Mateo Laoz made the gesture and it seems to me that he is not going to forgive himself.\n6:32 Comment: There is Pepe, there is Marcelo, both of them, keep talking, dialoguing.\n6:37 Comment: There he tells him that he doesn't want those protests, Cristiano Ronaldo smiles, Pepe continues protesting, Yellow Card for the fourth quarter of the game.\n6:48 Comment: There is the action that appears to be a foul by Modric, Cristiano Ronaldo's protest costs him the Card.\n6:55 Comment: Maybe even the rain had something to do with that...\n6:59 Comment: It didn't end up being a clear hit by Dúriz because it seems that his support foot went a little bit at the moment of the hit.\n7:6 Comment: The opposite slippery terrain with the rain.\n7:10

consequence of Atlético taking control of the game.\n22:51 Comment: In the last 10-15 minutes, Madrid had much less of the ball.\n22:55 Comment: And Madrid, if they don't have the ball, Atlético was little by little pushing and arriving.\n23:0 Comment: I think he deserves this draw now.\n23:2 Comment: Julio, we commented on the luxury of footballers that Real Madrid has, but it was not giving way to righteousness.\n23:8 Comment: He was not showing his superiority.\n23:12 Comment: And above all, with the midfield that Madrid has, if you don't have the ball as much as you need to have it,\n23:19 Comment: The game is even.

How well Isco uses the ball!\n24:45 Comment: What a deep ball he hits diagonally on arrival!\n24:49 Comment: Real Madrid players queuing up for the auction!\n24:53 Comment: And Karim Benzema scores the second with Chingurri's monumental anger again!\n24:59 Comment: Valverde celebrates it. Real Madrid fans celebrate Karim Benzema.\n25:4 Comment: Well, that anger is understandable. We see that...\n25:8 Comment: Where is Valenciaga going? Yes, yes, he is missing in action, right?\n25:12 Comment: But how does that ball also reach Karim Benzema?\n25:15 Comment: Isco puts it in the zone, but then no one intercepts it.\n25:19 Comment: But how the hell can Isco have such a large number of free hectares?\n25:26 Comment: It's a succession of mistakes, Michael. First, Isco is alone, he can't be alone.\n25:30 Comment: And Modric is also quite alone. Imagine, leaving Modric alone, he quickly finds the space.\n25:36 Comment: Everything was born with Modric. There goes Atleti Club, the long shot. Raúl García over the goal.\n25:41 Comment: Modric is the one who gives the pass to Isco and reads it as Modric is. The reading of the game is wonderful, but it is true that Isco is alone.\n25:48 Comment: On this occasion I had little to read. No, no, it was like this or something.\n25:52 Comment: Valenciaga makes a decision, which is precisely to go and pressure Modric in the midfield, who is clearly not his equal.\n25:59 Comment: And besides, it's not his area. And of course, he leaves a tremendous amount of space behind him, no less than for Isco.\n26:5 Comment: Well, Isco is leaving the field.\n26:9 Comment: And leaving that assist, that play in today's game for the man from Malaga, very tired.\n26:14 Comment: Isco also leaves the field of play. Rafa Benítez takes advantage to give instructions, instructions to Toni Kroos.\n26:20 Comment: Talking with Rafa Barán, he is with Kovacic because Gesés is going to enter, Isco is retiring.\n26:25 Comment: First change of the game, first change in Madrid. And Valverde responded quickly.\n26:30 Comment: Miquel San José leaves, with a standing ovation Miquel Rico enters the field of play.\n26:35 Comment: It is difficult to understand what Rafa Benítez is trying to explain with gestures, with his fingers to the players on the Real Madrid line.\n26:43 Comment: It has given the impression that it is a 4-2-3-1 that is marking them. Now we will see.\n26:47 Comment: Play the ball. Kroos, Kroos for Luka Modric, received from Dani Carvajal.\n26:54 Comment: He gives the ball to Gesés, who turns on the turbo as soon as he comes out. There is Gesés, putting the ball in front.\n26:59 Comment: Benzema shot so that the ball went to the right of Gorka Irait's goal.\n27:5 Comment: Well, it's all uphill throughout Tiki's game. It's just that he receives a blow with the gift of the goal.\n27:13 Comment: Rowing, rowing, rowing, they tie, they fit together again and again, row and row.\n27:20 Comment: Ball for the Clínic. Markel plays, Suseta, Luka Modric gets in the leg, recovering for Madrid.\n27:26 Comment: Marcelo played it on Kroos, Kroos for Varane, Varane behind.\n27:28 Comment: How many goals have you scored there on the field? Only one, right?\n27:32 Comment: Yes, yes, well, now... I was already there the entire first half, Michael, I'll tell you the witness with the poplars to Modric. It's a spectacle.\n27:40 Comment: Cristian who plays at the back for Kovacic. Kovacic who has the support of Luka Modric behind.\n27:44 Comment: Modric has Kroos there, he has played on Pepe's position. Carvajal opens up, up top too.\n27:49 Comment: Benzema and Gesés are waiting. Dani Carvajal plays, who threatens to throw the diagonal in front of Sabin Merino.\n27:53 Comment: He plays in front of Raúl García, over Kroos and Kroos behind. The ball goes to Varane.\n27:59 Comment: Varane opens the ball, receives the rain. He gives Marcelo the ball short.\n28:3 Comment: Luka Modric comes with the ball and fakes it, Rico puts pressure on him. He plays short, inside for Kovacic.\n28:8 Comment: He has the support of Benzema on the right and Marcelo on the left.\n28:11 Comment: The Brazilian receives, faces the baseline, takes the pass, near the post.\n28:15 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo doesn't go there, he applauds him from afar. And he takes the ball, goal! He will fall.\n28:19 Comment: He plays now, quickly, on Marcelo's back. Luka Modric covers Marcelo.\n28:24 Comment: Kovacic came with a bullet, the ball was taken. The ball is in play for Athletic Club.\n28:28 Comment: Raúl García has it, Raúl García stopped by Luka Modric. He touches the ball behind Oscar de Marcos.\n28:33 Comment: And this one towards Cheita's ah! delayed position.\n28:37 Comment: Peñat in the central circle, opening the ball for Valenciaga, who controls it in front of the Canario.\n28:42 Comment: Play towards Laporte's position, Laporte joins the halfway line.\n28:45 Comment: He goes, wins the line, looks for the finishing area, looks for the center, the rebound from Rafael Varane.\n28:51 Comment: He's going to protect her, do you know why? He takes a corner for Athletic Club de Bilbao.\n28:55 Comment: Those exits of Laporte driving left-handed are magnificent, he does it very regularly too.\n29:0 Comment: Your truck center, I personally love it.\n29:3 Comment: Athletic Club de Bilbao is going to take a corner.\n29:8 Comment: Peñat prepares to hit the ball. It continues to rain hard on Bilbao.\n29:16 Comment: There goes the hit, near the post. The front defense has taken out the area, it hits Gesé with a header.\n29:22 Comment: Attention at the start, Madrid is wrong, it hits them hard. What a great save by Keylor Navas!\n29:27 Comment: When De Marcos hit, what a stop he just made!\n29:32 Comment: Kovacic plays it, the ball touches Susa Eta and it is a throw-in for Real Madrid.\n29:40 Comment: Keylor Navas will not have a record. He was duri, he was duri.\n29:43 Comment: He's saying no because it was duri who hit the ball and Keylor Navas, Michael Dunn, are going to be very fine.\n29:50 Comment: We are enjoying a game that has many alternatives.\n29:54 Comment: Athletic Club is already on the charge once again, we are seeing in Madrid.\n29:59 Comment: It is not completely imposing itself, without the scoreboard, but Athletic Club has the feeling that it is still alive.\n30:6 Comment: A great game, because each one uses what he knows, what he can, what he has. And they both have a lot.\n30:14 Comment: And Madrid, although they scored the second goal right at the key moment, after conceding the equalizer, I think Madrid's second half is clearly inferior to the first.\n30:21 Comment: Marán, touching the ball behind Keylor Navas. He hits the Tico long.\n30:27 Comment: That continues to be life insurance for Real Madrid.\n30:29 Comment: But other things, this one from Saben Merino has conceded only one goal.\n30:34 Comment: And of course there was no possibility of participating in the play to intervene for the goalkeeper.\n30:41 Comment: I didn't even have time to prevent the shot before it occurred.\n30:46 Comment: And once Sabin hits the ball on the back foot and over the crossbar, the Tico has no option to get to the ball.\n30:53 Comment: Pepe puts the ball in, looking for Gese, who strives to reach that ball.\n30:58 Comment: There he fights with Laporte, I don't know if it's a corner, it will be a throw-in, says the assistant.\n31:4 Comment: Not only does Modric do everything he does well, but it's his brain, his reading of football, his positioning on the field,\n31:12 Comment: He's killing it tonight. It's a real pleasure to watch him play football.\n31:17 Comment: Real Madrid is going to get the ball out of bounds.\n31:21 Comment: If he was already clearly above his teammates in the first half, Julio in this second half is far above the rest.\n31:28 Comment: Yes, because it is true that the level has dropped, I think overall of the team, and he is at the same level he had,\n31:34 Comment: For which, frankly, it is a marvel, it is a spectacle and apart from that, not only does it do everything it does well,\n31:40 Comment: and everything is productive for the team, everything.\n31:42 Comment: Luka Modric is going to take a corner, he has his partner, his compatriot Kovacic, short.\n31:48 Comment: Also Kroos, he's going to play with Kovacic.\n31:51 Comment: Again with Modric.\n31:53 Comment: The magician to play inside.\n31:56 Comment: Slow down, attract players and deliver for Carvajal.\n32:0 Comment: Carvajal plays it, he recovers Atlético and came with difficulty from behind, he saves it, playing on the wing.\n32:5 Comment: Long shot up, pay attention to that ball, Marcelo has cut.\n32:8 Comment: A good attempt by Adrisa Duric to open the ball over Markel Susaeta.\n32:13 Comment: Modric back, timing and delivering for Kroos.\n32:16 Comment: Sevilla and Pepe, they have lost the ball.\n32:18 Comment: In the corner, Frico, I think with the hand, I think with the hand indeed Toni Kroos,\n32:25 Comment: because habit has stopped the game.\n32:27 Comment: If he has stopped the game it is because he understands that he has stopped it with his hand, very good.\n32:30 Comment: But...\n32:32 Comment: Pepe's mistake is very serious.\n32:33 Comment: Instead, meanwhile, Ricardo Lazio makes the club ankle.\n32:37 Comment: Kroos says he doesn't touch the ball with his hand, that's why he complains about the cardboard.\n32:43 Comment: Has...\n32:45 Comment: You have this reason, it gives me the feeling that it hits the ass first...\n32:48 Comment: No, not anymore, I don't know anymore.\n32:50 Comment: I no longer have a doubt, yes, yes, it seems bad.\n32:52 Comment: Well yes, it goes and it is.\n32:54 Comment: Yellow cardboard for Kroos.\n32:56 Comment: It's difficult to see if the ball has touched the first and the second.\n32:58 Comment: In any case, the referee was following the play closely.\n33:1 Comment: Well, we mentioned that Rico and Ibai can enter, and they are both already deep in the game.\n33:7 Comment: Attention to the hitting by Beñat, Atlético rises and the baton.\n33:12 Comment: Half turn, Raúl García, goal kick.\n33:16 Comment: Creating danger, set pieces, attention to the Madrid player who is lying in the area and...\n33:20 Comment: Carvajal, right? It seems like Carvajal.\n33:22 Comment: Carvajal, who is lying in the area and...\n33:27 Comment: Carvajal, right? He seems to have suffered a blow to the head.\n33:30 Comment: No, it's just that when he tries to finish...\n33:34 Comment: With the knee, right? Almost, that is, with the foot of the ball, but with the shin guard, he hits.\n33:43 Comment: There it is, in Carvajal's head.\n33:46 Comment: Well, it seems that Dani Carvajal has been remade without any major problems.\n33:50 Comment: And in Madrid a new change is being prepared.\n33:52 Comment: Yes, almost, look, I'm most certainly for Toni Kroos.\n33:58 Comment: Yes, Kroos because of the position, it could be Kroos, Kovács could also be, but come on, I was convinced that it was going to come in for me...\n34:5 Comment: You doubt Kroos because of hierarchy, right?\n34:7 Comment: Yes, yes, yes, but the season hasn't started well, Kroos, far from it.\n34:11 Comment: The ball belongs to Rico, he plays in front of Benzema, throw-in for Real Madrid, the replacement will now take place.\n34:19 Comment: We immediately left doubts, Ricardo.\n34:20 Comment: Well, look, not at all, control football now, the one that Rafa Benítez is looking for at the end of the game, Ricardo.\n34:28 Comment: Well, I'll tell you that Ricardo won't get it now.\n34:31 Comment: With his microphone, it is Casemiro who is going to jump onto the field, it is going to be Benzema, Real Madrid's big scorer, who leaves the game.\n34:40 Comment: Well, Benzema has three goals in the last two games, the goal against Granada and the two today, which means two victories for Madrid if this ends like this.\n34:47 Comment: Right now the Frenchman is impressive.\n34:50 Comment: Benzema in addition to marking Julio, Michael.\n34:53 Comment: The park saving Fijón's game, Carlos, has scored in every game.\n34:57 Comment: Yes, yes, with this five consecutive games scoring and it's not just that he scores, it's that he is a player who provides a tremendous amount of solutions to the rest of his teammates.\n35:8 Comment: I think he's an amazing player.\n35:9 Comment: 35 minutes of the second half.\n35:13 Comment: Madrid leaves only Cristiano up front, Gesé also obviously advanced but also with the attitude of getting into the midfield when Athletic Club has the ball.\n35:24 Comment: Athletic is playing there.\n35:26 Comment: The ball belongs to Beñat.\n35:28 Comment: Beñat who wants to play short with Rico, anticipating Casemiro.\n35:30 Comment: First ball taken.\n35:32 Comment: He plays for Luka Modric.\n35:34 Comment: Modric gives the ball to Dani Carvajal.\n35:36 Comment: Carvajal who is measured in speed.\n35:37 Comment: Grab and therefore Cardboard.\n35:39 Comment: Well, he advanced a few meters across but logically Benítez is aware that Athletic is going to have much more ball in that final stretch to hold on with Casemiro there.\n35:52 Comment: Ricardo, as soon as your microphone works, you tell me so I can get back to you.\n35:58 Comment: Ball that

    "summary": "In a gripping encounter between Athletic Bilbao and Real Madrid at the iconic San Mamés, the match unfolded with all the elements of high drama, tactical battles, and moments of individual brilliance. Real Madrid eventually prevailed with a 2-1 victory over Athletic Bilbao in this La Liga clash that kept fans on the edge of their seats from start to finish. This detailed recounting offers a minute-by-minute dissection of the action-packed duel.\n\nThe game kicked off with Real Madrid asserting early control, with Pepe launching a long ball intended for Cristiano Ronaldo within the first three minutes. Though Ronaldo couldn’t capitalize, the intention was clear: Real Madrid planned to exploit their pace and precision passing to break down Athletic's defenses. Moments later, cheers erupted for the Portuguese superstar, setting the tone for an intense atmosphere.\n\nReal Madrid adopted a flexible formation with a 4-3-3 setup, featuring Benzema in the center, Ronaldo on the left, and Isco floating across the midfield and attacking lines. This fluidity in tactics allowed Madrid to adapt quickly to Atlético's pressure and maintain positional discipline.\n\nAthletic, on their part, brought high energy and physicality to the game, with Raúl García clashing early with Real Madrid's Pepe leading to a whistle for a foul favoring Athletic. This combative spirit was a hallmark of Athletic's approach, particularly in the early exchanges, as they sought to disrupt Madrid's rhythm.\n\nThe first real chance for Athletic came as Aduriz sprinted forward, only to be thwarted by an incredibly agile Varane, who managed to send the ball away for a corner. Set-piece threats from Raúl García and Beñat created moments of worry for Real Madrid, with Keylor Navas forced into action to maintain his clean sheet run.\n\nIn the sixth minute, Real Madrid began to find their feet, stringing together fluid plays that resulted in Benzema taking a shot at goal, which slightly grazed an Atlético defender. This instance hinted at the potential for Madrid’s front line to unlock Athletic's defensive setup.\n\nAthletic responded with pressure that saw the game pendulum back and forth. The midfield was a battleground where Madrid’s trio of Kroos, Modric, and Kovacic often found themselves wrestling the ball from Athletic’s tenacious trio of San José, Beñat, and García. This contest typified the intensity of La Liga football, where no ball is uncontested.\n\nCome the 18th minute, a fateful error by Miquel San José handed Karim Benzema the opening goal. Attempting a risky pass near his penalty area, San José was caught off guard by Benzema’s vigilance. The French forward latched onto the loose ball and calmly slotted it past Iraizoz, sending Madrid into a 1-0 lead. San José’s mistake was a dagger for Athletic, as such lapses are often costly against a side of Real Madrid’s caliber.\n\nAthletic refused to let this setback deter them. They pushed forward with renewed vigor, resulting in several attempts to breach Madrid’s defensive lines. Varane and Pepe were rock-solid, however, limiting the clear chances Athletic had to test Navas.\n\nA tactical chess game ensued, with Real Madrid content to absorb pressure and launch swift counter-attacks. Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, aided by the inventive Isco, posed continuous threats, though Iraizoz stood firm to prevent a further dent in the scoreline. On the other hand, Luka Modric pulled the strings from the midfield, combining flair with tenacity to keep possession and create opportunities.\n\nThe tactical nous of both managers was on full display. Athletic's high press and physicality seemed to initially unsettle Madrid. However, Real Madrid’s adaptability and knack for quick transitional play began to sway the game in their favor. The match oscillated, with Atlético not shying away from playing direct and launching the ball into Madrid’s penalty area at every opportunity.\n\nIn the early stages of the second half, the tempo remained unchanged. Athletic came out with a clear intent to level the score. They peppered Madrid’s goal with crosses and shots, pressing high up the pitch to force errors. Valverde’s men squeezed space and sought any opening that might fall their way.\n\nIn the 67th minute, their persistence bore fruit. A well-executed move saw Valenciaga and Beñat combine to send a lofted ball into the box. Sabin Merino rose above the Madrid defenders, heading the ball past Navas to equalize. The record Keylor Navas sought to break remained intact, yet he couldn’t stop Athletic from equalizing. The Railway End erupted with joy as the scoreboard read 1-1.\n\nThe parity on the scoresheet was indicative of Athletic's dominant phase post-halftime. They continuously harried Madrid’s backline, suffocating any attempt to build from the back. It required all of Madrid’s defensive discipline to keep Athletic from taking the lead.\n\nShortly after, however, Madrid retaliated. Nearly immediately following this equalizer, Luka Modric’s brilliance shone. He effortlessly found Isco in a pocket of space, who then threaded a ball to Benzema. With exemplary composure, the Frenchman restored Madrid’s lead in the 70th minute. The goal mirrored the baselines of elite football: exploiting space and timing the final pass to perfection. Isco, finding ample room due to Valenciaga's advance, made no mistake in delivering a precise assist.\n\nAs the clock ticked, Athletic’s urgency grew. Valverde injected energy with changes, bringing on players like Miquel Rico and Ibai Gómez to bolster their offensive arsenal. They peppered Madrid’s area, with crosses raining in from both flanks. Navas once again displayed his goalkeeping prowess, denying Ibai and others in a spell of sustained pressure. The tension was palpable as Athletic fought to claw back.\n\nThe dying moments of the match were fraught with drama. Athletic pushed all their players up, leaving gaps at the back that Madrid exploited with counter-attacks. Cristiano Ronaldo had an opportunity to seal the game late on but shot wide. Amid the torrid downpour, the intensity didn’t wane. Rain slickened the field, adding to the challenge for both teams who had to adapt their footing and control.\n\nDespite Athletic's best efforts, Real Madrid held firm, showcasing their tactical resilience and defensive solidity. The final whistle echoed around San Mamés with Real Madrid emerging victorious thanks to Benzema’s double strike. It was a hard-fought battle, reflecting the competitive nature of Spanish football where any moment's lapse can flip the game’s narrative.\n\nThus, Real Madrid’s strategic nous, coupled with moments of individual brilliance, saw them through this stirring challenge. As the team celebrated securing valuable three points, Athletic Bilbao could hold their heads high, having played with heart and tested the mettle of one of Europe’s elite clubs."
