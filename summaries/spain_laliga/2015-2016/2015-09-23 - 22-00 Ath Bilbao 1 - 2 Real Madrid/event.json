    "summary": "The match between Ath Bilbao and Real was a dynamic and fiercely contested game where Real emerged victorious with a 2-1 scoreline. The first half started with Real kicking off the game at the sound of the referee’s whistle. \n\nThe opening moments saw Real committing a foul just over a minute into the game. This allowed Ath Bilbao to take an indirect free-kick, although it did not result in a goal-scoring opportunity. Ath Bilbao’s corner at the 2:31 mark was foiled by a foul on their part, giving Real an indirect free-kick to relieve the pressure.\n\nReal had faced another tackle just past the third minute when Ath Bilbao committed a foul, giving Real another free-kick. This period was a mix of defensive plays, with multiple instances of the ball going out of play coupled with throw-ins and clearances by both teams.

Although it did not ripple the net, it signaled Real’s intent. This effort was followed by a series of attempts, including a corner at 6:57 and a shot off-target just a moment later.

It wasn’t until the 21:55 mark of the second half when Ath Bilbao succeeded, reaping the reward of consistent efforts with a spectacular goal that positioned the score to 1-1.\n\nHowever, Real's grit was afresh as the match continued. They showcased impeccable resilience and within the next frame, a swift counter led to Real scoring again. This move resumed Real’s lead at 2-1 in the 24:37 minute of the second half. Ath Bilbao resumed the play but continuously faced tough defense and tactical obstructions posed by Real.\n\nWith both teams employing substitutions to bring fresh legs onto the field, the intensity didn’t wane. Real staved off several shots from Ath Bilbao, including a precision effort at 29:24, which necessitated a decisive save. A string of corner kicks and throw-ins also demonstrated Ath Bilbao's relentless pursuit. However, Real’s defense stayed strong, clearing ball after ball, and preventing Ath Bilbao from finding the back of net again.\n\nSeveral attacking attempts characterized the closing minutes, sprinkled with fouls leading to both direct and indirect free kicks. Both teams saw a stream of yellow cards, with multiple free-kicks being awarded. The match seemed to inch towards a climax when the formidably structured defense from Real denied any more equalizing goals from Ath Bilbao.\n\nAs the final moments approached, Real continued to counter whenever Ath Bilbao tried to build an offensive play.
