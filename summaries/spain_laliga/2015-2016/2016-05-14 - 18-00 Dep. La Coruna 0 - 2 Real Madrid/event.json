    "summary": "The game between Deportivo La Coruña and Real proved to be an enthralling contest played out on a vibrant, sunny pitch. As the hosts, Deportivo La Coruña initiated the kick-off to start the match, quickly delving into the match with an air of determination and anticipation.\n\nOnly a couple of minutes into the match, the game experienced its first halt as the ball was kicked out of play at 02:30. Shortly after, Deportivo La Coruña restarted the momentum with a throw-in at 02:46, setting the stage for the rhythmic ebb and flow that would come to define the remainder of the match.\n\nAction resumed yet again when, at 04:51, the ball found itself out of bounds. Real saw an opportunity to take an offensive stance with a corner kick at 05:13. Their agile play and organized set-pieces paid off handsomely at 06:57 when the first goal of the match was scored by Real, sending waves of cheers through their supporters. This early lead served as a confidence booster and a stark indication of Real's strategy to dominate the game's tempo.\n\nUndaunted by the goal, Deportivo La Coruña restarted the game with a kick-off at 07:39. A few moments later, Depor's drive to level the score faced a setback with a foul committed at 08:15. The referee's whistle disrupted their momentum. Real, too, did not escape scrutiny as a foul was called against them at 09:33 and yet another at 11:48. These stoppages peppered the match, making it a physical contest.\n\nWhen the ball went out at 12:59, it created yet another pause. Real continued to press, earning another corner at 13:24. However, this effort didn't bear fruit initially, as a clearance by Deportivo La Coruña at 13:27 temporarily subdued Real's attack. Nonetheless, their relentless pursuit saw the offside trap spring against them at 14:21, reflecting La Coruña’s disciplined defending.\n\nMore back-and-forth play ensued, punctuated by the ball going out of play at 15:15. Deportivo La Coruña resumed with a throw-in at 15:22 but soon found the ball out again at 15:29, leading to another throw-in, this time by Real at 15:36. The clattering exchanges continued creating a back-and-forth pattern.\n\nThe match was repeatedly halted by the ball going out of play at various instances – again at 16:32 and 17:34. Deportivo La Coruña momentarily regained possession with a throw-in at 17:37, only for the ball to go out shortly after at 17:52. This set up another La Coruña throw-in at 18:08 but the first half increasingly showed signs of aggressive play and calculated interruptions.\n\nAt 21:10, the ball went out of play again, handing Depor another throw-in at 21:17. Their determination to level the score remained high, but breaking down Real's defense seemed an arduous task. More disruptions followed when a ball-out occurred at 23:54 and Real earned themselves another corner at 24:22. This persistent offensive approach bore fruit when Real registered their second goal at 24:51, expertly converting from the corner, further establishing their grip on the match.\n\nThe second goal forced Deportivo La Coruña to reassess their strategy. They initiated another kick-off at 25:59, desperately seeking avenues to pull one back. La Coruña's attempt to reply was clear when they registered a shot off target at 27:00, only to watch Real execute a clinical clearance at 27:31. Their attack was nullified once again when Real caught them offside at 28:48. Real, emboldened by their two-goal cushion, continued their attacking spells with shots on target at 29:23, followed by another orchestrated corner at 30:01.\n\nThe match's storyline continued to weave chaotic play, illustrated by another out-of-play ball at 30:09 and resumed with Depor's throw-in at 30:15. The recurring theme of ball possession changes materialized with a ball out and throw-in scenario at 30:59 and 31:10 respectively.\n\nAs the game progressed, an offside call against Deportivo La Coruña at 31:13 prominently juxtaposed Real’s fluidity against La Coruña’s scrambling endeavors. Real earned yet another corner at 33:10 but were unable to capitalise, evidenced by their shot off target at 33:27.\n\nThe first half exemplified tactical combat, blended with interruptions from fouls and offsides. At 34:09, Deportivo La Coruña committed a foul, adding to the frenetic nature climaxing with Depor's shots off-target at 35:18 and subsequent Real clearance at 35:39.\n\nThe latter part of the first half maintained its combative tone, punctuated by a ball-out at 36:45 and Real clearance at 37:02. Real’s vigor remained as they committed a foul at 40:37, leading into a quick reinitiation with their throw-in at 41:02. They continued operating under the referee's lens for fouls, adversely impacting the physical balance on the field.\n\nAs halftime drew nearer, Deportivo La Coruña’s aggressive stance culminated in a foul at 43:34. The first half concluded shortly, laying the groundwork for the second half with Real’s lead firmly intact.\n\nEntering the second half with Real's kick-off, there was an early tactical adjustment made by Real with a substitution at 00:30. The flow of the game quickly resumed familiar patterns of territorial control and robust challenges. At 01:40, the ball was again out of play, inviting Depor into an attacking phase with a corner at 02:09. Real responded fiercely with shots on target at 04:26. \n\nReal on that occasion, however, faced a disciplinary setback when a foul at 04:40 earned them a yellow card at 04:46. The tension on the pitch was palpable, exuding the desire on both sides to alter the game's outcome.\n\nThe subsequent phases were characterized by more set-pieces and exchanges. Depor managed a shot on target at 08:06, aiming to chip into the two-goal deficit. However, the resilience of Real’s defense saw them clear subsequent threats, and Real's tactical acumen was showcased with well-timed clearances like those at 09:01 and multiple throw-ins resuming play, as seen at 09:51 and 10:35.\n\nThe sequence of throw-ins, fouls, and yellow cards illustrated the fiery contest on display. At 11:13, Deportivo La Coruña committed a foul and were duly cautioned with a yellow card at 11:19. Both teams maintained aggressive statures, evidenced by further out-of-play moments and throw-ins elapsed, putting enormous pressure on both sides to maintain composure under physical confrontation.\n\nAs the game neared the final quarter, Deportivo La Coruña tried to alter the proceedings with a substitution at 25:09. The remaining time saw further substitutions by Real at 30:36 and 30:54, indicating tactical maneuvers to maintain their lead and ferried to ensure baseline defensive solidity. The game was interspersed with frequent, sequences of corner kicks and shots off targets like those at 33:27, which added to the game's dynamic but ultimately fruitless push for goals.\n\nReal's defensive surge culminated in shots off target at 37:37, but La Coruña's relentless pursuit and tactical fouls added a competitive flair. The game ended on a high-energy note but saw no further goals, with Real maintaining their 2-0 lead until the final whistle.\n\nIn summation, the contest reflected a dynamic interplay of strategy, offensive endeavors, and staunch defensive play coupled with robust physical clashes, painting a comprehensive and high-voltage match narrative. Real's early goals paved the way to their victory, successfully defending their dominance through tactical prowess and situational defensive reactions against a determined Deportivo La Coruña side."
