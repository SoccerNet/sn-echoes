midfielders.\n20:13 Comment: Maybe they have a more similar profile between them.\n20:16 Comment: It is true that Mosquera can give creativity to the team.\n20:19 Comment: But this year he has been more of an anchor.\n20:21 Comment: Bergantinos is a more physical working player.\n20:24 Comment: More of destruction.\n20:25 Comment: Obviously not without quality.\n20:27 Comment: But Celso Borges is perhaps the most reaching of the three.\n20:30 Comment: Yes, that's why.\n20:31 Comment: He is a player who has brought out two players for more containment.\n20:34 Comment: More about situation.\n20:35 Comment: More than staying in that position.\n20:39 Comment: Precisely so that they don't get caught in the counterattack.\n20:41 Comment: Or so that Real Madrid does not have space when they steal the ball.\n20:44 Comment: Benzema.\n20:46 Comment: Manuel Pablo advanced the ball.\n20:48 Comment: He can't handle it.\n20:49 Comment: Help goes up.\n20:50 Comment: There, Cristiano, I think Benzema closed him down.\n20:52 Comment: Cristiano opened to the right.\n20:53 Comment: And with that he dragged defenders.\n20:54 Comment: It didn't make things easier for Karim Benzema.\n20:56 Comment: Excellent anticipation from Marcelo.\n20:58 Comment: Preventing Cartavia from taking the ball.\n20:59 Comment: Which he then put to the right.\n21:0 Comment: And then he put Fede on it.\n21:1 Comment: And he ended up stealing the ball.\n21:3 Comment: Fede Cartavia.\n21:4 Comment: He has Luis Alberto on the left side.\n21:5 Comment: Lucas Perez.\n21:6 Comment: Your partner throughout the entire season waiting.\n21:8 Comment: Lucas Pérez has the ball.\n21:10 Comment: The Galician who this year has had his great season.\n21:14 Comment: Throw-in for Deportivo de La Coruña.\n21:17

Vázquez is the only absence due to injury in the Real Madrid ranks.\n21:29 Comment: Come on!\n21:30 Comment: A loss that the whites trust.\n21:32 Comment: Being able to correct it between now and the final of the Champions League.\n21:35 Comment: Next May 28th.\n21:37 Comment: Antel Atlético de Madrid.\n21:39 Comment: Faisal Fahir.\n21:41 Comment: Fahir and Mosquera.\n21:43 Comment: What a mistake by Mosquera.\n21:44 Comment: He gives the ball to Benzema.\n21:45 Comment: This one plays with Cristiano.\n21:47 Comment: 21 minutes of the game.\n21:49 Comment: Deportivo remains 0-1.\n21:50 Comment: It looks like he wants to get out of his nap.\n21:53 Comment: But he's having a hell of a time getting into the game.\n21:56 Comment: Kroos.\n21:57 Comment: Yes, Real Madrid has started very strong, to be honest.\n21:59 Comment: And they also kind of knew that they were going to start like this, strong, right?\n22:3 Comment: And now it's starting to blur a little in the field.\n22:7 Comment: To lose some positions to attack, right?\n22:10 Comment: And that's probably what they don't want.\n22:12 Comment: So, because from there, if that happens, Real Madrid will find more spaces.\n22:17 Comment: And logically it will be more dangerous.\n22:19 Comment: Which is what Deportivo will not want at the moment.\n22:21 Comment: That Real Madrid has those meters to be able to run.\n22:24 Comment: And that field to be able to go to the end and finish.\n22:27 Comment: Benzema, ancestor.\n22:28 Comment: Benzema against Manuel Pablo.\n22:30 Comment: There Benzema has opened his arm.\n22:32 Comment: He hits Manuel Pablo in the presence of Mateu Lahoz.\n22:34 Comment: That he understands it as a legal throw of the game.\n22:37 Comment: And now he is also not in love with listening to the protests of the Deportivo side.\n22:41 Comment: Dani Carvajal.\n22:42 Comment: Carvajal hangs the ball.\n22:44 Comment: Very passed ball.\n22:45 Comment: Gareth Bale who did not jump.\n22:47 Comment: Alejandro Arribas was there getting in the way.\n22:49 Comment: Fede Cartavia.\n22:50 Comment: Manuel Pablo.\n22:52 Comment: The Canarian side, as we said.\n22:54 Comment: It seems that he is going to close his cycle as a footballer.\n22:57 Comment: Active.\n22:58 Comment: Juan Carlos Valerón also did it recently.\n23:0 Comment: It is clear that there is a generation of Canarian talent that, after very good performance, is little by little finishing that football journey.\n23:9 Comment: Play Fahir.\n23:11 Comment: Bergantinho's ball.\n23:13 Comment: Hermosquera.\n23:14 Comment: Faisal Fahir.\n23:15 Comment: Sidney.\n23:17 Comment: Sidney towards Lucas Pérez who is enabled.\n23:20 Comment: Lucas Pérez who narrowly missed it.\n23:22 Comment: Keylor Navas.\n23:23 Comment: Well, I don't know if it was Keylor Navas and Pep Guardiola.\n23:25 Comment: But it was.\n23:26 Comment: That Keylor Navas and Pepe had it very well measured.\n23:28 Comment: But Lucas Pérez's start seemed correct.\n23:31 Comment: And he was inches away from reaching that ball.\n23:34 Comment: Yes, the start has been good.\n23:36 Comment: What happens is that Pepe thought that Lucas wasn't coming for the ball.\n23:40 Comment: Kroos.\n23:41 Comment: Modric.\n23:42 Comment: Gareth Bale.\n23:43 Comment: Christian.\n23:44 Comment: Bale and Luka Modric.\n23:46 Comment: The players of both teams can now be seen from the height of Riazor, standing very still.\n23:51 Comment: Kroos center.\n23:52 Comment: Christian who manages to head.\n23:54 Comment: Sidney who didn't come out.\n23:55 Comment: It is not clear what she tells him to talk to.\n23:59 Comment: But Sidney saw the ball and kicked it for a corner.\n24:1 Comment: Corner kick.\n24:3 Comment: The first season of the revelation series of the year arrives.\n24:7 Comment: Mister Robot where a vigilante hacker will try to challenge what is established.\n24:10 Comment: Don't miss it from May 14 on Canal Plus Series.\n24:12 Comment: Day 11.\n24:13 Comment: And completely in Jumbi.\n24:15 Comment: We saw those two very happy fans there.\n24:17 Comment: Especially that of Barça.\n24:18 Comment: Because Luis Suárez just scored.\n24:20 Comment: Well, in the replica of FC Barcelona.\n24:23 Comment: Christian who goes to the auction.\n24:25 Comment: Fly trap that prevents danger.\n24:27 Comment: Follow the action Luka Modric.\n24:29 Comment: Runs.\n24:30 Comment: Corner kick again.\n24:31 Comment: Luis Suárez who will have seen that Ronaldo scored the goal.\n24:33 Comment: And he said I can't trust this one.\n24:35 Comment: I'm going to get in too.\n24:38 Comment: Action and reaction.\n24:39 Comment: It was Real Madrid who started scoring earlier in the 7th minute against FC Barcelona.\n24:44 Comment: That he has already done it and at this moment things would be as before the game.\n24:49 Comment: That is, with FC Barcelona.\n24:50 Comment: Leader.\n24:51 Comment: Christian headbutt.\n24:53 Comment: Mateo Lauz scores a goal.\n24:55 Comment: Real Madrid scores.\n24:57 Comment: Deportivo players protest.\n24:59 Comment: There is a fallen footballer inside the area.\n25:1 Comment: They are complaining there about a possible push.\n25:4 Comment: I think it's Alejandro Arribas.\n25:6 Comment: The man who still hasn't recovered.\n25:8 Comment: And the referee Mateo Lauz.\n25:11 Comment: Roberto surrounded by the Deportivo players.\n25:13 Comment: Demanding that he annul that goal.\n25:15 Comment: But the scoreboard that is about to reflect that second goal is now valid.\n25:19 Comment: Marked by Cristiano Ronaldo.\n25:21 Comment: Which has reacted practically immediately.\n25:24 Comment: And the goal that Luis Suárez scored.\n25:26 Comment: In that individual fight that remains between the two.\n25:29 Comment: But at the moment it is not useful for the League.\n25:32 Comment: It seems like it's later.\n25:34 Comment: What happens is that there is a player with Casimiro.\n25:36 Comment: I think he's the one who falls.\n25:37 Comment: Oh.\n25:38 Comment: Go.\n25:39 Comment: Hunt a wall.\n25:40 Comment: And he puts his body there trying to block.\n25:42 Comment: And Alejandro Arribas hits.\n25:44 Comment: Yeah.\n25:45 Comment: Because I think there is nothing about Ronaldo in the play.\n25:48 Comment: The Deportivo players were there.\n25:50 Comment: Mateo who seemed to indicate that the one who whistles is me.\n25:53 Comment: That we already knew that.\n25:54 Comment: Let Mateo whistle.\n25:55 Comment: He has seen no fault in the blocks.\n25:57 Comment: Then in Cristiano's action.\n25:59 Comment: The shot hits the Deportivo de La Coruña player.\n26:2 Comment: Yeah.\n26:3 Comment: There is a small struggle.\n26:4 Comment: But not enough to be a foul.\n26:6 Comment: I think that Deportivo's players may complain about when Bale starts.\n26:10 Comment: And that prohibits the Deportivo player from following him.\n26:14 Comment: Because the other player stays for today.\n26:16 Comment: It crashes.\n26:17 Comment: Faisal Fahir.\n26:19 Comment: The goal was highly discussed by Deportivo's players.\n26:21 Comment: But it's not a problem.\n26:22 Comment: It is a goal that has gone up on the scoreboard.\n26:24 Comment: Second for Real Madrid.\n26:25 Comment: Second thing that Cristiano Ronaldo signs up in his account.\n26:28 Comment: Although at the moment in the Riazor video scoreboard I also said that it was going to go up immediately.\n26:33 Comment: At the moment it is still 0-1.\n26:35 Comment: No, because they scored the goal.\n26:37 Comment: That is what Riazor's score reflects.\n26:39 Comment: For a moment I thought you were going to call me Roberto.\n26:41 Comment: Here he then gives the authorship of the goal.\n26:43 Comment: Mateo Laoz.\n26:44 Comment: I understand that Cristiano's header was going towards the goal.\n26:46 Comment: Even though an Empor footballer plays.\n26:48 Comment: That goal will bear the signature.\n26:50 Comment: It will be signed by Cristiano Ronaldo on the final score sheet.\n26:53 Comment: Yes, man.\n26:54 Comment: I think there is no reason for anything else.\n26:56 Comment: Fede Cartavia.\n26:57 Comment: Shot from very far from Cartavia.\n26:59 Comment: Well, this at minute 27 is news for Deportivo de La Coruña.\n27:4 Comment: That at the moment he had been tremendously shy in front of goal.\n27:8 Comment: There we see.\n27:9 Comment: Gareth Bale.\n27:10 Comment: Pushes Rivas.\n27:11 Comment: But he pushes by putting his shoulder in his face.\n27:13 Comment: An action that I believe was done at the last minute.\n27:15 Comment: But it is not an action that has been done at the last minute.\n27:17 Comment: But it is an action that has been done at the last minute.\n27:18 Comment: And it is an action that has been done at the last minute.\n27:19 Comment: And it is an action that I sincerely believe that if I saw it in detail, Mateu Laozu would have indicated the fault.\n27:24 Comment: There we see another perspective.\n27:26 Comment: To Rivas, who also doesn't expect it.\n27:28 Comment: That impact.\n27:33 Comment: Dani Carvajal ends up falling to the ground.\n27:36 Comment: Yes, because of Cristiano, he looked and saw that there was nothing.\n27:40 Comment: And that's why he scored a goal.\n27:41 Comment: And I imagine that the Deportivo players were protesting Bale's action.\n27:45 Comment: Casemiro.\n27:47 Comment: Let's see who arrives.\n27:48 Comment: Luis does it.\n27:49 Comment: Luis Alberto.\n27:50 Comment: Luis Alberto, after touching just enough, then had a chance to get to the ball and avoid the throw-in.\n27:56 Comment: Faisal Fahir.\n27:57 Comment: Mosquera.\n27:58 Comment: Luis Alberto loses.\n27:59 Comment: Bad control.\n28:0 Comment: And above all, the Real Madrid defender, Carvajal.\n28:3 Comment: He beats the ball to Bergantinos.\n28:5 Comment: Rotates 360 degrees.\n28:6 Comment: Kroos who gets a compliment from Bergantinos.\n28:8 Comment: And there is an exchange of glances between the two.\n28:11 Comment: Benzema.\n28:12 Comment: Cristiano, who was going offside, stops.\n28:14 Comment: Benzema plays with Bale.\n28:16 Comment: Janet Bale.\n28:19 Comment: Dani Carvajal.\n28:21 Comment: While the ball was here, Mateo Laud was still talking to Toni Kroos about the previous action with Bergantinos.\n28:26 Comment: It is possible, yes.\n28:27 Comment: Marcellus.\n28:29 Comment: Sergio Ramos.\n28:31 Comment: Real Madrid now has what it wanted to have, it has in its hands.\n28:36 Comment: It is the face marker and also has a loose shape.\n28:40 Comment: Yes, logically.\n28:41 Comment: It's been 28 minutes of play.\n28:43 Comment: A 0-2.\n28:44 Comment: It is already a quite strong result.\n28:46 Comment: You never know, but...\n28:47 Comment: Hey...\n28:48 Comment: Christian who spikes the ball.\n28:50 Comment: Christian who sends the ball to the post.\n28:52 Comment: Everyone waiting for the assistant's flag.\n28:55 Comment: But the assistant was clear that there was no offside.\n28:58 Comment: Mateu who raised his thumbs up.\n29:1 Comment: Accepting his assistant's decision as good.\n29:3 Comment: Obviously, he has to take it for granted.\n29:5 Comment: And what's more, it was.\n29:6 Comment: Fernando Navarro is enabling Cristiano Ronaldo.\n29:9 Comment: Yes, on this occasion there was no offside.\n29:11 Comment: Furthermore, Cristiano has stopped a fantastic ball that fell from the air.\n29:15 Comment: And then he finished.\n29:16 Comment: He also finished.\n29:17 Comment: It wasn't a goal.\n29:18 Comment: Because if he finishes worse, he still goes in.\n29:20 Comment: But he finished perfectly.\n29:21 Comment: And it hit the mark.\n29:22 Comment: Benzema.\n29:23 Comment: Cristiano finishes.\n29:24 Comment: Benzema.\n29:25 Comment: Pleticosa.\n29:26 Comment: With the tips of your fingers.\n29:27 Comment: Sending the ball to the corner.\n29:29 Comment: Yeah.\n29:30 Comment: And now there have been two actions in a row.\n29:32 Comment: In the 28th.\n29:33 Comment: In the 29th.\n29:34 Comment: Because now it has also been a good deed.\n29:36 Comment: The goalkeeper has been very good.\n29:37 Comment: It could also have been a goal.\n29:39 Comment: The Real Madrid that continues to accumulate approaches, opportunities.\n29:45 Comment: And Deportivo de la Coluña.\n29:46 Comment: I suppose that in part you will also keep in mind what happened the day of FC Barcelona's visit.\n29:51 Comment: Which ended with a scandalous victory.\n29:54 Comment: And this average that the game leads.\n29:56 Comment: And the traces it bears in the encounter.\n29:58 Comment: Well, they could lead you to a very similar situation.\n30:1 Comment: Kroos.\n30:2 Comment: Clear Rivas.\n30:3 Comment: That falls back into the area.\n30:5 Comment: This time there didn't seem to be anything.\n30:6 Comment: Fede Cartavia minimally stops Marcelo.\n30:8 Comment: Cartavia continues.\n30:9 Comment: It hit Pepe.\n30:10 Comment: Throw-in\n30:12 Comment: Yeah.\n30:13 Comment: Furthermore, I don't know if Deportivo is turning things around.\n30:16 Comment: It's hard to get out.\n30:17 Comment: But when he leaves he is finding a Real Madrid that is putting pressure.\n30:20 Comment: Who is going to look for the ball.\n30:21 Comment: And of course he is only aware of what this game is about.\n30:25 Comment: Fede Cartavia.\n30:29 Comment: Mosquera.\n30:31 Comment: Mosquera and Bergantinos.\n30:35 Comment: Álex Bergantinos has played with Fede Cartavia.\n30:39 Comment: He crosses the field from right to left without much clarity.\n30:44 Comment: When he risks the ball.\n30:45 Comment: He loses her.\n30:46 Comment: Carvajal cut.\n30:47 Comment: He gets there to give the ball back to Deportivo.\n30:50 Comment: Faisal Fahir.\n30:51 Comment: Fernando Navarro.\n30:52 Comment: Mosquera.\n30:53 Comment: Fahir.\n30:55 Comment: Pick up the ball.\n30:56 Comment: Fernando Navarro guides her with his chest.\n30:58 Comment: Casemiro and Fernando Navarro stay there.\n31:1 Comment: Hugging.\n31:3 Comment: They separate in bad ways.\n31:6 Comment: And Navarro is going to take out.\n31:8 Comment: Luis Alberto.\n31:12 Comment: The ball came out.\n31:13 Comment: The assistant marks it.\n31:14 Comment: Zidane.\n31:16 Comment: Just in case, Roberto was almost an emergency assistant.\n31:20 Comment: I was on site.\n31:21 Comment: Yeah.\n31:22 Comment: And Victor who is with him.\n31:24 Comment: He tells her that he hasn't gone out.\n31:26 Comment: I think that the lineman is certainly showing some signs of insecurity.\n31:32 Comment: But he is so clear that he has to whistle if he has left.\n31:36 Comment: And it's there next to the play.\n31:38 Comment: Very clear.\n31:39 Comment: Luis Alberto was protesting a lot.\n31:41 Comment: It was curious how Mateu kept his gaze for 15 minutes.\n31:42 Comment: Without saying anything.\n31:44 Comment: Until Luis Alberto has calmed down.\n31:46 Comment: He's tired.\n31:47 Comment: And he has stopped protesting.\n31:48 Comment: It was duel in the sun.\n31:50 Comment: A clash of challenging looks between the Deportivo player and the Valencian referee.\n31:55 Comment: Antonio Mateo.\n31:56 Comment: Navarrese.\n31:57 Comment: Pedro Mosquera.\n31:58 Comment: Fernando Navarro.\n32:0 Comment: Deportivo loses the ball.\n32:2 Comment: Casemiro.\n32:3 Comment: Modric.\n32:4 Comment: And the Deportivo player.\n32:6 Comment: The Deportivo player.\n32:7 Comment: Antonio.\n32:8 Comment: The Deportivo player.\n32:9 Comment: Casemiro.\n32:10 Comment: Modric.\n32:12 Comment: Antonio.\n32:13 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo.\n32:14 Comment: Cristiano and Luka Modric.\n32:15 Comment: Casemiro.\n32:16 Comment: Modric.\n32:17 Comment: There the game falls asleep.\n32:18 Comment: It slows down.\n32:19 Comment: But Real Madrid is capable of having very long ball positions and progressing with\n32:20 Comment: the ball almost without problems.\n32:21 Comment: Yeah.\n32:22 Comment: There has been time for all of Deportivo to retreat.\n32:23 Comment: But is normal.\n32:24 Comment: In other words, they are still very against the result.\n32:25 Comment: But they continue with discipline.\n32:26 Comment: And Real Madrid, who have played with Deportivo, have played with Deportivo.\n32:28 Comment: And Real Madrid, who has played with Deportivo.\n32:29 Comment: What happens is that, well, it's going to be more and more difficult for him to withdraw more and more.\n32:36 Comment: So now we have seen the last play that Deportivo has made, which has been able\n32:51 Comment: to catch and give eight or ten consecutive touches to the ball.\n32:54 Comment: And I think that's the best way.\n32:56 Comment: Because Real Madrid, with the result in their favor, is not going to tighten up either.\n32:59 Comment: He is not going to put so much pressure on him, but Deportivo, when he has the ball, would have to try,\n33:3 Comment: Well, that's it, playing a little more, having a little more.\n33:5 Comment: Which maybe is the best way to defend.\n33:7 Comment: Because defending behind he has seen that it could not be.\n33:9 Comment: He is already 33 with two goals.\n33:11 Comment: Another fall in the area.\n33:12 Comment: Desarribas again while Toni Kroos had taken the corner.\n33:16 Comment: The ball falls to Lucas Pérez.\n33:18 Comment: Lucas Pérez, who we have not heard from in the match, did not intervene.\n33:21 Comment: Luka Modric stole.\n33:22 Comment: Lucas Pérez falls with a clear gesture of pain.\n33:26 Comment: The footballer complains while Cristiano...\n33:28 Comment: Crash the ball!\n33:29 Comment: On the crossbar!\n33:30 Comment: The whip with the left leg.\n33:34 Comment: The ball that hits the crossbar.\n33:36 Comment: Luka Modric, Roberto, who is going to be interested in Lucas Pérez.\n33:40 Comment: Accompanying Pepe and Carvajal in their concern for the state of the Deportivo striker,\n33:44 Comment: who is already standing up, although with a rather striking limp.\n33:48 Comment: What I don't know is that if...\n33:50 Comment: It seems like it's the first time Mateo Laoz has whistled for them.\n33:53 Comment: Mateo Laoz has his own peculiar way of blowing the whistle and lets the game continue a lot.\n33:57 Comment: He doesn't call the fouls that you, as a player, call on him.\n33:59 Comment: As a coach, you think that he is going to whistle and both for and against, eh?\n34:4 Comment: And then what you can't do is stop.\n34:5 Comment: What you have to do is keep going and going until the referee whistles or doesn't whistle.\n34:11 Comment: There is a lack of Fernando Navarro's jump.\n34:15 Comment: The gravel is beginning to have the sensitivity of a little on the surface with Mateo Laoz.\n34:21 Comment: Also Víctor Sánchez del Amo.\n34:25 Comment: It seems to me that right now Deportivo de La Coruña has other problems.\n34:28 Comment: And I speak football.\n34:29 Comment: Obviously he needs to improve in more things to approach the game in a different way.\n34:35 Comment: Mudric.\n34:37 Comment: Sergio Ramos.\n34:38 Comment: Kroos.\n34:39 Comment: Ramos.\n34:41 Comment: Real Madrid wins against Deportivo.\n34:42 Comment: FC Barcelona wins against Granada.\n34:44 Comment: The League right now would fall to the side of Luis Enrique's team.\n34:49 Comment: Gareth Bale apologizes for not opening his right towards Dani Carvajal.\n34:52 Comment: Ramos gives the ball to Real Madrid again.\n34:55 Comment: Marcellus.\n34:56 Comment: Marcelo towards Cristiano.\n34:57 Comment: Return Marcelo.\n34:58 Comment: The Brazilian has not waited.\n34:59 Comment: Fajir.\n35:0 Comment: Mosquera.\n35:1 Comment: Fajir.\n35:2 Comment: The good thing about Madrid for him is that he is losing the ball when he loses the ball.\n35:6 Comment: Because he is trying to link plays.\n35:8 Comment: He loses it very close to the Depor area.\n35:9 Comment: And then it costs Depor a lot.\n35:11 Comment: Now he is coming out well on the right wing.\n35:14 Comment: And with danger.\n35:15 Comment: Good ball from Mosquera for Cartavia to try.\n35:17 Comment: Ramos who wants to stop there in Cartavia.\n35:19 Comment: That with all the intention he sent the ball.\n35:22 Comment: Looking for the right post of Keylor Navas' frame.\n35:25 Comment: There were almost two already dangerous shots by Fede Cartavia.\n35:29 Comment: By far and almost by acclamation Depor's most dangerous player.\n35:34 Comment: It's what we wear to the game.\n35:35 Comment: Well yes.\n35:35 Comment: This is an option that has caught on well.\n35:37 Comment: What has also hit is how the field has that film of water on top.\n35:42 Comment: Of eagle.\n35:43 Comment: Well, when you catch the ball.\n35:45 Comment: It picks up a lot of speed upon impact with the ground.\n35:51 Comment: Dani Carabajal.\n35:53 Comment: Modric.\n35:54 Comment: Intercept Fajir.\n35:57 Comment: Faisal Fajir.\n35:58 Comment: It's hard there.\n35:59 Comment: Decide what to do with the ball.\n36:1 Comment: He ends up relying on Fernando Navarro.\n36:5 Comment: Fernando Navarro could play easily with Mosquera.\n36:8 Comment: Try something else which is to go on the attack.\n36:10 Comment: Go upstairs.\n36:11 Comment: That costs him in the end to lose the ball.\n36:13 Comment: Kroos.\n36:15 Comment: Sidney broke through the center Cristiano Ronaldo.\n36:17 Comment: But the Depor defender did not make a mistake there.\n36:20 Comment: Fajir.\n36:22 Comment: Fajir with Alex Bergantinos.\n36:26 Comment: Manuel Pablo.\n36:27 Comment: Who continues to show his affection to the fans of Deportivo de La Coruña.\n36:32 Comment: Today is a special day for him.\n36:34 Comment: And the Depor fans, well.\n36:36 Comment: We have to take a break, right?\n36:37 Comment: Within what this game is and what the end of the season is.\n36:41 Comment: Generous there with the right-handed side.\n36:44 Comment: Cartavia continues trying to lift his team's spirits.\n36:50 Comment: If he is the one who tries the most when he catches the ball.\n36:53 Comment: He is always looking for Madrid's goal.\n36:55 Comment: Find a center.\n36:56 Comment: Look for alternatives that others are having a hard time with.\n36:59 Comment: We saw Víctor Sánchez de Lamo.\n37:2 Comment: Víctor Sánchez de Lamo que.\n37:4 Comment: If I'm not mistaken, the information in the middle of the season.\n37:8 Comment: They were that he extended his contract with Deportivo de La Coruña.\n37:12 Comment: And today the truth is that reading some media.\n37:14 Comment: Some questioned it.\n37:16 Comment: What a strange season the Depor coach has experienced.\n37:19 Comment: And now the Depor that we have seen the first time.\n37:23 Comment: That he has tried to put

well.\n38:1 Comment: Cristiano is already waiting on the left side.\n38:5 Comment: Very good Bale.\n38:6 Comment: Very good Benzema.\n38:7 Comment: What oriented control has done.\n38:10 Comment: So good with the heel.\n38:13 Comment: And Bale, I see him very active.\n38:14 Comment: Very participatory.\n38:16 Comment: Gareth Bale again.\n38:17 Comment: Let's see where he wants to go between two defenders.\n38:20 Comment: Pedro Mosquera is very quick to help.\n38:23 Comment: Dani Carvajal.\n38:24 Comment: Luka modric.\n38:25 Comment: Kroos.\n38:29 Comment: Casemiro.\n38:31 Comment: Casemiro

having the ball, by controlling the ball.\n38:51 Comment: For its part, FC Barcelona continues doing its homework.\n38:55 Comment: There are two carbon copies of the Real Madrid match and the Barça match.\n38:59 Comment: Barça wins 0-2 and here in Riazores Cristiano Ronaldo scores the goals.\n39:5 Comment: Well guess who puts them on.\n39:6 Comment: Luis Alvarez.\n39:7 Comment: The Carmens.\n39:9 Comment: There we see the qualifying situation at this moment with that one-point advantage for Real Madrid.\n39:13 Comment: That is to say, we would be as the season began and this is also being confirmed.\n39:18 Comment: How the day began, sorry, Florentino Pérez also confirmed it.\n39:22 Comment: And Florentino who was looking to see, as you say,\n39:25 Comment: to confirm if it

happens is that if the inertia of the two games is this, we are no longer going to talk about the fight for the league title,\n39:45 Comment: that would clearly be on the side of FC Barcelona.\n39:48 Comment: We would end up talking almost about the individual fight between Cristiano and Luis Suárez.\n39:52 Comment: It seems like it's a duel between the two.\n39:55 Comment: Of course, it's not easy to score goals,\n39:58 Comment: even if it is in this kind of games where they were supposed to win.\n40:2 Comment: But the truth is that both are meeting expectations.\n40:7 Comment: I already said at the beginning that Ronaldo had scored 4 or 5 goals on 7 occasions,\n40:13 Comment: It seems to me, and he knew that if he wanted to get closer to Luis Suárez he had to try to beat that record today.\n40:19 Comment: But of course, without counting Ronaldo, Luis Suárez is also willing to score the same goals.\n40:25 Comment: Cristiano towards Marcelo, Marcelo and Benzema.\n40:27 Comment:

several on the roster.\n41:14 Comment: The sports team from La Coruña, also including, of course, its coach, Víctor Sánchez de Lamo.\n41:20 Comment: Dani Carvajal, Pepe, Toni Kroos.\n41:24 Comment:

Comment: Set the rhythms as Real Madrid wants.\n41:41 Comment: You can do it in the game.\n41:43 Comment: He has done it from the start when he has to be aggressive and fast.\n41:47 Comment: He has done it and when it has been his turn, like now, to simply have the ball, apparently with little depth.\n41:54 Comment: Well, he has also been able to do it.\n41:55 Comment: Marcelo Sinney centers.\n41:57 Comment: With his chest for Manuel Pablo, who is going to complicate life for Fede Cartavia.\n42:1 Comment: And as if they also already know how the result goes, eh?\n42:4 Comment: As if he had already arrived there on the grass and as if the players also know that already...\n42:9 Comment: They have it very difficult.\n42:11 Comment: That right now they are, well, practically at least two goals behind Granada, right?\n42:16 Comment: We attest that they know it, eh?\n42:18 Comment: We previously saw headphones, direct information.\n42:22 Comment: Everyone says no.\n42:23 Comment: But everyone knows it is.\n42:25 Comment: You have to be aware of what is happening in each stage.\n42:28 Comment: And at the moment all the forecasts regarding the favoritism of FC Barcelona and Real Madrid in their matches are being fulfilled.\n42:36 Comment: Which tilts the League at this moment in favor of the Barcelona team.\n42:40 Comment: Fede Cartavia, Faisal Fahir, Bergantinos, Fernando Navarro.\n42:45 Comment: Navarro and Álex Bergantinos.\n42:47 Comment: Bergantinos inside for Luis Alberto, who did not control.\n42:50 Comment: Pepe.\n42:51 Comment: Casemiro.\n42:52 Comment: Modric.\n42:53 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo.\n42:56 Comment: Now Real Madrid is all in their field.\n43:1 Comment: Benzema.\n43:2 Comment: Christian.\n43:3 Comment: But it seems like you're not in the same hurry anymore, right?\n43:6 Comment: How the game started, because they had to get ahead on the scoreboard.\n43:10 Comment: They already are, in fact, right?\n43:12 Comment: With 0-2.\n43:13 Comment: And let's go, but they already know that it is very difficult to achieve the goal they wanted.\n43:19 Comment: Dani Carvajal with Gannett Bale.\n43:22 Comment: Modric.\n43:23 Comment: Kroos.\n43:24 Comment: The German again.\n43:26 Comment: Toni Kroos and Karim Benzema.\n43:28 Comment: Luka modric.\n43:29 Comment: Benzema.\n43:30 Comment: Pedro Mosquera drags him.\n43:31 Comment: It hooked him.\n43:33 Comment: Lack.\n43:34 Comment: And from there Cristiano is going to hit him again.\n43:36 Comment: Mateo goes to look for the ball, the Portuguese soccer player.\n43:39 Comment: Mateo who tells him not to forward the ball.\n43:42 Comment: Which I think he has finally done.\n43:44 Comment: But he hasn't reached the ball.\n43:46 Comment: He hasn't reached the ball.\n43:51 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo has finally done it.\n43:54 Comment: Yes, that half a meter surely.\n43:55 Comment: But hey, the spray now puts everyone in their place.\n44:0 Comment: And it seems that Mateo Lalo is saying nothing, but that you are going to shoot.\n44:4 Comment: The barrier is already set by the Deportivo de la Coruña players.\n44:13 Comment: In the last minute of this first half, Cristiano Ronaldo scored two goals\n44:17 Comment: for Real Madrid.\n44:18 Comment: Search again.\n44:21 Comment: He will surpass Stipe Pletikosa.\n44:25 Comment: Pepe also stuck in the barrier.\n44:31 Comment: Mateo said something there to the footballers who make up the team.\n44:35 Comment: Cristiano is ready to hit.\n44:37 Comment: He is about three meters from the ball.\n44:39 Comment: Start the race.\n44:40 Comment: Hit Christian.\n44:41 Comment: The barrier repels Cristiano again.\n44:42 Comment: Touch him again.\n44:43 Comment: Casemiro falls.\n44:44 Comment: Casemiro lifts the ball.\n44:45 Comment: Pletikosa hooked him.\n44:48 Comment: Kick goal.\n44:49 Comment: The two consecutive shots have converted into a goal.\n44:51 Comment: He scored on one occasion for Casemiro and I think he hurt himself a little bit.\n44:56 Comment: because the goalkeeper on his way out has surely collided with him.\n\nSecond Half:\n1:0 Comment: Marcelo, who in the end what he does is take a cross, which Sidney clears with a header\n1:4 Comment: Manuel Pablo, Fede Cartavia, Fede Cartavia solves the pressure from Toni Kroos well there\n1:10 Comment: Play with Bergantino, Cartavia again, Cartavia who I insist is the most successful of the Deportivo de La Coruña players today\n1:17 Comment: Yes, the one who has shown the most signs of danger from Depor has been him, undoubtedly\n1:22 Comment: Let's remember that the only shot, which was a little more dangerous, was made in the first half, right?\n1:29 Comment: And now in this last play that we have seen, we have also seen how Benzema carries the ball\n1:33 Comment: and how you can see that Cristiano Ronaldo was not there, because if he had been, I am totally sure that they would have looked for him\n1:38 Comment: Cartavia center, Dani Carvajal wanted, I think, to hit the ball he was adorning with his chest\n1:44 Comment: but it didn't work out and in the end what he does is concede a corner kick\n1:49 Comment: Yes, you're not wrong, I think he wanted to leave the ball to that guy with his chest.\n1:54 Comment: and the ball made a strange mistake when it fell and well, he didn't even touch it, he just combed it a little with his chest\n2:0 Comment: that's why it went to the corner\n2:2 Comment: Deportivo de La Coruña is going to take a corner\n2:6 Comment: The Depor footballers will play with the intention of playing short, Fangir is waiting there\n2:13 Comment: In the end the one who centered was Lucas Pérez, Lucas Pérez and Luis Alberto\n2:19 Comment: They stayed there near the flag, James, Marcelo, Ramos, what are they going to do?\n2:26 Comment: Whoever leads Real Madrid's counterattack moves the ball forward a lot\n2:30 Comment: and that saves the situation for Depor, Fernando Navarro took the ball\n2:34 Comment: Ramos went there very crazy, very uncontrolled, Fernando Navarro\n2:38 Comment: I think he understood well that Ramos was not going there with any bad intentions.\n2:42 Comment: but there could have been a dangerous crash\n2:45 Comment: The ground has been lost because it has been swept away and the truth is that if Fernando Navarro does not see that possibility\n2:52 Comment: It would have been a pretty dangerous crash as you say.\n2:55 Comment: Bergantinos, Mosquera, Mosquera towards Fede Cartagna\n3:0 Comment: He can count on Manuel Pablo and the right wing, but no, he prefers to play with Mosquera\n3:5 Comment: Pedro Mosquera and Alejandro Arribas\n3:8 Comment: Sidney, it will depend a lot on Deportivo de La Coruña whether this second half is a formality or not\n3:14 Comment: If Depor puts a little more face on the grill, things could be different\n3:17 Comment: For Real Madrid, what they have is enough, they have done what they had to\n3:22 Comment: and now the rest of the events are not in your hands\n3:26 Comment: Yes, that's what it's going to do, logically Depor can stretch and go\n3:30 Comment: and have a little more fun playing football than not, somehow\n3:36 Comment: the tension they had defensively in the first half\n3:39 Comment: The proof he has is that we have now been three and a bit minutes and Depor\n3:42 Comment: It is the one that is being played the most in the Madrid field\n3:45 Comment: However, in the first part when it started it was all the other way around.\n3:48 Comment: It is clear that the result is different, the needs are different\n3:51 Comment: but I think that Depor now has the obligation to stretch a little more\n3:56 Comment: Manuel Pablo and Fajer, no matter how little Manuel Pablo does, quickly\n4:1 Comment: They notice the response from the Riazor stands\n4:5 Comment: Luis Alberto, Casemiro, Toni Kroos, Marcelo, Ramos gets his leg in\n4:10 Comment: Kroos, Casemiro, Luka Modric\n4:14 Comment: There, Real Madrid is already deactivating the pressure from Deportivo\n4:17 Comment: and James can progress comfortably, the Colombian's career\n4:20 Comment: James playing with Benzema, Carvajal who also came in on that wing\n4:24 Comment: The Frenchman did not see him, James with a shot option, James's ball proves it\n4:28 Comment: Entered, stops him, Pletikosa\n4:31 Comment: and also here Bale, I think Bale was quite well placed here\n4:36 Comment: on the left side so that he would have given the pass\n4:38 Comment: but well the option of shooting by a striker in this case of James\n4:41 Comment: is also always good, card you will see here\n4:44 Comment: That entry does not correspond to what we are seeing in the game Roberto\n4:48 Comment: It is the first yellow card seen in the match, seen by Toni Kroos\n4:51 Comment: after seeing how Fedekar Tavián escapes, the German miscalculated\n4:54 Comment: when cutting the play\n4:56 Comment: Ammonista, the German player\n5:0 Comment: That's where Fedekar Tavián fell, Mateu Laoz takes note\n5:5 Comment: and the game continues, 5 of the second half\n5:9 Comment: The result achieved in the first period by Zinedine Zidane's men\n5:16 Comment: Ramos, loan of Ramos, dangerous, the ball for Keylor Navas\n5:19 Comment: I was there, well, looking to catch something, Lucas Pérez\n5:23 Comment: Nothing, the transfer has been good, if it arrived a little defective of course\n5:27 Comment: Bel has given Lucas Pérez other options, but Keylor was also attentive and alive\n5:30 Comment: when he saw that the headbutt that Ramos gave was backwards, not forwards\n5:37 Comment: It's Gannet Bale, he tried to open towards James\n5:41 Comment: Take advantage of Fernando Navarro's indecision, Luka Modric to play towards James\n5:46 Comment: Fernando Navarro, who had previously made a mistake and now gets his team out of the quagmire\n5:51 Comment: stealing the ball from James\n5:53 Comment: Zidane\n5:57 Comment: Today is going to be interesting, it seems in minor details when the league is being resolved\n6:2 Comment: but yesterday we experienced it for example in Mestalla and today I think it will also be interesting\n6:6 Comment: see that end of the match here in Riazor because it is the moment in which the local fans\n6:10 Comment: They take advantage a little to give marks to their team and we will have to see how they react\n6:15 Comment: Leiport's followers according to how this match ends\n6:19 Comment: and they will send a message, I think, that will be quite clear to the squad and probably also to the coach.\n6:25 Comment: We have already said before that we have been reading the press and so on and they have already said that it was not\n6:30 Comment: the fans were very happy in some way with all the comments that were emerging\n6:33 Comment: through the team, the template, etc.\n6:36 Comment: But we must also recognize that the public that is here, the Depor fans know\n6:42 Comment: that Real Madrid has the obligation to win and that Real Madrid is a team\n6:46 Comment: that you can win anywhere in the world, it is not the same as, for example, in Valencia\n6:50 Comment: where they receive another team more or less of their characteristics and lose in their field\n6:55 Comment: I believe that Depor here in this aspect, unless it is a catastrophe of results\n6:59 Comment: Well, he will be well fired, as they have put up signs out there, they want next year\n7:3 Comment: be it another way or other things, but I think that in some way they will fire him well\n7:10 Comment: Let's see how this attacking action by Deportivo de La Coruña ends\n7:14 Comment: and immediately we go to look for the movement that there is in the

Comment: This has made it better\n13:14 Comment: These last games have been there\n13:16 Comment: Whether I go out or not I go out with uncertainty\n13:18 Comment: But I think that, well, he did it

in\n23:16 Comment: Kick goal\n23:18 Comment: I think Bale is talking about the referee\n23:20 Comment: He should have called the foul there on the edge of the area\n23:22 Comment: Because then Bale has been\n23:24 Comment: Somehow very influenced\n23:26 Comment: In giving the pass because I was going\n23:28 Comment: Almost falling to the ground\n23:30 Comment: And he told him\n23:32 Comment: Why hadn't he whistled?\n23:34 Comment: I believe that Mateo Laol\n23:36 Comment: He told him there in that play, he should have whistled\n23:38 Comment: He told him that he was close, surely\n23:42 Comment: It is true that these types of actions\n23:44 Comment: Then what they have is a bit of mischief\n23:46 Comment: Of the footballer, that is, Gareth Bale wanted\n23:48 Comment: Stay standing if the goal is dropped\n23:50 Comment: He has a fault left, yes or yes\n23:52 Comment: There he is again Gareth Bale\n23:54 Comment: that we don't see him\n23:56 Comment: Precisely that it is being

half\n24:6 Comment: And this is all related\n24:8 Comment: With the victory of Barcelona\n24:10 Comment: In Granada, not with the players\n24:12 Comment: From Madrid you can hypothetically\n24:14

didn't work\n24:24 Comment: The assistant is dialing\n24:26 Comment: Lack of Dani Carabajal\n24:30 Comment: That's what Mateo Laoz whistles at the end\n24:32 Comment: And another thing is that, logically, this final\n24:34 Comment: Out in three or four days\n24:36 Comment: So the game is not in three or four days.\n24:38 Comment: It seems to me that there are at least fifteen days left\n24:40 Comment: For the final, there is enough time\n24:42 Comment: To be able to recover, to be able to lift\n24:44 Comment: Somehow the physical state\n24:46 Comment: From some player,

Casemiro who wants to beat the action there\n28:2 Comment: And it is likely that he stepped on the height of the Achilles tendon\n28:4 Comment: But we already said at the beginning\n28:6 Comment: That Mateo Lovato is a referee who often seems to\n28:8 Comment: It's going to beep, but then it doesn't beep.\n28:10 Comment: As has happened now with Isco\n28:12 Comment: Or how it happened here now\n28:14 Comment: Until you see it clearly\n28:16 Comment: Well, it doesn't whistle and that's why the players\n28:18 Comment: If they stop, they lose\n28:20 Comment: Because the referee is not

seems to have some problem\n29:0 Comment: Because I was talking here with the bench\n29:2 Comment: When he was attacking Deport\n29:4 Comment: It gives me the feeling that\n29:6 Comment: Keylor was demanding something from the bench area\n29:8 Comment: And what Marcelo has done is basically\n29:10 Comment: Be the transmitter of the order\n29:12 Comment: Since one of Zidane's assistants\n29:14 Comment: Right now it's appearing along the bottom line\n29:16 Comment: And heading towards Keylor Navas' goal\n29:18 Comment: And Gesé is also going to come out now\n29:20 Comment: So I don't think I have any problem.\n29:22 Comment: Marcelo\n29:24 Comment: It will be the last change for Real Madrid\n29:26 Comment: Deportivo if I'm not mistaken\n29:28 Comment: It proposes a double substitution

I was referring to before\n31:12 Comment: And it is true that no\n31:14 Comment: There has not been a proper match\n31:16 Comment: Not even the right time\n31:18 Comment: But having that feeling of control\n31:20 Comment: Real Madrid could perhaps think\n31:22 Comment: In some kind of trial\n31:24 Comment: Looking ahead to the Champions League final\n31:26 Comment: Against Atlético de

offside\n32:12 Comment: From James and Pleticosa what does he say to James\n32:14 Comment: No, the action is invalid\n32:16 Comment: But neither the first nor the second\n32:18 Comment: Yes, but the goalkeeper didn't want to\n32:20 Comment: Let the ball step\n32:22 Comment: Inside your goal zone\n32:24 Comment: So\n32:26 Comment: That's why the other one has tried it two or three times\n32:28

    "summary": "Real Madrid took a significant step in their La Liga title chase with a dominating and comprehensive performance against Deportivo La Coruña at the Estadio Riazor. The match not only showcased Real Madrid's attacking prowess but also highlighted Cristiano Ronaldo's unrelenting ambition. Here's a blow-by-blow account of a captivating game that saw the Whites securing a crucial 0-2 victory.\n\nFrom the first whistle, it was clear that Real Madrid meant business. Within the first few seconds, Deportivo La Coruña had their first attempt on the right flank with veteran Manuel Pablo. The 40-year-old, possibly playing in his last professional game, epitomized Deportivo's fighting spirit even in the twilight of his career.\n\nDeportivo's Alejandro Arribas intercepted the ball early on but fell short as Real Madrid’s Croatian midfield maestro, Luka Modric, quickly gained control, playing neat exchanges with his teammates. The pitch conditions, influenced by a light persistent rain, made precision imperative, and Real took full advantage of the slick surface. Marcelo and Cristiano Ronaldo, along with Modric and Casemiro, controlled the midfield with ease.\n\nThe incessant pressure from Real Madrid paid off in the 7th minute when Gareth Bale exploited the left wing, leaving Manuel Pablo behind and cutting back to Benzema, who unselfishly laid it off to Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo, with his killer instinct, slotted it past the keeper to give Real the early lead they were yearning for.\n\nFollowing the early goal, Real Madrid sought to maintain their dominance. Deportivo, while retreating to defend, allowed Real Madrid substantial freedom in the middle third. Crosses from Dani Carvajal, Modric, and Marcelo kept the Deportivo defense under constant stress. Despite Deportivo’s attempts at building counter-attacks through players like Lucas Pérez and Fede Cartavia, they found it challenging to make any significant inroads.\n\nReal Madrid continuously tested Deportivo's defensive resolve, with moments of brilliance from Bale and Ronaldo. Bale, in particular, was a constant threat on the wings, making life difficult for the defenders. His pace and ability to cross were instrumental in setting up attacks for Real Madrid. A notable chance came when Carvajal launched a quick counter, sending a precise cross into the box that Bale nearly converted.\n\nThe second goal of the match came in the 25th minute. Again, it was Cristiano Ronaldo who capitalized on a set-piece, heading in from a Toni Kroos corner. The goal was hotly contested by Deportivo players, who claimed a foul in the build-up. However, the referee stood firm, and Real Madrid had doubled their lead.\n\nDespite being down by two goals, Deportivo did not back down. They continued to attempt to breach Real Madrid's defense, albeit with limited success. Pedro Mosquera had a particularly hard time dealing with Real’s midfield dynamism. Real Madrid's backline, marshaled effectively by Sergio Ramos and Pepe, remained largely untroubled during the initial exchanges of the game.\n\nTowards the end of the first half, Deportivo showed some resurgence. Fede Cartavia managed to eke out a couple of half-chances, but none that significantly troubled Keylor Navas. His solo effort after dribbling past a couple of Real players narrowly missed the target, displaying Deportivo's lingering threat.\n\nAt halftime, Zinedine Zidane made a tactical substitution, opting to bring on James Rodríguez for Ronaldo, perhaps with a view to preserving the Portuguese star's fitness for upcoming challenges. Although James brought fresh energy to the side, Ronaldo’s absence meant that the attack lacked a bit of the sharpness seen in the first half.\n\nDeportivo La Coruña started the second half with renewed vigor. Fede Cartavia continued to emerge as Depor’s standout performer, consistently troubling Real Madrid's flanks. A notable moment came when he put in a dangerous cross that momentarily unsettled the Real defense, causing Carvajal to concede a corner while attempting a clearance.\n\nReal Madrid, however, were not to be held back. Their midfield trio of Kroos, Modric, and Casemiro orchestrated play effectively, ensuring Real Madrid retained control. Casemiro’s robust defensive work, combined with Modric’s vision and Kroos’s precision, made it tough for Deportivo to find any rhythm. James Rodriguez, too, was finding pockets of space and linking up play well with Benzema and Bale.\n\nDespite Real's hold on the game, Deportivo had their moments. Lucas Pérez, trying his best to make something happen, took a shot from distance which, though saved by Navas, signaled Depor's intent. However, Real Madrid’s defense remained largely unflinching, with Pepe and Ramos effectively neutralizing Deportivo’s attacking efforts.\n\nAs the game progressed, Zidane substituted Kroos for Isco, introducing more creativity in the midfield. Isco quickly got into the action, displaying his characteristic close control and dribbling. His partnership with Marcelo on the left wing frequently opened up channels for Real Madrid, though the final ball often lacked the necessary bite.\n\nReal Madrid had chances to extend their lead. Gareth Bale continued to torment the Deportivo defense with his runs. One exceptional piece of play saw him dart past a couple of defenders, only to see his shot go agonizingly wide after a quick breakaway. Another moment saw Benzema nearly scoring from a header, only for Pleticosa to make a fine save.\n\nDeportivo, sensing the ticking clock, turned up the pressure. A crucial chance came when Lucas Pérez put in a sublime cross from the right, where Robert, who had recently come on, connected with a powerful header. Keylor Navas made an exceptional stop with his knee, showcasing his incredible reflexes and maintaining Real’s clean sheet.\n\nIn the dying minutes, both teams made final substitutions, with Deportivo bringing on Celso Borges and Oriol Riera, while Real Madrid introduced Jesé for Bale. The changes revitalized the pace of the game momentarily. Jesé added a sprightly presence on the wings for Real Madrid, creating a few more chances, but Deportivo’s defense held firm.\n\nDespite the mounting pressure towards the final whistle, Real Madrid’s defense resisted firmly. Several more attempts by Deportivo, led mostly by Cartavia and Lucas Pérez, were thwarted effectively by disciplined defending and crucial interventions by players like Marcelo and Carvajal.\n\nAs the referee blew the final whistle, the scoreboard read Deportivo La Coruña 0 - 2 Real Madrid. While Real Madrid achieved the crucial victory they needed, their fate in the title race hung on results elsewhere. The performance signaled their intent and capability but also highlighted the fact that despite their dominance, sometimes the title chase relies not just on one’s own performances but also on the outcomes of other fixtures.\n\nIn conclusion, Real Madrid's performance at Riazor was comprehensive. They displayed attacking flair, strategic efficiency, and defensive solidity. The win, led by a Cristiano Ronaldo's brace, emphasized their continuing pursuit of the La Liga title, irrespective of external results. Deportivo La Coruña, despite pockets of resistance and some promising moments, couldn’t carve out tangible opportunities to alter the scoreline. Real Madrid's tactical adaptability and depth came to the fore as Zinedine Zidane's men illustrated why they are perennial title contenders."
