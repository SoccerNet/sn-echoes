    "summary": "In a thrilling La Liga encounter at the Santiago Bernabéu, Real Madrid hosted Real Betis, delivering an exceptional performance that resulted in a dominant 5-0 victory for the home side. The match provided an electrifying atmosphere right from the kickoff, with Real Madrid showcasing their attacking prowess and Betis struggling to keep up. The detailed breakdown of the game is as follows:\n\n### First Half\n\nThe action began with Betis taking the kickoff, but Real Madrid quickly asserted their dominance. Within a minute and thirty-two seconds, Real Madrid launched their first shot on target, immediately setting the tone for the match. A mere second later, Real Madrid found the back of the net, sending the home supporters into a frenzy. The early goal was a clear declaration of Real Madrid's intent to dominate the game.\n\nBetis resumed play, but their efforts were interrupted as the ball went out of play multiple times. The first throw-in by Betis came shortly after, followed by another attempt by Real Madrid which resulted in a shot on target. Despite their early attempts, Betis found themselves constantly on the defensive, struggling to maintain possession and build any significant attacks.\n\nReal Madrid's relentless pressure paid off as they continued to force errors from Betis. A foul by Betis at the 3:53 mark gave Real Madrid an opportunity from a direct free-kick. The ensuing shot on target from Real Madrid, however, was met with a stout defense. \n\nAt the 5:13 mark, Real Madrid earned their first corner of the match but were caught offside shortly after, giving Betis a momentary reprieve. Betis tried to regroup with an indirect free-kick but soon lost the ball out of play again. The pressure from the home side was relentless.\n\nThroughout the first half, Real Madrid's players demonstrated excellent teamwork and seamless passing. Gareth Bale’s attempts to cross were remarkable, though one such cross didn't find its mark. A shot from Cristiano Ronaldo was also slightly off-target. The resilience of Betis' defense was tested repeatedly, with their clearances not alleviating the pressure for long.\n\nBetis got occasional opportunities, including a stint at the goal which resulted in shots off-target. Ruben Castro and Alvaro Cejudo for Betis tried to change the tide but were unsuccessful, with Real Madrid’s defense holding firm. Betis managed to get a few corners, but Real Madrid's defense was unyielding.\n\nA significant moment came at the 23:10 mark when Toni Kroos received a yellow card for Real Madrid, following a contentious tackle. Betis responded with aggressive play, which led to another yellow card for Juan Vargas at the 29:00 mark for a reckless challenge. The match saw its fair share of fouls and free-kicks as both teams fought for control.\n\nReal Madrid's second goal came from a spectacular free-kick by James Rodriguez at the 38:14 mark. The shot was impeccable, bending into the net from the edge of the box, making it 2-0 in favor of Real Madrid. The goalkeeper had no chance of stopping it, highlighting Rodriguez’s exceptional skill.\n\nThe first half ended with Real Madrid leading 2-0. They had dominated the half, with most of the actions taking place in Betis' territory. Betis had their moments, but Real Madrid’s defense, spearheaded by players like Sergio Ramos and Marcelo, managed to thwart their attempts efficiently.\n\n### Second Half\n\nThe second half kicked off with a substitution by Betis. Francisco Jose Molinero Calderon was replaced by Jorge Molina, a tactical move by Pepe Mel, the Betis coach, to bring fresh energy into the squad. Real Madrid resumed play energetically, adding to their lead within two minutes. Gareth Bale’s lofted cross was met by Karim Benzema's precise header, making it 3-0. The goal reinforced Real Madrid's dominance and spelled an arduous second half for Betis.\n\nShortly after, Real Madrid struck again at the 4:00 mark. James Rodriguez found space inside the box and sent a composed finish into the bottom right corner, increasing the lead to 4-0. Betis barely had time to regroup as the goals continued pouring in.\n\nDespite the deficit, Betis continued to press forward. Ruben Castro had a chance at the 15:31 mark when Betis was awarded a penalty. However, Keylor Navas showcased his shot-stopping prowess, pulling off a spectacular save to deny Castro and keep the scoreline intact.\n\nReal Madrid made a couple of strategic substitutions, bringing on Isco and Casemiro, replacing Benzema and Kroos respectively. This did not deter their attacking momentum as they kept pushing forward, adding to Betis' woes. Cristiano Ronaldo, though having several attempts saved or blocked, played a pivotal role in midfield and attack, continuously creating opportunities.\n\nIn the 37:40 mark, Real Madrid’s incessant attacks culminated in another corner. The short corner resulted in several attempts before Gareth Bale delivered a stellar strike from long range at the 43:03 mark.
