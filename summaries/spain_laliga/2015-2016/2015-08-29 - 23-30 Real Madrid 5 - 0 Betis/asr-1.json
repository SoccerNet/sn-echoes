was already impossible for Endiaye.\n36:46 Comment: No, and Rubén is also asking for it on the opposite side, they have to be faster.\n36:51 Comment: Well, look, they give their hand to the ball, that's what they demand.\n36:54 Comment: We see it, he hits the Real Betis player on the arm.\n37:2 Comment: The assistant raised it, the flag and foul on the side of the area.\n37:8 Comment: Maricardo's referee goes, Card in hand, we see Pichini's previous hand.\n37:12 Comment: And now the warning that will be given to Molinero if I'm not mistaken.\n37:17 Comment: For Molinero, yes, who was protesting insistently to the assistant.\n37:21 Comment: The assistant also PPM, very angry because he didn't even see a fault in that play between Molinero and Cristiano Ronaldo.\n37:27 Comment: The assistant who was closest to the play pointed it out.\n37:29 Comment: And finally he has also seen a Yellow Card on the Real Betis Balompié side.\n37:35 Comment: That's Pichini's hand, which the referee didn't appreciate.\n37:44 Comment: There we see that Xavi Torres grabbed an extra good grip by grabbing Rafael Varane by the neck.\n37:50 Comment: The truth is that he does not envy the work of the referees at all.\n37:54 Comment: It is difficult to see the things that happen in the area and many things happened there.\n37:57 Comment: We have seen two examples.\n37:59 Comment: The foul that Molinero committed on Cristiano, James is going to take.\n38:4 Comment: Then you have a criterion, you have to take it in tenths of seconds.\n38:7 Comment: Here on camera it is very easy to see things, but live it is true that there are two assistants who can also see it from another perspective.\n38:15 Comment: James' ball! What an outrage! What a great goal Xavi Rodríguez just scored!\n38:22 Comment: Mathematics said that you can draw a curve that carries the ball, but it is very difficult with a ball.\n38:29 Comment: But Xavi Rodríguez has just made the difficult thing easy.\n38:33 Comment: Mel protests because he was not at all convinced by the previous foul.\n38:38 Comment: Second goal for Real Madrid.\n38:40 Comment: Xavi Rodríguez just made, Rubén, a masterful launch.\n38:44 Comment: Yes, it's a great goal, it's a great goal.\n38:47 Comment: Capital word, let's go.\n38:49 Comment: There everyone is waiting for a closed center.\n38:53 Comment: The possibility that the players, even the rival team, could put it into their own goal.\n38:59 Comment: And suddenly I took that whip out of you, a long, strong, tense stick.\n39:4 Comment: I think it's a hat tip for that shot that James just made.\n39:9 Comment: What's happening is that this is having consequences, Ricardo, especially in the case of Real Betis, where there is monumental anger.\n39:16 Comment: Yes, tremendous. As you said, it was more than anything from Pepe Mel, especially because of the signaling of that lack of Molinero.\n39:21 Comment: It was not clear to me before James' release and obviously with the consequences that this goal has brought, much less so.\n39:27 Comment: They have caught your attention.\n39:29 Comment: He applauded the assistant and Hernández Hernández is going to fire him.\n39:32 Comment: He kept protesting and the referee Hernández Hernández, the assistant, is approaching.\n39:37 Comment: At the moment the referee is calming him down. He tells him to calm down, to calm down, to go to the bench.\n39:44 Comment: Pepe Mel sits down, the Real Betis coach is very angry, the ball is standing, because of that goal.\n39:48 Comment: But above all because of the previous foul that made James's extraordinary goal, second of the game, possible.\n39:53 Comment: And by the way, James is a specialist in scoring goals of extraordinary, beautiful and quite complicated workmanship, as we say. Very nice.\n40:2 Comment: In the end the teams, that is, the players, are untouchable. There are some who claim that space for themselves and any names we want can come to mind.\n40:9 Comment: In the case of Real Madrid, I think James is starting to reach that level.\n40:13 Comment: Well, James showed it last year, that he was an essential player.\n40:18 Comment: And then we have Cristiano Ronaldo, who is the top scorer.\n40:22 Comment: And well, on that list I think he is the first candidate.\n40:26 Comment: But of course, those goals from Cristiano Ronaldo also come from James' assists and the help of his teammates.\n40:31 Comment: I think Real Madrid has 5 or 6 players who are untouchable and one of them is obviously James.\n40:37 Comment: Marcelo, Álvaro Cejudo leaves his leg, fouls Marcelo.\n40:42 Comment: Well, the situation that has been experienced there in the technical area of ​​Real Betis is tense.\n40:46 Comment: The anger of Pepe Mel, Hernández, Hernández, I think the referee was very temperate.\n40:51 Comment: I say this because he has limited himself to warning Pepe Mel and tempering the situation a little.\n40:58 Comment: Yes, we have seen technicians expelled with very similar gestures, even minor ones.\n41:5 Comment: Well, but it seems good to me that you go and warn him, it's not a question of having to fire coaches.\n41:10 Comment: We also see that you have a very high adrenaline and at a certain moment you can make a mistake.\n41:16 Comment: And the referee, who, although he also has a very high heart rate from blowing his whistle during the game, acted correctly for me.\n41:24 Comment: True, and also commendable in that aspect Hernández, Hernández.\n41:28 Comment: When Cejudo receives, Alfredo Etiaye is going to get the ball, but the control comes out very open to the right.\n41:34 Comment: Etiaye puts in the center, at the far post is Rubén Castro, who hits the ball well and brings it down to the ground.\n41:39 Comment: Play ball with Vargas, Vargas knows that the front has a partner who is Ceballos.\n41:45 Comment: Molinero and Vargas split and Real Betis's ideas are already blocked a bit.\n41:50 Comment: On the inside, Ceballos, how beautiful the return goes in Molinero's face, he puts the ball back.\n41:54 Comment: Rubén Castro who can score him.\n41:56 Comment: In the end Keylor took the ball after an impeccable action by Real Betis.\n42:3 Comment: In which that combination between Molinero, Cejudo and Rubén Castro was about to end in a goal.\n42:11 Comment: At Real Madrid the offside and Cristiano's response.\n42:15 Comment: Keylor, Keylor.\n42:16 Comment: On the first leg of Santiago de Donabéu, a great save by Keylor Navas. Maybe Rubén Castro was a little slow, but it is also true that Keylor Navas was very fast.\n42:23 Comment: Great save, which saved the tie on the scoreboard. We were already beaten on the ground.\n42:29 Comment: He got up, he stretched out his hand again.\n42:32 Comment: An abdominal strength that has made one save a tie.\n42:38 Comment: It is also strange that Rubén Castro is not skilled in that circumstance, because he is a very fast player.\n42:43 Comment: And right now he just saved the 1-1.\n42:46 Comment: Good intervention from Keylor, which he read in the stands. I insist, we will see what the final situation of Keylor Navas is when the transfer period ends.\n42:53 Comment: A detail, the anterior contra of the posterior.\n42:56 Comment: Real Madrid, in which the referee indicated Cristiano was offside.\n42:59 Comment: I have doubts about that offside.\n43:2 Comment: And now with the ball moving it is James, who looks for Gareth Bale.\n43:7 Comment: Toni Kroos, great ball from Kroos for James Rodríguez.\n43:11 Comment: James goes in until Villón, hence he couldn't get the pass towards Gareth Bale.\n43:15 Comment: Roba Ceballos.\n43:18 Comment: Judo, Endiagi.\n43:21 Comment: Alfred Endiagi.\n43:23 Comment: Supported by Rubén Castro.\n43:26 Comment: He puts his leg into Danilo, but the ball reaches Dani Ceballos.\n43:30 Comment: Pichini.\n43:33 Comment: First half almost there.\n43:36 Comment: Rushing the last moments.

about changes in games, but about players who know that they are going to come and go because the calendar will allow it.\n17:6 Comment: Now at the beginning it's better, no, but I think that as the season progresses,\n17:12 Comment: The coach must have that in mind because in the end 60 games, 65 games in the season are a lot\n17:19 Comment: so that everyone has their chance to come out in the eleven.\n17:22 Comment: We have players like the signing Kovacic, Carvajal with Danilo, Pepe, who we also remember is a starting player, now Varane is starting.\n17:31 Comment: Well, what a ball from

ball goes out, Petzela arrives there, who will be a pichini, who takes the throw.\n18:16 Comment: Toni Kroos is the player who has left the field of play.\n18:19 Comment: We are probably waiting for Luka Modric's seat because of that blow he suffered at the end of the first half.\n18:26 Comment: But that means that Luka Modric is perfectly fine because the change in midfield is Toni Kroos.\n18:32 Comment: Applauded by the Santiago Bernabéu, Casemiro will enter.\n18:34 Comment: My memory is correct, it is possible that there could be mistakes from Mati.\n18:38 Comment: Toni Kroos is one of the players who played practically everything last season.\n18:43 Comment: One of those who was less replaced, one of those who had less respite, well almost in line with what I asked you before.\n18:50

team is a team that has a good team of players.\n19:2 Comment: And that can give those players that break.\n19:4 Comment: It is also true that last year Modric spent two or three months out of the competition.\n19:9 Comment: And that made Toni Kroos the fundamental man in the midfield and he had to play every minute.\n19:15 Comment: Well, let's hope that this year they respect the injuries.\n19:18 Comment: And then the coach can have that approach of making rotations, not by force, but because the players win it.\n19:27 Comment: Marcelo tried to use his heel to avoid the throw-in.\n19:32 Comment: The ball that didn't go out in the first instance, then ended up going over that Cal line.\n19:37 Comment: 20 minutes will be up in the second half.\n19:41 Comment: Real

positive out of here.\n27:19 Comment: But at least they are trying to leave their mark by cheering on their team.\n27:23 Comment: In the end, you have to interpret football, I think that would be healthy.\n27:28 Comment: Like fun and enjoyment.\n27:31 Comment: Eliminate the word suffering as much as possible.\n27:32 Comment: For the vetic follower of the panorama it is clear that it is not

classic.\n30:1 Comment: There is something wrong, maybe the wrinkled stocking.\n30:5 Comment: It hasn't gone well.\n30:7 Comment: Back to the changes.\n30:8 Comment: Two different midfielders, now Real Madrid.\n30:11 Comment: As we said, Benítez is showing his ideas and his intentions as the season progresses.\n30:18 Comment: Yes, I think that in a more even match the two midfielders would not have been changed.\n30:23 Comment: You can change one, but changing both together I think it is difficult to achieve a more even match.\n30:31 Comment: What happens is that now the result gives you that comfort and allows other players to also get minutes.\n30:36 Comment: Well, also take minutes.\n31:7 Comment: In the end these types of evaluations for a goalkeeper are always a bit cruel.\n31:12 Comment: Rubén has conceded four goals, but he has saved us some points.\n31:15 Comment: Yes, he made three very good saves, especially against Cristiano.\n31:18 Comment: Cristiano has given him two very good one-on-ones.\n31:21 Comment: And I think he shouldn't be surprised, knowing that he's been on the other team and seen thrashes.\n31:28 Comment: Knowing that Cristiano, Bale, also came with the scoring hangover from the last game.\n31:34 Comment: I knew it was going to be difficult for him.\n32:5 Comment: He will visit the Real Club Deportivo Español.\n32:10 Comment: While Real Betis receives Real Sociedad with a volley, James.\n32:15 Comment: Who is not afraid of any technical detail.\n32:18 Comment: Today he has already shown two pearls.\n32:20 Comment: Another one!

fantasy.\n32:36 Comment: Well, they have grown emotionally, everything is going well for them, they are getting lucky.\n32:41 Comment: And then he has a lot of technical quality to be able to make those types of gestures.\n32:46 Comment: Casemiro.\n32:48 Comment: Bruno lands well, Xavi Torres plays, Jorge Molina takes the ball.\n32:54 Comment: Jorge Molina on a trip.\n32:55 Comment: The ball falls to Sergio Ramos.\n32:58 Comment: He's in a hurry to play with Marcelo.\n33:1 Comment: Isco.\n33:3 Comment: He detaches himself from Digar, looks for the wall with Cristiano.\n33:7 Comment: Isco falls, they knock him down in the front.\n33:10 Comment: Foul on Arroyo de la Miel.\n33:16 Comment: And it hinders Pensela.\n33:18 Comment: Well, opportunity for Cristiano, right?\n33:21 Comment: He lacks a direct shot, he has a magnificent shot.\n33:24 Comment: Also very close to the area border line.\n33:28 Comment: Difficult for the goalkeeper if he is going to goal.\n33:31 Comment: It's Ramos's great Chilean that ended up hitting the post.\n33:34 Comment: A previous Chilean by Jaume Rodríguez.\n33:38 Comment: It ended in a goal.\n33:39 Comment: A comment from Isco directed at Cristiano.\n33:42 Comment: Christian who only looks at the ball.\n33:47 Comment: And Real Betis who had a large barrier trying to avoid.\n33:53 Comment: The goal, the Portuguese shot.\n33:57 Comment: 24 minutes, Cristiano Ronaldo.\n34:0 Comment: And the goal.\n34:2 Comment:  The goal.\n34:6 Comment: 24 minutes, Cristiano Ronaldo.\n34:9 Comment: Antonio Adam.\n34:11 Comment: Adam stayed in place, he didn't move an inch and he was right.\n34:15 Comment: Yes, there you have to have a hit that lowers you very well to get it over the barrier,\n34:20 Comment: because it was very close.\n34:22 Comment: If he shoots it over the barrier, it's a great goal and you have to applaud him,\n34:25 Comment: But because of your stick he can't put it in.\n34:29 Comment: The goalkeeper, the former Real Madrid player, got in there.\n34:32 Comment: When Kovasic has the ball, it's a difficult pass for Casemiro that doesn't arrive,\n34:37 Comment: Cejudo recovers for Betis, Gareth Bale recovers for Real Madrid.\n34:40 Comment: Casemiro and Marcelo, Isco, Petzela.\n34:46 Comment: Petzela is there to send the ball out for the Hernández-Hernández game, Ricardo.\n34:52 Comment: Yes, third and last change at Real Betis, the foot ball.\n34:55 Comment: The Brazilian Petros is going to enter in these final minutes of the game.\n34:59 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo's goal is being received.\n35:2 Comment: Pull Ndiaye.\n35:8 Comment: The truth is that they have made an effort, and today any effort by Real Betis seems to have been condemned to nothing,\n35:14 Comment: but a lot of sacrifice.\n35:16 Comment: Petros is going to get into that midfield.\n35:20 Comment: Brazilian footballer, also new this season in the ranks of Real Betis.\n35:28 Comment: Ex-Corinthians.\n35:33 Comment: Bale has lost his

him.\n36:14 Comment: Sergio Ramos has to decide quickly.\n36:18 Comment: He decided to control, dominate and in the end avoid the pressure of Álvaro Cejudo.\n36:25 Comment: Danilo.\n36:28 Comment:  James.\n36:29 Comment: The game, perhaps Rubén, was over very early in the second half.\n36:34 Comment: Yes, as soon as minute one of the second half started, I scored another goal,\n36:39 Comment: Well, it's already becoming very difficult for Betis.\n36:42 Comment: And above all, having Real Madrid in front of us, with that ambition and with that desire for that scoring drought,\n36:51 Comment: Well, reverse the situation and how you have reversed it.\n36:55 Comment: Dígar.\n36:57 Comment: And key was that stop by Keylor Navas in the first half.\n37:1 Comment: You remember with 2-0, if I had scored there, maybe the film would have been different,\n37:5 Comment: Leaving 2-1 to the locker room, but obviously that stop against Rubén Castro and Keylor Navas,\n37:11 Comment: He kept that up and then the third came and that was the end of Betis, the game was practically over.\n37:15 Comment: Keylor Navas hasn't left even a crumb to the Betis attackers.\n37:19 Comment: And in that action that you point out, obviously also the penalty.\n37:22 Comment: And the Costa Rican has a very high level.\n37:26 Comment: Danilo was faster than Vargas, he took the ball, he plays with Cristiano,\n37:30 Comment: Three Real Madrid players arrive, Petzela.\n37:33 Comment: He manages to clear Körner, Bruno had already stopped the ball a bit before.\n37:38 Comment: Real Madrid gets out quickly.\n37:41 Comment: James isn't coming.\n37:43 Comment: If the Betis player does it there, he can leave.\n37:48 Comment:  Counterattack.\n37:50 Comment: Well things haven't worked out there, after a good robbery by Petros,\n37:54 Comment: A bad pass has arrived, this one from Marcelo is directed at Gareth Bale, at Dan.\n37:59 Comment: Gareth Bale, I think this second part has gone very unnoticed.\n38:4 Comment: We have seen few dangerous actions from him and more from Cristiano Ronaldo.\n38:12 Comment: We see the goalkeeper's anticipation.\n38:15 Comment: It is Casemiro who directs the ball.\n38:18 Comment: To Danilo.\n38:20 Comment:  James.\n38:24 Comment: Kovačić.\n38:26 Comment: Casemiro, the Croatian again.\n38:31 Comment: It's Bullet.\n38:33 Comment: Guisco and that leads him to lose the ball.\n38:35 Comment: Xavi Torres.\n38:37 Comment: Effort of Rubén Castro.\n38:40 Comment: It can't be until the end.\n38:41 Comment: And if this ended like this, it would be curious if after two days neither Leo Messi nor Cristiano Ronaldo had scored.\n38:47 Comment: Let's see, here the Portuguese has a few minutes left, but I certainly don't remember since the two coincide in our league,\n38:53 Comment: That after two days neither of them would have scored.\n38:55 Comment: Anecdotal, obviously it's only two days, but we are used to absolutely extraordinary figures from both of them.\n39:3 Comment: It's out of the ordinary, but it hasn't gone well.\n39:6 Comment: The figures of both of them are out of the ordinary when they are correct, and they are also abnormal when they are not correct.\n39:13 Comment: In this case in these first two days of the league, but this has just begun.\n39:19 Comment: The year is going to be very intense in terms of football.\n39:23 Comment: Yes, they go two days without scoring a goal and then the next one they each score a hat-trick.\n39:27 Comment: It's possible, or two in a row.\n39:29 Comment: Yes, there have been two or more, less between each one.\n39:31 Comment: Cristiano put his arm over the Brazilian, who didn't like Cristiano Ronaldo's gesture at all.\n39:40 Comment: The Jameses are going to serve, he approached Kovasic, the Colombian decides to send the ball to the area, Ramos jumps.\n39:48 Comment: There's a corner, no, goal kick.\n39:51 Comment: Sergio Ramos gets angry, he says that the studs fought in the jump.\n39:54 Comment: Sergio Ramos finishes and then...\n39:57 Comment: It will be the Counter-Attack.\n39:59 Comment: Yes, but nothing more than Strike determined in the karma that the pod remains felt by a Parsley to the 합ote,\n40:4 Comment: which can attack, after Renault has criticized the name of the garage,\n40:7 Comment: That if only one step is outdated in a rughters,\n40:10 Comment: but it's a speed, a hapsote,\n40:15 Comment: and he was going to cook the parcel as quickly as possible,\n40:18 Comment: The champion Adan Casemiro, the jump goes up and hits Digard in the face. Digard puts his elbow in Casemiro's face to Digard.\n40:32 Comment: Yes, the referees are usually very attentive in these types of actions. Jumping with your arm even if only to protect yourself is dangerous because the elbow hits the French Betis player.\n40:40 Comment: It hurt him, I think it opened a gap.\n40:42 Comment: That is why it is dangerous to jump like that. The referees are very attentive in these types of circumstances because it is a clear foul by Casemiro when he jumped and hit the Betis player with his elbow.\n40:52 Comment: Finished being reprimanded.\n40:54 Comment: Because even if it's not voluntary when you jump like that, it obviously carries a danger.\n41:1 Comment: I was surprised by the referee's reaction. He had calmly called a foul but when he saw the blood he went to warn the player.\n41:9 Comment: At the end of the day I think the blow is the same, it doesn't matter if it has blood or not. If it's a yellow card it's a yellow card.\n41:15 Comment: The risk of sticking out the elbows is obviously penalized. Casemiro went to hurt him. It was a mere accident.\n41:24 Comment: It is true that Fernández decided when he saw the cut that the French player had.\n41:32 Comment: He has tended to say, Betis with one less. He throws a hat to Isco to get away from the Real Betis defender.\n41:38 Comment: No concrete from Pichini. Cristiano who breaks from the right. Isco who reaches the finishing area. Cristiano who centers.\n41:46 Comment: After hitting the ball on Bruno, he goes for a corner.\n41:52 Comment: Say that you want to return quickly, but of course, if the wound is not properly sealed, you will leave the field again.\n42:1 Comment: The room tells him no, no, no, the room won't let him in.\n42:4 Comment: Time is running out. Isco takes the corner. Gareth Bale was going for the shot. Jorge Molina was impeccable in the clearance.\n42:20 Comment: Real Betis will continue looking for its first league victory. Throwing in a draw at home and a defeat.\n42:27 Comment: In any case, Real Betis' initial schedule in the first two days has not been very favorable either.\n42:34 Comment: A team like Villarreal and now the visit to Real Madrid. Casemiro. Marcelo.\n42:42 Comment: The Villarreal that already demonstrated its potential yesterday by coming back against the Real Club Deportivo Español.\n42:48 Comment: Anilo. Mateo Kovasic. Kovasic who in the end Rubén, I don't know if whenever we see him we will see him in that position when Gareth Bale shoots.\n42:58 Comment: Goal. Shot by Gareth Bale that hits the stick of the ball with tremendous violence.\n43:5 Comment: And the ball ends up inside the goal. Real Madrid's fifth.\n43:10 Comment: Gareth Bale who seemed to have taken a break but knocks on the door again.\n43:14 Comment: Yes, what we had said before, one of Bale's colleagues is also the shot on goal and the goal.\n43:20 Comment: I think Benítez also wants him in that intermediate position so that as soon as he can he shoots on goal he does.\n43:27 Comment: Because look, he just showed the shot he has. 20 meters off the ball.\n43:34 Comment: It comes on the inside of the stick and ends up inside the Real Betis frame.\n43:39 Comment: In the end Ricardo is taking a harsh punishment from his visit to the Bernabéu.\n43:44 Comment: Yes, at the moment 5-0. There are still a few minutes left until the 45th.\n43:49 Comment: This is a tremendous setback for Real Betis football, which is clearly already hoping to try to get something positive.\n43:55 Comment: But those are the ones who have stayed in the area.\n43:57 Comment: Two goals from Bale, one of the footballers who has caused the most people to talk.\n44:1 Comment: Two goals from James who was not present in the first game.\n44:5 Comment: And a bit from Benzema who returned to Real Madrid today.\n44:10 Comment: Real Betis is a team that has to be a team that goes into the fight.\n44:14 Comment: And you don't go to the fight, you go to the fight.\n44:22 Comment: Two goals from Benzema who returned to Real Madrid today.\n44:27 Comment: There was a foul on Petzela.\n44:30 Comment: And to go back to what I was going to ask you just before that Gareth Bale shot came.\n44:35 Comment: We are watching Kovacic.\n44:37 Comment: Evidently today's circumstances are not enough to assess what it can contribute.\n44:42 Comment: But I don't know if in the end we will always see him in that central midfield position or perhaps in a further forward position.\n44:47 Comment: I think he has come to replace Modric and Kroos.\n44:52 Comment: And they're going to use that double pivot in front of the defense.\n44:56 Comment: And it is true that Toni Kroos and Modric are also offensive like Kovacic.\n45:2 Comment: So he's going to have to get used to defending longer spaces here.\n45:7 Comment: But I think that's going to be your position.\n45:9 Comment: Three minutes left in the game.\n45:11 Comment: Grancia, Ricardo, Cejudo center.\n45:14 Comment: The ball that goes towards Pepe Melo.\n45:17 Comment: He's the one who gives it to Pinchini there.\n45:20 Comment: Fagao Pepe Melo.\n45:24 Comment: That he didn't like it at all, especially what happened in the play of Real Madrid's second goal.\n45:31 Comment: What I still have a doubt about is whether what he was protesting was that there was no fault of Moldinero on Cristiano.\n45:37 Comment: Or that the foul, the referee would not have indicated it, would have been indicated by the assistant who was closest.\n45:42 Comment: And that ended up making Melo angry.\n45:47 Comment: The Real Betis coach will surely explain this.\n45:52 Comment: Marcelo Dicart.\n45:56 Comment: Heel Christian for Gareth Bale.\n45:58 Comment: Xavi Torres wants to stop him by putting his arm in it.\n46:2 Comment: Yes, he put it in front of his face, he was trying to continue Gareth Bale's career.\n46:6 Comment: The referee saw it, a clear foul because of that grab.\n46:8 Comment: That lack of communication with Xavi Torres' arm on Gareth Bale.\n46:12 Comment: Marilla for the Real Betis midfielder.\n46:17 Comment: Moldinero, Vargas, Xavi Torres, Varane, Kroos, Casemiro.\n46:23 Comment: The sight of those cautioned in the match.\n46:28 Comment: Ramos, Danilo.\n46:32 Comment: Danilo and Casemiro.\n46:38 Comment: Raphael Varane.\n46:39 Comment: Note from Casemiro to James Bruno.\n46:44 Comment: The ball is finally going to end up going to the Colombian.\n46:47 Comment: Bellegará to Cobas and Cheste combines with Isco.\n46:50 Comment: Isco, who puts the center, closes Petzela very well.\n46:53 Comment: Vargas.\n46:57 Comment: Vargas, James who not only cut the ball, he landed it in a good position.\n    \n\n    #######TASK \n    Provide a factually correct and detailed textual description of the game compiled from the information presented above from different sources, in more than 1000 words.\n            \"Comment.\": represents the real-time noisy commentary from the commentator as the game progresses.\n    Don't mention sources of information like commentators or captions, write as if you saw them live.\n    \n    ",
    "summary": "In a splendid display of dominance, Real Madrid crushed Real Betis 5-0 at home in the Santiago Bernabéu. The match began with an air of anticipation as both teams positioned themselves for a tough encounter. The sizeable crowd at the historic stadium brimmed with excitement. Real Betis kicked off, with Rubén Castro initiating the first play immediately pushing the ball to the right. However, Real Madrid quickly showcased their intent when James Rodríguez launched the early offensive by assisting Gareth Bale for a stunning goal just minutes into the game.\n\nThe opening of the first half saw a series of quick combinations between Real Madrid players, notably Sergio Ramos, Luka Modric, and James Rodríguez. The Colombian, recently shrouded with doubts about his role, quickly proved his worth with precise and creative passing. Within less than three minutes, in a spectacular interplay, James Rodríguez provided an impeccable cross which Gareth Bale brilliantly headed into the net to open the scoring with a powerful strike.\n\nReal Betis tried to regroup and muster a counteroffensive, but their defense repeatedly faltered under the pressure. With stars like Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo showcasing their offensive prowess, it was evident that the visitors were struggling to contain the relentless Madridistas. The energy and talent of James Rodríguez further unsettled Betis’ defensive setup, exposing them to more threat. In the early exchanges, Real Betis found it difficult to hold possession and navigate Real Madrid's high pressing game. The tension in the Betis defense grew, reflected in their disjointed efforts to reclaim control.\n\nReal Betis' moment of respite came momentarily via efforts from Álvaro Cejudo and Rubén Castro, but their forays into Madrid's defensive territory never materialized into concrete chances. On the contrary, the opportunities only emboldened the home side. Adamant on not allowing any goals against them, Keylor Navas stood out with a few essential saves, including one critical stop that maintained the clean sheet in the face of a close attempt by Betis.\n\nThe first half belonged largely to Real Madrid, their midfield dynamo orchestrating continuous threats. Through a well-exhibited football philosophy focusing on discipline and positioning, Los Blancos retained most of the possession. Modric's fluidity, combined with the varied advances from Kroos and Danilo, kept Madrid at the forefront. By the time the half-hour mark approached, Madrid had heightened the pace, with waves of attacks that bore glimpses of potential goals.\n\nThe second goal came in the 39th minute from another moment of individual brilliance. Awarded a free-kick after a foul, James Rodríguez displayed his exquisite technique, curling the ball with unmatched precision to beat the Betis goalkeeper and double Madrid's lead. The Colombian maestro celebrated his moment of glory, exhibiting the class that made him a formidable component of Real Madrid’s attacking armory. The mentality and tactical discipline of Betis seemed to wane with each passing minute, visibly frustrated by their inability to close down Madrid’s relentless pursuit of goals.\n\nAt halftime, Real Betis had already absorbed significant damage; they trailed 2-0. Their manager, Pepe Mel, made critical changes with hopes of altering the course; Jorge Molina came in to bring more firepower. Real Betis adjusted their formation and heightened pressing in an attempt to mitigate Madrid's influence. However, Real Madrid resumed control swiftly in the second half just as they had done in the beginning.\n\nBarely five minutes into the second half, Real Madrid executed a fluid and intricate attacking move. The play saw contributions from Danilo and James before Gareth Bale slotted the ball perfectly to Benzema. Positioned just a couple of meters away from the goal, Benzema made no mistake and scored with ease, making it 3-0. Again, the defensive flaws of Betis’ backline were glaring, as Benzema found himself unmarked, further compounding Betis’ woes.\n\nThe real showstopper came shortly after when James Rodríguez extended Real Madrid’s lead with what can only be described as a goal from the realm of video games. From the edge of the box, the Colombian executed a flawless overhead kick, a majestic bicycle kick that extended the hosts’ lead to 4-0. This piece of brilliance further showcased James' impeccable skill set and undoubted football intellect.\n\nReal Madrid's attack seemed unending, maintaining a high tempo across all aspects of their play. Betis hardly managed to threaten significantly, largely nullified by Madrid's defensive discipline led by Ramos and Varane. Betis’ possession was ephemeral and inconsequential, thwarted by Real Madrid’s tactical astuteness and sheer quality.\n\nBetis had a glimmer of hope when awarded a penalty after Jorge Molina was brought down by Varane in the box. Rubén Castro stepped up to take the penalty but was denied by an incredible save from Keylor Navas, who not only stopped the ball but retained possession. This all but sealed Betis’ fate, an emblematic moment that symbolized Madrid's superiority on that day.\n\nAs the game drew closer to its end, there loomed a constant threat of more goals from a rampant Real Madrid side. Bale further solidified the victory with a phenomenal long-range strike that nestled into the bottom corner off the post, rounding off the score at a commanding 5-0. This strike encapsulated Bale’s formidable presence, reaffirming Real Madrid’s uncompromised offensive threat.\n\nReal Betis departed greatly battered but perhaps with lessons learned from the humbling defeat at Santiago Bernabéu. For Real Madrid, it was a much-needed statement after previous criticisms, showcasing their well-endowed talent and tactical flexibility. The forwards had proven lethal, the midfield had remained composed and creative, and the defense, led ably by Navas, held firm. This resounding victory symbolized not just the raw potential but the synchronous working of Real Madrid’s well-oiled football machinery, promising more commanding performances as the season progresses."
