As the clock struck 00:00, Real Madrid kicked off, igniting a wave of anticipation among the fans. Just a minute and 53 seconds in, the ball was already out of play, marking what would be a highly engaging match from the get-go.\n\nSevilla had an early opportunity as they took a throw-in at 2:07. However, the game saw quick transitions and the ball was often out of play in the initial minutes. A shot off target by Sevilla at 2:52 kept the pressure on Real Madrid's defense, and the resulting corner at 3:24 only heightened the tension. Despite Sevilla’s efforts, including another corner at 4:17, they couldn't capitalize, and the cycle of throw-ins and shots continued, reflecting the fierce contest for possession.\n\nReal Madrid displayed a strong defensive front, clearing the ball on several occasions. The scenario changed dramatically at 5:27 when Real Madrid made their mark impeccably. A stunning shot on target culminated in a sensational goal, giving the home team a 1-0 lead. The stadium erupted in cheers as Real Madrid took the early advantage, setting the tone for the rest of the game.\n\nSevilla resumed from the kickoff at 6:12, but the ball quickly went out of play again. Real Madrid's defense was resolute, effectively neutralizing Sevilla's advances and securing throw-ins to regain possession. Despite multiple attempts by Sevilla, including shots off target and corners, they failed to break through Real Madrid’s defense. \n\nAs the first half progressed, Real Madrid maintained their offensive pressure. They secured corners and created several chances. At 10:42, a direct free-kick awarded to Real Madrid soared out of play, yet the repetitive cycle of attack and clearance continued. Sevilla's brief hope of turning the tide with their attempts on goal was met with strong defensive actions by the home team. A notable sequence at the close of the 15th minute saw Real Madrid's shot on target saved, followed by their persistence in getting another corner. \n\nThe match saw frequent stops in play due to throw-ins and offsides, reflective of the intense pace and strategic maneuvering on the field. Real Madrid's defensive tackles and offensive runs defined much of the encounter’s tempo with Sevilla managing to snatch a few offensive opportunities amid Real Madrid's dominance. \n\nReal Madrid's attacking prowess was once again seen at 18:42 when another shot on target was attempted. Despite the subsequent ball going out of play, they clearly controlled the game's rhythm. Their successive chance at 20:28 resulted in another shot on target, committing Sevilla's defense to an exhausting challenge. \n\nSevilla struggled to cope with Real Madrid's seamless transitions from defense to attack as the clock edged past the 20-minute mark. Real Madrid managed to create more opportunities, with their shots coming perilously close but often attesting to Sevilla’s goalkeeper’s alertness. The pattern of corners and clearances continued until Real Madrid momentarily wavered, allowing Sevilla brief spells of possession, although these moments rarely gave rise to any significant threat.\n\nAt 26:33, Sevilla’s relentless pursuit manifested in a critical moment—a penalty shot. However, the battle-hardened Real Madrid defense saw off this challenge, maintaining their clean slate. Sevilla's subsequent corners at 27:27 and 28:02 didn't yield the intended results, further amplifying their frustrations.\n\nThe first half concluded with Real Madrid firmly in control, despite Sevilla's spirited attempts. Near the 40th-minute mark, Real Madrid's shots on target were relentless, with quick-paced transitions resulting in several scoring chances.

But the half started much like the first one, fraught with fouls and free-kicks, marking the heightened physical and tactical contest on the field. Sevilla maintained their attacking momentum, but Real Madrid's defense demystified their plans effectively.\n\nReal Madrid, showing impressive attacking depth, secured a corner just 2:45 into the second half. They continued to press despite Sevilla’s clearances. By the 6th minute, Real Madrid had another shot off target, displaying clear intentions of doubling their lead. Seville’s defensive resilience was evident as they battled hard to clear the ball and cut off Real Madrid’s sweeping runs into their box.\n\nAmidst constant tussles and turnovers, Real Madrid's relentless tackling continued. Notably, a moment transpired at 8:50 where a Real Madrid player faced a yellow card due to an intensive but errant challenge. In retaliation, Sevilla also saw a player booked at 11:34 in a similarly fierce contesting moment which signaled just how competitive and fast-paced the game had become.\n\nOne of the decisive moments arrived at 12:24 when Real Madrid took a penalty; albeit, they did not capitalize on this golden opportunity. Real Madrid showcased a flurry of attempts, which, unfortunately, all went off target.

Exhibiting their precise free-kicking abilities, another direct free-kick morphed into a goal, pushing the score to 2-0. This remarkable uptick in Real Madrid’s goal tally brought the stadium to its feet, reinforcing the team’s dominance.\n\nSevilla restarted, visibly under pressure. At 20:33, Real Madrid struck again, making no mistakes as they brilliantly converted another shot on target into a goal, thus making it 3-0. The high tempo and intensity continued as Sevilla found themselves on the back foot, struggling yet adamant to breach Real Madrid's formidable defense.\n\nThe game was constantly punctuated with throw-ins from both sides, marking a fierce contest for ball control.

The atmosphere in the Bernabéu was electric as fans celebrated the brilliance on the pitch.\n\nThe match saw its closing minutes filled with Sevilla’s desperate attempts at damage control as they sought to regain some footing.
