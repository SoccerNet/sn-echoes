ball.\n15:56 Comment: But of course, many times when you play against Barça, perhaps Madrid is the only team in the world that can argue for FC Barcelona's possession of the ball.\n16:7 Comment: And at the moment they are failing in that attempt.\n16:10 Comment: We've been there for 16 minutes.\n16:12 Comment: Madrid has had an approach.\n16:14 Comment: But he's not having the ball.\n16:17 Comment: The gesture of Luis Suárez that will end up again in the long list of gestures for celebrations.\n16:24 Comment: Many of them have to do with the silence towards the scorer's stands against the rival fans.\n16:31 Comment: I think Raúl inaugurated it.\n16:33 Comment: Or if not, it was inaugurated by one of those who are most in our memory.\n16:38 Comment: Max Herano limps back onto the

referee whistled for a foul.\n17:29 Comment: He claimed that, as you have seen with the gesture that they were hugging him, we are going to see exactly\n17:33 Comment: What happened there.\n17:35 Comment: Well, half a dozen of some, six of others.\n17:38 Comment:  I think so.\n17:40 Comment: And in these types of situations, since it's six for one, six for another, generally\n17:46 Comment: The decisions have to do with calling what the attacker does and not the defender.\n17:55 Comment: We are talking, Michael, about Barça with the ball, but without the ball they are also pressing\n17:59 Comment: The departure from Madrid was very good.\n18:0 Comment: It's forcing Ramos to play long as well.\n18:2 Comment: Because when the game is with the ball, they are

    "summary": "In a match that will be remembered for years to come, Barcelona achieved a dominating victory over Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu, asserting their superiority in what was expected to be a competitive El Clásico. The scoreline of Real Madrid 0-4 Barcelona tells only a part of the story, as the Catalan side not only outplayed their fierce rivals but did so with a style and panache befitting their stature and legacy.\n\nFrom the very start, Barcelona seemed determined to set the pace and dictate the terms of the game. The kickoff saw the ball moved quickly to ignite the Santiago Bernabéu, as the Barcelona squad immediately applied pressure on Real Madrid. This early intensity from Barcelona set the tone for the entire match, making clear their intent to dominate both possession and play.\n\nIn the opening phases of the first half, it was evident that Barcelona had come prepared to exploit Real Madrid's weaknesses. They exercised suffocating pressure, with players like Sergio Busquets, Jordi Alba, and Gerard Piqué maintaining control and stability at the back. The connection and fluidity within the Barcelona team were palpable. Despite minimal goalmouth action in the first two minutes, the focus and strategy were clear as the game progressed.\n\nFor Real Madrid, the opening 10 minutes were an omen of what was to come, as they struggled to find coherence in their play. Passes went awry, with Sergio Ramos and Luka Modric often left scrambling against the precision of their opponents. Modric, despite his best efforts, found himself continually outmaneuvered. Cristiano Ronaldo, known for his decisive presence, encountered a forceful defensive line that restricted his typically mercurial runs and shots.\n\nBy the 13-minute mark, Barcelona's rhythm had fully set in. Piqué was formidable in defense, orchestrating plays and frustrating the Real Madrid forwards. Jordi Alba, in particular, proved to be a constant threat on the left flank, creating an early chance for Neymar, although it didn’t result in a goal. This was a precursor to what was naturally unfolding: a masterclass in possession football by Barcelona.\n\nThe 18th minute saw Real Madrid attempt to find their footing as they initiated an offensive strategy. Modric tried to open up their game, redirecting the ball to Varane and Kroos. However, Barcelona’s relentless press ensured quick recoveries, shutting down any promising attacking moves from Real Madrid before they could materialize into significant challenges. This pressing game disrupted Real Madrid, dragging them into a chaotic scramble throughout these initial moments.\n\nBarcelona’s game plan came to fruition just after 20 minutes when the intricate play from Piqué opened space for attacks. Real Madrid’s attempts at counters were futile, as they were stopped by sharp defensive reactions and clever interceptions. Messi, from the sideline early on, watched as his team controlled every corner of the pitch, every movement synchronized and impactful.\n\nThen came the breakthrough. In the 30th minute, Sergi Roberto showcased his growth and daring athleticism, slicing through Real Madrid’s midfield with a dazzling run before threading a sublime pass to Luis Suárez, who finished with the outside of his foot. This clinical move served as a testament to Barça’s training and match preparedness. 1-0 in favor of Barcelona, and the Santiago Bernabéu fell deathly silent save for pockets of stunned gasps.\n\nThe first half saw Real Madrid try to respond, with Marcelo making a run that resulted in a powerful shot blocked bravely. Yet, these efforts were sporadic, and the confidence exuded by Barcelona was dominant. Barcelona held possession, rotating the ball efficiently between involved players such as Iniesta and Rakitic, ensuring that Real Madrid had no opportunity to regroup.\n\nAs the first half drew to a close, Neymar showed his prowess with an unexpected second goal, extending Barcelona’s lead. Iniesta’s elegance was pivotal, he found Neymar with a beautiful through ball. Neymar coolly slotted the ball under Keylor Navas, making the score 2-0. At the end of the first period, Real Madrid trudged off with heads hanging while Barcelona looked positively invincible.\n\nThe second half kickoff brought no respite for Madrid. They needed a transformation, but instead faced the reinvigorated firepower of a Barcelona team ready to solidify their statement victory. Initially, a more fervent pressing was seen from Madrid players like James and Gareth Bale, but even then, Barcelona seamlessly resumed their dominance. By the 50th minute, Madrid’s brief spell of pressure dissipated, yielding their self-belief to Barça’s impeccable control.\n\nWithin minutes into the second half, Iniesta again displayed his sublime talent. Assisted by a clever Neymar backheel, Iniesta delivered a sensational strike into the top corner. This goal, reminiscent of his iconic shot at Stamford Bridge, reaffirmed not only Barcelona’s lead but also their superiority in strategy and execution. The scoreline read 3-0, Ancelotti's face reflected the mounting pressure and distress.\n\nReal Madrid’s attempted responses were met with staunch defense and articulate ball control from Barcelona. Each Real Madrid forward run, be it by Benzema or Ronaldo, found itself checked and parried by Piqué and his defensive line. By the 65th minute, frustration began to brew among the Madrid players and fans alike.\n\nIn an attempt to mitigate an inevitable loss, Isco replaced James Rodriguez; however, this change had little impact against Barcelona’s orchestrated efficiency. Luis Enrique, with tactical acumen, introduced Leo Messi post injury, allowing further flexibility and precise attacking options.\n\nAs if the pounding was not enough, Luis Suárez seized a defensive lapse to score Barcelona’s fourth in the 74th minute. Alba’s unexpected advance put the ball at Suárez’s feet, who had ample time to ensure a clinical finish past Keylor Navas, solidifying his team’s triumph and completing the Uruguayan’s brace.\n\nThe demoralizing experience began to overtake Real Madrid players, culminating in a rash challenge from Isco on Neymar, which saw him receiving a direct red card, thus reducing Madrid to ten men. The Bernabéu’s masses voiced their discontent, chants expressed deep-seated frustration towards the administration and performance.\n\nIn the remaining minutes, Barça calmly dictated play, careful not to eliminate Real Madrid’s spirit entirely, matching their forceful start with a composed end. As Carvajal, Kroos, and Modric found fewer paths past the Barça bastion, the match drifted to an evident close.\n\nThe final whistle blew to seal Barcelona’s statement victory. Fans of the Blaugrana celebrated massively, while the Madrid faithful simmered in discontent and introspection. Barcelona’s 4-0 victory at the Bernabéu was more than just a scoreline; it was the epitome of footballing brilliance over a battered Real Madrid. This was a reminder to the football world of the power and artistry of FC Barcelona."
