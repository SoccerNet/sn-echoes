    "summary": "On a brisk evening at the Santiago Bernabeu, Real Madrid put on a commanding display of football, thrashing Eibar 4-0 in a La Liga encounter that kept the home fans enthralled from the first whistle to the last. Both teams came into this match with contrasting fortunes, but few could have anticipated the sheer dominance that Real Madrid would exert on their opponents.\n\nThe match kicked off with Eibar taking the first touch of the ball, but the proceedings quickly turned in favor of the home side. Within the first minute, Eibar committed their first foul, setting the tone for a physical encounter. Real Madrid earned an indirect free kick and began their attack. The ball went out of play shortly thereafter, allowing Eibar a throw-in to regain possession.\n\nEibar's aggressive approach saw them commit another foul in the third minute, this time resulting in a yellow card. Real Madrid took advantage of the free kick, launching a shot on target that ended in the back of the net almost immediately. The Santiago Bernabeu erupted in celebration; Real Madrid was off to a flyer, with the scoreboard reading 1-0. Eibar kicked off once again but struggled to keep the ball in play, conceding a throw-in to Real Madrid just moments later.\n\nThe early goal invigorated Los Blancos, who promptly launched another offensive. Eibar’s defensive discipline was scrutinized as they resorted to frequent fouls to curb Madrid's advances. This only served to grant the home team more opportunities, including another free kick. A few minutes later, Real Madrid sent a shot off target, but their intent was clear: they were not going to take their foot off the gas.\n\nEibar tried to mount a response but found it hard to break through Real Madrid’s robust defense. A rare attempt from Keko went wide, much to the relief of Madrid’s goalkeeper, Francisco Casilla. Isco was industrious in midfield, whipping in a dangerous ball only for it to be cleared by the Eibar defense. Real Madrid’s attacking trio was relentless, with Ronaldo already proving a menace. His marked presence was highlighted when he was flagged offside shortly after volunteering for a solo run.\n\nThe 17th minute brought Real Madrid's second goal, a masterclass in teamwork. Cristiano Ronaldo showed his unselfish side by setting up Lucas Vazquez, who comfortably slotted the ball into the net, doubling the lead to 2-0. Eibar was now swimming against the tide. Merely a minute later, Ronaldo himself found the net following a neat assist from Jese, making it 3-0 and sending the home crowd into raptures. Real Madrid was now in complete control.\n\nDespite Eibar’s repeated efforts to reclaim some semblance of control, their forward attempts either went wide or were well-contained by the Madrid defense. Nacho needed some medical attention around the 22nd minute which momentarily halted the game, but he managed to continue, adding to Zidane's relief.\n\nThe match resumed and Eibar struggled to make any significant inroads. Another corner by Eibar failed to materialize into anything fruitful, and Real Madrid got back to their business. Soon enough, the relentless forward movement resulted in their fourth goal. Ronaldo, who had been pivotal throughout, split the defense with his pace before laying it off to Jese. It was an easy tap-in for the youngster, sealing a remarkable first-half hat trick for his team in the 38th minute. This goal reaffirmed Real Madrid’s dominance with a 4-0 lead.\n\nTowards the end of the first half, Eibar earned a corner but couldn't capitalize. Ronaldo had a header brilliantly saved by Eibar's goalkeeper, Asier Riesgo. The first half concluded with Real Madrid in a commanding position and the visitors trying to regroup and devise a strategy to stop the onslaught.\n\nAs the second half began, Eibar made a double substitution in hopes of mounting a more resilient display. Jota made way for David Junca, and Adrian was replaced by Borja Baston. Real Madrid also introduced Mateo Kovacic for Casemiro later in the half, indicating that Zidane wanted to maintain the momentum while managing his squad's stamina.\n\nEibar’s efforts early in the second half included a couple of shots on target, but Casilla was more than equal to the task. Real Madrid, on the other hand, continued their attacking flair. A corner for Los Blancos almost resulted in another goal, but Riesgo managed to collect the ball in a scramble inside the box.\n\nThe match had its share of rough tackles, resulting in more fouls. Eibar’s Gonzalo Escalante received a yellow card for a harsh challenge. Real Madrid’s Daniel Carvajal was substituted by Danilo. Eibar’s frustrations were apparent as they struggled to curb Real Madrid's offensive waves and were often caught fouling.\n\nReal Madrid's consistent attacks ensured that they had numerous opportunities to increase their tally. As the match wore on, they continued to control possession, passing crisply and moving fluidly. Despite their significant lead, they did not drop their intensity.\n\nEibar’s best chance came from a header that hit the crossbar, denying them a consolation goal. Real Madrid committed occasional fouls but managed to protect their clean sheet efficiently. In a slight twist, Danilo earned a yellow card for a late tackle, adding a brief moment of concern.\n\nFans were enthralled by the individual brilliance displayed, especially by Cristiano Ronaldo, who either scored or assisted in every goal. He was a constant threat, his shots either being saved or narrowly missing the target. Mateo Kovacic and Isco also shone brightly in midfield, controlling the flow of the game and dictating its tempo.\n\nTowards the closing stages, Eibar’s attempts to breach Real Madrid’s defense became increasingly desperate. The away side also made their final substitution, bringing in Izet Hajrovic for Keko, though it made little difference to the final outcome.\n\nThe game ended with Real Madrid firmly in the driving seat. The attendance of 70,689 had witnessed another spectacle of attacking football as the referee blew the whistle to conclude the match. Real Madrid’s emphatic 4-0 victory elevated their morale, adding another chapter to their storied La Liga campaign. The team's fluid passing, clinical finishing, and organized defense ensured a comprehensive victory over Eibar, who were left licking their wounds as they pondered over missed opportunities and defensive lapses. It was truly a night to remember for Los Blancos and their supporters, leaving them eagerly anticipating future conquests."
