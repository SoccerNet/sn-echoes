    "summary": "The atmosphere inside the RCDE Stadium was electrifying as Espanyol hosted Real in what was expected to be a competitive encounter. The home side kicked off proceedings promptly at 00:00, signaling the beginning of what would eventually unfold as a remarkable and unforgettable match.\n\nWithin the first minute, Espanyol showed their intent, putting pressure on Real's defense with a shot on target at 01:12. However, this initial attempt was neutralized promptly, and the ball went out of play at 01:13. Espanyol maintained their early momentum, earning a corner at 01:50, but the follow-up at 01:53 also saw the ball being cleared. Persistent in their attacks, Espanyol earned a throw-in at 02:03, but another bout of close marking forced the ball out of play again at 02:12.\n\nEspanyol secured another corner at 02:42 but it was marred shortly after by a foul at 02:44, handing Real an indirect free-kick at 02:56. Real, looking to break free from their defensive posture, made a foray forward, culminating in a shot off target at 03:15, marking their first significant offensive attempt. The ball went out of play again at 03:16, underscoring the cagey beginning of the match dominated by missed opportunities and solid defending from both sides.\n\nBy the 03:45 mark, Espanyol had to clear their lines again, evident of Real's growing confidence and territorial advantage. The back-and-forth narrative continued with the ball going out of play at 04:47, leading to Espanyol taking a throw-in at 05:05. However, another swift clearance came at 05:08.\n\nAt 05:17, Espanyol took another throw-in but soon conceded a foul at 05:34. This presented an opportunity for Real who took the indirect free-kick at 05:47, signaling a turning point as they started to assert themselves in the game. The match saw more throw-ins and out-of-play sequences, but Real's patience paid off as they finally made their first breakthrough.\n\nAt 06:42, Real fired a shot on target, a meticulously executed play that found the back of Espanyol's net at 06:43. This early goal by Real instantly breathed life into the game, putting them ahead 1-0. Espanyol resumed with a kick-off at 07:39, desperately seeking an equalizer but were caught offside at 09:54, allowing Real an indirect free-kick at 10:09.\n\nA series of fouls and free-kicks dominated the next few minutes, with Espanyol committing a foul at 10:37 and Real taking the resulting free-kick at 10:46. The ball went out of play at 11:41, with Real taking a throw-in at 11:59.\n\nReal's strategy of maintaining high pressure yielded another offside call against them at 13:21, granting Espanyol an indirect free-kick at 13:38. The physical nature of the game was exemplified by the frequent fouls, with Espanyol committing more at 14:22 and 15:32, earning a yellow card at 15:40, further intensifying the duel on the pitch.\n\nDriven by this momentum, Real scored another goal at 16:34, this time through a penalty, extending their lead to 2-0. Espanyol, taken aback by Real's clinical finishing, resumed with a kick-off at 17:18.\n\nThe game saw several disruptions with the ball frequently going out of play, leading to multiple throw-ins by both teams, notably by Real at 18:17 and 18:27. Not resting on their laurels, Real extended their lead again by scoring their third goal at 19:27, making it 3-0.\n\nEspanyol, clearly jolted, kicked off again at 20:21. Despite their efforts, they were plagued by continued fouling, one noticeable instance at 20:44, allowing Real another indirect free-kick at 21:01. Noteworthy defensive efforts, especially by Real, manifested in their clearance at 19:27, which showcased disciplined backline work against a persistent Espanyol offense.\n\nAt 23:23, the ball went out again, and Real took a throw-in at 23:41. Espanyol managed to muster a shot on target by 24:49, indicating their resolve to claw back into the game, but Real looked defensively solid.\n\nContinued fouls by Espanyol culminated in another Real free-kick at 25:30. Despite numerous efforts, including another foul against them at 25:52, Espanyol seemed unable to regain their composure as Real's attacking onslaught continued.\n\nAt 27:52, relentless Real made it 4-0, an impressive goal signifying a well-coordinated team effort. This spate of goals put Espanyol on the back foot, as evident by their kick-off at 28:46, striving to recover their standing in this increasingly one-sided contest.\n\nThe first half closed with few more highlights, including attempts and fouls by both sides. A notable foul by Real occurred at 35:16, which earned them a yellow card at 35:46, followed by a direct free-kick taken by Espanyol at 36:34. Espanyol's persistence was on show through their continued shots on target, but each effort was meticulously countered by Real’s staunch defending and efficient clearances.\n\nHalf-time changes saw Espanyol making double substitutions, eager to rejuvenate their strategy. Real kicked off the second half at 00:00, instantly placing Espanyol under duress. Characterized by swift passages of play and fouls from both sides, including a key Espanyol shot off target at 00:45 and a clearance that followed at 02:25, the second half was relentless.\n\nA pulsating yet one-sided match saw Real making substitutions at strategic moments, particularly a noted one at 10:29, reinforcing their superiority. Espanyol, resilient but outclassed, battled on, managing a shot on target at 09:11 but failing to find the net.\n\nReal's dominance persisted, with another goal at 15:59, taking their tally to 5-0. Espanyol’s structural changes continued with more substitutions, an indication of their attempts to salvage something from the game.\n\nBy the time Real struck their sixth and final goal at 35:05, it cemented their commanding performance. Espanyol’s spirit, albeit undeterred, couldn’t match Real’s prowess, illustrated by numerous clearances and defensive tactics throughout the match.\n\nIn the end, Real delivered a masterclass in attacking football, dismantling Espanyol’s defenses repeatedly while maintaining a disciplined defense. Each goal highlighted their technical and tactical superiority, leaving Espanyol to ponder on missed opportunities and tactical reassessments. \n\nWith the referee’s final whistle drawn, Real emerged victorious with an emphatic scoreline of 6-0, a proof of their exemplary play and tactical execution, as Espanyol’s valiant efforts fell significantly short in face of a superior opponent."
