    "summary": "In a thrilling encounter at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, Real Madrid managed to scrape a 1-0 victory against a heavily resilient Granada side. The game unfolded with moments of tension, tactical ploys, and numerous stoppages, portraying the fierce competition between both teams. Let's dive into a comprehensive and detailed account of this match which kept the fans on the edge of their seats from the first to the last minute.\n\n### First Half\n\nThe referee's whistle blew, and Real Madrid initiated the kickoff, setting the game in motion. There was an early interruption as the ball went out of play at just 1 minute and 12 seconds. This was followed by a series of throw-ins and ball-outs, indicating both teams' initial struggle to gain control and establish any rhythmic play. Within the first few minutes, the ball found itself constantly wandering out of the field's boundaries, making for a fragmented start.\n\nBy the third minute, Granada committed a foul, which was swiftly followed by an indirect free-kick for Real Madrid. However, the game continued to see numerous ball-outs and throw-ins, reflective of the tight press each team was employing to disrupt the other's flow.\n\nAt the seventh minute, Granada managed their first shot, but it went off target. Real Madrid, in response, got their first corner at the ninth minute which didn’t result in a goal. Another series of throw-ins and corners ensued, with Real Madrid piling on the pressure. They got several shots on target around the 13th minute mark – their intent to break the deadlock was evident, yet Granada's defense held firm.\n\nGranada committed multiple fouls, showing their robust and aggressive approach to halt Real Madrid's advancing tactics. The first yellow card of the match came by the 34th minute against Granada, showcasing the intensity of the play.\n\nReal Madrid orchestrated several attacking plays resulting in corners and throw-ins but failed to convert in the first half. Both teams also saw bouts of offsides and clearances as they vied for dominance.\n\nGranada, although being on the back foot for most of the first half, showed glimpses of attacking prowess with shots on goal, including a notable attempt around the 24th minute. Real Madrid’s defense had its moments of vigilance against these counters.\n\nDespite their dominance in possession and several shots on target, the first half ended goalless. \n\n### Second Half\n\nGranada kicked off the second half, seeking to exert some form of control. The ball quickly found itself out of play, consistent with the first half's theme. Real Madrid came out with renewed vigor, demonstrating their intent with a shot on target in the 46th minute, putting immediate pressure on Granada.\n\nSeveral moments of fluid play were interrupted by fouls and the ball going out of play, leading to throw-ins for both sides. Real Madrid's persistence paid off when in the ninth minute of the second half, they finally found the back of the net, thanks to a clinical finish after a shot on target. A throw-in by Real Madrid just before had set up the attack which culminated in the only goal of the match.\n\nGranada resumed with the kickoff, clearly intent on finding an equalizer. The match's tempo slightly shifted as Granada became more aggressive in their push forward. Real Madrid, meanwhile, seemed more composed, managing their lead and applying pressure when necessary.\n\nSubstitution strategies came into play around the 15-minute mark of the second half, with Granada and Real Madrid making changes to inject fresh legs and different dynamics into their squad. \n\nThe latter part of the second half saw numerous attempts by Granada to level the score. They had a series of shots, some on target and others off, with Real Madrid's defense and goalkeeper staying resolute. Real Madrid also had their fair share of attempts, pushing to solidify their lead but often finding the goal elusive.\n\nFrequent fouls by Granada earned them additional yellow cards, further exacerbating their plight. Real Madrid capitalized on these free-kicks, maintaining control and momentum even though they couldn’t convert these opportunities into further goals.\n\nClearances and throw-ins continued to dominate, as both teams seemed relentless in their efforts. Real Madrid’s strategy was clear – manage the game, hold onto their lead, and disrupt Granada’s advances. The substitution tactic was again deployed by both teams in the closing stages to safeguard the game’s tempo and pressure.\n\nAs the match approached its final minutes, Granada made a last-ditch effort to salvage a point. A direct free-kick taken by Granada in the 44th minute saw a shot on target but was thwarted by Real Madrid’s diligent defense. The match concluded with Real Madrid narrowly clinching the victory.\n\n### In Conclusion\n\nThe game's solitary goal was enough to secure three points for Real Madrid. Nonetheless, Granada's doggedness demonstrated they could hold their own against the giants of Spanish football. The game’s high number of fouls and cards reflected its physical nature, where tactical fouls were as crucial as the flow of the ball itself.\n\nReal Madrid’s incessant pressure paid off in the second half, and despite multiple attempts by Granada to retaliate, they stood firm. The numerous throw-ins, corners, and goal attempts from both sides indicate a match where strategies were continually adapted, and efforts were extensive.\n\nOverall, Real Madrid's fans would be pleased with their team’s ability to edge out a victory in a tightly contested match, while Granada will rue missed opportunities and defensive lapses. This game, filled with stoppages and strategic plays, is a testament to the competitive essence of La Liga, where every touch, every clearance, and shot carries weight in the quest for league supremacy."
