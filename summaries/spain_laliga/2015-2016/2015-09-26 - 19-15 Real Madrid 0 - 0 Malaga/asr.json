Comment: Boca cannot participate in this match, which has been one of the latest injuries.\n20:49 Comment: The ball is in motion and Málaga must take the free kick again.\n20:53 Comment: Neither did Camacho, Santa Cruz and Flavio Ferreira.\n20:57 Comment: Those are the absences in Javi Gracia's team.\n21:0 Comment: Isco, Toni Kroos and Gesé.\n21:3 Comment: Now on the left side.\n21:5 Comment: Gesé runs after Pablo.\n21:7 Comment: I thought I was so focused on accelerating and maybe focused on football.\n21:12 Comment: The footballer who was coming from behind who did not notice Roberto Rosales crossing.\n21:20 Comment: How much anxiety Rubén gives off many footballers when they are looking forward to playing\n21:26 Comment: and they don't have the opportunities they would like.\n21:30 Comment: I think everyone is willing to play,\n21:31 Comment: but there are certain moments in which the player knows that he is taking a gamble,\n21:36 Comment: that it has to be done well, that it has to be liked and that it has to perform at a good level\n21:40 Comment: so that the coach continues counting on you.\n21:43 Comment: Isco.\n21:45 Comment: Benzema.\n21:46 Comment: Benzema loses the ball.\n21:47 Comment: Tizone overtakes too much.\n21:49 Comment: That makes things easier for Nacho.\n21:51 Comment: Marcelo plays.\n21:52 Comment: Isco.\n21:53 Comment: Marcellus.\n21:54 Comment: He has turned twice into the area.\n21:56 Comment: When it is decided to focus, the ball hits Rosales.\n21:59 Comment: Tizone and Roberto Rosales.\n22:4 Comment: Andravat is absolutely alone.\n22:6 Comment: Nacho was closing in there against the band.\n22:8 Comment: But Andravat, as we said before, has a lot of ability to protect the ball.\n22:12 Comment: so that he goes to support Nacho, help him steal that ball, Keylor Navas's great shot\n22:20 Comment: favors tizio ne who is then wrong cross marcelo disco and this from the right side\n22:28 Comment: has two possibilities, one is this: let her with the ball, the Christian canary is going to\n22:34 Comment: finishing area also reached above, he puts his leg in geler and split corner that every time\n22:41

keeping your face in the game of your car against Benítez Marcelo's team\n23:1 Comment: the ball is not good for this rosales pablo\n23:7 Comment: to what had joined the team\n23:10 Comment: the damnier\n23:11 Comment: of the one who was playing almost everything like Ricardo Horta who today has remained on the bench\n23:20 Comment: Marcos Angeleri Rosales Rosales towards Tiga Tunic started in situation\n23:26 Comment: Correct, the ball is finally so that the Navas who were good at Miguel\n23:34 Comment: torres now in rabat put the body in although he indicated that it was necessary to tell him gonzález at the entrance of\n23:41 Comment: Towers over Gese.\n23:45 Comment: Yeah.\n23:46 Comment: It seems that he has entered the ball strong there.\n23:49 Comment: And well, if not, it was another loss, right?\n23:51 Comment: I think we have seen a lot of losses from both Málaga and Real Madrid in the midfield.\n23:55 Comment: And that makes them vertical teams, right?\n23:58 Comment: We are seeing very little horizontal play, but rather rapid arrivals at one goal and another.\n24:5 Comment: Tizone.\n24:5 Comment: It is striking in that football that you were drawing now, like some footballers who I think feel a little alien to that way of interpreting football.\n24:16 Comment: He spoke mainly about Modric, since they are showing little weight in the game.\n24:20 Comment: What a great ball for Anrabat!\n24:21 Comment: Is about to come!\n24:23 Comment: Nordin Anrabat to Tigaduni's ball.\n24:28 Comment: Well, they speak the same language, right?\n24:30 Comment: The same football language.\n24:33 Comment: Anrabat and Tigaduni are permanently sought.\n24:35 Comment: Tigaduni.\n24:37 Comment: Luka modric.\n24:39 Comment: Modric and Carvajal.\n24:42 Comment: Gesé.\n24:46 Comment: Dani Carvajal.\n24:47 Comment: Modric.\n24:49 Comment: The Croatian international playing with Dani Carvajal.\n24:52 Comment: The ball from the side towards Kroos, who first

Rezzi's steal of the ball.\n25:5 Comment: And Anrabat puts his leg into Varane.\n25:7 Comment: Foul on Nordin Anrabat, who achieves something every time he intervenes.\n25:14 Comment: Because of its characteristics, right?\n25:15 Comment: He is a very electric player, very fast.\n25:17 Comment: You can go one way, you can go another.\n25:19 Comment: He surprises you with his game.\n25:21 Comment: It is very difficult to cover.\n25:23 Comment: The thing is that he also has Varane and Nacho, who are very fast.\n25:25 Comment: They are very fast players.\n25:26 Comment: And there, well, there are some fights that are nice for the fan.\n25:32 Comment: Anrabat, Roberto, who doesn't stop asking for things.\n25:35 Comment: Yes, now I just came from seeing water.\n25:37 Comment: He had asked for a bottle of water to cool off,\n25:40 Comment: who ended up throwing out of bounds,\n25:42 Comment: right at the height of the Real Madrid technical area.\n25:44 Comment: And Tunís, Juan Carlos, Miguel Torres doubles him.\n25:46 Comment: What this has done is sow a moment of doubt.\n25:49 Comment: and left space for Juan Carlos to center.\n25:51 Comment: Varane rising above Anrabat.\n25:53 Comment: It is made with the Rezzi ball.\n25:55 Comment: Rezzi towards Roberto Rosales.\n25:57 Comment: Malaga attacks.\n25:58 Comment: Málaga, as we said, is showing nerve, daring and good football\n26:3 Comment: in the minutes we have been in the game, which is now 26.\n26:6 Comment: Miguel Torres, Tigadunien del Ventana, Varane,\n26:8 Comment: which there provides stride to arrive with much superiority.\n26:13 Comment: And Keylor Navas sends the ball to a throw-in.\n26:17 Comment: Not for Benítez to talk to his players.\n26:21 Comment: Above all, addressing, correct me if I'm wrong, Roberto, the two center midfielders.\n26:25 Comment: Yes, yes, now directly speaking with Toni Kroos, to whom he gave instructions,\n26:28 Comment: Let's not forget, seconds before the game started,\n26:32 Comment: Rafa Benítez entering the field of play.\n26:35 Comment: The ball for Miguel Torres, Varane.\n26:37 Comment: Varane and Andrabat, Andrabat protests,\n26:40 Comment: but the fault is precisely the Málaga footballer,\n26:42 Comment: He demanded an Andrabat iron,\n26:44 Comment: but González González what he is indicating is exactly the opposite,\n26:48 Comment: the absence of the Málaga player.\n26:49 Comment: And Miguel Torres gets the yellow card for protesting.\n26:52 Comment: Miguel Torres was supporting the protests in Andrabat,\n26:54 Comment: What's happening is that he protested so close to González González's ear\n26:57 Comment: which led to him getting the yellow card.\n27:0 Comment: A dangerous option.\n27:1 Comment: There Andrabat complains that Varane, by jumping,\n27:5 Comment: has the sole of the foot,\n27:7 Comment: but well, I also think that Andrabat does not go with the interior,\n27:11 Comment: He goes to step on the ball and steps on his knee a little.\n27:18 Comment: Marcelo, Modric, Marcelo, Nacho.\n27:25 Comment: Nacho and Toni Kroos.\n27:28 Comment: The first cautioned person of the match, Miguel Torres,\n27:30 Comment: for those protests to González González, Luca Modric.\n27:35 Comment: Isco asking for the ball, he didn't see Modric.\n27:38 Comment: Marcelo, Luca Modric.\n27:41 Comment: Rosales is going to take the ball.\n27:43 Comment: Once again the problems in the circulation of the ball for Real Madrid.\n27:47 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo, Cristiano with Modric.\n27:50 Comment: Modric, Isco, no, sorry, Karim Benzema.\n27:53 Comment: Isco was waiting in the crescent of the area.\n27:56 Comment: Kroos, Kroos and Isco.\n28:1 Comment: There Málaga is being compressed,\n28:3 Comment: but Real Madrid is also compressing.\n28:5 Comment: In the end, the result of all this is that there is no space.\n28:9 Comment: Because everyone gathers in the center of the field.\n28:12 Comment: Toni Kroos was telling Isco to turn it,\n28:17 Comment: Christian with hand gesture.\n28:18 Comment: In the end, if you have ten,\n28:21 Comment: eleven is practically ten Málaga players in the center,\n28:23 Comment: and you, Cristiano gets inside, Marcelo gets inside,\n28:27 Comment: Someone has to open the field.\n28:29 Comment: I think that Real Madrid did very well in the first few minutes,\n28:32 Comment: going from side to side.\n28:33 Comment: That's what you have to keep doing\n28:34 Comment: and also have advantages.\n28:37 Comment: Rubén from the network said it in the previous one,\n28:40 Comment: It is true that Málaga has not yet scored a goal\n28:42 Comment: so far in the league,\n28:44 Comment: but it is also true that he has only conceded three\n28:46 Comment: and one has done it at his own door.\n28:48 Comment: I mean, this team does things well.\n28:50 Comment: His position in the table is what it is, he only has two points,\n28:54 Comment: but it is by no means a team that is letting go at all.\n28:58 Comment: He is fighting every match,\n29:0 Comment: but he is missing that dose of fortune that in the end is vital.\n29:3 Comment: Dani Carvajal, who is in the first,\n29:5 Comment: and he just got a good ball.\n29:6 Comment: Christian with a header, Gellerich arrived from behind.\n29:9 Comment: He did not touch the Argentine,\n29:10 Comment: Cristiano's header simply went wide.\n29:13 Comment: It's over there, with those types of centers\n29:16 Comment: and with the arrival of Benzema and Cristiano,\n29:18 Comment: like Real Madrid is transmitting more of a sense of danger.\n29:22 Comment: Dani Carvajal touched the ball,\n29:24 Comment: He also ended up grappling and knocking down Juan Carlos.\n29:27 Comment: Kroos, Modric, Benzema, Luka Modric, Toni Kroos,\n29:35 Comment: Kroos towards Gesé, and Gesé who comes into play,\n29:37 Comment: You already have the ball under control, Gesé.\n29:39 Comment: He looked for the center toward his teammates in the area, hitting Torres.\n29:45 Comment: Those types of plays are the ones that Real Madrid has to influence the most, right?\n29:48 Comment: It starts on the left side and in the end the play ends with Gesé,\n29:52 Comment: which is open practically alone.\n29:56 Comment: So far Modric has launched everything,\n29:57 Comment: Now the one who takes the corner is Toni Kroos,\n29:59 Comment: ball that is dangerous, but in which in the end Kameni ends up imposing his law.\n30:5 Comment: And capturing that ball, half an hour into the game, 0-0.\n30:12 Comment: Javi Gracia and Benítez that, if it were possible and if they were allowed, Roberto,\n30:17 Comment: have a megaphone, they would have it to tell everything they want to tell their footballers.\n30:22 Comment: Especially in the case of Rafa Benítez, who is screaming,\n30:25 Comment: trying to give directions to his people.\n30:27 Comment: Javi Gracia still stands idly by,\n30:30 Comment: with a slightly calmer attitude,\n30:32 Comment: but Rafa Benítez is very intense,\n30:34 Comment: and he is doing it with points.\n30:36 Comment: He takes the ball to Isco, the ball to Cristiano.\n30:39 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo entering as a right winger.\n30:42 Comment: Cristiano's tempered ball.\n30:44 Comment: Isco sees how he anticipates Rosales,\n30:46 Comment: Benzema takes the ball from Isco, offside.\n30:53 Comment: The flag raised, the indication of González González's assistant.\n30:59 Comment: I don't know if it's something momentary,\n31:3 Comment: Luka Modric is falling to the left side.\n31:5 Comment: Rubén has joined the Isco double pivot alongside Kroos,\n31:8 Comment: But I insist, I don't know if it is something specific or if it will continue.\n31:11 Comment: We already saw in San Mamés, even Benítez later commented on it,\n31:14 Comment: As within the match, Real Madrid changed their tactical scheme quite a few times\n31:18 Comment: throughout the evolution of the meeting.\n31:20 Comment: Yeah.\n31:21 Comment: Well, I think he's going to continue in the center of the field, right?\n31:24 Comment: It has been something sporadic.\n31:26 Comment: Benzema's ball for Gesé to receive.\n31:28 Comment: Gesé, who is the one who will continue in the center of the field.\n31:30 Comment: It's a ball goal.\n31:32 Comment: Andrabat's ball, which breaks from one side to the other.\n31:34 Comment: He leaves Pablo, finds the baseline, puts the ball back.\n31:37 Comment: And there the one who ends up becoming the dominator of the area is Wellington.\n31:42 Comment: Nordin Andrabat and Nacho.\n31:44 Comment: Andrabat takes the ball.\n31:47 Comment: His partner is already waiting, his partner is Tig Aduni.\n31:50 Comment: Nordin Andrabat continues.\n31:51 Comment: The fight with Nacho again.\n31:53 Comment: Andrabat's ball arriving at the far post.\n31:56 Comment: Juan Carlos.\n31:58 Comment: And the shot at the end that ended the goal kick.\n32:2 Comment: Málaga is very clear about it.\n32:4 Comment: He knows what he wants.\n32:5 Comment: He knows how to get it.\n32:7 Comment: And while Nordin Andrabat's gasoline lasts,\n32:10 Comment: Real Madrid is going to have problems.\n32:13 Comment: Christian.\n32:14 Comment: Modric.\n32:16 Comment: Modric, Gesé.\n32:18 Comment: Rosales.\n32:20 Comment: Once again Gesé is waiting, opening up for the shot.\n32:23 Comment: Kameni.\n32:25 Comment: Play with your right hand.\n32:27 Comment: A low ball that sneaked into Brack Corner.\n32:30 Comment: Yes, good.\n32:32 Comment: Gesé is seeing that he is being important.\n32:35 Comment: He has already done two one against one.\n32:37 Comment: He has entered the area.\n32:39 Comment: He has participated on the right wing.\n32:41 Comment: He is one of the most active at Real Madrid.\n32:44 Comment: Another different pitcher at Real Madrid.\n32:46 Comment: Now it's Isco.\n32:47 Comment: Isco's ball.\n32:48 Comment: Gesé's auction.\n32:50 Comment: And again Kameni was very quick to react.\n32:52 Comment: Just like the defender has been.\n32:57 Comment: And we see how he manages to end up sending the ball.\n33:2 Comment: Out, corner kick.\n33:4 Comment: Roberto Rosales.\n33:10 Comment: Isco is going to launch again.\n33:12 Comment: Come to Carlos Kameni.\n33:14 Comment: Good goalkeeper.\n33:16 Comment: With maturity, experience and great level between the sticks as he is showing today.\n33:24 Comment: Anrabat.\n33:26 Comment: Luka modric.\n33:28 Comment: There, hindering Nordin Anrabat's evolution as much as possible.\n33:31 Comment: Wellington.\n33:33 Comment: Wellington who failed to pass and almost accidentally played with Tigaduni.\n33:37 Comment: Miguel Torres.\n33:39 Comment: Juan Carlos.\n33:40 Comment: Juan Carlos and Nordin Anrabat.\n33:43 Comment: Miguel Torres.\n33:47 Comment: The ball has come out.\n33:48 Comment: Pablo Fornals arrives when the ball has crossed the side line.\n33:53 Comment: Let's see, Rafa Benítez quite, I don't know whether to say angry, but at the least intense.\n33:58 Comment: Asking Nacho to be more forceful.\n34:1 Comment: When deciding to come out from the center of defense to stop a rival player.\n34:5 Comment: Let's say that Nacho is having the most difficult matchup.\n34:10 Comment: Anrabat is tending to fall more towards the side where Nacho is located.\n34:14 Comment: And many times Nacho also finds himself in a one-on-one situation.\n34:18 Comment: Yes, it's difficult, isn't it?\n34:20 Comment: Having one on one with Anrabat, well he has to have Varane's help, right?\n34:25 Comment: Because we see that Marcelo and Carvajal are helping in the attack.\n34:29 Comment: And it is important that a midfield player is watching.\n34:34 Comment: Miguel Torres.\n34:37 Comment: Juan Carlos is going to steal Carvajal.\n34:40 Comment: Carvajal changes pace, leaves Tizón and plays with Cristiano.\n34:43 Comment: Cristiano goes towards the area, calls Sescorado, takes the left foot.\n34:46 Comment: Carlos Cameni and Angeleri.\n34:50 Comment: Real Madrid is accumulating arrivals, but needs to resolve in the end.\n34:56 Comment: And the game is beautiful.\n34:58 Comment: And it's nice because both teams are really trying.\n35:1 Comment: Yes, it is being an uncomfortable match for Real Madrid.\n35:4 Comment: Because Málaga, with the turnovers they have had, is causing danger to the counterattack.\n35:9 Comment: But at the same time, Real Madrid is having many chances.\n35:12 Comment: The corner, Toni Kroos.\n35:14 Comment: Christian who does not move forward.\n35:16 Comment: A little Anrabat.\n35:18 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo's lamentations.\n35:21 Comment: Marcellus.\n35:23 Comment: Dani Carvajal.\n35:25 Comment: Real Madrid is ordered. Málaga does the same.\n35:28 Comment: They are left behind closing Nacho Ibarán.\n35:30 Comment: The real Madrid.\n35:32 Comment: The Málaga that sets up there.\n35:34 Comment: Those two lines of four with two men ahead, which are Tigadouni and Nordinan Ramaz.\n35:38 Comment: Gesse.\n35:40 Comment: A couple of breaks.\n35:41 Comment: Namago.\n35:42 Comment: Then the center goes without force to the area where Recio takes it.\n35:45 Comment: A note a little aside from this game, but current news of the day.\n35:51 Comment: From FC Barcelona without official form that Messi has.\n35:54 Comment: Rupture in the internal collateral ligament of the left knee and his time out will be seven to eight weeks.\n36:1 Comment: With which he would arrive very fair in the best of cases to the Classic against Real Madrid.\n36:6 Comment: It is a significant injury.\n36:8 Comment: Thanks Roberto.\n36:9 Comment: Obviously it is sad news that conditions the day.\n36:15 Comment: Ligo Messi's injury.\n36:17 Comment: We have said it previously and we repeat it now, especially for those who may be a little susceptible.\n36:23 Comment: The worst thing and the sadness that it generates for all of us who live around the world of football is talking about injuries.\n36:29 Comment: It is by far the most unpleasant thing.\n36:31 Comment: Obviously Messi is not just any player.\n36:35 Comment: Two months out for the Argentine footballer from FC Barcelona.\n36:39 Comment: The ball for Juan Carlos.\n36:41 Comment: Juan Carlos takes a center with too much force.\n36:45 Comment: But time and again Málaga is getting things right with Juan Carlos.\n36:50 Comment: And with Ramaz of course with Tigadouni.\n36:53 Comment: Go out with danger.\n36:55 Comment: Get centers.\n36:57 Comment: It is true that many times not too precise.\n37:0 Comment: But they are forcing constant defensive work from Real Madrid's centre-backs.\n37:6 Comment: Strong.\n37:8 Comment: Varane.\n37:10 Comment: Miguel Torres.\n37:12 Comment: Varane.\n37:14 Comment: Dani Carvajal.\n37:16 Comment: Carvajal towards Keylor Navas.\n37:20 Comment: Nacho.\n37:23 Comment: Marcellus.\n37:25 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo.\n37:30 Comment: Marcellus.\n37:32 Comment: Luka modric.\n37:34 Comment: What is certain is that if Real Madrid Rubén does not manage to give speed to the ball.\n37:38 Comment: We are seeing that Málaga works like an accordion.\n37:41 Comment: It moves in unison and with very well-worked movements.\n37:45 Comment: Yes, Málaga has two lines of four very close together that close the center very well.\n37:49 Comment: And Real Madrid is lacking breadth.\n37:52 Comment: Pablo puts towards the center.\n37:54 Comment: Tigadouni.\n37:55 Comment: Varane.\n37:56 Comment: And at the end Keylor Navas.\n37:58 Comment: Málaga continues to dig into the same wound.\n38:2 Comment: Steal, run and take advantage of the speed of your men above.\n38:7 Comment: Wellington anticipates Cristiano.\n38:9 Comment: The ball reaches Toni Kroos.\n38:11 Comment: Kroos and Luka Modric.\n38:13 Comment: We are already at minute 38.\n38:15 Comment: Nothing changes, nothing moves, nothing is altered.\n38:17 Comment: 0-0.\n38:18 Comment: Modric.\n38:20 Comment: The Croatian.\n38:22 Comment: Towards Gesé.\n38:23 Comment: Let's see what he's looking for.\n38:24 Comment: It is a very strong center.\n38:26 Comment: Cristiano who wanted to bend that ball, but it was at least impossible.\n38:32 Comment: Yes, Gesé is telling him that it wasn't going for him, that he was going for the far post.\n38:36 Comment: That's why he was so strong.\n38:38 Comment: And well, Cristiano saw it there and finished off.\n38:42 Comment: It was not expected that it would go to another colleague.\n38:48 Comment: Take out Kameni.\n38:51 Comment: Tiga Duní.\n38:53 Comment: The Moroccan player's ball for Fernando Tissone.\n38:58 Comment: Tiga Duní did not accompany.\n39:0 Comment: Tissone shouts at him.\n39:2 Comment: There Tiga Duní had to be a little in the Argentine footballer's mind.\n39:8 Comment: Anticipate that pass into space.\n39:10 Comment: No, at the beginning of the play he unmarks him.\n39:13 Comment: The only thing he then sees is that Varane is very fast and stops.\n39:16 Comment: But he does the unchecking.\n39:18 Comment: Dani Carvajal.\n39:20 Comment: Carvajal.\n39:22 Comment: Gesé.\n39:24 Comment: Carvajal.\n39:26 Comment: It's a 2 for 2.\n39:28 Comment: Carvajal, Gesé and before them Juan Carlos and Miguel Torres.\n39:32 Comment: So it's the same, four players raised on this team.\n39:36 Comment: From the Real Madrid quarry.\n39:38 Comment: Dani Carvajal will take out.\n39:42 Comment: He has to do it back for Varane.\n39:49 Comment: Nacho Walloon.\n39:51 Comment: Marcellus.\n39:53 Comment: Luka modric.\n39:55 Comment: Modric towards Dani Carvajal.\n39:57 Comment: The ball moves from side to side.\n39:59 Comment: But Málaga also swings perfectly.\n40:1 Comment: Gesé and Miguel Torres.\n40:3 Comment: Miguel Torres throws himself to the ground.\n40:5 Comment: Corner kick.\n40:7 Comment: Yes, but even if Málaga swings, in the end, if Real Madrid is able to circulate more times as it is doing now, it is creating the opportunity for a 1 on 1 against Gesé.\n40:13 Comment: Gesé has a good chance of scoring a goal.\n40:15 Comment: But it's not like that.\n40:17 Comment: We have seen that he has gone from the left side twice and entered the area.\n40:19 Comment: On the right side it is the same.\n40:21 Comment: Toni Kroos, the corner.\n40:23 Comment: Kameni, very confident so far.\n40:25 Comment: Obviously Real Madrid without Pepe Sergio Ramos.\n40:27 Comment: He loses a lot of his aerial power in this type of play.\n40:29 Comment: Rosales.\n40:31 Comment: Andrabat.\n40:33 Comment: Strong.\n40:37 Comment: That he got into the Wolf's mouth.\n40:39 Comment: He lost the ball.\n40:41 Comment: But it's not a goal.\n40:43 Comment: But it's a goal.\n40:45 Comment: That he got into the Wolf's mouth.\n40:47 Comment: He lost the ball.\n40:49 Comment: Real Madrid's loss is almost immediate.\n40:51 Comment: Dani Carvajal.\n40:53 Comment: The ball is left behind.\n40:55 Comment: That gives facilities to Antigua Duní.\n40:57 Comment: Again Antigua Duní.\n40:59 Comment: How good the feint to the side to then come out with the ball and let Toni Kroos pass by.\n41:3 Comment: Nordin Andrabat.\n41:5 Comment: Andrabat Center.\n41:7 Comment: Juan Carlos is about to arrive.\n41:9 Comment: Juan Carlos ended up colliding with Keylor Navas.\n41:13 Comment: But I think it stopped the movement of the leg.\n41:17 Comment: Otherwise, we would be talking about a much stronger blow.\n41:21 Comment: The one who has played the worst is Juan Carlos.\n41:23 Comment: It seems to me that precisely the fact of having stopped the movement, the impact,\n41:29 Comment: It may have caused some type of problem beyond what the impact would have been.\n41:34 Comment: In fact, the support foot after the jump remains a little stuck.\n41:37 Comment: There it extends.\n41:39 Comment: But I think he complains about his neck.\n41:41 Comment: We see how in the fall.\n41:43 Comment: He hits his head on the ground.\n41:45 Comment: He falls a little uncoordinated, uncontrolled.\n41:48 Comment: Keylor Navas falls to the side.\n41:51 Comment: Juan Carlos towards the other.\n41:53 Comment: As Rubén de la Red says, it seems that the main problem is in the cervical area.\n41:59 Comment: There you see, he hits the back of his head right on the ground.\n42:1 Comment: A strong blow.\n42:3 Comment: Juan Carlos is being assisted.\n42:6 Comment: There is no reason for alarm.\n42:10 Comment: I turn upside down.\n42:13 Comment: It seems that even Juan Carlos is a little dizzy.\n42:17 Comment: But already up and ready to return to the game shortly.\n42:24 Comment: Keylor Navas plays.\n42:27 Comment: Marcellus.\n42:30 Comment: Modric.\n42:33

    "summary": "The Santiago Bernabéu was brimming with energy and anticipation as Real Madrid squared off against Málaga on a fine evening. Both teams were keenly aware of the importance of their performance, with Real Madrid aiming to maintain their momentum at the top of the league and Málaga eager for a resurgence amidst a challenging start to their campaign.\n\nThe game kicked off with Málaga having the initial possession. From the onset, it was clear that they intended to challenge Real Madrid's assertion over the game. The early exchanges saw Málaga players such as Marroquín, Nordin Amrabat, and Tigadouni, engaging in intricate passing and trying to establish rhythm. Though the intensity from Málaga was noteworthy, they were cautious not to overextend, well aware of the counter-attacking prowess of their opponents.\n\nReal Madrid, on the other hand, gradually settled into their customary park-and-play strategy, which was meticulously orchestrated by Toni Kroos and Luka Modric, ensuring the circulation of the ball while searching for openings. The starting lineup for Real Madrid saw Isco making an appearance, looking to impress against his former club, Málaga.\n\nThe first clear attempt at goal came regretfully to wasted efforts. Marcelo and Dani Carvajal frequently marauded forward, stretching the play wide and swinging in crosses aimed at Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo. However, Málaga's defense, marshaled by Angeleri and Wellington, stood resolute, clearing threats consistently and frustrating Real Madrid’s frontline.\n\nIn the first half, as the minutes ticked by, chances were sporadic yet charged with tension. One instance saw Luka Modric deliver a corner kick, only for Málaga's defense to get ahead and head it clear. The tenacity in the defensive third was evident, and Fernando Tissone particularly shone with well-timed interceptions. Repeatedly, Isco and Ronaldo attempted to break through Málaga’s compact defensive structure but found it challenging to convert possession into clear-cut opportunities.\n\nDespite Real Madrid's pressing, Keylor Navas had moments to ensure he wasn’t a mere spectator. He pulled off crucial interventions, such as a headed clearance aimed at the onrushing Málaga forwards, ensuring the scoreline's equilibrium.\n\nOne of the notable confrontations was between Marcelo and Málaga's Pablo Fornals, resulting in a corner after Marcelo's effort to penetrate down the flank. The corner yielded nothing tangible for the home side, further emphasizing Málaga's defensive discipline. On other fronts, Amrabat’s physicality was telling, as he smartly used his frame to shield the ball against Nacho and Varane, creating space for counter-attacks when necessary.\n\nThe tactical approach by Málaga was clever and brave; they did not merely park the bus but also looked to exploit moments. A highlight of their intent was Andrabat’s ambitious long-range attempt, parried away robustly by Navas. The signs of determination were reflected both in defensive and offensive engagements alike.\n\nAs the teams broke for the half time, the scoreboard remained idle at 0-0 but the narrative of the match was rich with duels, tactics, and palpable tension.\n\nRejuvenated after the break, Real Madrid returned with a sharpened focus. They immediately sought to tilt the balance, and an early intervention saw Dani Carvajal forcing a save that reemphasized Kameni's brilliance between the posts. Kameni’s performance was outstanding. He was not just reactive but proactive, reading the game's tempo and positioning himself to anticipate Real Madrid's numerous threats.\n\nVarane and Nacho’s coordination was relentless, yet Málaga’s offense, spearheaded by Amrabat, continued probing with tenacity. The duel between Andrabat and Varane stood out not just for its physicality but for its tactical nuance. Real Madrid's midfield axis saw deeper involvement as Kovačić added fresh legs and energy after Gesé’s unfortunate injury, a blow that cast a somber note on the proceedings.\n\nDespite racking up scores of shots and corners, including numerous efforts from Cristiano Ronaldo, the breakthrough remained elusive. Every Real Madrid offensive wave that reached the final third was instantly met with resilient defending by Málaga. Miguel Torres, former Real Madrid player himself, played his part impeccably, blocking shots, making crucial clearances, and maintaining a high line when required.\n\nThe match grew more intense with Real Madrid further amping up their attacking resolve. Marcelo and Carvajal, as expected, maintained their advanced positions, continuously pumping crosses into the box, all aimed at either Ronaldo or Benzema. Yet, Kameni's goalkeeping was both unyielding and inspiring. His most significant save perhaps was the reflex save from Ronaldo's powerful strike, which kept the game goal-less and displayed his exceptional reflexes and poise under pressure.\n\nAs much as Real Madrid multiplied their attempts, Málaga’s tactical astuteness did not waver. When Real Madrid looked close to scoring, Málaga’s counter-punches were deft and dangerous, with Amrabat's speed and strength proving a constant bother. The latter stages saw Luka Modric trying to thread intricate balls into the attacking third, but Wellington and Angeleri’s interceptions continued, preserving Málaga’s hopes.\n\nFor all the tension and action, the dramatic apex of the second half struck when Amrabat, Málaga's livewire, was shown a red card for an off-the-ball incident. His dismissal indeed added a grim twist to the final minutes; Málaga was now not only defending but had to do so with a man down.\n\nReal Madrid’s desperate search for a goal saw Varane pushed forward, symbolizing their all-hands-on-deck approach. The closing moments were dramatic with Marcelo's aerial crosses met fervently by defenders, clearing off the line and blocking critical efforts. Despite the frenetic attacking efforts, punctuated by Ronaldo’s raised arms and looks to the sky, the stalemated scoreboard bore testimony to Málaga’s rugged defense and Kameni’s elite goalkeeping prowess.\n\nThe final whistle echoed around the Bernabéu, sealing a draw that felt like a win for Málaga and a significant missed opportunity for Real Madrid. While Benitez’s men had dominated proceedings with a barrage of attacks, Málaga’s meticulously executed game plan reaped them a valuable point. The match underscored the inveterate competitiveness and drama that La Liga offers, showcasing both craft and resilience in abundance. The goalless draw, despite not yielding a scoring bonanza, was rich in tactical battles and offered insights into the staunch determination of both teams."
