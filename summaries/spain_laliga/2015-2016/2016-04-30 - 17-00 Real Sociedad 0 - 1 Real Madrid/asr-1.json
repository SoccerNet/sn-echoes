It never reached Gareth Bale either\n29:14 Comment: The real Miquel González stole\n29:16 Comment: It was easier for James to pass to Bale with his right foot\n29:20 Comment: But he opted for his good leg and that has forced the passing situation a lot\n29:26 Comment: Like they did in Manchester, right?\n29:27 Comment: Lucas Bájez has already come to the right wing and Gareth Bale to the left\n29:30 Comment: Sapermutak has also performed at the Etihad\n29:33 Comment: Yes, because, well, they can do it perfectly\n29:36 Comment: Lucas, above all, has had more mobility than Bale\n29:39 Comment: Now they have been there, there is a time where Bale is playing more to the left and Lucas more to the right\n29:45 Comment: Lucas, who tries to control the ball, finally does it in two moments\n29:47 Comment: Júri went over braking, Lucas continues\n29:50 Comment: Lucas Bájez inside the area, he wanted to blow, contrary\n29:52 Comment: He couldn't handle three men who were there waiting for him in a staggered manner\n29:59 Comment: Brma that runs out of field, the ball for Zinedine Zidane\n30:2 Comment: Although they are going to take the throw with another ball, Danilo is going to do it\n30:6 Comment: How is the game going on the grass area, Roberto?\n30:9 Comment: Well, the clearest example has been this one from Zidane in this play\n30:12 Comment: How the Real Madrid coach has been quick and ready to stop that ball\n30:15 Comment: And that their team could play with speed\n30:18 Comment: The truth is that both benches seem satisfied with the pace the game is taking\n30:23 Comment: Match in which Casemiro now plays, dominating the ball\n30:27 Comment: Yes, now at 30 minutes, Real Sociedad has taken off the pace of Real Madrid that it had a little bit\n30:35 Comment: That he wouldn't let him go past midfield\n30:37 Comment: Real Sociedad, even with two strategic players, has already passed\n30:40 Comment: And it has already created some danger for the public\n30:43 Comment: He has also become a little happier because until now he was a little waiting for Real Sociedad to do something more\n30:48 Comment: Real Madrid wants to clearly dominate the game again, Lucas Bázquez\n30:52 Comment: Danilo accompanies him, Lucas continues, he goes to the ground, there is no set piece for Zinedine Zidane's team\n30:57 Comment: He was very close to Undiano, he did not hesitate to call that foul\n31:1 Comment: The centre-backs logically raise Ramos and Barán\n31:4 Comment: Yes, James is going to score, I imagine that from there he will put a cross where the penalty spot is\n31:10 Comment: He has the ball inside with his left foot\n31:12 Comment: And well, Real Madrid has a lot of height and we have already seen that before\n31:16 Comment: We have caused danger there, it has caused danger to Real Madrid with both Bale and Ramos\n31:22 Comment: And they are both situated there again, ready to attempt the shot\n31:28 Comment: Also Barán, also Casemiro who is a good header, was about to score by the way at the Etihad Casemiro\n31:34 Comment: And also Borja Mayoral, a lot of power in Real Madrid's aerial game\n31:38 Comment: And Real Sociedad is also scoring in the zone\n31:40 Comment: There goes James Rodríguez's shipment, it doesn't reach enough height to overcome the first obstacle, the Colombian didn't make it\n31:46 Comment: Danilo's header, Danilo will have an advantage there, again\n31:53 Comment: Head touch from Sergio Ramos, Borja Mayoral that was not offside\n31:58 Comment: Yes, Bale was there, but Bale did not intervene in the play, Borja Mayoral was missing\n32:3 Comment: Well, there... but hey, it's better that it's because of excess, than because I don't want to go\n32:11 Comment: But there the player was already very forced, he has to try but not need it\n32:16 Comment: Because the ball that the defender was going to get out of there was either out or it was a very forced defensive pass\n32:26 Comment: Get Jerónimo Rulli out now\n32:31 Comment: Ball played in the central circle, left behind by Gareth Bale's head\n32:35 Comment: The cut that James makes ahead is Borja Mayoral\n32:38 Comment: The ball is to the left wing, Gareth Bale can cross with his leg, well Bale's delivery is not as precise as the play needed\n32:46 Comment: No, he put it too much outside, it should have been more inside\n32:50 Comment: Let's see that exit now from Real\n32:53 Comment: He tried to control Zurutuz, it was very difficult, he tried but he couldn't achieve it\n32:59 Comment: Zurutuz came in very well here, he broke the offside very well because there was a Real Sociedad player there who was offside\n33:5 Comment: But he stopped and he ran into the race and if a control was made it would have been a very difficult move for Real Madrid\n33:12 Comment: James' opening, leaving Gareth Bale, Casemiro there\n33:18 Comment: Change of game, Casemiro tried, it didn't work out very well in this case\n33:23 Comment: Ball given away and that is the attempt at control coming from behind Zurutuz\n33:29 Comment: In Real's previous play in attack or counterattack\n33:33 Comment: And Real Madrid go forward to the lines to force the throw-in to try to steal the ball there in the Real Sociedad field\n33:41 Comment: Yuri throws bags, he tried to control Zurutuz with his chest\n33:48 Comment: Yuri, play Barán, play Illa-Ramendi again now head to Barán\n33:52 Comment: The siege for Sergio Ramos, Ramos delays Keylor because he was coming to Bruma\n33:57 Comment: He takes out Navas, he passed the ball over Gareth Bale\n34:3 Comment: Arriche Lustando's shot, Casemiro's touch, Casemiro permanently well placed\n34:12 Comment: Casemiro was not fine with this shipment in this case either\n34:16 Comment: And the transfer of Yuri's head to Jerónimo Rulli\n34:19 Comment: Zidane now conveyed to Casemiro, precisely some peace of mind since this play, as you have seen, did not end as desired.\n34:25 Comment: To the Real Madrid midfielder\n34:28 Comment: Now it is Real that is encouraged to go up, Sergio Ramos is crossing\n34:32 Comment: Sergio Ramos finally takes the ball and there is a foul in favor of Real Madrid\n34:37 Comment: This is the typical play that Real Sociedad likes a lot, linking and then entering from one wing or the other\n34:42 Comment: What happened is that there were no people at the auction if they were able to shoot the center\n34:46 Comment: And Real Sociedad has not been able to find this until now because Real Madrid is playing very well\n34:50 Comment: But Real Sociedad has not found itself yet, it is trying, it is looking for it but I think it has not yet found its game in these 35 minutes\n34:59 Comment: Although the level has been raised a little more and possibly Madrid no longer has the possession they had so much in the first 20 minutes\n35:7 Comment: Because the chances he has made have gone down a lot\n35:11 Comment: Casemiro, the imprecise pass, Casemiro's mistake now, cover for the center\n35:17 Comment: The ball for Modric, it turned well, Luka Modric, asphalt\n35:21 Comment: Surely card\n35:24 Comment: The first of the game with that action by Asiri Yarramendi\n35:29 Comment: Yes, especially because he has done it very shamelessly, he has grabbed Modric, he has done it repeatedly and of course, logically it does not let him progress and it is a card\n35:40 Comment: For former Madrid player Asiri Yarramendi\n35:42 Comment: Modric made a very good control and in that same control Yarramendi went over and he turned him with his body and it went towards the Real Sociedad goal\n35:53 Comment: Modric has already played, combining with Casemiro, he is behind with Rafael Varane\n35:59 Comment: He delays the central Galo, he does it for Keiro Navas\n36:3 Comment: It's still 0-0\n36:5 Comment: Already starting the final sprint of the first half, in the ninth Real Sociedad\n36:9 Comment: The foul that Marquer Vergara has received now\n36:12 Comment: Yes, Modric raised his foot, I think he whistled for a player there\n36:17 Comment: There we see it, in that repetition, the clear lack of the Croatian international\n36:27 Comment: Yarramendi is going to play\n36:30 Comment: Yes, he can't find anyone\n36:33 Comment: Especially at the top there was not much movement on the part of Real Sociedad\n36:38 Comment: He leaned on ustondo and then thought that Zaldúa was closer, Real Sociedad gave the ball away as now they can give it away, they give it away\n36:45 Comment: Real Madrid recovered Zurutuza\n36:48 Comment: Casemiro's defensive work helping Ramos\n36:51 Comment: Zurutuza against Varane\n36:54 Comment: The defenses are already repositioning themselves, the center is in the middle\n36:56 Comment: Casemiro helping Ramos, there goes Zurutuza against Varane\n37:1 Comment: Real Madrid are now repositioning their defenses\n37:4 Comment: Many troops go down to defend, but Real continues to dominate, with a back\n37:8 Comment: With Xavi in ​​the heel finally, no, the good one\n37:13 Comment: De Zaldúa\n37:14 Comment: I think several Real players were looking for the center\n37:18 Comment: He has already recovered\n37:21 Comment: Illa Ramendi played imprecisely, she gave the ball away\n37:25 Comment: He had two chances to look for a cross, because now, on this occasion he did have players to look for the shot\n37:32 Comment: However, they continued to link the play and logically Real Madrid recomposed themselves and forced the ball situation back again.\n37:42 Comment: And hence the pass of the latter who has already gone out\n37:45 Comment: Keylor Navas door bag\n37:48 Comment: And it is missing\n37:50 Comment: In favor of Eusebio Sakristan's team\n37:57 Comment: La Real is in no hurry to get anything out of this, but La Real is coming a little bit ahead\n38:3 Comment: It is not the same Real that started the game, no, now it is more established in the field and it is not the same Real\n38:10 Comment: And it gives more of a sense of danger, even though he hasn't shot the goal, but he is already hovering around the Real Madrid area many times more than before.\n38:17 Comment: Well, there goes the ball again over the area, over the edge, Ramos' jump, Sergio Ramos cleared it\n38:22 Comment: Another central defender, he clears but it goes in a balloon to Mikel González\n38:27 Comment: Gareth Bale won from above\n38:29 Comment: Director of the ball for James, behind the Colombian Bale, starting from the corner\n38:33 Comment: Mikel González, Gareth Bale won\n38:36 Comment: Director of the ball for James, behind the Colombian Bale, starting from the central zone, Oveil has to pass to the right, he gives it to Danilo\n38:43 Comment: There Danilo receives in good condition, Danilo with his left foot, he wanted to shoot, he actually shot, but it didn't go well at all\n38:49 Comment: Alex of Loporto\n38:51 Comment: Spherical for Yuri\n38:54 Comment: Looking for Bruma, the advantage for Varane, Varane directs the ball to Lucas Vázquez's area\n39:0 Comment: Manel Gallego hit him\n39:2 Comment: Attentive Modric, Modric's recovery, they rely on Lucas Vázquez\n39:7 Comment: It has little space, but a lot of ability\n39:9 Comment: Then he didn't combine well with Danilo, they didn't coordinate\n39:13 Comment: The ball for David Zurutuza\n39:17 Comment: Zurutuza substitution, Bruma, offside\n39:21 Comment: There I think that Lucas here has already sinned a little bit of the ball, too much ball\n39:27 Comment: I think he should have given the ball because the Real Sociedad players were surrounding him\n39:31 Comment: And it was very difficult for me to leave that area\n39:36 Comment: And I don't want to forget, of course, to thank Real Sociedad once again for how easy it is to work with this club.\n39:43 Comment: I enjoyed it in the Champions League for a couple of seasons traveling with them, with this club and thanks to Luis Arconada Jr.\n39:48 Comment: Be careful, Madrid can score on that ball, they have it, they have it, they have it, they have it, they have it, they have it, they don't have it\n39:53 Comment: Finally, he doesn't have it\n39:55 Comment: He doesn't have it and it's going to be yellow for Gareth Bale\n40:0 Comment: How he put together the play electrically there in Real Madrid, but an opportunity that went to limbo\n40:6 Comment: Nacho made a great play, a great penetration down the left wing\n40:10 Comment: He shot well, I think it was the goalkeeper and then the rebound could have stayed there\n40:16 Comment: But the defense has been ready, here we see the play, how it comes very well\n40:20 Comment: He shoots it out, the defender takes it out with his thigh, with the lower part of his thigh\n40:26 Comment: And then that ball that stayed there a little bit in the air and they wanted to go in to finish because they arrived a little bit later\n40:31 Comment: And Bale arrived there a little later\n40:34 Comment: And therefore it cost the Welshman the yellow card\n40:41 Comment: I didn't explain it to him, because of that gesture he didn't agree with the card that Luka Modric showed him one day, it doesn't matter\n40:51 Comment: Casemiro's jump with Ollarzabal left Bruma behind and did well for Zurutuza\n40:56 Comment: Last minutes of the first half with this 0-0\n40:59 Comment: Brma with Ollarzabal, squad to the wing, what a trick Ollarzabal made to direct the ball to Bruma\n41:5 Comment:

heads in, trouble now for Real Madrid, Real returns to the charge\n41:22 Comment: Nacho was very firm, he relies on Gareth Bale\n41:26 Comment: The start for James, Bale already starting on Real Sociedad ground to the Bale ground\n41:35 Comment: And that is also a foul with a yellow card for Markel Bergara\n41:39 Comment: Well, it's the fifth, which means he will miss Real Sociedad's next match, which is to host Rayo Vallecano.\n41:48 Comment: For this action that we see repeated for that foul against Gareth Bale\n41:59 Comment: The new set piece for Real Madrid\n42:2 Comment: Who

You got there with everything, Zaldúa\n44:3 Comment: In the best play by Real Sociedad by far in this first half\n44:8 Comment: That ended with that deflected shot, yes, but Zaldúa's shot\n44:12 Comment: After this great combination of Real\n44:15 Comment: Yes, and the one who is in the most danger is Zorutuza\n44:19 Comment: He is playing, throwing very well, he is the one who has the most presence near the area\n44:24 Comment: And when he has the ball he plays it with a lot of discretion\n44:28 Comment: Lucas looking for Borja Mayoral\n44:31 Comment: Now the young forward enters through that right sector\n44:34 Comment: Canterano, Borja Mayoral to Lucas, Vázquez enters Lucas\n44:39 Comment: And there Zaldúa pivoted very well to clear, anticipating Bale, corner kick\n44:44 Comment: James seems to have problems since this last play\n44:47 Comment: Since he returned from his area to arrive, stepping hard now he is crouching\n44:51 Comment: It must be something in the foot because it's down there and it's hitting the cepe\n44:56 Comment: With your foot it must be a stomp or something similar\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: The minutes go by and they will be against Real Madrid. The second half started as Roberto said\n0:5 Comment: Sincambio, I remember the eleven, Real Sociedad, Rulli, Zaldúa, El Ustondo, Miquel, Yuri, Vergara,\n0:10 Comment: Illa, Ramendi, Zurutuza, Prieto, Brumao, Yarzaba, Real Madrid, Navas, Danilo, Varane, Ramos, Nacho,\n0:15 Comment: Casemiro, Modric, James, Bale, Vázquez, Mayoral. By the way, at the start of the second half\n0:21 Comment: Bale starts on the left where he finished the second half and therefore Vázquez on the right\n0:27 Comment: where the second half ended. They started the game just the other way around. Throw-in for him\n0:33 Comment: Zinedine Zidane's team, which is always evidently the location of the team that is played the most in\n0:39 Comment: This match, continuing to harbor hopes of a title. Real Madrid compared to men\n0:45 Comment: In attack they have the bench because there are Isco and Gesé, who could also use the\n0:53 Comment: Marcelo's weapon is lateral but we already know that he is almost more extreme than lateral and he is in the\n0:57 Comment: The Brazilian would also be on the bench. He could provide depth on the left wing, that would be an option.\n1:2 Comment: But come on, attack men, Isco and Gesé, in case that goal doesn't come to give Real Madrid the\n1:10 Comment: hope to continue dreaming of the league title. At the moment there is no one warming up\n1:14 Comment: Real Madrid. Real Sociedad has two players there but Real Madrid has not yet warmed up anyone.\n1:19 Comment: A Real Madrid that plays, taking the ball out Lucas Vázquez, had not coordinated the movement with\n1:28 Comment: Lucas Modric, however the white team recovers, Vázquez recovered, Casemiro opened for Nacho\n1:34 Comment: Nacho touching Gareth Bale, the Welshman's backheel, he leans on James, James again for Gareth Bale\n1:43 Comment: Behind Bale to Modric, let's see Modric's sending, see Danilo's arrival well, control the former\n1:49 Comment: Loporto, Danilo, Danilo's cross and that finally ends in a corner. There was good control,\n1:55 Comment: A good unmarking and the center then was well covered because the players of the\n2:1 Comment: Real Sociedad were in the key and good defensive position but they have already forced the first corner to the\n2:8 Comment: 47 minutes of the second half. Well, there goes the first corner of the second half for Real\n2:14 Comment: Madrid, Lucas Modric's delivery, Gareth Bale's shot. Yes, it seems like he hurt himself, it must be in the head\n2:24 Comment: after the shot. I imagine Zidane's dream for this match would be that Real Madrid could\n2:31 Comment: Clearly get the game back on track with two goals for example to give us a break\n2:36 Comment: I imagine and protect Gareth Bale ahead of Wednesday's match against Manchester City\n2:40 Comment: But at the moment the 0-0 makes it necessary to put all our effort into the game. That's what I would like.\n2:46 Comment: But I think the first thing they want to put in is the first and here I think there is a card too.\n2:51 Comment: Well, in fact, there is finally going to be the Xavi Prieto card, who is the one in the jump\n2:56 Comment: With Sergio Ramos he hit the captain of Real Madrid. Well, it's the third yellow card\n3:2 Comment: for Real after those Illa Remendi and Markel Bergan saw in the first half now Xavi Prieto.\n3:11 Comment: Yes, they put their elbow up to him, he has been apologizing to him too.\n3:16 Comment: You see the repetition in that duel between captains.\n3:19 Comment: Ramos took it precisely, the ball back for Rafael Varane.\n3:27 Comment: Win, throw-in. Gareth Bale is still dizzy from the blow he took to the head in\n3:33 Comment: That corner kick, he keeps moving his neck, holding the back of his head,\n3:37 Comment: rubbing his forehead. Gálex seems to be a little dizzy. It was supposedly for Ebril,\n3:43 Comment: He fell short with his chest, Ramos directs Casemiro well. Casemiro looking for Nacho,\n3:47 Comment: Controls well, Nacho delayed. Nacho to Ramos, Ramos combines with Casemiro, tries to press,\n3:54 Comment: In fact, he presses. Illa Remendi held Casemiro for Rafael Varane. Varane with Danilo.\n4:1 Comment: Danilo sent, finding space. There Luka Modric, what happens is that the ball goes very long.\n4:8 Comment: So ball for Real Sociedad.\n4:14 Comment: Yuri will play.\n4:19 Comment: Yuri Verchiche sat for a while, he now puts the ball into play on the left side.\n4:23 Comment: The Basque team touched Márquez Levergar with a header, then attacked with James.\n4:30 Comment: Mirror that wants to become a pass to Ollarjabal. There go the two Madrid centre-backs.\n4:35 Comment: Varane, Ramos, the one who takes the ball, the one who clears it more.\n4:39 Comment: The realistic fans were fouled, Varane fouled Ollarjabal. He didn't see it like that for a day.\n4:44 Comment: No, and they have also taken a lot of advantage over Real Sociedad here because it was a great game\n4:49 Comment: in some defensive way that has become almost a counterattack and that has taken him out\n4:54 Comment: It's a good idea to take the ball, take a throw-in because it will give Madrid's two centre-backs an advantage.\n4:59 Comment: There goes the delivery to the heart of the area and Rafael Varane's clearance for a corner.\n5:6 Comment: To the right of the goal defended by Keylor Navas.\n5:10 Comment: Well, Real Sociedad is going to take a corner now in the 50th minute and both times\n5:16 Comment: The area has also been weighed, this is due to a bad clearance by Varane or a defensive ball\n5:20 Comment: What they have done right now. There goes Pruma's shipment. The clearance was rushed but it finally cleared\n5:27 Comment: After Keylor Navas. Espejo Vázquez. Zaldúa is doing well. Miquel recovered, Zaldúa behind and Yarramendi.\n5:39 Comment: Controlled inside, Raso, Asier Yarramendi, returns Zurutuza. And Yarramendi in opening, captain Xavi Prieto.\n5:45 Comment: And Yarramendi is like a magnet. All the Real Sociedad players look for him, they look for him\n5:49 Comment: Constantly when they have the ball and if they look for him and find him it's because he shows up too.\n5:54 Comment: He cannot succeed at Real Madrid but he has always been important at Real in his first stage\n5:59 Comment: And this second time since he arrived last summer again, since he came back.\n6:3 Comment: They will say that he has already warmed up players who are Isco, Gesei and Kovacic.\n6:8 Comment: When Real is playing, there comes Oyarzabal, Bruma, protected from behind.\n6:13 Comment: Bruma opens to Yuri. Oyarzabal also comes there to combine.\n6:24 Comment: Now Zurutuza's advantage apparently goes to Danilo to protect the ball's exit well.\n6:30 Comment: Danilo kicks the goal.\n6:34 Comment: For Real Madrid, minute 7 of the second half of the ninth. It continues to be 0-0 which would condemn\n6:38 Comment: Practically now definitively, I would condemn Real Madrid to not win the league. They need the\n6:43 Comment: Three points, they also need Barça and Atlético de Madrid to win in the remainder of the league.\n6:50 Comment: And at the moment he has not been able to carry out the Real Madrid game. He has\n6:54 Comment: Almost the entire second half ahead. It's still 0-0 in the ninth. Keylor Navas's goal kick.\n7:6 Comment: The ball that with a Boomerang effect almost returned to Keylor Navas again.\n7:10 Comment: Yes, it is the effect that the air has on it, that lifts it up and throws it down and throws it.\n7:15 Comment: James playing there, the Colombian receives from his back. James plays, he combines with Luka Modric.\n7:20 Comment: Danilo, Danilo leans on that right wing on Luka Vázquez. Good return from the Galician for\n7:27 Comment: Danilo, the Brazilian joins the attack again. He combines the Coborja front,\n7:31 Comment: Mayoral wanted to return, Mayoral recovers Luka Vázquez. Casemiro, now combines with Ramos,\n7:38 Comment: Inside. James's return, again for the captain. Bale to the ground, Zaldúa foul.\n7:48 Comment: Gareth Bale hurts on the ground. The Welsh player joins.\n7:55 Comment: Yes, from there again it will be James who puts it in with his left foot.\n8:9 Comment: And well, all the Madrid players have come up, Varane, Ramos, to look for the shot.\n8:16 Comment: In this set piece for Zidane's team.\n8:18 Comment: There goes James' left foot, James' delivery, penalty spot.\n8:25 Comment: The action was well defended, Real cleared the ball on a throw-in. For Real Madrid.\n8:35 Comment: Now the painting, visitor through Danilo.\n8:42 Comment: Combines with Mayoral, Mayoral could not control. Zorotuza's departure for Pruma.\n8:48 Comment: Well, Casemiro is attentive as always in the defensive phase. Modric wanted to combine,\n8:53 Comment: He recovers the ball again, in this case Danilo Casemiro. Casemiro touched first.\n8:58 Comment: Close behind, which Borja Mayoral left, opening for Nacho, but it is not a good pass.\n9:6 Comment: Prieto is coming out with Pruma. Lucas Vázquez is going to cover. Yuri bends well.\n9:14 Comment: That ball on the front line, inside the area, Zorotuza cutting back, Zorotuza stopping the shot.\n9:18 Comment: Action that ends in a corner.\n9:20 Comment: Yes, it is the most dangerous, we have already said it in the first part. It is the one that has the most judgment\n9:25 Comment: with the ball in the Real Madrid area or near the area and he did it well. He tried to dribble,\n9:31 Comment: With a shot at first, then he cut back, but there was also both Modric and the defender\n9:37 Comment: They are very much on top and it was difficult, but they forced another corner kick again.\n9:41 Comment: To the right of Keylor Navas' goal, Pruma's delivery.\n9:46 Comment: Danilo's clearance, again a corner, second in a row for Eusebio's Real Sociedad\n9:51 Comment: Sakristan. Once again it will be Pruma who puts the ball into play, who takes that corner.\n10:1 Comment: In the hands, directly in the hands of Keylor Navas, without major complications\n10:5 Comment: For goalkeeper Tico. Goalkeeper who doesn't know whether to shoot short or long. Now\n10:12 Comment: It is already decided in short with Varane. The league at stake in Real Madrid's Anoeta that does not happen at the moment\n10:17 Comment: The 0-0 draw against Real Sociedad. It would leave the path even clearer for Barça and Atlético\n10:23 Comment: from Madrid, but for now above all to Barça, which is the one that depends on itself. James, James stop\n10:30 Comment: Nacho. Nacho relies on the Colombian again.\n10:37 Comment: And the Colombian in the youth team, James already left the pass with practically no room for maneuver to Nacho.\n10:46 Comment: In this second half, Real Madrid has not found, logically, these ten minutes until now, but\n10:52 Comment: In the first half he had almost shot three times to be able to score a goal, and in this one\n10:57 Comment: At the moment the second one does not find the ease or the possibilities that it had in the first\n11:2 Comment:  part. It is more difficult for him in this second to make attacking plays, to make plays\n11:8 Comment: where Real Sociedad is afraid. Real Sociedad right now has no reason to be afraid.\n11:13 Comment: There goes Nacho's shipment, Nacho's center, for Lucas Vázquez, Lucas controls.\n11:21 Comment: Danilo supports behind, the ball goes to the side, Danilo's shot goes wide.\n11:26 Comment: Yes, he already tried it in the first half, too, going into the middle, shooting with his left,\n11:31 Comment: Danilo's percentage of chances goes down there. I think that both Mayoral and\n11:37 Comment: Bale, they were in the finishing zone and a good cross there would have been almost more dangerous,\n11:42 Comment: With Danilo's right leg. Jerónimo Rulli is going to take out that second part, as he says\n11:49 Comment: Mister Camacho, more placid for the Argentine goalkeeper of Real Sociedad.\n12:0 Comment: The one Real Sociedad is already trying to tie for the coming seasons,\n12:5 Comment: reach an agreement with his club of origin Estudiantes de la Plata and keep him now\n12:9 Comment: Real property. Watch out, Lucas Vázquez, Lucas opening. The ball goes to James Rodríguez,\n12:15 Comment: Looking for an angle for the center. The ball went wide. Gareth Bale had the goal.\n12:21 Comment: Gareth Bale had it 0-1. That ball that stayed dead on the edge of the small area,\n12:27 Comment: That was by far the clearest chance of the game. It didn't define, Bale didn't resolve,\n12:32 Comment: Now he can do it with his head, although the play was invalid and just in case he had cleared\n12:37 Comment: Jerónimo Rulli. This has already been invalidated, due to offside. Yes, it has been invalidated.\n12:40 Comment: But the previous one was what a chance Bale had. No, closer than the penalty spot, even,\n12:45 Comment: Come on, it was... It was a goal, practically, because look where he finished, much closer to the\n12:52 Comment: Penalty point. The goalkeeper also covers very well with his right leg, because he can't jump,\n12:58 Comment: Because what is he going to do there, he was even covered by his defense, but he put his foot down and it was\n13:3 Comment: A miraculous foot. It was a very clear goal-scoring play that he did not know how to finish, because even\n13:9 Comment: I could have hit him much harder on the other side, which he had with his left foot much more\n13:14 Comment: Easy. Now yellow, Roberto. For Sergio Ramos, practically a repetition of the play\n13:19 Comment: in which María Xavi Prieto saw the card, in a jump with Sergio Ramos. He is now the center back and\n13:25 Comment: Captain of Real Madrid, the one who sees the card is practically for the same reason, for jumping with his elbow\n13:29 Comment: detached from the body. As we saw in that replay and before we also saw how the entire bench\n13:33 Comment: Real Madrid was practically jumping to sing the goal that they thought was made by Gareth Bale.\n13:39 Comment: With Casillas at the head and the rest of the substitutes they jumped out of the pit of the bench to sing a\n13:44 Comment: Goal that he never scored. He decided to shoot inside and he should have hit it hard on the other side,\n13:51 Comment: But well, from there of course, he is the one who has to decide and the easiest thing would have been to score a goal.\n13:55 Comment: Now Bruma is doubling for Yuri Verchiche, Yuri's center, that delivery that was passed and is going to come out the other\n14:1 Comment: side. Yes, this is a dangerous play too. What happens is that he has centered very strongly, if there was one\n14:6 Comment: Minced centering because it would have caused a lot of problems within the area.\n14:13 Comment: Ball for Arice Lustondo, Miquel González.\n14:18 Comment: Opening up for Bruma, who scored a great goal in the first round match at the Santiago Bernabéu.\n14:27 Comment: Bruma is playing again, a match that ended 3-1.\n14:32 Comment: That match, two from Cristiano Ronaldo, one from a penalty, the other from Lukas Vázquez and, as I say, the goal from Real de Bruma.\n14:41 Comment: It was 1-1 at that time, then Madrid won, as I said, 3-1.\n14:53 Comment: Throw-in for Zinedine Zidane's team.\n14:55 Comment: Bale, there trying to surprise the Real defense with that throw-in, didn't succeed,\n15:3 Comment: Casemiro recovers, Casemiro back for Sergio Ramos and this one with Varane. That goal doesn't come because\n15:10 Comment: Now that Real Madrid gives him the victory and that would place him as the leader waiting for what he does more\n15:16 Comment: Afternoon. Quarter past six, Atlético de Madrid, Rayo Vallecano, half past eight, Betis Barcelona.\n15:25 Comment: The foul, the foul for that little touch before the ball arrived from Márquez Vergara, Luka Modric.\n15:37 Comment: A quarter of an hour has already passed in the second half with that 0-0 that is of no use to Real\n15:43 Comment: Madrid, Gareth Bale's jump, the ustondo cleared, Zurutuza snatches the ball from Modric,\n15:49 Comment: At least he clears it, he takes it away because it is for Real Madrid in the end, it is missing.\n15:52 Comment: Zurutuza himself.\n15:59 Comment: Modric already took a short shot for James, Nacho is open on the wing, the ball goes towards him, there he receives\n16:6 Comment: The left back, Nacho delays Sergio Ramos, Ramos looks behind Luka Modric, not behind but in\n16:16 Comment: Parallel finally left.\n16:19 Comment: Against the Lucases, Vázquez, Borja Mayoral presses.\n16:25 Comment: Cansemiro.\n16:26 Comment: That's in all the problems. Absolutely.\n16:31 Comment: Resolving, recovering countless balls and always well positioned.\n16:35 Comment:  Lack.\n16:35 Comment: From Nacho.\n16:38 Comment: Nacho is desperate and yellow, there's going to be yellow too.\n16:41 Comment: Yes. Well, another yellow card that Real Madrid sees, the other that they see in the defensive zone and a Nacho who was with four yellow cards would miss Real Madrid's next League match.\n16:54 Comment: Against Valencia, next Sunday at 5.\n16:58 Comment: I don't know if he was going to take it out on Nacho for the foul, it didn't seem to me that he intended a dialogue, I don't know if it was to protest.\n17:5 Comment: No, for protesting I don't think so.\n17:8 Comment: It doesn't seem like he had any intention of getting the yellow card, but hey, he got it.\n17:12 Comment: Ball that Real is already playing and losing.\n17:16 Comment: Clear Danilo.\n17:18 Comment: Borja Mayoral jumps, Borja touched his head.\n17:25 Comment: He's going to reach the Parán intersection and sends the ball into the stands.\n17:31 Comment: That is difficult because of the great distance between the grass, the playing field and the stands, because of the athletics tracks.\n17:39 Comment: Throw-in that already affected Real Sociedad.\n17:42 Comment: Play back Bruma.\n17:44 Comment: Márquez Vergara changing the direction of the game.\n17:48 Comment: Ball that is not going to be lost, Xavi Prieto avoided it on the same line.\n17:52 Comment: He stopped the ball, leaving Zaldúa's center behind his side.\n17:56 Comment: Clear Baran, Bruma.\n17:59 Comment: Mist left behind for that Yuri center.\n18:1 Comment: Clear now Baran.\n18:4 Comment: Márquez Vergara, recovery, Zurutuza behind.\n18:6 Comment: Real Madrid is going to make the first change, Gese is going to come in.\n18:10 Comment: Well, surely by Mayoral.\n18:14 Comment: Casemiro clearance with rebound included.\n18:16 Comment: James gets the ball, James gets the ball pretty well.\n18:19 Comment: For Luka Vázquez counterattack on the left for Gareth Bale.\n18:22 Comment: He catches the ball there.\n18:23 Comment: Gareth Bale anticipated it a lot.\n18:26 Comment: That last touch caused Gareth Bale to lose the ball.\n18:32 Comment: Xavi Prieto getting the ball out now.\n18:34 Comment: The tie at zero remains in the noeta.\n18:37 Comment: Eight minutes still remain.\n18:40 Comment: For now, I think Real Madrid has not fallen prey to desperation or nerves.\n18:44 Comment: Card too.\n18:48 Comment: You're already putting out a few one day, right?\n18:51 Comment: Arzabal is due today, let him join his companions.\n18:54 Comment: Márquez Vergara and Aramendi.\n18:56 Comment: Xavi Prieto and at Real Madrid Bale, Ramos and Nacho.\n19:10 Comment: Play Sergio Ramos.\n19:14 Comment: Casemiro, enabling James.\n19:16 Comment: James' pass, who knows what he wanted to do because there was no one of his teammates in the place where he directed the ball.\n19:25 Comment: Rulli, the ustondo.\n19:27 Comment: What a mistake, Gareth Bale.\n19:29 Comment: Bale inside the area.\n19:30 Comment: Bale, who wanted to give up Luka Vázquez.\n19:33 Comment: He didn't see the shooting angle clearly from where he was.\n19:37 Comment: And there has been the pressure from Mayoral, who has put pressure on the goalkeeper, the defender and has led to an attack.\n19:45 Comment: And it has led to the failure that Bale has not taken advantage of.\n19:50 Comment: Well, it is the last service that Borja Mayoral has done for the crown because he is the one replaced by Gese.\n19:57 Comment: First change of the game therefore.\n19:59 Comment: Minute 20 of the second part.\n20:1 Comment: Gese for Borja Mayoral at Real Madrid.\n20:4 Comment: On the ground Bale.\n20:5 Comment: The referee tells him to get up, there is no foul.\n20:7 Comment: So continue the game.\n20:10 Comment: The player in the chest, Xavi Prieto.\n20:11 Comment: Zuru Tuza is coming to help.\n20:12 Comment: Xavi Prieto, anticipation of Ramos.\n20:15 Comment: He controls the ball and passes it to Luka Modric.\n20:18 Comment: There to Carrea, Modric raises the ball.\n20:20 Comment: Opening for that right wing of Luka.\n20:22 Comment: Danilo is going to double.\n20:23 Comment: Danilo, good position for the center.\n20:25 Comment: Danilo, I send you tempered.\n20:26 Comment: Small network front.\n20:27 Comment: Gareth Bale's jump.\n20:29 Comment: The ball that Xavi Prieto is going to recover for Real Sociedad.\n20:31 Comment: Hide the ball.\n20:33 Comment: The captain of the Guipuzcoan team.\n20:36 Comment: Real Madrid throw-in.\n20:37 Comment: Now Real Madrid has done well.\n20:38 Comment: He prepared the play well.\n20:40 Comment: What happens is that Real Sociedad has closed the finishing area very well.\n20:44 Comment:  Luka modric.\n20:46 Comment: Looking back.\n20:48 Comment: The collaboration of Lucas Pazquez.\n20:51 Comment: Danilo with Varane.\n20:55 Comment: Exit through the Sergio Ramos sector.\n20:59 Comment: He thinks about it, he doesn't want to risk it.\n21:2 Comment: Leave Rafael Varane behind.\n21:4 Comment: Opening of the right wing.\n21:6 Comment: Lucas Pazquez with Modric.\n21:7 Comment: Autopass that the Croatian is looking for.\n21:10 Comment: He was very attentive to helping Sir Illa-Ramendi.\n21:14 Comment: When Roberto is also preparing a change at Real Sociedad.\n21:17 Comment: The entry of the Mexican Diego Reyes.\n21:19 Comment: That you can just as well place him as a center back or place him in the center of the field.\n21:22 Comment: To further strengthen that area.\n21:24 Comment: Last week, Sunday at the Madrigal.\n21:27 Comment: He played in the center of the field.\n21:29 Comment: Pure pivot.\n21:31 Comment: Leaving the flanks to the right.\n21:32 Comment: The ball out.\n21:34 Comment: That change can now be made.\n21:36 Comment: He has noticed.\n21:38 Comment: I'm sure it's there in the center of the field.\n21:40 Comment: Yes, Vergara.\n21:42 Comment: One of the ones with yellow.\n21:44 Comment: And also that he is going to occupy the position up front.\n21:46 Comment: It will make like a triangle with the two centre-backs.\n21:50 Comment: Also, by the way, Real Sociedad is negotiating\n21:53 Comment: with the rights of Kings.\n21:56 Comment: To finally reach an agreement.\n21:58 Comment: And he thinks about it, he doesn't want to risk it.\n21:59 Comment: De Reyes to finally reach an agreement.\n22:2 Comment: And I think it is Porto that has its rights.\n22:5 Comment: Porto has him on loan.\n22:7 Comment: And he wants to sign him.\n22:9 Comment: The Royal Society already owned.\n22:11 Comment: A Real, by the way, that has asked Southampton for Juanmi.\n22:13 Comment: The former Málaga player.\n22:15 Comment: Ball for Nacho.\n22:17 Comment: And Southampton have tied it at two million euros.\n22:20 Comment: A great objective for Real Sociedad for next season.\n22:22 Comment: Juanmi.\n22:24 Comment: That ball for Xavi Prieto.\n22:25 Comment: Southampton that will be Manchester City's rival tomorrow.\n22:28 Comment: The game that will offer 0-0 at 5:30.\n22:30 Comment: Southampton-Manchester City.\n22:32 Comment: Tomorrow 5:30.\n22:34 Comment: Real Madrid's rival next Wednesday at the Bernabéu.\n22:37 Comment: Luka Modric playing.\n22:41 Comment: Danilo opening.\n22:56 Comment: It goes on and on, of course, Real Madrid.\n22:58 Comment: It will continue like this until Marquez, if he gets it, scores the goal that gives him the three points.\n23:8 Comment: That ball from Sergio Ramos.\n23:10 Comment: Cross ball.\n23:16 Comment: Danilo, a throw-in for Real Madrid.\n23:19 Comment: Let's see now with Gesé's entry.\n23:21 Comment: But the truth is that Real Madrid had a very, very clear opportunity to score a goal.\n23:25 Comment: It was Bale's, but it is not the same as in the first part, far from it.\n23:31 Comment: And this is an exit that can be dangerous for Arreal.\n23:34 Comment: It could have been, but it wasn't because Sergio Ramos crossed the line very well.\n23:38 Comment: He left Keylor Navas behind.\n23:40 Comment: Keylor clearance.\n23:43 Comment: Ball that James fights.\n23:45 Comment: He gets it, he doesn't.\n23:48 Comment: Casemiro hinders enough and in the end he had to whistle for José's foul.\n23:52 Comment: But he had to call the foul one day.\n23:54 Comment: He let the play continue in case Real Sociedad took advantage and seeing what he couldn't do, he blew the foul.\n24:0 Comment:  Dangerous.\n24:2 Comment: Although it is far from the front, it is a dangerous situation, among others, for Xavi Prieto.\n24:6 Comment: It's a tad far away.\n24:10 Comment: We have Casemiro's action against Ollarzabal.\n24:17 Comment: That foul that the Brazilian midfielder made.\n24:21 Comment: On the Real Madrid bench, the gestures of how important these remaining 20 minutes are, as the white team can be ruled out of the fight for the league, are becoming more and more evident.\n24:31 Comment: Well, that tension is obviously going to grow as the minutes go by.\n24:35 Comment: There is a key around the ball.\n24:38 Comment: Xavi Prieto approached but in the end he walked away.\n24:40 Comment: He's not going to be the one to take the foul on Xavi Prieto.\n24:42 Comment: Mist stays.\n24:44 Comment: He is the one who places the ball Bruma.\n24:46 Comment: And all this time Zinedine Zidane takes advantage of to call Isco to be the second change at Real Madrid.\n24:53 Comment: Two, three,

to recover, does not finally achieve it.\n25:57 Comment: That long ball, Varane crosses there, hindering Ollard Zabal.\n26:1 Comment: Although the ball is still in possession of the Real player, he leaves Ollard Zabal behind.\n26:5 Comment: Real Madrid defenders are repositioned. Xavi Prieto delays Reyes.\n26:8 Comment: First ball the Mexican touches, Bruma arrives.\n26:11 Comment: Bruma shoot, Bruma.\n26:13 Comment: And Keylor Navas stopped.\n26:16 Comment: Varane did well there because he slowed down the forward's action.\n26:21 Comment: And then Ramos, for example, has already been able to come to his aid.\n26:25 Comment: But it was dangerous because there they could have stayed one against one and it was the last option.\n26:31 Comment: Danilo.\n26:33 Comment: Danilo leaves. Real Madrid continues trying to find that path that will give them the goal.\n26:38 Comment: That allows them to continue aspiring to the League title in this final sprint.\n26:42 Comment: Stop dead ball in this final sprint of the season.\n26:45 Comment: Playing Gareth Bale.\n26:48 Comment: He still has time left for the final sprint of the game. There's a little bit left, minute 27.\n26:52 Comment: Throw-in, ball out.\n26:54 Comment: And he will enter, Jaisco will enter.\n26:56 Comment: That change will be made. It's going to be James.\n26:59 Comment:  Well yes.\n27:1 Comment: And it's not very good for him because if you're playing in the League and they change you now it's because maybe on the field no, no, no.\n27:9 Comment: The coach has not seen what is necessary, he does not think it is appropriate for you to play these final minutes.\n27:15 Comment: They are decisive in a League, right?\n27:18 Comment: How do you rate, Mister Camacho, the performance that the Colombian played?\n27:22 Comment: Well, I think it's not just him who started the first part anyway.\n27:27 Comment: It has been better on Real Madrid's part than this second half so far.\n27:31 Comment: And he wanted to, he asked for all the balls and he wanted everything.\n27:35 Comment: This second part has blurred a little more.\n27:38 Comment: Well, the exchange of Jaisco for James.\n27:40 Comment: The ball is left for Modric on the edge of the area.\n27:43 Comment: Modric opens Gareth Bale.\n27:46 Comment: Lower the ball.\n27:48 Comment: Gareth Bale, first ball that Isco touches.\n27:52 Comment: Isco combines with Nacho.\n27:54 Comment: There Real Sociedad was closing very well.\n27:56 Comment: Recovery of Asier Illa-Ramendi.\n27:59 Comment: Good pressure from Madrid.

Modric drives.\n28:8 Comment: Modric has a pass to the right. He sees it and gives it.\n28:10 Comment: Ajese! Rulli has served. He touches Isco's head.\n28:14 Comment: And Mikel González finally left.\n28:18 Comment: It was a dangerous approach from Real Madrid.\n28:20 Comment: Now he wants to go against Real, but there is no clear possibility.\n28:24 Comment: In the first part of the play and not in the second either because Sergio Ramos crossed.\n28:28 Comment: Yes, Madrid has forced the situation there.\n28:30 Comment: Modric himself could have been fouled on the edge of the area.\n28:34 Comment: But he has seen the situation on the right wing very well.\n28:38 Comment: And come on, Real Madrid has no other choice.\n28:41 Comment: He has to force the situation, he has to look for the goal no matter what.\n28:44 Comment: Ball that Casemiro is playing. Casemiro for Isco.\n28:47 Comment: What a match Casemiro is having.\n28:49 Comment: Of seriousness, of firmness, of solidity.\n28:51 Comment: As usual in the center of the field.\n28:53 Comment: Ball for Isco.\n28:55 Comment: Lose the ball.\n28:57 Comment: It's for Bruno.\n28:58 Comment: Isco loses the ball.\n29:0 Comment: It's for Bruno.\n29:3 Comment: Card surely too.\n29:5 Comment: Well, he got the most that Bruno could get out of it.\n29:8 Comment: He was alone surrounded by two men from Madrid without support from his teammates.\n29:11 Comment: It causes the foul, it causes the yellow.\n29:14 Comment: Bruno's phenomenal action.\n29:16 Comment: What happens here now is that Isco, for example, loses the ball and Real CDA can counterattack.\n29:21 Comment: But on the other hand, now that is a possible solution.\n29:24 Comment: Isco has to try there on the edge of the area.\n29:25 Comment: He has to try to dribble.\n29:27 Comment: He has to try to open gaps there between the defense.\n29:29 Comment: And it's the only way.\n29:31 Comment: Logically there can be a risk that the ball will be stolen, that they will go on the counterattack and these things can happen.\n29:37 Comment: But in this case now it is good because he has to try to take risks because he has 15 minutes left until the end of the game and that is where good footballers have to take risks.\n29:48 Comment: Well now Bale's ball.\n29:49 Comment: Gese doesn't arrive. Rulli was fast. And Gese not so fast, to be honest.\n29:53 Comment: Yes, and it's a quick foul because he put his foot in at the last minute but the goalkeeper was quick and ready.\n30:2 Comment: And the Real public, Roberto likes the change that Eusebio is going to make.\n30:7 Comment: He likes it not because he's going to Rome but because Bautista, who is a kid from the quarry, is going to come in.\n30:12 Comment: Still a 20 year old player, he turns 21 in July.\n30:16 Comment: Bruma will replace her, John Bautista.\n30:27 Comment: He also gets a good ovation.

It's been well-prepared. Damn!\n31:4 Comment: That's for Luka Modric. He has a pass to the right. Lucas Vázquez opens. He left the wing to Danilo Lucas.\n31:10 Comment: Lucas is still there playing for Modric. Inside ball. Be careful Danilo. Danilo wanted to control.\n31:16 Comment: And that's going to end in a throw-in because the ball stays still and doesn't come out anywhere, neither from the bottom nor from the side.\n31:22 Comment: Recovery of Real. 32 minutes almost into the second half.\n31:27 Comment: Nacho, Nacho, Nacho.\n31:29 Comment: Recovery of Real. 32 minutes almost into the second half.\n31:34 Comment: Nanoeta remains at 0-0. Not enough for Madrid.\n31:39 Comment: Now Real can take advantage of these last 15 minutes in which Real Madrid is logically going to have to turn.\n31:46 Comment: And as a consequence you will have to leave more space in the back.\n31:50 Comment: That's a great pass from Isco. Watch out for Lucas Vázquez. The center is very closed. Too much from Lucas Vázquez.\n31:55 Comment: What a great cross pass from Isco, enabling the Galician.\n31:59 Comment: That later he was not so good with the shipment to the heart of the area.\n32:2 Comment: And that's why Real can launch counterattacks.\n32:5 Comment: Like this one with this ball that Sergio Ramos cuts. The captain of Real Madrid takes the ball.\n32:10 Comment: Ramos with authority, serving the ball. Casemiro returned. Ramos is encouraged to go up.\n32:15 Comment: Opening for Gesé. Gesé cuts him off. Be careful Xavi with Ramos.\n32:20 Comment: Isco, hiding the ball near the edge of the area.\n32:23 Comment: The combination with Gareth Bale. Bale. The return to Bale. They don't understand each other but the ball is still in Real Madrid's possession.\n32:31 Comment: Gesé. The goalkeeper took it. Rulli for a corner.\n32:36 Comment: Sensational stretch from the La Plata goalkeeper.\n32:40 Comment: It seemed like the ball was going weaker. It wasn't a dangerous ball but it has become very dangerous.\n32:48 Comment: How he stretched, how Jerónimo Rulli flew.\n32:50 Comment: Corner kick for Real Madrid.\n32:53 Comment: There goes the set piece. Luka Modric's delivery. It was quite short.\n32:59 Comment: Modric's center. The counter for Real. The possible counter.\n33:4 Comment: Conoyerzao to the back. Kings.\n33:8 Comment: He is now repositioning himself in defense of Real Madrid. Danilo is going to cover there.\n33:12 Comment: Waiting for the Baptist center. The ball that passes in front of Keylor Navas.\n33:20 Comment: Spherico for Xavi Prieto.\n33:24 Comment: Prieto to Zaldúa.\n33:28 Comment: And departure now for Gesé.\n33:30 Comment: This is going to be quite like that too.\n33:36 Comment: Because Madrid is not going to give up until the referee calls for a goal.\n33:40 Comment: And for that they have to reach the Real Sociedad area. And Real Sociedad is going to try to take advantage of the counterattacks.\n33:46 Comment: The ball goes from Isco to Danilo. In front of Lucas Vázquez. Luka Modric comes to help.\n33:53 Comment: Isco's touch. Modric.\n33:57 Comment: Isco opens. Lucas. The sending of Lucas Vázquez.\n34:2 Comment: Goal from Bale. Goal from Bale. Goal from Bale. Goal from Bale. Goal from Real Madrid-Gareth Bale.\n34:15 Comment: Gareth Bale scores in the 34th minute of the second half.\n34:20 Comment: Bringing out again his fantastic aerial game.\n34:25 Comment: His fantastic jump already marked a week ago in Vallecas.\n34:31 Comment: It was 2-1 at that time.\n34:33 Comment: And this goal could be decisive for Real Madrid to continue dreaming of the League if this ends with victory.\n34:39 Comment: We see that delivery from the right wing again. Lucas Vázquez.\n34:44 Comment: And as anticipated for the header. Gareth Bale. 0-1.\n34:48 Comment: The Cardiff Express scored. Gareth Bale. 0-1. Real Madrid wins.\n34:52 Comment: And well, it's just Real Madrid's success. Because Real Sociedad has not failed in anything here.\n34:58 Comment: It was a play that opened the band.\n35:0 Comment: Where Lucas Vázquez has put an impressive center.\n35:3 Comment: And where Bale has played Santillana. He has been a true center forward.\n35:6 Comment: A true auctioneer.\n35:8 Comment: And besides, you can't say anything to Real Sociedad because they were well placed. They were well placed.\n35:13 Comment: The defense was in place. Especially the center backs.\n35:16 Comment: But Bale's power has prevailed. Here you can't tell him anything. Only the success of the Real Madrid player.\n35:22 Comment: Goal number 19 by Gareth Bale. What he takes away from the League.\n35:25 Comment: And how Roberto jumped onto the entire Real Madrid bench to celebrate that Welsh goal.\n35:29 Comment: The truth is that it has been truly crazy how it has been celebrated.\n35:32 Comment: He caught us right in front of us when Gareth Bale came to hug his teammates.\n35:36 Comment: And Real Madrid was probably the Welsh one.\n35:38 Comment: Due to the absences of Cristiano and Benzema who were the two top scorers for the whites.\n35:42 Comment: And because if not, tomorrow the media would all say that Bale couldn't handle the pressure.\n35:48 Comment: It was already possible in Vallecas and it has been able to do so again today.\n35:51 Comment: He scored his goal. Let's see how the game ends.\n35:54 Comment: But he did what he had to do. He put the team on his back and the entire offensive game went through him.\n35:59 Comment: What I said. Last week in Vallecas the score was 2-1.\n36:2 Comment: The one who shortened that disadvantage against Rayo.\n36:7 Comment: Then wealth arrived and it made it 2-3 too.\n36:10 Comment: So the Man of the Match last Saturday was decisive.\n36:15 Comment: And the Man of the Match is also being decisive.\n36:17 Comment: Man of the match today because he scored 0-1.\n36:19 Comment: With whom Real Madrid wants the game to end now.\n36:22 Comment: I would continue dreaming about the title. I would continue waiting for Barça's blow.\n36:25 Comment: And Atlético de Madrid needs both of them to puncture.\n36:28 Comment: And obviously Madrid needs to win the two remaining games.\n36:32 Comment: Against Valencia at the Bernabéu and against Deportivo at Riazor.\n36:36 Comment: At the moment what he needs is for this to end like this.\n36:39 Comment: With the victory that has cost him so much to get ahead.\n36:43 Comment: We'll see if he takes it or not. Xavi Prieto's center is a gift for Keylor Navas.\n36:48 Comment: Yes. Until now Keylor has not had...\n36:51 Comment: I don't know if he has made any worthwhile saves.\n36:54 Comment: Some dangerous stop.\n36:56 Comment: Well, Real Sociedad at the time have been around the Real Madrid area with some danger.\n37:2 Comment: But I really don't know if... I don't remember that I had made any intervention.\n37:7 Comment: No, no. None really complicated. I don't remember either. Watch out for Luka Modric.\n37:12 Comment: And in return, Jerónimo Rulli has had to intervene several times.\n37:15 Comment: Danilo goes inside the area holding on. The former Loporto player.\n37:19 Comment: Does he protect the ball? No, he didn't protect it. He played it, he risked it against Lucas Vázquez.\n37:23 Comment: Or trying to combine with Lucas Vázquez.\n37:26 Comment: Man, Real Madrid must now change a little these 10 minutes that may remain with the discount.\n37:33 Comment: The philosophy. It no longer needs the stress of the goal. It no longer needs the counterattack of Real Sociedad.\n37:41 Comment: In theory it should no longer occur. Real Madrid should continue playing the same.\n37:45 Comment: Have his ball, which is what he's trying to do.\n37:48 Comment: Because now, for example, it is much more organized in the field and with many more men behind, logically.\n37:52 Comment: Because now you no longer need that burden.\n37:55 Comment: Let's see that center from Zaldúa. Zaldúa is in a very hurry, but he shot the center with everything and with that.\n38:0 Comment: Real can create danger. Ball back for Yuri.\n38:6 Comment: Trying to create danger now for Eusebio Sacristán's team.\n38:9 Comment: Spring end of the game. 38 lengths of this second half.\n38:13 Comment: At the moment he is doing his job. He is doing what Real Madrid should. Win the game.\n38:16 Comment: And then, wait for Atlético and Barça's decision. He's going to make a change. He's going to add one more midfielder.\n38:24 Comment: Zinedine Zidane, Roberto.\n38:26 Comment: Kovács has entered and as José Antonio was indicating, well, it's time to change the approach.\n38:30 Comment: And Real Madrid in these last minutes has to play something else.\n38:36 Comment: Let's see that ball he recovers. He asked in hand. Especially the fans, more than the Real Sociedad players.\n38:41 Comment: Ball for Gesé. Gesé controls well. Already trained by Real Sociedad.\n38:43 Comment: He wants to kill Real Madrid's game so as not to suffer in the end.\n38:46 Comment: I made a self-pass. Let's see if there is a chance for a good cross from there.\n38:50 Comment: The cutout. Gesé center. Rulli clears.\n38:53 Comment: And Luka Vázquez can't get to the ball. Leaving Real Sociedad.\n38:57 Comment: Kovács and Che are waiting for an interruption to enter the match.\n39:0 Comment: It will be Real Madrid's third change.\n39:2 Comment: Yes, but now, you see? Now it's different. Now, well, Gesé has arrived. He has centered and Bale was there.\n39:8 Comment: Luka Vázquez was at the auction.\n39:10 Comment: But Madrid had seven men at the back, seven men positioned and it was very difficult for them to surprise them.\n39:17 Comment: It's a normal logical thing. And now that he's leaving, well, it's Modric, right?\n39:21 Comment: Among other things, not only the break. He also has a yellow card.\n39:24 Comment: I have seen this final stretch of the match. Well, I probably want to reserve the Croatian, who will leave his place to another compatriot.\n39:31 Comment: Yes, and I imagine that he must have said these, what do I know, seven, eight minutes that he may have.\n39:35 Comment: Well, let him maintain his position a little longer, because his teammates may be tired and, above all,\n39:42 Comment: It is essential for Real Sociedad not to be caught by Real Madrid's counterattack.\n39:46 Comment: Well, there have been a lot of changes. You have Din Zidane, a Croatian for a Croatian, Mateo Kovács, for Luka Modric.\n39:52 Comment: And Héctor Hernández has also joined Real Sociedad, which I have not been able to appreciate.\n39:57 Comment: Who was the player who gave him his place.\n39:59 Comment: Well, Eusebio Sacristán has also made changes there.\n40:3 Comment: In this first-final of the match, already at 0-1, 40 long into the second half.\n40:9 Comment: Five plus whatever the Undian referee, Mayenko, deducts, Real Madrid wins 0-1.\n40:13 Comment: He would once again take the lead, as happened last week.\n40:16 Comment: He was also one of the three hopefuls for the title who played before in the four o'clock match against Rayo.\n40:21 Comment: He would once again be the leader. In this case he would add 84 points to Barça's 82,\n40:27 Comment: which plays at 8:30 in Seville against Betis and at 82 also in the Liga de la Liga.\n40:30 Comment: That plays at a quarter past 6 at the Calderón, receives Rayo.\n40:33 Comment: Ball in front of Real Madrid.\n40:36 Comment: Maybe he still has to suffer in the game, that ends in a goal kick, now he doesn't suffer.\n40:41 Comment: Yes, he wanted to shoot but he hit it badly, he missed it.\n40:45 Comment: The time that now runs in favor of Zinedine Zidane's team.\n40:49 Comment: That gives the band's last years of applause to its players.\n40:54 Comment: Let's see again, I think Real Madrid's goal.\n40:56 Comment: Lucas Vázquez's center and that's how he gains position on Galía Peña's front.\n40:59 Comment: The jump is also spectacular.\n41:1 Comment: Yes, also, impossible for the goalkeeper to stop.\n41:4 Comment: Yes, he beats the position with the body he has and it is a very good shot\n41:10 Comment: And a true finisher and a great goal.\n41:14 Comment: A meter 86 player, Gareth Bale, elastic, an athlete, fibrous.\n41:20 Comment: He is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very player\n41:26 Comment: Very athletic and with spectacular jumping ability Gareth Bale.\n41:32 Comment: The ball that Real plays, already pushing in this final sprint of the match.\n41:36 Comment: The center ends in a corner kick, then Sofia and Madrid.\n41:39 Comment: Stopped ball, corner to the right of the goal defended by Keylor Navas.\n41:44 Comment: Yes, of course, it is that as a consequence of the goal, because Real Madrid has now stopped insisting,\n41:48 Comment: to put pressure on Real Sociedad's goal and now it is Real Sociedad that is coming a little more.\n41:56 Comment: There goes the dead ball, the cut delivery, quite short.\n42:0 Comment: The shipment was easy for Danilo's clearance.\n42:5 Comment: It's going to be a throw-in, Danilo cut in again.\n42:11 Comment: Real Sociedad is in a hurry, Real Madrid is in no hurry.\n42:14 Comment: Well, Madrid is in a hurry because the game is over, yes.\n42:17 Comment: And continue dreaming of the league title.\n42:19 Comment: Zidane's team.\n42:22 Comment: Héctor Hernández became desperate.\n42:25 Comment: He asked for the throw-in at his team's forum, but it's for Real Madrid, Danilo played it.\n42:30 Comment: Danilo took it out.\n42:33 Comment: New interruption, foul in favor of Real Madrid.\n42:37 Comment: Yes, he is no longer in a hurry, of course.\n42:42 Comment: Because he is no longer in a hurry, he is no longer in a hurry.\n42:44 Comment: Because he is no longer in a hurry, of course.\n42:49 Comment: Because he is achieving his goal of winning the game, of getting three points.\n42:54 Comment: Yes, he's going to take out Keylor because he's going to hit long, surely looking for Bale.\n42:59 Comment: Haired with Gesé, surely.\n43:4 Comment: And well, to also move the ball away from their area and start the game again.\n43:11 Comment: And he hits Keylor Navas.\n43:16 Comment: The ball, Bale jumps, won.

    "summary": "In an intense and highly competitive La Liga clash, Real Sociedad hosted Real Madrid at the Anoeta stadium. Real Madrid edged out Real Sociedad with a 1-0 victory, which was essential for maintaining their hopes for the league title. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of the match:\n\n### First Half:\n\nThe game commenced with both sides displaying high energy and ambition. The initial moments saw Real Sociedad showing resilience in controlling possession while Real Madrid, driven by their need to secure three points, applied pressure across the pitch to disrupt their rhythm.\n\n**Early Minutes**:\n- Within the first 15 minutes, Real Madrid demonstrated their tactical acumen. Varane’s calm presence and sharp defensive interventions laid the foundation for the team’s confidence. They played in a 4-3-3 formation, with Bale and Lucas Vázquez adding width to their attack.\n- By the 10th minute, the clarity of Real Madrid's strategy became evident. Zidane’s squad aimed to dominate possession and force Real Sociedad into a counter-defensive stance.\n\n**Key Plays and Misses**:\n- Early on, Gareth Bale showed his attacking threat with a couple of promising moves. His attempt in the 7th minute, a swift cross-goal shot, narrowly missed the target.\n- James Rodríguez was in the thick of action, constantly linking up with Lucas Vázquez and Nacho to stretch the Real Sociedad defense. His interactions, particularly around the 15th minute, highlighted Madrid's intent to break the deadlock early.\n- Keylor Navas, playing behind a fluid defense line, showcased his deep understanding of the game by making crucial saves, especially intercepting dangerous crosses aimed at Zurutuza and Bruma.\n\n**Mid Half**:\n- Both teams displayed strategic resilience with Real Sociedad attempting to capitalize on swift counter-attacks. They commanded the central areas, forcing Real Madrid to deploy more width through Bale and Danilo on the wings.\n- The midfield battle was intense with Casemiro putting on a defensive clinic, breaking down several Sociedad plays and preventing them from gaining any real momentum. His connection with Luka Modric was instrumental in recycling possession and initiating Real's attacks.\n\n**Closing Minutes of the First Half**:\n- The latter part of the half saw Real Sociedad gaining a slight upper hand in terms of possession, attempting to build momentum through controlled passes orchestrated primarily by Xabi Prieto and Illarramendi.\n- Despite Madrid's attacking efforts, they were met with robust resistance from Sociedad's defense, highlighted by timely interceptions from Mikel González and commanding saves by Jerónimo Rulli.\n- The half concluded with both teams goalless but an evident Real Madrid dominance in terms of creating scoring opportunities, especially through Gareth Bale’s aerial prowess and Lucas Vázquez’s persistent runs on the flanks.\n\n### Second Half:\n\nThe second half resumed with both sides keeping their starting eleven intact, carrying forward the form and intensity from the first 45 minutes. Real Madrid knew the importance of the three points in their pursuit of the title, which was reflected in their approach.\n\n**Initial Phase**:\n- Real Sociedad pushed harder defensively, trying to stymie Real Madrid’s assertive offensive plays. Despite their efforts, the tactical discipline of Madrid's back line, led by Ramos and Varane, remained unyielding.\n- Gareth Bale's positioning on the left, contrasting with his earlier placement on the right, gave Madrilistas different attacking dimensions, keeping Sociedad’s defense guessing.\n\n**Key Moments and Tactical Adjustments**:\n- By the 55th minute, Real Madrid was still hunting for that elusive goal. Danilo and Nacho alternated between defensive duties and providing width in the attack.\n- James, who was instrumental in orchestrating moves, was replaced by Isco around the 70th minute. This substitution brought a fresh spark as Isco’s nimble footwork and creative flair started to dismantle Sociedad's tiring defense.\n\n**Breakthrough**:\n- The critical moment arrived in the 70th minute when Real Madrid’s relentless pressure finally paid off. Gareth Bale, demonstrating his superb aerial ability, connected with a perfect cross from Lucas Vázquez. Rising majestically, Bale directed a powerful header past Rulli to break the deadlock. This goal highlighted Bale's importance in the absence of key players like Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema.\n\n**Final Phase**:\n- Following the goal, Real Madrid prudently managed the game. They maintained possession, closed down spaces swiftly, and prevented Sociedad from threatening their lead.\n- Defensive solidity was paramount in the dying minutes, with Casemiro continuing his stellar performance, breaking up Sociedad’s build-up play effectively.\n- Zidane brought on Mateo Kovacic for Luka Modric, ensuring fresh legs in midfield to control the tempo and protect their slender lead.\n\n### Tactical Insights:\n\n- **Real Madrid's Formation and Adjustments**:\n  - The shift in tactics, particularly the fluid interchange between Bale and Lucas Vázquez on the wings, displayed Zidane’s flexible approach. It kept Real Sociedad’s defense on their toes.\n  - Borja Mayoral's off-the-ball movement opened spaces for Bale and James, although Mayoral himself was not heavily involved in finishing chances.\n\n- **Real Sociedad's Resilience**:\n  - Despite going down, Real Sociedad kept pushing.
