appears, he throws her out.\n34:52 Comment: This time the Uruguayan armed himself quickly.\n34:55 Comment: And again Rakitic dared to go under pressure and recovered a ball in the danger zone.\n35:2 Comment: Mascherano, in front of Craves.\n35:7 Comment: Since he spent the season running continuously he hasn't run that much without touching the ball.\n35:13 Comment: Because the man goes there trying to cover up Barcelona.\n35:17 Comment: He plays the ball to Leomés and they hit him, he can't pick it up.\n35:21 Comment: After beating Uche, Cuenca with the ball.\n35:24 Comment: Cuenca plays for Uche, Uche behind, Lombán takes out.\n35:28 Comment: From above and now Lombán is going perfectly, sorry, Toral, but the referee says there was a foul.\n35:34 Comment: Denis Suárez is not contributing enough to Sergio Roberto.\n35:38 Comment: When Sergio Roberto catches the ball he goes towards the sideline right where Roberto wants to go.\n35:44 Comment: Instead of giving him an alternative inside.\n35:47 Comment: So Suárez and Sergio Roberto are not well synchronized at all.\n35:51 Comment: Sergio Roberto is doing very well because he is doing very well.\n35:56 Comment: But Denis Suárez is not giving him many alternatives now.\n36:1 Comment: He had to go diagonally and Denis Suárez is on the wing.\n36:4 Comment: Denis Suárez playing the ball for Javier Mascherano.\n36:6 Comment: Mascherano, who is going to insist, has turned to the side already at the end Sergio Roberto.\n36:10 Comment: Denis Suárez hasn't seen him, it's Mascherano's turn.\n36:13 Comment: Mascherano again goes to the center where Uditi is.\n36:15 Comment: On the other side open Dignet.\n36:17 Comment: Dignet has Neymar short in the inside ten position.\n36:20 Comment: He plays for Rafinha, he's going to lose there against Uche.\n36:23 Comment: The ball is loose.\n36:25 Comment: Cuenca is going to try and make a mistake.\n36:28 Comment: He understood that the ball was coming out of the baseline and he lost enough time to get out.\n36:33 Comment: Now Luis Suárez is not fine in control.\n36:35 Comment: Uche takes her.\n36:37 Comment: Uche trying to go for the band.\n36:39 Comment: He

Comment: Lack, lack.\n37:13 Comment: I am with Maikel.\n37:15 Comment: Denis Suárez is not contributing much.\n37:16 Comment: It's not like Rafinha is doing much.\n37:19 Comment: And then it is true that giving up Busquets is a lot of giving up, but you are giving up two things.\n37:25 Comment:  Busquets and Ráquiti in a position closer to the area, which is where I think he really handles himself better and does more damage.\n37:31 Comment: Yes, Ráquiti with Sergio Roberto is much more eloquent on the right side than Denis Suárez.\n37:40 Comment: Let's not rule out that if the Barça game does not resolve it beforehand, we will see Busquets to overtake Ráquiti.\n37:46 Comment: Evidently Barça does not...\n37:48 Comment: Attention there, he's going with the ball again.\n37:51 Comment: Pereira falls, the goal scorer says that nothing happened, that Pereira threw himself.\n37:54 Comment: I think that obviously the three points for Barcelona are capital, right?\n37:58 Comment: Because this league is being a league in which everyone is leaving a lot of points, but today Madrid and Atlético de Madrid won.\n38:4 Comment: And Atlético de Madrid says that it has left points on this day.\n38:7 Comment: At the moment it is Sevilla that has drawn against Sporting de Gijón.\n38:10 Comment: Denis Suárez looks for the ball high up, Denis Suárez controls it.\n38:13 Comment: Saunier comes with him, he throws a heeled pipe at him.\n38:16 Comment: Saunier closing, the goal scorer says there is no foul.\n38:18 Comment: Granada is taking the ball up now, trying to get out with speed.\n38:21 Comment: In the tweet, upstairs a marmoset is going to close before Kravets arrives.\n38:25 Comment: There had been a good ball from Pereira, but Luis Enrique's defense reacted perfectly.\n38:33 Comment: The other option is, logically, that André Gómez comes in to play as a pivot, who has also played at some time, and overtake Rakitic.\n38:38 Comment: There goes Luis Suárez, he can put it in, Neymar arrives.\n38:41 Comment: It closed coming from the other side, Bezo.\n38:44 Comment: He came with an advantage, he kicked it out, corner kick.\n38:48 Comment: 38 minutes. First half 0-0 on the scoreboard.\n38:53 Comment: Obviously Granada fans must be happy with the result and with the resistance of their team.\n39:2 Comment: Now, no matter what happens, these minutes will help Lucas Alcaraz to talk to the players about confidence and competitiveness, because they are competing against Barcelona.\n39:13 Comment: And defending with great order.\n39:15 Comment: What they haven't done throughout the championship.\n39:18 Comment: The ball for Messi.\n39:21 Comment: Messi plays, delivers the ball to Denis Suárez.\n39:25 Comment: Toral touches the ball, Pereira slips from the ground.\n39:29 Comment: If Kravets can't be found, Digne takes her.\n39:31 Comment: Decent delivery for Sergi Roberto.\n39:33 Comment: Sergi Roberto in front of Mascherano, touching the ball for Neymar.\n39:39 Comment: It is also true that the great knows that the games mature, and that the physical freshness he has had in some coverages\n39:46 Comment: Part of the defense in Granada, most likely as the minutes go by, will be lost.\n39:52 Comment: Yes, the option of an error is increasing, logically, over an advance to the match.\n39:55 Comment: And then the talent that Barça has to solve it in an isolated play.\n39:59 Comment: Mascherano plays, Mascherano delivers for Neymar.\n40:2 Comment: Neymar on the wing, close to it, tries to start from the right.\n40:5 Comment: He has Luis Suárez short, Luis Suárez wanted to play for Leo Messi.\n40:9 Comment: There goes Uche, Uche who is going to search upstairs.\n40:11 Comment: It's a little fast, there Toral, Uche is desperate with his partner.\n40:17 Comment: With good reason.\n40:19 Comment: And Sergi Roberto who stole their wallet.\n40:23 Comment: Upstairs, Bezo touched the ball and it's Körner again for Barcelona.\n40:27 Comment: From the left side of the attack, Luis Enrique's team will launch almost the umpteenth corner kick in this first half.\n40:36 Comment: Prepare to hit the ball around minute 40 of the first half.\n40:40 Comment: Barça again.\n40:42 Comment: Neymar at the shot, Mascherano at the near post, comes in short racket.\n40:46 Comment: The ball flies towards the second, Leo Messi inside the area, puts it on the floor, tries to start.\n40:50 Comment: Look for the finishing touch, a cut, he left it behind.\n40:53 Comment: Gabriel Silva takes it, Mascherano goes to the ground, Gabriel Silva takes it out.\n40:57 Comment: Attention to Granada's run, the ball goes to Pereira, Pereira puts it on Digné's back.\n41:3 Comment: The ball goes to Kravets, they have already missed the chance for the surprise.\n41:6 Comment: And the ball returns to Barcelona's control again.\n41:10 Comment: Because Granada is not completely fine with the ball in its possession, but there has been more than one risk taken by the Barcelona players.\n41:23 Comment: They complained to Luis Suárez about a foul by Gabriel Silva.\n41:27 Comment: How's that for 6 of one, half a dozen of another?\n41:30 Comment: I think he beat Luis Suárez to the position there.\n41:32 Comment: They were both holding each other, I get the feeling.\n41:37 Comment: There is arm against arm.\n41:40 Comment: And the referee understood that there was no foul on anyone.\n41:43 Comment: Denis Suárez claimed her for himself.\n41:45 Comment: I'm not liking Barcelona's midfield.\n41:49 Comment: Rakitic has given in, good, good, but on his sides, neither Rafinha nor Suárez are really contributing much.\n41:58 Comment: When we see a good pass, towards the forward, Leo Messi usually sends it.\n42:3 Comment: Instead of being the receiver of a pass, he is the one who is sending them.\n42:6 Comment: We're seeing very little creativity from these two guys.\n42:9 Comment: But positionally I'm seeing Denis Suárez badly.\n42:13 Comment: Luis Suárez is looking for the ball, offside.\n42:17 Comment: He raised the flag at the line due to the Uruguayan's incorrect position.\n42:21 Comment: In the 42nd minute of the first half with 0-0 on the scoreboard.\n42:26 Comment: There we see the advanced position of the Golden Boot.\n42:29 Comment: It's curious, both Suárez and Rafinha occupy tremendously important positions,\n42:37 Comment: where they should have an important role, and they are not having it.\n42:42 Comment: Ball to Gabriel Silva.\n42:44 Comment: Silva plays with Toral.\n42:46 Comment: Toral awaits Silva's arrival on the side.\n42:49 Comment: Toral continues, delivers the ball to the winger, returns the ball back.\n42:52 Comment: Playing for Pereira, who does good coverage.\n42:54 Comment: He touches Uche, he returns the ball, and he goes to the line.\n42:56 Comment: Uche can look the other way.\n42:58 Comment: He plays with Carcela, he goes racquetball and leaves her behind.\n43:1 Comment: But Carcela continues, barely.\n43:3 Comment: Here he receives fouls, which is what Martínez Munuera ends up calling.\n43:7 Comment: And Granada ends the half with its leading role.\n43:12 Comment: Yes, Carcela didn't seem like much, but he is a skilled and dangerous player.\n43:16 Comment: I think it's a pretty disappointing first half in Barcelona, ​​in every sense.\n43:20 Comment: In the sense of the speed of the ball, the pressure, the position.\n43:23 Comment: From some players who are far below the level they should be.\n43:26 Comment: And except for Messi and some details from Sergio Roberto, I think Barça is playing a pretty weak game so far, for me.\n43:34 Comment: Quite the opposite that can exist for Granada, in Lake Nazarí.\n43:38 Comment: There, yes, happiness because things are being done well.\n43:43 Comment: You can't do worse with a foul.\n43:46 Comment: Yes, that is.\n43:48 Comment: Carcela put the pass against Juan's back.\n43:50 Comment: Carcela put the pass against the Barcelona player's back.\n43:54 Comment: Less score a high goal with a foul.\n43:56 Comment: You never know, Michael. Everything can improve.\n43:59 Comment: Saurier took the ball out of bounds and the throw-in went to Barcelona.\n44:5 Comment: You have to think that Luis Enrique is satisfied with the first half.\n44:7 Comment: Another thing is for him to make changes, because we already know that there are many casualties and that the City game is on.\n44:11 Comment: Attention to Sergio Roberto, who tries again on the right wing.\n44:14 Comment: Pereira made an effort to cover Sergio Roberto.\n44:17 Comment: Juan Mascherano plays with Sergio Roberto.\n44:20 Comment: Ball for Denis Suárez. The ball goes back again.\n44:25 Comment: Mascherano's change of orientation. He will arrive with an advantage in principle.\n44:29 Comment: Cuenca lets it pass. Throw-in for Granada.\n44:32 Comment: FC Barcelona has not been any kind of disaster in that first half.\n44:37 Comment: No, no, no. But bland. It's not bland.\n44:41 Comment: How can you say that a FC Barcelona with the football it has plays in a dull way?\n44:45 Comment: Well, they have achieved it.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: The ball

territory prior to the Champions League.\n7:37 Comment: Yes, yes, it's saving effort, isn't it?\n7:40 Comment: Not to lose the whole game.\n7:43 Comment: Even after the goal, already winning the game, logically you can understand a little more.\n7:48 Comment: I think that would have changed it if the second half really progressed a lot and the goal had not scored.\n7:52 Comment: What I'm also not seeing is any spark in the center of the field.\n7:57 Comment: I'm seeing spark without and with the ball.\n8:1 Comment: I'm watching a dull Barça.\n8:4 Comment: I don't like it one bit in the center

which things like this end up happening, it's a Marmoset who really starts the pass.\n8:37 Comment: There he goes with speed, how well Diñé has done now.\n8:40 Comment: He arrived very fair, but he arrived in prison.\n8:43 Comment:  Corner kick.\n8:44 Comment: I insist on the Rakitic issue, although he can play.\n8:47 Comment: In fact he is playing there and he is having a good game.\n8:50

Comment: Do you know what's happening Julian?\n9:16 Comment: When Busquets is there he uses his interiors much more.\n9:20 Comment: He's not doing it.\n9:22 Comment: Either they're not offering or he's not using them.\n9:26 Comment:  Busquets always looks for the closest person.\n9:29 Comment: Or both.\n9:31 Comment: When roles change, things don't work the same for us.\n9:37 Comment: But of course, this team has always had a problem, which is the replacement of Sergio Busquets.\n9:43 Comment: Because in all the years of Sergio Busquets there has not been a Sergio Busquets 2.\n9:47

perhaps.\n10:31 Comment: Yes, because he didn't try to play the ball with his arm.\n10:35 Comment: But it was so clear, so evident that not even he himself protested.\n10:39 Comment: Yes, but that also with the gesture of Lucas Alcaraz, fourth assistant referee.\n10:44 Comment: But yes, the hand is clear.\n10:49 Comment: Sergi Roberto's last steal of the ball.\n10:53 Comment: The ball goes to Leo Messi, who seems to get bored and looks at the creation line.\n10:57 Comment: There he is, holding on against Cravez and scoring a long ball for Neymar.\n11:3 Comment: Cuenca tries it from behind,

Diñé.\n22:33 Comment: He was already standing in an uncomfortable position for the full-back.\n22:36 Comment: When he arrives at speed he obviously has resources, but already stopped and with his back turned.\n22:42 Comment:  It's more complicated.\n22:43 Comment: Throw-in for Granada.\n22:49 Comment: We have already seen a meaningless foul in the first half and already a throw-in.\n22:53 Comment:

fresh.\n25:56 Comment: You need two things.\n25:57 Comment: He needs a standing ovation.\n25:59 Comment: If I were a Granada teammate I would give it to him.\n26:3 Comment: He ran a lot.\n26:4 Comment: And an oxygen bottle.\n26:5 Comment: Very much, yes.\n26:7 Comment: With little participation with the ball.\n26:10 Comment: Kravets leaves exhausted.\n26:12 Comment: We imagine after everything that happened in the game.\n26:14 Comment: Lucas Alcaraz congratulates you.\n26:16 Comment: Of course, David Barral comes in.\n26:18 Comment: And Rakitic is not going to change his position.\n26:19 Comment: He stays where he was and it's André Gómez who is going to play inside.\n26:22 Comment: Kravets' effort has been touching.\n26:26 Comment: I think he played the game in the position he had.\n26:30 Comment: What he asked his coach and what he asked for the match.\n26:32 Comment: Because Granada hasn't had any chances.\n26:34 Comment: He hasn't been able to do much more.\n26:36 Comment: And what he did was give himself a huge beating together with his teammates.\n26:41 Comment: The ball is for a marmoset.\n26:42 Comment: Attention there to the referee who

jumps before the contact reaches him.\n27:22 Comment:  But...\n27:24 Comment: He knows he's coming.\n27:25 Comment: And what is coming is evil.\n27:26 Comment:  Goodness.\n27:28 Comment: I mean, a lot of people will say, no, he's fucking.\n27:30 Comment: Yes, he's jumping because if he stays standing his knee is in trouble.\n27:34 Comment: It is an evasive action.\n27:36 Comment: He's not looking

    "summary": "In a night where the stars of Barcelona were expected to shine brightly, it was an unexpectedly gritty and hard-fought encounter that saw FC Barcelona take on Granada at the Camp Nou. The final scoreline, a narrow 1-0 victory in favor of Barcelona, was a testament to the tight defensive setup of Granada and perhaps hinted at Barcelona looking ahead to their crucial midweek Champions League fixture. \n\nAs the game kicked off, both teams appeared to be feeling each other out, with Barcelona maintaining high possession as expected and Granada looking determined to hold their ground. Early indications suggested it would be a challenging night for Barcelona to break down a well-drilled Granada defense.\n\nFrom the very first whistle, Granada made their intentions clear. They were setup defensively, forming a compact formation with John Toral and Lomban already getting involved in deep defensive duties within the opening five minutes. Kravets, running tirelessly, often found himself at the end of long balls, but without much success against the duo of Umtiti and Mascherano.\n\nFC Barcelona, fielding an altered side with Rakitic playing a role reminiscent of his Sevilla days, had possession but struggled to find the incisive pass. Neymar and Luis Suárez seemed the most involved in the attacking thrusts but were persistently suffocated by Granada’s defensive lines. Neymar, constantly looking for angles through the left, often paired with Accompaniment from Denis Suarez and Rafinha, but the door remained firmly shut.\n\nLuis Enrique's men worked the ball patiently side-to-side but against a diligent Granada side, clear-cut chances were hard to come by. Sergi Roberto, deployed as a right-back, showcased attacking intent by frequently overlapping and almost serving as another winger, yet still failing to break the deadlock. His constant interplay with Messi, though promising, did not initially yield the decisive breakthrough.\n\nAs the minutes ticked away, the story of the first half remained largely unchanged. Barca dominated possession but without effectively piercing through Granada's rear-guard. Granada, on their part, were restricted to counter-attacks, with Uche and Carcela occasionally providing glimpses of what could be, but never seriously threatening Ter Stegen’s goal. It wasn’t a half devoid of creativity though, Messi began to display his flair through numerous innovative passes, but fellow teammates faltered in decisive moments.\n\nHalf-time arrived with the scoreline still goalless, reflecting a bitter struggle for creativity against resilience. Off we went into the second half with some expectation of heightened tempo and increased urgency from Barcelona.\n\nIndeed, the second half started with more verve. Within a matter of minutes, Luis Suarez found himself beautifully set up by Messi inside the box, only for his attempt to lapse into misunderstanding as Granada's defenders closed in. Neymar, an ever-present nuisance, cut in somber reliance on his trickery to provide the breakthrough.\n\nThe pivotal moment arrived in the 48th minute. It was Messi yet again initiating the pivotal attack, threading the kind of ball only he could envisage to enable Suarez to get a strike on target which was blocked, but from the rebound Rafinha acrobatically scissor-kicked the ball into the net. It wasn’t the prettiest of goals; it belied the struggle and perseverance of the half, but it was sufficient. Rafinha’s finish was a reflection of seizing the moment in a crowded penalty area, giving Barcelona the lead they desperately sought.\n\nThe goal seemed to inject confidence into Barcelona’s play, and they shifted into a higher gear. Despite greater possession and resolute attacking attempts, further goals eluded them. Luis Suarez, on several occasions, found himself in promising positions but luck was not on his side as shots went wayward or were comfortably handled by Ochoa. \n\nDefensively, however, the Catalans remained largely untroubled. Granada’s ability to execute counter-attacks diminished progressively. Kravets, noteworthy for his relentless running, was subbed off for David Barral who faced the same isolation upfront.\n\nChanges followed from both managers, Andre Gomes came in for Dennis Suarez to provide additional legs in the midfield. Granada introduced Samper, a Barcelona loanee, intending to add more solidity and dynamism.\n\nAs the match progressed into the final third, Barcelona held a firm grip on possession but were notably playing with an eye on conservation, looking cautiously ahead to their midweek Champions League fixture. Messi's brilliance emerged sporadically, casting long shadows on Granada's defense but nothing manifesting a second goal. Suarez, haunted by an uncharacteristic profligacy, was substituted for Paco Alcácer.\n\nIn the dying minutes, Granada, though visibly spent, mustered their final push. It was more about bravery and hope than orchestrated strategy. Spurred by the introduction of Boga, they attempted set-piece situations but often lacked the quality to convert these into tangible threats. \n\nTime and again, barrages of relentless pressing ensured Barcelona maintained territorial control, despite their inability to expand the lead. A late collision between Neymar and Bezo resulted in a booking for both, painting a picture of the intense fight Granada brought into the game.\n\nUltimately, the referees’ whistle blew to confirm Barcelona’s victory. It was a game that underlined perseverance, tactical discipline, and flashes of brilliance. The Catalans may have won but it was not without acknowledgments to the stubborn defensive masterclass brought by Granada. Rafinha’s goal remained the solitary decisive moment, leading Barcelona to narrowly eke out three invaluable points. \n\nReflecting upon the game, Luis Enrique would surely have mixed feelings. On one hand, his team maintained composure to secure victory; on the other, the level of performance and execution left areas to ponder, especially with the looming critical encounters ahead in the Champions League fixtures. The diligent Granada, though defeated, could take solace in their steely rearguard action and resoluteness which, if built upon, could yield voluble dividends as their season progresses."
