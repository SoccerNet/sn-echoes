totally free of mark.\n3:15 Comment: Ricardo, you were wondering how it was possible that that ball had not entered,\n3:18 Comment: because attending to the decision of Fernández Valbalán, it seemed that no one had touched that ball.\n3:23 Comment: But it is a sensational stop by Cuellar.\n3:25 Comment: A sensational stop, in fact, Nacho had already taken a step to shout the goal, he had seen it inside.\n3:33 Comment: And the lack of Nacho now, with that yellow card, which is known,\n3:38 Comment: that he has four amnesties, it is known in the Molineon stands, that is why he protests with such intensity.\n3:44 Comment: Well, Cuellar's action, I can tell you that he was practically in the line judge's vision,\n3:49 Comment: and meanwhile, footballer, I have not even been able to appreciate that Cuellar had saved that ball,\n3:54 Comment: but Nacho claimed it with such intensity for something, for what has been seen in the repetition.\n4:0 Comment: He puts it in the area, he extends Babén, there is the shot.\n4:4 Comment: Goal!\n4:14 Comment: From Sporting in the 49, goal from Mikel Vesga.\n4:18 Comment: Strategic action with the ball, straight to the area, so that Babén extends,\n4:22 Comment: and he appears making his height count.\n4:25 Comment: Mikel Vesga, to connect that shot in parabola that exceeds Casillas,\n4:30 Comment: and puts Sporting ahead again.\n4:33 Comment: Goal, rojiblanco, Vesga scores.\n4:36 Comment: Sporting 2, Real Madrid 1.\n4:39 Comment: Well, it's a great goal, which seems more casual than anything else.\n4:46 Comment: Here Vesga wins, very clearly, he returns it inwards,\n4:50 Comment: but this header from Vesga, totally rained, and lands behind Casillas, is surprising.\n4:59 Comment: A tremendous degree of effectiveness in Sporting,\n5:3 Comment: which at the beginning of both times has been able to advance in the scoreboard.\n5:8 Comment: Well, very interesting now to see the response of Real Madrid,\n5:11 Comment: which have to increase the pace of play, which have to increase the ability to generate danger,\n5:19 Comment: and not only through the centre.\n5:21 Comment: Well, it's Vesga's first goal with the Sporting shirt,\n5:24 Comment: and Vesga's first goal in the first division in LaLiga Santander.\n5:28 Comment: And he has done it in this start of the second half, to celebrate the Molinelli,\n5:32 Comment: and above all, to celebrate the bench, among all the technicians,\n5:36 Comment: pointing out that the strategy has worked, the touch from Babén,\n5:40 Comment: the shot from Vesga, Sporting is ahead,\n5:43 Comment: and is forced to come back to Real Madrid.\n5:45 Comment: Let's not forget that Vesga was also the one who gave the pass of the first goal,\n5:50 Comment: a really superb pass, that one had nothing casual.\n5:54 Comment: The player of Vitoria is completing an extraordinary game,\n5:59 Comment: and it is perhaps the first reason why Sporting has won this game.\n6:5 Comment: Jorge, you anticipated that in the second half we would see more things,\n6:8 Comment: in just four minutes we have seen everything.\n6:10 Comment: We have seen everything.\n6:12 Comment: Real Madrid deserved the second with that action from Nacho,\n6:14 Comment: Sporting managed to do it with this double header that was nailed in the corner behind a box\n6:26 Comment: that was a little ahead, as is their obligation, on the other hand.\n6:29 Comment: There is nothing to reproach.\n6:45 Comment: Yes, that's what he has pointed out with that action,\n6:49 Comment: with the ball that Real Madrid are already playing,\n6:52 Comment: which is evidently starting to get in the way of Morata's game.\n7:14 Comment: Baben returns it very well inwards.\n7:19 Comment: He hits it with the top of his head,\n7:23 Comment: he changes the ball,\n7:27 Comment: which falls behind the box like a dry leaf.\n7:44 Comment: Trompicones, the team of Rubi,\n7:51 Comment: Real Madrid counterattack again,\n7:53 Comment: and they respond immediately with this performance from Lucas.\n7:58 Comment: Lucas looking for Isco, he controls it with his thigh,\n8:1 Comment: Isco is profiled, James asks for it,\n8:3 Comment: Lucas fell on the front, James hits it,\n8:6 Comment: Pichu Cuellar catches it with tremendous security.\n8:9 Comment: It is the first time that James has tried from a distance,\n8:12 Comment: it is what we missed from his game in the first half.\n8:16 Comment: He had a high number of interventions,\n8:19 Comment: always in three quarters of the field,\n8:21 Comment: he practically did not lose any ball,\n8:23 Comment: but what is needed from James is that connection with the opposite goal.\n8:28 Comment: I think the need is going to cause him,\n8:32 Comment: that Asensio, in this second half,\n8:36 Comment: they put a little more speed\n8:39 Comment: to the game of Real Madrid in the last 25 meters.\n8:43 Comment: James delivers for Coentrao.\n8:52 Comment: Ramos.\n8:57 Comment: Danilo receives it on the right,\n8:59 Comment: he cuts it short for James Rodríguez.\n9:1 Comment: Lucas, good step to leave Sergio Álvarez behind.\n9:5 Comment: Isco, he insists on the right, the Zidane team.\n9:9 Comment: James, deep ball, Danilo runs,\n9:10 Comment: the advantage is for Jorge Mene, who takes it off him.\n9:14 Comment: Duje, Chop and Nacho fight.\n9:16 Comment: Ball again for Real Madrid.\n9:20 Comment: Asensio.\n9:26 Comment: Coentrao, short for Sergio Ramos.\n9:29 Comment: James receives it, he got in the way with Isco,\n9:32 Comment: he ends up losing the white team.\n9:34 Comment: Ball above Isma López.\n9:36 Comment: Nacho, Duje, Chop.\n9:39 Comment: Marcelo goes.\n9:41 Comment: Danilo.\n9:45 Comment: Short for Lucas.\n9:48 Comment: Mateo Kovacic.\n9:51 Comment: The Croatian advances, tries to put an inside ball\n9:53 Comment: over Lucas' free kick.\n9:55 Comment: He cleared the defence of Sporting.\n10:1 Comment: Isco's control is lost,\n10:3 Comment: the possibility for Real Madrid is taken out\n10:6 Comment: for Isma López.\n10:7 Comment: He's ready, he's got the shirt on,\n10:10 Comment: Marcelo.\n10:12 Comment: Jorge Valdano spoke about the one hour break\n10:14 Comment: Marcelo could have.\n10:16 Comment: It'll be 55 minutes as soon as the ball comes out again\n10:19 Comment: because Sporting will put the ball in play.\n10:21 Comment: I imagine Fabio Coentrao will be the one to be taken out\n10:24 Comment: so that the Brazilian can come back in.\n10:27 Comment: He's not getting out of the way,\n10:28 Comment: we'll see why the fourth referee is there.\n10:30 Comment: It'll still have to be another one for Marcelo to come in.\n10:35 Comment: Nacho.\n10:36 Comment: It has to be said that beyond fatigue,\n10:37 Comment: it's good for Real Madrid that Marcelo\n10:39 Comment: comes on and starts to give the team\n10:43 Comment: the imagination they've been looking for\n10:46 Comment: in the last 25 metres.\n10:50 Comment: Marcelo usually does that\n10:53 Comment: every time he goes on.\n10:57 Comment: Danilo.\n11:0 Comment: Isco's footsteps,\n11:2

    "summary": "In an electrifying encounter at El Molinón, Real Madrid managed to edge out Sporting Gijón with a thrilling 3-2 victory, filled with tactical nuances, individual brilliance, and dramatic swings in momentum. This La Liga fixture was pivotal for both sides, with Madrid chasing the title and Sporting fighting to avoid relegation, and it lived up to every bit of the anticipation.\n\nAs the game commenced, Real Madrid looked to assert their dominance by controlling possession early on. Isco Alarcón was instrumental from the first whistle, frequently playing through Sergio Ramos, Marco Asensio, and the always dynamic James Rodríguez. The early phases saw Madrid building from the back, with Danilo often advancing, pressured by Moi Gómez on Sporting’s side. Sporting, on their part, set up a staunch defensive structure, a five-man backline that manager Rubi meticulously orchestrated to keep the visitors at bay.\n\nThe game quickly settled into a pattern with Real Madrid pressing high and Sporting looking to disrupt and counter. Real's defense, marshaled by Sergio Ramos, and their midfield, with Kovacic pulling strings alongside Casemiro, were constantly involved in recycling possession and probing through balls. Fabio Coentrao, starting in a rare appearance, showed early promise with an overlapping run and cross that ultimately fizzled out without causing much trouble.\n\nIt was, however, Sporting who struck first in the 13th minute, exploiting the gaps left by Madrid's high defensive line. Mikel Vesga orchestrated the breakthrough, delivering a delightful chip over the defense to Duje Cop, who coolly finished past Kiko Casilla. It was Sporting’s direct play that paid dividends, with precise long balls that caught Madrid’s high-pressing midfield off guard.\n\nReal Madrid responded with characteristic resilience and ingenuity, with Isco particularly showcasing his dribbling prowess and vision. Moving deftly through Sporting’s midfield, he linked up effectively with Lucas Vázquez and Asensio, who cut in from wide positions. Just seven minutes after conceding, Isco produced a moment of individual brilliance. In a congested penalty area, he danced past multiple defenders, displaying exquisite close control before slotting a pinpoint shot into the corner, leaving Cuéllar rooted. The score was now level at 1-1, thanks to a goal that epitomized Isco’s flair and finesse.\n\nAs the first half progressed, both sides had their moments. Sporting tried to retain their shape and counter strategically, with Carmona and Moi Gómez active on the wings, supporting Duje Cop upfront. Their forays were met with varying success as Real Madrid's defense alternated between moments of alertness and vulnerability. The interplay and incisiveness from Real, especially through Morata and Lucas Vázquez, often managed to carve out half-chances, with Nacho also making a significant contribution from the back to thwart Sporting’s counters.\n\nSporting’s strategy remained clear – to build from the back occasionally but largely to rely on direct play to exploit spaces behind Madrid's advanced defenders. Such a strategy brought another opportunity for Sporting, and it was Vesga again who capitalized early in the second half. Just minutes after the restart, a throw-in resulted in a flick from Babén, and Vesga, utilizing his height, placed a looping header past an outstretched Casilla. The goal seemed straightforward but was a testament to Sporting’s effective and trenchant use of set-pieces. The scoreline now read 2-1 in favor of Sporting.\n\nMadrid’s need to chase the game brought Marcelo into the fray, replacing Coentrao, enhancing the side’s offensive dimension. The Brazilian was immediately involved, adding width and depth to Madrid's attack. Real Madrid’s tactical adjustments began to reap the desired results as their possession play started creating more clear-cut chances. Asensio and James tried to impose more pace and urgency, stretching Sporting’s organized defense.\n\nIn the 59th minute, Real Madrid found the equalizer through Álvaro Morata. Danilo, advancing down the right flank, delivered a measured cross to the far post where Morata, timing his leap perfectly, directed his header down into the net. It was a textbook finish, showcasing Morata's aerial prowess and Danilo’s well-crafted service.\n\nThe remainder of the game saw Real Madrid pressing hard for the winner. Isco continued to be the lynchpin, acting as the main conduit through which attacks flowed. His dribbles, turns, and passes created several perilous situations for Sporting’s defense. Mariano Díaz was brought on to partner Morata upfront, giving Madrid a more robust attacking presence.\n\nDespite the relentless pressure from Madrid, Sporting's defense, fortified by the likes of Babén and Mere, held firm, repelling wave after wave of attack. However, Sporting’s occasionally sloppy play invited unnecessary pressure, culminating in fouls around the box which Madrid looked to capitalize on with their set-piece takers, James and Isco.\n\nThe dying minutes of the match were a microcosm of the entire game - Madrid’s persistence against Sporting's defiant defense. And it was in the 90th minute that Isco once again demonstrated why he was the standout performer. Picking up the ball on the edge of the area, he found just enough space to unleash a low-driven shot into the corner of the net, sealing a dramatic victory for Los Blancos. His celebration was as much a display of relief as it was a testament to his critical role in securing the three points.\n\nIn essence, the clash was a riveting display of tactical chess, moments of individual skill, and sheer determination. Sporting Gijón showcased commendable tactical discipline, sharp counter-attacks, and aerial prowess, making the most of their limited opportunities. On the other hand, Real Madrid exemplified a blend of resilience, tactical versatility, and technical brilliance, particularly through Isco’s phenomenal performance. His two goals not only highlighted his intrinsic quality but also underscored the importance of individual brilliance in critical moments, driving Madrid to an arduous but crucial win.\n\nGiven the broader context of their championship aspirations, this win was a compelling reminder of Madrid’s never-say-die spirit and the depth of talent that Zinedine Zidane had at his disposal, even without some of his prominent stars like Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale. The victory ensured that Real Madrid kept pace in the tight La Liga title race and demonstrated their ability to grind out results under pressure, a trait indispensable for title contenders. Sporting, despite the loss, could take heart from their spirited performance and tactical adherence, hoping to build on such displays in their battle against relegation."
