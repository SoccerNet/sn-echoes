    "summary": "In a thrilling encounter at their home ground, Alaves hosted Real in a match that saw an exciting clash between the two teams, characterized by quick exchanges of possession, strategic plays, and a deluge of goals. The game culminated in a resounding 4-1 victory for Real, displaying their clinical finishing and tactical superiority despite a spirited initial display by Alaves.\n\nFrom the kickoff, Real demonstrated their intention to dominate, but the match opened with a series of throw-ins and clearances. These early minutes were marked by a struggle to control the flow of the game, with Alaves and Real both navigating the pressure evident in each side's attempts to establish control. Real took the kickoff at 00:00, but just 21 seconds into the game, the ball went out of play, leading to their first throw-in at 00:25. Over the next few minutes, Real maintained possession, but Alaves's compact defensive lines thwarted early attempts to advance, leading to several throw-ins, clearances, and minor fouls disrupting the rhythm of play.\n\nAlaves made their first significant move in the sixth minute, with a rapid counterattack culminating in a shot on target. The home crowd erupted as Alaves capitalized on this momentum, breaking through Real's defense. The goal, hammered in at 06:49, was a testament to their aggressive forward play. With the scoreboard flashing 1-0, Real found themselves on the backfoot early in the game. They quickly regrouped and restarted at 07:58, but ball-out-of-play events and throw-ins kept the play disjointed, indicative of the frantic pace and tight marking from both teams.\n\nReal's persistence paid off as they leveled the scores at 16:15, following a foul in the Alaves box which resulted in a well-executed penalty. The equalizer came after sustained pressure from Real, including multiple shots on target and a direct free-kick at 15:16 after a foul by Alaves that earned the player a yellow card at 15:23. This marked a turning point in the match, as Real's composure and strategic execution began to shine through.\n\nAs the first half progressed, the tempo remained high with incessant challenges, clearances, and fouls interrupting the flow. Both teams engaged in a fierce battle for supremacy, marked by meticulous defensive play and attempts to outmaneuver each other. At 23:16, Real made an early substitution, a tactical move aimed at injecting fresh energy and altering the dynamic on the pitch. Real's attacking prowess was further evidenced when they took the lead at 32:43 through a clinical finish past the Alaves goalkeeper. The goal followed another spell of relentless pressure and a successful clearance at 32:09, highlighting Real’s dominance and finding spaces behind the Alaves defense.\n\nDespite trailing, Alaves refused to relent, showing resilience and determination to claw back into the game. Their offensive efforts, however, were repeatedly stifled by Real’s organized defense and timely clearances. The first half was punctuated with instances of ball-out-of-play, throw-ins, and both teams vying for control. Real's tactical discipline allowed them to weather the Alaves attacks while continuously probing for opportunities to extend their lead.\n\nAs the teams went into the break with the scoreline at 2-1 in favor of Real, the match was far from decided. Alaves kicked off the second half at 00:00, again trying to reclaim control and create scoring opportunities. Within 30 seconds, they had a shot on target, signaling their intent. However, their subsequent attempts either went off target or were thwarted by the vigilant Real defense. This phase involved frequent throw-ins and clearances, indicating the high stakes and pressure surrounding each possession.\n\nThe match continued in this vein, with Alaves producing a concerted offensive effort, yet falling short in the final third. Real, maintaining their defensive solidity, capitalized on the mistakes through organized counter-attacks and strategic plays. Yellow cards and indirect free-kicks peppered the half as both sides committed fouls in their bid to assert dominance. Real’s discipline was tested but remained steadfast, and at 33:25 they were rewarded another penalty kick, neatly converted to extend their lead to 3-1.\n\nAlaves, visibly under pressure, made substitutions at 16:45 and 20:56 in a bid to rejuvenate their attacking threats and alter the match's momentum. Real also made key substitutions at 21:03 and 41:18, with an eye on bolstering their defense and seeing out the match. The game was characterized by relentless hustle, aggressive interceptions, and tactical fouls leading to multiple yellow cards.\n\nReal’s superior ball control and well-coordinated team play came to the fore once again at 38:27 with another goal increasing their lead to 4-1. This goal, arriving after a well-executed play, underscored their tactical prowess and ability to exploit openings in the Alaves defense. Alaves's attempts to respond were spirited but ultimately fell short against a resolute Real defense.\n\nReal’s ability to shift gears and control the action, particularly in the second half, ensured they remained in the driver's seat. Their strategic plays, combined with the clinical finish, conveyed their dominance. Despite Alaves's constant pressure and attempts to turn the tide, Real maintained their composure and discipline, culminating in a resounding win.\n\nIn the minutes that followed, the game saw a series of clearances, throw-ins, and corners as Alaves frantically sought a way back. Real comfortably thwarted these attempts, maintaining their defensive structure and managing the game until the final whistle.\n\nThe final score of Alaves 1 - 4 Real reflects a well-fought contest where ultimately, Real's tactical discipline, efficient ball management, and clinical finishing won the day. Alaves, despite their early promise and resilience, were outmaneuvered by a superior and well-organized Real team. This match will be remembered for the swift changes in momentum, tactical battles across the pitch, and the sheer determination shown by both teams in their quest for victory."
