active in the second half much more than in the first, with a large number of interventions, playing more as a midfielder than as a forward, but trying to participate in the team's attacking play.\n15:26 Comment: The yellow for Bale is the fourth of the match, the first for a Real Madrid player.\n15:30 Comment: The change at Deportivo Alavés is already prepared.\n15:33 Comment: Before,

the situation.\n16:8 Comment: He didn't have many other options, he was very alone, very surrounded, but he showed his ability there.\n16:15 Comment: In that situation, the pipe was not at all a frivolity but a resource, almost the only way out.\n16:19 Comment: Almost a necessity.\n16:21 Comment: Kiko Femenía in the center for Dani Torres.\n16:25 Comment: Kiko goes up again, Marcelo stops

playing field.\n20:34 Comment: The Alavés forward helps the Real Madrid centre-back get up.\n20:39 Comment: So nothing happens here.\n20:41 Comment: I also think that De Iverson knows that he has a yellow card.\n20:45 Comment: It will prevent him from playing the next game with his team.\n20:48 Comment: And what he doesn't want is to take someone else away for protesting.\n20:51 Comment: Well, the referee also knows that he had the yellow card.\n20:55 Comment: Edgar leaves for Alavés.\n20:59 Comment: The one who enters the field of play.\n21:0 Comment: It's Katay.\n21:1 Comment: The one leaving Real Madrid is Karim Benzema.\n21:4 Comment: The one who takes his place is Álvaro Morata.\n21:6 Comment: He comes from scoring two goals against the cultural team from Leon.\n21:9 Comment: But he also comes from scoring in Atlético de Bilbao's last League game.\n21:13 Comment: In that match that had the white team so stuck at the Santiago Bernabéu.\n21:17 Comment: Benzema is having a hard time connecting to the game.\n21:20 Comment: Player that Real Madrid needs to find clarity especially in their attacking maneuvers.\n21:29 Comment: And what comes in.\n21:30 Comment: It's pure enthusiasm.\n21:31 Comment: A more mature player every day.\n21:34 Comment: He gives Real Madrid a tremendous contribution of energy when he is on the field.\n21:40 Comment: It is Zidane's

result.\n22:10 Comment: The same as at rest.\n22:11 Comment: Real Madrid wins 1-2.\n22:12 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo double.\n22:13 Comment: From Iverson.\n22:14 Comment: He scored first for Deportivo Alavés.\n22:15 Comment: The clear lack of Raúl García.\n22:16 Comment: The foul on Morata in the Real Madrid attacker's first participation.\n22:17 Comment: That he had covered the first game.\n22:18

first participation\n22:26 Comment: of the Real Madrid attacker.\n22:29 Comment: Morata had covered the ball well\n22:31 Comment: and there was little chance of stopping it\n22:35 Comment: if not it was outside the regulations.\n22:41 Comment: Toni Kroos.\n22:44 Comment: Ronaldo first for Nacho.\n22:50 Comment: It is due to Rampara Danilo.\n22:54 Comment: Press Cabarasa.\n22:56 Comment: Now it is Deverson who makes Nacho's job difficult.\n22:59 Comment: Completes the opening of the Madrid youth squad.\n23:1 Comment: Long ball looking for Morata's run.\n23:3 Comment: The rejection falls to Isco.\n23:5 Comment: Good maneuver by Isco who tries to enable Gareth Bale.\n23:8 Comment: It will be forced but Bale will arrive facing Raúl García.\n23:11 Comment: Danilo asks for it.\n23:13 Comment: There appears the Brazilian who can center.\n23:15 Comment: There are four white shirts inside the area.\n23:17 Comment: Danilo plays for Kroos.\n23:18 Comment: Deverson arrives and involuntarily\n23:20 Comment: completes the opening for Bale.\n23:22 Comment: Bale facing Teo.\n23:25 Comment: Play horizontally.\n23:26 Comment: Turn for Marcelo.\n23:28 Comment: Marcelo changes pace.\n23:29 Comment: Try to escape from Kiko Femenía.\n23:30 Comment: He puts it for Morata.\n23:32 Comment: The rejection falls on Bale.\n23:33 Comment: Kovacic prepares the shot.\n23:35 Comment: But Kristicic arrives in time to take the ball away.\n23:38 Comment: However, Real Madrid insists.\n23:39 Comment: Good maneuver.\n23:40 Comment: Kovacic crosses.\n23:41 Comment: Here comes Cristiano.\n23:42 Comment: Above.\n23:43 Comment: Above is Cristiano Ronaldo's chromatic shot.\n23:47 Comment: Real Madrid's third could have been there.\n23:49 Comment: Jorge.\n23:49 Comment: Well.\n23:50 Comment: Ask Nacho how to do it.\n23:51 Comment: It doesn't cost you anything.\n23:52 Comment: He is a teammate.\n23:55 Comment: He settled in well for the shot.\n23:56 Comment: I didn't have many alternatives.\n24:0 Comment: And well.\n24:1 Comment: The shot went wide.\n24:4 Comment: Kovacic's cross was very good.\n24:7 Comment: In one of the few danger approaches\n24:9 Comment: that Real Madrid has had in this second half.\n24:15 Comment: It's up to Deportivo to propose at the same time.\n24:20 Comment: The appearance of Katay.\n24:22 Comment: Katay tries to get between two.\n24:23 Comment: Keep going Katay.\n24:24 Comment: He fails to associate with Deiberson.\n24:26 Comment: It bounced and fell to Marcelo.\n24:29 Comment: Marcelo tries to change everything.\n24:34 Comment: The rebounded ball fell to Morata.\n24:37 Comment: Alexis prevails.\n24:38 Comment: Camarasa.\n24:38 Comment: Deiberson.\n24:40 Comment: Holding on and leaning on Kiko Femenia.\n24:44

goes to Keylor Navas.\n25:11 Comment: We are already in the last 20 minutes of regulation time.\n25:14 Comment: He started with a lot of presence near the rival goal.\n25:20 Comment: Deportivo Alavés had two opportunities practically in the first minute of the game.\n25:24 Comment: The rhythm and frequency of that offensive production has been decreasing on the part of both teams.\n25:29 Comment: But I suppose, Jorge, that as the final stretch of the game approaches, all this will gain another gear.\n25:35 Comment: Yes, it is assumed.\n25:36 Comment: The thing is that Alavés has lost a bit of freshness.\n25:41 Comment: And with the freshness it has also lost precision.\n25:44 Comment: On the other hand, Real Madrid feels comfortable with the result.\n25:48 Comment: He doesn't want to lose order.\n25:50 Comment: And that makes them a more cautious team.\n25:53 Comment: Good ball from Ronaldo.\n25:54 Comment: Morata wants it for the third.\n25:55 Comment: Suhaïr Fethal arrives first to take the ball for a corner.\n25:59 Comment: Morata now attacks the spaces with more determination.\n26:3 Comment: And that logically produces at least more sense of danger in Real Madrid.\n26:15 Comment: Prepared to execute Toni Kroos.\n26:18 Comment: Who has had much more today.\n26:19 Comment: And much less prominence than usual in the team's game.\n26:23 Comment: They have brought up Nacho Ibarán to look for the finishing touch.\n26:25 Comment: Kroos puts it at the near post.\n26:27 Comment: Deiversson prevails.\n26:30 Comment: Kovacic assures.\n26:31 Comment: Back for Danilo.\n26:32 Comment: And this one even further back for Keylor Navas.\n26:40 Comment: Ibarán head extension.\n26:43 Comment: Raul Garcia.\n26:46 Comment: Play for the team.\n26:47 Comment: And the goal.\n26:48 Comment: Come on!\n26:49 Comment: Morata takes it.\n26:50 Comment: Fethal.\n26:51 Comment: Kiko Femenía was only asking for it on the right.\n26:54 Comment: The Moroccan center back from Deportivo Alavés insisted on the other side.\n26:57 Comment: And there we have Teo who in the first half had a tremendous role in the game.\n27:2 Comment: Alavés attack.\n27:3 Comment: And that in the second half he found practically no possibilities for his change of\n27:10 Comment: rhythm.\n27:11 Comment: Because Real Madrid has blocked his way.\n27:14 Comment: I knew there was a hemorrhage there that had to be stopped.\n27:15 Comment: And in the second half there were practically no possibilities for their change of pace.\n27:16 Comment: Because Real Madrid has blocked his way.\n27:17 Comment: And in the second half he had practically no chances.\n27:18 Comment: There we have it.\n27:19 Comment: There is Teo Hernández.\n27:20 Comment: Deiberson moves ahead.\n27:21 Comment: They are looking for him.\n27:22 Comment: Deiberson.\n27:23 Comment: Keylor arrives first.\n27:24 Comment: Keylor Navas arrives first in action.\n27:25 Comment: Ricardo Invalidated.\n27:26 Comment: Yes, there was offside.\n27:27 Comment: He had raised the flag online.\n27:28 Comment: Keylor Navas complains about this action with Deiberson.\n27:29 Comment: The Brazilian striker fought until the end.\n27:30 Comment: Real Madrid's Costa Rican goalkeeper has suffered a blow to his knee.\n27:31 Comment: And Sánchez Martínez who asks for the assistance.\n27:32 Comment: The idea is that the Costa Rican goalkeeper from Madrid stays on the knee.\n27:33 Comment: And Sánchez Martínez who asks for the assistance.\n27:34 Comment: The entrance of the Real Madrid doctors because the goalkeeper is still lying on the\n27:35 Comment: Mendizorroza grass.\n27:36 Comment: Always play with fire Deiberson.\n27:37 Comment: There was a play where he had stuck out his elbow in front of Nacho.\n27:38 Comment: Now there is the top player.\n27:39 Comment: And he continues with a knee blow.\n27:40 Comment: It must be taken into account that the Real Madrid player is very intelligent.\n27:41 Comment: And now the top player of the battle.\n27:42 Comment: And now the battle player.\n27:43 Comment: But the battle player is very smart.\n27:44 Comment: And listening to the player is very intelligent.\n27:45 Comment: And now the battle player.\n27:46 Comment: At the top it has been left with the Mendizorroza grass.\n27:47 Comment: entrance of the Real Madrid doctors because the goalkeeper is still lying on the grass\n27:53 Comment: Mendizorroza. He always plays with Davidson fire. There was a play where he had stuck out his elbow\n28:1 Comment: in front of Nacho. Now here he is going to fight for a ball that was clearly lost. As if I forgot\n28:9 Comment: that he has a yellow card and that he should be a little more cautious. It was also offside.\n28:17 Comment: The Guinier had raised the flag. Take advantage of Cristiano, Isco, Kroos, Nacho to come to\n28:25 Comment: refresh. Now also Kovacic, Gareth Bale and in the case of Cristiano to speak with Zinedine Zidane\n28:31 Comment: exchange opinions in the technical area. The French coach extends the conversation with Real Madrid's number 7.\n28:43 Comment: He made a face as if to say, I don't know.\n28:46 Comment: But something...\n28:47 Comment: Obviously with his hand in his mouth it is impossible to know what he may be saying but the conversation right now between Zinedine Zidane and Cristiano Ronaldo at the moment when Keylor Navas has recovered and the Costa Rican goalkeeper is going to put the ball into play of Real Madrid.\n29:2 Comment: Just a few seconds ago Davidson was apologizing to Keylor since the Costa Rican was already recovered in that action in which it seemed that Davidson had no chance of arriving. Although let's not forget the play is invalidated but it seemed that the position of...\n29:17 Comment: From Davidson of Arras. Whatever the case, Keylor Navas arrived before the Brazilian AVE attacker. Mendizorroza is played again on the way to the last 15 minutes of the game.\n29:27 Comment: It's strange how practically the entire Real Madrid team has gone to the sidelines to drink. It's like they felt very tired and that has to do with the somewhat flat pace of the game. It's funny because it's been a great day but...\n29:44 Comment: The thermometer has risen to 23:00.\n29:47 Comment: 23.00, 24.00 degrees, no more. However, there are many players who show signs of fatigue.\n29:56 Comment: It is not as hot as the first few days in those games at the Bernabéu nor is the temperature in this area at this time of year enough to be too hot. Nor is it that the sun has been shining on the playing field for a long time.\n30:13 Comment: Toni Kroos.\n30:17 Comment: Short for Rafael Varane.\n30:26 Comment: Varane delivers for Kovacic. This Sisko and this Danilo.\n30:33 Comment: Zinedine Zidane's team plays and plays, fleeing from haste, against an Alaves team that right there, as soon as the ball enters the half of the field they are defending, is when they start to put pressure. Not before.\n30:47 Comment: It seemed that Deportivo Alaves had won the throw-in. In fact, Pelegrino's annoyance, who was very much on top of Ricardo's play, is tremendous.\n30:54 Comment: Yeah.\n30:54 Comment: Oh well, they kicked him out.\n30:55 Comment: He expels it. Yes, because of the protest. Sánchez Martínez tells him that he is expelling him. Pelegrino who insists on the claim to the Murcian referee.\n31:4 Comment: It must be remembered that one of his assistants already sent him off in the first half when that penalty action was claimed against Deiverson in the first half.\n31:13 Comment: Well, Pelegrino is leaving.\n31:15 Comment: Second sent off on the bench of...\n31:17 Comment: Victorian ensemble.\n31:18 Comment: The expulsion frankly seems excessive to me. He made a protest because he thought the throw-in was going the other way but it was neither offensive nor aggressive enough to merit sending off.\n31:33 Comment: They have no idea where the story comes from because we have already played 76 minutes of the game and we have not been 100% aware of this, but in relation to that last play, which is the one that ends up motivating the expulsion, it didn't seem like it.\n31:43 Comment: It seemed very little for such an extreme decision.\n31:47 Comment: Danilo prepares the cross, places it looking for Bale, Fedal clears it. Isco appears on the front.\n31:54 Comment: Real Madrid looks more complete than Deportivo.\n31:56 Comment: Another one inside Marcelo, he was very good, Alexis puts his head in. He is a corner for Real Madrid.\n32:2 Comment: I take this opportunity to quickly say about that action that you mentioned about the expulsion.\n32:6 Comment: The linesman has the flag held in his right hand to signal a throw-in in favor of Alavés.\n32:12 Comment: And in conversation with Sánchez Martínez what he does is change hands.\n32:17 Comment: The referee sees a throw-in in favor of Real Madrid and that causes Pellegrín's protest.\n32:21 Comment: And the referee is wrong.\n32:26 Comment: Kroos throws to the near post, there is a fall that passes, penalty.\n32:30 Comment: There is a penalty, there is a penalty in favor of Real Madrid, a penalty against Cristiano Ronaldo.\n32:37 Comment: The Deportivo players protest at the same time, there are penalties for the second of the game.\n32:42 Comment: Ronaldo fell inside the area, we have to see it again.\n32:45 Comment: I was at the penalty spot.\n32:47 Comment: The Portuguese footballer who ended up on the ground paired, I haven't seen clearly who.\n32:51 Comment: And the public applauds, applauds, especially from that area, from that background, the referee's decision in an obviously ironic way.\n32:59 Comment: After the second penalty that Sánchez Martínez has awarded in favor of Real Madrid today.\n33:4 Comment: And what causes, well, that little song with hands up, this is a robbery, this is what Mendy Zorroza is singing right now.\n33:11 Comment: After that penalty that Cristiano is going to try to convert.\n33:14 Comment: Penalty from Manu Torres, or rather Dani Torres, is indicated.\n33:17 Comment: About Cristiano Ronaldo.\n33:18 Comment: We will analyze it immediately, first the live one because the launch is going to take place now.\n33:22 Comment: And it could be the sentence for Real Madrid.\n33:24 Comment: Ronaldo is going to hit him, Ronaldo.\n33:27 Comment: Pacheco has covered up, Pacheco has covered up.\n33:30 Comment: Pacheco blocked Cristiano Ronaldo's shot.\n33:34 Comment: The Mendy Zorroza match remains more than open.\n33:36 Comment: Well the penalty was a penalty, Cristiano was clearly grabbed by the shirt in the corner.\n33:44 Comment: Now we are going to be very attentive because if this referee whistles.\n33:47 Comment: All these penalties that are inside the area.\n33:50 Comment: Well, we are going to have a lot of fun this year because he will surely have to take 3 or 4 penalties per game.\n33:56 Comment: Very good save by Pacheco against Cristiano's shot.\n34:0 Comment: Spectacular hand from the Extremaduran goalkeeper.\n34:4 Comment: Going down, putting his strong arm to block Ronaldo's shot.\n34:8 Comment: There is an Alavés player lying on the pitch, Ricardo.\n34:11 Comment: And they demand an action from Danilo in which he can put the iron.\n34:15 Comment: From here he doesn't appreciate it.\n34:17 Comment: There is Maria for protesting.\n34:18 Comment: For Kiko Femenía.\n34:20 Comment: But the action was a divided ball to which Danilo could arrive late.\n34:24 Comment: You may need it.\n34:26 Comment: It can even do a lot of damage to the Alavés footballer who remains lying on the pitch.\n34:31 Comment: The action continues.\n34:33 Comment: The man who stands up right now.\n34:35 Comment: I think it's Cristi Cic.\n34:38 Comment: And he is the one who took Danilo's fault.\n34:40 Comment: He understands the Alavés footballers.\n34:42 Comment: Mendy Zorroza's audience understands that it was Danilo's fault.\n34:46 Comment: And that even.\n34:46 Comment: It could be Mendy Zorroza made of yellow

    "summary": "In an enthralling La Liga encounter at the Mendizorroza, Real Madrid showcased their might with a commanding 4-1 victory over Deportivo Alavés. The game for the Santiago Bernabéu outfit was a mix of tactical precision and individual brilliance, marking yet another outstanding performance in their quest for the title.\n\nReal Madrid fielded an exceptionally strong starting XI featuring names like Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, and Isco Alarcón, while Deportivo Alavés lined up with three center backs and two long wingers in Kiko Femenía and Teo Hernández. From the get-go, Alavés was deep in their half, conscious of the potential Madrid onslaught. The away side, deploying an aggressive tempo and fluid movement, saw Cristiano Ronaldo as a pivotal figure even in the mere seconds of the match when he started combining with Isco and Varane, orchestrating Madrid’s forward maneuvers.\n\nBarely into the game, the home side presented a determined midfield press, closing spaces effectively. Alavés showed defensive compactness and discipline, making it hard for Los Blancos to devise clear-cut threats.\n\nSeven minutes into the game, the stands of Mendizorroza erupted in joy when Teo Hernández, on the left flank, wonderfully changed pace, delivering a perfect cross into the critical area where Deiverson capitalized, slotting it past Keylor Navas. Alavés took a well-deserved 1-0 lead, leveraging on Madrid's momentary defensive lapse.\n\nReal Madrid's response came thick and fast, constantly probing Alavés' defensive resilience. This relentless pressure bore fruit in the 16th minute when a controversial handball call against Deiverson led to a penalty. The live arrangement made it contentious as ball contact appeared murky from various angles; however, Ronaldo made no mistake from 11 meters, firing Madrid level at 1-1 amidst significant uproar and debate over the decisive call.\n\nDespite Alavés’ solid shape, Madrid managed to exploit the narrow gaps further on. Cristiano Ronaldo struck again, this time in the 33rd-minute. After receiving the ball near the left wing, he swiftly found a shooting position and unleashed a powerful drive from distance which took a deflection off a defender, misleading Pacheco and nestling into the corner. With a scoreline at 2-1, the match saw a surging Real Madrid shaking off their initial hesitancy.\n\nAs the first half dwindled towards its close, Alavés skipper Manu García saw yellow for reiterations of physical play, reflective of their assertive but often overzealous defensive approach. \n\nThe second half rang in optimism for the hosts as they showed determination by creating early chances to draw level. A notable effort came barely a minute into the half when Camarasa, after evading Varane, confronted Navas in a one-on-one situation. The Costa Rican goalkeeper showcased remarkable agility, narrowing the angle and thwarting the equalizer, adding to his repertoire of match-saving interventions.\n\nThe game oscillated back and forth as Alavés found brief moments of resurgence, pressuring the visitors' defensive lines. Keylor Navas was constantly tested, both from direct plays and speculative shots such as Deiverson's drive from the edge of the box, where Navas’ positioning and reflexes ensured stability for Madrid at the back.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale shifted gears, playing deeper to initiate plays, contributing critically beyond mere offensive thrusts. This adaptation paid dividends as Bale’s movements became instrumental in maintaining Madrid’s midfield pressure, although intimating defensive handlings often led to sustained harsh challenges, accumulating cards along the way.\n\nNear the 72-minute mark, a gripping moment saw Ronaldo have an opportunity to extend Madrid's lead from another penalty after a tussle involving Dani Torres. Yet, Pacheco stood his ground, parrying Ronaldo's effort and rejuvenating Alavés’ hopes.\n\nStage-wise substitutions brought more dynamics to the game. Alavés introduced attacking threats like Alexander Katay and later Cristian Santos, while Real moved with the more mobile Álvaro Morata, who had a notable impact. \n\nUltimately, Alavés’ shift to risk offensive moves left spaces behind that Madrid exploited effectively. In the 83rd minute, Morata’s entry bore immediate fruit. Off a splendid long pass from Marcelo, Morata dashed past an outpaced defense, staying composed to chip over Pacheco, quieting the roaring Mendizorroza faithful with a 3-1 cushion.\n\nAs the clock ticked towards the final whistle, the complexion of the game tilted further to Madrid’s favor, crucially exhibited in the attacking transitions orchestrated by a revitalized Marcelo and the ever-lethal Ronaldo. In the 87th minute, an exemplary piece of play encapsulated Madrid’s evening. Marcelo, darting from the left, played a neat one-two with Ronaldo who timed his run impeccably, finishing past Pacheco to seal his hat trick.\n\nThe scoreline of 4-1 accurately reflected Real Madrid’s approach of seizing crucial game moments and converting them into defining scores. Their journey over 90 minutes highlighted not only their reliance on superstar prowess but also underscored the tactical adaptability necessitated by the stern test posed by Alavés.\n\nAlavés might seek solace in relentless efforts and the intense competition they provided against a world-class side. With vital saves from Pacheco, inspired runs from Teo Hernández, and a tireless display across the pitch; their performance despite the loss consolidated a commendable tactical disposition.\n\nReal Madrid’s conclusive victory demonstrated an unyielding quest for Liga triumph, powered by Ronaldo’s hat trick, effective team transitions, and formidable tactical structuring around controlled tempo and strategic depth. With such performances, Los Blancos not only reinforced their title aspirations but also exemplified the dynamic entwining of stellar skill sets and coherent football philosophies under Zinedine Zidane's stewardship."
