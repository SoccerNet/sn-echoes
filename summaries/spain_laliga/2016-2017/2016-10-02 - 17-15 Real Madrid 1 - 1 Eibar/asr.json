scoring a goal at the Bernabéu is not easy.\n13:59 Comment: But if you ask, you would have to put it in with eight minutes left.\n14:3 Comment: When eight minutes into the game.\n14:5 Comment: Deep ball by Escalante.\n14:7 Comment: Robén Peña did not look for it because they surely knew they were offside.\n14:10 Comment: That gave him the possibility of recovering Pepe.\n14:13 Comment: The Real Madrid centre-back advances on the right.\n14:16 Comment: Throw-in.\n14:17 Comment: Danilo will put it into play.\n14:20 Comment: That's as far as Isco Larcón goes to receive and distribute.\n14:24

risk.\n15:20 Comment: Franrico has been pulling back to strengthen what a party is.\n15:24 Comment: A midfield line of three players.\n15:27 Comment: And it's good because that will allow Eibar to have the ball with much more security.\n15:34 Comment: Franrico is a man who plays very neatly in the center of the field.\n15:40 Comment: It is very difficult for him to lose a ball in that

Ricardo and his teammates to accompany him in this pressure exercise that he is carrying out alone.\n41:5 Comment: Yes, too much distance between the French footballer and the midfield line.\n41:9 Comment: Real Madrid is trying to adjust and that is precisely what Zinedine Zidane asked of his players from the bench.\n41:16 Comment: Ronaldo facing Capa, offers Danilo, two bicycles, breaks outwards, not inwards, slows down, change of pace, comes to Ronaldo's center looking for Gareth Bale.\n41:25 Comment: Bale put his head into the Welshman's header in an action that, both in origin and ending, was quite similar to the 1-1 scoreline.\n41:33 Comment: However, Bale's header on this occasion went over the dangerous goal.\n41:40 Comment: Eibar has to learn that because the truth is that the play was exactly the same.\n41:45 Comment: Cristiano found position again to cross, the cross was magnificent, it fell to the far post again and he headed it again.\n41:55 Comment: Bale this time with a little more opposition.\n42:1 Comment: Risky long ball, Escalante gets his head in, Dani García also keeps it, Toni Kroos, there is a foul on the German center of the Real Madrid court.\n42:12 Comment: By the way Jorge, correct me if I'm wrong, but that action of Ronaldo stopping and starting again very quickly is typical of a player who little by little is beginning to find freshness.\n42:20 Comment: I say this because he is a footballer who has not done the preseason with the rest of his teammates, who is coming off a very recent injury.\n42:25 Comment: The fact that he had to compete for two months is still a good indication for Cristiano Ronaldo.\n42:29 Comment: There it is, yes, a good indication because we are already beginning to see them with a change of pace.\n42:34 Comment: And also today he played quite close to the line.\n42:37 Comment: In previous games he was a center forward who played for the goal, not for the game.\n42:45 Comment: And today, however, he is participating more and is effectively asserting his change of pace, his power.\n42:52 Comment: It's coming in little by little.\n42:55 Comment: The physical tone to be the great player we know he is.\n43:0 Comment: Carvajal, Kroos, Bale with free space to put the center.\n43:5 Comment: He is shaping up to serve with his left foot.\n43:7 Comment: Ronaldo up.\n43:8 Comment: Above is Cristiano Ronaldo's header.\n43:12 Comment: The possibility was lost for Real Madrid.\n43:15 Comment: Well, the tables are turned.\n43:17 Comment: Now it is Bale who goes in, Cristiano who heads.\n43:24 Comment: And the Madrid that follows.\n43:25 Comment: Insisting with their centers.\n43:30 Comment: There is the cold atmosphere.\n43:31 Comment: The public is cold.\n43:32 Comment: The team is cold.\n43:34 Comment: And the entrance is good.\n43:35 Comment: And the entrance is very good, yes.\n43:36 Comment: Yes, I think we will be close to 70,000 fans.\n43:40 Comment: I think it may be the best entrance in the league matches here at the Bernabéu.\n43:43 Comment: Carvajal's foul and the warning for the Real Madrid full-back in that play with Rubén Peña.\n43:49 Comment: Well, now Bale for protesting.\n43:51 Comment: The Welshman saw her first for protesting.\n43:54 Comment: It came from behind.\n43:55 Comment: To claim that action from the referee.\n43:58 Comment: And before showing the yellow card to the Real Madrid full-back, the Welshman saw it.\n44:3 Comment: Pepe also protests to the assistant.\n44:6 Comment: He talks to the referee, tells him to leave.\n44:8 Comment: Well, a 2 in 1 for Real Madrid.\n44:11 Comment: With those two warnings after Carvajal's play with Peña.\n44:14 Comment: First Gareth Bale, then Carvajal.\n44:16 Comment: Yes, the lack is unnecessary.\n44:19 Comment: Too much momentum in Carvajal.\n44:21 Comment: When we ask for more rhythm we are not referring to this.\n44:25 Comment: We mean that Real Madrid moves the ball with a little more speed.\n44:29 Comment: Carvajal has to control himself a little in this type of play.\n44:34 Comment: He has grown a lot as a player.\n44:36 Comment: It is one of the most valuable elements of Real Madrid.\n44:41 Comment: But you have to have maturity to control yourself in this type of situation.\n44:46 Comment: Pedro León is going to put it in what could be one of the last of the first part.\n44:49 Comment: Pedro León's flat ball looking for the far post.\n44:51 Comment: Gonzalo Escalante is not going to reach it.\n44:53 Comment: It will be a goal kick for Keel.\n44:55

insists about keeping it, yes, Fran Rico keeps it\n0:42 Comment: Dani García first for Rico who puts her behind Carvajal\n0:46 Comment: Antonio Luna is rising there, Luna fighting paired with Real Madrid's number 2\n0:51 Comment: the throw-in is for the white box\n0:53 Comment: nothing happens here in the sector\n0:59 Comment: because Carvajal is fighting, Carvajal is what goes into dispute and ends up closing his band\n1:7 Comment: Let us not forget Carvajal, from the last minute of the first half he plays with that condition of the warning\n1:12 Comment: Just like the man who is a little more advanced, is the case of Gareth Bale\n1:16 Comment: The only yellow for Eibar went to Gonzalo Escalante\n1:19 Comment: Cobas and made another deep ball on Ronaldo's run who steps into the area, breaks inside, Ronaldo continues\n1:24 Comment: No, the action was missed to the point that Ricardo didn't even miss\n1:28 Comment: no, it's a kickoff, it's a jump of the race\n1:29 Comment: hand was claimed in Mateo Kovacic's action\n1:31 Comment: This is what Pedro León demands of him now.\n1:33 Comment: Martínez Munuera did not consider it that way, the play continued\n1:37 Comment: That Ronaldo caracole did not go well for the Portuguese striker\n1:41 Comment: ball for Eibar\n1:42 Comment: if Kovacic enabled it once again\n1:46 Comment: What is the best thing he has done in the

already in the warm-up band because Quique García, Adrián and Bebe are already joining him from Real Madrid.\n16:5 Comment: Lucas Vázquez, Mariano and Asensio. We must remember that he only has one change left and that is Cinedin Zidane.\n16:13 Comment: And of the two that Jorge introduced after the break, one of Morata's seems to be having an immediate effect.\n16:18 Comment: Yes, in mobility surely, out of puck play.\n16:22 Comment: In the mobility of the team without a doubt, yes. Cristiano is starting to find more spaces because Morata moves throughout the attack front, drags the defenders and leaves at least inside situations for Real Madrid to...\n16:40 Comment: What a header!\n16:40 Comment: The header is sensational on the technical side because of the way it is turned, how it is directed. Also, taking into account that the center comes without excessive force, it has to be printed.\n16:50 Comment: That's it, that's it.\n16:52 Comment: There, Real Madrid scored the second goal, which we remember has also seen it disallowed correctly.\n16:59 Comment: According to the repetitions, somewhat Álvaro Morata.\n17:7 Comment: Up Dani García. The Pedro León fight, also Danilo. Dani García himself lowers it. Eibar captain's opening.\n17:15 Comment: Ander Kappa for Pedro León, Kappa again. Kappa challenging Danilo. He tries to escape towards the baseline.\n17:21 Comment: Danilo doesn't know...\n17:22 Comment: It allows a throw-in very close to the area for José Luis Mendilibar's team.\n17:27 Comment: That a few moments ago I was trying to talk to Pedro León to insist on the action or actions in which he can look for Danilo for this gang.\n17:36 Comment: The coach of the Jipuzcua team told him to look more for the touchline to try to enter through that area of ​​the field of play.\n17:44 Comment: Kappa crossed, Pepe cleared.\n17:48 Comment: Another side serve for Leibar.\n17:52 Comment: It is offered in short Pedro León. He also asks for it inside the Sergi Enric area.\n18:1 Comment: Playing Kappa who finally delivers for Pedro León. Another throw-in. He gained just a few meters in the gunsmith's box.\n18:16 Comment: Once again Pedro León playing first for Kappa who is going to center it. Kappa flies to the far post.\n18:20 Comment: Rubén Peña entering with everything. Hunting point.\n18:22 Comment: Antonio Luna does not save her.\n18:25 Comment: Throw-in for Real Madrid.\n18:26 Comment: Centers are very easy to get from this situation.\n18:29 Comment: Kovacic and Danilo were a little asleep.\n18:33 Comment: Both of them claiming a bad throw-in.\n18:36 Comment: Something that no longer exists in football.\n18:38 Comment: The referees have practically stopped calling bad serves.\n18:41 Comment: And in that distraction came that center that had a certain danger.\n18:49 Comment: Kovacic.\n18:52 Comment: Danilo is shaping up for the center.\n18:55 Comment: Hanging ball looking for Morata.\n18:57 Comment: He escapes at risk. Morata. Morata.\n18:58 Comment: Morata turns around. Morata is looking for a partner.\n19:0 Comment: Morata wants to shoot from the ground.\n19:2 Comment: He snatches it away cleanly. Mauro Santos.\n19:5 Comment: The danger for Eibar passed after that error in blocking the goalkeeper.\n19:9 Comment: So at risk.\n19:9 Comment: What happened to Isco a little happened to him. He turned upside down.\n19:13 Comment: It seems to him that if he looked for his left leg he had an angle of approximately half a meter through which to put the ball.\n19:21 Comment: First.\n19:22 Comment: He turned inside and then when he wanted to return he gave the defenders the chance to respond.\n19:30 Comment: Mauro Santos was impeccable in that defensive action, avoiding Álvaro Morata's shot.\n19:35 Comment: To the ground Sergi Enric.\n19:37 Comment: Martínez Monuera does not indicate a foul.\n19:40 Comment: Mateo Kovacic leads the counterattack.\n19:42 Comment: Morata is offered on the left side and receives the 21st.\n19:45 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo is waiting inside the area.\n19:48 Comment: Morata goes inside.\n19:49 Comment: Morata puts it with a screw looking for Ronaldo.\n19:51 Comment: Control Bale.\n19:51 Comment: He escapes after cushioning that ball with his thigh.\n19:56 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo ducked at the last moment and Bale did not have time to respond.\n20:3 Comment: To control that ball with a little precision.\n20:8 Comment: There is a foul on Rubén Peña.\n20:11 Comment: Possession for Eibar.\n20:12 Comment: Dani García distributes to the right with under layer.\n20:18 Comment: Pedro León offered himself behind Danilo's back.\n20:21 Comment: He had unchecked a long time ago, which is why he would have been in an offside position.\n20:27 Comment: Be that as it may, the ball went out and possession once again went to Zinedine Zidane's boys.\n20:32 Comment: The one who no longer sits is Mendilibar.\n20:34 Comment: In the first half he did spend quite a bit of time on the bench.\n20:37 Comment: Now in the technical zone, at the front of his area, giving instructions and watching this second part much more intensely.\n20:47 Comment: He is taking care not to lengthen his equipment because he runs that risk.\n20:51 Comment: For some moments Eibar defended a field that was too large and that did not suit them.\n20:59 Comment: And let's remember that although perhaps only anecdotally, Eibar's negative statistics in this stadium also extend to their coach's entire career.\n21:7 Comment: Mendilibar would be scoring for the first time in this field to which he has already come as coach of several teams.\n21:13 Comment: What a good move by Ronaldo.\n21:14 Comment: Ronaldo hits him up top.\n21:15 Comment: He managed to find the hole.\n21:17 Comment: Get rid of a couple of defenders.\n21:19 Comment: But his shot with his left leg.\n21:21 Comment: He went well above the rival goal.\n21:26 Comment: There are some players who are beginning to show fatigue.\n21:29 Comment: For example, Isco, who hasn't played 90 minutes in a while and logically has to notice it.\n21:38 Comment: More intoned Christian.\n21:42 Comment: Exactly, Isco has not played 90 minutes since the game against Rayo Vallecano last season.\n21:48 Comment: Official match.\n21:49 Comment: And at the Bernabéu, from Paraguay.\n21:51 Comment: Match against Eibar last April as well.\n21:56 Comment: But the match against Eibar here, which ended with the score 4-0 for the white team.\n22:1 Comment: It was the entire last 90 minutes.\n22:4 Comment: A complete game from Isco at the Bernabéu.\n22:6 Comment: Winning in the first half was very participatory.\n22:10 Comment: In fact, today, without going any further, is the second start of the official match for Isco.\n22:15 Comment: The first in the League.\n22:16 Comment: Since the European Super Cup match against Sevilla in Trondheim in Norway.\n22:21 Comment: That did not appear to the starting team.\n22:23 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo entering from the left.\n22:25 Comment: Dos Santos, Skorner, covered him.\n22:27 Comment: Another corner kick for Real Madrid.\n22:29 Comment: And yet Lopetegui has called him for the Spanish team's double commitment against Albania and Italy.\n22:34 Comment: Now in this national team break.\n22:38 Comment: At the launch as always Toni Kroos.\n22:41 Comment: Kroos serves, he comes out at risk like this and keeps that ball.\n22:48 Comment: Eibar holds on.\n22:49 Comment: We are halfway.\n22:51 Comment: The time of this second half.\n22:54 Comment: And he still shows no sense of urgency in his defensive movements.\n22:59 Comment: Real Madrid is a little sharper looking for the goal.\n23:4 Comment: But Eibar resists.\n23:8 Comment: Mateo Kovacic's maneuver was excellent.\n23:10 Comment: They couldn't stop him.\n23:12 Comment: Ronaldo unchecks.\n23:14 Comment: He opts to play Kovacic short for Isco.\n23:16 Comment: Zidane's team attacks from the right.\n23:19 Comment: Bale.\n23:21 Comment: Isco stands out inside the area.\n23:23 Comment: And the 22nd appears.\n23:24 Comment: Isco can arrive.\n23:24 Comment: Play first class.\n23:25 Comment: It's Isco for Ronaldo.\n23:27 Comment: Ball over the goal.\n23:29 Comment: Isco Alarcón managed to get the center in very forcefully.\n23:33 Comment: But Ronaldo's shot, I don't know to what extent he was expecting it there.\n23:36 Comment: He went over the goal.\n23:38 Comment: Martínez Muruera also warns.\n23:40 Comment: That's risk.\n23:42 Comment: Don't insist on wasting time.\n23:44 Comment: Next time I could reprimand him.\n23:47 Comment: The goalkeeper of the gunsmith team has already been warned.\n23:50 Comment: It happens that Carvajal went to claim it.\n23:52 Comment: He crossed the entire field to claim it.\n23:54 Comment: And in any case someone who does not have a yellow card has to go and claim it.\n23:58 Comment: Why tempt the devil, right?\n24:1 Comment: Clara de Pepe is missing there on Sergi Henrik.\n24:7 Comment: Isco saved her very well.\n24:9 Comment: The ball seemed to be going irrevocably.\n24:11 Comment: And yet he ended up getting a very good center.\n24:14 Comment: A little strong for the arrival of Cristiano.\n24:20 Comment: It's not accurate.\n24:22 Comment: That is.\n24:23 Comment: But right now in that action with Pepe from afar I told Pepe calm down.\n24:27 Comment: That in this action you have missed too much.\n24:30 Comment: A foul that Pedro León will try to take advantage of for Eibar.\n24:33 Comment: Pedro León puts it on.\n24:35 Comment: It fails to prolong the gene.\n24:36 Comment: Sergi Henrik is out.\n24:37 Comment: Henrik hits him against Nacho's body.\n24:39 Comment: Let the ball run Ander Kappa.\n24:41 Comment: I don't know if it will come out.\n24:43 Comment: He was stopped just half a meter from the line.\n24:45 Comment: Kovacic tries to take advantage of it.\n24:47 Comment: Kappa turns around from the ground.\n24:49 Comment: Making a very strange kind of roulette.\n24:51 Comment: Getting up and driving against two rivals.\n24:54 Comment: He can't handle the third.\n24:56 Comment: He falls down.\n24:57 Comment: It's missing.\n24:58 Comment: What is happening Ricardo?\n25:0 Comment: Let the game heat up.\n25:1 Comment: Above all also because Rubén Peña had been trying to continue that action.\n25:6 Comment: I don't think you've seen yellow cardboard.\n25:8 Comment: Yes Yes.\n25:9 Comment: Rubén Peña has been cautioned for continuing that play.\n25:12 Comment: The last one to make the foul was Gonzalo Escalante.\n25:14 Comment: Which also has yellow.\n25:16 Comment: In those actions in which they were not able to defeat Pepe.\n25:18 Comment: Or taking the ball away from Mateo Kovacic.\n25:22 Comment: A few minutes ago Pedro León could also see a yellow for the grab.\n25:26 Comment: The referee of the match marked the law of the advantage.\n25:29 Comment: And Pedro León was left without that possible warning.\n25:32 Comment: Now the referee seems more concerned with the loss of time than with the foul.\n25:38 Comment: Asensio is going to join Real Madrid.\n25:40 Comment: It will be the last change in Zinedine Zidane's team.\n25:43 Comment: The Eibar bench is also going to move.\n25:46 Comment: The one who is going to enter the field of play.\n25:48 Comment: It's Kike García.\n25:50 Comment: Danilo up front for Kroos.\n25:52 Comment: Kroos puts in the great center looking for Ronaldo.\n25:54 Comment: Carvajal doesn't arrive either.\n25:56 Comment: In the end it wasn't so good.\n25:58 Comment: Nobody in white managed to connect with the ball that Toni Kroos put into the area.\n26:2 Comment: And some of those in white were offside.\n26:5 Comment: Risk will be taken from the goal.\n26:7 Comment: Zidane was waiting to see if Madrid scored a goal.\n26:10 Comment: If he scored a goal, it was Lucas Vázquez who went in.\n26:12 Comment: The one who comes in is Asensio who didn't score a goal.\n26:15 Comment: Because you need a little more imagination up there.\n26:18 Comment: And Asensio can give it.\n26:21 Comment: Last instructions and inside Ricardo.\n26:23 Comment: Yes, but he's going to wait one more play because Riesgo has already put the ball in play.\n26:27 Comment: Now yes.\n26:28 Comment: Let's see if the change occurs.\n26:30 Comment: The tablet above.\n26:31 Comment: Let's see what the number is of the man who leaves.\n26:34 Comment: It's the 22nd. Isco leaves.\n26:37 Comment: At 26 of the second half.\n26:39 Comment: The one from Arroyo de la Miel is leaving.\n26:41 Comment: The man from Malaga leaves.\n26:43 Comment: Marco Asensio comes in to replace him.\n26:45 Comment: The latest change in Zinedine Zidane's team.\n26:47 Comment: I ask you Jorge first of all about the contest, about Isco's participation.\n26:52 Comment: We insisted since the beginning of August in the European Super Cup that he did not appear as a starter for Real Madrid in an official match.\n26:58 Comment: It was up to par.\n26:59 Comment: He participated in the first half.\n27:1 Comment: He was one of the most in tune players in Real Madrid.\n27:4 Comment: Wow, what a kick Sergi Enric took in the face.\n27:8 Comment: And yellow for Toni Kroos who is the man who made that foul.\n27:12 Comment: He raised his leg too much.\n27:14 Comment: He came into contact with Sergi Enric.\n27:16 Comment: Well, yellow for the German footballer from Real Madrid.\n27:19 Comment: Let's see if the change now occurs in the armored team because Kike García is ready to enter the field of play.\n27:26 Comment: Yes, that leg is very high.\n27:28 Comment: There are many yellow cards, many interruptions.\n27:31 Comment: None of this suits Real Madrid.\n27:34 Comment: A lot of damage could have been done to Sergi Enric because he hit it with the sole, with the studs.\n27:39 Comment: Obviously not voluntarily.\n27:41 Comment: What Kroos wants is to play the ball.\n27:43 Comment: That is.\n27:44 Comment: But Sergi Enric arrives first with his head.\n27:45 Comment: Playing the guy.\n27:47 Comment: And fortunately for everyone, the Menorquín striker who is still on the field was not injured.\n27:51 Comment: Although it looks like he is going to be the player replaced by Kike García.\n27:54 Comment: We immediately cleared up our doubts.\n27:56 Comment: Before this dead ball action that Pedro León is going to execute.\n28:0 Comment: With four Eibar players looking for the shot inside the area.\n28:3 Comment: Martínez Monuera authorizes.\n28:5 Comment: Pedro León puts it on the penalty spot.\n28:7 Comment: Clear the Real Madrid defense.\n28:9 Comment: This is Fran Rico who insists.\n28:10 Comment: Cuts back against Kroos.\n28:11 Comment: Fran Rico puts it on.\n28:12 Comment: Ronaldo puts his chest in.\n28:13 Comment: Let's run says Marco Asensio.\n28:14 Comment: To run! Marco Asensio says.\n28:15 Comment: There is Marco who leaves the first one behind.\n28:17 Comment: Capa appears to prevent Marco Asensio from opening to the left.\n28:21 Comment: You have to do it to the right.\n28:23 Comment: And there José Luis Mendilibar's team had everything under control.\n28:26 Comment: This is what is usually recommended in counterattacks.\n28:29 Comment: Let there be very few touches.\n28:31 Comment: But I was there to drive.\n28:32 Comment: He drives the ball so well.\n28:34 Comment: He drives it so fast.\n28:35 Comment: That if he gave three more passes, a very favorable outlook would open up.\n28:40 Comment: Dani García playing first class.\n28:42 Comment: He regrets this journey, which has not been entirely easy.\n28:45 Comment: But it is a certain movement.\n28:46 Comment: Lejeune lowers it with his chest.\n28:48 Comment: Insuring for Antonio Luna.\n28:50 Comment: Dani García receives and turns.\n28:52 Comment: Distribute the Zumárraga player.\n28:54 Comment: Antonio Luna goes up on the left.\n28:56 Comment: Sergi Henrik asks for it above.\n28:58 Comment: Ball looking for 9.\n29:0 Comment: Nacho intercepts.\n29:1 Comment: Jump for that ball Marco Asensio.\n29:3 Comment: Rubén Peña keeps it.\n29:5 Comment: Rubén Peña accelerates.\n29:7 Comment: Breaking Dani Carvajal at speed.\n29:9 Comment: He tries to escape and succeeds.\n29:11 Comment: More from Rubén Peña.\n29:12 Comment: Ball for Sergi Henrik in front.\n29:13 Comment: Sergi looks for space to shoot.\n29:14 Comment: Pepe takes it away.\n29:16 Comment: Kovacic tries to launch the counterattack.\n29:18 Comment: But the ball belongs to Eibar again.\n29:24 Comment: Lejeune back to risk.\n29:26 Comment: The one who presses as if there were no tomorrow is Cristiano Ronaldo.\n29:32 Comment: Sergi Henrik's offside there.\n29:33 Comment: Ball for Real Madrid at the moment in which the change is going to be carried out.\n29:36 Comment: And Ricardo looks like he is going to be Sergi Henrik himself.\n29:39 Comment: Yes, because Eibar's number 9 is completely drowned.\n29:42 Comment: Who doesn't even want to look.\n29:44 Comment: Now he does it after Martínez's indication.\n29:46 Comment: He leaves after a tremendous effort.\n29:49 Comment: The one of the striker of the armored team.\n29:52 Comment: Kike García comes in to replace him.\n29:56 Comment: A footballer who has not yet scored in the First Division.\n30:0 Comment: And he will have 15 minutes ahead of him plus added time.\n30:4 Comment: To try to find the goal that will give Eibar a historic victory here at the Santiago Bernabéu.\n30:10 Comment: Sergi Henrik's boots are heavier than ever.\n30:12 Comment: It empties.\n30:13 Comment: I leave everything.\n30:14 Comment: Kike García takes his place.\n30:16 Comment: We are already 30 minutes into the second half.\n30:19 Comment: That's why it's so valuable to see Cristiano's enthusiastic career.\n30:25 Comment: First sign that you are physically well.\n30:28 Comment: And secondly, he does not lose his enthusiasm for football.\n30:31 Comment: Morata to the ground.\n30:33 Comment: There is no lack of Florian Le Géne.\n30:35 Comment: He waited for Morata himself and forced that rebound to obtain a goal kick.\n30:40 Comment: By the way Jorge.\n30:41 Comment: In line with Real Madrid's latest change.\n30:42 Comment: With the entry of Marco Asensio for Isco.\n30:45 Comment: The Mallorcan started with a lot of prominence.\n30:47 Comment: Even scoring decisive goals in the first games of the season.\n30:51 Comment: Taking advantage of absences due to injury in the attack zone.\n30:54 Comment: They have already returned.\n30:55 Comment: Both Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo have already returned strongly.\n30:58 Comment: Morata is available.\n30:59 Comment: Bale too.\n31:0 Comment: The spaces for the team to appear in that more advanced line are closed.\n31:4 Comment: And this inclusion of Asensio in the center of the field.\n31:7 Comment: It's not the first time we've seen it.\n31:8 Comment: It may be the solution so that you continue to have minutes.\n31:10 Comment: Yeah.\n31:11 Comment: It is the first solution.\n31:12 Comment: Because the BBC seems untouchable.\n31:14 Comment: And Morata is also there to cover any loss.\n31:18 Comment: So it's in the center of the

    "summary": "Real Madrid and Eibar played out a thrilling 1-1 draw at Santiago Bernabéu, a match that showcased the determination of the visitors and the attacking prowess of the hosts. \n\nRight from the start, the intensity of the game was apparent. Less than a minute into the match, Dani García put pressure on Karim Benzema, setting the tone for Eibar’s aggressive midfield pressing. Isco, who was very active throughout the first half, tried to control play, but Eibar’s relentless pressing, particularly from Dani García and Gonzalo Escalante, made it difficult for Real Madrid to find their rhythm.\n\nKeylor Navas, returning to league action after an injury, was involved early on, having to play back passes under pressure from Eibar's front line. The away side showed no fear as Fran Rico and Rubén Peña frequently interrupted Madrid's attempts to build from the back. This early aggression paid off for Eibar in the fifth minute. Pedro León, a former Real Madrid player, delivered an excellent cross into the box, and Fran Rico, unmarked, headed past Navas to give Eibar a shock lead. It was a goal orchestrated and finished by two former Real Madrid players, making the moment even more poignant for the home fans.\n\nThe goal seemed to jolt Real Madrid into action. Immediately after conceding, Gareth Bale began to find space down the right wing, managing a shot that hit the side netting, and another that posed a threat to Eibar’s goal. The Welshman’s pace and willingness to take on defenders were evident, as he repeatedly drove at Eibar’s left-back, Antonio Luna. Despite this, Eibar defended resolutely, with center-halves Mauro dos Santos and Florian Lejeune standing firm against Madrid’s attacks.\n\nHowever, it wasn’t long before Real Madrid's persistence bore fruit. In the 17th minute, Cristiano Ronaldo, operating from the left flank, sent in a delightful cross to the back post, where Gareth Bale rose above Luna to head home the equalizer. It showcased Ronaldo’s ability to create from wide positions and Bale’s growing reputation as a formidable aerial threat.\n\nAfter drawing level, Real Madrid continued to push forward, but Eibar’s resolute defending kept them at bay. The midfield battle intensified with Toni Kroos and Isco trying to orchestrate play, but faced with constant harassment from Eibar’s midfield trio.\n\nAs the match progressed, Real Madrid’s build-up play grew more intricate with Dani Carvajal and Marcelo pushing high up the flanks. Despite dominating possession, the home side struggled to penetrate Eibar’s well-organized defense. Ronaldo’s frequent incursions from the left and Bale’s drives from the right frequently found Mauro dos Santos and Florian Lejeune in the way. \n\nEibar, on the other hand, was not content to merely defend their lead. They countered effectively when possible, with Pedro León and Sergi Enric providing outlets. León, continuously creative, managed another effort that Navas had to save after a fine run. Navas' shot-stopping abilities came to the fore, maintaining the level scores and keeping Real Madrid in contention.\n\nFor all their possession and crosses into the box, Real Madrid faced a setback as James Rodríguez suffered discomfort during the warm-up, leading to Mateo Kovacic starting instead. Kovacic however brought a different dynamic to the midfield, adding more balance and defensive cover, allowing the attacking trio more freedom to operate.\n\nAs half-time approached, Eibar’s confidence grew, and they began to string together long spells of possession, frustrating the home side. Real Madrid’s defense looked vulnerable, particularly on the counter, and it was only due to Keylor Navas’ alertness and some last-ditch defending from Pepe and Varane that the score remained level at the break.\n\nThe second half began with Eibar pressing high and not allowing Madrid to dictate play comfortably. Both teams continued their midfield battle, with hard challenges coming in from both sides. The introduction of Nacho for Varane indicated a slight reshuffle in Madrid’s defense, perhaps aimed at adding more dynamism to their backline.\n\nThe home side looked for ways to break through Eibar’s disciplined setup, with Ronaldo and Bale providing constant threats from the wings. Ronaldo, showing glimpses of his sharpness returning post-injury, attempted several individual runs and even managed a few dangerous crosses, but Eibar’s defense held strong.\n\nDespite their defensive stance, Fran Rico and Rubén Peña continued to be instrumental for Eibar, disrupting Madrid’s flow and trying to carve out chances on the break. Midway through the second half, Pedro León again found space and managed a shot on goal, but Navas was equal to the task.\n\nReal Madrid’s manager Zinedine Zidane introduced Álvaro Morata and Marco Asensio in the hope that fresh legs could create more scoring opportunities. Morata’s movement caused immediate problems for the Eibar defense, and it was his partnership with Ronaldo that almost bore fruit several times. On one such instance, a counter-attack led by Isco and finished with a Ronaldo strike was brilliantly saved by Eibar’s goalkeeper, Asier Riesgo.\n\nIn the final quarter of the match, Real Madrid threw everything forward. Kroos and Kovacic tried to control the tempo, often pushing high up the pitch. The urgency in Real Madrid's play was palpable, as Bale and Ronaldo took turns in switching wings, trying to find that elusive second goal.\n\nEibar, though tiring, remained compact and disciplined. Their center-backs continuously cleared crosses and managed to deal with the physical presence of Morata and Bale. The inclusion of Baby and Kike García towards the end for Eibar added fresh legs, allowing them to chase down loose balls and help with defensive duties.\n\nThe clock ticked down, and Real Madrid’s attacks became more frantic. In added time, Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale both came close with headers, but it wasn’t to be. Eibar’s defense, marshaled excellently by Lejeune and Santos, held firm, and Riesgo's saves ensured the visitors left the Bernabéu with a hard-earned point.\n\nEibar’s performance was characterized by tactical discipline, grit, and timely interventions from their defenders and goalkeeper. Real Madrid, despite their dominance and numerous chances, were unable to break down a resolute Eibar side that played with heart and left Santiago Bernabéu with a well-deserved 1-1 draw. \n\nThe match was a testament to Eibar’s resilience and Real Madrid’s continuous but futile search for goals. Both sides showed qualities that fans cherish in football – heart, persistence, and the never-say-die attitude – making this game an enthralling contest.\n"
