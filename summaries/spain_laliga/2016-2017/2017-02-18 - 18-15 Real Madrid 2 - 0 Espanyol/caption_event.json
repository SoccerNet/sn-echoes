    "summary": "Real Madrid faced Espanyol in a gripping clash at Santiago Bernabéu, where the hosts came out on top with a 2-0 victory. The match was marked by numerous fouls, some outstanding plays, and a multitude of set-pieces, showcasing Real Madrid's persistent dominance and Espanyol's resilient defense.\n\nThe game began with Espanyol kicking off proceedings. However, it was apparent early on that maintaining possession was going to be challenging, as the ball went out of play almost immediately. Espanyol took the first throw-in, but within the first two minutes, they committed a foul, giving Real Madrid an early chance to set the tone with an indirect free-kick. Real Madrid's subsequent throw-in led to another foul by Espanyol. This time, Real Madrid opted for a direct free-kick but failed to capitalize as the ball went out of play.\n\nThe initial exchanges indicated a fragmented start to the game, with throw-ins and fouls dominating the opening minutes. Real Madrid continued to apply pressure, and within the first ten minutes, the pattern of Espanyol fouling and Real Madrid attempting to capitalize on free-kicks and throw-ins repeated itself. Espanyol managed their first attack around the 7th minute, secured a corner, but only to fire shots off target, with Real Madrid clearing their lines.\n\nBy the 11th minute, Lucas Vasquez tried to go on a solo run for Real Madrid but couldn’t make a significant impact, leading to a corner. Toni Kroos delivered it, but Pepe’s headed effort went wide. The to-and-fro continued, with Espanyol packing their defense and Real Madrid looking for breakthroughs. Isco and Morata were particularly active, with Isco showing creativity in the midfield and Morata striving to break Espanyol’s defensive lines.\n\nIn the 14th minute, Morata found himself offside, which briefly halted Real Madrid's momentum. Though Espanyol had a strong defense, they were unable to maintain consistent possession, leading to more defensive clearances. Around the 23rd minute, Kroos sent another corner into Espanyol’s box, but it was easily cleared. The game continued similarly, with neither team gaining clear control but with Real Madrid holding a slight edge in possession and territorial dominance.\n\nThe game's tempo subtly shifted when Gerard Moreno of Espanyol was booked with a yellow card in the 27th minute for a foul committed earlier. This incident highlighted the increased physicality as Espanyol sought to disrupt Real Madrid’s flow. As the game neared the half-hour mark, Real Madrid seemed to find their rhythm. In the 29th minute, Cristiano Ronaldo had his header opportunity, but it went well over the bar. Shortly after, Ronaldo thought he had scored, but the goal was disallowed due to offside.\n\nPersistence paid off for Los Blancos in the 33rd minute. Isco delivered a beautiful lofted cross into the box, and Alvaro Morata rose above Espanyol’s defenders to head the ball into the left side of the goal, giving Real Madrid a deserved lead. Espanyol quickly resumed play, but their response was muted, with Real Madrid maintaining pressure.\n\nThe remainder of the first half saw more attacks from Real Madrid. Morata was especially active in the box, missing a close-range shot at the 37th minute. Real Madrid exuded confidence, controlling the flow and tempo, continuously testing Espanyol’s defense but the whistle blew for halftime with the score still at 1-0.\n\nThe second half began with a substitution for Espanyol, signaling an intent to shift strategies. Hernan Perez replaced Jose Antonio Reyes, hoping to add fresh legs and creativity. Real Madrid quickly settled into their passing rhythm. However, Espanyol refused to back down. Within the first two minutes of the half, Isco was shown a yellow card for a challenge, indicating that the game’s physical nature would persist.\n\nReal Madrid dominated possession but had to be wary of Espanyol’s counter-attacks. The game saw several fouls and subsequent free-kicks, which maintained the game’s fragmented nature. Around the 8th minute of the second half, Cristiano Ronaldo had a free kick opportunity from the edge of the box, but it was blocked by the defensive wall. This was followed by multiple corners for Real Madrid, none of which they could convert into goals.\n\nEspanyol had a brief spell of pressure around the 29th minute when Perez found space and fired a shot towards goal, but Francisco Casilla’s excellent save kept Real Madrid’s lead intact. Shortly after, Real Madrid substituted Mateo Kovacic with Casemiro to solidify their midfield. This was followed by Espanyol earning a corner, but once again, Real Madrid's sustained defensive effort neutralized the threat.\n\nAlvaro Morata was subbed out for Gareth Bale around the 26th minute in a move that showcased Real Madrid’s depth. Shortly thereafter, Espanyol substituted Jose Manuel Jurado with Alvaro Vazquez, desperately seeking a spark. Espanyol remained combative, exemplified when Aaron Caricol received a yellow card for a foul, leading to another substitution which saw Marcelo come into the pitch for Real Madrid.\n\nThe decisive moment of the second half came in the 38th minute. Isco again played a crucial role, creating space and setting up Gareth Bale who struck the ball precisely into the bottom right corner, extending Real Madrid’s lead to 2-0. This goal solidified Real Madrid’s control, deflating any hopes Espanyol had of making a comeback.\n\nIn subsequent minutes, Espanyol tried to mount a response but were repeatedly thwarted by Real Madrid’s organized defense. Several free-kicks and throw-ins for both teams punctuated the later stages of the game. Toni Kroos and Marcelo continued to trouble the Espanyol defense with their crosses, though no further goals were scored.\n\nThe final whistle blew with a convincing 2-0 victory for Real Madrid. Throughout the match, Real Madrid exhibited superior tactical discipline, creative playmaking from key players like Isco and Kroos, and solid finishing from Morata and Bale. Espanyol, though resilient in defense and showing flashes of potential in attack, were ultimately outclassed by their more illustrious opponents.\n\nThis match highlighted Real Madrid's capability to grind out results, maintain their composure under physical pressure, and shine through individual brilliance. Espanyol, on their part, showcased determination but will rue their inability to capitalize on key chances and the excessive fouls that disrupted their flow.\n\nThe win reaffirmed Real Madrid’s position as one of Europe’s elite, leaving fans highly entertained and looking forward to the season ahead. Espanyol, despite the loss, showed spirit and performance trends to build on for future games. The crowd of 75,606 witnessed champions in action, with Real Madrid proving their mettle and clinching a well-earned victory."
