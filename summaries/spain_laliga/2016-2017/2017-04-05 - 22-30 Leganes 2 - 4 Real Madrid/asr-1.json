    "summary": "The match between Leganés and Real Madrid started with a lively tempo with both teams trying to establish their dominance. Real Madrid, despite being the superior team on paper, quickly found themselves under an unexpected barrage of intensity from Leganés.\n\nIn the opening minutes, Real Madrid looked to set the tone with an early attack led by Álvaro Morata. Morata's initial incursion into the Leganés defense demonstrated his dribbling skills, but his shot went wide. Lucas Vázquez and Marco Asensio added to the relentless pressure Real Madrid piled upon Leganés, exploiting the flanks and testing the defensive resolve of their opponents early.\n\nThe game was tightly contested in the midfield, with Casemiro playing a pivotal role for Real Madrid in breaking up Leganés attacks and distributing the ball. His accurate passes and tactical awareness were evident as he tried to orchestrate the play from the back. Leganés, however, did not shy away from pressing high and intensely, often forcing Real Madrid into quick decisions and errors.\n\nThe breakthrough came in the 14th minute for Real Madrid. Marco Asensio, showcasing his skill, executed a fine dribble down the flank, broke through the Leganés defense, and laid a perfect pass to James Rodríguez, who made no mistake, slotting the ball home. The early goal unsettled Leganés but did not deter them from trying to level the score.\n\nReal Madrid’s second goal was swift to follow. From a corner kick in the 17th minute, James Rodríguez delivered an exquisite ball into the box. Álvaro Morata jumped high, creating chaos, and Nacho Fernandez capitalized on the opportunity amidst the confusion to make it 2-0 for Real Madrid. \n\nDespite the two-goal deficit, Leganés displayed remarkable resilience. They quickly sought to get back into the game. Their perseverance paid off in the 20th minute when Rico's determined run down the right wing led to a perfect cutback for Gabriel, who had an easy finish into an empty net. This goal ignited the home crowd, providing Leganés with a newfound belief.\n\nThe game surged with end-to-end action following Gabriel's goal. Leganés found a second wind and put Real Madrid under significant pressure. Their intensity was rewarded once again at the half-hour mark. This time, a well-executed corner resulted in another goal for Leganés. Siovas leaped higher than the Real Madrid defenders, managing to glance the ball, which fell invitingly for Luciano to tap into the net, bringing the score to 2-3 and setting up a tantalizing finish to the first half.\n\nReal Madrid, however, managed to maintain their composure and continued to dominate possession despite the scare from Leganés' comeback attempts. Just before halftime, Real Madrid extended their lead again. From a perfectly executed corner routine in the third minute of the second half, it was initially thought to be an Álvaro Morata header, but later reviews indicated that it was Mantovani, unfortunately, diverting the ball into his own net, thus extending Real Madrid's lead to 4-2.\n\nDespite another setback, Leganés pressed high with immense energy and sought to narrow the deficit again. Real Madrid's defense, marshaled by Sergio Ramos and Nacho, had to stay alert and disciplined to block the relentless attacks. Keylor Navas, Real Madrid's goalkeeper, also stood firm, making several crucial saves to deny Leganés opportunities.\n\nIn the 68th minute, Zinedine Zidane made key substitutions to freshen the squad and add more reinforcement to Real’s midfield stability. Isco was brought on to replace James Rodriguez, who had a mixed performance despite scoring the opening goal. This substitution added a spark of creativity and control in the attacking midfield area, allowing Real Madrid to dictate the tempo of the game more effectively.\n\nAs the second half progressed, Real Madrid’s superior quality began to show more clearly. Álvaro Morata continued to be a constant thorn in the side of the Leganés defense with his movement and physicality. Leganés, while spirited, started to fade under the relentless possession play from their opponents. Luka Modric was introduced to maintain the calm and control in midfield, ensuring Real Madrid kept their stranglehold on the game.\n\nOne notable moment of the match came late in the game when Lucas Vázquez almost scored a spectacular solo goal. He outmaneuvered multiple defenders with his dribbling skills, only for his final shot to be thwarted by an outstanding save from Herrerín.\n\nAs the clock wound down, Real Madrid retained possession, effectively passing the ball around, frustrating Leganés and throttling any momentum they had been trying to revive. This controlled possession and disciplined defensive display ensured that Real Madrid preserved their two-goal advantage comfortably.\n\nWhen the final whistle blew, the score read Leganés 2 - 4 Real Madrid. Despite a valiant effort from the home side, the experience and clinical nature of the visitors shone through. Goals from James Rodriguez, Nacho Fernandez, Álvaro Morata (later credited as an own goal by Mantovani), and the different phases of positional play orchestrated by their key players ensured that Real Madrid continued their fine form in the league, picking up an essential three points.\n\nLeganés will take heart from the fact that they were able to score twice against one of the league's strongest defenses and put up a strong fight. For Real Madrid, the game served as a reminder of their resilience, depth, and quality, as they handled a challenging away fixture with aplomb and returned home victorious."
