    "summary": "In a fiercely contested match between Leganes and Real Madrid, the visiting side emerged victorious with a 4-2 win, showcasing moments of high skill, tactical plays, and thrilling drama across both halves.\n\nThe game commenced with Real Madrid kicking off, setting the tone for a first half filled with ebb and flow. Within the first minute, the ball went out of play, initiating a throw-in for Real Madrid. Another throw-in soon followed by Leganes after a brief tussle for control. The first real chance came for Leganes in the second minute with a shot on target, quickly followed by another shot that went off target. Both efforts, though, failed to put their mark on the scoreboard.\n\nReal Madrid cleared the ball, transitioning into attack mode, and in the 3rd minute, managed a shot off target. This high-pace action saw another clearance from Leganes, but excitement resumed with the first foul by Leganes in the 4th minute, resulting in an indirect free-kick to Real Madrid. The back and forth continued with several instances of ball going out of play and subsequent throw-ins by both teams.\n\nThe first goal arrived in the 14th minute for Real Madrid after a series of attempts from both teams. Marco Asensio laid the ball off to James Rodriguez, who calmly slotted it into the back of the net from close range. The goalkeeper was left helpless as Real Madrid took an early lead. This electrifying moment was quickly followed by more action when Danilo showcased his remarkable technique, though his effort struck the right post.\n\nReal Madrid's intensity didn't wane, and in the 18th minute, they extended their lead. Nacho connected with a delightful cross and headed it towards Alvaro Morata. His header went past Iago Herrerin, putting Real Madrid two goals up. However, the sequence continued as Leganes retaliated with a series of fouls and indirect free-kicks but their attempts were mostly thwarted by Real Madrid's defensive wall. Notably, in the 22nd minute, Alvaro Morata found the net again after receiving a superb through ball from Mateo Kovacic. He reacted quickly, firing into the top right corner, making it 3-0.\n\nLeganes, not to be dismissed, put up a formidable fight. By the 31st minute, Gabriel capitalized on a rebound inside the box and reduced the deficit to 1-3. Luciano further narrowed the gap shortly after, taking advantage of a corner kick and slotting it past the goalkeeper. The game was now 2-3, and tension was palpably rising as halftime approached.\n\nThroughout the closing minutes of the first half, both teams demonstrated exhaustive exertions. Real Madrid held their nerve while Leganes continued pressing, generating a few more chances, notably an alert save by Keylor Navas to deny Leganes from scoring just before the half-time whistle blew.\n\nAs the second half commenced, again with Leganes initiating the kick-off, Real Madrid quickly reclaimed dominance. Early into the half, a critical moment arrived—a free-kick delivered into the box saw Alvaro Morata peel off his marker and head straight into the top left corner, marking his hat-trick and making it 4-2 for Real Madrid. This goal seemed to solidify Real Madrid's control over the match.\n\nSubsequently, Leganes' attempts to regain footing were met with resilient defending and solid counter-attacks from Real Madrid. A notable incident involved Lucas latching onto a precise pass and in a one-on-one with the keeper, only to be denied by a spectacular save from Iago Herrerin. Real Madrid kept creating opportunities to extend their lead but were often met with tenacious goalkeeping and defensive strategies from Leganes.\n\nThe second half saw several substitutions reflecting tactical adjustments by both managers. Leganes’ manager introduced fresh legs, including Samuel replacing Tito, and later Bueno taking Gabriel's place. For Real Madrid, Zinedine Zidane made strategic changes including bringing in Isco and Luka Modric to further solidify their midfield, maintaining control and dictating the game's tempo.\n\nGabriel of Leganes found himself in the referee’s book with a yellow card for a challenge, an event which slightly escalated the physicality. Real Madrid, however, continued to play with precision, prioritizing possession and methodically controlling the game's flow. Leganes, relentless in their chase, attempted a few more shots, including a wild shot that went high over the bar, but couldn't find the breakthrough they needed to unsettle Real Madrid's composure.\n\nAs the game reached its final minutes, Leganes pushed hard but were outplayed by Real Madrid's solid backline and effective game management. The home side tried to carve out opportunities, with instances like Lucas weaving through the defense only to be denied once more by Herrerin. Real Madrid consistently nullified Leganes' efforts through calculated clearances and disciplined defending.\n\nAn obligatory attendance update marked 10922 spectators witnessing the unfolding drama. Real Madrid seemed settled in their lead, comfortably repelling Leganes' advances and attempting to control the game through possession and strategic passing. They aimed to run down the clock while occasionally pushing forward to exploit any defensive lapse by Leganes.\n\nTowards the end, a couple of yellow cards were issued, one notably to Nacho of Real Madrid for a late challenge. This was but one of the disciplinary actions reflecting the competitive nature of the match. Mariano, introduced as a late substitute for Real Madrid, demonstrated bursts of speed, maintaining pressure on Leganes' defense but was eventually stifled by a well-timed defensive challenge.\n\nThe match concluded with a confident win for Real Madrid as the referee blew the final whistle. The visitors' early dominance and subsequent control measures paid off, enabling them to secure a 4-2 victory over a determined Leganes. The game was a testament to tactical astuteness, individual brilliance—particularly from Alvaro Morata—and relentless persistence, especially from a tirelessly battling Leganes side. Through fluctuating phases of dominance, set plays, and defensive efforts, this match encapsulated the passion and unpredictability that football fans cherish."
