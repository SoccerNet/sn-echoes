has to adjust the pressure more.\n7:59 Comment: Sevilla is playing very comfortably in the center of the field.\n8:3 Comment: And that also somehow takes Real Madrid out of the game.\n8:8 Comment: Those long possessions.\n8:10 Comment: Kroos' driving is excellent.\n8:11 Comment: Morata, Morata, Morata.\n8:12 Comment: Sergio Rico is going down.\n8:13 Comment: And the cover.\n8:14 Comment: Sevilla's goalkeeper is sensational to deny Álvaro Morata a shot.\n8:20 Comment: The clearest of what we have in the game.\n8:23 Comment: Good control by Morata would have meant the first goal for Real Madrid.\n8:27 Comment: The shame was that control because the pass had left him in front of Rico.\n8:32 Comment: And well, it was a very clear opportunity.\n8:34 Comment: By the way, the Santiago Bernabéu has been full.\n8:36 Comment: More than 80,000 fans.\n8:37 Comment: There were no entries since yesterday.\n8:39 Comment: There is practically no empty seat in sight.\n8:42 Comment: And as a consequence of the fact that we are in the penultimate day,\n8:45 Comment: There is no time, stopwatch in the video markers.\n8:48 Comment: And the goals of the day will not be reported on the fields where we now have the day at stake.\n8:54 Comment: We saw Morata's last approach repeated.\n8:56 Comment: Sergio Rico does it very well, holding on until the end.\n8:59 Comment: He held up very well and there he won the game against Morata.\n9:3 Comment: Danilo puts it on Kovacic's career.\n9:6 Comment: Good unchecking first.\n9:7 Comment: Kovacic, second stick.\n9:9 Comment: It appears closing

Comment: I was in front of a target.\n9:29 Comment: Dangerous foul that takes quickly.\n9:31 Comment: It's a goal.\n9:32 Comment: Inside.\n9:34 Comment:  Goal!\n9:43 Comment: From Real Madrid at 9.\n9:45 Comment: Nacho's goal.\n9:47 Comment: Everyone was looking the other way.\n9:50 Comment: Everyone was thinking who can hit that foul.\n9:53 Comment: Who are Real Madrid's specialists?\n9:55 Comment: And today's left-handed back appeared.\n9:58 Comment: Smarter than anyone.\n9:59 Comment: To take advantage of Sevilla's carelessness and score the first of the game.\n10:2 Comment: Action that will bring a lot of controversy that Ricardo is already bringing.\n10:6 Comment: Because of the protests of the Sevilla players,\n10:8 Comment: Nacho marked.\n10:9 Comment: Real Madrid 1-1 Sevilla 0.\n10:11 Comment: Correa started, Vitolo followed.\n10:13 Comment: Now all of Seville surrounding a Diano Mañenco.\n10:15 Comment: The referee's explanation is that Nacho could have put the ball into play.\n10:19 Comment: What the winger did was notice a gap in Sevilla's concentration.\n10:24 Comment: He put the ball out of Sergio Rico's reach.\n10:27 Comment: Everyone at Real Madrid celebrated it.\n10:29 Comment: The entire Bernabéu stands celebrated it with suspense.\n10:32 Comment: And despite the protests, the scoreboard already looks 1-0 for the white team.\n10:37 Comment: Let's start with Asensio.\n10:39 Comment: What he wanted was to dribble past two players in a mosaic and he almost succeeded.\n10:44 Comment: They shot him down.\n10:45 Comment: Everyone was waiting.\n10:48 Comment: Ronaldo and Sergio Ramos talking about who was going to take the free kick.\n10:54 Comment: I guess neither of them are mad because they weren't the ones who threw it.\n10:58 Comment: The most astute was Nacho, who stopped the ball perfectly\n11:4 Comment: And without anyone asking for a barrier, he pulled and the story ended.\n11:9 Comment: I wanted to go to that nuance to try to explain where the protests of the Sevilla players came from.\n11:16 Comment: What could make this action illegal, Raúl Jorge, correct me if I'm wrong,\n11:20 Comment: The thing is that if I had requested the distance from the rival players, the distance from the barrier would have been requested.\n11:25 Comment: Therefore, whoever the Real Madrid player was, he would not be authorized to shoot.\n11:29 Comment: But I think he didn't ask for it because it surprised us Sevilla players,\n11:33 Comment: to the fans and to us.\n11:34 Comment: And the Madrid players too.\n11:35 Comment: And from Madrid because it had been a wonderful play by Asensio.\n11:39 Comment: I think the goal seems totally legal to me.\n11:44 Comment: By the way, it is Nacho's second this season in the Santander League.\n11:48 Comment: A man who little by little has been gaining stripes, has been accumulating minutes.\n11:52 Comment: He has become almost like a wild card in the defense of the white team,\n11:57 Comment: to the point of surpassing that barrier of 2000 minutes in 27 League games.\n12:3 Comment: There's Nacho's goal, surprising everyone to score 1-0 in the 9th minute.\n12:10 Comment: You were very close to what was happening, you are also close to the Sevilla bench, Ricardo.\n12:15 Comment: Tell me where the story was going.\n12:16 Comment: Well, with San Paoli now protesting to the linesman.\n12:19 Comment: The moment the foul was called, everyone was watching and waiting for the situation.\n12:24 Comment: Who was going to hit him after not even protesting Marco Asensio's absence?\n12:28 Comment: And that pitch from Nacho has caught everyone off guard.\n12:31 Comment: To such an extent that we had to wait until one day Naumayenko headed to the center of the field\n12:36 Comment: to start celebrating.\n12:37 Comment: Because not even the Bernabéu audience was prepared or prepared to see an action like that.\n12:44 Comment: We will ask Nacho after the game first who called him to be there at that moment\n12:48 Comment: And then what went through his mind to bypass the specialists\n12:55 Comment: and in that stroke of cunning put Real Madrid ahead.\n12:58 Comment: Very important goal on the other hand.\n13:0 Comment: Sevilla tries to react, it's Correa who left James behind.\n13:4 Comment: He couldn't handle Cross, quite elegant from the German footballer.\n13:8 Comment: Real Madrid plays on the ground again, Morata asks for a foul on the balance.\n13:11 Comment: At least that's how Naumayenko understands it.\n13:14 Comment: The ball goes to Real Madrid, who already win after that mischievous shot by Nacho in the 9th minute of the game.\n13:21 Comment: In Seville, when they start playing in the middle of the field, they add people from the middle of the field forward.\n13:28 Comment: And you have to be very careful with two or three things.\n13:31 Comment: First of all there are two players on the field, Kovacic and Asensio,\n13:34 Comment: That in driving the balance is going to be very difficult to play.\n13:38 Comment: And secondly, there is another one, Morata, who attacks spaces very well.\n13:41 Comment: And on the counterattack, Real Madrid can do a lot of damage if Sevilla is not very attentive.\n13:52 Comment: Taking back, Morata towards the defensive line, Sergio Ramos opening.\n14:1 Comment: He tries to score a goal, but he doesn't.\n14:3 Comment: I take advantage of José and tell you, injury in the change of the mute Vázquez.\n14:6 Comment: We still don't know the extent and exactly what happened to him to have to leave the game.\n14:13 Comment: And Colondelli's change is evidently not counted as a change in the match.\n14:18 Comment: Ronaldo, who has gone out of line, has gone out of line.\n14:21 Comment: And the game of the second part of the week.\n14:23 Comment: The second part of the week, the match of the second part of the week.\n14:27 Comment: Roman Pizarro in\n14:55 Comment: The smartest of those who were there and managed to get ahead of everyone, everyone's thoughts,\n15:1 Comment: from our fans and I think the goal is very valid.\n15:6 Comment: Kroos is going to put it in from the corner.\n15:10 Comment: Kroos' service looking for the penalty spot, Nico Pareja manages to clear it.\n15:14 Comment: Asensio hooks it on the front, ball well above the goal.\n15:18 Comment: He doesn't lack confidence.\n15:20 Comment: Goalkeeper kick for Sergio Rico.\n15:23 Comment: But it was very difficult to hook that ball.\n15:26 Comment: After Nacho's goal we updated the classification in the upper zone,\n15:31 Comment: since there are no goals in the rest of the fields.\n15:33 Comment: Right now Real Madrid would be two points above FC Barcelona,\n15:36 Comment: which is drawing 0-0 against Unión Deportiva Las Palmas.\n15:41 Comment: Marco Asensio advances through the left sector, Marco puts it over Álvaro Morata's unmarking,\n15:47 Comment: Sergio Rico caught.\n15:48 Comment: As far as the rest of the games are concerned, the only change that has occurred in the scores\n15:51 Comment: It was a goal for Athletic Club, important in the fight to be in the Europa League.\n15:55 Comment: Goal against the Leganés sports club.\n16:1 Comment: Sampaoli's anger at that last action that ended in the hands of Sergio Rico.\n16:7 Comment: And after that ball didn't reach Morata,\n16:10 Comment: The Argentine coach is not very happy with the departure of his players\n16:14 Comment: and those actions, or that last action, that he allowed, even though it ended in the hands of his goalkeeper.\n16:20 Comment: Ronaldo, back for Mateo Kovacic.\n16:24 Comment: Kovacic's driving, opening on the left sector, meters for the scorer Nacho,\n16:29 Comment: Morata unchecks.\n16:31 Comment: Ball for Morata, Nacho has fallen to the ground, the action continues on the left side.\n16:35 Comment: Morata preparing for the center, Morata puts it, Carrizo clears it, Danilo picks up the loose ball.\n16:40 Comment: Good control aimed at trying to leave Vitolo behind.\n16:44 Comment: The Mineiro footballer finally assured, delivering for Toni Kroos.\n16:48 Comment: Once again, Real Madrid's attack shifts to the left.\n16:50 Comment: It's Nacho with that first-class center looking for Ronaldo.\n16:53 Comment: It prolongs it to throw it directly out.\n16:55 Comment: The French, the English, throw-in for Danilo.\n16:58 Comment: It's just that Nacho enters left-handed too, with tremendous sensitivity,\n17:2 Comment: a ball that he catches on the spike, on the bounce and puts it perfectly to the far post.\n17:9 Comment: By the way, in the case of Nacho we must remember that the last game that was played here in the League\n17:13 Comment: It was the match against Valencia, said Marcelo, another left-winger on TV.\n17:17 Comment: Today was at the beginning of the game when the man in that area,\n17:21 Comment: On this occasion, Nacho also scored for Real Madrid.\n17:24 Comment: Correa lost it in that adventure on the right wing.\n17:27 Comment: And there Nacho quickly scored Real Madrid with a cross, corner kick,\n17:32 Comment: new corner for Real Madrid.\n17:34 Comment: Nacho in a Piranean version, right?\n17:38 Comment: He is a player who is of tremendous benefit to Madrid.\n17:41 Comment: Wherever I put it, it performs perfectly.\n17:46 Comment: Varane is looking for her, Ramos is looking for her, Ronaldo is also looking for her, and Morata is not looking for her.\n17:50 Comment: James's center comes, he sends it to the far post looking for Ramos who extends Varane.\n17:54 Comment: Flag up and offside, Ricardo.\n17:56 Comment: It wasn't worth it, the French player was in an illegal position,\n18:0 Comment: At least that's what the line judge who had raised the flag thought.\n18:3 Comment: So that play was no longer valid when Rafael Varane came into contact with the ball.\n18:11 Comment: Sevilla turned out well, but very clearly.\n18:16 Comment: It's his turn to propose Jorge Sampaol's painting and it's Vitolo.\n18:19 Comment: Covered by Marco Asensio, he ended up running out of land, he ended up running out of field.\n18:25 Comment: The Canary Islands footballer from Sevilla plays for Real Madrid again.\n18:29 Comment: In the last minutes Sevilla is losing the ball easily.\n18:33 Comment: Real Madrid is applying good pressure and that is going to make the game much more complicated for Sevilla.\n18:39 Comment: We are seeing that in all duels Real Madrid is the winner.\n18:42 Comment: Asensio overflows, Asensio puts it in, Ronaldo expected it, he cuts in Sonsi.\n18:46 Comment: Esteban Jovetic is asking for it.\n18:48 Comment: However, he receives Vitolo on the left.\n18:52 Comment: Vitolo leads, Montenegrin Jovetic tries to uncheck again, after he was offside.\n18:56 Comment: Now return to the enabled position.\n19:0 Comment: But at that moment Sevilla was already building a little further back from Craneviter.\n19:5 Comment: Jovetic appears now.\n19:9 Comment: In Sonsi.\n19:11 Comment: Vitolo between the lines, again Craneviter.\n19:17 Comment: The Sevilla team plays and plays without finding a leak in Real Madrid's defense at the moment.\n19:24 Comment: Well, since the goal we haven't seen him have the ball so calmly.\n19:28 Comment: I was losing it as Raúl points out.\n19:30 Comment: The ball before crossing the center of the field and that produced a lot of risk.\n19:38 Comment: Corona receives, turns and unloads on the right.\n19:41 Comment: Preparing the Mercado center, Mercado sets it up for Jovetic.\n19:47 Comment: Was it Keylor Dabas who touched her?\n19:48 Comment: No, no, no, it was the crossbar.\n19:50 Comment: Okay because it seemed to me that I had put my hand too hard.\n19:53 Comment: Jovetic's shot is spectacular.\n19:56 Comment: Sevilla just had it.\n19:58 Comment: Raid on the right of Mercado.\n20:0 Comment: Jovetic hit him very hard.\n20:2 Comment: He hooked it wonderfully, positioning his body as he needed that ball.\n20:6 Comment: And the ball went straight to the crossbar.\n20:8 Comment: I had the feeling that it was Dabas who had touched her.\n20:10 Comment: And I thought it couldn't be that he put his hand so hard because the ball was thrown, it was repelled.\n20:15 Comment: More from Sevilla with Jovetic who emerges, steps into the area, Jovetic hits him.\n20:19 Comment: Keylor Dabas takes it with his leg in a very unorthodox way in two Jovetic actions.\n20:25 Comment: Sevilla had it.\n20:27 Comment: And now Keylor Dabas is arguing with Danilo when it comes to covering Jovetic's entry.\n20:33 Comment: With this new opportunity that the Costa Rican has had to save.\n20:38 Comment: It was said that Sevilla had lost the ball and the two best chances.\n20:41 Comment: The two best chances, both played by the same player.\n20:44 Comment: The first one especially was wonderful.\n20:46 Comment: Because he was the only striker who managed to finish that cross, that pass actually.\n20:52 Comment: The shot was magnificent, it hit the crossbar.\n20:56 Comment: I don't know if Keylor wouldn't arrive if he went inside.\n21:1 Comment: But of course, he was going so hard that there is no hand that can withstand a shot of that category.\n21:8 Comment: Jovetic, individual action, Jovetic continues, Sergio Ramos crosses his path.\n21:12 Comment: Catch Keylor Dabas.\n21:14 Comment: Yes, yes, that's why it short-circuited me a little.\n21:17 Comment: Because I remember that Neuer hand.\n21:19 Comment: Do you remember? We said, well, the hand looks like titanium in that one-on-one action in the Champions League.\n21:24 Comment: But come on, these are not very common actions.\n21:28 Comment: And when the ball went out, the question remained: well, who took it out?\n21:32 Comment: Well, it was the stick, it was the wood, it was the crossbar that prevented Jovetic from scoring.\n21:36 Comment: The Sevilla that has just been stretched in two practically consecutive actions by the attacker on loan from Inter.\n21:41 Comment: By the way, with the strange play of the goal we have not commented that Real Madrid has already played 62 consecutive games.\n21:49 Comment: Marking that they have already overcome Bayern's streak that they equaled at the Calderón with the goal from the puck.\n21:54 Comment: That Nacho was the author of that goal for 62 consecutive games scoring.\n21:58 Comment: Loose ball here in Real Madrid's second.\n22:0 Comment: Ronaldo.\n22:3 Comment:  Goal.\n22:12 Comment: From Real Madrid in 22.\n22:14 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo's goal.\n22:17 Comment: Error in Sevilla's midfield.\n22:19 Comment: Loss of Kranjevich that allows Real Madrid to mount a counterattack with many troops.\n22:24 Comment: It is directed by Asensio that he cannot invoke.\n22:26 Comment: Ráven James tries, but he doesn't find the way either.\n22:30 Comment: And in the end to an empty goal.\n22:32 Comment: Ronaldo put in the inside to double Real Madrid's advantage.\n22:36 Comment: Ronaldo scored, Real Madrid 2, Sevilla 0.\n22:39 Comment: A triplicate opportunity.\n22:42 Comment: Here is the loss of Kranjevich in the same start, in the very center of the field.\n22:47 Comment: The first to try is Asensio.\n22:50 Comment: The second after the feint is James.\n22:53 Comment: And Cristiano took advantage of the rebound, now without a goalkeeper, to make it 2 to 0.\n22:59 Comment: After the loss all four players were inside the area.\n23:3 Comment: First one tried it, then another and with that ease in James' shot,\n23:7 Comment: Well, Cristiano just had to push her.\n23:9 Comment: But the important thing is that Real Madrid arrived with many players on the attack\n23:13 Comment: And that gave him the opportunity to get this second goal.\n23:16 Comment: 21 goals in the League from Cristiano Ronaldo and before we were talking about that streak.\n23:20 Comment: 62 consecutive games scoring, well, in that streak there are already 40 for Cristiano Ronaldo.\n23:27 Comment: The call from the bench, especially Juan Malillo, to lift spirits.\n23:32 Comment: Something that has been answered from the center of the coverage with Carrizo,\n23:36 Comment: against a Sevilla that is 2-0 on the scoreboard and a Bernabéu that is coming out on top.\n23:41 Comment: They go up to the referee's whistle and Carrizo fouls.\n23:44 Comment: By the way, Ronaldo's goal is one more in his particular, personal statistic against Sevilla.\n23:50 Comment: He has not scored more goals against any rival than the Seville team.\n23:54 Comment: With today's there are already 17, no lie, 24 in 17 games.\n24:1 Comment: It must be said that James and Asensio changed bands,\n24:5 Comment: Although they both appear in the same band,\n24:7 Comment: As in the goal play, but Asensio has been on the right for a while now,\n24:13 Comment: James is on the left.\n24:16 Comment: He couldn't save that ball from the same sideline.\n24:19 Comment: Nacho, throw-in for Gabriel Mercado.\n24:26 Comment: Kroos intercepts, that ball didn't reach Jovetic.\n24:28 Comment: Kroos finds Asensio easily, Danilo goes up from the right.\n24:32 Comment: Receive the side, there's Danilo, good bike, he steps into the area, meters for Danilo, Danilo puts it in.\n24:38 Comment: Nico Pareja cut in, with tremendous ease Real Madrid managed to enter from the right.\n24:45 Comment: Yes, Danilo did it very well, and he also had a lot of time to think and it exhausted him.\n24:50 Comment: He went practically to the post, which means that all his teammates were very well covered on the edge of the area.\n24:57 Comment: Danilo, on the verge of losing, lost it, it is left to Vitolo who tries to set up the counterattack.\n25:3 Comment: Vitolo puts it in the center for Kroondeli, Jovetic, Correa and company move ahead.\n25:8 Comment: Hastily sent by Kroondeli, ball over the baseline, goal kick for Keylor Navas.\n25:14 Comment: There have already been two goals in this scenario.\n25:16 Comment: There are also scores, there are also successes, there are also achievements in other fields.\n25:20 Comment: Like for example in the duel between Unión Deportiva Las Palmas and FC Barcelona.\n25:24 Comment: Neymar just scored 0-1, so with these temporary results everything would remain the same at the top of the standings.\n25:36 Comment: Correa, facing Ramos, looked into the area, the Argentine footballer ended up losing it.\n25:43 Comment: Correa perseveres, but ends up committing fouls on James Rodríguez.\n25:47 Comment: The anger that San Paoli is carrying is tremendous, Ricardo.\n25:50 Comment: Yes, well, in very specific actions he always seems very angry when things don't work out for his team.\n25:56 Comment: And today there have obviously been three or four opportunities where he pays more attention to his players,\n26:2 Comment: Especially in the back line and those losses that they are giving to the players.\n26:5 Comment: We saw the updated classification with that momentary tie at 87 points between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid.\n26:12 Comment: Sevilla, despite not scoring with the current results, would be securing fourth position.\n26:17 Comment: Because at the moment their pursuer, Villarreal, who can threaten that place is Sevilla.\n26:22 Comment: And Sevilla, despite not scoring, with the current results, would be securing fourth position.\n26:27 Comment: Vitolo, down Vitolo, a foul is called and there is one Ricardo.\n26:30 Comment: It is very close to the line or the peak of the area.\n26:33 Comment: From the peak of the area, it said that's where Undino Mayenko goes, Toni Kroos stayed to protest.\n26:38 Comment: However, the foul is clear, a dangerous foul that Esteban Jovetic, the Montenegrin, is already heading towards.\n26:44 Comment: And that's where the peak of the area is going to be.\n26:52 Comment: It's a clear foul, a dangerous foul that Esteban Jovetic, the Montenegrin, is already heading towards.\n27:1 Comment: There we had the repeated action.\n27:4 Comment: The knockdown on Vitolo that gives Sevilla this good dead ball opportunity.\n27:9 Comment: Jovetic is an excellent shooter and he already showed that before Real Madrid his nose is sharpened.\n27:14 Comment: In his first games in Spain he managed to score in two different competitions, also in the League and the Cup.\n27:19 Comment: That's right, what happens is that he is very angled, he has to hit it very well from there to surprise Navas.\n27:30 Comment: He places a barrier of four players, Navas starts, Jovetic hits him, Jovetic put his head in that defensive action.\n27:36 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo, the ball is lost over the baseline, it will be a corner kick for Sevilla.\n27:42 Comment: At the moment when a new goal arrives, not here as is evident, but in the Gran Canaria stadium.\n27:48 Comment: Luis Suárez scores, FC Barcelona's second, 0-2 against Unión Deportiva Las Palmas.\n27:53 Comment: So more elements in favor of that tie that continues at the top of the table.\n27:58 Comment: Real Madrid and Barcelona already win by two goals.\n28:3 Comment: Sevilla tries to discount it, the center is looking for a market, the chipped shot ended up being caught by Keylor Navas\n28:9 Comment: which puts her in quick movement to favor her team's counterattack.\n28:12 Comment: Morata opening, James is not going to arrive, Krondeli will.\n28:15 Comment: Try to hunt down that loose ball in Zonzi, Nacho appears first and secures possession by touching back for Keylor.\n28:27 Comment: Rafael Varane, stretches on the right Danilo, first Escoba Siic, Varane again.\n28:34 Comment: It's Marque de Asensio who accelerates paired with Lengle.\n28:38 Comment: Marco stops, he cue's up Danilo, Danilo on the ground, Krondeli is called for a foul and Ricardo indicates it, there is a foul in favor of Real Madrid.\n28:46 Comment: It's going to be almost like a mini corner because the ball stays close to the side, Krondeli is asked for a card\n28:52 Comment: But for now Undiano Mallenco prefers to keep the game clean of cautions, a dangerous foul for Real Madrid.\n29:0 Comment: If there is anyone with the right to be late in this game it is Krondeli, who hasn't played in a year.\n29:5 Comment: In another type of situation, in a match that was a little tighter, maybe it would have been a yellow card, but everything that is happening is being very sporting.\n29:16 Comment: It's true, a very good situation to center, but be careful, the one who hits it is James and with a changed leg and we are not surprised that he tries directly.\n29:27 Comment: I also wanted to highlight Danilo, the first 30 minutes he is seen with much more confidence, he is contributing things in attack and today he is seen with much more intensity and above all with confidence.\n29:38 Comment: Next to the ball Kross and James Rodríguez, also suspiciously close to the ball Marco Asensio.\n29:45 Comment: Vitolo now breaks away from the barrier to watch him, there goes James, James hits him.\n29:50 Comment: It was a cross with the intensity of a shot or the other way around, or it was a shot with the trajectory of a cross.\n29:57 Comment: We have seen in Sevilla's previous free kick that it was more of a center than a shot, this was more of a shot than a center.\n30:3 Comment: By the way Ricardo, the grips, the movements within the area were intense in this center shot by James.\n30:8 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo's shirt bears witness to this.\n30:11 Comment: That's what he's saying now to the line judge, pointing to his shirt and saying, here, they grabbed me in the area of ​​my pectorals.\n30:18 Comment: But we also come from an action in the Real Madrid area where Nacho also claimed a grab.\n30:23 Comment: Well, it's a game with a lot of friction in every set piece and especially after how Real Madrid scored with that way of surprising Nacho's 1-0 lead.\n30:36 Comment: In short, Kranevic, from the right.\n30:42 Comment: Vertical send towards Correa's unmarking, he tries to win it and beats Krondeli with a header.\n30:46 Comment: Heel strap, again for Krondeli, good action from Sevilla.\n30:49 Comment: Run in the direction of the Correa area, Betis is asking for it, Correa sticks.\n30:53 Comment: Keylor Navas takes it down, he had it to discount Sevilla.\n30:57 Comment: Joaquín Correa had it in an action in which he opted for the shot, having two combination possibilities within the area.\n31:5 Comment: Yes, he was totally alone, Kroos abandoned him, he motioned to Varane to cross, so that he could interrupt that penetration.\n31:14 Comment: Wow, what a ball from Vitolo, me Betis, me Betis, me Betis.\n31:18 Comment: To the crossbar, Sevilla insists, Vitolo insists.\n31:22 Comment: Ball for Correa that leaves the area, Correa leaves it.\n31:25 Comment: In short for Vitolo who turns on himself, he wants to leave James behind.\n31:29 Comment: There is a footballer from Sevilla meanwhile lying on the pitch, it is Lenglet.\n31:34 Comment: But oblivious to that circumstance, the San Paoli players play and play until now,\n31:38 Comment: Ricardo Vitolo throws the ball out so that the Sevilla defense can be served.\n31:43 Comment: Lenglet's move is with Cristiano Ronaldo.\n31:45 Comment: We must remember that Cristiano has four warnings and is under suspension.\n31:50 Comment: At the moment Undiano Majenko is coming to tell Cristiano that he has to change his shirt.\n31:57 Comment: What the Gagarrón footballer was pointing out before is that his shirt is torn.\n32:0 Comment: Chiendo was wearing a t-shirt waiting for the band and now Undiano Majenko is causing the change\n32:5 Comment: on Cristiano's shirt that stays off the pitch.\n32:10 Comment: After having also been the protagonist of that play with Lenglet and which was claimed as a foul by Sevilla.\n32:17 Comment: Come on, in parts. First what happens between Lenglet and Cristiano, which is important\n32:22 Comment: due to the circumstance that Ricardo pointed out regarding the four yellow cards that the Portuguese Real Madrid player is with.\n32:27 Comment: If he was looking for a yellow, he did everything possible to find it on this play.\n32:34 Comment: And after what has to do purely with the football proposal. The finish is sensational.\n32:41 Comment: Jovetich holds on wonderfully and hits it over the goalkeeper. It hits the crossbar\n32:46 Comment: And there the action is spoiled for the Montenegrin who did everything right except the end.\n32:50 Comment: There he showed the class he has and the coldness. I think he did everything well and for him it was a shame that the ball hit the crossbar.\n33:0 Comment: I think Sampaoli has to be angry because I think Sevilla had a chance to score a goal.\n33:8 Comment: The result they have is 2-0 and because of those specific errors, Real Madrid is ahead.\n33:15 Comment: A little more and it's a waste of that.\n33:17 Comment: Yes, it had been a bore but he did very well with more quality.\n33:22 Comment: Well, he hit it great. The ball came down behind Keylor's head and the second shot hit the post that Sevilla hit.\n33:32 Comment: We took the opportunity to see that match between Lengley and Cristiano Ronaldo again, the performance recovers it.\n33:38 Comment: Later would come that little sting from Jovetich who has already found the wood twice in his attempts to beat Keylor Navas.\n33:45 Comment: There it is again Jovetich, Mercado, ball for a corner after Ramos's touch.\n33:49 Comment: We take advantage of the break because if not live we will get more goals in other fields.\n33:53 Comment: Influential goals, for example in the fight for access to the Europa League.\n33:56 Comment: Real Sociedad scored with Xavi Prieto's penalty and also a goal from Sporting in Eibar, goal from Burgi.\n34:5 Comment: Jorge Sampaoli's team is still looking for 2-1.\n34:10 Comment: Launch from the corner looking for Enzonzi, Mercado and company.\n34:13 Comment: Send to the near post, Real Madrid fails to clear it, it is left to Kovasic who commands the counterattack by Zidane's team.\n34:19 Comment: And with Marco Asensio, he puts it too deep.\n34:23 Comment: Regarding the progress of the Mallorcan footballer, Sevilla's recovery will be a throw-in.\n34:27 Comment: Asensio again on the left and James again on the right.\n34:40 Comment: Mercado puts it into play, Jovetic extends with a header, Varane assures, playing defense again.\n34:50 Comment: Real Madrid, impressed by the lower part of the updated classification after that Sporting goal that fills Rubi's team with life.\n35:1 Comment: Rubi is on 30 points, with 33 at the moment, Leganés is losing on its visit to Athletic Club.\n35:8 Comment: And also with Deportivo stopping, momentarily adding a unit in their move to Villarreal.\n35:17 Comment: Sevilla did not lose face in the match, in fact they created three or four very clear goal situations.\n35:24 Comment: We didn't even have time to comment on Correa, which was hand in hand, very well resolved by Keylor.\n35:31 Comment: Immediately afterward he had the shot on the post.\n35:39 Comment: The Seville team is increasing its offensive production, at the moment without a reward, sometimes Keylor, sometimes the post.\n35:47 Comment: They have frustrated the attempts of Jovetic, Correa and company.\n35:54 Comment: Ramos back for Keylor, look how he puts pressure on Zonzi trying to make it difficult for Real Madrid to leave.\n36:0 Comment: Long ball, he ate it from the English satole.\n36:4 Comment: Carrizo assures, playing back for Sergio Rico, who is trying to partner with Mercado.\n36:11 Comment: Nacho won with a header, Morata.\n36:14 Comment: Fight, sequel between two, the ball goes to Kovacic.

So Sevilla plays quickly.\n36:28 Comment: He tries to take advantage of Vitolo's speed. He cuts Vitolo against Kroos.\n36:32 Comment: Vitolo continues, Asensio falls to the ground, the ball remains with Trompicones.\n36:36 Comment: The San Paoli team is missing Toni Kroos.\n36:39 Comment: I think he pointed out the previous one by Marco Asensio.\n36:42 Comment: More than Kroos's, I think he touched the ball and what he pointed out was that the Sevilla player was already coming.\n36:48 Comment: stumbling in the action of Marco Asensio.\n36:52 Comment:  Belt.\n36:58 Comment: Distributed in Zonzi.

Great wall between Jovetich and Correa.\n39:45 Comment: Two players who have a lot of class and have shown here that they are capable of creating danger for the Real Madrid defense.\n39:52 Comment: Sevilla's action was brilliant.\n39:55 Comment: Very brilliant, I would say, the way the San Paol team got up.\n39:58 Comment: And after conceding the second goal in the 22nd minute, we already had a good number of clear dangerous chances.\n40:5 Comment: With shots hitting the crossbar on two occasions.\n40:8 Comment: And with three or four truly demanding interventions by Keylor Navas.\n40:11 Comment: Especially Keylor.\n40:14 Comment: There is a lack of Correa.

Pareja.\n40:52 Comment: Puneble didn't appreciate anything one day, not that he was very much on top of the play.\n40:55 Comment: On the other hand, Ricardo, they do indicate a foul to Sergio

Cristiano Ronaldo.\n42:42 Comment: Nacho is claiming it on the left.\n42:45 Comment: Ronaldo has been delivered to Kroos.\n42:47 Comment: And now the German puts it on Nacho, who receives it with much less advantage than he could have had in the beginning.\n42:53 Comment: Corea is going to arrive Krondel and the Brazilian defender puts his leg into Danilo forcefully.\n43:2 Comment: Stop.\n43:7 Comment: Asensio cutting against Vitolo in a sensitive area.\n43:10 Comment: Marco Asensio continues.\n43:12 Comment: I wanted to throw the pipe at Engle.\n43:13 Comment: The last one to play.\n43:14

play.\n43:21 Comment: He was dressed in red.\n43:23 Comment: It was Engle.\n43:24 Comment: Sanpaoli doesn't agree with that, Ricardo.\n43:26 Comment:  No no.\n43:27 Comment: It is also true that Sanpaoli was practically on top of the play.\n43:30 Comment:  Yeah.\n43:31 Comment: And this type of action is very much to be protested because every game is experienced very intensely.\n43:36 Comment: But in this action he was practically on top.\n43:38 Comment: And despite the protest.\n43:40 Comment: One day he didn't play on the line and they gave the ball to Real Madrid.\n43:45 Comment: Zonzi cannot associate with Vitolo.\n43:47 Comment: Sevilla's number 20 is losing that control.\n43:52 Comment: At the doorstep of the last minute of regulation time in the first half.\n44:4

Comment: I think Real Madrid is already asking for a break.\n44:28 Comment: I think that in the last minutes Sevilla had the ball and had those clear chances.\n44:34 Comment: And with this advantage that Real Madrid has, I think they have to reorganize.\n44:39 Comment: And the second part around the ball.\n44:41 Comment: Try to finish the game or increase that advantage you have.\n44:47 Comment: Asensio.\n44:48 Comment: He wanted to get rid of Engle with a little bit of fortune.\n44:51 Comment: Marco Asensio finally keeps it.\n44:56 Comment: Many players with the soul of forwards in the

    "summary": "At the famed Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, Real Madrid and Sevilla faced off in an electrifying La Liga match that witnessed a potent mix of tactical prowess, dramatic turns, and stellar performances, concluding with Real Madrid asserting a dominant 4-1 victory over Sevilla. As the first half unfolded under the clear skies of Madrid, early indications foreshadowed a clash that would be both fierce and technical.\n\nReal Madrid wasted no time establishing their grip on the game. At minute 9, a quick-witted move saw Nacho skillfully convert a free-kick before Sevilla's players had finished arranging their defensive wall, a testament to his sharp football intelligence. This controversial goal unleashed a flurry of protests from Sevilla, underlining the high stakes and intensity of the match from the outset.\n\nSevilla, despite their depleted squad and last-minute adjustments, showed commendable resolve, navigating the adversity with determination. They managed to advance with several probing attacks, testing Real Madrid's defensive lines. In the 19th minute, it was Vitolo's incisive run that illustrated Sevilla's intention to fight back, but Real Madrid's defense, bolstered by the likes of Sergio Ramos and Raphael Varane, held firm.\n\nHaving endured a lengthy period devoid of competitive football due to injury, Michael Kroondeli’s return added a poignant narrative to the day's events. His presence was felt early as he attempted to anchor Sevilla's midfield against Real Madrid's relentless pressing. Kroondeli's influence in midfield was marked by moments of incisive passing and organized play that kept Sevilla's hopes alive.\n\nAs the match progressed, Real Madrid's tactical formation, a flexible 4-4-2, enabled fluid transitions between defense and attack. This versatility was evident when Morata capitalized on Marco Asensio's swift counter-attack, only to be denied by an offside flag.\n\nSevilla's tactical formation, which alternated between a three-center-back setup and a more flexible back four, struggled to contain Real Madrid's aggressive forward line. Yet, Sevilla managed to adapt, with moments of coherence especially through Kroondeli and Vitolo orchestrating attacks. Vitolo's ventures into Real Madrid's final third were marked by quick dribbles and coordinated play with Jovetic, providing Sevilla with much-needed attacking impetus.\n\nThe first half saw Real Madrid creating multiple chances, with Ronaldo, Asensio, and Morata persistently knocking on Sevilla's defensive door. Real Madrid's tactical discipline and breadth in attack were underscored by these relentless waves, keeping Sevilla's defenders on high alert. However, despite these efforts, their second goal wouldn't come until the 22nd minute of the second half when Ronaldo tapped in a rebounded effort following an initial feint by James Rodriguez.\n\nSevilla's persistence bore fruit when Jovetic found the net in the 59th minute, curving a precise shot from the front edge of the penalty area, reducing the deficit to 2-1. This goal was an affirmation of Sevilla’s capability to launch effective counter-attacks and showcased Jovetic's quality as a striker. His clinical finish reignited Sevilla's hopes and added a tense atmosphere to the Bernabéu.\n\nHowever, Real Madrid's tactical flexibility and depth came to the fore again. The introduction of Casemiro and Lucas Vázquez injected fresh legs and defensive stability. This tactical switch allowed Luka Modric to join the fray and orchestrate from the midfield, providing further control and composure to Real Madrid's play. The addition of these players altered the dynamic of the game, effectively stifling Sevilla's attempts to claw back further.\n\nMarco Asensio, who had been a significant creative force throughout the game, continued to weave his magic. His swift runs and precise passes troubled Sevilla's defense repeatedly. In a brilliant piece of play in the 77th minute, Kroos dissected Sevilla's defensive setup with a pinpoint pass that found Ronaldo who struck with his left foot, directing the ball unstoppably into the top corner. This goal underscored Ronaldo’s impeccable finishing ability and reinforced Real Madrid’s lead to 3-1.\n\nSevilla's efforts to mount a comeback saw Gabi Mercado and Walter Montoya pushing forward, yet their attempts were consistently nullified by Real Madrid's organized defense and quick counter-attacks. As Sevilla poured men forward, gaps increasingly opened up for Real Madrid’s counter-attacks. In one such swift transition, orchestrated yet again by Kroos, Nacho's efficient back pass found Toni Kroos, who expertly placed the ball into the bottom corner in the final minutes of the match. Kroos’ goal, arriving in the 83rd minute, was a demonstration of precision and calm under pressure and cemented Real Madrid's victory.\n\nBy the match's conclusion, Real Madrid’s meticulous planning and execution had secured them a decisive win. They showcased not only tactical flexibility and individual brilliance, but also a depth that allowed them to navigate the varied challenges posed by Sevilla. This match wasn’t just a narrative of goals and saves; it was a strategic chess game with Zidane making pivotal decisions that swayed the match’s direction.\n\nThe aftermath of the game left the Bernabéu buzzing, both with the joy of the victory and speculations regarding James Rodríguez's future. His slow exit and reciprocal applause to the stands hinted at a possible farewell. Real Madrid’s collective effort, led by standout performances from players like Ronaldo, Nacho, and Kroos, was instrumental in their success, emphasizing that while individual moments can steal the spotlight, football is ultimately a team sport defined by collective resilience and strategy.\n\nFor Sevilla, despite the loss, the performances of Kroondeli, Vitolo, and Jovetic provided moments of optimism. They demonstrated that even in the face of significant injuries and tactical adjustments, their drive and competitive spirit remained undiminished.\n\nThus, with 4-1 against a resilient Sevilla, Real Madrid not only secured three vital points but also laid a strong footing in their quest for La Liga. The match, infused with strategic brilliance and individual moments of magic, was a reminder of why football garners such fervent passion and undying allegiance worldwide."
