    "summary": "In what was a highly anticipated clash between the two giants of Madrid, the atmosphere inside the stadium was electric as Atlético Madrid hosted Real Madrid on a crisp evening. From the first whistle, both teams showed an eagerness to stamp their authority on the game, and the tension was palpable.\n\nThe match got underway with Real Madrid kicking off. Immediately, there was an aggressive edge to the encounter, with Real committing a foul just nine seconds in, setting the tone for what was to be a combative first half. Atlético quickly responded with an indirect free-kick, but the action was repeatedly interrupted by fouls from both sides. As early as the 1:31-minute mark, Atlético committed their first foul, followed by an indirect free-kick for Real.\n\nThe opening minutes continued in a scrappy fashion, with another foul by Real at 2:25 minutes. This led to an indirect free-kick for Atlético, but they were unable to capitalize on the set-piece. The game saw its first real stoppage at 3:52 when the ball went out of play. Atlético took the ensuing throw-in and managed to earn a corner at 4:51, but nothing came of it.\n\nThe game continued in the same scrappy manner, with frequent interruptions due to fouls and the ball going out of play. An attempt by Atlético at 8:39 saw their shot go off target, marking their first notable attempt at goal. Real Madrid responded with a clearance, and after a series of throw-ins, an indirect free-kick by Real following a foul by Atlético in the 10th minute put them on the front foot. This sequence ended with Real managing a shot on target, though it lacked the necessary power and precision to trouble Atlético’s goalkeeper.\n\nAs the first half progressed, it became clear that Real Madrid was beginning to find some rhythm. At 11:22, they managed another shot on target, followed by a shot off target minutes later, displaying their growing dominance. The most significant moment came at 22:17 when Real Madrid finally broke the deadlock. After a sustained period of pressure, a direct free-kick from Real led to a crucial goal, pushing them ahead at last.\n\nAtlético Madrid, now trailing, tried to rally back immediately with a couple of attempts, including a shot off target at 24:00. However, the game continued to be marred by frequent fouls, with Atlético receiving a yellow card at 25:27 following a particularly rough challenge. While Atlético earned a corner at 26:55, they couldn't produce anything effective from it and seemed to struggle to get a foothold in the game.\n\nReal Madrid, meanwhile, kept pressing forward, managing several shots on target, including a notable one at 30:03. Atlético’s attempts were hampered by offside calls and ineffective shots on target as seen at 31:21. The final minutes of the first half continued much in the same vein, with the play often interrupted by the ball going out of play or being frequently cleared by either side. As the whistle blew for halftime, Real Madrid were leading 1-0, having capitalized on their opportunities more effectively.\n\nThe second half kicked off with Atlético Madrid looking to mount a comeback. They took the initiative almost immediately with a series of throw-ins and a corner at the 2:30-minute mark, followed by a shot off target. Real Madrid, however, glued together their defensive lines, frequently making clearances and holding strong. Atlético’s persistence saw them register a shot on target at 5:46, but Real's goalkeeper was equal to the task.\n\nAs the second half wore on, the fouls kept coming, maintaining the edgy feel of the first half. Atlético earned a series of corner kicks and a few shots on target, the most notable coming at 21:30, but their efforts were consistently thwarted by a resilient Real Madrid defense. Real, too, kept pushing forward, and their persistence paid off dramatically. At 25:37, after Atlético conceded a penalty, Real Madrid expertly converted it, putting them 2-0 up and significantly increasing their advantage.\n\nReal's dominance was further cemented at 31:21, with yet another goal, taking their tally to 3-0. This goal, a masterstroke of precise passing and clinical finishing, seemed to deflate Atlético’s spirits even further. Although they tried to regroup through substitutions and tactical adjustments, including bringing on fresh legs at 16:01 and 16:05, Real Madrid's control over the game remained largely unchallenged.\n\nThe game continued with its aggressive undertones, with both teams being penalized for fouls and awarded yellow cards. By the 33rd minute, it was clear that Atlético's chances of staging a comeback were dwindling. Real's tactical substitutions at 33:53 and again later in the match helped maintain their fluidity and energy levels.\n\nAs the game entered its final stages, the tempo slowed somewhat, and Real Madrid seemed content to manage their lead. Atlético Madrid, to their credit, never stopped fighting and managed a couple more shots on target and corners, such as their attempt at 41:33. However, Real's defense remained unyielding.\n\nIn a game characterized by fouls, ball clearances, and stoppages, Real Madrid’s clinical finishing stood out as the deciding factor. Atlético Madrid had moments of potential but were ultimately unable to convert their opportunities into goals. The final whistle blew with the scoreboard reading Atlético Madrid 0 - 3 Real Madrid, reflecting the visitors' superior play, tactical discipline, and relentless pursuit of goals.\n\nIt was a comprehensive victory for Real, who showcased their depth, composure under pressure, and tactical astuteness. The match served as a stark reminder of their dominance in one of football’s most fierce local rivalries, providing an exhilarating spectacle for their fans and a challenging evening for the home side."
