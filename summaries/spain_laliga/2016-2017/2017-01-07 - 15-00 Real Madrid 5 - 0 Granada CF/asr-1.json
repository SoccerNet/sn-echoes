Marcelo came hurriedly to close, but in fact,\n17:12 Comment: A carelessness on the part of the two centre-backs had allowed a very dangerous space.\n17:18 Comment: Fortunately, Varane's height and authority in the aerial game solved the problem.\n17:28 Comment: Casemiro is first until Modric's delivery, Benzema does not arrive.\n17:32 Comment: Back Tabanú for David Lomban.\n17:34 Comment: The goal did not change Granada's script, which continues to group many people from midfield to the back, closing the spaces,\n17:41 Comment: trying to prevent the development of Real Madrid's collective game.\n17:47 Comment: This is practically the first intervention of Jeremy Pogba, the player on loan from Chelsea who connects with Luce Agbo.\n17:54 Comment: The Nigerian advances, breaks inside, Andreas Pereira is asking for it, he plays first class.\n18:0 Comment: Pisaria Tabanú, the name Tabanú.\n18:3 Comment: Rafael Varane clears, it will be a throw-in for Lucas Alcaraz's team,\n18:8 Comment: That came out with a lot of intention, with a lot of order and also with speed.\n18:12 Comment: Yes, Pogba who has ability, who also has...\n18:17 Comment: I think he touches the ball first and then trips, more than anything else.\n18:23 Comment: We are working on this Tabanú action.\n18:25 Comment: Immediately prior to Real Madrid's goal, because it could be the controversial detail,\n18:31 Comment: The controversial detail of the play in that loss by Samper, which ends up translating, as we said, into Isco's goal.\n18:39 Comment: We're back live, we're back in action at the Bernabéu with this throw-in from Gabriel Silva.\n18:44 Comment: Try to turn around Andreas Pereira, the player on loan from Manchester United does it very well.\n18:48 Comment: Pereira continues, Tabanú continues, Tabanú continues, Isco continues.\n18:52 Comment: The player on loan from Manchester United is very good.\n18:54 Comment: Pereira continues, the room is great, more from Pereira, Pereira hits him, up.\n18:59 Comment: Good intervention, good appearance by Andreas Pereira.\n19:2 Comment: In that drive, dodging rivals, Keylor Navas' shot well over the goal.\n19:7 Comment: Well, it took them a few minutes to get loose, but Granada is already beginning to find space and generate, at least, some danger.\n19:16 Comment: Two approaches from the left wing, now this shot.\n19:20 Comment: Well, the party gives the impression that it wants to balance itself.\n19:24 Comment: Toni Kroos was asking his teammates for a little more intensity, to be more on top of Pereira in this case,\n19:32 Comment: so that he would not shoot with that comfort with which he has left up to four Real Madrid players.\n19:38 Comment: He is the player with the greatest projection or greatest offensive spirit of those who make up Lucas Alcaraz's midfield.\n19:46 Comment: Marcelo.\n19:49 Comment: In the face of Isco, who would already step, he is thinking, Isco puts it for Marcelo, he sends it back, Ronaldo doesn't arrive, Modric keeps it, who saves it with the shot.\n19:56 Comment: Modric, pats Nemo Cho, with a ball inside, and that goal counts.\n20:2 Comment:  Goal!\n20:11 Comment: From Real Madrid in the 20th of the game, goal from Karim Benzema.\n20:15 Comment: Luka Modric's shot from the front, Nemo Cho taps but does not block, there that loose ball becomes an invitation to score for Karim Benzema,\n20:24 Comment: He scores the second of the game. Goal from Real Madrid, goal from Benzema.\n20:28 Comment: There's a mess or not, there's a mess, there's offside or not. It looks good, doesn't it Jorge? Real Madrid 2, Granada 0.\n20:35 Comment: Well, first of all the play starts with Marcelo, who unloads the center from the only possible place.\n20:40 Comment: The center reaches the second line, finally to Modric, who seems to hesitate, however, he chooses the shot, crossed, Ochoa gives that rebound,\n20:55 Comment: and attentively Benzema pushes it towards the goal, offside. We have to see the side on the other side, to see if in a slightly wider shot we are able to clarify that.\n21:9 Comment: Be that as it may, they protested a lot and based on the first replay it seems rightly so, Ricardo, the Granada players,\n21:15 Comment: The fact that the referee validated that goal by Benzema in an instant like a half-suspense after the ball went in.\n21:21 Comment: Yes, after Ochoa's rebound Benzema finishes, it is the fifth goal in the league for the French striker, who was a little further ahead of the defense,\n21:28 Comment: That is to say, the linesman should have raised the flag, but he didn't, and the referee accepted this as 2-0 in the face of resignation from Lucas Alcaraz,\n21:37 Comment: Now he is telling the fourth referee about Karim Benzema's illegal position.\n21:43 Comment: So, the Granada coach is angry, he is still in that conversation with the fourth referee, but he cannot avoid the 2-0 21 and a half of the match for Real Madrid.\n21:55 Comment: It was more than evident in that replay that Benzema was in an advanced position at the time of Luka Modric's shot, which gave him the advantage,\n22:3 Comment: It allowed him to reach the ball rejected by Memo Ochoa before anyone else.\n22:10 Comment: As the Granada players protested, Benzema himself looked at the linesman to see what was happening, and when he saw that the flag was not raised,\n22:18 Comment: He ran to celebrate this goal, which only increases his already excellent statistics against this rival.\n22:25 Comment: No team in the world has Benzema scored more goals than Granada, taking into account the one he just scored and updating the statistics,\n22:32 Comment: We are going to 10 goals in 11 matches.\n22:35 Comment: Yes, in this shot there is no doubt that it was offside.\n22:39 Comment: I wanted to know if the rival who had accompanied Marcelo in his overflow had remained parked, but no, Marcelo remained parked,\n22:46 Comment: and not his rival who went out of his way.\n22:51 Comment: And Benzema was a meter ahead, yes, yes.\n22:54 Comment: The referee's error validated Real Madrid so much that it doubled the advantage of Zidane's team,\n23:1 Comment: and that already paints a panorama that is at least compromised or complicated for Granada.\n23:5 Comment: Yes, indeed, it is 2 to 0 when we are barely 25 minutes into the game, it is a very big burden at the Bernabéu.\n23:14 Comment: This is a field that weighs a lot when Real Madrid becomes the winner,\n23:20 Comment: When you score your first goal for your rival, a certain martyrdom begins.\n23:27 Comment: However, not against Depor but against Sporting, and with this same scenario,\n23:33 Comment: Abelardo's team managed to get back into the game and put a lot of pressure on it,\n23:38 Comment: To the point of missing a penalty with 2 to 1 on the scoreboard with 12 minutes remaining in a match\n23:42 Comment: in which Zinedine Zidane himself had acknowledged at the end of the match that his team had disconnected,\n23:46 Comment: He had played a very bad second half.\n23:49 Comment: In addition, Granada does not seem to be broken, it keeps the team in order,\n23:57 Comment: And what costs him the most is creating danger.\n24:19 Comment: Isco is very active, let's remember that in the second goal play he is also the one who partners with Marcelo,\n24:28 Comment: On the left wing, in this same play he is the one who enables Benzema,\n24:33 Comment: He is being a top-level intermediary.\n24:48 Comment: And now, to clear it, new corner for Real Madrid.\n24:53 Comment: A very clear chance, Nacho missed the header when he was in a very favorable situation to score the third goal.\n25:7 Comment: Toni Kroos again at service, 5 white shirts looking for the finish near Memo Ochoa,\n25:12 Comment: Kroos with Rosca, he puts the head in Artem Kravets, he looks for Gabriel Silva, he keeps it for Casemiro,\n25:17 Comment: He gives back for Luka Modric to rework the attacking action.\n25:24 Comment: I don't know to what extent, José, Memo Ochoa could talk about the annoyance that the Sun causes him,\n25:29 Comment: He has it right now very much in front of him in the rebound play or in some of the actions,\n25:35 Comment: I say this because of the impact on some plays that may have with the Mexican goalkeeper as the protagonist,\n25:40 Comment: and how the Sun is shining today at this time of the morning at the Bernabéu.\n25:43 Comment: If I were you, I would ask you for the cap, Ricardo.\n25:47 Comment: I'll leave it if you want, eh.\n25:49 Comment: It's also a very vintage sporty cap, right? From the 50s.\n25:55 Comment: Luka Modric plays back for Casemiro.\n26:2 Comment: Facing Isco, Marcelo accompanies him, there is Marcelo again, the maneuver is excellent, he steps on it, Marcelo continues,\n26:7 Comment: Back post, Ronaldo.\n26:10 Comment:  Goal!\n26:18 Comment: From Real Madrid in the 26th minute, goal from Cristiano Ronaldo with that cross from the left\n26:24 Comment: which sends the current Ballon d'Or to be saved with a header after an action.\n26:30 Comment: Of course, I think it forces us to give Marcelo an important part of the goal.\n26:35 Comment: Yes, that's it. And also Isco, who is at the origin of the play, is associated with Marcelo,\n26:41 Comment: who does one of his usual pranks, dribbles with the player who was already dribbled\n26:48 Comment: and finally he throws a magnificent cross that Ronaldo's voracity converts into the third goal.\n26:57 Comment: There is Marcelo's little step, the precise center and the academic header with the entire forehead of Cristiano Ronaldo\n27:4 Comment: To score the third of the game, Ricardo.\n27:6 Comment: And that is the eleventh in Cristiano Ronaldo's tally, not only in the Santander League,\n27:11 Comment: But it is that he has also scored eleven against Granada, which is said to be quick,\n27:15 Comment: because in April 2015 in a single match he scored five in that 9-1\n27:21 Comment: with which Real Madrid defeated Granada on a Sunday morning.\n27:25 Comment: So the outlook is ugly for Lucas Alcaraz's team, which remains in the technical zone, arms crossed,\n27:32 Comment: Trying to give instructions to his players, the more comfortable the match will be for Real Madrid,\n27:37 Comment: For the leader of this Santander League 3-0 and we have not reached thirty in the game.\n27:44 Comment: Madrid is implacable, implacable.\n27:47 Comment: He is serious in the pressure, he is very calm in the generation of the game,\n27:54 Comment: very elastic in the center of the field to connect with the forwards\n27:58 Comment: And finally very effective in front of goal, because he didn't have as many chances.\n28:3 Comment: If they had five it's a lot, of the five you have to count three goals, because this team has goals in their blood.\n28:11 Comment: Sorry, José, there are twelve goals that Cristiano has scored against Granada,\n28:15 Comment: Not eleven, twelve, with the one you just scored this Saturday morning.\n28:19 Comment: Now a deep debut, we get Andreas Pereira, Keylor Navas gets it.\n28:25 Comment: Well, look, if we add to that personal statistic of Cristiano, that of Karim Benzema,\n28:29 Comment: who also scored today, it turns out that between only two players\n28:33 Comment: They have scored more than twenty goals against the same rival.\n28:41 Comment: Nacho, back Marcelo for Keylor Navas.\n28:45 Comment: Although the difference in the score is widening, it has already reached three units,\n28:52 Comment: Granada still does not press much higher than it did before.\n28:57 Comment: He feels comfortable waiting for Granada, punished by the enormous effectiveness of Real Madrid,\n29:7 Comment: He felt comfortable from the first minute.\n29:15 Comment: Casemiro, he was on top of Uche, Toni Kroos plays for Karim Benzema.\n29:21 Comment: Always very close to the three Real Madrid midfielders,\n29:24 Comment: So they can be found in this association game that the team is constantly proposing.\n29:30 Comment: By the way, Jorge, if we've been in the game for almost half an hour, I'll ask you.\n29:34 Comment: In what position has Isco played, how would you answer me?\n29:37 Comment: In a more or less concrete way? Because it is very difficult to stick to Isco's movement\n29:45 Comment: in a position as we know it in a more or less orthodox way, right? It's all over everything.\n29:49 Comment: Forward of the entire court, right? It would be necessary to define him. He appears on the right, he appears on the left,\n29:55 Comment: He appears in the center, as in the goal play, and also pulls back to engage with the midfielders.\n30:4 Comment: Look how they look for their place to receive the ball.

is asked for goals, but he does deserve a joy of that kind\n13:50 Comment: because his work has the precision of a surgeon behind the two creative midfielders of Real Madrid.\n13:59 Comment: There were 15 players who had scored in the League with the Real Madrid shirt this season.\n14:5 Comment: Casemiro now scores his first goal in the Santander League this year and it is his sixteenth.\n14:10 Comment: He is the sixteenth to inscribe his name in that table of directors.\n14:15 Comment: At the moment when Lucas Alcaraz is going to make the first change,\n14:18 Comment: Javi Márquez is going to come in to reinforce the Nasrid team's midfield.\n14:22 Comment: Gabriel Silva, good cut, about to step into the area.\n14:25 Comment: Gabriel follows Trompicones, clears Real Madrid, bald, loose ball in the front.\n14:30 Comment: Modric ends up going to the ground, he fouled Andreas Pereira and took advantage of this interruption in the game.\n14:37 Comment: Lucas Alcaraz to make his first change, Ricardo.\n14:41 Comment: And the one who leaves, Uche, after seeing that yellow, after getting distracted marking Casemiro,\n14:48 Comment: which provided the opportunity for the Brazilian midfielder to score the fifth goal of the match,\n14:55 Comment: He leaves the field of play, Javi Márquez enters to occupy his position in the center of the field.\n15:1 Comment: He had committed those two infractions in the last few minutes.\n15:4 Comment: One of them already made him carry the yellow condition and he also lost the mark in a big way.\n15:10 Comment: In the last goal it seemed that in the last actions Uche was leaving the field.\n15:14 Comment: Too many things not to attract the coach's attention.\n15:18 Comment: In his place is the Catalan Javi Márquez.\n15:21 Comment: We have seen in the last approach to Granada how Carvajal is surpassed\n15:26 Comment: and how it is Asensio who doubles it and ends up resolving a defensive situation.\n15:30 Comment: I think that shows a little the degree of commitment that Real Madrid has at the moment.\n15:37 Comment: Asensio had also defended a ball with aggression as a right winger\n15:43 Comment: That one does not recognize a player with his characteristics, a player as fine as Asensio.\n15:50 Comment: But everyone is committed, everyone contributes to the pressure, everyone contributes to the recovery\n15:54 Comment: And that makes Real Madrid a very difficult team for anyone to approach.\n16:4 Comment: What a good ball from Javi Márquez with the outside entering from the left side of Tabanú.\n16:9 Comment: Good defensive action by Dani Carvajal to facilitate Keylor Navas' clearance.\n16:15 Comment: Javi Márquez has just entered in his first intervention, self-pass and opening with the outside\n16:19 Comment: of a footballer who occupies the same area as Uche Aco, but who has very different characteristics and qualities.\n16:27 Comment: Tito's cross, penalty spot, Tabanú touches the header but does not direct the ball towards the goal.\n16:33 Comment: It will be a goal kick for Real Madrid from a Granada team that is stretching in these last few minutes.\n16:38 Comment: Carvajal accompanied him very well, here we are.\n16:42 Comment: To the center, I need to arrive.\n16:45 Comment: Very very lonely for Casemiro, the fifth of Real Madrid.\n16:52 Comment: Ronaldo starts, good ball from Modric.\n16:55 Comment: Ronaldo, Ronaldo, Rubén Bezo jumped on him to make him uncomfortable and he is claiming that Ricardo asks for a penalty.\n17:2 Comment: Yes, yes, Cristiano Ronaldo asks for a penalty, Vikendi Garrido is approaching,\n17:5 Comment: But he ignores the protests of the Portuguese footballer who was pointing at him, indicating that he was going towards the center.\n17:11 Comment: And that the position of the Granada footballer had prevented him from shooting normally.\n17:17 Comment: Yes, but it was body to body, I didn't think so.\n17:20 Comment: Something similar happened in Granada's previous center, where Carvajal accompanied the forward very well.\n17:27 Comment: He touched him lightly with his body and well, it allowed him to resolve a desperate play.\n17:34 Comment: It was already operated on at game time at the Santiago Bernabéu.\n17:37 Comment: Marcelo, James, Benzema, return on James, who is already inside the area.\n17:44 Comment: He could cross first, he ended up thinking a lot, he hesitated whether to control or not.\n17:49 Comment: And it has been done, it has been done.\n17:52 Comment: And the game is over.\n17:54 Comment: The game is over.\n17:55 Comment: James, Benzema, return on James, who is already inside the area.\n18:0 Comment: He could cross first, he ended up thinking a lot, he hesitated between controlling or scoring the serve as the ball came.\n18:6 Comment: And in the end, that moment in which he overthought it was what condemned this approach by Real Madrid to failure.\n18:15 Comment: It is claimed with...\n18:17 Comment: We were seeing again that fall of Cristiano Ronaldo in the duel with Rubén Bezo.\n18:23 Comment: Vicente Garrido seemed to be well placed, and he did not notice anything punishable.\n18:29 Comment: There is obviously an imbalance, but if they barely touch you with your body, it is very difficult for a referee to see a penalty in a play of those characteristics.\n18:39 Comment: Alberto Buenonel Granada is preparing to make the second change for Lucas Alcaraz.\n18:43 Comment: Boga, Casemiro saves her, Lomban surrenders again to Jeremy Boga, raises his head to Andreas Pereira,\n18:49 Comment: The shipment was very good looking for Tabano, but Dani Carvajal was in the right place.\n18:55 Comment: This is the replica of Real Madrid with Marco Asensio, it changes pace, it stands on the front,\n18:59 Comment: Asensio's opening, Benzema's first cross, far post, Marcelo is going to hook it.\n19:4 Comment: Benzema again, covers the Memo Cho in action, invalidated outside the zone.\n19:9 Comment: Benzema again, covers the Memo Cho in action, invalidated by offside by Karim Benzema.\n19:14 Comment: Another good offensive action by Real Madrid.\n19:17 Comment: Real Madrid has something very, very good and that is that when they take the first pass it is always forward.\n19:24 Comment: So that the partridge doesn't get dizzy, that is, it doesn't touch the ball tiresomely in the center of the court,\n19:31 Comment: But he's going to look for the opposite goal.\n19:33 Comment: And then everyone drops the ball at the right time.\n19:36 Comment: It is very rare for players to give three, four touches to the ball.\n19:39 Comment: With one or two touches it makes the game very dynamic.\n19:46 Comment: Here we have the repeated action that shows that yes, Karim Benzema was offside.\n19:53 Comment: And here we take the opportunity to see with the help of those graphics all the movement that has occurred inside the area.\n19:58 Comment: A drag to free the far post where Casemiro entered, thus facilitating Real Madrid's fifth goal.\n20:4 Comment: There has been a change to all this, Ricardo.\n20:6 Comment: Yes, Boga has left, Alberto Bueno has entered, another footballer raised in the Real Madrid youth academy,\n20:11 Comment: He is not having too many minutes this season at Granada despite the poster with which he arrives,\n20:16 Comment: On loan from Porto, a player who had played in the Spanish League before moving to Portuguese football at Rayo Vallecano.\n20:23 Comment: He needs Granada and Alberto Bueno's goals.\n20:26 Comment: Well, you have your chance in these 25 minutes left in the game.\n20:30 Comment: Let's see if Real Madrid makes another change because I've seen Coentrao already put on the shirt.\n20:35 Comment: Since Alberto Bueno's quality is beyond doubt and we all know it,\n20:40 Comment: What is striking is the little influence, the little participation he is having in this start of the season at Granada.\n20:46 Comment: The feeling is that it came at Paco's request.\n20:51 Comment: He is the coach who knew how to get the most juices.\n20:54 Comment: Exactly, yes. This is a player who has goals, who has game, who is intelligent.\n21:0 Comment: He doesn't have a great physical presence, but that doesn't affect his numbers as a scorer.\n21:8 Comment: At Rayo he actually completed magnificent seasons and here, since Lucas arrived, he has had much less participation.\n21:18 Comment: It's Casemiro's first call for Carvajal to come up again.\n21:22 Comment: Asensio, ball for Mallorquin, who stops dead, who faces, who steps into the area.\n21:26 Comment: Marco keeps going, Marco slips, Marco gets up, Marco loses it.\n21:29 Comment: Samper, down with everything, Tabanú wants it.\n21:32 Comment: Very difficult action, Granada keeps it.\n21:34 Comment: Good long ball for Kravets to run in the individual duel with Nacho.\n21:38 Comment: The Ukrainian puts his body in, Nacho holds on, he wants to go around Kravets.\n21:42 Comment: And the ball will go to Granada because there is a foul, Ricardo.\n21:46 Comment: Yes, the foul that the match referee points out in that action that Nacho interrupted.\n21:54 Comment: And he saw how the referee pointed out the infraction, the one who is going to enter the field of play and we see it in close-up.\n22:0 Comment: It's Fabio Coentrao, who I don't count any minutes in the League.\n22:6 Comment: Yes, he has played in the Cup, but I think these will be the Portuguese footballer's first minutes in the League this season with the Real Madrid shirt.\n22:14 Comment: Good's shot on the right side, he manages to clear the defense, but Granada will continue trying.\n22:20 Comment: Center very deviated from Rubén Bezo, the game is stopped.\n22:24 Comment: Possibly now the change will come for a Coentrao to enter who returns today to a call in the League after practically two months of absence.\n22:33 Comment: And look out for Ricardo because there is a tribute, in quotes, to Marcelo.\n22:36 Comment: Yes, the Bernabéu stands up, the entire stadium.\n22:40 Comment: The Brazilian takes off his bracelet to place it on Cristiano Ronaldo's arm.\n22:46 Comment: Look at what the Bernabéu sounds like to say goodbye to Real Madrid's left back.\n22:49 Comment: It's something to stand up for, because this boy has marked the last 10 years of the club at a very high level.\n22:58 Comment: He arrived at Real Madrid when he was 19.\n23:2 Comment: He didn't have many opportunities that season with Capel.\n23:5 Comment: Real Madrid ended up winning the League with that comeback.\n23:8 Comment: There was speculation about a possible departure to Valladolid in the form of a loan.\n23:13 Comment: He didn't want it, Schuster didn't want it the following season as coach.\n23:17 Comment: And from there Marcelo has grown steadily to become one of the best left backs in the world.\n23:23 Comment: And with a tremendous impact on Real Madrid's attacking play.\n23:27 Comment: Player who comes to Real Madrid not as a teenager, but as a post-adolescent.\n23:32 Comment: With just a handful of games in the Brazilian First Division.\n23:35 Comment: With his training club, with Fluminense.\n23:37 Comment: I don't know to what extent you could imagine that Marcelo could trace this progression\n23:45 Comment: until it became a reference player in its area throughout the world.\n23:48 Comment: It's a sign of intelligence, growing a little more each season.\n23:53 Comment: Therefore, all the credit must be given to Marcelo himself.\n23:58 Comment: Logically he will have found the support of coaches who helped him evolve.\n24:3 Comment: But Marcelo brought the essentials. Daring, management, the ability to join the attack at the right moment.\n24:12 Comment: A player of a very high level.\n24:15 Comment: A hand is asked for and Vicente Garrido indicates it.\n24:18 Comment: Cande Garrido, hand of Gabriel Silva.\n24:20 Comment: If he hadn't touched that ball it would have allowed Real Madrid to advance very clearly.\n24:24 Comment: And therefore he sees the yellow cardboard.\n24:27 Comment: If I'm not mistaken, it's the third of the game for Granada.\n24:30 Comment: To cut off that advance that was becoming very dangerous.\n24:34 Comment: He had to put his hand in after that bounce and after trying to put the toe of his boot in and not making it.\n24:39 Comment: Yes, that's it. Open hand.\n24:42 Comment: For a ball that Casemiro had thrown once again.\n24:45 Comment: They play short, they play long, they cut everything that passes through the center of the field.\n24:50 Comment: A game by Casemiro also with a very high score.\n24:58 Comment: The set-piece opportunity is sensational for Real Madrid.\n25:2 Comment: James Rodríguez and Cristiano Ronaldo are running to execute that shot.\n25:9 Comment: Mexican Memo Ochoa locates the barrier.\n25:12 Comment: Looking for the sixth with a set piece for Real Madrid.\n25:16 Comment: Claps on the Bernabéu stands as if it were a triple jump, a long jump.\n25:23 Comment: Seven or ten, James or Ronaldo.\n25:25 Comment: Give the order to the referee, James hits him.\n25:28 Comment: Close, very close to Ochoa's goal.\n25:31 Comment: There was Real Madrid's sixth.\n25:34 Comment: So close that James had run out to shout the goal.\n25:39 Comment: We took the opportunity to see it again from behind.\n25:42 Comment: Yes, yes, it happens awfully close.\n25:45 Comment: That pitch from James Rodríguez was incredibly close to the angle.\n25:48 Comment: Very good, what a good intention because the wait above the Ochoa barrier\n25:52 Comment: When you want to react it's already too late.\n25:55 Comment: If that ball found the angle there was no response from the Granada goalkeeper.\n25:58 Comment: Yellow for Casemiro, for that foul.\n26:1 Comment: The first warning that the Real Madrid players see to cut off that counterattack.\n26:6 Comment: Yellow for the Brazilian footballer.\n26:9 Comment: I insist, the first for Real Madrid, the fifth of the game.\n26:14 Comment: Yes, a shame.\n26:16 Comment: Sorry, the fourth of the game.\n26:18 Comment: A shame because with this result you have to control yourself a little more.\n26:23 Comment: Yellow cards at the end of the season hurt.\n26:28 Comment: David Lombán, bad control of Tabanú.\n26:31 Comment: Carvajal keeps it.\n26:35 Comment: Benzema plays first.\n26:39 Comment: Features James tie.\n26:41 Comment: Carvajal arrives an instant before his marker.\n26:44 Comment: It goes with everything Tabanú.\n26:46 Comment: Very tough entry says Melón Ricardo.\n26:48 Comment: Let's see the color of the card.\n26:49 Comment: With that entry below Tabanú.\n26:51 Comment: Hand in Vicanti Garrido's pocket.\n26:56 Comment:  Yellow.\n26:57 Comment: Despite the fact that red is requested from the stands.\n27:0 Comment: But Tabanú's entry down on Carvajal.\n27:2 Comment: The protest angers the Real Madrid side.\n27:5 Comment: Because of the disproportionate entry of Granada's now extreme side.\n27:10 Comment: And that he has seen the fourth yellow for the Nasrid team.\n27:16 Comment: We are seeing the complete sequence.\n27:18 Comment: Because in the first fight they are also the same protagonists.\n27:21 Comment: They are Tabanú and Carvajal.\n27:22 Comment: There Carvajal arrives first.\n27:23 Comment: The feeling is that the first was to aim and the second to hit.\n27:26 Comment: I mean he had two chances.\n27:29 Comment: In both cases he showed the same aggressiveness.\n27:31 Comment: Carvajal jumped in the first one.\n27:33 Comment: In the second he got paid.\n27:36 Comment: The game became more bitter in the second half.\n27:38 Comment: Because Granada is uncomfortable with the result.\n27:42 Comment: James Center.\n27:43 Comment: Ronaldo arrives and heads in the opposite direction.\n27:45 Comment: What he intended.\n27:46 Comment: Alberto Bueno can't clear.\n27:48 Comment: Real Madrid insists.\n27:49 Comment: Ball for Benzema.\n27:50 Comment: In action invalidated due to offside.\n27:54 Comment: Casemiro was offside, he was hooked.\n27:57 Comment: Now I really pointed it out.\n27:58 Comment: The whistle for Tabanú by the Bernabéu after the previous action with Carvajal.\n28:7 Comment: Casemiro.\n28:8 Comment: Back to Varane.\n28:11 Comment: Tabanú's action seemed disproportionate because of the way he entered.\n28:15 Comment: To a player who had no way out because he had his back to the corner flag.\n28:21 Comment: In a way, due to the context of the game, a play like that was not expected either.\n28:25 Comment: I think it surprised us all even more because of the context of the duel.\n28:30 Comment: Tabanú came on strong and got the yellow card.\n28:32 Comment: Fifth overall in the match.\n28:35 Comment: Fourth for a Granada footballer.\n28:37 Comment: And above all, José, not because of the script of this match, which at 5-0 and at 28 in the second half is more than decided.\n28:44 Comment: But Tabanú must see a red card.\n28:46 Comment: He missed the next game, which is against Osasuna.\n28:48 Comment: Very important for Granada.\n28:50 Comment: Carvajal cuts.\n28:51 Comment: It is left without an angle and allows Samper's defensive action.\n28:55 Comment: Look at the return of Carvajal.\n28:59 Comment: To the ground Tabanú.\n29:0 Comment: There is a lack of Casemiro.\n29:7 Comment: Real Madrid is in a very exciting moment of the season.\n29:12 Comment: Javi Márquez looking for Kravets.\n29:14 Comment: Flag up.\n29:15 Comment: Kravets launch invalidated.\n29:17 Comment: The player on loan from Dynamo kyiv was offside.\n29:25 Comment: We see the shot repeated and yes, Artem Kravets had gone ahead.\n29:30 Comment: So the referee was right in signaling that it was offside.\n29:34 Comment: Albert Bueno.\n29:35 Comment: Playing again for Kravets.\n29:37 Comment: Roba Carvajal.\n29:39 Comment: First class Nacho is wrong.\n29:41 Comment: The second completes the installment on Fabio Coentrão.\n29:45 Comment:  James.\n29:47 Comment: James' deep ball on Ronaldo's career.\n29:49 Comment: Ruben Bezo arrives first.\n29:52 Comment: Bezo for Javi Márquez.\n29:53 Comment: To the ground on the 8th of Granada.\n29:55 Comment: James Rodríguez is missing.\n30:1 Comment: By the way, José, in the game against Sevilla it was Benzema\n30:4 Comment: Of the important players, the one who was left without playing a single minute.\n30:7 Comment: Today Álvaro Morata, who started last Wednesday, does not play a single minute.\n30:13 Comment: Mariano, Danilo and then Kiko Casillas as substitute goalkeeper are not going to participate either.\n30:20 Comment: As for Morata, I don't know if it has a greater or lesser impact on whether he played or not.\n30:26 Comment: But just like Kroos, he has four yellow cards, one away from completing the cycle.\n30:30 Comment: And maybe that could have had some kind of weight in the city's decision.\n30:35 Comment: Benzema for Asensio who starts.\n30:37 Comment: Asensio continues, he gets between two.\n30:38 Comment: Ronaldo is looking for her.\n30:39 Comment: Ochoa arrives first.\n30:41 Comment: Although it seemed that the action was going to be completely invalidated due to Ronaldo's offside.\n30:45 Comment: Be that as it may, the goalkeeper's ball remained in the second half.\n30:48 Comment: Andreas Pereira remains locked in under the pressure of Coentrao and Marco Asensio.\n30:52 Comment: The ball, however, does not come out.\n30:53 Comment: He found the way out.\n30:54 Comment: Andreas Pereira found a way to escape.\n30:57 Comment: Albert Bueno.\n30:58 Comment: A deep ball on Gabriel Silva's career.\n31:2 Comment: The Brazilian who tries to assist Kravets raises his head.\n31:4 Comment: Very passed ball, impossible for the Ukrainian.\n31:7 Comment: Andreas Pereira wants to save him.\n31:10 Comment: Paired with Fabio Coentrao.\n31:12 Comment: Throw-in for Real Madrid.\n31:13 Comment: Go, go, go.\n31:14 Comment: Paired with Fabio Coentrao.\n31:15 Comment: Throw-in for Real Madrid.\n31:18 Comment: Ezequiel Ponce goes.\n31:19 Comment: Another attacker from Lucas Alcaraz for the last moments of the game at the Bernabéu.\n31:27 Comment: Well, so much so that I go.\n31:29 Comment: And the one who leaves the field of play, Tabanú.\n31:32 Comment: The French footballer who is going to take the midday whistle,\n31:36 Comment: We could already say here at the Santiago Bernabéu.\n31:39 Comment: He runs away after entering Carvajal\n31:42 Comment: and that could have been more serious in terms of punishment.\n31:45 Comment: The French footballer is leaving.\n31:47 Comment: One of the new features today in the Nasrid team to replace Medicarcela González.\n31:52 Comment: Ezequiel Ponce, a footballer on loan from Roma, takes his place.\n31:56 Comment:  Argentinean soccer player.\n31:58 Comment: Very young, 19 years old, from Rosario and from the New Soul Boys quarry.\n32:3 Comment: If it's from Rosario it can't be bad.\n32:6 Comment: Gabriel Silva putting in the center.\n32:9 Comment: He managed to cover up Real Madrid's defense.\n32:11 Comment: It goes with everything Modric.\n32:12 Comment: Gabriel Silva again.\n32:14 Comment: Javi Márquez cannot lower it.\n32:17 Comment: It goes with everything Modric, it goes with everything James.\n32:19 Comment: I insist on the collective commitment of the team.\n32:23 Comment: Good timing is all about that,\n32:25 Comment: with a team that feels good physically\n32:27 Comment: and that he is supportive in his response.\n32:30 Comment: And it also has to do with the level of inspiration of the players.\n32:34 Comment: And this is a moment that everyone seems to be going through\n32:39 Comment: A very good stretch of the season.\n32:48 Comment: Samper.\n32:53 Comment: He turns around, delivers to Andrés Pereira.\n32:59 Comment: Continue driving.\n33:1 Comment: The footballer on loan from Manchester United.\n33:4 Comment: Samper again for Alberto Bueno.\n33:10 Comment: Ponce receives between the lines.\n33:13 Comment: He insists and wins.\n33:14 Comment: It was Javi Márquez who was moving around.\n33:16 Comment: Ponce is waiting for her in the left sector.\n33:18 Comment: Clear Real Madrid's defense.\n33:20 Comment: Throw-in for Tito.\n33:25 Comment: In this Real Madrid in which Zidane doses minutes\n33:29 Comment: and it gives this opportunity to Coen.\n33:31 Comment: They are first in the league.\n33:32 Comment: Yes, he had participated in the Cup\n33:34 Comment: and had participated in the Champions League\n33:36 Comment: against Sporting Lisbon.\n33:40 Comment: With that penalty in the last moments\n33:42 Comment: which almost made it difficult for Zinedine Zidane's team\n33:45 Comment: the classification before the last day\n33:48 Comment: against Dortmund here at the Bernabéu.\n33:55 Comment:  Nacho.\n33:56 Comment: Barhain played for Modric.\n33:58 Comment: Once again Barhain timidly puts pressure on Artem Kravets.\n34:4 Comment: Touch and touch Zidane's team.\n34:6 Comment: Ronaldo stops dead\n34:8 Comment: allowing the anticipation of Rubén Bezo.\n34:10 Comment: Ronaldo serves quickly and makes a mistake\n34:12 Comment: But the rebound falls to Ronaldo himself.\n34:14 Comment: There is no understanding with Marco Asensio.\n34:16 Comment: It's done with the loose ball, Samper.\n34:20 Comment: And he wins the second game.\n34:23 Comment: Marco Asensio.\n34:24 Comment: It's done with the loose ball, Samper.\n34:31 Comment: Ronaldo's voracity remains the same as always.\n34:34 Comment: The team winning 5 to 0.\n34:36 Comment: He takes the side as if they were tying\n34:39 Comment: and he will need a goal.\n34:43 Comment: Well, we must remember that Cristiano has scored 12 goals against Granada\n34:46 Comment: But it's not even the team's\n34:49 Comment: who have suffered the Portuguese's goals.\n34:51 Comment: Rayo 12, Levante 14, Malagay Espanyol 15, Atleti 16,\n34:55 Comment: Celta 17, Atlético de Madrid 18, Getafe 20, Sevilla 22.\n34:59 Comment: Well, they are Cristiano Ronaldo's numbers\n35:1 Comment: They have been spectacular since their arrival at Real Madrid.\n35:4 Comment: Andreas Pereira put in a good cross\n35:6 Comment: But he put his fists in, Keylor Navas repelled.\n35:9 Comment: I was trying to replicate Marco Asensio\n35:11 Comment: who gets a throw-in\n35:13 Comment: bouncing that ball\n35:15 Comment: on his partner's leg\n35:17 Comment: In the

Barcelona\n35:26 Comment: in Cup and Champions League matches.\n35:31 Comment: James, Carvajal securing for Rafael Varane.\n35:39 Comment: Casemiro is wrong about recovering Javi Márquez.\n35:42 Comment: Modric keeps the ball, Márquez is missing there.\n35:45 Comment: Granada played a slightly drier game\n35:47 Comment:  In the second half.\n35:49 Comment: That's why more yellow cards, more fouls.\n35:51 Comment: He has been much more aggressive.\n35:53 Comment: Ronaldo inside the area, stops\n35:55 Comment: In Lombard's face, Ronaldo puts it\n35:57 Comment: changing his leg.\n36:1 Comment: I mirror Granada's defense although they make mistakes\n36:3 Comment: immediately after Alberto Bueno\n36:5 Comment: and Real Madrid's charge returns with Benzema.\n36:7 Comment: Benzema inside the area, delivers for James\n36:9 Comment: James puts it, catches in two times\n36:11 Comment: Memo Ochoa, who keeps the ball.\n36:13 Comment: Catch Memo Ochoa in two moments.\n36:22 Comment: Samper.\n36:25 Comment: Waiting for the movement of his companions\n36:27 Comment: find the option on the left\n36:29 Comment: with Gabriel Silva.\n36:32 Comment: Ezequiel Ponce moves ahead of you.\n36:40 Comment: Marquez.\n36:43 Comment:  Delivery\n36:45 Comment: Gabriel for Ponce.\n36:47 Comment: Samper again, he is claiming her\n36:49 Comment: On the right Tito, also Andrés

    "summary": "On a bright Saturday afternoon at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, Real Madrid showcased their offensive prowess with an emphatic 5-0 victory over Granada in their first match of the year. This La Liga fixture was marked by a dominant display from Zinedine Zidane's men, who took control from the first whistle and never looked back.\n\nAs the game kicked off, Real Madrid immediately put Granada under pressure, with Marcelo and Carvajal pushing high up the flanks. The tone of the match was set with Real Madrid's relentless pressing and quick ball movement, spearheaded by the likes of Isco, Kroos, and Modric.\n\nJust 11 minutes into the match, Isco capitalized on a misplaced pass by Granada's Samper, slotting the ball past Memo Ochoa with ease. This early goal was a testament to Real Madrid's aggressive approach, continually forcing Granada into errors with their high pressing game. Zidane's tactical setup saw Isco playing on the left with Ronaldo and Benzema centrally placed as an attacking duo, while Carvajal and Marcelo provided width from the full-back positions.\n\nReal Madrid continued their dominance as Marcelo bombed forward from the left-back position to assist in attack, a hallmark of his decade-long service to the club. This relentless attacking saw Modric's shot saved by Ochoa, only for Benzema to pounce on the rebound and make it 2-0 in the 20th minute. Although there was a hint of an offside, the goal stood, further frustrating Granada who were already struggling to contain the rampant hosts.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo added to Granada's woes with a clinical header in the 27th minute, assisted by a pinpoint cross from Marcelo, who was having a stellar game himself. This goal marked Ronaldo's 12th against Granada in La Liga, showcasing his lethal finishing and aerial prowess. By this time, Real Madrid were in cruise control, with every attack seemingly capable of resulting in a goal.\n\nIsco added a fourth in the 31st minute, capping off another swift move that began with Modric's clever ball recovery and subsequent quick pass. Isco's second goal of the game came from a well-timed run into the box, highlighting his excellent positioning and composure in front of goal.\n\nThe one-sided nature of the game continued into the second half, even as Zidane made changes to manage the squad. James Rodriguez, who returned to favor with a brace against Sevilla midweek, replaced Isco to maintain the attacking threat. This substitution did little to disrupt Real Madrid’s rhythm as they maintained their pressure on Granada's defense, with Benzema narrowly missing a chance early in the second half.\n\nGranada, on the other hand, struggled to establish any foothold in the game. Their best chance came in the 89th minute when Keylor Navas was called into action to make a save, but by then the match was long out of their reach.\n\nReal Madrid's fifth and final goal came courtesy of Casemiro in the 58th minute. James delivered a teasing ball from a set-piece, and Casemiro found himself unmarked at the far post to head home. This goal underlined Real Madrid's variety in attack, capable of scoring from set-pieces just as easily as from open play.\n\nThroughout the game, Real Madrid's midfield trio of Modric, Kroos, and Casemiro controlled proceedings, with their precise passing and intelligent movement allowing the team to dominate possession and territory. Modric and Kroos, in particular, showed why they are considered among the best midfielders in the world with their ability to dictate the tempo and link up play seamlessly between defense and attack.\n\nDefensively, Real Madrid were equally impressive. Varane and Nacho formed a solid partnership at the back, and the energetic full-backs Carvajal and Marcelo ensured that Granada rarely found any space on the flanks. Keylor Navas, while not overly tested, remained alert to pluck any high balls or shots that came his way.\n\nGranada managed only one shot on target, a testament to Real Madrid's defensive solidity and their ability to cut off supply lines to Granada's forwards. The visitors' attempts to counterattack were often thwarted by Real Madrid's effective pressing and quick recovery of possession.\n\nMarcelo's performance was a standout as he celebrated 10 years at Real Madrid with a defensive masterclass coupled with his usual attacking flair. His contribution was crucial in both creating and finishing off moves, partnering effectively with Isco on the left wing and contributing an assist for Ronaldo's header.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo and Benzema continued their prolific form against Granada, with the French striker particularly enjoying a fruitful afternoon. Benzema’s interplay and off-the-ball movement constantly troubled Granada's defense, and his willingness to drop deep and link up play also enabled fluid transitions between attack and midfield.\n\nDespite a few physical duels and tough tackles, particularly from Granada's Tabanú who was shown a yellow card for a harsh challenge on Carvajal, Real Madrid maintained their composure and discipline. They ensured that Granada never had a chance to get back into the game after falling behind early.\n\nAs the final whistle blew, the scoreboard read 5-0 in favor of Real Madrid, a reflection of their dominance from start to finish. This result not only solidified their position at the top of La Liga but also sent a message to their rivals about their attacking potential and defensive solidity. With players like Marcelo, Isco, and Modric in top form, coupled with the goal-scoring exploits of Ronaldo and Benzema, Real Madrid looked well-equipped to maintain their charge for the league title.\n\nOverall, it was a masterclass in attacking football from Real Madrid, blending pace, precision, and power to dismantle a Granada side that simply couldn’t cope with the onslaught. This comprehensive victory not only extended Real Madrid's unbeaten run but also provided a perfect start to their campaign for the new year."
