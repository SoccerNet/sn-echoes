    "summary": "On a sunny evening at the Estadio Nuevo Los Cármenes, football fans gathered to witness a gripping La Liga encounter between Granada CF and Real. The match held significant implications for both sides, with Granada CF eager to fend off relegation peril and Real looking to solidify their chase for the league title. As the referee's whistle echoed through the stadium, signaling the commencement of the first half, the intense match began with Real taking the kick-off.\n\nWithin the first few minutes, Real's intent was clear. Barely two minutes in, Real found the back of the net, setting an assertive tone from the outset. The early goal shocked the Granada CF players and supporters, who scrambled to regroup as they restarted the game at 03:13. Real’s early breakthrough showcased their attacking prowess and clinical finishing.\n\nThe game progressed with a series of throw-ins, starting with Real at 04:42 after the ball went out of play, promptly leading to a series of exchanges where possession fluctuated. Real experienced an offside call at 05:14, which temporarily halted their momentum. Both teams then engaged in a tussle for dominance, with more balls going out of play and requiring clearances to reset the play. Real’s throw-ins at 06:40 and 09:04 maintained their pressure, while Granada CF demonstrated resilience in the defensive clearances at 07:30 and throw-in attempts at 08:27.\n\nThe pivotal moment arrived again for Real at 10:05 when they struck yet another goal, increasing their lead to a seemingly comfortable margin. Granada CF, disheartened but determined, took the kick-off at 10:57, eager to find a foothold in the game. The following minutes saw Granada CF committing a series of fouls, particularly at 12:34 and 13:29, undermining their efforts to regain control.\n\nGranada CF made their first substitution at 17:01, an attempt to inject fresh energy and alter their gameplay mechanics. The continuous fouls committed by Real, such as at 19:24 and 20:02, showed a tactical aspect of breaking Granada’s rhythm. Granada managed a shot off target at 20:52, an indication of their struggle to break Real’s formidable defense. Real’s clearance at 21:06, coupled with fouls and indirect free-kicks, demonstrated their tactical defense and management of Granada’s sporadic attacks.\n\nReal’s dominance shone through again at 29:27 with a third goal, further solidifying their grasp on the match. Following the restart at 30:45, Granada CF faced an uphill battle, continually stifled by Real’s compact and disciplined approach. Real's influence showed through their fouls, indirect free-kicks, and throw-ins, managing to subdue Granada’s aggressive pushes. At 34:25, Real scored their fourth goal, a definitive blow that nearly sealed the fate of Granada CF for the evening.\n\nThe remainder of the first half saw Granada CF struggling to penetrate Real’s defenses. Although they had a few shots off target and throw-ins to restart their attack, Real held firm. Granada displayed some offensive thrust at 41:09 and 41:43 but to no avail, as Real repetitively neutralized these efforts with solid clearances - exhibiting their defensive robustness.\n\nAs the second half commenced, Granada CF made strategic substitutions, hoping to reverse their fortunes. With the kick-off and immediate ball out of play signaling the resumption, the opening minutes featured Granada making attempts to regain control. Throw-ins by both sides peppered the next few minutes, keeping the ball within the middle third of the field but not progressing to threatening positions.\n\nReal’s occasional offside call at 06:09 indicated their habitual forward pressing, while Granada’s multiple clearances at 02:06 and 09:31 emphasized their defensive struggles against the relentless Real attacks. Despite Granada’s corner attempts at 03:44 and subsequent throw-ins and clearances, Real remained imposing.\n\nGranada CF managed a shot on target at 12:21 but it was not enough to shake Real’s sturdy goalkeeping and defensive line. Real, continuing their substitutions at 12:56, maintained fresh legs on the pitch, allowing them to sustain high pressing and defensive solidity. Real’s constant attacking momentum led them to shots on target at 15:44. Yet, Granada CF showcased their fighting spirit, managing a shot on target at 16:13, hinting that they would not relent easily.\n\nThe match persistently reflected Real’s overwhelming superiority with corner kicks and continuous attacking waves. Granada’s chances, although sparse, indicated sporadic opportunities that Real systematically dismantled. Substitutions by Real at 22:57 and further, added depth to their squad ensuring continued pressure throughout the match.\n\nGranada temporarily gained momentum with a series of corners and clearances, only to be subdued by Real's tactical fouls and disciplined defensive actions. Granada CF’s yellow card at 41:49 symbolized their frustration and desperate attempts to regain possession and counter Real’s offensive strategies.\n\nThe match, characterized by Real's dominance and Granada's resilient but futile attempts to recover, ended with a final whistle confirming a comprehensive 0-4 victory for Real. The supportive atmosphere of the Estadio Nuevo Los Cármenes crowded with Granada fans echoed silent disappointments contrasting Real’s jubilant cheers marking a monumental win in their campaign. The victory allowed Real to secure crucial points, amplifying their title chase while leaving Granada CF in dire need to reassess and revitalize their strategies for impending fixtures to navigate away from the relegation zone. Real’s clinical performance, both offensively and defensively, provided a masterclass example of a team in pursuit of championship glory, while Granada CF left with towering challenges to overcome in the remainder of the season."
