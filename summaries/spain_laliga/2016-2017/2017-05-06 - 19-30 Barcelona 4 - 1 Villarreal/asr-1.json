remains that in terms of possession, in terms of platform,\n12:53 Comment: The one who carries all that weight with the majority is Barça.\n12:55 Comment: Yes, I think Escribá already knew it and so did Luis Enrique.\n12:59 Comment: Of course there is no team that has fought against Barcelona for that possession.\n13:4 Comment: It is the team that enjoys or has the most possession of the ball in the league.\n13:10 Comment: But Villarreal can have it, but they are not a team that feels uncomfortable\n13:16 Comment: or suffering when he has to be withdrawn, defending,\n13:19 Comment: At the

it.\n14:3 Comment: There was a foul, he was surrounded by yellow shirts.\n14:6 Comment: The possibility was lost for Villarreal to defend itself.\n14:10 Comment: After that mistake by Lucas Diñe gave the Escribá team a good chance.\n14:15 Comment: Yes, we have seen how he has activated, how the rhythm has changed in those last 30 meters in the finishing zone.\n14:21 Comment: There, it was dangerous to lose a ball because there were already many players around and few FC Barcelona personnel.\n14:29 Comment: That's what Barcelona will have to watch.\n14:32 Comment: When you try to exit in that starting zone,\n14:36 Comment: or in the creation zone, do not take risks depending on whether you pass inside and even less so near their area.\n14:41 Comment: Messi is stepping into the area, he is looking for a way to overwhelm Álvaro who does not allow it.\n14:46 Comment: Punch outside the player, Cantabreu, corner kick the first of the match in favor of FC Barcelona.\n14:52 Comment: And now the one who stands up is Juan Carlos Unzube to act as set piece tactics coach,\n14:58 Comment: As she always does, but it is the first time we see an Englishwoman who puts herself in the center.\n15:3 Comment: When Neymar throws it, Neymar puts it, the ball hits the penalty spot.\n15:8 Comment: He manages to clear Álvaro, the ball is going to fall on the front, the fight to Untiti, Rodri does it too.\n15:12 Comment: She tries to prolong the attack, Jaume Acosta momentarily pushes her away.\n15:16 Comment: Barça insists, Suárez insists.\n15:19 Comment: Suárez's center comes, he puts it at the near post, Acosta cleared.\n15:22 Comment: Dos Santos, who is placed in the center, who is placed at the near post, who is placed at the near post.\n15:27 Comment: Suárez

game.\n15:59 Comment: On this occasion, the title as far as Barça and Real Madrid are concerned.\n16:3 Comment: Maybe rigorous, right? I just saw this card as a promising Villarreal attack.\n16:9 Comment: A ball that was going towards the touchline.\n16:12 Comment: Besides, it was two against one.\n16:14 Comment: Neymar was already very close to be able to challenge Soriano for that ball.\n16:18 Comment: It's not that he left with an advantage over Sergi Roberto alone,\n16:23 Comment: and that he could run 30 meters towards Ter Stegen's goal.\n16:27 Comment: For me, rigorous with the regulations in hand, if you interpret that as a promising attack.\n16:33 Comment: Well, an influential warning for Sergi Roberto, not only in what has to do with this match,\n16:39 Comment: because you have to drag that condition from here to 90,\n16:41 Comment: but also in the face of everything to come, because it will complete its cycle in Las Palmas.\n16:45 Comment: And he will not be able to play the duel at the Gran Canaria stadium on the penultimate matchday of the League.\n16:50 Comment: There is precisely Sergi Roberto leaving André Ter Stegen behind for the brand.\n16:57 Comment: Messi is down in the center of the field.\n16:59 Comment: Messi for Iniesta.

repeated.\n27:1 Comment: We used that line that we can draw with graphics to delimit the area in which it would be enabled and in which it would not.\n27:9 Comment: And that frozen image only confirms

opportunity that was lost for FC Barcelona.\n9:59 Comment: And how Messi reads these types of actions.\n10:4 Comment: When he knows, when one thing is whether he receives between the lines or receives in front of Villarreal's two lines.\n10:11 Comment: But when they are close to their area, very well placed and with good help and good coverage.\n10:17 Comment: Or when he receives in a situation in which Villarreal's defensive disposition is not so evident.\n10:26 Comment: From there, how it accelerates, how it changes the rhythm, how it energizes the attack and the damage it is capable of doing.\n10:31 Comment: There is a foul on Bakambú, who took a good hit.\n10:34 Comment: He was trapped between Umtiti and Lucas Diñe.\n10:38 Comment: And all this warms up at Barcelona Mascherano.\n10:41 Comment: Yes, the little boss who scored his first goal in the FC Barcelona shirt in the game against Osasuna.\n10:46 Comment: He has taken a...\n10:47 Comment: A timid applause from, above all, the fans closest to that band.\n10:50 Comment: Where the Argentine footballer from Barcelona is already warming up.\n10:59 Comment: Rodri.\n11:2 Comment: Try to turn around.\n11:3 Comment: Rodri Hernández continues, who ends up rifling it with that long delivery.\n11:6 Comment: Lucas Diñe lowers it with his head.\n11:9 Comment: Neymar.\n11:11 Comment: He accelerates against Jonathan dos Santos.\n11:12 Comment: Neymar continues driving.\n11:13 Comment: The ball stuck to the foot.\n11:14 Comment: He steps on it, stops.\n11:17 Comment: Face.\n11:18 Comment: Break.\n11:18 Comment: Neymar continues, who wants more.\n11:19 Comment: Bottom line.\n11:20 Comment: Neymar passes it from behind.\n11:22 Comment: Neymar puts it on the front.\n11:23 Comment: Messi lowers it from his chest.\n11:25 Comment: Messi for Andrés Iniesta.\n11:28 Comment: Busquets.\n11:31 Comment: Messi again.\n11:32 Comment: Messi stops.\n11:33 Comment: Connect again with Iniesta.\n11:35 Comment: Hitting zone.\n11:36 Comment: Throw the Cuchara pass.\n11:38 Comment: To Andrés Iniesta.\n11:39 Comment: Villarreal clears.\n11:40 Comment: The action came to nothing.\n11:41 Comment: But Neymar's demonstration of power on the left wing was tremendous.\n11:46 Comment: Not all?\n11:46 Comment: Well, strength, skill, endurance.\n11:49 Comment: Because it was 50 meters.\n11:52 Comment: And in the end, when he reaches the baseline, he has made a cut.\n11:55 Comment: And then he had the chance to pass.\n11:57 Comment: Neymar and Messi.\n11:57 Comment: Messi hits him.\n11:59 Comment: Palme, corner.\n12:0 Comment: Andrés Fernandez.\n12:2 Comment: Another for Barcelona.\n12:3 Comment: Society again.\n12:5 Comment: Messi, Neymar.\n12:6 Comment: And one more time.\n12:7 Comment: Messi, a bit like before, right?\n12:8 Comment: How is he able to detect when he can do damage if he speeds up the game, right?\n12:14 Comment: A new demonstration.\n12:15 Comment: From that reading of the game situation.\n12:19 Comment: Iniesta puts in the center.\n12:20 Comment: Good drop by Suárez.\n12:22 Comment: But the ball seems to have gone out.\n12:24 Comment: Either that, or it was offside, Ricardo.\n12:27 Comment: Well, the flag above the linesman.\n12:32 Comment: Let's see.\n12:33 Comment: Let's see if the repetitions help us clear up doubts.\n12:36 Comment: Well, it seems like they called him offside.\n12:38 Comment: Yes, Suárez was offside, right?\n12:39 Comment: And the action was fair, to say the least.\n12:41 Comment: Paired there.\n12:42 Comment: Because the ball had not gone out.\n12:44 Comment: It was what had to be done.\n12:45 Comment: And what had to be ratified.\n12:46 Comment: But offside, because Luis Suárez could be offside due to a shoulder.\n12:50 Comment: Soldier.\n12:51 Comment: Try to replicate Villarreal.\n12:52 Comment: Cuts back Soldier, who stops.\n12:54 Comment: Soldado continues, who finds support from Rodri.\n12:57 Comment: Rodri, hitting zone.\n12:58 Comment: He cheers up.\n12:58 Comment: There goes Rodri.\n12:59 Comment: Shot very wide.\n13:0 Comment: Well above Ter Stegen's goal.\n13:3 Comment: In a play in which Villarreal had deployed five or six men in attack.\n13:7 Comment: Yes, it stretches.\n13:8 Comment: And it is a team that has several playing records.\n13:12 Comment: Maybe your first idea is to play.\n13:15 Comment: And then, as he says, it is a team that has to attack positionally.\n13:17 Comment: And from there, draw counterattacks.\n13:19 Comment: But it is a team that if it has to attack positionally, it also knows how to do it.\n13:23 Comment: It is a record that Escribá has mostly wanted to incorporate.\n13:29 Comment: Messi, again for Neymar, who is already stepping into the area.\n13:31 Comment: He wants to look for gaps.\n13:33 Comment: Neymar continues.\n13:34 Comment: Neymar behind.\n13:35 Comment: Rodri has cut.\n13:36 Comment: He is entering with an ease that scares Neymar from the left wing.\n13:39 Comment: Is not very good.\n13:40 Comment: It's very nice.\n13:41 Comment: And when he detects that it is one against one, he always tries.\n13:44 Comment: We have even seen that it is one against one.\n13:45 Comment: We have seen it before.\n13:46 Comment: A two against one.\n13:47 Comment: Bakambú and Jonathan dos Santos.\n13:48 Comment: He has been able to overcome both of them.\n13:50 Comment: So from less to more.\n13:52 Comment: He was good in the first half, but in this second half he is coming into play more.\n13:57 Comment: Even all his actions carry danger.\n14:8 Comment: Jonathan dos Santos.\n14:10 Comment: Bakambú asks for it.\n14:11 Comment: It is all changed by Jonathan dos Santos, who cannot hand it over to Roberto Soriano.\n14:14 Comment: Villarreal insists.\n14:15 Comment: There's Trigueros.\n14:16 Comment: Wildflowers on the front.\n14:17 Comment: Follow Trigueros.\n14:18 Comment: Samuel Untiti takes the lead.\n14:19 Comment: Barcelona keeps the ball.\n14:20 Comment: After that attempt, after that Villarreal attempt, in which Trigueros found himself,\n14:29 Comment: Ricardo, favored by an involuntary collision between Sergio Busquets and the referee.\n14:32 Comment: Yeah.\n14:33 Comment: And then another crash.\n14:34 Comment: The Soldier with Digne.\n14:35 Comment: Soldier has remained looking at the line judge, as if asking him to point out the foul or\n14:41 Comment: that he had seen her.\n14:42 Comment: But the player did not consider it that way.\n14:43 Comment: The referee did not consider it that way nor did Sánchez Martínez.\n14:45 Comment: So the play was a clash.\n14:48 Comment: In this case not only with Busquets, but also with Soldado and Digne.\n14:53 Comment: Neymar.\n14:54 Comment: He was looking for the pass into space over Suárez's unmarking.\n14:57 Comment: Neymar Junior again.\n15:5 Comment: Rakitic.\n15:7 Comment: Sergi Roberto receives.\n15:13 Comment: Rakitic plays.\n15:14 Comment: Back for Sergio Busquets.\n15:16 Comment: Again the Croatian who relies on Samuel Umtiti.\n15:19 Comment: We have already entered the last half hour of the game.\n15:24 Comment: Neymar.\n15:27 Comment: Messi.\n15:29 Comment: Messi advances to the left.\n15:34 Comment: Ball for Iniesta.\n15:35 Comment: Cuchara's Iniesta.\n15:36 Comment: Put Mario's head in.\n15:37 Comment: Ball up from Trigueros.\n15:39 Comment: Roberto Soldado and Gerard Piqué fight it.\n15:41 Comment: The Barça centre-back prevails.\n15:42 Comment: Umtiti pressured by Bakambu.\n15:44 Comment: Problems for Piqué who has to play back towards Marc-André Ter Stegen.\n15:48 Comment: Yes, they are a constant nuisance.\n15:50 Comment: Both Bakambu and Soldado do not let the center backs think.\n15:53 Comment: Here we see that Piqué cannot relax, not even Umtiti.\n15:56 Comment: An error would clearly punish FC Barcelona.\n16:1 Comment: But we see that Villarreal is comfortable when it is completely hidden near its area.\n16:7 Comment: When he stretches and does not finish the play, he becomes unprotected and vulnerable.\n16:11 Comment: And from there have come Barcelona's best dangerous actions.\n16:16 Comment: Now, when he is crouched and sheltered in front of Andrés, it is difficult to find ways to give him chances.\n16:24 Comment: Messi.\n16:34 Comment: In short, Diñe for Andrés Iniesta.\n16:36 Comment: Neymar first trying to get the action going.\n16:39 Comment: He couldn't give him the ball.\n16:41 Comment: Suárez, although the ball does not last long, against Villarreal.\n16:44 Comment: Yes, they are no longer looking for defenders, they are not looking for a midfield player.\n16:49 Comment: They're already looking for two more lines, right?\n16:52 Comment: Another line superior to the one in the center of the field.\n16:55 Comment: They look for the forwards.\n16:56 Comment: And from there they are two players who hold the ball with their backs very well.\n16:59 Comment: The thing is that I think this ball was from Musaquio, I don't know if it was from Musaquio or Álvaro.\n17:3 Comment: He was in the lead, he even passed Soldier's head and he couldn't do anything.\n17:11 Comment: And the ball is like at the time in the center of the back.\n17:14 Comment: Rakitic was imprecise, after a drop shot by Suárez that was not the best possible either.\n17:17 Comment: The Barça midfielder was in great demand for that ball.\n17:20 Comment: The one that demands for Villarreal.\n17:22 Comment: By the way we had not commented, I think we have not commented, 90 thousand viewers finally.\n17:26 Comment: The attendance went to the Camp Nou after, we had commented, 80 thousand, more than 80 thousand.\n17:32 Comment: There has been a final push there to reach 90 thousand.\n17:35 Comment: Very good entry today for this Barça-Villarreal.\n17:38 Comment: We had repeated that song, right?\n17:39 Comment: Yes Yes Yes.\n17:40 Comment: We saw Soldier's fall repeated in the collision with Diñe that you mentioned before.\n17:44 Comment: Ricardo charges Villarreal again, imprecise here.\n17:48 Comment: In that attempted combination, Mario Gaspar with Roberto Soriano lets a titi come out.\n17:56 Comment: Goal kick for Marc André Ter Stegen.\n18:0 Comment: The Enriques applaud, very close to the Asturian coach Fran Escrivá.\n18:5 Comment: In what is surely one of the first occasions in Ricardo's game so far.\n18:8 Comment: In which both coincide outside the technical area.\n18:11 Comment: Except for those 20-25 minutes, it is true that it has stopped a couple of times.\n18:15 Comment: But Luis Enrique has already been on his feet practically the entire game.\n18:18 Comment: Beware of the foul and the yellow card for Andrés Iniesta.\n18:25 Comment: The novelty today, the lack after that theft or that loss.\n18:29 Comment: Which has caused the dangerous foul of a footballer who was not noticed.\n18:34 Comment: We must remember that at Barça Jordi Alba and Samuel Umtiti remain at 4-0.\n18:38 Comment: Sergi Roberto has already seen the fifth.\n18:40 Comment: In the case of Villarreal, Jonathan Dos Santos, Víctor Ruiz and Bakambú are the ones who are warned of sanctions.\n18:45 Comment: Yes, the lack is clear.\n18:47 Comment: It is a very delicate move on the part of Sergi Roberto.\n18:50 Comment: Because it's going inside, it's driving, it's going at a lot of speed.\n18:53 Comment: He can't very well decide who to pass the ball to.\n18:57 Comment: He rushes, loses that ball, gives it badly to Iniesta.\n19:0 Comment: And in that loss of the ball I think Iniesta did well.\n19:2 Comment: Because there were several players who were near the front of the area.\n19:6 Comment: And they could have shot, created a situation.\n19:8 Comment: The position is excellent for hitting.\n19:11 Comment: Good from Trigueros, good from Jonathan Dos Santos.\n19:13 Comment: There, Villarreal is surely missing Bruno Soriano.\n19:17 Comment: The referee authorizes it, the Mexican seems to be going to hit him.\n19:20 Comment: Or Costa, no.\n19:21 Comment: There goes Jonathan Dos Santos.\n19:23 Comment: Up, up Jonathan Dos Santos' shot.\n19:27 Comment: He missed the opportunity in that direct free kick against Villarreal.\n19:32 Comment: It is clear that now he has advanced the lines somewhat.\n19:35 Comment: When he tries to put the ball into play.\n19:38 Comment: Ter Stegen, there is forward pressure.\n19:40 Comment: And we see that the ball goes to the side and is already tilting.\n19:43 Comment: Try to recover it closer to Ter Stegen.\n19:46 Comment: And if not force him to divide the ball.\n19:49 Comment: Or steal Sergi Roberto like before.\n19:52 Comment: Who has not found a free man.\n19:54 Comment: He wanted to finish in an individual action and lost the ball.\n19:58 Comment: Intense pressure from Villarreal.\n20:0 Comment: Even so, Barça persevered in this idea of ​​going out combining.\n20:3 Comment: And he finds the exit on the left wing with Digne.\n20:5 Comment: André Gómez warms up in football.\n20:8 Comment: And the goal of the Barcelona club.\n20:10 Comment: Neymar.\n20:11 Comment: Excellent cut to escape from Mario.\n20:13 Comment: He wants to rescue him again.\n20:14 Comment: It puts her on Digne's career.\n20:16 Comment: The pass was not entirely accurate.\n20:18 Comment: It wasn't all good.\n20:19 Comment: But even so, the Camp Nou stands applaud a new technical detail from Neymar.\n20:25 Comment: And there are a few details.\n20:27 Comment: A few maneuvers of these characteristics in today's game.\n20:38 Comment: Soldier and Piqué fighting for a ball again.\n20:41 Comment: Soldier commits a foul.\n20:43 Comment: Ball for Barça.\n20:45 Comment: Sánchez Martínez indicated his hand in that duel between Piqué and Soldado.\n20:56 Comment: And it is Piqué himself who starts driving on the right.\n20:59 Comment: Rakitic.\n21:0 Comment: Digne's poor control.\n21:5 Comment: Take the opportunity to get the ball.\n21:6 Comment: Jonathan Dos Santos.\n21:7 Comment: Combine Bakambú first.\n21:8 Comment: Jonathan again.\n21:9 Comment: Two

academy.\n26:26 Comment: He had commented this week that he had not won at the Camp Nou.\n26:30 Comment: That it was a good time to do it.\n26:31 Comment: But at the moment 3 to 1 on the scoreboard.\n26:34 Comment: Enter Sansone for Soldier.\n26:36 Comment: He leaves the field of play.\n26:38 Comment: Roberto Soriano.\n26:39 Comment: The Italian enters.\n26:40 Comment: Samu

road.\n27:59 Comment: Montiti follows Sansone in that attacking action.\n28:3 Comment: Step on Bacambú now.\n28:4 Comment: Bacambú continues.\n28:4 Comment: Bacambú hits him.\n28:5 Comment: I took it out of the corner.\n28:6 Comment: Cedric Bacambú did it all.\n28:9 Comment: Since he caught the ball about 60 meters from the Barcelona goal.\n28:13 Comment: He is in great shape.\n28:15 Comment: Here we see how he recovers the ball near the center of the field.\n28:19 Comment: And there is a very good unchecking by Sansone.\n28:21 Comment: That in the end he doesn't interpret it.\n28:23 Comment: Follow and when it arrives in the area.\n28:25 Comment: I thought he would shoot.\n28:27 Comment: But it makes a bicycle.\n28:28 Comment: And then.\n28:29 Comment: It's true.\n28:29 Comment: That the shot was deflected by the Barcelona player.\n28:32 Comment: But good action.\n28:34 Comment: Jonathan dos Santos.\n28:35 Comment: He puts it inside the Triguero area.\n28:36 Comment: The first stick is sent.\n28:37 Comment: Ball rejected by Samu Castillejo.\n28:40 Comment: Castillejo chased by Neymar.\n28:42 Comment: Neymar puts his body in.\n28:43 Comment: Which ends up recovering.\n28:44 Comment: He hides her.\n28:47 Comment: Stop heeling for Diñe.\n28:48 Comment: Diñe does not follow that ball.\n28:50 Comment: The last one to play was the Frenchman from Barça.\n28:52 Comment: The throw-in for Villarreal.\n28:55 Comment: Jordi Alba is still waiting for all this.\n28:57 Comment: A little more and you will have to reheat.\n28:59 Comment: And Mascherano.\n29:0 Comment: Yes because in this stand the sun has not been shining for a long time.\n29:3 Comment: The wind is blowing and it's a little cool now.\n29:7 Comment: New interruption.\n29:8 Comment: But the change does not take place.\n29:10 Comment: No.\n29:10 Comment: And Mascherano is on the bench too.\n29:13 Comment: Stripped of the breastplate.\n29:14 Comment: From the tracksuit.\n29:16 Comment: Also waiting for the modification.\n29:17 Comment: I don't know if he's going to do them at the same time.\n29:19 Comment: Or he is going to make two stops in Luis Enrique's game.\n29:22 Comment: Trigueros.\n29:22 Comment: It could be encouraged by the beating.\n29:24 Comment: Prefer to open to the left.\n29:25 Comment: There is no understanding with Jaume Costa.\n29:26 Comment: And now the change is going to come.\n29:27 Comment: Richard.\n29:27 Comment: Now yes.\n29:28 Comment: Luis Enrique.\n29:29 Comment: He gestures to the fourth referee to now allow the modification.\n29:33 Comment: Carlos Naval there with the bracelet as a delegate.\n29:36 Comment: Waiting to see the numbers on the board.\n29:39 Comment: Sánchez Martínez giving permission for the change.\n29:42 Comment: The one who leaves the field of play is Lucas Diñe.\n29:46 Comment: The surprise today.\n29:48 Comment: Because we were waiting for Jordi Alba.\n29:51 Comment: And in this moment.\n29:53 Comment: Not by hand.\n29:54 Comment: But yes on the field of play.\n29:56 Comment: There is the gala eleven.\n29:58 Comment: Something that hasn't happened.\n29:59 Comment: In all the.\n29:59 Comment: Season.\n30:0 Comment: In a starting eleven.\n30:2 Comment: Now with the entry of Jordi Alba into the field of play.\n30:6 Comment: This is Luis Enrique's gala team.\n30:8 Comment: The FC Barcelona gala team.\n30:10 Comment: Yeah.\n30:10 Comment: What a surprise.\n30:11 Comment: That this gala eleven has not lined up in the entire league.\n30:17 Comment: Surprising when you hear this information.\n30:20 Comment: And in the case of Diñe.\n30:21 Comment: For me a complete match.\n30:23 Comment: Because not only in defense.\n30:24 Comment: Which is what he has to do as a left back.\n30:25 Comment: But in attack he has given depth.\n30:27 Comment: Messi starts.\n30:28 Comment: Neymar is asking for it.\n30:29 Comment: Neymar wants.\n30:29 Comment: Another Neymar.\n30:30 Comment: Neymar.\n30:32 Comment: Andrés Fernández catches.\n30:33 Comment: He wanted to bite her.\n30:34 Comment: And the goalkeeper was not defeated.\n30:36 Comment: He stayed standing.\n30:37 Comment: And Neymar meekly caught that shot.\n30:40 Comment: There was the Barça room.\n30:41 Comment: I don't know what he wanted to do.\n30:44 Comment: From our position.\n30:45 Comment: Being left-handed.\n30:46 Comment: I thought that many forwards do it.\n30:51 Comment: Shooting under the goalkeeper's legs.\n30:53 Comment: They are usually open there.\n30:55 Comment: Trying to occupy as much space as possible.\n30:57 Comment: But he has chosen to want to snack.\n30:59 Comment: Something very difficult.\n31:1 Comment: And it was in no time.\n31:3 Comment: The goalkeeper has dropped.\n31:4 Comment: It has been defeated.\n31:5 Comment: And he stopped the ball very well.\n31:7 Comment: The trident charges again.\n31:8 Comment: Directed by Luis Suárez.\n31:10 Comment: Ball for Messi.\n31:11 Comment: Messi on the front.\n31:11 Comment: Messi to the ground.\n31:12 Comment: There is no lack of Jaume Acosta.\n31:16 Comment: He touched the ball clearly.\n31:20 Comment: Samu Castillejo.\n31:24 Comment: Trigueros.\n31:25 Comment: Jonathan Dos Santos turns around.\n31:27 Comment: Bakambú unchecks.\n31:27 Comment: The ball is excellent.\n31:28 Comment: Bakambu.\n31:29 Comment: Put your toe in.\n31:30 Comment: Piqué appears.\n31:32 Comment: About to invoke Nicolás Sansone.\n31:34 Comment: Bakambú insists.\n31:35 Comment: Who looks for space to hit.\n31:36 Comment: He wants to combine with Samu.\n31:37 Comment: A titi is given to Jordi Alba.\n31:39 Comment: The danger for Barcelona has passed.\n31:41 Comment: Very clear action for Villarreal's 3-2.\n31:45 Comment: There is a foul on Neymar.\n31:47 Comment: Yellow card for Rodri.\n31:49 Comment: Not for Busaquio.\n31:51 Comment: Correct.\n31:51 Comment: For Busaquio he was out of position.\n31:55 Comment: He went into that action with Neymar with everything.\n31:58 Comment: And the...\n31:59 Comment: A foul costs Villarreal's Argentine centre-back the yellow card.\n32:4 Comment: At the moment the change occurs, Sergi Roberto is going to leave.\n32:8 Comment: More Cherano is going to enter.\n32:9 Comment: Barça's gala eleven did not last long on the pitch.\n32:13 Comment: Even if it was circumstantially.\n32:16 Comment: Because the news is that Luis Enrique has not used it in any game so far in the league.\n32:20 Comment: We are on day 36.\n32:21 Comment: The applause for Sergi Roberto.\n32:24 Comment: .\n32:58 Comment: in a gala eleven, but the League has not started yet.\n33:2 Comment: Sergi Roberto left, Javier Mascherano entered, who is already asking for it, advancing on the right.\n33:7 Comment: There goes Messi in speed, Messi continues, opening for who, for Neymar.\n33:12 Comment: Neymar was offside, but he still went for the ball, aware that the flag was going to go up.\n33:19 Comment: Possession for Villarreal, we see Mascherano positioned as a right-back,\n33:23 Comment: Let's not lose sight of the fact that Sergi Roberto's yellow card in today's match leaves him out of the clash against Granada.\n33:30 Comment: Do you think that this option, this solution, that of Mascherano on the right will be the one that...\n33:35 Comment: Granada, Las Palmas, in the Las Palmas Peace match, on matchday 37.\n33:38 Comment: Do you think that this Mascherano option on the right will be the one that Luis Enrique ultimately likes the most for that match?\n33:43 Comment: Well, even for the Cup final, right?\n33:46 Comment: He can't lose sight of her either, because I think Sergi Roberto can't play her either.\n33:50 Comment: So, well, you have to...\n33:52 Comment: Now that there is no match during the week, there is no wear and tear due to another competition,\n33:58 Comment: Well, Luis Enrique doesn't have that much need to rotate,\n34:4 Comment: but to think about the commitments that lie ahead,\n34:8 Comment: and above all also in that Copa del Rey final, you already know which players you can count on and which ones you can't,\n34:14 Comment: unless there are more injuries, but it is one of the more possibilities to play with three,\n34:20 Comment: which has also done so in many games.\n34:22 Comment: Suárez does not play in that game either.\n34:25 Comment: Besides.\n34:26 Comment: André Gómez is going to enter the field of play.\n34:29 Comment: Well, then I'll say something about Elis Vidal.\n34:30 Comment: Neymar is very inspired today, but a lot.\n34:33 Comment: Iniesta.\n34:38 Comment: Leave Iniesta for Luis Suárez.\n34:44 Comment: Mascherano.\n34:47 Comment: It is offered short to Messi, he receives and turns around on the 10th.\n34:51 Comment: Iniesta.\n34:52 Comment: He steps on it so that...\n34:52 Comment: That Messi is still driving.\n34:54 Comment: More from Messi.\n34:55 Comment: 1-2 for Neymar to arrive.\n34:57 Comment: Neymar saves her on the same line.\n34:58 Comment: He's out of the area.\n34:59 Comment: Marvelous.\n35:0 Comment: Neymar continues to put it behind.\n35:2 Comment: Suárez wants to finish.\n35:3 Comment: Jaume Acosta has covered.\n35:5 Comment: Luis Suárez insists.\n35:6 Comment: Penalty is requested.\n35:6 Comment: Yes, there is.\n35:7 Comment: Ricardo, there is a penalty for Barcelona.\n35:9 Comment: Why what Neymar just did is outrageous.\n35:12 Comment: On the sidelines...\n35:13 Comment: Well, it's yellow for Jaume Acosta.\n35:14 Comment: Aside from Neymar's play, Jaume Acosta tells him that he hit him in the chest, but Sánchez Martínez pointed out a penalty at the request of his assistant.\n35:22 Comment: It took a while, I say this because he looked at the touchline a little and it was the linesman who gave him the penalty.\n35:29 Comment: Another thing is whether he is right or wrong, which we will see in the replay.\n35:31 Comment: He hasn't hesitated once.\n35:33 Comment: Informs the assistant of the maximum penalty.\n35:36 Comment: Let's see...\n35:39 Comment: What do you think, Miquel?\n35:41 Comment: It just doesn't look good.\n35:42 Comment: It doesn't look good if you first touch him on the chest and then on the arm.\n35:45 Comment: It touches him on the arm, but what is not seen in any of the shots is if it first touches him on the chest, which means...\n35:50 Comment: Sánchez Martínez has his back turned.\n35:52 Comment: Yeah.\n35:52 Comment: I mean, you see Jaume Acosta's back, huh.\n35:54 Comment: Clear.\n35:55 Comment: The thing is that, let's see, it hits him on the arm, but what is not seen is if it first hits him on the chest, which would no longer be a penalty.\n36:2 Comment: But come on, Neymar's play, impressive.\n36:5 Comment: He's going for Barcelona's fourth.\n36:7 Comment: 11 meters from the goal, Leo Messi.\n36:11 Comment: Hand in hand between Messi and Andrés.\n36:12 Comment: Authorize the referee, he's going to hit the 10.\n36:14 Comment: There goes Messi!\n36:16 Comment: Nooooooooooo!\n36:22 Comment: Barça goal in '81!\n36:28 Comment: Another from Leo Messi.\n36:30 Comment: Tempered, calm, calm release.\n36:33 Comment: Panenka chopped and in the center almost touching the crossbar.\n36:37 Comment: Andrés side was defeated.\n36:39 Comment: It is Barcelona's ruling.\n36:41 Comment: Messi repeats.\n36:42 Comment: FC Barcelona 4 Villarreal 1.\n36:45 Comment: Well, and Messi who did not want to be less compared to Neymar because of the action that preceded that...\n36:52 Comment: ...penalty, right?\n36:53 Comment: That bite he does to the Villarreal player.\n36:56 Comment: And here he also appears in Panenka style.\n36:59 Comment: Assuming that he is going to throw himself to the ground as if it had been Andrés'.\n37:3 Comment: Well, I think that's already 107 goals, right?\n37:6 Comment: This season in the League.\n37:10 Comment: From Barça, yes.\n37:11 Comment: From Barça.\n37:11 Comment: It is at 115 as Barcelona's record for Tito Villanova's season.\n37:17 Comment: It's there at 7 goals.\n37:19 Comment: The applause goes to Rakitic.\n37:21 Comment: And now let's go for...\n37:22 Comment: ...the one in which the Croatian footballer retires.\n37:25 Comment: The love of Camp Nou.\n37:26 Comment: Andrés Gómez is going to enter the field of play.\n37:29 Comment: Change also at Villarreal.\n37:30 Comment: The one who leaves is Bakambú.\n37:32 Comment: What he has done, well, one of the most dangerous actions besides the goal against Villarreal.\n37:40 Comment: The one who enters the field of play is Adrián López.\n37:45 Comment: Messi's celebration.\n37:46 Comment: It is Messi's 51st goal this season.\n37:49 Comment: 35th in the League.\n37:51 Comment: He's on his way to the golden boot.\n37:54 Comment: And it is the Tridente's 101st goal this season.\n37:57 Comment: And Barça's 107 this year.\n38:1 Comment: Castillejo tried.\n38:3 Comment: The ball is about to reach Samson.\n38:5 Comment: He continues looking for the Italian who was offside.\n38:8 Comment: Ball for Barcelona.\n38:10 Comment: We are talking about Messi's scoring records.\n38:12 Comment: From the Argentine's final definition in that penalty shot.\n38:17 Comment: How difficult it was for us at times.\n38:20 Comment: See if that...\n38:21 Comment: That set in which the hand is indicated.\n38:24 Comment: In which the penalty is awarded.\n38:26 Comment: There is a touch before on the chest.\n38:27 Comment: As Jaume Acosta seemed to allege in the complaint with the referee.\n38:32 Comment: But among all that we have been left a little behind.\n38:35 Comment: In that print queue.\n38:37 Comment: What Neymar has done in the back line.\n38:41 Comment: Neymar is in a tremendously sweet moment.\n38:44 Comment: We said it before.\n38:45 Comment: He has already left 5, 6, 7, 8 spectacular details.\n38:48 Comment: This one surely combines spectacularity with effectiveness.\n38:51 Comment: It was one of the best parts of the game.\n38:53 Comment: Yes, the truth is that he has gone from less to more in the game.\n38:56 Comment: He's doing a fantastic second part.\n38:59 Comment: Well, he is the player who dribbles the most in the league by far.\n39:3 Comment: And in every game when he is in shape.\n39:6 Comment: He doesn't stop trying and inventing things.\n39:9 Comment: Actions.\n39:10 Comment: Well, it can only occur to him or Messi.\n39:13 Comment: But it's just at the moment the ball stops.\n39:15 Comment: I think he already sees that the rival is coming with speed.\n39:18 Comment: And he has imagined what he is going to do.\n39:20 Comment: And then, of course.\n39:21 Comment: Execution is missing.\n39:22 Comment: Not just think about it and decide it, but do it.\n39:25 Comment: Which also turns out well.\n39:28 Comment: Neymar is precisely there.\n39:30 Comment: Pressing the Villarreal defender.\n39:33 Comment: He ends up committing a foul.\n39:36 Comment: Well, there has been this second part, I think, in the statistics.\n39:39 Comment: Perhaps Barcelona's position has dropped.\n39:41 Comment: He has also had it a little more than the first half of Villarreal.\n39:44 Comment: But I also think that there have been more chances for Barcelona.\n39:50 Comment: Especially Barcelona.\n39:51 Comment: And also from Villarreal.\n39:52 Comment: Because?\n39:53 Comment: Well, because Villarreal has decided at some point to advance its lines.\n39:58 Comment: Also separate your lines and unprotect yourself.\n40:1 Comment: Or leave more space.\n40:4 Comment: Large spaces where Barcelona have felt very comfortable when attacking.\n40:8 Comment: Thanks to this trident of so much talent.\n40:15 Comment: We are already in the last five minutes of regulation time of the game.\n40:21 Comment: And the last, the last, the last.\n40:23 Comment: André Gomez.\n40:24 Comment: He just came in replacing Rakitic at Villarreal.\n40:27 Comment: By the way, Adrián López came in to replace Bakambú.\n40:31 Comment: That in practically all his appearances he has carried a lot of danger.\n40:34 Comment: Yeah.\n40:35 Comment: If you have to highlight someone from Villarreal, there is certainly Bakambú.\n40:38 Comment: It has been the best of the team.\n40:40 Comment: Not only because of the goal, but because in all his actions he has created danger.\n40:44 Comment: And it has been a continuous nuisance for the centre-backs, Untiti and Piqué.\n40:47 Comment: Neymar's Chilean.\n40:49 Comment: After that Luis Urbano center.\n40:50 Comment: And Neymar's goal.\n40:51 Comment: Luis Suarez.\n40:52 Comment: It was almost impossible to direct the goal.\n40:53 Comment: Barcelona insists.\n40:55 Comment: Suárez insists.\n40:56 Comment: That already steps into the area.\n40:57 Comment: Suárez puts it.\n40:58 Comment: Messi is waiting for her.\n40:59 Comment: Mario nods.\n41:0 Comment: Iniesta up front.\n41:1 Comment: Iniesta hits him.\n41:2 Comment: Catch Andrés.\n41:3 Comment: Well, with the previous argument I wanted to say that Villarreal has been a team that has\n41:7 Comment: controlled the situation

    "summary": "In a highly anticipated La Liga fixture, FC Barcelona faced Villarreal at the formidable Camp Nou, securing a critical 4-1 victory in a match infused with precision, intensity, and crucial tactical implementations. The game began under the supervision of the Murcian referee who was noted for promptly initiating Barcelona's control over proceedings. Lining up in a 4-3-3 formation, the Catalan giants commenced with Sergi Roberto positioned as a winger, while Lionel Messi found his space on the right, volleyballing between the interior and the flank.\n\nFrom the outset, Barcelona's approach was clear as they began with horizontal passes in their defense, particularly Digne, before aiming to coordinate with Neymar. Early exchanges saw Villarreal attempting long throws through Mario Gaspar, targeting Bakambu, who couldn't capitalize, thus handing the ball back to Barcelona. Piqué and Suárez formed a dynamic pairing, with Suárez persistently contesting aerial duels, frequently coming up against Álvaro González.\n\nBarça's fluidity in movement became noticeable as Piqué switched wings with an expansive ball intended for Neymar, who relentlessly pressed yet struggled to shepherd the ball to safety. The visitors' defensive tactics were based on containment and pressing, displaying a well-drilled blockade that aimed to alternately quash Barcelona's positional play and strike on the counter.\n\nAs the first half unfolded, Neymar began exhibiting his trademark flair, leaving Jonathan dos Santos and Mario Gaspar trailing. However, numerous attempts at cooperation either ended with misplaced passes or were swallowed by Villarreal’s vigilant defense. Periods of possession witnessed Barcelona patiently building their attacks, orchestrated by Busquets, who slotted between the center-halves, granting both fullbacks the freedom to advance.\n\nNeymar's attempt to side-step Mario Gaspar to find Messi didn’t materialize, reflective of the defensive vigilance from Villarreal. Yet, the relentless Barcelona pushed through pressing the guests into extended defensive phases, with quick recovery and counter-press setups particularly through the trio of Messi, Neymar, and Suárez.\n\nOn the pitch, both Neymar and Messi began synchronizing runs, probing Villarreal's defenses with snake-like maneuvers. FC Barcelona's strategy was meticulous, rotating the ball from flank to flank, stretching Villarreal's defensive lines. Messi's impact grew, evidenced when he broke down Villarreal's structure with intelligent touches and smart passes. Neymar, drawing defenders in, looked to sneak between the lines, although frequently met by an impenetrable yellow wall.\n\nBarcelona's persistence bore fruit in the 20th minute, when Suárez, navigating the right flank, found space and drove forward. His overlapping run concluded with a chested attempt by Messi, whose touch, deflected slightly, became a perfect assist for Neymar. Showing formidable presence of mind, Neymar nudged the ball past Andrés Fernández to break the deadlock. This goal encapsulated the essence of Barcelona's attacking philosophy—quick interplay and acute positioning.\n\nHowever, Villarreal's response was solid. They swiftly adjusted, closing down spaces while making the most of the counter when Barcelona exhibited increased aggression. Piques positioning and attempts to create an offside trap backfired when Villarreal's quick transition culminated in a pass from Roberto Soldado that saw Cedric Bakambu sprint behind the defensive line, outpacing Piqué to slot the ball under Ter Stegen, leveling the score emphatically.\n\nThe match ebbed and flowed, with Villarreal threatening through well-timed runs and dangerous set-pieces, while Barcelona remained calculated. Tactical nuances saw Villarreal committing more bodies forward whenever robust clearances from their rear found Bakambu and Soldado. The pace of Bakambu, in particular, continued to pose significant problems for the hosts.\n\nAs the first half drew to a close, Barcelona's calculated build-ups overwhelmed Villarreal’s composure. Messi, fusing skill with persistence, drove diagonally from midfield, eventually splitting defenders and catching Andrés Fernández wrong-footed with a deflected shot. The goal, arriving just at the cusp of half-time, highlighted Barcelona's superior anticipation and execution.\n\nThe second half commenced with similar vigor. Neymar, depicted Messi, sought to dismantle Villarreal's structure early on, pressing high. Despite numerous attempts to snatch the equalizer, Villarreal’s final ball often came up short. Iniesta, Neymar, and Messi continued orchestrating the game's rhythm, focusing on exploiting spaces created by quick movements and strategic positioning.\n\nNeymar proved a constant thorn, tormenting defenders with deft dribbles and ambitious forward runs. This tested Villarreal’s resilience, who often scrambled to maintain their defensive formation. As the game progressed, Barcelona's midfield control, guided by Busquets and Iniesta, additionally created ample second-strike opportunities, pinning the opposition deeper.\n\nMidway through the second half, Sergi Roberto's swift play capitalized on a dead-ball scenario catching Villarreal off-guard. A rapid combination play between Rakitic and Roberto found Suárez, who skillfully maneuvered past defenders and unleashed Barcelona's third goal in the 68th minute—a testament to quick thinking and clinical finishing.\n\nThe introduction of Sansone and Castillejo aimed at rejuvenating Villarreal’s attack, yet further exposed spaces which Barcelona exploited. Subsequent opportunities saw Neymar frequently converging on Villarreal's goal with nimble footwork. He produced a series of astonishing dribbles, one resulting in a contentious penalty awarded for Jaume Costa's handball. Messi, with characteristic composure, converted coolly with a Panenka, solidifying Barcelona's dominance.\n\nDespite attempts by Villarreal to reduce the deficit, including several penetrative runs by Bakambu and incisive efforts from Castillejo, Barcelona remained impenetrable. Deft defending by Umtiti, and later substitutes such as Jordi Alba and Mascherano, fortified the backline, quashing Villarreal’s late endeavors.\n\nEventually, a resounding win was secured, underscored by the exceptional interplay and unyielding work rate of the front trio—Messi, Neymar, and Suárez. As the whistle blew, the Camp Nou erupted, celebrating an emphatic display that kept Barcelona firmly in title contention. The communion between tactical adherence and raw talent was reaffirmed in this comprehensive win over Villarreal."
