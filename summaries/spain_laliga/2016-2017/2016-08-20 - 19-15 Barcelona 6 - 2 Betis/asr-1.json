Inside Luis Suárez. He throws the ball away. He burns at the penalty spot.\n9:29 Comment: Rakitic reworks. Now for Sergi Roberto who could put the center in.\n9:33 Comment: He leans on the front for Messi. He also puts Messi looking for Alba.\n9:36 Comment: Alba puts it with his head for Luis Suárez who does not invoke.\n9:39 Comment: Real Betis has to throw her out like someone putting out a fire.\n9:43 Comment: It's a corner for FC Barcelona who, in that action, again between Messi and Alba, almost scored the second goal.\n9:50 Comment: There's something else we're looking at. We've been there for less than 10 minutes. Every time Barcelona attacks, Betis leaves two players ahead.\n9:58 Comment: Centrally, the other corner one more to the left.\n10:3 Comment: There aren't many times you see opposing teams here leaving two ahead.\n10:11 Comment: Yes, because you are risking that if the ball is stolen, it can go on the counterattack.\n10:14 Comment: And there is compensation in the case of Barça to Busquets if compensation arrives.\n10:19 Comment: Or you bet that if Barça comes to you with equality or superiority, then they can, as we have seen, Jordi Alba plays it again.\n10:26 Comment: It can create an opportunity for danger. It is very rare for Luis Suárez to miss those in the area.\n10:32 Comment: He took the corner without consequences. Messi cleared the Betis defense and FC Barcelona started again through Busquets.\n10:40 Comment: Busquets' ball behind the defense. He put Cejudo's head in. Ball back for Adam.\n10:47 Comment: The transfer was from Bruno González. Ball over the green and white goalkeeper.\n10:53 Comment: Moments of overwhelming pressure for Betis that in the first 2-3 minutes almost monopolized possession of the ball.\n10:58 Comment: He was able to make a good play on the left sector with the incorporation of Durmisi.\n11:2 Comment: But from then on he has been almost tyrannized by a Barcelona that does not let go.\n11:5 Comment: In fact, when Betis recovers it, it lasts very little.\n11:9 Comment: No, no, it's something that... for me, for Barcelona to score so early is...\n11:15 Comment: They need to have confidence, but it gives something more than later...\n11:20 Comment: Delivery of Suárez's cue to Messi. Messi puts it looking for Luis.\n11:25 Comment: The Betis defender put his toe in and that allowed Antonio Adán to catch it.\n11:30 Comment: He is calling for fouls after one day he has not given the advantage law.\n11:35 Comment: But he's calling fouls after the play was gone.\n11:38 Comment: I believe that one day she should not consider that she is a new play.\n11:41 Comment: Yes, because transfer was impossible, it was an involuntary clearance that Adam caught with his hands.\n11:45 Comment: But if that foul was called, so did Luis Enrique on the edge of the technical area.\n11:52 Comment: Banda face curls Durmisi.\n11:54 Comment: Durmisi.\n11:57 Comment: Felipe Gutiérrez delivers to Durmisi from the ground to Rakitic, moving the ball away.\n12:2 Comment: Goal kick for Adam.\n12:5 Comment: I had promised you that I would ask you and I do it quickly because I'm sure you'll love them,\n12:8 Comment: especially Betis, they are eager to know how Durmisi is doing.\n12:12 Comment: Very quickly, Durmisi plays for Brombie, one of the two big teams in Denmark.\n12:17 Comment: He selected the starter in the team, a player named Bueyles,\n12:20 Comment: who plays for Ajax, who played for Ajax.\n12:23 Comment: There was this possibility, he came in, played three good games with the national team and now he is here with Betis.\n12:29 Comment: He is a player who surely has potential, I think.\n12:35 Comment: Obviously the difference between the Danish league and the Spanish league is very big,\n12:40 Comment: But I think it has potential.\n12:43 Comment: Barely 20 minutes of absolute international final for Durmisi.\n12:46 Comment: Durmisi has his family origins in Albania, but he is an international for Denmark.\n12:56 Comment: Leo Messi watching Adan, inviting him to play long, this is what the Betis goalkeeper does.\n13:1 Comment: Put your head in a marmoset.\n13:3 Comment: Jordi Alba tries to lower it, it seemed like Cejudo, whoever keeps it, Barça keeps it.\n13:8 Comment: Jordi Alba keeps it and delivers it for Denis Suárez.\n13:10 Comment: Busquets threatening to move long, plays short for Rakitic.\n13:16 Comment: On the right free from surveillance Sergi Roberto.\n13:19 Comment: Rakitic again, Pipe Gutiérrez covers him.\n13:22 Comment: Busquets, Messi, Denis.\n13:27 Comment: Arda offers himself between the lines, Denis insists on Busquets.\n13:31 Comment: Again the ball to the right side.\n13:34 Comment: Sergi Roberto appears in the extreme zone, the goal of the line.\n13:37 Comment: Sergi Roberto appears in the winger's zone, the center ends up clearing him.\n13:43 Comment: Pechela, starting over for Barça.\n13:45 Comment: Messi with the outside, Pechela successful in anticipation, tries to set it up against Rubén Castro.\n13:52 Comment: Toni Sarabia was holding on to his back.\n13:55 Comment: The Paraguayan footballer ended up losing the ball, Barcelona plays again.\n14:0 Comment: That is one of the characteristics of a titi, a player who anticipates well, who goes well up front with the forward.\n14:5 Comment: He has a lot of continuity, the only thing sometimes is that due to his physical forcefulness he causes us more fouls than should be the case in football like Spanish.\n14:15 Comment: The same as Dortmund if he has to get used to football here, well a titi too.\n14:20 Comment: Because football, the players, the referees, well each country has its rhythms.\n14:26 Comment: But a titi can be said to be aggressive, that it defends well.\n14:30 Comment: So what you have to do is a defender.\n14:33 Comment: Then he knows how to play, handle the ball very well, scores goals, so it's a plus.\n14:42 Comment: But defense has to know how to defend above all.\n14:45 Comment: Because Michael knows that when you go to receive the midfield there and you feel the center back behind, it is more uncomfortable.\n14:52 Comment: Although there are some who also played well.\n14:54 Comment: There was a touch and then they came back, faked it and left.\n14:57 Comment: I remember some who did it quite well.\n15:0 Comment: But you have that too, so we are already talking about those who are at the top.\n15:6 Comment: This is a back-and-forth and then let's see if some aspects with the ball can be improved a little.\n15:12 Comment: But as a defense it has the basis.\n15:15 Comment: Of course, if he weren't here.\n15:17 Comment: And also because of his age, because he has the capacity to grow.\n15:21 Comment: Sure.\n15:23 Comment: Messi in the center for Rakitic.\n15:25 Comment: Messi again.\n15:27 Comment: Only Sanabria and Rubén Castro are along the imaginary line that the ball would draw in the location where it is located.\n15:36 Comment: Gustavo Poyet's team tries to cover all the passing lines.\n15:40 Comment: He elaborates calmly, with the calm that Luis Enrique's team also gives him that advantage in the score.\n15:47 Comment: Rakitic changes everything.\n15:49 Comment: Jordi Alba receives. He tries to overwhelm Cejudo.\n15:51 Comment: Leave behind for Denis. At the front is Luis Suárez.\n15:53 Comment: Denis puts it to the other side.\n15:56 Comment: Sergio Roberto's header came from Rakitic who was looking for Messi.\n15:59 Comment: Betis can recover. Rubén Castro does it, trying to project Jonas Martín into attack.\n16:3 Comment: But it comes first in the correction, in the help of Jordi Alba.\n16:7 Comment: To deliver to a titi and so that the ball does not change ownership.\n16:11 Comment: Barça plays.\n16:13 Comment: That is one of the characteristics that Jordi Alba has and that is less valued.\n16:15 Comment: We see a lot of him in his ability to get up.\n16:17 Comment: But he is a player who corrects well and is quick to sometimes recover in positions\n16:23 Comment: to close behind the center backs and correct some of those positions.\n16:27 Comment: Maybe his offensive power is so great that sometimes we only see him in that line.\n16:32 Comment: Yes, in this case I wanted a meter from him.\n16:36 Comment: That is.\n16:38 Comment: It is one thing to try to recover for your failure, but it is another thing for a failure.\n16:42 Comment: Compensate your partner.\n16:44 Comment: To the companion.\n16:46 Comment: Rakitic.

At the moment Poyet wants his team to come from behind.\n17:4 Comment: By the way, I'm watching Mauricio Tarico, who is the assistant coach of Betis.\n17:7 Comment: I think he is off the bench and the Uruguayan coach has spoken with him to try to correct some details of this Betis.\n17:14 Comment: I think he's been locked up for about a quarter of an hour and we're at 17 in the game.\n17:18 Comment: Yes, with the goal he conceded, psychologically you go back.\n17:24 Comment: You wait for the game to cool down a little, calm down and well, there are still many minutes to play on this field.\n17:31 Comment: Opening by Felipe Gutiérrez for Durmisi.\n17:34 Comment: Durmisi holds on in the presence of Rakitic.\n17:38 Comment: Pipe Gutiérrez again. He should touch Stonislavio first, who takes the foul.\n17:42 Comment: From Busquets.\n17:45 Comment: It seemed pique, right?\n17:48 Comment: No, no, no, it's Busquets. The foul belongs to Busquets, who was now speaking with Dino Mayenko.\n17:53 Comment: It is the one that the referee Navarro whistled in that attempt by the Barça midfielder to go under pressure.\n18:0 Comment: After playing a great game in the Sevilla Supercompact.\n18:4 Comment: And there they were in the first tier, on the first line, right behind me, a man like André Gómez, one of Barça's greatest stars.\n18:12 Comment: In transfers he cannot play due to sanction. There is also Matié, another of the injured in the FC Barcelona squad.\n18:19 Comment: The foul on Jonas Martand, on one of this year's new signings.\n18:23 Comment: The former Montpellier player, who had his back turned, who received that infraction.\n18:28 Comment: And that gives Betis the possibility of taking a little breath and looking for Bravo's goal.\n18:32 Comment: Durmisi cross, rejection from the front. For whom? For Cejudo. Oh, up!\n18:36 Comment: The first shot, Betis' first attempt. We point it out to Álvaro Cejudo from Córdoba.\n18:42 Comment: You followed the coach's instructions, right, Miquel? Finish the play. If we get there to finish, we play again.\n18:48 Comment: Is not true. It is not like this.\n18:51 Comment: Good pressure and recovery from Betis. Rubén Castro tries to shape himself, delivers to the front, is calling for a foul and indicates a target.\n18:58 Comment: He indicates a target. This, Ricardo, can be an excellent possibility to find a tie for the green and white team.\n19:4 Comment: Around the area Denis Suárez tried to recover. That ball was very high one target, despite the protests.\n19:9 Comment: On the Barça side to point out that foul that could be the most dangerous opportunity for Betis at the start of the match.\n19:17 Comment: There is the fall, the infraction committed by Denis Suárez on Felipe Gutiérrez, who could be, without going any further, one of the candidates to hit that ball, to execute that direct free kick.\n19:30 Comment: At the moment Rubén Castro has it in his hands. It's the phrase that came right after. With the permission of Rubén Castro, who is the one who throws them and usually puts them in as well.\n19:38 Comment: Tony Sanabria also hits it very well from there.\n19:42 Comment: He has a choice, he has a good roster of footballers. Executing a set piece, Gustavo Pollet.\n19:49 Comment: Although the care with which Rubén Castro is locating the ball dispels some doubts.\n19:57 Comment: Although well, the conclave continues with all the footballers who apply. Pipe Gutiérrez is leaving.\n20:1 Comment: Jonas Martán is also taking the measure of the matter. So between those two names will be the executor.\n20:9 Comment: Martán or Rubén Castro, whatever it may be, Betis looks for a dead ball in the tie and the foul is extremely dangerous. Castro hits him.\n20:16 Comment: Mundiano Vallenco authorizes, starts on the 24th, Rubén hits him.\n20:21 Comment: Goal.\n20:25 Comment: From Betis in the 20th of the match. Shark goal. Goal by Rubén Castro.\n20:31 Comment: With that powerful, tight execution, looking for the stick.\n20:35 Comment: That initially the goalkeeper is assigned the stick in which he was located closest to himself.\n20:41 Comment: Claudio Bravo, that's where the ball was very, very powerful. Touch the method, it is assigned to the goalkeeper.\n20:46 Comment: But it doesn't deflect enough. Ball in, Betis ties.\n20:51 Comment: Football Club Barcelona 1, Real Betis 1.\n20:55 Comment: Then ask the doorman here next door.\n20:59 Comment: Goal to the goalkeeper's post. Is it always the goalkeeper's fault or not?\n21:5 Comment: Michael, you know that goalkeepers always defend each other.\n21:9 Comment: No, that's the goalkeeper's stick. Indeed, the goalkeeper is the one who defends himself.\n21:13 Comment: No, that's the goalkeeper's stick. Indeed, it is true that the ball has violence, it has a good touch.\n21:20 Comment: But the height of the ball is not a height either... it does not fit into the square.\n21:25 Comment: Yes, that is one of those balls that the goalkeepers, when we take them to our house, think that it should have been ours.\n21:32 Comment: Rubén Castro's shot was full of intention. Powerful.\n21:36 Comment: Surely hoping that Bravo might try to sense a throw to the other side and catch it on the wrong foot.\n21:41 Comment: That movement in which the goalkeeper moves forward looking...\n21:44 Comment: I had also played on the barrier, because you are forced to go further outside and then you sometimes hesitate between one place and another.\n21:50 Comment: Claudio Bravo had not intervened either in the 20 minutes, which means it is the first ball you are going to touch.\n21:55 Comment: Sometimes all these situations occur in the game and Barça is once again forced to speed up the game again.\n22:3 Comment: Well, it's Betis' first goal this season. Last year Rubén Castro scored 19, 2'32\" ago.\n22:8 Comment: It is the Betic striker's 162nd goal in the League.\n22:13 Comment: A great goal because, despite Claudio Bravo's responsibility or not, he put it very close to the squad to tie the score at one.\n22:22 Comment: Betis just tied, Rubén Castro did. He tries to react immediately to Barcelona.\n22:28 Comment: That they can try it with this corner kick that they just forced with a new incursion on the left side.\n22:33 Comment: The Real Betis defender went to cover, Bruno went to cover, ball for a corner.\n22:44 Comment: Ready to launch Rakitic. One, two, three, four Barça shirts looking for the finish.\n22:49 Comment: Busquets wants it, Suárez wants it, Piqué wants it, Umtiti wants it, it's Busquets, Suárez's second post.\n22:53 Comment: Antonio Adan puts his fist in.\n22:55 Comment: Betis tries to come out in an orderly manner, the counterattack can be good.\n22:59 Comment: Rubén Castro played first. This is Sanabria who endures, who waits for his partner's movement.\n23:5 Comment: Ball behind Umtiti's back, the Frenchman cannot be surprised. Castro was right behind him.\n23:11 Comment: The option was a good one for Gustavo Poyet's team, although he ended up deactivating the new FC Barcelona centre-back.\n23:18 Comment: The start against the attack was very good.\n23:19 Comment: And Salvador Umtiti, to cut off that ball that was looking for the Canario again.\n23:25 Comment: By the way, Unzué took advantage of going out to the technical area in that last action of Barcelona's strategy to give a message to Claudio Bravo.\n23:34 Comment: I couldn't understand him, so I don't know where the note could have gone, but I do know that from the bench the conversation between Unzué, goalkeeper, and Claudio Bravo.\n23:44 Comment: All the goalkeeper of FC Barcelona.\n23:49 Comment: Pick up that ball by the line, Arda.\n23:52 Comment: Burning facing, tries to overflow, good cut, arrives to cover Tejudo, Bruno was also there, Salva plays first.\n23:59 Comment: This is Denis Suárez leaning on Sergio Busquets.\n24:4 Comment: Messi, Messi feints, changes the rhythm at the front of the area looking for a pass with a pipe included.\n24:9 Comment: Elegant in the recovery is the green and white box that appears again on the left.\n24:13 Comment: He holds on and turns around to Sanabria, projecting his partner in that race.\n24:18 Comment: Pipe Gutiérrez tries to reach finishing position.\n24:22 Comment: He held on, Jonas Martán, there's the opening to the right, Tejudo.\n24:28 Comment: Tejudo continues looking for Martán again.\n24:32 Comment: Imprecise Arda Turán, ball again for Barça.\n24:36 Comment: No, two counterattacks have already gone well for Betis, always on this side.\n24:41 Comment: It is also having a hard time for Piqué to dominate Toni Sanabria, who is a player who has a good physique and holds the ball well.\n24:48 Comment: This last play held up, it has provided continuity on the wing, that is where Betis can have a good start.\n24:54 Comment: Petzela, long ball looking for Sanabria

From one of Luis Enrique's right-wing eyes, who has said it on more than one occasion,\n31:34 Comment: a Sergi Roberto who can play in up to seven positions and today, if Barça has a problem with the center backs,\n31:40 Comment: Hopefully not, he could even end up playing as a center back.\n31:43 Comment: He or Rajic is what the Asturian coach pointed out yesterday, because he did not have more centre-backs in the first team than those who are playing as starters.\n31:51 Comment: Suárez tries to turn around Luisito, manages to stop Elbetis' defense.\n31:56 Comment: Applied in that line of three, Bruno, Mandy and Petzela.\n32:0 Comment: Little or little we have seen Luis, more than some unchecking inside, that play that we have seen that has fallen.\n32:7 Comment: And it hasn't happened, what happens is that the scorers are going to appear, when they appear they make themselves felt.\n32:12 Comment: Alba can cheer up, raise her head, she wanted to combine with Luis Suárez.\n32:16 Comment: He manages to clear some marked first Petros.\n32:19 Comment: Hold on, as Toni Sanabria can, keep going, there is a foul, yes.\n32:22 Comment: There is a lack of Gerard Piqué,

Mallenco,\n32:32 Comment: against a Toni Sanabria who is beginning to receive from his back.\n32:36 Comment: And from there, Elbetis tries to mount the counterattack.\n32:40 Comment: He did it after the goal, especially with more ease with the real team.\n32:45 Comment: Yes, because when Piqué comes out to cover, if Toni manages to hold that ball and be able to face it,\n32:52 Comment: There is a lot of field to be able to play forward.\n32:55 Comment: What happened, Ricardo!\n32:56 Comment: Be careful, Jonas Martand has been injured.\n32:59 Comment: Tenrillo remains on the playing field, the action continues for Barça.\n33:2 Comment: With Luis Suárez, who puts her up front for Messi.\n33:4 Comment: Messi was first looking for Denis, trying to restart the fire.\n33:7 Comment: Jonas Martand is still on the ground.\n33:9 Comment: I don't know if his colleagues have noticed it.\n33:11 Comment: Yes Yes.\n33:12 Comment: They are trying to throw the ball away.\n33:14 Comment: What I don't understand is why Elbetis hasn't done it when it could.\n33:16 Comment: But Elbetis' number 8 is lying on the pitch and it could be an injury.\n33:20 Comment: Who is responsible for making that decision as long as there is no natural interruption in the match?\n33:25 Comment: It is Undiano Mallenco, who for now lets continue.\n33:28 Comment: Jonas Martand actually gets up, but he is clearly limping.\n33:31 Comment: Let's see what happened.\n33:32 Comment: Two players now on the ground.\n33:33 Comment: Explain to me, Ricardo.\n33:34 Comment: Well, I need to point out Undiano Mallenco in favor of Elbetis.\n33:37 Comment: Two men lying on the playing field.\n33:39 Comment: One from each team.\n33:40 Comment: The public gets angry because they understand that the foul should have gone the other way.\n33:44 Comment: Now Undiano Mallenco comes to take an interest in Jonas Martand.\n33:48 Comment: Let's see if the Elbetis midfielder can or cannot continue.\n33:52 Comment: Because what is certain is that the action has not been able to continue for approximately 30 seconds.\n33:58 Comment: We have two fronts.\n33:59 Comment: On the one hand, the one that opened first, that of Jonas Martand, which is being attended to.\n34:4 Comment: And on the other hand, that of Elbetis, which is being attended to by the center.\n34:8 Comment: And on the other hand, that clash between Jordi Alba and Petros.\n34:12 Comment: Petros has remained on the ground.\n34:13 Comment: Now he is recovering.\n34:14 Comment: But there were some Elbetis players, and I have seen above all Rubén Castro,\n34:17 Comment: that they were demanding from Undiano.\n34:19 Comment: Be careful, there was an elbow there.\n34:20 Comment: It seems that this is what is going to reproach Petros, Jordi Alba.\n34:22 Comment: Rakitic is in there.\n34:24 Comment: You're making a mess in a certain way, Ricardo.\n34:26 Comment: Yes Yes Yes.\n34:27 Comment: It's left until after the game.\n34:29 Comment: Felipe is also there.\n34:30 Comment: Tempers have heated up with that last action between Petros and Jordi Alba,\n34:34 Comment: which has ended with the two players on the field.\n34:37 Comment: The recrimination for that arm raised by both teams.\n34:42 Comment: Let's see how all this ends, because I haven't seen Undiano\n34:45 Comment: put your hand in your pocket.\n34:47 Comment: Look how Petros was reproaching Alba there.\n34:50 Comment: The fact that he understood that she had intentionally hit him with her elbow.\n34:54 Comment: I don't know how you have seen both Andoni and Jorge.\n34:57 Comment: I think what Jordi told him was that he went to compete for the ball and nothing more.\n35:2 Comment: What is true is that...\n35:4 Comment: Yes, but for me the second play was a consequence of this.\n35:9 Comment: But of course, they had a chance to get the ball.\n35:12 Comment: We are always returning to the same thing.\n35:14 Comment: Whether you have to take the ball or not.\n35:16 Comment: But there is the referee.\n35:17 Comment: The referee to power.\n35:18 Comment: If you see that a player is on the ground, to be able to whistle.\n35:20 Comment: Despite all this, Jonas Martín has not been able to continue.\n35:23 Comment: No no.\n35:24 Comment: Plus, it was done quickly.\n35:27 Comment: The doctors have seen the Betis footballer.\n35:29 Comment: He has asked for the change.\n35:30 Comment: Dani Ceballos is already on the pitch.\n35:32 Comment: First forced substitution in the green and white set.\n35:35 Comment: Well, it was Martán, who did not have a very inspired debut due to that hasty end in the form of an injury.\n35:43 Comment: Dani Ceballos takes his place.\n35:45 Comment: Great hope and figure, current Betis player.\n35:48 Comment: They do so much and look, in the first game of the season, he started as a substitute.\n35:53 Comment: A talented player.\n35:54 Comment: A player who has that balance, who has a pass.\n35:58 Comment: He has that spark of those players from the Andalusian school.\n36:4 Comment: What happens is that today, today too, Poyet has a more armed team, more hard-working, with more effort.\n36:11 Comment: Now, with Ceballos on the field, things happen, for sure.\n36:15 Comment: Because he is a player who has the talent to be able to do it.\n36:19 Comment: We are now facing the final stretch of the first part.\n36:21 Comment: Barcelona and Betis continue to tie.\n36:24 Comment: Samuel Umtiti plays.\n36:28 Comment: Barça has to see the game.\n36:30 Comment: Because in the discussion, in the debate, in all those stops, Barça has never, historically never, done well.\n36:37 Comment: And to this team, less so.\n36:39 Comment: Sergi Roberto up front for Messi, who is shaping up to be Messi.\n36:43 Comment: Because I want it.\n36:45 Comment: Goal!\n36:56 Comment: From Barça in 37.\n36:59 Comment: Goal from Leo Messi, which he received, which raised his head, although I don't know why, because he already knew where everyone was.\n37:5 Comment: He went straight, looked for space.\n37:7 Comment: And with the determination of someone who knows that he is capable of doing what is in his head, what is in his mind,\n37:13 Comment: He hit him powerfully down low, beating Dan, to put Barcelona ahead again.\n37:18 Comment: Barça goal. Goal by Leo Messi.\n37:20 Comment: FC Barcelona 2-1 Betis.\n37:24 Comment: How many times have we seen that?\n37:26 Comment: Yes, we have seen it a thousand times, but it seems so simple.\n37:30 Comment: Sometimes, as a goalkeeper, I usually ask friends,\n37:34 Comment: They say, man, but if Messi always does that, why does the goalkeeper, if he already knows he's going to shoot there?\n37:40 Comment: He doesn't put himself in that position anymore, right?\n37:41 Comment: Well, because when you see the ball, and because also, that's what you do.\n37:46 Comment: He has five players ahead of him.\n37:47 Comment: In front, and you can't see, but also, if you anticipate and want to go there, or you put it in the other suit,\n37:53 Comment: or that movement, that's what raising your head is for, gives the pass to the one who arrives from the second line and ends up snatching you.\n38:0 Comment: With which, and then the speed with which the ball hit... this new ball in this league.\n38:6 Comment: Perhaps the difference with that action that we all identify, associate with Messi,\n38:11 Comment: of tracing that more or less long diagonal, and hitting it with that camber and such.\n38:14 Comment: Perhaps the difference we can notice in the goal he just scored is that he hit it even harder,\n38:20 Comment: that there really is violence in that shot.\n38:22 Comment: But it came out very quickly, very quickly.\n38:25 Comment: Well, Leo Messi's first goal this season with the FC Barcelona shirt in the league.\n38:30 Comment: 26 last year, starts off on the wrong foot.\n38:34 Comment: Understood as the FC Barcelona left-hander has scored again with that leg, with that boot,\n38:39 Comment: putting the ball out of Adan's reach. 38, Barça wins again 2-1.\n38:44 Comment: Leo Messi was also talking with Diano Mallenco.\n38:48 Comment: Yes, it is convenient for Barça to remain in the game until the end of the first half, not...\n38:54 Comment: After the first goal we saw it, right?\n38:56 Comment: The intensity has dropped a little, since the opponents also have their chance to be dangerous.\n39:2 Comment: Foul, foul on Rubén Castro.\n39:5 Comment: Betis is doing that well, interrupting the game and looking for their opportunities,\n39:8 Comment: that one of them could be in the dead ball, which has already reached the tie.\n39:11 Comment: Taking into account that you have Sanabria, Petzl, Mandí, Bruno on the field,\n39:16 Comment: Only the aerial battery, so that we understand the Polledes team, is excellent.\n39:21 Comment: If you add to that good pitchers like Felipe Gutiérrez or Ceballos...\n39:25 Comment: The game stops, then...\n39:28 Comment: The Chilean Gutiérrez puts it there, at the far post, he tries to hunt down Betis, no.\n39:32 Comment: It is lost in the background, it will be a goal kick.\n39:35 Comment: That is precisely what Sergio Busquets was complaining about a moment ago, that the game was interrupted so much.\n39:40 Comment: Well, now Barça quickly launches into the counterattack.\n39:43 Comment: Looking for the third, putting together that quick play, although Luis Suárez has to stop,\n39:47 Comment: and that allows Betis to recover positions in attack.\n39:49 Comment: Ball for Messi, Sergio Roberto has arrived, inside the area, Roberto puts it...\n39:52 Comment: Oh! Antonio Adán's pat down was excellent, to avoid what could have been\n39:57 Comment: what smelled like FC Barcelona's third goal.\n40:0 Comment: Very quick departure from Luis Enrique's team, who continues to insist that he will try again through Messi.\n40:6 Comment: Starting from the goalkeeper's kick, Claudio was very quick there, recovering the ball from a ball boy,\n40:12 Comment: and the pass was perfect for Suárez.\n40:15 Comment: Suárez looks for a space, he puts his toe into Durmisi, he cannot control the recently entered Danice Ballos.\n40:22 Comment: So let's play, let's play,

advantage.\n42:16 Comment: Barça goal, Suárez goal.\n42:18 Comment: FC Barcelona 3-1 Real Betis.\n42:21 Comment: What Andoni said before about Luis Suárez, that we saw a little of him in the first part,\n42:30 Comment: the fall inside the area, look, that's what these runners have at this level,\n42:36 Comment: No?\n42:37 Comment: One or two balls and that's enough.\n42:40 Comment: A difficult rebuttal.\n42:42 Comment: Very complicated hit.\n42:43 Comment: Yes, I was going to say before that Sergio Roberto, who last year already participated as a full-back,\n42:49 Comment: but he is a new side, so to speak, because he also has to take the lead.\n42:54 Comment: timing that of arriving and putting it, sometimes waiting for the people who are dragging and putting them behind\n42:58 Comment: and sometimes that's not it, from up here it's easier than it usually is in the countryside.\n43:3 Comment: There, however, he found the pass well, Suárez's movement was good, but\n43:9 Comment: The space there was to finish was a span, well a span the ball went to the\n43:14 Comment: stick, he made a gesture to Adam as if to say impossible.\n43:18 Comment: Well, Suárez marks, last year's top scorer also debuts this season, when\n43:23 Comment: It appears, it really appears and it doesn't need many opportunities that number 9\n43:28 Comment: of FC Barcelona to score the

Comment: 3-1, two left or one left... 16 right now.\n43:47 Comment: The top three scored for Barcelona, ​​first Arda did it, then Messi, recently\n43:52 Comment: Luis Suárez did it.\n43:54 Comment: In between, Rubén Castro had scored for the momentary tie for Gustavo's team\n43:58 Comment: Pollet.\n44:0 Comment: Dani Ceballos serves a long ball looking for that breakthrough in the right sector.\n44:5 Comment: Cejudo plays it first, he punctures it and Rubén Castro tries to hide it, he recovers Arda, he goes\n44:9 Comment: with all Cejudo and beats the Turk, although they insist that

of that in the atmosphere and also\n44:58 Comment: He touched her right next to the assistant, so he had little chance of escaping her.\n45:4 Comment: Suárez ended up involuntarily assisting Arda, it was the 45th, how long did they last?\n45:8 Comment: One, one, we have to get to 46.\n45:10 Comment: It could be the last one, with Suárez's head, he tried to cushion it, I don't know if he wanted to combine with\n45:14 Comment: Messi, it didn't seem like a shot and in any case the action was invalid because...\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: If it is going to be that Barça at the end of the first intense game that almost went to the Betis area\n0:6 Comment: in search of the fourth goal and already have complete peace of mind in the game or if it is going to be a\n0:11 Comment: Barça is also

Striker who is located at the point in front, breaks to the point at the near post and that remains\n3:42 Comment: space for the one who arrives from the second line.\n3:46 Comment: Denis Suárez was looking for an inside pass.\n3:49 Comment: Try to get him out of Betis, get Rakitic back.\n3:52 Comment: Rakitic ends up on the ground, Ondiano was very close and he lets it continue.\n3:54 Comment: This Sarda who is preferred for hitting, plays to the outside for Suárez, it is given\n3:57 Comment: back to Denis, Denis for Messi.\n3:59 Comment: Pame Antonio Adan and Arda Turan ends up scoring on the line.\n4:4 Comment: Region invalidated due to offside Ricardo.\n4:7 Comment: Yes, because the Turkish footballer's position was advanced according to the judge's view.\n4:13 Comment: line, so at the moment he participated and touched that ball that\n4:17 Comment: seemed to enter Adan's goal, the play is invalidated.\n4:21 Comment: There we see the position of Arda Turan, she seems a little advanced on that ball in the\n4:26 Comment: The doubt remains whether Adam would arrive or not.\n4:29 Comment: Barça's charge returns, again Messi and again Adan, again Antonio Adan\n4:33 Comment: Rakitic hits.\n4:34 Comment: Betis was saved, Barça had it for the fourth.\n4:38 Comment: He is coughing up the green and white team from the start.\n4:41 Comment: FC Barcelona just had Iván Rakitic.\n4:45 Comment: It's still touched.\n4:48 Comment: Yes, now are difficult times because arrivals are from many places and from\n4:53 Comment: Many people.\n4:54 Comment: It is true that we talk about Messi, we talk about Luis Suárez, but we have seen Denis\n4:58 Comment: also arrive well, those from outside have joined well, Arda...\n5:2 Comment: And then when they increase the pace there, the 3-3 there, it's very difficult.\n5:8 Comment: It is very difficult.\n5:10 Comment: Yes, the doubt will remain if that ball, if Arda had not gone, if it had been a goal or\n5:15 Comment: No, but hey, it is also a forward's vocation to finish.\n5:21 Comment: Sergi Roberto plays looking for options above.\n5:26 Comment: He finds Luis Suárez, once again the right-back, stopping Piqué here.\n5:31 Comment: Calmly build the Barça of a Luis Enrique who applauded that last opportunity with friction\n5:37 Comment: by Rakitic.\n5:38 Comment: Above all because it is a good start to the second half, with a lot of rhythm, with a lot\n5:41 Comment: arrival, another one.\n5:42 Comment: Well, and he keeps Messi.\n5:43 Comment: There is Messi who would step on, Sergi Roberto accompanies him, he breaks inside, Messi continues\n5:46 Comment: that is emerging, Messi wants it, Messi puts it for the...\n5:48 Comment: Dennis!\n5:49 Comment: The first volley, perhaps lacked a little strength, ended up being caught by Antonio\n5:54 Comment: Adam.\n5:55 Comment: Another for Barcelona and we are only six minutes into the second half that the footballers\n6:0 Comment: Betis may seem more like them.\n6:2 Comment: Yes, yes, but it is very difficult to mark a man who is coming.\n6:8 Comment: And of course, Messi knows how to put the ball wherever he wants, you understand?\n6:12 Comment: When in this sense we have seen Denis Suárez enter here, we have seen Luis\n6:17 Comment: Suárez in the first half, it is very very difficult.\n6:20 Comment: You can have five, six, seven players in there defending, but one player\n6:24 Comment: That it comes to you like that is very difficult to defend.\n6:27 Comment: And when he learns that Denis has left the ball a little behind to finish,\n6:32 Comment: while he leaves the space in front of you, Leo is able to see you to put that ball in front of you\n6:37 Comment: yours so that you can control it well.\n6:38 Comment: The important thing is to arrive, not to be there.\n6:41 Comment: And he also when you see the space sometimes you occupy it.\n6:46 Comment: But the arrival was obviously good and careful, the player who is born from a ball steal\n6:52 Comment: Leo Messi.\n6:53 Comment: Musonda is going.\n6:54 Comment: There's Messi, he screws it in without any problems for Adán, Ricardo said.\n6:58 Comment: Musonda is going to go, it is the second change that Gustavo Poyet is going to make at Betis.\n7:2 Comment: Let's remember that the first due to injury and forced to enter Charlie Musonda,\n7:7 Comment: a Belgian player who is going to give more speed to the green and white team.\n7:12 Comment: In addition, Joaquín and Fabián Ruiz, one of the two, also warm up.\n7:16 Comment: He will only be able to jump onto the playing field now.\n7:20 Comment: Well, you always want to see the great Charlie Musonda Jr..\n7:23 Comment: Players like you always say, Andoni, things happen when it's your turn.\n7:27 Comment: Well, a lot happens with Musonda, in general.\n7:29 Comment: Well, that is surely what Poyet hopes, that it gives him speed, rhythm, nerve.\n7:34 Comment: there in the one against one.\n7:36 Comment: I would also like to see Joaquín, the historical ones are also worth seeing.\n7:40 Comment: Well, it actually looks like it's warming up, doesn't it Ricardo?\n7:42 Comment: Yes, yes, that's what I was saying, that both Joaquín and Fabián Ruiz, the homegrown soccer player\n7:48 Comment: of Betis, they also exercise on the Camp Nou sideline.\n7:51 Comment: What happens is that there will only be one change left for Poyet, so he will have to\n7:54 Comment: choose a lot in the remainder of the game.\n7:56 Comment: There are only eight of the second half at the time he is going to make that second substitution.\n8:1 Comment: But such an algae from Antonio Adan.\n8:5 Comment: Felipe Gutiérrez headed down, but Rubén Castro did not arrive.\n8:9 Comment: This is a titi delivering for Arda.\n8:11 Comment: Ah, with everything, Toni Sanabria.\n8:14 Comment: This is Jordi Alba and this Luis Suárez.\n8:18 Comment: First to Sarda, for Denis Gerard Piqué.\n8:24 Comment: The 3 advances with hierarchy, Sergi Roberto joins the attack, Messi is asking for it,\n8:29 Comment: they give it\n8:30 Comment: There is the captain, there is the 10 delivering for Luis Suárez.\n8:34 Comment: Behind first, another of Suárez looking for Messi.\n8:37 Comment: The Betis defense manages to take it out, even if it is only to the front of the area.\n8:41 Comment: Rakitic hit him, he touched a green and white player.\n8:44 Comment: Another ball up in this case from Álvaro Cejudo.\n8:47 Comment: Secure a titi for Denis Suárez.\n8:49 Comment: At the moment little demand, but on the occasions in which it has been like that, it has been as\n8:55 Comment: less successful Samuel Umtiti.\n8:57 Comment: Yes, calmly too, when he had to get the ball too, when he had to\n9:1 Comment: than fighting for the ball, he was happy.\n9:4 Comment: Come on, let's make the change, Ricardo.\n9:5 Comment: Felipe Gutiérrez, a man from the center of the field, leaves so that Charlie Musonda enters,\n9:9 Comment: that number 7 number that seeks speed in the green and white team.\n9:14 Comment: Second substitution in Gustavo Poyet's team.\n9:17 Comment: Well, it was Pipe Gutiérrez, who surely did not have the best debut in the\n9:23 Comment: Liga Santander, we have changed banks this year.\n9:28 Comment: But, I insist, it does not seem to be the most appropriate match context for the midfielder either.\n9:34 Comment: Chilean.\n9:35 Comment: In his place comes Charlie Musonda, a totally different player.\n9:39 Comment: We will have to see what Gustavo Poyet is looking for with this.\n9:41 Comment: There is actually Musonda looking for the center and finding this corner kick.\n9:46 Comment: Well, Poyet uses what Michael has used so many times, that the best way\n9:51 Comment: To defend is to attack, right?\n9:52 Comment: It is not.\n9:53 Comment: Clear.\n9:55 Comment: I think that's the idea, right?\n9:56 Comment: Look for someone who tries to fix at least Jordi Alba here on the side to\n10:0 Comment: Let him worry about his back.\n10:2 Comment: There are many clichés, there is only one ball, eh?\n10:4 Comment: Clear.\n10:7 Comment: Álvaro Cejudo is preparing to execute, he wants to discount Betis from a dead ball.\n10:12 Comment: One, two, three, four, five players in green and white looking for the shot.\n10:16 Comment: Cejudo put it, short delivery.\n10:19 Comment: Barcelona pushes her away and is going to mount the counterattack.\n10:21 Comment: Directs Messi Operations.\n10:23 Comment: Busquets, Arda and Suárez accompany him.\n10:25 Comment: Almost nothing.\n10:26 Comment: There's ten.\n10:27 Comment: Messi continues, breaks the first, delivers Messi to Arda.\n10:30 Comment: It burns on the front, again Messi, who turns around, Messi puts it for Suárez.\n10:33 Comment: Threw it.\n10:34 Comment: Goal!\n10:43 Comment: From Barça in '55.\n10:46 Comment: Another from Luis Suárez.\n10:49 Comment: In that counter led by Messi, who decided to play, who decided to speak,\n10:53 Comment: who decided to associate with precision, playing fast.\n10:57 Comment: Goldsmithing action, looking for free spaces.\n11:1 Comment: The ball ends up at the far post.\n11:3 Comment: Almost, almost football.\n11:5 Comment: Play the game looking for that gap for Luis Suárez to enter the shot,\n11:8 Comment: that fits with the interior to bring Barcelona's score to four.\n11:12 Comment: Luis Suárez scores, FC Barcelona 4-1 Real Betis.\n11:16 Comment: This is very good, so far it is phenomenal.\n11:19 Comment: Because they go very fast like that.\n11:21 Comment: Where something can be said, Betis' defense is here.\n11:26 Comment: Look, one, two, three, looking, and Messi goes alone.\n11:31 Comment: Yes, it seemed that, in addition, that play by Barça was made at the exit of the rebound,\n11:35 Comment: that ball that Luis Suárez comes to pick up and leaves it, and the counterattack comes out.\n11:39 Comment: We have seen it many times, but what it seemed was that in the plays there were\n11:45 Comment: finished the counterattack, so to speak, with the action of Messi,\n11:49 Comment: which has then found continuity with Arda.\n11:52 Comment: And if you put it like that to Luis Suárez, then a gift.\n11:56 Comment: He wants 10 more, eh, Messi.\n11:58 Comment: Get in.\n12:0 Comment: Goal!\n12:9 Comment: Barça goal of '57!\n12:11 Comment: 10 again!\n12:13 Comment: Once again Leo Messi, who gives the final kick to the game!\n12:18 Comment: With that hit from the front adjusted to the post, in three minutes, in two actions,\n12:24 Comment: Barça wanted to put an end to this.\n12:26 Comment: Messi brand.\n12:28 Comment: FC Barcelona 5-1 Real Betis.\n12:32 Comment: There are still thirty-odd minutes left.\n12:35 Comment: The only thing Betis can do now is close, say, hey, they're already lost,\n12:42 Comment: but what we can't do, we can lose here.\n12:46 Comment: It was possible to think about it before the game, but of course, with six or seven goals, it wasn't.\n12:54 Comment: For those... to try to get something out...\n12:58 Comment: The action begins with an inward movement of Musonda,\n13:2 Comment: which is the ideal movement for a team that wants to press,\n13:5 Comment: and that puts pressure on the area more than the man,\n13:8 Comment: because at that moment you neither have a pass to play forward nor do you have a backward pass.\n13:12 Comment: There Barça closed it well, tried the ball, ball to Messi,\n13:16 Comment: and from there anything can happen, either a play for continuity or a shot.\n13:20 Comment: And there's another change, right? Third change.\n13:22 Comment: I was going to ask Ricardo for reactions, but the most immediate and most obvious one comes in the form of substitution.\n13:27 Comment: Yes, comments accumulate.\n13:28 Comment: First of all, the Brazilian Petros leaves, the last change is for the entry of Fabián Ruiz.\n13:32 Comment: A youth player with that number 21, the last change for Poyet's team enters the game.\n13:37 Comment: And the goals. Luis Suárez scored first, Betis did not protest much,\n13:41 Comment: but it was in a doubtful position, at least online.\n13:44 Comment: It would be necessary to look at Messi's pass, if the Uruguayan's moment of finishing is in the correct position or not,\n13:49 Comment: and then Messi scored again.\n13:50 Comment: The lack of Neymar, Barça's forward line works, and in what way.\n13:54 Comment: One for Arda, two for Messi, two for Luis Suárez.\n13:57 Comment: We are already at 5-1 for Luis Enrique's team.\n14:1 Comment: Yes, Ricardo, he was an inch behind, Luis Suárez waiting for Messi's pass.\n14:9 Comment: The doubt clarified.\n14:10 Comment: Difficult moment for Betis, because as Michael said before,\n14:14 Comment: Now what do you do, you try to disguise the result with a goal, but of course, you know that it could fall on you...\n14:20 Comment: You can score two or three goals.\n14:21 Comment: ...everything, or I'm left behind, which makes it seem like you're settling for a 5-1.\n14:26 Comment: Well, try to play every minute of the game with intensity,\n14:30 Comment: and that the game calms down, that Barça opts for...\n14:34 Comment: No, no, it's just that you go back waiting for the game to calm down a little in 5 or 7 minutes,\n14:39 Comment: because at this moment, now I can go through anything, you understand?\n14:43 Comment: Yes, there are also moments in the games, what Michael said,\n14:46 Comment: that anyone else can do anything.\n14:48 Comment: Of course, when the others are guys like Messi, well, of course, the things that can happen are very serious.\n14:54 Comment: They are more serious.\n14:55 Comment: You look at the clock with 57, you already do the calculations, right?\n15:2 Comment: Munir warms up at FC Barcelona, ​​it is the first move for Luis Enrique's bench.\n15:7 Comment: One interprets that Poyet is already thinking about next games\n15:10 Comment: and in the negative effects that what happens today could have.\n15:14 Comment: Surely Luis also has time to start looking at his bench as well,\n15:18 Comment: with Munir, who is a player who has been very good in the pre-season,\n15:20 Comment: and also be able to give him minutes and time, use him on the bench, which is not where many players are missing due to injuries.\n15:28 Comment: Well, there goes another thrower, a little far away for the foul, but Messi says it, he doesn't dare us...\n15:38 Comment: Nothing seems too far for the Barcelona captain today.\n15:41 Comment: Antonio Adán places a barrier of four to try to avoid the direct launch,\n15:45 Comment: to try to avoid the hat-trick, or what would be the hat-trick if it went in, obviously, from Leo Messi.\n15:51 Comment: Undiano Mallenco authorizes, he wants another one on 10, Luis Suárez also hits Messi against the barrier.\n15:57 Comment: The rejected ball is collected by Arda Turán, who protects with his body to obtain a corner kick.\n16:12 Comment: The person in charge of executing will be Rakitic, close to Arda.\n16:19 Comment: Let us remember that Betis has already made the three substitutions, none at the moment for FC Barcelona.\n16:26 Comment: Rakitic puts it, penalty point, Piqué comes to us, the rejection is for Messi.\n16:32 Comment: Suárez again with Messi, inside ball, Piqué wants to leave it as a cue, the 3 holds it as best he can.\n16:38 Comment: About to score against Betis, there is a foul, yes, Undiano Mallenco indicates a foul.\n16:45 Comment: For Suárez for protesting, as soon as the foul was pointed out, the linesman turned around, the gesture of rage cost the Uruguayan Barça footballer his first card.\n16:56 Comment: I think it has stuck to Undiano, that is the first part, at some point there has been some protest.\n17:4 Comment: That is the reaction of Barça's Uruguayan attacker, which ended up leading him to see the yellow card, the first for a footballer from the local team.\n17:14 Comment: Shortly before, he was doing what he likes most and what he is best at, scoring goals.\n17:20 Comment: This time with a pass from Leo Messi, who a minute later, a minute and a half more or less, also decided to score the second of his own with that cross kick.\n17:30 Comment: 5 to 1, a very complicated scenario for Betis.\n17:33 Comment: Kun Titi is thinking, he is going to have to prepare, because these types of scenarios are what Piqué also likes to join TV, he is going to have to learn to play with that situation as well.\n17:43 Comment: Bruno puts the center in from the wing, rejecting the FC Barcelona defense, Fabián, Cejudo opening.\n17:53 Comment: Durmisi tries to overflow on that side, inside stoppage cleared by Sergi Roberto, who keeps it? Germán Petzela anticipates. Jordi Alba keeps it.\n18:11 Comment: Good combination from Barça, Denis Suárez comes out strong, Messi, holds on, wants to turn around and receives the foul from Dani Ceballos.\n18:20 Comment: They ask him for yellow, Messi turns a Mallenco target after Dani Ceballos's grab, Navarro says no, the Barça captain gets angry, as does the Camp Nou crowd, because he was able to forgive him that warning.\n18:37 Comment: It's more because if you get a card for a protest, for an action that is clearly to interrupt a play, we are not going to put it in, the first day with open ribs.\n18:48 Comment: Messi to the ground, he takes a blow from Bruno, Arda, Turan and Jordi Alba are asking for a card, at the moment it seems Ricardo can't get it on target.\n18:56 Comment: No, he temporizes with the warnings after the one shown to Luis Suárez, on this occasion there should be no yellow card, there we see the foul on Leo Messi, very clear, it is very dangerous again for Adán, because from there Leo Messi can be outlined Suárez can also do it.\n19:12 Comment: We must remember that it is also a very good place for Neymar, but Neymar is still in the Olympic Games looking for the gold medal and is not yet going to join Barça.\n19:20 Comment: Good place for Denis, from there with Barça B he has scored a very good goal, but obviously when the captain is there, Rakitic can also hit it from there.\n19:32 Comment: We remind him of last year one with Villarreal against Naples in the Europa League, which served to win a tremendous goal for the squad.\n19:40 Comment: I'm going to say it about Rakitic, who, on top of his Sevilla past, may also have Denis's.\n19:48 Comment: But Leo has placed the ball.\n19:50 Comment: Everything you say is true, but the one who placed the ball is the 10 and he looked for the valve, he placed it the way he likes.\n19:58 Comment: And from there he is going to threaten and only he looks like Adan with Barcelona's sixth goal.\n20:3 Comment: Undiano authorizes, Messi is going to hit him, the ball also stops near the ball Rakitic.\n20:8 Comment: The 10 starts, Messi hits it, Messi hits it.\n20:11 Comment: Applause from the Camp Nou, Messi hits him, up.\n20:15 Comment: Above is Leo Messi's shot, in fact very deviated from Betis' goal.\n20:20 Comment: I was waiting for Adam to move.\n20:22 Comment: He was looking, that's why he started the movement twice, that goalkeeper was taking a little step.\n20:27 Comment: That movement that we said about Claudio Bravo in the Betis action.\n20:32 Comment: And that's the counter play, right?\n20:42 Comment: We take advantage of these technological innovations to precisely mark the area where Luis Suárez would have been offside.\n20:53 Comment: Which helps us to see that the goal is completely legal.\n20:56 Comment: The one scored by the Uruguayan player, the one that was 4-1 for Barcelona at the time.\n21:3 Comment: Ricardo Munir said.\n21:5 Comment: Yes, he is preparing, it will be the first change in Luis Enrique's team with 5-1.\n21:9 Comment: Let's see who is the man who is leaving.\n21:11 Comment: We must remember that this week FC Barcelona still has no match in week three.\n21:15 Comment: But he comes from the Super Cup and the next day he has to travel to San Mames against an always difficult Atleti-Clu de Bilbao.\n21:21 Comment: In the case of Betis, they receive Deportivo on Friday.\n21:23 Comment: I say this because of the modifications and the upcoming games that I mentioned before.\n21:29 Comment: Since there was no game during the week, what happens is that of course, we have also said that since the market is open, the modifications sometimes come from somewhere else.\n21:37 Comment: Luis Enrique has already said that not only are they going to leave but they are also going to arrive.\n21:40 Comment: Suárez wants more. Suárez inside the area. He failed to overcome the international Angelino Mandí.\n21:49 Comment: There's Fabián maneuvering on the front. He receives Dani Ceballos who turns around. He stretches Durmisi. Ball for the Danish international to run.\n21:56 Comment: Rubén Castro is calling for it in the center and is not offside. Now yes, but they don't give it to them.\n22:0 Comment: This is Sanabria. Sanabria turns around, hides it in front of a titi. To the ground Sanabria.\n22:6 Comment: A titi comes out with hierarchy, with strength, who receives the foul from Dani Ceballos. And now, card for the Utrera midfielder.\n22:13 Comment: She was forgiven before with the grab on Messi. Now at fault, in the kick he cut off the exit of a titi who from behind executed that beginning of the counterattack very well.\n22:23 Comment: Warning for Dani Ceballos. Warning for the Betis footballer. At the moment Munir is going to enter the field of play, I think the game will not start before the change.\n22:33 Comment: Although the assistant comes to mark the man who is going to leave. No, not yet. We'll have to wait one more game I think.\n22:40 Comment: Betis has done well with the counterattack play. Barça's defensive line has also recovered its position well.\n22:49 Comment: And then there is always the help that Busquets gives you in front of you to help ensure that no one turns comfortably or can play facing up.\n22:56 Comment: Now it seems that the game has slowed down a bit, seeing with the eyes of Betis at a lower pace.\n23:6 Comment: But we also said it in the first half, then in five minutes they scored two goals.\n23:36 Comment: That's where Betis recovers. Rubén Castro plays.\n23:41 Comment: The Canarian footballer holding on. He has not managed to balance himself from the pressure of the Barcelona defenders' vigilance.\n23:49 Comment: And now the change is coming. Richard. Munir is going to enter. At the moment we do not see a number on the board.\n23:56 Comment: I don't know if it's stuck or if it doesn't come out. There's the fourth referee. Well, the one who leaves is that two to number six.\n24:2 Comment: Denis Suárez leaves. One of the additions in his return to FC Barcelona.\n24:7 Comment: He received applause from the Camp Nou stands of 65,000 spectators after a hard-fought match.\n24:14 Comment: A match in which one of the signings has participated. Enter Munir.\n24:19 Comment: Who knows if in the last game before leaving on loan or if he finally stays in this squad that is looking for the fourth striker.\n24:28 Comment: The front quarter appearing as Arda as a scorer. Michael said it in the preview.\n24:34 Comment: We do not know. Luis said in the statements that players are going to leave and enter.\n24:41 Comment: Yes, it is interesting to test Arda again as an interior.\n24:45 Comment: He has quite found his space there, coming out from the outside and looking to play inside.\n24:50 Comment: And today it returns to its natural position, so to speak.\n24:56 Comment: We will see a good game from Denis.\n24:58 Comment: By the way, it warms up Dinier too.\n25:3 Comment: Rakitic.\n25:4 Comment: It is good for Barça that they have at least seen that Adolphe Durand can fulfill this role.\n25:11 Comment: If one of the three dispositions is out, it can fulfill there.\n25:16 Comment: If Neymar is not there like today, he can play there.\n25:18 Comment: If Suárez is not there, he can play without nine with Messi in the middle.\n25:22 Comment: Messi is missing, Messi is missing. So it doesn't matter who signs.\n25:27 Comment: Leo came out two months early for the photo, but they are not ready to play yet.\n25:34 Comment: When they told me that deduction, I said that same thing.\n25:38 Comment: That you just said that there is Boyfriend.\n25:40 Comment: If Leo is not there... And Barça last year with Leo injured also managed to solve that situation.\n25:46 Comment: With Munir and with other team offices.\n25:50 Comment: But hey, let's wish all the players health at this time.\n25:54 Comment: What is complicated with the striker issue is signing a striker of a certain name.\n25:59 Comment: Let him assume that situation and consider it good.\n26:2 Comment: It is very difficult. Or so as we are talking now, or alternatively, a young man.\n26:7 Comment: Projection, 21, 22, 23 years.\n26:11 Comment: Maybe I can wait a year, a year and a half.\n26:16 Comment: We will also have to see the state in which Neymar arrives due to a different preparation\n26:20 Comment: after facing a demanding competition like the Games in August.\n26:24 Comment: That too. Because of course, there is no break here in Spain until June of next year.\n26:33 Comment: Yes, because by the time he returns after the final of the Games he will have a selection.\n26:40 Comment: The same thing we said at the beginning, the wheel starts moving again.\n26:45 Comment: In any case, if one reaches the final and more and manages to win it, I think Ricardo will return in good shape...\n26:50 Comment: It always comes back in good condition from there.\n26:52 Comment: Yes, no problem now. But problems can come at Christmas, December, January or something like that.\n26:57 Comment: When efforts accumulate.\n26:59 Comment: And there I think it is logical to give two, three weeks of vacation.\n27:6 Comment: It must be remembered that in that case, this summer, Barça reached an agreement with the Brazilian Confederation\n27:11 Comment: so that Neymar would not attend the Copa América, which he also wants to compete in.\n27:14 Comment: Of course, that would have been a setback for Luis Enrique, who is a technician who is very vigilant.\n27:20 Comment: the number of minutes that each footballer has throughout a season.\n27:24 Comment: Ricardo, the setback there is for the player.\n27:27 Comment: Then the coach has to manage the setback.\n27:30 Comment: The situation would have been for the player. I believe that the decision was intelligent on both sides.\n27:36 Comment: And nothing, wish Neymar luck in the Olympic final.\n27:41 Comment: Arna Turán plays.\n27:42 Comment: Against Germany you have to remember, eh?\n27:44 Comment: Against Germany, yes. Surely if a German hears us he will think that, hey, good luck to everyone.\n27:49 Comment: But hey, today we are at the Camp Nou. We will stay with Neymar and Rafinha.\n27:54 Comment: Messi plays to the right for Sergi Roberto.\n27:58 Comment: Suárez first manages to get the leg of the Betis centre-back.\n28:2 Comment: Messi insists opening for the incorporation of Alba.\n28:5 Comment: Charlie Musonda Jr. arrived there to send the ball for a corner.\n28:9 Comment: Digne is going to leave, whose clearest change seems to be Jordi Alba.\n28:14 Comment: Not only because of position, but also because Jordi Alba has practically not played preseason.\n28:18 Comment: Minutes against Sevilla in the Super Cup. Minutes today as a starter.\n28:22 Comment: Maybe we wait for Digne. Everything indicates that the Hospitalet full-back is going to leave in the next action.\n28:32 Comment: There are four Barça players looking for the shot. I send the penalty spot.\n28:36 Comment: Piqué's shot is also sought after by a titi. She even escaped Sergio Busquets.\n28:43 Comment: There were several Barça players in a position to look for that shot.\n28:47 Comment: It was not Busquets but Munir, who had been very close to the ball.\n28:51 Comment: The Betis defense cleared and the players led by Luis Enrique Martínez once again developed the attacking play.\n29:0 Comment: Messi opening. Munir inside the area. Munir can cheer up. Munir for Messi.\n29:4 Comment: Very complicated shot at first with the ball completely on top of the body.\n29:9 Comment: He directed it in the direction of the goal. He tapped Antonio Adan into the corner.\n29:14 Comment: The goalkeeper is quick, because of what you said, he has gone so far.\n29:19 Comment: Sometimes the goalkeeper doesn't see the ball and by the time it comes out you find it inside.\n29:23 Comment: It is very difficult, a technical gesture, to do it like this.\n29:29 Comment: Another corner, Rakitic again. This time short for Arda.\n29:35 Comment: Busquets, Rakitic, against Charlie Musonda Jr. He steps on it inside the area. Burn, good maneuver by Rakitic.\n29:43 Comment: He couldn't handle the second rival that came his way. Messi insists that he was also looking for Rakitic.\n29:47 Comment: Earthquake, fell to the Croatian.\n29:50 Comment: Find space for the center. He has short help from Arda Turán.\n29:55 Comment: Good maneuver by Rakitic, who steps on the soba and unloads with the outside on Busquets.\n29:59 Comment: I also liked Busquets with the outside. Rakitic, who was already exhausted, who could no longer find oxygen.\n30:6 Comment: He put it first inside the area and although the play ended in nothing, Ricardo rewarded it with applause.\n30:11 Comment: The Barcelona fans.\n30:12 Comment: The Camp Nou crowd is liking their team's play, especially in this second half,\n30:16 Comment: in waves arriving on many occasions at Adam's goal.\n30:19 Comment: There are 30 of the second half, 5 to 1 the goals, the opportunities and perhaps the detail that Adan\n30:26 Comment: may be the most prominent man in the green and white team.\n30:29 Comment: And I take advantage of the change. Jordi Alba leaves. Digné is going to enter, as expected.\n30:34 Comment: And when it occurs in the 30th minute it seems that even it was agreed, that Luis Enrique loses,\n30:39 Comment: that he had 75 minutes of the game on the side of the Barça team.\n30:44 Comment: Enter Digné, one of the new faces, one of the signings, making his league debut.\n30:49 Comment: The former French footballer from Roma, well, he has competition.\n30:53 Comment: Jordi Alba seems to be a winger much more than in recent years.\n30:58 Comment: Player with a very similar profile, very similar to Jordi, even physically,\n31:3 Comment: probably removed his hair, but it looks pretty similar.\n31:7 Comment: A player who projects well, who works well, does... ufff.\n31:12 Comment: Clara is missing from Rubén Castro, who apologizes, who raised his hand to have it pointed at him\n31:16 Comment: like basketball, but Undiano Mallenco was already on his way there, and he cautioned the Betis scorer.\n31:21 Comment: I think he raised his hand to see if he avoided the yellow cardboard,\n31:25 Comment: but no, the Canary did not do it, and he received the warning.\n31:28 Comment: He also scored 5 to 1. Rakitic was leaving.\n31:32 Comment: Well, first day of the league, first card, but maybe it could have been avoided\n31:37 Comment: the Betis striker.\n31:38 Comment: Very obvious, right? Too obvious. I believe that she has raised her arm to avoid greater evils on the card.\n31:43 Comment: Because it was a play that I couldn't come up with, I didn't have any of the other ideas.\n31:48 Comment: Offensive players don't know how to foul.\n31:50 Comment: They don't know how to make fouls.\n31:52 Comment: Burn.\n31:55 Comment: Diñe was going up on the left, Munir held on, they finally took it away from him.\n32:0 Comment: The Spanish international comes out from the right, Charlie Musonda, who is going to start the bike.\n32:4 Comment: Very tough test for Diñe. Musonda stops and has the ability to start again whenever she wants.\n32:9 Comment: It's 3 for 1, he got into a mess, he found his way out on the worst side for sure,\n32:14 Comment: where two Barça players arrived.\n32:17 Comment: And that alley came out without the ball.\n32:19 Comment: Lucas Diñe has recovered well. He has become good at playing, sometimes projection players.\n32:26 Comment: I suppose that also passing through Italian football means that one has to be consistent.\n32:31 Comment: of the tactical concepts of the game as well, not only the first leg, but also the return leg.\n32:35 Comment: Italian football always starts from behind.\n32:38 Comment: No, no, that's how it is. That's why they have won many cups too, world cups, everything. But that's how it is.\n32:48 Comment: Then from time to time I had a player from midfield up who played quite well,\n32:52 Comment: but well, not always.\n32:55 Comment: Coming out from the right is Barça, Sergi Roberto.\n32:58 Comment: Busquets, Sergi Roberto and again Zardaturan.\n33:6 Comment: Diñe.\n33:11 Comment: Arda puts it horizontally for Rakitic.\n33:14 Comment: All Betis players except Sanabria behind the ball.\n33:19 Comment: Even so, Messi manages to receive. He got between two but couldn't with the third.\n33:23 Comment: Bruno back to Adan, who shakes her off and timidly looks for Musonda,\n33:28 Comment: although the advantage goes to Diñe.\n33:33 Comment: Be careful, watch out for Fabián's kick. He turns back to Arda, he didn't like her at all\n33:39 Comment: that arrival of the Betis youth player from behind. He points out the foul to Undiano, but it stays there, nothing more.\n33:45 Comment: Yes, because I would see the feeling that Barça is not accelerating because the game is resolved.\n33:50 Comment: And what awaits from Betis' point of view is a little more peace of mind.\n33:55 Comment: Another foul.\n33:59 Comment: Coming out of the cave, in quotes, Mandic tried to anticipate and when he saw that he didn't, he understood\n34:4 Comment: that he had to commit that infraction, which is not a bad idea either. If you see that they surpass you...\n34:7 Comment: Yes. No, but we must also add fatigue.\n34:11 Comment: The first league game, almost 80 minutes, you are losing 5-1 against a team that\n34:19 Comment: always has the ball. Is not easy.\n34:23 Comment: Now it does give the feeling on the pitch that Betis is arriving late for all these actions.\n34:28 Comment: Yes Yes.\n34:31 Comment: You also add that you had to run a lot after the ball throughout the game.\n34:37 Comment: and the result is where it is.\n34:42 Comment: Messi puts his toe in, the ball escapes, the green and white defense clears, bad control\n34:49 Comment: in that maneuver by Dani Ceballos who commits a foul, which knocks down Ivan Rakitic, giving him\n34:56 Comment: possession to FC Barcelona.\n34:59 Comment: Yes, it is the moment of the public, the moment in which the interest in the field puts it\n35:5 Comment: the fans too, who enjoy the game, those who follow Barça, obviously, the\n35:10 Comment: who have come from Sevilla, with a team project that looks good.\n35:18 Comment: New infraction favorable to Barcelona.\n35:20 Comment: It shows that there are still many tourists at Camp Nou. I insist, in the month of August\n35:25 Comment: In Barcelona it is a very touristy month. It is also noticeable that there are many fans,\n35:29 Comment: many members who are still on vacation. Entry at 65,000 euros and many fans\n35:36 Comment: of Betis.\n35:37 Comment: 65,000 spectators?\n35:38 Comment: Yes, 65,000.\n35:39 Comment: If everyone I'm seeing has paid what you say, it's been good business\n35:45 Comment: Full Time.\n35:46 Comment: Sorry, sorry. 5,000 fans have been given.\n35:48 Comment: What would you be thinking about?\n35:49 Comment: Well, I was trying to show everything a little bit, but Betis fans who have come\n35:53 Comment: not only from Seville, but many who reside in Catalonia.\n35:56 Comment: Yes, a team that has many supporters. I remember playing second for Barça\n36:0 Comment: B, I almost filled the field with Betis fans.\n36:3 Comment: Suárez starts, the 9 hits him, Suárez.\n36:7 Comment: Goal!\n36:20 Comment: From Barça in '81! Zatric from Luis Suárez!\n36:26 Comment: They were four goals ahead. Ten minutes from the end, in that context, on the 10th, the captain\n36:33 Comment: It can leave you a fault. Suárez takes advantage of it to hit him over the barrier.\n36:37 Comment: Antonio Adán does not reach it. He rounds, yes. A brilliant performance. The Uruguayan footballer,\n36:43 Comment: another from Barça. Goal by Luis Suárez. Barcelona 6, Real Betis 1.\n36:48 Comment: Yes, 10-6. It had happened to us before among the pitchers. We had talked about Denis,\n36:52 Comment: We had talked about Rakitic. But of course, if Luis Suárez, who is a man of many\n36:56 Comment: things, apart from being an area player, he scores a goal of that quality, well...\n37:2 Comment: No, he shot very well. I was looking at the barrier, there were only three shoulders there.\n37:10 Comment: It seemed like a... Daring, right? Yes, daring. I don't know.\n37:16 Comment: It's like an invitation to shoot. I wanted to use another word.\n37:20 Comment: A coach of mine, José Ángel Heríbar, used to tell me that. That in the end a lack\n37:25 Comment: It is a challenge between the thrower and the goalkeeper. That the more defenses you put up, it means\n37:29 Comment: that you are more afraid. I told him that sometimes. But sometimes you will have to put some\n37:33 Comment: to cover, because if not, sometimes the challenge becomes impossible.\n37:38 Comment: That's good what you say. A coach of mine, a coach I had, as if he were anyone,\n37:42 Comment: and it turns out that it is Heríbar, right? José Ángel Heríbar, yes, sir. A myth.\n37:45 Comment: Third goal from Luis Suárez, first hat-trick of the season.\n37:49 Comment: For a start. Yes, yes, to start. You have to remember that he is the top scorer of the league\n37:53 Comment: pass. He scored 40 goals. The kiss on the three fingers for his three children. And also with\n37:58 Comment: dedication. I think for Masí, from what I have been able to intuit. So that's where the\n38:2 Comment: The goalkeeper and the striker could also marry the celebration.\n38:6 Comment: Yes, I have dedicated it to someone on the bench. I don't know if because I didn't think I could\n38:10 Comment: score goal Careful. Look for Betis' second and there it is.\n38:12 Comment: Goal!\n38:19 Comment: From Betis in 83. Goal by whom? The usual one. Goal by Rubén Castro.\n38:23 Comment: With that cross from the side that the Barça defense could not clear.\n38:27 Comment: It fell to the Canario, who knows how to position himself like few others. And as soon as he saw that fumble,\n38:31 Comment: that free ball, he crossed it against Bravo. To notice the second green and white goal.\n38:36 Comment: It will be of little use in terms of scoring. It will be of little use in sports.\n38:40 Comment: But there is Betis' second goal. Goal by Rubén Castro. Barça 6-2 Betis.\n38:46 Comment: Yes, ball. Barça always defends in that position, taking out the defensive line\n38:50 Comment: to the line of attack, that is, to the far defensive line. When someone puts that ball\n38:56 Comment: Either the player with the first suit gets it right, or if not, there can always be some situation like that.\n39:2 Comment: The punter has not been clear and the one who always lives in the area has arrived there\n39:7 Comment: And it has that relationship with the goal that never fails, right? You said it all at the beginning.\n39:12 Comment: It's Ruben Castro. Well, a good detail at least for Betis.\n39:15 Comment: The 6-2 makes it clear that Rubén Castro has started the season well.\n39:20 Comment: It does not serve to score points, but it does to show that the Canario is starting the league\n39:24 Comment: with the nose for goal, with his pituitary in top shape to help Betis.\n39:31 Comment: I insist, 6-2 and the anger of Unzué, who was standing in the technical area\n39:36 Comment: after seeing how that strategic play ended in a goal.\n39:40 Comment: Yes, because sometimes the strategy is defended not only by position, but also by tension.\n39:44 Comment: And after a few moments of this, there is always a bit of calm in these situations, right?\n39:49 Comment: And in those calm situations it is always possible that someone makes a mistake or there is a rebound.\n39:55 Comment: Or what's more, when you are attentive to those issues they are resolved in another way.\n40:0 Comment: But also the result, the moment, everything, because it invited that type of situation.\n40:5 Comment: It is very, very obvious, but that does not mean we are going to stop commenting on it.\n40:8 Comment: Perhaps the best news that Betis is going to take away from here are the two goals from Rubén Castro.\n40:14 Comment: More than anything because the green and white box has been worn for several seasons.\n40:18 Comment: The last one would go further.\n40:19 Comment: Thinking about his attack planning, about bringing partners to Rubén Castro so that he doesn't have to do, in quotes, everything or almost everything.\n40:26 Comment: Proven players like Ricky Van Voswinkel and Leandro Damiao have not worked out.\n40:31 Comment: But hey, there comes a point when you say, hey, Rubén is already in his thirties, at some point he will stop scoring goals.\n40:36 Comment: That moment does not arrive nor is it glimpsed or guessed.\n40:39 Comment: It's fundamental. Have a player up front who guarantees you a certain number of goals each season\n40:47 Comment: It is essential for any team, but especially for teams like Betis,\n40:53 Comment: the majority in the Spanish league, because if you always have someone up front who scores 15 or 20 goals for you, it is a guarantee.\n41:2 Comment: I think, as you said, Toni Sanabria's contribution is interesting.\n41:7 Comment: They are two different player profiles and they also have a very good relationship with the goal.\n41:12 Comment: Now he has to acquire consistency as a player in the role that the coach also gives him.\n41:17 Comment: And he is a player who, of course, when the responsibility always falls to...\n41:22 Comment: We have spoken at Barça many times when it was said that the responsibility for the goals was only Messi's.\n41:26 Comment: The moment Messi says, Luis appears, Neymar appears, the midfield line appears,\n41:30 Comment: Well, it is true that scorers are always necessary because they appear in important games,\n41:35 Comment: but it is also important that we help them.\n41:37 Comment: Messi leaves it with a header, Suárez looking for space for the fourth, delivers behind for Rakitic.\n41:42 Comment: Munir claims it close to the penalty spot.\n41:45 Comment: Messi again, Messi looks for the gap, Messi driving, Messi for Digne.\n41:50 Comment: He covered Antonio Adán to send Körner.\n41:55 Comment: He covered Adan to send Digne's shot to Körner.\n41:59 Comment: That appeared in the race to finish that action led by Leo Messi.\n42:4 Comment: There was Barça's seventh.\n42:7 Comment: Yes, that is Leo's ability to find a pass where there seems to be nothing.\n42:12 Comment: And Adan has been good, covering and coming out determined to save that ball with a Digne addition.\n42:21 Comment: Sergi Roberto, Busquets, ball inside the area, Fabián clears.\n42:28 Comment: Digne reconstructs the action, ball for Rakitic, Rakitic sticks, up.\n42:33 Comment: Adam has touched, right?\n42:35 Comment: A corner kick is given.\n42:37 Comment: If Adam doesn't play, it's a great goal.\n42:39 Comment: What a parabola that ball was tracing that went very close to the crossbar.\n42:46 Comment: What a hand from the Betis goalkeeper.\n42:48 Comment: Yes, yes, wow, that's how it goes inside.\n42:50 Comment: A little bit rough, a little bit of exterior adds to the effect and the...\n42:54 Comment: Taking it towards the goalkeeper, but you have to get up there and not only do you have to get there, then you have to get the ball out.\n42:59 Comment: Sometimes it comes, it touches you and it only serves to get you out of it.\n43:3 Comment: Rakitic's launch, flat to the front for Busquets to hook it first.\n43:7 Comment: The shot was not good, Messi can try it again.\n43:9 Comment: Messi, Messi stops, Messi looks for him, Messi hits him against Mandy's body.\n43:14 Comment: The danger continues over the Betic goal.\n43:17 Comment: If Rakitic's shot didn't arrive, the incorporation of Betis would have been great.\n43:20 Comment: It was already there to finish too.\n43:31 Comment: There is a Betis player on the ground, Ricardo.\n43:34 Comment: I couldn't see it from my position.\n43:36 Comment: Well, he just got up, you won't see him anymore.\n43:38 Comment: Yes, yes, but...\n43:39 Comment: She looked like Mandy, didn't she?\n43:40 Comment: No, Sejudo?\n43:41 Comment: Yes, Sejudo, right?\n43:42 Comment: Yeah.\n43:43 Comment: Sejudo, right?\n43:44 Comment: Already recovered, he was talking with Undiano Mallenco.\n43:46 Comment: Now, actions are resumed at the Camp Nou.\n43:49 Comment: With that very, very close, very short pitch.\n43:52 Comment: That solved the defense of Gustavo Poyet's team.\n43:59 Comment: We are now entering the last minute of regulation time.\n44:2 Comment: Pending the extension decreed by the Navarro referee of the match.\n44:6 Comment: Between two and three, right?\n44:7 Comment: Because of the changes in the game.\n44:8 Comment: No no no no no.\n44:12 Comment: Between two and three, right?\n44:13 Comment: For the changes.\n44:14 Comment: Practically no time has been lost and Barça is going to stay without making a modification\n44:19 Comment: that could correspond to him.\n44:23 Comment: Sergi Roberto.\n44:24 Comment: Yes, plus he doesn't have anyone warming up, which is why I think I'd rather finish with\n44:28 Comment: those he has, even take advantage of the game to do physical work\n44:33 Comment: 90 minutes of players and accumulating workload.\n44:39 Comment: Excellent.\n44:40 Comment: The control of Lucas Diñe.\n44:42 Comment: Munir turns around, Leaves to Musonda.\n44:45 Comment: Munir's center about to be hunted by Arda.\n44:47 Comment: Sergi Roberto wants to save him on the line and he succeeds.\n44:51 Comment: Sergi Roberto is overjoyed and stops dead.\n44:54 Comment: Burn.\n44:58 Comment: Hold on Burn.\n    \n\n

    "summary": "In an exhilarating fixture at the Camp Nou, FC Barcelona began their La Liga campaign with a dominant 6-2 victory over Real Betis. The match was a spectacle of offensive prowess, intricate passing, and individual brilliance, predominantly showcasing the remarkable talents of Lionel Messi and Luis Suárez.\n\nFrom the onset, Barcelona established their intent. Barely 30 seconds into the game, Betis tried to assert themselves by quickly redistributing the ball across the left sector. However, it was clear that Barcelona's tactical approach, characterized by rapid recoveries and pressing high up the pitch, was going to dominate the proceedings.\n\nEarly on, Gustavo Poyet's team demonstrated some ambition, pressing high and attempting to disrupt Barcelona's rhythm. Betis won an early corner after strong work by Durmisi on the left, only for their efforts to be negated by Piqué's defensive prowess. Barca, in their quintessential style, swiftly transitioned from defense to attack. Lionel Messi, orchestrating from deep, connected well with Sergio Roberto and Busquets, underscoring his pivotal role in linking play.\n\nThe first goal arrived in the 6th minute. Messi’s vision split the Betis defense with a beautifully weighted ball to Jordi Alba. Alba, executing a well-timed run, collected the ball, looked up, and found Arda Turan. The Turkish midfielder, with a composed finish, slotted the ball past Antonio Adán, setting the tone for a dominant Barca performance.\n\nBetis, to their credit, attempted to respond through Rubén Castro and Toni Sanabria. Their efforts, though enthusiastic, often led to dispossession, allowing Barcelona to dictate the game’s tempo. The Catalans’ positional play was exemplary, with Denis Suárez filling Xavi's number 6 shirt, playing with creativity and assuredness.\n\nDespite Betis's early intent, it was clear that they were vulnerable, especially when Barcelona's attacking tridents combined. Messi, ever the magician, weaved through Betis' midfield effortlessly, combining well with Sergi Roberto and Luis Suárez.\n\nHowever, against the run of play, Betis found an equalizer in the 20th minute through a superb free-kick from Rubén Castro. The veteran striker, with an expertly taken shot, beat Claudio Bravo, who got a hand to it but couldn't prevent the ball from nesting into the net. It was a brief respite for Betis, momentarily halting the Barcelona onslaught.\n\nBarcelona, galvanized by conceding, quickly regained the lead. In the 37th minute, Messi capitalized on space at the edge of the box, unleashing a low, precise shot that found the bottom corner of Adán's goal. His ability to navigate tight spaces and create goal-scoring opportunities epitomized his extraordinary skill set.\n\nJust before halftime, Luis Suárez scored his first goal of the match. In the 42nd minute, a brilliantly executed move saw Sergio Roberto drift down the right, sending a perfect ball back into the box. Suárez, with a clinical finish, extended Barcelona’s lead to 3-1, securing a comfortable cushion as they headed into the break.\n\nThe second half began much like the first, with Barcelona exerting their dominance. Betis attempted to reconfigure their formation, adopting a more traditional 4-4-2 setup, possibly to add more solidity to their defense and midfield. Despite these changes, Barcelona's relentless pressure and quick transitions continued to unsettle the visitors.\n\nIn the 55th minute, Barcelona's high-octane counterattack yielded another goal. Messi, central to the move, combined efficiently with Arda Turan and Luis Suárez. The latter met a perfect cross at the far post, striking it cleanly to score his second and Barca’s fourth goal, further demoralizing Betis' defense.\n\nOnly two minutes later, Messi showcased his individual brilliance once again, driving through Betis' defensive lines and sending a powerful shot from outside the box, left no chance for Antonio Adán. Messi's second goal of the night underscored Barcelona's sheer attacking might.\n\nAt 5-1, the game seemed beyond Betis' reach. Coach Gustavo Poyet introduced the pacey Charlie Musonda in an attempt to add some vibrancy to Betis’ attack. Despite their efforts, the midfield dynamism of Busquets, the creative link-up of Rakitic, and the relentless pressing from Barcelona meant that Betis were constantly on the back foot.\n\nThe Uruguayan striker, Luis Suarez, completed his hat-trick in the 81st minute with a stunning free-kick that curled beautifully over the wall, demonstrating precision and power, leaving Adán stranded and further highlighting his incredible goal-scoring capability.\n\nBetis managed to grab a consolation goal shortly thereafter. Rubén Castro, again displaying his predatory instincts in front of goal, netted his second of the night. Picking up a loose ball inside the box, Castro finished with aplomb, reducing Barcelona’s advantage slightly but not altering the game's outcome.\n\nThroughout the match, Gerard Piqué and Samuel Umtiti were solid defensively, stepping up when required. Umtiti, making his debut for Barcelona, showed not only his strength in duels but also his composure in ball distribution, fitting seamlessly into the team's style.\n\nAs the full-time whistle approached, Barcelona kept pushing for more, unrelenting in their attacking endeavors. Munir, brought on as a substitute, added fresh legs and dynamism upfront. His quick interchanges with Messi and Arda Turan created additional scoring opportunities, reinforcing the depth of Barcelona's attacking options.\n\nUltimately, Barcelona’s 6-2 routing of Real Betis was a statement of intent for the season ahead. The match highlighted their seamless blend of individual brilliance and cohesive team play. Messi’s dazzling performance, coupled with Suárez's clinical finishing, set a high benchmark. The addition of players like Denis Suárez and Samuel Umtiti also highlighted Barcelona’s depth, signaling their readiness to compete on all fronts.\n\nThis victory was not just about the scoreline but the manner in which it was achieved - with flair, aggression, and clinical precision. If Barça maintains this form, they will undoubtedly be a force to reckon with in the league and beyond."
