    "summary": "In a highly anticipated matchup, Real Madrid hosted Alaves at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in front of a lively crowd of 76,875 fans. Real Madrid emerged victorious with a commanding 3-0 win, showcasing their dominance throughout both halves of the game. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the match that saw Los Blancos capitalizing on their numerous opportunities and holding tight at the back to keep Alaves from scoring.\n\nFirst Half:\n\nThe excitement began with Alaves kicking off the game at 00:00. Real Madrid quickly set the tone in the first minute with a shot off target that resulted in the ball going out of play. As the match progressed, both teams showed eagerness to control the game. However, there was plenty of interruption with frequent throw-ins and clearances as each side attempted to build momentum.\n\nReal Madrid was dealt an early blow at 10:12 when Raphael Varane suffered an injury. Daniel Carvajal replaced him, bringing in fresh legs to continue Real Madrid's solid backline defense. By the 11th minute, Alaves got their first corner which Gomez Pérez Ibai took; however, the ball sailed harmlessly among the defenders. \n\nThe home side showcased their intent to dominate as shots came flying in from Real Madrid players, though initially, luck seemed to evade them. Notably, Karim Benzema at the 15th minute connected to a precise pass but speculatively sent the ball high over the bar. This was followed by Gareth Bale’s free-kick in the 17th minute which narrowly missed the left post.\n\nAlaves found it challenging to penetrate Real Madrid’s defense, their long-range free kicks and shots off target serving only to release the growing pressure. Real Madrid's persistence paid off at 30:13 when Daniel Carvajal’s brilliant play resulted in Karim Benzema slotting the first goal of the game. Benzema’s clinical finish into the left side of the net symbolized Real Madrid’s attacking prowess, lifting the score to 1:0.\n\nIn the remaining minutes of the first half, Real Madrid maintained control, ensuring to keep the visitors at bay. Despite a few scrappy plays that resulted in fouls, both teams continued to push forward. The half ended with Gareth Bale missing narrowly from inside the box, leaving the scoreline at 1-0 in favor of the home team.\n\nSecond Half:\n\nReal Madrid kicked off the second half keen to extend their lead. The initial stages saw Cristiano Ronaldo flagged offside and Alaves’ attempts countered swiftly by Real Madrid's solid defense. The pattern of play continued with the visitors trying to break through, only for their efforts to be ineffectual.\n\nAlaves attempted to capitalize on set-pieces and corners, but Real Madrid's well-organized backline proved a firm barrier. Alaves' physical game slowed the pace down, with more body challenges resulting in several stoppages for fouls and minor injuries. Danilo required medical attention but was able to continue, much to the home crowd's relief.\n\nAround the 22nd minute mark, Real Madrid made a substitution by bringing on Mateo Kovacic for Luka Modric, followed by Alaves' substitution of Gomez Perez Ibai with Oscar Romero. These substitutions were tactical to inject more energy and creativity into the match.\n\nThe 28th minute saw Real Madrid come close to scoring again as Cristiano Ronaldo's shot was blocked by Alaves’ defense. The visitors then substituted Edgar Mendez with Aleksandar Katai to add fresh legs. It wasn’t long before Alaves’ persistent fouling earned Rodrigo Ely a yellow card for a rough tackle.\n\nThe home side continued pressing for more goals, and their pressure paid off in the 39th minute. Cristiano Ronaldo set up a beautiful pass for Isco, who made no mistake slotting it into the top right corner from inside the box, doubling the lead to 2:0.\n\nJust moments later, Real Madrid struck again. They immediately followed up with another attacking move. Gareth Bale’s powerful free-kick struck the crossbar and rebounded into play, only for Nacho to head the ball back into the middle of the goal, making it 3:0 in the 43rd minute.\n\nAlaves showed some brief moments of bravery by trying to muster an attack, but Real Madrid’s brilliance in defense ensured a clean sheet. The visitors’ efforts and substitutions, such as bringing on Christian Santos for Victor Camarasa, failed to change the scoreline as the clock wound down.\n\nIn this enthralling encounter, Real Madrid's strategic play, robust defense, and sharp finishing gave them a well-earned victory. Despite Alaves’ determination and numerous fouls, Real Madrid managed to dominate both halves of the game. This solid performance from Los Blancos not only highlighted their strength and depth but also their resilience in maintaining a clean sheet against a determined Alaves side.\n\nThe last few minutes saw Real Madrid comfortably controlling the tempo of the game, ensuring that Alaves would not find any chance for a late resurgence. The final whistle blew at 48:07, signaling a comprehensive and much-celebrated 3-0 win for Real Madrid.\n\nThis applause-worthy win places Los Blancos in a strong position as they continue their campaign, while Alaves leaves the Santiago Bernabeu with lessons learned and areas for improvement. In summary, it was a match that showcased the tactical depth and incisive attack of Real Madrid, ensuring a memorable night for their fans."
