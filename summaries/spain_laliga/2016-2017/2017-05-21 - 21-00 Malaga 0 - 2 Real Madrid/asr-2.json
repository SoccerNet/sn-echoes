I think he is completely fortuitous.\n30:1 Comment: Because Marcelo is completely unbalanced, in fact he can't even put his foot on the ground.\n30:8 Comment: In this case, in Camacho's face, Camacho evidently does not misunderstand that what he has had is a boot.\n30:15 Comment: From Marcelo almost shaving him.\n30:18 Comment: Well, it ended in nothing, thank God.\n30:20 Comment: There goes Camacho's long header, Keko lowers the ball, Keko touches Luis Hern√°ndez behind.\n30:26 Comment: This opens the ball over Rika's position, open lane for Rika.\n30:30 Comment: Luka Modric is closing it now.\n30:32 Comment: Joni comes on the wing, he plays for Hornal, Luka Modric has cut the ball.\n30:35 Comment: Luka Modric, who cuts back and takes the ball up, could lose it.\n30:38 Comment: Here comes Isco, Camacho has put his leg in hard.\n30:41 Comment: At a late hour that the referee lets the referee continue because M√°laga still has it.\n30:44 Comment: Casemiro's rebound is still for M√°laga, in the end Luka Modric stole the ball.\n30:48 Comment: Casemiro at the start, Real Madrid's counterattack attempt.\n30:51 Comment: Marcelo is coming strong, Karim Benzema is also there.\n30:54 Comment: There has been no understanding with Cristiano, Marcelo is angry because Cristiano actually stopped his career.\n30:59 Comment: And it seemed that there was an open corridor between M√°laga's side and centre-back that Cristiano could have taken advantage of.\n31:6 Comment: The ball goes to M√°laga, with Keiko cutting in on Toni Kroos and delivering the ball to Recio.\n31:12 Comment: Recio changes the game, Rika goes up with a bullet from the side.\n31:16 Comment: He has Joni inside, there he cuts Rika in front of Isco, he returns for Joni.\n31:21 Comment: Another one that Luka Modric steals again, he takes it for Isco.\n31:24 Comment: It was a great game Madrid.\n31:25 Comment: Now Real Madrid receives well.\n31:27 Comment: We are seeing Isco lending a hand to Danilo, just what he needed.\n31:31 Comment: Real Madrid is now a little more solid, without the ball.\n31:35 Comment: Marcelo for Karim Benzema.\n31:38 Comment: Karim Benzema with Marcelo, Marcelo for Sergio, Sergio for Toni Kroos.\n31:42 Comment: Toni Kroos has a start at the back for Sergio, but decides to play for Quezandro.\n31:46 Comment: Sergio Ramos approaches, leaving another man free behind him, which in this case is Varane.\n31:49 Comment: Varane for Danilo, Joni closing on that side.\n31:53 Comment: Ball back again for Danilo.\n31:55 Comment: Seven recoveries already by Luka Modric in the game.\n31:58 Comment: Obviously Casemiro recovers many, there is no discussion around those statistics.\n32:4 Comment: But those that Modric recovers are not few either.\n32:7 Comment: In addition to the fact that he plays them all well, he also recovers so many of them.\n32:10 Comment: There M√°laga is playing the ball with Luis Hern√°ndez.\n32:13 Comment: Luis Hern√°ndez who delivers the ball to Recio.\n32:16 Comment: Recio has Sandro ahead of him, who can't quite find a way to break the sweat of Real Madrid's defense.\n32:22 Comment: And there are other things because the ball is always far from those positions.\n32:26 Comment: M√°laga has the ball there, but when it comes to approaching the danger zone, Madrid has it very under control.\n32:32 Comment: It is not a brilliant match from Madrid's offensive point of view, but it is one of absolute security.\n32:38 Comment: It doesn't have to.\n32:40 Comment: It's probably what the Cinecity team needs and what it's getting.\n32:45 Comment: The plan is perfect, he is protecting himself very well with the ball and now even better without it.\n32:51 Comment: Because Real Madrid most likely knows that if M√°laga continues trying to get ahead,\n32:57 Comment: probably some counterattack is going to catch Real Madrid.\n33:1 Comment: And we have seen how Real Madrid ends the counters with that first play of the minute and minute and a half.\n33:5 Comment: Another one that steals from Luka Modric claiming a foul that the referee did not understand.\n33:9 Comment: Recio plays, touching the ball short for Fornal's position.\n33:13 Comment: Camacho opens, the ball goes to Keco, who is the one who prepares the shipment.\n33:17 Comment: It's Marcelo's turn, that ball stays in the front.

    "summary": "In a thrilling conclusion to the 2016-2017 La Liga season, Real Madrid faced Malaga at the Estadio La Rosaleda with the league title within their grasp. The match was characterized by tactical gameplay, crucial goals, and high tensions. Real Madrid emerged victorious, securing a 2-0 triumph over Malaga, with both goals symbolizing their dominant form throughout the season.\n\nFrom the very outset, it was clear that Real Madrid were focused and determined. The match began at a brisk pace with Real Madrid quickly demonstrating their intent to dominate. Just a minute and a half into the match, a mistake by Malaga defender Luis Hern√°ndez provided Cristiano Ronaldo with an opportunity that he did not miss. Receiving a pass from Isco, Ronaldo skillfully rounded the Malaga goalkeeper Carlos Kameni to calmly place the ball into the net, giving Real Madrid a crucial early lead.\n\nThis early goal set the tone for the rest of the match, with the visitors looking confident and composed. Zidane‚Äôs men dominated possession, methodically building their attacks while keeping a robust defensive structure to repel Malaga's advances. Their midfield trio of Luka Modric, Toni Kroos, and Casemiro operated seamlessly, orchestrating play and breaking down Malaga‚Äôs attempts to counterattack.\n\nMalaga, despite being down early, showed resilience and didn't shy away from pushing forward. Sandro Ram√≠rez was a persistent threat, driving Malaga's offensive efforts with his pace and determination. However, Real Madrid‚Äôs defense, led by the experienced Sergio Ramos and Raphael Varane, stood firm, intercepting passes and making timely clearances.\n\nThroughout the first half, Real Madrid continued to control the game, with Modric and Kroos dictating the tempo. Even when Malaga managed to create openings, Keylor Navas was alert and made a series of crucial saves to maintain the clean sheet. One of his standout moments came from a Sandro free-kick that seemed destined for the top corner, only for Navas to acrobatically tip it over the bar.\n\nMalaga‚Äôs attempts to press high created more spaces for Real Madrid to exploit, and they nearly doubled their lead on several occasions. Benzema and Ronaldo both came close to scoring, with Benzema's header from a Marcelo cross narrowly missing the target. Malaga had their best chance when Sandro found himself in space on the left, only for his shot to be well-saved by Navas.\n\nAs the match progressed into the second half, Malaga displayed even greater urgency, knowing they needed to overturn the deficit. They increased their pressing and tried to disrupt Madrid's rhythm, but the resilience and tactical discipline of Zidane's side shone through. Despite the pressure, Real Madrid's disciplined backline and the midfield's contribution to defense ensured that Malaga found it tough to break through.\n\nIn the 55th minute, Real Madrid effectively sealed the game with their second goal. A well-delivered corner from Toni Kroos found its way into a crowded penalty area. Sergio Ramos's initial header was blocked and rebounded in the six-yard box, where Benzema was perfectly placed to tap it into the net. Although Malaga's players protested for an offside, the goal stood, and Real Madrid found themselves with a comfortable two-goal cushion.\n\nThe tension in the match was palpable as Malaga continued to fight back. They made tactical substitutions, bringing on Chory Castro for Keko, in an attempt to find a breakthrough. And their efforts almost bore fruit on several occasions, especially during a chaotic few minutes where Keylor Navas had to make multiple saves to keep his side in the lead. One of Navas's most spectacular saves came from a fierce shot by Castro, which necessitated a full-stretch dive to tip the ball onto the post.\n\nDespite Malaga's best efforts, Real Madrid remained resolute. The closing stages of the match saw Zidane making strategic substitutions to reinforce the midfield and defense. Isco, who received a standing ovation from both sets of fans, was replaced by James Rodr√≠guez. Later on, Kovacic came on for Kroos, adding fresh legs to the midfield. These changes helped Real Madrid maintain their defensive solidity and control over the game.\n\nAs the final whistle approached, the reality of securing La Liga became evident for the visiting team. The fans, sensing the imminent victory, started to celebrate, and the atmosphere was electric. On the pitch, Real Madrid continued to manage the game professionally, ensuring that they did not concede any last-minute opportunities to their opponents.\n\nIndeed, the last moments of the match were distinguished by Real Madrid's disciplined gameplay, holding onto possession, and breaking up any potential counterattacks from Malaga. Marcelo, known for his attacking prowess from the left-back position, combined with Cristiano and James to create a few more chances, but Kameni stood firm in the Malaga goal.\n\nThe final whistle eventually blew, marking the end of the game and the confirmation of Real Madrid as the 2016-2017 La Liga champions. It was a testament to their consistency and prowess over the season. The players, coaching staff, and traveling fans celebrated the culmination of their hard work and dedication, and the team lifted the league trophy amidst jubilant scenes at La Rosaleda.\n\nIn summary, Real Madrid's 2-0 win over Malaga was a display of tactical brilliance, unwavering focus, and clinical finishing. Cristiano Ronaldo‚Äôs early goal settled the nerves, and Benzema‚Äôs second-half strike secured a well-deserved victory that encapsulated their journey to the top of Spanish football. The professional approach, robust defense, and effective midfield control highlighted why Zidane‚Äôs team were worthy champions, capping off a memorable season with the league title."
