it gives me the feeling, at least in the plays from above,\n1:42 Comment: Ale playing as best he can,\n1:44 Comment: and one too, one and another and another,\n1:47 Comment: Kovacic kicking him,\n1:48 Comment: Now Kovacic goes, he gets in the way with a tremendous push.\n1:51 Comment: Red for Vared-Bell,\n1:54 Comment: because I was going to show him the first yellow card for that foul,\n1:56 Comment: because of that trip and then the push,\n1:59 Comment: I think that's what cost him,\n2:1 Comment: or the second yellow has directly sealed him\n2:3 Comment: the red one to Fernández de Dubord-Balán to Vared-Bell.\n2:6 Comment: Nacho is there trying to control him because...\n2:9 Comment: Let's watch the replay.\n2:10 Comment: Well, I think it's obviously not going to be rectified,\n2:14 Comment: neither this nor any of the referee's decisions on the field of play,\n2:17 Comment: and these kinds of conversations,\n2:19 Comment: that are reasonable,\n2:20 Comment: explainable in the sense of frustration,\n2:22 Comment: And he has a kick...\n2:24 Comment: The kick he gives her is seriously ugly.\n2:27 Comment: That's what yellow cardboard costs you,\n2:28 Comment: Fernández de Dubord-Balán was very clear about it,\n2:29 Comment: But then Vared-Bell's reaction to Jonathan Viera is push,\n2:32 Comment: because I already had the yellow one in my hand.\n2:34 Comment: I was wearing yellow because of the kick,\n2:36 Comment: and then the push,\n2:37 Comment: I think he's lost his mind.\n2:39 Comment: The truth is that if he even gets the red for the first kick,\n2:43 Comment: It's not strange either, because the ball is very far away,\n2:46 Comment: and it's an entrance from behind,\n2:48 Comment: It is true that not with too much violence,\n2:50 Comment: But it was going to cost him the yellow card,\n2:52 Comment: The reaction, notice, is to look where the ball is.\n2:54 Comment: It's a minimal yellow kick,\n2:56 Comment: and

rebound, he manages to get out as best he can,\n4:1 Comment: He receives a foul from Vicente Gómez,\n4:4 Comment: ball for Real Madrid.\n4:7 Comment: The game is going into Sergio Ramos' territory,

being in the right position,\n4:46 Comment: Morata complains again,\n4:49 Comment: At the junction of the palm gate it came out like a bullet.\n4:52 Comment: Well, now the first thing is that Isco moves a little to the right,\n4:55 Comment: logically.\n4:58 Comment: Well, be careful because Morata came a little from behind.\n5:0 Comment: But it also seems to me that Álvaro Morata is more advanced,\n5:3 Comment: It is true that less clear than the rest of his colleagues,\n5:6 Comment: But it seems that Morata was a little ahead at the time of Toni Kroos' hit.\n5:13 Comment: Well, he's going to be left with Cristiano Ronaldo at the top,\n5:16 Comment: and with Morata installed in the midfield.\n5:18 Comment: On the left, Isco a little more to the right,\n5:20 Comment: Well, it's 4-4-1, right?\n5:23 Comment: Mends that Zinedine Zidane has to do,\n5:25 Comment: because he doesn't have too many alternatives to maintain a team\n5:31 Comment: With nine field players and making it

Bale,\n5:40 Comment: so remember,\n5:42 Comment: that is to say, he is not usually a player...\n5:44 Comment: It is his first expulsion here in Spain.\n5:46 Comment: But also, Ricardo, it didn't seem like there was a prior attack,\n5:49 Comment: nor that there was any previous kick that we missed.\n5:52 Comment: You must have felt bad about how easily Jonathan Biela left.\n5:56 Comment:  OK

there.\n6:20 Comment: The assistant tells Quique Setién to calm down,\n6:23 Comment: calm down,\n6:24 Comment: and he has risen.\n6:25 Comment: The mood, obviously, at the Santiago Bernabéu is heating up.\n6:28 Comment: Right now Lucas Vázquez, Asensio,\n6:30 Comment: And so does James.\n6:31 Comment: I had thought it was from the bench,\n6:33 Comment: No, it was Quique Setién himself who had

Comment: Now it is less, impressive because Real Madrid has nine players.\n8:10 Comment: But they already have four in the center of the field.\n8:12 Comment: And in that play Michael Kovács went to press the solo\n8:15 Comment: And of course, if those who come from behind don't put pressure,\n8:17 Comment: In the end it was a bit of a meaningless race, frankly.\n8:22 Comment: Yes, Madrid has

Madrid's first subject now is possession,\n11:11 Comment: He has to find a way to get the ball out of Las Palmas,\n11:15 Comment: Because if Las Palmas continues to have so much possession,\n11:19

Comment: Yes, logically if Las Palmas maintains what it is doing,\n11:30 Comment: which means having the ball a lot,\n11:31 Comment: Madrid is going to have to work a lot without the ball,\n11:34 Comment: And for Madrid it is going to be much more difficult\n11:36 Comment: Trying a comeback that, frankly, is already difficult now.\n11:39 Comment: Long ball from Sergio Ramos, which Marcelo is already looking for,\n11:41 Comment: He let the ball pass to David Simón,\n11:43 Comment: And Marcelo can arrive, very closed,\n11:44 Comment: but he manages to arrive, he leaves,\n11:45 Comment:

Comment: We already know his talent as a forward,\n12:36 Comment: But football is there.\n12:41 Comment: Today is in addition to everything the master of time, right?\n12:44 Comment:  Yes Yes Yes.\n12:45 Comment:  Yes indeed.\n12:46 Comment: What kind of speed?\n12:47 Comment: When to counterpunch, when to hold on,\n12:49 Comment: Touch short, run with it.\n12:50 Comment: It's like Curro Romero, right?\n12:53 Comment: With the Tana heel.\n12:54 Comment: Tana for Vicente Gómez, this one for Roque Mesa,\n12:57 Comment: There's Jonathan Viera again with all the space in the world,\n12:59

jumped header, he won the ball again,\n13:16 Comment: The Canarian team, but Roque Mesa loses it\n13:18 Comment: and the side kick for Real Madrid.\n13:20 Comment: This is where Carvajal is looking for Isco.\n13:22 Comment: Attention to Isco's speed when we are watching that replay\n13:25 Comment: In Madrid trying to attack the Unión Deportiva Las Palmas field.\n13:28 Comment: We go to Gesé's

by going on the attack,\n13:58 Comment: He left a simple ball for a 1-1 fight between Marcelo and Prince Boateng.\n14:3 Comment: Prince Boateng won, he beat Keylor Navas,\n14:6 Comment: The 623 fans of the Pio Pio team celebrate.\n14:9 Comment: The 1-3 that the Santiago Bernabéu reflected in the 14th minute of the second half.\n14:15 Comment: Well, the ordogo Kelo Navas made a bet that he would arrive sooner.\n14:20 Comment: Yes, I believe that Navas... It is true that it is a ball that does stop\n14:24 Comment: He is going to face one-on-one with Boateng,\n14:26 Comment: which is also crowning a great game for me.\n14:28 Comment: He starts in his own field, offside.\n14:31 Comment: It's in the order now.\n14:33 Comment: Yes, I think he leaves with very few options to get there.\n14:37 Comment: You try to anticipate the problem but you can't.\n14:40 Comment: And it is true that the problem was going to exist because it was a mano a mano,\n14:43 Comment: But he had not clearly won the game against Marcelo.\n14:45 Comment: And he was beaten with a ball,\n14:47 Comment: because all of Madrid was in the Las Palmas Sports Union field.\n14:50 Comment: The offside situation couldn't even occur there.\n14:53 Comment: Well, what Madrid has in front of it is heroics multiplied by three.\n15:0 Comment: 1-3 and with 10.\n15:2 Comment: And against a team that plays really well.\n15:4 Comment: Exactly, also with a team that is beginning to handle itself in these types of situations\n15:7 Comment: with some comfort because he handles the ball, he keeps it\n15:10 Comment: And he also knows that Madrid is going to go almost, almost crazy to try to find adventure\n15:16 Comment: to approach Javi Nivaras' goal and therefore,\n15:20 Comment: He probably has room for a counterattack.\n15:22 Comment: Real Madrid has to be very determined in its approaches and come back.\n15:27 Comment: There's what control Isco just did, how wonderful.\n15:31 Comment: Alon for Real Madrid.\n15:33 Comment: He understands David Simón's lack.\n15:34 Comment: About this minute, on Sunday, I was trailing by two goals.\n15:39 Comment: Now I had time.\n15:41 Comment: There is Isco's career.\n15:43 Comment: The referee had signaled a foul

left leg.\n16:38 Comment: If Roque Mesa had given it at the first moment, it would have been better.\n16:42 Comment: But since he had not done so, on July 15, he held out until the opportunity had arisen.\n16:47 Comment: And it also forces Gesell to have to get on the left to hit because\n16:52 Comment: He looked for the screw but this time Keylor made the right save.\n16:56 Comment: He has played for David Simón.\n17:0 Comment: Prince Button.\n17:2 Comment: Gesell on Vicente Gómez.\n17:4 Comment: Roque Mesa.\n17:5 Comment: Roque Mesa for Jonathan Viera.\n17:7 Comment: Lucas Vázquez is

Comment: There they are looking for a long time to send Cristiano Ronaldo.\n17:51 Comment: Cristiano has fallen there.\n17:53 Comment: The referee says that there was nothing in the clash with the Castilian.\n17:55 Comment: Goal kick.\n17:58 Comment: Therefore, Quique Setién's team.\n18:2 Comment: Complaint from the ground Cristiano Ronaldo.\n18:7 Comment: The ball for Roque Mesa.\n18:9

    "summary": "In a thrilling encounter at the Santiago Bernabéu, Real Madrid played out a dramatic 3-3 draw against Unión Deportiva Las Palmas. The match saw moments of exceptional skill, controversial officiating, and relentless action, making it a memorable evening for football fans.\n\n### First Half\n\nThe game kicked off with Las Palmas taking the initiative. Early exchanges saw both teams trying to establish control. Javi Varas, the Las Palmas goalkeeper, had his first touch early, playing a cautious short pass to Vigas. Real Madrid’s Nacho cut out a long pass from Vigas intended for Carvajal, signalling Madrid's intent to press high and force errors. Real Madrid's aggressive pressing was evident as Isco and Gareth Bale continuously harassed the Las Palmas defense.\n\nA potential breakthrough came when Gareth Bale delivered a stunning ball into the box only for Morata, who put it into the net, to be flagged offside. This offside call was the first hint of frustration for Real Madrid, who continually found themselves thwarted by the referee’s decisions.\n\nBoth sides settled into a rhythm, with Real Madrid trying to probe the resilient Las Palmas defense. Roque Mesa and Jonathan Viera led Las Palmas' midfield, showcasing their side's quality in maintaining possession. The initial exchanges saw Las Palmas emphasize playing out from the back, using their centre-backs, Vigas and Lemos, to start attacks methodically.\n\nAs the half progressed, Gareth Bale was a constant threat down the wing, his pace leaving Castellano struggling. Bale's efforts were eventually rewarded. Isco, demonstrating his technical finesse, floated a delicate ball that made its way to Bale. He then sent a perfectly weighted pass to Isco, who, with minimal effort, placed the ball into the net. Real Madrid 1-0 Las Palmas.\n\nLas Palmas’ response was immediate. After the restart, they strung together a series of passes, displaying their hallmark style of possession football. A quick interchange between Viera, Boateng, and Tana saw Tana beat Sergio Ramos with a magnificent turn before unleashing a powerful shot which rocketed past Keylor Navas. The goal, which epitomized Las Palmas’ slick passing and clinical finishing, brought the score to 1-1.\n\nThe game’s momentum shifted back and forth, with both teams creating chances. Roque Mesa’s influential presence in midfield continued to feed the attackers with chances. For Real Madrid, Morata had numerous offsides called against him, adding to their frustrations. Each offside call stalled Madrid’s rhythm, though they continued to attack with fervor. Towards the end of the first half, Real Madrid nearly took the lead again when Bale's cross met with Morata's head, but Javi Varas managed to keep Las Palmas level.\n\n### Second Half\n\nThe second half began with Real Madrid’s manager Zidane introducing Luka Modric, strengthening the midfield to regain control of the game. However, moments of brilliance from Las Palmas continued to disrupt Madrid's ambitions.\n\nJavi Varas made a crucial save from a menacing attempt by Morata, keeping Las Palmas in the game. The dynamic of the game changed dramatically shortly after when Gareth Bale, following a cynical kick on Jonathan Viera and a subsequent push, was shown a red card. Down to ten men, Real Madrid faced an uphill battle.\n\nThis numerical disadvantage quickly proved costly. A counter-attack by Las Palmas saw the ball handled clumsily by Sergio Ramos in the box, leading to a penalty. Jonathan Viera stepped up and showcased nerves of steel, coolly chipping the ball into the net à la Panenka style, putting Las Palmas ahead 2-1.\n\nDespite being a man down, Real Madrid pushed forward in search of an equalizer. Marcelo’s relentless runs created openings, but it was Las Palmas who found the net again. A sweeping counter-attack saw Boateng exploit the space left by Madrid’s all-out attacking approach, rounding Keylor Navas to finish calmly and make it 3-1 in favor of Las Palmas.\n\nReal Madrid, renowned for their fighting spirit, did not relent. With time running out, Karim Benzema and James Rodriguez were brought on. Madrid’s offensive lineup included less defensive work, prioritizing attack over stability.\n\nThe Bernabéu crowd roared its approval when Cristiano Ronaldo converted a penalty given for a handball by Castellano. This goal brought Real Madrid within touching distance at 2-3, igniting hopes of a miraculous comeback.\n\nThe intensity of the final minutes was palpable. Cristiano Ronaldo, proving once again why he's one of the best players in the world, rose above the Las Palmas defense to head home an equalizer from a perfectly delivered corner by James Rodriguez, making it 3-3.\n\nThe final stages of the match were frantic, with both teams having opportunities to win it. Las Palmas' disciplined passing and positional play ensured they held onto the ball, trying to stymie Madrid’s advances. However, Real Madrid continued to attack, searching desperately for a late winner. The defensive contributions from both sides at the final minutes—particularly from Itami and Lemos for Las Palmas and Ramos’s leadership for Real Madrid—ensured that the score remained level.\n\nIn the end, despite Real Madrid's extraordinary effort to neutralize a two-goal deficit with 10 men, the game concluded in a high-energy 3-3 draw. Las Palmas left the Bernabéu with their heads held high, having earned a point in a hostile territory, while Real Madrid, although commendable in their fight back, were left to rue the loss of Bale and the early defensive lapses that forced them into a challenging situation. This match showcased the beauty and unpredictability of football, leaving fans on both sides breathless and craving for more."
