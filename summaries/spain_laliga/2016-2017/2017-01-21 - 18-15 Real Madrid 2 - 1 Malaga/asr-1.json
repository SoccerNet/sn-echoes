organized, but there was a lack of determination to try not to give the Málaga forward such a wide space to find that very dangerous shot.\n16:9 Comment: We are seeing it again.\n16:10 Comment: Excellent that reverse and subsequent shot by Gonzalo Castro, which did not find the goal.\n16:16 Comment: He collided with the post and on the rejected ball he was very close to even scoring into an empty goal or at least trying to rehearse the shot.\n16:24 Comment: Juan Piañor, in what has been Málaga's best opportunity so far, Málaga's best approach in these 16 minutes of the game.\n16:32

way he could cope with that situation.\n17:13 Comment: Rosales Center that puts it.\n17:14 Comment: First looking for the second suit.\n17:16 Comment: He will receive the chorri that can hit

Kroos.\n18:59 Comment: That he is everywhere and that it is very difficult for him to lose a ball.\n19:3 Comment: And he has also touched two in such an exquisite way that they produced the two clearest scoring chances for Real Madrid.\n19:10 Comment: Modric cross to the far post.\n19:12 Comment: And the advantage goes to Kameni.\n19:13 Comment: Because no one dressed in white appeared in that area near the goal to attempt the shot.\n19:20 Comment: We take the opportunity to dwell on that detail again.\n19:23 Comment: With that technical detail of Pablo Fornals.\n19:28 Comment: A movement of a kind almost more typical or more common in futsal than in football.\n19:36 Comment: But the proximity of the area produces a very interesting unbalancing effect.\n19:42 Comment: Very interesting.\n19:43 Comment: Ronaldo left the first.\n19:44 Comment: He touched back for Marcelo.\n19:45 Comment: This one even further back for Toni Kroos.\n19:53 Comment: Rafael Varane.\n19:54

Kameni.\n20:13 Comment: Football has moved.\n20:20 Comment: He comes out playing from behind in Malaga.\n20:23 Comment: He takes it calmly.\n20:27 Comment: In Real Madrid there is a contemplative point.\n20:30 Comment: We expected more aggressiveness when the ball came out.\n20:36 Comment: But only Benzema is here.\n20:38 Comment: Benzema.\n20:40 Comment: Pressuring Carlos Kameni.\n20:42 Comment: That he waited until the last moment to release that pass to the right.\n20:45 Comment: Peñaranda does not arrive.\n20:46 Comment: If Varane does it.\n20:47 Comment: Collect Fornals.\n20:47 Comment: That first opens for Gonzalo Castro.\n20:50 Comment: Once again entering from the left of Málaga.\n20:52 Comment: Follow the Chori.\n20:53 Comment: Chori puts it on.\n20:54 Comment: That he put his foot very, very, very below the ball.\n20:56 Comment: And consequently the ball went very, very, very high.\n20:59 Comment: It will be a goal kick for Keylor.\n21:2 Comment: He looked back.\n21:3 Comment: He looked towards the field as if he had stepped into a well.\n21:6 Comment: But the field doesn't look like it has any well.\n21:12 Comment: And the goal.\n21:13 Comment: But the field doesn't look like it has any well.\n21:13 Comment: Toni Kroos.\n21:16 Comment: To the center for Casemiro.\n21:17 Comment: Ramos and Kroos again.\n21:20 Comment: Marcelo receives.\n21:21

clash with Juanpi.\n21:32 Comment: Málaga has practically not protested it.\n21:35 Comment: With the ball already in play for Real Madrid.\n21:37 Comment: Modric opening.\n21:38 Comment: Prepare another Lucas center.\n21:40 Comment: Good cut.\n21:41 Comment: And Modric shooting zone.\n21:42 Comment: Modric stays locked up.\n21:43 Comment: He was attentive to correct.\n21:46 Comment: To cover Modric.\n21:47 Comment: José Luis Recio.\n21:48 Comment: Final center from Lucas.\n21:50 Comment: Caught by Kameni.\n21:51 Comment: He takes a short shot so that the Venezuelan Rosales can go up from the right.\n21:56 Comment: Another good center from Lucas.\n21:57 Comment: And this time from the bottom.\n21:59 Comment: From the background line.\n22:1 Comment: Which is where the centers have much more value.\n22:5 Comment: It seems to me that Madrid often abuses the center as an option.\n22:9 Comment: When it does not occur in an overflow situation.\n22:11 Comment: Malaga again.\n22:12 Comment: Chori Castro.\n22:13 Comment: Behind Marcelo's back.\n22:14 Comment: By the way, Ricardo fucks a lot.\n22:16 Comment: Yeah.\n22:17 Comment: I think it's a sandwich.\n22:18 Comment: The action

could.\n22:25 Comment: He covered the Málaga footballer.\n22:27 Comment: And now Ricardo the game is going to stop.\n22:29 Comment: Because Marcelo can't seem to continue.\n22:31 Comment: We'll see.\n22:31 Comment: Because he comes with difficulties on the bench.\n22:34 Comment: There is already movement.\n22:35 Comment: Let's see if someone warms up.\n22:36 Comment: But Marcelo's blow was as strong as if it were a sandwich.\n22:40 Comment: Which has caused concern on the bench.\n22:43 Comment: Toni was talking to Zinedine Zidane.\n22:45 Comment: And let's see if there is any man who warms up.\n22:48 Comment: Because Ricardo all this comes from the last action with Juanpi.\n22:52 Comment: In which the foul was called.\n22:53 Comment: It is that action in which harm is done.\n22:55 Comment: Apparently the Brazilian gets up quickly.\n22:58 Comment: And that is a blow.\n22:59 Comment: But I couldn't continue.\n23:0 Comment: Well, it can be seen from the top of the Isco tracksuit.\n23:4 Comment: So there is going to be change at Real Madrid.\n23:6 Comment: The man from Malaga is going to take the field.\n23:8 Comment: The former Málaga footballer.\n23:10 Comment: That I insist inside the bench.\n23:12 Comment: And without warming up he has already shown that number 23.\n23:15 Comment: Let's see if it is a gesture of speed.\n23:17 Comment: Or is it really Marcelo.\n23:19 Comment: No, no, it can't continue.\n23:20 Comment: Because he's already playing with the light.\n23:22 Comment: With the marker.\n23:23 Comment: To indicate that the Brazilian full-back cannot continue.\n23:26 Comment: The change will occur from one moment to the next.\n23:28 Comment: The blow was strong.\n23:30 Comment: It is a type of blow that leaves you very, very sore in Argentina.\n23:35 Comment: This is called paralysis.\n23:37 Comment: Because it leaves you practically without possibilities.\n23:40 Comment: Of doing the normal running movement of a footballer.\n23:45 Comment: Attention to Lucas.\n23:46 Comment: What oriented control from Lucas.\n23:47 Comment: Lucas Kameni.\n23:49 Comment: Carlos Kameni appears again.\n23:51 Comment: To cover the advance of Real Madrid.\n23:53 Comment: How well, how simple and how effective Lucas Vázquez did it.\n23:57 Comment: That's it, exactly.\n23:58 Comment: Isco is already there.\n24:0 Comment: Simplicity is a great value in football.\n24:4 Comment: Lucas is doing everything well.\n24:6 Comment: Isco is already there.\n24:7 Comment: Marcelo's back number above.\n24:9 Comment: That number 12 number.\n24:10 Comment: The referee or the fourth official thought that the ball was not in play.\n24:14 Comment: Yes, I was.\n24:15 Comment: So for now we have to wait.\n24:16 Comment: Marcelo enduring the pain as best he can.\n24:20 Comment: Isco is ready to relieve him.\n24:22 Comment: And for the area that has been left empty.\n24:24 Comment: In a way, Marcelo attacks Málaga.\n24:25 Comment: Camacho center looking for Peñalanda.\n24:27 Comment: That he was offside.\n24:28 Comment: And now Ricardo does.\n24:29 Comment: In this interruption comes the forced change at Real Madrid.\n24:33 Comment: That he limps more and more.\n24:34 Comment: Marcelo leaves.\n24:36 Comment: Applauded by the Santiago Bernabéu.\n24:37 Comment: One of the best in the Celta game.\n24:40 Comment: And Vigo is missing.\n24:41 Comment: Last Wednesday scoring the goal.\n24:43 Comment: He has to leave because of that blow.\n24:45 Comment: Let's see if it's a sandwich.\n24:46 Comment: Or if it's something else.\n24:47 Comment: The one who comes in his place is Isco.\n24:50 Comment: That against Granada he also had to leave for another sandwich.\n24:54 Comment: That has prevented him from being with his colleagues.\n24:57 Comment: Until last Wednesday.\n24:59 Comment: He warmed up, he didn't play.\n25:0 Comment: Today he could even have been a starter.\n25:2 Comment: And we are going to see the recomposition of Real Madrid.\n25:4 Comment: Which I think passes defense of three.\n25:5 Comment: Look at the image of Marcelo covering his face.\n25:9 Comment: We remain very attentive.\n25:10 Comment: From the diagnosis of medical reports.\n25:12 Comment: In everything to the state of Marcelo Vieira.\n25:15 Comment: A player who has already been highlighted in recent weeks.\n25:19 Comment: That he had played practically everything.\n25:20 Comment: That your load of matches.\n25:22 Comment: His load of minutes was higher than that of the rest of his teammates.\n25:26 Comment: And in that eventuality whether he could rest or not.\n25:29 Comment: Whether it could be dosed in some way or not.\n25:32 Comment: Well, this incident ends up occurring in the form of an injury.\n25:36 Comment: Which forced Marcelo to leave the game in the 25th minute.\n25:40 Comment: With what Benzema tried.\n25:41 Comment: With that deflected shot.\n25:43 Comment: Marcelo left.\n25:44 Comment: Isco took his place.\n25:46 Comment: And Isco's indication.\n25:47 Comment: As soon as you enter the field of play.\n25:50 Comment: It was obvious.\n25:51 Comment: You Lucas on the right side.\n25:52 Comment: Yeah.\n25:53 Comment: And Nacho who moves to the left side.\n25:56 Comment: Let's not rule out a muscle injury in Marcelo.\n26:1 Comment: That has nothing to do with the hit, I mean.\n26:4 Comment: Well, the reaction at first suggested that perhaps Marcelo himself.\n26:8 Comment: It is conscious.\n26:9 Comment: That the gravity is greater than that of a blow or a sandwich.\n26:12 Comment: Yeah.\n26:12 Comment: Let's not rule out a muscle tear.\n26:15 Comment: Which logically prevents you from continuing.\n26:20 Comment: Because it makes you impossible.\n26:21 Comment: And also because in the case of continuing a few more minutes.\n26:24 Comment: That injury gets worse.\n26:26 Comment: And the sooner the player changes, the better.\n26:31 Comment: Anyway in that case.\n26:32 Comment: I haven't seen Marcelo if he made a gesture.\n26:35 Comment: But no Real Madrid doctor.\n26:37 Comment: He has been able to.\n26:39 Comment: Look at Marcelo.\n26:42 Comment: Before making the change.\n26:44 Comment: The change is done practically on the fly.\n26:46 Comment: Without any doctor knowing if there may be a break.\n26:48 Comment: So if there is, it is because.\n26:50 Comment: In other words, if there has been a gesture, it is because Marcelo has not noticed it.\n26:52 Comment: Or it just stays put.\n26:54 Comment: We saw in the last image of Marcelo already on the bench.\n26:56 Comment: As he was surrounded by members of the Real Madrid medical staff.\n27:0 Comment: So we are waiting.\n27:2 Comment: Of the information that the white entity can make public.\n27:5 Comment: Regarding this incident.\n27:7 Comment: This physical problem that has left him out of the game.\n27:9 Comment: And that Marcelo Vieira has left out.\n27:11 Comment: Not one more player has left.\n27:13 Comment: Be careful, Madrid loses a resource.\n27:15 Comment: What he gives to his offensive game.\n27:18 Comment: A tremendous freshness.\n27:20 Comment: Not everyone enters either.\n27:22 Comment: Isco enters.\n27:22 Comment: Imaginative player.\n27:24 Comment: Very very technical player.\n27:25 Comment: You're going to have to connect immediately.\n27:29 Comment: With the party.\n27:31 Comment: Real Madrid has generated quite a few scoring chances.\n27:33 Comment: But the truth is that this continues 0 to 0.\n27:36 Comment: The fact is that Madrid is without its two starting full-backs.\n27:39 Comment: And at a difficult time of the season.\n27:42 Comment: For next Wednesday's game.\n27:45 Comment: In Valaio Santelcete.\n27:46 Comment: Where he is forced to come back.\n27:47 Comment: That's how it is.\n27:48 Comment: Juanpi.\n27:49 Comment: Back for Luis Muñoz.\n27:52 Comment: Mikel Villanueva receives.\n27:55 Comment: Pressured by Cristiano Ronaldo.\n27:57 Comment: Juan Carlos's inside ball.\n28:1 Comment: From first formalities.\n28:2 Comment: Clear Varane.\n28:3 Comment: The Benzema fight.\n28:4 Comment: But the advantage seems to go to Kameni.\n28:6 Comment: That takes it away.\n28:9 Comment: He sends it to the left.\n28:11 Comment: And he manages to combine with Juan Carlos.\n28:14 Comment: Mikel.\n28:15 Comment: The center back and Kameni hesitated.\n28:17 Comment: And in the doubt Benzema almost takes advantage.\n28:19 Comment: To the ground Camacho.\n28:21 Comment: There is a lack of Isco.\n28:22 Comment: By the way.\n28:23 Comment: Beyond the adjustment we mentioned.\n28:24 Comment: With Nacho coming to the left wing.\n28:26 Comment: With Lucas positioning himself as a right-back.\n28:28 Comment: It gives the impression that Real Madrid.\n28:29 Comment: It has a kind of rhombus in the center of the field.\n28:31 Comment: With Isco as midfielder.\n28:33 Comment: Letting Cristiano be forward again.\n28:35 Comment: In a more centered position next to Benzema.\n28:37 Comment: If that is.\n28:37 Comment: The two forwards are defined.\n28:39 Comment: Like free men.\n28:40 Comment: So to speak.\n28:42 Comment: Leave the band.\n28:44 Comment: Christian.\n28:45 Comment: And it is placed as the tip of the rhombus.\n28:47 Comment: Isco.\n28:48 Comment: By the way.\n28:49 Comment: The position that best suits you.\n28:50 Comment: We saw the image of Marcelo.\n28:53 Comment: Now more detailed in the repetition.\n28:54 Comment: The moment it falls.\n28:56 Comment: He's already looking for the bench.\n28:57 Comment: And the moment he sits down.\n28:58 Comment: He puts his shirt over his head.\n29:1 Comment: So.\n29:1 Comment: We are going to be very attentive.\n29:2 Comment: About what could happen with the Brazilian.\n29:4 Comment: Which is not the first time this season.\n29:6 Comment: Who already suffers a muscle injury.\n29:8 Comment: Mark played.\n29:9 Comment: From the corner.\n29:9 Comment: Juan Piañor.\n29:11 Comment: Launch of Juan Piañor.\n29:12 Comment: To the far post.\n29:13 Comment: He can't finish.\n29:15 Comment: The Malaga attacker.\n29:17 Comment: Ramos put his head in.\n29:19 Comment: Excellent.\n29:20 Comment: He can't believe it.\n29:21 Comment: Strong.\n29:21 Comment: That was behind Ramos' back.\n29:23 Comment: Waiting for a possible failure.\n29:24 Comment: The one from Camas.\n29:24 Comment: To top it off.\n29:25 Comment: Free from surveillance.\n29:26 Comment: Yeah.\n29:26 Comment: It was very timely.\n29:28 Comment: Ramos' touch.\n29:30 Comment: Because only the Málaga player arrived.\n29:32 Comment: In the second suit.\n29:33 Comment: Besides.\n29:33 Comment: Center.\n29:34 Comment: The corner.\n29:35 Comment: It came very strong.\n29:37 Comment: It came very well launched.\n29:38 Comment: To the point that Keylor.\n29:40 Comment: No.\n29:41

Comment: Camacho loves her.\n29:50 Comment: Recio loves her.\n29:51 Comment: Bleating to the far post.\n29:52 Comment: Camacho jumps with everything.\n29:53 Comment: He puts it at the far post.\n29:54 Comment: Close to the goal.\n29:58 Comment: Defended by Keylor.\n29:59 Comment: That shot from Ignacio Camacho left.\n30:2 Comment: Another good chance that is lost for Málaga.\n30:5 Comment: In the previous one, Keylor could not respond.\n30:8 Comment: Because it came very strong.\n30:9 Comment: And this time he couldn't respond.\n30:10 Comment: Because it was very rainy.\n30:13 Comment: But the truth is that through these set pieces.\n30:17 Comment: Málaga was close to the goal.\n30:22 Comment: Nacho.\n30:23 Comment: Delivery for Ronaldo.\n30:25 Comment: First class cross on Isco.\n30:27 Comment: That he hides it from Gonzalo Castro.\n30:33 Comment: Rafael Varane.\n30:35 Comment: Luke.\n30:36 Comment: Very good figure from Malaga.\n30:37 Comment: So far.\n30:38 Comment: The thing.\n30:40 Comment: Holding on.\n30:41 Comment: Letting go from time to time.\n30:42 Comment: To create danger.\n30:45 Comment: And when it is demanded defensively.\n30:47 Comment: He has responded effectively.\n30:49 Comment: Another front change from Cross.\n30:52 Comment: Directly at the foot of Lucas Vázquez.\n30:54 Comment: Which he quickly hands it over to Modric.\n30:59 Comment: Ramos.\n31:1 Comment: Toni Cross again.\n31:3 Comment: Progress to the left Nacho.\n31:4 Comment: That could put the center.\n31:6 Comment: Nacho puts it on.\n31:7 Comment: Hits the body.\n31:8 Comment: By Roberto Rosales.\n31:10 Comment: Corner kick for Real Madrid.\n31:12 Comment: We are seeing a good game.\n31:17 Comment: Live match.\n31:19 Comment: The two teams step into the area.\n31:21 Comment: There is back and forth.\n31:22 Comment: We have seen that last approach again.\n31:26 Comment: Precisely in a corner.\n31:27 Comment: By Ignacio Camacho.\n31:28 Comment: Try to replicate with an equal throw.\n31:30 Comment: The white box.\n31:31 Comment: Ball to the near post.\n31:32 Comment: It doesn't turn out well at all.\n31:33 Comment: Kameni.\n31:34 Comment: Although he manages to resolve the situation.\n31:36 Comment: Malaga's defense.\n31:37 Comment: Gonzalo Castro cleared.\n31:39 Comment: Juanpi.\n31:39 Comment: He lowered it against Modric.\n31:40 Comment: Try

the attacker.\n31:55 Comment: There is a lack of Peñaranda.\n31:56 Comment: Ball for Real Madrid.\n31:58 Comment: Peñaranda is an interesting player.\n32:0 Comment: Very young.\n32:1 Comment: I don't know if he reaches 20 years.\n32:4 Comment: Probably not.\n32:5 Comment: He is already 19 years old.\n32:6 Comment: Last year at Granada he showed us very interesting things.\n32:11 Comment: Powerful player.\n32:12 Comment: Skilled player.\n32:13 Comment: Very difficult to combine power and skill.\n32:16 Comment: Let's see how it matures.\n32:19 Comment: But we are facing a very interesting promise.\n32:23 Comment: The replay showed us that limit struggle between Recio and Sergio Ramos.\n32:27 Comment: In the last corner kick.\n32:30 Comment: We returned to live in this free kick that Toni Kroos had to repeat.\n32:33 Comment: The German midfielder for Real Madrid plays there.\n32:35 Comment: Modric is asking for it on the right.\n32:37 Comment: Luke.\n32:37 Comment: Ball behind Juan Carlos's back.\n32:39 Comment: Will Lucas arrive?\n32:39 Comment: No.\n32:40 Comment: Too long ball from Modric.\n32:43 Comment: It will be a goal kick for Carlos Kameni.\n32:45 Comment: And Juanpi is also showing interesting things.\n32:48 Comment: And also last season the player had growth that generated a lot of expectations.\n32:56 Comment: This year I get the feeling that with the rotations, with the change of coach, the player has been at a high point.\n33:5 Comment: One more confused point.\n33:6 Comment: But it has interesting things.\n33:9 Comment: Player who gives the sensation of a certain fragility.\n33:13 Comment: But he is very, very skilled.\n33:16 Comment: Which is fast.\n33:17 Comment: Very, very attractive player in the eyes of the good fan.\n33:22 Comment: It is also true that in recent seasons Málaga brings in new competitors from its lower categories summer after summer to play in those positions.\n33:31 Comment: I don't know where the machine for making half point and ends is hidden.\n33:35 Comment: But with the two masters, with Juanpi himself, with Ontiveros this season, with Fornals who still has a reserve team record and is currently occupying the top half.\n33:43 Comment: Plus those who are already on the team, such as Gonzalo Castro, Jonny, Keco.\n33:48 Comment: They have many players in that area.\n33:50 Comment: And they find opportunities, exactly.\n33:52 Comment: Direct launch by Recio.\n33:55 Comment: I was looking for the appearance, the jump of a teammate from inside the area.\n33:59 Comment: But Keylor Navas kept it.\n34:1 Comment: Recovery of Rosales.\n34:3 Comment: He was able to with the first one.\n34:4 Comment: Not with the second.\n34:5 Comment: With the broom Casemiro keeps it and quickly gives it to Isco.\n34:8 Comment: Isco combines with Ronaldo.\n34:10 Comment: Ronaldo facing Luis.\n34:11 Comment: Ronaldo throws the bicycle.\n34:12 Comment: It stops.\n34:13 Comment: Escape from three rivals.\n34:14 Comment: You have to go back.\n34:15 Comment: Combine with Casemiro.\n34:16 Comment: Quickly Casemiro.\n34:18 Comment: He changes everything so that Lucas advances to the right.\n34:21 Comment: The center was touched by a defender.\n34:22 Comment: He will try to avoid the corner.\n34:24 Comment: But Carlos Kameni does not succeed in a very strange action, Ricardo.\n34:28 Comment: Kameni confided.\n34:31 Comment: The boat had a strange effect.\n34:32 Comment: Let's see, let's see, let's see.\n34:33 Comment: Notice.\n34:34 Comment: He threw himself at the goal and finally hit the side of the net.\n34:37 Comment: It seemed like he had to come out from the baseline ten meters from the goal.\n34:41 Comment: and it ended up coming out two spans away.\n34:43 Comment: Yes, that's it, yes.\n34:44 Comment: Just sticking his tongue out at Kameni was missing the ball.\n34:48 Comment: A very lively touch came.\n34:50 Comment: Kroos launch.\n34:51 Comment: Ramos jumps.\n34:53 Comment: Goal.\n35:4 Comment: Real Madrid's goal in the 35th minute.\n35:7 Comment: Goal by Sergio Ramos.\n35:9 Comment: It is the usual formula with Kroos' precise launch.\n35:13 Comment: To the penalty spot.\n35:14 Comment: To the place where he knows the captain is going to appear.\n35:17 Comment: Ramos rises above everyone.\n35:19 Comment: That academically finishes the angle.\n35:22 Comment: It's Real Madrid's goal.\n35:23 Comment: Goal from Ramos.\n35:24 Comment: Real Madrid 1-0 Malaga.\n35:27 Comment: The problem solver.\n35:29 Comment: A real goal.\n35:30 Comment: He nails it in the corner.\n35:32 Comment: From very far away.\n35:33 Comment: Practically from the penalty spot.\n35:36 Comment: Maybe he jumps too much alone.\n35:38 Comment: And we already know the authority that Ramos has in the aerial game.\n35:44 Comment: The entire Bernabéu applauds the Real Madrid captain.\n35:48 Comment: Also surely signs of reparation for everything he has experienced in recent days.\n35:54 Comment: That gesture from Ramos here and with dedication.\n35:58 Comment: Or with dedication rather.\n36:0 Comment: Pulling up a sleeve.\n36:1 Comment: Pointing out one of his tattoos.\n36:3 Comment: If you are going to ask me who it is.\n36:4 Comment: I have no idea.\n36:5 Comment: Because with so many tattoos it is difficult to even see it.\n36:7 Comment: But it is Sergio Ramos's fifth goal this season.\n36:10 Comment: He had scored in Seville.\n36:12 Comment: With that penalty to Lopanenka.\n36:14 Comment: He had just scored an own goal in a goal that hurt him a lot.\n36:17 Comment: Not only him but also Real Madrid.\n36:19 Comment: Because it marked the beginning of Sevilla's comeback.\n36:21 Comment: Now dial again.\n36:23 Comment: But he does it in the opposite goal to make the score 1-0.\n36:27 Comment: Great goal.\n36:29 Comment: A relentless headbutt.\n36:30 Comment: The card is missing there.\n36:31 Comment: For Casemiro.\n36:34 Comment: For the Brazilian footballer from Real Madrid.\n36:37 Comment: Kroos was perceived.\n36:40 Comment: And not in the case of Casemiro.\n36:43 Comment: It is the third according to the notes I have in the League.\n36:46 Comment: The foul on Pablo Fornals.\n36:49 Comment: Gil Manzano who does not doubt it.\n36:51 Comment: And he shows the first yellow card of the game.\n36:54 Comment: Carlos Enrique Casemiro has bothered.\n36:57 Comment: Málaga will try to respond to a dead ball.\n37:0 Comment: The hard pitch again.\n37:2 Comment: It makes her Strong.\n37:3 Comment: Much shorter than in the previous action.\n37:6 Comment: Which also ends with a clearance by Real Madrid.\n37:10 Comment: Long delivery from Luis Muñoz.\n37:14 Comment: Juan Carlos cannot find out.\n37:17 Comment: It will be a throw-in for Real Madrid.\n37:20 Comment: Who just went ahead with that goal from Ramos.\n37:23 Comment: Kroos' shot from the corner.\n37:26 Comment: And impossible header for Kameni.\n37:29 Comment: At 1-0 at the Santiago Bernabéu.\n37:32 Comment: Real Madrid, with this result, would be clinching that title.\n37:37 Comment: That almost almost honorable status of winter champion.\n37:41 Comment: Which is true, they don't give you any drinks.\n37:43 Comment: It's not a title.\n37:45 Comment: In quotes, showing off that quality is worthless.\n37:48 Comment: But it is still the empirical demonstration that he has more points than the others.\n37:52 Comment: So at the end of the day it is something really interesting.\n37:56 Comment: And in the case of Real Madrid with one

system.\n38:29 Comment: And now.\n38:30 Comment: The tie in yellow cards is for Málaga with Juan Carlos.\n38:34 Comment: Yes, Juan Carlos measured very badly.\n38:36 Comment: And the blow was also strong.\n38:38 Comment: He hurt Luka.\n38:40 Comment: We come from the yellow card to Casemiro.\n38:44 Comment: And the referee balances things.\n38:47 Comment: Prepared to execute Toni Kroos.\n38:50 Comment: Ramos has risen again.\n38:52 Comment: Also Varane.\n38:53 Comment: He wants her in Casemiro.\n38:54 Comment: Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo.\n38:56 Comment: Ball served by Kroos for Ramos.\n38:58 Comment: No!\n38:59 Comment: Ramos's shot in action was deflected.\n39:1 Comment: Invalidated due to offside.\n39:3 Comment: Yes, the Real Madrid center back was offside.\n39:5 Comment: That he had found the hole again.\n39:7 Comment: The white captain who had found the ball.\n39:9 Comment: But his shot had still gone wide.\n39:11 Comment: The play was invalidated due to Ramos' illegal position.\n39:15 Comment: Well, not just Ramos.\n39:16 Comment: Because Málaga has once again thrown the offside line too far ahead.\n39:19 Comment: To the point of catching 4-5.\n39:21

Comment: We have seen Lucas regress from the right winger position to the right winger position.\n40:37 Comment: But that, Jorge, seems to have not diminished his prominence in attack one bit.\n40:42 Comment: Yes Yes.\n40:43 Comment: Furthermore, when Real Madrid starts the play, he is practically already installed as a winger.\n40:48 Comment: On the other hand, Nacho at least takes a little longer to occupy attacking positions.\n40:53 Comment: I understand that it is one of the benefits that Zinedine Zidane will see in this system that he has established.\n40:57 Comment: After the

see if it's the pain from the blow.\n41:25 Comment: There we see the repeated action.\n41:28 Comment: I think the two knees collide, too, and that...\n41:31 Comment: In no case is there a kick from Rosales.\n41:33 Comment: Beyond the fact that the foul exists because it hinders Nacho, but there is no intention to hit.\n41:38 Comment: It's not a kick, it's a knee-to-knee collision, which is tremendously painful.\n41:41 Comment: And the referee saw it very, very clearly from minute one.\n41:44 Comment: He was very on top too, eh?\n41:46 Comment: Well, he gets up limping in a lot of pain.\n41:48 Comment: The Real Madrid back is having a hard time walking, but at the moment the white team's doctors have not come in.\n41:54 Comment: The play will be executed with Kroos' free kick.\n41:57 Comment: Rosales, let's say, hits him with the hard part of his knee and more on the inner part.\n42:2 Comment: It has hurt him a lot.\n42:4 Comment: Good ball from Kroos, ball with Rosca

sole.\n42:36 Comment: He ended up finishing softly against a totally sold Cameri to score the second goal of the game.\n42:43 Comment: Doubles its advantage over Madrid, Ramos again. Real Madrid 2-0 Malaga.\n42:49 Comment: Well, this is a self-tribute from Sergio Ramos after a very, very tense week.\n42:58 Comment: It comes with the decision of a striker, it changes the trajectory of the ball.\n43:3 Comment: Nothing to do for Cameni. Indeed, the line this time betrayed Málaga.\n43:10 Comment: He solved many problems in this first half, but on this occasion he made it easier for Ramos to score the goal.\n43:17 Comment: Because we saw the replays, Jorge, and Ramos seemed to be enabled by Camacho.\n43:22 Comment: In that side shot, Camacho was the first Málaga player to protest.\n43:27 Comment: He resolved that circumstance, but it seemed that Ramos was running after Camacho.\n43:33 Comment: And that by beating the ball to the Málaga midfielder was what allowed the Real Madrid centre-back to finish with ease.\n43:40 Comment: Another from Ramos, Ricardo.\n43:41 Comment: Yes, and as soon as the ball went in, what the Camas center back did was look towards the linesman to see if he was pointing to the center of the field.\n43:47 Comment: He did it, so it's his sixth goal so far this season in the League.\n43:50 Comment: The second in today's match and the tribute, the repeated applause from the Bernabéu stands for their captain.\n43:57 Comment: During the entire celebration, what happened is that Nacho came to the band and was treated by the doctors.\n44:3 Comment: He continues hosting, but he is now back on the field of play.\n44:6 Comment: Isco, inside the area, Isco puts it in, he catches Kameni.\n44:10 Comment: Sometimes the goals don't explain the game and other times they do.\n44:14 Comment: Real Madrid did not have a very fluid game today. Both goals came from set pieces.\n44:20 Comment: This does not mean that he does not deserve the result, because he had much more offensive vitality than his...\n44:27 Comment: ...opponent, but with the ball in motion it was difficult for him to play a fluid game.\n44:32 Comment: And what did not arrive with a moving ball, arrived with a stopped ball.\n44:37 Comment: Both times through Sergio Ramos, whose figure grows more every day at Real Madrid.\n44:45 Comment: There is a man lying on the field of play, it is Camacho, the one who, after a play with Benzema, claimed the foul.\n44:52 Comment: Zenedine Zidane also claimed it for his team.\n44:55 Comment: At the same moment in which Benzema...\n44:57 Comment: ...let's improve the poster a million points.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: starting channels but it doesn't have the two full-backs on the left side either.\n0:4 Comment: He is not surprised either, he is not against if Danilo is there in the case of the right back\n0:8 Comment: I also get the feeling that Nacho is one of those who have resistance to pain.\n0:13 Comment: The second half started and it did so in a very difficult way because in the first action Juan finished\n0:19 Comment: hit the ground if in an action with a puck that apologizes he gets up he has also made a\n0:24 Comment: little damage, the Malaga footballer from Real Madrid also comes to protest loudly and tells him\n0:31 Comment: This is what the two of them are doing, or rather Isco ex of Málaga is currently strong in the ranks\n0:37 Comment: Of the Malaga team, those who later discussed this action are now the macho ones who become\n0:42 Comment: damage and the one who remains treated on the field of play after a blow to the head with\n0:45 Comment: juan car has collided with his own partner directly to the ground camacho they claim the\n0:50 Comment: input of assists while we take advantage of the break without losing\n0:54 Comment: of view of what happens to camacho to recover again that controversial incident that\n0:58 Comment: It is surely going to give us so much to talk about and thanks to these types of graphic tools we find it\n1:3 Comment: much easier to be able to resolve a slight forward position but the positions are not even\n1:12 Comment: light or scandalous or they are or are not offside and on this occasion we actually had\n1:18 Comment: to rectify and recognize that the Madrid player was slightly ahead, there we are\n1:24 Comment: Seeing that the bench begins to move, tremendous clash between Juan Carlos and Camacho\n1:30 Comment: tremendous morata kovács and asensio those who warm up on the wing for real madrid\n1:39 Comment: and right away I'll tell you who heats up the evil I'm seeing Johnny\n1:45 Comment: with my back turned, I will immediately confirm who the men who complete the band are.\n1:49 Comment: They exercise to be able to enter the second half.

it down Recio\n23:46 Comment: Fornals also did Casemiro\n23:48 Comment: Modric. Moments of instability for Real Madrid that Málaga is taking advantage of to grow in the game.\n23:56 Comment: Juanpi scored 2-1. Right after Chori Castro had it for 2-2.\n24:2 Comment: And now Gato Romero's team continues to play close to Keylor's goal.\n24:36 Comment: The goal against Real Madrid made him uneasy. He was managing the game with great solvency, with great calm, with long possessions.\n24:46 Comment: But the goal and the imminent threat of a tie that came within a minute of the goal made the team a little uneasy, although it seems that the minutes are beginning to restore calm.\n25:3 Comment: Kroos.\n25:6 Comment: Isco for Casemiro. Sending to Jonny's back. Lucas receives that he can center.\n25:13 Comment: There is Lucas's service or the service attempt because Jonny Rodríguez was quick to throw the ball out.\n25:28 Comment: He takes a career to presumably serve the long Lucas.\n25:34 Comment: Return of Isco that does not reach Lucas Vázquez.\n25:36 Comment: There's Jonny. The ball hasn't gone out. Yes, it has come out and it is for Málaga.\n25:42 Comment: Which takes away from that Casemiro. It doesn't matter if it reaches the right wing, it reaches the left wing, in the center of the middle of the field where one has to go look for the ball in the open sea.\n25:58 Comment: Always win. When the ball passes near him it is very difficult not to end up taking it.\n26:6 Comment: Jonny accompanies Juan Carlos. By the way, he foresees movement on the Málaga bench. Maybe Michael Santos is about to enter.\n26:14 Comment: Yes, he is prepared inside the bench. Now take that little step forward.\n26:19 Comment: The second modification in Gato Romero's painting that is already preparing for the second change.\n26:25 Comment: Let's see if in this player or not. It seems to me that he is going to have to wait even longer because Juan Carlos Labroto is going to put him in play.\n26:33 Comment: Fornals is offered. Also Peñaranda.\n26:36 Comment: Pablo Fornals appears. The Castellón native is first class. Modric puts his leg in.\n26:44 Comment: Throw-in for Real Madrid and the change still does not occur. Ricardo, now it's going.\n26:48 Comment: Now Málaga is asking for it. The replacement. Michael Santos, the Uruguayan who is going to enter the field of play. It stops Gato Romero.\n26:54 Comment: Yes, because there is a man on the ground.\n26:56 Comment: Yes, because Juan Carlos is in trouble again.\n26:57 Comment: Let's see if it is the previous action because at the moment Málaga's medical services enter the field of play.\n27:4 Comment: Number 7 of the set.\n27:6 Comment: The one from Andalusia.\n27:8 Comment: Notice Ricardo, it seems to me that they are calling another player.\n27:10 Comment: That the change is going to be made but it will not be for Michael Santos to come in but for Michellis.\n27:15 Comment: Yes, Michellis is going to come in. This is what he asks for and he has to modify the planting of Gato Romero on the fly.\n27:21 Comment: So the Argentine is going to re-debut with the Málaga shirt because yes, it's true, Juan Carlos cannot continue.\n27:29 Comment: The injury didn't seem like it was at an important moment. The previous blow did not seem important enough to endanger his presence.\n27:36 Comment: On the field of play and in the end it is. So second change on this occasion forced for Gato Romero's team.\n27:43 Comment: Michellis is going to enter.\n27:45 Comment: Quite a veteran from Spain where he did not find a place in Quique Sánchez Flores' team.\n27:52 Comment: Well, here Michellis returns to re-debut with the Málaga shirt.\n27:55 Comment: A stage in which, wearing the Bayern Munich shirt, he played in the Champions League final in 2010.\n28:1 Comment: We already have de Michellis back at Málaga.\n28:5 Comment: Just a couple of days after landing.\n28:6 Comment: Land on the Costa del Sol.\n28:8 Comment: Redebuting with the Boquerón team in the face of Juan Carlos's injury.\n28:14 Comment: Oops! That ball, don't tell me it goes in, don't tell me it goes in.\n28:17 Comment: Oh really! He saves her! Camini can see the line!\n28:19 Comment: Ronaldo tries it!\n28:22 Comment: The Camini cover!\n28:23 Comment: In what was about to become the comic action of the season.\n28:28 Comment: The transfer behind that Camini cannot control.\n28:32 Comment: The ball brushed, cushioned, slightly deflected.\n28:35 Comment: He starts crying towards the goal.\n28:38 Comment: And at the last moment, at the decisive moment, as Cartier-Bresson said,\n28:43 Comment: Carlos Idris Camini appears to kick it out with his foot and cover the subsequent one-on-one.\n28:49 Comment: Let it all be said that it was much more difficult.\n28:52 Comment: That's right, he gave it to Cristiano Ronaldo and it seemed like a good idea,\n28:56 Comment: because the ball did not go between the three sticks.\n29:0 Comment: Ball with Thread, the first post.\n29:2 Comment: The ball remains dead inside the area.\n29:4 Comment: They try to the right.\n29:5 Comment: Real Madrid tries to get it out.\n29:6 Comment: Modriiiiz shot.\n29:8 Comment: Touch of Ramos's body.\n29:10 Comment: Camini keeps it.\n29:12 Comment: Yes, there was offside, that's what the referee points out.\n29:15 Comment: Or that's what the assistant says, because the play continues.\n29:21 Comment: Back Toni Kroos.\n29:26 Comment: Keylor Navas keeps it.\n29:29 Comment: Yielding for Varane and this one for Lucas Vázquez.\n29:31 Comment: I'm still shocked, Jorge, by the last action of...\n29:35 Comment: From Camini, because one never expects that at this level...\n29:38 Comment: Those things happen.\n29:40 Comment: Those types of events occur.\n29:41 Comment: The first delivery to the goalkeeper was between the three posts, something that should never be done.\n29:45 Comment: And secondly it was very strong.\n29:47 Comment: In fact, he was about to sneak in.\n29:50 Comment: Ronaldo, Ronaldo, Ronaldo.\n29:52 Comment: To the stick.\n29:54 Comment: Look at the sky and think, not today, eh?\n29:57 Comment: Today they are not going inside.\n29:59 Comment: He had it again on the 7th, Ronaldo had it again.\n30:1 Comment: This time it wasn't Camini, but the post.\n30:3 Comment: Who prevented the goal.\n30:4 Comment: Goal!\n30:5 Comment: Cristiano's goal.\n30:6 Comment: This time he hit it very well.\n30:8 Comment: He hit him crosswise, he hit him very hard.\n30:10 Comment: And the ball...\n30:11 Comment: Be careful, Cristiano has hurt himself, eh?\n30:13 Comment: Do not tell me.\n30:14 Comment: Christian has been hurt.\n30:15 Comment: I don't know if the Portuguese from Real Madrid is limping when the action continues.\n30:19 Comment: But he tries to run, but he has problems, Real Madrid's number 7 has discomfort.\n30:25 Comment: Let's see if he looks at the bench or not.\n30:27 Comment: But at the moment he is clearly showing pain in his right foot.\n30:32 Comment: Match of fatalities for both teams.\n30:34 Comment: Marcelo left injured.\n30:36 Comment: Juan Carlos has also done it.\n30:38 Comment: And now problems for Ronaldo right after that very powerful shot that hit the post.\n30:42 Comment: Jonny.\n30:44 Comment: Jonny is shaping up.\n30:46 Comment: It will be, it will be, it will be a goal kick.\n30:48 Comment: The last one to play.\n30:49 Comment: The former Sporting footballer.\n30:50 Comment: You're close to Ronaldo, right Ricardo?\n30:52 Comment: Yes, and he's looking at the bench.\n30:53 Comment: He is doing something like the hitting gesture when shooting at goal.\n30:57 Comment: Could it have been hurt?\n30:59 Comment: Let's see how Zidane and the bench react.\n31:2 Comment: If it is time to preserve Cristiano.\n31:3 Comment: Or to keep him on the field of play.\n31:5 Comment: But the Real Madrid footballer continues to limp.\n31:8 Comment: Yes, he's even walking.\n31:10 Comment: He's even walking.\n31:11 Comment: And nothing is perceived in the set.\n31:13 Comment: No, nothing is perceived.\n31:14 Comment: He is walking with difficulties.\n31:16 Comment: But at no time has he looked at the bench asking for a substitution.\n31:19 Comment: And if Cristiano doesn't ask for it, I doubt Zidane will change him.\n31:25 Comment: Another thing is that at the moment of hitting and with the defender arriving a little late, he hit with the sole of the footballer's boot.\n31:32 Comment: The one who is going to enter is Kovacic.\n31:34 Comment: So let's see who leaves.\n31:36 Comment: It must be said that Villanueva moved to the right back position when Michelis came on.\n31:42 Comment: Nacho.

    "summary": "In a thrilling match held at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium, Real Madrid narrowly defeated Málaga with a scoreline of 2-1. This closely contested game featured moments of brilliance, frustration, and tactical duels that kept fans on the edge of their seats from start to finish.\n\nThe referee, Gil Manzano, signaled the start of the match, and immediately, the intensity was palpable. Real Madrid, anchored by Rafael Varane at the back, began on a strong note, setting the tempo. Early on in the match, Nacho Fernandez, deployed as a right-back, showcased his versatility with an opening forward play.\n\nHowever, Málaga was not to be overawed. Their pressing game was particularly noticeable, as Pablo Fornals closed down spaces aggressively. Carlos Enrique Casemiro had to drop to the ground to neutralize the pressure. Sergio Ramos, Real Madrid's ever-reliable captain, cleared the ball, which Málaga temporarily controlled before Real Madrid regained possession.\n\nThe early exchanges demonstrated the tactical dynamism of both teams. Luka Modric and Varane combined with Nacho, whose ball to Lucas Vázquez led to the first real chance of the match. Although Lucas lifted his head and attempted a center, Juan Carlos corrects his position just in time to prevent a goal-threatening opportunity. This would be a familiar pattern as both teams sought to outmaneuver each other.\n\nCristiano Ronaldo, bandaged hand and all from a training knock, attempted to assert his influence on the game from the left flank. Despite appearing hampered, his relentless efforts epitomized Real Madrid's attacking intent. Unfortunately, for Real Madrid, Benzema could not control a lofted pass from Marcelo, and Modric's wide deliveries to Vázquez often ended without a clear finish.\n\nMálaga's defensive resilience came into sharp focus. Carlos Kameni, their Cameroonian goalkeeper, had a particularly busy afternoon to ward off consistent raids from Real Madrid's attackers. His heroics from last season's draw at Bernabéu were not forgotten. Once again, Kameni was central to Málaga's defensive stoutness. His decisive actions affirmed his reputation as a keeper who rises to the occasion in high-profile matches.\n\nThe game's intensity saw players tangling on multiple occasions. One such encounter resulted in Marcelo getting the ball taken off him in a face-off with Rosales. Ramos, otherwise efficient in repelling Málaga's offenses, had an unfortunate head-to-head with Pablo Fornals. The balance of play continually shifted, with intermittent Málaga counterattacks finding Peñaranda and Chori Castro looking for an opening. \n\nAs minutes progressed, Real Madrid's Luka Modric and Kroos kept the tempo high, their intricate passes and combination play continuously probing Málaga's defense. Karim Benzema almost opened the scoring in the 10th minute with a header from Lucas' cross but missed from close range. Cristiano Ronaldo, too, had several shots on goal, yet none found the back of the net, his frustrations evident.\n\nA breakthrough, however, did come from set-piece situations, which are Real Madrid's forte. Toni Kroos' pinpoint corner kick in the 35th minute found Sergio Ramos, who rose majestically to head past Kameni and break the deadlock. Ramos, ecstatic, celebrated by pointing out one of his numerous tattoos, a personal tribute that underlined the emotional weight of the goal after his recent adversities.\n\nBarely a few minutes later, Real Madrid doubled their advantage. Another well-delivered Kroos free-kick saw Ramos, unmarked in the small area, coolly slotting the ball home. Kameni, having been brilliant thus far, was left helpless. Málaga's defensive line faulted, allowing the Real Madrid captain to score his second of the game, his sixth of the season and a statistical high in his career. This brace would once again underscore Ramos's role as a vital scorer for his team.\n\nThe first half saw Marcelo leave the pitch injured in the 25th minute, an incident that necessitated Isco coming on. The reshuffling saw Lucas move to right-back and Nacho to the left, providing less fluidity on the wings but maintaining Real Madrid's formation.\n\nEntering the second half, Málaga came out determined to change the scoreline. An early clash saw Juan Camacho hit the ground after colliding with Juan Carlos, signaling the chaotic and aggressive nature Málaga adopted in chasing the game. Real Madrid sustained their attacks, and Ronaldo, despite appearing injured, continued pressing. Yet, it was Málaga who found the net next. Juanpi latched onto a loose ball following a scramble, slotting home to bring Málaga back into the game.\n\nThe match dramatically opened up. Despite Real Madrid's possession and composed play, Málaga frequently threatened on counterattacks. Michael Santos and Jonny replaced Peñaranda and Chori Castro, seeking to inject fresh legs into the fray. Kameni, once again, was a last line of heroic defending, preventing real chances, including a pair of Cristiano headers, from adding to Real Madrid's tally.\n\nWhen the dust settled on 90 minutes, the Santiago Bernabéu had witnessed a display both enthralling and nerve-wracking. Real Madrid clinched the win, but not without having faced a spirited Málaga side that tested their resolve until the final whistle. Ronaldo's luckless endeavors and Ramos' brace provided a storyline of contrasting fortunes. Real Madrid's reliance on set-pieces highlighted both their strength and the areas still under construction in their gameplay.\n\nUltimately, this game was a testament to the spectacle that is La Liga, where tenacity, individual brilliance, and tactical prowess combine to create football memories. Sergio Ramos' captaincy shone through, leading by example and ensuring Real Madrid's position atop the league was secure, if just for another week."
