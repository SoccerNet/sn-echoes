    "summary": "In a pulsating encounter at the Estadio Benito Villamarín, Real Madrid delivered a masterclass performance, obliterating Real Betis 6-1 in a La Liga contest that will be remembered for its sheer brilliance and dramatic moments. The first half set the tone with an early goal, and the second half proved to be a continuation of Real Madrid's dominance, sprinkled with a momentary hope for Betis. Here's a detailed play-by-play recount of how the action unfolded.\n\nThe match kicked off with Betis taking the first touch at the center spot, commanding the early few seconds of the game. However, it took little time for the ball to go out of play, and at the 32-second mark, Real Madrid had their first throw-in of the match. The ball did not remain in play for long, as another throw-in was awarded to them following a brief moment of in-game activity. Betis challenged fiercely, resulting in the first foul at the 1:58 mark, quickly leading to an indirect free-kick for Real Madrid.\n\nWithin a handful of minutes, Betis’s aggressive defensive stance led to another foul, granting Real Madrid a chance for a direct free-kick. Capitalizing on this opportunity, Los Blancos executed a seamless play, and at just 3:09 into the match, managed to slot in the opening goal. The synergy and sharpness of the Madrid players were evident, leaving Betis scrambling to regroup right from the restart at 3:49.\n\nBetis tried to claw back into the match, but errors kept creeping into their game. Real Madrid on the other side seized every opportunity that came their way. A few throw-ins and passes marked the next few minutes until a Real Madrid player took a bold shot, narrowly missing the goal at 5:53.\n\nTen minutes into the game, Real Madrid's unyielding pressure induced panic within the Betis defense. A corner kick at 10:24 showed their intent, though the resultant shot went off target. Minutes later, another corner at the 12th minute brought similar results, the ball flying harmlessly away. Yet, Real Madrid’s persistence bore fruit frequently. Every movement showcased their formidability. A shot at the 13:47 mark was parried away, resulting in another corner at 14:15, but again, failing to convert.\n\nA significant spell of stoppages and throw-ins followed, reflecting Betis's desire to break Real Madrid's rhythm. However, the incessant fouls from Betis handed Real Madrid several chances to dominate the ball through indirect free-kicks. It was during one of these ensuing plays that Real Madrid's attacking prowess proved to be unstoppable again. At the 30:55 mark, a beautiful play culminated in another goal, establishing a 2-0 lead for the visitors.\n\nUnperturbed and continuing their high-octane play, Real Madrid struck once more before halftime. Following a corner kick, a well-aimed shot that was initially blocked saw another Real Madrid player pounce on the rebound, sending the ball into the net at 38:54, making the scoreline 3-0.\n\nBetis was in dire straits and desperately seeking a way to respond. They finally saw a sliver of hope when a fast break down the wing resulted in a well-placed ball at the edge of the penalty area. Striking with intent, Betis managed to hit a terrific shot on target, but it went straight into the back of their own net due to an unfortunate deflection, ending the half miraculously at 4-0 in favor of Real Madrid.\n\nThe second half started with Betis making immediate changes, substituting two players in hopes of turning the tide. Real Madrid kicked off the half and stayed aggressive. A foul within six seconds by Betis was indicative of their hastened, perhaps reckless, eagerness to apply pressure. Another indirect free-kick for Real Madrid ensued.\n\nThe match intensity did not wane, as Real Madrid attempted another shot off-target within the first two minutes. However, Betis briefly found their bearings. In the 9th minute into the half, a fast-paced counterattack saw Betis striking back with a precise shot on target, finally scoring and giving their fans something to cheer about. The home side’s spirit was temporarily buoyed, making it 4-1 in the 54th minute of play.\n\nStill, Real Madrid, focused and relentless, reinstated their dominance. A rapid counter after Betis's goal brought another brilliant chance, and in the 62th minute, yet again, Real Madrid’s fluid play saw them net another goal, comfortably sitting at 5-1. This flurry of goals did not cease to excite, as Real Madrid controlled proceedings, stringing passes and creating opportunities at regular intervals.\n\nBack-to-back changes by both teams saw fresh legs on the field but did little to alter the game's flow. Betis, struggling to maintain possession, committed another foul, their fifth yellow card of the match being issued as a result. An indirect free-kick followed, leading to Real Madrid's final blow. At the 78th minute, another skillful play saw a crisp on-target shot, clinching the game beyond any reasonable comeback with a final and resounding score of 6-1.\n\nThe rest of the match saw minor attempts from both sides. Betis made some sporadic runs, hoping to breach Madrid’s defense, but their efforts either went off target or were comfortably dealt with. Complimenting their destruction, Real Madrid continued showing their class by attempting and oftentimes narrowly missing further adding to their tally.\n\nThe match wrapped up uneventfully, with mere formalities playing out the remainder of the game. Real Madrid solidified their position in grand fashion, the final scoreline reading a remarkable 6-1, an emphatic statement reflecting their superiority on the night. It showcased technical brilliance, tactical acumen, and an undeniable hunger for dominance, leaving a lasting imprint on the fixture and a memory for the spectators to cherish."
