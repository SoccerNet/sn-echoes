think Kovacic was very, very good.\n19:18 Comment: Well, interesting to see what Real Madrid is going to do now, eh?\n19:22 Comment: In terms of position I mean.\n19:25 Comment: Because I think the BBC is going to continue being the BBC, that is, they are going to continue playing at the top.\n19:29 Comment: It's Kroos, Isco and Vázquez.\n19:32 Comment: And Vázquez is going to take him away from the band, something that is not usual to take Lucas Vázquez away from the band, but he is going to test him there, inside.\n19:38 Comment: Kroos stays where he plays and ahead it seems that there is a double connection between Isco and Lucas Vázquez.\n19:48 Comment: There they are talking right now between the three of them to see how they define those positions.\n19:52 Comment: Of course it is a test, let's see, it is not common to see Lucas Vázquez there.\n19:56 Comment: Well, obviously if what you're looking for is energy, agitate there in the middle, Lucas Vázquez always has plenty of energy, both to attack and to steal.\n20:5 Comment: I think we saw everything in that second half, not a Real Madrid.\n20:8 Comment: He has lowered the revs and noticeably in the center of the field.\n20:12 Comment: Well, if revolutions are needed, then Lucas Vázquez is there.\n20:17 Comment: There goes the top, right?

Jonas has played, Jonas for Rubén Castro, Jonas Marten again.\n20:55 Comment: He delivers the ball towards the sideline for Durmisi, he has Sozzulia on his side.\n20:59 Comment: Joaquín plays, Joaquín

Comment: He will surely be delighted with this goal, even though it is one of six.\n33:25 Comment: I think they have needed him because he is a bit erratic because of what Cristiano Ronaldo is.\n33:31 Comment: It wasn't first class, by the way, Morata's was even better.\n33:34 Comment: It was control and step backwards, even better.\n33:37 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo is unappealable this time, and he takes a weight off his shoulders.\n33:41 Comment: You already know that your personal demands are usually disproportionate.\n33:46 Comment: And he wasn't going to like having missed opportunities in front of the opponent's goal.\n33:52 Comment: This time he resolved it that way, scoring the sixth.\n33:57 Comment: Gareth Bale is leaving, Ricardo.\n33:58 Comment: Rest for Real Madrid's galer

    "summary": "Real Betis hosted Real Madrid in a highly anticipated clash at the Benito Villamarín Stadium, which saw the visiting team deliver a masterclass of football, demolishing their hosts with a 6-1 scoreline. The match, filled with thrilling moments and exceptional displays of skill, was largely dominated by Real Madrid from start to finish.\n\nThe game kicked off with Real Madrid immediately setting the tempo. Within the first few minutes, the intensity was palpable as both teams fought to gain early control. Real Madrid’s pressing bore fruit as early as the third minute when a beautifully executed set-piece led to the match's first goal. Rafael Varane rose majestically to meet a cross with his head, leaving Betis goalkeeper Antonio Adán helpless. This early setback for Betis set the tone for the match and silenced the home crowd.\n\nBetis attempted to respond but struggled to break Real Madrid’s solid defensive structure. Marcelo, despite being positioned as a left-back, played a pivotal role in advancing Real Madrid's attacks. His constant overlaps and smart passing facilitated numerous opportunities for his teammates. Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale, in particular, were direct beneficiaries of Marcelo's offensive prowess.\n\nIn the 31st minute, Real Madrid doubled their lead through Karim Benzema. The French striker showcased his finesse and intelligence as Toni Kroos won the ball and slipped it to him. Benzema calmly placed the ball beyond Adán, encapsulating the quality that Real Madrid had infused in their forward play.\n\nAs the first half progressed, Real Madrid continued to exert pressure. Isco deployed his dribbling prowess to unsettle the Betis defenders repeatedly. One of such moves precipitated a goal-scoring opportunity in the 39th minute. Isco and Benzema combined with intricate passes, leading to Benzema threading a ball through to Marcelo. The Brazilian did not disappoint, sending the ball into the back of the net to make it 3-0. The goal was debated for potential offside, but eventually, it stood, further sinking Betis' morale.\n\nBetis, on their part, had fleeting moments where they looked like breaking through, especially through Joaquin and Piccini. Joaquin, despite his age, was by far Betis' best player in creating and dictating the tempo whenever his team had possession. His intricate play helped Betis to maintain some hope, though their chances were few and far between. The first half ended with Real Madrid holding a commanding 3-0 lead.\n\nThe second half resumed with Real Betis hoping to reclaim some pride. A more spirited Betis emerged from the tunnel, and they began to string together meaningful passes and exert pressure on the Real Madrid defense. Their efforts bore fruit in the 55th minute when Álvaro Cejudo pounced on a loose ball to score Betis' only goal of the game. The hosts celebrated the goal with vigor, providing a brief respite from the onslaught they had endured.\n\nHowever, the goal only served to reinvigorate Real Madrid. The visitors maintained their dominance, controlling possession, and looking for openings in Betis' defensive lines. In the 62nd minute, Isco scored his second and Real Madrid’s fourth with a magnificent strike. The ball curved gracefully into the top corner, well beyond Adán's reach, illustrating why Isco remains one of the most creative forces in Madrid's midfield.\n\nReal Madrid’s clinical finishing continued. With considerable fluidity in their gameplay, they added another goal in the 78th minute through Cristiano Ronaldo. The Portuguese star had earlier missed several clear-cut opportunities but finally seized his moment, latching onto a pass from Álvaro Morata to convert from close range.\n\nBy now, Betis were reeling, unable to cope with Real Madrid’s relentless offensive. The 80th minute saw Gareth Bale subbed off to make way for Marco Asensio, showcasing the depth Real Madrid had on their bench. Asensio seamlessly slotted into the attacking lineup, continuing the onslaught.\n\nReal Madrid wrapped up their goal-scoring fiesta with the sixth and final goal coming in the 88th minute. Lucas Vázquez, who had come on as a substitute, played a crucial role in setting up the goal. After a fantastic interplay with his teammates, he crossed the ball into the box where Cristiano Ronaldo was waiting. Despite the tight marking, Ronaldo managed to direct the ball into the net, capping off a remarkable performance by the visiting team.\n\nThroughout the match, Real Betis showed glimpses of potential, especially through the endeavors of Joaquin and Ruben Castro, but they were outplayed and outclassed by a Real Madrid side that appeared determined to send a strong message. The defensive solidity provided by Pepe and Varane, combined with the attacking prowess of their forwards, was simply too overwhelming for the Betis outfit.\n\nThe game's closing stages saw Real Madrid comfortably managing their lead, with their midfield maestro Kroos dictating the pace. Whenever Betis managed to forge an attack, it was quickly snuffed out by Real Madrid's well-organized defense. The final whistle brought relief for Betis while Real Madrid celebrated an emphatic victory.\n\nIn conclusion, Real Madrid's 6-1 victory over Real Betis was a display of exceptional footballing prowess. The visitors showcased their offensive abilities with flair and precision, leaving Betis with little room to maneuver. Goals from Varane, Benzema, Marcelo, Isco, and Ronaldo highlighted the depth and quality within the Madrid squad. For Betis, the lone consolation goal by Cejudo served as a small testament to their resilience but was not enough to overshadow Real Madrid's sheer dominance on the night."
