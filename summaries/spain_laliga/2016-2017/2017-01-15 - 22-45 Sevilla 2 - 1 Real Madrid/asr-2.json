Carvajal leaves for Cristiano, Cristiano to the back line,\n9:56 Comment: Cristiano can put it, Sergio Rico touched, Sevilla is still complicated, Sergio Rico shot,\n10:2 Comment: On the way back, Cristiano stopped. The latest release from the Portuguese, Sergio Rico in two beats.\n10:9 Comment: They can Carvajal in the play, when the play is born it is again Carvajal who can do damage there.\n10:15 Comment: Sergio Rico plays first there, the two Sevilla players get involved when it comes to clearing between Ramiro and Borra,\n10:20 Comment: and Cristiano Ronaldo takes advantage again, but Sergio Rico hits and saves the Portuguese's shot.\n10:30 Comment: Ball for Sevilla who plays in the midfield, plays and erases, opens and erases the Vitolo band,\n10:36 Comment: The mute tries to approach there, plays again for and erases, and erases for Enzonzi, Enzonzi plays on Scudero,\n10:45 Comment: accompanies the ball to the mute, go down, Nari's offside, and I think the assistant is right,\n10:49 Comment: Although I wrote it to him at the San Paoli, I get the feeling that Nari is ahead of his position in the Real Madrid defense.\n10:59 Comment: There it is, right at the moment of touch, Nari seems slightly ahead.\n11:6 Comment: The ball for Zinedine Zidane's team.\n11:10 Comment: You may, I believe, Michael, who are right now aware of the moment of the match,\n11:15 Comment: because they are starting to reserve themselves, they are not starting to say, I'm not so good, I don't take everyone, I don't risk so much.\n11:21 Comment: But don't make mistakes, that's the key too.\n11:23 Comment: In any case, I think Sevilla were a little more aggressive than in the first half.\n11:26 Comment: And Sevilla, indeed, is going further up.\n11:28 Comment: There's Vitolo, putting pressure on Ram, on Barahán, who was arming him, he just took a second too long.\n11:35 Comment: And Sevilla, Ricardo, and the stadium in flames for the San Paoli team.\n11:38 Comment: With that high pressure, high now from Sevilla, for that recovery of the ball and the public that appreciates it.\n11:44 Comment: It still goes wrong, of course, but they are taking more risk than Sevilla did in the first half, a little more.\n11:49 Comment: The ball goes to the San Paoli team, there is Almudo throwing a shot that does not work against Nacho, who holds on, now Vázquez needs Marcelo.\n11:58 Comment: And in reality he gives him the start with that action, because Real Madrid will have the opportunity to serve without problems.\n12:4 Comment: And he is already placing Almudo Vázquez as a false nine.\n12:10 Comment: And Benyeda, more to the side.\n12:14 Comment: Yes, here on the right, Benyeder.\n12:15 Comment: We have seen Benyeder's action and he seemed reasonably in line with the Real Madrid right wing defender.\n12:23 Comment: In that last attack that left Benyeder one-on-one against... against Keylor Navas.\n12:28 Comment: Real Madrid took a shot that is going to go directly out without Cristiano Ronaldo reaching the top.\n12:33 Comment: Now it is Madrid that is trying to put pressure on Sevilla, Nico Pareja quickly knows it and served quickly.\n12:38 Comment: But Madrid builds its attack, the ball does not reach Luka Modric.\n12:41 Comment: Escudero appears under pressure from Carvajal and Benzema in Sonsi.\n12:46 Comment: He triangles for Sevilla, plays the ball over Escudero who cuts in front of Carvajal.\n12:50 Comment: The ball goes to Nari, Nari players attract it, Escudero plays it.\n12:53 Comment: The ball belongs to Vitolo, Real Madrid recovers, Luka Modric touched it.\n12:56 Comment: Dinamitano Cristiano's team tries to get out quickly.\n13:0 Comment: The central circle.\n13:1 Comment: San Paulo has definitely changed and Paz is now playing at the top.\n13:6 Comment: He will have Nasly and Benyeder accompanying him on the flanks.\n13:9 Comment: Play with one less in the center of the field and Sevilla gains a forward.\n13:13 Comment: There Carvajal goes with everything with a self-pass, he manages to surpass everyone except Ramí who cut him off.\n13:19 Comment: The dologosis crashed, it seems that Carvajal has been hurt but Sevilla continues with the ball.\n13:22 Comment: He hides it in Sonsi, cuts it to Casemiro, plays the ball short, continues in Sonsi who can do it, who can do it all.\n13:30 Comment: Sevilla is playing there, opening towards the wing for Mariano.\n13:33 Comment: Benyeder offers himself on the side, Benyeder quickly this time, gives a touch to play it on Mariano who arrives.\n13:38 Comment: Sergio Ramos' coverage arrives and he wins in that position.\n13:41 Comment: The attacker will take Sevilla out of bounds.\n13:45 Comment: Now yes, there is a slightly more logical version of Sevilla.\n13:49 Comment: Yes, I love it more.\n13:50 Comment: Yes, more so than what Sevilla has been.\n13:52 Comment: He is going to get the ball out to Sevilla from Mariano's side.\n13:57 Comment: Playing towards Ensonsi, Sergio Ramos arrived, he manages to anticipate.\n14:1 Comment: Sergio comes out of the cave, delivers for Carvajal, tries to mount the counter.\n14:5 Comment: How nice what Karim Benzema has just done.\n14:8 Comment: Sergio Ramos continues in the middle, 3 for 3.\n14:10 Comment: Karim Benzema brings the opponent, he plays for Sergio, Sergio leaves the ball behind, Rami took it.\n14:17 Comment: Rami took the ball against the combined attack of Karim Benzema and Sergio Ramos.\n14:22 Comment: It seems that a certain Ricardo has been hurt.\n14:24 Comment: Squire.\n14:26 Comment: It seems that the Sevilla player, Carlos Caimado, has hurt himself quickly to the referee.\n14:31 Comment: Yes, the Sevilla player is lying in the area, with problems,\n14:36 Comment: taking an interest in the referee to see if he can recover.\n14:41 Comment: The public takes it again with Sergio Ramos.\n14:43 Comment: We see there the moment in which damage may have been done with the collision with Karim Benzema.\n14:47 Comment: He tried to react with courage after the collision with the Frenchman.\n14:51 Comment: There Rami won the game against Sergio Ramos.\n14:55 Comment: It seems that he has already recovered.\n14:58 Comment: Momentarily Mariano, no, it seems that there is alarm on the Sevilla bench.\n15:2 Comment: Real Madrid Cristiano Ronaldo plays the ball.\n15:4 Comment: Cristiano in midfield playing the ball for Luka Modric.\n15:8 Comment: The band opens for Carvajal who is gaining weight in attack.\n15:11 Comment: There goes the delivery, far post, Sergio Rico rises, winning that ball in his area.\n15:16 Comment: Sevilla is taken short, Mariano accepts the challenge against Marcelo.\n15:21 Comment: Opening for Benzeder, Toni Kroos helps in defense, he gets the ball quickly for Mariano.\n15:26 Comment: The pass is a problem.\n15:28 Comment: It's a problem.\n15:29 Comment: There he erases, Benzeder plays, all of Real Madrid puts pressure on him with Toni Kroos and Karim Benzema.\n15:34 Comment: The winning head of the ball for Real Madrid Cristiano Karim Benzema stands out.\n15:36 Comment: Cristiano's pass is wrong, Karim Benzema was in the goal area, Rami cut the ball.\n15:44 Comment: Double gift, Sevilla gave the ball to Ronaldo and Ronaldo to Sevilla.\n15:50 Comment: There is Benzeder, there is beginning to be a lot of territory for individual failure and for the game to become unbalanced from there.\n15:56 Comment: Sergio Rico takes the ball on the sideline, Carvajal presses again, Luka Modric appears, Sevilla manages to win it.\n16:3 Comment: Every ball is now a guerrilla, it is now an ambush.\n16:6 Comment: Loose ball that Iborra wins, Iborra takes the ball to the Real Madrid field that the ball has just put inside.\n16:11 Comment: The control is too long, Mudo Vázquez appears.\n16:14 Comment: There was a lack of a squire here, I didn't see it.\n16:17 Comment: Lack of squire, the referee did see it, he saw it clearly and blew his whistle.\n16:22 Comment: He thinks he spoils Sergio Ramos.\n16:29 Comment: There is the clash with the referee very close, the team's foul is called, the ball goes to Real Madrid.\n16:35 Comment: The game begins to be at the peak of someone's mistake.\n16:40 Comment: Yes, yes, yes, there are sometimes sections in the game, logically the calesancio, the tension, gets out of control.\n16:45 Comment: It is a match of such great accumulated tension that they are beginning to notice it.\n16:48 Comment: And that logically has to be resolved by the starters with some change.\n16:52 Comment: Real Madrid is going to take it for the long haul, currently anticipated by the San Paolo team and through Iborra it is held by Sergio Ramos.\n16:59 Comment: Pressured by Marri, looking for the diagonal, always looking for Carvajal.\n17:4 Comment: He rises to take it with a header, squire, side kick practically only to divide.\n17:8 Comment: He will take out Real Madrid.\n17:10 Comment: I see Benítez with his minutes already counted.\n17:13 Comment: I do too, maybe because of Jovetis or Vieto, but probably more because of Jovetis.\n17:17 Comment: Jovetis who had a debut in extraordinary minutes against Real Madrid.\n17:22 Comment: Not all of them mark their debut and also a bit of beautiful workmanship.\n17:25 Comment: Pesa volley that he hunted.\n17:26 Comment: Jovetis, Sarabia and Mercado are the players who are warming up for Sevilla-Granada.\n17:30 Comment: Toni Kroos cut the ball, but he is slow to get it out now.\n17:34 Comment: Nico Pareja lost it, attention that Luka Modric arrives, opportunity for Real Madrid.\n17:37 Comment: I made the ball for Benzema, Benzema didn't arrive, yes, now he does.\n17:40 Comment: Loose ball, gets his leg into Sonsi, up.\n17:43 Comment: The clearest chance of the game.\n17:47 Comment: Karim Benzema finds the ball on a volley with his body leaning back.\n17:51 Comment: He hits with his right leg, he had plenty of power and lacked precision.\n17:56 Comment: He went over Sergio Rico's door.\n17:59 Comment: But it comes from a gift from Nico Pareja and is tilted backwards.\n18:7 Comment: There, leaning back and sending it through the roof.\n18:10 Comment: It's body language, wrong.\n18:14 Comment: Mariano clears it, not very forceful against Luka Modric, it is loose, Karim Benzema does not hook it as he should.\n18:21 Comment: Real Madrid misses an opportunity now to take the lead.\n18:23 Comment: No, miss the chance, the chance.\n18:25 Comment: The clearest, very clear.\n18:27 Comment: Nico Pareja, we are commenting that there may be some individual errors.\n18:31 Comment: Nico Pareja at that moment makes the mistake.\n18:36 Comment: But Real Madrid did not take advantage of it, there is Luka Modric playing the ball for Karim Benzema, pursued by Vitolo.\n18:41 Comment: Modric is growing in this last stretch.\n18:43 Comment: Luka Modric plays the ball, opens the ball for Carvajal who already lives in Sevilla's field.\n18:48 Comment: Carvajal with the ball, touches the ball back, this time he is not fine in the delivery, he will have to leave his area.\n18:54 Comment: Beak.\n18:56 Comment: Yes, the change is just now, we are seeing that...\n19:0 Comment: Jovetic, yes, is the player who just called San Paolo and is ready to enter.\n19:3 Comment: The normal thing is Benzeder.\n19:5 Comment: Yeah.\n19:6 Comment: And let the power return a little bit to the side.\n19:8 Comment: Yes, a little to the side and play as a false 9 Jovetic, who at Inter I have seen there.\n19:14 Comment: With the ball again Real Madrid, Rafael Varane tries it for Carvajal.\n19:19 Comment: Carvajal, Carvajal who wins it, Carvajal who leaves, he gets into the area, Sergio Rico comes out, he hits him with a penalty.\n19:24 Comment: Sergio Rico overwhelmed him, Carvajal won the fight on the right wing.\n19:30 Comment: Sevilla, the goal scorer, is on top of him, I think there is no discussion.\n19:34 Comment: Maybe Sergio Rico is wrong because Carvajal calls very forced after the auto pass.\n19:39 Comment: Well remove maybe.\n19:40 Comment: Maybe not, he is wrong because simply maintaining his position would have gotten Carvajal, who was already in flight, in trouble.\n19:47 Comment: When he arrives in flight, he is overwhelmed by a penalty awarded to Real Madrid.\n19:52 Comment: We see the occasion repeated.\n19:54 Comment: The error we said could be played.\n19:58 Comment: And a great second half from Carvajal.\n20:4 Comment: He starts to think about whether he touches the ball or doesn't touch the ball.\n20:8 Comment: It seems to me that they take it out on top of the door.\n20:10 Comment: But if you touch with your hands, there is no value.\n20:12 Comment: Maybe it's Carvajal's turn first and then Sergio Rico's hands touch the ball.\n20:17 Comment: In any case it is unnecessary.\n20:19 Comment: It's unnecessary. Carvajal is going to crash into static advertising.\n20:24 Comment: The error has to do with the decision, with the decision to go to that moment.\n20:29 Comment: And attention, attention to Real Madrid.\n20:32 Comment: Because there comes a time when in the Cup there was more to talk about.\n20:35 Comment: And Sergio Ramos this time obviously doesn't want to know anything about the fight.\n20:39 Comment: Now Cristiano throws the ball on the back of a Sevilla player.\n20:42 Comment: Vitolo was scratching the penalty spot with his studs.\n20:46 Comment: Ronaldo throws the ball to Vitolo.\n20:49 Comment: And Vitolo already...\n20:51 Comment: Vitolo calls the referee's attention.\n20:53 Comment: Here everyone does what they shouldn't.\n20:56 Comment: Marcelo rests.\n20:58 Comment: There we see how Vitolo breaks the penalty spot.\n21:2 Comment: Cristiano throws the ball on Vitolo's back.\n21:5 Comment: Bad one, bad another.\n21:8 Comment: Vitolo, very cynical after having done what he just did, is going to demand cardboard for Cristiano.\n21:15 Comment: In the end the ball in the central circle.\n21:17 Comment: The wound healed by Marcelo.\n21:19 Comment: And Cristiano in the opportunity to launch Real Madrid against Sevilla.\n21:24 Comment: Minute 66. Christian looking at the referee.\n21:27 Comment: He looks calm. Just three career steps.\n21:30 Comment: Under the sticks Sergio Rico.\n21:32 Comment: Christian advances. Real Madrid goal.\n21:37 Comment: Sergio Ramos saw it from afar.\n21:40 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo from close up.\n21:42 Comment: The happiness of Real Madrid.\n21:45 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo's goal.\n21:47 Comment: We said that everything was at the expense of a failure in the game.\n21:51 Comment: Sevilla fell. Real Madrid hit.\n21:54 Comment: Zinedine Zidane's team takes the lead on the scoreboard.\n21:58 Comment: Yes, just when we are already seeing another mistake, precipitation on the part of Sevilla.\n22:3 Comment: When Sevilla, which has played a first half at a slower pace as it now accelerates,\n22:10 Comment: Well, he has made a couple of mistakes and now he is making the change.\n22:15 Comment: It could have already cost him the first one and now the change he had planned to make.\n22:19 Comment: Well, maybe it's different now, right?\n22:21 Comment: Or it was the one he had planned, we don't know.\n22:25 Comment: He's gone silent, hasn't he?\n22:27 Comment: Yes, the mute Vázquez, the player who left for the entrance, has gone.\n22:29 Comment: Jovetic who already made his debut the other day by scoring a goal against Real Madrid.\n22:32 Comment: Change that I had in mind before Cristiano Ronaldo's goal.\n22:35 Comment: The twelfth that he scores, by the way, here in Sánchez-Tijuana against Sevilla.\n22:39 Comment: I think Benyadez is going to continue playing a little close to the side and now as a false 9 Jovetic.\n22:42 Comment: What Sevilla has to change, now logically losing,\n22:45 Comment: Now it has to go back to being the much riskier Sevilla, right?\n22:49 Comment: The pressure.\n22:50 Comment: He was doing it and that's what he got for the mistakes, let's say.\n22:54 Comment: But now he does have to force the machine, but with more precision.\n23:1 Comment: Well, Real Madrid struck first.\n23:3 Comment: This Zinedine Zidane team that has played 40 matchdays, 40 official matches,\n23:7 Comment: without knowing defeat and is once again ahead on the scoreboard.\n23:11 Comment: 0-1, goal from Cristiano Ronaldo.\n23:13 Comment: He converted the penalty with the Sevilla driver who will try, well, to make amends\n23:19 Comment: and overcome that hard blow that Cristiano Ronaldo's goal must have meant.\n23:23 Comment: Madrid on the charge with Luka Modric looking for Cristiano.\n23:27 Comment: Sevilla responds.\n23:28 Comment: There the ball is going to move up for Benyadez.\n23:30 Comment: Nasri plays short.\n23:32 Comment: Deliver the ball short.\n23:33 Comment: Jovetic remains there in the crescent looking for a ball that the midfield men have to serve.\n23:39 Comment: Iborra opening the ball to the wing.\n23:42 Comment: There goes Nasri with the ball.\n23:43 Comment: Nasri has short solutions with Escudero and Vitolo.\n23:47 Comment: He touched the ball to Luka Modric and a throw-in for Sevilla.\n23:52 Comment: The San Paolí team is going to play.\n23:54 Comment: Real Madrid appeared head-on to take the ball, but Sevilla took it again after the cutback.\n23:59 Comment: Ball for Enzonzi.\n24:0 Comment: Enzonzi who opens the ball again towards the left wing.\n24:3 Comment: It seems that Sevilla is almost giving up, almost to the right.\n24:6 Comment: The ball for...\n24:8 Comment: For Casemiro to touch it in the area.\n24:10 Comment: It comes out loose, he puts it in the first post.\n24:12 Comment: In a second.\n24:13 Comment: There is no definitive blow for Sevilla.\n24:14 Comment: Once Kevin Lobernava is passed, he will be a side kick for Real Madrid.\n24:23 Comment: But it was for Madrid, right?\n24:24 Comment: He tells him online, however, Sevilla gives it to him.\n24:27 Comment: Clearly it is the Sevilla player who touches the ball.\n24:31 Comment: Marcelo is chatting with him.\n24:32 Comment: I believe that the referee has corrected the assistant who clearly indicated that Sevilla should play.\n24:39 Comment: Then he corrected it and he was right with the correction because it was Sevilla that threw the ball out.\n24:44 Comment: Marcelo playing for Kroos.\n24:46 Comment: Kroos for Marcelo.\n24:47 Comment: Enough done with getting the ball out of Marcelo's hands.\n24:49 Comment: Mariano touched the ball.\n24:51 Comment: Mariano plays behind for Ramir.\n24:52 Comment: Ramir cuts against Cristiano.\n24:54 Comment: Play again for Mariano.\n24:56 Comment: This one leaves Toni Kroos.\n24:57 Comment: Casemiro also raffles.\n24:58 Comment: Open

already been restored when Sevilla is playing trying to find Carvajal's back.\n25:21 Comment: Varane always attentive to the removal.\n25:23 Comment: Varane is having a great game too.\n25:25 Comment: The three Madrid center backs today in that group change are at a very good level.\n25:28 Comment: They are covering those possible spaces generated by playing with longer wingers.\n25:33 Comment: With Carvajal and Marcelo more advanced.\n25:36 Comment: These permanent aids on both sides are doing very well for both Varane and Nacho.\n25:41 Comment: Catch the ball in Somsi.\n25:43 Comment: Play the ball to Nico Pareja.\n25:45 Comment: Nico in the central circle, in the Sevilla midfield to touch it on Ramí.\n25:50 Comment: It seems that Sevilla is taking a break to rethink its ideas.\n25:54

    "summary": "In a thrilling encounter that saw Sevilla take on Real Madrid at the Sánchez Pizjuán, both teams displayed moments of brilliance and lapses that swayed the momentum back and forth throughout the match.\n\nThe atmosphere in the stadium was electric as the game kicked off. From the onset, Sevilla moved the ball with urgency. Real Madrid, displaying a new defensive set-up with three central defenders, Nacho, Sergio Ramos, and Varane, aimed to control Sevilla’s initial onslaught. Early on, the match saw an intense battle for possession. Marcelo, operating in a more advanced role, and Carvajal, sticking to the defensive unit, formed the backbone of Real Madrid's structure.\n\nSevilla's Steven N'Zonzi, an impressive figure in the midfield, frequently pressed forward, assisting the defense and orchestrating attacks. Luka Modric and Toni Kroos struggled to assert their dominance in the middle of the park against Sevilla's aggressive pressing. Escudero and Mariano from Sevilla constantly pressured Real Madrid's wing-backs, ensuring the game remained lively with frequent interceptions and counter-attacks from both sides.\n\nDespite several attempts by both teams to create scoring opportunities, defenses held strong. Real Madrid’s early strategy was evident: high pressing, which seemed particularly effective, often disrupting Sevilla's backline. Cristiano Ronaldo and Benzema naturally spearheaded the attack, attempting to find gaps but often being thwarted by Ramí and Nico Pareja.\n\nAs tension built, Real Madrid's Marcelo moved up the left flank with fluid motion, often linking with midfielders and looking to provide service to Benzema and Ronaldo. However, Sevilla’s Vitolo frequently found space, driving at Real Madrid’s defense and causing significant problems, although without a final product to show for his efforts.\n\nZidane’s men manufactured a few notable chances, such as Sergio Ramos trying to head a cross into the net from a Toni Kroos corner. Although Ramos managed to win the aerial duel, his header sailed wide. On the other hand, Sevilla aimed to exploit any lapses in Real Madrid's defense, aiming to catch Keylor Navas off his line, but without consistent success.\n\nAfter a goalless first half, the second half began with a continued sense of urgency. Sevilla was determined to press Real Madrid high and fast, resulting in early corners and indirect free-kicks that increased the pressure on Real Madrid’s defense. However, the lack of clinical finishing meant that these chances were not converted into goals.\n\nAs the game progressed, both teams began showing signs of fatigue, yet neither relented in their efforts. Cristiano Ronaldo continued to hustle Sevilla’s defenders, while Vitolo and Ben Yedder aimed to break the deadlock for the hosts.\n\nThen came a significant moment: Carvajal, involved in a dynamic move down the right, was brought down inside the box by Sergio Rico, implying a clear penalty. Amidst the protests and the intense atmosphere, Cristiano Ronaldo stepped up and coolly converted the penalty, placing the ball past Sergio Rico to give Real Madrid a 1-0 lead.\n\nSevilla, undeterred, continued to rally and found a new burst of energy. Ben Yedder and the substitutes, particularly Jovetic, sought to capitalize on the frayed nerves within the Real Madrid defensive ranks. This renewed effort soon paid off when a well-delivered ball from Sarabia found its way into Real Madrid’s net, courtesy of an unfortunate own goal by Sergio Ramos, leveling the score at 1-1.\n\nWith the game poised on a knife-edge, both teams pushed for a winner. Keylor Navas made crucial saves to keep Real Madrid in the game, while Sergio Rico did likewise at the other end.\n\nThe game saw its ultimate twist in the dying embers. With barely any time remaining, Sevilla launched one last attack. Jovetic, picking up the ball from outside the area, unleashed a stunning shot that curled its way past Keylor Navas and into the net. Jubilation exploded around the Sánchez Pizjuán as Sevilla incredibly turned the game on its head to lead 2-1.\n\nReal Madrid's attempt to salvage a point saw Sergio Ramos moving forward in search of an equalizer. However, time was against them, and Sevilla held on to their slender lead. As the final whistle blew, it was clear that both teams had given their all in a match that epitomized the drama and passion of La Liga football.\n\nSevilla's victory was a testament to their resilience and tactical astuteness, particularly how they managed to mount a comeback against a formidable Real Madrid side. Cristiano Ronaldo’s penalty might have given Real Madrid the lead, but the own goal by Sergio Ramos and the brilliant winner by Jovetic wrote a different ending. It was a night that belonged to Sevilla, showcasing their capability to turn the tide and secure a memorable win in front of their ecstatic fans."
