    "summary": "In a thrilling encounter held at the Estadio Municipal de Ipurua, Real Madrid secured a dominant 4-1 victory over SD Eibar. The match kicked off with Real Madrid taking the initiative right from the first whistle.\n\nWithin seconds of the match starting, Real Madrid committed their first foul at just 40 seconds into the game. Eibar was awarded an indirect free-kick, which they took but failed to capitalize on, as the game was frequently paused due to the ball going out of play -- an early indication of what was to be a stop-start encounter. By the 7th minute, the ball had already been out of play several times with both teams exchanging throw-ins and clearances.\n\nReal Madrid's Benzema was quick to establish his presence, though he was penalised for an offensive foul by referee Gonzalez Gonzalez at 10:15. Eibar, despite their spirited attempts, struggled to maintain meaningful possession or create substantial scoring opportunities. Their frequent throw-ins evidenced their struggle to push the ball forward effectively.\n\nAt 13:10, Karim Benzema found himself in the spotlight once more when he received a precise low pass inside the box. His controlled shot was saved brilliantly by Eibar's goalkeeper, Yoel, only for Benzema to capitalize on the rebound and slot it home, registering the game's first goal at 13:27, giving Real Madrid a 1-0 lead. Eibar kicked off again hoping to recover, but their attacks were often intercepted easily by the alert Madrid defence.\n\nReal Madrid’s relentless pressure was apparent when at 22:34, Lucas Vazquez's pass was thwarted, and the subsequent Real Madrid corner kick failed to bear fruit. However, Madrid's offensive persistence paid off again at 24:08 when James Rodriguez whipped in a precise cross from a free-kick. Benzema made no mistake, again finding the net and doubling Real’s advantage to 2-0.\n\nEibar aimed to respond quickly but struggled to break through a well-organized Madrid defence. Gonzalo Escalante’s hard tackle earned him a yellow card at 31:37 after committing a hard foul on Real Madrid’s player. The resultant free-kick saw Real Madrid maintaining pressure yet missing twice with shots off-target.\n\nAs the first half progressed, Eibar’s Sergio Enrich missed a key header at 37:56 -- a well-placed cross barely wide of its target. The home side faced further disappointment when Pedro Leon's attempts to quicken play through short corners were neutralized by Madrid’s defence. Eibar's troubles amplified when Real Madrid capitalized on their opportunities. At 28:44, James Rodriguez showcased his attacking prowess by scoring by sending the ball under the crossbar, giving Madrid a substantial 3-0 lead heading into the halftime.\n\nThe second half mirrored Madrid's dominance. Eibar began with a substitution, replacing Antonio Luna with Anaitz Arbilla in a bid to fortify their defence. Real Madrid remained sharp, with Karim Benzema sending a shot wide of the post at 03:06. His side continued to stifle Eibar’s attacking attempts, which included shutting down Ruben Pena’s close-range attempts.\n\nDefending a set-piece, Real Madrid also managed well, clearing corners and intercepting Eibar’s through balls. In an effort to revive their strategy, Eibar substituted Adrian with Cristian Rivera at 17:59 and later saw Sergio Enrich attempt to exploit chances within the box, but to no avail.\n\nReal Madrid’s counter-attacks were incisive. Marco Asensio's attempt at goal, albeit bothering Eibar’s defence, failed to extend the tally early in the second half. Yet, persistence paid off when an attacking series resulted in Real's 4th goal of the game at 14:21. Marco Asensio skillfully rebounded James Rodriguez’s shot that had hit the post - a testimony to their relentless pressing.\n\nAs the game progressed, yellow cards made a re-appearance. Nacho received a caution at 16:53 for a foul, joining teammate Casemiro who also earned a booking at 19:36 post a hard challenge. Real's substitution saw Mariano come on for Benzema, immediately finding himself in a promising position but was eventually flagged offside.\n\nEibar, despite their attempts, only managed a solitary goal. Pedro Leon delivered a pinpoint cross to Ruben Pena at 26:05, who managed to head the ball into the net, marking their single success in a game dominated by Madrid. As the clock wound down, frequent throw-ins, corners, and offsides underscored the match's pace. Eibar’s efforts at the 33:20 mark included short but potentially dangerous corners, yet Madrid maintained their resolve to prevent further breaches.\n\nSubstitutions continued for both sides, aiming to inject fresh legs and dynamic changes. Luca Modric’s substitution by Mateo Kovacic at 25:56 was a strategic maneuver to keep Madrid's engine running smoothly on the field.\n\nIn the final phases of the match, Real Madrid’s Mariano found himself repeatedly in the offside trap, nullifying potential threats and showcasing Eibar’s defensive coordination. Eibar’s offensive persistence was evident, with Pedro Leon sending ballistic passes, but unfortunately, these efforts weren’t converted into points, with shots either sailing over the bar or being cleared by Madrid's defence.\n\nReal's substitute Isco, coming on for James Rodriguez, also played a crucial role in maintaining their lead. The last few minutes saw a consistent defensive stand from Real, parrying off Eibar's attacks and retaining possession. Arbilla’s minor injury scare at 37:31 was quickly managed, allowing Eibar to continue pushing in the dying minutes, though their efforts bore no further fruit.\n\nFinally, as the time ticked away, Real Madrid's composed defence and effective game management culminated in the referee's whistle at 46:50, sealing an emphatic 4-1 victory. This match displayed Madrid's tactical superiority, precise passing, and clinical finishing, with Karim Benzema and James Rodriguez highlighting their attacking prowess, leading their team to a decisive and morale-boosting victory.\n\nEibar’s effort throughout was commendable, albeit unsatisfactory in terms of execution. Frequent mismanagement of possession, off-target shots, and unsuccessful set-pieces illustrated their struggles against a more cohesive and skilled Real Madrid side. The match, viewed by a crowd of 6740, reflected the classic narrative of a powerful team executing their strategy meticulously against a resilient but outclassed opponent."
