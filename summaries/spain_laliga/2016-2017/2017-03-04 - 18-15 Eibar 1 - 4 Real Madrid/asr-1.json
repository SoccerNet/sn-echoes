very delicate players who are on the left wing to unbalance.\n14:6 Comment: The players' circle is very difficult.\n14:8 Comment: All the defense is superfluous.\n14:9 Comment: He finds Benzema waiting at the far post.\n14:10 Comment: He hits him with his right hand half asleep.\n14:11 Comment: The doorman answers.\n14:12 Comment: But Benzema takes advantage of the rebound again.\n14:13 Comment: Very participative since the game started.\n14:14 Comment: And finally finding a space.\n14:15 Comment: And what is very difficult in the game is that the goalkeeper begins to turn around.\n14:16 Comment: And the bottom part of the ball.\n14:17 Comment: Let's see.\n14:18 Comment: And the goalkeeper is going to make the return.\n14:19 Comment: Let's see.\n14:20 Comment: And the goalkeeper does it.\n14:22 Comment: And the goalkeeper is going to turn around.\n14:23 Comment: But again, the ball comes off.\n14:24 Comment: He hits him.\n14:25 Comment: And when the ball takes off, he doesn't try.\n14:26 Comment: And now, what is very difficult.\n14:27 Comment: The goalkeeper responds, but Benzema takes advantage of the rebound again, very participative since the match began and finally finding a space that allows him to reach the goal.\n14:40 Comment: And Real Madrid wants more, once again in the offensive phase Zidane's team, James stepping into the area, Benzema asks for it, Nacho also puts it in, James has touched Joel and now, after the first intervention, he manages to get the ball Eibar's goalkeeper again.\n14:54 Comment: Two opportunities in just one minute for the white team, the first Ricardo ended up going in.\n15:0 Comment: Karim Benzema's sixth goal this season in the Santander League, but he had a streak of one goal in the last ten games he had played, the one he scored against Napoli at the Bernabéu breaks the streak.\n15:11 Comment: Karim Benzema, who had thought the game very well, now Eibar tries to respond with Pepe's clearance and before, in that second opportunity, Casemiro's hands on the head of Modric, Real Madrid was close to second.\n15:24 Comment: In this last play Nacho asked the goalkeeper for a session and the request was not unreasonable.\n15:32 Comment: It is the action in which after James's center from the right, Joel touches and the Eibar defender appears, there you appreciated or interpreted that there may be some intention of the local player.\n15:43 Comment: It seems to me that there was every intention of giving it to the goalkeeper, the referee did not interpret it that way.\n15:49 Comment: Ramis puts his head in, ball above Luna.\n15:54 Comment: Escalante distributes, Luka Modric arrives in time to throw it out, throw-in for Antonio Luna.\n16:2 Comment: We take the opportunity to see again the action that you mentioned just a few seconds ago, Jorge.\n16:7 Comment: James's center touches Joel and appears to put the outside of the Mauro Dos Santos boot.\n16:11 Comment: He interprets to the referee that the only thing the Eibar player wants is to intercept that ball.\n16:19 Comment: The ball goes up from Casemiro, the Armera Defense lets it run.\n16:24 Comment: Iván Ramis starts from behind.\n16:34 Comment: Mauro plays the Argentine center back long.\n16:38 Comment: Inaccurate submission on the rise of Ander Kappa.\n16:42 Comment: Throw-in for Nacho.\n16:44 Comment: By the way, José, who scored for Real Madrid during the match, in the first half hour, which is when Eibar is most effective this season.\n16:52 Comment: There are eight goals in the first 30 minutes.\n16:54 Comment: Real Madrid scored in the first match.\n16:55 Comment: This is how the Santiago Bernabéu scored 0-1 in a match that would end 1-1.\n16:59 Comment: Today it was the other way around.\n17:0 Comment: Today it is Real Madrid that scored in that part of the game where the team of Mendy and Eibar, I insist, is so effective.\n17:8 Comment: In fact, with this goal, Real Madrid ties in that aspect with Eibar and they become the two fiercest teams in the first third of all league games.\n17:17 Comment: And another game in which Real Madrid scores, which has already scored 40 and a lot.\n17:22 Comment: 46, if I remember correctly.\n17:24 Comment: Ramos changes everything about Lucas's career.\n17:30 Comment: The advantage goes to Joel.\n17:34 Comment: He keeps the ball from the Vigués goalkeeper.\n17:39 Comment: The real Madrid...\n17:39 Comment: Which invites Mauro Santos to elaborate in short, to start from behind.\n17:42 Comment: That is. Real Madrid tries, well, to make its technical quality weigh.\n17:48 Comment: The thing is, it's not easy.\n17:49 Comment: First because the field is not in perfect condition.\n17:52 Comment: It is a field that suffers a lot.\n17:54 Comment: The climatology.\n17:55 Comment: Because there is a fairly large area that is shaded for a good part of the day.\n18:1 Comment: And that means the field is not in perfect condition.\n18:7 Comment: Then because Eibar's pressure is very, very effective.\n18:11 Comment: But while waiting to make their technical quality weigh, Madrid is accepting the guidelines set by Eibar.\n18:17 Comment: He is running, the forwards are showing themselves.\n18:20 Comment: Both James and Benzema are putting...\n18:24 Comment: A very high pace to the game.\n18:26 Comment: Good ball looking for Lucas.\n18:27 Comment: He couldn't puncture it.\n18:28 Comment: It wasn't easy either, much less the international footballer for Spain.\n18:33 Comment: A goal kick is given for Eibar.\n18:42 Comment: Joel is now preparing to execute.\n18:44 Comment: And at the moment Real Madrid, although still with almost 70 minutes or more than 70 minutes ahead,\n18:51 Comment: but at the moment Real Madrid winning on a stage...\n18:54 Comment: Very few have done it this year.\n18:56 Comment: Barcelona, ​​Atlético de Madrid and Club Atlético Osasuna.\n18:59 Comment: And even if it is momentary and until FC Barcelona plays,\n19:3 Comment: recovering the leadership of the Santander League.\n19:5 Comment: By the way, now that we saw that short shot of Mendilibar and also of Iñaki Bea,\n19:9 Comment: How is Iñaki good at giving instructions?\n19:10 Comment: Well, for now he is standing calmly asking that.\n19:13 Comment: Peace of mind to your footballers.\n19:15 Comment: He is not very participative when it comes to giving orders,\n19:18 Comment: but there he is watching and following the game calmly.\n19:21 Comment: Even if it's on the bench, but often standing.\n19:24 Comment: AND...\n19:24 Comment: Adrián put it in the center, he cleared the defense, he is going to insist from Eibar's side.\n19:31 Comment: Adrián extends, Sergi Enric arrives, who lowers it with his chest.\n19:35 Comment: Enric for Luna, Luna puts her in front.\n19:37 Comment: Pedro León clicks it, escalante, up!\n19:40 Comment: Eibar's action was good, Pedro León's shot was good\n19:43 Comment: for Gonzalo Escalante's first shot.\n19:46 Comment: Ball over Keylor Navas' goal.\n19:49 Comment: Real Madrid's pressure is also good,\n19:52 Comment: That's why Escalante has to serve very quickly.\n19:54 Comment: Shot.\n19:57 Comment: Because one wonders at this level at what speed a player can be accurate.\n20:3 Comment: Well, the more speed, the less precision.\n20:7 Comment: We took the opportunity to see again what is currently the only goal of the game,\n20:11 Comment: Benzema's shot, who finds himself with the ball on top.\n20:14 Comment: It's unorthodox, but Joel's reaction is very commendable,\n20:17 Comment: because Benzema's first shot is well placed.\n20:19 Comment: Yes, it is well placed, yes.\n20:21 Comment: Yeah.\n20:22 Comment: He can barely touch it with the tips of his fingers,\n20:24 Comment: The ball falls to Benzema again and this time left-footed.\n20:31 Comment: Ball up from Pepe, ball to Joel.\n20:33 Comment: I was going to say a Benzema this season,\n20:35 Comment: criticized in some games for his performances,\n20:40 Comment: where more is asked of him from the Bernabéu stands,\n20:42 Comment: a Benzema who in recent weeks,\n20:44 Comment: We have seen it in the Celta Cup,\n20:46 Comment: last Wednesday before the Las Palmas Sports Union,\n20:49 Comment: It was difficult for him to find the goal on some occasions in the shot.\n20:53 Comment: Today, the first time he has had,\n20:54 Comment: He has made it 1-0.\n20:56 Comment: That thing about them taking her out of the stadium,\n20:58 Comment: It has remained almost like an artificial phrase,\n21:1 Comment: because the stadiums are so big now,\n21:3 Comment: that you can almost never get it out of there.\n21:4 Comment: Here it can happen,\n21:5 Comment: and an Eibar footballer has just done it.\n21:8 Comment: It is played again in Ipurúa,\n21:10 Comment: with that change of orientation by Marco Asensio.\n21:12 Comment: Lucas fucks her, he has the

out,\n21:30 Comment: and finally Casemiro threw it deep to no one,\n21:35 Comment: because the Madrid players,\n21:36 Comment: accompanying the defense movement,\n21:38 Comment: They also went out.\n21:38 Comment: By the way Ricardo, I am convinced that you are very attentive\n21:41 Comment: to that film in stages,\n21:44 Comment: to that serial that Sergi Henrik is starring in,\n21:47

assistant.\n22:23 Comment: No, no, he has disavowed it,\n22:24 Comment: because the line judge had raised the flag,\n22:26 Comment: and it seemed that he had signaled offside,\n22:28 Comment: but no, the corner pointed out,\n22:29 Comment: but the linesman had raised the flag,\n22:32 Comment: pointing out the anti-regulatory position of James Rodríguez.\n22:35 Comment: Man, it seems obvious that he is ahead.\n22:37 Comment: Yes, but the referee interprets that the ball comes from the Eibar player,\n22:40 Comment: here we will see it.\n22:42 Comment: There it is, the last one to play is escalante,\n22:45 Comment: In other words, the referee saw it better than the lineman.\n22:48 Comment: There goes Real Madrid, send it to the near post, clear it,\n22:51 Comment: Ander Kappa.\n22:53 Comment: The ball doesn't seem good to me,\n22:54 Comment: but the coordination,\n22:55 Comment: Lillian marked the forward position,\n22:56 Comment: and what the referee understood was that that ball was driven by an Eibar player.\n23:3 Comment: Seen calmly, everything developed as it should work.\n23:6 Comment: That is.\n23:6 Comment: They warned the main referee and he made the decision.\n23:11

committing a foul on Lucas Vázquez.\n23:39 Comment: That he controlled well,\n23:41 Comment: who defended that ball very well,\n23:44 Comment: and what he got in return, being very isolated,\n23:48 Comment: a foul that suited Madrid a lot,\n23:51 Comment: because I didn't have much of a way out of that situation.\n23:54 Comment: Luke.\n23:56 Comment: Come up Pepe,\n23:57 Comment: Ramos goes

its advantage.\n24:42 Comment: Benzema repeats.\n24:44 Comment: Eibar zero, Real Madrid two.\n24:47 Comment: Well, I think the Eibar players relied on offside.\n24:50 Comment: That is the only thing that explains the ease they gave Eibar.\n24:54 Comment: And what they have given to Benzema.\n24:55 Comment: Which by the way, push that ball with the spur,\n24:59 Comment: with a quality that is a trademark of the house.\n25:2 Comment: The truth is that he has already left us a goal out of nine,\n25:5 Comment: out of nine in a lifetime.\n25:8 Comment: And now, a goal from Benzema.\n25:10 Comment: A goal full of quality.\n25:12 Comment: Real Madrid two to zero.\n25:14 Comment: Benzema's two goals.\n25:16 Comment: That gives me the feeling that she is not very worried\n25:20 Comment: for the criticism that has been raining down on him lately.\n25:23 Comment: He is a cold player to play with.\n25:25 Comment: Too cold to understand that these issues\n25:28 Comment: They are football things.\n25:31 Comment: That they must be understood and that they do not have to be modified\n25:34 Comment: neither your confidence, nor your relationship with the game.\n25:39 Comment: Karim

Comment: Positionally, here we have it, it is being very useful\n27:19 Comment: to interrupt all attack attempts\n27:21 Comment: about Eibar and in terms of football, let's not even talk about it.\n27:24 Comment: Every ball he touches improves.\n27:28 Comment: Look at what Benzema does, he is a player.\n27:31 Comment: Very elegant in the maneuver, although it was not worth it\n27:33 Comment: to Real Madrid to keep the ball.\n27:35 Comment: Pedro León puts it on Danilo's back,\n27:37 Comment: who attacks that ball with more conviction than Adrián.\n27:40 Comment: However, Adrián got his way.\n27:42 Comment: He was much more alive at the end and notice how he seemed\n27:45 Comment: that the Eibar footballer was slowing down his career\n27:48 Comment: forcing that mistake from Danilo.\n27:50 Comment: That calls for a goal kick.\n27:55 Comment: Danilo thinks that the ball had already gone out.\n27:58 Comment: Pedro León puts it, closed delivery, second post.\n28:0 Comment: Sergi Henrik jumped with everything and from here it seemed,\n28:3 Comment: yes Ricardo, that the foul was evident on the goalkeeper\n28:6 Comment: of the white box.\n28:7 Comment: González González

team.\n28:32 Comment: In any case, the lack is very clear.\n28:34 Comment: The goalkeeper is not touched inside the small area\n28:37 Comment: and here Keylor was overwhelmed.\n28:46 Comment: Keylor

from Sopovla is wrong.\n28:56 Comment: Modric's deep ball.\n28:58 Comment: This is Benzema, who can cross Benzema for James.\n29:2 Comment: Goal!\n29:11 Comment: From Real Madrid in the 29th, James

Saturday Benzema has today!\n29:24 Comment: Lift your head.\n29:25 Comment: Guess the Colombian's unchecking.\n29:27 Comment: And he puts it at the first post with just the right force\n29:30 Comment: so that a simple deflection with James' toe\n29:33 Comment: becomes an unstoppable shot for Joel.\n29:35 Comment: Another from Real Madrid scores James Rodríguez.\n29:37 Comment: Hey, Marcelo.\n29:38 Comment: Real Madrid 3.\n29:39 Comment: What a Saturday Benzema has!\n29:41 Comment: And James' Saturday isn't bad.\n29:43 Comment: The two entered the game very plugged in,\n29:47 Comment: very inspired.\n29:48 Comment: And in half an hour they turned the game around\n29:52 Comment: with wonderful plays.\n29:54 Comment: This was actually started by Modric,\n29:56 Comment: who first eliminated a rival.\n29:58 Comment: Then he enabled Benzema in depth.\n30:2 Comment: The center was perfect.\n30:4 Comment: And the extraordinary definition.\n30:6 Comment: It was very difficult to connect left footed at the first post.\n30:9 Comment: so that the ball hits the opposite angle.\n30:13 Comment: Well, the second was from James to Benzema.\n30:16 Comment: From the same wing, from the right of Real Madrid's attack,\n30:20 Comment: This was from Benzema to James.\n30:22 Comment: It is James Rodríguez's second goal in this Santander League.\n30:25 Comment: He had only scored against Espanyol in Cornellá\n30:28 Comment: in a meeting where the figure of the Colombian was also present.\n30:32 Comment: A lot of controversy over his possible departure.\n30:35 Comment: Well, today he scored again in the League.\n30:37 Comment: It's 0 to 3.\n30:38 Comment: Half an hour of game.\n30:39 Comment: Real Madrid has the match practically resolved.\n30:42 Comment: Let's not forget that James also had a part in the first goal\n30:45 Comment: in that association on the left with Asensio.\n30:49 Comment: That ended in a center, finished off by Benzema\n30:54 Comment: who today is revealing himself as the man of the match\n30:57 Comment: jumping over all the discussions and all the controversies.\n31:1 Comment: Complicated moments for Eibar who have conceded three goals in just 15 minutes.\n31:4 Comment: Ricardo identifies that with the crowd who tries to do their part to lift up his team.\n31:8 Comment: Yes, to try to raise the morale of the Mendilibar team today in the box.\n31:13 Comment: Koinjaki sees Enel Banquillo, who now no longer knows if it will be the first goal.\n31:15 Comment: What happens is that Real Madrid is giving instructions to its men.\n31:17 Comment: But they are 31-0 in Madrid.\n31:20 Comment: Perhaps the most serious of the season, at least of the last few months.\n31:24 Comment: Luna's mistake Asensio wants to penalize.\n31:26 Comment: Asensio on the front.\n31:27 Comment: Asensio continues cutting.\n31:28 Comment: More from Asensio.\n31:29 Comment: Asensio stays locked up.\n31:30 Comment: It ends up on the floor.\n31:31 Comment: He got himself stuck.\n31:32 Comment: The possibility was lost for Real Madrid.\n31:34 Comment: There is a hard foul by Gonzalo Escalante on Carlos Casemiro.\n31:38 Comment: Yes, and let's see with the warning because it is the first card of the game.\n31:43 Comment: The one that Gonzalo Escalante sees.\n31:44 Comment: The one that the Eibar footballer sees.\n31:46 Comment: The Argentine who sees that first warning from Gonzalo Escalante.\n31:50 Comment: With Casemiro lying on the field of play.\n31:54 Comment: He already gets up while Pepe receives instructions from the bench.\n31:58 Comment: To try to correct the positions of their players in defense.\n32:2 Comment: The yellow card is indisputable.\n32:4 Comment: So indisputable that Escalante did not discuss it.\n32:7 Comment: What a good play by Asensio.\n32:10 Comment: When it's stuck to your foot, there's no way to get it off.\n32:12 Comment: It is also very fast to drive.\n32:14 Comment: I'm sorry.\n32:15 Comment: Along Pepe.\n32:19 Comment: Every time in defense Pedro León.\n32:21 Comment: Dani García had time to stop and decide.\n32:24 Comment: He ended up rushing and that means Pepe can anticipate Sergi Henrík.\n32:28 Comment: It will be a goal kick for the Eibar sports society.\n32:31 Comment: Watching the result and watching the development of the match.\n32:34 Comment: The crash script.\n32:36 Comment: Especially in the second half of what we have already played.\n32:39 Comment: It is clear that Real Madrid is getting the game they had in mind.\n32:42 Comment: And it is clearly getting closer to what it had worked for and was looking for from the beginning.\n32:47 Comment: Quite the opposite surely happens at Eibar.\n32:51 Comment: Where can you pass the recovery point you are looking for right now.\n32:54 Comment: And it seems the Mendilíba team can't find it.\n32:56 Comment: He can't seem to find it.\n32:58 Comment: Indeed he has been a victim of the inspiration of some high-class Real Madrid players.\n33:4 Comment: But the best we can say about Real Madrid in this little more than half an hour into the game.\n33:11 Comment: The thing is that he waited for inspiration running.\n33:14 Comment: He waited for her running, he waited for her sacrificing herself.\n33:17 Comment: He waited for her pressing.\n33:20 Comment: And when he found opportunities he has been infallible.\n33:25 Comment: He did not have more than three scoring chances.\n33:27 Comment: And they are winning 3 to 0.\n33:29 Comment: The level of efficiency is very high.\n33:31 Comment: At the level of the category of players who are on the field of play.\n33:36 Comment: Danilo encouraged himself from the front with his less capable leg.\n33:39 Comment: With the left.\n33:41 Comment: Deflected shot from the Mineiro soccer player.\n33:44 Comment: He's going to play in the long Joel.\n33:51 Comment: Adrián is looking for her.\n33:52 Comment: Modric touched header.\n33:54 Comment: But there was a lack of Adrián González.\n33:56 Comment: That is happening to Eibar.\n33:59 Comment: He's always a second late.\n34:1 Comment: They are not able to take three steps in a row.\n34:4 Comment: The players he needs the most like Pedro León.\n34:9 Comment: They are intervening very little.\n34:12 Comment: And the truth is that practically, well without practically.\n34:15 Comment: They have not created a single scoring chance worthy of the nation.\n34:20 Comment: The opening of Dani García.\n34:22 Comment: Antonio Luna runs.\n34:24 Comment: Moon in the center for Escalante.\n34:25 Comment: That has meters ahead.\n34:26 Comment: Escalante is encouraged.\n34:27 Comment: Escalante hits him up top.\n34:29 Comment: It wasn't bad because it has a good shot.\n34:31 Comment: Gonzalo Escalante has a good shot from distance.\n34:33 Comment: But it seemed like he could get much closer.\n34:35 Comment: Yes, exactly. Yeah.\n34:37 Comment: Very far from the goal.\n34:39 Comment: He had ten meters ahead of him to explore.\n34:42 Comment: He preferred to shoot from afar.\n34:45 Comment: Second shot on Escalante's goal.\n34:48 Comment: By the way, we took advantage of the interruption in the game.\n34:51 Comment: To recover that 0 to 3.\n34:53 Comment: Not only to criticize us with the good play of Real Madrid.\n34:55 Comment: But to dispel the doubt that someone might have.\n34:58 Comment: Approaching a possible offside at the moment when Benzema crosses.\n35:1 Comment: He is helping us with that graphic tool.\n35:4 Comment: It becomes much more evident.\n35:5 Comment: Fully enabled James Rodríguez.\n35:6 Comment: Is enabled.\n35:8 Comment: And the left-handed touch is wonderful.\n35:15 Comment: Escalante.\n35:16 Comment: Too powerful opening for Ander Kappa.\n35:19 Comment: Nacho quickly throws in the throw.\n35:21 Comment: Real Madrid's good pressure is forcing Eibar to play at a speed higher than what suits them.\n35:28 Comment: That's why we are seeing it so, so imprecise.\n35:36 Comment: Nacho searches for her paired with Kappa.\n35:38 Comment: Protect the ball from the Portugalete player.\n35:41 Comment: Throw-in for Eibar.\n35:43 Comment: Already within the last 10 minutes of the first half.\n35:46 Comment: .\n35:52 Comment: With Sergi Henrik's chest.\n35:53 Comment: Rival James gives it to Marco Asensio.\n35:56 Comment: James again.\n35:58 Comment: The Colombian delivers for Modric.\n35:59 Comment: The triangulation of the white box is excellent.\n36:2 Comment: Deep ball from Danilo to keep Lucas Vázquez running.\n36:4 Comment: .\n36:5 Comment: Lucas tries to throw Rubén Peña into the pipe.\n36:10 Comment: The former Leganés sports club cannot be surpassed.\n36:14 Comment: Real Madrid is very plugged in, José.\n36:16 Comment: Very plugged in.\n36:20 Comment: We must remember that there are 8 changes compared to Wednesday's game.\n36:24 Comment: And that on the bench there are footballers like Carvajal, Kroos, Marcelo, Kovacic, Mariano or Isco.\n36:29 Comment: Let's see the changes of Zinedine Zidane.\n36:31 Comment: We must remember that Peil, Cristiano, Morata, Barán, Sainz.\n36:33 Comment: .\n36:34 Comment: They have stayed in Madrid.\n36:36 Comment: A team full of the less common and that is playing a game of this level.\n36:42 Comment: Yeah.\n36:43 Comment: Those who stayed in Madrid are all well represented.\n36:48 Comment: Today all the new players are playing at a very good level.\n36:53 Comment: And in some specific cases we are talking about footballers who, without having had any physical problems, have been going through a period of little activity.\n37:1 Comment: Or no activity.\n37:3 Comment: Or no fairly prolonged activity.\n37:5 Comment: Surely the most striking situation is that of Marco Asensio who, throughout the month of February,\n37:8 Comment: where Real Madrid has played on the order of 5 or 6 games, they have not had a single second of competition.\n37:13 Comment: That is.\n37:14 Comment: And yet he is playing at a very good pace.\n37:17 Comment: Also with the starting point very, very far back.\n37:21 Comment: At the moment, for example, he is practically at left back.\n37:26 Comment: And if Madrid recovers, in a very short time we will see him in the left winger position.\n37:31 Comment: Everyone is playing.\n37:32 Comment: Everyone is playing with full compliance with obligations.\n37:39 Comment: And when they have the ball they show their category.\n37:43 Comment: Marco Asensio's last game against Real Sociedad was 3-0 on matchday number 20.\n37:49 Comment: And yes, he had been a footballer used a lot by Zinani in that phase of the month in the Copa del Rey.\n37:54 Comment: He puts it on Capa. She sends the second stick. This is Rubén Peña. Sergi Henríiiic is waiting.\n37:58 Comment: Ramos stuck.\n38:0 Comment: Ander exists. Cape for Eibar.\n38:2 Comment: The gunsmith team just had it.\n38:4 Comment: Capa continues driving. Clean recovery of Marco Asensio.\n38:7 Comment: Let's run, says Real Madrid.\n38:9 Comment: Benzema directs. He is accompanied by James Rodríguez.\n38:12 Comment: More on French driving. Benzema stepping into the area. Benzema stops.\n38:16 Comment: Benzema combines with James. They didn't quite understand each other.\n38:19 Comment: The possibility for the white box is lost.\n38:21 Comment: Just before Jorge had Eibar to take advantage of Sergi Henriic's boots.\n38:26 Comment: It is Eibar's clearest play so far in the game.\n38:29 Comment: And the first time Capa is able to find a place for the overflow.\n38:35 Comment: Perfect center. And the play was really dangerous.\n38:41 Comment: Here it is difficult for Henriic to get the shot off and when he does it he already had the Real Madrid defense on top of him.\n38:50 Comment: But we had to wait almost 40 minutes for Eibar to finally find a scoring opportunity worth mentioning.\n38:58 Comment: The first.\n38:59 Comment: And as for Real Madrid's response, Benzema should be told that counterattacks are made by touching the ball, not driving the ball.\n39:8 Comment: Antonio Luna receives and Adrián turns. He is accompanied by Rubén Peña.\n39:14 Comment: Deep ball. The man from Avila is going to center. Rubén Peña puts it on. Danilo headdress.\n39:19 Comment: It will be a corner kick although Ricardo claims handball from the stands.\n39:22 Comment: And from the field. Danilo's hand is also claimed from the field. But González González has been clear about it.\n39:27 Comment: He has already pointed out.\n39:28 Comment: Already the corner kick with his hand so the protest stops at that. Just in a protest.\n39:34 Comment: Yes, very open hand too.\n39:36 Comment: Why don't they do that old thing where they put their hand behind them when they go out on their sides, right?\n39:43 Comment: This way they avoid any type of problem.\n39:46 Comment: And there is Modriot again taking the ball away.\n39:49 Comment: Because it works for the entire front.\n39:52 Comment: He saves her over the line. She tries to get rid of Pedro León.\n39:55 Comment: In the end he gets his way on the 21st in Eibar.\n39:57 Comment: Pedro León puts it at the back post.\n39:59 Comment: Forcing Keylor Navas to come out to pick up that ball.\n40:3 Comment: Applauded by Pepe. Because he actually did it decisively.\n40:8 Comment: It was raining in the center but there the goalkeeper has to avoid any sense of danger.\n40:15 Comment: Bad start from Ramos.\n40:16 Comment: Ramos error. Sergi Henrik plays first class.\n40:18 Comment: Gonzalo Escalante was looking for her. Ramos arrives again to correct the mistake he himself made.\n40:24 Comment: Ramos from the ground. The goal appears.\n40:25 Comment: Ramos from the ground. Pepe appears.\n40:27 Comment: The last one to play was an Eibar player.\n40:29 Comment: It was a throw-in after Ramos got into trouble locked up there next to the flag.\n40:34 Comment: Ramos who is calling for a foul Ricardo.\n40:36 Comment: He was asking for it in the Escalante action.\n40:38 Comment: The Argentine did not agree. But González González comes to talk to Sergio Ramos.\n40:41 Comment: After the captain of Real Madrid had turned to the linesman to complain about that foul that he had not signaled the ball.\n40:47 Comment: The throw-in still favored Real Madrid.\n40:50 Comment: I think it was not a foul.\n40:52 Comment: And Lucas asking.\n40:54 Comment: And Lucas asking for the ball in the other part of the field with the entire field of the game ahead of him.\n40:59 Comment: Totally just Lucas. So far from the game that it seems like he is not involved in the game.\n41:4 Comment: The thing is that both teams tilt completely towards the place where the ball is.\n41:8 Comment: 20 players gather there in 30 square meters.\n41:12 Comment: And on the opposite side, if someone remains static, they are totally alone.\n41:19 Comment: It seemed like he wasn't even participating in the game but Lucas was doing well.\n41:22 Comment: The center from the right very past.\n41:24 Comment: Pedro León picks up.\n41:25 Comment: Second attempt for the gunsmith painting.\n41:27 Comment: He faces Pedro León who steps into the area.\n41:29 Comment: He has the bicycle.\n41:30 Comment: Pedro León puts it at the far post.\n41:31 Comment: Rubén Peña was waiting for her in that area.\n41:34 Comment: The ball falls in front.\n41:35 Comment: Lucas Vázquez keeps it.\n41:37 Comment: Lucas has hurt himself but Asensio hits the ball and is now the one who leads the counterattack in a 4 for 4 for Real Madrid.\n41:43 Comment: Asensio opening.\n41:44 Comment: Face Benzema.\n41:46 Comment: Take advantage of the top to retreat.\n41:48 Comment: James for Asensio.\n41:49 Comment: Frame on the front.\n41:50 Comment: Frame!\n41:51 Comment: Close, close to the stick.\n41:52 Comment: Filled with intention.\n41:53 Comment: Marco Asensio's shot was filled with intention.\n41:55 Comment: What an easy shot.\n41:57 Comment: What good control.\n41:58 Comment: And what a way to take the shot.\n42:0 Comment: How naturally.\n42:2 Comment: Also putting it very close to the stick.\n42:6 Comment: We are facing Eibar's best minutes.\n42:9 Comment: But Real Madrid always manages to respond with a counterattack.\n42:13 Comment: With the intention of being respected.\n42:16 Comment: There was Zidane's gesture also asking his team to throw the ball to the right wing.\n42:21 Comment: And we must remember that in that counterattack.\n42:22 Comment: Pepe was waiting for Asensio on the left.\n42:25 Comment: The central defender who had risen to join in that action in the attack.\n42:30 Comment: Nacho's offensive adventure.\n42:33 Comment: Clear.\n42:35 Comment: Mauro dos Santos did

Real Madrid populated the center of the field very well to recover the ball.\n17:58 Comment: That punished Adrián a lot.\n18:0 Comment: And all those midfielders who contributed to the pressure when they got loose.\n18:5 Comment: They played really unleashed.\n18:10 Comment: To the point that the four goals seem like few due to the merits achieved with Real Madrid.\n18:18 Comment: He claimed a

is a reward for his decision.\n27:30 Comment: To arrive like a train to finish that ball.\n27:36 Comment: Beyond the comment.\n27:37 Comment: Or the analysis that has to do with achieving Eibar's goal.\n27:41 Comment: Before the action continues and this runs us over.\n27:43 Comment: Do you think Pedro León and Nacho are missing?\n27:45 Comment: I think the referee understands that Pedro León wants to measure more than hit.\n27:50 Comment: No?\n27:52 Comment: And he doesn't understand that there is an attack.\n27:55 Comment: There goes James.\n27:57 Comment: He puts it at the far post.\n27:59 Comment: Mariano Díaz entered with tremendous force.\n28:2 Comment: Very good.\n28:2 Comment: He went in to look for her.\n28:3 Comment: He couldn't specify.\n28:5 Comment: However.\n28:5

Comment: Indeed, Peña hits that ball with his pancreas.\n28:22 Comment: The only one who protested the action against Nacho was Sergio Ramos.\n28:25 Comment: And timidly to the line judge.\n28:29 Comment: Who was also the one in the front row watching the action.\n28:34 Comment: Isco is going to enter.\n28:35 Comment: So the man from Malaga will have another chance.\n28:37 Comment:

Comment: And it seems like it was enabled.\n28:50 Comment: So right that it was enabled.\n28:52 Comment: That was the feeling it gave me.\n28:55 Comment: The thing is that it is so difficult to measure the speeds found.\n29:0 Comment: And Isco is going to enter the action.\n29:2 Comment: In the next action.\n29:3 Comment: When the game stops.\n29:4 Comment: The ball goes out.\n29:5 Comment:

Comment: Pay more attention to the match against Naples next Wednesday.\n29:17 Comment: What is happening in the field.\n29:19 Comment: There were players on the field much more tired than Modric.\n29:22 Comment: For example James.\n29:24 Comment: James leaves.\n29:25 Comment: Real Madrid fans applaud him.\n29:26 Comment: You present here in Ipurua.\n29:28 Comment: The Colombian leaves.\n29:29 Comment: A goal.\n29:31 Comment: Actively participating in the first, in the second.\n29:33 Comment: And in the room.\n29:34 Comment: With that ball on the post.\n29:36 Comment: The one who enters the field of play.\n29:37 Comment: Isco.\n29:38 Comment: James' game was excellent.\n29:40 Comment: Excellent.\n29:41 Comment: Perhaps one of the most complete this season.\n29:44 Comment: Because he was in all of them.\n29:45 Comment: And he also gave a hand when it came to defending.\n29:48 Comment: James out.\n29:53 Comment: Inside Isco.\n29:54 Comment: Another change by Zinedine Zidane.\n29:59 Comment: In fact it is the third.\n30:0 Comment: They exhaust substitutions.\n30:2 Comment: Already thinking about dosing the game.\n30:4 Comment: And the efforts for upcoming

is.\n30:17 Comment: Exactly.\n30:18 Comment: And today Marcelo is not going to the interview after the game.\n30:21 Comment: Well.\n30:23 Comment: That will have to be seen.\n30:25 Comment: That.\n30:26 Comment: Get rid of your leg Mauro Santos.\n30:28 Comment: It's missing there.\n30:29 Comment: It is obvious that Marcelo has not played a single minute today.\n30:33 Comment: He will not be the designated footballer.\n30:35 Comment: I imagine.\n30:36 Comment: The point is that James does not complete the game.\n30:39 Comment: And in fact he has not played a full game since last December 10.\n30:43 Comment: The aforementioned match against Deportivo de La Coruña.\n30:45 Comment: Which on that occasion also served Real Madrid.\n30:47 Comment: To dose many efforts.\n30:49 Comment: And to rotate several starting players.\n30:52 Comment: That the change was James implies that Asensio is going to finish the match.\n30:56 Comment: You are in the same circumstance.\n30:58 Comment: But even more serious in quotes.\n31:1 Comment: A League match has not finished since matchday 4.\n31:5 Comment: We are talking about the month of September.\n31:7 Comment: And with the

    "summary": "The match between Eibar and Real Madrid unfolded with an electrifying atmosphere at the Ipurua Municipal Stadium. Both clubs entered the fixture with significant stakes – Eibar aiming to solidify their mid-table position and Real Madrid seeking to regain their top spot in La Liga following recent back-and-forths for the championship lead.\n\nFrom the opening whistle, Real Madrid, under Zinedine Zidane’s direction, applied a high-octane press against the hosts. Within the first few seconds, Karim Benzema and Nacho combined effectively, setting an early tempo that showcased Real Madrid’s intent.\n\nIn the very first minute, Real Madrid began orchestrating intricate plays. Nacho advanced up the left wing and sent a deep ball towards Marco Asensio who managed to keep possession after negating an initial challenge from Capa. The early signs were ominous for Eibar; Modric, Casemiro, James, and Benzema were already moving with intent, demonstrating the fluidity Zidane’s team was known for.\n\nWithin a couple of minutes, Real Madrid’s initial forays into Eibar’s defensive third seemed relentless, and James was integral in these early stages. His interplay with Danilo down the right was brisk and precise. It signaled Real Madrid’s intention to keep the intensity high against Eibar.\n\nDespite the early ascendancy, Eibar weren’t willing participants in a one-sided showpiece. In the initial exchanges, they managed to clear the ball and venture into Real Madrid’s half. However, their advances were often intercepted or nullified by a disciplined Real Madrid defense, marshaled by Ramos and Pepe. This pattern established early dominance by the visitors but highlighted Eibar’s challenges to disrupt Real Madrid's rhythm.\n\nA minute-long silence observed initially was a mark of respect from the players for the passing of legendary figure João Havelange, adding a somber yet respectful note to proceedings.\n\nAs Eibar attempted to break into Real Madrid's box through quick transitions, it became apparent they would struggle against the fast-reacting visitors. Real Madrid’s defensive setup absorbed Eibar’s advances with relative ease in the early moments before launching quick counter-attacks.\n\nIn minute 13, Real Madrid’s superior play bore fruit. An efficiently worked piece of possession play saw Marco Asensio and James combine down the left, culminating in James threading a beautiful ball that made its way to Benzema. Although Eibar’s defense had a moment of hesitation, Benzema was quick enough to capitalize, slotting a rebound past Joel for the opening goal. The early lead set the tone for the visiting side.\n\nReal Madrid's performance throughout the first half displayed a mixture of pressing intensity, tight defensive work, and attacking prowess that left little room for Eibar to maneuver. Zidane’s men generated multiple scoring opportunities, with the nimble interplay between Asensio, Lucas Vázquez, and Benzema their consistent modus operandi.\n\nEibar managed to create scarce opportunities but struggled to turn these chances into threatening attempts on Keylor Navas' goal. An indicative scuffle late in the half saw Pedro León deliver a dangerous ball into the box which Eibar, despite their best efforts, couldn't convert due to an ever-vigilant Real Madrid backline headed by Ramos and Pepe.\n\nAs the half-hour mark approached, Real Madrid continued to exhibit their startling efficiency. Patient buildup play involving Modric and James allowed Benzema to link up varied attacking moves. Then, a free-kick situation arose on the right side; James, with characteristic precision, delivered an inviting ball that was met at the far post by Benzema, slotting home with a deft touch for Real Madrid’s second of the match.\n\nThe third goal arrived soon after in the 29th minute. Luka Modric's perceptive pass found Benzema out wide, who displayed excellent wing play by crossing into the area where James was on hand to score at the first post. This established a comprehensive 3-0 lead before half-time, sending Eibar into the break with a mountain to climb.\n\nWith the second half whistle, both teams resumed without any changes. Real Madrid maintained the same tactical blueprint, with Benzema integral in sparring Eibar’s defenses. Within minutes, Real Madrid resumed their fluid attacking play. A notable early chance saw Asensio almost set up Benzema again but was thwarted by quick defensive cover from Joel.\n\nEibar’s perseverance wasn’t without brief moments of success. In an attempt to gain a stronghold, they pushed forward with intensity but fell short against Real Madrid’s disciplined organization. The struggles were compounded further when Antonio Luna had to leave the field due to an injury, creating further headaches for Eibar’s setup.\n\nThe 59th minute showcased further Real Madrid brilliance. A sublime ball from Benzema released Asensio on a solo run, who, upon noting James' supporting run to his left, unselfishly set up the Colombian. James' strike careened off the post, only for Asensio to complete the move and net Real Madrid’s fourth goal of the night.\n\nEibar tried to shift gears, making several substitutions to rejuvenate their lineup and introduce fresh impetus. Rubén Peña’s relentless energy from the left offered some hope. In the 71st minute, after a contentious tussle in the box, Pedro León’s brilliant cross found Peña, who managed to direct the ball into the net with an unorthodox back portion of his body, thereby reducing the deficit to 1-4.\n\nThe final set of substitutions included bringing on Isco and Mariano. This maintained Real Madrid’s momentum and tactical advantage, ensuring no relaxation in intensifying efforts from the Eibar side. Mariano’s presence upfront emphasized the visitors’ attacking intent even in the latter phase of the match.\n\nThroughout the remaining minutes, Real Madrid displayed control and composed defending, exemplified by Pepe’s assured performance. The Spanish capital club saw off the final whistle with poise, dampening Eibar's hopes of a historic comeback. The match culminated with Real Madrid securing a decisive 4-1 victory, which reaffirmed their competing prowess amid tight league standings. The whistle from González marked the end of an impressive outing for Zidane’s men, complete with tactical discipline, exquisite interplay, and match-defining precision from Benzema and his allies."
