Musaquio, who have already played many times on this stage.\n12:36 Comment: Cheryshev has also done it but for very different reasons.\n12:38 Comment: Because it was part of the discipline of Real Madrid.\n12:41 Comment: On the other hand, in the years he has been away.\n12:43 Comment: Ricardo has never been able to play on this stage or face his former team.\n12:47 Comment: No, because the transfer clause prevented him from playing against his former team, against Real Madrid.\n12:51 Comment: This time it has sold 7 and a half million.\n12:54 Comment: This is what Villarreal has paid, which has signed him for the next 5 seasons after a controversial episode.\n13:0 Comment: The lineup with Benítez's Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey match against Cádiz.\n13:5 Comment: That sanction by which Real Madrid was sanctioned for improper alignment.\n13:10 Comment: A sanction precisely in one match.\n13:13 Comment: And then the Villarreal shirt.\n13:14 Comment: Copa del Rey semi-final against Barça.\n13:16 Comment: I couldn't play that game at the Ramón de Carranza.\n13:19 Comment: He did so and from there a controversial action arose.\n13:22 Comment: A controversial match in which Denis Cheryshev would no longer wear the Real Madrid shirt.\n13:29 Comment: Bruno receives, turns around.\n13:31 Comment: He has the option on Cheryshev's left.\n13:33 Comment: He was looking for the vertical delivery towards Sansone's career.\n13:35 Comment: Real Madrid recovers.\n13:37 Comment: Ronaldo is surrounded by players dressed in yellow.\n13:39 Comment: Toni Kroos finds the exit with an accurate touch.\n13:41 Comment: This is Marcelo.\n13:42 Comment: But this is the advantage.\n13:44 Comment: It has a lot of people.\n13:46 Comment: When you have the ball in the center of the field, when you lose the ball, they are still there.\n13:49 Comment: Then you can press to get the ball back to you.\n13:55 Comment: Or you get the ball back, rather.\n13:57 Comment: Kroos opening. Marcelo's center is coming.\n13:59 Comment: He puts it on 12 with too much power.\n14:3 Comment: He exceeded that pitch, that delivery.\n14:5 Comment: Marcelo Vieira.\n14:7 Comment: It will be a goal kick for Villarreal.\n14:9 Comment: Close to the first quarter of an hour of the game.\n14:11 Comment: Down the corner.\n14:12 Comment: What is it, Ricardo?\n14:13 Comment: For now, the two coaches are standing.\n14:15 Comment: Fran Escriba giving constant instructions to his players, especially positioning.\n14:19 Comment: Warning of the movements above the Real Madrid forwards.\n14:22 Comment: Also Zinedine Zidane, we saw him now in the foreground.\n14:24 Comment: Trying to place his players in the center of the field.\n14:27 Comment: Especially that position of James, who has started on the right wing.\n14:30 Comment: That of Kovacic, who has started on the left side of Toni Kroos's position.\n14:34 Comment: Rafael Varane giving up a header for Ramos.\n14:38 Comment: What a mistake by Ramos in that delivery.\n14:40 Comment: What a waste.\n14:41 Comment: But Ramos in that delivery seemed to be looking for Kovacic.\n14:43 Comment: No, Cristiano Ronaldo finally keeps it.\n14:45 Comment: Ronaldo fakes and plays short for Toni Kroos.\n14:50 Comment: Kroos insists on the change of orientation.\n14:53 Comment: Very imprecise sending by the German footballer.\n14:58 Comment: Which translates into a new goal kick for Villarreal.\n15:1 Comment: And at the moment, little participation from Cristiano Ronaldo.\n15:5 Comment: José, you are naming him too little because that number 7, the Portuguese footballer,\n15:9 Comment: He is not against the game.\n15:10 Comment: He is not feeling comfortable in this first quarter of an hour of the game.\n15:13 Comment: No, it's hard to find a place right now, as we talked about before.\n15:17 Comment: Because there is very little space.\n15:19 Comment: And of course, Madrid is starting to move the ball a little faster.\n15:23 Comment: Ronaldo can find this site.\n15:25 Comment: But as it is at the moment with Villarreal so tight there with the lines,\n15:31 Comment: It is very difficult to find a place.\n15:33 Comment: Therefore, perhaps at this moment it is Danilo and Marcelo who can find this most powerful place.\n15:38 Comment: And then, when afterwards, there will be a little more space for Bale and Ronaldo to look for the ball.\n15:48 Comment: Too strong. Rafael Varane's long throw was too powerful.\n15:54 Comment: New inaccuracy in distribution by Real Madrid.\n15:58 Comment: Which becomes a throw-in for Mario Gaspar.\n16:1 Comment: And on Villarreal's part, okay, they are playing, yes.\n16:6 Comment: But the time has not yet come.\n16:8 Comment: He has not created, he has not shot at the door once.\n16:10 Comment: So, of course, it's one thing to play.\n16:12 Comment: But I think they will also have to arrive at least a couple of times to feel completely in the game.\n16:22 Comment: Marcelo challenging Samu Castillejo one-on-one.\n16:26 Comment: About to recover Villarreal. Toni Kroos avoids it.\n16:29 Comment: Mateo Kovacic distributes.\n16:31 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo appears with his back to the goal.\n16:33 Comment: 40 meters from the target.\n16:35 Comment: Kovacic delivers for Varane.\n16:38 Comment: That is not understood with Danilo.\n16:40 Comment: And again an inaccuracy, a lack of finesse in delivery.\n16:44 Comment: It translates into a loss for Real Madrid.\n16:46 Comment: Yes Yes.\n16:47 Comment: But many times you also have to look at these games as a...\n16:52 Comment: Beyond what we are seeing from the first part.\n16:54 Comment: Also sometimes you have to invest, we can say.\n16:57 Comment: Because the first part is something, you know, that is very difficult.\n17:0 Comment: Because everyone is 100% physically.\n17:2 Comment: But of course, the more you have the ball, the more you make the opposing team run.\n17:6 Comment: Maybe this is a game.\n17:8 Comment: But what you invest in the first half can turn into chances or perhaps goals.\n17:13 Comment: In the second half, especially in the last 20 or 25 minutes.\n17:16 Comment: And there was some murmuring, huh?\n17:18 Comment: After three errors in the pass.\n17:20 Comment: After three mistakes like Danilo's at the time when he didn't understand his partner.\n17:24 Comment: Murmur in the Bernabéu that he is not comfortable at this start of the game.\n17:28 Comment: Ronaldo tries to participate in the game starting from the right.\n17:33 Comment: There's Ronaldo. He combined with Benzema.\n17:35 Comment: Once again the 7th gave way to Mateo Kovacic.\n17:38 Comment: Facing Marcelo on the left. Find space for the center.\n17:41 Comment: Marcelo puts it with a thread. Second stick. Saltabell puts his head in.\n17:44 Comment: Ahhh! He was trying to score Benzema.\n17:47 Comment: Sergio Asenjo took it over the line.\n17:50 Comment: The best of the match. Minute 17. We point it to Benzema.\n17:54 Comment: The Frenchman's very forced close-up shot.\n17:57 Comment: Asenjo took it out with a tremendous hand.\n18:0 Comment: Great stop. But it started with a good center again from Marcelo.\n18:4 Comment: Before it was Danilo's.\n18:6 Comment: And I repeat again.\n18:7 Comment: I think that in the first part it is the two of them who have to give the extra out there.\n18:12 Comment: Because in the center... very complicated.\n18:15 Comment: We are seeing that launch repeated, that extension, that hybrid.\n18:20 Comment: Between a pass and a header on goal by Gareth Bale.\n18:23 Comment: After Marcelo's cross, Benzema came to touch it.\n18:26 Comment: That didn't end comfortably. Which ended between Mario Gaspar and Musaqui.\n18:29 Comment: And from there came the cushioned ball from Ricardo so that he ended up hitting Asenjo.\n18:34 Comment: And what a way for the war guard to get that ball out.\n18:35 Comment: In the first clear of Real Madrid.\n18:40 Comment: That has minutes, that has moments of stress.\n18:42 Comment: At the moment Villarreal is defending itself well.\n18:44 Comment: Located on the game field.\n18:46 Comment: But without worrying Kiko Casillas.\n18:51 Comment: Mateo Musaqui raises his head.\n18:53 Comment: Keep in mind Jonathan Dos Santos.\n18:55 Comment: Jonathan for Trigueros. Of the evolution of Talaverano.\n18:57 Comment: Distributed by Jonathan Dos Santos.\n18:59 Comment: Again on the left.\n19:0 Comment: Trigueros and Jonathan. And Trigueros. One more time.\n19:3 Comment: There is Trigueros who is encouraged. Trigueros hits him.\n19:4 Comment: Kiko Casillas' low shot close to the goal.\n19:10 Comment: It seems like it doesn't hit him at all well.\n19:12 Comment: That hits it bitten halfway between the instep and the inside.\n19:15 Comment: And hence Manu Trigueros' shot did not have any major complications for Casillas.\n19:20 Comment: But he reached the edge of the area to finish the play.\n19:23 Comment: That's what we asked for before, right?\n19:26 Comment: Try to directly replicate Real Madrid.\n19:28 Comment: Bale was looking for the sending of Ramos.\n19:30 Comment: He came out of his goal to clear a header from Asenjo.\n19:34 Comment: Good drop shot from Ronaldo.\n19:37 Comment: Marcelo Vieira cannot prosper in that action.\n19:40 Comment: Recovery of Villarreal trying to set up the counterattack with Bruno.\n19:44 Comment: Bruno tempers playing in the back.\n19:47 Comment: Towards Mario Gaspar and this one even further back for Mateo Musaquio.\n19:51 Comment: Trigueros.\n19:54 Comment: Jonathan.\n19:56 Comment: Jonathan Dos Santos was given for José Ángel.\n19:59 Comment: Once again Trigueros appearing free of surveillance in the center of the field.\n20:4 Comment: Bruno.\n20:7 Comment: And what we talked about before finding space there for, especially for Bale and Cristiano,\n20:15 Comment: It goes for James too, right?\n20:17 Comment: Because James is playing as a midfielder.\n20:19 Comment: He's doing it, without the ball.\n20:21 Comment: We see it here.\n20:22 Comment: Offensively he also still has to find a place to look for the ball\n20:27 Comment: that can do one on one and finish the play.\n20:31 Comment: I mean, this first part is surely going to be a game that is going to be very difficult.\n20:33 Comment: And the second part is surely going to be quite complicated, right?\n20:36 Comment: Then, throughout the game, there will surely be a little more space for both teams,\n20:43 Comment: especially for equipment that has seen less wear.\n20:47 Comment: Benzema intensifies the pressure until he forces Victor Ruiz to make an error that throws him directly out.\n20:53 Comment: And the one who was asking for it was Trigueros.\n20:56 Comment: In that position between the lines behind Kroos, he now became desperate with his teammates because the ball was not reaching him.\n21:1 Comment: Just at the moment when I saw that it was a goal.\n21:2 Comment: Just at the moment in which we see that action of Trigueros with James Rodríguez.\n21:5 Comment: He put his hand in.\n21:6 Comment: If the referee points it out, I think she deserves a warning.\n21:10 Comment: In the end, at the moment we have no cards and very few fouls.\n21:14 Comment: Yes, what we talked about is that Casemiro is not here today, this position.\n21:18 Comment: I think Kroos is the one who is there most times as the defensive midfielder.\n21:22 Comment: But of course, as he is a player who wants to move forward, he has a tendency, there will be moments where there is space between the lines,\n21:31 Comment: between the two center backs and the midfielders, as we have seen in this play where the ball did not reach Trigueros.\n21:41 Comment: Did James's action seem yellow to you?\n21:47 Comment: It was a 50-50. I think he is one of those people who say he serves, yes.\n21:52 Comment: If he doesn't serve, nothing happens either.\n21:54 Comment: So far I think there has been very little for the referee.\n21:59 Comment: It has been a very difficult match.\n22:1 Comment: In this sense it has been very calm for him.\n22:6 Comment: Mateo Kovacic delivers back to Rafael Varane.\n22:10 Comment: Ramos insists on the left of the team led by Zidane.\n22:15 Comment: Marcelo Kovacic to Chucho Jonathan dos Santos.\n22:19 Comment: Kroos appears.\n22:20 Comment: Good ball from Kroos on the rise of Marcelo who is going to center again.\n22:23 Comment: He puts it first.\n22:24 Comment: That center of Marcelo's was full of intention for a friend or an enemy to touch.\n22:29 Comment: And ended up inside.\n22:31 Comment: Before that happened, Mateo Musaquio took it for a corner.\n22:34 Comment: No, it's a great center. The first one is passed there.\n22:38 Comment: With that speed it is anyone who touches the ball and you don't know where the ball is going.\n22:43 Comment: It can go inside or above.\n22:45 Comment: Kroos serves. Rafael Varane appeared strongly at the near post.\n22:49 Comment: The action ends in nothing. Goal kick for Villarreal.\n22:52 Comment: That's what coaches often say, hey, when you get there low, strong, strong because anyone who touches the ball can pass by him.\n22:59 Comment: Absolutely anything can happen.\n23:2 Comment: It is offered in the short Musaquio and Víctor Ruiz.\n23:12 Comment: The ball has not left the area.\n23:13 Comment: So we will have to repeat the serve.\n23:16 Comment: Sine qua non condition for this goal kick to be regulated.\n23:22 Comment: In this case, the ball leaves the area before a field player touches it.\n23:27 Comment: As Asenjo was the one who served.\n23:29 Comment: The goalkeeper Palentino opts to move long.\n23:32 Comment: Real Madrid recovers.\n23:33 Comment: There's Ronaldo. Bruno jumps on him.\n23:35 Comment: Ball to Musaquio who secures it with his goalkeeper.\n23:41 Comment: Opening of Asenjo. Samu Castillejo kills her with his chest.\n23:44 Comment: Castillejo with Bruno who prolongs how James Rodríguez would have been seen arriving in the rearview mirror.\n23:50 Comment: Cheryshev turns around and throws José Ángel into attack.\n23:54 Comment: Inside the area, Sansone is already waiting for you.\n23:56 Comment: That should temper that exit.\n23:59 Comment: Slow it down in a way. Secure the pass José Ángel.\n24:2 Comment: The ball has reached Bruno.\n24:5 Comment: There's Bruno's previous play.\n24:10 Comment: It was a play in the center of the field.\n24:12 Comment: There you can see the difference sometimes between playing with one touch or two touches.\n24:17 Comment: Because two touches yes. It seems like it's a quick game.\n24:20 Comment: But sometimes you need a touch.\n24:22 Comment: Recovery of Trigueros. Opening to the left side.\n24:25 Comment: Here is Sansone who steps into the area.\n24:27 Comment: Sansone continues to bargain himself.\n24:29 Comment: He missed the ball on that bicycle attempt.\n24:31 Comment: And now the replica is the one handled by Real Madrid.\n24:34 Comment: Build through the center.\n24:36 Comment: Oh surprise. Danilo.\n24:39 Comment: Danilo delivers for Benzema.\n24:41 Comment: Benzema again for Danilo who appears as a left winger.\n24:43 Comment: Danilo puts it first. He manages to clear Victor Ruiz.\n24:46 Comment: Bruno's shot to get the ball out. To get the ball out of the area.\n24:50 Comment: Trigueros with class, with criteria for Denis Cheryshev.\n24:53 Comment: Benzema appears in the defensive effort to block Cheryshev's pass.\n24:57 Comment: It will be a throw-in for Villarreal.\n25:0 Comment: It seems that Danilo has heard. It's about moving forward but I almost buried it.\n25:5 Comment: There we have precisely Danilo in the replay being the footballer who stops Sansone's advance.\n25:11 Comment: From there it is when he becomes emboldened, when he takes a run and appears on the attack.\n25:16 Comment: Sometimes it's okay because the defense that stops the opposing team's play is already racing forward.\n25:22 Comment: So sometimes it is better for him to continue and then someone else, perhaps a midfielder now, stays in his position.\n25:29 Comment: Ronaldo combines with Bale. Again on the 7th. Nearby James Rodríguez.\n25:34 Comment: It goes to the Colombian who distributes to Mateo Kovacic.\n25:38 Comment: Marcellus. He moves very close to Marcelo Gareth Bale. However, Kovacic keeps it.\n25:45 Comment: Driving by the Croatian trying to enable Danilo on the right.\n25:48 Comment: The advantage, however, is for José Ángel who lets it out.\n25:51 Comment: In that duel of former Loporto footballers.\n25:54 Comment: Ball for Asenjo. Ball for Villarreal.\n25:57 Comment: It's already around half an hour into the game, still goalless at the Santiago Bernabéu.\n26:2 Comment: You were talking about players, former Loporto players.\n26:5 Comment: Also James Rodríguez but he did not coincide, for example with José Ángel, with Cote.\n26:9 Comment: In the Portuguese group I mean.\n26:12 Comment: Which in the case of the Villarreal full-back still belongs to Loporto if I'm not mistaken.\n26:17 Comment: Yeah.\n26:18 Comment: If that's not the case.\n26:20 Comment: If not, Ricardo, tell me.\n26:22 Comment: I think so. I think it still belongs to Loporto.\n26:24 Comment: This accession is not part of the Portuguese team's plans in recent years.\n26:29 Comment: Benzema is preparing for the shot.\n26:31 Comment: Ronaldo is close. He receives the 7 already in an unfavorable position.\n26:35 Comment: He ended up losing in the presence of Castillejo.\n26:37 Comment: And he gets angry with the circumstance, with the situation.\n26:40 Comment: Maybe even with Cristiano Ronaldo Ricardo himself.\n26:43 Comment: Yes. And also the murmur in the Bernabéu stands.\n26:46 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo is not comfortable.\n26:48 Comment: Things are not going well for him in the game.\n26:49 Comment: Things are not going well for him in these first 27 minutes of the game.\n26:52 Comment: At the moment the Portuguese star of Real Madrid is quite dull.\n26:55 Comment: Surely Benzema's pass to Michael was not what Ronaldo expected.\n26:59 Comment: The ball was very much on top of him. He found himself surrounded by rivals.\n27:2 Comment: But there is a moment when it seems that he ignores the play when he sees that he is not going to be able to shoot.\n27:6 Comment: Yes that's it. Because he brings the ball to him.\n27:9 Comment: Of course, then by the time he receives the ball there are already two or three on him.\n27:14 Comment: You have to go before to make a wall or something like that.\n27:19 Comment: There are more possibilities. Even if the opponent has more people in that area.\n27:22 Comment: Jonathan dos Santos changes everything.\n27:27 Comment: Good ball for Cote to go up accompanied by Denis Cheryshev.\n27:30 Comment: Receive integration into Russian. Hand in hand with Bale.\n27:34 Comment: Once again José Ángel prepares the center. In Danilo's face.\n27:37 Comment: Inside ball for Cheryshev who wants to center.\n27:40 Comment: Cheryshev is handed over again to José Ángel. He is a two for one very close to the corner.\n27:44 Comment: He looks for the exit and finds it in the support of Trigueros.\n27:47 Comment: Castillejo. Good heel.\n27:49 Comment: Cheryshev. Hand up from Casilla.\n27:53 Comment: Good tap by the Real Madrid goalkeeper to send that shot by Denis Cheryshev to a corner.\n27:58 Comment: After a very good action put together over slow fire, playing little by little by Fran Escrivá's Villarreal.\n28:4 Comment: Yes, touching two or three times and then a pass, and then a pass to first and a throw.\n28:10 Comment: When there is no space, sometimes even when you get close to the area you have to play a touch.\n28:16 Comment: It's the way because...\n28:18 Comment: Up to two touches...\n28:21 Comment: ...slows the game down a bit when everyone is so close.\n28:25 Comment: Shot from the corner looking for the far post.\n28:28 Comment: Chilena's shot, Nicola Sansone's scissors shot.\n28:32 Comment: He goes to one side of the Real Madrid goal.\n28:35 Comment: New notice from Villarreal.\n28:37 Comment: That foreshortened shot that Sansone ended up completing was tremendously complicated.\n28:44 Comment: He has scored more difficult goals.\n28:46 Comment: Just a few days ago, too.\n28:48 Comment: It seems like he likes those, the difficult ones.\n28:52 Comment: Good try by Sansone.\n28:54 Comment: Villarreal's two best approaches.\n28:56 Comment: Ricardo in just a minute.\n28:58 Comment: And forcing Níscher and Shefaquico Casilla at the first opportunity.\n29:2 Comment: Putting the huy in the throats of the fans in this one from Sansone.\n29:5 Comment: Well, Villarreal already has the two best opportunities of the match.\n29:9 Comment: Marcelo stops, continues, Marcelo puts it on.\n29:12 Comment: Cut, control and combine.\n29:14 Comment: Mario Gaspar.\n29:16 Comment: Castillejo is wrong.\n29:17 Comment: Challenging James Rodríguez in speed.\n29:19 Comment: That means the ball goes back to Real Madrid.\n29:27 Comment: Marcellus.\n29:28 Comment: James asks for it from space.\n29:29 Comment: They give it to them.\n29:30 Comment: Control of the Colombian's race.\n29:33 Comment: She appears at the intersection and Mateo Musaqui loses her.\n29:35 Comment: There's James' center looking for Ronaldo.\n29:37 Comment: The goalkeeper catches.\n29:39 Comment: Catch Sergio Asenjo in action.\n29:41 Comment: Invalidated I think due to lack, Ricardo.\n29:43 Comment: Yes, for a foul on José Ángel.\n29:45 Comment: The side claimed it.\n29:46 Comment: The side, Villarreal's Gijones.\n29:48 Comment: Also Mateo Musaqui and Víctor Ruiz.\n29:50 Comment: González points it out.\n29:51 Comment: So that shot by Cristiano Ronaldo was worthless.\n29:54 Comment: Now the Portuguese speaks with the Leonese referee explaining the action.\n29:58 Comment: Well, opportunity for the Portuguese who remains without scoring among the dangerous opportunities.\n30:4 Comment: I insist, because it was cancelled.\n30:6 Comment: It's no longer that Ronaldo explained the action to the referee González.\n30:10 Comment: The thing is that I directly invited him to watch the league well as soon as the game is over.\n30:14 Comment: Because he said, on TV.\n30:15 Comment: It is where you will realize what has really happened.\n30:18 Comment: No, it's not a foul.\n30:19 Comment: But I think it should be highlighted.\n30:21 Comment: I think James is doing a job.\n30:25 Comment: What is a...\n30:27 Comment: DMing isn't your thing, is it?\n30:28 Comment: Because he is a very offensive player.\n30:30 Comment: But we have seen here recover a ball that was lost and make a very good cross.\n30:35 Comment: And I think he's really doing a lot.\n30:40 Comment: Or more than a lot to be able to get into this team.\n30:43 Comment: Now he has had two games in a row.\n30:45 Comment: And I think it's a very good response to his coach.\n30:50 Comment: Hey, maybe that's not my thing.\n30:52 Comment: Being in the midfield, recovering balls.\n30:54 Comment: But I can do it.\n30:55 Comment: I am willing to do it to find a place in the team.\n30:58 Comment: You like that as a coach.\n31:1 Comment: Have this attitude, right?\n31:3 Comment: The one who is hugging now is Real Madrid.\n31:5 Comment: Bale had focused.\n31:6 Comment: He cleared Villarreal's defense.\n31:7 Comment: And the white team immediately sets up a new attack action.\n31:10 Comment: Marcelo puts in the center from the left.\n31:12 Comment: A defender has touched.\n31:13 Comment: The advantage goes to Asenjo.\n31:14 Comment: That he takes out quickly looking for Sansone.\n31:16 Comment: In a 2 for 1 situation with the Real Madrid centre-backs.\n31:19 Comment: Ramos nods.\n31:23 Comment: The Santiago Bernabéu appreciates that touch with the head.\n31:27 Comment: And start again for Real Madrid.\n31:29 Comment: Kroos.\n31:32 Comment: James.\n31:37 Comment: Combine James with Marcelo.\n31:39 Comment: Castillejo watches over him.\n31:42 Comment: Toni Kroos.\n31:43 Comment: Hitting zone.\n31:44 Comment: Combine with Benzema.\n31:45 Comment: Ronaldo.\n31:46 Comment: Above.\n31:47 Comment: Above is Cristiano Ronaldo's shot.\n31:49 Comment: They added one more speed to the combination.\n31:52 Comment: Three top footballers played.\n31:54 Comment: And there Michael appeared, the space for Cristiano Ronaldo to shoot.\n31:58 Comment: Furthermore, the pass to Benzema was to overcome Ronaldo's line.\n32:2 Comment: Then Benzema could leave the ball facing Cristiano to shoot at goal.\n32:7 Comment: Of course, the ball is always passed closer.\n32:10 Comment: Most of the time Ronaldo's line.\n32:12 Comment: People receive with their backs to the opposite.\n32:16 Comment: And this gets more complicated.\n32:18 Comment: If we do not take into account the previous action invalidated due to lack.\n32:21 Comment: This is practically Ricardo's first for Cristiano in the game.\n32:24 Comment: Yeah.\n32:25 Comment: Watch out for Marcelo.\n32:26 Comment: The Carioca side entering from the left.\n32:29 Comment: Another corner and there are already a few for Real Madrid.\n32:32 Comment: I was also going to tell you that in the case of Cristiano Ronaldo, the Villarreal fans will say that we should not call bad weather.\n32:37 Comment: Because it was commented that he was appearing little.\n32:39 Comment: And so far the last two have already been.\n32:41 Comment: For that number 7 of Real Madrid.\n32:44 Comment: Kroos at the launch again.\n32:45 Comment: Varane loves her.\n32:46 Comment: Ramos loves her.\n32:47 Comment: Benzema wants it.\n32:48 Comment: Ronaldo loves her.\n32:49 Comment: Bale wants it.\n32:50 Comment: Short service cleared by Castillejo.\n32:52 Comment: The rejection may be for Kovacic.\n32:53 Comment: No.\n32:54 Comment: It is left to Cheryshev who wants to set up the counterattack.\n32:56 Comment: Try to combine Denis Cheryshev in the center with Victor Ruiz.\n33:2 Comment: Who was the one who supported him most closely.\n33:4 Comment: The ball goes away.\n33:5 Comment: Throw-in\n33:11 Comment: Trigueros.\n33:13 Comment: Jose Angel.\n33:14 Comment: Pressed Cote by Mateo Kovacic.\n33:17 Comment: Even so, Villarreal keeps the ball in its possession.\n33:20 Comment: If he can't go out on the left, he will try on the right with Samu Castillejo.\n33:25 Comment: The man from Malaga facing Marcelo.\n33:28 Comment: James Rodríguez comes to the aid.\n33:31 Comment: Sliding down and getting that ball.\n33:34 Comment: James appeared to snatch the ball from Samu Castillejo.\n33:40 Comment: And end up forcing this throw-in.\n33:42 Comment: By the way, José.\n33:44 Comment: Now James leaning on the left profile.\n33:47 Comment: To the left of Kroos.\n33:48 Comment: Leaving Kovacic on the right side.\n33:51 Comment: Contrary to how the Real Madrid game has started to play.\n34:1 Comment: José Ángel takes it calmly.\n34:3 Comment: Who is in charge of taking the throw for Villarreal.\n34:5 Comment: For now, Zidane and Escribá like what they see.\n34:7 Comment: They don't have much luck.\n34:9 Comment: They don't look happy or satisfied.\n34:12 Comment: Especially Zinedine Zidane.\n34:13 Comment: In the case of Frank Escribá he maintains tranquility.\n34:16 Comment: Seeing the layout of your team.\n34:18 Comment: And the two opportunities he has had in these last moments.\n34:24 Comment: Kovacic.\n34:25 Comment: First for Toni Kroos.\n34:28 Comment: James Rodríguez starts.\n34:30 Comment: Marcelo accompanies him.\n34:31 Comment: There appears the left back of Real Madrid.\n34:34 Comment: Cristiano Ronaldo.\n34:35 Comment: Marcelo again.\n34:37 Comment: James combines with Kroos.\n34:39 Comment: He asks Danilo on the right.\n34:41 Comment: Good entry on the 23rd.\n34:42 Comment: Excellent control.\n34:43 Comment: He hits him with his left.\n34:44 Comment: He encouraged himself with his less capable leg.\n34:46 Comment: That was not a center.\n34:47 Comment: That was a shot.\n34:50 Comment: The Villarreal defense managed to block it.\n34:52 Comment: The leader of the Santander League is on the charge again.\n35:0 Comment: Marcelo challenging Castillejo one for one.\n35:3 Comment: He leaves her behind.\n35:5 Comment: Good combination.\n35:6 Comment: Ramos who partners with James.\n35:8 Comment: Toni Kroos hits him.\n35:10 Comment: Manu Trigueros manages to block.\n35:12 Comment: Villarreal recovers.\n35:13 Comment: Who wants to launch the counterattack quickly.\n35:15 Comment: With who? With Sansone.\n35:16 Comment: Sansone watched by Varane.\n35:18 Comment: Good extension by Sansone.\n35:19 Comment: Who wants to take advantage of Cheryshev's speed.\n35:21 Comment: Toni Kroos throws himself to the ground to secure the position for Real Madrid.\n35:25 Comment: But.\n35:26 Comment: Good counterattack play by Villarreal.\n35:28 Comment: Kroos very good.\n35:30 Comment: He has fulfilled the position there.\n35:32 Comment: Lowered as center back.\n35:35 Comment: Real Madrid.\n35:37 Comment: Ronaldo starting from the right.\n35:40 Comment: Look for a centered position.\n35:42

Trigueros.\n35:53 Comment: This is Jonathan dos Santos.\n35:55 Comment: Mario Gaspar joins the attack.\n35:56 Comment: Mario delivers to Samu Castillejo.\n36:0 Comment: Samu stops.\n36:1 Comment: Real Madrid ends up recovering positions in defense.\n36:5 Comment: There's Bruno.\n36:6 Comment: Bruno for Trigueros who wants to go around the ground.\n36:8 Comment: Trigueros timidly claims foul.\n36:11 Comment: The Talavera footballer does not indicate González González.\n36:21 Comment: James.\n36:25 Comment: Vertically Marcelo looking for Gareth Bale.\n36:28 Comment: The last one to play was Mario Gaspar.\n36:30 Comment: That he doesn't agree too much with the assistant's decision.\n36:32 Comment: Real Madrid plays again.\n36:34 Comment: Sergio Ramos plays again.\n36:36 Comment: Quick for Mateo Kovacic.\n36:38 Comment: Benzema moves ahead.\n36:40 Comment: Also Christian.\n36:44 Comment: C for Kovacic for James.\n36:45 Comment: Benzema connecting again with James Rodríguez.\n36:47 Comment: Villarreal well planted.\n36:49 Comment: Preventing these combinations from prospering by local players.\n36:54 Comment: Yes, but also that play Bale made that Benzema was in the same place as Marcelo.\n36:58 Comment: So, three on top of the two.\n37:1 Comment: And the last.\n37:2 Comment: So, three on top of each other.\n37:8 Comment: But there is still very little space.\n37:10 Comment: Villarreal is at 20-25 meters.\n37:14 Comment: Bale is encouraged by that cross shot.\n37:18 Comment: Another option that Real Madrid has not yet explored excessively.\n37:21 Comment: If you can't reach the goal by combining.\n37:23 Comment: Why not try it with a shot from medium or long distance?\n37:27 Comment: There Gareth Bale hit him too cross with his left foot.\n37:30 Comment: It will be a goal kick for Villarreal.\n37:32 Comment: This is how the game the other day in Barcelona against Espanyol opened.\n37:38 Comment: A shot from outside.\n37:40 Comment: A little lucky.\n37:42 Comment: James was brought between two adversaries.\n37:45 Comment: But then it hit well.\n37:47 Comment: Even the team ahead.\n37:50 Comment: As you know, the first goal in soccer is very important.\n37:55 Comment: Samu Castillejo called for a foul.\n37:57 Comment: The referee said no.\n37:59 Comment: Toni Kroos plays for Real Madrid.\n38:0 Comment: Ronaldinho asks for it on the right.\n38:2 Comment: Also Danilo.\n38:4 Comment: The side appears.\n38:5 Comment: Danilo comes in.\n38:6 Comment: Again for Kroos.\n38:8 Comment: Stretching on the left James Rodríguez.\n38:10 Comment: The Cúcuta player could put the player in the center.\n38:12 Comment: And James puts it.\n38:14 Comment: Straight into Sergio Asenjo's gloves.\n38:21 Comment: The Villarreal goalkeeper quickly takes him to José Ángel's location.\n38:25 Comment: Cheryshev.\n38:27 Comment: He relies on Victor Ruiz.\n38:29 Comment: This one hits the center for Bruno.\n38:30 Comment: Who finally reaches\n38:31 Comment: He takes Santos.\n38:32 Comment: Trigueros.\n38:33 Comment: Good oriented control.\n38:34 Comment: He puts it for Samsone.\n38:35 Comment: That he is going to step into the

counterattack.\n38:43 Comment: But he didn't find the space, the opportunity, the moment to finish.\n38:47 Comment: The moment to conclude that good action as an attacker.\n38:50 Comment: Yes, because the last pass to Sansone.\n38:52 Comment: A little too long.\n38:54 Comment: So it's not enough to have a good time in the middle.\n38:57 Comment: But the last pass to Sansone.\n38:59 Comment: A little long.\n39:1 Comment: The intention is good, right?\n39:3 Comment: Because everyone, usually defenses, always go towards the goal and leave it behind.\n39:8 Comment: But it doesn't arrive.\n39:9 Comment: Victor Ruiz.\n39:10 Comment: Press Benzema.\n39:11 Comment: Long ball.\n39:12 Comment: It clicks wonderfully.\n39:13 Comment: Jonathan.\n39:14 Comment: Jonathan who was encouraged by realizing Kiko Casillas' advanced position.\n39:17 Comment: Surely the intention is for him to go to the back.\n39:20 Comment: But it doesn't arrive.\n39:21 Comment: It is supported.\n39:31 Comment: Surely the intention is wonderful.\n39:32 Comment: But the execution was far from the idea that the Mexican midfielder had in his head.\n39:34 Comment: of Villarreal.\n39:35 Comment: Yeah.\n39:36 Comment: It's true.\n39:37 Comment: But look where he received the ball.\n39:38 Comment: So, between the two lines again.\n39:40 Comment: OK.\n39:41 Comment: Again.\n39:42 Comment: They are trying.\n39:43 Comment: They have been there a couple of times.\n39:45 Comment: Forward to Varane and Ramos.\n39:49 Comment: And on Kroos' back.\n39:51 Comment: Another good maneuver from Jonathan Dosantos.\n39:54 Comment: She is accompanied by Sansone and Cheryshev.\n39:56 Comment: The Mexican stops due to the absence of votes.\n39:57 Comment: In the absence of support, he did not see a clear pass to any of the teammates who followed him in that attacking action.\n40:5 Comment: So Fran Escrivá's team starts from behind again in the last five minutes of the first half.\n40:13 Comment: Trigueros.\n40:15 Comment: Bruno.\n40:20 Comment: Jonathan receives and turns.\n40:24 Comment: Trigueros of first sword.\n40:25 Comment: Bruno Soriano.\n40:27 Comment: Trigueros.\n40:30 Comment: Opening of Musaquio.\n40:31 Comment: José Ángel receives.\n40:33 Comment: José Ángel advances.\n40:35 Comment: Covered now by Ronaldo.\n40:39 Comment: Fran Escrivá's team plays and plays with discretion without risking, without compromising possession.\n40:44 Comment: No, because he knows that Madrid has to go up, advance.\n40:49 Comment: Because he plays at home, people ask for it and all that.\n40:52 Comment: So sometimes it plays a little.\n40:56 Comment: One, two or three.\n40:57 Comment: Sometimes more.\n41:0 Comment: That's why.\n41:2 Comment: Bruno.\n41:3 Comment: Villarreal's charge again.\n41:4 Comment: From first to Trigueros.\n41:5 Comment: Well, that ball to the right.\n41:7 Comment: Castillejo is coming.\n41:8 Comment: The Bale just played.\n41:9 Comment: Therefore, that ball becomes Ricardo's corner for Villarreal.\n41:13 Comment: I don't know if it's the first of the yellow set.\n41:17 Comment: I would say the second.\n41:17 Comment: The second.\n41:18 Comment: I'm remembering Kiko Casillas' save, Cherise's shot.\n41:22 Comment: It's true.\n41:22 Comment: Second corner.\n41:23 Comment: Well, at times Fran Escrivá's team also stretches.\n41:26 Comment: That's trying to speed it up.\n41:27 Comment: These last moments of the first half to take the lead on the scoreboard.\n41:32 Comment: There are five in yellow inside the area looking for 0-1.\n41:36 Comment: Musacchio wants it, Mario Gaspar wants it.\n41:38 Comment: Also Bruno Soriano.\n41:39 Comment: Why not Sansone?\n41:43 Comment: Thread Launch.\n41:44 Comment: Again very open.\n41:45 Comment: Again very powerful.\n41:46 Comment: He tries to save him, but Víctor Ruiz fails.\n41:49 Comment: So the possibility is lost without even having attempted the shot for Villarreal Club de Fútbol.\n41:57 Comment: What's up Ricardo?\n42:0 Comment: What's going on downstairs with Marcelo?\n42:1 Comment: Well...\n42:2 Comment: Hey...\n42:3 Comment: Well, it's change.\n42:4 Comment: They are asking for change.\n42:5 Comment: Do not tell me.\n42:6 Comment: Yes Yes Yes.\n42:6 Comment: I have seen Cristiano Ronaldo make the substitution gesture.\n42:10 Comment: Marcelo leaves injured.\n42:11 Comment: Take the Brazilian footballer.\n42:14 Comment: Well, be careful because this forces Nacho to jump onto the field of play.\n42:19 Comment: Without heating.\n42:20 Comment: No no no no no.\n42:21 Comment: Sorry.\n42:22 Comment: Nacho no.\n42:22 Comment: To Carvajal.\n42:23 Comment: He has taken off the top part of his tracksuit.\n42:25 Comment: Carvajal.\n42:26 Comment: Well, let's see Marcelo's re-election.\n42:27 Comment: Because it is the only position in the squad that does not have a clear replacement.\n42:32 Comment: With Coentrao's situation, the Brazilian was one of the players who played the most minutes\n42:36 Comment: could accumulate this season.\n42:39 Comment: And for now he leaves injured.\n42:41 Comment: Grabs the right leg.\n42:42 Comment: Let's see what the extent of the injury is.\n42:44 Comment: But we must remember Real Madrid's most immediate calendar.\n42:47 Comment: Play in Las Palmas next Saturday.\n42:50 Comment: They have to face Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League in the fight for first place\n42:55 Comment: of the group.\n42:56 Comment: And subsequently...\n42:57 Comment: He will visit Seville to play against...\n42:59 Comment: No.\n43:0 Comment: I was going to say against Betis.\n43:1 Comment: No.\n43:2 Comment: They have to receive Eibar here at the Bernabéu first.\n43:4 Comment: And after the break, Betis at

Carvajal.\n23:2 Comment: If I stay in the middle, then Bale can go one on one inside to\n23:6 Comment: shoot at door\n23:8 Comment: An opponent that, let's not forget, is subject to the condition of a

    "summary": "The highly anticipated match between Real Madrid and Villarreal on matchday 5 of the La Liga Santander took place at the iconic Santiago Bernabéu. Real Madrid began the encounter with a distribution of play centrally, enthralling the fans from the get-go. Their movement on the field was orchestrated by the usual suspects—Benzema, Kovacic, Marcelo, and Kroos—each contributing to the build-up play. Zidane's men displayed early dominance in possession, seeking to impose their gameplay on Villarreal.\n\nWithin the initial minutes, Marcelo was already pushing forward from his left-back position, constantly looking to combine with Benzema. This aggression from Real Madrid forced Villarreal into adopting a more defensive posture, primarily arranged in formations like 4-3-3 and 4-1-4-1. The latter setup allowed Trigueros and Jonathan dos Santos to operate ahead of Bruno, the solitary defensive midfielder.\n\nDespite Real Madrid's early stronghold on possession, a noticeable trend was the difficulty in breaking Villarreal's organized defense. Marcelo, Kroos, and Danilo, replacing Carvajal, were instrumental in initiating the team’s forward movements. A crucial moment unfolded when Bale, an ever-persistent force on the right, whipped in a cross that led to a corner for Real Madrid.\n\nThroughout this half, intricate passing sequences met stiff resistance from Villarreal’s defenders. Meanwhile, Real Madrid's coach Zidane was active on the touchline, directing his players on positional adjustments, notably James Rodriguez, who oscillated between offensive duties and midfield support roles. \n\nThe first substantial threat from Real Madrid came in the 17th minute with Benzema's half-volley which was expertly parried by Villarreal's goalkeeper, Sergio Asenjo. The play emanated from Marcelo's quality crossing, indicating Real Madrid's continued attempts to breach Villarreal’s last defensive line.\n\nHowever, Villarreal, buoyed by the occasional possession, crafted their first significant opportunities around the 28-minute mark. Cheryshev and Sansone came close with well-constructed plays, the latter attempting a deft bicycle kick, which only just missed the target. \n\nApproaching the halfway mark, a massive shift occurred. Marcelo, who had been influential with his overlapping runs and crosses, was forced to exit due to an injury, prompting an immediate response with Carvajal stepping in without warm-up. Villarreal capitalized on the resultant disorganization, and right before the whistle signaling halftime, Varane's ill-executed roulette cost Real Madrid dearly. Trigueros seized upon the mistake, his shot deflecting off Ramos’s extended arm inside the area—an action adjudged by González González, the referee, to warrant a penalty. Villarreal's experienced midfielder Bruno Soriano stepped up and confidently slotted the ball home, giving his side a surprising 1-0 lead at half-time.\n\nThe second half saw Real Madrid return with renewed vigor and determination. Zidane's instructions seemingly invigorated his players, as they launched into the attack. Danilo, now positioned on the left to cover for Marcelo, combined with the midfield to exert pressure on Villarreal’s backline. Just minutes into the half, the persistence paid off. From a corner, an unmarked Sergio Ramos leaped highest to direct a powerful header into the net, thus redeeming himself from the earlier handball incident. The Santiago Bernabéu roared, celebrating the 1-1 equalizer in the 47th minute.\n\nReal Madrid's momentum was palpable as they continued to dominate proceedings. Ronaldo, who had been somewhat subdued in the first half, began displaying his characteristic flair. An impressive defensive performance by Villarreal, coupled with Asenjo’s remarkable saves, maintained the scoreline. Notably, in the 53rd minute, a swift offensive move saw Benzema narrowly miss the target with a header after an impeccable cross from Kovacic.\n\nAs the clock ticked, both teams adjusted tactically. Villarreal made their first change around the hour mark, introducing Roberto Soriano in place of Cheryshev to reinforce their defensive and midfield lines. Zidane, recognizing the need for more incisiveness, replaced Bale with Lucas Vázquez. The latter, known for his energetic runs and crosses, immediately looked to make an impact. The fresh legs of Álvaro Morata later replaced Benzema, another strategic substitution aimed at utilizing Morata’s aerial prowess.\n\nDespite Real Madrid's relentless onslaught, including close attempts from Ronaldo, Morata, and others, Villarreal's sturdy defense and Asenjo’s goalkeeping prowess kept them at bay. One such crucial moment was Asenjo’s reflex save from Morata’s header in the dying moments of the match—his acrobatic effort ensured Villarreal secured a valuable point.\n\nTensions reached a boiling point near the end, evidenced by the booking of Cristiano Ronaldo for a late challenge. The referee faced continuous appeals for penalties, notably from Ramos and Benzema, both of which were dismissed. In the midst of this, Zidane's tactical deployment of Ramos as an additional offensive threat sought to tilt the scale but to no avail.\n\nVillarreal, under Fran Escribá’s guidance, expert in absorbing Real Madrid's pressure, managed to orchestrate counter-attacks sporadically but primarily focused on preserving their draw. The final whistle blew, and Real Madrid, despite an aggressive and spirited second-half performance, had to settle for a 1-1 draw. This result marked the first instance in the season where Real Madrid failed to secure maximum points, a fact not lost on the fervent but ultimately disappointed Bernabéu crowd.\n\nThe match highlighted the resilience of Villarreal, who, for the first time in their history, managed to eke out a point in this hostile territory. Their strategic defending, coupled with Asenjo’s outstanding goalkeeping, nullified Real Madrid's multifaceted attacking threats. Meanwhile, Zidane's side, although dominant in possession and offensive attempts, found themselves on the wrong end of luck and execution in vital moments.\n\nUltimately, the 1-1 draw leaves both teams with lessons to reflect on—Real Madrid's need to convert dominance into goals and manage defensive lapses, and Villarreal's ability to perform under pressure on one of football's grandest stages."
