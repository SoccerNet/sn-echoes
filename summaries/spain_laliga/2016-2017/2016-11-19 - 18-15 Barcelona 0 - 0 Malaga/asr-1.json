alone and encourage him to have to swing\n34:47 Comment: Immediately and jump the center back on that side to help him to prevent him from dribbling.\n34:53 Comment: And if it dribbles so that the coverage player can act and we see those who are retreating, this is\n35:0 Comment: I repeat, it is exhausting, we will see how healthy Malaga is physically for the second half\n35:5 Comment: And Barça has to chew the play more as they are doing without rushing without losing balls\n35:11 Comment: and many times then center even if it is not the best time to then go look for the\n35:16

stretched but we have already seen\n36:21 Comment: Everything has to be very fast and sandro was only in the area very well marked by more serano\n36:27 Comment: He has never lost sight of him, he has noticed him, and well, in that doubt, I think he has also tried not to.\n36:33 Comment: Just doing the trick, Juan Car also thought that if they hit Pique's legs, he might as well be a\n36:37 Comment: Corner and goal would have meant a new possibility, especially in the possibility of\n36:41 Comment: Not accumulating many attackers because so far we are seeing that when it is stretched there is only one\n36:47 Comment: Either there is no one to finish in the area or it's just Sandro looking for Rafiña who had slipped\n36:53 Comment: Camel and Ricardo but I corrected just now that I was

authority of Carlos Camel and we saw the image of Raquitich on the bench, we must remember\n37:52 Comment: that in addition to silves in iraq and teach jordi alba andré gómez alés vidal carles alaña and marlon\n37:57 Comment: These are the alternatives that Luis Enrique has to look for a solution in case this doesn't happen\n38:3 Comment: Break the 0 to 0, the presence of Ales Vidal in the call in the situation draws attention\n38:9 Comment: Also the firewood that comes from Leo Messi's last-minute illness and\n38:14 Comment: also the presence of marlon central brazilian football club barcelona to see ricardo yes because\n38:20 Comment: Titi is not injured after his time in France, nor is Iniesta yet\n38:25 Comment: Convalescing from that injury and Luis Suárez is not sanctioned so

and when the\n38:59 Comment: realization shows us those photologists who are out of the call with a titi with\n39:3 Comment: Jeremy Matías and I also think that Suárez is very close to you if I was going to tell you that in the case of\n39:10 Comment: Jeremy Matías, we were waiting for his medical discharge and for him to even be included in the squad\n39:15 Comment: He is the only one who has

Comment: by jeremy matías\n39:29 Comment: Federico Rica's good maneuver is that he lifts up for Malaga who stretches and takes a little bit\n39:34 Comment: of air starting this play already in the rival field and before we have seen how what is positioned\n39:42 Comment: Malaga's defensive organization occupies the width of the 40 meters of the area in depth\n39:51 Comment: I think there is a distance between the center backs and Sandro of more than 20 meters which makes it difficult\n39:58 Comment: That inside it could disorganize them or tiberos, sandro was looking for, pique assures that he puts his head in it\n40:4 Comment: Burn delivering first for Sergi Roberto, Malaga had done well making that one\n40:11 Comment: action from the right with the barbellí javier ron tiberos

section\n40:55 Comment: end of the first half and we are still waiting for the goals in the camp now barça 0 malaga 0\n41:5 Comment: They go up to look for the most mountainous Piqué finish, Busquets also wants it like Paco Alcácer\n41:12 Comment: Very close to Camelia, Neymar's shot serves the 11th and Neymar puts it on the penalty spot.\n41:17 Comment: If no more arrives, it will be that Cáceres de la Cabeza Rosales does not lightly touch the ball\n41:22 Comment: He leaves the area, touch behind him, Suárez will try to save him and Lucas Diñe saves him\n41:30 Comment: Juan de Ramos is now asking for a step forward in his defense, but not\n41:34 Comment: It is closed so much that it is done a little faster\n41:36 Comment: Touched again in defense of Barcelona football club, Busquets raises his head\n41:46 Comment: distributes to burn that has doubled diñe\n41:52 Comment: and again with fire the front paco alcácer of my suárez moves\n41:59 Comment: It's for Paco who arrives very forced, the Barça attacker touched her but he couldn't cushion her\n42:7 Comment: And that favored the clearance of Miguel Torres, which, as Ricardo said, indicated to the rest of\n42:12 Comment: Comrades, let's go out, let's stretch a little, draw the line a little further from our own\n42:18 Comment: Goal yes because it gives the feeling that Malaga is going little by little as the minutes go by\n42:21 Comment: Getting into his area and what Juan de Ramos and Miguel Torres asked now was to recover that one\n42:26 Comment: I take a step forward, which is a certain way, Miquel corrects me if I'm wrong, maybe even\n42:30 Comment: something linked to fatigue and the wear and tear of spending more than 40 minutes maintaining this system\n42:34 Comment: Defensively, the good thing is that at the moment the script is working out well, the plan is working out\n42:38 Comment: Well, what's happening is that it's a huge physical strain, we're not seeing the team running.\n42:45 Comment: A lot behind the ball, all these swings require a lot of effort and if you recover later\n42:52 Comment: the ball and you don't hurt, you go back to recovering, working defensively and maintaining\n42:59 Comment: Not only the physical but then the concentration that all these movements require is done\n43:4 Comment: highly complicated and as the minutes go by you stop doing something that accompanies you\n43:11 Comment: to another and of course the coach has to be very attentive to sending the precise orders that are what\n43:16 Comment: Go through this not because you don't get so far back because any center can mean\n43:22 Comment: a shot at mass and add a hand for musquets up up musquets' shot later\n43:28 Comment: From another attacking action, Barça cooked very very very slowly and here we have seen no\n43:34 Comment: Juan de Ramos is probably trying to prevent the team from getting so far behind because now everything\n43:39 Comment: Not only the defenders but even the midfielders have gotten so much into the area that they have left\n43:45 Comment: Having discovered the front area where Musquets has done very well, it has taken off very well because\n43:51 Comment: He had no one to defend, he already has two centre-backs who take care of Sandro and that's what he has to do\n43:55 Comment: To get from that second line you don't have to be aware of a midfielder today and it can be\n44:1 Comment: A solution for Barça is not deep balls and centered backwards towards that area of ​​​​the\n44:8 Comment: front and can finish again dyes for his father\n44:17 Comment: In that action in which the ball voted inside the small area, he managed to keep Federico Rica away\n44:23 Comment: Barça insists Sergio Roberto can be one of the last in the first half\n44:28 Comment: Rafinha steps on her, puts her between the lines, no time starts, Sergio Roberto, Carlos keeps her\n44:36 Comment: But I couldn't start before because I would have surely fallen offside and he couldn't see it either\n44:41 Comment: So if it was at another height, for example, one of the central ones like towers or like Llorente\n44:49 Comment: There is going to be added time 1 to 46 we have to get there we are in the last minute the first one\n44:55 Comment: for rafinha inner value on the career of paco alcácer attentive rosales\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Luis Enrique's team, Neymar the last to take the field, the Asturian coach's last indication was for Arda Turán, so this is how this second half begins with Málaga looking to resist and with that good defensive organization that they have shown in the first 45 minutes.\n0:30 Comment: It is played again at the Camp Nou, opening by Gerard Piqué, Sergi Roberto behind again for Piqué, a scenario similar to the one we experienced during practically the entire first half with all the players on the Barcelona field in the middle of the pitch, defended for Málaga, trying to put together the attacking play, trying to get closer to Kameni's goal based on combinations that are not always productive due to the rival's good defensive positioning.\n0:57 Comment: Yes, now we see that perhaps...\n1:0 Comment: He is trying in that circulation, Luis Enrique has placed his interiors, very close to the center backs, almost posing a 5 against 5 with the wingers and the interiors.\n1:12

Kameni's goal.\n1:23 Comment: Yes, in that positional attack that we have seen now, it seems that both Rafinha and Denis Suárez when the ball is...\n1:30 Comment: ...on their side they try to lengthen the opposing defense or even create doubts for the centre-backs about whether to go to mark them or look for their back and with that idea, try to create imbalances in the defensive line or be able to receive between the lines and then look for changes in orientation in that circulation.\n1:54 Comment: Let's see if it turns out well for Luis Enrique.\n1:57 Comment: Yeah.\n2:0 Comment: Rosales will put Málaga's back into play.\n2:2 Comment: We saw an image of the Camp Nou, in the end more spectators than we could see at first are 83,439 people, the fans who gather here today at the Camp Nou.\n2:16 Comment: Busquets.\n2:18 Comment: Back for Piqué and start again for Barça, Mascherano.\n2:26 Comment: Rafinha.\n2:30 Comment: Hold on Rafinha.\n2:31 Comment: Leave it to Piqué.\n2:34

take the ball away from him.\n2:59 Comment: When his back is to the opponent's goal.\n3:2 Comment: And we see if someone picks up that ball and can do something else.\n3:8 Comment: Shot from the corner.\n3:9 Comment: Javier Mascherano heads the ball.\n3:12 Comment: Ball well over Kameni's goal.\n3:16 Comment: No consequences that first opportunity.\n3:18 Comment: That first approach to a dead ball.\n3:21 Comment: From Luis Enrique's team.\n3:26 Comment: And just like in the first half...\n3:27 Comment: ...from practically every goal kick...\n3:29 Comment: ...the shelter of the Little League team.\n3:31 Comment: Kameni takes it easy.\n3:33 Comment: So many years at Espanyol will surely have something to do with it.\n3:35 Comment: But I don't know if they also have a certain component...\n3:37 Comment: ...Ricardo of reproach.\n3:39 Comment: For a theoretical waste of time that Barça fans appreciate.\n3:41 Comment: Well, Kameni takes it easy.\n3:43 Comment: Just take advantage of the malaba to get situated.\n3:45 Comment: To take a light breather.\n3:47 Comment: To get the place back.\n3:49 Comment: It is true that Kameni with this 0 to 0 is in no hurry.\n3:51 Comment: And this is what he reproaches him for.\n3:53 Comment: I believe that from the first quarter of an hour of the game the Camp Nou fans.\n3:56 Comment: Neymar.\n3:59 Comment: diñe\n4:1 Comment:

player\n4:31 Comment: Yes, but I think the possibilities\n4:33 Comment: To finish or to produce dangerous plays\n4:36 Comment: They mainly go through this player\n4:38 Comment: By Neymar\n4:39 Comment: It's Messi's lack\n4:40 Comment: He is the player who has the most overflow\n4:43 Comment: And should be able to come into play more\n4:44 Comment: And play more plays of this type\n4:48 Comment: Juanpi\n4:49 Comment: Receives Ontiveros on the right\n4:53 Comment: Ball after for Rosales\n4:55 Comment: Ontiveros again\n4:56 Comment: Juanpi claims her again\n4:59 Comment: Ball behind

Neymar again\n31:59 Comment: So much is received in band\n32:0 Comment: Now he is daring much more\n32:1 Comment: is insisting\n32:2 Comment: It shows with more confidence\n32:3 Comment: Maybe you have better physical sensations\n32:4 Comment: Because we see that from the beginning of the second part\n32:5 Comment: Much more has come into play\n32:6 Comment: He has tried much more to overflow\n32:7 Comment: one against one\n32:8 Comment: It's an overflow\n32:20 Comment: The stakes are much higher\n32:21 Comment: He has tried much more to overflow\n32:22 Comment: one against one\n32:23 Comment: And thanks to this, FC Barcelona\n32:24 Comment: It's a little bit closer\n32:25 Comment: Of disturbing Kameni\n32:27 Comment: Has caused an expulsion\n32:28 Comment: A penalty\n32:29 Comment: A card to a Tiberius\n32:31 Comment: Numerous fouls near the area\n32:32 Comment: And what he said\n32:33 Comment: Is not\n32:34 Comment: and has\n32:35 Comment: Already Piqué as a forward\n32:36 Comment: Accompanying Alcácer\n32:38 Comment: and behind\n32:40 Comment: Well, well\n32:41 Comment: Good surveillance missions\n32:42 Comment: By Busquets\n32:43 Comment: And from

passed over Carlos Kameni's goal.\n32:55 Comment: Burbur Benoche already asks Kameni to hurry up.\n33:1 Comment: And despite all this, movement is perceived in the visiting bank.\n33:7 Comment: Let's not forget that Barça has already used up the three substitutions.\n33:11 Comment: In Nesiri the one who is going to enter the field of play.\n33:13 Comment: The thing is that Malaga has two changes left.\n33:15 Comment: At the moment only Luis entered and now he is going to enter Nesiri.\n33:21 Comment: What happened to Rosales?\n33:23 Comment: Another foul that also claims that Neymar kicked him.\n33:28 Comment: He is pointing to the twin.\n33:30 Comment: And what Neymar wants is to get the ball out quickly.\n33:33 Comment: We have the repeated sequence.\n33:39 Comment: And Neymar's shot is coming and puts it at the far post.\n33:42 Comment: Kameni comes out and catches in two counts.\n33:45 Comment: An action invalidated due to lack of Gerard Piqué.\n33:48 Comment: Yes, he has also taken the hit but it is simply that, a blow.\n33:52 Comment: In the action with Kameni, the Barça centre-back is already up.\n33:55 Comment: Already more incorporated into attack functions.\n33:59 Comment: Because Barça closes with Mascherano, with Jordi Alba and with Sergi Roberto.\n34:3 Comment: Ahead with Busquets.\n34:5 Comment: But there he is, Piqué as nine.\n34:11 Comment: Sergi Roberto gives in for Mascherano.\n34:14 Comment: And this one even further back for Mascherano.\n34:15 Comment: The André Ter Stegen brand.\n34:18 Comment: Jordi Alba.\n34:22 Comment: The Hospitalet player advances without opposition.\n34:26 Comment: Delivering for Neymar.\n34:30 Comment: First Busquets.\n34:33 Comment: This is Javier Mascherano.\n34:35 Comment: Inside Mascherano looking for Piqué.\n34:37 Comment: Above.\n34:39 Comment: Piqué's shot goes up.\n34:41 Comment: What's wrong with Kameni with the assistant?\n34:43 Comment: What the signage calls for.\n34:45 Comment: Offside in Piqué's position.\n34:47 Comment: The protest of the Málaga goalkeeper.\n34:49 Comment: That action was valid.\n34:51 Comment: But Piqué's shot went over the crossbar.\n34:53 Comment: At the moment in which the change occurs.\n34:55 Comment: Sandro, the former Barça player, leaves.\n34:58 Comment: With some applause for the future...\n35:1 Comment: Well, not with some applause.\n35:2 Comment: Now with more applause for the Canarian soccer player.\n35:4 Comment: Who returns the ovation.\n35:6 Comment: Enter Nesiri.\n35:8 Comment: The Moroccan enters to try to give Málaga air from midfield forward.\n35:13 Comment: Sandro out.\n35:14 Comment: Inside, inside, Youssef Nesiri.\n35:16 Comment: This very, very, very young player.\n35:18 Comment: Number 26 on the back.\n35:19 Comment: Still signed for Atlético Málaga.\n35:23 Comment: And he has already scored in this first division.\n35:26 Comment: That he has already scored in this Santander League.\n35:27 Comment: Yes that's how it is.\n35:28 Comment: And replacing an already tired, very combative player.\n35:31 Comment: And for me it has been one of the best of Málaga in attack.\n35:35 Comment: Known Sandro.\n35:36 Comment: Sergi Roberto.\n35:37 Comment: Ball inside the area.\n35:38 Comment: Rejection for whom.\n35:39 Comment: For Alba.\n35:40 Comment: The shot directly to the defender's leg.\n35:44 Comment: Straight to the leg of Miguel Torres.\n35:47 Comment: It becomes another corner.\n35:51 Comment: Ball hanging into the area.\n35:52 Comment: There's the punch line.\n35:53 Comment: No.\n35:54 Comment: It got lost.\n35:55 Comment: He puts his hands to his head.\n35:57 Comment: Gerard Piquera was also looking for Rakitic.\n36:0 Comment: That ball passed very close to Carlos Cameni's goal.\n36:5 Comment: Well, Barça is already playing with a little more rhythm.\n36:8 Comment: So their goal is to score a goal that gives them three points.\n36:13 Comment: Against a Málaga team that we now see no longer has a line 5,\n36:16 Comment: but in defense, in the defensive phase, it has a line of up to 6.\n36:20 Comment: What remains are two players in the center of the field.\n36:22 Comment: And we see Inesiri who is embedded between Fornals and Juanpi making a defense of 6.\n36:29 Comment: And ahead 3 to cover as much space as possible again\n36:33 Comment: so that Barcelona has more difficulties to progress.\n36:37 Comment: Because before when there was a line of 6 and 2,\n36:40 Comment: Well, we saw that Mascherano was driving, driving, driving.\n36:43 Comment: And he could easily cross very close to the area.\n36:46 Comment: Neymar tries to overwhelm.\n36:48 Comment: Inside ball André Gómez.\n36:51 Comment: Providencial Miguel Torres.\n36:54 Comment: To prevent André Gómez's shot from hitting the goal.\n36:57 Comment: Neymar takes a quick kick from the corner.\n36:59 Comment: Stop at the far post. Arda was waiting for her.\n37:1 Comment: The rejection in the front for Sergi Roberto.\n37:3 Comment: Sergi Roberto insists.\n37:5 Comment: There is Alcácer first. Piqué's header.\n37:7 Comment: And because of that detour, Arda misses it.\n37:10 Comment: FC Barcelona had reached a finishing position.\n37:13 Comment: But Gerard Piqué failed to send the ball towards the goal.\n37:17 Comment: Barça is on the charge again.\n37:19 Comment: He comes up like he hadn't done in the entire Camp Nou game.\n37:22 Comment: Yes, it is the moment when it is most pressing.\n37:25 Comment: Because the Barça fans know that there are 37, that there are 8 left.\n37:29 Comment: And in added time the opportunity is slipping away from Barça\n37:33 Comment: to be a leader, even if it is provisional.\n37:35 Comment: And in the absence of the Calderón capital derby.\n37:41 Comment: Sergio Busquets.\n37:43 Comment: Playing for Mascherano.\n37:45 Comment: Ball touched by Mascherano.\n37:47 Comment: André Gómez loves her.\n37:49 Comment: To the crossbar!\n37:51 Comment: Goal disallowed for Gerard Piqué.\n37:53 Comment: Raise the Lille van.\n37:55 Comment: De Burgos's assistant, Bencoetxea.\n37:57 Comment: And offside.\n37:59 Comment: I don't know if it was from André Gómez in the first shot or from Piqué in the follow-up.\n38:2 Comment: Well, it's also something that Luis Enrique has looked for, right?\n38:4 Comment: With that substitution.\n38:6 Comment: Trying to get André Gómez in or use him, right?\n38:11 Comment: He is a tall player.\n38:13 Comment: And Luis Enrique may also think that he can solve this game with a set piece.\n38:17 Comment: Well, it's worth seeing, because the situations from which André Gómez starts...\n38:22 Comment: It's there, there.\n38:23 Comment: I would like to see him again, because there are a lot of footballers\n38:26 Comment: and you have to identify which one is André Gómez.\n38:28 Comment: But at first it looked like it could be online.\n38:30 Comment: In the continuation, of course, there can be no offside\n38:32 Comment: because Piqué is behind the ball.\n38:34 Comment: So it all depends on André Gómez's position at the start of the action.\n38:38 Comment: Rakitic.\n38:40 Comment: He agrees with Sergi Roberto.\n38:42 Comment: But the salary of the forward is taken by Fornals.\n38:45 Comment: Málaga continues to resist, but the pressure from Barça...\n38:51 Comment: It's been tremendous in these last few minutes.\n38:56 Comment: Burn.\n39:1 Comment: The Málaga defense takes it out.\n39:3 Comment: Villanueva protected, Piqué is looking for her.\n39:5 Comment: A penalty is requested, a penalty is requested.\n39:7 Comment: And from Burgos he drives him. He says no, Ricardo.\n39:9 Comment: No, and also consult with your linesman.\n39:11 Comment: The Málaga footballer remains lying on the field of play.\n39:14 Comment: Kameni throws her out.\n39:16 Comment: The unanimous protest also from Piqué for that grab.\n39:19 Comment: In that play that could be key.\n39:21 Comment: And in that ball that the Málaga centre-back lets pass waiting for Kameni.\n39:27 Comment: And the Barça defender is about to snatch him away.\n39:31 Comment: What does the penalty look like, Miquel?\n39:33 Comment: First he wants to protect the ball by placing himself in front so that Piqué does not reach it.\n39:39 Comment: Afterwards, it is true that when Piqué passes him he ends up putting his arm out and ends up throwing himself to the ground.\n39:46 Comment: I think that afterwards Piqué also ends up jumping without it being necessary to fall due to force or Villanueva's grip.\n39:56 Comment: Burgos Bengoetxea has cautioned Juan de Ramos because he has come to Luis Enrique's technical area.\n40:2 Comment: But he has gone beyond it to give Rosales an indication.\n40:5 Comment: Sergio Busquets returns the ball.\n40:7 Comment: He sends him away.\n40:9 Comment: Kameni would have done the same previously.\n40:12 Comment: Here we have Piqué's fall from another angle.\n40:17 Comment: But then I think that at first he tries to prevent it from arriving.\n40:21 Comment: And then I think that Piqué lateralizes the position a little bit.\n40:27 Comment: I think he doesn't reach the ball in the end and Piqué ends up falling.\n40:30 Comment: It seemed to me that that action that we have seen before from Diego Llorente was more lacking.\n40:34 Comment: When he catches him at the beginning of unchecking, he enters outside the area, on the line.\n40:39 Comment: Or inside the area that could have just whistled that it is not played.\n40:43 Comment: Neymar is looking for Piqué again. He goes out and catches Carlos Kameni.\n40:47 Comment: Has Piqué been hurt?\n40:49 Comment: Yes, he got hurt. He is limping.\n40:54 Comment: And now what he asks is for Kameni to hurry up.\n40:59 Comment: But nothing, it's just a blow, a crash.\n41:2 Comment: It seemed that Kameni was apologizing to Piqué because he was aware that when he went to catch that ball he had hit him.\n41:7 Comment: And they have apologized now. He plays Barça again.\n41:10 Comment: All in order.\n41:11 Comment: Rosales about to recover Busquets.\n41:16 Comment: Very intense pressure from Barça that forces Juanpi to throw the ball out.\n41:21 Comment: It will be a throw-in for Jordi Alba.\n41:26 Comment: The action is frenetic in these last minutes at the Camp Nou.\n41:32 Comment: Rakitic.\n41:33 Comment: Ball hung by Rakitic looking for Piqué.\n41:36 Comment: In the head Miguel Torres. Another corner for Barça.\n41:40 Comment: This doesn't let up, this doesn't stop.\n41:42 Comment: But it would be nice to see that action by André Gómez again to try to fully identify whether he was enabled or not.\n41:49 Comment: Corner kick. Arda Turán jumped.\n41:52 Comment: Rejection for Mascherano.\n41:54 Comment: Mascherano delivers for Neymar.\n41:56 Comment: Neymar looks for the gap. He profiles. Stage two is put by Neymar.\n41:58 Comment: Second stick. Arda fails to finish.\n42:2 Comment: Lack.\n42:3 Comment: Action invalidated due to lack of Arda Turán.\n42:6 Comment: In that finishing attempt.\n42:8 Comment: Ball for Málaga. Less than three minutes to reach 90.\n42:12 Comment: And you have to see the added time. How much is the referee going to add with the changes that have occurred.\n42:18 Comment: I think Juan de Ramos is still waiting to make the last substitution.\n42:23 Comment: But we can leave between three and four minutes.\n42:26 Comment: We are seeing the action repeated with that goal disallowed for Piqué.\n42:29 Comment: Everything was canceled by the situation of André Gómez when he started to take that uncheck.\n42:36 Comment: Towards the interior of the area. We just saw it again and with the help of Seth.\n42:40 Comment: Yes, with the help of Seth.\n42:41 Comment: André Gómez is enabled.\n42:43 Comment: Yes, it is enabled. But once more complicated for Liniers.\n42:47 Comment: He is almost in line with one of the players who form the defensive line.\n42:53 Comment: Which was a bit staggered. It was at different heights.\n42:56 Comment: And well, perhaps Piqué or some other teammate has prevented the Liniers from seeing the correct position of André Gómez.\n43:4 Comment: But the play is very, very, very difficult to perceive.\n43:7 Comment: Because in fact the player who enables André Gómez is many meters away from André Gómez.\n43:11 Comment: He is the one in the lateral position.\n43:13 Comment: It is closer to Liniers.\n43:15 Comment: Very complicated to notice that position. Or really discern what had happened to Burgos Bencochea's assistant.\n43:23 Comment: But hey, one thing doesn't take away the other.\n43:25 Comment: And using technology and that superimposition, that shading.\n43:29 Comment: It did seem that André Gómez was in the correct position.\n43:34 Comment: But Piqué should not have been annulled.\n43:37 Comment: Kameni can't serve. Villanueva orders to put the ball into play.\n43:41 Comment: By the way, Kameni had thrown the ball out so that he or Juan Carlos could be treated.\n43:46 Comment: And from the pitch Piqué has already told Jordi Alba no.\n43:50 Comment: That he didn't return the ball. And that is what Barça has done. Continue playing.\n43:53 Comment: And it is difficult now for Barça not to feel attracted to centering in any circumstance.\n43:58 Comment: We see that any time they approach the area the Barça players try to center.\n44:3 Comment: Looking for a finisher. But it is difficult to avoid not looking for a better center option.\n44:10 Comment: Tell me Ricardo.\n44:11 Comment: Kameni is injured for the Burgos Bencochea game.\n44:14 Comment: Torrontegui has to come in. There is the Málaga physio.\n44:18 Comment: The goalkeeper of the Malacitano team.\n44:21 Comment: Which also takes the opportunity to shave a few seconds off the stopwatch.\n44:25 Comment: But already in the action with Piqué is where he has been able to take that blow.\n44:28 Comment: The two have collided. It seemed that Piqué was the worst off.\n44:33 Comment: But with the blow he had received. Furthermore, Piqué is getting closer or is going to get closer now.\n44:37 Comment: to Carlos Kameni himself who is lying on the playing field.\n44:40 Comment: Luis Enrique takes advantage to talk to Rakitic.\n44:42 Comment: But above all, the Asturian coach is disappointed with Arda Turán.\n44:45 Comment: To those who want more close to the band. Higher. Let the ball circulate faster.\n44:51 Comment: Juan de Ramos also took advantage to chat with Neymar. But a good time.\n44:56 Comment: You had actions at the Camp Nou. He is being treated by physios Carlos Kameni.\n45:3 Comment: This will cause the game to last a little longer.\n45:7 Comment: Of course, of course.\n45:10 Comment: Málaga has already made two changes with the arrivals of Luis and En-Nesiri.\n45:15 Comment: So in the event that Kameni could not continue, the Ukrainian Denis Poiko could join the party.\n45:27 Comment: To all this, Cartelón with the extension time. Plus four. This is the reaction of the Camp Nou.\n45:33 Comment: Four minutes. André Gómez comes and says Luis Enrique.\n45:37 Comment: Come on come on. Let's Play. We are not going to waste time protesting.\n45:40 Comment: But part of the bench has risen. Some fans in the stands who also do not understand the four minutes that the referee adds.\n45:48 Comment: Now we have to see if there are any more of these four minutes. Because of course, we are already above 45.\n45:54 Comment: Clear. And Kameni is still on the ground. With which the seconds go by.\n46:0 Comment: And Luis Enrique asking his players for activation.\n46:3 Comment: Because if something causes this, it is breaking the rhythm that Barça was playing.\n46:9 Comment: Constant siege on Kameni's goal. That's what he's asking for.\n46:15 Comment: We see the sequence in which Kameni was injured repeated. He is already recovered. Actions are resumed.\n46:20 Comment: And practically a minute and a half has already passed since the extra time that the referee had designated.\n46:27 Comment: Ball up looking for En-Nesiri. Poor defense. Barcelona is going with everything.\n46:33 Comment: Mascherano driving. Mascherano opens for Sergi Roberto to join on the right side.\n46:39 Comment: Ball hung by Sergi Roberto. He is looking for Piqué. He doesn't arrive.\n46:43 Comment: Control within the Rosales area. Piqué is looking for her again. Miguel Torres puts his leg in.\n46:47 Comment: Rakitic prolocation. Possibility of a new center for Sergi Roberto.\n46:53 Comment: Rakitic raises his head. Direct ball to the area. A defender has touched. Juanpi loves her. It was also Piqué. Rejection on the front.\n46:59 Comment: Arda's attempt gets caught on a defender's leg.\n47:3 Comment: The anchovy team. Sergio Busquets insists. Neymar. Neymar facing Rosales.\n47:11 Comment: The Venezuelan international is brilliant below. Jordi Alba picks it up. Neymar again.\n47:16 Comment: Neymar fakes with the shot. More from Neymar. It burns in the front. Arda wants to give it back.\n47:21 Comment: Inside ball caught by Carlos Kameni who seems to still be limping.\n47:26 Comment: Yeah, well, his thigh is completely bandaged. Grab it slightly and let's see if you can get the length or not with that leg.\n47:33 Comment: Ball up from Kameni who seems to have had a hard time performing that serve. The gesture didn't seem very natural.\n47:43 Comment: It didn't look like it could hit with the usual mechanics. But hey, he put her in the center of the field.\n47:49 Comment: Juanpi.

Well, I don't know what Juan Carlos told him, but he had to say something to make the card red. Something serious.\n51:39 Comment: Yes Yes. It can only be that. It has to be a disqualification, a serious insult.\n51:43 Comment: Evidently. Well, Barça stays. Málaga is left with 9. With all of Barça attacking in the area with Ter Stegen in the central circle looking for victory and leadership.\n51:56 Comment: When they intervened on Kameni or when the physios were treating Kameni, more or less the interruption was on one side.\n52:3 Comment: And in the span of about two minutes. Besides, there has been a change in the second half. We count 30 seconds, right, Miquel?\n52:7 Comment: Of course.\n52:8 Comment: We would go, plus the four they had designated, to 96 and a half.

    "summary": "On a tense evening at Camp Nou, FC Barcelona hosted Málaga in a La Liga clash that saw a resilient defensive effort by the visitors to secure a goalless draw. Despite Barcelona's relentless pressure, Málaga managed to hold their ground, epitomizing a classic scenario of a defensive masterclass in the face of an onslaught.\n\n**First Half Overview**\n\nThe game kicked off with early possession battles, primarily within the midfield area. Juan Carlos, positioned defensively, was key in Málaga's initial structure. Barcelona quickly started asserting control, aiming to break down Málaga's 5-4-1 formation. Mascherano and Neymar were pivotal in Barça's build-up play, consistently challenging Málaga's defensive setup.\n\nThe hosts saw Javier Mascherano directing play, with incisive passes targeted towards Lionel Messi and Arda Turán. However, Málaga's defense, led by Diego Llorente and Miguel Torres, remained steadfast. The defensive trio, with Villanueva on the left, alongside Rosales and Rica on the flanks, efficiently neutralized Barcelona's attacking intentions.\n\nThroughout the first half, Barcelona's tactics visibly aimed at avoiding losing possession in dangerous areas, wary of Málaga’s counter-attacking prowess. Arda Turán orchestrated multiple attacking moves, but always found Málaga's backline impenetrable. Neymar's attempts to breach the defense by dribbling past multiple markers often ended with Diego Llorente stepping up to intercept.\n\nBarcelona's midfield, with Rafinha frequently receiving the ball, leaned heavily on Busquets and Roberto for maintaining possession. When they did push forward, they faced significant resistance from Málaga's midfielders Pablo Fornals and Juanpi, who diligently tracked back to assist their defense.\n\nThe tension mounted when Barça threaded passes through the channels, with Neymar and Rafinha trying to navigate through the compact lines of Málaga. An attempt by Paco Alcácer was ruled offside, showcasing the fine margins at play. Despite Barcelona dominating possession, their plays were often stifled by Málaga's quick transitions and well-structured defensive blocks.\n\nMálaga's rare ventures forward were led primarily by Sandro, whose pace and determination provided brief respite from incessant pressure. In one such instance, Sandro’s dexterous movement forced Ter Stegen into action, highlighting Málaga’s potential threat on the break.\n\nEven though Barça held the ball with patience, shifting it across the pitch from Piqué to Mascherano and back, their ability to penetrate the final third was continually thwarted. There were sporadic threats from Neymar and Digne, but Kameni, Málaga’s goalkeeper, ably managed to keep the clean sheet intact.\n\nIn the final moments of the first half, Barcelona's set-pieces represented one of their few clear chances, with Piqué’s header superbly saved by Kameni, leaving the scoreline untouched. Both teams entered the break knowing that the slightest lapse in concentration could decide the game.\n\n**Second Half Overview**\n\nAs the second half commenced, Barcelona maintained their aggressive stance. Neymar's quick efforts nearly put pressure on Málaga's goal, with Miquel Villanueva making a crucial intervention early on. Persistence from the home side saw numerous attempts at prizing open Málaga’s defense. Yet, each attack met with Málaga’s resolute defending.\n\nLuis Enrique made tactical adjustments, positioning interiors Rafinha and Denis Suárez near the center backs, aiming to stretch Málaga's defensive line. Despite these efforts, Málaga remained tight, with their defensive shape barely wavering under the home side's onslaught.\n\nThe Camp Nou faithful, a crowd count surpassing 83,000, remained vocal, urging their team forward. Barcelona's continuous control of possession translated into persistent threats, particularly from Neymar who seemed the likeliest to break the deadlock. His attempts to link with Paco Alcácer, and delicate exchanges with his teammates, highlighted his central role in Barça's offensive maneuvers.\n\nMidway through the half, the pace of the game heightened. Neymar managed a deft shot, comfortably cupped by Kameni. Málaga, however, sought to exploit any counter-attacking opportunities, with Juanpi nearly finding success but Piqué’s timely intervention forcing a corner.\n\nBarcelona’s strategic shifts came into more apparent focus as Neymar became increasingly pivotal. His accelerating runs troubled Málaga's defenders, earning dangerous free-kicks. Indeed, Málaga’s defensive discipline resulted in several yellow cards, further showcasing the tactical tussle underway.\n\nJordi Alba’s introduction added more dynamism to Barcelona’s attacking flanks. His overlapping runs provided width and additional crossing options into the box. Despite the shift, Málaga’s backline managed to repel Barça’s crosses consistently.\n\nCalamitous moments ensued when Neymar’s dribbles drew fouls, Diego Llorente’s infringement at one point earning him a direct red card. This numerical advantage spurred Barça on, pushing even further into Málaga’s defensive third. Yet, Kameni, in goal, embodied defiance with his repeated, incredible saves.\n\nAndré Gómez entered as Luis Enrique sought fresh creativity. Neymar continued his torment of Málaga’s defense, his speed and control causing persistent issues. A late expulsion of Llorente dramatically tipped the scales, but Málaga displayed immense collective resilience, with José Luis Muñoz bolstering the backline.\n\nAs desperation mounted, Barça threw everything forward. Gerard Piqué assumed an attacking role, his presence in the box emphasizing the shift from structural defense to urgent offense. Barcelona committed every player forward, with Ter Stegen even positioned high up, ready for any sweeping duties.\n\nMálaga’s resolve reached heroic levels, punctuated by Kameni's superlative saves. A particular double-save, first denying a close-range strike with an outstretched hand, then gathering the rebound, exemplified his performance. The consistent aerial deliveries into Málaga’s box met with stout headers clear, maintaining their impervious barricade.\n\nIn the dying embers of the game, frustration was palpable. Yet another corner saw Kameni outjumping Piqué, before quick reflexes nullified a follow-up. Barça’s final attempts included frantic goalmouth scrambles, every failed clearance leading to heart-in-mouth moments.\n\nThe resilience of Málaga was epitomized in the extended, injury-time defensive stand. Their ability to thwart every Barcelona attack became a study in defensive astuteness, discipline, and sheer willpower. In the end, Málaga’s nine-man unit walked off the pitch with a sense of hard-earned accomplishment while Camp Nou was left contemplating missed opportunities.\n\nThe game concluded at 0-0, a scoreline reflecting Málaga's defensive determination and Kameni’s goalkeeping heroics. Despite dominant possession and relentless pressure, Barcelona could not break through, illustrating the unpredictable and often cruel nature of the beautiful game."
