because he is already in place before the ball arrives\n10:36 Comment: It's Isco's turn, now with Sergio Ramos there, a little bit of definition, Toni Kroos\n10:42 Comment: The ball for Pepe, Pepe opens for Danilo\n10:46 Comment: Danilo who failed in the control and points, oh what a touch Real Fernando Navarro ends up with\n10:50 Comment: Let the referee continue, the ball is for Toni Kroos\n10:55 Comment: Kroos has the band, James who receives Nacho and forward\n11:1 Comment: Ball for Marco Asensio, Marco Asensio leaves, goes to look for the center, screws it in, Sidney clears

still there, Antone lost the ball, Babel's madness, you wouldn't have to believe that the ball didn't reach him\n11:44 Comment: And you don't believe that he hasn't called a foul, if you don't believe

Gemmellater's schoolboy is interested in his condition, this change takes effect\n12:5 Comment: In Brecholac the Turk is the player who is going to leave the field of play to leave that place in the middle to a pure goalkeeper like Joselu\n12:12 Comment: A player who has participated little due to a knee problem this season with Deportivo de La Coruña\n12:18 Comment: He who played for Castilla, one of the best is leaving for Brecholac, this is also what Gaita Garitano understands, giving him a pat and applause for Joselu as he enters the field\n12:28 Comment: Well, to me it seems like a twist, very neat with its technique, very well preplayed on the periphery\n12:37 Comment: And he hasn't caught the ball, he hasn't taken responsibility for the team\n12:42 Comment: And sometimes very far back to ask for it and he has not been in the area where... it is true that he has not managed to connect once with Andone\n12:47 Comment: Well now he changes, he is a... take away that figure, let's say what could be something I know, like a midfielder although he hasn't played there either\n12:53 Comment: And put two forwards\n12:55 Comment: So I understand that you didn't like him\n12:57 Comment: No, not too much, no\n12:59 Comment: Now I think he is an exquisite player with his feet, but something has to come from there and he needs more presence\n13:6 Comment: I think he made a couple of details with the set piece\n13:8 Comment: The ball for Nacho, Nacho plays inside, he tries the wall up, James but he appears before Nacho arrives\n13:15 Comment: Alvaro Morata\n13:17 Comment: Against Almentosa, yes\n13:19 Comment: And the referee takes care\n13:21 Comment: And he is not wrong because he was practically left to continue the play, Morata was left in a position to cause a lot of problems for goalkeeper Tito\n13:33 Comment: The Almentosa characteristic is carried through the entrance, from behind\n13:36 Comment: Who says that he has made only one foul in the entire game, Almentosa that foul, that tackle from behind on Nacho, Clara, yellow card\n13:43 Comment: Just because you only make one does not mean that the first one you make is yellow\n13:46 Comment: That can turn red\n13:48 Comment: Perfectly\n13:50 Comment: But it is true that players usually throw out that code, saying that the first one is not, well, if the first one is serious enough, it can be punished with a yellow card regardless of whether it is the first or the fifth\n14:1 Comment: I think it was yellow\n14:3 Comment: If it's one it's worth two, right\n14:5 Comment: Ball for Sergio Ramon, Sergio plays, gives the ball to the sideline, Pepe comes with the ball to open on Danilo, Danilo already recovered, gives it to Marco Asensio\n14:14 Comment: It is growing not in intensity but in aggressiveness\n14:19 Comment: And from aggressiveness to thicker words there is sometimes very little distance\n14:24 Comment: Ball for Nacho, Nacho for Álvaro, Álvaro Morata who plays for Toni Kroos, Toni Kroos on Isco's position, Nacho is asking for it on the side who receives the open lane, he is going to put it there, penalty point, the ball arrived help, the sports team from La Coruña took the ball, Almentosa blew it out of the playing field.\n14:42 Comment: How good, how well Isco again Michael, how he waited just at the moment for me, for Nacho to create the space, what players\n14:49 Comment: In front of Joselu trying to open the ball Isco, plays for Marco Asensio, Marco Asensio who is starting to have more prominence in the second half, touches the ball to Isco, plays short, Casemiro appears, Casemiro for James, James Amaga goes to put inside\n15:7 Comment: The wall doesn't come out with Marco Asensio, he has cut off the ball from the sports team from La Coruña, he can't get the ball off Joselu, the referee was very close to the play, he understands that there was a foul, he was more attached to it than he was. \"Truly, there was no one.\n15:22 Comment: Casemiro, on Joselu's knee\n15:37 Comment: Almentosa with the ball, Almentosa who delivers the ball to Guillerme's position, Guillerme again for Sidney, Sidney up top looking for Joselu\n15:52 Comment: Almentosa, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis,

José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis , José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José Luis, José\n16:22 Comment: They claim Mano Morata, says the referee who is a corner, Borges took her out.\n16:30 Comment: Well, Sidney is living a nightmare on that subcommittee.\n16:35 Comment: There's the action, pay attention to the corner kick, Real Madrid took it quickly, Almentosa cleared the ball.\n16:41 Comment: Almentosa can't find company, Real Madrid is already playing, James scores for Toni Kroos, Kroos has Isco, he lets her pass, James comes again,\n16:51 Comment: Go back to Kroos, Kroos is going to put it down and Almentosa played and Titón kept it.\n16:57 Comment: There were three Real Madrid players ready to hit, Pepe stole it, pay attention to the exit, Kroos inside, Sidney takes it.\n17:3 Comment: Real Madrid press very high and that means there is an opportunity for Deportivo if they manage to get out, but they are very fast.\n17:10 Comment: Casemiro who wins the game against Andore.\n17:13 Comment: There it goes, in the end Andore has made life difficult for Casemiro, the opportunity for Depor is going to hit, which is Joselo.\n17:21 Comment: Extraordinary bond in Joselo's hitting.\n17:28 Comment: Well, Casemiro's sin is brutal because he had won the game against Andore twice, Andore's faith wins the ball.\n17:36 Comment: And as Joselo has resolved, he puts it in the same right corner of Keylor Navas' goal for the tie.\n17:44 Comment: It's a surplus of Casemiro and Andore, because the reward for insisting ends up messing up the situation.\n17:53 Comment: A very serious mistake Michael de Casemiro, the club he has control of, now then, where does Joselo put it?\n17:58 Comment: There he prepares it and look at where that ball goes, look at where that ball from Joselo enters, which has extraordinary merit.\n18:4 Comment: This time the unstoppable shot is real, impossible for desperation.\n18:8 Comment: If Keylor Navas' entire family puts themselves under the neighborhood, we won't do it.\n18:11 Comment: Look how far away Keylor Navas is and it's not because he's in a bad position, it's because he puts her in the same squad with tremendous power.\n18:19 Comment: Casemiro was overmatched no matter how much he claimed a foul, Casemiro was overmatched because he had already clearly won possession and had the ability to make the play.\n18:30 Comment: And he gave the Deportivo de La Coruña player an option, he put the play in the air and in the air it cost him the tie.\n18:36 Comment: Well, the truth is, when Deportivo seemed almost, almost, they had almost no capacity to get there, they were having the worst moment of the game.\n18:44 Comment: Just seeing how it went with two forwards instead of having a midfielder.\n18:49 Comment: It seems that Carles Gil, sorry Ricardo, has been damaged.\n18:51 Comment: At the moment, yes, he has to leave the tournament of games, he is suffering from a blow to his right knee, now he is asking to return to the field but he has had to withdraw and has had to agree to attend.\n19:0 Comment: Now Carles Gil is allowed onto the field when Real Madrid is handling the ball.\n19:5 Comment: 19 of the second half, the score was tied at one. The match seemed completely in Real Madrid's hands even though the distance was very short.\n19:14 Comment: But obviously this goal by José Lole complicates things and the public, part of the public, has taken it badly.\n19:20 Comment: And he pays for it with Casemiro, it is not the first ball that the Real Madrid player has touched.\n19:24 Comment: Attention to Depor, who are going up, the ball for Andoni.

    "summary": "The match at Santiago Bernabéu saw Real Madrid edge past Deportivo de La Coruña with a thrilling 3-2 victory, marked by moments of brilliance, tension, and a last-minute rescue led by their captain, Sergio Ramos. Here’s a detailed recount of the engaging encounter:\n\n**First Half:**\n\nFrom the kickoff, it was clear both teams were eager to assert their dominance. Real Madrid, under the tactical guidance of Zinedine Zidane, began pressing from the back, with Pepe initiating early plays to Danilo and Isco maneuvering deftly amidst pressure. The Madrileños endeavored to maintain control, working the ball through Sergio Ramos, Toni Kroos, and Isco who were pivotal in managing possession and tempo.\n\nDeportivo de La Coruña, led by coach Garitano, aimed to counteract this by applying forward pressure, aiming to disrupt Real Madrid’s rhythm. Players like Borges and Andone were instrumental in Deportivo’s transitional plays, trying to capitalize on any lapse from the hosts. \n\nReal Madrid’s attacking contingent, featuring Marco Asensio, James Rodríguez, and Álvaro Morata, looked lively. Asensio and Isco combined well to orchestrate attacks, but the Deportivo defense, with Alventosa and Sidnei at the core, managed to thwart many of these early offensives. Morata found himself out of position on a few occasions, underlining the defensive sturdiness of Deportivo which held firm against Madrid’s incursions.\n\nSeveral skirmishes unfolded within the first few minutes, with Real Madrid probing through crosses and half-moon shots. However, for all their effort, clear goal-scoring opportunities were scarce. Fernando Navarro and Guillerme, contributing significantly in midfield, foiled multiple Madrid offensives. Key enhancing plays saw Isco and James Rodríguez attempt to break the deadlock with incisive moves and threatening deliveries, yet the determined Deportivo defense kept their goal intact.\n\nFrom minute seven to minute fifteen, the game entered a somewhat scrappy phase. During this period, Real Madrid struggled to channel their possession into coherent attacking movements due to Deportivo’s compact defensive shape. Isco, increasingly becoming the hub of Madrid’s creativity, had several impactful runs and passes but was often crowded out by Deportivo players converging upon him.\n\nAs the half progressed, Real Madrid began focusing attacks down the flanks, with Nacho and Danilo frequently joining the foray. Danilo’s overlapping runs and crosses intended to exploit any gaps left by Deportivo’s defensive lines were met with mixed success. Despite the home team’s pressing, Deportivo held their shape, occasionally launching counterattacks through Andone and Babel that forced Real Madrid’s backline into urgent clearances.\n\nDeportivo persisted with a strategy of frustrating Real Madrid’s central build-ups, often pushing back plays led by Kroos and Casemiro. A near highlight for Madrid came through a well-worked cross from the right, which saw Morata connecting but misdirecting his positioning, failing to capitalize.\n\nIn a significant moment at around the 41-minute mark, a free-kick opportunity for Real Madrid saw Sergio Ramos stepping up, aiming to convert but ultimately overshooting the bar—an unfortunate miss that underscored Madrid’s struggle to imprint their usual clinical edge during set-pieces. Towards the end of the first half, the pressure from the home side grew, culminating in edge-of-seat moments but substituting clear goals for mounting frustrations. As the half-time whistle approached, it was clear Deportivo had executed their game plan admirably, disrupting Real Madrid’s rhythm and containing the favorite with a goalless first half.\n\n**Second Half:**\n\nWith a renewed vigor, both teams resumed the contest in the second half. Real Madrid injected pace into their play, pressing higher up the pitch. Casemiro, Kroos, and Isco continued their persistent efforts in controlling the midfield and facilitating forward drives. Amidst rising tensions and heart-stopping moments, Deportivo’s defensive duo of Sidnei and Alventosa, along with the efforts of Guillerme and Borges, kept Real Madrid at bay.\n\nFive minutes into the second half, Álvaro Morata broke the deadlock in outstanding fashion. After a swift turn and precise strike from outside the box, Morata’s shot found the bottom corner of Titón's net, rewarding his persistence and giving Real Madrid the crucial lead. This moment of brilliance was a testament to the forward’s sharp instincts and technical prowess.\n\nBack on level terms within just minute 19 of the second half, Joselu's extraordinary strike stunningly leveled the game for Deportivo. A significant error by Casemiro, who lost possession due to Andone’s relentless pressure, allowed Joselu to capitalize, unleashing a perfectly placed shot that Keylor Navas couldn’t parry.\n\nDeportivo, buoyed by their quick equalizer, did not relent. Striking again within seconds at the 19-minute mark, a fluid play saw Andone setting up Joselu inside Madrid’s box, who coolly slotted home to give Deportivo a surprising lead. It was a testament to Deportivo’s resilience and the predatory instincts of Joselu, who made an immediate impact upon entering the pitch.\n\nResponding to Deportivo's quick brace, Zidane made tactical adjustments. Introducing Lucas Vázquez and then Marcelo for Danilo, Zidane sought to instill greater attacking impetus and creativity. The adjustments bore fruit as Real Madrid relentlessly pushed forward, spurred on by the dismay of the home crowd and the urgency etched on their faces.\n\nWith tension escalating and time running out, Real Madrid equalized through Mariano in the 84th minute. Substituted on to offer fresh attacking options, Mariano’s well-timed leap and perfect header from Lucas Vázquez’s cross reignited the stadium. The striker's score, leveraging his aerial ability, was a crucial restoration that forced the visitors back on the defensive.\n\nAs the match neared its climax, the buoyant home crowd demanded more from their team. Pushing men forward, Real Madrid resumed their siege on Deportivo’s goal. The denouement arrived in true fairy-tale fashion—a scene becoming familiar for Real Madrid faithful. In the dying moments, during the 92nd minute, a corner kick delivered exquisitely found its way to Sergio Ramos. Rising majestically above all others, the captain powered a header past Titón, turning the scoreline 3-2 in their favor. \n\nSergio Ramos, synonymous with last-ditch heroics, once again showcased his knack for crucial goals, etching his name deeper into Real Madrid's folklore. This exhilarating finale brought jubilation to the Santiago Bernabéu and epitomized the team’s tenacity and never-say-die attitude.\n\nIn a match replete with drama, skill, and strategic battles, Real Madrid showcased resilience and their stellar ability to clutch victory from the jaws of a potential setback. The win, cemented by Ramos’ indomitable spirit, underscored the tactical depth of Zidane’s side and the ever-present danger posed by Deportivo’s tactical nous. The encounter will be remembered for its electric atmosphere and the enthralling, back-and-forth contest that kept fans on the edge of their seats until the final whistle."
