    "summary": "In an exhilarating match at Estadio Abanca-Balaídos, Real Madrid triumphed over Celta Vigo with a resounding 4-1 victory. The game was marked by intense action, multiple goals, fierce tackles, and a controversial red card that shifted the momentum decisively in Real Madrid's favor. Let's delve into the detailed account of this riveting encounter.\n\nAs the match got underway, Real Madrid took the initial possession right from the kick-off at the 0:00 mark. However, the game started with a rough patch when Celta Vigo committed a foul merely seven seconds into the match, setting the tone for what would be a heated clash.\n\nReal Madrid quickly tested Celta Vigo’s defense and managed their first shot on target at 00:36. Though the keeper saved it, the succession of plays suggested Real Madrid’s intent. The ball went out of play shortly after, prompting an early corner for Real Madrid at 01:03. The subsequent play saw Celta Vigo struggle to clear their lines, hinting at their jitteriness under pressure.\n\nAs the minutes passed, the match saw a series of throw-ins and ball clearances, demonstrating both teams' tactical adjustments and defensive organization. Celta Vigo had brief spells of possession, but it was Real Madrid who capitalized on these transitional moments.\n\nAt the 9:02 mark, Celta Vigo had their first notable shot on target. However, Real Madrid's goalkeeper was equal to the task and kept the scoreline intact. Then, an essential moment arrived for Real Madrid: precisely at 9:34, they broke the deadlock with a well-executed goal. The build-up play was intricate, as a deft pass penetrated Celta Vigo’s defensive line, allowing a Real forward to slot the ball into the net.\n\nCelta Vigo quickly restarted the game at 10:42, attempting to recover from the early setback. Their aggressive play led to a foul, signaling their frustration at being a goal down so early. Continuing their aggressive approach, Celta Vigo created two more shooting opportunities in quick succession around the 13th minute but failed to convert.\n\nReal Madrid tried to regain control but were hindered by fouls from both sides. Celta Vigo’s persistence resulted in moments of tension as their players tried to intimidate Real Madrid's midfielders with strong tackles. This tense atmosphere culminated at 16:11 with another shot on target from Celta Vigo, but Real’s defense held firm.\n\nCelta Vigo dominated the next few minutes, earning a corner and several throw-ins, yet couldn't find the back of the net. Shots off target and clearances punctuated this period, indicating their inability to capitalize on their opportunities. At 20:19, Real Madrid committed another foul, providing Celta Vigo with a set-piece. However, Real Madrid's resolute defending ensured that the threat was neutralized.\n\nPersistent fouls by Celta Vigo (21:51) and ball clearances by Real Madrid characterized the mid-stage of the first half. The game was fractious, with numerous stoppages in play, as both teams grappled for ascendancy. On the 29:06 mark, Real Madrid received the first yellow card of the game, reflecting the match's increasingly physical nature.\n\nThough Celta Vigo continued to battle, they couldn't manage effective shots, and their fouls broke the rhythm of the match. Real Madrid, cautious yet opportunistic, had another shot off target by 32:40. The balance of play seesawed with each team clearing their lines and throwing in balls that went straight out of play.\n\nTowards the end of the first half, Celta Vigo received a yellow card at 37:26, adding to their woes. The game saw more fouls, offside calls, and clearances, further underscoring the physicality and tactical discipline on display. As half-time approached, Real Madrid managed another shot on target at 44:31, signaling their continued attacking threat.\n\nThe second half began with Celta Vigo taking the kick-off. However, they never got to settle back into the game as Real Madrid quickly asserted themselves. Real Madrid hammered in their second goal at 02:21, dramatically shifting the momentum to their side. The goal showcased Real’s precise passing and clinical finishing.\n\nCelta Vigo resumed play at 03:36, but frustration mounted as their attempts were thwarted. They earned a corner at 05:26 but failed to break down Real’s defense. Persistent stoppages and throw-ins disrupted the game's flow until Celta Vigo’s discipline faltered dramatically.\n\nBetween 10:37 and 11:38, Celta Vigo committed back-to-back fouls that aggravated the tension. By 16:40, their player was shown a yellow card, which escalated into a red card given the severity of the infraction. This sending-off at 16:43 proved pivotal, leaving Celta Vigo with ten men and significantly weakening their structure.\n\nThe match dynamics shifted drastically as Real Madrid dominated possession. Further disruption occurred with multiple yellow cards shown to frustrated Celta Vigo players. A notable clearance by Celta Vigo at 19:14 was followed by a foul committed by Real Madrid, showing that tensions were high on both sides.\n\nCelta Vigo struggled to maintain their composure as their defensive efforts resulted in yet another yellow card at 20:27. Though they attempted to regroup with a direct free-kick at 21:17, the resultant play led to an offside requiring Real Madrid to regain control.\n\nA glimmer of hope for Celta Vigo came at the 22:22 mark with a shot on target, leading to a corner shortly after. This sequence paid off, culminating in Celta Vigo's goal at 23:17, giving them a fleeting lifeline. Once again, Real Madrid had to resume play from the center circle at 24:02.\n\nThis reprieve was short-lived as Real Madrid restored their two-goal advantage almost immediately with a brilliantly taken goal at 24:40. This swift response by Real Madrid broke Celta Vigo’s spirits further, and the score stood at 3-1. \n\nCelta Vigo substituted some players immediately afterward at 26:06, followed by Real Madrid making a substitution of their own to refresh their side. Attempts to claw back into the game by Celta Vigo saw them committing more fouls. A substitution and a foul by Celta at 27:10 led to yet another yellow card at 27:16. \n\nDespite being down a man, Celta Vigo persisted, managing a shot off target at 28:31. Multiple clearances by Celta Vigo marked an ongoing effort to contain Real Madrid, but the tide was unmistakably in favor of the visitors. Real Madrid’s offensive was relentless, though not all attempts were on target.\n\nAdding another layer of complexity, Real’s shot on target at 30:31 turned into a corner at 30:48. Both teams continued to substitute players as the pace remained high. The consistent fouls by Celta led to another tactical change at 34:25 with yet another substitution.\n\nThe closing phase of the match saw periodic stoppages and changes, but Real Madrid's dominance was evident when they secured their final goal at 42:30, effectively killing the game. They comfortably saw out the remaining minutes with clearances and sensible possession handling.\n\nAs the referee blew the final whistle, Real Madrid walked off victorious with a convincing 4-1 scoreline. They demonstrated clinical efficiency in front of goal and tactical superiority, leveraging their numerical advantage expertly following Celta Vigo’s red card.\n\nThis match was a testament to Real Madrid's quality and depth, emphasizing their proficient attacking prowess and disciplined defensive work. Conversely, for Celta Vigo, the game was a harsh lesson in maintaining discipline and composure under pressure. Their initial bright start dissolved into a series of costly errors, ultimately tipping the scales in Real Madrid’s favor."
