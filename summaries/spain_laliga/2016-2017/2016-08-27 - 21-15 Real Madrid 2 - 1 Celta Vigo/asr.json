We are still goalless. Real Madrid zero, Real Club Celta zero.\n26:23 Comment: Toni Kroos, Marcelo first.\n26:27 Comment: Marco Asensio wanted to get there but it seems that not even the Mallorcan could reach the Mallorcan on a motorcycle.\n26:32 Comment: So another goal kick for Sergio Álvarez.\n26:35 Comment: All those who had a very high grade in San Sebastián in the first match\n26:40 Comment: They are having very few numbers of interventions.\n26:42 Comment: We are not seeing Bale, Morata moves a lot but the midfielders can't find him.\n26:48 Comment: And neither did Asensio who tried in the first minutes to mix with the midfielders\n26:54 Comment: He is having continuity in the game.\n26:58 Comment: Guidetti goes to the ground, a foul is called, keep going, says de Burgos Bengoetxea.\n27:2 Comment: Baran, the ball is too powerful even for Bale.

One who leaves his own, Kroos.\n31:24 Comment: A pass, a first touch and one that arrives.\n31:28 Comment: Another one for Real Madrid, who look for the dead ball.\n31:30 Comment: Bale.\n31:32 Comment: The Ganes shot goes out.\n31:35 Comment: Real Madrid woke up in the final stretch of the first half.\n31:38 Comment: And as almost always happens, the alarm clock was rung by Modric.\n31:43 Comment: He's a superior player.\n31:45 Comment: This last shot was extraordinary.\n31:47 Comment: I was looking for the angle hard.\n31:50 Comment: Very good response from Sergio.\n31:53 Comment: And Bale finally appeared in that header that is one of his trademarks.\n32:0 Comment: Here we have the repetition of the shot and Sergio's very good response.\n32:6 Comment: There is a Cilta player lying on the pitch, Ricardo.\n32:9 Comment: Yes, in jumping it is John Guidetti, the one who complains of a problem with his knee or upper body.\n32:16 Comment: I think in the thigh part.\n32:18 Comment: Although he gets up limping, he continues the game.\n32:21 Comment: What a recovery for Tuco Hernández, who wanted to take a shot at Casemiro.\n32:26 Comment: Today Casemiro with Tuco Hernández sent the Chilean soccer player to the ground.\n32:31 Comment: To face the Real Madrid footballer, let's see what he decides.\n32:35 Comment: Echea comes from Burgos, the Celta footballer gets up now.\n32:38 Comment: The action we just saw in the bench area calls for him.\n32:43 Comment: But I think it's going to stay that way.\n32:45 Comment: From above it seemed like a push and the repetition has also been rebellious.\n32:49 Comment: Be careful that Guidetti also comes to complain to the linesman about the previous action.\n32:53 Comment: He complains about his thigh, footballers take advantage of it to cool off.\n32:57 Comment: Zidane to speak with Sergio Ramos, on the Celta bench also to speak with the coaching staff.\n33:2 Comment: Vlado Gudel has risen, Chendo de Burgos is also going.\n33:7 Comment: I come Echea says that everyone feels.\n33:9 Comment: Nothing has happened here as far as reprimands are concerned.\n33:13 Comment: Although he did tell Casemiro, the referee, what a peace of mind.\n33:18 Comment: Well, for now we have put out the first fire.\n33:20 Comment: What did you think of the play?\n33:22 Comment: In addition, he suffocated himself with water, because the most sensible thing they have done is to cool off and drink water.\n33:27 Comment: Because the temperature is very hot.\n33:31 Comment: The truth is that what just happened doesn't look like the game.\n33:34 Comment: So far it was very fluid and had very few aggressive plays.\n33:39 Comment: But let's not forget that Tuco Hernández, although he has a Chilean passport, is still an Argentine from the interior.\n33:43 Comment: So it's an Argentinian trying to hit a Brazilian.\n33:46 Comment: That's where the spark has to fly somehow.\n33:48 Comment: I didn't miss the detail.\n33:51 Comment: But on the other side you can also say that there has been contact.\n33:55 Comment: What happens is that I think the referee has read the game a little.\n33:59 Comment: He says, so far everything has gone well. It's a normal game.\n34:3 Comment: So, let's continue. I'm not going to start getting a card for something like that.\n34:7 Comment: But of course, if something happens now in two or three minutes, same line, I'm sure he'll win.\n34:14 Comment: Anyway, if he got a card we would have understood.\n34:17 Comment:  Yes too.\n34:18 Comment: That's why.\n34:20 Comment:  Sergio Ramos.\n34:22 Comment: He slows down under pressure from Guidetti.\n34:26 Comment: A touch back for Casilla. The former Manchester City player also hugs him.\n34:30 Comment: Perota above Casilla. Morata tries to get there. He does it, but he doesn't get it right with that touch to the right.\n34:36 Comment: Recovery of Celta.\n34:39 Comment: When we are already approaching the final stretch of the first half, the last ten minutes of the first act.\n34:46 Comment: In addition, Celta does not hold up like a survivor of those we have seen so many at the Bernabéu.\n34:51 Comment: With ten midfield players at the back.\n34:54 Comment: He is posing a match that subjects Real Madrid to many difficulties.\n35:1 Comment: It's forcing Real Madrid to think.\n35:3 Comment: Borges also doesn't know. He doesn't know how to put ten back there waiting for a counterattack.\n35:8 Comment: Yes, you can put it, but you don't know.\n35:11 Comment: What a ball from Tucu. Dani starts. The basketball player is enabled. Pisaria.\n35:14 Comment: The Dane wants Guidetti. Ball back. Marcelo plays it well.\n35:17 Comment: Snuggle Guidetti again.\n35:19 Comment: Celta can try again, as they prefer to let the ball go out to enjoy that throw-in.\n35:25 Comment: Once again leaving quickly. Once again with Pablo Hernández at the center of everything.\n35:30 Comment: It's true what Michael says.\n35:32 Comment: He doesn't know how to play Celta any other way.\n35:34 Comment: And that is a blessing for Spanish football.\n35:37 Comment: That there are so many teams that are capable of coming to the Bernabéu to propose.\n35:42 Comment: Providential the cut.

He was alone at the far post.\n36:17 Comment: Eduardo Berizzo's team is not wrinkled despite the recent push by Real Madrid\n36:21 Comment: with a shot against the crossbar from Luka Modric.\n36:26 Comment: We took advantage of the break in the game to see again that connection that we hope for\n36:30 Comment: stay there and don't go between Stuko Hernández and the Brazilian Casemiro.\n36:35 Comment: Now everything for Celta changes, Joni is inside the area, the control is not very good.\n36:39 Comment: Carvajal charged to take Joni Castro off the field.\n36:43 Comment: Goalkeeper kick for Kiko Casillas.\n36:53 Comment: Celta closes all exits, Casillas cannot go short.\n37:0 Comment: Morata paired with Roncaglia who goes to the ground.\n37:4 Comment: There is a foul, there is a foul on 21, there is a foul on Morata.\n37:8 Comment: Yes, the linesman complains, but the pressure from the Spanish national team international came under pressure.\n37:15 Comment: The foul that allows Celta to come back from behind.\n37:20 Comment: Radoja, Mayo goes up, Radoja holds on as he delivers for Orellana.\n37:28 Comment: Orellana with the outside deploying in attack against Bongonda who stops the center.\n37:31 Comment: He is one-on-one with Carvajal already inside the area, Bongonda follows, Bongonda puts it in.\n37:35 Comment: The rejection for Orellana stops his shot, he looks for the gap, Orellana continues.\n37:39 Comment: The autopass is excellent, more than Orellana is at the second post.\n37:42 Comment: Clear with your head Marcelo.\n37:45 Comment: Orellana's initiative on the left side is sensational.\n37:48 Comment: And be careful because this continues, Celta is still looking for 0-1.\n37:52 Comment: A new demonstration of tactical bravery.\n37:55 Comment: Three players arrived at Celta's shot before this overflow from Orellana that began to connect with the game.\n38:2 Comment: Once again the Chilean puts it Orellana, saves the penalty spot.\n38:5 Comment: Asensio assures with that opening towards the left side.\n38:8 Comment: Possession for Real Madrid.\n38:11 Comment: For Marcelo who is touched.\n38:13 Comment: In an action I think it was with John Guidetti 3-4 minutes ago inside the area.\n38:17 Comment: The tupo and Casemiro again, right?\n38:20 Comment: Yes, the Brazilian is now lying on the pitch.\n38:23 Comment: The lack of the signal to Burgos.\n38:24 Comment: I'm coming, Echea, warn you, but there will be no warning.\n38:27 Comment: I was saying that 3-4 minutes ago I think I remember an action inside the Real Madrid area.\n38:31 Comment: John Guidetti took over Marcelo.\n38:34 Comment: He complained at first but seemed recovered.\n38:37 Comment: Now not only the gesture of pain but also of despair from Marcelo.\n38:42 Comment: He continues to limp, it's his left ankle and he has discomfort.\n38:45 Comment: Let's see if the next few minutes can continue or not.\n38:48 Comment: At the moment no one is warming up on the Real Madrid bench.\n38:51 Comment: Exactly, it was in that action with Guidetti.\n38:53 Comment: I didn't expect him to have his rival behind him.\n38:57 Comment: Guidetti jammed and Marcelo's leg seemed weak.\n39:4 Comment: There may have been a slight sprain of the ankle.\n39:8 Comment: No one leaves the field because of a bad ankle.\n39:11 Comment: Because of the knee, yes, but because of the ankle, no one leaves the field of play.\n39:15 Comment: He is one of the most difficult players to replace at Real Madrid with permission from the figures above.\n39:19 Comment: Like, for example, Bale, who here rehearses that shot that goes into the hands of Sergio Álvarez.\n39:24 Comment: Be that as it may, on the substitute bench today for Zinedine Zidane in case he had to end up replacing Marcelo.\n39:30 Comment: Marcelo is in the goalkeeper, Yáñez, Pepe, James Rodríguez, Kovacic, Lucas Vázquez, Mariano and Danilo.\n39:36 Comment: Danilo would be the theoretical substitute to play either on the wing or with Carvajal on the left.\n39:45 Comment: There is Marcelo first for Morata who cuts.\n39:47 Comment: He slipped, he slipped, he fell again and it is not the first time that Morata loses his verticality in the middle of the play.\n39:56 Comment: All the coordination that he showed against Real Sociedad in the first game was not there today for Morata who is a bit fighting with the ball.\n40:9 Comment: Morata is still looking for his first goal in an official match since his return to Real Madrid.\n40:12 Comment: He did score in the Santiago Bernabéu trophy, but not in an official match or in the league premiere or in the European Super Cup.\n40:19 Comment: He doesn't get right for that ball.\n40:22 Comment: Goal kick for Real Club Celta de Vigo.\n40:24 Comment: And he seems more recovered, at least not so sore, Marcelo endures on the field of play.\n40:29 Comment: Well, there hasn't been any alarm on the Real Madrid bench.\n40:41 Comment: Since the construction of the game, Real Madrid only created dangers in medium and long distance shots.\n40:47 Comment: And then in a corner where Celta does show weaknesses since last season.\n40:52 Comment: In fact, he lost the first game there.\n40:57 Comment: And in those actions that Jorge mentioned in which Real Madrid has been able to bring danger to Celta's goal.\n41:2 Comment: Always or almost always in Genesis there was a dribble, a footballer eliminating a rival.\n41:7 Comment: That's no coincidence.\n41:8 Comment: No, that is essential to generate danger.\n41:13 Comment: Someone eliminate someone.\n41:15 Comment: Kroos did it on one occasion, Modri ​​on ours.\n41:18 Comment: But Real Madrid is lacking that individual inspiration to break lines.\n41:23 Comment: There is a very dangerous foul in favor of Celta.\n41:25 Comment: The foul committed on the Chilean Fabián Orellana.\n41:29 Comment: And it seems the Real Club Celta attacker himself is going to execute it.\n41:34 Comment: It's because no one stays around the ball.\n41:37 Comment: Only Fabián Orellana.\n41:39 Comment: Let's see if he looks for a goal or a finisher at the far post where, for example, John Guidetti is positioned.\n41:45 Comment: One, two, three, four, five, six from Celta looking for Orellana's possible center.\n41:50 Comment: Among them the centre-backs Roncaglia and Cabral.\n41:53 Comment: The Basque referee authorizes, Orellana's play mark.\n41:56 Comment: Orellana puts it in and he's shooting for the penalty spot.\n41:59 Comment: Rejected by the Real Madrid defense.\n42:1 Comment: Rejection for Arradoya, Arradoya takes off.\n42:3 Comment: Kiko Casillas catches.\n42:5 Comment: Marcelo is looking for something quick.\n42:10 Comment: Hold on Marcelo, the Celta players covered him well.\n42:14 Comment: Casemiro was about to lose her.\n42:16 Comment: It comes out with a little fortune and a lot of power.\n42:19 Comment: On the 14th, withstand the onslaught of May.\n42:21 Comment: Touch back and Celta once again regained positions in defense.\n42:24 Comment: As long as I keep accumulating approaches.\n42:26 Comment: The last one is Arradoya's shot.\n42:28 Comment: Having the centre-backs drive is a good idea.\n42:31 Comment: But having the center midfielder lead the way is not such a good idea.\n42:34 Comment: It's a good idea especially if it's so serious.\n42:36 Comment: Carry, carry, carry.\n42:40 Comment: There you really have to play your touches.\n42:44 Comment: Marcelo for Toni Kroos.\n42:50 Comment: Ramos.\n42:55 Comment: Barán delivers for Luka Modric.\n42:57 Comment: What a detail with the exterior.\n42:58 Comment: Go straight, Modric continues.\n43:0 Comment: Raise your head First.\n43:1 Comment: Bale, this explosive in the front.\n43:2 Comment: Kroos for Morata.\n43:3 Comment: Morata is offside.\n43:5 Comment: Morata is not enabled.\n43:7 Comment: The possibility is lost for Real Madrid.\n43:10 Comment: What's wrong with Berizzo?\n43:12 Comment: Well, he is desperate right now with his footballers.\n43:15 Comment: How can he allow that ball to finally reach the area where Morata was.\n43:20 Comment: Celta was holding up well at times in this first half.\n43:24 Comment: But Berizzo seeks to ensure that there is less and less danger in Sergio's goal.\n43:30 Comment: We have just seen the repetition of that offside signal against Morata.\n43:33 Comment:  What do you think?\n43:34 Comment:  Very fair.\n43:35 Comment: Very fair, but we must highlight the play, Modric's first touch.\n43:39 Comment: Look again.\n43:40 Comment: Receive back.\n43:42 Comment: Take one out with a touch like that.\n43:45 Comment: He has KO\n43:46 Comment: He's leaving.\n43:47 Comment: And once again danger is created.\n43:52 Comment: Radoya.\n43:54 Comment: He turns to Kroos.\n43:56 Comment: Touch back for Cabral.\n44:1 Comment: Receive Roncaglia.\n44:3 Comment: Real Madrid's pressure is good.\n44:5 Comment: It became night for Radoya.\n44:6 Comment: About to lose.\n44:7 Comment: There is a lack of Modric.\n44:11 Comment: After he was about to get into trouble, it wasn't Radoya but Pablo Hernández.\n44:15 Comment: In a middle defensive mess.\n44:17 Comment: Back to the opposite.\n44:19 Comment: Who wants to stop the value.\n44:23 Comment: The story starts badly and usually ends badly.\n44:26 Comment: I think it's on page 2 or 3 of the book.\n44:30 Comment: What not to do.\n44:35 Comment: Pablo Hernández for Daniel Vaz.\n44:39 Comment: Celta's three midfielders have made a great effort in this first half.\n44:44 Comment: That's where Real Madrid might find a little more ease in the second half.\n44:50 Comment: That's where I wanted to ask you, Jorge.\n44:51 Comment: What did you like most about this first part that is about to end?\n44:54 Comment: Celta's midfield seemed very solid to me.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Modri ​​taught the path but for that contribution we also need more\n0:5 Comment: commitment of the two full-backs, both Marcelo and Carvajal have to show\n0:10 Comment: more depth than shown in the first half so that real madrid\n0:14 Comment: It ends up being just another game.

important.\n12:48 Comment: Because he is one of those players.\n12:49 Comment: That eliminates rivals very easily.\n12:56 Comment: And at this point, José, it is very difficult not to remember

little surprising is the defense there.\n15:19 Comment: Because Asensio was completely alone.\n15:21 Comment: Then secondly Asensio wanted to make her bite again.\n15:27 Comment: Instead of dribbling past the goalkeeper or shooting harder.\n15:32 Comment: And in the end Morata got his goal.\n15:35 Comment: We had to wait an hour for the game.\n15:38 Comment: But Ricardo has already shouted the

Well that is the analysis that must be done.\n20:44 Comment: do, that is, it is clear that with the entry of Lucas Zidane he is looking for something else, if he were looking for something\n20:49 Comment: It seemed he would have taken out James, but when Lucas enters he looks for a more point of balance, perhaps\n20:56 Comment: a little more speed in the last meters.\n21:2 Comment: When Madrid scores a goal, it becomes a totally different team, it begins to find\n21:7 Comment: spaces and these are players who know what to do with spaces. No, the opposite knows it too,\n21:13 Comment: that's why yes,\n21:14 Comment: He also knows it, that's why\n21:14 Comment: Come on we have to attack because we are losing, but you know that at any time...\n21:19 Comment: Guietti leaves for Orellana, Orellana hits him...\n21:23 Comment: Goal!\n21:33 Comment: From Celta '66, goal by Fabián Orellana, in that action started by Daniel Vás,\n21:40 Comment: ball to Guietti, who pivots, keeps it, wants to turn around and delivers it face-to-face,\n21:44 Comment: for the arrival of Orellana, who hits that shot off the post to tie the game again,\n21:49 Comment: Celta scores, Fabián Orellana scores, Real Madrid 1, Real Club Celta 1.\n21:56 Comment: And just at this moment where it seemed like he had scored a lot against Real Madrid's goal, he scored the tying goal.\n22:4 Comment: Yes, Celta needed it like water, Morata had the chance to make it 2-0 in that play,\n22:13 Comment: to kill the...\n22:14 Comment: The truth is that the match was defined very well, that is, first the acceleration, unstoppable, won that race,\n22:23 Comment: and then it hit the outside, very soft, and just by an inch, that ball missed the goal.\n22:29 Comment: And the Celta replica, sensational.\n22:30 Comment: Sensational, a very well-crafted play again, this time they found the last pass, which is what was missing,\n22:37 Comment: and Orellana, who has been growing as the game has progressed, is already over...\n22:44 Comment: Becoming one of Celta's most important players with this goal.\n22:49 Comment: Well, Orellana appeared again, seven goals last season, first goal this season, be careful Marcelo.\n22:54 Comment: Marcelo's ball went too far, Carvajal, paired with Bongonda, will try to save it.\n23:0 Comment: The Leganés side has the lead there, but Bongonda keeps it.\n23:3 Comment: Lucas Vázquez ends up receiving a foul, Ricardo said.\n23:6 Comment: Yes, I said that there was also going to be a change at Celta, Yago Aspas was going to come in, and now the one who joins Real has warmed up again.\n23:14 Comment: Real Madrid is James Rodríguez, last Sunday in Anota it was the third change, now it is the second.\n23:20 Comment: Luka Modric retires, who could not play in San Sebastián due to suspension, Zinedine Zidane has given the Croatian a little more than an hour today.\n23:28 Comment: The Colombian enters again, we are going to see the public's response, and we must clear up their doubts.\n23:33 Comment: Will these be James' last minutes at Real Madrid because he leaves, or finally remains in the squad, the number 10 of Zinedine Zidane's squad?\n23:41 Comment: People still believe in James.\n23:43 Comment: Everyone accepts that he is a player who has enormous quality, and he just needs to be able to find confidence, which a player of that style needs from his coach.\n23:56 Comment: And now Aspas is going to go.\n23:58 Comment: But now this change is a risk, because you remove a midfielder, apart from Modric, who for me is the best midfielder that Madrid has, for an almost mid-forward.\n24:11 Comment: You are going to play with four very very beautiful players.\n24:13 Comment: And you leave the midfield to Casimiro and Kroos.\n24:18 Comment: Bale's center was excellent, Morata did not arrive, he fell in the area and timidly claimed something in that friction with Facundo Roncaglia.\n24:27 Comment: More the public than him.\n24:29 Comment: The referee of the Vasco de Burgos match, Ben Guechea, did not notice anything.\n24:35 Comment: So Celta will take the sideline, which as Ricardo said, also has the change prepared.\n24:40 Comment: He postponed it at one point, but now Iago Aspas is coming.\n24:43 Comment: Yes, we must remember that he has been in trouble all week, considered a doubt for today's game.\n24:48 Comment: He was in the squad, Toto Berizzo left him on the bench, but he turned to him for these last minutes of the game and with a 1-1 tie.\n24:56 Comment: I was going to go in before the goal, in the end this was a matter of minutes.\n24:59 Comment: The forward from Moaña is going to enter the field of play.\n25:2 Comment: Casemiro.\n25:4 Comment: He wants to connect with James.\n25:6 Comment: The Colombian just arrived.\n25:8 Comment: Radoja.\n25:10 Comment: Back for Cabral.\n25:11 Comment: Danger for Celta.\n25:12 Comment: With that intense pressure from Real Madrid.\n25:15 Comment: Gustavo Cabral managed to touch behind for Sergio's goal.\n25:19 Comment: And from Sergio to Sergio.\n25:20 Comment: There's Ramos.\n25:21 Comment: Delivering for Casillas the presence of John Guidetti.\n25:24 Comment: Celta has to be careful at the start because it is through pressure where Real Madrid was able to generate more danger.\n25:31 Comment: More than through the construction of the game.\n25:35 Comment: James receives between the lines.\n25:37 Comment: He turns around.\n25:38 Comment: Tuco Hernández watches over him.\n25:39 Comment: Ball from James towards Morata.\n25:42 Comment: He shows it to Cabral.\n25:43 Comment: Then he takes it off.\n25:44 Comment: Ball for James.\n25:45 Comment: You want to finish it off.\n25:46 Comment: James to the ground.\n25:47 Comment: Penalty is requested.\n25:49 Comment: And the referee says no.\n25:50 Comment: That was a corner.\n25:51 Comment: He signals the corner kick.\n25:52 Comment: However, James stands up.\n25:54 Comment: He claims a penalty against De Brugos.\n25:55 Comment: Chea is coming.\n25:56 Comment: The referee says no.\n25:57 Comment: Let's see.\n25:58 Comment: I have more questions here.\n25:59 Comment: But it's a very good play by James there.\n26:3 Comment: The race continues there.\n26:4 Comment: Shot from the Real Madrid corner.\n26:5 Comment: It's a goal.\n26:15 Comment: We have to re-enter the circle at Real Madrid's corner.\n26:16 Comment: From the ball to the penalty spot.\n26:17 Comment: Very high finish.\n26:18 Comment: Sergio Álvarez comes out of his goal and puts his fists in.\n26:19 Comment: Álvaro Morata can rework the action.\n26:20 Comment: He is close to Lucas Vázquez.\n26:22 Comment: Morata enters.\n26:23 Comment: Very passed ball.\n26:24 Comment: Varane loves her.\n26:25 Comment: Rejection on the front.\n26:26 Comment: For whom?\n26:27 Comment: Casemiro with everything.\n26:28 Comment: Casemiro twice.\n26:29 Comment: He pushes her away, as best as the center defense can.\n26:30 Comment: His control is slipping.\n26:31 Comment: Abbas.\n26:32 Comment: A throw-in for Real Madrid.\n26:33 Comment: He controlled the throw-in for Real Madrid quickly, what did you think was an action in which\n26:38 Comment: Shut up James, I'm not staying, I'm still left with doubts but it doesn't seem like enough to score.\n26:44 Comment: the field of play is going to enter the field of play and guapas leaves the surprise in the\n26:52 Comment: alignment of toto berizzo let's see what movements for the market because we have to\n26:57 Comment: remember that Josep Perros is going to arrive and followed by Rafiore to the Píguez team, let's see which one\n27:2 Comment: It is the situation in which the rest of the points that Benito has in his squad remain included\n27:7 Comment: the posture or better said position of john guidetti with some changes is also understood\n27:13 Comment: from fatigue, not Modri's, in case it may be, it must also be analyzed from performance\n27:22 Comment: he did not deserve the change and in the case of guillete and I suppose that the shots will also go there because\n27:27 Comment: He has not had the entire game but there have been lapses in the game in which he had a job\n27:31 Comment: and\n27:32 Comment: at least ungrateful turns around to lucas\n27:38 Comment: carvajal again lucas inside the area tries to center the roncaglia stage that he is completing\n27:44 Comment: a very good game from the two centre-backs, anyway, real madrid is starting to accelerate\n27:50 Comment: enters that phase where it is very difficult to stop harassment and demolition if the quality is not enough\n27:57 Comment: insistence is enough but these last minutes of the bernabéu are not easy for the\n28:2 Comment: opponents Abel complains about a stomp but the game does not stop even though Marcelo seemed\n28:8 Comment: Having stopped the action, Madrid continues playing, Morata combines with Marcelo, who is already in the area, continues\n28:16 Comment: martín more and more but the basque referee this is the celta's exit with a bottle after a\n28:28 Comment: A wonderful detail. Bongonda for Blades. They took Bongonda ahead, I think.\n28:32 Comment: The referee let the referee continue. Real Madrid plays again. Gains pace in the final stretch.\n28:38 Comment: This clash on the second day of the Santander League.\n28:43 Comment: Marcellus. He asks for it Bale. Morata. Ball to the center for James Rodríguez.\n28:52 Comment: Morata stands out too many times from the inside out.\n28:57 Comment: He has to do exactly the opposite. Come out from inside and face towards the goal.\n29:4 Comment: That's where it becomes very difficult to stop it.\n29:9 Comment: They stop. Tapping quickly to the right. For the center, Real Madrid.\n29:14 Comment: There's Lucas. He puts it Lucas without problems for Sergio Álvarez.\n29:17 Comment: Has something happened to Marcelo, Ricardo?\n29:18 Comment: He was complaining about a foul by Tuco Hernández, which I think was a bit too much.\n29:22 Comment: A little late in the gesture. The Brazilian complained. He got up without any problem. The action continued.\n29:28 Comment: Orellana. She asks for it in front of Radoja. The scorer of the Vigués team's goal is stopped.\n29:35 Comment: Casemiro stops him. That he is closing gaps everywhere when he tries to respond with some counterattack.\n29:42 Comment: Celta increasingly isolated because Madrid's harassment is beginning to be insistent.\n29:51 Comment: Cabral.\n29:52 Comment: Valada up looking for Orellana. It goes with all bouquets.\n29:57 Comment: Powerful the Andalusian central. Clearing Valonda. Down, James. There is a lack.\n30:4 Comment: And Pape Chey is going to enter. Footballer born in Dakar. Senegalese.\n30:11 Comment: But who can we consider a Celta de Vigo youth squad because he has gone through the lower categories of the Galician team.\n30:17 Comment: Very young footballer. 19 years old. It's from August 97.\n30:22 Comment: He arrived in Spain 5 years ago. He has been international in lower categories.\n30:28 Comment: And here it is at the Bernabéu.\n30:29 Comment: And now he appears at the Bernabéu. And that in the final stretch of this summer there was talk of a possible departure for him to take minutes on loan to another team.\n30:38 Comment: Peace leaves. That can also go there. Because of the fatigue. Due to the wear and tear of the men above Celta's pressure.\n30:45 Comment: You want to refresh the Toto Berizzo. That part of the team. Give him the freshness to also look for 1-2 speed.\n30:52 Comment: Celta is far from able to defend the 1-1 draw here.\n30:56 Comment: Daniel Vaz leaves. Enter Pape Sheik. The match signed by the Danish player is sensational.\n31:7 Comment: Yes, a tremendous display. He lacked clarity in the last meters. But he has made a very, very big contribution.\n31:13 Comment: Shot to the far post looking for Ramos who ended up on the ground.\n31:16 Comment: The ball goes out the side. It's a throw-in. By the way, we were seeing that goal action repeated.\n31:22 Comment: Morata's goal. Mariano goes. And the possibility that Morata was ahead at the origin of the play.\n31:27 Comment: Before he lets her pass to enable Asensio. And then in that continuation is when the Real Madrid attacker ends up scoring.\n31:34 Comment: I don't know if it would be considered a new move. If it is understood that it has been taken advantage of.\n31:38 Comment: Action of those complex due to having to discern or discriminate where the action begins and where it ends.\n31:44 Comment: And where does the next one start? To all this the change. Sorry Ricardo.\n31:46 Comment: Yes, Morata leaves quickly in a hurry. Mariano enters. Another man.\n31:51 Comment: He is the champion of the Real Madrid quarry.\n31:53 Comment: He spoke a lot this summer about his possibility of joining any team in the Spanish League.\n31:58 Comment: Because he had many teams interested in having him.\n32:1 Comment: Finally he has stayed and with that number 18 he will have his opportunity.\n32:7 Comment: In fact, there he is touching his first ball. He hits Mariano against Hugo Mayo's body.\n32:12 Comment: It is clear what Mariano is dedicated to. What is scoring goals? The first one that fell to her, she looked for the shot on goal.\n32:17 Comment: And if it fell on the bench he would have also shot on goal.\n32:19 Comment: He is a player with tremendous determination.\n32:21 Comment: For the finish. He is a huge finisher.\n32:24 Comment: And that's why the game ends up needing a player with these characteristics.\n32:30 Comment: Because many centers are falling from outside that have not found a finisher.\n32:35 Comment: Marcelo let her pass. Orellana is missing there. Mariano, by the way, was born in Premia de Mar.\n32:40 Comment: But international through the Dominican Republic. Since his mother is of that nationality.\n32:46 Comment: Well, it's preseason. But his great goal against Chelsea also attracted a lot of attention.\n32:51 Comment: In the preparation games this summer.\n32:54 Comment: Center James. Look for the second. The real Madrid. Ball to the second. Ramos did not come close.\n32:58 Comment: The rejection for Carvajal. Let him try again. He calls it Carvajal.\n33:1 Comment: Very passed ball. James saves her. Third attempt for the white box.\n33:6 Comment: Clear as best Hugo Mayo can. He didn't manage to push her away completely.\n33:10 Comment: James nods. Real Madrid insists.\n33:15 Comment: Toni Kroos. Marcellus.\n33:17 Comment: Bale.\n33:21 Comment: Hold on Bale. He puts Hugo Mayo in the second.\n33:25 Comment: Stick! The ending was very complex. It was an almost Cruyff-like finish.\n33:29 Comment: What Sergio Ramos was trying to do. Corner kick for the white box.\n33:34 Comment: And Madrid to Madrid. Throwing all the load of talent, of physical presence, of football on top of him.\n33:43 Comment: That is, insisting.\n33:45 Comment: Six in white looking for the finish.\n33:47 Comment: He played in defense of the near post.\n33:49 Comment: The rejection will be for James Rodríguez.\n33:53 Comment: Marcelo is going to double him. Hole for the center.\n33:55 Comment: The ten puts it behind the goalkeeper's back.\n33:57 Comment: What a doubt. He manages to extend Zidane's team at the far post.\n34:1 Comment: Although he doesn't find a finisher.\n34:3 Comment: And this is the departure of Pappes Seik.\n34:5 Comment: Accompanied by Bongonda. Pappes Seik continues to drive.\n34:7 Comment: Peace of Senegalese.\n34:9 Comment: Seik sets her looking for Bongonda.\n34:11 Comment: The telegraphed pass.\n34:13 Comment: Kroos ended up recovering it.\n34:15 Comment: In what was an impeccable exit to the counterattack for Berizzo's team.\n34:17 Comment: He took it late at a time.\n34:19 Comment: One second late.\n34:21 Comment: They were almost three against one.\n34:23 Comment: Michael was drooling next to me.\n34:25 Comment: Because those were the passes that you couldn't even miss.\n34:27 Comment: Gareth Bale tries to prepare for the strike.\n34:29 Comment: He leaves it behind for Carvajal.\n34:31 Comment: Facing and overflowing.\n34:33 Comment: There's the serve from the right.\n34:35 Comment: Bale wants it.\n34:37 Comment: Sergio Álvarez has covered.\n34:39 Comment: Catoira's goalkeeper keeps it in two halves.\n34:41 Comment: That just overflowed.\n34:43 Comment: And the goal on the right.\n34:45 Comment: Catoira's goalkeeper.\n34:47 Comment: Who just saved Celta.\n34:49 Comment: All good Bale.\n34:51 Comment: It was suspended in the air.\n34:53 Comment: And when we were about to shout the goal appeared.\n34:55 Comment: Again Sergio.\n34:57 Comment: To solve a problem that already seemed definitive.\n35:1 Comment: It comes one against one.\n35:3 Comment: Sorry.\n35:5 Comment: It comes one against one.\n35:7 Comment: There.\n35:9 Comment: The header was very focused.\n35:13 Comment: More for Real Madrid.\n35:15 Comment: Marcellus.\n35:17 Comment: Marcelo steps on it.\n35:19 Comment: He is about to lose Susi.\n35:21 Comment: He lost her.\n35:23 Comment: Orellana starts.\n35:25 Comment: Orellana on the highway.\n35:27 Comment: Leave Ramos behind.\n35:29 Comment: But Marcelo can recover.\n35:31 Comment: And he keeps that ball.\n35:33 Comment: Fabián Orellana is more than clearly missing.\n35:35 Comment: Marcelo got angry with that gesture.\n35:37 Comment: I don't know if it was because of the ball I had lost.\n35:39 Comment: Or for the lack that could be left without yellow.\n35:41 Comment: Pappesheik.\n35:43 Comment: Recovery of Real Madrid.\n35:45 Comment: Leave your area.\n35:47 Comment: Roncagna and he is wrong.\n35:49 Comment: Lucas Vázquez inside the area.\n35:51 Comment: Lucas steps on it.\n35:53 Comment: Left for Toni Kroos.\n35:55 Comment: Good good good.\n35:57 Comment: Goal.\n36:9 Comment: From Real Madrid of '81.\n36:11 Comment: Goal by Toni Kroos.\n36:13 Comment: With that recovery close to the rival goal.\n36:15 Comment: And the abandonment of Lucas Vázquez.\n36:17 Comment: Which is almost an invitation to shoot.\n36:19 Comment: To make it look pretty.\n36:21 Comment: With delicacy Toni Kroos.\n36:23 Comment: Paves inside.\n36:25 Comment: He is Real Madrid's second.\n36:27 Comment: Kroos brand.\n36:29 Comment: Real Madrid 2.\n36:31 Comment: Real Club Celta 1.\n36:33 Comment: It was becoming more and more difficult for Celta to get out of the cave.\n36:35 Comment: Here chirps on the Madrid ball.\n36:37 Comment: James recovers again.\n36:39 Comment: If that is.\n36:41 Comment: To Canelita.\n36:43 Comment: It's a great exam.\n36:45 Comment: That more defensive consistency is required.\n36:47 Comment: It is the second ball he recovers.\n36:49 Comment: Since he entered.\n36:51 Comment: The second ball that fights as Real Madrid fans like it.\n36:53 Comment: And as for the shot.\n36:55 Comment: It has been perfect.\n36:57 Comment: You couldn't hit it better.\n36:59 Comment: You can't hit any harder.\n37:1 Comment: Tighter.\n37:3 Comment: Real Madrid was taking a risk.\n37:5 Comment: He paid for it with a couple of counterpunches.\n37:7 Comment: Very very dangerous.\n37:9 Comment: But.\n37:11 Comment: I wanted to win so badly.\n37:13 Comment: But.\n37:15 Comment: It didn't stick.\n37:17 Comment: And it stuck.\n37:21 Comment: But.\n37:23 Comment: Really.\n37:25 Comment: It stuck.\n37:27 Comment: And it stuck.\n37:29 Comment: But.\n37:31 Comment: The ball he put on it.\n37:33 Comment: But.\n37:35 Comment: It stuck.\n37:37 Comment: But.\n37:41 Comment: What Celta will not find anymore.\n37:43 Comment: They are spaces for counterattack.\n37:45 Comment: Evidently.\n37:47 Comment: That's what he asked for.\n37:49 Comment: Sissou.\n37:51 Comment: I was trying to combine.\n37:53 Comment: Yago Aspas with Pape Sheik.\n37:55 Comment: Piones Sisto.\n37:57 Comment: Piones Sisto is coming.\n37:59 Comment: He is taking off his breastplate.\n38:1 Comment: He's putting on his shirt.\n38:3 Comment: So it will be the last change at Celta.\n38:5 Comment: There you have it.\n38:7 Comment: From what we understand.\n38:9 Comment: Celta is fast, powerful.\n38:11 Comment: The winner.\n38:13 Comment: Above all, a lot of strength.\n38:15 Comment: Yes Yes.\n38:17 Comment: Obviously.\n38:19 Comment: I have already said before.\n38:21 Comment: You have to see it at this level.\n38:23 Comment: You have to give it time.\n38:25 Comment: Let's now think that it is going to revolutionize the entire Spanish league.\n38:27 Comment: But it does have that quality.\n38:29 Comment: One against one.\n38:31 Comment: It's powerful.\n38:33 Comment: It's fast.\n38:35 Comment: In all of this he fits perfectly into this team.\n38:37 Comment: How Celta plays.\n38:39 Comment: They will look for a dead ball tie.\n38:41 Comment: The Totoverizzo cast.\n38:43 Comment: At the Orellana launch.\n38:45 Comment: And one, two, three, four, five blue shirts looking for the finish.\n38:51 Comment: There goes Orellana.\n38:53 Comment: Orellana puts it with a thread.\n38:55 Comment: Marcasillas comes out first.\n38:57 Comment: Rejection for Bongonda.\n38:59 Comment: Upstairs Theo Bongonda's header.\n39:1 Comment: That he has not been able to take advantage of the error in the departure of Kiko Casillas.\n39:5 Comment: Yes, Kiko Casillas did not measure well.\n39:9 Comment: And that rebound ended up generating a lot of danger.\n39:13 Comment: He headed very poorly, but the goal was empty.\n39:17 Comment: I take advantage of the replay of the goal.\n39:21 Comment: To point out the Totoverizzo gesture.\n39:25 Comment: After that mistake by Casillas that his team has not taken advantage of.\n39:27 Comment: Hands on head, regretting her.\n39:29 Comment: That could have been one of the clearest opportunities.\n39:31 Comment: What Celta can have between now and the end of the game.\n39:33 Comment: To achieve a tie.\n39:37 Comment: And the game goes sideways.\n39:39 Comment: The lateral service for Marcelo.\n39:41 Comment: The change that seems not...\n39:43 Comment: Yes, yes, it does happen.\n39:45 Comment: Goes Piones Isto.\n39:47 Comment: And the one who is going to retire Radoya.\n39:49 Comment: That is, a defensive midfielder that the Serbian footballer still has arrived.\n39:51 Comment: So that Piones Isto enters.\n39:53 Comment: One of the new faces of this Santander League.\n39:55 Comment: The one who will have six minutes left and added time.\n39:57 Comment: To try to change the sign of the party.\n40:1 Comment: Well, a midfielder is leaving.\n40:3 Comment: And Piones Isto enters.\n40:5 Comment: So he's going with everything he has.\n40:7 Comment: And now there is Celta.\n40:9 Comment: With all the risk it can take.\n40:11 Comment: Against a team like Real Madrid.\n40:13 Comment: Who is going to take advantage of the spaces now.\n40:15 Comment: To counter hit.\n40:17 Comment: Pongonda.\n40:19 Comment: I wanted to connect with Iago Aspas.\n40:21 Comment: Piones Isto is already located at the right end.\n40:23 Comment: One of the players.\n40:25 Comment: With a more curious biography of the PBVA League.\n40:27 Comment: Born in Kampala, Uganda.\n40:29 Comment: From South Sudanese parents.\n40:31 Comment: And arrived in Denmark with two months.\n40:33 Comment: That's called globalization.\n40:35 Comment: Correct.\n40:37 Comment: Celta tries to enter through the left sector.\n40:39 Comment: But Sergio Ramos doesn't allow it.\n40:41 Comment: It's Carvajal.\n40:43 Comment: Carvajal's clearance.\n40:45 Comment: The Tuku keeps it.\n40:47 Comment: That changes everything.\n40:49 Comment: Hugo Mayo appears there.\n40:51 Comment: Head control was not easy.\n40:53 Comment: He oriented himself well.\n40:55 Comment: Follow Marín's.\n40:57 Comment: There's May.\n40:59 Comment: May puts it.\n41:1 Comment: Second suit.\n41:3 Comment: Aspas loved her.\n41:5 Comment: But he turned around.\n41:7 Comment: He turned around like a fool.\n41:9 Comment: The game

    "summary": "Real Madrid faced off against Celta Vigo in an electrifying contest at the Santiago Bernabéu, pushing both teams to their limits. Real Madrid emerged victorious with a scoreline of 2-1, but the game was rich in tactical intrigue, near-miracle saves, and moments of individual brilliance.\n\nThe first half commenced with Real Madrid controlling the tempo, trying to dominate possession and dictating play. Early on, a ball was launched up by Gustavo Cabral, but no dangerous chances materialized. Teo Bongonda and Guidetti attempted to exploit Real Madrid’s defenses, but efforts were thwarted by the defensive prowess of Rafael Varane and Casemiro. As the Galician side applied high pressure, Real Madrid sought to alleviate it through long deliveries, mostly targeting Álvaro Morata, who was filling in for the absent Cristiano Ronaldo.\n\nMorata's energy and pressing were notable, creating several chaotic moments in Celta’s small area, where he demonstrated his strength and maturity. However, Real Madrid couldn’t find their forward players like Gareth Bale and Marco Asensio often enough. Still, Luka Modric, with his remarkable control, attempted to pierce the Galician defense. In the most dazzling moment of the first half, Modric let fly a long-range shot that smashed into the crossbar, a powerful reminder of his ability to change the game with a single strike.\n\nDespite Real Madrid’s endeavors, Celta was impressive in spells, managing to retain possession and exhibit composure under pressure. The midfield trio of Radoja, Tuco Hernández, and Daniel Vás were industrious and often initiated promising attacks. Notably, Hernández proved to be instrumental in driving the team forward. A resurgent Orellana combined well with Bongonda on the wings. Unfortunately for Celta, their finishing lacked the precision necessary to trouble Kiko Casillas significantly.\n\nBoth managers remained actively animated on the touchlines, with Zinedine Zidane and Eduardo Berizzo instructing their players tirelessly. This level of engagement highlighted the game's strategic complexity.\n\nAs the teams returned for the second half, the intensity of the contest increased. Real Madrid immediately looked more cohesive in their attacking exploits. Early on, an exquisite move saw Modric feed the ball to Bale, who was held back only by Johnny Castro’s tenacity, leading to a Real Madrid corner. Persistence from Madrid against Celta's structured defense soon paid dividends.\n\nDespite the continuous pressure, Celta remained poised and conjured up attacks of their own. Teo Bongonda, a clear threat on the flank, nearly brought Celta back into the game early in the second half but his decision-making faltered at crucial moments.\n\nThe pressure from Los Blancos finally bore fruit in the 59th minute. A quick transition from Luka Modric caught Celta’s defense off-guard, as Marco Asensio was put through on goal. Though Sergio Álvarez made a stunning save against Asensio’s effort, the rebound fell invitingly for Morata, who rifled it into the roof of the net, finally breaking the deadlock. This goal was a significant moment for Morata, marking his return to the goal sheet for Real Madrid.\n\nCelta's response was swift and lethal. Not cowed by the setback, the Galician side surged forward. In the 66th minute, a well-orchestrated play initiated by Daniel Vás found Guidetti, who expertly shielded the ball before laying it off for Orellana. The Chilean’s precise effort rippled the net as it flew past Casillas and struck the post, equalizing the score and demonstrating Celta's resilience.\n\nThe match turned into a frenetic tussle post the equalizer, with both teams pushing for a winner. Zidane’s tactical acumen came into play as he made changes to add fresh legs to the contest. Lucas Vázquez replaced Asensio to provide width and directness on the flanks, while James Rodríguez was introduced for Modric to exploit spaces between Celta’s midfield and defense.\n\nReal Madrid continued to pour forward in waves. Still, it was Celta who nearly took the lead again through efforts orchestrated by Orellana and Tuco Hernández. However, Real Madrid showed their determination and enviable squad depth. In the 81st minute, another rapid Madrid counter saw Lucas Vázquez set up Toni Kroos on the edge of the box. The German’s precision shot nestled into the bottom corner, restoring Real Madrid’s dominance on the scoreboard.\n\nLate in the game, Celta rallied to claw back another equalizer. Berizzo brought on attacker Pione Sisto in place of defensive midfielder Radoja, illustrating his intent to chase the game till the final whistle. Yet, Real Madrid's defensive unit, led by Ramos and Varane, held firm. Kiko Casillas tipped away a dangerous Bongonda header, while Marcelo and Carvajal consistently thwarted Celta’s wing play.\n\nDespite several near-miss encounters in the dying minutes, including a couple of sumptuous crosses not met cleanly by Mariano, Real Madrid managed to hold on to their slim advantage, securing all three points.\n\nThis match showcased Real Madrid's tactical flexibility and depth, whereas Celta's spirited performance suggested they could be formidable adversaries this season. Both managers will take valuable lessons from this tactical chess match, with Zidane perhaps most satisfied with a hard-earned victory that showcased his team's ability to win under persistent pressure."
