passive.\n24:35 Comment: So this offside rule makes perfect sense.\n24:38 Comment: Because Lewandowski and Robben are actually passive in this situation and have nothing to do with it.\n24:43 Comment:

We won't defend for 90 minutes because we can't.\n27:33 Comment: But right now it looks like they have to.\n27:38 Comment: Kostas corner.\n27:41 Comment: This error.\n27:44 Comment: Kimmich and Vidal.

lucek against robben\n21:41 Comment: dangerous play from the Stuttgart central defender against the Dutchman.\n21:55 Comment: Here again, Robben protects himself by jumping up.\n21:58 Comment: Thank God he did that, otherwise Lussek would probably have met him there.\n22:3 Comment: With the studs first, when the tackle is getting tough, you can definitely think about a yellow card.\n22:7 Comment: But overall it was a decent game, so Bastian Dankert probably saw no reason to issue a warning.\n22:18 Comment: Robben's free kick is offside.\n22:29 Comment: Yes, correct.\n22:37 Comment: So, there you see Thiago coming into the game for Costa.\n22:45 Comment: Of course, despite the many absences, the squad is still large enough to bring Thiago off the bench.\n22:51 Comment: There you see Costas' 2-0 after Müller's assist.\n23:0 Comment: Thiago nominated for the national team of Spain.\n23:7 Comment: And then comes the ball.\n23:9 Comment: Friendly matches against England and Belgium

Davy.\n24:39 Comment: Werner is offside.\n24:45 Comment: But Insua could have gone through.\n24:49 Comment: At least that was my impression.\n24:52 Comment: Because he wasn't offside.\n24:55 Comment: That would definitely be the case.\n24:57 Comment: Well, that's already too far.\n24:58 Comment: Played away by the left defender.\n25:0 Comment: Werner was clearly offside.\n25:2 Comment: So the Stuttgart city authorities.\n25:4 Comment: so Stuttgart still have 20 minutes left until the end of this\n25:9 Comment: game always manage to initiate offensive actions via the Davi but that\n25:17 Comment: most importantly, they do not allow so many shortcomings at the back again the offside\n25:22 Comment: position which is also OK this time but after the previous history we have to check everything\n25:29 Comment: So they are a bit more precise in their actions especially when it comes to the balls\n25:36 Comment: 123 times in a row to defend now they have all speculated on offside\n25:46 Comment: wasted another really good opportunity and scored the 1-0 after eleven minutes\n25:52 Comment: no offside baumgartel picks it up and clearly robben can this ball this

Lewandowski.\n29:41 Comment: And right at the back, Vidal collides with the post.\n29:50 Comment: Already.\n29:51 Comment: Breathtaking.\n29:53 Comment: We hope, of course, that Vidal did not suffer any serious injuries.\n29:55 Comment: How Lewandowski is rising.\n29:59 Comment: Despite being closely guarded by Luschek, he prevails in the header duel.\n30:5 Comment: Remarkable jumping power, incredible timing.\n30:9 Comment: I even believe that Luschek was the last to touch the ball with the back of his head.\n30:13 Comment: In that respect, we should have talked about a possible corner.\n30:16 Comment: But now we have to worry about Arturo Vidal.\n30:21 Comment: The signing from Juventus Turin.\n30:25 Comment: Alexander Zorniger with Daniel Didavi.\n30:28 Comment: Bayern Fernsehen agrees.\n30:30 Comment: Our team is still leading 4-0.\n30:32 Comment: It has been a complicated season for VfB so far.\n30:36 Comment: Sure, new coaching team, new path, new concept.\n30:43

    "summary": "Bayern Munich delivered a scintillating performance as they triumphed 4-0 over VfB Stuttgart at the Allianz Arena. The match was a showcase of offensive prowess and tactical dominance from the German record champions, while Stuttgart struggled to cope with the relentless pressure exerted by Pep Guardiola's side.\n\n**First Half:**\n\nThe clash kicked off with Bayern Munich donning their iconic white jerseys, attacking from right to left. Stuttgart, known for their recent good form, entered the match with a compact defensive setup. Early on, Gentner made a strong defensive impression, signaling Stuttgart's intent to be resolute at the back.\n\nWithin the first few minutes, Bayern's setup began to reveal itself. Kimmich, positioned in the midfield, played a pivotal role in orchestrating play. With Costa and Müller occupying the advanced central positions, Robben on the right, and Lewandowski leading the attack, Bayern's formation fluctuated between a 4-2-3-1 and a 4-3-3. This fluid formation allowed Bayern to dominate possession and swiftly transition from defense to attack.\n\nRobben and Costa immediately tested Stuttgart’s defense. An early free kick for Bayern demonstrated their offensive focus, as Lewandowski poised himself to be a threat in the box. Bayern's first goal came in the 11th minute through an incredibly quick counter-attack. A seal, then Costa found himself in space after some miscommunication in the Stuttgart defense and slotted the ball home effortlessly. This placed Bayern ahead 1-0 and emphasized the risk Stuttgart took with their high defensive line.\n\nStuttgart attempted to push forward, earning a corner around the ninth minute, but Bayern’s defense remained sturdy, effectively neutralizing any threats. Stuttgart's counterattacks lacked the sharpness needed, and Bayern capitalized on this with their high pressing game. By the 17th minute, Bayern struck again. Following a rapid build-up, Robben received a pass from Müller, and his effort resulted in a slight deflection leading to a goal. Costa's influence was undeniable, as he was instrumental in this buildup, showcasing his dribbling and vision.\n\nBayern’s dominance was apparent in the possession statistics, holding over 70% of the ball by the 26th minute. Kimmich, playing in the Xabi Alonso role, frequently found himself in possession, recycling play and switching flanks effortlessly. Stuttgart's attempts to press high up the pitch often left them vulnerable to Bayern’s swift counters.\n\nThe highlight for Stuttgart came around the 33rd minute when an error by Alaba allowed Kostic to take a shot, which struck the bar. This was Stuttgart’s most notable chance, but it was quickly followed by a cringe-worthy sequence for the visitors. Shortly after, Bayern punished Stuttgart with their third goal. Müller combined intricately with Robben, who played a smart ball to Lewandowski, and the Polish striker buried it to make it 3-0, marking his 14th goal of the season.\n\nJust before the half-time whistle, Bayern added a fourth goal, amplifying Stuttgart's woes. Titon's minor blunder allowed Vidal to head against the crossbar, and the rebound was pounced on by Müller, who registered his eleventh goal of the season. This left Stuttgart shell-shocked, trailing 4-0 at the break.\n\n**Second Half:**\n\nBayern continued from where they left off, retaining possession and dictating the pace of the game. Pep Guardiola made a tactical adjustment, introducing Benatia for Boateng, maintaining the three-man defensive line with Alaba and Rafinha. This adjustment allowed Bayern to keep their foot on Stuttgart’s throat, showcasing their depth and tactical flexibility.\n\nStuttgart, acknowledging the mounting deficit, attempted to be more aggressive. Lussek came in to bolster the midfield, reflecting Zorniger’s desperate measures to stabilize his team. However, Bayern's defense, marshaled by Kimmich and supported by the likes of Alaba and Rafinha, remained impenetrable.\n\nBayern's relentless attack continued as the second half progressed. Guardiola’s men switched gears slightly, focusing more on ball retention and calculated forward forays. Despite their commanding lead, they remained eager to punish any defensive lapses by their opponents. Robben, displaying his usual wizardry, continued to torment Stuttgart's backline but missed out on a couple of clear chances that would have further increased the scoreline.\n\nGuardiola's decision to substitute Costa and bring on Thiago illustrated Bayern’s depth. Thiago seamlessly slotted into the midfield, continuing the high tempo and precision passing. Rafinha, instrumental on the right flank, consistently supported Robben and created overlaps that further stretched Stuttgart’s defense.\n\nFor Stuttgart, Heise’s introduction for Sonnjic signaled an attempt to add fresh legs to their beleaguered defense. Despite their tactical adjustments, Bayern's fluidity remained a constant challenge. Werner, always a threat with his pace, found himself repeatedly isolated against Bayern’s defensive stalwarts. Badstuber’s appearance was met with applause, symbolizing his perseverance through injury struggles to make yet another comeback.\n\nIn rare forays forward, Didavi and Werner's interplay posed questions to Bayern's backline, but Neuer, always assertive, quelled any threats. Even as Stuttgart ventured forward in search of a consolation, Bayern’s defenders, led by Badstuber's experience and Benatia’s aggressiveness, held firm.\n\nRobben continued to demonstrate his class, creating several opportunities. Despite the dwindling intensity, Bayern occasionally switched into high gear, generating chances that kept Stuttgart’s defense on high alert. Vidal, shifting roles from midfield aggressor to a more conservative distributor, epitomized Bayern’s control over the game.\n\nAs the match drew towards its conclusion, Bayern's tactical discipline ensured they retained their clean sheet. Stuttgart’s attempts grew more sporadic and desperate, often disrupted by Bayern’s midfield trio of Kimmich, Vidal, and Thiago efficiently recycling possession and defusing counterattacks.\n\nIn the dying moments, a minor injury scare for Vidal was a brief concern, but the Chilean warrior’s resilience saw him through the final whistle. The end of the match encapsulated Bayern Munich’s superiority. Their fans chanted in jubilation, synonymous with the team’s historic dominance.\n\nWith this victory, Bayern Munich reiterated their position at the summit of the Bundesliga, showcasing a blend of tactical astuteness and individual brilliance. Their impeccable form under Guardiola, combined with an insatiable hunger for success, left Stuttgart in their wake. As for VfB Stuttgart, this match was a stark reminder of the chasm they need to bridge to compete consistently at the highest level. The Bavarians, relentless and precise, cemented their dominance in what was a masterclass of footballing excellence."
