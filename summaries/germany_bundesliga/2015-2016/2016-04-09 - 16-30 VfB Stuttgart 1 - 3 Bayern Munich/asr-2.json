somehow artistic.\n13:3 Comment: Nor did he expect\n13:5 Comment: that he can still get the ball.\n13:9 Comment: Although he actually goes through\n13:11 Comment: and that can also be the case.\n13:13

Comment: Still an aggressive VfB Stuttgart.\n18:37 Comment: A good ball.\n18:45 Comment: What he has at the moment compared to many other teams\n18:48 Comment: What helps is that this top quality is missing on the wing so far.\n18:54 Comment: Ribery was injured for a long time at Bayern in the first half of the season.\n18:57 Comment: Then, at the end of the first half of the season, Costa was hit.\n19:1 Comment: Robben is out.\n19:3 Comment: Thoma with muscular problems in many games.\n19:7 Comment: The team is on one side.\n19:9 Comment: The team is on the other side.\n19:11 Comment: This

Comment: But here too, Ribery is a good option,\n19:43 Comment: to attract the team.\n19:45 Comment: And then Bernat's game.\n19:47 Comment: Bernat cleared the way for him.\n19:49 Comment: Still Ribery.\n19:51 Comment: Alaba is there too.\n19:53 Comment: And then blocked by Bernat.\n20:7 Comment: That's a good ball.\n20:14 Comment: We'll get that to the edge of the picture.\n20:17 Comment: Although Klein also contributes his part.\n20:21 Comment: If that goes through, it's wide open.\n20:25 Comment: The situation wasn't that clear to me.\n20:37 Comment: That was a good ball.\n21:22 Comment: In the early stages, Ben Naxt was even more playful than all\n21:25 Comment: others.\n21:26 Comment: They were all really good there.\n21:33 Comment: Vidal loses the.\n21:34 Comment: He makes adjustments.\n21:35 Comment: Also his second one.\n21:37 Comment: That was a good ball.\n21:40 Comment: Poor ball control gets you into trouble.\n21:49 Comment: He is then too late.\n22:7 Comment:

the train around the way.\n22:13 Comment: He is the tough\n22:37 Comment: come through again because they have that from every opponent in the league anyway\n22:42 Comment: it doesn't work but how do you get the ball in front that worked quite well at the beginning\n22:45 Comment: Stuttgart has now found itself stubbornly and robustly disturbing and these unfinished in between\n23:7 Comment: the\n23:37 Comment: This is a case.\n23:39 Comment: And not more.\n23:43 Comment: Yes, Alonso, say again, you know, you just saw money.\n23:49 Comment: And just move your arm away.\n23:50 Comment: Especially in a situation like this, neutral zone too.\n23:53 Comment: This is of course also a quality that Arturo Vidal has with his aggressiveness,\n23:59 Comment: who always goes full throttle.\n24:2 Comment: Kimmich gets the free kick.\n24:7 Comment: And then there is also a lot of time to think about other things in life.\n24:25 Comment: And now, it is 3 p.m. and just 55 minutes, Thomas Müller is here.\n24:33 Comment: Guardiola reacts in the 25th minute.\n24:37 Comment: And then even Hermann Gerlind starts to sweat.\n24:44 Comment: He hardly ever upsets him.\n24:45 Comment: But that he has to fill out a form so early without any injury-related background.\n24:53 Comment: And all this with a short warm-up program on the bench.\n25:7 Comment: And it causes the output again.\n25:8 Comment: And then even Hermann Gerlind starts to sweat.\n25:8 Comment: And it causes the output again.\n25:8 Comment: And then even Hermann Gerlind starts to sweat.\n25:18 Comment: And who does that.\n25:20 Comment: So far there has been hardly any way through.\n25:23 Comment: He with his surprising actions.\n25:28 Comment: And Kosta is conceivable, like Vidal.\n25:30 Comment: Well, he was close to being sent off.\n25:34 Comment: Get out early.\n25:37 Comment: The one who whistles yawning knows that.\n25:39 Comment: So he started in the cup game in Möttingen.\n25:41 Comment: Fifth division is away.\n25:43 Comment: In the fifth minute everything was gone.\n25:45 Comment: The Bekater, penalty rider, messed up.\n25:47 Comment: For heaven's sake, what is going on?\n25:49 Comment: Then he was told that he had to slow down.\n25:50 Comment: That was perhaps too strong.\n25:52 Comment: There was real criticism.\n25:53 Comment: But in the knockout games, especially against Juventus Turin, those were his.\n25:57 Comment: He was so good there.\n25:59 Comment: And today it was one too many good things.\n26:1 Comment: Or too much of the bad.\n26:2 Comment: Depending on what you want.\n26:7 Comment: And I think that this cannot be done entirely without conversation.\n26:11 Comment: Just like Vidal is trying to do right now.\n26:12 Comment: Who sneaks around the back of the bank.\n26:16 Comment: To avoid having much contact with the trainer.\n26:19 Comment: And Philipp Lahm is comforting us at the moment.\n26:33 Comment: Guardiola intervenes immediately.\n26:37 Comment: Open, close, three, four, three.\n26:59 Comment: That's a puddle.\n27:1 Comment: I've never even had a place on the bench for him.\n27:3 Comment: This is just frustrating.\n28:37 Comment: Twice.\n28:37 Comment: Müller again.\n28:38 Comment: Götze is here.\n28:40 Comment: Strongly under pressure from Thomas Müller.\n28:42 Comment: And that has happened a few times.\n28:44 Comment: When he came in, it was a different move, a different approach to Bayern's game.\n28:48 Comment: It's still a bit early because he hasn't been here that long.\n28:53 Comment: But he was involved in the first deal in quite some time.\n29:7 Comment: And now he feels like he didn't do a very good job.\n29:23 Comment: And Ribery is now on the wing too.\n29:26 Comment: Bernat is in the center.\n29:28 Comment: That's a lot more speed.\n29:32 Comment: At least in theory.\n29:34 Comment: Get over the wing.\n29:37 Comment: And then he feels like he didn't do it very well.\n29:56 Comment: I want to give myself peace of mind.\n30:2 Comment: And then something out of its time and place and its technical qualities\n30:6 Comment: remained.\n30:7 Comment: Which he still has to do.\n30:8 Comment: Something like Bernat, for example.\n30:10 Comment: And Ribery.\n30:10 Comment: Well, let's see.\n30:13 Comment: Still Ribery.\n30:16 Comment: Ribery does that.\n30:18 Comment: And own goal.\n30:21 Comment: Stuttgart helps in the person of a Munich resident.\n30:24 Comment: Georg Niedermeyer puts Bayern in the lead with his own goal.\n30:29 Comment: Ribery.\n30:37 Comment: That is bitter.\n30:37 Comment: It was already the 6th own goal of the season.\n30:41 Comment: That’s a Bundesliga record.\n30:44 Comment: Of course it has to go there.\n30:45 Comment: And then very unhappy.\n30:46 Comment: I think he even tunneled past his own keeper.\n30:48 Comment: But you can see when he moves over the wings, there he is.\n30:51 Comment: And this is Ribery.\n30:52 Comment: Although this is of course under the motto “let’s be lucky”.\n30:57 Comment: Very bitter.\n30:58 Comment: And Tüton too, he might even have missed,\n31:0 Comment: if the thigh is not involved.\n31:1 Comment: And Stuttgart helps Bayern take the lead.\n31:31 Comment: Werner.\n31:46 Comment: Half an hour of play.\n31:49 Comment: Bayern are in the lead.\n31:50 Comment: At some point, the tackling behavior of Arturo Vidal,\n31:54 Comment: Pep Guardiola, of course, I have to react early here.\n31:57 Comment: This is probably how you play the thing out to the end.\n31:59 Comment: And then there is always the threat,\n32:1 Comment: like danger if Stuttgart gets another free kick or a corner.\n32:6 Comment: Now they have their 1-0.\n32:9 Comment: And I'm curious to see what they do with it.\n32:12 Comment: Thierry Sammer had already said that beforehand.\n32:14 Comment: Yes, here and there I had the impression that they wanted to manage it.\n32:16 Comment: They could afford it.\n32:20 Comment: Even if in all games Cologne, Frankfurt, Benfica\n32:26 Comment: If they had been 2-0 up they would have had much, much more peace of mind afterwards.\n32:28 Comment: Kimmich.\n32:31 Comment: 보는 and but hope\n32:38 Comment: ws\n32:43 Comment: A\n32:45 Comment: S\n32:47 Comment: billiards\n32:48 Comment: A\n32:49 Comment: J\n32:50 Comment: panda\n32:54 Comment: A\n32:58 Comment: Minaru\n33:0 Comment: Millers.\n33:1 Comment: Oh.\n33:1 Comment: Bruce Willer.\n33:1 Comment: and then comes the last goalkeeper,\n33:3 Comment: who frees himself for the league.\n33:9 Comment: The insult,\n33:11 Comment: that the two misunderstood each other.\n33:15 Comment: When it is updated,\n33:17 Comment: then this own goal,\n33:19 Comment: because it is a record own goal by a club in a season,\n33:22 Comment: also make it into the Bundesliga collection.\n33:25 Comment: The best of 50 years of Bundesliga.\n33:28 Comment: You can now see\n33:30 Comment: but you can also wait until after the top game.\n33:33 Comment: The whole thing on Sky on Demand.\n33:35 Comment: And the information and access on the Internet.\n33:55 Comment: There too, foot sweeper behind,\n33:57 Comment: Advantage, well said.\n33:58 Comment: That was a good ball.\n34:0 Comment: That was well seen.\n34:1 Comment: By Dankertz.\n34:5 Comment: He actually had to follow up with a few stern words.\n34:8 Comment: He solves this with a stern look.\n34:25 Comment: Oh yes, that one is good.\n34:26 Comment: Lewandowski, Tüthon is waiting.\n34:27 Comment: Lewandowski.\n34:28 Comment: Polish national team and suddenly\n34:49 Comment: something is happening there.\n34:55 Comment: Open,\n34:56 Comment: The Stuttgarters can no longer get out.\n35:6 Comment: Since Bayern have been fighting properly,\n35:9 Comment: the matter is even more difficult.\n35:13 Comment: Bernhard, still small.\n35:17 Comment: The pressure is increasing.\n35:20 Comment: The relief is no longer there from VfB.\n35:24 Comment: The Stuttgarters can no longer get out.\n35:32 Comment: Thomas Müller has come much deeper into the game.\n35:40 Comment: Bayern leave the 5 and the space up to the penalty spot\n35:44 Comment: completely free.\n35:48 Comment: The Bavarians are just coming in now.\n35:52 Comment: In short, Kimmich is here.\n35:58 Comment: The ball is in the middle.\n36:6 Comment: Kimmich, well done by Ribéry.\n36:10 Comment: Götze loses him.\n36:14 Comment: Werner, against everyone.\n36:18 Comment: There is a free kick.\n36:30 Comment: With a swallow.\n36:34 Comment: Alonso is yellow-endangered.\n36:38 Comment: Yellow block endangered.\n36:42 Comment: He also sees yellow.\n36:46 Comment: He was guilty of handball against Schalke.\n36:54 Comment: He didn't win it.\n37:6 Comment: His action is clearly directed at Werner.\n37:10 Comment: You can see that he doesn't even catch him.\n37:22 Comment: If he hits it, it's clearly yellow.\n37:30 Comment: Alonso.\n37:34 Comment: He can't control himself anymore.\n37:42 Comment: This is the third corner of this game.\n37:46 Comment: He will still win another corner.\n37:52 Comment: The Davy.\n38:2 Comment: One corner.\n38:9 Comment: One is lying on the floor.\n38:14

    "summary": "In a highly anticipated Bundesliga fixture, VfB Stuttgart faced off against Bayern Munich at the Mercedes-Benz Arena, renowned for its electrifying atmosphere. VfB Stuttgart, donning their classic white kits, set up in a 3-man defensive setup, which saw Werner Gintzek making a return to the lineup as part of the defense, even with an injury cloud hanging over Daniel Gintzek. Bayern Munich, one of Germany's football powerhouses, came with their arsenal of talent, positioned to gain another three points and extend their hold at the top of the table.\n\nAs the first half commenced, Bayern set the tone early with their classical dynamic and fluid style of play. In the opening moments, Bayern's Joshua Kimmich shared a delightful reunion with his former youth teammate Timo Werner, who was part of Stuttgart’s attacking forces, showcasing football's brotherhood that transcends competition. The ensembles from both sides displayed high levels of technical ability from the start, marked by precision play and tactical awareness.\n\nBayern seemed determined to impose their will on the game, moving their key players forward in anticipation of breaking the deadlock early. Notable drives were orchestrated by Mario Götze, exhibiting finesse in his midfield role, coupled with the ever-dazzling Franck Ribéry who faced considerable challenges early on but still crafted incisive plays. Mario Götze, from his slightly deeper role, seemed pivotal, shifting the ball elegantly and carving openings with composure and precision that continually tested Stuttgart’s resolve.\n\nThe match saw a surge in intensity as Bayern’s usual suspects Ribéry and Götze combined to fashion several promising opportunities, only to be thwarted by diligent defensive blocks and interceptions from Stuttgart's backline, particularly Toni Sunic, who executed crucial interventions to keep Bayern at bay. Stuttgart, while primarily on the defensive, showed intermittent bursts of counter-attacking threat, primarily led by Filip Kostic, who was tasked with drawing the Bavarian defense wide and creating spaces for his teammates.\n\nA significant talking point of the match occurred around the 12th-minute mark when Mario Götze found the back of the net. The goal underscored Götze’s technical prowess and knack for exploiting defensive lapses. His effort came following a series of well-coordinated plays that had Stuttgart momentarily in disarray. Ribéry, involved in the build-up, showcased his characteristic dribbling skills to gain an edge over the Stuttgart defense.\n\nThe midfield battleground saw significant tussles, with Bayern’s Xabi Alonso, known for his strategic depth and passing range, dictating terms for his side. Although Bayern held a considerable amount of possession, Stuttgart’s determination to disrupt their rhythm was evident. The physicality in challenges and tactical resilience displayed by Stuttgart's midfielders and defenders made Bayern's customary free-flowing game difficult to execute flawlessly.\n\nDespite Bayern’s dominance, the defensive rigor of Stuttgart— augmented by a few moments of brilliance from their goalkeeper, who showcased decisive saves and command over his area—kept the scoreline from further escalating. One such moment saw a brilliant, albeit fortuitous intervention from Stuttgart's captain, where he cleared a dangerous situation, preventing another potential goal that Bayern seemed destined to score.\n\nNevertheless, as the hands of the clock approached the 30-minute mark, Bayern maintained their aggressive impetus. The relentless probing by Bayern's attacking unit bore fruit once again in the 30th minute when a well-engineered move saw Georg Niedermeier inadvertently deflect the ball into his own net, trying to obstruct a surging Ribéry whose cross aimed at the center caused confusion. This marked Bayern's second goal of the half, extending their lead and underscoring their dominance. The unfortunate own goal represented the bitter pill Stuttgart had to swallow, epitomizing the challenges of defending against Bayern’s relentless pressure.\n\nDespite the setback, Stuttgart exhibited moments of resilience and intent to bounce back. Their occasional forays into Bayern's defensive third, predominantly through Werner and Kostic, showcased their offensive potential. Werner’s attempts to breach Bayern's defense, often involving slick interplay and speed down the flanks were noted, although consistently met with stern resistance from Bayern’s fortified defensive setup, featuring the likes of David Alaba and Martínez.\n\nAs halftime approached, Stuttgart was handed a lifeline. A set-piece opportunity, capitalized brilliantly by Daniel Didavi, saw him slot one past the Bayern defense to make it 2-1 in the 51st minute. The goal reignited hopes for the home side, providing much-needed morale and a platform to potentially claw their way back into the contest. Didavi’s clinical finish was emblematic of Stuttgart’s fighting spirit and underscored the importance of set-pieces as a levee in games dominated by such pragmatic units as Bayern Munich.\n\nThe half concluded with Bayern in the lead, but Stuttgart clearly displayed sparks of revival. Jürgen Kramny's men headed into the locker room with a blueprint for crafting a comeback, particularly focusing on exploiting the spaces left by Bayern’s advancing full-backs and utilizing their own aerial threats in set-piece situations.\n\nThe second half kicked off with an unaltered formation from Bayern but saw changes in positional play. Bayern's Franck Ribéry and Juan Bernat swapped spots, a move intended to leverage Ribéry’s creativity in wider positions and Bernat's diligent defensive contributions in midfield. Götze, positioned deeper, worked in tandem with Müller, seeking to destabilize Stuttgart’s defensive rhythm.\n\nThe match progressively intensified, with Stuttgart showing enhanced aggression and tactical discipline. They defended in numbers, often with five men in a line to suffocate Bayern’s penetrative plays. This defensive organization required Bayern to recalibrate their attacks, now needing to break through a reinforced Stuttgart blockade.\n\nA contentious moment unfolded when Bayern's David Alaba was booked, further ratcheting up the tension of the encounter. Stuttgart seized on the implications of such decisions to mount more cohesive and daring attacks, spearheaded by their talisman Timo Werner who consistently tried to exploit gaps in Bayern's armor.\n\nBayern, however, consolidated their midfield dynamism with accurate passes and meticulously planned movements. They relentlessly pursued the next goal, leveraging the skills of Lewandowski who posed a constant aerial and ground threat. By the 66th minute, Bayern spurred by their intricate midfield play managed to extend their advantage, a move orchestrated by Götze yet again, who unleashed a powerful strike, reasserting Bayern’s commanding presence on the pitch.\n\nVfB Stuttgart’s counter-attacks, although sporadic, continued to threaten Bayern's solid backline. The 81st minute saw another dimensional shift when Ribéry’s incisive play resulted in Bayern garnering a 4-1 lead, effectively sealing the game. This goal proved pivotal, demoralizing Stuttgart's efforts and reaffirming Bayern’s superior campaign strategy.\n\nRibéry, alongside his midfield counterparts, orchestrated a masterclass, maintaining fluidity between Bayern's midfield and attack. His closing minutes of involvement were marked by creative ball distribution, flair, and assisting plays that accentuated Bayern’s comprehensive approach to the game. \n\nStuttgart's continuous attempts to breach Bayern's defense, particularly through flanking runs and long balls targeting their physical forwards, were competently dealt with by Bayern’s defenders and Manuel Neuer’s exemplary goalkeeping acumen.\n\nThe final whistle brought Bayern a well-deserved 4-1 victory, a testament to their tactical prowess, individual brilliance, and relentless strategic execution. It highlighted their determination to maintain supremacy in the Bundesliga, encapsulating a performance balanced with defensive rigor, midfield mastery, and offensive sharpness. \n\nFor Stuttgart, despite the defeat, their display of resilience, intermittent brilliance in attack, and disciplined defensive structure, offered glimpses of potential that could be harnessed and refined in upcoming fixtures."
