    "input": "\n    Bayern Munich 3 - 0 Bayer\n\nFirst Half:\n\n0:0 Comment: in midweek. So Stefan Kiesling will look to unsettle that makeshift Bayern back\n0:5 Comment: four. One perfect record is going tonight. You don't bet too often against Bayern at\n0:10 Comment: home but I just wonder how much Leverkusen can ride the crest of their\n0:14 Comment: midweek Champions League wave. Owen Hargreaves. Well this Bayern Leverkusen\n0:19 Comment: team is one of the best teams in the Bundesliga. Roger Schmidt, one of the best\n0:23 Comment: young managers in the Bundesliga. So I think they're going to be prepared. Such\n0:28 Comment: a terrific performance midweek against Lazio. They press very high Leverkusen.\n0:32 Comment: They work incredibly hard defensively. Have great pacing wide areas. Bellarabi\n0:37 Comment: one of the quickest players you'll see in that number 10, Caglanoglu there. What a\n0:41 Comment: player he is. So far the player of the season in the Bundesliga. So hopefully\n0:45 Comment: we'll have an opportunity to wax lyrical about his many talents if he gets an\n0:50 Comment: opportunity to produce them on Bundesliga's biggest stage. It will be\n0:55 Comment: interesting to see how Bayern cope with the situation.\n0:58 Comment: So we'll see.\n0:58 Comment: Without the suspended Boateng and injured\n1:2 Comment: Benatia, Xabi Martinez and Holger Batstuber still some way away from\n1:7 Comment: returning from injury. And what we saw at Hoffenheim a week ago I'm sure Manuel\n1:12 Comment: Neuer would not like what was going on in front of him there. Well that's the\n1:17 Comment: Bayern way. The Guardiola way they'd say. You know they always like to play out of\n1:20 Comment: these areas but Douglas Costa with his speed. Boy did they play out effectively in what looked like an anxious moment at the back.\n1:28 Comment: Has turned into a corner kick for Bayern. Well money very well spent. I think teams\n1:32 Comment: should always buy something that they don't have. Bayern Munich did that getting\n1:35 Comment: Douglas Costa. Bit of pace, not a great goal scoring record but so far since he's\n1:39 Comment: been at Bayern Munich only a few games in he scored goals, got assists. Like I said\n1:44 Comment: he's gonna be a superstar.\n1:47 Comment: The Bundesliga started the campaign for Thiago. It is he who will have to wait to take the corner kick.\n1:58 Comment: Neuer is now ready and that's an easy one for another player who's started the\n2:3 Comment: season well. Bernd Lehner in the Leverkusen goal. Well Germany just seemed\n2:8 Comment: to produce goalkeeper after goalkeeper. Bernd Lehner only 23 years old but\n2:12 Comment: another top keeper. Such a talented young team. Leverkusen had the youngest\n2:17 Comment: starting 11 on the first game of the season so this team is gonna be here for\n2:21 Comment: a very long time. Very exciting. Like I said Roger Schmidt a terrific manager.\n2:26 Comment: They have a great style, great philosophy.\n2:28 Comment: And they're going places.\n2:30 Comment: Put the contest into some kind of context for you. Over the last decade in Bundesliga\n2:36 Comment: these two sides have won more games than any other. Yes Dortmund have been there\n2:42 Comment: or thereabouts and Schalke have had their moments as well but Bayern against\n2:46 Comment: Leverkusen over the last 10 years has perhaps been the Manchester United\n2:51 Comment: against Arsenal of 10 years ago.\n2:53 Comment: Well it's incredible you think about some of the players that\n2:55 Comment: Leverkusen have had in the in the past.\n2:57 Comment: Lucio and Vidal, Balet, Roberto. I mean they sold all these top players\n3:4 Comment: Berbatov and they've still been able to compete. Their scouting network is second\n3:7 Comment: to none and to have such a young talented team and still be able to\n3:12 Comment: compete is exceptional. One touch too many from Hilbert. Here comes Douglas\n3:18 Comment: Costa with Müller in support to his left. Lewandowski looking to take on Wendel.\n3:27 Comment: Kramer having got a touch they could resist the temptation to hang out a leg for Arjen Robben\n3:32 Comment: who obliges by stumbling over it.\n3:37 Comment: Well that central midfield pairing of Kramer and Bender is so strong.\n3:43 Comment: Technically not the greatest two players but they're gonna block everything for\n3:47 Comment: this Leverkusen back four. You're gonna need Kramer to be aggressive like he was\n3:50 Comment: against Arjen Robben there but those two are gonna provide the base and the\n3:54 Comment: foundation for those forward players to create a good performance.\n3:55 Comment: And that's what we're looking for.\n3:57 Comment: Monceau standing over the free kick.\n4:3 Comment: Embarrassment of quality from Toema.\n4:11 Comment: Might even be thinking about taking on the shot eye in Robben.\n4:15 Comment: And he hangs it in there and Hilbert could have let it go. Got a shout but wasn't\n4:21 Comment: short. That'll be another fine corner.\n4:27 Comment: Kramer is in the back of the net.\n4:35 Comment: Short for Costa this time for Thiago.\n4:41 Comment: New Netherlands international captain Arjen Robben.\n4:45 Comment: On that responsibility this week.\n4:58 Comment: It's Alaba and Alonso at the heart of that Bayern defence. So it is very much\n5:3 Comment: unfamiliar looking defensive line for the home side.\n5:6 Comment: Well you'd have to say if I'm going to get away with that back three...\n5:9 Comment: Well Wendell's not gonna get away with that challenge on Robben.\n5:15 Comment: And it's very early in the game if you're a fullback away from home at the Allianz Arena\n5:20 Comment: to be on the yellow card.\n5:22 Comment: I love Wendell as a player. Such an exciting young left back. Only 22.2, but he's got an incredible career.\n5:25 Comment: only 22 years old but this guy's gonna have a bright future Brazilian fallback\n5:30 Comment: quick as anything in the Cup game last season against Bayern Munich he was the\n5:34 Comment: best player on the pitch him and Bernat and as you said getting a yellow card\n5:38 Comment: six minutes in against arguably the best player in the Bundesliga might be a long\n5:43 Comment: day played every minute so far if he can get through the next stage before he'll\n5:49 Comment: be doing well Robben will be targeting him\n5:55 Comment: the pitch looks very bubbly so when Robben normally even that ball just\n6:23 Comment: before on Alonso took a took a strange\n6:25 Comment: ball and now he's got another ball coming up to him and then the ball is\n6:25 Comment: coming up to him and then the ball is coming up to him and then the ball is\n6:25 Comment: The pitch is strangely in poor condition.\n6:28 Comment: Normally early on in the season,\n6:30 Comment: the Allianz Arena grass is in perfect shape,\n6:32 Comment: but it's taken a few bubbles so far.\n6:35 Comment: Yeah, one or two of the Bayern players mentioned it\n6:37 Comment: after the 5-0 win against Hamburg here a couple of weeks ago,\n6:40 Comment: saying that that was one of the features\n6:42 Comment: of the quality of their performance,\n6:44 Comment: that they overcame the quality of the pitch to win so emphatically.\n6:47 Comment: All the fans are probably thinking,\n6:56 Comment: what are you moaning about? It looks perfect.\n6:57 Comment: But when you get up close,\n6:59 Comment: it's a completely different surface.\n7:2 Comment: Remember we played on one in Moscow\n7:4 Comment: for a Champions League game and there was no grass on it,\n7:7 Comment: and they spray-painted it green and put wood chips on it,\n7:9 Comment: so from the telly, it looked perfect.\n7:12 Comment: But actually when you played on it,\n7:13 Comment: it was pretty ridiculous.\n7:16 Comment: That was quite a memorable one.\n7:17 Comment: It's the kind of tactic that teams might use against Bayern,\n7:21 Comment: but they're happy to deal with the handicap on home territory\n7:24 Comment: and they're conceding possession to Grim Bellarabi,\n7:28 Comment: who looked like he'd surged away from Bernat.\n7:32 Comment: Down he eventually goes and he does get the decision.\n7:36 Comment: And another full-back who's got a long time to play on the yellow card.\n7:43 Comment: Well, that's Bernat's first foul.\n7:45 Comment: Bellarabi.\n7:46 Comment: Probably the quickest goal of the game.\n7:47 Comment: The quickest player with Aubameyang in the Bundesliga.\n7:50 Comment: And he goes down far too easy, really.\n7:53 Comment: Bellarabi could have just kept running.\n7:55 Comment: Obviously when you've got a set-piece taker like Chalhanoglu,\n7:59 Comment: Roger Schmidt probably advises the players to go down every time,\n8:2 Comment: get a free kick.\n8:6 Comment: Bellarabi gave himself a chance to think about\n8:8 Comment: what the manager's last words to him were\n8:10 Comment: on his way out of the dressing room.\n8:13 Comment: Eventually down he went.\n8:17 Comment: And then he's got a free kick.\n8:18 Comment: Wendell is there as well, but...\n8:21 Comment: This is the first opportunity for Hakan Chalhanoglu to\n8:25 Comment: wave that wand of a right foot.\n8:31 Comment: That's an inviting delivery.\n8:33 Comment: Alaba sends it clear.\n8:37 Comment: Back in from Hilbert.\n8:41 Comment: But over the head of Jonathan Tarr and Manuel Neuer will have a goal kick.\n8:47 Comment: Unpredictable.\n8:51 Comment: leading scouting\n8:52 Comment: Golovere\n8:55 Comment: Arenu\n8:57 Comment: Smivaca\n8:58 Comment: Alaba\n9:0 Comment: 9 hits\n9:1 Comment: 1 part\n9:1 Comment: 3 minutes\n9:2 Comment: 0 minutes\n9:3 Comment: 26 points\n9:4 Comment: 27 minutes\n9:5 Comment: 1 part\n9:5 Comment: 2n avt\n9:6 Comment: m\n9:7 Comment: g\n9:7 Comment: 4\n9:9 Comment: \n9:15 Comment: 3\n9:16 Comment: 1\n9:16 Comment: 5\n9:17 Comment: 14\n9:17 Comment: Memorable years in terms of silverware earned in Turin.\n9:25 Comment: Finally, Guardiola has tempted him to the Allianz Arena.\n9:29 Comment: Bayern did try to sign Vidal when he left Leverkusen four years ago,\n9:33 Comment: but he opted to try his luck in Italy.\n9:44 Comment: Bayern make the game look so easy, they only take one or two touches,\n9:47 Comment: they always play the way they're facing.\n9:49 Comment: Always great angles and options.\n9:53 Comment: And the slip from Papadopoulos\n9:56 Comment: allows Robben to plot a route towards goal.\n10:9 Comment: Testoleno, though.\n10:13 Comment: He must have been in ever-presence in the Leverkusen goal,\n10:16 Comment: going all the way back.\n10:17 Comment: Back to November 2012, and as Owen was saying in the build-up,\n10:23 Comment: it is remarkable,\n10:25 Comment: Bayern has just 23, how many top-quality young goalkeepers there are\n10:29 Comment: applying their trade in Bundesliga.\n10:34 Comment: Two Premier League clubs up some shore,\n10:36 Comment: looking with envy at the riches available in terms of number ones\n10:41 Comment: playing in German football.\n10:42 Comment: Vidal couldn't spread it wide for Costa, Hilbert is going to have his...\n10:47 Comment: Hands full, keeping the Brazilian quiet.\n10:51 Comment: PENALTY FOR VALLE\n10:53 Comment: FANS CHEER\n11:7 Comment: Robin, up against Vendor, support arriving, Thiago!\n11:11 Comment: First shot on goal of the evening.\n11:12 Comment: FANS CHEER\n11:17 Comment: That's such great awareness from Thomas Müller.\n11:20 Comment: Watch how quick he takes this free kick.\n11:22 Comment: Vendor gets caught out of position.\n11:24 Comment: Ari and Robin in this position.\n11:26 Comment: One-on-one against Vendor.\n11:27 Comment: FANS CHEER\n11:29 Comment: See, they just come closer down with Vendor.\n11:30 Comment: That's a great lay-off for Thiago at the edge of the box.\n11:34 Comment: Difficult skill sometimes to keep that down.\n11:36 Comment: Needs to lean over it a tiny bit but first warning to Bayern.\n11:41 Comment: RESTRICTED TWO SUBSTITUTE APPEARANCES SO FAR.\n11:44 Comment: Thiago Alcantara.\n11:45 Comment: Alcantara this season.\n11:50 Comment: Bellarabi\n11:50 Comment: against Bernat.\n11:53 Comment: Getting the better of Bernat.\n11:55 Comment: And he did Alonso to clear away the danger.\n11:59 Comment: Bellarabi's going to be a super player.\n12:2 Comment: Already last season, 13 goals,\n12:5 Comment: 14 assists for a wide man.\n12:7 Comment: Those are great stats.\n12:9 Comment: Only a few seasons ago,\n12:10 Comment: he was playing in the lower leagues,\n12:12 Comment: but he's such a great athlete.\n12:13 Comment: I'm surprised some Premier League teams weren't in for him.\n12:17 Comment: Son obviously gone to Tottenham.\n12:18 Comment: I think Bellarabi's probably the better player of the two.\n12:22 Comment: Good enough to get into the Germany squad again\n12:25 Comment: for their Euro qualifiers against Poland and Scotland\n12:29 Comment: coming up over the next 10 days or so.\n12:35 Comment: First corner kick of the evening, though,\n12:38 Comment: by Bayer Leverkusen.\n12:40 Comment: It's the dual threat of Bellarabi\n12:42 Comment: and Bernat.\n12:43 Comment: Chalamolu who wandered over towards him.\n12:54 Comment: Chalamolu it is who takes.\n12:57 Comment: Alonso again getting to it first.\n13:0 Comment: Chalamolu!\n13:13 Comment: What an impression he's made on Bayern\n13:15 Comment: and what a remarkable achievement it would be\n13:17 Comment: if he could produce that unprecedented\n13:19 Comment: fourth consecutive Bundesliga title.\n13:22 Comment: He'll have an eye, I'm sure,\n13:24 Comment: Pep Guardiola on the Champions League as well\n13:27 Comment: after last season's disappointment.\n13:28 Comment: Arsenal, Olympiacos and Dinamo Zagreb.\n13:31 Comment: in Bayern's group after this week's draw in Monaco.\n13:37 Comment: Leverkusen involved as well, and like Bayern,\n13:40 Comment: they will have ambitions to get through the group stage,\n13:43 Comment: but it's a tricky-looking group for them with Barcelona,\n13:46 Comment: Roma and Barté Borizov awaiting.\n13:49 Comment: Costa.\n13:52 Comment: Robben.\n13:55 Comment: Tarr with a crucial touch, but it needs clearing.\n14:1 Comment: Bellarabi opting to run it out.\n14:3 Comment: That is a measure of the confidence that Leverkusen come into the game with.\n14:13 Comment: One of the goalscorers in midweek as they beat Lazio 3-0.\n14:17 Comment: Kaleem Bellarabi.\n14:20 Comment: It's a game that we brought you here on BT Sport,\n14:23 Comment: and it was a stunning performance from Roger Schmitz's side\n14:27 Comment: to see off the Italians from 1-0 down in the first leg.\n14:30 Comment: 3-1.\n14:32 Comment: The aggregate victory for them, and they were well worth it, Owen.\n14:37 Comment: They were incredible.\n14:38 Comment: One of the best performances I've seen so far this season.\n14:41 Comment: Virtually perfect in every aspect.\n14:43 Comment: They pressed so hard and worked so hard.\n14:45 Comment: Look how high up the pitch they are in the Allianz Arena.\n14:48 Comment: Not many teams come here and press this high.\n14:51 Comment: Often teams drop off and defend very deep\n14:53 Comment: and hope that they can hang on,\n14:55 Comment: but this Leverkusen team have so many great options.\n14:58 Comment: It's a terrific pass from the back.\n15:0 Comment: Lender.\n15:2 Comment: Chalonolu helps it on towards Kiesling.\n15:7 Comment: Still Chalonolu.\n15:9 Comment: Real possibilities, and...\n15:13 Comment: Neuer has to stand and wait to make sure.\n15:19 Comment: Kramer, it is, putting immediate pressure on Vidal,\n15:22 Comment: and then likewise Lahm.\n15:28 Comment: It's Trent Foote.\n15:30 Comment: Müller ensures there was no lingering danger, but...\n15:36 Comment: Leverkusen very much playing.\n15:39 Comment: Corley manager Roger Schmidt,\n15:41 Comment: it is a feature of his style of management,\n15:45 Comment: this high-tempo, high-pressing game they play.\n15:50 Comment: I mean, the whole team's in the Bayern Munich half.\n15:52 Comment: You never see that at the Allianz Arena.\n15:55 Comment: They love to press, get bodies forward.\n15:56 Comment: Obviously got quick centre-backs in Saar and Papadopoulos,\n15:59 Comment: but can they win it back?\n16:0 Comment: Quickly see that even the centre-backs are on the front foot.\n16:8 Comment: Decision goes against the Greek defender,\n16:11 Comment: but the intentions of Leverkusen are clear.\n16:15 Comment: When the draw was made for the Champions League playoff round,\n16:18 Comment: and he saw they had Lazio over two legs,\n16:20 Comment: and then they were playing Bayern,\n16:22 Comment: it looked like a really tricky start to the season.\n16:24 Comment: But when you win that Champions League tie,\n16:27 Comment: all of a sudden it's the platform to go on and do something.\n16:30 Comment: Well, it's...\n16:30 Comment: I thought even in Rome when they lost 1-0,\n16:33 Comment: I thought they were the better side.\n16:34 Comment: They were so unlucky.\n16:35 Comment: Just a moment of brilliance from Keita Balder, really,\n16:38 Comment: decided the game, but they had so many chances in that first leg.\n16:41 Comment: They were deserved winners over two legs.\n16:44 Comment: Even the Lazio manager after Stefano Fioli said,\n16:47 Comment: the far better team won.\n16:49 Comment: That's terrific.\n16:50 Comment: I think they're going to be one of those little dark horses\n16:52 Comment: to cause an upset in the Champions League.\n16:54 Comment: They are that good.\n16:55 Comment: And I think they'll run Bayern close this season.\n16:57 Comment: I think Bayern, Dortmund and Leverkusen are the three best teams,\n17:0 Comment: in the Bundesliga this season.\n17:2 Comment: I think Wolfsburg and Gladbach are going to fall off a little bit.\n17:6 Comment: The three Owen mentions are the three that came into the weekend with perfect records.\n17:12 Comment: Lewandowski.\n17:15 Comment: The idea, if it had come off, was a wonderful one.\n17:21 Comment: Thomas Müller is always on the move, always looking for that ball in the behind.\n17:24 Comment: He's one of the smartest players you'll ever see.\n17:26 Comment: He always finds a way to have an impact on a game.\n17:30 Comment: He's a very good player.\n17:31 Comment: He's very good at thinking, I think.\n17:33 Comment: He just has a feel for where things are going to develop.\n17:35 Comment: Lewandowski, terrific goal scorer, but great vision as well to be able to play those passes.\n17:40 Comment: A lot of centre-forwards are just target men,\n17:42 Comment: but Lewandowski with his ability is probably the best goal-scorer,\n17:47 Comment: assist centre-forward I think there is in Europe.\n17:51 Comment: Gilbert did use his hands.\n17:53 Comment: The play has been waved on by Florian Meier.\n17:57 Comment: And then Costa.\n17:58 Comment: And that's ugly from Kramer.\n18:0 Comment: Costa was going away from goal and,\n18:2 Comment: deservedly, a yellow card is brandished in his direction.\n18:7 Comment: Well, he's an aggressive player, Kramer, but he made his mind up too early.\n18:10 Comment: He went to ground.\n18:12 Comment: He should never go to ground.\n18:13 Comment: I think it's a sign of weakness.\n18:16 Comment: But he already made his mind up.\n18:17 Comment: He went down.\n18:17 Comment: I think he realised if Douglas Costa gets away,\n18:20 Comment: he's going to run at that back four.\n18:22 Comment: And that's his job to protect, but\n18:24 Comment: another yellow card for Leverkusen.\n18:30 Comment: Opportunity for Xabi Alonso to get forward and take a buy-in free kick.\n18:37 Comment: Kiecel was back to deal with it.\n18:40 Comment: And then it's Kramer on the receiving end and it's Thiago.\n18:45 Comment: He will be shown a yellow card despite the protests led by Lewandowski.\n18:48 Comment: And it's two bookings apiece and we've not played 20 minutes.\n18:55 Comment: Obviously, that's a clear yellow card, Thiago.\n18:57 Comment: He hasn't had a kick in the game.\n18:58 Comment: I haven't seen him.\n19:0 Comment: He obviously plays the ball a little bit, but\n19:5 Comment: plays Kramer as well.\n19:7 Comment: I think he's a little bit frustrated as\n19:9 Comment: the game has just gone by and 20 minutes in, he's barely had a kick.\n19:13 Comment: He needs to find a way to get Thiago on the ball.\n19:15 Comment: He's such a great player.\n19:17 Comment: It's only Thiago's third Bundesliga appearance since March last year after\n19:23 Comment: two knee operations, a very serious injury and\n19:28 Comment: perhaps a little over-enthusiastic.\n19:30 Comment: He's very enthusiastic in making his mark on the game.\n19:34 Comment: Bellarabi.\n19:36 Comment: Hilbert.\n19:45 Comment: Space for Bender to work in.\n19:48 Comment: Cross the quality of it.\n19:50 Comment: Should have been higher from a player with Raz Bender's skills.\n19:57 Comment: And the flag goes up against Kiesling.\n20:0 Comment: It's a lot of space on this left-hand channel.\n20:8 Comment: Kiesling might just be offside there, but very tight for the linesman.\n20:12 Comment: But there's a lot of space on that left side.\n20:15 Comment: I think Bayern needs to maybe make a change.\n20:18 Comment: That's the thing about Guardiola.\n20:19 Comment: He's always making changes on the fly.\n20:21 Comment: Tactically making adjustments.\n20:25 Comment: I was speaking to some of the players and they said he's 10 years ahead of everybody else tactically,\n20:29 Comment: which is...\n20:30 Comment: which is quite an incredible compliment.\n20:35 Comment: That's why the great and good of European football covered his signature.\n20:39 Comment: He is, of course, in the last year of his deal with Bayern.\n20:45 Comment: I'm sure speculation will increase as the season goes on, just as to where Guardiola will hang his coat next season.\n20:56 Comment: Well, he won't find a better club and he won't find a better city.\n21:0 Comment: I think that's the thing.\n21:0 Comment: A lot of the players at Bayern Munich used to say, once you leave Bayern Munich, you probably won't find a better club.\n21:6 Comment: And that was often the case.\n21:7 Comment: But I think there's only a handful of clubs you could ever go to.\n21:10 Comment: Manchester United or Manchester City.\n21:14 Comment: I think other than that, if anything, if he leaves, I think it's for a different experience for the Premier League.\n21:19 Comment: Otherwise, I think this is about as good as it gets in terms of the quality of football, the quality of life and the city.\n21:26 Comment: The financial capability.\n21:28 Comment: Signed two players for 78 million.\n21:30 Comment: And they're all very good.\n21:31 Comment: And Vidal and Douglas Costa.\n21:32 Comment: I mean, they have virtually everything.\n21:38 Comment: Robben.\n21:40 Comment: Very nearly bundled his way through.\n21:42 Comment: Papadopoulos just about kept his feet.\n21:48 Comment: Hilbert under pressure from Costa.\n21:49 Comment: They're not being hurried, though.\n21:51 Comment: Leverkusen determined that, like Bayern, they will play it out from the back.\n21:56 Comment: Well, they prefer to have possession.\n21:58 Comment: And they have one of the highest.\n22:0 Comment: They have possession stats in the league.\n22:2 Comment: But when they play Bayern Munich, they know they have to give that up.\n22:5 Comment: They know they're going to have to drop in, be organised.\n22:7 Comment: Their spacing is so good offensively and defensively.\n22:10 Comment: Cover all the spaces.\n22:11 Comment: They press as a group.\n22:26 Comment: The player who's been caught.\n22:27 Comment: Vidal was the aggressor.\n22:30 Comment: No card this time.\n22:32 Comment: That is kind of what you get with Arturo Vidal.\n22:35 Comment: Well, you've got to love him.\n22:37 Comment: You know, for a player to compete as hard as he does with the amount of ability that he has,\n22:42 Comment: I think it's just a beautiful thing.\n22:44 Comment: I think he's an absolute super player.\n22:46 Comment: One of those genuine box-to-box players.\n22:49 Comment: Can do everything.\n22:50 Comment: Tackles, scores goals, creates them.\n22:52 Comment: And he wears his heart on his sleeve.\n22:54 Comment: If I was a manager, I'd love to have a player like that at the heart of my team.\n23:0 Comment: That's a good one.\n23:7 Comment: Chalonolu with the Leverkusen free-kick.\n23:10 Comment: Not quite got his range sorted yet.\n23:16 Comment: And now, McMady can only chase that into touch.\n23:19 Comment: And that's perhaps the one aspect that has let Leverkusen down so far,\n23:22 Comment: as they've not got Kiesling and McMady into their game often enough.\n23:27 Comment: Chalonolu has barely had a kick in open play.\n23:29 Comment: Yeah.\n23:30 Comment: a couple of corners and free kicks, but\n23:31 Comment: need to find a way to get him\n23:34 Comment: on the ball. He's playing on that left-hand\n23:36 Comment: side. They're playing more of a 4-4-2 with\n23:38 Comment: Mehdi up top, with Kiesling\n23:40 Comment: Chalanolu playing off the left,\n23:42 Comment: drifting inside like we see from Eriksen\n23:44 Comment: at Tottenham in the Premier League, but that's\n23:46 Comment: not his natural position. He's more in the\n23:48 Comment: number 10 position, but they\n23:50 Comment: finish against Lazio like that and it works so\n23:52 Comment: well.\n23:55 Comment: Just about the communication\n23:56 Comment: between Tarr and Leno\n23:57 Comment: secure enough.\n24:0 Comment: So these two of the three Bundesliga\n24:2 Comment: sides who brought a 100%\n24:4 Comment: record into the weekend, you'll get\n24:6 Comment: to see the other. Tomorrow\n24:8 Comment: afternoon here on BT Sport Europe,\n24:11 Comment: Borussia Dortmund\n24:12 Comment: playing host to Hertha\n24:14 Comment: quarter-past two. Our coverage of\n24:16 Comment: that game gets underway.\n24:19 Comment: Here's Mehdi\n24:20 Comment: looking to put Bayern under pressure.\n24:27 Comment: Only cleared as far as Chalanolu.\n24:30 Comment: A very intense\n24:49 Comment: ate.\n24:50 Comment: Gilbert, thought about the shot,\n24:51 Comment: is coming down\n24:52 Comment: quickly.\n24:54 Comment: Ben Delici towards Mehdi again,\n24:57 Comment: and Kiesling is the target.\n24:58 Comment: I think with all the pace that they have and the creativity in this Leverkusen team,\n25:1 Comment: you need a centre-forward that can be a target, can hold the ball up,\n25:5 Comment: and Kiesling does a very good job of that.\n25:10 Comment: The Bundesliga game we've got coming up for you is over on BT Sport 1 tomorrow.\n25:14 Comment: Quarter-past four, our coverage starts.\n25:17 Comment: The team that will play Manchester City in the group stages of the Champions League,\n25:20 Comment: Borussia Mönchengladbach, go to Werder Bremen.\n25:24 Comment: So, a chance to run the rule over one of City's Champions League opponents.\n25:30 Comment: And of course, three Premier League sides will play Bundesliga opposition during the group stage,\n25:35 Comment: so it will be an intriguing inter-league contest, if you like.\n25:41 Comment: And it was confirmed this week, incidentally, that Bundesliga has replaced the Premier League\n25:45 Comment: in second place in the UEFA rankings.\n25:48 Comment: Costa with a cross, and a chance, and a goal.\n25:51 Comment: First chance of the game for Thomas Fuller.\n25:53 Comment: And as you'd expect from Bundesliga's top goalscorer, he has gobbled it up.\n25:58 Comment: Fourth goal of the season for Thomas Fuller, and Bayern lead Leverkusen 1-0.\n26:5 Comment: Well, guess who? I mean, Thomas Fuller is always there.\n26:9 Comment: If there's a goal to be had, it's quite incredible.\n26:11 Comment: He just pops up. This is an incredible counter-attack.\n26:14 Comment: I think it's one of the first few times that Bayern's been able to play quick.\n26:19 Comment: Alonso recognises it. Hilbert's far too far inside.\n26:22 Comment: What a time.\n26:53 Comment: Great first touch from Douglas Costa.\n26:55 Comment: Four touches in in the back of the net.\n26:57 Comment: Thomas Fuller, such a great feel for the game.\n27:0 Comment: I don't think there's any player like him in European football.\n27:3 Comment: He just always pops up at the right time.\n27:10 Comment: No current Bayern player has scored more Bundesliga goals than Thomas Fuller.\n27:17 Comment: And here he is, looking to add to the 75. He's already a crew.\n27:23 Comment: And here's the goal.\n27:25 Comment: And it is!\n27:26 Comment: Can't stop the fans from cheering.\n27:27 Comment: And the crowd are cheering, but it's a very, very special match.\n27:33 Comment: And it's a very, very special match.\n27:34 Comment: And he has marked his 200th league appearance for Bayern in fine style as well,\n27:37 Comment: with the opening goal in the game and all that hard work that Leverkusen have done.\n27:42 Comment: Amounts to nothing. The story is a familiar one. Bayern are winning at home.\n27:47 Comment: Well, up to that point, it was a relatively even game.\n27:49 Comment: I thought Leverkusen had done a good job, but...\n27:51 Comment: when you get by in a bit of space to play then they realized that because of\n27:56 Comment: pressing so much great switch from Alonso just opened up the pitch and that\n28:1 Comment: speed from Douglas Costa it's gonna win them a ton of games this season so far\n28:7 Comment: the first three games this season he's been he's been virtually unplayable\n28:11 Comment: Douglas Costa he's been there he was the best player in preseason and it's an\n28:15 Comment: inspired signing. Bayern have breached one of the most resolute defenses\n28:24 Comment: anywhere in Europe 11 clean six sheets in 19 Bundesliga games in 2015 coming\n28:32 Comment: into this evening Leverkusen but keeping Bayern at bay is an altogether different\n28:37 Comment: task. Well it's just a small mistake really from from Hilbert in that moment\n28:43 Comment: you can't go press when there's so much space\n28:45 Comment: terrific first touch and great recognition from Costa to play that\n28:49 Comment: first touch in behind the fullback but Hilbert can't gamble there he just needs\n28:53 Comment: to stay in his position and force Douglas Costa wide one little mistake\n28:58 Comment: like that changes the game\n29:3 Comment: Robin sprints past Papadopoulos and he's picked out a wonderful cross and Costa\n29:11 Comment: so unfortunate could well have been 2-0\n29:15 Comment: it was a tricky one for Costa to control well that's actually Bayern Munich\n29:21 Comment: on the counter-attack again Robin with space to get him behind I think it just\n29:24 Comment: comes off his shin Douglas Costa doesn't get a clean contact and it comes off the\n29:29 Comment: post but so he's just seen Bayern Munich dominate possession but I think Bayern\n29:35 Comment: Munich on the counter-attack when they won the treble under Jupp Heynckes they\n29:40 Comment: played a lot on the counter-attack in the big games if you give these top players space to run him behind they're going to be a tough one.\n29:44 Comment: space to run him behind they're going to be a tough one.\n29:45 Comment: create they're so lethal\n29:53 Comment: well if there was a vulnerability about Bayern last season domestically it was\n29:57 Comment: against the other sides near the top of the table they only won three of their\n30:0 Comment: ten matches against the other teams that finished in the top six and indeed if\n30:7 Comment: that had been a mini league on its own Bayern would have finished bottom of it\n30:10 Comment: but they are ahead against fellow Champions League qualifiers Leverkusen\n30:15 Comment: and Costa was the width of a post away from extending the advantage\n30:32 Comment: Leverkusen quiet with a back four that would not have been anywhere near Pep\n30:39 Comment: Guardiola's thoughts at the beginning of the season four central defenders injured\n30:45 Comment: Alonso for all his many talents is not used to being deployed at the heart of\n30:50 Comment: any team's defense well 30 minutes in he hasn't had to defend yet Alonso so he's\n30:56 Comment: changed the game with one switch of play and that ball there that's what he does\n31:0 Comment: if you can have a player back there Pirlo Alonso that quarterback this ball's\n31:4 Comment: on every time he'll but it's too far over Costa reckons he's got the measure\n31:8 Comment: of the fullback and it's the quickest player in Bundesliga this season\n31:13 Comment: Bellarabi who has to get back and help his fullback out.\n31:15 Comment: Well that's what he needs a bit of protection Bellarabi great winger works\n31:19 Comment: back as well you saw there he needs a little bit of help Hilbert because 1v1\n31:23 Comment: that's a mismatch I think Douglas Costa realizes that no respect for the\n31:28 Comment: defender and just pushes it by him\n31:36 Comment: looking to wrestle back some control Leverkusen\n31:40 Comment: more than matching Bayern for 25 minutes\n31:45 Comment: and then Muller pounced and the tone and tempo of the game has completely changed\n32:15 Comment: it's Costa again\n32:20 Comment: Muller it is taking out the wide position against van Vlent\n32:25 Comment: caught by the Brazilian\n32:30 Comment: questions whether\n32:33 Comment: decision should have gone his way how easily did Costa brush past Hilbert\n32:39 Comment: well he did and I think Hilbert realized but it was too late if anything he\n32:42 Comment: probably should have brought him down in that moment he was too late to get the ball back to him.\n32:45 Comment: he had his arm on him thought about it but it was too little too late\n32:48 Comment: Panat gets it back from Vidal attacking in numbers\n32:57 Comment: just a judge to have been the aggressor in one of the 50-50\n33:3 Comment: I think if anything that might have been a foul the other way that's what I was\n33:7 Comment: expecting when I heard the whistle the protest was not sustained though from Juan Panat.\n33:14 Comment: the protest was not sustained though from Juan Panat.\n33:23 Comment: Bayern's record over Leverkusen is a formidable one especially in Munich\n33:29 Comment: 121 of the last 27 meetings however good Leverkusen have been over the last 10 years they've simply not been able to get the measure of Bayern.\n33:39 Comment: Bela Rabi\n33:51 Comment: and that will be a corner kick\n33:56 Comment: well he predicted that Leverkusen would run and fight for 90 minutes they're not about to give up now\n34:3 Comment: and well if he did Pep Guardiola's words\n34:13 Comment: and with the corner\n34:15 Comment: Kiesling attacking it, cleared as far as Klama.\n34:27 Comment: Sounds like Aladamu on a couple of occasions now,\n34:30 Comment: he's got some support from Mehmedi.\n34:37 Comment: And there's a few better at that sort of thing than he.\n34:41 Comment: He's usually better at that bit as well.\n34:42 Comment: He's so good at that, you're absolutely right.\n34:45 Comment: He's probably the best to keep holding that ball up on that half-turn.\n34:48 Comment: Again, Hilbert gambles and loses.\n34:51 Comment: He was fortunate Levandowski played a poor pass,\n34:53 Comment: because Bayern were in again.\n35:12 Comment: The measure of Bayern's control of the ball perhaps shouldn't surprise us.\n35:17 Comment: I'm not sure that does justice to the part that Leverkusen have played in the contest so far.\n35:31 Comment: Mehmedi.\n35:35 Comment: Wendel.\n35:38 Comment: Wendel adamant that he got something on the ball.\n35:42 Comment: I think the referee needs to put his whistle away.\n35:47 Comment: The amount of free kicks he's given away so far,\n35:50 Comment: that's a good 50-50.\n35:53 Comment: Vidal's aggressive, obviously.\n35:55 Comment: That's what they brought him here for,\n35:56 Comment: but he's blown so many free kicks, given so many yellow cards.\n36:1 Comment: And that's the one thing Guardiola would have told these Bayern Munich players,\n36:4 Comment: don't give away silly free kicks.\n36:12 Comment: There's some way to rival the referee performance we brought you earlier\n36:16 Comment: on BT Sport at St James' Park from Andre Mariner, by all accounts.\n36:23 Comment: One or two contentious decisions in our Barclays Premier League live game for you earlier.\n36:29 Comment: This is Bundesliga.\n36:30 Comment: It's Bayern against Leverkusen.\n36:31 Comment: This is Hakan Calhanoglu!\n36:33 Comment: Goodness me!\n36:34 Comment: Very nearly an addition to the wonderful free kick repertoire of Hakan Calhanoglu.\n36:41 Comment: Honestly, he is just...\n36:42 Comment: Ridiculous.\n36:44 Comment: I've never seen a player strike the ball so cleanly virtually every time.\n36:49 Comment: He just smashes that straight at the crossbar.\n36:52 Comment: Emmanuel Neuer thought that was going to go over, and then it just dipped.\n36:57 Comment: What a sensational weapon that is.\n36:59 Comment: He is.\n37:0 Comment: Honestly, he is scary how good he is.\n37:2 Comment: This guy can decide games.\n37:4 Comment: Last week he did it against Hannover with a free kick.\n37:7 Comment: Against Lazio he scored again.\n37:9 Comment: What an impact he can have.\n37:12 Comment: Is he who takes the corner kick?\n37:17 Comment: Wendel sends it back, but it's not with the kind of quality that Calhanoglu had from a dead ball in a similar position.\n37:31 Comment: Eight Bundesliga goals last season for Calhanoglu.\n37:34 Comment: Six of them were free kicks.\n37:37 Comment: No player has been as deadly from those sorts of positions.\n37:41 Comment: Over the last...\n37:42 Comment: Two seasons in Bundesliga.\n37:45 Comment: As the Turkish international.\n37:49 Comment: Last season he scored the most free kicks in all of Europe.\n37:52 Comment: I think he is the best free kick taker in the world.\n37:56 Comment: His consistency is incredible.\n38:5 Comment: La.\n38:10 Comment: Muller, whose goal remains...\n38:12 Comment: The difference despite Calhanoglu's best efforts.\n38:14 Comment: Thiago.\n38:16 Comment: Lovely footwork.\n38:17 Comment: Costa with another opportunity to cross.\n38:20 Comment: And they closed him down in numbers and Papadopoulos got a crucial touch.\n38:27 Comment: And again it's Bayern Munich's base to counter-attack.\n38:32 Comment: Such good free from Thiago in a tight space.\n38:35 Comment: Muller does so well.\n38:37 Comment: Douglas Costa.\n38:39 Comment: Probably would have scored if it wasn't for Papadopoulos.\n38:41 Comment: What a great well-timed tackle.\n38:45 Comment: Corner-kick to defend and ...\n38:46 Comment: Naver Kusin just about to summon up a weight to prevent Muller making it 2-0.\n38:57 Comment: So far it has lived up to its billing as the game of the weekend in Germany.\n39:4 Comment: Mehmeti.\n39:6 Comment: Benerabi screaming for it in space.\n39:9 Comment: Goes the other way eventually to Wendel.\n39:11 Comment: with Klammer in support.\n39:14 Comment: This is beyond even the reach of Stefan Kiesling.\n39:23 Comment: Dostoyevsky is looking to run down Jonathan Tarr.\n39:26 Comment: He is an impressive young defender.\n39:28 Comment: Good luck with that.\n39:29 Comment: I mean, he's only 19, but what a player so far.\n39:31 Comment: And that first leg against Lazio is probably Leverkusen's best player.\n39:35 Comment: So inexperienced, but such a great athlete.\n39:38 Comment: Powerful.\n39:38 Comment: I love when the manager trusts a young player in such big games.\n39:44 Comment: I don't think you're ever going to run away from Jonathan Tarr.\n39:49 Comment: He was on loan with Fortuna Dusseldorf last season, Tarr,\n39:53 Comment: but Hamburg product, and that is the club that Leverkusen signed him from.\n40:0 Comment: Well, this is part one of an intriguing European doubleheader of football\n40:4 Comment: for you here on BT Sport Europe this evening\n40:6 Comment: from the Allianz Arena.\n40:8 Comment: To another great theatre.\n40:11 Comment: The San Siro, the Giuseppe Miazzolata for Milan\n40:13 Comment: against Empoli in Serie A.\n40:16 Comment: Following us at 7.30 here on BT Sport Europe.\n40:19 Comment: Tomorrow, the big two from Italy.\n40:23 Comment: Roma play host to the champions Juventus.\n40:25 Comment: That is a 4.30 start here on

1.\n40:37 Comment: As Monaco host PSG.\n40:40 Comment: 7 o'clock, our coverage starts also here on BT Sport Europe.\n40:49 Comment: Final five minutes of a first half that has ebbed and flowed\n40:54 Comment: between the teams that finished first and fourth last season.\n41:1 Comment: Teams that will consider those positions to be the minimum\n41:4 Comment: of their domestic requirements for this season.\n41:7 Comment: And again.\n41:19 Comment: Milan under pressure.\n41:21 Comment: Mehdi couldn't quite take over.\n41:27 Comment: Denzel, though, is showing some urgency in industry\n41:30 Comment: and the ball has worked its way to Kiesling.\n41:33 Comment: Marabi gets away with being caught on his heels\n41:36 Comment: and...\n41:37 Comment: Nadal it is who makes the block.\n41:47 Comment: Mbembele.\n41:48 Comment: Leverkusen captain.\n41:49 Comment: Mbembele.\n42:2 Comment: Decollision.\n42:6 Comment: Roving Hilbert.\n42:7 Comment: Alaba.\n42:8 Comment: That's the Leverkusen full-back who came off fractionally worse.\n42:14 Comment: Well, he's a powerhouse, David Alaba,\n42:17 Comment: although he plays as a full-back in central midfield.\n42:20 Comment: I think he's going to be Bayern Munich's best player in a couple of years' time.\n42:25 Comment: He's so talented.\n42:26 Comment: Everybody at Bayern Munich absolutely raves about him,\n42:29 Comment: how talented he is.\n42:31 Comment: That's the player he's covering for at the heart of the Bayern defence.\n42:35 Comment: Jerome Boateng sent off for a couple of yellow cards.\n42:36 Comment: That's the player he's covering for at the heart of the Bayern defence.\n42:37 Comment: Jerome Boateng sent off for a couple of yellow cards.\n42:39 Comment: Hoffenheim.\n42:40 Comment: Jürgen Hoffenheim.\n42:45 Comment: One of four central defenders missing.\n42:47 Comment: The other is Benatti, he's got a thigh injury,\n42:49 Comment: Xavi Martinez and Holger Badstuber still injured.\n42:52 Comment: Costa with the cross.\n42:54 Comment: Couldn't pick out Müller or Lewandowski on this occasion,\n42:57 Comment: but he has been the greatest buy-in threat.\n43:2 Comment: Well, again, 1v1, he's so quick.\n43:5 Comment: Can't believe these Leverkusen defenders,\n43:6 Comment: these Leverkusen defenders are trying to\n43:8 Comment: nip the ball off them, I think they've just got to drop\n43:12 Comment: in and into shape and not allow\n43:14 Comment: them that space to run into but\n43:15 Comment: something they'll have to adjust\n43:17 Comment: It is a demonstration really of the quality\n43:30 Comment: at the very top of Bundesliga\n43:31 Comment: Leverkusen brushing Lazio\n43:33 Comment: one of the most famous names of European\n43:35 Comment: football aside in midweek but\n43:37 Comment: they've not really been able to get close enough\n43:39 Comment: to domestic rivals by\n43:41 Comment: and so far this evening but\n43:43 Comment: Roger Schmidt, very often\n43:46 Comment: a man with a plan\n43:47 Comment: indeed only Pep Guardiola\n43:49 Comment: has accumulated\n43:51 Comment: more points than he amongst the current\n43:54 Comment: Bundesliga managers so\n43:55 Comment: he knows his way around German\n43:57 Comment: football, Roger Schmidt\n43:58 Comment: accumulated more points per game\n44:3 Comment: incidentally rather than\n44:5 Comment: over the span of a career\n44:17 Comment: the first 45 have said to be another\n44:20 Comment: opportunity for Bayern.\n44:22 Comment: Arjen Robben is looking to create one\n44:25 Comment: still going Robben has he gone too far\n44:28 Comment: muted claims for a penalty from those\n44:31 Comment: behind the goal and Robben somewhat belatedly\n44:35 Comment: joins in the appeal\n44:37 Comment: well that ball's obviously\n44:40 Comment: clearly out\n44:40 Comment: give it a contact after that but\n44:43 Comment: Douglas Costa was completely free at the\n44:46 Comment: back post if they would have just\n44:47 Comment: clipped it over the top but it was on Robbins\n44:49 Comment: weaker right foot and often you see him\n44:52 Comment: cross the ball\n44:54 Comment: with his right foot but on this\n44:56 Comment: left hand side Douglas Costa has just\n44:57 Comment: been able to find so much\n\nSecond Half:\n0:31 Comment: Who have won four of their five games in all competitions this season\n0:37 Comment: Robin from Muller's\n0:39 Comment: Quick thinking from the throw in and Robin is in and he's got Lewandowski for support\n0:44 Comment: and Robin\n0:46 Comment: Perhaps took the option to go down and Florian Meyer was not impressed\n0:52 Comment: Well, I think he does brilliantly the referee have to see it one more time\n0:55 Comment: But looks like it goes down far too easy such great play gets away from Jonathan tar\n1:2 Comment: Gets away from Bender\n1:6 Comment: He's had a look he knows Levan Dosti's there and he's tripped over his own feet\n1:9 Comment: I mean, there's a tiny tiny arm on his back from Jonathan tar, but that's never been a penalty terrific refereeing\n1:17 Comment: He can complain only like aria and Robin but good decision\n1:21 Comment: Costa with the\n1:23 Comment: Corner kick the opportunity is not gone for by and just yet Vendel though with the opportunity to clear for\n1:29 Comment: Lever Kuzmin he does but\n1:32 Comment: Managing to get back on the front foot but for the offside flag, the pressure would have been maintained\n1:38 Comment: It is the aspect of his game that infuriates opposition fans and players\n1:43 Comment: I like he's no stranger to hitting the deck. I and Robin and\n1:47 Comment: There were better choices available to him\n1:53 Comment: Yeah, he doesn't need that he's still got a chance to score\n1:57 Comment: He's got a chance to score. He's got a chance to score\n2:4 Comment: Yeah, he doesn't need that he's such a superstar last season when he was fit he was incredible\n2:11 Comment: Probably the best player in the bonus league of last season when he's fit and healthy by me to completely different side as good as by\n2:16 Comment: enough\n2:17 Comment: A different side when Robbins at his best\n2:31 Comment: So the NOLI\n2:34 Comment: Tar and all the way back\n2:37 Comment: The burnt lano\n2:42 Comment: Challenge Olli\n2:45 Comment: Along so a full stretch and then challen allu diving in and catching bit out\n3:6 Comment: Then\n3:9 Comment: Kiesling\n3:12 Comment: Who's need to get him closer to goal challen allu with only France a mat\n3:20 Comment: Well even by his high standards it would have taken some delivery\n3:26 Comment: Here we see it again, I and Robin\n3:30 Comment: He just trips himself\n3:32 Comment: Jonathan Tau's got his right arm just\n3:35 Comment: Grabs him a tiny bit, but the referee can't see that from his position\n3:41 Comment: You\n3:44 Comment: You better than that I there's no need\n3:48 Comment: Bella Robbie\n3:51 Comment: Looking to put ban off under pressure in Spaniard is\n3:55 Comment: conceded possession\n3:58 Comment: Karma\n4:0 Comment: Again\n4:8 Comment: Again demonstrating his defensive abilities\n4:13 Comment: Brant\n4:15 Comment: Kiesling Charles was Stefan Kiesling if he can get there and\n4:18 Comment: No, air is made one save and then David Alaba comes to his rescue with the second\n4:23 Comment: A\n4:25 Comment: Great little cameo from Julian Branton reverse pass for Kiesling good save noia\n4:29 Comment: David Alaba, that's great covering\n4:32 Comment: Left back sentry midfield player playing as a center back today and doing his job\n4:38 Comment: That's genuine sniff that Stefan Kiesling's had\n4:43 Comment: Challen allu that full stretch could do no better\n4:48 Comment: That's probably his one weakness is the fact his pace\n4:51 Comment: But he somehow is able to find a yard. It's incredible. He just takes a touch\n4:57 Comment: Faints that shot gets a yard, which he always seems to be able to find even though he's not the quickest player\n5:2 Comment: But technically is just so brilliant\n5:12 Comment: Let me point you in the direction of some action coming up for you tomorrow night\n5:15 Comment: For our coverage of the British Moto GP and that is over on BT Sport 2\n5:22 Comment: and if you've got a 4k television and you are a BT TV subscriber, it is available for you as well in ultra HD\n5:30 Comment: cost up for buy-in\n5:33 Comment: Crucial touch and then clearance from bend up put on the counter-attack\n5:37 Comment: And with that man in their lineup, what a threat to the team\n5:41 Comment: But on the counter-attack and with that man in their lineup, what a threat by an arc\n5:46 Comment: Well, how many times as Hilbert needed to be shown every time he keeps to go and press?\n5:51 Comment: press high but\n5:53 Comment: Douglas Costa's just\n5:55 Comment: Skipping by him for pace is dreadful defending again from Hilbert\n6:0 Comment: Look at the capitalized on a misplaced pass\n6:7 Comment: Try again\n6:12 Comment: Bend all the\n6:14 Comment: Brazilian fullback who's done so well there but that come by him once more at the moment\n6:19 Comment: They are both\n6:22 Comment: Brazilian fullback who's done so well there but that come by him once more at the moment. They are building up ahead of Steve\n6:29 Comment: Bernard who's playing in the Bundesliga for the first time this season tonight. No outfield Bayern player was involved more often than he last season\n6:56 Comment: Manuel Neuer made more appearances\n6:59 Comment: He's had one chance in his second half.

Who's got lucky, but not quite lucky enough\n9:13 Comment: Again, that high press is killing lever cruising. You have to admire the fact that they want to try and score\n9:19 Comment: But that high press is leaving this back for very vulnerable Todd as well to close that space down\n9:25 Comment: Leina does well, but\n9:27 Comment: Evan dusky is almost in the right spot\n9:31 Comment: Let the duskies reaction told you quickly that that wasn't gonna sneak inside the post\n9:42 Comment: We know the attacks the good moments have come from wide areas saw in that picture there that wide shot everything in central areas\n9:50 Comment: All the body so there's a lot of space out wide. That's why Douglas Costa Ari and Robin have had so much space\n9:56 Comment: If the ball gets wide quickly with a big switch of play\n10:1 Comment: Space 1v1 for these players\n10:8 Comment: Miller gets it back from Tiago running at Jonathan tar\n10:15 Comment: Flames the corner gets the corner\n10:19 Comment: But the teenagers protests\n10:21 Comment: Well had an influence against his former club just yet our tour over at Albert\n10:27 Comment: I'm sure he's keen to get off the mark in terms of Bundesliga goal scoring for by and he does have\n10:33 Comment: one from the cup win over New Higgins\n10:37 Comment: He's doing a different job today, he's gonna have to hold that conception in front of that back three of buying\n10:42 Comment: I\n10:46 Comment: Imagine he train number well rehearsal, inking that you set on to Robin's right foot for a volley Armin\n10:53 Comment: I'm sure quadiola had a different plan like\n10:56 Comment: I can't imagine you try and have a well rehearsed free kick that you've set onto Robin's right\n11:3 Comment: foot for a volley.\n11:4 Comment: I mean I'm sure Guardiola had a different plan with that set piece.\n11:9 Comment: You work on these things all week in training, don't you?\n11:14 Comment: Very different in practice.\n11:17 Comment: Some urgency though displayed by Xavi Alonso.\n11:24 Comment: He wants to get on with it, he wants Bayern to kill off this game.\n11:42 Comment: Ridale.\n11:46 Comment: Just beyond Costa.\n11:48 Comment: That's a good ball.\n11:50 Comment: That's a good idea, it's not a good ball.\n11:52 Comment: That ball's killed Roger Schmidt and Leverkusen so far.\n11:55 Comment: That quick switch of play from Alonso and Thiago and Ridale getting it into Douglas Costa\n11:59 Comment: or Arjen Robben has really made Robert look very vulnerable.\n12:7 Comment: Robben.\n12:10 Comment: Ridale.\n12:14 Comment: And again from the more central position is Arturo Ridale.\n12:18 Comment: Lovely disguise Lewandowski.\n12:22 Comment: That was well defended by Hilbert.\n12:24 Comment: Great covering, perfect full back play.\n12:27 Comment: Tucking in.\n12:28 Comment: And then Wendel who is on a yellow card and I'm sure Thomas Müller is reminding Florian\n12:33 Comment: Mayer of that fact.\n12:36 Comment: This is not good to see from Bayern.\n12:38 Comment: I'm sure Florian Mayer is aware of who he has and hasn't booked.\n12:48 Comment: There he is now.\n12:51 Comment: Seeking out the Brazilian is he?\n12:53 Comment: Or is he measuring out the distance for the wall?\n12:59 Comment: Doesn't matter what language you speak Owen, that message is pretty clear from the referee.\n13:5 Comment: Well, he takes a gamble.\n13:7 Comment: He's already had an early yellow card after six minutes.\n13:11 Comment: So far he's kept himself in check, just two quick fouls in the last couple of minutes.\n13:18 Comment: One more and you're off.\n13:21 Comment: I think it was the message.\n13:30 Comment: The eyes suggest Alonso has it.\n13:34 Comment: The on Vidal.\n13:36 Comment: And it is a penalty for Bayern.\n13:38 Comment: The push on Vidal has been punished by Florian Mayer.\n13:43 Comment: And Bayern with the perfect opportunity to seal the three points.\n13:47 Comment: Bayern have looked at it as well.\n13:50 Comment: Hilbert to be, if anything, I think he takes his hands away.\n13:54 Comment: It's a great delivery from Alonso.\n13:57 Comment: But the bodies of that back post.\n13:59 Comment: I think it's very, very friendly for the referee to give that.\n14:3 Comment: Hilbert's obviously close.\n14:4 Comment: Puts his arms up as Vidal jumps.\n14:7 Comment: But I think he gets that wrong.\n14:9 Comment: I think so far he's blown far too many little free kicks and fouls.\n14:13 Comment: And he's given a penalty there that would have killed this game off.\n14:20 Comment: Our play.\n14:22 Comment: Thomas Muller with the opportunity to put Bayern clear.\n14:31 Comment: And Muller marks Bundesliga appearance 200 with a double for Bayern.\n14:37 Comment: Fifth goal of the season.\n14:39 Comment: And the champions are going to the top of the table again.\n14:42 Comment: They lead Leverkusen 2-0.\n14:50 Comment: I imagine the best team in the Bundesliga gets a little bit of luck.\n14:54 Comment: See how good they can be.\n14:57 Comment: I think just a good bit of acting from Vidal gets a penalty.\n15:2 Comment: There's no doubt about that.\n15:4 Comment: Thomas Muller just waits for Leno to jump out the way.\n15:7 Comment: So calm. So patient.\n15:11 Comment: Didn't want to look at the ball.\n15:12 Comment: Looked at the place in the goal that he wanted Leno to fall into.\n15:17 Comment: Straight down the middle.\n15:23 Comment: And that goal has also ended Hakan Çalhanoğlu's involvement in proceedings this evening.\n15:29 Comment: And Leverkusen have taken off their most dangerous player.\n15:31 Comment: They've given up. Basically.\n15:33 Comment: Because if he goes off, I think they still had a way to get back in this game.\n15:38 Comment: I thought they had little glimpses.\n15:40 Comment: Some half opportunities.\n15:42 Comment: Kießling as well.\n15:43 Comment: Çalhanoğlu at the start of that second half.\n15:45 Comment: But taking him off with 30 minutes to go is a sign that I think they realise they've lost this game.\n15:54 Comment: The player who's come on, incidentally, is the Australian Robbie Cruz.\n15:58 Comment: Who has had a horrid 20 months of injuries.\n16:2 Comment: This is just his ninth appearance from the bench in that time.\n16:5 Comment: And this is as much football as he will have played since two Decembers ago.\n16:12 Comment: So it's an opportunity perhaps for him to build some match fitness.\n16:15 Comment: But it does seem to be a recognition of Bayern's superiority in the game that Çalhanoğlu has been sacrificed.\n16:25 Comment: It's Alonso who deals with the free kicks.\n16:28 Comment: Clears it as far as Brandt.\n16:31 Comment: Wendel.\n16:34 Comment: And then the flag goes up.\n16:35 Comment: Well, much as you wouldn't want to deny a player who's had such a miserable time of it over the last couple of years,\n16:42 Comment: an opportunity for some game time.\n16:44 Comment: Roger Smith.\n16:46 Comment: That's not like him, is it?\n16:47 Comment: Throwing in the towel?\n16:50 Comment: Well, I think you realise they tried for that equaliser.\n16:56 Comment: The game was still 1-0.\n16:57 Comment: Leverkusen had a couple of half chances.\n16:59 Comment: I think once that second one went in, maybe just decided to play a bit more.\n17:4 Comment: Çalhanoğlu wasn't really able to get a foothold in the game.\n17:8 Comment: Even though he's Leverkusen's best player.\n17:10 Comment: Just couldn't have an impact.\n17:11 Comment: Bayern had too much possession.\n17:17 Comment: Dela Ravi.\n17:20 Comment: Nicked off him by Lahm.\n17:22 Comment: Müller on a hat-trick on the surge.\n17:24 Comment: All five of his goals have come in the league.\n17:27 Comment: Thomas Müller.\n17:28 Comment: He is certainly the early pace setter in that group.\n17:31 Comment: He's going to be the first player to come off the bench.\n17:34 Comment: And he's going to be the first player to come off the bench.\n17:36 Comment: So, we're looking forward to the next game.\n17:38 Comment: And we'll see you on the pitch.\n17:40 Comment: Bye.\n17:53 Comment: I don't think you can coach Thomas Müller.\n17:55 Comment: I just think he's a one-off.\n17:57 Comment: His ability to recognize space and find it.\n17:59 Comment: Make intelligent runs.\n18:1 Comment: His use of the pitch.\n18:3 Comment: I think he's a one-off in European football.\n18:5 Comment: And at 25 years of age, only Manuel Neuer.\n18:7 Comment: He's a great player.\n19:21 Comment: Bullock and he now to a provider.\n19:29 Comment: This may well be the pattern that the game settles into.\n19:40 Comment: Bernat, Costa, gets the feet moving.\n19:46 Comment: Arturo Vidal, and Thiago!\n19:52 Comment: Well, they'll all be trying their luck.\n19:55 Comment: And then this comes up for Schind.\n19:58 Comment: The penalty from Thomas Muller again, just wait for Bayern Mena to lay down.\n20:4 Comment: Mario Balotelli is about the only player I think who's cooler as he steps up to take a penalty than Thomas Muller.\n20:14 Comment: Yeah, he's just such a unique player, Thomas. Such a great teammate as well.\n20:17 Comment: Very unselfish. One of those players that doesn't have to fall at his feet to be effective.\n20:23 Comment: His recognition of space is perfect for this Bayern Munich team.\n20:28 Comment: What do you think when you see other teams being linked with him?\n20:32 Comment: I think it's ambitious. I'm sure he'd love to play in the Premier League.\n20:36 Comment: I think it suits him. He could play anywhere because he doesn't rely on pace or power.\n20:41 Comment: He just has a great instinct and a great feeling.\n20:43 Comment: That's going to work anywhere, but after losing Bastian Schweinsteiger to Manchester United, you just can't imagine him leaving.\n20:51 Comment: I think the fans would go into meltdown mode.\n20:54 Comment: Bayern Munich has always had those players that fans can identify with.\n20:58 Comment: Philipp Lahm, Neuer, real German parts of their team.\n21:3 Comment: I think it's important for the identity of the football club.\n21:6 Comment: I don't think Bayern Munich can afford to let Thomas Muller go.\n21:9 Comment: Arjen Robben, another crucial cog in the Bayern machine.\n21:13 Comment: Held up by Papadopoulos.\n21:28 Comment: Here he is, cropping up on the left-hand side. Muller looking for Lewandowski and nearly finding Thiago.\n21:35 Comment: Wiedau.\n21:38 Comment: Robben.\n21:43 Comment: Just needed Lewandowski to take a slightly earlier gamble and it would have been 3-0.\n21:49 Comment: I don't think any of the Bayern players are there because nobody thinks Arjen Robben is going to cross that and stand it up with his right foot.\n21:54 Comment: What a ball that was. Just stands it up perfectly at the back post.\n21:59 Comment: Normally Thomas Muller is there to tap that in.\n22:1 Comment: Lewandowski, Douglas Costa on that left-hand side could have easily been there.\n22:9 Comment: Leverkusen's 100% record looks like it's going.\n22:13 Comment: Bayern will be extended into the third game of the season.\n22:17 Comment: What about Borussia Dortmund?\n22:20 Comment: The other member of the trio with back-to-back wins at the start of the season.\n22:24 Comment: They are in action for you tomorrow here on BT Sport Europe.\n22:28 Comment: 2.15 start for the visit of Hertha from Berlin.\n22:33 Comment: And that is followed at quarter-past four over on BT Sport One.\n22:38 Comment: By Werder Bremen against Borussia Mönchengladbach.\n22:41 Comment: If you're a fan of Manchester City, it's an opportunity to run the rule over one of your Champions League opponents to come.\n22:50 Comment: Lucien Varga as Gladbach.\n22:53 Comment: Well, he's one of the best managers in the Bundesliga.\n22:56 Comment: Beat Bayern Munich twice last season with a terrific game plan.\n22:59 Comment: He'll have a plan for Manchester City, but Man City are playing like they are now.\n23:4 Comment: They almost have too much firepower for anybody.\n23:7 Comment: Great to see that change of tactics from playing two centre-forwards, playing one up.\n23:11 Comment: It's had a big impact so far early in this season.\n23:15 Comment: I alluded to it earlier, Owen, that there will be three match-ups in the group stages between Premier League sides and Bundesliga sides.\n23:23 Comment: Having played in both leagues, who do you expect to come out on top if that was a little mini-contest?\n23:29 Comment: I think Bayern Munich is, with Barcelona, the best team in Europe.\n23:32 Comment: So I think they'll top that group against Arsenal, but there's no shame in finishing second to Bayern Munich.\n23:39 Comment: Obviously, that Gladbach team was terrific last season,\n23:44 Comment: but they're going to struggle to deal with the demands of Europe and the Bundesliga.\n23:49 Comment: They're up against a very talented side in Manchester City, so I think Manchester City is heavy favourites there.\n23:56 Comment: Lewandowski turns away from Papadopoulos, looking to charge past Jonathan Tarr.\n24:1 Comment: We'll get another opportunity.\n24:3 Comment: Kosta on the overlap.\n24:5 Comment: Appeals for handball.\n24:9 Comment: As Florian Mayer pointed to the spot again, yes he has.\n24:15 Comment: And is it Hilbert who's conceded the penalty again?\n24:18 Comment: That's a dreadful decision from the referee.\n24:22 Comment: Well, he was penalised for a shove on Vidal for the previous penalty.\n24:28 Comment: And he has been adjudged to use deliberately his arms there.\n24:32 Comment: And what on earth is going on?\n24:35 Comment: Surely Arturo Vidal is trying to persuade Arjen Robben to allow Thomas Muller to complete his hat trick.\n24:42 Comment: Muller, on a brace, is not going to take the penalty.\n24:46 Comment: Instead, Arjen Robben will.\n24:47 Comment: Why is that unselfish?\n24:49 Comment: Bayern Munich's best player.\n24:50 Comment: Everybody acknowledges Arjen Robben as Bayern Munich's best player.\n24:53 Comment: Even though they have so many superstars, Arjen Robben fit and healthy is their best player.\n24:58 Comment: Get him some goals, get his head in the game.\n25:0 Comment: Get him some goals, get his confidence up.\n25:3 Comment: Thomas Muller is so unselfish.\n25:6 Comment: Arjen Robben.\n25:8 Comment: 3-0 Bayern.\n25:9 Comment: And once again, undoubtedly, they are the team to beat in Bundesliga this season.\n25:15 Comment: An emphatic message sent out.\n25:18 Comment: They are clear against one of their expected rivals.\n25:21 Comment: They lead Leverkusen 3-0.\n25:24 Comment: Well, and thanks to the referee, who I think has had a nightmare.\n25:27 Comment: I mean, they started with giving away free kicks very early on in the game.\n25:31 Comment: Gave yellow cards far too early in this game.\n25:35 Comment: That's the second penalty.\n25:37 Comment: The second penalty there was in one.\n25:40 Comment: Leverkusen were in this game at 1-0, but that second penalty, or that first penalty to make it 2-0.\n25:47 Comment: Thomas Muller converted.\n25:49 Comment: Virtually no contact from Hilbert.\n25:52 Comment: And Vidal.\n25:54 Comment: I think the referee's had a nightmare.\n25:55 Comment: Bayern Munich have been the better team without a shadow of a doubt.\n26:1 Comment: Kroos looking to get in.\n26:2 Comment: And Kroos with the chance.\n26:4 Comment: He'll get a follow-up.\n26:5 Comment: The whistle, though, is gone.\n26:6 Comment: And again, it is a handball decision that has gone against Bayer Leverkusen.\n26:10 Comment: And Robby Kroos can't believe it.\n26:13 Comment: There he is.\n26:14 Comment: There he is handing another one out.\n26:16 Comment: He's on a mission, it seems today.\n26:18 Comment: It is handball.\n26:20 Comment: Can't blame him for trying to just reach out and get a touch.\n26:23 Comment: Plays it with his arm.\n26:26 Comment: Takes a bounce.\n26:27 Comment: It's just a bit too high for him.\n26:32 Comment: It was 20 months of frustration for Robby Kroos coming out there.\n26:35 Comment: He thought, well, at the end of it all, I can score a goal at the Allianz Arena by hook or by crook.\n26:45 Comment: Bayern with the luxury of a cushion.\n26:49 Comment: Able to make the change.\n26:51 Comment: Juan Bernat.\n26:53 Comment: His first involvement in Bundesliga this season is over.\n26:58 Comment: Juan in his place as a player.\n27:1 Comment: Making his first league appearance of the campaign.\n27:6 Comment: Dante, the Brazilian, is coming off.\n27:9 Comment: Well, and he'll probably make a second appearance for another team.\n27:12 Comment: Looks like he's not going to be staying at Bayern Munich.\n27:14 Comment: Such a great character in this dressing room.\n27:18 Comment: It was terrific when he came over from Gladbach a few seasons ago,\n27:21 Comment: but hasn't really been able to find a place in the starting XI anymore.\n27:25 Comment: A lot of rumours that he might go to Wolfsburg or Gladbach where he came.\n27:30 Comment: He'd be a big loss.\n27:31 Comment: I think the one thing Bayern don't have is options in the centre-forward and centre-back position.\n27:37 Comment: Muller charging into the penalty area.\n27:40 Comment: Papadopoulos just about staying with him, stride for stride.\n27:47 Comment: I like Papadopoulos as a defender.\n27:49 Comment: He's always aggressive, always looking to press.\n27:58 Comment: Gerdau, giving it away.\n28:1 Comment: Easing the pressure momentarily.\n28:3 Comment: Falerabi running into Lahm though.\n28:6 Comment: And now here's Lewandowski.\n28:7 Comment: The goal from him is about all this is missing for Bayern Munich.\n28:14 Comment: Thiago, desperate to see up a team-mate.\n28:18 Comment: Desperate to see up Douglas Costa.\n28:23 Comment: Yeah, I'd agree.\n28:24 Comment: Team up. Don't do it on his right foot.\n28:29 Comment: Still organising in his unusual position at the heart of the Bayern defence.\n28:35 Comment: Joey Alonso.\n28:39 Comment: Well, Iain Robben tried to win his team a penalty that wasn't earlier on in the half.\n28:45 Comment: They've had two that possibly shouldn't have been since then and that has killed the game off.\n28:51 Comment: Well, Roger Smith's going to go crazy after this game.\n28:53 Comment: The referee's had a nightmare.\n28:55 Comment: Bayern Munich have been the better side.\n28:58 Comment: To give those two penalties in a game of this magnitude.\n29:1 Comment: Poor from the referee.\n29:3 Comment: Robben.\n29:5 Comment: Leaves Papadopoulos for dead and then can't pick out Douglas Costa.\n29:11 Comment: Alin Leverkusen.\n29:14 Comment: Need to shut up shop a little bit here.\n29:16 Comment: Far too open.\n29:22 Comment: Five goals on the opening day against Hamburg here.\n29:25 Comment: Bayern.\n29:27 Comment: A couple enough to seal Hoffenheim last week.\n29:31 Comment: Three so far tonight but it could yet be more.\n29:35 Comment: Brandt up against Dante.\n29:36 Comment: Julian Brandt.\n29:38 Comment: Nadal still running against his old employers.\n29:42 Comment: Two away from home with ten men.\n29:44 Comment: Still pretty good.\n29:46 Comment: Lewandowski reckons he's got the legs.\n29:49 Comment: Looks like he might just have Robert Lewandowski.\n29:52 Comment: Robben in support.\n29:53 Comment: Lewandowski went to load him.\n29:54 Comment: Leno is equal to it.\n29:58 Comment: I think that was payback because Robben didn't play him in two minutes earlier.\n30:4 Comment: How Lewandowski doesn't square that from Robben.\n30:7 Comment: I'll never know.\n30:8 Comment: Would have been a simple tap in but\n30:11 Comment: Leverkusen need to be careful.\n30:12 Comment: This could be four or five already.\n30:15 Comment: Robben.\n30:17 Comment: Doesn't pop to stand it up right.\n30:19 Comment: But this time takes the outlet of Philipp Lahm.\n30:27 Comment: Papadopoulos is growing in stature as the game's gone on.\n30:30 Comment: Leno hasn't had too many saves tonight.\n30:33 Comment: That was a good one to deny.\n30:34 Comment: Lewandowski.\n30:35 Comment: Nothing he could do about\n30:37 Comment: Muller's goal in the first half.\n30:39 Comment: He certainly can't hold him responsible for either of the penalties that have beaten him.\n30:44 Comment: This is exactly what the games look like.\n30:46 Comment: Leverkusen in Bayern's half trying to press\n30:49 Comment: Papadopoulos against Lewandowski there.\n30:51 Comment: Skips by him. No chance.\n30:54 Comment: He's just got to square that Lewandowski.\n30:56 Comment: Simple tap in.\n30:59 Comment: Maybe he'd argue he didn't see him but I think he knew Arjen Robben was always going to be there at that back post.\n31:8 Comment: Well, last season was the first time in four attempts that Robert Lewandowski failed to score 20 league goals in a season.\n31:15 Comment: Like Arjen Robben, he got 17.\n31:17 Comment: So,\n31:18 Comment: it actually feels that he's on a personal mission to\n31:21 Comment: get back past that milestone once more.\n31:24 Comment: I think he realises Muller scored two.\n31:28 Comment: Robben scored penalty.\n31:30 Comment: You know, he wants to get his name on the score sheet.\n31:31 Comment: He's in centre forward. That's what he gets paid for.\n31:33 Comment: Arjen Robben.\n31:36 Comment: Arjen Robben getting forward.\n31:39 Comment: I think it's a full back now of course since the introduction of Dante.\n31:57 Comment: It's a question now really for Bayern as to how intent they are in sending out a message to\n32:3 Comment: one of the few teams in\n32:5 Comment: Bundesliga\n32:7 Comment: who would be capable of\n32:9 Comment: staying with them this season.\n32:13 Comment: Robben's evening is over.\n32:18 Comment: His first Bundesliga goal of the season to his name.\n32:21 Comment: Mario Götze, the player coming on for him.\n32:27 Comment: As for the Leverkusen change,\n32:29 Comment: well that is the\n32:32 Comment: introduction of Sebastian Bonisch\n32:36 Comment: who is on to replace Wendel in what will be a\n32:39 Comment: like-for-like swap.\n32:43 Comment: First appearance of the season for the Polish defender.\n32:48 Comment: And his fifth appearance in 2015.\n32:59 Comment: Wendel on a yellow card.\n33:0 Comment: That is probably a sensible piece of\n33:2 Comment: management from Roger Schmid.\n33:8 Comment: They're just\n33:10 Comment: ambitious today to try and press Bayern high but it just hasn't worked out.\n33:13 Comment: Götze straight into the game.\n33:14 Comment: Muller with the cross.\n33:16 Comment: Behind it goes Götze who is looking to get on the end of the return.\n33:21 Comment: Lerner has been hurt in the process.\n33:24 Comment: And the goalkeeper is in the way.\n33:26 Comment: Lerner has been hurt in the process.\n33:29 Comment: Jonathan Tah just played Thomas Muller onside.\n33:34 Comment: A little collision at that near post. Lerner, Tah, Götze\n33:38 Comment: all arriving at the same time but\n33:40 Comment: you wouldn't know Leverkusen are one of the best sides defensively\n33:43 Comment: in the Bundesliga.

    "summary": "In a dominant performance, Bayern Munich secured a comfortable 3-0 victory over Bayer Leverkusen, showcasing their prowess at the Allianz Arena. The match, which saw both sides come into the fixture with perfect records in this season's Bundesliga campaign, ended with the defending champions maintaining their untarnished start.\n\n### First Half\n\nFrom the kickoff, Bayern Munich displayed their intent to dominate the match, despite missing key defenders due to suspension and injuries. They coped well without the suspended Boateng and injured Benatia, with Xabi Alonso and David Alaba stepping up in an unfamiliar defensive line. Early signs of Bayern's dominance were evident as they pressed high and controlled possession.\n\nLeverkusen, under the guidance of the promising young manager Roger Schmidt, came into the game on the back of a strong Champions League performance against Lazio. Their high-pressing game and defensive work rate were initially noticeable, with players like Bellarabi and Caglanoglu showing their pace and skill in wide areas.\n\nBayern's first significant chance came in the early minutes with a corner kick taken by Thiago, although it was well collected by Leverkusen's young goalkeeper Bernd Leno. Throughout the first half, the surface of the Allianz Arena drew some attention as it appeared bumpy, causing a few unpredictable bounces that the players had to deal with.\n\nThroughout the opening exchanges, Leverkusen tried to exploit the lack of familiarity in Bayern's backline with high pressing and targeted attacks down the flanks. However, central midfield pairing of Kramer and Bender provided a strong base for the visitors' defensive efforts, breaking up several Bayern moves with their aggressive style.\n\nDespite this, Bayern's relentless forward pressure paid off in the 26th minute when Thomas Muller scored his fourth goal of the season. The home side capitalized on a swift offensive play orchestrated by Alonso's impeccable switch of play, finding Douglas Costa in space. Costa's pace and cross into the box were met with a clinical finish by Muller, putting Bayern in the lead.\n\nAs the game proceeded, Bayern continued to exploit the spaces down the flanks, with Costa and Robben being regular threats. Robben displayed his agility and vision, setting up multiple opportunities which either went wide or were blocked by the resilient Leverkusen defense.\n\nLeverkusen had their moments too, particularly in the form of Hakan Caglanoglu whose free-kick abilities posed a constant threat. Just before halftime, he struck the crossbar with a fiercely driven effort, showcasing why he's regarded as one of the best from dead-ball situations in Europe. Despite this, Bayern's defense held firm, ensuring they went into halftime with their lead intact.\n\n### Second Half\n\nThe second half began with Bayern showing no signs of slowing down. Early on, Arjen Robben burst into the box after receiving a quick throw-in from Muller but tripped over his feet, leading to penalty claims that were rightly dismissed by the referee.\n\nBayern continued to press, with their high-tempo game plan putting constant pressure on Leverkusen. In the 59th minute, Muller was bundled over in the box by Hilbert, and the referee pointed to the spot. Muller stepped up and coolly slotted the penalty home, marking his 200th Bundesliga appearance with a brace.\n\nLeverkusen tried to mount a response, introducing Robbie Cruz, who has had a difficult spell with injuries over the past 20 months. However, his introduction was seen more as a chance for him to gain match fitness rather than a tactical decision to change the game's flow.\n\nBayern's superior fitness and tactical discipline began to shine through as the second half wore on. They maintained their high pressing and quick passing, with Douglas Costa continuing to torment the Leverkusen defense. Robbins' speed and skill were also on full display as he played several pinpoint crosses into the penalty area.\n\nIn the 72nd minute, yet another controversial decision from the referee saw Hilbert adjudged to have handled the ball in the box. This time, Arjen Robben stepped up to take the penalty, which he converted with ease, solidifying Bayern's command with a 3-0 lead. The home fans erupted in celebration, acknowledging their team's high-quality play.\n\nFrom this point onward, Bayern were in full control. Leverkusen, visibly deflated from the penalty decisions and Bayern's relentless attack, struggled to find a way back into the game. Pep Guardiola took the opportunity to make tactical substitutions, bringing on Mario Götze for Robben and Dante for Bernat, further shoring up their dominance.\n\nCosta's contributions went beyond his assists; his flair and skill were epitomized by a stunning piece of individual brilliance where he juggled past defenders, adding an additional layer of entertainment for the spectators. His ability to change pace and direction at will made him a standout player, justifying the praise he had been receiving since his arrival at Bayern.\n\nIn the final quarter of the game, despite some valiant efforts from Bellarabi and young talents like Jonathan Tarr, Leverkusen could not penetrate Bayern's solid defense. Neuer was largely untroubled in goal, as Alaba and Alonso marshaled the backline with authority and composure.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBayern Munich's emphatic 3-0 victory over Bayer Leverkusen was a clear statement of intent from the reigning Bundesliga champions. It showcased their depth, tactical flexibility, and the individual brilliance of players like Muller, Costa, and Robben. Despite some contentious refereeing decisions, the quality of Bayern’s play was undeniable, and they thoroughly deserved their win.\n\nThis performance sent a strong message to their Bundesliga rivals and reinforced their position at the top of the table. For Leverkusen, it was a learning experience and a sign of the heights they aspire to reach. Guardiola's Bayern continues to be a force to reckon with, blending skill, pace, and tactical acumen to devastating effect."
