FSV Mainz 05 0 - 3 Bayern\n\nFirst Half:\n\n0:0 Comment: The hosts in the red jerseys and white pants and from the right\n0:5 Comment: to the left in the first round.\n0:31 Comment: So let's see how Bayern are sorted. At first it looks like a chain of four.\n0:38 Comment: You have to check that again and again.\n0:41 Comment: Grafila on the left, he also plays every day for the piano on the right.\n0:46 Comment: Martinez and Alaba are the two central defenders at FC Bayern.\n0:52 Comment: At least that's what it looks like at the beginning.\n0:56 Comment: Kostoplas Kostal on the left, offensive artificial commands on the right.\n1:3 Comment: Basse Salaba has excelled as a central defender in the last few weeks,\n1:9 Comment: After we are in Munich and therefore with Bad Stuba and also with Medi Benat, two regular employees are not available.\n1:16 Comment: I'm lame.\n1:21 Comment: Lewandowski, first touch of the ball for the Pole.\n1:26 Comment: And Douglas Kostar can't get it under control anymore.\n1:30 Comment: 27 years old, second season at FC Bayern.\n1:35 Comment: Robert Lewandowski, today he can score his hundredth Bundesliga goal.\n1:40 Comment: He doesn't have to score five times like he did on Tuesday, as long as he's successful once is enough.\n1:46 Comment: So, Rafinha is left full-back, where Juan Bernat, the Spaniard, was at home last against Wolfsburg.\n2:7 Comment: Alaba.\n2:11 Comment:  Philipp Lahm.\n2:19 Comment: Mainz didn't have a good start here at home on the first match day,\n2:23 Comment: There was a 0-1 draw against the promoted team from Ingolstadt.\n2:27 Comment: Mainz's last two home players played successfully.\n2:31 Comment: Mainz scored six goals here in the two games against Hannover 96, 3-0 and Hoffenheim 3-1.\n2:39 Comment: Douglas Kostar against two and he gets the first corner.\n2:45 Comment: It's the 40th for FC Bayern this season.\n2:49 Comment: So far, the Munich team hasn't scored from corners yet.\n3:10 Comment: Yes, first shot opportunity for Thomas Müller, there was no one from the Mainz defense there,\n3:17 Comment: which would have hindered him with this shot, but he didn't hit the ball cleanly.\n3:23 Comment: Thomas Müller, first chance to score in this game after just over three minutes.\n3:29 Comment: In general, it is expected that the four Bs in the Mainz defense\n3:35 Comment: There will be a lot of work to do today.\n3:38 Comment: Brusinski, Pungert, Bell and Bengtsson, these are the men in the four-man defense chain, both hosts.\n3:45 Comment: Then we have Pep Guardiola, who immediately calls the first player over.\n3:55 Comment: Here's Blasis, who collided with Javi Martínez in the four-man defense chain.\n4:4 Comment: Thiago was with the coach for a moment and then immediately got the ball, but only for a short time.\n4:12 Comment: Strong ball from Xabi Alonso for Costa, Lafinha goes with him.\n4:21 Comment: And then the third shot.\n4:23 Comment: And then it's a good chance for Bayern Munich.\n4:27 Comment: Alonso for Costa, Lafinha goes with him.\n4:40 Comment: Pungert against Costa and that gives a goal kick from Lloris Karius' goal.\n4:46 Comment: Here we have Douglas Costa, the Brazilian, for a transfer fee of 30 million euros.\n4:52 Comment: One goal, four assists, his record after the first six games.\n5:5 Comment: Lafinha, oh, he's a bit short, but Neuer, as we all know, plays along, pays close attention, and breaks away quickly in front of the line.\n5:11 Comment: And here he is quicker on the ball than Mutu, the Japanese, in the front center of the first ref's attack.\n5:18 Comment: And then the second one.\n5:22 Comment: Coman, Müller.\n5:26 Comment: Success of Latsa, the Frenchman, 19 years young.\n5:32 Comment: Against Slecoman.\n5:34 Comment: And the game runs as expected right from the start.\n5:39 Comment: Bayern not only want to get a chance here, but also want to score the opening goal as quickly as possible.\n5:48 Comment: And that is the right of Lafinha.\n5:50 Comment: He'll have to adjust a bit first.\n5:54 Comment: Actually at home on the right side for years, today it's on the left.\n5:59 Comment: That's Martin Schmitz, he's already said it, everyone has to be bigger than they actually are,\n6:5 Comment: When it's against FC Bayern and you also want to have a chance at the same time,\n6:11 Comment: to get a point or two against Munich.\n6:19 Comment: This is Jörg Engtson, Swedish international, left full-back at Mainz 05.\n6:28 Comment: Had a relatively uncomfortable evening on Wednesday in Leverkusen against Karim Bellarabi.\n6:35 Comment: It probably won't be much more comfortable for the Swede today against Kingsley Coman.\n6:41 Comment: Xabi Alonso.\n6:45 Comment: But a lot of things for Bayern are on the left offensive side in the early stages.\n6:56 Comment: The ball isn't that good.\n7:25 Comment: Xabi Alonso.\n7:38 Comment: So, Mainz in their own half, let Bayern come.\n7:48 Comment: Play against the ball in a 4-4-2 formation.\n7:51 Comment: The hosts Udo and Mali, the people from Mainz, are the first to die.\n7:59 Comment: Now Bayern take the first free kick after Vorland-Lewandowski from a very dangerous position.\n8:8 Comment: Pumat against the Pole and we don't need to argue any further about the right.\n8:20 Comment: So, Sebastian Dankwart in conversation with Xabi Alonso.\n8:25 Comment: There are a number of Bayern players who are certainly capable of taking dangerous free shots.\n8:31 Comment: So far, Xabi Alonso has scored all four competitive goals from free kicks for Bayern.\n8:35 Comment: David Alaba also scored twice last season with a direct free kick.\n8:41 Comment: Thiago is there, Thomas Müller, a bit of choice in this situation with Munich.\n8:55 Comment: Thiago, the loop for Müller and he only brings the touch of the tip of his right leg to the ball.\n9:4 Comment: You thought, now he's hanging up, either for Alaba or Xabi Alonso.\n9:8 Comment: But Bayern had something else in mind with this free kick.\n9:11 Comment: Good variant with Thiago and Müller.\n9:25 Comment: Xabi Alonso immediately attacked by Lanza.\n9:34 Comment: Lewandowski, well scored.\n9:46 Comment: He has to get out of there again, Manuel Neuer's header defense against Yunus Mali.\n9:52 Comment: Of course there is always a certain risk when it comes to Manuel Neuer's excursions.\n9:58 Comment: Bayern are already back in the lead with Müller.\n10:1 Comment: Lame.\n10:4 Comment: The ball gets stuck to Bell and then Coman fouls.\n10:9 Comment: And that's why the free kick for the first FSV Mainz 05.\n10:13 Comment: Who has lost all of the last six games against Bayern and with a goal difference of 3 to 16.\n10:20 Comment: But there were definitely games that Bayern won.\n10:25 Comment: That was the last game before the winter break, just before Christmas.\n10:29 Comment: Mainz even led in the 1-2 defeat.\n10:34 Comment: Through Elkin Soto's goal, then there was the equalizer through Bastian Schweinsteiger's free kick.\n10:40 Comment: And Munich's winning goal only came in the 9th minute.\n10:43 Comment: And then Bayern's victory.\n10:46 Comment: That was the last game before the winter break, just before Christmas.\n10:49 Comment: That was the equalizer with Bastian Schweinsteiger's free kick.\n10:53 Comment: And Munich's winning goal was only scored in the 90th minute by Arjen Robben.\n10:58 Comment: And that was a strong performance that FSV showed in that game.\n11:4 Comment: And we still have Matthias Sammer in our ears, who praised the opponent before kick-off.\n11:10 Comment: And once again pointed out the difficulty of his team's task here today.\n11:20 Comment: Kaby Martinez.\n11:25 Comment: Alaba.\n11:29 Comment: Xabi Alonso.\n11:33 Comment: Now Brusinski is challenged against Costa.\n11:37 Comment: But you don't have to go there, Xabi Alonso's right-back ball had too much momentum.\n11:50 Comment: So, the first 12 minutes completed.\n11:53 Comment:  Some would say still no goal from Robert Lewandowski.\n11:56 Comment:  So what's going on?\n11:59 Comment: What happened on Tuesday was incredible.\n12:3 Comment: Come to the second half and scored five goals between the 51st and 60th minutes.\n12:11 Comment: But of course you can't call it up at will.\n12:14 Comment:  That is obvious.\n12:15 Comment: And Loris Karius, the Mainz shot man, also showed a bit of self-confidence.\n12:20 Comment: Before this game he said Lewandowski wouldn't score five goals against me.\n12:26 Comment: Alaba.\n12:33 Comment: Thiago.\n12:35 Comment:  Have a look.\n12:39 Comment: Now he has a bit of room to run, but then he gets stuck.\n12:46 Comment: Well done by De Blasis.\n12:48 Comment: Bengtsson.\n12:50 Comment: Baumgartlinger.\n12:55 Comment: Hungry, well taken care of by the hosts.\n13:15 Comment: Goal, goal, goal.\n13:46 Comment: Here we see again how Mainz likes to form 4-4-2 when they don't have the ball.\n13:53 Comment: In front Muthu and Maly, who are attacking Bayern in their own half as much as possible.\n14:0 Comment: It's worked quite well so far.\n14:2 Comment: And if Bayern lose the ball, why not?\n14:4 Comment: Danny Latsa.\n14:6 Comment: Latsa around two, then have to wait.\n14:9 Comment: There are two in the middle and then Alaba loses his calm with the back pass to Manuel Neuer.\n14:15 Comment: Miller.\n14:28 Comment: So, Douglas Costa against Brozinski again, the Brazilian comes over.\n14:33 Comment: Lewandowski was lurking in the middle, but Bungert had good positional play.\n14:46 Comment: Xabi Alonso, Costa again.\n14:56 Comment:  Maly, Baumgartlinger, then Alaba will get there faster than Muthu.\n15:1 Comment: It's obviously extremely difficult to get possession of the ball against Bayern and\n15:7 Comment: then combine them across two or three stations, perhaps create oneself\n15:11 Comment:  work out.\n15:13 Comment: Baumgartlinger.\n15:16 Comment: It's too steep for the bubble, it's not a problem for Philipp Lahm.\n15:41 Comment: Baumgartlinger is playing his 100th Bundesliga game today, the captain of Mainz.\n16:12 Comment: Now there's a bit of space for Rafinha, Lewandowski and then offside\n16:20 Comment: from Costa.\n16:22 Comment: Front of the Wizard Tree.\n16:26 Comment: So far they've done reasonably well at the back.\n16:31 Comment: But now it's a little difficult because they're both so far away.\n16:35 Comment: The Wizard's Tree.\n16:38 Comment: So far they've got things under control at the back with Mainz.\n16:44 Comment: The offside position was also correctly identified.\n16:47 Comment: And the whistle against Klaas Costa, who we see in action again here.\n16:52 Comment: Duel against Kusinski in Brazilian style.\n16:56 Comment: That's also nominated for the Brazilians' next international matches.\n17:5 Comment: The international break next week, the Seleção will play against Chile and Venezuela.\n17:14 Comment: While we're on the subject.\n17:16 Comment: Rafinha also received an invitation.\n17:20 Comment: Today's FC Bayern left full-back from his national coach Carlos Lugar\n17:27 Comment: Will stay at home though because he said I'm in the position at the moment\n17:33 Comment: And by that I mean his regular position as right-back, not the first option.\n17:39 Comment: He only has two international matches under his belt anyway and has waived it.\n17:45 Comment: Alaba's mistake, it could be expensive.\n17:49 Comment: Then the pass doesn't come through from Younes Mali, as Mainz would have imagined.\n17:55 Comment: But then Thiago is fouled and that's why the hosts get a free kick.\n18:5 Comment: Yes, undisputed.\n18:20 Comment: Javi Martinez is getting there.\n18:27 Comment: Free kick came from Christian Clemens.\n18:30 Comment: Javi Martinez in Bayern's starting lineup for the first time since May.\n18:35 Comment: Torn cruciate ligament in August 2014, then he had to take a long break.\n18:40 Comment: At the end of last season, a short stint in the Champions League, the Bundesliga game in Leverkusen.\n18:45 Comment: Now he had a few problems with his vision and after two substitutions he was back in the starting line-up for the first time.\n19:16 Comment: So, a quick first statistical interim conclusion: Bayern had 73% possession of the ball in the first 20 minutes.\n19:26 Comment: And what is Robert Lewandowski doing? He has had four ball actions so far, the fewest on the pitch.\n19:32 Comment: Maybe that will change immediately because Coman comes and then Blasus comes and there is a penalty for FC Bayern Munich in the 20th minute of the game.\n19:42 Comment: There are no protests from the people of Mainz and I think that is undisputed.\n19:48 Comment: Here we see again, here comes Blasus, takes the 19-year-old Frenchman off his feet.\n19:53 Comment: To be on the safe side, let's take another look from a different angle.\n19:56 Comment: No, there's no discussion about that. A justified decision.\n20:1 Comment: And of course Müller again, he has already scored two penalties for Bayern in the Bundesliga this season.\n20:8 Comment: And now? Not! Not now!\n20:15 Comment: Thomas Müller misses and can't take advantage of Bayern's great opportunity to take a 1-0 lead here.\n20:26 Comment: After this foul from de Blasis on Coman and then Thomas Müller falls a little too far behind.\n20:35 Comment: And that was it. Only the second penalty out of a total of twelve in the Bundesliga that Müller missed.\n20:43 Comment: And you saw Pep Guardiola's reaction.\n20:47 Comment: Yes, and it's still 0-0. Why shouldn't Bayern miss a penalty?\n21:7 Comment: Arjen Robben was also on the penalty spot in the home game against Leverkusen this season, but he is out due to injury.\n21:13 Comment: Müller has actually converted both safely this season, both against Leverkusen and against Augsburg. Not today.\n21:43 Comment: So Bayern with the next attack, but Rafinha doesn't manage to stop the ball from crossing the touchline.\n21:59 Comment: Let's see who will be stopped tonight or not in Formula 1.\n22:4 Comment: Live on Sky, the Japanese Grand Prix. Tomorrow morning from 5:30 a.m. on Sky Sport HD1.\n22:14 Comment: Dear spectators, by the way, Nico Rosberg took pole position for this race.\n22:22 Comment: So the race tomorrow morning from 5.30 a.m. on Sky Sport HD1, the Japanese Grand Prix.\n22:27 Comment: Formula 1 live on Sky.\n22:41 Comment: Long ball from Xabi Alonso, almost centimeters right at Costa. Still Costa, then Thiago.\n22:49 Comment: Xabi Alonso, the Spaniard's next good pass was also fouled during the pass.\n22:57 Comment: Thank God, we waited briefly to see whether Bayern would retain possession of the ball after the foul.\n23:3 Comment: And when this question was answered in the negative, then the free kick whistle was blown in favor of FC Bayern, everything was fine.\n23:8 Comment: Stepped on foot by Danny Latsan.\n23:19 Comment: Bayern have already had a free kick from a similar position.\n23:23 Comment: We remember the variant when Thiago didn't lay the ball down, but instead lobbed it into the penalty area, into the path of Thomas Müller.\n23:30 Comment: Let's see what Bayern do now. Thiago stays away, speaks for a direct shot from Alaba or Xabi Alonso.\n23:39 Comment: First ror and no problem for Carrios.\n23:48 Comment: Five, four, three, two, one, goal.\n24:19 Comment: Alaba, only a little bit on the first matchday against HSV, acted as a left full-back, otherwise always at the back in the center of defense.\n24:31 Comment: And it's doing excellently so far.\n24:36 Comment: Already highly focused by his coach, Pep Guardiola.\n24:40 Comment: Mainz still have enough to do in defense without any offensive actions.\n24:48 Comment: Baumgartlinger vs. Xabi Alonso.\n24:54 Comment: One wants the corner, the other doesn't.\n24:59 Comment: Baumgartlinger managed to leave it to a throw-in for Bayern.\n25:4 Comment: Xabi Martinez.\n25:14 Comment: No handball, says Dankert, he was ten meters away and had a clear view.\n25:19 Comment: Costa, Coman, who took the penalty.\n25:26 Comment: And Bengtsson.\n25:33 Comment: It continues to work.\n25:57 Comment: Thiago.\n25:59 Comment: No foul this time, says Dankert.\n26:1 Comment: A counter opportunity for Mainz.\n26:5 Comment: Mutu then immediately lost the ball again.\n26:8 Comment: And then there's Xabi Alonso's foul against Blasis.\n26:21 Comment: And there is the first yellow card of this game,\n26:24 Comment: which has so far been conducted fairly on both sides.\n26:30 Comment: Yes, he hit the ball too.\n26:33 Comment: Xabi Alonso, but the emphasis is more on also.\n26:39 Comment: Of course he's been there long enough, he knows that it doesn't work that way.\n26:43 Comment: Second yellow card this season for the Spaniard.\n27:0 Comment: Now Blasis.\n27:3 Comment: Thiago isn't doing very well, he's a big deal for Mutu.\n27:9 Comment: Wow, that was Mainz's first chance, 28th minute.\n27:16 Comment: It didn't look that dangerous at first, but suddenly Blasis got possession of the ball\n27:21 Comment: And the Japanese, yes I don't want to say mother souls, but no, that's almost accurate.\n27:26 Comment: So now things are a little more unusual on the pitch.\n27:29 Comment: First yellow card just for Xabi Alonso.\n27:34 Comment: Two Bavarians are lying on the ground.\n27:37 Comment: Müller is standing again, yellow for Bungert.\n27:41 Comment: We'll take another look at the chance for Mutu after Blasis' preparatory work.\n27:47 Comment: So, now Müller unintentionally, I would say, gets his elbow from Baumgartlinger.\n27:53 Comment: For me, that wasn't an active movement by the Austrians.\n28:0 Comment: Now he's trying to explain to Robert Lewandowski again that he didn't intend the whole thing that way.\n28:5 Comment: But Müller got a bit of a hit.\n28:24 Comment: So, the accidental elbow thing.\n28:29 Comment: Then, I'll say thank you, you saw it a little differently.\n28:32 Comment: Baumgartlinger got the yellow card.\n28:34 Comment: The captain of FSV Mainz 05.\n28:38 Comment: Always on your feet, that's the most important thing.\n28:44 Comment: We lie relatively quietly, for the first 25 minutes.\n28:48 Comment: Now the first two cards, within a short time, for Xabian and so on and for Baumgartlinger.\n29:2 Comment: The bubble is the last one left with the ball.\n29:6 Comment: At least that's how the assistant saw it, Markus Hecker.\n29:18 Comment: Theodor Kosta.\n29:32 Comment: Start from Brzezinski.\n29:37 Comment: Muto, the Japanese who had the huge chance.\n29:42 Comment: After half an hour you can say that Bayern obviously have clear advantages in almost all important areas.\n29:49 Comment: Get the opponent under control, make the game, more shares in the game, significantly more ball actions and so on and so forth.\n29:57 Comment: But if you like, after clear chances to score, it's more or less even.\n30:2 Comment: On the one hand, of course, Thomas Müller had the greatness with the foul F-Meter in the 20th minute, which he put over the goal.\n30:10 Comment: But I'll say that it was at least half a penalty.\n30:14 Comment: On the other hand, Yoshinori Muto had a shot just wide of Manuel Neuer's goal in the 25th minute after some nice preparatory work by de Blasis when he was free.\n30:26 Comment: Alaba.\n30:40 Comment: Then there was Dankott's admonition for Alaba, who had previously had a little conversation and wanted assistants.\n30:53 Comment: Leave him alone.\n30:56 Comment: Reluctantly.\n31:9 Comment: Lanza.\n31:19 Comment: Against Lewandowski.\n31:23 Comment: No chances to score for Robert Lewandowski yet.\n31:32 Comment: Lanza, Rafinha, a litter mine.\n31:40 Comment: And then the Lanza from the devil Buchum came at the beginning of the season.\n31:59 Comment: Alaba, we lost the header duel there, but there is no Mainz player who could have made life difficult for Manuel Neuer.\n32:39 Comment: Lewandowski a bit withdrawn, a kind of hanging tip.\n32:44 Comment: Thomas Müller is now the one who is at the forefront at Bayern.\n32:51 Comment: Try something different.\n32:53 Comment: We know that from Petraniola, when things don't go quite right, he tries out a lot of things.\n33:1 Comment: The opponent then has as many problems as possible adjusting to new variants and new constellations.\n33:8 Comment: Now Baumgartlinger has a good eye, there is an opportunity for Mainz.\n33:13 Comment: Clemens slides in, Rafinha prevails and that's Douglas Costa and Carios.\n33:21 Comment: But there was a hiss when the Brazilian shot, 34th minute, full shot from 25 meters away from the goal.\n33:29 Comment: Carios flies and Carios holds.\n33:37 Comment: Once kept clean sheet this season, Loures Carios in the 3-0 home win against Hannover 96.\n33:51 Comment:  Corner for Bayern, Xabi Alonso.\n33:58 Comment:  Baumgartlinger missed, Lahm.\n34:21 Comment: Mainz are still doing it really well, defensive behavior is moving well, not giving Bayern so much breathing space.\n34:28 Comment: Of course there's a lot of legwork involved.\n34:31 Comment: We'll have to see how long it works like this at the end of an English week.\n34:37 Comment: Now Costa comes over to the right side, he's now also on the left side.\n34:42 Comment: And then there are two people from Mainz who are a big hindrance.\n34:47 Comment: There is no chance for Munich to score, only a goal kick from Carios,\n34:54 Comment: Who didn't have to intervene here in the 20th minute when Thomas Müller's VfL meter.\n34:59 Comment: And you have the reaction of Carios, who didn't have to intervene here, in the 20th minute.\n35:7 Comment: Got a bit too far behind, it wasn't in the penalty spot.\n35:12 Comment: And then again the shot from Douglas Costa and Carios with the land launch.\n35:23 Comment: Mainz is coming, if Blasius gets there, he can't make it, but he's still on the ball.\n35:28 Comment: New one outside, now the ball again, the ball is there, the ball is there, the ball is there.\n35:33 Comment: But Neuer is still on the ball, Neuer is out, now back in goal. Müller is still there too.\n35:41 Comment: Bark hits.\n35:47 Comment: Now Lewandowski follows up, but Carios is more on the ball.\n35:54 Comment: Koman, Thiago, pass from Kixi Koman.\n36:14 Comment: And Mainz still hold the goalless draw, even after a good 36 minutes.\n36:21 Comment: But it's nothing unusual this season that Munich have a harder time in the first half.\n36:26 Comment: Goal difference before the break 4:3, in the second half 16:0 in favor of Bayern.\n36:34 Comment: So they often do it like they did on Tuesday against Wolfsburg.\n36:38 Comment: They were still 0-1 behind at halftime.\n36:42 Comment: And in the end, after the Lewandowski gala, the Kanter victory for the German record champions.\n37:21 Comment: Brusinski takes his time and then decides on the safety option.\n37:26 Comment: The Mainz team is playing around at the back for now.\n37:34 Comment: Back for Beckson.\n37:36 Comment: Anyway, applause from Martin Schmidt, who has been looking after Mainz since February of this year.\n37:45 Comment: As the successor to Jesper Hühlmann, the Dane.\n37:50 Comment: His record was balanced last season.\n37:53 Comment: Five wins, three draws, five defeats.\n37:55 Comment: But things are looking good for Mainz this season.\n37:58 Comment: Nine points from the first six games, even there again.\n38:2 Comment: Mainz haven't played three wins, three defeats and a draw at all in the current season.\n38:16 Comment: Müller loses the ball.\n38:23 Comment: The Blases, Javi Martinez.\n38:45 Comment:  Thomas Müller.\n39:11 Comment: Lewandowski, 20 meters.\n39:14 Comment: Indicates there was another one, must give a corner.\n39:17 Comment: Bastian Dankert indicates that there is no corner kick, there is a goal kick.\n39:21 Comment: Maybe we can take another look at it now.\n39:23 Comment: I think Dankert is right, just past Mainz, but no longer touched.\n39:27 Comment: And that makes it the right decision.\n39:29 Comment: So, another little statistical interim conclusion.\n39:32 Comment: Five minutes before break.\n39:34 Comment: The Mainz team has run a total of three kilometers more than the Munich team.\n39:39 Comment: That obviously shows the way the 05ers defend.\n39:43 Comment: It's a lot of walking, but it requires you to like.\n39:46 Comment: Müller's shot, no problem, the ball didn't leak.\n39:49 Comment: The ball didn't run out, the ball didn't run out.\n40:23 Comment: It was a big quick fr говорит.\n40:26 Comment: It's too steep.\n40:50 Comment: No chance for Rafinha.\n40:52 Comment: The Brazilian also shows it, why don't you play the ball into your foot instead of like that?\n40:56 Comment: Step into the run.\n40:57 Comment: At least in the last minutes of the first half you have the feeling that the\n41:3 Comment: Mainz will do a good job.\n41:5 Comment: The longer this game goes on, the more you know what Matthias Sammer said shortly before kick-off\n41:12 Comment: was talking when he said, well, that's a difficult task.\n41:15 Comment: We know the quality of the opponent.\n41:17 Comment: How did he sketch it so beautifully.\n41:23 Comment: The Mainz team is small, fast and agile.\n41:26 Comment: Everything that the 05ers have presented here in the first half so far is honorable\n41:32 Comment:  have.\n41:33 Comment: It's too high from David Alaba.\n41:40 Comment: Sorry to the address, this time it didn't have a chance here.\n41:44 Comment: Douglas Costa.\n41:45 Comment: He's still standing there very calmly.\n41:50 Comment:  Pep Guardiola, hands in pockets.\n41:52 Comment: There's still a lot of time for Thiago.\n42:0 Comment: Substituted at half-time, he wasn't exactly happy about it after a relatively weak performance\n42:6 Comment:  Performance.\n42:7 Comment:  Thiago last Tuesday against Wolfsburg.\n42:9 Comment: Bengtsson, now he's even going forward.\n42:19 Comment: The Swedish national defender, full of blows at Xabi Alonso.\n42:24 Comment: And free kick for Bayern.\n42:39 Comment: Alert, high and far.\n43:2 Comment: New one has to come out.\n43:4 Comment: He's getting his head around it.\n43:9 Comment: On Tuesday one of Manuel Neuer's outings was almost 0-1\n43:15 Comment: times went wrong when Guillaumo G.\n43:18 Comment: Hit the outside post almost from the halfway line.\n43:21 Comment: Centres were missing, then it would have been 2-0 for Wolfsburg.\n43:25 Comment: Prelude from Daniel Kuczynski, who has his only Bundesliga goal so far for or against\n43:40 Comment: Bayern achieved.\n43:41 Comment: It was a while ago, February

Comment: And then he gets back on the scoresheet.\n34:39 Comment: He is a horse.\n34:43 Comment: But at the moment Bayern prefer to pass the ball to each other in their own half.\n34:48 Comment: Maybe now again about Lahm, about Rafinha and about Götze.\n34:52 Comment: Then Mario Götze is topped. And then Clemens is there.\n34:58 Comment: Baumgart longer.\n35:2 Comment: Yes, fairly separated from Götze by the ball. But not fairly, says Bastian Dankert.\n35:7 Comment: Götze is angry.\n35:10 Comment: The free kick for Mainz is still awarded.\n35:12 Comment: So, then there is the last substitution in this game. 81st minute.\n35:21 Comment: And it goes Christian.\n35:22 Comment: Clemens, who had the misfortune of hitting the crossbar with his shot, was close to scoring this season,\n35:28 Comment: to give Bayern their first goal against them in the second half of the Bundesliga.\n35:33 Comment: And Ballogun comes into the game in his place.\n35:38 Comment: Ballogun takes over the position of right full-back for Mainz.\n35:43 Comment: Oops, watch out Moritz.

    "summary": "Bayern Munich secured a commanding 3-0 victory over 1. FSV Mainz 05 in an intense Bundesliga matchup largely defined by Bayern's potent attack and Mainz's staunch defensive efforts. The first half saw Mainz, in their red jerseys and white pants, initially appearing well-organized against the heavyweights from Munich. Bayern, on the other hand, showcased a chain of four in their defense with Rafinha on the left, Martinez and Alaba in central roles, and the ever-steady Lahm anchoring the right side.\n\nThe early minutes were characterized by Bayern's fluid ball movement and elastic defensive arrangements. Lewandowski, seeking his 100th Bundesliga goal, and Douglas Costa, Bayern’s dynamic Brazilian winger, spearheaded the initial forays into the Mainz half. Within seconds, Bayern demonstrated their offensive intent with Thomas Müller aiming at goal, only to miss his chance early in the third minute. This set the tone for Bayern's relentless pursuit of the opening goal.\n\nMainz, despite their efforts, found it challenging to counter Bayern’s high pressing. Mainz's defense, arranged in a 4-4-2 formation, did well to absorb Bayern's relentless pressure in the initial stages. But Bayern persisted, with frantic activity down the wings from Costa and Coman, often finding space behind Mainz’s defenders. Although Bayern generated ample chances, converting them proved elusive, with Mainz's goalkeeper, Loris Karius, standing tall.\n\nBayern’s 40th corner of the season early in the half saw another golden chance for Müller, who yet again couldn’t convert. Mainz's defense, bolstered by Bell, Bungert, Brzezinski, and Bengtsson, had a strenuous day as they repeatedly stifled Bayern’s attack, even as their attacking opportunities remained sparse. Mainz's resilience was palpable as they survived Bayern's incessant attempts, including close calls where Douglas Costa, orchestrated by Xabi Alonso and Rafinha, applied severe pressure.\n\nThe tension hit its peak when Bayern was awarded a penalty in the 20th minute, as De Blasis tripped Coman in the box. Müller, confident at the spot, uncharacteristically missed, shooting over Karius’ goal. This miss visibly rattled both teams as it showcased Bayern’s offensive vulnerabilities and Mainz's defensive capability. The moment epitomized Mainz’s resolve and Bayern’s occasional struggles in penetration.\n\nHowever, as the first half wore on, Bayern's predatory instincts were on full display. Lewandowski moved into a slightly withdrawn role, creating a quintessential 'false nine' scenario, syncing beautifully with Müller’s movements upfront. Despite their lion's share of possession and territorial dominance, Bayern couldn’t break the deadlock before the interval. The half ended with Mainz earning rare offensive forays, yet Bayern's defense, led by Neuer's proactive keeping, kept them at bay.\n\nWhen the second half commenced, Bayern's consistency and superior tactical execution became blatantly clear. Mainz attempted to maintain their defensive tenacity, seeking to capitalize on quick breaks. However, it took Bayern merely six minutes after the interval to disrupt Mainz's game plan. A well-strategized move saw Kingsley Coman deliver a precise cross to Lewandowski, who confirmed his predatory prowess with a faultless header in the 51st minute. His ninth goal of the season was nothing short of spectacular, courtesy of Coman’s brilliance on the flanks.\n\nMainz, facing the stark reality of a goal down, found themselves forced to reconsider their defensive stance. The space opened up for Bayern to exploit, and their attackers danced through the newly available channels. Lewandowski wasn’t done; in the 63rd minute, he showcased once more why he’s one of the finest strikers in modern football. After a brilliant play from Vidal, Lewandowski found the net again, ensuring Bayern a more comfortable lead. While there was a fleeting question about an offside, the goal stood, and Mainz's resolve slowly began to wane.\n\nFollowing Lewandowski's brace, Bayern's manager Pep Guardiola made strategic adjustments, substituting Costa, whose flair had terrorized Mainz's defense, to introduce Mario Götze. Within minutes, the changes paid off. Douglas Costa had already provided significant impetus, aiding Kingsley Coman's further offensive endeavors. In the 68th minute, Costa darted through the Mainz defense, setting up Coman perfectly for Bayern's third goal. Simple yet effective, Coman calmly side-footed the ball, capitalizing on Costa’s apt ball placement. \n\nThis goal cemented Bayern’s submission as Mainz struggled to match the pace and intricate playmaking for the rest of the match. Moritz replaced Latsa and added steel to Mainz's defensive midfield, yet it was apparent that Bayern had the upper hand. Even Mainz's best efforts to reinvigorate their performance, including the appearances of Jairo Samperio and Christoph Moritz, couldn't muster a significant response.\n\nThe final stages witnessed Bayern’s imperious control over the possession, strategically halting any Mainz resurgence. In the dying moments, an offensive surge from Alaba prompted a corner, which Bayern played out cleverly to run down the clock. Mainz came close with Clemens hitting the crossbar, but it was a fleeting moment of hope in an otherwise one-sided affair.\n\nThis match clearly exemplified Bayern’s dominance and tactical versatility. Their ability to transition seamlessly from defense to attack and control the tempo in the face of tenacious opposition speaks volumes of their training and strategy. Mainz put forward a spirited effort, particularly in the first half, but as Bayern switched gears in the second half, they displayed why they remain at the pinnacle of German football.\n\nIn summary, the game demonstrated Bayern's attacking brilliance and depth. Lewandowski’s double underscored his remarkable finishing skills, while Coman and Costa's contributions highlighted Bayern’s prowess on the flanks. Mainz, despite their resolute defense and occasional offensive glimmers, eventually succumbed to Bayern’s relentless pursuit, proving the adage that persistent quality often overcomes resilient defense. Bayern’s 3-0 victory not only solidified their top spot in the Bundesliga but also served as a stern reminder to their competitors of their clinical efficiency and offensive depth."
