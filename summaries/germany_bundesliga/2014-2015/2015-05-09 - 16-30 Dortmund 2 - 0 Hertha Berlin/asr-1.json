the Dortmunders can do\n20:9 Comment: By changing the attacking midfield positions we can also do that.\n20:13 Comment: Haraguchi is currently on the ball for the Japanese, on the left side.\n20:18 Comment: Nico Schulz on the right.\n20:33 Comment: Where do we have a pursuit of Brooks here?\n20:37 Comment: Let's take a look at the details of Bobby Danielson\n20:40 Comment: Of course that is

Tobias Stieler was immediately off the mark.\n24:18 Comment: And the long ball to Aubameyang.\n24:20 Comment: And that was dangerous because Thomas Kraft had slipped briefly in the meantime.\n24:24 Comment: But he picks himself up again in time.\n24:27 Comment: The Keeper of the Artana.\n24:30 Comment: Otherwise, Aubameyang would have had free rein.\n24:33 Comment: And the long ball gets a thumbs up.\n25:3 Comment: And then comes Haraguchi.\n25:5 Comment: He is the first to see the yellow card this afternoon.\n25:10 Comment: And he was lucky that the whole thing was just outside the 16.\n25:14 Comment: Otherwise we would have had to talk about other stories than the free kick.\n25:18 Comment: But he hasn't said that yet either.\n25:20 Comment: And then he played the game again.\n25:32 Comment: And now the Japanese will have to talk on the free kick.\n25:34 Comment: And then he played the game again.\n25:40 Comment: But then Henrik WEGITARIAN and Tobias STILA also receive yellow cards.\n25:44 Comment: Happy birthday to Genki Haraguchi.\n25:46 Comment: He turns 24 today.\n25:48 Comment: Congratulations!\n25:50 Comment: Not for the free kick, but for the birthday.\n25:52 Comment: Now the Japanese will hope that nothing happens.\n26:2 Comment: Quick, Zaha.\n26:19 Comment: Oh, what was he planning?\n26:22 Comment: Honestly, we have to ask him after the game,\n26:25 Comment: whether that should perhaps be a shot on goal\n26:28 Comment: or whether he wanted to flank.\n26:32 Comment: Here again, yes, actually there should have been a free kick for Hertha BSC,\n26:36 Comment: before this quick counterattack by Dortmund developed,\n26:41 Comment: when Kraft then got the better of Aubameyang.\n27:2 Comment: Campel.\n27:16 Comment: That is, of course, what Dortmund are waiting for now.\n27:19 Comment: Ball losses by Aterna, who need to open up a bit\n27:22 Comment: and then quick counterattacks.\n27:29 Comment: Langkamp tries a long ball,\n27:31 Comment: but much too fast.\n27:32 Comment: This is a very good ball.\n27:32 Comment: Too long for Nico Schulz.\n28:2 Comment: Game is lagging a bit now.\n28:5 Comment: After about half an hour,\n28:7 Comment: because Dortmund, whether the 1 to 0 lead is not ready,\n28:11 Comment: to take big risks here.\n28:13 Comment: The Aterna are asked what to do about the backlog.\n28:16 Comment: The Berliners have come up with very little so far.\n28:19 Comment: No scoring opportunities yet for Paldaday’s team.\n28:24 Comment: Dortmund are waiting for counterattack situations,\n28:26 Comment: to maybe make it 2-0.\n28:29 Comment: This is how the game looks at the moment.\n28:32 Comment: But then Paldaday comes in포iert\n28:33 Comment: and Bale consulted you.\n28:35 Comment: A controversial purchase\n28:36 Comment: M decades of culture,\n28:37 Comment: FPV and 觀眾ae\n28:45 Comment: in始land serves Border iOS supernatural cinema Service,\n28:48 Comment: it is an EU nation 폭

situations that Dortmund are waiting for.\n29:6 Comment: Gundogan.\n29:9 Comment: Ball was played.\n29:12 Comment: That is why there is no such thing as the one from some fans here\n29:15 Comment: requested free kick.\n29:18 Comment: They saw a foul on Nkai Gündogan.\n29:21 Comment: But the ball is already being played by Sebastian Langkamp.\n29:25 Comment: Ah, Gucsi.\n29:31 Comment: Play forward at Hertha.\n29:34 Comment: Also too imprecise.\n29:37 Comment: The passports don't arrive.\n29:40 Comment: This applies to the longer ones anyway.\n29:43 Comment: But I can also remember a relatively fluid combination in the short passing game.\n29:46 Comment: Everywhere.\n29:49 Comment: This is a very good ball.\n29:55 Comment: It's a very good ball.\n29:58 Comment: This is a very good ball.\n30:1 Comment: But the ball doesn't arrive.\n30:4 Comment: This is a very good ball.\n30:10 Comment: But also near Dortmund.\n30:13 Comment: That's all after 30 minutes.\n30:16 Comment: And there was the defense optimized under Pall-Dardai\n30:19 Comment: the Berliner addressed.\n30:22 Comment: As far as scoring goals goes,\n30:24 Comment: This is the right place for FC Bayern member Peter Pekarek.\n30:30 Comment: Schilz.\n30:37 Comment: And the guitar.\n30:40 Comment: Have to wait first,\n30:43 Comment: until one or another colleague has moved up,\n30:46 Comment: for example Eric Dogen.\n31:22 Comment: Valentin Stocker gets to the ball but cannot control it.\n31:27 Comment: But these are of course the mistakes that Dortmund should avoid in their opinion.\n31:34 Comment: So, now let’s play forward quickly.\n31:35 Comment: Rook on Mkhitaryan against Lustenberger.\n31:38 Comment: And that’s another corner for Borussia Dortmund.\n31:43 Comment: And both corners that we have seen so far from the Black and Yellows have been extremely dangerous.\n31:47 Comment: The second led to the only goal so far by Neven Subotic.\n31:52 Comment: So, of course, both centre-backs are back up front.\n32:2 Comment: Hummels and the goalscorer.\n32:6 Comment: And Mkhitaryan gives him the ball again.\n32:11 Comment: This time they paid a little more attention and he, Thomas Kraft, cleared up the last ambiguities.\n32:22 Comment: Everyone followed!\n32:40 Comment: So we see Hertha, despite the deficit, still largely in a wait-and-see position.\n32:48 Comment: You let the Dortmund players play in their own half, no aggressive pressing.\n32:52 Comment: That's a good ball.\n32:58 Comment: He wants to lure BVB out of their own half.\n33:3 Comment: Please.\n33:5 Comment: But too imprecise.\n33:22 Comment: Please.\n33:30 Comment: A victory today.\n33:34 Comment: Then Borussia Dortmund would certainly be in the Bundesliga\n33:39 Comment: continue in business.\n33:43 Comment: As for qualifying for the Europa League.\n33:47 Comment: Dortmunders already know\n33:49 Comment: if they lose the cup final,\n33:51 Comment: In the end it serves as the cup final for them.\n33:54 Comment: For me too.\n34:9 Comment: More and more is happening on the side,\n34:11 Comment: zuoy processing is not MalherzACTailed,\n34:13 Comment: the cup winner tra LowerEarth via dieammed\n34:15 Comment: the cup winners met LowerEarth via the Turkman League.\n34:19 Comment: ...\n34:20 Comment: But if you know where Dortmund come from, they were second to last in the table during the winter break, and even eighteenth after the 19th matchday.\n34:32 Comment: I think everyone would have signed back then if they had been told that they would still be playing for the Europa League.\n34:40 Comment: So, now there is a yellow card for Sebastian Kehl, who is suggesting that it is not his fault.\n34:49 Comment: Kehl only looks at the ball, but then raises his arm, hits his opponent and Tobias Stieler judges this to be a clear foul.\n34:57 Comment: So after Haraguchi on the other side, now Kehl is the second yellow card offender today.\n35:4 Comment: Jürgen Klopp also says that it wasn't a yellow card, he didn't even hit him properly, he didn't want to go at his opponent, he was looking towards the ball.\n35:16 Comment: And Sebastian Kehl is actually...\n35:19 Comment: He is also known as an extremely fair player.\n35:22 Comment: So Mkhitaryan indicated how the ball should come and Subotic then knew what to do.\n35:28 Comment: Ninth minute, 1-0, cheers in the stands and from coach Subotic, a specialist in such situations, who has scored 15 Bundesliga goals in total.\n35:43 Comment: All according to standards.\n35:46 Comment: Eleven times in the corner, four times after...\n35:49 Comment: Free kick.\n35:53 Comment: That will happen at some point, when word gets around about the Bundesliga, as is well known.\n36:6 Comment: Mkhitaryan, pursued by Haraguchi.\n36:8 Comment: Yes, it wasn't a bad idea from Gündogan for...\n36:19 Comment: Schmelzer and now the counterattack opportunity for Hertha BSC.\n36:23 Comment: Two against two, if it goes quickly, but of course the ball has to be more accurate.\n36:37 Comment: No problem for Mitch Lengerick, who has had an extremely green afternoon so far.\n36:43 Comment: It was actually a good chance for the ball to be chipped, which still needed to be treated after Kehl's action.\n36:48 Comment: He then did exactly...\n36:48 Comment: At exactly the right moment, with the referee's permission of course, back on the pitch to initiate the counterattack.\n36:56 Comment: But played without concentration.\n36:58 Comment: Once distracted.\n37:20 Comment: tower,مر Pin ض�\n37:45 Comment: Who300\n37:47 Comment: turbine\n37:48 Comment: 1955\n37:48 Comment: Japanese Huge Game vs. generic sports revelations\n37:48 Comment: missing in alberschritz langkamp against vegetarians advantage\n37:56 Comment: well done

the short head up then sees the\n38:15 Comment: colleague hobbels does not bring the ball out of the danger zone stocker is then perhaps a\n38:20 Comment: I was a bit surprised that he even managed to score a goal. The Swiss national player\n38:25 Comment: who has scored three of the last four tough goals with the first opportunity ever for the\n38:30 Comment: baldada team\n38:42 Comment: maybe that will give you a little courage\n38:45 Comment: for the Berliners who otherwise\n38:50 Comment: we say we haven't found a key yet to get into the door at the Dortmund penalty area\n39:12 Comment: Schulz was already in the side house and gave a throw-in\n39:15 Comment: black yellow\n39:35 Comment: always the same picture there when in possession of the ball Hertha is deep in their own half\n39:45 Comment: Growal\n40:2 Comment: barack evening\n40:6 Comment: Council\n40:14 Comment: And then Sebastian Langkamp is hit from close range.\n40:24 Comment: That hurts and he's left breathless.\n40:27 Comment: And that's why Tobias Stieler did the only right thing and interrupted the encounter.\n40:34 Comment: Yes, there is no question that Dortmund's lead just five minutes before the end of the first

that Tobias Stieler says, yes, he hit the nail on the head again with the offside decision.\n23:8 Comment: Patrick Ittrich, so hurt that referee Tobias Stieler calls the Dortmund coaches onto the pitch.\n23:14 Comment: But he himself put in a pretty good performance against Wolfsburg.\n23:17 Comment: Valentin Stocker and then unfortunately fell.\n23:20 Comment: Eric Durm.\n23:26 Comment: However, Jürgen Klopp would still have two options on the bench for his position as right-back.\n23:34 Comment: Lukas Piszczek is back in the squad for the second time after a long injury.\n23:38 Comment: Socrates, the Greek national player, has also played this game several times.\n23:43 Comment: But of course let us first hope that Erik Durm can continue.\n23:46 Comment: But I have to

Dardai.\n23:56 Comment: And he still smiles a little bit.\n24:0 Comment: Otherwise, one has to be honest and say that it doesn't really look like that even after 69 minutes.\n24:7 Comment: As if Hertha BSC could still take something tangible away from here today.\n24:10 Comment: But you never know.\n24:12 Comment: Berlin have had three ball actions in Dortmund so far.\n24:17 Comment: And that was the first time they did it so well.\n24:21 Comment: Two times Stocker, once Pekarik.\n24:24 Comment: And at the end the Swiss only came once.\n24:33 Comment: So, now Kagawa has his head up, Kampel

Gündogan, Schmelzer, three-man header relay.\n25:30 Comment: And then Lustenberger simply pushes the thing forward.\n25:35 Comment: And Schulz tries.\n25:38 Comment: Nico Schulz, it stays that way.\n25:45 Comment: Hertha, you could almost say that now.\n25:47 Comment: He has the thing.\n25:47 Comment: He is harmless in the offensive.\n25:51 Comment: So, there is the second change at Borussia Dortmund.\n25:55 Comment: But it is not the injured Erik Dom who goes out, but Marcel Schmelzer, the left full-back.\n26:4 Comment: For him the game is over after 72 minutes.\n26:8 Comment: He will be missed.\n26:10 Comment: In lower number 29 Marcel.\n26:13 Comment: Not very conspicuous, but he didn't let anything go wrong on defense either.\n26:17 Comment: And he does it.\n26:17

    "summary": "On an overcast day in Dortmund, the iconic Signal Iduna Park was the backdrop to a crucial Bundesliga clash where Borussia Dortmund hosted Hertha BSC. The stakes were high for both teams; Dortmund aimed to consolidate their push for European qualification, while the visitors sought essential points to stave off relegation threats.\n\nAs the whistle blew to commence the first half, the match immediately took off with intensity, mirroring the tense atmosphere in the stands. The initial moments focused on Dortmund dominating possession and orchestrating their play from the midfield. Dortmund, playing traditionally in their black and yellow kits, were pushing Hertha back right from the start. Early comments indicated that several players, including Henrik Mkhitaryan and Kevin Kampl, had shuffled their positions to maximize the offensive potential.\n\nIn the seventh minute, Dortmund hinted at their strategy, aiming to control the game's flow and leverage their midfield strength. Jürgen Klopp's pre-match comments revealed an understanding of Hertha's defensive resilience, spearheaded by their solid backline that conceded only ten goals in twelve games under their coach, Pal Dardai. The disciplined defense meant Dortmund had to be meticulous in their build-ups.\n\nIt wasn't long before Dortmund translated their dominance into an early lead. In just the ninth minute, after a cleverly executed corner by Mkhitaryan, defender Neven Subotic was given ample space to power a header past Hertha's keeper Thomas Kraft. The mistake lay in Hertha's defensive organization, leaving Subotic unmarked, and he capitalized without hesitation. This goal marked Subotic's second of the season, echoing his previous header against Mainz.\n\nHertha BSC, somewhat stunned by the early goal, tried to regain composure. The visitors were without their primary scorer Julian Schieber, who was sidelined due to a knee surgery, thus thrusting other forwards into the spotlight. Yet, the subsequent minutes saw a lack of clear offensive threat from Berlin. Instead, the sporadic attempts to counter by Hertha failed to trouble Mitch Langerak, Dortmund's relatively idle goalkeeper in the first half.\n\nDespite their defensive lapses, Hertha did manage to carve out an opportunity at the 38th minute. A well-coordinated play involved Nico Schulz and Peter Pekarik, culminating in a shot on goal by Valentin Stocker. It was a rare chance, and although Stocker’s effort didn’t find the net, it signaled Hertha's intent to fight back. Yet, the moments of offensive brilliance were fleeting, as Dortmund resumed control.\n\nDortmund's defensive composure under Klopp's guidance meant that Hertha had little room to maneuver. By halftime, the hosts remained 1-0 up, a lead that appeared comfortable but slender enough to demand caution. The second half carried the potential for shifts, with both sides having plenty to play for.\n\nThe restart saw Dortmund assert their command decisively. Barely 80 seconds into the second half, Erik Durm, lurking on the right flank, found himself with ample space. A swift interplay initiated by Mkhitaryan allowed Durm to unleash a precise left-footed shot beyond Kraft's reach. Credit went to Mkhitaryan again, who, besides setting up the first goal, now provided the assist for a maiden Bundesliga goal for Durm. The score now read 2-0, intensifying Hertha's predicament.\n\nThe second goal underscored Dortmund's strategy of exploiting any lapses in Hertha's defensive transitions. With Hertha needing to push forward more aggressively, gaps appeared, and Dortmund's swift counter-attacks became a recurrent theme. Ilkay Gündogan and Shinji Kagawa consistently tested Hertha's resolve, probing their defense with intelligent ball distribution and timely runs.\n\nAs Dortmund smelled blood, they didn't relent. Aubameyang, the dynamic forward, continued to torment Hertha's backline. His pace caused panic, and his attempts on goal necessitated constant vigilance from Kraft. Although Aubameyang did not find the net himself today, his energy and movement created openings for his teammates.\n\nDortmund made their first substitution in the 66th minute, bringing on Ciro Immobile for Aubameyang. Immobile, the Italian striker, entered the fray, eager to etch his name onto the scoresheet. Immediately, his presence was felt as he linked up effectively with Kagawa and Kampl. Hertha, on the other hand, introduced Johnny Heitinga to fortify their defense following Brooks's unfortunate injury.\n\nThe game's physicality was highlighted by multiple cautions. Yellow cards were issued to Haraguchi, Schellbrett, and Berlin's captain Lustenberger, reflecting the desperation and intensity Hertha brought to their effort to claw back into the game. Dortmund's Gündogan and Mkhitaryan were also not spared as tempers flared occasionally, owing to the high stakes.\n\nHertha saw flashes of a comeback through their sporadic forays into Dortmund's half. Stocker and substitute Sandro Wagner tried to wrest control and create chances. Wagner’s header, set up beautifully by Stocker, was among their best opportunities but ultimately failed to beat Langerak. Similarly, Ronny's introduction brought a fresh spark, but it was too little, too late.\n\nDortmund retained their steely composure, managing play smartly as the minutes ticked by. The midfield pivot of Gündogan and Kampl ensured no slip-ups, keeping Hertha at bay effectively. As the rain intermittently fell on the Signal Iduna Park, the damp conditions mirrored Hertha's fading hopes.\n\nWith the clock winding down, Hertha's arduous attempts to mount a significant comeback continually fizzled out into unorganized spurts of possession. Stocker’s offside moments, coupled with Wagner's clumsy finishing, epitomized their afternoon. On the defensive end, Kraft’s valiant saves ensured that the scoreline didn’t balloon to an embarrassing figure.\n\nIn the end, Dortmund clinched a deserved 2-0 victory—an essential win tightening their grip on a spot for Europa League qualification. Hertha’s late-game efforts painted a picture of determination but also revealed a lack of finishing finesse needed to overturn Dortmund’s advantage.\n\nFor the Dortmund faithful, this victory extended their unbeaten streak at home to three games and offered a semblance of redemption in an otherwise turbulent season. As the players made their way off the pitch, the resounding cheers from the Yellow Wall encapsulated a day where Dortmund outclassed and outmaneuvered their opponents tactically and mentally.\n\nJürgen Klopp, overseeing his penultimate home game, could take pride in how his team executed the game plan to perfection—leveraging early set-pieces, maintaining defensive stability, and pressing forward with disciplined alacrity. For Hertha, the road ahead posed significant challenges, demanding introspection and a swift recalibration to avoid relegation woes as the season neared its climax."
