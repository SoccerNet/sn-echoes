It is not yet clear whether he will be able to travel to Munich on Tuesday.\n8:46 Comment: However, it seems relaxed. It seems to be a muscular story,\n8:52 Comment: But Mitch Langerak will probably be Borussia Dortmund's number 1 in the cup at the Allianz Arena on Tuesday anyway.\n9:0 Comment: As always in this and the previous cup season.\n9:6 Comment: Free kick Moschekowski.

One for Trapp, one for Trapp.\n16:35 Comment: It stays on the line and Aubameyang has the first chance for BVB after 17 minutes.\n16:42 Comment: No pressure on Wasikowski, who is allowed to cross and then the ball is three meters away from Trapp.\n16:47 Comment: Certainly a difficult ball for the goalkeeper, but it really has to come.\n17:2 Comment: Wasikowski.\n17:21 Comment: We see this very clearly with many duels won in the center.\n17:24 Comment: Chic from Seferovic to Valdes.\n17:27 Comment: Ex-Borusse.

middle.\n20:8 Comment: Clearly too high.\n20:17 Comment: Very good ball control from Kittel, but then a bit too inaccurate for Medojewic.\n20:24 Comment: Ah, Matlum and Zambrano.\n20:28 Comment: There still needs to be some fine-tuning between the two central defenders.\n20:32 Comment: Inioski.\n20:54 Comment: Seferovic.\n20:56 Comment: With the mistake Kagawa.\n20:58 Comment: Where is

again.\n21:22 Comment: You have been in Cottbus for 20 years.\n21:23 Comment: Dortmund tries to get into the duels early.\n21:26 Comment: But Frankfurt always manages to use up all the trains.\n21:27 Comment: But Frankfurt always manages to free itself from the predicament with playful methods.\n21:36 Comment: And Hasebe is very, very noticeable, very present there in the center.\n21:47 Comment: Error in Schikowski, Pierson.\n21:52 Comment: Involuntarily by Dom for Kittel.\n21:57 Comment: And coats.\n22:9 Comment: Medojevic.\n22:11 Comment: Chandler breaks free, Medojevic saw it, but the pass was unsuitable for Timothy Chandler.\n22:27 Comment: Kagawa-san.\n22:50 Comment: Difficult against Hasebe, well resolved because he saw Schmelzer spit on the left.\n22:55 Comment: Kagawa tries.\n22:57 Comment: And include the game.\n23:0 Comment: Now there is, what is there now?\n23:4 Comment: Did he have his hand on the ball?\n23:6 Comment: Then there is a penalty for Borussia Dortmund.\n23:10 Comment: Here we see it again.\n23:12 Comment: Yes.\n23:14 Comment: coat.\n23:15 Comment: The arm has no place there.\n23:17 Comment: And that brings us to all the common parameters.\n23:21 Comment: Unnatural hand movement, body surface enlargement barely visible.\n23:24 Comment: And Michael Weiner reacted immediately.\n23:27 Comment: Handball penalty for Borussia Dortmund.\n23:29 Comment: A justified decision.\n23:31 Comment: And Aubameyang has the chance to make it 1-0 for BVB.\n23:37 Comment: A prank by Carlos Zambrano.\n23:47 Comment: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang against Trapp.\n23:55

Comment: Of course you look miserable.\n24:26 Comment: As a shooter when the goalkeeper stops.\n24:28 Comment: But on the other hand, I don't know any goalkeeper who would have the nerve to just stand still during a penalty like that.\n24:37 Comment: In principle, you have to choose a side.\n24:40 Comment: In this case, Kevin Trapp does the same.\n24:42 Comment: But an incredibly cheeky penalty from the national player from Gabon.\n24:49 Comment: 1 to 0 for Borussia Dortmund.\n24:56 Comment: The\n25:0 Comment: So Kittel is very eye-catching.\n25:1 Comment: In this initial phase he was able to perform one or two tricks.\n25:6 Comment: However, the handball penalty was caused at short notice.\n25:9 Comment: Now he gets the yellow card.\n25:12 Comment: Basically, he was lucky that he didn't get a yellow card for his handball in the 16-yard box.\n25:17 Comment: Otherwise it would have been a very, very quick yellow-red card.\n25:21 Comment: But they wouldn’t be able to afford too much anymore.\n25:23 Comment: Sonny Kittel.\n25:26 Comment: Music\n25:56 Comment: Schmelzer, Chandler in front of Cargava.\n26:8 Comment: There is a lot of clearing going on in the centre now.\n26:11 Comment: Before Kittel, now Bender.\n26:16 Comment: Against Hasebe from behind, too late.\n26:19 Comment: For me, this too deserves a yellow rating.\n26:26 Comment: This is a good ball for me too.\n26:41 Comment: Similar to Frankfurt, BVB also plays against the ball.\n26:45 Comment: With 2 chains of four.\n26:47 Comment: Cargava and Aubameyang are disruptive up front.\n26:52 Comment: Chandler vs Mkhitaryan.\n26:56 Comment: Zambrano may not have the necessary timing yet.\n27:0 Comment: After this week-long break due to injury.\n27:4 Comment: After a torn muscle in the right thigh.\n27:26 Comment: FC Mönchengladbach in the daughter at the protectionsb把sch.\n27:29 Comment: Inside here exposed Cheers PLs.\n27:31 Comment: Hebassipe avoided from the crossed th ironic the

from Kagawa out to Dom.\n28:5 Comment: Need support now, no one is short-changed.\n28:8 Comment: Against 2 prevails against Medojevic.\n28:10 Comment: Actually, it was already over.\n28:12 Comment: And at this moment he doesn't need to let himself fall anymore.\n28:14 Comment: At least that was my impression.\n28:16 Comment: And Medojevic has to keep his hands off of that.\n28:19 Comment: And Michael Weiner hints at it here.\n28:22 Comment: Once again I have to give you money.\n28:24 Comment: So I think Dom could have kept running.\n28:29 Comment: Then the path would have been clear for the right defender.\n28:34 Comment: Wojcikowski with the right, Schmelzer with the left.\n28:50 Comment: Smelter.\n28:53 Comment: Madlun is there too.\n28:54 Comment: Hasebe is there too.\n28:56 Comment: Medojevic.\n28:57 Comment: Dangerous play by Aubameyang.\n28:59 Comment: Free kick for Eintracht Frankfurt.\n29:7 Comment: Here.\n29:16 Comment: This is Aubameyang's penalty.\n29:18 Comment:

The flying goal for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang this season.\n29:42 Comment: In this regard, only former Dortmund player Robert Lewandowski has more with 22.\n29:54 Comment: That's a very good goal.\n29:58 Comment: And that is a very good goal for Borussia Dortmund.\n30:0 Comment: He has good leadership.\n30:2 Comment: That's a very good goal for Borussia Dortmund.\n30:4 Comment: One hour completed.\n30:5 Comment: Narrow lead for Borussia Dortmund.\n30:7 Comment: There is still no dangerous approach from Eintracht Frankfurt towards Mitch Langerick’s goal.\n30:13 Comment: Things can be different now.\n30:14 Comment: There's Kittel.\n30:15 Comment: Wide-footed and strong.\n30:18 Comment: But can't get past Mkhitaryan.\n30:20 Comment: So the concept is understandable.\n30:22 Comment: First of all.\n30:23 Comment: Eintracht Frankfurt is concerned about securing goals.\n30:25 Comment: The counterattacks have not worked as the head coach would have hoped.\n30:29 Comment: But now Thomas Schaaf’s boys are obviously challenged.\n30:32 Comment: Manage a 0-1 away draw.\n30:34 Comment: That doesn't help at all.\n30:36 Comment: We certainly won't see that either.\n30:38 Comment: This always carries the risk of conceding another goal against a counter-attacking team like BVB.\n30:44 Comment: coat.\n30:45 Comment: So the first conclusion.\n30:47 Comment: Through solar radiation.\n30:49 Comment: That's a very good goal.\n30:52 Comment: By Sonny Kittel, who had so many injuries in his still young career.\n30:58 Comment: Three knee operations.\n31:2 Comment: By his nature, he is a great footballer.\n31:6 Comment: Aubameyang against Sam Brownen.\n31:8 Comment: He played great.\n31:9 Comment: And Dortmund leads 2-0 thanks to Shinji Kagawa.\n31:22 Comment: That was a great goal.\n31:24 Comment: He injured himself a long time ago.\n31:30 Comment: It is the Japanese player’s 4th goal of the season.\n31:34 Comment: And here we have it with a very long lead time.\n31:38 Comment: This is a great ball for Aubameyang.\n31:40 Comment: Who brings Sam Brownen out of the defensive.\n31:42 Comment: The Peruvian does not get into the duel.\n31:45 Comment: There is no offside on Aubameyang's pass.\n31:49 Comment: The duel of Sam Brownen.\n31:50 Comment: Sam Brownen’s tackling is too passive.\n31:54 Comment: Madlun can't go there anymore.\n31:56 Comment: Aubameyang has his head up.\n31:58 Comment: And the view is clear for Shinji Kagawa, who is running alongside.\n32:3 Comment: Dortmund is almost comfortably leading.\n32:20 Comment: Within 8 minutes, Borussia Dortmund has, well, as they say in the Ruhr area, shown where the frog's curls are.\n32:30 Comment: At least as far as the result is concerned.\n32:37 Comment: The short-term record against today's opponent at home is impressive.\n32:41 Comment: Three wins in a row with a goal difference of 10 to 1.\n32:47 Comment: And overall the last 8 minutes.\n32:50 Comment: 18 home games against Eintracht Frankfurt.\n32:53 Comment: 13 wins, 4 draws.\n32:56 Comment: Just a defeat.\n32:58 Comment: February 2010 2 to 3.\n33:0 Comment: There was Michael Skibbe, the former Dortmund player who

Pierson, past Hummelt, there's Valdes, Schmelzer on the right, has moved in, Kagawa strong, body directly in between in a duel with Hasebe and Schmelzer sprints on the left, Obeyang makes space for the left defender and Kittel together with Chandler have worked him off and that is counter-pressing, just as Jürgen Klopp imagines it, immediately back there after losing the ball, immediately awake again, immediately back on track.\n35:50 Comment: Music\n36:12 Comment: Wheeze for Iniofsky.\n36:17 Comment: A very clever approach, as I said, suggested by Van Vogt.\n36:20 Comment: frees itself from Dortmund’s grip with playful methods.\n36:26 Comment: But in the final part of the game, the passing game lacks accuracy.\n36:31 Comment: They played brilliantly against Mönchengladbach for 90 minutes.\n36:35 Comment: With a high intensity and willingness to run as a team, they ran 12 kilometers more\n36:40 Comment: than, for example, on matchday 24 against Cologne with a 2-4 defeat.\n36:44 Comment: And even today there is a lot of willingness.\n36:47 Comment: And a love of running is necessary to take something back from Dortmund.\n37:17 Comment: This is how Thomas Schaaf experienced and took note of the second goal conceded.\n37:29 Comment: It was three balls to Cargava.\n37:34 Comment: The decisive factor was Dom’s super pass to Aubameyang.\n37:38 Comment: The sprint of Gabunas, the poor tackling in this situation by Carlos Sampano,\n37:44 Comment: who was noticeably lacking competition practice.\n37:47 Comment: And also the sprinting qualities of fellow runner Shinji Cargava.\n37:57 Comment: Third goal in the last five games for Shinji Cargava and Frankfurt now has 59 goals conceded this season.\n38:6 Comment: This is definitely too much.\n38:8 Comment: Especially in the first half of the season, in the wild football matches against Stuttgart, for example, they lost 4 to 5,\n38:15 Comment: against Hertha 4 to 4.\n38:17 Comment: And they also conceded a lot of goals.\n38:20 Comment: As planned.\n38:26 Comment: Good ball from Chandler to Kittel.\n38:29 Comment: Now behind Schmelzer.\n38:33 Comment: Maybe the squiggle was a bit much from Sonny Kittel.\n38:35 Comment: Had the opportunity to flank directly.\n38:38 Comment: Chandler.\n38:47 Comment: Geniowski.\n38:51 Comment: Lots of space for Shinji Cargava after the great pass from Wojciechowski.\n38:59 Comment: Aubameyang is there, Mkhitaryan is there.\n39:1 Comment: They played that badly.\n39:3 Comment: Much more could have been done with the approach if they had kept up the pace.\n39:9 Comment: And that is the risk I was talking about.\n39:15 Comment: Dortmund still.\n39:16 Comment: And Mengel.\n39:17 Comment: Regardless of the tabular situation.\n39:21 Comment: One of the strongest counter-attacking teams in the Bundesliga.\n39:24 Comment: If you give up too much space here,\n39:27 Comment: with the best intentions to score the goal,\n39:33 Comment: then it really hurts.\n39:41 Comment: Pass battle from Hasebe to Grignowski.\n39:44 Comment: And Ferovic, yes there is the first chance.\n39:49 Comment: Fall into reserve a little bit.\n39:51 Comment: Nelson Valdes, who was here in Dortmund,\n39:55 Comment: four years between 2006 and 2010.\n40:0 Comment: Has played 113 Bundesliga games.\n40:4 Comment: 15 goals scored, 14 assisted.\n40:7 Comment: Not everything worked out, not even between him and Jürgen Klopp.\n40:11 Comment: Now Piasson, no offside.\n40:12 Comment: Now Piasson, Socrates.\n40:14 Comment: Great, fantastic.\n40:16 Comment: With a lot of risk from Socrates against the up-and-coming Piasson.\n40:21 Comment: And on the other hand, logically, Lukas Piasson was born in Sao Paulo.\n40:27 Comment: Not determined enough here.\n40:29 Comment: And this gives Socrates the opportunity to get involved in this duel.\n40:35 Comment: Look how outraged Thomas Schaaf is.\n40:38 Comment: This was the biggest chance yet for Eintracht Frankfurt.\n40:44 Comment: That was the biggest chance we had last season.\n41:14 Comment: Now the people of Frankfurt have delivered cleverly.\n41:20 Comment: Now a counterattack chance for BVB.\n41:22 Comment: Mkhitaryan crosses Schandler’s path.\n41:25 Comment: Zambrano has to go.\n41:26 Comment: Zambrano misses the ball and now has it.\n41:33 Comment: Mkhitaryan follows up.\n41:34 Comment: Be careful, stay calm, guys.\n41:43 Comment: So.\n41:44 Comment: Mkhitaryan and Zambrano will probably both see yellow.\n41:50 Comment: Mkhitaryan is hard to control when he is out of control.\n41:54 Comment: Otherwise a quiet representative of the Armenians here.\n41:56 Comment: This is a close fight.\n41:58 Comment: Zambrano against Mkhitaryan, who then also has to stay behind.\n42:1 Comment: That is entirely legitimate.\n42:3 Comment: And Zambrano wedges backwards.\n42:5 Comment: And Mkhitaryan obviously took offense at that.\n42:8 Comment: It was a good thing that Kevin Trapp sprinted out of the box in time to prevent anything worse from happening.\n42:13 Comment: Here.\n42:13 Comment: So he wedges backwards.\n42:16 Comment: If you're really malicious, you could almost accuse him of violence.\n42:21 Comment: An ice spur, without question.\n42:23 Comment: Someone who is perhaps too easily provoked.\n42:28 Comment: I think the sentence is ultimately appropriate.\n42:30 Comment: Overall it is a fair football game.\n42:33 Comment: And both Mkhitaryan and Zambrano just need to cool their heads now.\n42:37 Comment: As he is in the round, to refrain from lighting fire rams.\n42:43 Comment: In the shadow of you and your club.\n42:46 Comment: So massive.\n42:48 Comment: Thank you very much.\n42:48 Comment: Scream\n43:7 Comment: No football game on glossy

Comment: A narrow goal chance for Andrat Frankfurt, shortly before half-time by Piason,\n0:18 Comment: In the end, that was not enough to seriously challenge Borussia Dortmund, this is Stendera's first action.\n0:30 Comment: Piason suspected of handball, Weiner reacted a little late because he waited for a possible advantage,\n0:41 Comment: And then Spender gets a yellow card for handball. We'll have to take a closer look at that.\n0:51 Comment: Here again, Piason makes the ball fast, then it is Sokratis with the handball,\n0:58 Comment: i.e. the inside suspect.\n1:0 Comment: The defender with yellow.\n1:7 Comment: And then it's, well, I'd guess, 28 meters to Lengerack.\n1:16 Comment: Piason has such distance in his feet, scored a fantastic goal from distance in Hamburg,\n1:27

Frankfurt only got ten points away from home.\n7:5 Comment: Corner now, Sonny Kittel.\n7:32 Comment: Clear distribution of roles now in Frankfurt’s midfield.\n7:35 Comment: Stendera is more of a transition player, so he plays at number eight.\n7:39 Comment: Hasebe is currently building up the play, stands between both central defenders,\n7:44 Comment: tries to stage the first sensible passing game.\n7:48 Comment: That was the right thing to do of Stendera, but it was also risky.\n7:53 Comment: Comes in at full speed with his side, studs first, and plays the ball.\n7:57 Comment: Thank God he plays the ball.\n8:0 Comment: This is Hasebe.\n8:2 Comment: Again, here.\n8:8 Comment: At full speed.\n8:11 Comment: Then it is often said that if there is a risk of injury to the opponent,\n8:15 Comment: then a referee must react whether a ball is in play or not.\n8:18 Comment: This was also such a borderline situation here.\n8:22 Comment: Action by Injovski, important, sportingly important for the team,\n8:26 Comment: otherwise Aubameyang would have been gone.\n8:32 Comment: And here he is again.\n8:33 Comment: Kittel with Seferovic.\n8:34 Comment: Robust in the duel with Mkhitaryan.\n8:42 Comment: If the arm goes out, the referee has to make a free-tapping decision if it stays leaning.\n8:49 Comment: Well, to be honest, they could have let it go.\n8:54 Comment: Especially since Mkhitaryan is going in.\n8:57 Comment: And obviously Thomas Schaaf seems to be of a similar opinion.\n9:2 Comment: And Jassmin Henderson Mkhitaryan's highest entry into the qualcosa also does not really occur.\n9:7 Comment: The Mini LeGuer and 2018 but even miteta 110 camper experienced.\n9:12 Comment: And also the funds champions FILPA Insideti.\n9:17 Comment: And the news becomes you again.\n9:22 Comment: Subject Ascvert Go same Po,\n9:30 Comment: Lo….\n9:32 Comment: Sorry, last time Sven Bender.\n9:44 Comment: Here too, Weiner waited for the advantage.\n9:48 Comment: In retrospect, a free kick was awarded to BVB.\n9:51 Comment: A clear message to Alexander Matlum.\n9:55 Comment: And they have it here again against Wasikowski.\n9:58 Comment: Wasikowski comes from behind.\n10:0 Comment: If he hits the heel, the Achilles tendon, he does it right.\n10:4 Comment: Auer remains with a warning.\n10:6 Comment: But Alexander Matlum will not be allowed to afford another such action.\n10:11 Comment: If it were to come to that, it would be his fifth yellow card.\n10:15 Comment: Yet it is not so far.\n10:16 Comment: We focus on the free kick for Borussia Dortmund.\n10:21 Comment: Slightly offset.\n10:21 Comment: Oberme Jan, of course, has this distance in his foot.\n10:25 Comment: 24 meters up to Kevin Trapp.\n10:27 Comment: But also a great position for the left-footer Marcel Schmelzer.\n10:34 Comment: Smelter.\n10:57 Comment: the\n10:58 Comment: window.\n11:12 Comment: op\n11:27 Comment: The central midfield position is important.\n11:31 Comment: And logically it makes a difference whether Sven Bender and Matthias Ginter are there.\n11:36 Comment: Or a Sahin or a Gündogan.\n11:39 Comment: BVB will not be able to rely on Sahin in the short term.\n11:44 Comment: With Gündogan and his sore throat, certainly for the cup semi-final.\n11:50 Comment: Bender, Kaka, but has way too much space.\n12:0 Comment: Central man of the offensive three-man line.\n12:5 Comment: Cathedral.\n12:7 Comment: Oh, Matlum from behind.\n12:10 Comment: He's going to get a yellow card here as expected.\n12:14 Comment: He still has to introduce himself to Michael Weiner, who made it very clear.\n12:19 Comment: You must not.\n12:20 Comment: Reach for it again.\n12:21 Comment: Again against Wasikowski at full speed from behind.\n12:28 Comment: So much experience.\n12:30 Comment: Alexander Matlum.\n12:36 Comment: 283rd Bundesliga match.\n12:39 Comment: He wants to say goodbye then.\n12:41 Comment: He hasn't seen yellow yet.\n12:43 Comment: Now he has it.\n12:45 Comment: So, it's the fifth yellow card here.\n12:46 Comment: Of course he wants to play the ball somehow.\n12:49 Comment: But it is coming.\n12:50 Comment: He comes into the tackle at full speed and brings him down from behind.\n12:54 Comment: So, it's dark yellow.\n12:57 Comment: Fifth yellow.\n12:58 Comment: Matlum will be missing in Bremen next week.\n13:1 Comment: But then Bama Anderson, who is missing today because of his fifth yellow card, is entitled to the game.\n13:12 Comment: A total of six yellow cards.\n13:14 Comment: Sounds like a wild kicking match.\n13:15 Comment: Actually, it isn't.\n13:17 Comment: But Michael Weiner sets the rule here.\n13:20 Comment: Consistently.\n13:22 Comment: Free kick from Schmelzer.\n13:24 Comment: Trapp is here.\n13:36 Comment: Aubameyang against Zambrano.\n13:38 Comment: Against Zambrano.\n13:41 Comment: Now, before we see the newspaper, I'll tell you that Zambrano was fiddling around with Aubameyang's neck.\n13:50 Comment: And then we have the situation here that he is now coming back to the middle.\n13:54 Comment: Whether it ultimately has to be a penalty is another question.\n13:56 Comment: There's Michael Weiner.\n13:57 Comment: That goes to Aubameyang.\n14:3 Comment: Here we have the situation.\n14:5 Comment: The pass is coming from Borsikowski.\n14:7 Comment: For Dom, who is not offside.\n14:13 Comment: Aubameyang, then maybe we should have talked about offside too.\n14:15 Comment: Now the duel.\n14:16 Comment: He pulls four down.\n14:17 Comment: And in this setting we see it.\n14:20 Comment: Then maybe a little more precisely.\n14:21 Comment: Aubameyang's ball reception.\n14:23 Comment: Look where Zambrano's right arm is.\n14:25 Comment: So no one can complain if Michael Weiner decides on a penalty for Borussia Dortmund.\n14:35 Comment: But if we interpret it clearly in terms of rules, we must of course say,\n14:40 Comment: Aubameyang came from offside.\n14:42 Comment: There was no one there before.\n14:44 Comment: But since he let this situation go, Michael Weiner,\n14:47 Comment: So we have this situation with Zambrano.\n14:50 Comment: And Aubameyang.\n14:51 Comment: And in my opinion that would have been more of a penalty.\n15:13 Comment: Kagaaba with Mkhitaryan.\n15:16 Comment: Wow, that's a good one.\n15:17 Comment: Borsikowski in the back.\n15:18 Comment: Yes, he needs it now.\n15:20 Comment: Good ball reception and control.\n15:24 Comment: hour played.\n15:25 Comment: The best phase of this game.\n15:26 Comment: There is speed in it.\n15:27 Comment: There are duels involved.\n15:28 Comment: Many contentious situations.\n15:31 Comment: Michael Weiner is currently in the spotlight.\n15:33 Comment: For me, two mistakes in one action.\n15:35 Comment: Didn't see the offside.\n15:37 Comment: A foul in the penalty area was not seen.\n15:38 Comment: This somewhat detracts from the previously good overall impression of the referee.\n15:44 Comment: Eintracht has set itself a goal in the second half.\n15:46 Comment: 65 percent possession.\n15:49 Comment: A chance to score.\n15:49 Comment: However, they were not able to play their way out.\n15:52 Comment: Stendera is good for the team.\n15:54 Comment: Brings creativity into the midfield.\n15:57 Comment: Even if he doesn’t succeed in everything.\n15:58 Comment: Dortmund remains more dangerous.\n16:1 Comment: And at BVB, the reigning Mkhitaryan and Kagaaba are obviously coming into form for the final stretch of the season.\n16:11 Comment: Aubameyang.\n16:19 Comment: Kagaaba is there too.\n16:21 Comment: Wasikowski is there too.\n16:22 Comment: Aubameyang.\n16:23 Comment: There's Wasikowski.\n16:24 Comment: But not precise enough.\n16:39 Comment: Biason.\n16:40 Comment: With coat now on one side.\n16:43 Comment: Sinferovic has moved to the left wing.\n16:49 Comment: For the final call here.\n16:52 Comment: McC Stalin with a\n16:58 Comment: Chain slipped.\n16:59 Comment: Then Ginter rushes in.\n17:0 Comment: Mucus.\n17:49 Comment: Kagaver is great and Dom breaks free in time.\n17:53 Comment: Seferovic wasn't paying attention for a moment.\n17:55 Comment: Cathedral around Seferovic, around the next cathedral.\n17:58 Comment: And voila.\n18:1 Comment: This shift in play from Kagaver is a feast for the eyes.\n18:19 Comment: Again quickly directly from Sven Bender to Kagaver.\n18:31 Comment: coat.\n18:33 Comment: Valdes.\n18:41 Comment: There's Marco Reus.\n18:43 Comment: Maybe you get 25 minutes of match practice and the opportunity\n18:48 Comment: to play.\n18:49 Comment: And get into the swing of things.\n18:51 Comment: To get in shape for the cup semi-final on Tuesday.\n18:55 Comment: Kick-off 2030 live and in color with us.\n18:58 Comment: Michael Weider with Thomas Schaaf.\n19:1 Comment: Because he's probably getting upset here.\n19:4 Comment: One can certainly discuss the proportionality\n19:7 Comment: in the duel evaluation.\n19:15 Comment: That's a good ball.\n19:19 Comment: We have the lead.\n19:21 Comment: Let's take the ball.\n19:22 Comment: And he drives him.\n19:23 Comment: Injovski, Valdes secures the ball.\n19:26 Comment: Have to put it down now.\n19:28 Comment: But that ultimately turns out to be too imprecise.\n19:32 Comment: Chandler.\n19:34 Comment: coat.\n19:38 Comment: Sensible lecture.\n19:39 Comment: Eintracht in the second half.\n19:41 Comment: That has to be said.\n19:42 Comment: Also good in terms of gameplay.\n19:44 Comment: But they keep running into Dortmund’s counterattacks.\n19:47 Comment: That would have to be offside.\n20:10 Comment: So we had it checked again with technical aids, ladies and gentlemen.\n20:14 Comment: And then this situation Aubameyang against Zambrano. Before the duel in the 16-meter area, Aubameyang was offside.\n20:20 Comment: So that should have been whistled off.\n20:23 Comment: But it was difficult to see in contrast to the duel between Zambrano and Aubameyang.\n20:44 Comment: Zabrano cleared by Ginter. Free kick for Eintracht Frankfurt.\n20:53 Comment: So Matthias Ginter is hitting hard in central midfield.\n21:2 Comment: Piasson with Valdes against Dohm, against Sokratis.\n21:6 Comment: Wow, Valdes is very, very strong.\n21:9 Comment: And the same predicate applies to Socratis.\n21:13 Comment: Socrates.\n21:14 Comment: Papastatopoulos. There has to be enough time.\n21:24 Comment: Chandler.\n21:30 Comment: So, now would be the time to substitute Marco Reus, who had to sit out the last game due to adductor problems.\n21:38 Comment: Seven goals this season, five assists.\n21:41 Comment: And he is brought into play for Jakub Gwazic.\n21:43 Comment: Jakub Gwazicowski with 56 ball actions.\n21:48 Comment: The outstanding player at Borussia Dortmund has won 67 percent of his duels.\n21:55 Comment: This is also a top value for an offensive player.\n21:59 Comment: Maybe a little unfortunate in the end.\n22:2 Comment: And now Marco Reus is in the team for him.\n22:7 Comment: Will the adductors hold up? Logically, he'll be a candidate for the starting eleven on Tuesday.\n22:13 Comment: And rightly so, Cuba, as everyone calls it, is being bid farewell with applause here in the Signal Iduna Park.\n22:21 Comment: And they are venomous and greedy in the duels, the Dortmunders.\n22:33 Comment: With the gate.\n22:37 Comment: Also available in midfield.\n22:43 Comment: Michi Tarjan has moved over to the right side.\n22:46 Comment: Cargava stays central, Reus on the left, 4-2-3-1.\n22:53 Comment: There Reus, with his run, forces Zambrano to make this bad pass.\n22:57 Comment: Michi Tarjan, there’s Reus!\n22:59 Comment: That would have been a number for Marco Reus.\n23:5 Comment: He himself provoked this bad pass from Zambrano.\n23:9 Comment: Then he comes a little late.\n23:21 Comment: In terms of the quality of this encounter, this game was much better than the first three quarters of an hour.\n23:29 Comment: This is mainly due to Eintracht Frankfurt, who are playing much more offensively.\n23:35 Comment: Take a look at the back four and how far Thomas Schaaf orders his back four to move forward, at the level of the halfway line.\n23:47 Comment: However, there are still no chances to score.\n23:52 Comment: No offside from Reus.\n23:54 Comment: But Mkhitaryan's passing battle was difficult to control.\n24:5 Comment: The ball is in the middle.\n24:17 Comment: Kagawa-san.\n24:20 Comment: Against Madlum.\n24:21 Comment: There's Reus.\n24:24 Comment: In the 16-meter space.\n24:25 Comment: Past Schandler, past Injovski.\n24:32 Comment: Benders.\n24:35 Comment: He is good.\n24:39 Comment: And the chance for Kagawa.\n24:41 Comment: And again Mkhitaryan.\n24:55 Comment: Dortmund is playing great.\n24:57 Comment: Dortmund plays variably.\n24:59 Comment: Very cheeky and creative in the offensive.\n25:2 Comment: If there is anything to complain about, it is no longer the case.\n25:5 Comment: But it is a very, very good opportunity.\n25:6 Comment: And the utilization of opportunities.\n25:7 Comment: In the second round.\n25:8 Comment: Kuba, Dom, Reus, Kagawa, Mkhitaryan.\n25:11 Comment: All good to very good scoring opportunities for the black and yellows.\n25:36 Comment: 2–0.\n25:38 Comment: Eagles unite.\n25:41 Comment: 2–0.\n25:56 Comment: Kashgya can임am.\n25:57 Comment: That was it.\n25:58 Comment: Bernhard Benschel received the illustrate An policymakers Kchiefurst.\n26:0 Comment: Vice President Rahmanka said his team was keen to act quickly,\n26:3 Comment: Music\n26:33 Comment: Persistent voices\n27:0 Comment: Chandler with Seferovic here on the site\n27:2 Comment: this is the Swiss national striker\n27:3 Comment: This is Luca Waldschmidt, 18 years old, born in Siegen, about to make his Bundesliga debut.\n27:17 Comment: Can also play A-Youth, has played three games for Eintracht A-Youth, one\n27:22 Comment: Goal scored.\n27:23 Comment: Now he will come into the game for Sonny Kittel.\n27:27 Comment: With the yellow card, if the rules were interpreted very strictly, he should have\n27:31 Comment: should have gotten two yellow cards, because the handball he caused was perhaps\n27:36 Comment: would also have been worth a yellow card.\n27:38 Comment: So, this will reduce the average age of Eintracht Frankfurt a little bit again.\n27:43 Comment: 22-year-old Sonny Kittel leaves and 18-year-old Luca Waldschmidt makes his Bundesliga debut.\n27:50 Comment: Attention, Aubameyang is on his way against Zambrano.\n27:55 Comment: And then he comes back.\n28:1 Comment: Schmelzer with Mkhitaryan.\n28:12 Comment: Aubameyang.\n28:27 Comment: Lard.\n28:29 Comment: Smelter.\n28:31 Comment: Gisele Ferrovic.\n28:39 Comment: With forest.\n28:43 Comment: forest.\n28:45 Comment: Nelson Waldes again.\n28:49 Comment: So 80,667 spectators, the Signal Iduna Park is once again sold out.\n29:1 Comment: And now they see a corner for Eintracht Frankfurt.\n29:8 Comment: The corner kick ratio was 2 to 1 in favor of Thomas Schaaf’s team.\n29:16 Comment: Stendera.\n29:18 Comment: Hummels.\n29:20 Comment: Nose.\n29:22 Comment: Again for Stendera.\n29:26 Comment: Dengarek.\n29:27 Comment: Didn't have anything to hold at all this afternoon.\n29:31 Comment: And Luca Waldschmidt, this as additional information takes over the left side.\n29:40 Comment: Piasson now on the right.\n29:42 Comment: There's Mkhitaryan.\n29:43 Comment: At full sprint.\n29:44 Comment: What else can he do?\n29:46 Comment: Mkhitaryan.\n29:50 Comment: Maybe he could have passed back to the 16 meter space line.\n29:54 Comment: Marco Reus was standing there.\n29:55 Comment: Relatively well sorted.\n29:58 Comment: Here he chips the ball into the center.\n30:1 Comment: Shinji Kagawa, who is comparatively harmless in the header,\n30:5 Comment: Another quarter of an hour.\n30:7 Comment: What can we expect from this game?\n30:9 Comment: Dortmund is playing very, very well.\n30:11 Comment: Has the most degrees.\n30:13 Comment: Has the dangerous scoring chances and situations in front of Kevin Trapp's goal.\n30:18 Comment: It's an open game.\n30:20 Comment: They don't stay in the midfield for long, but instead look straight for the way forward.\n30:25 Comment: Frankfurt is playing along.\n30:26 Comment: Somehow it is also well sorted.\n30:29 Comment: However, Thomas Schaaf’s team made it.\n30:31 Comment: Not to get yourself into dangerous finishing situations.\n30:36 Comment: I noted a dangerous goal-scoring situation.\n30:39 Comment: Please correct me if I have forgotten anything.\n30:42 Comment: 41st minute.\n30:43 Comment: Piasson in the second round.\n30:45 Comment: Although, as I said, they play along well.\n30:47 Comment: The attacks run smoothly.\n30:49 Comment: At least until the last part of the game.\n30:51 Comment: Not a single goal chance for Thomas Schaaf’s team.\n30:56 Comment: He works.\n30:57 Comment: He's working hard out there in his coaching zone.\n31:0 Comment: Keeps pushing them forward.\n31:2 Comment: But it lacks punch.\n31:4 Comment: There is a lack of assertiveness.\n31:7 Comment: The idea is missing.\n31:9 Comment: Aubameyang offside.\n31:11 Comment: The right decision does not start from your own half, but is clearly\n31:23 Comment: been in the opponent's half.\n31:30 Comment: Kevyn Campbell in the semi-darkness.\n31:41 Comment: Slovenian international came in January for 12 million euros.\n31:50 Comment: This is what we heard and read about BVB.\n31:52 Comment: Kevin Campbell.\n32:16 Comment: What was your situation here?\n32:19 Comment: Kleber on his dream puck with 1.8

    "summary": "On the 30th matchday of the Bundesliga, Borussia Dortmund faced Eintracht Frankfurt at Signal Iduna Park. Dortmund, buoyed by a rich array of talent, showed their prowess throughout the game, ultimately securing a 2-0 victory.\n\nAs the game kicked off, it was immediately clear that Dortmund would be without several key players. Weidenfeller was out with a back injury, and while Großkotz and Kehl were also absent due to a torn thigh muscle and a broken rib respectively, the team had to contend without Oliver Kirch, Shahid, Gündogan, and Lukas Piszczek due to various injuries including throat infections. For Eintracht Frankfurt, Ujipka and Andersson were suspended for yellow cards, and Russ, Maier, and Stefan Aigner were out due to injuries. Additionally, there was speculation as to whether Chandler could effectively slot into the left-back position.\n\nEintracht Frankfurt started with Piasson on the left and Kittel on the right, roles that were expected to be fluid throughout the game. In the opening stages, Dortmund showed intent as Sikorsky delivered a great ball to Durm. Ginter, starting in central defense, proved crucial in breaking up any nascent Frankfurt attacks, showing versatility reminiscent of his previous great performance against Paderborn.\n\nFrankfurt tried to utilize Piasson and Kittel to counter Dortmund's aggressiveness. Piasson showed efficacy in the center but was caught narrowly offside, a decision correctly made by the linesman. The initial 15 minutes witnessed Dortmund’s supremacy in ball possession and tackle success, with Eintracht Frankfurt primarily focusing on maintaining a solid defense.\n\nDortmund's efforts bore fruit in the 23rd minute when a handball by Zambrano in the penalty area led to a penalty for Borussia Dortmund. Aubameyang stepped up confidently and executed a cheeky chip into the net, marking his 14th goal of the season. The gabonese international's composed finish was a powerful demonstration of his growing confidence and skill.\n\nThe first major chance for Eintracht came almost immediately after the restart as Piasson managed a breakthrough, but it was called offside once again. Over the course of the first half, Eintracht's main approach was to play on the counter, but Dortmund's defense—anchored by Ginter and Hummels—was resolute, snuffing out any significant threats.\n\nAs the first half progressed, Eintracht's defensive tactics saw glimpses of hope as Valdes tried to capitalize on Dortmund's attacking fervor. However, inaccuracies in passing, notably from the likes of Medojevic, hampered their ability to mount a significant challenge.\n\nIn the second half, Eintracht Frankfurt seemed determined to overturn the one-goal deficit. The introduction of Martinez and aggressive plays from Seferovic and Chandler signalled their intent. However, every foray into Dortmund's half was met with staunch resistance, typified by Socratis' timely tackles and clean solutions from Schmelzer and Durm.\n\nIt wasn't until the 61st minute that Dortmund extended their lead, courtesy of a sublime finish by Shinji Kagawa. Aubameyang, instrumental yet again, created space effectively and laid off a precise pass. Kagawa's composed finish past the Frankfurt keeper was testament to his resurgent form, securing his 4th goal of the season.\n\nFrom this point, Dortmund was in cruise control. Despite a valiant effort from Eintracht, particularly through Kittel and Chandler's battling efforts, they couldn't break through Dortmund's tactical rigidity. Even as Thomas Schaaf ordered his back four to press higher and orchestrate quick transitions, the final execution lacked accuracy and intent.\n\nA persistent issue for Eintracht was their lack of penetration in the final third. Although possessing the ball 65 percent of the time in the second half, meaningful chances were few and far between. A dangerous collision between Aubameyang and Zambrano led to some heated moments, but the referee managed to calm things down, handing out yellow cards generously when needed.\n\nAs the clock ticked down, both teams made several substitutions to inject fresh legs into the game. For Dortmund, Marco Reus' introduction brought more flair and attacking dimension. He tested Eintracht's defense, including a well-placed corner for Ginter that failed to convert into a goal.\n\nThroughout the second half, Eintracht continued their advances, notably with crosses and attempts from Piasson and Waldschmidt, an 18-year-old making his debut. Despite their efforts, including a courageous battle from Valdes, Eintracht couldn't muster a goal. Dortmund countered effectively but were unable to add to their tally thanks to some last-ditch defending from the away side.\n\nIn the latter stages, with over 80,000 fans cheering, Dortmund's composure was notable. The game ended with a corner for Eintracht Frankfurt which yielded no results, encapsulating their challenging day at the office. Dortmund's defensive structure was solid, with Langerak, in goal for the injured Weidenfeller, having little to do.\n\nSumming up, the game was a potent display of Dortmund's ability to dominate and convert vital chances while maintaining defensive discipline. Thomas Schaaf’s Eintracht exhibited flashes of brilliance but ultimately fell short against a well-organized and clinical Dortmund side. The 2-0 victory for Dortmund was a deserved result reflective of their control and precision across both halves.\n\nIt's a result that leaves Dortmund motivated ahead of their DFB-Pokal semi-final clash with Bayern Munich, determined to bring this form into a high-stakes encounter. For Frankfurt, the game provided a learning curve to tighten their strategies and improve their decisiveness in the attacking third."
