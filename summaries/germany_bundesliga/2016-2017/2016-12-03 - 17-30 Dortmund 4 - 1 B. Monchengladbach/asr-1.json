    "input": "\n    Dortmund 4 - 1 B.\n\nFirst Half:\n\n0:0 Comment: Borussia Dortmund in the traditional press black and yellow from left to right in the first half.\n0:14 Comment: Dortmund's last two Bundesliga home games were extremely poor.\n0:21 Comment: A 0-0 against Schalke, a 1-0 against FC Bayern.\n0:26 Comment: But in between there was also the Champions League game here against Legia Warsaw.\n0:30 Comment: With twelve goals in 90 minutes, Dortmund won 8 to 4.\n0:35 Comment: Last season between these two it was a very clear affair for Thomas Tuchel's team,\n0:42 Comment: who had his first Bundesliga game as BVB coach back then.\n0:45 Comment: Perhaps now is the first chance to score and the first test for Jan Sommer between the Borussia Mönchengladbach posts.\n0:55 Comment: He was the Swiss national goalkeeper. Last season he got four here.\n1:0 Comment: In August 2015 Dortmund won 4 to 0.\n1:7 Comment: Two of the goalscorers are playing again today, with Aubameyang and Reus for the Black and Yellows.\n1:26 Comment: First foul of the game. First free kick.\n1:31 Comment: Nuri Sahin immediately apologizes and the whistle from Marco Fritz.\n1:55 Comment: Azar's free kick.\n2:7 Comment: Aubameyang. Dembele.\n2:12 Comment: That will come over the right side. Piszczek goes with it.\n2:17 Comment: Too high for summer.\n2:21 Comment: And then Azar was behind again. The Belgian. But Dortmund stuck with it.\n2:27 Comment: We're trying to put Gladbacher under pressure right from the start.\n2:30 Comment: Castro.\n2:32 Comment: Ginter.\n2:38 Comment: So, Gladbach, you can see now, they play with five in the chain at the back.\n2:45 Comment: Tobias Strobl, when Dortmund has the ball, joins the Mönchengladbach defense formation.\n2:53 Comment: Then we've already discussed that.\n3:1 Comment: Outside position, as expected, Wendt on the left, basket on the right.\n3:8 Comment: And then in the middle Christensen, flanked by Strobl and Elwedy.\n3:13 Comment: And Sommer can't complain about the lack of touch on the ball early in the game.\n3:28 Comment: Mistakes from Raphael, Ginter, good eye for Aubameyang, summer isn't going anywhere.\n3:32 Comment: And then the ball doesn't get to Marco Reus.\n3:35 Comment: First chance to score, if you will, for Borussia Dortmund.\n3:40 Comment: And this time, if you will, he prepared and didn't complete it because the angle was just too acute.\n3:47 Comment: Aubameyang gets past Sommer, but then it's no longer enough to score.\n3:53 Comment: But Dortmund starts here like the famous fire department.\n3:56 Comment: Ginter.\n3:59 Comment: Shine.\n4:10 Comment: Goal, goal, goal.\n4:30 Comment: The Gladbachers try to make the rooms as narrow as possible.\n4:34 Comment: There's no pressing at first, Dortmund let all the players in their own half do as they please.\n4:40 Comment: At the back, as I said, there's a five-man chain, in front of that is the hat and Kramer.\n4:46 Comment: And the three offensive forces, Hazard, Raphael and Stindl, also do defensive work.\n4:53 Comment: You don't want to let Dortmund get into the build-up game.\n4:58 Comment: But we've already experienced that twice.\n5:0 Comment: After all, Gladbach now gets possession of the ball through a throw-in.\n5:3 Comment: Here we have Marc Bartra as one of four new players in the starting line-up after the defeat in Frankfurt.\n5:11 Comment: Of course we still remember Thomas Tuchel's statements well.\n5:15 Comment: My only deficit technically, tactically, mentally, that should be different today.\n5:20 Comment: Wendt, he's there, in the Dortmund penalty shot, Raphael and that's the lead for the guests.\n5:27 Comment: Sixth minute, Borussia Mönchengladbach leads 1-0 with their first attack ever in this game.\n5:39 Comment: Hardly any positive reactions from André Schubert.\n5:45 Comment: Here's the preparer.\n5:47 Comment: And then there's no one with Wendt to bring in the cross.\n5:51 Comment: Header defense too short by Marc Bartra and Raphael thanks almost exactly from the penalty area marker.\n5:59 Comment: Bartra could have put this one somewhere else and should have unclipped it.\n6:3 Comment: And Weidenfeller, I don't know if he had ever touched a ball before, I don't think so, he has to get it out of the net straight away.\n6:12 Comment: Here's Bartra's mistake again, but Dortmund are poorly positioned anyway.\n6:19 Comment: No sign of Piszczek on the right side of defense either.\n6:23 Comment: And on the other hand the equalizer falls, what's going on here, Aubameyang?\n6:30 Comment: Seventh minute, 1 to 1.\n6:34 Comment: We'll have to see how many seconds there were between these two hits.\n6:39 Comment: Goal number 14 of the season for the Gabonese, who was already leading the top scorers list in the Bundesliga before this matchday.\n6:49 Comment: As won, so lost, the Gladbachers' motto.\n6:52 Comment: Preparatory work by Dembele, then Reus prevails here, two men around Aubameyang, but no one so close that he could have intervened.\n7:6 Comment: But above all, Elwedi doesn't manage to stop Reus from doing the preparatory work.\n7:12 Comment: And so Aubameyang scores exactly 59 seconds after the opening goal for Mönchengladbach.\n7:21 Comment: I didn't even get around to saying that it was Raffael's third goal of the season, it happened so quickly.\n7:27 Comment: We don't want to let it sink.\n7:29 Comment: Raffael, who has been injured for five weeks, last scored in mid-September with a brace in the win against Werder Bremen.\n7:49 Comment: So now the Gladbachers have at least managed to do something they couldn't do in Dortmund last season, namely score a goal.\n7:56 Comment: But of course they would have liked to have been in the lead for longer than less than a minute, that's clear.\n8:2 Comment: Yes, Wendt discovered where it particularly hurts.\n8:11 Comment: Well, André Schobert now has to rebuild his team, of course.\n8:15 Comment: That somehow fits into Borussia's image, at least from last week.\n8:26 Comment: We had three home games in eight days.\n8:29 Comment: We were 1-0 up against Cologne in the Champions League against Manchester City.\n8:32 Comment: Same and last Saturday against Hoffenheim.\n8:35 Comment: We didn't win any of the three games and lost to Cologne.\n8:40 Comment: After that there were two draws.\n8:41 Comment: So we always squandered this 1-0 lead.\n8:44 Comment: It went really quickly today.\n8:56 Comment: Yes, offside position correctly detected.\n9:1 Comment: He was penalized when the goal scorer was offside to make it 1-0 to Raphael.\n9:15 Comment: In the counter game against Borussia Dortmund.\n9:34 Comment: Both teams have impressive series in both positive and negative respects.\n9:41 Comment: Bundesliga home games\n9:42 Comment: Undefeated here at Signal Iduna Park, there have been 22 wins and five draws since the last home defeat\n9:49 Comment: That was a long time ago April 4th\n9:52 Comment: 2015 a 0 to 1\n9:53 Comment: Against Bayern and the Gladbachers are just one of their last 16\n9:59 Comment: It's hard to believe that we won away games last season on the last match day there was a 2-0 score\n10:5 Comment: At the newly promoted team Darmstadt 98\n10:9 Comment: Otherwise the Gladbachers are at least in terms of the results\n10:15 Comment: Terrifying achievements\n10:19 Comment: At away games\n10:21 Comment: 4 draws, 11 defeats, otherwise we'll see if that can be corrected today in Dortmund of all places, there's still a long way to go\n10:39 Comment: Ginter\n10:50 Comment: Socrates\n10:53 Comment: Appearance\n10:54 Comment: Having to take a break for long months because of a blockage in the cervical vertebrae then made a comeback\n10:59 Comment: He was also one of the goalscorers in the Champions League against Ligia Warsaw half a week ago\n11:3 Comment: The cup also has an appearance in the Bundesliga, it is his first ever this season and we are already on the 13th matchday\n11:24 Comment: Of course it's really tight there, you can see how low the entire Gladbach team is to defend their own goal\n11:32 Comment: That didn't work quite so well in the seventh minute when Aubameyang scored.\n11:38 Comment: When you apparently still\n11:41 Comment: In the exuberance of emotions\n11:44 Comment: After the gate of Raphael was located\n11:48 Comment: The Gladbachers, on the other hand, were the first away goal since then\n11:54 Comment: September 21st this year in Leipzig\n11:58 Comment: The Gladbachers not only lost recently but didn't score a single goal in the defeats at Schalke in Munich and Berlin.\n12:6 Comment: Standel\n12:25 Comment: Socrates' hat, watch out for Piszczek\n12:36 Comment: The\n12:41 Comment: It was Raphael, who was missing from Gladbach for a long time after Moskal Fasares\n12:50 Comment: He's slowly getting back to his usual form and proved that with his goal in the sixth minute. Stand against the bars\n12:59 Comment: Wendt\n13:2 Comment: Raphael\n13:6 Comment: So there could be an opportunity for Dortmund if Dembele gets his way and is quick on his feet anyway.\n13:22 Comment: The bottom line is that Dembele was traveling too fast for four Gladbachers\n13:30 Comment: Strobel\n13:31 Comment: I still want to play the ball and you can see that the ball doesn't hit Dortmund instead\n13:38 Comment: We don't have to discuss opponents and the legitimacy of the yellow card\n14:2 Comment: The\n14:4 Comment: Dembele lets through\n14:6 Comment: There's a bit of confusion then\n14:9 Comment: Back there in the Borussia defense and the captain opts for the safe option to get out with the thing if it happens\n14:16 Comment: Corner brings the opponent\n14:20 Comment: The\n14:22 Comment: Dembele\n14:24 Comment: Christine\n14:54 Comment: 2-1, goal for Dortmund, the corner by Lukas Piszczek.\n15:1 Comment: Fifteen minutes played, the third goal at Signal Iduna Park by Lukas Piszczek.\n15:12 Comment: And believe it or not, he's a right wing-back by training\n15:15 Comment: And scores for the third time this season.\n15:21 Comment: Dembele's corner.\n15:25 Comment: And then let's see, it's not an offside position for Lukas Piszczek, everything is fine.\n15:31 Comment: Goal scored correctly, Gitta might irritate his own colleagues.\n15:37 Comment: I don't know if Bartra wanted to take it off the way he did,\n15:41 Comment: But Piszczek definitely has the presence of mind and immediately turns his head,\n15:46 Comment: Reacts quickly and puts Dortmund in the lead.\n15:50 Comment: After six minutes they were behind, the black and yellow ones, and after a quarter of an hour they were leading.\n16:5 Comment: So now Captain Lars Stindl will perhaps question himself again.\n16:10 Comment: When I said, he chooses the safe option if it also means a corner for the opponent.\n16:15 Comment: The corner cost Gladbach something.\n16:27 Comment: Wow, he was lucky, Nico Elvedi, the young Swiss has actually been in really good form for weeks.\n16:38 Comment: Raphael is not offside, but now they have to move up.\n16:41 Comment: Yes, that will take a moment. No unfair action against Raphael, let it continue correctly.\n16:47 Comment: We were a long way from a penalty.\n16:56 Comment: I admit, dear spectators, we haven't yet scored as many goals together as in a handball game,\n17:1 Comment: But for a football game that's impressive.\n17:4 Comment: Three goals after a quarter of an hour.\n17:6 Comment: There will definitely be more today from 5 p.m., I can promise you that with a clear conscience,\n17:11 Comment: in the Velox EHF Champions League.\n17:13 Comment: Totverein Hasse Winterberg-Kiel meets Wisla Plock.\n17:17 Comment: It's the last game before the winter break, today from 5 p.m. with colleagues on Sky Sport 1.\n17:36 Comment: So, even after they've fallen behind, the sliding saves haven't changed the tactics at first.\n17:48 Comment: Stand deep and offer the opponent as little space as possible, but that hasn't worked twice.\n17:54 Comment: The second goal was a standard situation, so naturally the cards are shuffled differently beforehand.\n18:0 Comment: But that's a bitter pill that the guests from the Lower Rhine have to swallow.\n18:4 Comment: You thought you had shocked your opponent by taking the early lead after six minutes, and now you're behind yourself.\n18:34 Comment: We are the man who lives the camp. We are the man who lives the camp.\n19:4 Comment: So, of course there's a good mood among the 81,360, that is, the 8,000 gliding parades, which of course has to be deducted.\n19:22 Comment: Dortmund now has a little more calm, can concentrate a little better, play a little more waiting until the gap opens up.\n19:33 Comment: Now that we have this 2-1 lead, today's home win is of course vitally important for Dortmund,\n19:45 Comment: Because if you look at the table, the gap is quite significant.\n19:49 Comment: Before this matchday, three points behind 3rd Hertha and 4th Frankfurt, nine points behind Leipzig and, since yesterday, also behind Bayern, who presented with the 3-1 win in Mainz.\n20:3 Comment: And one thing is clear, Dortmund want to be in the top three at the end of the season if it's possible.\n20:15 Comment: And seventh place isn't what you want.\n20:21 Comment: Now there are uncertainties back there with the Gladbachers, even in the build-up game, Reus against Elwedi and Kramer.\n20:30 Comment: Raphael is still far back now.\n20:36 Comment: Now Marcel Schmelzer fouls Julian Korb. Free kick for Gladbach.\n20:46 Comment: We look again at the goal to make it 1-1, preparatory work from Reus and there are three Gladbachers there, but that didn't help.\n20:56 Comment: Not even a few minutes later when Lukas Piszczek made it 2-1.\n21:1 Comment: Yes, she hasn't lost her good mood. He makes sure that the joy doesn't get too overwhelming.\n21:6 Comment: It's been back and forth emotionally here in terms of the feelings for the fans on both sides.\n21:26 Comment: Kastro, now attack a little earlier in the person of Hazard.\n21:38 Comment: Ginter is also attacked immediately, but not yet in the sidehouse. Misunderstanding between Dembélé and Piszczek.\n21:57 Comment: So, after 22 minutes, Gladbach appeared dangerously in front of Dortmund's goal just once.\n22:9 Comment: A quarter of the game is already over, but at least exploiting opportunities has actually been the big problem for the guests from Niederrhein in the last few weeks.\n22:20 Comment: It's at 100 percent, but now they have to be careful again.\n22:23 Comment: Aubameyang, Dembélé are free, Patra waited a bit long and Reus no longer puts the ball in front of the goal as he would have liked.\n22:31 Comment: And Strobl clears it for a corner.\n22:34 Comment: So, the goal to make it 1-2 was the first goal Borussia Mönchengladbach ever conceded this season after a corner.\n22:53 Comment: It's happening again now, like the one from the right and like the one from Dembélé, but this time it's less dangerous.\n23:4 Comment: Dembélé is incredibly quick on his feet, strong at dribbling.\n23:14 Comment: And the Gladbachers are spared the next corner, but it's not over yet. Summer will do well.\n23:22 Comment: And then we have Tobias Strobl in an unusual position today, although he is, as they say today, a polyvalent player, meaning he can be used in a variety of positions.\n23:35 Comment: Defensive midfield, right-back or, as today, playing inside in a five-man chain Strobl-Kantz, the new signing from Hoffenheim.\n24:6 Comment: So, Thomas Tuchel demanded emotionality and passion from his team yesterday after the weak performance in Frankfurt.\n24:15 Comment: We can find out after just under 25 minutes, that's what we have today.\n24:20 Comment: The team is in good shape and certainly benefited from the fact that they were able to equalize after going behind in the sixth minute.\n24:33 Comment: In principle, there was no time at all to become uncertain and nervous until the whole thing was corrected again from BVB's point of view.\n24:42 Comment: Raphael, attacked early by Reus, but still prevails.\n24:49 Comment: Raphael, yes Castro is of the opinion that he played the ball, Marco Fritz is of the opposite opinion.\n24:56 Comment: No, you didn't, lazy play and that's why I whistled the free kick.\n25:1 Comment: Here we see again how the Brazilian prevails, here comes Castro, yes hits him down.\n25:6 Comment: And we saw that Marco Fritz was excellently positioned, not even standing two meters away.\n25:26 Comment: Kirstensen, Kramer, try a long ball.\n25:40 Comment: Julian Korb against Schmelzer, he did well, Dahoud, Kramer.\n25:47 Comment: Raphael, who now repeatedly drops out to the wing position on the left and right.\n25:57 Comment: Kramer.\n26:7 Comment: Stindl still has a bit of space.\n26:11 Comment: And then basically played into the back of Wendt, he was also offside.\n26:16 Comment: He doesn't have to be upset that he didn't get the ball under control.\n26:21 Comment: At least some kind of combination football from the guests towards the Dortmund goal.\n26:26 Comment: We haven't seen that since the goal in the sixth minute.\n26:31 Comment: Otherwise, Dortmund had a lot of possession of the ball, also and precisely because of that,\n26:35 Comment: Because Borussia Mönchengladbach allows itself to fall back deep into its own half when the opponent has the ball.\n26:41 Comment: Helvedi.\n26:50 Comment: Castro, try it on your own.\n27:5 Comment: I was lucky that Dortmund stayed in possession of the ball.\n27:9 Comment: Schmelter, Reus.\n27:12 Comment: Obermeyang thinks to himself, it's quick, I'll give it a try.\n27:16 Comment: But Sommer played well, but Obermeyang still gets the thumbs up,\n27:21 Comment: Who in the meantime made it 1-1, his seventh goal in the last four Bundesliga games, his 14th overall.\n27:33 Comment: And that means he has scored one more goal than the entire Borussia Mönchengladbach team has so far.\n27:40 Comment: Castro, yes, two Gladbachers.\n27:56 Comment: It is then Christensen who will clarify the situation.\n28:8 Comment: Otherwise Obermeyang would have had free rein.\n28:39 Comment: Piszczek, he comes into possession of the ball first, against Wendt.\n28:44 Comment: Piszczek, made strong by Poland, the input intended for Marco Reus, was less good, so transparent Christensen.\n28:53 Comment: One-two with Raphael, Christensen is slowly getting into areas he's not very familiar with.\n29:1 Comment: He's a defender and then promptly gets stuck with Gonzalo Castro.\n29:10 Comment: So, almost half an hour played, more possession for Dortmund, they are almost forced to do that by Borussia Mönchengladbach's tactical orientation.\n29:20 Comment: Current value over 68 percent ball possession for Borussia Dortmund.\n29:25 Comment: The Gladbachers let themselves fall deep into their own half.\n29:30 Comment: That was the case at 0-0, that was the case at 1-0, at 1-1 and now also at 1-2.\n29:36 Comment: So they'll go through with it, regardless of how the game stands in the meantime.\n29:41 Comment: And in the first quarter of an hour it went up and down, up and down.\n29:51 Comment: Hase, Dahoud, scorer against Hoffenheim last Saturday.\n30:7 Comment: Now you're starting to get the impression that the guests want to do a little more for the offensive game, and whether they can do more.\n30:18 Comment: We'll see, at the moment it's going backwards again.\n30:21 Comment: Christensen attacked by Aubameyang.\n30:24 Comment: Summer, he twitched his hands a bit, he shouldn't have touched him with it, otherwise there would have been a direct free kick because of the back pass rule.\n30:35 Comment: Masa against Socrates.\n30:37 Comment: Straubel takes the free kick against Ousmane Dembélé.\n31:1 Comment: against Ousmane Dembélé.\n31:3 Comment: Not in the starting line-up in the last three Bundesliga games.\n31:7 Comment: Today the 19-year-old can start again from the start.\n31:18 Comment: Hazard.\n31:22 Comment: Kramer, who scored a spectacular own goal here in November 2014.\n31:28 Comment: Some may remember.\n31:31 Comment: In an arc lamp like this from a considerable distance.\n31:34 Comment: And the problem for him was that it was the only goal in the game.\n31:38 Comment: And Dortmund ended up winning 1-0.\n31:41 Comment: That was two years ago again.\n31:49 Comment: So, Julian Weigl is getting ready at Borussia Dortmund.\n31:57 Comment: Slight problems possibly with Nuri Sahin.\n32:0 Comment: We'll keep an eye on it then.\n32:7 Comment: Both teams will be back in the Champions League next week.\n32:11 Comment: It's about the Spanish week, if you will, for Borussia Dortmund and Borussia Mönchengladbach.\n32:17 Comment: For Dortmund it's still about defending first place in the group.\n32:22 Comment: If you can avoid a defeat at Real Madrid, you will finish first in the group.\n32:27 Comment: And the Gladbachers, as we know, will definitely continue to play in the Europa League next year.\n32:32 Comment: Regardless of how they perform at FC Barcelona during the week.\n32:36 Comment: Belay doesn't have an offside. Reus has the chance.\n32:39 Comment: And at the last moment the Gladbachers can clarify.\n32:43 Comment: There wasn't much missing.\n32:48 Comment: El-Wedi doesn't give up, then starts the sprint and just manages to beat former Gladbach player Marco Reus.\n32:56 Comment: To the last moment move.\n32:59 Comment: But good eye from Dembelay, pass into the intersection of the chain and then El-Wedi's defensive action against Reus.\n33:5 Comment: Next corner from the right again. Why should it always be the same?\n33:9 Comment: The Dortmunders think that instead of Dembelay, who is now lurking in the center, Reus will step up.\n33:14 Comment: And the next chance through Marc Bartra.\n33:17 Comment: No, through Matthias Ginter, who did that.\n33:20 Comment: They both stood next to each other.\n33:24 Comment: For the second time, the Gladbachers don't look good when the opponent takes a corner.\n33:31 Comment: Kramer is on to Ginter, but he gets the shot flawlessly.\n33:37 Comment: Half a meter was missing.\n33:39 Comment: So BVB's corners are dangerous this afternoon.\n34:23 Comment: So, Gladbach is trying to combine forward again.\n34:28 Comment: At least one throw-in is enough.\n34:30 Comment: But Nuri Sahin, yes, he's not going well anymore either.\n34:33 Comment: You can see that with slower movements.\n34:39 Comment: That would of course be bitter. Now he's been missing for months.\n34:42 Comment: Last season was practically suspended more or less completely due to inflammation in the adductor area.\n34:50 Comment: It would be nice for him to be able to play football again for at least a few months without any problems or pain.\n34:58 Comment: But Julian Weigl has already prepared himself and Dortmund will have to make a substitution ten minutes before the end of the first half.\n35:10 Comment: Yes, man, prevail against Piszczek and then there has to be money.\n35:16 Comment: Tactic is lazy, I don't think we'll talk about anything else.\n35:19 Comment: Socratis was also standing there, he could have intervened.\n35:22 Comment: Let's see here again, Piszczek follows Wendt when he receives the ball.\n35:28 Comment: And here we see that Sokratis is coming, so definitely not red.\n35:31 Comment: Yellow is exactly the right penalty for the Dortmund goalscorer to make it 2-1.\n35:37 Comment: So, now there is a change in the 36th minute and indeed, Nuri Sahin is injured.\n35:46 Comment: Hopefully the 28-year-old Turkish international didn't sustain a serious injury.\n35:54 Comment: But he can't continue any longer and that means that Julian Weigl comes into play relatively early in this game.\n36:2 Comment: And of course he will replace Nuri Sahin in this position 1 to 1.\n36:7 Comment: Raphael with the free kick for Gladbach, not a bad position.\n36:16 Comment: Yeah, I don't know if that was supposed to be a shot on goal or an assist,\" he said.\n36:22 Comment: As if he had speculated that one or two colleagues would jump in on this cross in time.\n36:28 Comment: But we were a long way from that, no problem for Roman Weidenfeller.\n36:44 Comment: Dembélé, Ah, handball from Kramer, he has to whistle.\n36:50 Comment: That's now a safe 30 meters, which is why there wasn't a direct shot towards Jan Sommer's goal.\n36:56 Comment: Yes, that's a safe 30 meters, which is why there wasn't a direct shot towards Jan Sommer's goal.\n37:26 Comment: Dembélé, ah, Wendt doesn't get the ball out of the back at first, Marc Batra has a chance to score again.\n37:43 Comment: I think he even tried to score with the inside from two, 23 meters away,\n37:51 Comment: But it was neither precise nor hard enough.\n37:58 Comment: Kramer.\n38:6 Comment: So now they have to start the next attack 10 meters beyond the center line, the Gladbachers.\n38:15 Comment: It feels like Dortmund has pulled back a bit more in the last 10 minutes.\n38:21 Comment: There is a free kick, caused by Marco Reus.\n38:26 Comment: Tomorrow we'll have the second Advent, dear viewers, so you can light the second candle on your Advent wreath.\n38:31 Comment: And of course open another door in your Advent calendar.\n38:36 Comment: And I recommend the Sky Advent calendar, there are great prizes every day, including a 55 inch UAD TV dream home in New York or Las Vegas.\n38:47 Comment: So there's something for everyone. Information at sky.de.\n38:54 Comment: So, you get up from your seats here in the east stand.\n39:19 Comment: Borussia Dortmund leads 2 to 1. I don't know what's going on either. It's kind of like the goals are broken.\n39:26 Comment: Three between the sixth and 15th minute, none since then.\n39:36 Comment: The Gladbachers are attacked immediately when they have the ball.\n39:40 Comment: The hosts now have the opportunity to counterattack via Aubameyang.\n39:43 Comment: Dembélé, still Dembélé.\n39:47 Comment: That's amazing, because the ball seems to stick to your feet.\n39:53 Comment: The Frenchman is also extremely agile.\n39:57 Comment: And as I said, I've mentioned it before, he's 19 years young.\n40:1 Comment: Huge talent for a transfer fee of 15 million euros at the start of the season.\n40:7 Comment: Race changed from France to Dortmund.\n40:11 Comment: That's something that is sometimes forgotten when assessing the Dortmund team.\n40:17 Comment: There are also a lot of young players there, with Dembélé, with Moor, to name just a few,\n40:24 Comment: who are far from being at the zenith of their abilities.\n40:28 Comment: Dortmund have also had a lot of injury problems this season, even outside of that.\n40:34 Comment: Sometimes up to nine players were missing.\n40:37 Comment: Important players, extremely long.\n40:40 Comment: If you consider that Marco Reus is in the starting line-up for the first time today on matchday 13, when he has the ball right now.\n40:46 Comment: And that against Gladbach, where he was active for three years.\n41:1 Comment: The hat, can it still be reached?\n41:4 Comment: Ginter is better positioned to the ball and also manages to prevent the corner.\n41:25 Comment: Here we have Mo the Hat.\n41:28 Comment: From the position of his feet, I would say he was more in the gatehouse.\n41:33 Comment: But we couldn't prove that.\n41:37 Comment: Definitely a close call either way.\n41:41 Comment: So, Gladbach will now make a better effort to get into the game.\n41:45 Comment: To put Roman Weidenfeller's goal in danger.\n41:50 Comment: But the goal scoring record at least at this point is very clear.\n41:54 Comment: Seven to one in favor of the black and yellow.\n41:57 Comment: And the Gladbachers can at least point to the number one and say, well at least it was there.\n42:2 Comment: And now is a good moment to take over the shots on goal.\n42:37 Comment: Well, Hazard didn't go there because he knew that if he was offside or touched the ball he would have been picked off anyway.\n42:46 Comment: Socratis, Weigel, Castro.\n42:53 Comment: Well, slow down.\n43:7 Comment: Yes, and Dortmund are leading 2-1.\n43:10 Comment: You can now clearly see that in these actions.\n43:13 Comment: If the gap isn't there, then we'll play around at the back again.\n43:16 Comment: And if necessary, again.\n43:18 Comment: Until it's there, the gap.\n43:21 Comment: The main thing is that Gladbach doesn't get possession of the ball.\n43:23 Comment: Smelter.\n43:27 Comment: Weigel.\n43:31 Comment: Günther Timbele.\n43:37 Comment: Have a good minute.\n43:42 Comment: In this first half.\n43:44 Comment: Dortmund lead 2-1 thanks to goals from Aubameyang and Piszczek after Gladbach took the lead through Rafael's strike.\n44:7 Comment: Daruth.\n44:20 Comment: Kramer, Hazard, asshole.\n44:23 Comment: Pass from Lars Stindl.\n44:26 Comment: Lars Stindl, who had one of two great chances for Borussia Mönchengladbach against Hoffenheim last Saturday.\n44:34 Comment: Free kick of course correct.\n44:36 Comment: And couldn't use it.\n44:38 Comment: Substitute Fabian Johnson had the winning goal in the second half.\n44:45 Comment: That was the big problem for Gladbach.\n44:48 Comment: Especially in the last two Bundesliga home games against Cologne.\n44:51 Comment: We should have led much higher at halftime.\n44:54 Comment: Also against Hoffenheim.\n44:56 Comment: Today it's more of a problem to lose the victory.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:1 Comment: So, Gladbach still in white and now from left to right in the second half.\n0:6 Comment: It was a bit tight, Hazard didn't have a chance to get the ball under control, the Belgian.\n0:29 Comment: Gladbach's problem in the first half was always due to André Schubert's team not exploiting their chances.\n0:39 Comment: That was to be lamented, especially in the last two home games against Cologne and Hoffenheim.\n0:44 Comment: Today there were basically no chances to score, apart from the opportunity in the sixth minute, which Gladbach immediately took advantage of through Raphael.\n0:54 Comment: So it's the opposite of last time, lots of chances, few goals, today one chance, one goal, but only one.\n1:2 Comment: And because Dortmund scored twice, that's not enough.\n1:6 Comment: Something has to be done by the Gladbachers, who had the feeling in the last ten minutes of the first half that they wanted to do a little more forward,\n1:16 Comment: But we could hardly hold our own against Dortmund's defensive work.\n1:20 Comment: Stindeln.\n1:39 Comment: Dembelé, intended for Marcel Schmelzer, who came a step too late.\n1:51 Comment: We just heard a nice story from the locker room at half-time.\n1:56 Comment: Then Thomas Tuchol, the Dortmund coach, said to Tobias Christ, the fourth referee,\n2:1 Comment: Oh, we haven't seen each other today, good sign, right?\n2:4 Comment: He was making fun of himself a bit.\n2:7 Comment: We've seen things differently in many a game in the Bundesliga.\n2:11 Comment: Thomas Tuchol, yes, not exactly reserved when it comes to emotions, when it comes to joy and anger at his team's game.\n2:21 Comment: Today he will have been much more happy than last Saturday in Frankfurt.\n2:28 Comment: And so perhaps the reference to the previous week of training didn't come entirely by chance.\n2:34 Comment: Thomas Tuchol, he said after the Frankfurt game, you could almost read it a little bit,\n2:40 Comment: The training performance after the Champions League game against Legia Warsaw in preparation for Frankfurt was not good.\n2:46 Comment: This week he spoke of an exceptionally good week of training.\n2:53 Comment: And his team is at least well on the way to achieving the three-pointer at home that they were aiming for.\n3:4 Comment: Schmelzer, Castro, Badrach.\n3:34 Comment: Incidentally, Gladbach have only scored points once this season when the team was behind.\n3:46 Comment: And that was at 1 on 1 in Leipzig.\n3:49 Comment: By the way, it's also the only away point that the Gladbach team got this season from five games.\n4:0 Comment: Away record before this game, one draw, four defeats and the whole thing was 2 goals to 13.\n4:13 Comment: Dembele, Bischek in the middle and then it's 3 to 1 through ex-Gladbach player Marco Reus.\n4:23 Comment: And that's probably why he's restrained in his celebration.\n4:28 Comment: He made it 3 to 1 in the 50th minute, that happened too quickly for Gladbach.\n4:33 Comment: Dembele was involved again and then the question arises with this entry from Bischek whether Reus was at the same height or behind the ball or not.\n4:44 Comment: If not, then it would have been off.\n4:47 Comment: Hard to tell from this shot if that was the case.\n4:51 Comment: Assistant's flag definitely stayed down.\n4:55 Comment: Hit counts and Gladbach is behind by two goals.\n5:2 Comment: But again Dembele was involved in the creation of the goal.\n5:15 Comment: Reus, who prepared Aubameyang's 1-on-1 in the 7th minute, this time as a shooter.\n5:22 Comment: First goal of the season for Marco Reus, against Gladbach of all places.\n5:27 Comment: He played 97 Bundesliga games and scored 36 goals for Gladbach between 2009 and 2012.\n5:38 Comment: Always enjoyed playing for the Gladbach team and that's probably why he refrained from celebrating a goal.\n5:49 Comment: Hare against Badr, past Badr and he somehow gets his leg in between.\n6:1 Comment: Yes and then Marco Reus also has his first Bundesliga goal this season.\n6:6 Comment: In the Champions League during the comeback he was spectacular.\n6:11 Comment: And then there were two goals and two assists from Marco Reus in the 8-4 win against Warsaw.\n6:29 Comment: So now I have to backtrack properly, dear viewers, because it was indeed out of line as we speculated about it.\n6:37 Comment: And that's why there was no goal celebration, at least not for Marco Reus.\n6:41 Comment: So don't take it against me, but it's 2 to 1 that for heaven's sake we're not celebrating Marco Reus here until that's all we can do.\n6:48 Comment: So the goal didn't count and then the assistant probably recognized that Marco Reus was in an offside position.\n6:57 Comment: And that's why Gladbach didn't go two goals behind.\n7:0 Comment: Yes, you can comment on as many games as you like, but something new always happens.\n7:37 Comment: Strobel, Kramer, Reus, the fake goalscorer.\n8:0 Comment: Yes, that was definitely a real bad pass. Raphael past Batra, Raphael and then almost Sokratis' own goal.\n8:9 Comment: So there wasn't much missing, then the Greek international would have made the game 2-2.\n8:15 Comment: The whole thing started with Marco Reus's bad pass and then Raphael did really well and had the decisive meter lead.\n8:23 Comment: And Sokratis still gets his foot there and can be happy that he didn't hit the ball a bit fuller.\n8:30 Comment: Otherwise he might slip in to make it 2-2. So there is only a corner for Borussia Mönchengladbach.\n8:37 Comment: Raphael and Christensen's header chance.\n8:42 Comment: Weidenfeller complains, it would have been a mistake.\n8:48 Comment: We look there again, there comes Tene, solid physical contact, but of course he also jumps into Weidenfeller.\n9:1 Comment: Andreas Christensen, who always goes forward in Gladbach standard situations.\n9:6 Comment: Against Roman Weidenfeller, who is playing his sixth competitive game this season today.\n9:13 Comment: Twice in the cup, twice in the Bundesliga, third time today and the Champions League game against Liga Warsaw are also part of this statistic.\n9:28 Comment: Hazard.\n9:31 Comment: Raphael and what happens now? Gladbachers demand a penalty, I think Marco Fritz didn't see it and then the assistant's flag stays down.\n9:47 Comment: Dominic Schaar is on this side, let's take a look at it again later, now we have to see what Dortmund do up front, but there's a summer here.\n9:55 Comment: So firstly the question on the other side was, was it a foul and secondly, if so, was it in a penalty area or just before it.\n10:6 Comment: The people of Gladbach definitely protested vehemently.\n10:25 Comment: Well, he'll get it. Piszczek, good eye for Obermeerjahn, our master.\n10:34 Comment: Dortmund's next chance, 56th minute through Obermeerjahn.\n10:40 Comment: But Piszczek has already been a good provider twice now, once for that offside goal from Marco Reus a few minutes ago and now again for Dortmund's next goal chance in the person of Obermeerjahn.\n10:54 Comment: Weigl, he wanted to kick him away differently and so did Raphael.\n10:58 Comment: So, let's look at the scene again, yes that was a hold against Asar by Sokratis, but in front of the penalty area, that's how I saw it and there should have been a free kick. No penalty for Borussia Mönchengladbach.\n11:28 Comment: Asar.\n11:58 Comment: The free kick came, but he thought about it for a long time, where should I play the ball and then Julian Korb couldn't get to it.\n12:29 Comment: Only Korb, who was not in the starting line-up in the last two games, in the Champions League, Asar, next attempt.\n12:37 Comment: Dortmund's Bartra and Marco Reus are now aggressive.\n12:42 Comment: Huh, and as you saw from the reaction, Thomas Tuchel doesn't agree at all with the decision to throw in Gladbach.\n12:49 Comment: That was a good ball, it was good.\n12:52 Comment: And now the last two games.\n12:55 Comment: And then it's another goal for Borussia Mönchengladbach.\n14:25 Comment: Badrah.\n14:28 Comment: Made strong.\n14:31 Comment: And then it's the melter's turn.\n14:34 Comment: It's a dangerous situation for the defender.\n14:37 Comment: Then 11 meters to blame.\n14:40 Comment: Here we look again at the possibility of Obermeier.\n14:42 Comment: Fish check, it could easily have been 3-1 for BVB.\n14:46 Comment: As usual 25,000 in the south stand.\n14:51 Comment: Next corner for Borussia Dortmund, Marco Reus.\n14:55 Comment: Looks like a short version.\n14:57 Comment: In any case, our colleague Dembélé is ready.\n15:0 Comment: But of course there are also some in the middle waiting for the ball in black and yellow.\n15:3 Comment: So still a long version.\n15:5 Comment: No problem for summer.\n15:12 Comment: Reus can do Weidenfeller's thing.\n15:19 Comment: No foul from Raphael either.\n15:23 Comment: But Dortmund are somehow still getting the hang of things.\n15:27 Comment: Oh, strong ball reception from Marco Reus.\n15:32 Comment: Weigl presented it too far.\n15:36 Comment: And now no foul from Reus against Elwini.\n15:41 Comment: Still Marco Reus.\n15:43 Comment: And then at the last moment Christensen intervenes.\n15:47 Comment: And the Gladbachers are angry because they saw a foul by Marco Reus and wanted the free kick.\n15:53 Comment: Can we take another look.\n15:55 Comment: Yes, he can take his arm out easily.\n15:57 Comment: And that causes Elwini to become unbalanced at full speed.\n16:2 Comment: And Reus finishes a bit too late.\n16:4 Comment: That's how Christensen barely gets there.\n16:7 Comment: Still shaking his head Marco Reus.\n16:12 Comment: Good chance to score here against former club Borussia Mönchengladbach.\n16:19 Comment: Corner Dembele.\n16:21 Comment: The Gladbachers don't look good at all after corners today.\n16:31 Comment: Well, there was also the question, Kramer versus Ginter, was there something there?\n16:40 Comment: But let's take another look.\n16:43 Comment: Well, Kramer is holding his hand at the back.\n16:50 Comment: Well, it wasn't all that great either.\n16:53 Comment: Of course the respective opponent always lets himself go when something like that happens.\n16:57 Comment: Hoping, well, maybe he'll see it.\n16:59 Comment: Perhaps it can be seen a little more clearly, in this case Matthias Ginter.\n17:2 Comment: But Marco Fritz doesn't decide a penalty.\n17:12 Comment: It's extremely difficult for the referees, especially in these standard situations,\n17:17 Comment: When there is pulling, holding, pushing on both sides.\n17:23 Comment: Now the Gladbachers would like to have a free kick, which doesn't exist either.\n17:28 Comment: And then Aubameyang is there.\n17:31 Comment: Dembele goes along on the right, but strong defensive behavior from Tobias Strobl.\n17:36 Comment: He also prevented Aubameyang from taking a concentrated shot\n17:41 Comment: Like a cross pass from Skabuna to his colleague Dembele.\n17:45 Comment: And so it's still 2-1 for Dortmund.\n17:48 Comment: Although, I think we agree, Dortmund are much closer to scoring their third goal\n17:57 Comment: as Gladbach equalized.\n18:3 Comment: At BVB you have the feeling that they would like to close the bag here.\n18:8 Comment: Now the pass from Reus to Dembele, still Dembele and now it counts and it's 3-1.\n18:17 Comment: And Dembele deserves it, his third goal of the season.\n18:27 Comment: It became apparent in the last few minutes that there were good chances for Borussia Dortmund,\n18:34 Comment: Aubameyang, Reus, but it hits Ousmane Dembele.\n18:39 Comment: Socrates' next strike and here's the mistake by Elwidi and Reus with the preparatory work for Dembele\n18:47 Comment: And how calm he is on the ball and how Adamo lets Dahoud get out.\n18:53 Comment: Reus also had a tunnel against Elwidi beforehand, so it's going to be big for Gladbach\n19:0 Comment: And then Dembele takes off against Jan Sommer's direction.\n19:4 Comment: 3-1 for Borussia Dortmund and based on the course of the game and the odds ratio, that's okay.\n19:13 Comment: And now you can see how important Marco Reus is, who prepared Aubameyang's 1-1\n19:23 Comment: And now Dembele's 3-1.\n19:28 Comment: So two assists for Reus in his first game in the Bundesliga, in the starting eleven this season.\n19:42 Comment: Reiner Bohnhoff and Rolf Königs, the head of the Gladbach executive committee, have embarrassing looks on their faces.\n19:49 Comment: He's looking pretty strong now, at least that's what I'm saying, after the eighth game in a row without a win.\n19:56 Comment: Reus again, Elwidi too noticeable.\n20:4 Comment: He brings so much footballing quality, overview, and creates surprising moments.\n20:11 Comment: Marco Reus.\n20:17 Comment: Dembele.\n20:20 Comment: Next chance, Batra gets the tip of his foot in, but that's not enough for the Spaniard.\n20:42 Comment: Reus, Dembele, the two of them harmonized brilliantly this afternoon.\n20:50 Comment: And that causes problems for Borussia Mönchengladbach time and time again, especially in the second half.\n20:57 Comment: Borussia Dortmund thanks 81,360 spectators, sold out.\n21:10 Comment: So, you just heard it, in the background the number of spectators, again 81,360, once again sold out, the signal in Dunapark during the Borussia duel.\n21:27 Comment: Castro.\n21:30 Comment: Aubameyang.\n21:34 Comment: Now the question is, is there anything else coming from Borussia?\n21:38 Comment: 23.5 minutes is still a lot of time, but I mentioned it at the beginning of the second half,\n21:45 Comment: The Gladbach team scored a total of three goals in the second half this season.\n21:51 Comment: And now they have to be careful again that they don't get caught in the second half,\n21:55 Comment: And now we need at least two more to at least draw.\n22:4 Comment: They've had one opportunity to score so far since Hazard's break, but that was it.\n22:10 Comment: Weigel.\n22:25 Comment: Faucet.\n22:44 Comment: There has to be understanding between Dembele and Castro, but then the mistake on the other side of the hat is on top, Dembele again.\n22:51 Comment: Dembele.\n22:52 Comment: Before Bayern Kramer.\n22:53 Comment: Dembele, Reus, the two combine as they please.\n22:58 Comment: Reus Hackentrick on Obermeer.\n23:0 Comment: A sensational goal to make it 4 to 1, 68.\n23:6 Comment: Minute.\n23:7 Comment: And not a chance, just a chance for Jan Sommer.\n23:11 Comment: But what Dembele and Reus offer here in terms of combination football in the second half is for\n23:21 Comment: 1.\n23:22 Comment: Minute.\n23:23 Comment: It's a piece of cake, even if Obermeer-Jang scores the goal in the end.\n23:24 Comment: Two for Gabuna, 15.\n23:27 Comment: Goal of the season.\n23:28 Comment: It's nice to watch it again.\n23:31 Comment: Dembele to Reus and he's now putting his heel on here for Obermeer-Jang.\n23:36 Comment: At least one Gladbacher is missing in the center of defense and 4 to 1 for Borussia Dortmund.\n23:46 Comment: It's Strobl's turn, but somehow he's far from separating Reus from the ball.\n23:52 Comment: can.\n23:53 Comment: Here he goes, the former Hoffenheimer and no one stays with Obermeer-Jang and it\n23:58 Comment: It's 4 to 1 for Dortmund.\n24:0 Comment: And now we have similar feelings to last season, when Dortmund\n24:6 Comment: We won 4 to 0 on the first matchday here against Gladbach.\n24:16 Comment: So, Borussia Mönchengladbach's goal difference, take the last 4 away games.\n24:28 Comment: Schalke, Munich, Berlin and today 1 to 13.\n24:35 Comment: Ouch.\n24:46 Comment: Yes, and now it can only be a matter of keeping the defeat within limits,\n24:53 Comment: Because Dortmund plays what it wants here.\n24:59 Comment: By the way, BVB now has the strongest offensive this season.\n25:16 Comment: Currently 31 goals, but that doesn't have to be the last word and that was\n25:23 Comment: a little too high or Obermeer-Jang too small, one of the two.\n25:35 Comment: So, we have the right Christmas present for fans, the Sky fan service in club design\n25:41 Comment: Your choice, dear viewers.\n25:43 Comment: Choose the remote control for your favorite club, of course also in the matching club colors,\n25:50 Comment: It's clear, this is the ideal Christmas present and information can be found at sky.de.\n25:57 Comment: I could imagine a few black and yellow ones being picked out today as Christmas presents.\n26:6 Comment: You can also give yourself a gift, that's not the case.\n26:14 Comment: The hat.\n26:20 Comment: So, and whatever it will be like, I don't think I'm going too far out of the window.\n26:34 Comment: We won't be talking about Dortmund's 1-2 draw in Frankfurt last Saturday\n26:41 Comment: And whether the team is able to show a reaction, I think they have\n26:44 Comment: I've already proven that a lot still needs to happen in this game.\n26:49 Comment: If things go wrong from the hosts' point of view.\n26:52 Comment: Gladbach is trying again.\n27:6 Comment: Yes, instead of course people will talk about Gladbach's negative streak continuing.\n27:11 Comment: Last win on September 24th against Ingolstadt, so in other words, Gladbach in October\n27:20 Comment: didn't win a Bundesliga game, didn't win a Bundesliga game in November and December\n27:24 Comment: It probably doesn't start well either.\n27:26 Comment: Corner Raphael, header opportunity blocked, will give the next corner.\n27:32 Comment: So, first change for the guests, announced, 73rd minute, Westergaard comes on for\n27:48 Comment: Mo Dahoud, who couldn't set any accents today, the young German-Syrian, last Saturday\n27:58 Comment: against Hoffenheim he was still a goalscorer and Westergaard could imagine him being in the defensive line\n28:4 Comment: Moves and Strobl takes over Mo Dahoud's position in midfield, we'll see soon.\n28:13 Comment: We can't judge that yet because Westergaard takes the corner kick.\n28:17 Comment: was at the front, now he's missing at the back, Dortmund comes, but Schmelzer doesn't get the ball\n28:22 Comment: As planned in the middle of the Obermeer.\n28:27 Comment: So, let's look again at the goal to make it 3 to 1, assist from Marco Reus, Dembele scores\n28:40 Comment: In the 64th minute, incidentally for the first time in his Bundesliga career, Marco Reus scored three\n28:49 Comment: He prepared the goal, only for Piszczek's goal after Dembele's corner\n28:56 Comment: He's not involved.\n28:57 Comment: Reus again, yes and again and again the uncertainties at Borussia Mönchengladbach,\n29:4 Comment: They ran like a common thread through the second half and the score was 4-1\n29:10 Comment: Particularly nice, stops Dembele, Reus, Aubameyang, 68th minute and that was it\n29:19 Comment: Probably also eliminated the last glitches in this game.\n29:27 Comment: So and at Borussia Dortmund there will be the second change, the first was yes\n29:31 Comment: Due to injury and I think if we experience that, then someone will be applauded.\n29:40 Comment: Krzysztof Pulisic is definitely getting ready down there, the 18-year-old US international.\n29:46 Comment: The last time we spent 90 minutes on the bench in Frankfurt, that won’t be the case today.\n30:16 Comment: Socratis, just high and wide and forward.\n30:46 Comment: But now not every ball has to pass, a quarter of an hour before the end.\n30:51 Comment: The opponent is three goals behind and still aggressive forechecking\n30:57 Comment: From Reus and Castro against Kramer.\n31:4 Comment: Hazard, tunnel against Schmelzer and here comes Bartra, who is physically committed,\n31:10 Comment: But always fair.\n31:12 Comment: So Krzysztof Pulisic is down there on the touchline on the other side\n31:18 Comment: Fabian Johnson is also orientated, so two US national players will be coming into the game right now.\n31:26 Comment: One for Dortmund, the other for Mönchengladbach.\n31:29 Comment: If the game is interrupted, Pulisic has been there for a long time.\n31:40 Comment: Weigel, Deschek, yes, Dortmund are taking things a little easier and Gladbach\n32:2 Comment: You get the feeling that they aren't sad at all now that they have some peace and quiet.\n32:5 Comment: Be relaxed after this offensive whirlwind, you could say between the 50th and 70th minutes\n32:14 Comment: And the goals from Dempele and Aubameyang are missing, one could actually say, almost inevitably.\n32:21 Comment: So now the ball is in touch and now we can make a substitution.\n32:35 Comment: Yes, he was starting to get cold then, Krzysztof Pulisic said he had been standing there for a few minutes.\n32:40 Comment: Thomas Thure opens the bag so that he can at least warm up his left hand a little,\n32:46 Comment: But now there's applause for the outstanding man on the pitch, you could say that,\n32:51 Comment: With three assists, Marco Reus was directly involved in goals number 1, 3 and 4 and on the other side\n33:2 Comment: Goes to score in the same 78th minute and Fabian Johnson comes in for him.\n33:10 Comment: And that means both coaches still have a change option.\n33:22 Comment: So, Pulisic orients himself to the Reus position and the other things remain the same tactically,\n33:32 Comment: Johnson right offensive side for Azar.\n33:39 Comment: Uwe Jorgen! Uwe Jorgen! Uwe Jorgen!\n33:55 Comment: Dembélé, first touch of the ball by Johnson, will give a free kick for Borussia Dortmund.\n34:4 Comment: Hanging heads among the Gladbachers, a bit symptomatic of the Gladbachers' situation.\n34:13 Comment: We didn't reach the round of 16 in the Champions League, but to be honest you had to expect that,\n34:20 Comment: Tough group caught with Barcelona, ​​with Manchester City, third place is certainly okay,\n34:27 Comment: To have asserted themselves against Celtic Glasgow, but in the Bundesliga, the Gladbachers are now lagging far behind\n34:33 Comment: behind expectations.\n34:36 Comment: Prior to this match day we were in 13th place and there's definitely no way we're going to improve.\n34:42 Comment: Westergaard with a very risky back pass, 13 points after 13 games,\n34:49 Comment: The bottom line is that that's far from Gladbach's possibilities.\n34:55 Comment: And even if they did it last season, as you could from last place in the table,\n35:2 Comment: Gladbach started with five defeats in a row until Lucien Favre resigned,\n35:7 Comment: If you get into the Champions League, that doesn't happen every year.\n35:11 Comment: And now it's not the fifth, but the 13th matchday.\n35:15 Comment: And whether you can regain your lost self-confidence on Tuesday in the Champions League in Barcelona\n35:22 Comment: I can get it back again, I'll leave that to the matter.\n35:26 Comment: Last tasks for Gladbach before the winter break, at home against Mainz in Augsburg\n35:30 Comment: and home game against Wolfsburg.\n35:32 Comment: Ah, the WD slipped a bit, but he's not running into anything, Johnson thinks the ball will get through,\n35:37 Comment: Castro prevents that, Budi Silic for Schmelzer.\n35:42 Comment: Counterfeit.\n35:44 Comment: And now the WD.\n35:46 Comment: The WD slipped a bit but doesn't run into anything, Johnson thinks the ball will get through,\n35:51 Comment: Castro prevents that, Budi Silic for Schmelzer.\n35:56 Comment: Counterfeit.\n36:13 Comment: So, last change at Borussia Mönchengladbach.\n36:16 Comment: One for the offense, which we saw next to nothing of in the second half.\n36:22 Comment: Goalscorer Raphael, it looked so good for Borussia Mönchengladbach after six minutes,\n36:27 Comment: when he made it 1 to 0.\n36:29 Comment: And like against Hoffenheim, Andre Hahn comes on as a joker, the whole thing in the 82nd minute.\n36:35 Comment: Andre Schubert has changed three times.\n36:37 Comment: So, on Tuesday from 10.45 p.m. there will be extremely interesting things on Sky Sport 2 HD.\n36:44 Comment: Project Provo, the current boss of Bayern Munich,\n36:47 Comment: who deals with the new team and the new coach,\n37:2 Comment: Project Provi, part 6, four boys on their way to the Bundesliga.\n37:11 Comment: For four years we watched three highly talented boys move towards their dream career in football,\n37:18 Comment: with different conditions, with different successes.\n37:24 Comment: Jonathan Tah from Bayer 04 Leverkusen,\n37:27 Comment: Sinan Kurt from FC Bayern, Ralf Husic from VfRA.\n37:32 Comment: A very interesting story, very interesting development for all three.\n37:37 Comment: The whole thing, as I said, Project Provi, Tuesday from 10.45 p.m.\n37:44 Comment: The Provi project at Borussia Dortmund worked well today.\n37:50 Comment: This applies to experienced people who have already had a lot of success,\n37:54 Comment: like Marco Reus with his three assists.\n37:57 Comment: But that also applies to Dembele, who scored and prepared a goal himself today.\n38:3 Comment: And who harmonized outstandingly with Marco Reus in the second round.\n38:12 Comment: Now they try a little more, but the air is already a little out,\n38:17 Comment: Here in the last minutes in Dortmund.\n38:20 Comment: The points are distributed, the black and yellow people know that just as much as the white ones.\n38:34 Comment: And maybe the people of Gladbach will slowly but surely change their minds too\n38:40 Comment: We need to move downwards in the table.\n38:44 Comment: Before this Spätach we were still five points ahead of 16th

    "summary": "Borussia Dortmund's 4-1 Bundesliga victory over Borussia Mönchengladbach at Signal Iduna Park on a vibrant evening showcased the resiliency and firepower of Thomas Tuchel's squad. Both teams went into the match seeking redemption, with Dortmund aiming to close the gap on the league leaders, Bayern Munich, and Mönchengladbach looking to turn around a poor run of form.\n\nThe match commenced with Borussia Dortmund, donned in their iconic black and yellow kits, attacking from left to right. Despite their recent mixed performances at home where they drew 0-0 against Schalke and narrowly beat FC Bayern 1-0, Dortmund showed signs of their attacking intent early on. The team had come off a thrilling 8-4 Champions League match against Legia Warsaw, providing hope that they could rediscover their offensive prowess.\n\nDortmund exerted immediate pressure on Mönchengladbach, testing the visitors' defense and goalkeeper Yann Sommer. Mönchengladbach, employing a five-man defensive line with Tobias Strobl joining forces at the back, aimed to stifle Dortmund's build-ups. Yet, it was Dortmund initiating the action, with Aubameyang and Reus, who were part of the high-scoring encounter against Warsaw, looking to break the deadlock early.\n\nIt was in the sixth minute that Dortmund's defense was caught off guard. A fluid move saw Mönchengladbach advance via Wendt, who delivered a precise cross that fell to Raphael. The Brazilian striker calmly slotted the ball past Roman Weidenfeller, putting the visitors 1-0 ahead much to the delight of their fans.\n\nHowever, Dortmund's response was rapid. Only 59 seconds later, the home side equalized. An incisive build-up play initiated by Dembele and capitalized on by Reus, who beat two defenders before setting up Aubameyang. The Gabonese forward, displaying his predatory instincts, tapped the ball in from close range, leveling the score at 1-1 and netting his 14th goal of the season. This swift reply seemed to epitomize Dortmund's attacking philosophy under Tuchel – relentless and efficient.\n\nThe game continued at a frantic pace, with both teams looking to assert dominance. Midway through the half, another moment of brilliance from Dortmund turned the match on its head. A corner taken by Dembele saw the ball eventually land with Lukas Piszczek. The Polish defender took full advantage, calmly directing his header past Yann Sommer to make it 2-1 in favor of the hosts. This goal reaffirmed Piszczek's utility, not just as a defender but also as an occasional scorer.\n\nDespite the initial setback, Mönchengladbach tried to regroup, with Raphael at the heart of their attacking endeavors. But Dortmund's solid defensive setup, led by Sokratis and Marc Bartra, thwarted any meaningful threats. As the half progressed, it became clear that Dortmund's game plan was effective; the Gladbach defense struggled to contain their fast-paced and fluid attacking trio of Aubameyang, Reus, and Dembele. Just before halftime, an injury forced Nuri Sahin off the pitch, with Julian Weigl replacing him. Despite this enforced change, Dortmund maintained their momentum.\n\nThe second half began with Mönchengladbach eager to alter the narrative. They started brightly but once again found it challenging to breach Dortmund's defense. Their woes were compounded in the 50th minute when Dortmund extended their lead. Ousmane Dembele, who had been a persistent threat throughout the match, contributed an assist. His cross was met with Reus, who had calmly positioned himself to finish into the net, making it 3-1. Though there were moments of hesitation regarding the legality of the goal due to potential offside concerns, it stood, further sinking Mönchengladbach.\n\nMönchengladbach showed a hint of a comeback, with Raphael nearly causing an own goal via Sokratis. This scare was fleeting as Dortmund quickly regained control. A few minutes later, another quick interplay between Reus and Dembele led to Dortmund's fourth goal. Dembele showed his individual brilliance by evading defenders and delivering a finely placed shot past Sommer, engraving 3-1 on the scoreboard.\n\nDortmund continued to mesmerize with their synchronized attacks. The compelling teamwork see Aubameyang benefiting from Reus' deft touches. Reus’ back-heeled pass found Aubameyang in the 68th minute, who converted it gracefully to make it 4-1. This combination illustrated the telepathic understanding between Dortmund's attackers, rendering Gladbach's defense helpless.\n\nThis fourth goal effectively sealed Mönchengladbach's fate. Their defensive frailties re-emerged, creating a sense of inevitability about the match's outcome. For Mönchengladbach, the game was now about damage limitation rather than seeking an improbable comeback. Bundesliga campaign, their away form had been abysmal, and this encounter seemed a continuation of that trend.\n\nThomas Tuchel took the opportunity to make further changes. Christian Pulisic replaced the outstanding Marco Reus, who received a warm ovation from the Dortmund faithful. The young American slotted seamlessly into the attacking setup, further exemplifying Dortmund's depth of talent.\n\nMönchengladbach, despite the introduction of fresh legs like Andre Hahn, struggled to mount any serious challenge. Their attacking efforts were stifled, and they could not convert their minimal chances. The final moments of the game saw Dortmund comfortably control possession, maintaining their three-goal cushion.\n\nIn summary, Borussia Dortmund's 4-1 triumph over Borussia Mönchengladbach was a testament to their attacking prowess and ability to bounce back from early setbacks. Aubameyang and Reus were instrumental, showcasing their goal-scoring and play-making skills. Dembele's youthful exuberance and effectiveness were crucial, illustrating why he is considered one of the most promising talents in world football.\n\nFor Mönchengladbach, the match highlighted their struggles, particularly defensively, and their inability to consistently convert chances. Their early lead offered a glimmer of hope, but Dortmund's relentless pressure and tactical superiority ultimately overwhelmed them.\n\nDortmund’s dominant performance sends a clear signal of their intent to challenge for top positions in the Bundesliga, while Mönchengladbach has considerable introspection and improvement ahead to turn their season around. With players like Dembele and Reus in form, Dortmund looks poised for a promising future, both domestically and in European competitions."
