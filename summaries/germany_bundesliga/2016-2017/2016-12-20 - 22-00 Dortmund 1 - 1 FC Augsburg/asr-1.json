a back four with Ginter on the right, with Bartra, Merino in the center, with Schmelzer\n0:24 Comment: on the left, Weigel and Götze in the center.\n0:27 Comment: Dembelé behind Aubameyang, Kargaba on the left, Pulisic on the right.\n0:31 Comment: So more of a 4-2-3-1.\n0:33 Comment: But everything is so quick and variable at Borussia Dortmund that the basic order\n0:39 Comment: can and will change within a few moments.\n0:41 Comment: So, that's the Augsburg concept.\n0:44 Comment: Conquer the ball and then go for it.\n0:56 Comment: Augsburg is also stable when it comes to results.\n1:5 Comment: That's why it surprised some people that Dirk Schuster, the coach of the year, was leaving\n1:10 Comment: had to a week ago.\n1:11 Comment: Last six games two wins, three draws, only one defeat and in these six games\n1:18 Comment: Only two goals conceded.\n1:23 Comment: Verhaag against Kargaba.\n1:26 Comment: Bartra, Ginter.\n1:28 Comment: At Augsburg I see a five-man chain against the ball, because Teigl is at the back on the left, Stafelidis\n1:53 Comment: and Verhaag supports.\n1:54 Comment: So Teigl on the left, then Stafelidis, Hinteregger, Raulejo and Verhaag.\n2:3 Comment: Four in front and G at the front.\n2:8 Comment: So it's 5-4-1 for FC Augsburg against the ball.\n2:13 Comment: He'll melt it.\n2:24 Comment: Ginter with Pulisic.\n2:27 Comment: Dembele.\n2:30 Comment: His speed here is sometimes breathtaking, as is his interaction with Götze.\n2:34 Comment: And then a little too much driving in the pass for Marcel Schmelzer.\n2:41 Comment: Now let's look at BVB against the ball.\n2:55 Comment: Strikingly, of course, Aubameyang with a very, very early attack against Hinteregger.\n3:0 Comment: After breaking his nose ball a few weeks ago, he was still equipped with a protective mask against\n3:6 Comment: his former club Borussia Mönchengladbach last weekend.\n3:9 Comment: The winning goal scorer for FCA.\n3:14 Comment: There's Bartra.\n3:18 Comment:  Schmelzer received the ball well against Verhaag.\n3:24 Comment: Weigel, Dembele.\n3:28 Comment:  Dembélé, very, very close control of the ball, head always up, clear view for the man next to him.\n3:34 Comment: Now Augsburg, Gie against Bartra.\n3:35 Comment: Gie is alone though.\n3:39 Comment: And have to try it alone too.\n3:43 Comment: And there is the first corner for the guests early in the evening.\n3:46 Comment: Dong-Won Gie, South Korean international, was in Dortmund for a few months between July\n3:52 Comment:  and December 2014, also due to injury, only five Bundesliga games for the\n3:57 Comment: BVB completed.\n3:59 Comment: Bartra was still there and the first corner so Jonathan Schmid would come in shortly\n4:5 Comment:  becomes.\n4:7 Comment: And Dortmund defends these set pieces with man-to-man coverage.\n4:15 Comment: In Freiburg he was once an expert in this department, Jonathan Schmid, Bartra.\n4:29 Comment: Rowe Leo, Stavridis and Hitz, consistently good this season as Swiss national goalkeepers.\n4:38 Comment: Ginter versus Moravec.\n4:43 Comment: So at BVB it's actually more of a three-man chain at the back, with Bartra in the middle and Merino on the left,\n4:48 Comment:  Gie.\n4:51 Comment: And then the second corner, which we have already seen.\n4:53 Comment: BVB actually has more of a three-man chain at the back, with Bartra in the middle and Merino on the left,\n4:58 Comment: Ginter on the right and against the ball, Pulisic on the right and Schmelzer complete the whole thing\n5:3 Comment: a row of five.\n5:9 Comment: So there's Manuel Baum, head of the youth training center in Augsburg and who was called up at short notice\n5:18 Comment: Dirk Schuster nominated.\n5:20 Comment: The question will be whether he will look after FC Augsburg in the second half of the season.\n5:25 Comment: That's out of the question with Thomas Tuchel, he said we have to do it again,\n5:29 Comment: to reach the ceiling in terms of performance.\n5:34 Comment: And if you look at the table, three points wouldn't be so bad in this one\n5:38 Comment: last home game of 2016.\n5:41 Comment:  Verhack.\n5:54 Comment: Hinteregger.\n5:57 Comment: For Teigl, who is offside, Teigl then turns from a left-back into one\n6:3 Comment: Left offensives when in possession of the ball.\n6:6 Comment: Here the moment of releasing the ball is the correct decision.\n6:12 Comment: Idol with Merino.\n6:28 Comment: Merino, Aubameyang, Dembele.\n6:31 Comment: Stafelidis in between, Schie.\n6:52 Comment: BVB at home in 2016, if you look at it that way, that was a very good decision.\n6:58 Comment: BVB at home in 2016, if you exclude the Supercup, the 0-2 against Bayern, in competitive games\n7:6 Comment: Without defeat, 17 wins, 7 draws, the last time a series like this happened was in 1965, 51 years ago.\n7:17 Comment: And when Thomas Tuchel was confronted with it at the final conference, he was just\n7:21 Comment: Became awe-struck, I said, that almost makes me a bit superstitious.\n7:27 Comment: Now Götze with Cargava, Merino with Schmelzer and with Cargava.\n7:58 Comment:  Well played through to Götze, Cargava starts into the room, Götze again, Götze,\n8:4 Comment: Post, first really strong offensive action from Borussia Dortmund, it's nine minutes\n8:10 Comment: used until Götze's graduation.\n8:14 Comment: Here he has a bit of misel against three, then he hits the post, Hitz was there in the\n8:21 Comment: Eck, the question is whether he would have been down there so quickly.\n8:24 Comment: So it was the first good chance for Borussia Dortmund, because there was still an Augsburg player who missed out\n8:30 Comment: Gotze's finish gives BVB a corner, Dembele.\n8:34 Comment: Here again, he actually wanted to include Cargava in the game, and then,\n8:40 Comment: I think Dominic Core is still there before the ball hits the post.\n8:49 Comment: That was a good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good,\n8:55 Comment: good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good,\n9:3 Comment: I would say that Marvin Hitz had good opportunities, or would have good opportunities\n9:8 Comment: I had the ability to get the ball even if it finished a little further away from the post\n9:17 Comment: would have been.\n9:32 Comment: Behind Eggers ball for G and Teigl, very, very interesting figure here, Teigl with his\n9:43 Comment: Starting eleven debut in the Bundesliga, promoted from Leipzig last summer with RB\n9:48 Comment: In the first league, against the ball he is a left-back and then he has to be very tactical,\n9:52 Comment: He reacts very quickly when he wins the ball, and when he wins the ball he also reacts very quickly\n9:56 Comment: to a licks outside and the formation changes.\n10:2 Comment: And in this initial phase he is already coaching a wolf, Manuel Baum, the 37-year-old\n10:26 Comment: Landshut.\n10:32 Comment: So, there's room for Kagawa, Bayern is trying to get into the duel with the Japanese\n10:44 Comment: Kagawa for Denbele and the foul by Joao Leó, Jeffrey Joao Leó, the one from Alkmaar\n10:57 Comment: came, yes, at this speed a close contact is enough, he doesn't have the ball\n11:6 Comment: Played, so the free kick is okay.\n11:8 Comment: And Marvin Hitzweiß for someone like Aubameyang, for example, this is short distance, this\n11:17 Comment: 25 meters.\n11:48 Comment: then falls down, one meter in front of the Augsburg shot man, next opportunity for him\n11:57 Comment: BVB.\n11:58 Comment: And the game in this initial phase developed in the same way as, in principle, all of them did\n12:3 Comment: We imagined that Augsburg would really try to get the ball at the beginning of this game\n12:9 Comment: To stay far away from Marvin Hitz, to avoid conceding an early goal, with a lot of possession there.\n12:16 Comment: They try to play variably, sometimes over the sides, often over the center, where\n12:21 Comment: With Kagawa, Götze and Weigl they are of course very strong and strong in terms of football.\n12:32 Comment: And with the outside up high, Schmelzer on the left, Pulisic on the right.\n12:37 Comment: There's Aubameyang, Denbele, a lot of ball action in this early phase.\n12:46 Comment: Moravec, Verhaag for Moravec, Merino in between.\n13:5 Comment: This is Dominic Cor, who had to take a break against Gladbach because of a yellow-red card.\n13:15 Comment: The ball is gone, the ball is gone, the ball is gone, the ball is gone, the ball is gone.\n13:27 Comment: The ball is gone, the ball is gone, the ball is gone, the ball is gone.\n13:39 Comment: Denbele, Moravec in between.\n13:49 Comment: Difficult receiving the ball, he solved it well.\n13:55 Comment: He's now calling for a yellow card because he says it was a tactical foul and so wrong.\n14:1 Comment: Isn't the South Korean lying?\n14:3 Comment: It's a good ball, he solved it well.\n14:7 Comment: Martra, very experienced, even at a young age, assessed and recognized this situation very quickly,\n14:13 Comment: that he would no longer have been able to follow the speed of G.\n14:17 Comment: But you just don't do that.\n14:19 Comment: It's unfair to then demand yellow for your opponent.\n14:23 Comment: And Winkmann has given up on it for the time being, maybe even for the last time.\n14:27 Comment: G again with Moravec.\n14:31 Comment: Stafelidis.\n14:35 Comment: A new free kick for FCA.\n14:45 Comment:  Pulisic.\n15:3 Comment: Jonathan Schmid.\n15:5 Comment: Not bad.\n15:9 Comment: I think that Hinteregger was there last.\n15:11 Comment: Martin Hinteregger, very, very expensive.\n15:13 Comment: The Augsburg team had to transfer 10 million euros to the RB Salzburg account.\n15:21 Comment: If you like, the first serious conclusion for Augsburg,\n15:25 Comment: Of course they try to get a lot of free kicks here because they have Schmid,\n15:29 Comment: Moravec also has experts for these dormant balls.\n15:33 Comment: And in the header game, well, with Kowalew and Hinteregger, they might be hoping for a lot.\n15:40 Comment: Scheih is also very strong in the header.\n15:43 Comment: After a quarter of an hour, Dortmund have two really good opportunities.\n15:47 Comment: Götze hit the woodwork, Aubameyang with a free kick from distance.\n15:53 Comment: Augsburg does well overall, just 5-4-1 against the ball.\n15:58 Comment: Try not to give up a lot of space, is quick to get on the ball and on the ball.\n16:4 Comment: But everything can't be averted.\n16:6 Comment: Dortmund's players are too strong individually and they combine too confidently in this initial phase.\n16:37 Comment: Thomas Ducke is upset because Schieh was offside at the moment Stavridis passed the ball.\n16:46 Comment: And that the tops didn't punish.\n16:51 Comment: Free kick again.\n16:54 Comment: Guido Wittmann whistles very consistently here, many people like petty judgments.\n17:1 Comment: But this is a free kick, there is relatively little basis for discussion.\n17:11 Comment: And if a referee blows his whistle, at least it's a guide that the players can follow.\n17:20 Comment: But he just has to stick it out.\n17:23 Comment: Free kick for the guests, Jonathan Schmid again.\n17:31 Comment: Moravec, that should be offside.\n17:37 Comment: Hinteregger shouldn't go there like that anymore.\n17:43 Comment: Missed here again, Moravec, actually a good footballer, great technician.\n17:48 Comment: And here are four Augsburg players offside.\n17:52 Comment: Hinteregger too.\n18:1 Comment: Moravec.\n18:7 Comment: Augsburg is becoming a little bolder, is setting up early, is now getting the second balls.\n18:13 Comment: Strongest offensive phase for the guests.\n18:32 Comment: Dough.\n18:34 Comment: So as I said, very interesting personality and position.\n18:38 Comment: Dough.\n18:41 Comment: It's also difficult for Borussia Dortmund to react to that.\n18:44 Comment:  Malesa, back left, then front left again.\n18:46 Comment: Who takes him, who takes over him, who is responsible for Teigl?\n18:51 Comment:  Staffelidis with Moravec.\n19:13 Comment: Complete the last exercises.\n19:15 Comment: Stavridis with Moravec.\n19:27 Comment: G.\n19:28 Comment: Idol Polisic.\n19:46 Comment: Center is space.\n19:47 Comment: The Kagawa Polisic.\n19:49 Comment: Obermeyer is there.\n19:50 Comment: Kagawa with us.\n19:51 Comment: Takes a bit long.\n19:54 Comment:  Had to play earlier.\n19:57 Comment: If you would like an alternative program,\n19:59 Comment: or maybe you just want to watch another football game,\n20:2 Comment: which runs parallel, I recommend our second card campaign.\n20:10 Comment: More information at sky.de-zweikarte.\n20:14 Comment: No compromises when it comes to sport.\n20:21 Comment:  We are on our way.\n20:33 Comment:  1.69 m.\n20:36 Comment: I used to be a goalkeeper.\n20:40 Comment: We want to aim for maximum points.\n21:21 Comment: The goalkeeper has run in.\n21:27 Comment: There was more to it.\n21:37 Comment: Peter Egger.\n22:49 Comment: WIC game.\n22:59 Comment: Norwayner.\n23:2 Comment: Basket for Hague.\n23:9 Comment: Augsburgers do very well against the ball, in my opinion.\n23:13 Comment: Decent division of space, they help each other, are good in duels.\n23:17 Comment: And there G, maybe a chance.\n23:19 Comment: Badrak will get the skull in the way.\n23:37 Comment: Ginter and Dembélé.\n23:40 Comment:  Schmelzer starts on the far left, Dembélé with his speed and ball control.\n23:46 Comment:  Against two.\n23:50 Comment: Kagawa and Moravec.\n24:15 Comment:  Schmelzer, Obermeyer, Ginter for Haag.\n24:45 Comment: Götze, Hinterelger and Moravec.\n24:58 Comment: Weigl, Schmelzer is behind.\n25:0 Comment: Against Verhaag, sorry.\n25:6 Comment: Merino, pressure comes from Schmid.\n25:8 Comment:  Schmelzer, Götze, who often moves to the left side when in possession of the ball.\n25:19 Comment: There is little space in the midfield, so other solutions are needed.\n25:24 Comment: The same applies to Dembélé.\n25:28 Comment: Moravec and free kick for BVB.\n25:38 Comment:  Schmelzer, Götze, the flank.\n25:41 Comment: The ball is shot from the cross.\n25:44 Comment: Götze, the ball back.\n26:2 Comment: Marcel Schmelzer with his left.\n26:6 Comment: Towards Marwin Hitz.\n26:14 Comment: Not so dangerous.\n26:16 Comment: It didn't look particularly spectacular at first.\n26:19 Comment: But Hitz still had to go there.\n26:22 Comment: Everyone's degree is completely coordinated with the jackal.\n26:27 Comment: We'll take another look.\n26:32 Comment: In the pharmaking of the eventual trigger min IRNE.\n26:35 Comment: which they had brought to an end.\n26:42 Comment:  Schmelzer, Götze, the ball back.\n26:45 Comment: Götze, the ball back.\n26:51 Comment: And Merino with the margin.\n27:15 Comment: Pulisic on the left.\n27:18 Comment: Then it wasn't cleared optimally from Hinteregger into the center, right at Miquel's foot.\n27:25 Comment: Merino.\n27:26 Comment: But it means right on the money.\n27:28 Comment: We see how clearly the Spaniard missed FC Augsburg's goal.\n28:18 Comment: By the way, the header came from Pulisic, not Merino.\n28:21 Comment: The colleagues took a closer look at it again.\n28:23 Comment: This is Bartra with the belay.\n28:35 Comment: Stafelidis is there immediately, as is Morabec.\n28:38 Comment: And the belay.\n28:42 Comment: That's also poorly defended.\n28:47 Comment: Idol is coming there.\n28:48 Comment: Oh, Rogoleos is trying to defend himself.\n28:56 Comment: But just like Hinteregger cleared in the center earlier.\n28:59 Comment: And that makes Borussia Dortmund's second line possible.\n29:4 Comment:  Merino before, now Götze to finish there.\n29:8 Comment: Augsburg were very deep in their own 16-meter area in this phase.\n29:13 Comment: Robert Millian quickly straight for Kagawa.\n29:15 Comment: And Hitz can barely get his fists up.\n29:18 Comment: And that's the only way it can work.\n29:23 Comment: With fast, ideally flat direct play.\n29:26 Comment: Otherwise the Augsburg defense is very, very stable.\n29:31 Comment: And there's Ghi, he's got a lot of speed.\n29:33 Comment: Seems to be faster than Bartra.\n29:35 Comment: But whoever solves it well.\n29:39 Comment: And something dares to happen.\n29:49 Comment: Stafelidis, full-time left-back.\n29:55 Comment: You saw how far up front it was disruptive.\n29:57 Comment:  And it was worth it.\n29:58 Comment: He's lying on the ground in Augsburg.\n30:1 Comment: Now the ball is played out to sides.\n30:3 Comment: And it's Daniel Bayer.\n30:14 Comment: Daniel Bayer can be cared for.\n30:16 Comment: We're looking at this opportunity again.\n30:19 Comment: This quick, direct game from Götze to Kagawa.\n30:22 Comment: The ball ended up being a bit too central.\n30:25 Comment: The ball came from Robert Millian.\n30:30 Comment: And that's this free kick situation.\n30:33 Comment: Or rather the action in which Daniel Bayer hurt himself.\n30:39 Comment: But it's standing again.\n30:40 Comment: Perhaps the best footballer to wear FC Augsburg.\n30:46 Comment: With a strategically very important position.\n30:50 Comment: Dteigel offside.\n30:51 Comment: So, half an hour.\n30:59 Comment: Difficult game for Borussia Dortmund.\n31:1 Comment: Because Augsburg does a very good job defensively.\n31:4 Comment: Nevertheless, Thomas Tuchel's team finished well.\n31:8 Comment: Lastly Kagawa and Pulisic.\n31:10 Comment: Robert Millian too.\n31:11 Comment: Götze in the early stages with an aluminum hit.\n31:14 Comment: In contrast, Hinteregger and Morabeck for Augsburg.\n31:17 Comment: Manuel Baum's team is not hiding.\n31:20 Comment: Play a consistent 5-4-1 against the ball.\n31:23 Comment: But when it comes to switching, they're quick with Schmid.\n31:27 Comment: You have a good footballer.\n31:29 Comment: With Bayer, Morabeck and Coa.\n31:31 Comment: They are very assertive in duels.\n31:35 Comment: In that respect, this 0-0 is okay.\n31:37 Comment: Even if Borussia Dortmund has a greater number of chances\n31:41 Comment: played out.\n31:42 Comment: But they have to work hard.\n31:44 Comment: You need top form on the day to beat today's opponent.\n31:48 Comment: There are a lot of interruptions.\n31:50 Comment: That's because there are a lot of combinations and players\n31:55 Comment: BVB are often too fast in 1-on-1 situations.\n31:59 Comment: For FC Augsburg.\n32:1 Comment: And we're a little too late here against Belay.\n32:6 Comment: That was a good ball.\n32:46 Comment: 3rd goal of the season.\n33:0 Comment: That was Bartra's crucial mistake.\n33:2 Comment: With the first attempt, Weidenfeller got to it, ultimately Ginter was too late.\n33:7 Comment: But it was also difficult to get there.\n33:11 Comment: And Augsburg is leading and Dortmund is once again behind.\n33:15 Comment: The big topic of the last few weeks.\n33:17 Comment: In the last, I think, seven competitive games, Dortmund have been behind six times.\n33:24 Comment: And that takes strength and it always takes overcoming and persuasion,\n33:30 Comment: To run after this deficit and to play and fight against the result.\n33:34 Comment: So quite a surprising result after a good half hour.\n33:38 Comment: Gies goal and Augsburg leads in Dortmund.\n33:49 Comment:  Numero Mellan slipped.\n33:51 Comment: Merino with the mistake.\n33:53 Comment: And then with the foul play.\n33:55 Comment: He probably played the ball too.\n33:57 Comment: Then the question is always what came first, the ball or the opponent.\n34:21 Comment: Toulizic.\n34:24 Comment: He did it.\n36:21 Comment:  That was exciting.\n36:23 Comment: Take it to –\n36:39 Comment: Yield\n36:49 Comment: Dembele again.\n36:50 Comment: That was clean from Teigl.\n36:54 Comment: Ginter.\n36:55 Comment: Aubameyang dodged to the side.\n36:58 Comment: With Ginter against Stafelidis.\n37:1 Comment:  Corner for BVB.\n37:19 Comment: Dembele.\n37:26 Comment: Aubameyang with the finish and heat.\n37:31 Comment: I would like to suggest a consistently strong season for the Swiss national goalkeeper.\n37:37 Comment: Statistically has the five best values ​​in the first league.\n37:43 Comment: Only 16 in 15 matches.\n37:45 Comment: Played six clean sheets against Torrat.\n37:47 Comment: Smelter.\n38:1 Comment: He has a more central role since Pulisic moved to the left side.\n38:17 Comment: We must have talked about it.\n38:24 Comment: Augsburg is very solid away from home.\n38:28 Comment: They only scored six goals.\n38:34 Comment: Since last weekend they have been hoping that the home weakness will happen.\n38:40 Comment: Before the win against Mönchengladbach they only won once.\n38:44 Comment: As a team and club that is fighting relegation,\n38:49 Comment: What counts most is the three points.\n38:54 Comment: The team is in the first league.\n38:56 Comment: You're in the premier league.\n39:23 Comment: Does it come in carry?\n39:27 Comment: It comes in carry.\n39:33 Comment: It comes with waiting pearl.\n39:37 Comment: Bartra basket.\n39:43 Comment: Then with the bad pass.\n39:49 Comment: Except for the fact that Moravec grasped the situation very quickly and G in second\n39:55 Comment: Attempt to get past Weidenfeller.\n40:20 Comment: First mistake in the build-up of the game.\n40:22 Comment: Dembele.\n40:25 Comment: Merino helped.\n40:28 Comment: And only four and a half minutes until the break.\n40:30 Comment: Dembele.\n40:32 Comment: With Kagawa.\n40:35 Comment: Smelter.\n40:37 Comment: And then this game.\n40:47 Comment: Smelter.\n40:50 Comment: Verhaak has oriented himself away and Aubameyang has the biggest thing on his head.\n40:55 Comment: That was a blatant tactical mistake by Verhaak on the right because he was\n41:0 Comment: oriented away from the ball-carrying melter.\n41:2 Comment: Aubameyang climbs really high but doesn't hit the ball accurately.\n41:8 Comment: But always be careful when complaining to Aubameyang.\n41:11 Comment: 20 games this season, 20 goals for Gabuna.\n41:15 Comment: So it's on target, to put it carefully.\n41:37 Comment: Jürgen Pelle stuck to the left wing.\n42:7 Comment: Dortmund used more of a back four in the last few minutes.\n42:15 Comment: With Schmelzer, Merino, Bartra and Ginter.\n42:20 Comment: But again, that changes almost every second.\n42:24 Comment: Smelter.\n42:25 Comment: Bartra.\n42:27 Comment:  Pulisic.\n42:41 Comment: Ginter, against Teigl and Pulisic, past Moraweg, past Bayert.\n42:48 Comment: Pulisic is great.\n42:49 Comment: It was...\n42:50 Comment: Pulisic is great, that run, but the cross is a bit too far north for\n42:56 Comment:  Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.\n42:57 Comment: Dembélé and Götze.\n43:1 Comment: Yes, maybe if he can pass the ball now, Pulisic to Ginter.\n43:13 Comment: So there is only corner for Borussia Dortmund.\n43:17 Comment: The cross came from Götze simply chipped in, then was not well defended by Hinteregger,\n43:22 Comment: who didn't really get behind the ball.\n43:23 Comment: I think Pulisic even wanted to take off.\n43:27 Comment: The corner through Kagawa.\n43:28 Comment: Ginter.\n43:29 Comment: And then Pulisic is there again.\n43:33 Comment: Hitz won't get there then.\n43:34 Comment: And now at least the BVB fans here are demanding.\n43:37 Comment: Eleven meters for your own team.\n43:47 Comment: So, here's the scene again.\n44:5 Comment: Yes, choir against Bartha.\n44:7 Comment: The arm certainly doesn't belong there.\n44:9 Comment: Prevents him from getting up.\n44:20 Comment: So Bartha doesn't get to the header very smoothly.\n44:25 Comment: The question then is, is that enough for a penalty or would it be an eventual penalty?\n44:31 Comment: The sentence is too harsh.\n44:34 Comment: But follow the rules.\n44:36 Comment: I always have problems when the referees judge things like that, because such a thing\n44:40 Comment: A foul in midfield is automatically a free kick for the other team.\n44:43 Comment: And then I ask myself why there is no penalty in a situation in the 16-meter area.\n44:47 Comment: So it's certainly debatable, but I would say that the Augsburgers would have\n44:54 Comment: Can't defend myself here, can't complain if Winkmann goes for a penalty\n44:59 Comment: BVB.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: chain of four with bender and merino in the center with children on the right with melter on the left\n0:9 Comment: Let's see how much this will change in the course of the second round Augsburg\n0:15 Comment: personnel without changes of the FCA from left to right Borussia Dortmund on the south stand\n0:22 Comment: to play in black and yellow and with Götz\n0:29 Comment: the bender with children and the right\n0:38 Comment: and Hinteregger, who is very attentive, has 23 careless mistakes in his\n0:42 Comment: defensive play and in this situation in time before Kagawa\n0:50 Comment: goetz schmelzer\n0:52 Comment: Augsburg is basically missing a complete offensive with Boba Díaz with Finn Bogason with\n1:7 Comment: kaiui and as kagawa with the cheap tea\n1:15 Comment: that was too fast for the defenders of FCA 47\n1:22 Comment: it is the fourth season for usmann the cheap\n1:29 Comment: forwarded one goes very quickly between the cheap and kagawa\n1:33 Comment: short is a bit there is no longer in the duel and the

    "summary": "Borussia Dortmund hosted FC Augsburg at Signal Iduna Park in a match that ended in a thrilling 1-1 draw, characterized by intense moments, tactical battles, and bursts of individual brilliance. The game began on an exciting note from the very first minute, with FC Augsburg, adorned in white, setting up a strategic stance against Borussia Dortmund’s dynamic approach.\n\nDortmund immediately showcased their tactical variability and high tempo. Initially setting up in a 4-2-3-1 formation, the side demonstrated a flexible strategy with the players seamlessly shifting positions. The defensive line included Ginter on the right, Bartra and Merino in the center, with Schmelzer on the left. Weigel and Götze controlled the midfield, while Dembelé operated behind Aubameyang, with Pulisic on the right and Kargaba on the left. The fluidity of their setup often saw swift transitions that tested Augsburg’s defensive structure.\n\nAugsburg also showed tactical awareness, frequently forming a 5-4-1 against the ball with Teigl dropping back to form a five-man defensive chain. The guests from Bavaria exhibited resilience from the start, maintaining stability in their defense. The chain-consisted of Teigl on the left, Stafelidis, Hinteregger, Raulejo, and Verhaag, providing a robust barrier.\n\nThe game’s first scintillating moment arrived only nine minutes in, when Mario Götze's offensive prowess nearly broke the deadlock. After receiving an exquisitely threaded ball, Götze executed a shot that was deflected onto the post, marking Dortmund’s first significant chance of the evening. This sequence not only highlighted Dortmund's attacking ingenuity but also Augsburg's resilience, with Dominic Core managing a crucial touch before the ball hit the woodwork.\n\nAugsburg responded by generating their first corner kick through Gie, a testament to their ability to pose a threat despite having lesser possession. South Korean international Dong-Won Gie, who had a brief stint at Dortmund, led this effort. The set-piece, whipped in by Jonathan Schmid, was a notable attempt but was well-defended by Dortmund’s man-to-man marking.\n\nThroughout the first half, Dortmund remained the more dominant side. Their approach oscillated between a back three and a back five, depending on whether they were in possession or defending, respectively. Pulisic and Schmelzer’s high positioning provided width in their attacks, while Götze often drifted left to create overloads. The home side fashioned yet another opportunity around the 24th minute when a well-timed run from Dembelé ended with a swift cross that was defensively cleared by Hinteregger.\n\nDespite their intensified attacking efforts, Dortmund found themselves trailing just after the half-hour mark. A crucial mistake from Bartra allowed Augsburg to capitalize, leading to Gie netting the first goal of the evening for the visitors. Gie’s finish past Weidenfeller, following an initial save, underscored Augsburg’s resolve and efficiency in seizing upon key moments.\n\nImmediately, Dortmund sought to redress the balance. Aubameyang, renowned for his finishing, coupled with BVB’s intricate playmaking, conjured several promising moves. In one instance, a cross from Schmelzer saw Aubameyang rise high in the box, but the connection was not precise enough to alter the scoreline. \n\nThe remainder of the first half saw Dortmund exerting immense pressure. Pulisic’s skillful dribbling and ability to cut inside from the wing, combined with Ginter’s overlapping runs, kept Augsburg on the back foot. Several set-piece opportunities underscored their territorial dominance, but a combination of poor finishing and resolute defending from Marvin Hitz in goal kept the visitors ahead at the break.\n\nThe second half began with renewed vigor from Dortmund, who altered their defensive setup slightly with Bender partnering Merino in the center-back roles. Within two minutes, Dortmund’s relentless drive bore fruit. A brilliant interplay between Kagawa and Dembelé split open the Augsburg defense, allowing Dembelé to coolly slot the ball past Hitz to draw the game level at 1-1.\n\nThis goal injected a surge of momentum for Dortmund. Their possession statistics and duel wins were significantly in their favor, reflecting their dominance in gameplay. An attacking trio of Aubameyang, Dembelé, and Götze continually probed the Augsburg defense, creating several half-chances. Aubameyang, in particular, showcased his striking prowess by generating opportunities that were only narrowly thwarted by last-ditch clearances and saves.\n\nAugsburg, to their credit, managed to sustain periods of pressure and orchestrated counters primarily through Moravec and Schmid. Despite their limited possession, they continued to pose a threat, notably in set-piece situations where Dortmund’s defense was meticulously tested.\n\nAs the game entered its final third, Dortmund’s intensity heightened. They had their claims for a penalty when Götze appeared to be impeded by Verhaag inside the box, but the referee waved play on, much to the home side’s consternation. The decision raised eyebrows and brought about animated reactions from Thomas Tuchel on the touchline.\n\nDortmund resumed their offensive tirade, marshaling through their wide players. Pulisic's nimbleness on the left flank created significant difficulties for Augsburg’s fullbacks. Schmelzer and Ginter, too, pushed forward, seeking to create overlaps and stretch Augsburg’s defensive lines.\n\nIn the final stages, Augsburg's defense held firmly. Marvin Hitz’s awareness and shot-stopping quality came to the forefront as he thwarted successive attempts from Aubameyang, Götze, and Pulisic, who were tirelessly seeking a winner. Augsburg, despite finding themselves under a barrage of attacks, defended resolutely and showcased tactical discipline to preserve the 1-1 scoreline.\n\nIn the 90th minute, Augsburg introduced veteran Halil Altintop to add experience and perhaps clinch a late dramatic moment, but the game concluded with a well-earned point for both sides. The draw marked another instance of Dortmund struggling to secure victories despite overwhelming possession and a higher number of attacking plays. Manuel Baum's side proved commendably resilient, particularly in their defensive organization and clinical finishing.\n\nBoth teams left the field with mixed feelings; Dortmund, who dominated large swathes of the game, rued missed opportunities and questionable refereeing decisions. Augsburg, meanwhile, celebrated a hard-fought point gained against a formidable opponent in a challenging away fixture. The match was a testimony to the tactical depth and competitive spirit inherent in Bundesliga football."
