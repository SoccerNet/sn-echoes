that is the difficulty\n20:58 Comment: I think in such situations when you are not quite sure whether this is a clear hold\n21:4 Comment: from the referee's point of view it is rather less so that

    "summary": "The 150th competitive derby between Schalke and Dortmund unfolded with intense energy and drama as both sides looked to gain the upper hand in one of the Bundesliga's most passionate rivalries.\n\n### First Half\n\nThe game commenced with Dortmund playing from right to left and Schalke taking the initiative from their north curve. Dortmund, as anticipated, lined up with a three-man defense comprising Batra, Socrates, and Piszczek with Belé as the goalkeeper. Julian Weigl, who had left the German national team early due to left thigh problems, was crucial in Dortmund's midfield, alongside Castro. Schalke was missing their aggressive leader, Sead Kolasinac, who appeared to have injured himself.\n\nSchalke's initial strategy focused on preventing Dortmund from making significant advances. Early exchanges indicated Dortmund’s dominance in possession, reflecting their intent to take command of the game. Toulouse's Batra played unclean initially, seeking Aubameyang frequently but with little success, as indicated by Schalke's passive resistance in these early minutes.\n\nBy the 6th minute, Dortmund began building momentum through Dembele and Passlack. The latter, making his first starting lineup since the first leg of the season, appeared eager to make an impact. Schalke, however, started to gain confidence, as shown by their attempts to find Embolo with long passes, even though it bore no immediate fruit. Guido Burgstaller, freshly nominated for Austria’s national team, demonstrated significant tenacity emblematic of Ruhr derbies.\n\nWith Dortmund continuing to control the ball, Castro and Dembele worked the midfield efficiently, creating openings. Schulz could have capitalized on these openings, a subtle reminder that Bundesliga derbies often hinge on moments. As the first half progressed, Dortmund's efforts increasingly focused on setting up their dynamic striker, Aubameyang, although the exact execution fell short, either by off-three-man defenseside traps or Schalke’s resolute defense.\n\nLeon Goretzka demonstrated excellent form, catching the eye of national team coach Joachim Löw, who was present to scout potential World Cup candidates. Schalke moved the ball forward with Caligiuri and Goretzka in critical positions, but Weigl and Castro proved tough adversaries. Bentaleb tried his luck from distance, echoing Schalke’s intent to challenge Dortmund’s defense.\n\nDespite Dortmund's dominance in possession and intent, their 16-year-old wunderkind Ousmane Dembele was intermittently effective. His raw talent, marked by moments of brilliance, was yet untamed but promising an imminent breakthrough. As the initial half-hour ticked by, statistics reflected increased Dortmund control, yet without the desired cutting edge to break through Schalke’s defense. Schalke’s strategic positioning was less about possession and more about counter-attacking, with Goretzka pivotal.\n\nThe latter stages of the first half witnessed Dortmund pushing harder, with smelters maneuvering up the flanks and Aubameyang seeking space behind Schalke’s defense. Dortmund's passing precision left much to be desired, occasionally squandering promising positions. Schalke’s passive resistance was strategic, aiming to draw Dortmund in and hit on the break.\n\nClose to the halftime mark, despite Dortmund’s superior shot count, it remained goalless. Schalke aimed to seize moments of indecision within Dortmund’s ranks. Meanwhile, defensive shifts, including a resilient Höwedes frequently battling Aubameyang, illustrated tactical astuteness from both managers.\n\n### Second Half\n\nThe second half initiated with Schalke pushing towards the north curve, embodying renewed vigor. Burgstaller and Goretzka continued their formidable partnership, challenging Dortmund’s defense with intricate play. But Dortmund, disciplined in their defensive setup, held their ground. Fährmann’s goalkeeping was stellar, echoing his consistent form over past months.\n\nA deft interplay between Burgstaller and Goretzka showcased Schalke's ambition, but Dortmund's Socrates remained a bulwark in defense. The inclusion of Dembele and Kagawa was supposed to spark Dortmund's offense, further highlighted by Kagawa’s clever passes creating space for Aubameyang. Yet, Schalke’s meticulous offside traps maintained a stalemate.\n\nAs Schalke pushed their lines higher, offensive play outlined by Caligiuri saw opportunities brewing. Dortmund’s possession game, orchestrated by Weigl and Dembele, aimed at creating breakthroughs. However, as minutes passed, Schalke's persistently high press began influencing the game's momentum, forcing Dortmund to strategic discomfort.\n\nBurgstaller's role remained imperative; his offside positioning exemplifying Schalke’s tactical ploys to catch Dortmund on counter-attacks. This continuity disrupted Dortmund's rhythm, demanding swift strategic reactions from Tuchel. A promising move in the 56th minute saw Choupo-Moting almost capitalizing on a defensive lapse, only for Dortmund to clear narrowly. The escalating play presented a keenly contested midfield battle, primarily engaged by Weigl and Goretzka.\n\nDortmund’s breakthrough arrived on the hour mark, a seamless counter initiated by Dembele slicing through Schalke's midfield. A deft pass from Kagawa found Aubameyang, who coolly slotted past Fährmann, marking his 24th goal of the season. This precision left Schalke's defense momentarily static, silenced only by Aubameyang's controversial mask celebration, earning him a yellow card.\n\nPost the 0-1 goal, Schalke’s offensive urgency heightened. Schöpf and Meyer came on around the 63rd minute, injecting energy and attempting to disrupt Dortmund’s defense. Schalke’s offensive pursuits bore fruit in a lifeline moment in the 77th minute. A powerful header from Schöpf, exploitatively timed after a corner, found the back of the net despite Bürki's reflexive attempts.\n\nAs the game reached its climax, end-to-end action defined the closing minutes. Schmelzer’s exit for treatment saw Dortmund temporarily down to ten men, amplifying Schalke’s pressure. Substitution reactions from Tuchel, including introducing Emre Mohr, aimed at fortifying the midfield while providing agility going forward. Mohr’s entry with recent national team confidence sought to reclaim control.\n\nGoretzka’s consistent midfield probing, coupled with Höwedes' defensive leadership, fashioned a resilient Schalke response, with every tackle hurling the game into dramatic note. Mohr’s dexterous work nearly yielded a winning setup, yet Ferryman’s resilience kept Schalke in contention.\n\nThree minutes of injury time promised more drama, as Pulisic substituted in, aimed to add one final thrust to Dortmund's endurance. The game’s fabric saw moments of intense contest, with tactical hegemony being cautiously held despite physical rigor causing sporadic interruptions. Schalke sustained relentless pressure using set-plays and aerial duels, reinforcing their intent to steal a late victory.\n\nConclusively, the game embodied the quintessence of a Ruhr derby, ending in a 1-1 draw reflecting both teams' steadfastness and tactical prudence. Aubameyang's goal coupled with Schöpf’s responsive strike symbolized individual brilliance and collective resilience typical of encounters of this magnitude. Each side earned their point, fostering mutual respect in a deeply historical and passionately contested derby.\n\n### Analysis\n\nThe fixture underlined tactical ingenuity from both ends. Dortmund's reliance on possession and dynamic wing-play aimed at capitalizing on Aubameyang’s striking prowess. Schalke’s strategic resistance, paired with their transition play highlighted by Goretzka and Burgstaller, dictated significant phases.\n\nJoachim Löw’s presence emphasized the importance of individual performances, notably encouraging for prospects like Goretzka and Weigl. Furthermore, Schöpf’s equalizer amid competitive rustiness and Aubameyang’s precision underlaid high individual stakes translating into the team strategy.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe 150th Ruhr derby, a historic fixture, indeed lived up to its fiercely competitive billing, manifesting intense tactical and individual duels. The result: a hard-fought 1-1 draw, portraying the relentless spirits of Bundesliga's storied rivals, Schalke and Dortmund."
