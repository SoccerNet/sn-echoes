Comment: Piszczek against Günther.\n26:41 Comment: This is one of Christian Günther’s many strengths.\n26:43 Comment: It's just incredibly fast.\n26:45 Comment: Top speed is almost 35 kmh.\n26:48 Comment: So he could almost even compete with Aubameyang.\n26:52 Comment: Actually has the worse position here compared to Piszczek.\n26:56 Comment: Can then straighten the whole thing to the corner.\n26:58 Comment: We have arrived at corner number 7.\n27:0 Comment: 6.\n27:1 Comment: Dortmund has scored twice this season from corner kicks.\n27:5 Comment: What about it?\n27:7 Comment: Oh, there was a hand stretched out.\n27:20 Comment: We stay on topic.\n27:23 Comment: And if we continue at this pace, Dortmund will reach double figures in terms of corners before the break.\n27:30 Comment: Next flank.\n27:32 Comment: Precarious again.\n27:40 Comment: Günther's turn, then another Freiburger.\n27:42 Comment: And the corner kick festival in Dortmund continues.\n27:49 Comment: Brought in by Dembélé.\n27:50 Comment: Nope.\n28:2 Comment: These are now the phases that the Freiburgers are naturally using to take a short breather.\n28:7 Comment: Now don’t rush.\n28:20 Comment: Gain of space and throw-in for SC Freiburg.\n28:29 Comment: that's a good ball\n28:31 Comment: he has no chance\n28:33 Comment: the 22-year-old young player Onur Bulut\n28:35 Comment: He came from

Comment: although I do think it was a foul\n29:9 Comment: that just by the way\n29:11 Comment: but it was risky\n29:13 Comment: by Roman Bürki\n29:17 Comment: allegedly no foul on Höfler\n29:19 Comment: Dortmund remains in possession\n29:21 Comment: with Götze\n29:29 Comment: and the 3rd ball from Borussia Dortmund\n29:31 Comment: the 3rd game\n29:33 Comment: the 1st game\n29:35 Comment: by

Comment: they have the better individualists\n29:59 Comment: Astro.\n30:5 Comment: Moor.\n30:12 Comment: His left foot is an absolute weapon.\n30:15 Comment: Now this may seem a bit selfish at this moment.\n30:20 Comment: He has qualities from a distance, although he has already messed it up quite a bit.\n30:27 Comment: But let’s get back to the basic idea.\n30:29 Comment: So now it looks and now it feels like an actual home game for Borussia Dortmund this season.\n30:59 Comment: What you can see here is that the Freiburg players definitely try to combine courageously and quickly when they have the ball.\n31:19 Comment: In this case it went wrong because of Nikolas Höfler.\n31:24 Comment: But here again you can see that they are trying to continue to finish in the midfield if possible.\n31:29 Comment: In order not to get played in the back.\n31:32 Comment: The people of Darmstadt, for example, have chosen a completely different approach.\n31:36 Comment: From the beginning they stood deep with a back five.\n31:41 Comment: Moor.\n31:46 Comment: So here you could say that he could play a bit more with the others.\n31:50 Comment: Weigl.\n31:54 Comment: Dembele.\n31:55 Comment: Missed Injoski.\n31:56 Comment: Weigl.\n31:58 Comment: No foul.\n31:59 Comment: Free kick.\n32:0 Comment: So then.\n32:1 Comment: He has it now.\n32:7 Comment: Dingert may have waited a little while for the advantage.\n32:19 Comment: So that's a free kick position that you can work with.\n32:24 Comment: Half left in the direction of play for Borussia Dortmund.\n32:29 Comment: And now it's another free kick.\n32:30 Comment: And then it's another free kick.\n32:33 Comment: They have not yet scored a free kick this season.\n32:36 Comment: But admittedly, she is still young.\n32:39 Comment: In any case, they have enough talent on the pitch for such a position.\n32:46 Comment: He will take care of it.\n32:48 Comment: At least presumably.\n32:50 Comment: Castro, the first name of a person.\n32:56 Comment: Schmelzer is still there.\n32:59 Comment: Everything is clearly marked.\n33:3 Comment: And hü.\n33:27 Comment: Smelter.\n33:30 Comment: Brew!\n33:33 Comment: Restore the

about it? No way for anyone from Freiburg to get to it.\n41:51 Comment: And the offensive foul by the otherwise impeccable Caglar Suyuncu.\n41:57 Comment: This is a very interesting new signing from the second Turkish league.\n42:1 Comment: He has a language problem that is not entirely simple.\n42:5 Comment: He speaks neither German nor English.\n42:7 Comment: In other words, he has a translator with him everywhere.\n42:11 Comment: This makes it a bit difficult with him in his daily training work.\n42:16 Comment: The Freiburgers took this risk.\n42:18 Comment: What they didn't know, of course, is that Torrejon and Kempf will be out at the start of the season.\n42:24 Comment: And that’s why Suyuncu has to play right from the start.\n42:34 Comment: Otherwise a first half is possible.\n42:37 Comment: Slowly coming to an end, which definitely doesn't feel like 0-0.\n42:41 Comment: This is an entertaining game.\n42:43 Comment: There's pace, there are penalty area actions, finishes.\n42:47 Comment: Freiburgers fighting bravely.\n42:53 Comment: A team in black and yellow that has really stepped up the pace at times.\n42:59 Comment: Now currently working hard again and has to work hard.\n43:4 Comment: The whole thing is garnished with some really great players.\n43:7 Comment: Two fights.\n43:14 Comment: Suyuncu was put under pressure here.

Dembélé.\n44:2 Comment: The angle is sharp, the ball is in.\n44:7 Comment: 44th minute.\n44:12 Comment: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang.\n44:25 Comment: And that's how it happened.\n44:29 Comment: Freiburg are actually well positioned here, but they forget Dembélé.\n44:33 Comment: Gulde arrives too late.\n44:36 Comment: Goetz.\n44:37 Comment: Dembele.\n44:38 Comment: Who rewards himself with this assist

    "summary": "Borussia Dortmund surged to a 3-1 victory over SC Freiburg in a fascinating Bundesliga encounter where home advantage played a key role. Played on a crisp evening, the match unfurled inside the Signal Iduna Park, draped in the black and yellow colors of the Dortmund faithful, who anticipated an attacking display from their side.\n\nFrom the get-go, SC Freiburg demonstrated their intent to stand firm against their reputable opponents. Nils Petersen, starting his first game of the season for Freiburg, was poised to make an impact alongside Bulut. Early attempts to establish dominance in midfield were evident, particularly through Abrashi, whose clean handling of the ball nearly fashioned an early scoring opportunity.\n\nFreiburg's manager Christian Streich was vocal from the sidelines, reflecting the meticulous preparation that went into this challenging fixture. Dortmund, under Thomas Tuchel, was initially struggling to break through Freiburg’s organized press and high defensive line. The opening passages of play were punctuated by several duels, notably between Castro of Dortmund and various Freiburg defenders.\n\nAubameyang quickly became the focus of attack for Dortmund, continually seeking to penetrate through Freiburg's sturdy defense. In one sequence, pursued closely by three defenders, he displayed his typical speed and elusiveness, though his final efforts were parried, reminding one of his relentless scoring prowess.\n\nIn stark contrast, Freiburg’s attack was led prominently by Vincenzo Grifo and Petersen, who combined fluidly. Grifo, with his accurate passing, managed to create some discomfort for the Dortmund defense, although Roman Bürki, the Dortmund goalkeeper, remained largely untroubled in these early stages.\n\nMidgame, Julian Weigl emerged as a commandant in Dortmund's midfield, orchestrating the game with his precise passing and diligent defending. His collaboration with Castro and Götze provided a continuous threat to Freiburg. The interplay among these three was particularly notable with swift exchanges and runs into the final third, although Freiburg's resolute defense held firm.\n\nThe first clear chance for Dortmund arrived when Dembele, with a surge of pace, dodge past multiple players but was tackled by Alexander Injovski, another experienced player who performed robustly for Freiburg. Moments later, from a tight angle, Aubameyang latched onto a through ball, neatly provided by Weigl, but his effort went narrowly wide, marking one of Dortmund's best chances of the first half.\n\nThe game's tempo increased as the first half progressed, with Dortmund gaining more possession and confidence. However, Freiburg remained threatening on the counter, and Petersen showcased why he was starting by cleverly positioning himself to receive long balls and quickly turning to initiate offensive plays.\n\nAs the 44th minute approached, Dortmund's persistence was rewarded. Dembélé’s fearless run down the left flank and subsequent precise cross allowed Aubameyang to finish clinically. Freiburg's defense was caught napping, providing Aubameyang just enough space to exploit. This goal, assisted by the vibrant Dembélé, underscored Dortmund's attacking might and ensured they went into halftime with their noses in front.\n\nResuming the second half, Dortmund was eager to consolidate their lead. Thomas Tuchel, aware of the necessity to retain control, made some tactical adjustments. The early exchanges post-interval saw Dortmund’s offensive onslaught pressure Freiburg considerably. A near miss by Aubameyang early on was symbolic of their intention to put the game out of reach.\n\nDortmund's dominance was further reflected in their possession stats, maintaining a significant share of the ball and constantly probing Freiburg's defensive setup. This relentless probing paid off as Castro's unselfish play in midfield navigated a platform for Piszczek, who timed his run perfectly and bundled the ball into the net in the 57th minute, doubling Dortmund's lead.\n\nDespite trailing, Freiburg’s spirit remained undeterred. Coach Christian Streich’s substitution saw Yannick Haberer replace an exhausted Nils Petersen, shaking up their attacking approach. Subsequently, a Freiburg attack masterminded by Schwolo, with an insightful long ball, allowed Maximilian Philipp, assisted by Haberer, to slot home a well-taken goal. This goal showcased precise teamwork and rejuvenated Freiburg’s hopes, cutting Dortmund's lead to 2-1 with half an hour remaining.\n\nAs Freiburg upped their tempo, Dortmund also pushed forward to restore their two-goal advantage. Pulisic's introduction added another dynamic element to their offense. The young American showcased his flair, linking up well with both Castro and Götze, creating more threats for Freiburg's tiring defense.\n\nSome nervy moments ensued where Freiburg could have leveled the match. An expansive play from Bulut and Grifo saw Roman Bürki tested, but the Dortmund keeper held firm. Their efforts, however valiant, fell short of breaching Dortmund’s resilience.\n\nFinally, as the game drew toward its climax, Dortmund sealed the result. In injury time, after waves of Freiburg incursions were thwarted, Guerreiro, brought on to freshen up the midfield, delivered a crisp pass to Aubameyang, assisting him in driving home the final blow. This third goal typified Dortmund’s sharp attacking play and culminated in a well-deserved win.\n\nThe match concluded with Borussia Dortmund basking in the applause of their home crowd, trumping Freiburg with a solid 3-1 victory. Their ability to withstand Freiburg's persistence, combined with a calculated attacking approach, led them efficiently through the contest. Thomas Tuchel’s men demonstrated both resilience and finesse, qualities necessary to maintain their competitive edge throughout the Bundesliga season. \n\nIn the aftermath, Dortmund's possession-based strategy, bolstered by the creativity and precision of players like Dembélé and Weigl, alongside the clinical finishing of Aubameyang and Piszczek, was instrumental in securing the win. Freiburg should take heart from their spirited performance, particularly their formidable press and the breakthrough goal by Philipp, suggesting potential success in their forthcoming fixtures."
