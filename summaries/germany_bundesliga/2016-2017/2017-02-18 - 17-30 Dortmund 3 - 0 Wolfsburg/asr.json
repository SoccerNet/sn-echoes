think, 0 to 1.\n33:1 Comment: And then turned the game around, including by scoring an own goal.\n33:4 Comment: In the end, VfL Wolfsburg won 2-1.\n33:16 Comment: Daniel is a great footballer.\n33:20 Comment: The Davi.\n33:21 Comment: He also scored a goal in the first leg,\n33:24 Comment: which Wolfsburg, however, lost 1-5.\n33:31 Comment: The wagons just don't do it that way.\n33:40 Comment: We

with Mali.\n37:33 Comment: It is striking that Mali, who is so good with the ball,\n37:38 Comment: plays hardly any role in this first half.\n37:41 Comment: He hasn't been here long enough yet.\n37:44 Comment: He came from Mainz in the winter.\n37:47 Comment: And that is the problem with winter transfers.\n37:49 Comment: They should actually work immediately, without having to make major adjustments.\n37:52 Comment: And that is the problem.\n38:0 Comment: Because then you have to make some major adjustments.\n38:1 Comment: And Mali plays in a sensitive position,\n38:4 Comment: when he is supposed to stage something a little bit forward.\n38:6 Comment: And you should then know a little bit about the routes and pass stations.\n38:12 Comment: And this has to be worked out during ongoing operations.\n38:23 Comment: There was little more to be done.\n38:26 Comment: War hedgehog.\n38:28 Comment: A loss of the ball.\n38:30 Comment: On the other hand, too.\n38:58 Comment:

menu.\n39:44 Comment: He doesn’t want to miss the opportunity to recommend him for the second card.\n39:47 Comment: So a second card with Sky.\n39:49 Comment: Ordering means\n39:54 Comment: distribute the program across several rooms.\n39:57 Comment: Distribute the program across several rooms.\n40:29 Comment: It didn't look that bad. Arnold put his arm on top of it lovingly, but I think he stepped on his foot pretty badly at the bottom.\n40:49 Comment: So here.\n40:50 Comment: Arnold then unintentionally lost his bearings.\n41:18 Comment: The pain is too great for him to perhaps...\n41:20 Comment: ...would like to do something with the free kick himself.\n41:24 Comment: But there are also Schürrle and Castro.\n41:46 Comment:

And that is the only shot on goal that VfL Wolfsburg has taken.\n43:49 Comment: Against RB Leipzig around the stadium.\n43:53 Comment: Then a week later, when his team played in Darmstadt, there was the incident where two buses full of hooligans were sent back to North Rhine-Westphalia.\n44:11 Comment: 88 stadium bans have now been imposed.\n44:14 Comment: And that’s just how Borussia Dortmund wants to watch.\n44:17 Comment: That's how it is.\n44:19 Comment: Which gives scope for action to deal with the events in Leipzig.\n44:24 Comment: He has.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: They have

communication.\n1:40 Comment: Nobameyang is not doing quite well.\n1:43 Comment: So it is worth taking a look at the\n1:46 Comment: which could possibly still be substituted.\n1:52 Comment: Christian Pulisic certainly has an offensive urge.\n1:56 Comment: Or Shinsuke Kagawa.\n1:59 Comment: If you can't compare that 1-1 with Nobameyang.\n2:3 Comment: For the defense Merino.\n2:6 Comment: Pass was there.\n2:9 Comment: Let’s see how long Nobameyang can hold out.\n2:15 Comment: Speaking of substitute benches.\n2:18 Comment: VfL Wolfsburg also brought some staff with them.\n2:22 Comment: What we can still hope for.\n2:24 Comment: That's a good ball.\n2:30 Comment: They have already done this with David,\n2:33 Comment: who replaced himself in the first half.\n2:36 Comment: There is still hope

there.\n3:24 Comment: This is a mess.\n3:26 Comment: It just slips through.\n3:28 Comment: Gustavo goes there as if he was afraid of the ball.\n3:31 Comment: As if it hurt.\n3:33 Comment: And in the end, Piszczek is the quickest thinker.\n3:36 Comment: And brings the ball past Benaglio, who is rightly served.\n3:40 Comment: That's a good ball.\n3:48 Comment: From a free kick.\n3:50 Comment: Where everything should actually be clear.\n3:53 Comment: Who cares for whom.\n3:55 Comment: And then Dembélé has so much space.\n3:57 Comment: Nobody disturbs.\n3:59 Comment: In the flank is not good.\n4:1

less torn with his performances and then after a long injury break perhaps\n24:0 Comment: There will also come a phase where things are not going quite so smoothly, which is understandable and normal\n24:24 Comment: I looked for a moment to see if it was really as it seemed\n24:41 Comment: but Schiller cleared the page now occupied and\n24:50 Comment: politically the respective right

mature if he perhaps still has a little something\n27:44 Comment: of physical robustness, so hopefully the Bundesliga can still have a\n27:51 Comment: a little longer about the billet like Kagawa was about it\n27:54 Comment: He has done it now, he is not coping so well this season but if\n27:57 Comment: you can see how Billet plays when you see how Castro plays then\n28:3 Comment: is it also understandable that a Jimmy Kagawa spends many minutes on the\n28:8 Comment: bank to watch\n28:21 Comment: come Francesca there and\n29:21 Comment: So it will be nothing to zero, certainly not with the victory in there, certainly not\n29:26 Comment: and there is still a quarter of an hour to play here\n29:39 Comment: she\n29:42 Comment: in the wines so that is also yellow for me\n29:51 Comment: I think he actually expected that but\n29:57 Comment: I'll let that happen and now it's time\n30:11 Comment: This is a nice moment for him and I think that I actually want to discuss this topic now.\n30:17 Comment: very stressful but it is just like that\n30:21 Comment: That would have been even better for him if there had been 25,000 more in the stadium\n30:25 Comment: would have been in it he deserves it very popular here in Dortmund from 2007 to\n30:37 Comment: 2015 continuously here then to Florence and then to VW Wolfsburg but yes\n30:49 Comment: but\n30:51 Comment: and then he has to look for wonderful\n31:3 Comment: neither can of course not go away so first goal scorer for God's sake so somehow something\n31:9 Comment: try but the referee team can not say even for cheap\n31:21 Comment: kPC\n31:36 Comment: So somehow that was enough in the afternoon not so much\n31:42 Comment: for the v direction wolfsburg the whole thing is much too clear but\n31:48 Comment: there are already some nice\n32:21 Comment: Castle.\n32:51 Comment: That one slips through too.\n32:56 Comment: And the next corner for Borussia Dortmund.\n33:1 Comment: What has worked so well recently, with Luis Gustavo as the organizer of the three-man chain,\n33:9 Comment: possibly also a back five, which is also causing serious problems today.\n33:21 Comment: Mostly on Dortmund.\n33:24 Comment: Which I forget.\n33:27 Comment: We have tennis tomorrow.\n33:30 Comment: The final of the ATP Tour of Rotterdam starts at 3.30 p.m.\n33:34 Comment: You might now be wondering who is standing opposite each other?\n33:37 Comment: I can't say yet. The semifinals are still being played today.\n33:51 Comment: No goal. Side netting.\n34:22 Comment: Denaglio recognized it so early that he didn't even put his hand there properly.\n34:27 Comment: And even though the free kick didn't go in, I think Gonzalo Castro played a good, very good game again today.\n34:39 Comment: He had a great start here this season and then, like so many others, he was injured for a long time.\n34:51 Comment: In Dortmund, everyone who could still walk and was maybe a little older than 16 was out and about.\n35:6 Comment: Also in the Champions League, by the way, because there were so many injuries.\n35:11 Comment: And then I always have to put it all back together again.\n35:14 Comment: Now.\n35:16 Comment: I think the final sign is yes, Dortmund is firmly established.\n35:21 Comment: Counting on three points, Weigl goes down and Merino comes on.\n35:48 Comment: Merino.\n35:49 Comment: Merino, by the way, has exactly...\n35:51 Comment: Sorted into the place that Weigl just vacated.\n36:1 Comment: This is the first time he has worked against Mali.\n36:21 Comment: You now have a\n36:33 Comment: Of course, now that Merino is on the pitch, Thomas Tuchel can no longer make any substitutions.\n36:44 Comment: Aubameyang will have

stabilize itself.\n39:24 Comment: Even when behind, as quickly as against Hoffenheim.\n39:28 Comment: The statistics of the last few weeks also suggested that the team had understood\n39:35 Comment: We are in a relegation battle, we have to do something.\n39:37 Comment: There were twelve points from the last six games.\n39:44 Comment: But the situation here today has actually been too narrow

    "summary": "The atmosphere at Signal Iduna Park was electric as Borussia Dortmund hosted VfL Wolfsburg in a pivotal Bundesliga clash. Fans from both sides filled the stands, with the traveling Wolfsburg supporters hoping for a positive outcome, even though the odds seemed against them. The kickoff saw Dortmund opting to play towards the south in the first half, an unusual choice as they typically prefer this direction in the second half, prompting some early game discussions about strategy and tradition.\n\nThe opening exchanges were characterized by possessions and passes as both sides tried to find their rhythm. Early on, Dortmund had more of the ball and clearer intent, spreading play wide through Marcel Schmelzer and Marco Reus on the left, and André Schürrle and Ousmane Dembélé on the right. The interplay and quick passes demonstrated Dortmund's plan to stretch Wolfsburg's defense. However, Marco Bartra's early attempts to create through the center met with mixed success.\n\nThe first real opportunity came in the sixth minute when Reus and Schürrle combined well, allowing Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to take a shot. His effort was a turning spin aimed directly at Wolfsburg goalkeeper Diego Benaglio, who gathered comfortably. This early warning sign did not go unnoticed by Wolfsburg's backline, particularly Jeffrey Bruma who was positioned decently.\n\nDespite this, Dortmund continued to press and probe. Audacious crosses from Lukasz Piszczek and calculated movements by Reus and Schmelzer put pressure on Wolfsburg’s defense. On the other side, Wolfsburg attempted to mount their reply, pulling back into a defensive shape often morphing into a back five, a setup they hoped would repel Dortmund's advancing lines.\n\nWolfsburg’s best efforts were often stifled by a disciplined and creatively poised Dortmund midfield marshaled by Gonzalo Castro and Julian Weigl, who maintained possession effectively and drove transitions. An unfortunate moment for Wolfsburg came with a foul on Dembélé at the edge of the box, foreshadowing a difficult game for the visitors in managing Dortmund’s pacey attackers.\n\nWolfsburg’s defensive disciplines started fraying around the 20th minute. As Dortmund mounted yet another patient build-up, Bruma, struggling with a combination of questionable positioning and poor decision-making, inadvertently guided the ball into his own net. This own goal set the tone for Wolfsburg’s defensive performance – ambitious but under pressure.\n\nDortmund smelled blood and maintained their assault with a controlling influence on the game, sustaining possession, and looking for weaknesses in Wolfsburg’s defensive armor. The midfield, orchestrated by Castro, staged alternating shifts from wide plays back to central advances, causing more confusion among Wolfsburg’s ranks.\n\nMinutes before the break, hopes ignited for Wolfsburg as they managed to secure a position close to Dortmund’s box. However, the resultant free kick from Emiliano Arnold brought forth no change in the scoreboard. Dortmund looked set to enter the halftime break with a slim lead but firmly in control of the match's tempo with efforts from Aubameyang and Dembélé hints towards more coming in the second half.\n\nAs the second half commenced, Dortmund continued their relentless approach without changes in their lineup. Wolfsburg, too, returned unchanged but visibly more intent on contesting every ball. Yet, Dortmund's dominance soon paid dividends again. Within the opening minute, Schürrle's run was followed by a clinical finish from Lukas Piszczek, who benefitted from Wolfsburg’s defensive lapse, particularly Gustavo’s apprehensively soft challenge, failing to clear his lines. The resulting 2-0 lead was a just reward for Dortmund’s unyielding pressure. \n\nWolfsburg struggled to find any foothold in the game. Their attempts to break forward were frequently intercepted by Dortmund’s resolute midfield. A tactical substitution from Wolfsburg saw them bring on more attacking players in hopes of closing the deficit, but it scarcely altered the dynamic of the match.\n\nDortmund had their sight on a third goal, and it wasn’t long in coming. A cross-field play involving Schürrle and Piszczek outfoxed Wolfsburg’s tired legs, and amidst the chaos, Piszczek once again got onto the end of a well-flighted delivery, nodding it home effortlessly to make it 3-0. Wolfsburg’s morale plummeted further, knowing they were thoroughly outplayed.\n\nRoman Bürki, Dortmund’s goalkeeper, had a relatively relaxed afternoon, with scarce threatening situations coming his way from Wolfsburg. If anything, the odd free-kick or speculative effort clearly demonstrated the limitation in attack from the visitors. Julian Weigl’s composed performance in the center belied his age, as he calmly directed play, stymieing any potential momentum that Wolfsburg tried to build.\n\nAs the game progressed into its latter stages, coach Thomas Tuchel opted for fresh legs, introducing Christian Pulisic for Reus. The young American winger continued Dortmund’s intense and fluid play, demonstrating why he’s been an integral part of their campaign. Wolfsburg, by now, was resigned to damage control, occasionally threatening on the break but lackluster in penetration.\n\nA scare came for Wolfsburg as their midfield linchpin, Luiz Gustavo, went down injured. He shambled off temporarily but gamely returned, embodying Wolfsburg’s struggle yet spirit in facing a superior Dortmund. Despite the return, the game continued to tip heavily in Dortmund’s favor. Their cohesive display was a statement and a much-needed confidence booster following a tricky spell in other competitions.\n\nThe closing minutes saw Dortmund manage the game adeptly. They slowed the pace strategically, ensuring Wolfsburg had no latitude to mount any serious comeback. Youngster Merino got valuable minutes, replacing Weigl and maintaining the midfield's energy and control. Wolfsburg, worn out and demoralized, couldn’t muster a response worthy of altering the one-sided affair.\n\nThe match ended 3-0 to Dortmund, a scoreline reflective of their dominance. Every facet of Dortmund's game worked seamlessly from back to front, a pressing masterclass supported by excellent individual performances. Wolfsburg, on the other hand, left with concerns about their defensive frailty and offensive inefficacy, looking to regroup and find better results in future fixtures.\n\nAs the crowd exited the stadium, the Dortmund contingent beamed, their side’s victory resonating loudly as a promise of better things ahead. Wolfsburg’s fans, albeit disappointed, acknowledged the gulf in quality and hoped for a turnaround in their upcoming games."
