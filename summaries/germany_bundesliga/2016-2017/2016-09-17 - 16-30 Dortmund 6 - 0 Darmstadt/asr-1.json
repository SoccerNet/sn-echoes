didn't work out.\n3:21 Comment: In the place where he had a great success with Darmstadt last season.\n3:26 Comment: Completely inferior to Darmstadt.\n3:28 Comment: 1 to 2 behind after their own lead and then Sulu came in the 90th minute and made\n3:34 Comment: the park quietly with its 2 to 2.\n3:38 Comment: That won't happen today.\n3:40 Comment: At least not in this personnel

quickly there could\n6:9 Comment: there might actually be a hole in the back weigel\n6:13 Comment: For example, there was once\n6:39 Comment: seventh minute Gonzalo Castro with the 1 0 there we go\n6:43 Comment: through the round of drivers with the 1 0 there we go through the round of drivers with the 1 0 there we go\n6:43 Comment: Throw-in almost at the corner flag for the ladies city team then the ball spooned up by Heller\n6:49 Comment: and then Borussia Dortmund actually has something like space on the pitch that stops counterattacks\n6:56 Comment: yes something and then it will be good because guerrero and ramos have a little idea above all\n7:2 Comment: Ramos who sees the gap at exactly the right moment, the Berlin not in the offside same height\n7:7 Comment: great pass in the middle Castro then completely free the newly formed\n7:13 Comment: and then he has the whole game central defense although there are three central defenders not on\n7:20 Comment: the height of this first counterattack which had such a touch of speed was\n7:28 Comment: höhn and milosevic especially the central defenders could not stop him first season goal\n7:34 Comment: for Castro, who incidentally hits the spot exactly at the minute the festival started in Warsaw\n7:43 Comment: at the\n7:58 Comment: behind and Ramos was pushed so he rightly gives the free shot\n8:20 Comment: and\n8:24 Comment: then he has the whole game in the middle\n8:28 Comment: two fingers as three men who have now found each other\n8:42 Comment: a shooter also wanted to get to us first but the block

Comment: 100% in the first two match days keeps going\n9:58 Comment: socontinuous infeld\n10:19 Comment: pass varnish\n10:19 Comment: but\n10:27 Comment: Next free kick.\n10:57 Comment: By the way, this is considered a lost duel.\n11:0 Comment: Statistically, Darmstadt even won a few more duels in these first eleven minutes.\n11:6 Comment: Nevertheless, I can't shake the feeling that they are actually running after and watching in every situation.\n11:13 Comment: At least up to this point.\n11:19 Comment: He is there.\n11:27 Comment: So straight is.\n11:46 Comment: Ginter.\n11:50 Comment: And there is Guerreiro again.\n11:52 Comment: Everything runs through this left side.\n11:57 Comment: Weigl.\n12:4 Comment: That was one too many.\n12:6 Comment: Vorancic.\n12:9 Comment: But there is no chance of getting the ball to one of their own players in a useful way because Dortmund is well organised.\n12:16 Comment: Also in the backward movement.\n12:17 Comment: And now the pace is back in the game.\n12:19 Comment: This means it could be dangerous for the guests.\n12:24 Comment: Ramos was ready for the rebound.\n12:27 Comment: First good action then also on the other side.\n12:31 Comment: .\n12:44 Comment: I'm curious to see whether the people of Darmstadt will change their behavior a little.\n12:49 Comment: So far they have been very passive.\n12:51 Comment: Retreat very far.\n12:54 Comment: Leave it to Dortmund actually.\n12:56 Comment: There it was.\n12:57 Comment: Yes, at least a third of your own half of the pitch.\n12:59 Comment: And I think the first few minutes have shown that this does not mean that we have the defense under control.\n13:10 Comment: Warrior.\n13:12 Comment: Castro.\n13:22 Comment: Ramos.\n13:23 Comment: And the next gap.\n13:24 Comment: Castro.\n13:25 Comment: Good idea.\n13:26 Comment: And then he has this.\n13:27 Comment: And again and again Guerreiro has his feet in it.\n13:38 Comment: That was great of Castro, who knew full well that Ramos was ready.\n13:42 Comment: And he might need a second or third shot on goal before it works.\n13:47 Comment: So things are looking like it's only a matter of time before Dortmund does it again.\n13:53 Comment: .\n13:59 Comment: This is exactly what the radiation peak rule says.\n14:0 Comment: He is with the AfD at the top.\n14:3 Comment: Zadic will probably not be a dream hunt.\n14:7 Comment: beings nord slices.\n14:8 Comment: Weっぱ manaron has an expert microphone that should come very close to the Internet.\n14:18 Comment: ispester in the ligestritteраently.\n14:50 Comment: Dortmund are allowed to let the ball circle around up to ten meters in front of the penalty area.\n15:0 Comment: Oara also misses the duel, but at least he has help from Niebenmaier.\n15:4 Comment: But Ramos is back at it again.\n15:7 Comment: The hindquarters supported.\n15:20 Comment: Ah, the elbow was out.\n15:28 Comment: A quarter of an hour has now been played.\n15:31 Comment: The people from Darmstadt are just there.\n15:35 Comment: But they don't play along.\n15:37 Comment: Dortmund has everything under control.\n15:40 Comment: Moves the ball well.\n15:42 Comment: At the beginning mainly on the left side.\n15:45 Comment: A first taste has already been given on the right.\n15:48 Comment: And if Esser hadn't saved Ramos' header so well, Dortmund would have had great confidence in the result very early in the game.\n16:2 Comment: So the score is only 1-0.\n16:4 Comment: But the Dortmunders make that impression.\n16:7 Comment: As if it didn't bother her.\n16:10 Comment: Pass machinery is running.\n16:11 Comment: Socrates.\n16:39 Comment: Zuseen unravelte the Wann entren Torben列mann the\n16:43 Comment: Socrates.\n16:48 Comment: Then see how turtles from Leipzig were made in Hamburg style.\n16:56 Comment: Form observeutral there Harris and糖t the\n17:1 Comment: Half would be the Othergroove And\n17:4 Comment: Tiererion-S底 activi.\n17:6 Comment: Schmelzer, Dembélé, misunderstanding.\n17:31 Comment: But Schmelzer follows up on the whole thing and has him against Benatira.\n17:38 Comment: Careless loss of the ball by Enes Benatira.\n17:42 Comment: Not punished yet, pass was there, Sokratis.\n18:1 Comment: Schmelzer, Dembélé, misunderstanding.\n18:31 Comment: Kastro's free kick.\n18:36 Comment: Bocht almost runs through.\n18:38 Comment: There were, notice, two Dortmunders here, Weigl and Sokratis.\n18:48 Comment: Completely unhindered.\n18:49 Comment: And here at the back, Ramos almost gets his chance.\n19:1 Comment: A variant that almost worked.\n19:7 Comment: And then we head back towards the yellow-black wall.\n19:15 Comment: Hey, hey, hey!\n19:31 Comment: Smelter.\n19:34 Comment: Past Benatira.\n19:36 Comment: Wow, that was a surprise from Guerreiro.\n19:39 Comment: And Esser is back.\n19:42 Comment: I like the Dortmund game.\n19:44 Comment: So on the one hand, Darmstadt is extremely passive.\n19:48 Comment: But they're standing back there, ten men including Esser.\n19:52 Comment: And that's where creativity is required.\n19:56 Comment: Sometimes there is a moment of surprise.\n19:57 Comment: Guerreiro almost had this on his side.\n19:59 Comment: And Esser is the most attentive and best Darmstadt player so far.\n20:29 Comment: So graphic.\n20:37 Comment: Also one of the very young ones.\n20:39 Comment: Christian Pulesit, 17 years old.\n20:42 Comment: Since Wednesday, the youngest player to ever play for Borussia Dortmund in the Champions League.\n20:59 Comment: On the back staff Er reason, snowman back gonna serve.\n21:3 Comment: You know what?\n21:4 Comment: Someone out of time to play hen,\n21:7 Comment: The Ice\n21:25 Comment: Since I'm standing now,\n21:27 Comment: hey,\n21:28 Comment: Oh my Greensburg,\n21:29 Comment: yellow card for bernhard here in the current season\n21:33 Comment: yes there are no two opinions that had to do with duel\n21:40 Comment: So the holiday type anyway nothing to do but with was not\n21:43 Comment: more because only the verses of Schmelzer money completely appropriate\n21:49 Comment: the\n21:55 Comment: the reverence\n22:11 Comment: the defender Socrates his neighbour behind him is standing here in the centre circle 15 metres further\n22:18 Comment: behind the\n22:19 Comment: bürki so darmstadt can obviously do nothing with the topic of attacking earlier\n22:26 Comment: start the two full-backs at borussia dortmund pass lay right and left schmelzer are\n22:33 Comment: yes more on the opponent's 16-yard line than that they in any way have a\n22:37 Comment: defensive task but Schmelzer is now giving the ball\n22:40 Comment: but then also works carefully back\n22:49 Comment: because derigging\n23:6 Comment: is\n23:11 Comment:

now a few\n24:13 Comment: Words found I can imagine\n24:15 Comment: also not imagine\n24:16 Comment: that the\n24:17 Comment: That is so discouraging and usually goes hand in hand with a bit of fear.\n24:25 Comment: So there will be no partial success in Dortmund and there is really no way to make any headway out of these first 25 minutes.\n24:33 Comment: Maybe you have the opportunity to hoover up 100,000 euros as you go.\n24:38 Comment: We have a pack of six on offer.\n24:41 Comment: You know it every match day, you just have to predict the Saturday games correctly, and not the trend, but the correct result, then you are in the draw.\n25:11 Comment: Young will be the whole going around, Esser.\n25:20 Comment: Good overview for Schmelzer, Dembélé.\n25:24 Comment: Ah, tips too far in front of Ramos.\n25:41 Comment: Smelter.\n26:0 Comment: Weigel.\n26:2 Comment: Dembélé and Guerreiro, but this is once again a technical error by Ousmane Dembélé.\n26:11 Comment: We would like to take another look at the only goal of the afternoon.\n26:17 Comment: However, Dembélé prepared this very well.\n26:23 Comment: There was nothing more that Esser could do because Castro made the most of his attacking midfield role and showed himself up front.\n26:33 Comment: And was able to take Dembélé's pass at exactly the right moment.\n26:41 Comment: And Lorena Restrego dieueprint should admit everything.\n26:45 Comment: Here z theoretically to have, if one can set that room of Tor a little before naszego Tor hitting.\n26:51 Comment: I have been a self-advocate here for a long time, I

Comment: and then he puts the ball on Esser's chest.\n27:43 Comment: He has the ball on Esser’s chest.\n28:32 Comment: That was with a little luck,\n28:34 Comment: What about a little luck,\n28:37 Comment: Socrates.\n28:39 Comment: That's a good ball.\n29:22 Comment: There are two illustrations, a ges rischschneigen,OSSi comportamentale skin art ver-He eye\n29:23 Comment: Two illustrative disruptors are formented,以.\n29:24 Comment: So it did.\n29:42 Comment: Smelter.\n29:54 Comment: That's a good ball.\n30:4 Comment: He didn't really know what he wanted anymore.\n30:9 Comment: But even after half an hour it is good to watch,\n30:13 Comment: what Borussia Dortmund brings to the pitch.\n30:17 Comment: For example, Dembélé, who was not quite at his best technically.\n30:22 Comment: He repeats this cross.\n30:24 Comment: Dortmund has a good execution.\n30:34 Comment: Ramos heads the ball.\n30:37 Comment: Dortmund let the ball run wonderfully.\n30:41 Comment: They now have 80% possession.\n30:45 Comment: Darmstadt has not been dangerous even once\n30:48 Comment: Bürki.\n30:51 Comment: They were only in the corner once during a throw-in.\n31:0 Comment: They added something else.\n31:3 Comment: They are not used.\n31:6 Comment: They will not play football.\n31:9 Comment: And that.\n31:12 Comment: Just the thought.\n31:15 Comment: Ramos, free kick Dortmund.\n31:18 Comment: And yellow.\n31:21 Comment: Darmstadt has to give another ball.\n31:27 Comment: He knows he doesn't have to help in any other way.\n31:30 Comment: It goes too fast when the ball picks up some speed.\n31:39 Comment: For Darmstadt, this is all a step too far.\n31:42 Comment: That's to pick up on the idea I just mentioned.\n31:45 Comment: Although they play with six players in the starting eleven.\n31:50 Comment: rab wish.\n31:52 Comment: It is factional�\n31:54 Comment: It is factual\n31:55 Comment: It is fact purchasing\n31:56 Comment: That's regardless.\n31:57 Comment: JpD\n31:58

Dortmund punishes this in a similar way to the 1-0.\n34:19 Comment: Guerre round in pace.\n34:22 Comment: Ramos.\n34:23 Comment: Ah, for a moment it looked like he might still notice the ball.\n34:27 Comment: But it is not.\n34:45 Comment: Smelter.\n34:49 Comment: In combination, Milosevic and Guaro ahead of Ramos.\n34:54 Comment: It always only goes in one direction, just like at the Singapore Grand Prix.\n34:59 Comment: If you are only interested in the race, it will be available tomorrow from 1 p.m.\n35:7 Comment: But of course we also provide you with everything that goes with it, such

car.\n35:48 Comment: 성.\n35:49 Comment: 1, 1.\n35:49 Comment: and then he immediately\n35:51 Comment: look again from outside.\n35:53 Comment: Because if I see it correctly,\n35:55 Comment: prepares Norbert Meier\n35:57 Comment: the hand on the ball.\n35:59 Comment: And then he\n36:1 Comment: take another look from outside.\n36:3 Comment: Because if I see it correctly,\n36:5 Comment: prepares Norbert Meier\n36:7 Comment: the hand on the ball.\n36:9 Comment: And then he\n36:11 Comment: take another look from outside.\n36:13 Comment: Because if I see it correctly,\n36:15 Comment: prepares Norbert Meier\n36:17 Comment: the first change.\n36:19 Comment: And Benatira is probably affected by this.\n36:23 Comment: Strong ball control.\n36:29 Comment: So much for his defensive duties.\n36:37 Comment: At the very front you can\n36:39 Comment: do a bit of defensive work.\n36:41 Comment: You're not asked to go to the back.\n37:11 Comment: Guerrero.\n37:15 Comment: Even if the Dortmund\n37:17 Comment: not now in 60 second intervals here. It never seems static in this first\n37:22 Comment: Half. Then it runs a little more quietly from right to left, but then they also have at least\n37:26 Comment: the attempt to use a through ball or a diagonal pass to get into the famous interface\n37:33 Comment: To bring tempo into the game, to bring in the element of surprise and the only reason why not\n37:39 Comment: That's the result. That should clearly show Borussia Dortmund's side.\n37:47 Comment: Schmelzer. Ramos offside. That's what I mean. From midfield thanks to the good\n38:4 Comment: This attempt was made on the run by Ramos. It was almost possible to incorporate something else. Almost successful.\n38:11 Comment: Now he's been standing outside long enough. We're talking about Sandro Sirico now.\n38:16 Comment: Yes.\n38:17 Comment: He now replaces Enes Benazira. I can't diagnose an injury from up here anyway,\n38:25 Comment: let alone that I saw them. So I'll let it go. Tactical changes.\n38:33 Comment: Something fresh for the right side. Sirico, who came on in the 90th minute last weekend\n38:37 Comment: with this unfortunate Franke defeated Eintracht Frankfurt, is now on the\n38:43 Comment: right side and can now also try to bring in Guerreiro.\n38:47 Comment: It's...\n38:47 Comment: Tempe kisses the Leap.\n38:48 Comment: Daniel\n39:5 Comment: About Abs Assistance.\n39:11 Comment: Lünebrand the deal.\n39:13 Comment: That doesn't mean it's safe in 2019.\n39:14 Comment: They liked it or\n39:15 Comment: Can.\n39:15 Comment: Perhaps.\n39:16 Comment: Vühlschuss.\n39:46 Comment: then finally, that was nothing that would have caused any major problems\n40:16 Comment: the warurities\n40:39 Comment: What\n40:46 Comment: He was shown his limits.\n40:50 Comment: Keyword: mobility.\n40:52 Comment: Also with ball.\n40:54 Comment: Then he let him escape.\n40:56 Comment: Then he had had enough.\n40:59 Comment: And got out the scythe.\n41:2 Comment: Yellow.\n41:4 Comment: Second this season.\n41:6 Comment: No WNewtra post as it was 3-0 on 7.\n41:36 Comment: that he became European champion with the Portuguese national team in the summer.\n41:41 Comment: So I was still in this tournament for a very long time.\n41:43 Comment: You could also say until the end.\n41:46 Comment: And that's why I started training here late.\n41:50 Comment: Then it is hard to believe what he has been up to in the past few days.\n41:55 Comment: As I mentioned at the beginning, the best man in Warsaw.\n41:58 Comment: I would also say he was the best man in the first half against Darmstadt.\n42:1 Comment: Now there may be one or two people at home who say,\n42:4 Comment: yeah okay, Warsaw, half a dozen, we don't know exactly.\n42:8 Comment: What else is really coming from them?\n42:10 Comment: Isn’t that perhaps more like second-league level?\n42:14 Comment: Then Darmstadt, last year's promoted team, did not cover itself in glory in its first away game in Cologne.\n42:20 Comment: So even a young boy can let off steam there.\n42:22 Comment: But I think he does it really well.\n42:24 Comment: So a lot of good movements, good ideas, even a conclusion was already there.\n42:32 Comment: And yes.\n42:34 Comment: Warsaw and Darmstadt are, Michael Zorc, not Real Madrid.\n42:38 Comment: But they also need to be played with and edited first.\n42:41 Comment: And Guerreiro is doing well there.\n42:46 Comment: The receipt.\n43:4 Comment: That hurt Ramos.\n43:28 Comment: Now there are quiet discussions.\n43:31 Comment: Because yes.\n43:34 Comment: The Dortmunders say, if someone goes about things like that,\n43:42 Comment: then you can say that it is yellow-worthy.\n43:45 Comment: Also in the sense of a tactical foul.\n43:47 Comment: Benjamin Brandt then saw it that way with all due calm and acted accordingly.\n43:52 Comment: So yellow also for Niemeyer, who then complained,\n43:57 Comment: that there was something on the other side that he didn't like.\n44:0 Comment: I think we can then put that in the neglected category.\n44:4 Comment: Classify.\n44:5 Comment: It remains the case that if Borussia Dortmund, in addition to what they already have in terms of playing quality,\n44:12 Comment: If the pace is increased, Darmstadt will be overwhelmed.\n44:14 Comment: Offside.\n44:18 Comment: Eagle eye.\n44:30 Comment: Friedrich Asmuth.\n44:31 Comment: Yes.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Frankfurt even from the beginning and now he should try to\n0:4 Comment: Franschitz position then perhaps a little forward for Darmstadt to\n0:10 Comment: wear but they are back again\n0:13 Comment: Dortmund earns the sixth corner right at the beginning of this\n0:19 Comment: second half\n0:30 Comment: This will give you the next opportunity\n0:45 Comment: and the next corner\n0:55 Comment: again Guerreiro\n1:0 Comment: and the next Kannando pilot or\n1:3 Comment: R\":\n1:10 Comment: gumbo\n1:12 Comment: the more\n1:14 Comment: hasslack with Deurke\n1:17 Comment: be that that whose first ball contact is if we are not quite\n1:21 Comment: sure but Rómán Birki could have stayed in Warsaw\n1:27 Comment: or on the bank Keyword Bank\n1:30 Comment: And then Batra or Mohr or Götze or Aubameyang or Rode.\n1:36 Comment: Kagawa-san.\n1:39 Comment: You almost forget that Reus has been injured for a long time.\n1:45 Comment: That Schürrle is also out today.\n1:49 Comment: If all of that is on board, it's a nice competition.\n1:53 Comment: Almost every position at Darmstadt is not quite so well-known.\n2:0 Comment: And Norbert Mayer has already changed twice.\n2:4 Comment: Attention, attention, attention. 2-0.\n2:7 Comment: Ramos.\n2:22 Comment: In the first half it lasted seven minutes, in the second half it lasted two minutes.\n2:29 Comment: Until the end.\n2:30 Comment: Until the first hit.\n2:31 Comment: This time actually over the right side, which was played a little less in round 1.\n2:37 Comment: And then comes the long shot from, I think it was Weigel.\n2:43 Comment: And then, no, Guerreiro.\n2:46 Comment: And then Ramos.\n2:48 Comment: Of course, I really have to say, weaker than all the blue and white defenders.\n2:55 Comment: I don't think there's any blame to be made for him being able to get to the shot.\n2:59 Comment: That's a very good shot.\n2:59 Comment: That's good for now.\n3:0 Comment: He just can't get it far enough away and then Ramos is faster than everyone else.\n3:4 Comment: And scores his first goal of the season.\n3:14 Comment: He was also faster than Castro, by the way.\n3:16 Comment: If he had pushed the ball over the line, it would have been offside.\n3:20 Comment: So, with all the good performances that we have seen in terms of sport, we can also include Robert Schröder.\n3:27 Comment: The assistant who looked closely.\n3:29 Comment: And saw that Ramos was not in the paragraph.\n3:36 Comment: Yes there.\n3:58 Comment: this is a very good ball\n4:0 Comment: for the flank\n4:1 Comment: something that Darmstadt did last season\n4:4 Comment: has mastered it excellently\n4:6 Comment: Corners, free kicks, there were chances\n4:8 Comment: maybe now too\n4:10 Comment: Nope\n4:28 Comment: this time Jungwirth meets\n4:30 Comment: So as far as the defense is concerned we now have Milotowitsch, Niemeyer, Höhn and Jungwirth\n4:32 Comment: warned\n4:34 Comment: let's see\n4:36 Comment: whether Darmstadt\n4:38 Comment: finishes with 11 men\n4:40 Comment: that's a good ball\n4:42 Comment: for the flank\n4:44 Comment: that's a good ball\n4:46 Comment: for the flank\n4:48 Comment: that's a good ball\n4:50 Comment: for the flank\n4:52 Comment: that's a good ball\n4:54 Comment: for the flank\n4:56 Comment: that's a good ball\n4:58 Comment: for the flank\n5:0 Comment: that's a good ball\n5:2 Comment: for the flank\n5:4 Comment: That wasn't such a good ball\n5:6 Comment: Darmstadt\n5:8 Comment: that's a good ball\n5:10 Comment: Darmstadt\n5:12 Comment: it is a good ball\n5:14 Comment: Darmstadt\n5:16 Comment: that's a good ball\n5:22 Comment: it has doubled much\n5:24 Comment: how excited he seems\n5:26 Comment: without him\n5:28 Comment: would lose track\n5:58 Comment: I don't want to shout yet but at the moment it actually looks as if the guests\n6:12 Comment: the system would have changed a little from the four of the three five chain to the four chain but\n6:21 Comment: Of course, this can change again in seconds\n6:24 Comment: Leon Gubara in any case he is in midfield\n6:28 Comment: moved and now there is actually a shot on goal, the substitution\n6:36 Comment: by roman deszak already paid for premiere for darmstadt in this game\n6:58 Comment: but the most confident impression really does not make as if he had thought about it I can\n7:6 Comment: Catching it or not and then moving it forward is also a task for the goalkeeper\n7:13 Comment: in a game in which he was 0 challenged in the moment in which he is challenged also right there\n7:23 Comment: to be so scratched has hurt has in use of schiplock\n7:28 Comment: the 2 x 0 gfeife\n7:47 Comment: once again\n7:52 Comment: the\n7:55 Comment: claim in double half once so jet block now Tuchel and paslak\n7:56 Comment: Mouth in the leg\n7:57 Comment: Sports\n7:58 Comment: That's really well played.\n8:16 Comment: Class.\n8:18 Comment: And then you get rewarded.\n8:19 Comment: 3-0.\n8:22 Comment: Christian Pulisic.\n8:28 Comment: It doesn't always have to be the angle shot or the arrow pullback.\n8:42 Comment: I think the gate is a really pretty revelation.\n8:45 Comment: Dembélé dances and dances and then sees the gap into which Marcel Schmelzer advances.\n8:51 Comment: And even if this was perhaps a bit of a coincidence until Pulisic,\n8:56 Comment: because in Darmstadt he still had the tip of his foot in between.\n8:58 Comment: It's a wonderfully crafted goal.\n9:1 Comment: Here, there is the pass from the opponent.\n9:3 Comment: But Pulisic is there, no one in blue and white with him.\n9:7 Comment: It's a demonstration of how to deal with five or four men in a chain back there.\n9:15 Comment: From the first to the 55th minute.\n9:19 Comment: Dortmund plays pretty, attractive, determined, really good football.\n9:26 Comment: And therefore fully deserves a 3-0 lead.\n9:35 Comment: Of course, not everything can fit together at Darmstadt 98 yet.\n9:40 Comment: An attempt was made to integrate 14 new ones over the summer.\n9:44 Comment: Some of them arrived just before the start of the Bundesliga.\n9:47 Comment: 16 left.\n9:49 Comment: Of course, this won’t work overnight.\n9:52 Comment: But does that mean you have to imagine yourself as so passive?\n9:55 Comment: It almost seems as if it was clear from the outset\n9:59 Comment: All we want to do is avoid getting caught up in the wheels here.\n10:4 Comment: But even that doesn't seem to be working now that the score is 3-0 and there are still 35 minutes to play.\n10:25 Comment: Dortmund?\n10:33 Comment: This is a performance that I have now seen.\n10:35 Comment: Or give them a nice coat and a kiss that suits us.\n10:38 Comment: Because we are together.\n10:40 Comment: We will discuss this again\n10:47 Comment: that Darmstadt also had to say goodbye to a\n10:51 Comment: Willingness underground yes not stop\n10:55 Comment: qualitatively individually much more to offer that must also somehow acknowledge but with\n11:4 Comment: these free kicks and corner waves probably gave the BVB one or two chances\n11:11 Comment: brought there has to be attention he has to be there you have to be on the men and also the\n11:19 Comment: Darmstadt does not succeed, I think that is a worrying performance\n11:25 Comment: that belongs in the picture\n11:49 Comment: the captain representing Zulu has already picked up a yellow card in the first half\n11:53 Comment: and\n11:55 Comment: Even if he had somehow still been on the ball, from up here it looked as if\n12:3 Comment: it was not he can simply with money thought so not go in here so the ball has there\n12:9 Comment: nothing at all he wants to leave and then comes the open sole and directly on the ankle so\n12:14 Comment: This leads to the question: what does Darmstadt actually want here? What did it never want?\n12:24 Comment: more in this duel\n12:25 Comment: there is only 10 03 behind\n12:37 Comment: grant has everything under control and there anyway\n12:44 Comment: that was not for a penalty, I am also with the referee\n12:55 Comment: not update\n13:20 Comment: aten Chats\n13:21 Comment: because Willi\n13:24 Comment: that exists\n13:25 Comment: and then it's a bit harder.\n13:40 Comment: Even if Darmstadt 98 has the ball,\n13:43 Comment: This happens rarely enough,\n13:46 Comment: They have no plan at all,\n13:49 Comment: what you want to do with it once you have won it.\n13:52 Comment: This is a bit difficult.\n13:55 Comment: No counter-attacking football whatsoever.\n14:3 Comment: This raises the suspicion that\n14:6 Comment: that you arrived knowing that you had no chance.\n14:10 Comment: We have to play it.\n14:12 Comment: If we're lucky, we won't go under.\n14:15 Comment: That’s not enough for me personally.\n14:22 Comment: guarantees\n14:33 Comment: Diggers.\n14:48 Comment: He is foul.\n15:22 Comment: and it goes on.\n15:23 Comment: And then it happens again.\n15:26 Comment: Now it only remains high and\n15:28 Comment: far.\n15:30 Comment: But he even finds a\n15:32 Comment: Acceptor.\n15:34 Comment: The chess.\n15:52 Comment: jin for the man.\n15:55 Comment: Summer is evident\n15:58 Comment: W impairment.\n16:0 Comment: In the pit of Europe at\n16:17 Comment: ence.\n16:18 Comment: Wood here.\n16:20 Comment: Slash friend advertisement.\n16:50 Comment: Kolesic.\n16:55 Comment: Maslak.\n16:58 Comment: Weigl.\n17:4 Comment: A good hour has passed.\n17:5 Comment: Dortmund’s dominance has now also been reflected in the result.\n17:11 Comment: Or is about to reveal itself.\n17:13 Comment: 3-0. Nothing can go wrong here.\n17:16 Comment: At most, a little more for Darmstadt.\n17:19 Comment: The 2-pitcher.\n17:20 Comment: If Niemeyer is sent off with a yellow-red card,\n17:22 Comment: the others will have a little more to do,\n17:26 Comment: to close gaps.\n17:29 Comment: And Thomas Tuchel takes advantage of this interruption,\n17:32 Comment: to switch.\n17:36 Comment: Rafael Guerreiro.\n17:38 Comment: Take a quick listen.\n17:48 Comment: This is so deserved.\n17:51 Comment: The majority of the 81,000 receive this applause.\n17:56 Comment: Classic game today.\n17:59 Comment: Go out.\n18:1 Comment: And Kagawa comes in.\n18:5 Comment: And Thomas Tuchel has reserved the Remsnohr for Dembélé.\n18:12 Comment: And I am sure that when he has the ball,\n18:15 Comment: something happens again.\n18:20 Comment: That's not the case.\n18:24 Comment: But he has a defense system like Tuchel in mind.\n18:29 Comment: Mario Götze.\n18:31 Comment: Let's see if he adjusts his stockings.\n18:36 Comment: To then finally be back here in Dortmund\n18:42 Comment: to be allowed to be there.\n18:46 Comment: Mario Götze.\n19:14 Comment: Captain Spider is\n19:16 Comment: That was a little brighter.\n19:18 Comment: Gone over.\n19:24 Comment: That was Mohr’s first time on the ball.\n19:26 Comment: Kagawa joins in immediately.\n19:46 Comment: It's quite good.\n20:8 Comment: It didn't look so bad at first.\n20:10 Comment: But Schiblock needs support from outside.\n20:12 Comment: After the deployment of Julian Weigl.\n20:16 Comment: That's a good ball.\n20:22 Comment: Last season they had\n20:24 Comment: Stefanie Wagner.\n20:26 Comment: He also shot at the goal once.\n20:28 Comment: If you look at it like this,\n20:30 Comment: then my impression was confirmed,\n20:32 Comment: that one cannot blame Esser too much.\n20:34 Comment: He is happy that he can still get to the ball.\n20:36 Comment: Which Ramos then pushes over the line.\n20:38 Comment: And this is Pulisic.\n20:40 Comment: One day before his 18th birthday, by the way.\n20:46 Comment: To make it 3-0.\n20:48 Comment: He is a professional.\n20:50 Comment: So he will\n20:52 Comment: depending on the situation\n20:54 Comment: not celebrate extensively.\n20:56 Comment: For example, in the chairs.\n20:58 Comment: Again in the mind's eye.\n21:0 Comment: This 3 to 0.\n21:2 Comment: And then celebrate his birthday morning.\n21:4 Comment: That was the situation with Weigl and\n21:8 Comment: Ski block.\n21:16 Comment: Thank you.\n21:46 Comment: Did Amos have an arm out or did Agaba reach there first?\n22:8 Comment: I think that's the point.\n22:16 Comment: Agaba, Moor, Socrates, Schiblock.\n22:46 Comment: Of course, these are worlds colliding.\n22:54 Comment: The Dortmund team does not have much time, I think at the end of August, to review their financial statements\n23:0 Comment: of the past year.\n23:1 Comment: 376 million euros in sales.\n23:4 Comment: A profit of almost 30 million.\n23:7 Comment: This is of course related to the transfer activities.\n23:12 Comment: Gundogan, Hummels.\n23:14 Comment: Yes.\n23:16 Comment: So just from the profit that Dortmund has made in one year, Darmstadt can\n23:20 Comment: probably survive well for a year and a half.\n23:22 Comment: But completely Darmstadt.\n23:23 Comment: And accordingly, the footballing class is of course more clearly distributed.\n23:31 Comment: Dortmunders are shopping big during the summer break.\n23:37 Comment: Especially young people, who because of their class also need less time,\n23:43 Comment: to fit into a structure.\n23:45 Comment: I'm talking about Guerreiro.\n23:47 Comment: I'm talking about Dembélé.\n23:49 Comment: With some reservations, certainly also from Moor.\n23:52 Comment: Then there is also something that has been confessed.\n23:54 Comment: A world champion, Schürrle.\n23:56 Comment: Of course, this all has completely different consequences.\n24:0 Comment: You can work differently with more footballing quality.\n24:3 Comment: And with Norbert Maier, a lot of things started from scratch.\n24:6 Comment: Not least because he himself is active in Darmstadt for the first time this year.\n24:9 Comment: There is moor.\n24:10 Comment: Unpleasant shot.\n24:11 Comment: Esser is here.\n24:12 Comment: And then it's Darmstadt again.\n24:18 Comment: But he has to.\n24:19 Comment: Last chance to transfer at Darmstadt 98.\n24:30 Comment: It is now being implemented.\n24:32 Comment: For Schiblock, things don’t go any further after all.\n24:34 Comment: So now it's Mirko, Antonio Mirkozorro, Scholler's turn.\n24:41 Comment: Yes.\n24:44 Comment: But\n25:8 Comment: What did it was the mark.\n25:9 Comment: What?\n25:10 Comment: Four times Hilarie at the house?\n25:11 Comment: Yes, that's right.\n25:12 Comment: always.\n25:13 Comment: Let's see if he actually plays left back there.\n25:18 Comment: I actually can't imagine that.\n25:21 Comment: The 29er, massive!\n25:25 Comment: Shepherd!\n25:27 Comment: And on the square with the number 18, Sebastian!\n25:29 Comment: Moose!\n25:41 Comment: Moose Corner.\n25:43 Comment: It was a bit short, but he had the opportunity.\n25:46 Comment: To be allowed to do it again now.\n25:52 Comment: Borussia Dortmund’s corner count is now in double figures.\n26:0 Comment: 10 to 1 corners for BVB.\n26:4 Comment: That was nothing either.\n26:6 Comment: And there is Rohde.\n26:10 Comment: Last man.\n26:12 Comment: That was nothing either.\n26:14 Comment: And there is Rohde.\n26:18 Comment: That was nothing either.\n26:21 Comment: And there is Rohde.\n26:31 Comment: That was nothing either.\n26:37 Comment: It is understandable that Thomas Tuchel has now also used all three transfer options,\n26:42 Comment: because the Bundesliga continues during the week\n26:45 Comment: and in Wolfsburg.\n26:51 Comment: Tuesday and Wednesday are Bundesliga match days.\n26:53 Comment: And if you then Wednesday evening\n26:54 Comment: after the Bundesliga matchday\n26:58 Comment: nothing planned yet, 11pm,\n26:59 Comment: I can recommend a documentation to you.\n27:2 Comment: The ultras under pressure.\n27:12 Comment: The real fans,\n27:14 Comment: at least as they understand themselves.\n27:18 Comment: I think that the\n27:19 Comment: a very\n27:21 Comment: interesting film will be\n27:23 Comment: from colleague Klaus Fiedler.\n27:44 Comment: Thank you.\n28:14 Comment: Darmstadt is given a chance here.\n28:18 Comment: The birthday man.\n28:22 Comment: She did, but she couldn't have expected it.\n28:27 Comment: Weigel.\n28:30 Comment: This is the most successful goalscorer,\n28:31 Comment: As far as competitive matches are concerned,\n28:32 Comment: Antonio Mirko Czolak.\n28:34 Comment: Because he hit me three times in the cup.\n28:36 Comment: But that was the\n28:38 Comment: Bremen SV.\n28:44 Comment: He quickly went to the\n28:46 Comment: Flying player with fino.\n28:49 Comment: Then her Henzen\n28:52 Comment: be pσει,\n28:53 Comment: undy White.\n28:55 Comment: Now again如何 a\n28:56 Comment: the s\n29:12 Comment: Leipzig,\n29:13 Comment: consumed.\n29:14 Comment: An eye on the defensive side has often enough addressed this afternoon how\n29:21 Comment: Do you actually want to evaluate Dortmund's defensive behavior? That was not asked\n29:44 Comment: darmstadt still has to survive a quarter of an hour here kagawa\n30:14 Comment: and 길 floor\n30:31 Comment: the\n30:38 Comment: freed\n30:44 Comment: Weigel can't get to that point. But he can!\n30:55 Comment: Moor also works backwards.\n30:57 Comment: So in this respect, Dortmund's defensive behaviour can be taken into account here and there in the evaluation.\n31:5 Comment: If they lose the ball, then they are alert enough.\n31:9 Comment: Everything that Darmstadt tries to do up front has to be stopped immediately.\n31:13 Comment: But since there is really little plan, it is also very little.\n31:18 Comment: Moor.\n31:21 Comment: Grode.\n31:24 Comment: Kagawa-san.\n31:28 Comment: And I think he hit Sandu Siriku right in the middle of his body.\n31:40 Comment: And here it is.\n31:43 Comment: But things continue for Siriku.\n31:58 Comment: It has to be, because Norbert Mayer has already changed three times.\n32:8 Comment: The same goes for Thomas Tuchel, by the way.\n32:10 Comment: So the Mario Götze issue has changed here with the substitution of Rode.\n32:13 Comment: And that's what he did with the ball for today.\n32:15 Comment: Maybe Tuchel will wait until the home game against Real Madrid.\n32:23 Comment: Then things would come full circle, because that would be Götze’s last appearance in the black and yellow jersey.\n32:31 Comment: At home.\n32:34 Comment: And now let’s fine-tune Castro 4-0.\n32:43 Comment: Thomas Tuchel accepts another gem with astonishing calm.\n32:56 Comment: Gonzalo Castro with the 4-0.\n32:58 Comment: I mean, of course Darmstadt is one man less.\n33:0 Comment: But you also have to use it accordingly.\n33:3 Comment: And the completion of this gate image is achieved with very fine brushstrokes.\n33:12 Comment: Pulisic.\n33:12 Comment: Once.\n33:13 Comment: Now one prepared.\n33:18 Comment: He scored the goal from the right.\n33:20 Comment: Now he has gone over to the left through the change.\n33:23 Comment: However, it did not change its accuracy.\n33:27 Comment: Great, great preparatory work for Gonzalo Castro.\n33:30 Comment: Two goalscorers this afternoon.\n33:34 Comment: You just have to be able to make it look easy.\n33:39 Comment: Like Borussia Dortmund this afternoon.\n34:41 Comment: and the strength in corners and\n34:43 Comment: Free kicks lost.\n34:45 Comment: Dortmund despite the prominent\n34:47 Comment: Departures and upheaval\n34:49 Comment: Strength in corners and\n34:51 Comment: Free kicks lost.\n34:53 Comment: Dortmund despite the prominent\n34:55 Comment: Departures and upheaval\n34:57 Comment: Strength in corners and\n34:59 Comment: Free kicks lost.\n35:1 Comment: Dortmund despite the prominent\n35:3 Comment: Departures and upheaval\n35:5 Comment: Strength in corners and\n35:7 Comment: Free kicks lost.\n35:9 Comment: Dortmund despite the prominent\n35:11 Comment: Departures and upheaval\n35:13 Comment: Strength in corners and free kicks\n35:15 Comment: lost.\n35:17 Comment: Dortmund despite the prominent\n35:19 Comment: Departures and upheaval\n35:21 Comment: Strength in corners and free kicks\n35:23 Comment: lost.\n35:25 Comment: Maybe even something\n35:27 Comment: Speed, which is\n35:29 Comment: element of surprise.\n35:31 Comment: Dortmund even has a little\n35:33 Comment: what was gained.\n35:35 Comment: And if all this\n35:37 Comment: first sets and the mechanisms\n35:39 Comment: that is what the Dortmund\n35:41 Comment: say for yourself. Of course there will be a few\n35:43 Comment: There may be swings up and down.\n35:45 Comment: Look at Leipzig, where people were not so\n35:47 Comment: very much in the game, but lost at the end\n35:49 Comment: even deserves it. But if this young\n35:51 Comment: team, this\n35:53 Comment: Highly gifted, with so much potential\n35:55 Comment: equipped team over\n35:57 Comment: Weeks and months, maybe then\n35:59 Comment: yes, even over years, the chance has\n36:1 Comment: to grow, then I could\n36:3 Comment: present, they will be presented here\n36:5 Comment: in the Signal Iduna Park\n36:7 Comment: celebrate one or two parties.\n36:9 Comment: That's how it is now.\n36:11 Comment: And Ramos,\n36:13 Comment: Bode would also have been willing\n36:15 Comment: he has that behind him\n36:17 Comment: no longer seen.\n36:19 Comment: And then he has the\n36:21 Comment: Half, here is\n36:23 Comment: half,\n36:25 Comment: and then he\n36:27 Comment: the half,\n36:29 Comment: and then he\n36:31 Comment: the half,\n36:33 Comment: and then he\n36:35 Comment: the game again\n36:37 Comment: played.\n36:39 Comment: You are\n36:41 Comment: briefly checked whether\n36:43 Comment: Ramos stands again and because he does it,\n36:45 Comment: the ball runs\n36:47 Comment: then further.\n36:49 Comment: And at this moment\n36:51 Comment: is it\n36:53 Comment: now\n36:55 Comment: Ramos,\n36:57 Comment: he must\n36:59 Comment: again\n37:1 Comment: on\n37:3 Comment: the\n37:5 Comment: ball\n37:7 Comment: place.\n37:9 Comment: Every time Pulisic starts, the Darmstadt 3 defense faces an almost impossible task.\n37:21 Comment: This is a very, very sobering performance.\n37:27 Comment: Last season, there was one at home, when they lost 4-0 to Hertha on matchday 16.\n37:36 Comment: Otherwise, they played a great round and saved themselves on the penultimate match day in Berlin.\n37:49 Comment: And that was a small football miracle.\n37:54 Comment: But this season, these are the first impressions, with three match days almost played, seems to be getting a bit more difficult.\n38:3 Comment: Because the 0-2 defeat of Cologne didn’t really hit home either.\n38:6 Comment: It seems like the balance of power was there on the pitch.\n38:8 Comment: Cologne were much closer to scoring a third or fourth goal than the visitors were to an away goal.\n38:14 Comment: In the 1-0 win against Frankfurt, a cross had to find its way into the goal.\n38:18 Comment: Otherwise, almost nothing offensively.\n38:21 Comment: And today they saw it.\n38:28 Comment: Whether this is enough to become a major issue at Sky 90 is something others will have to decide.\n38:32 Comment: But I may invite you to Patrick Wasserzieher’s.\n38:36 Comment: Gastronomy.\n38:36 Comment: To be like this, 7.30 p.m., tomorrow, as they are used to.\n38:42 Comment: Christoph Daum definitely has something to say, I am sure of that.\n38:48 Comment: Gastronomy.\n38:50 Comment: Oh, the hoe again.\n38:52 Comment: This time Rode.\n38:54 Comment: Red.\n39:6 Comment: It is not only a demonstration of Dortmund's calmness coupled with wit, but it\n39:20 Comment: is also a dismantling of darmstadt 98 gap by gap tracked down exploited and then completed\n39:30 Comment: first castro then rode\n39:37 Comment: In Warsaw they both sat on the bench today they come in, one as a substitute\n39:45 Comment: the other from the beginning and then screw the result to a clear 15 0 to 1\n39:55 Comment: which on the one hand does not allow for any major questions but\n40:0 Comment: and that with their fill game already a second ges lattice\n40:11 Comment: there will be some loved the\n40:20 Comment: what is that and in a few minutes that was a performance by darmstadt 98 you can\n40:27 Comment: that something like this could succeed again was from the first minute\n40:34 Comment: an away game in which one only ran after, only accompanied, only watched\n40:42 Comment: and so darmstadt 98 did not appear then there are five in dortmund or maybe\n40:52 Comment: even watch six times what the last five minutes will bring and what the team\n40:57 Comment: Last year, this team spirit was distinguished by the unconditional\n41:0 Comment: will to prevent something and then also to bend something in front, that was nowhere to be seen today\n41:21 Comment: and again\n41:27 Comment: These are very beautifully staged attacks even if the opponent after the exposure\n41:35 Comment: by peter niemeyer one man less is already a number of teams have had a hard time\n41:43 Comment: done then to keep the rhythm to develop further opportunities and then to exploit them\n41:57 Comment: without\n42:21 Comment: became\n42:27 Comment: and again Pulisic that's madness\n42:40 Comment: Now he has enjoyed something, namely another demonstration of how to lead a team that\n43:0 Comment: but really only runs after the game between Pulisic and then Moore\n43:6 Comment: I believe it directly\n43:10 Comment: He refused to do that but we got the ball under control and then\n43:16 Comment: the overview at the end keeps that's class 6 to 0 the first Bundesliga goal\n43:27 Comment: is currently learning to be a professional and to be a professional in a big club\n43:38 Comment: and\n43:40 Comment: the first devenir that the parties\n43:43 Comment: fundamental\n44:1 Comment: and also has joy\n44:6 Comment: was nothing\n44:8

    "summary": "On a day when Borussia Dortmund welcomed Darmstadt to Signal Iduna Park, the atmosphere was electric as the teams prepared to face off in an exciting Bundesliga fixture. The stage was set for a thrilling encounter, but the game unfolded in a manner that firmly established Dortmund’s dominance from start to finish. This 6-0 victory marked an emphatic win for Dortmund, neatly highlighting the gulf in class between the sides.\n\nFrom the first whistle, it was clear that Dortmund was the more organized and ambitious team. They began by exerting immediate pressure on Darmstadt, quickly taking control of the game. Dortmund's strategy was to circulate the ball swiftly, maintain high possession, and probe for gaps within Darmstadt's defensive setup.\n\nIn the initial minutes, Dortmund's patience in build-up play was evident. They demonstrated excellent ball control and movement, successfully pulling Darmstadt’s defense out of position. The meticulous approach bore fruit in the seventh minute when Gonzalo Castro opened the scoring. A well-timed pass saw Castro unmarked in the box, and he made no mistake, giving Dortmund a deserved early lead. This goal immediately set the tone for what was to come and brought palpable joy to the Dortmund supporters.\n\nDortmund continued to dominate possession, and their aggressive pressing left Darmstadt struggling for any form of control. Darmstadt's attempts to push forward were minimal, and when they tried, they were efficiently snuffed out by Dortmund's defense led by Sokratis and Schmelzer.\n\nDarmstadt’s defensive solidity was put to the test repeatedly. Every forward pass from Dortmund seemed to be aimed at stretching and breaking Darmstadt's defensive lines. The visitors’ strategy of sitting deep and relying on occasional counter-attacks yielded little, as Dortmund’s tactical discipline ensured that Darmstadt broke forward rarely and with no real threat.\n\nAs Dortmund's dominance continued to grow, Marcelo Schmelzer and Ousmane Dembélé had several promising moments, combining well on the left flank. Castro, once again involved, was a constant threat in the midfield, orchestrating plays and ensuring Dortmund’s attacking motion retained its fluidity and unpredictability.\n\nIn the second half, barely had the fans settled back in their seats when Dortmund doubled their lead. On this occasion, it was Ramos who capitalized on a lapse in Darmstadt’s defense. His agility and quick thinking allowed him to get the better of the defenders, confidently slotting the ball past the Darmstadt goalkeeper to make it 2-0. This quick goal so early in the half effectively crushed any hopes Darmstadt might have harbored for a comeback.\n\nThe pattern of the match remained unchanged; Dortmund kept the pressure high and the ball movement rapid. Each attack was characterized by intricate passing and deft touches that often left the Darmstadt defenders chasing shadows. Dortmund’s third goal came from the exceptional talent of Christian Pulisic, who showcased his skills and composure in front of the goal. The build-up to this goal included marvelous interplays with Dembele and Schmelzer.\n\nAs the match progressed, Mohammad Dahoud and Pulisic continued to impress, each showcasing their ball-handling skills and vision on the field, making it increasingly difficult for Darmstadt to keep pace. Even as the midfield comprised mostly young players and new signings, the cohesion within Dortmund’s ranks remained impeccable, a testament to the tactical acumen of their manager, Thomas Tuchel.\n\nWith the scoreline favoring Dortmund heavily, changes were made to introduce fresh legs and perhaps test new combinations post their Champions League clash earlier in the week. Tuchel didn't hesitate to bring on players like Shinji Kagawa and Mario Götze, further emphasizing the depth and quality present within the Dortmund squad.\n\nDortmund's fourth goal was another masterclass in teamwork and precise execution. Pulisic once more was pivotal, setting up Gonzalo Castro who made a text-book finish. Castro's experience and calmness ensured he directed the ball past the hapless Darmstadt defense and goalkeeper, underscoring the clinical nature of Dortmund’s play.\n\nA notable aspect of Dortmund's performance was their defensive resilience. Despite their attacking inclinations, the defensive unit comprising Bürki, Sokratis, and Schmelzer ensured that Darmstadt had virtually no clear-cut opportunities. The organization at the back was solid, reflecting the team's overall balance and technical discipline.\n\nAs the game neared its final phase, it was evident that Darmstadt was in a state of damage control, attempting to avoid further humiliation. However, the relentless pressure from Dortmund resulted in another goal, making it 5-0. Mahmoud Dahoud’s involvement demonstrated that central midfield control, linking up well with the forwards and maintaining the tempo of the game.\n\nDarmstadt’s woes were compounded in the final minutes. Facing an onslaught from a highly motivated Dortmund attack, their defense, weakened earlier by individual errors and cards, was breached once more. Pulisic capped off the day with a stellar run, orchestrating a perfect assist to Moor, who tapped in effortlessly. This final strike sealed a comprehensive 6-0 victory, an absolute demolition that echoed Dortmund’s superiority.\n\nThis match was more than just a win for Dortmund; it was a statement. The fluidity in their play, the tactical brilliance, and the individual performances were all pointers to a team in top form with high ambitions. It was a game where every player contributed to an overwhelming display of football that left the fans in awe and the opponents in disarray.\n\nEnsuring that every moment from kickoff to the final whistle was controlled, Dortmund showcased why they are considered top contenders in the Bundesliga. The mix of experienced players stepping up and the youthful exuberance displayed by talents like Pulisic and Dembélé provided a balanced recipe for success.\n\nDarmstadt, facing an uphill task from the minute they took to the pitch, will have to recalibrate for future fixtures. Learning from such a lopsided defeat will be crucial for them to ensure competitiveness in the league.\n\nFor Dortmund, this game stood as a milestone, reinforcing their position as giants of German football. The six-goal margin didn't just emphasize their offensive capabilities but also hinted at a defensive solidity that could hold them in good stead for tougher tests ahead. Substitutions appeared seamless, maintaining intensity and strategy, and the depth of the squad promises much more in the season.\n\nConclusively, the 6-0 hammering of Darmstadt by Dortmund is a detailed, resounding reminder of why football is as much about preparation and strategy as it is about talent and execution. It was an exhibition of skill, and while the scoreline favored the home team overwhelmingly, the story on the pitch was that of a well-oiled machine working in perfect harmony. \n\n\n"
