FC Köln in these first 5 minutes.\n5:21 Comment: To have been very active at the front twice already.\n5:33 Comment: Standing at the 16th can't work.\n5:35 Comment: Peter Stöger said.\n5:37 Comment: It was really for him, as for everyone,\n5:40 Comment: who is dealing with Borussia Dortmund, is not so easy.\n5:42 Comment: Was especially who wants to play in the run economists до illnesses.\n5:45 Comment: Summary AO defeats of the prog\n6:6 Comment: back.\n6:9 Comment: So to take away Dortmund's enthusiasm for the game where they get it, in midfield, pick up the pace and then really step on the gas up front.\n6:20 Comment: That is the task of Nosako and the others. Things aren't looking bad at the beginning.\n7:9 Comment: Modest. Couldn't pass to Roteneffs because he would have been offside.\n7:26 Comment: It slips through to Roteneffs. Of course, that was not a penalty in any way.\n7:39 Comment: Dembélé. Heinz comes out immediately. Cologne want to defend a little more man-oriented than they usually do.\n8:5 Comment: Heinz against Dembélé. I think Mavray is looking at Aubameyang.\n8:9 Comment: Hector makes sure that Dom doesn’t get too rebellious.\n8:15 Comment: Which of course means that Cologne will have a back five.\n8:19 Comment: When it happens as quickly as it does here. Reus! Reus! Dortmund is leading, but it's offside.\n8:27 Comment: That was fast.\n8:34 Comment: Correct decision.\n8:35 Comment: So both...\n8:39 Comment: Both Thorsten Schiffner and Marco Achtmüller have done their homework and are supporting Felix Zweier well and correctly in the first ten minutes.\n8:58 Comment: Aubameyang.

Reus.\n9:41 Comment: With combined forces.\n9:43 Comment: And then Aubameyang overdid it against Kessler.\n9:46 Comment: And two makes it really weighted first.\n9:49 Comment: So that there is no hectic atmosphere in the first place.\n9:51 Comment: So, Kessler grabs it and then the rebound comes from Aubameyang.\n9:54 Comment: And then it goes on.\n9:55 Comment: And then it continues.\n10:8 Comment: And then comes the reinforcements from Aubameyang.\n10:10 Comment: But everything is still such that you don't have to worry too much about it.\n10:13 Comment: Great defensive play from Nolkowski, who prevented Aubameyang from doing so.\n10:18 Comment: And then comes the reinforcements from Aubameyang.\n10:21 Comment: And then it continues.\n10:33 Comment: Smelter.\n10:36 Comment: He didn't ask very close either.\n10:37 Comment: Smelter.\n10:47 Comment: He didn't run any faster either.\n10:51 Comment: Then there is experience.\n10:57 Comment: pai\n10:58 Comment: Music\n11:2 Comment: CD\n11:36 Comment: Lots of ball control at Borussia Dortmund.\n11:45 Comment: Dembelesi just lost.

FC Köln.\n22:16 Comment: Since Cologne were promoted again, they have not lost against BVB.\n22:21 Comment: Two wins here at home and two draws.\n22:26 Comment: What feels like a much longer series for Dortmund, by the way, is something they are not used to at all,\n22:29 Comment: that there is someone in the Bundesliga against whom they just don't win at a certain pace.\n22:35 Comment: That means that they skip once, twice at the most, but four times, oh, that doesn't really happen.\n22:41 Comment: So, free kick, completely justified, two has everything under control.\n22:49 Comment: And Aubameyang will start again soon.\n22:51 Comment: And then it will start.\n22:51 Comment: It looks like...\n23:21 Comment: Reus would be happy to take on the matter, as he is still waiting for his goal this season, which is surprising considering he is only playing in the Bundesliga for the third time today.\n23:31 Comment: But in the Champions League, he has already scored.\n23:50 Comment: 24 minutes.\n23:51 Comment: He looks good.\n23:53 Comment: But it's not good enough.\n23:57 Comment: Nevertheless, his coach is absolutely right when he says that Reus made a great comeback.\n24:10 Comment: Nice scenes here.\n24:13 Comment: Even if Thomas Tuchel doesn’t like everything he sees.\n24:15 Comment: The 0-0 is something he probably won't like, for example.\n24:19 Comment: Although, despite all...\n24:21 Comment: Game superiority.\n24:23 Comment: Borussia Dortmund was not able to create any great chances.\n24:29 Comment: And he will now have to decide, for better or worse, to change quite early.\n24:36 Comment: In any case, there is activity at the Dortmund bank.\n24:40 Comment: Bartra gets ready.\n24:43 Comment: And...\n24:53 Comment: Normally it would be Socrates or Ginter who are no longer able to do so.\n24:58 Comment: But I didn't notice anything.\n25:5 Comment: So let's just wait and see.\n25:9 Comment: That's too far for Aubameya.\n25:10 Comment: Yes.\n25:21 Comment: Modest.\n25:41 Comment: Sören is in time for Marco Reus.\n26:11 Comment: He waits and waits.\n26:15 Comment: Now we know what's going on.\n26:19 Comment: Klischek waited because he had to get out.\n26:23 Comment: We will stay tuned to find out what the reasons are.\n26:27 Comment: At first glance there was nothing to be seen.\n26:31 Comment: He would have hurt himself.\n26:35 Comment: He's going straight into the cabin.\n26:39 Comment: It looks like,\n26:41 Comment: that he not only justifies the substitution.\n26:45 Comment: He simply makes it necessary.\n26:49 Comment: Previously, he didn't even make 30-minute substitutions per game.\n26:53 Comment: Mbatha takes over the part that Klischek has played so far.\n26:57 Comment: Mostly against Modest on the right side.\n27:9 Comment: Technical error at Schmelzer.\n27:11 Comment: Man workoutet Ted Van B est afterオen,\n27:19 Comment: but also interpersonalistically.\n27:21 Comment: That's good.\n27:23 Comment: He shoots Dame Itís Hesseem 8 dearly.\n27:27 Comment: This is an away-digitt,\n27:29 Comment: whoever lets this be played now,\n27:31 Comment: but the vehicle that has to accept this ...\n27:35 Comment: but he praised Brosenthal.\n27:37 Comment: Experimental follow-up.\n27:39 Comment: That was a good free shot.\n27:41 Comment: Very good free shot.\n27:43 Comment: And Cologne leads 1-0.\n27:45 Comment: Artyom Srupnevs scores his first goal of the season.\n27:48 Comment: Weidenfeller is dissatisfied.\n27:50 Comment: Of course from a free kick,\n27:52 Comment: where everyone orientates themselves.\n27:54 Comment: But it's not like he's playing the same game.\n27:57 Comment: It's a good free shot.\n27:59 Comment: He did that too.\n28:3 Comment: He kept the lead.\n28:5 Comment: The man held on too.\n28:7 Comment: He did that too.\n28:9 Comment: And that's what he did.\n28:11 Comment: And that's exactly what he did.\n28:13 Comment: And that's what he did.\n28:15 Comment: And he held on.\n28:17 Comment: And that's what he did.\n28:19 Comment: He held on too.\n28:25 Comment: There are many agreements.\n28:29 Comment: Who is assigned to whom.\n28:31 Comment: Here comes Artyom Srupnevs.\n28:33 Comment: He can take responsibility.\n28:37 Comment: Whether it has anything to do with the substitution,\n28:39 Comment: that the Dortmunders have to form up,\n28:41 Comment: is a question for later.\n28:43 Comment: But I think so,\n28:45 Comment: that if I have one against Artyom Srupnevs\n29:11 Comment: sent,\n29:12 Comment: that I am on the Schl вроде\n29:15 Comment: He certainly has more to offer in terms of running than both of them.\n29:20 Comment: Because he helps the team.\n29:22 Comment: And not just with goals, but with commitment.\n29:24 Comment: But now this effort is finally being rewarded with a goal.\n29:28 Comment: Against Borussia Dortmund.\n29:35 Comment: This is more than just a small point victory after exactly half an hour.\n29:39 Comment: This is something that might now give Borussia Dortmund something to think about.\n29:46 Comment: We actually have everything under control.\n29:48 Comment: Everything looks good up until the penalty area.\n29:50 Comment: But nothing more.\n29:51 Comment: But it's still enough. At some point someone will slip in.\n29:54 Comment: No, it is not like that.\n29:56 Comment: One slipped in on the other side.\n29:59 Comment: And now we have to stretch ourselves twice as hard to avoid being winless against the young 1. FC Köln.\n30:9 Comment: Badra.\n30:33 Comment: Most recently, Cologne played 0-0 against Augsburg at home.\n30:36 Comment: Then there was the 0-4 from Hoffenheim.\n30:39 Comment: What in Badra.\n30:39 Comment: Given the height, it certainly shouldn't have been like that.\n30:42 Comment: But they didn’t score a goal there either.\n30:44 Comment: But against Dortmund it works.\n30:46 Comment: And this also reveals one of Borussia’s weak points.\n30:50 Comment: As he himself said, it was Thomas Tuchel.\n30:53 Comment: We just have to defend better.\n30:55 Comment: We concede too many goals.\n30:57 Comment: It is only 1 o'clock today.\n30:59 Comment: But from the free kick.\n31:9 Comment: V\n31:15 Comment: The\n31:16 Comment: Weather\n31:17 Comment: Only\n31:18 Comment: Water\n31:19 Comment: Out of\n31:20 Comment: The\n31:21 Comment: How\n31:21 Comment: The\n31:22 Comment: Naturally\n31:23 Comment: PS\n31:24 Comment: The\n31:24 Comment: sweep\n31:25 Comment: 3\n31:26 Comment: ama\n31:26 Comment: 3\n31:27 Comment: 2\n31:27 Comment: 1\n31:28 Comment: 500\n31:28 Comment: M\n31:33 Comment: 6\n31:34 Comment: kilo\n31:35 Comment: 1\n31:36 Comment: 2\n31:37 Comment: 1\n31:37 Comment: in\n31:38 Comment: Badra\n31:39 Comment: To in n exactly.\n31:39 Comment: That's great in Berlin.\n31:54 Comment: Where there is joy and where there is sadness.\n32:9 Comment: What's going on now?\n32:14 Comment: Felix Zweier, at least.\n32:18 Comment: He obviously saw the need to have a more detailed conversation with Captain Hector.\n32:39 Comment: Today they make shapeslight.\n33:9 Comment: The next ball was played too sloppily by Reus.\n33:16 Comment: or other\n33:18 Comment: Now the finest running robe is waiting for Erl� enterprise,\n33:21 Comment: But the Kammerer in a Perim programming\n33:24 Comment: Film schư� opiniert,\n33:41 Comment: grains on\n33:42 Comment: bot and drives little\n33:44 Comment: marketing\n33:44 Comment: a little\n33:45 Comment: work\n33:46 Comment: certainly\n33:46 Comment: It's like collecting diligence points, but in a targeted manner.\n33:54 Comment: With an idea going forward to really test Cologne at the back.\n33:58 Comment: These are the fewest actions.\n34:3 Comment: Castro.\n34:10 Comment: Ginter.\n34:16 Comment: That was not a good idea from Höger.\n34:20 Comment: Luckily, they'll correct his mistake back there.\n34:46 Comment: Next attempt from Marco Reus.\n35:16 Comment: Hector is in between.\n35:16 Comment: And then there is applause for Castro.\n35:22 Comment: So, let’s look at the gate again.\n35:24 Comment: Dom is initially with Hutneffs and then loses sight of him completely.\n35:33 Comment: And whoever wants to can understand that.\n35:37 Comment: Black and yellow, wow, relief.\n35:39 Comment: And on the left at 1. FC Köln there are no tears of joy either.\n35:43 Comment: Hello, 1-0 Cologne.\n35:46 Comment: Black and yellow, wow, relief.\n36:16 Comment: Initial phase, but now he is just getting started like many others.\n36:27 Comment: What do I say about Aubameyang? You might as well ask at this point.\n36:29 Comment: He actually doesn't take part in this game at all.\n36:36 Comment: Batra.\n36:39 Comment: Out of reach for smelters.\n36:40 Comment: In the case of Aubameyang, yes, he was involved once when the flag was rightly raised against an offside goal.\n36:46 Comment: Black and yellow, wow, relief.\n36:46 Comment: But otherwise there is little to see of the pace that Borussia Dortmund is actually capable of bringing onto the pitch.\n36:56 Comment: His team is doing well.\n36:58 Comment: So something was impressive in the first five hours.\n37:1 Comment: There were definitely a few gaps.\n37:3 Comment: Dortmund did not take advantage of this consistently.\n37:4 Comment: But then they steadily worked their way in here.\n37:7 Comment: Had this chance from Öttschang right at the beginning.\n37:11 Comment: And they made it 1-0 through Rutenes, which they now use to get through this game relatively well.\n37:25 Comment: This is how problems arise.\n37:34 Comment: Schmelzer gets his free kick.\n37:42 Comment: And you get 24 hours of sports news on Sky Sport News HD.\n37:48 Comment: They know that.\n37:49 Comment: But the broadcast slot has changed.\n37:50 Comment: That's why I can only tell you to aim for 200.\n37:54 Comment: And then there's everything you need to know about the sport.\n37:58 Comment: Competently.\n37:59 Comment: On Sky Sport News HD.\n38:4 Comment: Rutenes.\n38:21 Comment: Weigel.\n38:24 Comment: Yes, Rutenes followed up from behind again.\n38:27 Comment: But to me it looked like he had clearly played the ball.\n38:30 Comment: I think Höker sees it that way too.\n38:34 Comment: So, of course he's coming from the side at quite a bit of speed.\n38:42 Comment: But he clearly plays the ball.\n38:44 Comment: For me it's not necessarily a case of blowing the whistle.\n38:57 Comment: It is not Reus, after his rather modest attempts so far, but Castro who is now trying a little more dangerously.\n39:4 Comment: To develop with this free kick.\n39:8 Comment: So much for danger.\n39:10 Comment: Socrates complains that he has sinned.\n39:14 Comment: And impresses two people moderately.\n39:24 Comment: Greek temperament.\n39:27 Comment: What Borussia Dortmund has been offering here for about 15 to 20 minutes has not had enough temperament.\n39:33 Comment: By the way, these are some of the injured.\n39:34 Comment: Lehmann, you see there.\n39:38 Comment: Heavily furred.\n39:42 Comment: Bettenkurt was also there.\n39:45 Comment: The Cologne team has now reached the end of this...\n39:47 Comment: Very good effort from Osako.\n39:49 Comment: Oh, and given away a little too carelessly.\n39:52 Comment: We now have considerable injury concerns at the end of this first half of the season.\n39:55 Comment: Horn at the very back of the goal area.\n39:57 Comment: Well represented by Kessler, but Horn is a different caliber.\n40:3 Comment: Not number 1 for nothing.\n40:4 Comment: Wittenkurt, Lehmann, Risse since last weekend.\n40:12 Comment: Dominic Marot.\n40:15 Comment: They are all missing.\n40:17 Comment: Simon Zoller is also not there today, having fallen on his shoulder in Hoffenheim and is not free of symptoms.\n40:22 Comment: And that needs to be addressed first.\n40:25 Comment: And Cologne are capable of doing so in this first half.\n40:28 Comment: Two finds himself in a situation where he is a bit more petty.\n40:34 Comment: And then it goes on.\n40:36 Comment: Then you have to go for your understanding.\n40:40 Comment: Next free kick chance for Dortmund.\n40:42 Comment: Nothing from the game.\n40:44 Comment: Nothing from the free kicks so far either.\n40:46 Comment: Doesn't have to stay that way.\n40:51 Comment: They provide tutoring.\n41:4 Comment: And Reusdorf again.\n41:19 Comment: These free kicks are like Dortmund's game.\n41:24 Comment: Of cultivated harmlessness.\n41:34 Comment: Upper Sea.\n42:4 Comment: Dembele.\n42:13 Comment: Offside Modest.\n42:24 Comment: Also quite clear.\n42:34 Comment: Dembélé overdoes his dribbling.\n42:47 Comment: And then the ball is gone.\n42:51 Comment: These are all moments that could get Thomas Tuchel worked up.\n42:58 Comment: Then the thought occurs that something happened after Frankfurt.\n43:3 Comment: The beginning in the round.\n43:4 Comment: The beginning of this game was quite good.\n43:7 Comment: But what crept into Dortmund’s game from the 15th and 20th minutes onwards,\n43:14 Comment: is then a fair amount of lethargy.\n43:17 Comment: Lots of possession, nothing else.\n43:20 Comment: And then another deficit.\n43:34 Comment: It's actually a lot newer.\n43:38 Comment: If Van Gaal is honest with him, he won't be back.\n43:44 Comment: Knowing how to get to Bernats cuerden\n43:47 Comment: Your designations\n43:50 Comment: As a result, Mr Tuchel in the AAA comrade attacked the Valerieninstitute of Bayern to the round看看 You expose\n43:55 Comment: u calm on the ball\n43:58 Comment: Of course it also had to do with technical quality, overview, etc.\n44:3 Comment: Then\n44:3 Comment: they could look even better here.\n44:8 Comment: Play out one or the other attack,\n44:11 Comment: because you don't give it away straight away.\n44:14 Comment: This is the situation in which Röger and Weigel\n44:19 Comment: both hurt, but they're both moved on.\n44:33 Comment: Rottneffs likes that.\n44:42 Comment: These are actually the most dangerous balls,\n44:44 Comment: which SFC Cologne apart from this free kick,\n44:46 Comment: the Rottneffs headed in has to offer.\n44:48 Comment: High and wide from our own half.\n44:51 Comment: Rottneffs with his way of sprinting, working,\n44:58 Comment: Borussia Dortmund hurts here and there.\n45:3 Comment: And the Borussians will have to think about that.\n45:9 Comment: Also about the performance from minute 15 of Aubameyang\n45:12 Comment: Nothing to see except for the offside goal.\n45:15 Comment: Rottneffs outdoes him.\n45:17 Comment: And now there is still money for Aubameyang, I think, when he leaves.\n45:24 Comment: We experienced a wild game yesterday.\n45:26 Comment: Zweier can smile and has this well under control.\n45:29 Comment: But now of course you have to ask again,\n45:31 Comment: what was actually going on there.\n45:32 Comment: Aubameyang leaving.\n45:33 Comment: Exit into the cabin with a yellow card.\n45:39 Comment: And Michael Zorc now also knows what it’s all about.\n45:42 Comment: We'll try to figure it out again.\n45:46 Comment: Whether already in the Tipico half-time analysis or a little later,\n45:50 Comment: You will definitely notice it.\n45:52 Comment: See you soon.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: given the yellow card for a kick against Dominik

FC Köln.\n0:17 Comment: The direction of play has changed, the Cologne players in white now from left to right\n0:21 Comment: with this surprising 1-0 lead.\n0:24 Comment: But Dortmund was simply too harmless in the first half,\n0:27 Comment: than they could have seriously claimed to score a goal here.\n0:32 Comment: Now there is the first free kick in the second half for 1. FC Köln for the foul on Hector.\n0:57 Comment: It's a bit flat.\n1:8 Comment: That was too sloppy of Salih Öcan.\n1:12 Comment: Now there is the wrestling match, which Öcan wins.\n1:27 Comment: ners\n1:48 Comment: Dear Dagov Jaime\n1:51 Comment: In the fautano\n1:56 Comment: Naaka\n1:57 Comment: That's a good ball.\n2:8 Comment: This makes the midfield very tidy.\n2:12 Comment: Cologne have a number of players in their squad this season.\n2:16 Comment: This is not just lip service.\n2:20 Comment: They want to try to involve their own youth.\n2:24 Comment: That's a good ball.\n2:27 Comment: This makes the midfield very tidy.\n2:34 Comment: There are 7 of them in the squad.\n2:40 Comment: Who have Cologne roots.\n2:43 Comment: Beuys.\n2:49 Comment: Dembele.\n2:52 Comment: Well observed by Hector.\n2:54 Comment: Has Leipzig Thank you very much.\n2:57 Comment: You got the celestial with Esposito.\n3:0 Comment: Leipzig win by Damian Compos.\n3:3 Comment: Frisbee.\n3:5 Comment: Victory for Psicop.\n3:8 Comment: Reusler.\n3:15 Comment: ployer.\n3:18 Comment: He plays quite well.\n3:20 Comment: make forgotten.\n3:22 Comment: got really battered in the header duel.\n3:26 Comment: And he hurt his foot down there.\n3:52 Comment: Modest.\n4:13 Comment: Pass.\n4:22 Comment: Passo is one of the players that Stöger, yes, you could say, was almost a little bit enthusiastic about, saying that he is an outstanding player because he combines so many things.\n4:37 Comment: Well, that wasn't that great, but he can play a lot of positions.\n4:42 Comment: And now Modest has escaped. Modest, Modest. Past both falls and past the gate.\n4:48 Comment: Roman, now 2-0, 50th minute.\n4:52 Comment: And the people of Cologne are doing damn well here.\n4:56 Comment: Great counterattack, that was good too, but then he couldn't get the ball around properly.\n5:2 Comment: But if there is one team that has clear chances here, however few there are, then it is 1. FC Köln.\n5:22 Comment: Smelter.\n5:26 Comment: Castro.\n5:30 Comment: Weigl.\n5:34 Comment: Yes, I agree.\n5:36 Comment: Foul by Osako.\n5:40 Comment: By the way, there is information about Piszczek.

Piszczek's adductors, quote, have shut down.\n6:12 Comment: And of course we can't carry on playing like this. Martin, please.\n6:15 Comment: You don't want to experience that either. Adductors closed. Sensitive zone, I would say.\n6:21 Comment: Adductors closed.\n6:49 Comment: And there.\n6:51 Comment: This is the long-distance duel against Modest.\n6:54 Comment: There was a lot of drama involved.\n6:59 Comment: 15 goals, Aubameyang against 12 goals.\n7:3 Comment: Anthony Modest, that was also a topic before this game.\n7:5 Comment: Neither of them has really been able to draw attention to themselves yet.\n7:9 Comment: Modest even more so than Aubameyang, who hardly appears at all.\n7:21 Comment: Yes, Heinz against Dembélé.\n7:29 Comment: Now he was much, much, much too late.\n7:33 Comment: I can't tell if Dembélé is making more of it than necessary.\n7:40 Comment: Zweier deals with Heinz in his own way.\n7:45 Comment: The card goes quarter.\n7:46 Comment: So, look here again.\n7:51 Comment: Oh well.\n7:54 Comment: So, Gonzalo Castro is now out of the game.\n7:59 Comment: And Sebastian Rohde comes in.\n8:5 Comment: Also an interesting change.\n8:6 Comment: So Castro is actually someone who can make a lot out of very little.\n8:12 Comment: Even if it gets tight on the pitch.\n8:14 Comment: Have to go out.\n8:15 Comment: Well, the performance wasn't outstanding.\n8:16 Comment: And Rohde in for that.\n8:21 Comment: Let's see how it develops.\n8:25 Comment: So from a systematic point of view, nothing will change.\n8:28 Comment: So this is a position swap.\n8:32 Comment: At least Dortmund have now earned their first corner.\n8:51 Comment: And then he comes out again.\n8:52 Comment: And there are two.\n8:53 Comment: And then he comes out again.\n8:54 Comment: And here he comes out again.\n8:55 Comment: And then he comes out again.\n8:55 Comment: And here he comes out again.\n9:5 Comment: Dembele.\n9:6 Comment: He represents against Osake.\n9:9 Comment: And Dembélé has already seen money.\n9:11 Comment: This has also spread to the heights.\n9:16 Comment: This is a pretty tricky phase now.\n9:19 Comment: The fans are here.\n9:21 Comment: We already thought the corner was unjustified.\n9:23 Comment: This is not so dramatic now.\n9:25 Comment: Rosako also gets back up on her own, of course.\n9:31 Comment: But Dembélé must know that he cannot push it any further here.\n9:51 Comment: And now?\n10:16 Comment: It's a deflection.\n10:19 Comment: Oh, there was more in it for 1. FC Köln.\n10:21 Comment: Corner.\n10:23 Comment: It is striking that Borussia Dortmund allows a lot.\n10:28 Comment: That here and there the overview is missing.\n10:30 Comment: Vatra didn't even know where the ball was.\n10:31 Comment: Well, that can happen sometimes.\n10:32 Comment: But the Cologne team is not launching a permanent offensive here\n10:36 Comment: and still get good opportunities again and again.\n10:51 Comment: Ah, now Zweyer has taken a look at it at the moment.\n10:54 Comment: Hector said, wait again.\n10:56 Comment: Let's see if that can be done without a personal approach.\n10:59 Comment: But Sokratis insisted on being admitted again.\n11:4 Comment: So please, so be it.\n11:11 Comment: Good opportunity for Mergin Mavray.\n11:17 Comment: But it wasn't that easy.\n11:21 Comment: No idea if that's the way to en47.\n11:32 Comment: Inenix �g 3 to railway\n11:47 Comment: One,\n11:48 Comment: 2,\n11:51 Comment: Jinter.\n12:4 Comment: Patra with Dembélé.\n12:11 Comment: Smelter.\n12:13 Comment: Torsten Dolkowski.\n12:17 Comment: Torsten Dolkowski was no longer able to prevent this.\n12:20 Comment: 2nd corner for Borussia Dortmund.\n12:43 Comment: Torsten Dolkowski with the ball.\n12:50 Comment: I'm with him first because they both went to the ball.\n12:53 Comment: Then there was the collision.\n13:2 Comment: First of all, misunderstanding.\n13:9 Comment: Heinz has already put his foot over it.\n13:11 Comment: This is not a wish concert.\n13:12 Comment: The game is already continuing.\n13:13 Comment: Schmelzer is coming.\n13:15 Comment: ements assistants.\n13:34 Comment: Schmelzer is coming.\n13:45 Comment: That's a good ball.\n13:51 Comment: Attack on the colleague.\n13:57 Comment: I think things will continue for him too.\n14:1 Comment: Almost an hour has passed.\n14:5 Comment: Rupnevs is the man of the afternoon.\n14:9 Comment: Dortmund have in the last few minutes\n14:11 Comment: can develop a little more pressure.\n14:13 Comment: Be able to develop a little more pressure.\n14:17 Comment: It is not the densest type,\n14:19 Comment: but because they have the corner shaft\n14:23 Comment: in a kind of period of urgency.\n14:25 Comment: have triggered a kind of period of urgency.\n14:27 Comment: The whole thing doesn't seem easy.\n14:31 Comment: It was expected that Cologne\n14:35 Comment: would get a lot of work.\n14:37 Comment: now Reus is here.\n14:39 Comment: And again across.\n14:41 Comment: And Öcsan cleans the whole thing up.\n14:43 Comment: Rednappers.\n14:49 Comment: There must be money for Batra.\n14:56 Comment: Has boys red nibs.\n14:59 Comment: For Batra, of course, it is not Socrates at all.\n15:5 Comment: Sprinted away in Greece.\n15:8 Comment: For Socrates it is the fourth yellow card this season.\n15:13 Comment: Dortmund has something to defend again.\n15:16 Comment: Free kick.\n15:19 Comment: In Ingolstadt they conceded two goals from such situations.\n15:23 Comment: Another one today.\n15:28 Comment: And now one hectare.\n15:43 Comment: Free gel.\n16:4 Comment: Mois.\n16:6 Comment: Smelter.\n16:14 Comment: Ganderen istgy.\n16:18 Comment: אירות.\n16:20 Comment: Funny footballer, man.\n16:23 Comment: It is not a first.\n16:25 Comment: Except ...\n16:27 Comment: You can't force yourself.\n16:34 Comment: This is a poor attempt by\n16:37 Comment: Cathedral.\n16:38 Comment: by Dom.\n16:42 Comment: But also\n16:43 Comment: no one who really\n16:45 Comment: would be sufficient.\n16:48 Comment: If you\n16:49 Comment: considered that the turnover of the Cologne\n16:52 Comment: around 100 million\n16:54 Comment: Euro and Dortmund has the\n16:56 Comment: spent before the season,\n16:59 Comment: then it is right\n17:0 Comment: manageable, what\n17:1 Comment: that Borussia brings to the pitch here.\n17:4 Comment: Of course, the guests also have\n17:6 Comment: plenty of injury problems.\n17:7 Comment: So Sahin is not there,\n17:9 Comment: Sahin hardly plays a role in the Bundesliga anyway\n17:11 Comment: played.

Schmelzer.\n22:22 Comment: Hector.\n22:24 Comment: Still keep it about yourself.\n22:28 Comment: And back there they play man against man.\n22:45 Comment: Yes, I think that's right.\n22:48 Comment: Even though Peter Stöger, who is really very, very calm, gesticulated a little more wildly at times.\n22:56 Comment: I think Borussia Dortmund's little nudge gives the feeling that they could get three points here at home for the third time in a row.\n22:58 Comment: And that was enough to throw Ginter off balance.\n23:8 Comment: There's Ginter. Rode. In the Castro role. Very interesting statistics, by the way. Castro had 80 ball actions before he was substituted, I think he was 53.\n23:19 Comment: If you add that up, he's already in Xabi Alonso's spheres.\n23:28 Comment: But that wasn't enough to be allowed to be on the field for 90 minutes.\n23:35 Comment: Weigel in the cross of Reds.\n23:38 Comment: It helps 1. FC Köln more than Borussia Dortmund.\n23:58 Comment: Eunting from Ireland\n24:12 Comment: soit\n24:20 Comment: but\n24:22 Comment: is\n24:25 Comment: Yes\n24:28 Comment: The time group Felix Zweier not, if he had seen it that way, the Olkowski\n24:47 Comment: but looked deep into the eyes.\n24:48 Comment: Who has hardly played in the Bundesliga this season.\n24:55 Comment: Two substitutions in the cup he was allowed to play from the start today his first start\n25:1 Comment: in the league.\n25:3 Comment: Plays solidly there at the back right.\n25:5 Comment: This is self-confident, nectar against the will.\n25:25 Comment: Now he has almost taken Socrates and himself out of the game.\n25:47 Comment: But now Socrates is back.\n25:48 Comment: That is not the case.\n25:49 Comment: There's the ball.\n25:50 Comment: That is not the case.\n25:52 Comment: There's the ball.\n25:56 Comment: So quickly환 우리� debate in the\n26:9 Comment: ‐ best ‐\n26:10 Comment: Please contribute to help.\n26:17 Comment: Bring the SE 4.\n26:21 Comment: For me.\n26:23 Comment: overwhelming.\n26:25 Comment: Like the video.\n26:25 Comment: Now Tuchel has reacted and sent someone off the bench.\n26:45 Comment: To do something high.\n26:52 Comment: Also nice.\n26:55 Comment: Blissful sleep in the Christmas nest.\n26:59 Comment: Pure energy stadium.\n27:0 Comment: I hope the ticket wasn't that expensive.\n27:5 Comment: But what about Socrates?\n27:13 Comment: Of course, something always happens.\n27:25 Comment: Of course, Tuchel now has to wait and see whether he can somehow continue or\n27:29 Comment: not.\n27:30 Comment: And Schmelzer is now taking care of this free kick.\n27:36 Comment: Kessler.\n27:37 Comment: Rosako, good overview.\n27:43 Comment: If that slips through, Rosako is gone.\n27:50 Comment: Reuss.\n27:51 Comment: So.\n27:56 Comment: I think that's the twentieth foul by the 1st.\n28:0 Comment: FC Cologne.\n28:1 Comment: So I don't want to start the tedious foul discussion.\n28:5 Comment: It is simply a stylistic device against a strong team like Borussia Dortmund\n28:11 Comment: again the game, to interrupt the flow of the game.\n28:15 Comment: But the people of Cologne have something else to offer today.\n28:17 Comment: They are still at the top of their game when it comes to running.\n28:20 Comment: Well, Socrates, I don't know if this will continue for much longer.\n28:23 Comment: I am visibly in pain.\n28:24 Comment: They are totally disciplined, whether with their back four or five.\n28:28 Comment: In the course of the game, it more or less became a five-man chain with Dortmund in possession,\n28:32 Comment: because Hector slips in from behind on the left.\n28:34 Comment: And they don't leave any room for Aubameyang.\n28:37 Comment: Actually, neither does Reus.\n28:39 Comment: Here he has a Mini, a pile of space.\n28:41 Comment: And that's where Kessler has to go.\n28:42 Comment: And he's still there, doing it very confidently, without any frills.\n28:47 Comment: And that’s enough for the moment to win this 1-0.\n28:52 Comment: So.\n28:53 Comment: To claim, fifth corner.\n29:3 Comment: By the way, in the 4th minute Dortmund scored for the first time.\n29:6 Comment: That was the phase where I still said, man, this looks completely different to Frankfurt.\n29:10 Comment: There's more traction in it.\n29:11 Comment: They really want 3 points here.\n29:13 Comment: Exactly what Tuchel set out, with all his passion.\n29:16 Comment: And that shot by Reus was Borussia Dortmund’s second shot on goal against Cologne.\n29:23 Comment: So, Dembélé will now have to wait a moment to take the free kick,\n29:31 Comment: because Thomas Tuchel is changing now.\n29:33 Comment: It's becoming more offensive.\n29:34 Comment: Socrates can no longer get out.\n29:36 Comment: No, can't go on anymore.\n29:38 Comment: Have to go out.\n29:39 Comment: So done, done.\n29:40 Comment: And Adrian Ramos is coming for it.\n29:45 Comment: And there will also be a change at 1. FC Köln.\n29:49 Comment: But probably first.\n29:51 Comment: In connection.\n29:54 Comment: On the free kick, right?\n29:59 Comment: The goalscorer leaves.\n30:1 Comment: It sometimes happens that goals overshadow performances.\n30:12 Comment: Not today.\n30:13 Comment: I think that Artur Trutnefs put in a very good performance, also because of his goal.\n30:20 Comment: As a worker alongside Modeste, he really deserves these pats on the back.\n30:24 Comment: It doesn't always look elegant, but it doesn't have to.\n30:27 Comment: It just has to be effective.\n30:29 Comment: In both directions of the ball.\n30:31 Comment: And that was Artur Trutnefs.\n30:33 Comment: Free kick Dembele.\n30:37 Comment: A laughing stock for Kessler.\n30:40 Comment: I don't know.\n30:42 Comment: I don't know if he can do it that way.\n30:45 Comment: I don't know.\n30:49 Comment: I don't know how Patrick Wasserz will be laughing here.\n30:54 Comment: But I have high hopes for the round on Sky 90 tomorrow.\n30:58 Comment: Because Rainer Kallmund is there, among others.\n31:2 Comment: He always has something to say.\n31:4 Comment: Rolf Fuhrmann is also there.\n31:6 Comment: Joachim Lambi.\n31:8 Comment: A little hip swing.\n31:9 Comment: Lets Dance.\n31:10 Comment: And Markus Happel.\n31:19 Comment: So, we need to take a closer look back there.\n31:28 Comment: Reus hits Höder.\n31:38 Comment: So it looked like ribs, but what hurt him was his shoulder.\n31:49 Comment: This is not something that Jörg Schmadtke and Peter Stöger are happy about.\n31:59 Comment: That's a very sensitive area.\n32:1 Comment: Central defensive midfield.\n32:3 Comment: Höger has done a lot of cleaning up.\n32:5 Comment: It would be important for the FC that Höger can stay.\n32:12 Comment: That's a very sensitive area.\n32:14 Comment: Central defensive midfield.\n32:16 Comment: Mr Dial accepted.\n32:18 Comment: sealsa four words Что Han\n32:46 Comment: Patra.\n32:50 Comment: Weigel.\n32:59 Comment: Reus can't reach the ball.\n33:4 Comment: Dembele.\n33:12 Comment: Rosako.\n33:13 Comment: Didn't get him far enough away.\n33:16 Comment: Dembele.\n33:16 Comment: No handball.\n33:22 Comment: Even if the Dortmunders make life challenging.\n33:26 Comment: Weigel instead fouls Rosako.\n33:29 Comment: They then make the pressure they build up,\n33:31 Comment: itself is also destroyed by such actions.\n33:33 Comment: Now Cologne can breathe a sigh of relief.\n33:37 Comment: And let's take another look at the action here.\n33:39 Comment: Oh dear.\n33:41 Comment: Yep.\n33:42 Comment: So, the arm or hand has no place there.\n33:46 Comment: That looked very clear to me.\n33:48 Comment: The only question that remains is whether Mavral was on the line or even in the penalty area.\n33:54 Comment: And if it was in the penalty area or on the line, then the Cologne team were very lucky,\n33:58 Comment: that there was no penalty for this.\n34:11 Comment: Rosako.\n34:14 Comment: Oh, no.\n34:16 Comment: So, Rosako has his arm out and then falls down.\n34:22 Comment: That was my first assessment.\n34:25 Comment: And Thorsten Schiffner’s looks different.\n34:28 Comment: So, here comes the arm.\n34:29 Comment: Yes, good.\n34:29 Comment: That's where Schmelzer breaks.\n34:30 Comment: That's right.\n34:34 Comment: It's good that there is an assistant.\n34:46 Comment: And now he

Modest.\n36:34 Comment: Now he just missed the train.\n36:39 Comment: But what Dortmund does with this sequence of passes is simply far too little.\n36:46 Comment: Far too little speed.\n36:48 Comment: Today it goes from left to right, rarely vertically.\n36:53 Comment: Ramos against Kessler.\n36:56 Comment: Time out.\n36:57 Comment: Kessler.\n36:58 Comment: And eight minutes left.\n37:1

    "summary": "The match between FC Koln and Borussia Dortmund ended in a 1-1 draw, a result that reflected a fiercely contested battle on the pitch. The fixture, hosted by FC Koln, saw both teams enter with different objectives; Koln seeking to solidify their mid-table status and Dortmund aiming to close the gap on the league leaders. Let’s delve into the game, analyzing the key moments, tactical approaches, and player performances that defined this intense Bundesliga encounter.\n\nThe game commenced with both sides displaying a disciplined and passionate approach against the ball. Koln, donning their white kits, attacked from right to left in the first half. From the kickoff, it was clear that Koln intended to disrupt Dortmund's rhythm, focusing on maintaining tight defensive discipline and leveraging quick counterattacks. Despite some early possession and attempts to penetrate Koln’s backline, Dortmund found themselves up against a well-organized defense that was prepared to tackle and challenge every ball.\n\nAt the helm of Koln's defensive midfield was Weigl, flanked by Castro. However, Dortmund’s initial attacks down the right field met significant resistance. By the 12th minute, Koln had already displayed their readiness to exploit offensive opportunities, as evidenced by a near breakaway orchestrated by their attackers against Socrates’ defense.\n\nKoln had several significant chances early on. The third minute saw a golden opportunity knocked just wide, a lapse that kept the game tied. Throughout the opening 10 minutes, Koln's players, notably Modeste, actively sought to exploit gaps, though none translated into goals. Meanwhile, Dortmund's first genuine chance came in the 9th minute, but a cross intended for Reus was thwarted by Koln's defenders, maintaining the match's deadlock.\n\nOne of the highlights for Koln was Modeste’s aggressive play against Dortmund’s Socrates. The passion and energy displayed by both sides in these duels set the tone for how committed both teams were to walking away victorious.\n\nIn the 19th minute, Reus appeared to have scored for Dortmund, but the goal was disallowed due to an offside call - a correct decision that Koln supporters celebrated. This early strike, though disallowed, served as a critical reminder of Dortmund’s attacking threat, symbolized by their intense attacking pressure yet accurate defensive strategy from Koln.\n\nThe first half saw Koln’s defensive strategy functioning efficiently, leaving Dortmund to contend with possession without substantial penetration of Koln's defense. The play saw periods of domination by Dortmund with as high as 72% possession within the first twelve minutes. Yet, Koln’s reactive and flexible formation allowed them to defend stoutly while waiting for moments to counter.\n\nCome the 24th minute, the game remained goalless, but chronicling the events ongoing on the field highlighted Dortmund coach Thomas Tuchel's unease. Despite the quality spillovers on every offensive drive by his team, no significant opportunities had turned into a real threat against Koln's goal.\n\nThe breakthrough came for Koln in the first half’s latter stages. Around the 28th-minute mark, Koln broke the deadlock following a well-executed free-kick. Artyom Srupnevs seized the moment, besting Dortmund's defenders and scoring a goal that invigorated his team while casting further doubt on Dortmund's defensive prowess. This was Srupnevs' first goal of the season, a celebration for both the player and Koln’s supporters that marked what could transform into a pivotal moment in the game.\n\nDortmund, now trailing, sought to re-establish dominance. Players like Dembele and Obermeyang, who had seen limited success in terms of impactful attacks, looked to shift the game’s dynamic. Yet, the balance remained firmly with Koln whose structured yet responsive defense handled Dortmund’s attacking maneuvers adeptly.\n\nBy halftime, Dortmund had experienced a growing frustration, failing to register significant shots on target despite their dominant possession statistics. The half-time analysis was to reassess and find innovative ways to break Koln’s steadfast defense.\n\nStarting the second half, substitutions and tactical tweaks from both sides were observed. Dortmund now had their work cut out for them, needing early and impactful maneuvers. Yet, they continued to face a well-coordinated, persistent Koln defense. Early minutes in the second half, Dortmund’s efforts remained somewhat blunt, highlighted by sporadic success and negligible threats to the Koln goal.\n\nIn the 50th minute, Koln's Modeste had a brilliant chance to double their lead but failed to beat Weidenfeller, adding another dramatic attempt to the match's unfolding narrative. Dortmund’s Castro exited in the second half making way for Sebastian Rohde, an indicative move for a more dynamic midfield presence.\n\nDortmund continued efforts to breach Koln’s defense. Key moments included a corner kick around the 58th minute, which heighted their pressure in the offensive half, though converting these opportunities remained a challenge.\n\nThe game headed towards its climax with Koln maintaining their lead, trying to seal victory against a more aggressive and attacking Dortmund in the final quarter. But as the tension grew, so did Dortmund’s resolve to carve out an equalizing goal. \n\nDespite Koln's robust defensive efforts, the 90th minute turned the game around dramatically. Marco Reus managed to latch onto a cross and secure an equalizer in the dying moments of the match. The Koln defense, which had remained impenetrable for so long, finally parted, illustrating the unpredictable and enthralling nature of football. This last-minute goal was both a balm and a breach for Borussia Dortmund, whose relentless drive finally paid dividends, albeit belatedly.\n\nWith four minutes added, Dortmund pushed for a dramatic winner but found themselves continually repulsed by a Koln side determined not to let three points slip entirely from their grasp. The final whistle blew, concluding a notable encounter with every bit of grit, tactical precision, and passion emblematic of Bundesliga football.\n\nIn summary, FC Koln and Borussia Dortmund provided an enthralling spectacle capped by late drama. Koln's resolute defense and disciplined play won them many plaudits, whereas Dortmund’s persistent albeit labored offensive efforts highlighted the relentless nature of top-tier club football. The performance of key players like Reus, Modeste, Socrates, and Srupnevs will be analyzed extensively, each having moments of brilliance and breakdowns, yet collectively contributing to a memorable 1-1 draw."
