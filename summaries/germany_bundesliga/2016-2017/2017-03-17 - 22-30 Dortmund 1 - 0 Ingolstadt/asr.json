Comment: And he was also in the game.\n21:16 Comment: As far as I know, he also played the ball.\n21:17 Comment: At least that's what it looked like in the replay.\n21:20 Comment: Maybe they could

    "summary": "On a day filled with intense football action, Borussia Dortmund edged past FC Ingolstadt 1-0 in a tightly contested game at the Signal Iduna Park. The match, held before a sold-out crowd of 81,360 spectators, provided plenty of drama and highlighted both teams' strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe game started with Dortmund donning their iconic black and yellow kits. Their setup was unique, featuring Sokratis as the central figure in a three-man defense, flanked by Ginter on the left and Piszczek on the right. Schmelzer, Casto, Guerreiro, Kagawa, and Pulisic were tactically flexible, while Aubameyang spearheaded the attack.\n\nIngolstadt, meanwhile, opted for a five-man defense, surprising some with their bravery and tactical flexibility under the guidance of head coach Mike Walpurgis, whose contract could become permanent even if relegation strikes. This highly defensive yet versatile setup leaned on the prowess of key players like Suttner, Leckie, Morales, and Lescano, who were at the heart of all their dangerous moves.\n\nEarly on, both teams showcased solid efforts in midfield battles. Ingolstadt were physical and pressing high, unsettling Dortmund's rhythm. Despite Dortmund's historical home strength, where they remained unbeaten in 32 Bundesliga games, Ingolstadt was undeterred and looked to exploit any weaknesses.\n\nPulisic and Schmelzer connected well in the left-wing, attempting several incursions into the Ingolstadt box. At minute 14, after persistent play on the left, Schmelzer broke into the final third, laying a precise ball to Aubameyang. The Gabonese striker did not disappoint, moving past his marker to place the ball into the net for his 23rd Bundesliga goal of the season, giving Dortmund a 1-0 lead. The Signal Iduna Park erupted with joy, the crowd relishing the moment.\n\nIngolstadt responded vigorously and had a golden opportunity to level shortly after Dortmund’s goal. Mathew Leckie, just three meters from goal, connected with a well-placed cross but was denied heroically by Roman Bürki, whose reflexes to deflect the ball with his leg were nothing short of spectacular.\n\nThe physical duel between Sokratis and Lescano was a defining feature in the first half, both players contesting fiercely for control. Sokratis, formidable in defense, often came out on top. However, the Greek defender’s battle wound from a clash with Ginter almost took him out momentarily. Ingolstadt relentlessly chased an equalizer; their set-pieces consistently troubling Dortmund's defense. One move saw Lescano in the box, seemingly fouled by Piszczek, which many believed should have earned a penalty, yet the referee saw differently.\n\nDortmund had injury concerns as well, with multiple players needing treatment for knocks and strains. Castro and Guerreiro particularly struggled yet continued to push themselves. Ingolstadt kept knocking on the door, utilizing Kittel and Leckie to orchestrate their attacks, but Dortmund’s defense held firm.\n\nThe second half resumed with FC Ingolstadt in red, showing their intent by pressing high. Leckie found an early chance resulting from a defensive mishap between Ginter and Sokratis, yet he squandered it by not controlling his finish. The defensive frailties in Dortmund were a concern, with Ginter's overall season form coming under scrutiny again.\n\nIngolstadt’s strategy paid off in patches as they propelled into Dortmund's half with intent. High pressing and swift counterattacks evidenced their ambition to equalize. A contentious moment arose when Morales appeared to be fouled in the box, yet no penalty was awarded, causing palpable frustration among the Ingolstadt ranks. \n\nThe moves to inject fresh energy were seen as Julian Weigel and André Schürrle were substituted into the game, which Thomas Tuchel hoped would stabilize midfield and provide an attacking edge. Ingolstadt made their own changes, bringing on Pascal Gross, an asset in delivering set-pieces, adding a fresh threat.\n\nIn the latter stages of the game, Ingolstadt continued their relentless attack. Their aggressive pressing saw them control the game's tempo momentarily, but crucially lacked the final touch or stroke of luck necessary to beat Bürki. Martin’s late ventures into the box nearly paid off, his effort narrowly missing the target after a perfect set-up by Lescano.\n\nThe contest was underlined by several missed chances from Ingolstadt, which could have easily shifted the game’s trajectory. Bürki’s saving prowess kept Dortmund in the lead, his clutch performances lauded widely post-match. On the offensive side, Dortmund missed several chances to double their lead, their attacks often fizzling out due to lack of precision in the final third.\n\nAs the game neared its end, Brecherie’s foul reminded everyone of the game’s physical nature. Morale was tested late as injuries to key players, like Ginter, necessitated sensible roster management by the coaching staff.\n\nStatistically, they showed wastefulness, particularly Leckie, whose conversion rate was a glaring negative. Ingolstadt’s relentless effort in the game, peppered with duels and tactical shifts, underpinned their performance, but it was Dortmund's resilience, defensive solidity, and clinical finishing in key moments that triumphed.\n\nThis game highlighted the depth and tactical variance in Bundesliga football. Dortmund’s tenacity and Aubameyang’s finishing secured the three points they desperately sought to maintain momentum in their Champions League campaign against AS Monaco. Ingolstadt, despite the loss, earned respect for their courage and strategy that night. For the fans, especially the 81,360 spectators present, it was an electrifying evening filled with high tension, remarkable saves, and a hard-fought victory."
