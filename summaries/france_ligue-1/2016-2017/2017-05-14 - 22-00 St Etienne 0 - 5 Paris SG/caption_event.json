    "summary": "The match between St Etienne and Paris Saint-Germain (Paris SG) turned out to be a one-sided affair, as the visitors thrashed the home team 5-0 in a dominant display at Stade Geoffroy-Guichard.\n\n### First Half:\n\nThe game commenced with St Etienne kicking off at 00:00. However, within the first few seconds, the ball went out of play at 00:13, resulting in a Paris throw-in at 00:19. Paris immediately set the tone, making their intention of dominating the game clear. Within a minute, the visitors found the back of the net at 01:19, giving them an early advantage. St Etienne kicked off again at 02:07, clearly stunned by the early goal.\n\nParis continued to apply pressure, and at 05:14, they took another shot, but it went off target. St Etienne managed a clearance at 05:26, but the ball again went out of play at 05:49. Paris SG resumed from the throw-in at 05:55. They had another attempt at 06:14, but likewise, it went off target, allowing St Etienne to clear again at 06:35.\n\nThe game experienced several interruptions with balls going out of play, largely due to Paris' relentless pressing. Paris had a throw-in at 09:09, but quickly, the ball went out again. By 10:33, St Etienne found themselves offside, unable to make significant headway to counter Paris' early strike.\n\nParis was awarded a corner at 11:56, taken by Lucas Moura, but St Etienne's defense was on alert and cleared the danger. The home side had a fleeting moment of hope at 12:58 with a shot on target, which resulted in a corner at 13:26. However, once again, their attack fizzled out.\n\nSt Etienne's attempt to mount an attack was thwarted by multiple throw-ins and defenses, indicating their struggles to hook up consecutive plays. Paris continued to probe and at 15:11 they earned another corner, only for it to be cleared by St Etienne’s defense.\n\nMoments later, St Etienne committed a foul at 17:23, and the referee Amaury Delerue blew his whistle at 17:36 for what was a dangerous play by Jordan Veretout. More stoppages ensued with additional throw-ins, and St Etienne got a corner at 18:52, but Paris goalkeeper Kevin Trapp effectively read and stopped the threat.\n\nParis earned another corner at 21:24, but like previous attempts, St Etienne's defense managed to clear. The guests maintained their high tempo, showing dominance in possession and approach. At 24:36, Romain Hamouma of St Etienne was signaled for a foul, compounding the home side's frustrations. The consistent pressure saw Henri Saivet earn a yellow card at 26:16 for a rough tackle.\n\nThroughout this time, Paris operated with excellent control, regularly stalling any momentum St Etienne tried to build by maintaining possession and playing short passes. By 33:33, Marco Verratti’s shirt pull resulted in another Paris foul, granting St Etienne a free-kick.\n\nThe visitors were not to be denied; their persistence paid off. At 37:22, Lucas Moura capitalized on a loose ball inside the box, scoring to make it 2-0. This was a deserved reward for the volume of pressure mounted by Paris SG. As the half drew to a close, opportunities became scarce. Marco Verratti managed a shot on target at 42:20 and should have done better. The half concluded with Paris SG leading by two goals.\n\n### Second Half:\n\nParis kicked off the second half at 00:00, having introduced Marquinhos for Thiago Silva. Right from the start, Paris showed no sign of letting their guard down. However, offside and fouls peppered the initial moments, stifling fluid play.\n\nThe first significant action in the second half was a shot on target by Paris at 05:00. Julian Draxler miskicked, allowing St Etienne’s goalkeeper, Stephan Ruffier, to secure the ball easily. Despite generating numerous corners between the fifth and sixth minutes, neither team managed to craft a meaningful opportunity from them.\n\nAround the 10th minute, St Etienne made a substitution, bringing Benjamin Corgnet on for Henri Saivet. The change, however, did precious little to alter the course of the game. Paris continued to control proceedings, forcing St Etienne into fouls and errors.\n\nParis’ relentless onslaught bore fruit again at 26:23 when Edinson Cavani netted the rebound chance, stretching the lead to a staggering 3-0. At 30:50, another effort on target by Paris added to the home team's woes. St Etienne's defense was struggling to find ways to stem the tide of Paris attacks.\n\nLucas Moura again was at the forefront of another Paris attack and found the net at 32:45, sealing his excellent performance with another goal. This put Paris four goals ahead. Following the goal, Paris made a couple of strategic substitutions to inject fresh legs. Lucas Moura was replaced by Goncalo Guedes at 33:48, and Marco Verratti made way for Giovani Lo Celso at 33:53.\n\nSt Etienne, overwhelmed and unable to establish any rhythm, committed another foul at 39:18, resulting in a yellow card for Paris player Giovani Lo Celso. While momentum was massively in favor of the visitors, newfound shots and efforts by the home side were swiftly neutralized.\n\nParis netted another and final goal late in the game at 44:22. This concluded their hammering attack at 5-0, putting an emphatic cap on a brilliant and dominant performance.\n\nThe game ended at 45:30, marking a night where Paris SG controlled every facet of the encounter and made an emphatic statement with their resounding victory against a beleaguered St Etienne side. The result further established Paris SG’s prowess and their continued bid for silverware, demonstrating depth, tactical acumen, and superior execution throughout 90 minutes of football."
