against Barcelona in the first leg.\n2:11 Comment: Because we must not forget that he had a game on the wing.\n2:13 Comment: PSG won 4-0.\n2:16 Comment: Given the position of the wall, I think it will be for a right-handed person.\n2:18 Comment: It will be more for Cavani, open side.\n2:20 Comment: There is also Draxler who is not far away.\n2:26 Comment: Big danger for the account.\n2:32 Comment: That's it, Cavani chose the open side.\n2:35 Comment: It was too close to the penalty area to land the ball behind the wall.\n2:40 Comment: Very strong Paul too.\n2:41 Comment: Yes, but he is missing a great opportunity.\n2:43 Comment: It was already a great opportunity for Paris.\n2:48 Comment: We saw him very involved, Vincent Cavani,\n2:50 Comment: during the Parisians' warm-up in motivating his young teammates.\n2:53 Comment: Yes, more or less.\n2:54 Comment: If there was only one player...\n2:56 Comment: to get by in Barcelona, ​​I think it was more him with...\n2:59 Comment: Even

Stéphane.\n4:33 Comment: We can say it.\n4:34 Comment: A real instruction from the coach to play low against Barça.\n4:36 Comment: Contrary to what we have read right and left.\n4:38 Comment: This is how the Parisians had prepared.\n4:41 Comment: Afterwards, we will resume the debate.\n4:43 Comment: But we can play low with aggression.\n4:45 Comment: We can play low while being able to get the ball out and pass.\n4:48 Comment: This is especially what caused the problem for PSG.\n4:50 Comment: But the evening match, he was in Lorient.\n4:52 Comment: We won't do the Barcelona one again

He must be concentrated from the first minutes.\n6:24 Comment: Barbel.\n6:28 Comment: Well taken by Kevin Trapp, this ball.\n6:36 Comment: The German goalkeeper who also had a nightmarish evening, obviously.\n6:40 Comment: We will say that he was overwhelmed by the opportunities conceded by PSG, Paul.\n6:44 Comment: He should have had a better match.\n6:47 Comment: A better match than that in these meetings.\n6:50 Comment: Teams like PSG need a great goalkeeper.\n6:57 Comment: Unai Emery's tense face.\n6:58 Comment: His field reconnaissance was a rather special moment.\n7:2 Comment: He is used to going out on the lawn alone and walking on the lawn alone.\n7:7 Comment: But usually rather relaxed, rather smiling.\n7:9 Comment: There he was, jaw clenched, talking to himself.\n7:12 Comment: He covered an incredible number of meters on this lawn in Lorient.\n7:17 Comment: And you mentioned Stéphane, the Spanish coach was extremely tense all day, particularly at the Hôtel des Parisiens.\n7:24 Comment: Thiago Silva with his friend Marquinhos.\n7:27 Comment: Miller.\n7:41 Comment: It's always the same person who offers to make calls.\n7:44 Comment: It's Dugout.\n7:45

focused.\n8:21 Comment: Paul Kies talks a lot among themselves.\n8:26 Comment: They remain on 4 consecutive defeats linked to what had already happened to them during the first 4 days of the championship.\n8:34 Comment: Thomas Meunier.\n8:37 Comment: Support from Braxler, Di Maria and Corner.\n8:41 Comment: Conceded by FC Lorient.\n8:43 Comment: This will be the first corner of the match for the Parisians.\n8:45 Comment: This is obviously a very important phase of the game because Orient concede a lot of goals from corners.\n8:49 Comment: And Paris is the strongest team in the exercise.\n8:54 Comment: It's a very, very good move on the Parisian side with a very quick exchange of passes in one touch.\n8:59 Comment: Come on, it's the Orient.\n9:11 Comment: Come on, DiMaria.\n9:13 Comment: It is well defended by the Orient.\n9:28 Comment: And new to Corner.\n9:29 Comment: Conceded by Le Goff.\n9:31 Comment: He could have avoided it.\n9:32 Comment: He should have hit Di Maria even if it meant clearing.\n9:41 Comment: El Kulko.\n9:42 Comment: The center of El Kulko.\n9:44 Comment: It's knocked back by Jano's head.\n9:47 Comment: And there is an offside position.\n9:50 Comment: From Martinez on this vein.\n9:52 Comment: I can talk about refocusing by Thiago Silva.\n9:56 Comment: It's one of the handkerchiefs that hasn't been refilled.\n10:0 Comment: There is great success here.\n10:2 Comment: As much the Orient has often made big hits in the park.\n10:5 Comment: On the other hand, here in Lorient, PSG have only lost twice in 16 visits.\n10:10 Comment: The mosquito net has not been refilled.\n10:12 Comment: The visitor parking lot is full.\n10:14 Comment: 750 PSG supporters made the trip.\n10:17 Comment: We see them thanks to Zolta Kamzalem and her troupe.\n10:22 Comment: We cannot say that the welcome given to Parisians was lenient.\n10:26 Comment: At all, there were a few words there.\n10:28 Comment: But overall, it's a quiet crowd here.\n10:31 Comment: I don't think we celebrated Barcelona's victory until the end of the night in Lorient.\n10:35 Comment: Even if...\n10:38 Comment: It's a bit like that.\n10:40 Comment: The former Lorient coach was a great admirer of Barcelona's game.\n10:45 Comment: Certainly. And then, you are in the chambered position. You are last.\n10:47 Comment: Yes, it's true.\n10:48 Comment: We saw towns, when we took this, which were rooms there.\n10:51 Comment: A little restraint, though.\n10:52 Comment: You saw that Real fans made a petition against the referee of Barcelona, ​​​​PSG.\n10:58 Comment: It goes a long way.\n10:59 Comment: Yes, there were already 35,000 signatures and played in the afternoon.\n11:4 Comment: And the afternoon training, for those who took advantage of this beautiful sunny day,\n11:9 Comment: notably in Paris, the information this afternoon was that Barça, in La Liga, was beaten in La Coruna.\n11:14 Comment: A difficult moment of celebration for the people of Barcelona.\n11:16 Comment: Neymar's Primer is perhaps celebrating the success against Paris a little too much, anyway.\n11:23 Comment: Draxler with Di Maria.\n11:26 Comment: The ball could be mud kicked.\n11:28 Comment: Well anticipated on the part of Webernès.\n11:31 Comment: Webernès again.\n11:33 Comment: Yes !\n11:42 Comment: And then there is the Orient match.\n11:44 Comment: What do you think of this start to the Parisians' match, Paul Le Gouen?\n11:46 Comment: We feel they are a little traumatized.\n11:48 Comment: They have difficulty establishing rhythm, but this is also linked to the position of the Lorientais,\n11:52 Comment: which group together well, which leave little space.\n11:54 Comment: I find that the Orient, for the moment, is doing it well.\n11:56 Comment: It's okay, Draxler.\n11:57 Comment: It is Adrien Rabiot who will be taken by Wacassos.\n12:0 Comment: So, important information about Adrien Rabiot.\n12:2 Comment: He played this match in Barcelona after a lung infection which kept him away from the field for a week.\n12:3 Comment: after a lung infection which kept him away from the field for a week.\n12:7 Comment: This is what can also partly explain this incredibly average match on his part.\n12:11 Comment: For the most part, it's a real handicap to be deprived of training for 8 days.\n12:16 Comment: He had only trained once before the finish.\n12:18 Comment: Yes, indeed, it is very penalizing.\n12:20 Comment: And we know how essential he is in the Parisian system at the moment.\n12:24 Comment: For quite a while now.\n12:26 Comment: King Cassou.\n12:28 Comment: The debate is whether it was necessary to play the move?\n12:31 Comment: Philippe Otho.\n12:35 Comment: Things go quickly with Logov. Philippe Otho who is re-aligning himself.\n12:38 Comment: He goes through Arnaud de Wemba.\n12:40 Comment: He punctures this balloon.\n12:42 Comment: Javier Pastore.\n12:44 Comment: This ball is good for Di Maria. It offers a possibility of counterattack to the Parisians.\n12:48 Comment: It's a 3 on 3 with Di Maria, Draxler and Cavalli.\n12:52 Comment: And what a return from King Cassou.\n12:53 Comment: This return was well done.\n12:55 Comment: Oh, Benjamin Bucanjo got his pencils mixed up there.\n12:59 Comment: It was the first counter opportunity for the Parisian side.\n13:1 Comment: So far they are dealing with a very united Lorient team.\n13:4 Comment: They must take constructed actions.\n13:6 Comment: There it was a first head to head between Di Maria and Siani.\n13:17 Comment: We're going to do something stupid by Di Maria.\n13:19 Comment: They have difficulty. For the moment it's 10 against 10.\n13:22 Comment: When it comes to getting around a well grouped defense.\n13:25 Comment: There he had the possibility of accelerating.\n13:27 Comment: But he pushes his ball too far.\n13:29 Comment: And King Cassou allows it.\n13:31 Comment: He manages to recover the ball.\n13:49 Comment: Yvigne Kurzawa.\n13:52 Comment: Draxler.\n13:53 Comment: Kurzawa who resists Jeannot's pressing.\n13:56 Comment: Good pressing behind Barbeau.\n13:58 Comment: Barbeau who will shift Bucanjo.\n14:1 Comment: With the arrival of Philippe Poitot.\n14:3 Comment: It will be a bit long.\n14:4 Comment: What an opportunity in Lorienté.\n14:6 Comment: Lorienté who comes out 10 with the pocket player who is Philippe Poitot.\n14:10 Comment: Who will get a corner.\n14:11 Comment: Because the Bucanjo center was good.\n14:13 Comment: It was at the second Poitot.\n14:15 Comment: But Philippe Poitot was a little too eccentric.\n14:17 Comment: It was really very interesting on the Lorient side.\n14:20 Comment: It started with a good recovery of the ball from Morera.\n14:23 Comment: Let's go.\n14:33 Comment: There is nothing to see on the Lorienté side with the header of the match 8 days ago against OM.\n14:36 Comment: Very fortunately for them.\n14:46 Comment: Barbeau at the corner.\n14:50 Comment: It was Cavani it seems who took this ball very high.\n14:52 Comment: I think it's Marquinhos Stéphane.\n14:53 Comment: We'll check.\n14:54 Comment: Thanks Paul.\n15:0 Comment: It’s a center with Mikanjo coveting it.\n15:3 Comment: And an attempt behind Michael Ciani, the captain.\n15:15 Comment: It's for Zawa.\n15:17 Comment: It was the second.\n15:21 Comment: Good possibility for Michael Ciani returning to Lorient after having traveled quite a bit.\n15:27 Comment: Bordeaux, Italy, Spain.\n15:30 Comment: Even in this traffic, far from the opposing goal, the Parisians must put in more rhythm.\n15:36 Comment: They tend to be a little slow.\n15:40 Comment: With Kurzawa.\n15:43 Comment: Kurzawa facing Benjamin Mikanjo who occupies a right-wing position in Lorient.\n15:47 Comment: He who is number 9.\n15:48 Comment: Also on occasion.\n15:49 Comment: And the ball in play from Cavani in place of Rabia Pastorel.\n16:0 Comment: We will revisit this often.\n16:1 Comment: Pastorel searches in Cavani.\n16:3 Comment: There he is slightly offside.\n16:5 Comment: But remember in Marseille, he wasn't.\n16:7 Comment: In any case it had not been reported.\n16:8 Comment: And this relationship risks being found during the match.\n16:13 Comment: ...\n16:26 Comment: The one-back.\n16:27 Comment: He missed it.\n16:28 Comment: The ball recovered by a better act.\n16:30 Comment: The one-back that comes back.\n16:31 Comment: You have to try to scratch it.\n16:32 Comment: It is Pastorel who emerges from this duel with a heart.\n16:36 Comment: DiMaria.\n16:39 Comment: Miller.\n16:45 Comment: The Arri who always knew how to react well.\n16:47 Comment: Paul, after setbacks.\n16:48 Comment: Finally routs, defeats.\n16:49 Comment: Because there has never been a rout yet.\n16:50 Comment: But after Champions League eliminations.\n16:52 Comment: We remember last year their decisive victory at the Malherbe stadium in Caen.\n16:57 Comment: You are right.\n16:58 Comment: But this defeat is precisely a rout.\n17:1 Comment: And that's why it's very different.\n17:3 Comment: ...\n17:15 Comment: Obviously the first time that PSG has played with this environment.\n17:17 Comment: The historical environment of PSG.\n17:19 Comment: Thiago Motta, Verratti, Matuidi.\n17:21 Comment: Is absent.\n17:22 Comment: ...\n17:30 Comment: Verratti suspended.\n17:31 Comment: For the others, only Motta is really injured.\n17:33 Comment: ...\n17:37 Comment: Philippe Otto.\n17:39 Comment: Try to set the pace.\n17:41 Comment: ...\n17:45 Comment: Laurent Paganelli's friend.\n17:47 Comment: DiMaria.\n17:48 Comment: This ball is good for Draxler.\n17:50 Comment: Draxler in one touch perhaps.\n17:51 Comment: No, he decided to control her.\n17:53 Comment: He finally takes her away.\n17:54 Comment: There was the opening at one point to attempt the strike.\n17:56 Comment: And with the quality of his foot, we could have imagined it.\n17:58 Comment: ...\n18:0 Comment: Yes, but Assoumi, Moreira's very good defense.\n18:2 Comment: ...\n18:5 Comment: If we watch the action again, we will see that Moreira accompanies Draxler well on the side.\n18:10 Comment: Without giving him the opportunity to get on his right foot.\n18:12 Comment: It's really very, very well defended.\n18:14 Comment: ...\n18:17 Comment: There you go, he keeps the right position all the time, all the time.\n18:19 Comment: He blocks the shot.\n18:20 Comment: And he blocks the inside dribble too.\n18:22 Comment: ...\n18:24 Comment: We can clearly see the Rennes player, Steven Moreira.\n18:28 Comment: Draxler.\n18:31 Comment: He passes Bocasso.\n18:32 Comment: Pastor.\n18:33 Comment: We are being touched towards Di Maria.\n18:35 Comment: Return of Le Goff.\n18:36 Comment: The recovery is very complicated.\n18:38 Comment: But his partner in difficulty was recovered very high by Pastore.\n18:42 Comment: Ravière Pastore who is going to provoke Moreira.\n18:44 Comment: And who is arrested by Bucanjo.\n18:46 Comment: It's amazing to see Bucanjo in this role, Paul.\n18:48 Comment: He plays right midfielder.\n18:50 Comment: He has some defensive efforts to make.\n18:52 Comment: He must come and protect Moreira.\n18:53 Comment: We know that against Kurzawa, Draxler, we have to defend, of course.\n18:58 Comment: So this is a bit of an unusual role for Bucanjo.\n19:0 Comment: He has already been employed in this role.\n19:4 Comment: But despite everything, he most often played in the center.\n19:6 Comment: ...\n19:17 Comment: Péberness coming out.\n19:18 Comment: Péberness with Bucanjo.\n19:20 Comment: Bucanjo for Péberness who sees his case through to the end.\n19:22 Comment: And Thiago Silva puts the ball.\n19:24 Comment: In touch.\n19:27 Comment: The highly contested captain of Paris Saint-Germain.\n19:29 Comment: They are still not very calm behind.\n19:37 Comment: Ball released by Pastore on Christopher Nkunku.\n19:41 Comment: His fifth match as a starter in Ligue 1.\n19:44 Comment: The last time was during the 0-0 against Toulouse.\n19:47 Comment: After the match he tries to augur a spring.\n19:52 Comment: And he had a brilliant time.\n19:54 Comment: Miller.\n19:56 Comment: DiMaria.\n19:58 Comment: ...\n20:4 Comment: 57 goals conceded by Lorient this season.\n20:7 Comment: That's 8 goals per match.\n20:10 Comment: ...\n20:15 Comment: Well done Arnold Wemba who lights up the oriented play with this pass to Bucanjo.\n20:19 Comment: Bucanjo towards Marvaux.\n20:21 Comment: Who missed his chest control.\n20:23 Comment: He is countered by a radio player who is more leggy than in Barcelona.\n20:26 Comment: It's already visible.\n20:28 Comment: He has no solution with Pastore.\n20:35 Comment: Also not Nkunku.\n20:40 Comment: The more the match progresses, the better off the Parisians should be.\n20:45 Comment: Yes, but despite everything, he must not tense up in search of a solution.\n20:51 Comment: Pastore was in Kurzawa's race.\n20:55 Comment: Ooh!\n20:56 Comment: Kurzawa scared us.\n20:58 Comment: Nothing serious, just a slip.\n21:0 Comment: ...\n21:12 Comment: The Oriented who prefers to seek clearance and a long game.\n21:16 Comment: They prefer to avoid building from their base.\n21:19 Comment: ...\n21:22 Comment: So this leads to loss of balls but it avoids also losing balls in your camp.\n21:30 Comment: ...\n21:40 Comment: Arquinhos Thiago Silva.\n21:44 Comment: It is postponed for a few seconds perhaps.\n21:46 Comment: More.\n21:47 Comment: Miller.\n21:48 Comment: ...\n21:52 Comment: But Berdymarja, the balloon's pero.\n21:53 Comment: Berdymarja will control him, no, Célodolf.\n21:55 Comment: ...\n21:59 Comment: With Philippotaud pursued by Meunier.\n22:0 Comment: ...\n22:3 Comment: Maybe Marvaux.\n22:4 Comment: ...\n22:6 Comment: Marvaux who is a wonderful player, who is in very good shape at the moment in the Orient\n22:7 Comment: and who has a career unfortunately cut short by injuries.\n22:8 Comment: ...\n22:14 Comment: And when he is physically fit, he wants to delight the crowds.\n22:15 Comment: ...\n22:16 Comment: the good Parisian, the smile of Atem Ben Arfa\n22:19 Comment: more closed face\n22:20 Comment: for Guedes, the Portuguese\n22:22 Comment: for Krikoviak\n22:23 Comment: closed for Krikoviak perhaps because he hoped\n22:32 Comment: a little popularization\n22:33 Comment: it was the choice to make for Emery\n22:36 Comment: and fault of Pébernes\n22:38 Comment: on N'Goukou\n22:39 Comment: which is very present, very lively\n22:42 Comment: very active and getting the right shot from the front\n22:44 Comment: very available\n22:45 Comment: it offers many solutions to its partners\n22:48 Comment: and a new very very avoidable fault\n22:50 Comment: side of the Orient\n22:51 Comment: Pébernes which comes to impact while the opponent\n22:54 Comment: goes towards the corner post\n22:57 Comment: eccentric\n22:58 Comment: there is no need to make this mistake\n23:0 Comment: we must support as Monvera did earlier\n23:2 Comment: it’s next to the Orient\n23:11 Comment: they didn't think of a bigger opportunity\n23:13 Comment: but leaving it on a thread\n23:14 Comment: Nevertheless\n23:14 Comment: they took 5-0 at the park\n23:17 Comment: and it was a match which already took place in a special context\n23:20 Comment: for PSG\n23:21 Comment: since it was after the defeat\n23:22 Comment: against Guingamp\n23:23 Comment: it's Di Maria who will hit this free kick\n23:31 Comment: Gavanis presents\n23:36 Comment: of the head\n23:38 Comment: will it be?\n23:39 Comment: it will be corner\n23:40 Comment: yes, thank you Olivier\n23:44 Comment: leaving it to apply in any case on defensive hacking shots\n23:47 Comment: it was the Orient for the moment\n23:48 Comment: Maria once again Pébernes\n23:57 Comment: Pastore, how good is this ball towards Thiago Silva\n24:1 Comment: and the flight of Benjamin Lecomte\n24:3 Comment: which perhaps removes this goal from\n24:6 Comment: Alévin Kurzaba\n24:7 Comment: what Lecomte stop\n24:9 Comment: very very nice save from Lecomte\n24:10 Comment: on this discount from Thiago Silva\n24:12 Comment: who had benefited from an exceptional ball\n24:14 Comment: by Pastore\n24:15 Comment: behind the defense\n24:16 Comment: perfectly dosed\n24:17 Comment: it is not enough to defend well\n24:20 Comment: on hacking moves\n24:21 Comment: you still have to be present\n24:22 Comment: on return balloons\n24:24 Comment: she is out\n24:25 Comment: it affects us the Orient\n24:28 Comment: what judgment of Lecomte on this action\n24:31 Comment: we see the delivery of Thiago Silva\n24:32 Comment: and Lecomte who remains firmly on his feet\n24:34 Comment: Lorient which will need a good Lecomte\n24:38 Comment: to get out of it\n24:40 Comment: of a better Lecomte\n24:42 Comment: that in recent weeks\n24:44 Comment: there were also sure values ​​from the club\n24:47 Comment: who is having a complicated season\n24:48 Comment: Larvals served by Jeannot\n24:53 Comment: Philippe Poteau\n24:54 Comment: The Goff who commits immediately\n24:56 Comment: The Oriented who doesn't hesitate to go\n24:58 Comment: the center of Le Goff\n25:2 Comment: behind Kevin Trapp's goals\n25:4 Comment: we see clearly\n25:12 Comment: that the Oriented put themselves back in their place\n25:14 Comment: they admit Parisian possession\n25:16 Comment: and they start to act\n25:18 Comment: at midfield level\n25:20 Comment: being very grouped together\n25:22 Comment: we see it in this situation\n25:24 Comment: without being too too low at the start either\n25:26 Comment: in any case Paul actions\n25:28 Comment: not too low but then you have to check the depth\n25:30 Comment: because we know that Cavani will\n25:32 Comment: so Cavani in particular will try to take advantage\n25:34 Comment: of this free space behind the defense\n25:36 Comment: you see the waste you see in the game\n25:38 Comment: The Oriented since the start of the match\n25:40 Comment: it was that of PSG in Barcelona on Wednesday\n25:42 Comment: Exactly\n25:43 Comment: so Cavani will try to take advantage of this free space behind the defense\n25:44 Comment: because he is super big\n25:46 Comment: for 130 meters\n25:52 Comment: but he is still too strong\n25:54 Comment: microbiosis\n25:56 Comment: ihrer twee\n26:4 Comment: it must first be\n26:6 Comment: Abdel положer\n26:8 Comment: to counter 給 wärmer\n26:10 Comment: for Marian tools\n26:12 Comment: It can be seen that bear is Будor\n26:14 Comment: 확신\n26:14 Comment: Maxler, Maxler who eliminated Mukonjo who nevertheless clings to Sébasque.\n26:20 Comment: Meunier, ball lost by Thomas Meunier.\n26:22 Comment: Recovery of Philippe Otto, there is a counter-possible to direct him with Mukonjo.\n26:27 Comment: Mukonjo who is looking for a solution, she arrives with Philippe Otto.\n26:31 Comment: So obviously Waris is not there this evening and that is a real lack in the game to guide him.\n26:35 Comment: Look at the position of Cavani, right back on this action, exceptional.\n26:39 Comment: He felt there was danger, he ended up at right back in this situation.\n26:45 Comment: And I find that it reflects a state of mind.\n26:48 Comment: It’s reminiscent of his famous comeback against Nancy.\n26:50 Comment: Absolutely, and he was eliminated at the end of two strikes.\n26:54 Comment: But despite everything he was there.\n26:55 Comment: Perhaps this return prevented Nancy 1 from scoring, perhaps.\n26:59 Comment: He is the only one in Barcelona who came out heavy.\n27:3 Comment: I really promise you that his attitude to the sports exchange this evening from Parisians to the Orient,\n27:8 Comment: and especially...\n27:9 Comment: When he caught Levin Kurzawa between four eyes, it was worth a look.\n27:15 Comment: Meunier, what a good ball from Meunier for Draxler.\n27:17 Comment: Draxler, Draxler's heel, they're coming!\n27:19 Comment: The Parisians are coming strong!\n27:21 Comment: And still counting!\n27:25 Comment: Who precisely opposes Cavani.\n27:28 Comment: And this is a very, very good movement.\n27:29 Comment: Draxler who takes possession of the ball, he feels that his partners are coming forward.\n27:33 Comment: And there Cavani must be calmer, he must sting, he must feel that the goalkeeper is going to go to the ground.\n27:37 Comment: He has just made an 80 meter effort.\n27:39 Comment: You're right, it may be related, it's certainly related, but this player offers many more advantages than disadvantages.\n27:49 Comment: We have to forgive him a lot for the efforts he obviously makes on the pitch.\n27:53 Comment: He is still at 38 goals since the start of the season by the way.\n27:57 Comment: To goal !\n27:58 Comment: And There you go ! Maybe this 39th from Edinson Cavani.\n28:0 Comment: Yes, it was he who cut the ball from André El-Nimaria's corner.\n28:5 Comment: Edinson Cavani's 39th goal.\n28:7 Comment: It's simply...\n28:9 Comment: His single-season career high.\n28:12 Comment: Does he touch this ball?\n28:14 Comment: He celebrates it in a rather mixed way.\n28:17 Comment: Is it probably in relation to Wednesday, Paul?\n28:20 Comment: I think he's still the scorer.\n28:23 Comment: In any case, it's him who puts a good word in the heart of PSG supporters.\n28:27 Comment: He may be touching it lightly.\n28:29 Comment: Bernard Cazenis' reaction, it's not possible to concede a goal like that.\n28:32 Comment: I think it's the defender who hits.\n28:35 Comment: It also seems to me, frankly, from the edge of the lawn.\n28:38 Comment: And Arnold Wemba who is glued to the post.\n28:41 Comment: That's impossible, we can't be so passive.\n28:46 Comment: And he will congratulate Dimaria.\n28:47 Comment: So the goal will undoubtedly be awarded to André El-Nimaria and not to Edinson Cavani.\n28:54 Comment: We're going to correct our synth.\n29:0 Comment: You have to review it once or twice before correcting it.\n29:2 Comment: Let's take the time.\n29:3 Comment: We will try to find the viewing angles.\n29:6 Comment: Wemba touches it or not?\n29:7 Comment: No.\n29:8 Comment: The account.\n29:10 Comment: Wemba maybe it touches.\n29:13 Comment: Arnold Wemba.\n29:15 Comment: It's hard to orient him.\n29:17 Comment: Paul obviously to have succeeded in this first half hour and to be caught like that if not really on a harmless gesture but almost.\n29:27 Comment: He got away with two saves from Lecomte on real chances for PSG.\n29:31 Comment: Just before this corner.\n29:38 Comment: How was this goal from Dimaria or Cavani received on the Parisian bench by Olivier?\n29:44 Comment: Pretty much the same as Cavani's reaction.\n29:49 Comment: That is to say, a lot of calm.\n29:54 Comment: A little joy but nothing more.\n29:57 Comment: They are still very marked Stéphane.\n29:59 Comment: We were told this throughout the pre-match.\n30:1 Comment: They are obviously very very marked.\n30:2 Comment: They will be there for a long time.\n30:3 Comment: Yes.\n30:5 Comment: And then they are well aware that they are playing against the last of Stéphane's championship.\n30:7 Comment: The Ligue 1 championship.\n30:9 Comment: And beating Lorient would obviously not be an achievement.\n30:20 Comment: Siani with Péperness.\n30:23 Comment: Same who did the hardest part.\n30:24 Comment: We know the strength of the Parisians when they lead the score.\n30:29 Comment: When they lead 1-0 in a match.\n30:32 Comment: They did not concede in this situation.\n30:35 Comment: Two draws at home against Saint-Etienne.\n30:38 Comment: And Monaco.\n30:38 Comment: Otherwise they have won all 17 of our times.\n30:41 Comment: Then recovered by Filippotto.\n30:43 Comment: Filippotto.\n30:46 Comment: Facing Rabiot.\n30:47 Comment: He returned.\n30:49 Comment: Marvaux.\n30:49 Comment: Marvaux's shot is captured by Kevin Trapp.\n30:53 Comment: He probably couldn't place it as he would have liked.\n30:55 Comment: Here the Marvaux.\n30:55 Comment: What a beautiful reaction from the Orient.\n30:57 Comment: On this good pass from Filippotto for Marvaux who makes a good technical sequence.\n31:0 Comment: Who gets into a striking position.\n31:2 Comment: He could perhaps have tried a right foot strike.\n31:4 Comment: Let's go.\n31:6 Comment: A pair of balls.\n31:7 Comment: Almost unacceptable from Rabiot.\n31:9 Comment: Which shows him concentration.\n31:12 Comment: Because Lorient is just waiting for that.\n31:14 Comment: These are recoveries 30-35 meters from the opposing goal.\n31:19 Comment: And Filippotto bothers them a lot on the left every time.\n31:22 Comment: Come on Valerie.\n31:25 Comment: Well done Rob.\n31:28 Comment: Come on.\n32:7 Comment: Maybe I was when he filmed there.\n32:15 Comment: He is disconcerted to see that he is playing with snow cleats on a pitch that is still...\n32:20 Comment: Look at Paul, since you say that, look at Thiago Silva, he will show us Jean-Jacques Hamsalem perhaps.\n32:23 Comment: He changes shoes too.\n32:25 Comment: I hadn't seen it, but it seems obvious to me to play live.\n32:29 Comment: I think Thiago Silva was playing in stride.\n32:31 Comment: Exactly.\n32:32 Comment: When screwed, it changes from screwed to unscrewed.\n32:34 Comment: So we try to see.\n32:35 Comment: Yes, it was unscrewed, he had already unscrewed.\n32:38 Comment: I think that the first contact was already a Lorienté.\n32:46 Comment: Yes.\n32:47 Comment: Jeannot perhaps touches it?\n32:48 Comment: Jeannot then Lecomte, I think.\n32:51 Comment: It's definitely not Cavani.\n32:52 Comment: It's a CSC then.\n32:55 Comment: It's a CSC.\n32:58 Comment: If it's the CSC, it's Jeannot.\n33:5 Comment: Di Maria got up, that's the good news.\n33:15 Comment: I was surprised to see Di Maria playing in full force because I know he has a little more in the corner this morning.\n33:23 Comment: But I tell myself that...\n33:24 Comment: You know a little about the region, Paul.\n33:26 Comment: It's not a little more, it was falling halberds.\n33:29 Comment: He is playing.\n33:35 Comment: The Goff.\n33:37 Comment: That ball came out, didn't it?\n33:39 Comment: No no.\n33:39 Comment: It's not out, it's playing.\n33:41 Comment: Larvals.\n33:43 Comment: Coteau, Le Goff.\n33:45 Comment: Le Goff Center.\n33:49 Comment: Arnold Wemba.\n33:51 Comment: It's strong how he...\n33:52 Comment: It was undoubtedly Wemba's fault.\n33:54 Comment: There was a real mistake, yes.\n33:56 Comment: Oh yes ?\n33:56 Comment: Under the eyes of Mr. Chaprelle.\n34:0 Comment: Pastor.\n34:1 Comment: Well, this ball from Pastore towards Draxler is good.\n34:3 Comment: Anticipation of Lecomte.\n34:4 Comment: With Cal.\n34:5 Comment: He returned the ball.\n34:6 Comment: With Gougou.\n34:7 Comment: Is he going to attempt a strike at La Depaille?\n34:9 Comment: No.\n34:11 Comment: Well, Memphis style, let's say.\n34:13 Comment: Pardon.\n34:15 Comment: DiMaria.\n34:18 Comment: Magnier.\n34:20 Comment: Gougou.\n34:23 Comment: But it was definitely doable to try it.\n34:26 Comment: It is...\n34:27 Comment: Too bad he didn't see that...\n34:29 Comment: Oh yes, he must have used additional techniques.\n34:31 Comment: What did he do with Gougou?\n34:35 Comment: The proof there.\n34:39 Comment: Small ball for André Aldimaria.\n34:44 Comment: It was released by Wacaso.\n34:46 Comment: That way, they won't make it.\n34:47 Comment: If they throw balloons at the central Parisian hinge,\n34:51 Comment: They will lose the ball very quickly.\n34:52 Comment: And it will come back, constantly come back to the defense.\n35:4 Comment: So there will have been no...\n35:5 Comment: 39th goal for Edinson Cavani\n35:7 Comment: who will still have to wait a little longer to beat his career record.\n35:10 Comment: 38 goals with Napoli in 2013.\n35:12 Comment: But it will not be long.\n35:13 Comment: Given the pace at which he scores Ruguayen's goals\n35:16 Comment: which is there on the left side.\n35:20 Comment: With the outcome.\n35:21 Comment: To be checked.\n35:22 Comment: What type of shoes does he play with?\n35:25 Comment: Come on.\n35:29 Comment: Cavani can play too.\n35:31 Comment: How are you ?\n35:33 Comment: And it will be good.\n35:34 Comment: An own goal for Jérémy Jano.\n35:37 Comment: So.\n35:37 Comment: For Jeremy.\n35:37 Comment: For Benjamin Jano, sorry.\n35:40 Comment: The Oriented Attacker\n35:41 Comment: who would undoubtedly have preferred to enter his name in the correct beginner column.\n35:44 Comment: Rabiot.\n35:49 Comment: Braxler.\n35:50 Comment: Stopped by Moreira.\n36:4 Comment: And Bernez.\n36:14 Comment: Mukonjo fought.\n36:15 Comment: Jano.\n36:17 Comment: Mukonjo.\n36:19 Comment: Margot.\n36:19 Comment: Yes, there are quality players in the Orient.\n36:21 Comment: Margot with Wanba.\n36:22 Comment: It's behind his back.\n36:23 Comment: And back.\n36:25 Comment: Full of relevance from Di Maria.\n36:26 Comment: Concerned with getting the ball back for now.\n36:28 Comment: Andre Di Maria.\n36:31 Comment: Pastor.\n36:34 Comment: Be careful, Pébernes.\n36:39 Comment: DiMaria.\n36:40 Comment: Siani.\n36:41 Comment: Escaping balloon.\n36:42 Comment: Recovery of Pastore.\n36:43 Comment: Pastor.\n36:45 Comment: No.\n36:47 Comment: The Oriented who have a knack for embarrassing themselves all the same.\n36:50 Comment: They make mistakes that expose the collective a lot.\n36:55 Comment: There, it was Pébernes.\n36:56 Comment: And that gives Pastore the opportunity to hit the defense.\n37:4 Comment: Once again.\n37:5 Comment: What's hard is that they put themselves in difficulty.\n37:8 Comment: Yes, it is very, very limited.\n37:9 Comment: Jano.\n37:11 Comment: Jano with Marbot on the right side.\n37:13 Comment: Marbot.\n37:14 Comment: Marbot versus Draxler.\n37:16 Comment: Wakaso.\n37:19 Comment: The winner Wakaso recruited this winter

reasons.\n44:59 Comment: Look, there's still...\n\nSecond Half:\n0:30 Comment: or Noël Lebret, if that happened to the French football team one day, fingers crossed.\n0:37 Comment: Hey, Stéphane,

again.\n1:35 Comment: Does it happen to the naive?\n1:37 Comment: They still conceded their 14th goal to Lorientés this evening from a corner. It’s huge.\n1:44 Comment: One of Bernard Cazeny's main missions when he was appointed was precisely to resolve Lorient's defensive problems.\n1:54 Comment: His team plays well, they always play well, but on the other hand they concede even more goals.\n2:14 Comment: What a good ball from Thiago Silva.\n2:16 Comment: With Kurzawa handing it over to Cavani, it brings back good memories.\n2:29 Comment: Thiago Silva served by Marquinhos.\n2:34 Comment: Why is Paul moving? Why is Thiago Silva and Marquinhos moving from right to left?\n2:40 Comment: Because both are comfortable on all sides in my opinion. There is no other explanation than that.\n2:45 Comment: He’s still not sure about going out.\n2:47 Comment: Kurzawa, Kurzawa the center, Kurzawa the center towards Christopher Nkunku.\n3:3 Comment: He

a lot of strikes.\n6:55 Comment: Which turn a little.\n6:57 Comment: But obviously a goalkeeper at that level should not be surprised by that.\n7:1 Comment:  Of course.\n7:2 Comment: But I think he has it in his head that Nkunku is going to send a cross to the far post.\n7:5 Comment: But he chooses to strike.\n7:6 Comment: And he is not in a good position to intervene Lecomte.\n7:10 Comment: And there Unai Emery was there.\n7:12 Comment: And there he celebrates it fully because he knows that it's 2-0.\n7:16 Comment: He must not be able to take care of his sin.\n7:19 Comment: Even if we

anticipation.\n9:42 Comment: I wonder if he’s not anticipating a cross at the second post.\n9:45 Comment: If he doesn’t prepare to intervene on a cross.\n9:48 Comment: He’s not ready.\n9:50 Comment: He hits the shot.\n9:52 Comment:  That's for sure.\n10:0 Comment: It shows a lack of confidence.\n10:2 Comment: We feel that Benjamin Lecomte is not confident.\n10:5 Comment: Last year, he cleared for

he’s out of the game.\n10:50 Comment: In the last two seasons, there was a lack of concern with relegation.\n10:54 Comment: It came down to 15th and 16th places.\n10:57 Comment: Now, it is said, it remains joy.\n11:0 Comment: Because they are only ever 6 points behind the jump-off.\n11:5 Comment: Everyone draws the parallel with last year’s Toulouse.\n11:8 Comment: We are not at all in that situation.\n11:10 Comment: There were 10 points to come back for Toulouse.\n11:12 Comment: There are only 6 there. It’s not the same.\n11:14 Comment: That's true. But last year, they finished 16th.\n11:16 Comment: You're right. But they had acquired their demeanor quite early.\n11:19 Comment: Thanks to a rather successful first part of the season.\n11:22 Comment: It was the second part of the season that was difficult.\n11:27 Comment: Which is obviously hard for them to understand,\n11:30 Comment: It's a season where they have, perhaps,\n11:33 Comment: the biggest budget in their history in Ligue 1.\n11:35 Comment: They have the 12th budget in Ligue 1.\n11:37 Comment: So, they had the means. They had a workforce that,\n11:39 Comment: particularly on the offensive level, could suggest\n11:43 Comment: that it wouldn't go too badly.\n11:48 Comment: There will be the Bernard Kazanis who…\n11:50 Comment: There are these players who are too low.\n11:52 Comment: They don’t stand out enough.\n11:54 Comment: To press, in particular.\n11:56 Comment: Jeannot’s exit.\n11:59 Comment: Stéphane, you were talking about last season.\n12:1 Comment: It should be noted that, compared to last season,\n12:4 Comment: Just 3-4 players remain from last season's core team.\n12:7 Comment: They have renewed their workforce a lot.\n12:9 Comment: With feedback, but also recruitment.\n12:15 Comment: I'm not going to ask when,\n12:17 Comment: but I am absolutely convinced that there is indeed spirit.\n12:20 Comment: But, as a result, he will be subject to calls from senior players\n12:23 Comment: that we must put it at the far post, this ball.\n12:25 Comment: And he doesn’t take himself for nothing.\n12:27 Comment: He is not preparing to intervene on this strike.\n12:57 Comment: The vigilant account, he made the stops too.\n12:59 Comment: Let’s not forget the account.\n13:1 Comment: Lorient kept the 0-0 thanks to him.\n13:4 Comment: And a ball for Aljadir.\n13:6 Comment: Precisely, the former Arsenal player,\n13:10 Comment: Jérémy Aljadir, gone behind Meunier’s back.\n13:15 Comment: He will bring his energy.\n13:19 Comment: Philippe Otho, who played Ankounkou this time.\n13:22 Comment: Philippe Otho's cross cleared by Ankounkou.\n13:25 Comment: On Siani.\n13:27 Comment: Aljadir who is considering ending his career at the end of the season.\n13:32 Comment: They went looking for him.

They have to stay serious.\n17:26 Comment: But getting a suitcase at all costs doesn’t have a huge importance.\n17:30 Comment: At the level of the gol to verage, they are dropped by Monaco.\n17:34 Comment: They are not going to take over Monaco.\n17:36 Comment: So it won’t change much.\n17:38 Comment: Afterwards you have to continue to play well.\n17:40 Comment: Good play by Di Maria who made the difference.\n17:42 Comment: Kurzawa, the center corner obtained by the left side of PSG.\n17:46 Comment: Paris who beat Lorient 5-0 in the first leg.\n17:58 Comment: A bet different in its composition from that of the evening.\n18:2 Comment: It was a bet in the first leg against Lorient.\n18:4 Comment: Stéphane who had just lost at Guingamp.\n18:6 Comment: 3-0.\n18:7 Comment:  Exactly.\n18:8 Comment: The head of Lévin Kurzawa, captured by Benjamin Lecomte who quickly restarts.\n18:22 Comment: And the blame is on Morera.\n18:24 Comment: In Guingamp it was 2-1 defeat.\n18:26 Comment: Ah it was 2-1 yes.\n18:27 Comment: It’s Montpellier 3-0.\n18:29 Comment: Paris which in Ligue 1 was undefeated in the last 10 matches.\n18:32 Comment: 8 victories, soon the 9th and 2 draws.\n18:35 Comment: It’s a route exactly identical to that of the S-Monaco.\n18:42 Comment: We see Kurzawa’s face again.\n18:44 Comment: This confirms all the difficulties of the Lorient team on set pieces.\n18:48 Comment: There are opportunities very often in these phases for PSG and for many teams against Lorient.\n18:54 Comment: They conceded their 22nd goal from a set piece this evening.\n18:58 Comment: In percentage terms, I don’t know the worst in Ligue 1, but in numbers it is.\n19:2 Comment: Ahead of Montpellier and Nantes who are the 3 most fragile teams in Ligue 1 on set pieces.\n19:11 Comment: Huemba.\n19:16 Comment: Casso.\n19:17 Comment: Canjo.\n19:19 Comment: Marvaux.\n19:23 Comment: Casso, Benjamin, Canjo.\n19:27 Comment: Aliadier.\n19:29 Comment: Filippoto.\n19:30 Comment: Filippoto and Aliadier.\n19:31 Comment: I was thinking of Aliadier because I told myself that with Aliadier in the area, there was still an additional presence.\n19:36 Comment: Well done Cavani and Antoine.\n19:37 Comment: What a return.\n19:38 Comment: DiMaria.\n19:39 Comment: Di Maria’s acceleration.\n19:41 Comment: Cavani.\n19:42 Comment: Pastoret towards Di

East.\n20:25 Comment: Of course it’s important, Paul, the third goal of this match.\n20:27 Comment: Obviously it is important for the Parisians to mark it.\n20:29 Comment: To avoid any overcold.\n20:31 Comment:  Of course.\n20:32 Comment: How would they react if the Orient were to close the gap?\n20:35 Comment: Give it back a little.\n20:37 Comment: We return to the Barcelona

PSG.\n23:3 Comment: And things are obviously becoming very different with what happened last week, with what happened in Barcelona.\n23:10 Comment: Be careful, be careful on the Paris side.\n23:13 Comment: It’s important, Trapp really got his defense in order before Skloder.\n23:21 Comment: Magnificently relayed by Marvaux, then the unstoppable header for Siani.\n23:26 Comment: He’s over his Martignos, Paul.\n23:28 Comment: It’s really well hit by Marvaux, it goes over Cavani.\n23:32 Comment: You saw how Pépernès pulls out Adrien Meunier’s mop of hair.\n23:38 Comment: Both players are hanging on.\n23:40 Comment: It’s Martignos who is being fooled by Siani’s commitment.\n23:44 Comment: The head is perfect because it is pitted.\n23:46 Comment: It’s unstoppable.\n23:49 Comment: It’s only Lorient but we’ll have to be solid for the Parisians.\n23:52 Comment: This is Siani’s second goal, he had scored against Rennes already this season in Lorient.\n23:58 Comment: Before the match we talked about the confidence of a coach.\n24:0 Comment: I'm sure he'll think a lot before making his changes, Emery.\n24:5 Comment: It was Aliadier the incoming player who brought in this corner.\n24:10 Comment: Here he is, Jérémy Aliadier.\n24:14 Comment: Filippo Tho.\n24:15 Comment: Filippo Tho, there is a slip at the start of the action.\n24:19 Comment: Filippo Tho who insists, stopped by Martignos.\n24:22 Comment: Meunier Clearance.\n24:23 Comment: Ravillard-Pasoret.\n24:25 Comment: Nkunku.\n24:27 Comment: We will particularly watch for how the Parisians will do Paul to keep this ball.\n24:34 Comment: To keep it alive, so as not to lose it too quickly as is the case here.\n24:38 Comment: With Guacaso.\n24:44 Comment: Guacaso facing Thomas Meunier.\n24:48 Comment: Also see how they will behave physically because,\n24:51 Comment: as you said, 8 out of 11 players were on the trip and in the match in Barcelona.\n24:57 Comment: 8 starters out of 11.\n25:0 Comment: No change in sight for the moment anyway.\n25:3 Comment: Emery really played the beaten card.\n25:6 Comment: Since the 3 who are not on the ground are those who were not traveling to the Orient.\n25:10 Comment: They are suspended or injured.\n25:11 Comment: I really consider that there is a form of logic because removing 2 or 3 players would have pointed out the culprits.\n25:20 Comment:  Well done Moreira with Bucanjo, a ball that didn't go out.\n25:23 Comment: Benjamin Bucanjo.\n25:25 Comment: Moreira continued his effort.\n25:26 Comment: Strong center of Moreira.\n25:27 Comment: Second post.\n25:28 Comment: There again a lack of presence on the part of the Orienté in the opposing area.\n25:32 Comment: But Philippe Oteau will get it back when Meunier leaves.\n25:35 Comment: And there we saw the fatigue of Thomas Meunier precisely on this action.\n25:38 Comment: And yet Thomas Meunier is physically unusual.\n25:42 Comment: And the Cavani who seems to keep all his energy.\n25:48 Comment: Ah yes, he’s not tired.\n25:50 Comment: How does Olivier react on the Parisian bench?\n25:53 Comment: Faces are closed and an ouch would like a lot fewer instructions.\n25:59 Comment: But hey, we’re not going to interpret all of the coach’s actions.\n26:5 Comment: The Parisian faces we see Kimpembe, Maxwell, Zoumana Kamara, the goalkeeper coach Nicolas Déon, Alphonse Arreola.\n26:15 Comment: This is where PSG needs leaders in the team.\n26:18 Comment: We actually see Cavani who…\n26:20 Comment: Very good ball from Meunier for Di Maria.\n26:23 Comment: Di Maria for Cavani, there is a big mistake.\n26:25 Comment: She’s outside the surface.\n26:26 Comment: It could be a red card because he’s really the last defender.\n26:29 Comment: While Valéry Chaperon is Moreira at fault.\n26:32 Comment:  It's pretty.\n26:33 Comment: Yes, he’s doing very, very well because…\n26:38 Comment: Olivier Lepage.\n26:39 Comment: The Last Defender.\n26:40 Comment: He’s the last defender, tackling from behind.\n26:43 Comment: Wilful foul on the opponent who had a chance to score.\n26:47 Comment: I don’t think Péberna is in a position to intervene.\n26:50 Comment: I think

I don't think Ayémeri liked it at all either.\n38:37 Comment: I don’t think it’s going to stay that way.\n38:40 Comment: There will be a serious explanation.\n38:42 Comment: I was telling you, when he sent off to warm up, there was a fairly virulent exchange between the two.\n38:48 Comment: It surprises a few people around me.\n38:51 Comment: I don’t really know what they said.\n38:53 Comment: Did he initially refuse to go and warm up?\n38:57 Comment: I wouldn’t have a clue.\n38:59 Comment: Something happened. It's not possible.\n39:13 Comment: Originally, I don't know the two mechanics at all.\n39:15 Comment: For both mechanics, it’s a bit of a hot thing.\n39:18 Comment: I don't know why, but both mechanics are there.\n39:22 Comment: What is quite a shame, Paul, is that the people of Lorient did not support at that time.\n39:26 Comment: They had an opportunity. There was considerable uncertainty for Paris Saint-Germain.\n39:31 Comment: They could have pressed.\n39:33 Comment: Especially since the public understood that it was the right time.\n39:35 Comment: There were only a third from Lorient during that period.\n39:38 Comment: They only have one shot until the second half, it is aimed.\n39:42 Comment: A shot in the second half.\n39:45 Comment: That was enough for them to score a goal.\n39:47 Comment: Opposite to Immaria and alone.\n39:49 Comment: Yeah, Draxler, with Siani again.\n39:52 Comment: Happy second half, Michael Siani.\n39:57 Comment: And

should have a central role in the PSG team.\n40:13 Comment: He wasn’t on the sheet at Barcelona, ​​he was in the stands, Maxwell.\n40:18 Comment: And returned from Hamel to the Lorient side.\n40:22 Comment: There is a risk taken by Casody, Paul, because he is an attacker, Hamel.\n40:27 Comment: He’s a guy from home, a guy from London.\n40:30 Comment: Who happens to be a guy from my area, a guy from Alençon, Arnaud Lwemba.\n40:33 Comment: But when you bring in a guy from London, you don’t take any chances.\n40:36 Comment: From the looks of a guy from Alençon, I’m not sure.\n40:40 Comment: I

    "summary": "Lorient 1 - 2 Paris Saint-Germain (PSG)\n\n**First Half:**\n\nThe match began under the bright lights of Lorient's Stade du Moustoir, a cold and tense atmosphere filled with anticipation. Paris Saint-Germain (PSG), fresh from a traumatic and humiliating exit from the Champions League at the hands of Barcelona, arrived with a desperate need to regain some form and restore confidence against a Lorient side fighting to avoid relegation from Ligue 1.\n\nFrom the kickoff, the Parisians looked keen to impose their will. That early desire was epitomized by their crisp, confident passing, reminiscent of the synergy they typically exhibit, though agonizingly absent in Barcelona. Key players like Layvin Kurzawa, Javier Pastore, and Julian Draxler orchestrated their attacks, trying to replicate their best performances.\n\nDespite their commanding possession, PSG showed signs of lingering trauma, frequently harking back to their recent debacle, where they managed a mere single pass in the last ten minutes against Barcelona. This sense of panic and anxiety was evident in their game, though they tried to suppress it through disciplined play.\n\nLorient, on the other hand, stood resilient, each player offering a stark contrast in style and urgency. Their precarious position in the league, six points off safety, demanded a disciplined effort to stave off PSG’s advances. They seemed conscious of the Parisian’s psychological vulnerability post-Barcelona, looking to capitalize on any opportunity.\n\nThe first big chance came early when Kurzawa, Pastore, and Draxler combined beautifully, but their efforts were thwarted by a lack of a decisive final touch. There was also an early stumble from Lorient's Michael Ciani, who conceded a dangerous free kick by making an unnecessary tackle. The free kick, taken by Edinson Cavani, flew too close to the Lorient keeper and didn't trouble the scoreline.\n\nDespite PSG's attempts, Lorient's defensive regiment, orchestrated around Benjamin Lecomte and Michael Ciani, held strong. Lecomte, in particular, was vigilant, making essential saves and clearances to keep his side in contention. Lorient also relied on the creativity of players like Sylvain Marvaux, who occasionally broke through the Parisian lines, challenging Adrien Rabiot and Thiago Silva.\n\nClose to the half-hour mark, PSG's relentless pressing bore fruit. From a corner kick by Angel Di Maria, confusion reigned supreme in the Lorient defense. Amid the mayhem, the ball took a deflection off Edinson Cavani, marginally aided by Lorient defender Jeremy Jeannot, and nestled into the net. PSG's celebration was somewhat muted, acknowledging their fortunate break.\n\nHowever, the scoreboard read 1-0, a crucial cushion for the Parisians who struggled to maintain their rhythm. Lorient tried to respond immediately, using their set-pieces to create chances. A well-taken corner saw a thunderous header from Marvaux that narrowly missed the mark, sending alarms across the PSG camp.\n\nThroughout the first half, Lorient's energetic forward play, led by the likes of Marvaux and Jeannot, continued to challenge PSG's defense. A notable moment was seen when Benjamin Moukandjo made an impressive run, only to be stymied by poor finishing on the part of his teammates. Their attempts underscored the critical absence of Majid Waris, a key player sidelined due to suspension.\n\nAs the half drew to a close, PSG nearly doubled their lead when a beautifully orchestrated move involving Pastore, Di Maria, and Draxler was foiled by a heroic save from Benjamin Lecomte. His effort to keep Lorient in the game was inspiring, spotlighting the stark contrast in fortunes between the two goalkeepers.\n\nLecomte's save was one of many moments where Lorient's defense balanced on a knife's edge, warding off PSG’s threats but failing to mount a credible counter-offensive. Lorient entered the break trailing by a single goal, a manageable deficit but carrying a severe challenge given PSG's caliber and determination to reclaim their form.\n\n**Second Half:**\n\nFresh from the locker rooms, PSG looked to consolidate their advantage and avoid any potential slips. An early highlight in the second half was orchestrated by the young Christopher Nkunku, who continued to demonstrate his burgeoning talent, linking up well with experienced PSG players to create a flurry of opportunities.\n\nJust minutes into the half, a fluid PSG attack saw Edinson Cavani setting up Nkunku, whose strike from the edge of the box beat Benjamin Lecomte, doubling PSG's lead. The goal was a moment of immense pride for Nkunku, who netted his first Ligue 1 goal in striking fashion, catching Lecomte off guard.\n\nDespite their better position, PSG didn't rest on their laurels. They pushed forward with intent to solidify their lead. Lorient, sensing the urgency, decided to mix things up. They brought on Jérémy Aliadière, hoping his experience and attacking prowess could spark a comeback. However, immediate impact was lacking as Lorient’s offense struggled to break PSG’s defensive setup.\n\nThe match tempo heightened with every passing minute. PSG maintained dominance, but critical errors began surfacing within their ranks. The Parisians were visibly wearied from their exertions in Barcelona, amplifying the possibility of Lorient capitalizing on any slip-ups.\n\nLorient finally found their breakthrough moment thanks to a well-executed corner from Marvaux. Michael Ciani rose above the rest, his powerful header leaving Kevin Trapp no chance, narrowing the margin to 2-1. The goal reinvigorated Lorient, bringing the home crowd to their feet, sensing a possible turnaround.\n\nTensions climbed as the match approached the final quarter. PSG’s Thomas Meunier sustained an injury, compelling an extended substitution saga. With Serge Aurier taking an unusually long time to get ready, the Parisians temporarily played a man short, intensifying Lorient’s pressure.\n\nOnce Aurier finally entered the pitch, the sense of urgency within PSG's lines was palpable. They endeavored to retain possession and thwart Lorient’s attacking moves. However, Lorient's persistence tested PSG’s resilience repeatedly. The defensive unit led by Thiago Silva and Marquinhos held firm, attempting to stifle Lorient's occasional forays into their half.\n\nIn the renewed bid to stretch their lead, PSG substitutes, such as Hatem Ben Arfa, were brought into the fray. Ben Arfa, known for his flair and creativity, aimed to light up PSG’s attack but found scarce opportunities as Lorient tightened their defense.\n\nLorient continued to press for an equalizer, with Benjamin Maukandjo and Sylvain Marvaux driving their efforts. PSG’s collective defensive efforts were commendable as they absorbed the pressure, pushing forward strategically whenever possible. The closing minutes saw rapid transitions and end-to-end action, with both teams playing with fervor.\n\nDespite PSG's labors to sustain their dominance, Lorient provided a spirited final push. The nail-biting tension culminated with a resilient PSG maintaining their slender lead till the final whistle. Lorient's late surge, marked by commendable set-piece executions and counter-attacking attempts, fell short. PSG’s disciplined defense and critical interventions, particularly from Trapp, sufficed to secure a much-needed 2-1 victory.\n\nThe final whistle brought relief and tentative celebration for PSG, a step toward mending their fractured confidence while keeping their Ligue 1 title aspirations alive. For Lorient, the match underscored their defensive frailties but also highlighted the fighting spirit necessary for their relegation battle.\n\n**Final Outcome:**\n\nIn the end, PSG triumphed 2-1 over Lorient. Goals from an own goal caused by Lorient defender Jeremy Jeannot and Christopher Nkunku marked PSG’s scoring, while Michael Ciani’s header provided Lorient’s solitary consolation. The euphoric moments interspersed with moments of anxiety for both teams, laid bare the high stakes of top-flight football, with PSG taking valuable points home while Lorient pondered over missed chances and commendable resolve."
