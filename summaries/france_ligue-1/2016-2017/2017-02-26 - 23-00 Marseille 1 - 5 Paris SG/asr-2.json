the methodology\n5:4 Comment: in Marseille on an all-terrain pressing there on the ball from the start but he is completely good\n5:6 Comment: of course on the ball from the start but there are a lot of chances for the partial matches, I think it is probably the best chance for the Paris or Marseille matches.\n5:8 Comment: I think he'll be able to last a long time, all the same, with this pressing.\n5:12 Comment: Yes, then we sense in Parisian behavior a great serenity for the moment.\n5:17 Comment: They are not panicked at all because they live in these first minutes of the match.\n5:24 Comment: Marco Veracchio who surrenders.\n5:33 Comment: We see this delivery from Thiago Silva and the first goal!\n5:35 Comment: He is for Paris Saint-Germain, the central hinge, decisive passer.\n5:40 Comment: Thiago Silva, captain and scorer.\n5:42 Comment: Marquinhos, PSG who already stands out on the OM pitch with a kick.\n5:47 Comment: 1-0 for Paris.\n5:49 Comment: And then surround yourself.\n5:50 Comment: Above all, it is a very, very well prepared action.\n5:53 Comment: It's obviously worked well in training with a standout from Thiago Silva.\n5:57 Comment: We'll see, he frees himself from Payet's marking.\n6:1 Comment: He refocuses the ball for Marquinhos.\n6:4 Comment: There is a lot of complicity.\n6:5 Comment: There is a lot of difficulty between the two Brazilian players in this action.\n6:7 Comment: It's true that he benefits from a good ball from Verratti.\n6:9 Comment: And it's really a pass from Thiago Silva for his friend in central defense.\n6:15 Comment: Seen from below, it's impressive where both players went after the ball.\n6:18 Comment: It's surveillance.\n6:19 Comment: It's also impressive the passivity of the two Marseille players who were supposed to be marking.\n6:24 Comment: First Payet and then Evra, the reception on Marquinhos.\n6:28 Comment: And it's Marquinhos' first goal this season in Ligue 1 on an assist from Thiago Silva.\n6:35 Comment: For his big comeback, we note that the two Marseille recruits of the winter, Payet and Evra, were far from their direct opponents on this set piece.\n6:44 Comment: It's fatal.\n6:45 Comment: And PSG which is already in a very comfortable situation.\n6:48 Comment: We've been playing for less than 7 minutes, Paul Le Boët.\n6:50 Comment: Yes, but you said that Payet was far away, that's true.\n6:52 Comment: But I don't think he's the best player to mark Thiago Silva.\n6:55 Comment: Thiago Silva, he has an impressive head game.\n6:57 Comment: This is not Payet's strong point.\n6:59 Comment: I find it quite strange to see Payet in this position, on this action.\n7:5 Comment: He takes great joy in being caught at the moment.\n7:9 Comment: We understand it.\n7:10 Comment: We understand it because it is both the realization of his team's choral start to the match and then the work of the week in training.\n7:17 Comment: Parisians who have a full week.\n7:19 Comment: And they make Payet's response which is taken up with great authority by Adria Rabiot as a boss who prevents Payet from progressing.\n7:26 Comment: Clearance of Trappes behind.\n7:27 Comment: Sakai for Maxime Lopez.\n7:29 Comment: There is Matuidi, Pastore, Rabiot, Kurzawa.\n7:35 Comment: It will calm down the Marseille pressing.\n7:38 Comment: Of course, of course.\n7:39 Comment: And Parisians love it.\n7:40 Comment: They love to lead the score, keep the ball, make the opponents come.\n7:45 Comment: Same who scores a little more than a third of his goals from set pieces.\n7:49 Comment: A nice shot from a corner.\n7:51 Comment: A second from an indirect free kick.\n7:53 Comment: Masterfully struck by Marco Verratti.\n7:57 Comment: Good recovery from Zambourguissa with Lopez.\n8:3 Comment: Dimitri Payet.\n8:4 Comment: Bertheling, Toggi.\n8:6 Comment: And return of the scorer, Marquinhos.\n8:9 Comment: There is an undeniable fault there.\n8:14 Comment: It would be interesting to return to the fault which caused the free kick.\n8:17 Comment: Because this one was much less obvious than this one.\n8:20 Comment: Lack of winner initially.\n8:22 Comment: But on Rabiot.\n8:23 Comment: If he acts like one.\n8:25 Comment: Paris is still impressive in midfield.\n8:31 Comment: There isn't even Sauré who comes at times.\n8:33 Comment: The four players on the ball have great control.\n8:39 Comment: It was great, Paga.\n8:40 Comment: You will feel it even better than us.\n8:42 Comment: It’s the serenity of Parisians.\n8:44 Comment: Really the confidence of this team.\n8:46 Comment: While we could have imagined that they would be a little shaken in the first minutes.\n8:49 Comment: It has not happened.\n8:51 Comment: For four years, a championship in big matches, they have always been present.\n8:57 Comment: We saw them in matches against the top 10.\n9:1 Comment: They are not necessarily often.\n9:3 Comment: We remember the matches against Nice and Monaco in particular.\n9:5 Comment: There, it's not the case.\n9:7 Comment: Here I'm talking about matches where they must win at all costs.\n9:9 Comment: Because they know they have to win at all costs tonight.\n9:15 Comment: Because there were these victories.\n9:17 Comment: From Nice against Montpellier.\n9:19 Comment: From Monaco to Guingamp.\n9:21 Comment: Which placed the Parisians in the obligation to impose themselves on Barcels.\n9:24 Comment: It is a club which has the permanent and constant obligation to impose itself whatever happens.\n9:31 Comment: It is a club which has the obligation to impose itself.\n9:35 Comment: They have difficulty releasing the balloons on the day of Marseille.\n9:37 Comment: The pass to Evra was intercepted. Lucas.\n9:41 Comment: Return of Patrice Evra.\n9:43 Comment: Fouls on Lucas.\n9:45 Comment: It takes a lot of mistakes.\n9:47 Comment: They are overwhelmed.\n9:49 Comment: They are forced to make mistakes. It's going too fast for them at the moment.\n9:51 Comment: For the extension of not having Draxler and Di Maria, it's here in hand.\n9:57 Comment: The two, Pastore and Lucas, still pose problems.\n10:4 Comment: The fool, Paga, important. Di Maria, as we know, is coming back from an ischio injury for which he was not ready.\n10:6 Comment: And for Draxler, it was more surprising. He is ill.\n10:8 Comment: He was sick today.\n10:10 Comment: And so he was perhaps not in the condition to start, in any case, 100% this match.\n10:15 Comment: The coach told us...\n10:16 Comment: Emery?\n10:17 Comment: All right.\n10:18 Comment: Ok, thank you Pagas.\n10:18 Comment: An interview, yes.\n10:21 Comment: There he is, the German Julian Braxler.\n10:30 Comment: So obviously watch out for the set piece.\n10:31 Comment: We just got the illustration a few minutes ago.\n10:34 Comment: It's Lucas who's going to kick this one.\n10:36 Comment: Lucas to Marquinhos.\n10:39 Comment: This time he is elusive for the Brazilian defender.\n10:43 Comment: So we see the fault first, Paul.\n10:44 Comment: There it is, the winner's fault on Rabiot.\n10:45 Comment: Really not huge.\n10:47 Comment: Oh yes, all the same.\n10:47 Comment: With the upper body.\n10:49 Comment: All right.\n10:50 Comment: And that's it, then the shot.\n10:51 Comment: This is where the distribution of Marseillais is bad.\n10:55 Comment: With Payet marking Thiago Silva.\n10:58 Comment: Look, the bouncing Basque who lives these matches intensely, passionately.\n11:3 Comment: And then there is the satisfaction of a job well done.\n11:6 Comment: We see that it is repeated.\n11:10 Comment: Miller, Miller who is launched, who will challenge them for a contract.\n11:13 Comment: Rolando, he got hit by the ball.\n11:14 Comment: It will be a corner for Paris Saint-Germain.\n11:15 Comment: They have difficulty controlling the Parisian environment.\n11:17 Comment: They don't control anything at all yet.\n11:19 Comment: The Marseillais are...\n11:21 Comment: That is to say in the animation, who takes who, it will be difficult.\n11:23 Comment: They have difficulty controlling especially on this left side of the defense.\n11:27 Comment: Meunier and Lucas hit Evra.\n11:33 Comment: We recall the balance of power.\n11:34 Comment: Paris is second.\n11:35 Comment: OM are only sixth in the ranking.\n11:37 Comment: And if we consider the return phase, OM are thirteenth in the League.\n11:40 Comment: Since January.\n11:42 Comment: Gourmère, with the head.\n11:44 Comment: And even.\n11:45 Comment: A save on this header from Kurzawa, from Pelé.\n11:48 Comment: Absolutely alone at the penalty point.\n11:51 Comment: It is Rolando who lets himself be inspired by Thiago Silva.\n11:54 Comment: He wants to help his partner.\n12:4 Comment: There is a chance for the Parisians.\n12:5 Comment: It's still very hot in the Marseille penalty area.\n12:10 Comment: Rolando rowing.\n12:11 Comment: It plays with Ramir Pastorey, served by Rabiot.\n12:14 Comment: Pastorey who will be stopped by Zambo Aghissam.\n12:17 Comment: And who gets the ball.\n12:18 Comment: Rabiot.\n12:19 Comment: Pastorey.\n12:20 Comment: You don't trust me in advance of the match.\n12:28 Comment: Love these matches in Marseille.\n12:30 Comment: Love this electric atmosphere that accompanied them.\n12:32 Comment: We imagine that today's PSG players are a bit in the state of mind you were in.\n12:36 Comment: Yes, but I already loved those matches in the old Vélodrome stadium.\n12:40 Comment: With this new stadium.\n12:42 Comment: Where it resonates even more.\n12:44 Comment: I find that the atmosphere takes on yet another dimension.\n12:50 Comment: And it galvanizes them more than it actually inhibits them.\n12:52 Comment: That's it.\n12:53 Comment: Yes yes.\n12:54 Comment: They are used to these beautiful atmospheres.\n12:58 Comment: Winner with Florian Thauvin, Sakai, BRNJ.\n13:3 Comment: They're trying to find depth with Linton J.\n13:5 Comment: It is recovered by Payet at the feet of Verratti.\n13:7 Comment: Dimitri Payet facing the game.\n13:9 Comment: Dimitri Payet.\n13:10 Comment: Not bad.\n13:12 Comment: This pass from Payet to Sakai is beautiful.\n13:14 Comment: The center of Sakai.\n13:15 Comment: The flight of Trappes.\n13:17 Comment: And the possible counter for PSG with Lucas.\n13:20 Comment: Evra went ahead.\n13:22 Comment: It's Vainqueur who will try to close against Lucas.\n13:24 Comment: He could have chosen the place on Cavani who stank of the through ball.\n13:27 Comment: Verratti.\n13:30 Comment: This is Cavani's advantage.\n13:31 Comment: Meunier's call.\n13:32 Comment: There is a huge area that is abandoned.\n13:34 Comment: The center of Meunier.\n13:35 Comment: Oh, Cavani didn't believe it.\n13:39 Comment: It's a caviar, however, from Thomas Meunier.\n13:42 Comment: I want to say that the left side of OM and the French team is having difficulty containing Meunier and Lucas.\n13:49 Comment: Payet is not a defender at heart.\n13:51 Comment: Paul and then Patrice Evra are currently in difficulty.\n13:54 Comment: Clinton N'G looks like he has legs of fire.\n13:56 Comment: The Cameroonian.\n13:57 Comment: G with Dimitri Payet.\n13:59 Comment: Dimitri Payet against Thomas Meunier.\n14:1 Comment: Dimitri Payet who will arm the strike.\n14:4 Comment: Oh the thrill.\n14:5 Comment: Oh the thrill for the Marseille supporters.\n14:7 Comment: And for the Parisian goalkeeper of Dimitri Payet.\n14:10 Comment: This is his strong point.\n14:11 Comment: Return to your right foot and find the striking position.\n14:14 Comment: And I'm surprised that Meunier defends like that.\n14:16 Comment: That it frees up as much space inside.\n14:18 Comment: Because that’s really what Dimitri Payet likes.\n14:22 Comment: He put his whole Reunion heart into it.\n14:25 Comment: Who hasn't yet experienced the joy of scoring in a classico.\n14:29 Comment: He takes it a little outside and it escapes the frame.\n14:33 Comment: It will give heart to the work for Marseillais.\n14:38 Comment: Strike which comes out quietly.\n14:40 Comment: What tranquility.\n14:42 Comment: Rabiot.\n14:45 Comment: Pastorey.\n14:46 Comment: Kurzawa.\n14:50 Comment: Rabiot.\n14:51 Comment: Pastorey no surprise.\n14:52 Comment: Paul who leaves this left side to come inside the game.\n14:58 Comment: He will occupy a more central position than Draxler.\n15:0 Comment: Draxler likes to hit on this left side.\n15:6 Comment: Rabiot.\n15:7 Comment: Beratti.\n15:9 Comment: He's late unpacking.\n15:10 Comment: Oh no.\n15:11 Comment: To which Beratti passes for Blaise Mathhuidi.\n15:12 Comment: Mathhuidi for Lucas.\n15:13 Comment: It's fluid.\n15:14 Comment: There is a lot of space, it’s true in the Marseille lines.\n15:16 Comment: And the Parisians are rushing in.\n15:17 Comment: The Parisians are taking advantage of it with Marco Beratti.\n15:20 Comment: Marco Beratti to Pastorey.\n15:22 Comment: The Milan pass.\n15:23 Comment: It's a school goal scored by Edinson Cavani.\n15:27 Comment: His 26th in Ligue 1 on a marvelous pass from the magician.\n15:32 Comment: Ravier Pastorey.\n15:33 Comment: And Paris which leads 2-0.\n15:35 Comment: 2-0 already on the OM pitch.\n15:39 Comment: They are too strong.\n15:40 Comment: What coordination between the passer and Cavani.\n15:43 Comment: This is exceptional.\n15:44 Comment: Paul's goal came from so far away.\n15:46 Comment: It came from so far away.\n15:47 Comment: Beratti's fantastic pass at the start.\n15:49 Comment: Pastorey's not bad too.\n15:51 Comment: Pagard looks.\n15:52 Comment: A key.\n15:53 Comment: He feels Cavani is going to ask in depth.\n15:55 Comment: He's not out of the game.\n15:56 Comment: It's well refereed.\n15:57 Comment: This Pastorey-Cavani complicity is exceptional.\n16:1 Comment: Because Pastorey knows that Cavani is going to ask for it in depth.\n16:5 Comment: There you need to have knowledge of the partner.\n16:7 Comment: Know what Cavani has.\n16:8 Comment: What Cavani will propose.\n16:10 Comment: And it’s truly exceptional.\n16:12 Comment: Eric Carrière often talks about hidden passes.\n16:15 Comment: This one is beautifully hidden.\n16:17 Comment: And that surprises the Marseille defense.\n16:20 Comment: All in one touch Paul.\n16:22 Comment: And Ravier Pastorey’s pass.\n16:24 Comment: And the finish obviously from the matador Edinson Cavani.\n16:28 Comment: It's a beautiful, extraordinary game.\n16:30 Comment: Who delights us as he delighted us against EFC Barcelona.\n16:34 Comment: It’s in the same vein this evening.\n16:36 Comment: And it's happening too quickly.\n16:37 Comment: Much too quickly for OM.\n16:39 Comment: That's why it's terrible for opponents.\n16:42 Comment: Because they leave with intentions of pressing, of intensity.\n16:46 Comment: But Parisian talent defuses all that very quickly.\n16:49 Comment: What is surprising is that they added a defensive midfielder to defend a little more.\n16:54 Comment: But...\n16:55 Comment: There is still a slip in Samson's place.\n16:58 Comment: But at the exit...\n17:0 Comment: There is so much space between the Marseille lines and the gallery.\n17:3 Comment: It's not a compact team.\n17:5 Comment: Paris is having a blast. Paris is engulfed.\n17:7 Comment: There is such technical quality.\n17:10 Comment: Such confidence.\n17:12 Comment: Cavani, you see since Carlos Bianchi, no striker in Ligue 1 has scored so many goals on the 27th day.\n17:21 Comment: He is even on the trail of a certain Josip Skoblar.\n17:25 Comment: Edinson Cavani.\n17:27 Comment: And his famous 44 goals in 1972 if memory serves.\n17:35 Comment: Sachai.\n17:49 Comment: Sachai with Thauvin.\n17:51 Comment: Sachai.\n17:53 Comment: Ball recovered by the Parisians.\n17:56 Comment: Herati.\n18:0 Comment: It's difficult for Marseille in terms of strategy now.\n18:3 Comment: Because...\n18:4 Comment: obviously there will be the desire to come back to the score but...\n18:7 Comment: They switched to 4-2-3 Paul, the Marseillais didn't tell me...\n18:10 Comment: They came to speak to Rudi Garcia so we have to see a little bit to follow but hey...\n18:15 Comment: It won't change much anyway, it's beyond that, it's beyond the organization,\n18:20 Comment: It’s the Parisian entertainment that makes the difference Paul, right?\n18:24 Comment: Little Lopez is...\n18:25 Comment: Talent, mastery...\n18:28 Comment: Little Lopez has aged, I have the impression, with Angie, right?\n18:31 Comment: A little higher in any case on this situation...\n18:34 Comment: Paillac and Thauvin who have salutes perhaps of a notch, is that it?\n18:36 Comment: They play 4-4-2, right?\n18:38 Comment: Yes but he has brought Lopez up a bit for the moment...\n18:42 Comment: Well, he doesn't have the ball so it doesn't pose too many difficulties...\n18:47 Comment: Winner with Sakai...\n18:49 Comment: Sakai-Thauvin's goal...\n18:51 Comment: July beaten by Thiago Silva...\n18:53 Comment: No fault of the Brazilian...\n18:55 Comment: Ravier Pastore...\n18:57 Comment: With Verratti...\n18:59 Comment: Imagine if you added a Ravier Pastore to the second...\n19:1 Comment: He's getting in good shape in the Parisian rocket...\n19:7 Comment: Because we only talked about Draxler's absence before the match...\n19:9 Comment: We will only talk after the match about the presence of Pastore...\n19:13 Comment: As it went...\n19:24 Comment: Come on Ravier Pastore who managed to put commitment and intensity into it...\n19:29 Comment: How hard it is in Marseille to settle down...\n19:31 Comment: In the Parisian camp...\n19:32 Comment: They can't do it from the start...\n19:34 Comment: They can't be at the top either...\n19:36 Comment: It reminds me a little of the match played in Bordeaux...\n19:39 Comment: A few weeks ago...\n19:41 Comment: It's true that the people of Bordeaux had good intentions...\n19:44 Comment: They are from Bordeaux in good shape and more...\n19:46 Comment: But against Paris it's extremely complicated...\n19:51 Comment: Bordeaux which is the third French team in the return phase...\n19:54 Comment: Who took 3-0 at home...\n19:56 Comment: For now it's already been 2...\n20:1 Comment: There are only 20 minutes played in this ONPG..\n20:4 Comment: Trappe raises it towards Thomas Meunier...\n20:7 Comment: Payet a little short...\n20:9 Comment: Thomas Meunier who is going to put on the gas...\n20:11 Comment: Yes Payet who does not accompany...\n20:13 Comment: He lets Meunier slip away...\n20:14 Comment: The Parisian player against the rights...\n20:15 Comment: We are planning to hit...\n20:16 Comment: Lucas... Lucas going full axis...\n20:20 Comment: Welcome back this time...\n20:21 Comment: The winner...\n20:22 Comment: Sambou Anguissa...\n20:26 Comment: And we shoot all these people...\n20:28 Comment: These thousands of people who were there very early...\n20:30 Comment: Who awaken the exploit...\n20:32 Comment: It will be very complicated...\n20:33 Comment: Obviously it is always possible...\n20:35 Comment: There are only 20 minutes played...\n20:36 Comment: But it still seems very very compromised for the ONPG..\n20:38 Comment: The long game you can't...\n20:39 Comment: The short game is difficult...\n20:41 Comment: Very very complicated in the animation in principle...\n20:43 Comment: So what do we do ? Long game? Short game?\n20:46 Comment: Yes...\n20:47 Comment: But from below it seems...\n20:49 Comment: Very very complicated...\n20:50 Comment: But what do we do? Long game? Short game?\n20:51 Comment: Yes...\n20:52 Comment: It's playable against this team...\n20:54 Comment: There is too much difference in level...\n20:56 Comment: Scoblard his record is 1971 eh...\n20:59 Comment: Not 72...\n21:0 Comment: Philippe Doucet...\n21:1 Comment: Philippe Maien...\n21:2 Comment: Their call for order...\n21:3 Comment: 71...72...70...71...\n21:5 Comment: 70-71...\n21:6 Comment:

Paul...\n22:8 Comment: This image of Cavani and Lucas is incredible...\n22:11 Comment: Yeah but it's not easy for Lucas to give it to Cavani...\n22:15 Comment: Because the defender places himself well on the passing line...\n22:18 Comment: What is the mistake between Evra and Rolando...\n22:20 Comment: Lucas looks but...\n22:22 Comment: Fanny gets on the passing line...\n22:24 Comment: It's not that easy to give it...\n22:26 Comment: And it's a very nice save from Pelé in passing...\n22:28 Comment: He gave us an Ibra Cavani there...\n22:30 Comment: With the port at Lucas...\n22:32 Comment:

strive to make difficult raises.\n4:7 Comment: Clinton J, he failed to give it back to Payet.\n4:10 Comment: Adrien Rabiot over towards Pastorey.\n4:12 Comment: Fanny, taken by Pastorey.\n4:14 Comment: Pastorey with Kurzawa.\n4:16 Comment: Kurzawa, you say he’s going to let Lucas’ shot slip away.\n4:19 Comment: And the third goal of Paris Saint-Germain.\n4:21 Comment: The 15th staff this season for Lucas.\n4:24 Comment: How simple it seems this evening for the Parisians to score a goal at OM.\n4:29 Comment: Signed Lucas.\n4:30 Comment:  It's too easy.\n4:32 Comment: They make the Marseillais’ restarts extremely difficult.\n4:36 Comment: They recover the balls and they continue behind.\n4:39 Comment: Big mistake all the same from Fanny, Paul, who was not under pressure when he missed that restart.\n4:44 Comment: There is the fault of Fanny who gives the ball back to Pastorey.\n4:47 Comment: And behind that comes Kurzawa.\n4:50 Comment: And there is Cavani, and there is Mathhuidi, and there is Lucas, and there is Pastorey, and there is Rabiot in the opposing area.\n4:56 Comment: Yes, it lacks defensive aggressiveness in the area.\n4:59 Comment: The scarf for Pastorey.\n5:2 Comment: A useful scarf shot because the pass is good.\n5:7 Comment: Cabela coming home.\n5:8 Comment: I think Cetourin is going to come out.\n5:11 Comment: It can be very, very expensive upon arrival.\n5:12 Comment: It’s Ancel G who’s going to come out.\n5:14 Comment: If Parisians have the desire to continue, to continue the efforts.\n5:19 Comment: It could end with a very, very heavy score for the Marseillais.\n5:23 Comment: It’s already for now, as we speak, Paul, if the score remained there,\n5:26 Comment: it would be to come back with the biggest victory for PSG in Marseille.\n5:32 Comment: It would be a return to the famous year 2003 at Ronaldinho, with the Vélodrome on fire.\n5:37 Comment: Thauvin's shot perhaps to revive OM. No, it's not on target.\n5:44 Comment: Cabela is in court.\n5:46 Comment: A word about Lucas, 15 goals for the Brazilian, his 9th in Ligue 1.\n5:51 Comment: We talk a lot about Pastorey and his 35 goals this season.\n5:55 Comment: Already all competition combined.\n5:57 Comment: 15 for Lucas who also exposes the counters.\n6:0 Comment: Lucas who participated in all PSG matches in Ligue 1.\n6:4 Comment: And Pastorey who signed his first two assists of the season.\n6:16 Comment: Rémi Cabela’s trainer.\n6:19 Comment: He killed the pass. There he is not a decisive passer, he is a decisive player for Lévin Curzava.\n6:29 Comment: The Marseillais who continue to go high.\n6:31 Comment: It’s a bit suicidal after all.\n6:35 Comment: The players, for example, have no ability to get out of this kind of pressure.\n6:38 Comment: That it’s taking enormous risks.\n6:41 Comment: So it works.\n6:43 Comment: Dimitri Payet.\n6:45 Comment: Dimitri Payet is looking for a solution.\n6:47 Comment: She arrives with Rémi Cabela on the left side.\n6:50 Comment: Rémi Cabela, William Vainqueur.\n6:54 Comment: Sakai.\n6:59 Comment: Lopez, Sakai.\n7:2 Comment: Thauvin.\n7:4 Comment: With Sakai, this rise of Sakai is good.\n7:7 Comment: What will Monsieur Bastien say?\n7:9 Comment: Corner.\n7:10 Comment: Lévin Curzava was very, very limited.\n7:12 Comment: That’s where he needs to make progress defensively.\n7:19 Comment: It’s when he covers his goal that Curzava just breaks down.\n7:26 Comment: Corner.\n7:27 Comment: Paulo Hebb with Florian Thauvin.\n7:30 Comment: That’s for no one.\n7:31 Comment: It will be very complicated to recover.\n7:34 Comment: Cabela makes the effort.\n7:39 Comment: Remi Cabela.\n7:41 Comment: That’s Thiago Silva.\n7:42 Comment: He is arrested by the Parisian captain Mathhuidi.\n7:46 Comment: Thiago Silva is a failure.\n7:48 Comment: What tranquility, what serenity.\n7:50 Comment: On the avenue, there’s Draxel who’s going to miss.\n7:55 Comment: Well done Henri Benimo.\n7:56 Comment: Henri Benimo who will be able to cross.\n7:58 Comment: This center is good.\n8:1 Comment: Same, there aren’t many leading players in the Marseille team\n8:5 Comment: to exploit this type of action.\n8:7 Comment: Curzava, Pastorelli.\n8:11 Comment: The rest of this match really depends on what the Parisians want to do with it.\n8:15 Comment: If they want to continue playing at the level they are playing,\n8:19 Comment: It’s not Curzava’s fault after all.\n8:22 Comment: It can be very, very expensive for Marseille.\n8:37 Comment: It’s Pastorelli who’s going to come out.\n8:39 Comment: Draxel who will fail.\n8:44 Comment: Curzava, Ramire Pastorelli.\n8:47 Comment: Levin Curzava, he had an extraordinary match.\n8:49 Comment:  Oh yeah.\n8:50 Comment: Extraordinary, Levin Curzava’s strike.\n8:52 Comment: Johan Pelé who opens again for OM.\n8:54 Comment: The Curzava all the same.\n8:56 Comment: He does a great Pagan action.\n8:58 Comment: But here I think he must center.\n9:0 Comment: I think he gives his team more chances to score by crossing.\n9:3 Comment: And then he’s going to make a great move.\n9:6 Comment: He will score by crossing rather than hitting.\n9:9 Comment: We can afford it at 3-0 Paul.\n9:11 Comment: Yeah, that’s right.\n9:13 Comment: How much is the goal difference between Paris and Monaco?\n9:16 Comment: She’s colossal.\n9:17 Comment: 25 more...\n9:18 Comment: There was a 26-goal difference before this match.\n9:21 Comment: I’ll tell you that precisely.\n9:23 Comment: Monaco was at plus 53.\n9:27 Comment: And Paris at plus 32.\n9:29 Comment: So there were 21 goals.\n9:30 Comment: There are only 18 left.\n9:36 Comment: With Mastorek he would have liked, I think, to continue a little bit.\n9:41 Comment: He delighted Paul.\n9:42 Comment: It’s an incredible match.\n9:43 Comment: For a player who hasn’t been on the team for months and months.\n9:46 Comment: He put in a performance.\n9:48 Comment: It’s true that he wasn’t very bothered by Marseille’s pressure.\n9:51 Comment: But still, what talent.\n9:52 Comment: He was having fun.\n9:53 Comment: We feel that he is disappointed to come out.\n9:59 Comment: There’s Matchagnor.\n10:0 Comment: Wednesday in the Coupe de France.\n10:3 Comment: He has a smile.\n10:5 Comment: Doctor Roland did a good job.\n10:6 Comment: It’s operational.\n10:9 Comment: Lucas.\n10:11 Comment: This time it was Curzava again who arrived and launched.\n10:20 Comment: This ball is good.\n10:22 Comment: He goes from very, very far away.\n10:23 Comment: Remi Cabela.\n10:24 Comment:  The return.\n10:26 Comment: Lopez, Cabela.\n10:31 Comment: Rémi Cabela scored last year against PSG with Lovas.\n10:35 Comment: And there who is taken back.\n10:37 Comment:  It's a shame.\n10:38 Comment: He had started his action well and it was not cut off from the support.\n10:40 Comment: Braxler with Meunier.\n10:42 Comment:  Oh dear.\n10:43 Comment: It was a return of re-reading players.\n10:44 Comment: There are only 10 Parisian players.\n10:46 Comment: So I think it’s a wave that’s coming back.\n10:48 Comment: Lucas.\n10:51 Comment: Lovas Miller.\n10:54 Comment: Lucas Contré center.\n10:56 Comment: By William Vainqueur.\n10:58 Comment: And even if the left-back has changed, the Parisian side’s strategy remains the same.\n11:2 Comment: On the right side we go to the end of the actions.\n11:4 Comment: We force you to defend.\n11:14 Comment: And we wonder every time what they are going to come up with from a set piece.\n11:17 Comment: There are so many possible combinations at Paris Saint-Germain.\n11:20 Comment: There was obviously that of the balls cut at the near post by Cavani or Thiago Silva.\n11:24 Comment: But there are so many others.\n11:25 Comment: The Marseillais chose to leave players in attack.\n11:29 Comment: It’s the second shot.\n11:31 Comment: It’s the second post this time.\n11:32 Comment: It’s Kurzawa.\n11:34 Comment: Without fear of the head.\n11:35 Comment: And it’s captured by Johan Pelé.\n11:38 Comment: It’s systematically the Parisian players who take the advantage.\n11:41 Comment: And the Marseille players are not even in the fight with the Parisian players.\n11:45 Comment: We saw Zambon who completely gave up defending on that corner.\n11:50 Comment: I think that the debrief of the match on the Marseillais side will be aggressive on the Gustave side.\n12:1 Comment: Because there is too much passivity on the side of the Marseille players.\n12:20 Comment: And Loeb who is going to make a bad move because his direct competitors are in the race for 5th place.\n12:27 Comment: We are not talking about Lyon which will undoubtedly move quietly towards this 4th place.\n12:31 Comment: But in 5th place, Bordeaux won.\n12:34 Comment: Choulouse took a point.\n12:36 Comment: And Etienne lost.\n12:41 Comment: Rennes won which could also come back into play for this competition.\n12:46 Comment:  Attention.\n12:47 Comment: On a mathematical level it’s painful to lose tonight.\n12:51 Comment: And then on a psychological level when we lose against Paris like this at home, it leaves its mark.\n12:58 Comment: Yes but to recover, there is Bonaco who is coming in 3 days in the Coupe de France.\n13:3 Comment: At the velodrome.\n13:5 Comment: Sakai, second post, trap.\n13:10 Comment: Attempt behind by Henri Bedino.\n13:13 Comment: That’s still more than daring.\n13:17 Comment: By the way, Kevin Trapp, 13 games with Paris Saint-Germain.\n13:21 Comment: His 13th tonight.\n13:23 Comment: It’s his 11th without conceding a goal so far.\n13:25 Comment: This is the fantastic gesture from Rabia Pastore who brings Kurzawa's pass.\n13:29 Comment: And the exterior finish of Lucas’ foot.\n13:32 Comment: Faster than Benimo, faster than the Marseille defenders.\n13:38 Comment: Like since the start of the match.\n13:40 Comment: How much progress has this Lucas made since his arrival in Paris?\n13:44 Comment: First with the white-gazed pair who spent a lot of time with him.\n13:48 Comment: And now with Unai Emery who has Lucas back in great shape.\n13:53 Comment: Max Lerre.\n13:55 Comment: With Blaise Matuidi, Matuidi’s shot is difficult.\n13:57 Comment: It’s 3 passes, it’s not too serious.\n14:2 Comment: Every Parisian action leads to an opportunity from now on.\n14:5 Comment: Yes there was Max Alain Granel will tell me.\n14:8 Comment: But there have been at least 4 or 5 saves already for Johan Pelé.\n14:14 Comment: There was a 6th Johan Pelé save in this match.\n14:20 Comment: And Samson who is going to return I think.\n14:22 Comment: Corner hit by Lucas.\n14:25 Comment: The 3rd Parisian scorer.\n14:28 Comment: It was towards Lévi-Kurzawa.\n14:30 Comment: Very mobile and very good on kicks.\n14:32 Comment: He’s already scored this year.\n14:33 Comment: Yes, he once again got the upper hand on the Marseille defenders.\n14:36 Comment: So the Marseillais chose to leave 4 players outside the penalty area in the 2nd half.\n14:41 Comment: But they haven't solved the problems yet.\n14:46 Comment: Draxler.\n14:49 Comment: With Thiago Silva.\n14:51 Comment: Marquinhos who opened the debates before Cavani and before Lucas.\n14:54 Comment: The South Americans of PSG in great shape.\n14:57 Comment: Once again this evening the acceleration of Thomas Meunier.\n14:59 Comment: Meunier strong center.\n15:1 Comment: And the 4th goal is for Julian Draxler.\n15:4 Comment: 4-0 at the hour mark for Paris Saint-Germain.\n15:7 Comment: A promise from France.\n15:10 Comment: And for PSG a walk in the park on the OM pitch.\n15:14 Comment: If you don’t defend it’s not worth it.\n15:19 Comment: Congratulations to PSG’s strategy.\n15:21 Comment: Because we said so in the first half.\n15:23 Comment: Systematically on the right they chose to accelerate and hit.\n15:27 Comment: The Meunier on her first touch.\n15:29 Comment: He accelerates and leaves Payet behind.\n15:31 Comment:  We see it.\n15:32 Comment:  A key.\n15:34 Comment: Two touches.\n15:35 Comment: He’s speeding up.\n15:36 Comment: He’s overtaking Payet.\n15:37 Comment:  A center.\n15:38 Comment:  Perfect.\n15:40 Comment: And Draxler.\n15:41 Comment: 11th match with PSG.\n15:42 Comment: 6th goal for the German.\n15:44 Comment: He must have touched 3 balls so far.\n15:47 Comment: And then he moves Paul in his hallway.\n15:49 Comment: But why doesn’t the left back stay on the left?\n15:51 Comment: I understand.\n15:53 Comment: He goes inside every time.\n15:55 Comment: All you have to do is eliminate your attacker and you will cross the stadium.\n15:59 Comment: It seems weird though.\n16:1 Comment: They are overwhelmed.\n16:2 Comment: The Marseillais Pagas have not been there at all since the start of this match.\n16:4 Comment:  Of course.\n16:5 Comment: 4-0.\n16:6 Comment: There are some basics all the same.\n16:7 Comment: There are basics.\n16:8 Comment:  Never.\n16:9 Comment: And he won by more than 3 goals on the Marseille pitch.\n16:12 Comment: It’s a historic victory so far for the Parisians.\n16:16 Comment: And the historic victory of PSG if we consider home match, away match,\n16:21 Comment: It's 5-1 in '78.\n16:25 Comment: So here we are.\n16:26 Comment:  Here we are.\n16:27 Comment:  Look.\n16:28 Comment: He keeps getting the balls.\n16:29 Comment: He continues to bring intensity.\n16:31 Comment: He’s having such a great time Paul.\n16:32 Comment: He’s having so much fun.\n16:33 Comment:  Of course.\n16:34 Comment: That’s what I was saying earlier.\n16:35 Comment: We feel the collective pleasure of playing together.\n16:38 Comment: And there are several elements.\n16:39 Comment: It’s because it’s Marseille.\n16:40 Comment: It’s because they had the week to recover well.\n16:44 Comment: And because they have fun together.\n16:47 Comment: A colossal pleasure.\n16:48 Comment: The Parisians who respond to the wishes of their supporters, who urged them yesterday\n16:52 Comment:  by accompanying them to Le Bourget to catch their plane.\n16:55 Comment: There was a banner.\n16:56 Comment: Crush them.\n16:57 Comment: The mission is accomplished.\n16:58 Comment:  They're doing it.\n17:0 Comment: 4-0 for PSG at the hour mark on the OM pitch.\n17:6 Comment: Sakai.\n17:11 Comment: Heel of Maxime Lopez.\n17:21 Comment: The same one that sinks.\n17:23 Comment: You saw the faces earlier of Samson, Engy on the bench.\n17:27 Comment: Totally overwhelmed.\n17:36 Comment: In any case, we must not take refuge behind the referee's decisions.\n17:39 Comment: When there are so many gaps, it’s useless.\n17:43 Comment: The Canal sports boss is, like all of us, under the taste of emotion.\n17:50 Comment: Look at Kurzawa’s tumble.\n17:52 Comment: Kurzawa, Cavani.\n17:54 Comment: Cavani who is taken over by the winner.\n17:57 Comment: Perhaps one of the rare victorious Marseillais to stand out a little bit this evening.\n18:6 Comment: Benimaud.\n18:9 Comment: Fanny.\n18:11 Comment: Sakai.\n18:21 Comment: The Parisians continue to work defensively.\n18:23 Comment: They apply together.\n18:27 Comment: It really is a spirit.\n18:28 Comment: This ball is good, this ball is good.\n18:29 Comment: Camelot Station.\n18:32 Comment: You are right, Pagard.\n18:33 Comment: I think they usually have that spirit.\n18:36 Comment: And tonight even more.\n18:38 Comment: Again because there is this Marseille-PSG rivalry.\n18:43 Comment: Also because they were able to recover it well.\n18:49 Comment: It’s the first time since September, Paul, that PSG had a full week.\n18:53 Comment: Well, since August itself.\n18:54 Comment: Since the week before the match in Monaco, PSG had a full week to prepare for a match.\n19:1 Comment: They had two days off.\n19:2 Comment: They were able to follow it up with a full week of work.\n19:6 Comment: And then the match against Barcelona put these boys in another orbit.\n19:14 Comment: Draxler.\n19:15 Comment: Draxler, the center in the background, he’s perfect.\n19:18 Comment: Girodaval did not exploit it as he could have.\n19:20 Comment: Draxler's accent was perfect, but the players' movements in the box were not great.\n19:31 Comment: The OM supporter who wakes up, who tries to encourage theirs to urge them not to completely break away.\n19:49 Comment: Great ball.\n19:50 Comment: Remi Cabela.\n19:53 Comment: With Maxime Lopez, Dimitri Payet.\n19:57 Comment: Cavani, Thomas Meunier.\n19:58 Comment: The shot that slipped.\n20:0 Comment: Trap help him.\n20:6 Comment: Not sure he’ll come back.\n20:10 Comment: Four tough Parisian goals against the South American.\n20:12 Comment: The South Americans who scored 41, I think, of the 53 Parisian goals.\n20:18 Comment: It’s colossal.\n20:28 Comment: There are no second-tier players.\n20:31 Comment: What a scoundrel.\n20:33 Comment: Thauvin.\n20:38 Comment: Lopez.\n20:41 Comment: Florian Thauvin.\n20:42 Comment: How well defended.\n20:43 Comment: And by Draxler.\n20:45 Comment: Audier Fazon, Dessien, he got into this match well.\n20:47 Comment: Obviously, Julian Draxler, he gets a free kick.\n20:50 Comment: It would be interesting to show this way of defending.\n20:52 Comment: He felt he could come and defend Thauvin.\n20:57 Comment: Florian Thauvin, he let go of his left side to recover this ball.\n21:5 Comment: Third change for Rudi Garcia.\n21:9 Comment: After Benimo, after Cabella, it’s Sertic who returns in place of Florian Thauvin.\n21:14 Comment: I don’t even know where he’s going to put me.\n21:17 Comment: Maybe he’ll move to three at the back.\n21:21 Comment: He knows, Rudi Garcia, that we must avoid taking others.\n21:27 Comment: The OM supporters are extinct, obviously.\n21:35 Comment: Even if in the turns, we woke up a little.\n21:37 Comment: There are two or three groups who returned to the fields.\n21:43 Comment: Sertic who puts himself between Fanny and Rolando.\n21:46 Comment: It was complicated, Paul, to imagine Marseille beating Paris above all, very clearly.\n21:50 Comment: We talked about it all day together.\n21:52 Comment: But such a demonstration was not necessarily envisaged either.\n21:56 Comment: That’s it.\n21:57 Comment: Cavani who is very close to taking the fifth.\n21:59 Comment: It’s going to be picked up by Lucas.\n22:1 Comment: There’s still about half an hour left.\n22:2 Comment: There are 25 minutes left.\n22:3 Comment: That’s a long time.\n22:5 Comment: It’s a long time for Marseille.\n22:6 Comment: That’s a long time.\n22:7 Comment: If the Parisians don’t relax, it’s going to be a very, very long time.\n22:9 Comment: I don’t believe they intend to release.\n22:13 Comment: They want to offer their supporters a historic success.\n22:15 Comment: In Marseille, he is for the moment.\n22:17 Comment: Paris has never won by four goals on the OM pitch.\n22:21 Comment: In mastery, they are good.\n22:26 Comment: Rabiot.\n22:28 Comment: Marquinhos.\n22:30 Comment: Braxler.\n22:31 Comment: With Marquinhos.\n22:33 Comment: Cavani.\n22:35 Comment: He could have given the ball to Braxler.\n22:37 Comment: He’s going to hit the insane Cavani.\n22:38 Comment:  Why not ?\n22:40 Comment: He was almost 30 meters away.\n22:41 Comment: He must have left it in my opinion.\n22:44 Comment: He doesn’t go that far.\n22:45 Comment: If it falls again, you’re right.\n22:49 Comment: His attitude does not suggest that they want to relax.\n22:56 Comment: Le Pessac.\n22:57 Comment: Sakai and Bédimo play very, very beautifully.\n22:59 Comment: You tell me 3 behind.\n23:2 Comment: Payet.\n23:3 Comment: Bédimo’s call.\n23:5 Comment: This ball from Dimitri Payet is good.\n23:7 Comment: For Henri Bédimo.\n23:8 Comment: Tightened by Thomas Meunier.\n23:11 Comment: Strike shot held by Henri Bédimo.\n23:13 Comment: We find the diagram that Garcia had used\n23:16 Comment: when he came to the park.\n23:18 Comment: Miss the 0-0.\n23:21 Comment: They must have thought about playing like that at some point.\n23:26 Comment: Afterwards, we can’t either.\n23:29 Comment: wish him to reproduce this pattern.\n23:32 Comment: But it must be noted that against Paris,\n23:35 Comment: It's better to keep it very, very low profile at the moment.\n23:42 Comment: Barça is a fourth grade.\n23:45 Comment: I have a low profile, no problem.\n23:46 Comment: Yes, that’s what I’m telling you.\n23:48 Comment: You can tell yourself that it’s heavy in your face.\n23:49 Comment: Come on, Payet.\n23:52 Comment: Payet on the free kick.\n23:54 Comment: Dimitri Payet.\n23:56 Comment: Trappes again.\n23:57 Comment: The attempt behind and the volley.\n23:59 Comment:  And the goal !\n24:0 Comment: The goal for Rod Fanny.\n24:2 Comment: The old one, the one who played for Marseille\n24:5 Comment: the greatest number of classics.\n24:7 Comment: Which makes the pill a little less bitter for now.\n24:10 Comment: 4 goals to 1 for PSG.\n24:15 Comment:  Trappes which does not resell enough.\n24:17 Comment: Lopez who puts this ball back full axis.\n24:26 Comment: Fanny’s re-sequence isn’t so easy to put on.\n24:31 Comment: There is Grossi-Vaque who would have liked to finish this match without losing a goal.\n24:35 Comment: Yes, Emry too.\n24:38 Comment: He's playing his 10th classic this evening, Rod Fanny.\n24:43 Comment: He had only won one so far, it was the first.\n24:46 Comment: At the time when Didier Deschamps was the OM coach.\n24:51 Comment: Last OM coach to beat PSG, Didier Deschamps.\n24:56 Comment: Some have followed one another since then on the Olympian bench.\n25:3 Comment: It woke up the velodrome.\n25:12 Comment: Fanny, Sakai.\n25:23 Comment: Zambon-Nissa, Rod Fanny.\n25:26 Comment: It was OM’s first shot on target in this match.\n25:28 Comment: We obviously remember the sad results of the first leg where there were zero shots.\n25:31 Comment: No shots on target, zero shots in the match.\n25:42 Comment: Lopez with the rise of Sakai.\n25:46 Comment: No solution in the axis, so he delays Sakai.\n25:50 Comment: With Payet.\n25:56 Comment: This center is good.\n26:1 Comment: It’s captured by Kurzawa.\n26:3 Comment: This goal did the Marseillais good.\n26:10 Comment: Interception by Thomas Meunier on Payet’s crossbar.\n26:14 Comment: Thomas Meunier with Verratti.\n26:17 Comment: There is a solution on the right, he chooses Cavani.\n26:19 Comment: Cavani who could extend it for Draxler. That’s done.\n26:22 Comment: He’s not choosing the right Verratti at the moment.\n26:25 Comment: It was the other side of the game. Verratti with Lucas.\n26:28 Comment: Lucas’ shot, Pelé’s save.\n26:30 Comment: New stop of 1-Pelé.\n26:33 Comment: Maxim Lopez.\n26:36 Comment: Winner.\n26:39 Comment: There is Lucas who is going to fight Draxler.\n26:40 Comment: Leguimo who loses the ball.\n26:42 Comment: Lucas.\n26:43 Comment:  He went out.\n26:47 Comment: Lucas for Vercoe-Verratti.\n26:49 Comment: It happens from a distance.\n26:50 Comment: Verratti who relies on Draxler.\n26:52 Comment: Vercoe-Verratti for Blaise Matuidi.\n26:53 Comment: And what a goal from Blaise Matuidi.\n26:55 Comment: Used to scoring on this pitch, Blaise Matuidi.\n26:58 Comment: Full corner. 5 goals to 1 for PSG.\n27:3 Comment: A fantastic new collective action on the Parisian side\n27:5 Comment:  with a Verratti-Draxler sequence in the surface.\n27:9 Comment: A magnificent 1-2.\n27:11 Comment: There Verratti will rely on Draxler.\n27:13 Comment: That puts him back in the race.\n27:15 Comment: And then he drops a great ball for Matuidi’s first left.\n27:19 Comment: Here again you have to know your partner well.\n27:22 Comment: Knowing that Matuidi will be able to continue on his left foot.\n27:26 Comment:  It's perfect.\n27:27 Comment: It’s a perfect ball for a quick one-touch move.\n27:31 Comment: Matuidi who scored on this pitch in the famous 3-2.\n27:34 Comment: There we were talking about.\n27:35 Comment: The record of influence already.\n27:37 Comment: And who also scored in the final of the Coupe de France\n27:39 Comment: without going against OM.\n27:41 Comment: And strangely Matuidi had

    "summary": "In a highly anticipated encounter at the Stade Vélodrome, Paris Saint-Germain clashed with Olympique de Marseille in what turned out to be an emphatic display of dominance by the Parisians. The game commenced under a feverish atmosphere, with the record attendance for an OM-PSG match from April 2015 being broken, resulting in a packed stadium filled with fervent supporters.\n\nThe match kicked off with PSG showing immediate aggression and control over the proceedings. Despite making several changes to their lineup, notably Pastoré replacing Draxler on the left wing, PSG commenced with their typical attacking flair. Early indications of PSG's tactical astuteness were evident as they kept Marseille under pressure right from the kickoff.\n\nIn the 7th minute, Paris Saint-Germain took the lead through Marquinhos. The set-piece routine that led to the goal was a testament to their rehearsed efficiency. Marco Verratti delivered a pinpoint ball to captain Thiago Silva, who then directed a header back into the path of Marquinhos. Marquinhos made no mistake in converting the opportunity, leaving the Marseille defense, particularly new signings Payet and Evra, floundering. \n\nMarseille, trying to find their rhythm, saw a few individual flashes but struggled to collectively break down a compact PSG defense. Thauvin attempted a long-range shot which did not trouble the PSG goalkeeper, Trapp. Maxime Lopez and the rest of the midfield appeared flustered as Rabiot, Pastoré, and Matuidi exerted immense pressure, cutting off passing lanes and retaining ball possession effectively.\n\nPSG continued their offensive onslaught, and their relentless approach bore fruit again in the 16th minute. Adrien Rabiot fed a sublime pass to Marco Verratti, who then threaded the ball to Javier Pastore. Exhibiting a telepathic understanding, Pastore delivered a beautifully disguised pass to Edinson Cavani, who timed his run to perfection and slotted home PSG's second goal of the night. The move, which originated from deep within their half, demonstrated PSG's fluidity and attacking prowess.\n\nMarseille tried to respond, focusing on their pressing game, but PSG's composure and technical superiority made it difficult for the hosts. PSG's counters continued to stifle Marseille’s attempts at building any kind of sustained attack. Kurzawa and Meunier frequently pushed up the flanks, pressing in tandem with Paris’ forwards and midfield. \n\nIn the second half, Rudi Garcia made a tactical switch, substituting Evra for Henri Bédimo, hoping to bolster their defense. However, PSG’s dominance was unyielding. Within just four minutes of the restart, PSG stretched their lead to 3-0. A misplaced pass from Rod Fanni was capitalized on by Pastore, who swiftly passed to Kurzawa. Kurzawa's cross found Lucas, who neatly finished to record his 15th goal of the season, evidencing his integral role in PSG's attack despite frequent rotation.\n\nMarseille struggled to catch a break, and upon the 60-minute mark, PSG netted their fourth. The right flank, orchestrated by the consistent performance of Meunier, was a constant threat. A swift exchange led to Meunier outpacing Payet and delivering a pristine cross which Julian Draxler met with a precise finish. Draxler, playing his first game for PSG, showcased his instinctive play and fit seamlessly into the Parisian attack.\n\nDespite being four goals down, Marseille showed glimpses of resilience. The introduction of Rémi Cabella brought fresh legs and a hint of creativity. Rod Fanni managed to pull one back for Marseille, capitalizing on a rebound from a Payet free-kick, volleying in from close range. Though scant consolation, it brought a momentary revival of spirit among the home supporters.\n\nHowever, PSG’s response was swift and decisive. Moments later, Marco Verratti and Julian Draxler combined once again, culminating in a superb team effort finished off by Blaise Matuidi for his first Ligue 1 goal of the season. This restored the four-goal buffer and effectively quashed any fleeting hopes for Marseille.\n\nThroughout the final quarter of the match, PSG controlled possession and sought to further embarrass their rivals. Players like Hatem Ben Arfa and Angel Di Maria were introduced, maintaining the high tempo and attacking threats. PSG's defense, led by Thiago Silva and Marquinhos, remained impenetrable while their midfield continued to hustle and dictate the pace. Bédimo and Sakai's overlaps were neutralized effectively by PSG’s wide players and their coordinated defensive stance.\n\nThe final whistle sealed a 5-1 victory for Paris Saint-Germain, marking a historic moment, as this win became their most significant victory over Marseille at the Vélodrome. This match underscored PSG's technical superiority and strategic adeptness, concurrently highlighting the gulf in class between the two sides. The lack of defensive cohesion and gaps in the Marseille structure were brutally exposed by the Parisians.\n\nThiago Silva’s leadership was palpable, both defensively and offensively, alongside Marquinhos' crucial contributions. Verratti's midfield orchestration and the attacking quartet's clinical nature laid bare PSG's dominance. Each goal was a masterclass in movement, vision, and precision, reflecting Emery's tactical blueprint and the squad’s execution. The win solidified PSG’s position in the league and sent a strong message to title rivals, showcasing their unswerving intent and capabilities.\n\nFor Marseille, the match leaves much to ponder, as the defensive frailties and inability to cope with high-press and transitions were glaring. Rudi Garcia’s task ahead appears monumental as the gap between Marseille and the league’s elite clubs seems gargantuan. Rebuilding and strengthening the squad, particularly the defensive unit, will be crucial for Marseille if they aim to compete and achieve their lofty aspirations.\n\nIn conclusion, the match was a stark reminder of PSG's invincibility in domestic competitions, showcased by an all-around team performance that outclassed their arch-rivals comprehensively. The Vélodrome bore witness to a Paris Saint-Germain masterclass, a vivid display of their ambitions and the profound quality that courses through their squad."
