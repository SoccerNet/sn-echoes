    "summary": "On a dramatic afternoon at San Siro, AC Milan narrowly edged out Crotone 2-1 in what was an eventful and gripping encounter. The match began with a spark of excitement straight from the kick-off. Crotone, showing early intent, surprised everyone with a shot on target within the first 24 seconds, which was energetically dealt with by the Milan defense, resulting in the ball going out of play.\n\nAC Milan was quick to regain control. A foul by AC Milan at 02:05 prompted an indirect free-kick by Crotone, which AC Milan's defenders cleared with solid precision shortly after. The early exchanges were a bit scrappy, evident from multiple throw-ins and clearances. AC Milan attempted to assert their dominance, seeing a shot off target in the third minute, showcasing their attacking ambition.\n\nAs the game progressed, both teams dug in fiercely with chances appearing on both ends. AC Milan saw an early corner by the fifth minute, raising the home crowd's hopes only to see Gianluigi Donnarumma making a couple of crucial saves from Crotone’s attacking moves. Donnarumma's first save came after an 11th-minute effort by Marcello Trotta from Crotone. A few moments later, there was a rather artistic team-play by AC Milan, moving fluidly with a series of short passes which exemplified their patience in breaking Crotone's defence.\n\nDespite early onslaughts, Crotone’s solid defensive structure held firm, and they finally found their rhythm. Their persistence paid off in the 26th minute when Diego Falcinelli, benefiting from a clever assist by Marcus Rohden, found the back of the net with his close-range shot. This put Crotone 1-0 ahead, sending shockwaves through the Milan faithful.\n\nThe response from AC Milan was immediate and forceful. They pushed hard for an equalizer, engaging in attacking plays that kept Crotone’s defense on high alert. Jose Sosa and Mattia De Sciglio stood out with their vigorous and probing attempts. However, the attempts were thwarted either by poor finishing or disciplined defending from the away side.\n\nAt the 40th-minute mark, AC Milan’s persistence bore fruit. Mario Pasalic latched onto a delightful pass inside the box and meticulously slotted the ball past the Crotone goalkeeper, Alex Cordaz. This brought the scoreline level, 1-1, just minutes before the halftime break.\n\nThe first half concluded with a notable yellow card for Aleandro Rosi from Crotone, reflecting the physical intensity of the encounter, as well as a series of promising but ultimately unconverted attacking plays by both sides. It was a half dominated by AC Milan’s controlled gameplay and Crotone’s swift counter-attacking football.\n\nThe second half commenced with AC Milan on the kick-off. Within moments, fouls and yellow cards marked the early proceedings as the players from both teams seemed fired up to tilt the match in their favor. AC Milan's aggressiveness, unfortunately, got the better of them as Manuel Locatelli was booked for a foul around the 4th minute. \n\nMoments of tension unfolded when AC Milan was awarded a penalty kick around the 7th minute. M'Baye Niang stepped up to take the shot, only to see his attempt for the top left corner skillfully saved by Alex Cordaz. This save exhibited Cordaz’s quality and kept Crotone's hopes alive. Niang’s missed penalty was a huge let-off for Crotone and spurred them to tighten their defense even more.\n\nThe game saw continuous back-and-forth action. Despite AC Milan's efforts to step up the tempo and continuously apply pressure, Crotone stood resilient. Several substitutions were made by both teams to add fresh legs to manage the blistering pace of the game.\n\nOne notable incident was the disallowed goal by AC Milan's Gianluca Lapadula, who found the back of the net only to have it ruled out by the referee for a prior foul. This decision was contentious and momentarily dampened Milan’s spirit. However, Lapadula remained pivotal for Milan’s forward momentum.\n\nCrotone’s Raffaele Palladino came on around the 25-minute mark of the second half as Adrian Stoian made way, and a few minutes later, Mario Sampirisi replaced Bruno Martella - reflective of Crotone’s intent to solidify their lineup and possibly snatch another goal through a counter-attack.\n\nThe home side however, benefited from persistence and tactical adjustments by their coach Vincenzo Montella. He brought in Luiz Adriano to replace Jose Sosa, with hopes to break the deadlock. The midfield dynamics shifted, enhancing AC Milan's forward thrust.\n\nThe moment of glory for AC Milan came around the 40th minute of the second half. Off a free-kick, Keisuke Honda lofted a ball into the penalty area, and the subsequent rebound fell to Gianluca Lapadula. He swiftly controlled the ball and sent it steaming into the net, securing a 2-1 lead for AC Milan. The San Siro erupted in celebration, a deserved reward for their relentless pursuit of victory.\n\nDespite a frenetic finish where Crotone tried to rally back, including substitutions made to inject pace and aggression with Simy coming on for Marcus Rohden, they couldn’t break through Milan's reinvigorated defense. Crotone’s commitment was defined by four yellow cards administered during the match, highlighting their aggressive eagerness to disrupt Milan’s control, but this very aggression culminated in their downfall.\n\nIn the dying moments, AC Milan's Juraj Kucka also came on to replace the goal scorer Lapadula, ensuring a secure defensive stance to maintain their slender lead. The foul-filled finish saw the referee issue several more yellow cards, keeping both teams on edge.\n\nAs the final whistle blew, AC Milan had completed a hard-fought comeback to seal a 2-1 victory against a determined Crotone side. Gianluca Lapadula’s crucial goal underscored AC Milan's superiority in terms of possession and chances created through sustained pressure and tactical play. In contrast, Crotone's strategy of fast counter-attacks nearly paid dividends but ultimately, they fell short. It was a match characterized by intensity, drama, missed opportunities, and disciplined defensive work — leaving the fans reflecting on a memorable contest."
