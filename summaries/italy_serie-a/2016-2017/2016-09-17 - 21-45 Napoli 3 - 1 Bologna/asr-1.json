    "input": "\n    Napoli 3 - 1 Bologna\n\nFirst Half:\n\n0:30 Comment: on the right flank, right inside.\n0:32 Comment: Number 24 Varenzo Insigne plays on the left.\n0:35 Comment: Accordingly, he also plays in the attack group.\n0:39 Comment: Today's striker number 23 is Italian Manolo Gabiedini.\n0:44 Comment: This is the composition of Napoleon, team coach Maurizo Sari.\n0:47 Comment: And we note that there are a lot of changes in the lineup for Napoleon.\n0:51 Comment: This, I repeat, is rare with Sarah.\n0:53 Comment: Yes, we note that Arkady Ushmelik is on the bench today.\n0:56 Comment: Glam remained on the bench.\n0:58 Comment: Ivan Strini plays instead.\n0:59 Comment: Mitch, also Allan in reserve.\n1:3 Comment: A very important player for Napoleon.\n1:4 Comment: Yes, today it was Peter Zelinsky who started the team.\n1:8 Comment: Well, who else can be named on the bench?\n1:12 Comment: Dries Mertons.\n1:13 Comment: But he doesn’t always appear at the start.\n1:15 Comment: But despite all this, Mertons played an important role in Naples.\n1:19 Comment: By the way, in the first round he saved Napoles from defeat in Piscara by scoring a double.\n1:23 Comment: So, of course, he is in good shape now.\n1:26 Comment: It is a risk for Sari not to include him in the lineup.\n1:29 Comment: For this meeting.\n1:30 Comment: Napoleon is on the attack.\n1:31 Comment: Marie Hamsik plays Jorginho.\n1:33 Comment: The Brazilian Italian makes a back pass.\n1:36 Comment: Napoleon has good ball control.\n1:37 Comment: It is clear that Bolonia is a team that knows how to defend.\n1:40 Comment: Probably, Bolonia had already come to terms with the fact that they would have less possession of the ball even before the match.\n1:45 Comment: Bolonia today, by the way, also has a suboptimal composition.\n1:49 Comment: Because Bolonia does not have Mattio Destro playing due to back pain.\n1:53 Comment: After a severe bruise.\n1:55 Comment: And the medical staff of Bolonia decided not to risk it.\n1:58 Comment: Destro stayed at home.\n1:59 Comment: Midfielder Viviani will also not play.\n2:1 Comment: He has a hip bruise.\n2:3 Comment: No due to the striker's injury in the locker.\n2:7 Comment: But he hasn’t played a single game yet.\n2:9 Comment: And this season for Bolonia.\n2:11 Comment: Napoleon is attacking.\n2:12 Comment: Incini kick on goal.\n2:14 Comment: His favorite maneuver.\n2:16 Comment: That's what we just saw.\n2:17 Comment: Incini received the ball on the left flank.\n2:19 Comment: It began to shift to the center.\n2:20 Comment: I tried to beat my opponent and shoot.\n2:22 Comment: Everything was, as always, on a whim.\n2:24 Comment: But here the blow did not work for Incini.\n2:27 Comment: He usually shoots into the far top corner.\n2:28 Comment: But now it struck weakly.\n2:31 Comment: Even almost past the gate.\n2:33 Comment: But the keeper gave it to the bone.\n2:34 Comment: So, just to be safe, I fixed the ball.\n2:36 Comment: Well, I’ll also note that Mar Sadiq won’t be there today.\n2:38 Comment: Another Bolonia player.\n2:41 Comment: Forward, who is on loan from Roma.\n2:44 Comment: A young player who showed his talent at Roma today.\n2:47 Comment: Well, Roma has quite a lot of players under contract.\n2:51 Comment: And that’s why Roma loan out many of them to small clubs.\n2:55 Comment: Although Bolonia, you know, the club is not that small.\n2:58 Comment: Quite an ambitious club from a big Italian city.\n3:1 Comment: And a club that aims to return to the elite of Italian football in the coming years.\n3:7 Comment: While Bolonia is on the attack.\n3:8 Comment: There is a chance to threaten Pepperane's goal.\n3:14 Comment: Serve, free kick.\n3:16 Comment: In the end, Pepperine copes with this blow with great difficulty, with gigantic difficulty.\n3:21 Comment: We saw the first dangerous moment.\n3:23 Comment: We saw him at the owners' gate.\n3:24 Comment: Bolonia had a good attack, a wide one.\n3:27 Comment: Main.\n3:28 Comment: This attack ended with a final blow.\n3:32 Comment: The turn, the blow, is very dangerous.\n3:34 Comment: And, of course, the Spanish goalkeeper of the Neapolitans is magnificent.\n3:38 Comment: Verdi with the ball.\n3:39 Comment: Delivery to the far post.\n3:41 Comment: And he is wrong.\n3:43 Comment: Number nine Simone Verdi.\n3:45 Comment: Today he replaces Destro in the lineup, which Igor has already mentioned.\n3:49 Comment: Simone Verdi is young.\n3:50 Comment: Forward.\n3:52 Comment: He is 24 years old.\n3:56 Comment: Wears number nine.\n3:58 Comment: This means that some hopes are apparently pinned on him.\n4:2 Comment: Simone Verdi, he played in different teams.\n4:5 Comment: Again, he was on loan.\n4:7 Comment: Now let's see how he performs in Bolonia.\n4:10 Comment: Pepe Reina brings the ball into play.\n4:12 Comment: Here the fight is in the center of the field.\n4:14 Comment: Once again Bolonia took possession of the ball.\n4:17 Comment: Transfer back.\n4:18 Comment: Coulibaly.\n4:20 Comment: Plays Nastrinjic.\n4:22 Comment: Coulibaly again.\n4:23 Comment: Here you have to play through the goalkeeper, through Pepe Reina.\n4:27 Comment: Spaniard with the ball.\n4:28 Comment: Transfer to your compatriot.\n4:31 Comment: Albioli.\n4:35 Comment: They meet Kalihon.\n4:36 Comment: Sir, two football players.\n4:37 Comment: And breaking the rules.\n4:39 Comment: This is Safir Taider.\n4:41 Comment: In my opinion, number eight was praised.\n4:44 Comment: No, Tarasidis, if I'm not mistaken.\n4:46 Comment: This is Vasilis Tarasidis.\n4:47 Comment: Again, ex-footballer Rome.\n4:53 Comment: He found himself in the center of the field, although he is nominally a left-back.\n4:56 Comment: Which is interesting.\n4:58 Comment: And so, Coulibaly named after him.\n5:2 Comment: Passes to Koulibaly.\n5:3 Comment: Played with Gamshik.\n5:4 Comment: And the Neapolitans still have the ball.\n5:9 Comment: Loss in the center of the field.\n5:10 Comment: But here are the Alverdi from Bolonia.\n5:11 Comment: It could turn out to be a very dangerous attack for Napoli.\n5:15 Comment: Insigne.\n5:17 Comment: What will it do?\n5:18 Comment: Moves the ball under his right.\n5:19 Comment: But this pass doesn’t go through the penalty area.\n5:24 Comment: Nigra had a position here.\n5:25 Comment: Hamshik was already coming out of the offside position.\n5:27 Comment: And therefore...\n5:28 Comment: Goal kick.\n5:33 Comment: Napoli have a busy schedule.\n5:35 Comment: We have already said this.\n5:36 Comment: The Champions League match was on Tuesday against Dynamo Kyiv.\n5:40 Comment: But, by the way, it was a match that left the most pleasant impressions.\n5:43 Comment: I think Napoli won 2-1 for the whole team.\n5:49 Comment: Napoli earned their first points in a very even group.\n5:52 Comment: In addition to Dynamo Kyiv, there are others in this quartet.\n5:58 Comment: If I'm not mistaken, Besiktas and Benfica.\n6:3 Comment: Four teams that will compete for two spots in the Champions League playoffs.\n6:7 Comment: Well, Napoli, of course, is one of the main goals for this fall.\n6:10 Comment: Of course, qualify for the Champions League playoffs.\n6:12 Comment: But this will be a very important stage in the career, of course, for head coach Maurizo Sarri.\n6:20 Comment: A coach who at one time began working in the seventh Italian division.\n6:25 Comment: And rose to Serie A.\n6:27 Comment: And here he is in Napoli.\n6:28 Comment: And they began to trust.\n6:30 Comment: Let's talk about the fact that Maurizo Sarri was previously involved in other things.\n6:35 Comment: He was an ordinary clerk in a bank.\n6:36 Comment: Yes, he's a banker.\n6:38 Comment: Not even a banker, but a clerk.\n6:39 Comment: Yes, I worked in a bank.\n6:41 Comment: But around the age of 35, I realized that his whole life was in football.\n6:46 Comment: That he absolutely loves this game.\n6:48 Comment: And he has a deep understanding of it as a tactician.\n6:51 Comment: And then, accordingly, his career began.\n6:53 Comment: Igor is right.\n6:54 Comment: I started almost with amateur teams.\n6:57 Comment: Well, a real breakthrough.\n6:58 Comment: After that, it happened when he began working with the Empoli team.\n7:1 Comment: This was a couple of years ago.\n7:3 Comment: And then, accordingly, success in Naples.\n7:6 Comment: Last year in Naples a third of the championship was the leader.\n7:10 Comment: Was the main contender for the Scudetto.\n7:13 Comment: And only after losing to Juventus in a head-to-head match, Napoli essentially dropped out of the race.\n7:20 Comment: Well, from a psychological point of view, first of all, in my opinion.\n7:22 Comment: Gorihon, pass back.\n7:24 Comment: Well, here it’s probably worth mentioning Aurelio de Laurentiis.\n7:28 Comment: That is, he trusted Sari, because not every manager will trust a coach who has only worked in the series for a year.\n7:36 Comment: The Neapolitans of Callajo are in attack.\n7:38 Comment: But the shot from the left and the shot on target is not very dangerous.\n7:43 Comment: Frankly speaking, Angelo D'Acosta chose the right position and calmly absorbed the blow.\n7:49 Comment: And with the second movement he takes the ball into his hands.\n7:52 Comment: Gastalde Alan.\n7:54 Comment: Experienced footballer.\n7:56 Comment: Pass across the field.\n7:58 Comment: Balloony with a ball.\n8:5 Comment: Pass to touch, but this pass does not go through.\n8:8 Comment: The Neapolitans intercepted the ball.\n8:10 Comment: Coulibaly.\n8:13 Comment: Not bad so far.\n8:15 Comment: Doesn't keep the ball. No, Hamshik did not save the ball.\n8:18 Comment: Everything was so thin.\n8:19 Comment: Naples players played with one touch.\n8:21 Comment: This is already a powerful Coulibaly.\n8:24 Comment: At first, when he first moved over, of course, people in Italy laughed at him.\n8:28 Comment: But eventually this summer, after Koulibaly played in the series and worked with Maurizio Sari,\n8:34 Comment: This summer, Chelsea already offered 50 million euros for the Naples defender.\n8:40 Comment: Hysaj connects on the flank.\n8:42 Comment: The Albanian serves.\n8:44 Comment: But no, this is, of course, not the most successful presentation.\n8:48 Comment: However, they kept the ball.\n8:50 Comment: Now the out will be in favor of the Neapolitans.\n8:53 Comment: And they will continue their attack.\n8:54 Comment: Hysaj himself will dribble the ball from the sideline.\n8:58 Comment: How is this generally accepted in modern football.\n9:0 Comment: Yes, mostly full-backs carry the ball into the game and into the hall.\n9:3 Comment: Places the body of Toro Sidis.\n9:6 Comment: And he calmly carries the ball out of the field.\n9:10 Comment: Almost 10 minutes behind.\n9:13 Comment: Beggar 0-0 in the Napoli-Bologna match.\n9:16 Comment: Yes, there was also a safi.\n9:18 Comment: Everything else from Hysai in this episode.\n9:23 Comment: The main question, probably, of this season was,\n9:26 Comment: how Napoleon will play without Gansau.\n9:28 Comment: Dansalo Higuaino, who, in general, is not exactly a big scandal,\n9:32 Comment: but didn't leave the team very well.\n9:35 Comment: Well, I would even call it a scandal, because there were so many conversations,\n9:38 Comment: and they still exist.\n9:40 Comment: And, of course, all of Italy is waiting for the arrival of Danzalo Higuaino in Naples\n9:43 Comment: for a match against his future team.\n9:47 Comment: But now it seems like, let’s fix it.\n9:49 Comment: Danzalo Higuaino receives Safir Tider's number eight.\n9:53 Comment: Full in the center of the field.\n9:55 Comment: Well, the distance is quite good for Naples.\n9:58 Comment: And the first yellow card in our game.\n10:5 Comment: Well, regarding Danzalo Higuaino, even Sari in one of the interviews, yes,\n10:9 Comment: said that he was somewhat offended by Dansalo because he didn’t even call.\n10:14 Comment: Yes, and didn’t say goodbye.\n10:15 Comment: Well, we will continue the topic of Higuaino.\n10:17 Comment: Not even Higuaino, but Napoleon in attack after this set-piece.\n10:21 Comment: 33 meters to the gate.\n10:22 Comment: Jorginho is on the ball.\n10:25 Comment: Will the enemy strike?\n10:26 Comment: More likely to serve.\n10:28 Comment: Into the penalty area.\n10:29 Comment: There is a powerful Curibali there.\n10:30 Comment: There is also Biedini's Monologue.\n10:32 Comment: Jose Maria Calijon.\n10:33 Comment: Mare Hamshik.\n10:33 Comment: Albiol.\n10:34 Comment: That is, all the people who can play with their heads.\n10:36 Comment: Plus Lorenzo Insini is on the rebound.\n10:39 Comment: No, Lorenzo Incini ran into the penalty area.\n10:41 Comment: And the ball was handed to Angelo D'Acosti.\n10:44 Comment: Well, so, regarding the Napoli attack.\n10:46 Comment: Yes, you are right.\n10:46 Comment: Higuaino left.\n10:48 Comment: And many doubted Napoli's attacking capabilities without Pepita Higuaino.\n10:54 Comment: But, friends, in three matches, in the first three rounds,\n10:58 Comment: Napoli scored 9 goals.\n11:0 Comment: That is an average of 3 per game.\n11:3 Comment: Better, more precisely, only Roma had the same result.\n11:6 Comment: Roma and Napoli have 9 goals each.\n11:8 Comment: Even Juventus scored 6.\n11:10 Comment: Plus, let's count, 2 goals in Kyiv.\n11:13 Comment: In an away match in the Champions League.\n11:14 Comment: It turns out that Napoli scored 11 goals in 4 matches without Goncal Higuaino.\n11:19 Comment: Which is a very good statistic.\n11:20 Comment: Yes, plus I earned 90 million euros.\n11:23 Comment: Yes, but this is economics.\n11:25 Comment: And, in fact, these 90 million euros from Napoli...\n11:28 Comment: Reinvested.\n11:29 Comment: Because Napoli had an extensive campaign.\n11:31 Comment: We'll also talk about this a little later.\n11:33 Comment: What am I talking about?\n11:33 Comment: Because don’t think that without Higuaino, Napoli began to play worse in attack.\n11:36 Comment: Yes, maybe the main striker has disappeared.\n11:39 Comment: But Napoli is also excellent in attack.\n11:40 Comment: Incini is on the attack now.\n11:41 Comment: There is a corrijon on the right.\n11:42 Comment: Lorenzo Incini hits himself.\n11:44 Comment: And very dangerous.\n11:46 Comment: The ball flies near the bar.\n11:48 Comment: Didn't seem to touch the daw ball.\n11:51 Comment: And here’s a counterattack.\n11:53 Comment: Again, yes, Incini moves to the center and shoots at goal.\n11:58 Comment: We note a small gap in Bolonia's defense.\n12:1 Comment: Between the lines.\n12:2 Comment: Defensive and midfield lines.\n12:4 Comment: Lorenzo Incini is currently using this.\n12:7 Comment: This is how Napoli attacks.\n12:9 Comment: This is the second strike in the first 12 minutes of the match.\n12:15 Comment: Bolonia have the ball for now.\n12:17 Comment: They light such a tall candle.\n12:18 Comment: But here Simone Verdi gets hit in the legs by Kulebali.\n12:24 Comment: I'm looking at Kulebali.\n12:28 Comment: Defender of Napoli.\n12:34 Comment: Bolonia is on the attack.\n12:41 Comment: Torosides.\n12:44 Comment: Vasilis Torosides failed to make the pass.\n12:51 Comment: Another pass forward.\n12:52 Comment: And here it is offside.\n12:56 Comment: Simon is offside.\n12:58 Comment: Simone Verdi.\n13:1 Comment: Yes, the Napoli defenders played competently.\n13:6 Comment: Lorenzo Incini with the ball.\n13:7 Comment: Delivery to the far post.\n13:8 Comment: Calihon.\n13:9 Comment: Dangerous moment.\n13:10 Comment: And 1-0.\n13:13 Comment: Jose Maria Calijon opens the scoring for the game.\n13:16 Comment: And who is in charge now, of course.\n13:18 Comment: Galeodor Napoli.\n13:20 Comment: Calijon, who scores regularly in the Italian Serie A.\n13:23 Comment: And this is already his fifth goal scored.\n13:28 Comment: In this season.\n13:30 Comment: Yes, it was a good pitch now.\n13:33 Comment: The ball landed directly on Calijon's head.\n13:36 Comment: Hit to the opposite corner.\n13:39 Comment: The goalkeeper was absolutely powerless here.\n13:42 Comment: Well, let’s note the transfer again.\n13:44 Comment: Cool diagonal pass to Lorenzo Insini.\n13:48 Comment: Mauritso Sari rejoices.\n13:50 Comment: The bench rejoices.\n13:52 Comment: And in Naples he takes the lead already in the 14th minute of the match.\n13:56 Comment: Quick goal.\n13:58 Comment: And the Applitans.\n13:58 Comment: Calijon's fifth goal in this championship.\n14:1 Comment: An excellent result for a wing striker.\n14:5 Comment: In fact.\n14:5 Comment: And Calijon is now the top scorer in the Serie A sniper table.\n14:13 Comment: And he is ahead, by the way, of Andrea Belotti.\n14:16 Comment: A young Italian forward who plays for the Torino team.\n14:20 Comment: Like this.\n14:22 Comment: Calihon really is a great start.\n14:25 Comment: And somewhere Kalikhon is now, in fact, and...\n14:28 Comment: He replaces Goncal Higuain in terms of goals scored for sure.\n14:34 Comment: Well, to be fair, let’s say that Arkady Shmelik remained in reserve today.\n14:40 Comment: But in this grief, Igor’s goal, in fact, the functions of the center forward in this trio were not needed.\n14:47 Comment: Because from the left flank Insigna made a pass to the far post.\n14:52 Comment: More precisely, yes, the right winger came running to the far post.\n14:58 Comment: Both Calijon and the center forward, in this case Manola Gabiadini, were completely idle.\n15:3 Comment: Distracted the defenders' attention.\n15:5 Comment: Yes, but so far Gabiadini is not particularly noticeable.\n15:7 Comment: 15 minutes have already passed.\n15:9 Comment: Naples are ahead 1-0.\n15:10 Comment: And we don’t really notice Manol on the field.\n15:16 Comment: Although let us remind you that for Gabiadini Bolonia is a special team, yes, in his destiny.\n15:24 Comment: Because Gabiadini...\n15:26 Comment: He scored it...\n15:28 Comment: Scored the first goal of his Serie A career.\n15:30 Comment: Team Bolonia.\n15:32 Comment: Well, now let's look at this attack on the pri, which can also be effective.\n15:37 Comment: The pass is again to Calijon, but this time it’s a corner.\n15:43 Comment: This is his former club.\n15:45 Comment: This is the team he scored 5 goals against.\n15:48 Comment: That is, the team that is the favorite victim.\n15:52 Comment: This is the city where he met his love.\n15:55 Comment: And where does he live, by the way?\n15:56 Comment: And this...\n15:58 Comment: A chance to return to the main team for Gabiadini.\n16:1 Comment: Yes, after Higuain left.\n16:4 Comment: It is clear that Arkady Shmelik was bought.\n16:6 Comment: But still a newcomer to the Italian series.\n16:8 Comment: New to the team.\n16:9 Comment: And it is clear that Gabiadini has a chance to win the fight against Milek.\n16:13 Comment: Calihon.\n16:14 Comment: Innings.\n16:15 Comment: Breaking the rules.\n16:17 Comment: Phew, on the attack.\n16:18 Comment: On Coulibaly’s side, he took down Vasily Starosidis so neatly.\n16:25 Comment: Well, quickly.\n16:28 Comment: The ball is put into play.\n16:28 Comment: Jackdaws Perboloni.\n16:29 Comment: True, here again the Neapolitans already have the ball.\n16:33 Comment: They play through Gamshik.\n16:34 Comment: Hamshik in the center of the field.\n16:36 Comment: But here they did not understand each other with just one monologue.\n16:42 Comment: Number 23.\n16:44 Comment: Napoli for now.\n16:47 Comment: He operates almost without the ball.\n16:52 Comment: Oikonomou.\n16:54 Comment: Pass back.\n16:55 Comment: To Costa.\n16:55 Comment: And Brazilian.\n16:57 Comment: It hits far.\n16:58 Comment: Forward.\n16:59 Comment: Hysai.\n17:0 Comment: Albiol.\n17:1 Comment: Hysai again.\n17:3 Comment: Napoli players confidently control the ball.\n17:6 Comment: And here, already trying to sharpen the game, Raul Albiol makes a mistake.\n17:12 Comment: Well, before this match Donadoni said that in Naples they want to continue to progress.\n17:20 Comment: Yes.\n17:21 Comment: Continue your growth process in terms of the game and in general in terms of psychology.\n17:26 Comment: Because there is a certain...\n17:28 Comment: The problem, of course, for Bologna today is in attack.\n17:31 Comment: Moreover, today there is no Flocker, today there is no Destro.\n17:35 Comment: Therefore, of course, Boloni will have problems ahead.\n17:39 Comment: And we see it all perfectly.\n17:41 Comment: Only one dangerous moment was created at the very beginning of the meeting.\n17:45 Comment: The very first moment was in the match, when Pepe Reina helped out the Neapolitans.\n17:50 Comment: Feed into the penalty area.\n17:51 Comment: This time the ball does not reach Calijon.\n17:54 Comment: Tarasidios plays well here.\n17:57 Comment: And Bologna with the ball.\n17:59 Comment: Bologna with the ball.\n18:2 Comment: Krejci.\n18:5 Comment: Out in favor of Napoli.\n18:6 Comment: Krejci spreads his hands.\n18:10 Comment: I thought that the ball went out of bounds from Neapolitans.\n18:15 Comment: Georginho.\n18:16 Comment: Pass to Hamsik.\n18:18 Comment: The one on Insigny.\n18:21 Comment: Napoli is again attacking with a large number of players.\n18:23 Comment: Lorenzo Insigni lost the ball.\n18:25 Comment: Bologna has a chance to counterattack.\n18:27 Comment: But it's already gone.\n18:29 Comment: For too long, players in light green T-shirts could not go on the offensive.\n18:36 Comment: Yes, you're right, Igor.\n18:37 Comment: Many leading attacking players are missing.\n18:40 Comment: And that's why today Bologna's attack is very young.\n18:44 Comment: Vladislav Krejci.\n18:46 Comment: Simone Verdi talked about him.\n18:47 Comment: Dangerous moment.\n18:48 Comment: A most dangerous shot on goal.\n18:51 Comment: Lorenzo Insigni avoided offside.\n18:53 Comment: He managed to escape into the free zone.\n18:55 Comment: Let's watch the replay.\n18:56 Comment: Brilliant.\n18:57 Comment: The pass was, of course, to Mariko Gamshchiko.\n18:59 Comment: Lorenzo Insigni took advantage of it.\n19:1 Comment: Handled the ball well.\n19:3 Comment: And everything was, in principle, correct.\n19:4 Comment: You can see how Insigny handles the ball under attack.\n19:7 Comment: The blow probably could have been more accurate.\n19:10 Comment: Yes, it was pretty easy here for Angelo D'Acosta.\n19:14 Comment: Because he pulled it out from under the crossbar.\n19:16 Comment: But the ball was not flying into the corner.\n19:18 Comment: The Brazilian just reacted well.\n19:21 Comment: Who will have to work hard today.\n19:24 Comment: But he is already working.\n19:24 Comment: Quite a bit of.\n19:26 Comment: Because and...\n19:27 Comment: Moments arise.\n19:28 Comment: Lots of hits.\n19:29 Comment: And, in fact, D'Acosta has already missed.\n19:31 Comment: Colichon.\n19:32 Comment: Submission to Gamshchik.\n19:34 Comment: Ricochet.\n19:35 Comment: What is the arbitrator's decision?\n19:36 Comment: Goal kick.\n19:37 Comment: Just like that.\n19:38 Comment: Verdi and Kreich in attack at Bolonya.\n19:41 Comment: Plus Federico Di Francesco.\n19:43 Comment: Friends, get acquainted.\n19:44 Comment: A new face, hopefully, in Italian football.\n19:47 Comment: This is the son of Eusebio Di Francesco.\n19:50 Comment: Which makes a splash in the Italian Serie A, working\n19:53 Comment: with Susuolo.\n19:54 Comment: And Susuolo, by the way, is the only team.\n19:56 Comment: Italian in the Europa League, which won the first\n19:59 Comment: tour.\n20:0 Comment: Inter, Roma, Fiorentino failed to win.\n20:3 Comment: But Susuolo defeated Athletic Bilbao at home 3-0.\n20:8 Comment: So the Di Francesco family is so popular now.\n20:10 Comment: Yes.\n20:11 Comment: And we note that Susuolo is the second team from Emilia\n20:14 Comment: Romagna.\n20:15 Comment: Accordingly, it is not far from Bolon.\n20:17 Comment: Yes.\n20:18 Comment: This is true.\n20:19 Comment: And Blue is on the attack in the meantime.\n20:20 Comment: To the far post Colijon.\n20:22 Comment: One touch.\n20:23 Comment: And the ball flies for Boloni.\n20:25 Comment: Boloni.\n20:26 Comment: Didn't go into the field.\n20:27 Comment: But it was difficult for Colikhon to get into the gate yard.\n20:30 Comment: It was too difficult a moment, an episode to take\n20:36 Comment: gate\n20:37 Comment: This is how I’ll finish the topic with Di Francesco, he’s young.\n20:39 Comment: He is a footballer with Federico Di Francesco.\n20:41 Comment: With his son – Eusebio Di Francesco.\n20:42 Comment: Player in the Italian youth team who scored in\n20:45 Comment: recent match and helped, by the way, the Italian national team,\n20:48 Comment: essentially qualify for the European Championships.\n20:51 Comment: Youth, which will be in Poland next year.\n20:54 Comment: The Italian team made it to the top.\n20:56 Comment: youth euro '17 and now de Francesco is in the lineup and what's interesting about\n21:2 Comment: in the last round he also scored for ballonya, so now there is a white streak in his

Hamshek.\n23:3 Comment: And after the departure of Higuain, who...\n23:6 Comment: Let's see. Incinia with the ball.\n23:9 Comment: Broadcast. And here he takes the ball.\n23:12 Comment: Galkeeper Baloy.\n23:13 Comment: And after the departure of Higuain, who, in general, refused to be a Naples legend,\n23:20 Comment: Hamshek actually lays claim to this title.\n23:23 Comment: Yes. Undoubtedly. Undoubtedly.\n23:25 Comment: Marek Hamshek is, in fact, alive...\n23:26 Comment: Even now I don’t remember how many seasons he spent in Naples.\n23:29 Comment: A long time ago. Probably already...\n23:31 Comment: Throughout my adult career.\n23:32 Comment: Well, he also had a period in Brescia.\n23:34 Comment: You see, he played in Breschi.\n23:36 Comment: I was in Breschi. This was his first club.\n23:38 Comment: Italian. After the Motherland.\n23:41 Comment: And Napoleon actually bought this young player for a fairly serious sum.\n23:48 Comment: Slovak. Then there was a shock for Italy.\n23:52 Comment: At the end of the last decade.\n23:53 Comment: Well, in the end, Marek Hamshek became the leader and captain of Naples over the years.\n23:57 Comment: And you're right, Igor. In the future, he is already a legend.\n24:1 Comment: But, probably, it can become one of the forces.\n24:3 Comment: And what a blow!\n24:5 Comment: What a shot Lorenzo Insini has.\n24:7 Comment: Again, a favorite maneuver.\n24:9 Comment: Performed by the newly minted blond.\n24:12 Comment: Lorenzo Incini moved to the center and shot.\n24:15 Comment: And it was very dangerous.\n24:18 Comment: Interesting about this...\n24:21 Comment: Fashion.\n24:23 Comment: I picked it up from Messi.\n24:25 Comment: From Neymar.\n24:25 Comment: Or from Neymar.\n24:26 Comment: Because Neymar picked it up from Messi.\n24:28 Comment: And all the rest are probably from Neymar.\n24:31 Comment: Well, the Italian press actually wrote about it.\n24:34 Comment: First of all, the newspaper.\n24:35 Comment: That Lorenzo Incini is apparently following the example of Lionel Messi.\n24:39 Comment: Well, they have somewhat similar data.\n24:43 Comment: Anthropometric.\n24:45 Comment: Short in stature.\n24:46 Comment: True, Incini is, of course, shorter.\n24:47 Comment: About seven centimeters, probably.\n24:50 Comment: But the style of play is certainly similar.\n24:52 Comment: Well, in my opinion, not very much.\n24:52 Comment: Well, it is clear that, of course, Messi is many times, many times a higher quality footballer than Incini.\n25:0 Comment: I think that he is many times higher quality not only than Incini, but also than 99.9% of players.\n25:7 Comment: Agree.\n25:8 Comment: Yes. The best player in the world is Lionel Messi.\n25:10 Comment: Throughout history, perhaps.\n25:11 Comment: For Lorenzo Insini, of course, this is far, far, far away.\n25:15 Comment: But at least he also plays in a similar manner.\n25:18 Comment: And you know, you said about a crazy trans film.\n25:22 Comment: Yes, at that time.\n25:23 Comment: I’ll tell you another story later, when there might be a pause in the game, I’ll tell you about a transfer connected with these two teams Bolonia and Napoleon.\n25:33 Comment: Necessarily.\n25:34 Comment: For now, Napoleon is with the ball.\n25:36 Comment: Albiol heads forward.\n25:40 Comment: On the right there is Peter Zelinsky.\n25:44 Comment: Another pass to Calijon, who again finds himself in the center.\n25:48 Comment: And Peter Zelinsky is wrong.\n25:50 Comment: Quite a simple situation.\n25:51 Comment: Bolonia has a chance in attack.\n25:55 Comment: Tider.\n25:56 Comment: Sapir Taider.\n25:58 Comment: Taider lost the ball and was intercepted by the Neapolitans.\n26:1 Comment: Hysaj, the Albanian with the ball.\n26:5 Comment: Yes, Hysaj, indeed, last season, this and last, became an indispensable player for Murizio Sari.\n26:14 Comment: Meanwhile, Incini is on the attack.\n26:16 Comment: Moves to the center.\n26:17 Comment: Pass.\n26:18 Comment: Nigra.\n26:19 Comment: Well, there’s Aside, of course.\n26:21 Comment: Probably Lorenzo Incini's fault.\n26:26 Comment: More than a monologue combined.\n26:31 Comment: Everyone understands this.\n26:35 Comment: So here's the story.\n26:36 Comment: Yes, from 68 to 75, a very famous scorer at that time, Giuseppe Savoldi, played for Bolonia.\n26:42 Comment: And he moved to Naples in '75 for a record sum.\n26:46 Comment: 2 billion liras.\n26:48 Comment: This is for those times.\n26:49 Comment: There were 1 million 200 thousand pounds sterling.\n26:53 Comment: That is, it was a very impressive amount.\n26:56 Comment: And then the Neapolitans set a transfer record.\n26:59 Comment: Then they set another record, we remember when Maradona moved from Barcelona.\n27:3 Comment: But Savoldi is probably a lesser-known character, frankly speaking, than Maradona.\n27:10 Comment: Well, Napoli also set a transfer record this year.\n27:14 Comment: For sale.\n27:15 Comment: Yes, for sale.\n27:16 Comment: Italian inside.\n27:17 Comment: Selling Gonsalli.\n27:18 Comment: Selling Gonsalli Guaina for 90 million euros.\n27:21 Comment: This is an Italian record inside.\n27:24 Comment: Therefore, of course, Napoli made history once again.\n27:27 Comment: By the way, Savoldi was a very cool player back then.\n27:29 Comment: But, nevertheless, he never played for the Italian national team.\n27:32 Comment: Played a few matches.\n27:34 Comment: Well, there were such examples, by the way, in the Italian Serie A.\n27:37 Comment: Players who looked bright in the championship, but did not play for the national team.\n27:43 Comment: Well, not only in Serie A, this happens in every championship.\n27:45 Comment: Papa Reina.\n27:48 Comment: On Gamshik's page.\n27:50 Comment: The ball didn't reach him.\n27:52 Comment: Varenzo Insini works in defense.\n27:54 Comment: And it’s not bad that Napoli is already going on the attack.\n27:57 Comment: Zelensky made a pass to Hamsik.\n27:59 Comment: And now Mari Gamshik is accelerating.\n28:1 Comment: Hysai.\n28:2 Comment: Here he is, the Albanian Hysaj, whom we have already talked about.\n28:5 Comment: But the transmission did not reach him.\n28:7 Comment: I said about him that he has become indispensable at Napoli.\n28:10 Comment: But, by the way, he played in Empaul under Sarri.\n28:13 Comment: And, indeed, he also showed himself there in a way that Napoli and Barcelona did not have.\n28:18 Comment: But, in fact, he acquired it.\n28:20 Comment: Well, I must say that he has a very interesting biography.\n28:24 Comment: Because his father immigrated to Italy.\n28:27 Comment: And there he met one of the agents, whom he asked to look at his son.\n28:33 Comment: In the end, Hysaj moved to Italy as a child.\n28:37 Comment: That is, he is, in fact, a product of Italian football.\n28:40 Comment: But he plays for the Albanian national team.\n28:43 Comment: Igor has already played 20 matches.\n28:46 Comment: El-Sied Hysay.\n28:47 Comment: For the Albanian national team.\n28:48 Comment: Including the European Championships.\n28:49 Comment: Main team player.\n28:50 Comment: Yes, he played at the Euros.\n28:51 Comment: And he is not that old.\n28:53 Comment: Even he is rather a young footballer.\n28:55 Comment: 22 years old.\n28:56 Comment: But everything is ahead.\n28:57 Comment: Well, it’s interesting that Hysaj will soon play against Italy.\n29:0 Comment: I remember that Italy and Albania are in the same qualifying group for the World Cup in Russia.\n29:5 Comment: In general, the countries are very close to each other.\n29:7 Comment: Geographically.\n29:8 Comment: For now, we note the standard position.\n29:12 Comment: In favor...\n29:18 Comment: Bolonia penalty.\n29:20 Comment: Well, what a chance.\n29:21 Comment: Bolonia attacks little.\n29:22 Comment: Of course, such opportunities must be used.\n29:25 Comment: Yes, every standard is, of course, a chance for Bolonia.\n29:28 Comment: Therefore, we need to make the most of such standards.\n29:31 Comment: There was a pass into the penalty area.\n29:33 Comment: Unsuccessful.\n29:34 Comment: Failure to serve.\n29:35 Comment: The ball went out of bounds.\n29:37 Comment: Yes, Napoli defends quite calmly.\n29:40 Comment: And in fact, in essence, Bolonia does not pose any difficult tasks for the defense of Napoli today.\n29:48 Comment: But this is what we were talking about.\n29:50 Comment: Yes, Bolonia is absolutely toothless at the moment.\n29:55 Comment: Yes, if we said that Napoli scored 9 goals, then Bolonia scored only 4 in 3 rounds.\n30:5 Comment: And Bolonia missed 6.\n30:7 Comment: Because it’s also an important point how much the team misses.\n30:10 Comment: Still, Bolonia last year was a team with a very strong defense.\n30:15 Comment: Bolonia missed very little.\n30:16 Comment: Especially before.\n30:17 Comment: Until the last two months of the season, when Bolonia frankly fell apart.\n30:22 Comment: Now there are 6 goals in the first 3 matches.\n30:28 Comment: But still, we will take the defeat to Torino 1-5 as some kind of accident.\n30:35 Comment: Because, after all, Torino is also not a top club, to put it mildly, in Italy.\n30:39 Comment: Not a top club, although, of course, Torino is aiming to get into Eurocup this year.\n30:43 Comment: Bolonia had losses.\n30:46 Comment: But, of course, we will tell them too.\n30:47 Comment: For now, let's record Napoleon's attack.\n30:49 Comment: With the ball, Incinia plays to Marek Hamsik.\n30:52 Comment: Lorenzo Incinia again.\n30:53 Comment: Petro Zelensky opens.\n30:55 Comment: No, Incinia plays simpler against Jorginho.\n30:58 Comment: Calihon.\n30:59 Comment: Pass to Albiol.\n31:1 Comment: What will Raul Albiol come up with?\n31:3 Comment: Briefly with Hysai.\n31:4 Comment: Next, transfer to the center.\n31:6 Comment: How calm Naples is in possession of the ball.\n31:9 Comment: Albanian Hysaj again.\n31:11 Comment: Pass down the right flank.\n31:13 Comment: Peter Zelensky.\n31:14 Comment: Calihon.\n31:15 Comment: But Kalikhon, it seems to me, didn’t play as well as he should have.\n31:22 Comment: Even the way I wanted.\n31:23 Comment: It seems to me that it has slipped a little.\n31:25 Comment: Not from your feet.\n31:26 Comment: But even now it’s already out in Napoleon’s favor.\n31:29 Comment: Pressing.\n31:30 Comment: The hosts' pressure forces Bolonia's players to make mistakes.\n31:33 Comment: Yes, there was a series of losses.\n31:35 Comment: And Manolak United took the ball too hard.\n31:38 Comment: But here, in the end, Bolonia now have the ball.\n31:44 Comment: Because there was a violation of the rules.\n31:47 Comment: Trosidias.\n31:48 Comment: Trosidias loses the ball.\n31:50 Comment: There is some kind of misunderstanding in Bolonia now.\n31:52 Comment: And Donadoni speaks out.\n31:54 Comment: Goes out to Romka.\n31:56 Comment: He makes a suggestion to his players.\n32:0 Comment: Donadoni, let me remind you, signed a contract until 2017.\n32:4 Comment: He has a two-year contract until 2015.\n32:7 Comment: In October he was appointed head coach of Bolonia.\n32:10 Comment: Napoleon with the ball.\n32:11 Comment: And this attack can become a scoring attack.\n32:13 Comment: If it were not for the magnificent performance of Vasilis Trosidias.\n32:17 Comment: Selfless.\n32:18 Comment: He blocked this blow.\n32:20 Comment: Peter Zelensky.\n32:22 Comment: He hit a turn.\n32:23 Comment: Polish.\n32:24 Comment: Legionary.\n32:26 Comment: On the field.\n32:27 Comment: And now.\n32:32 Comment: Now it's a corner kick.\n32:34 Comment: Corner kick for Napoleon.\n32:38 Comment: Let's look behind this corner.\n32:40 Comment: But Zelensky is a graduate of Zaglemetov’s youth team.\n32:42 Comment: There is a very good academy in Poland.\n32:45 Comment: Innings.\n32:46 Comment: Jorginho picks up the ball on the opposite flank.\n32:53 Comment: Plays for Raul Albiola.\n32:55 Comment: Jorginho again.\n32:56 Comment: What's next?\n32:57 Comment: Next is a feed into the penalty area.\n32:59 Comment: The presentation is bad, frankly.\n33:1 Comment: Therefore, the Napoleon players were unable to compete for the ball here.\n33:6 Comment: But they quickly returned it.\n33:8 Comment: Hysai.\n33:9 Comment: And again it turns out something like this.\n33:11 Comment: Translation to the left.\n33:13 Comment: Such a protracted attack by Napoleon.\n33:15 Comment: For a couple of minutes Naples has been on the opponent's field plan.\n33:18 Comment: The Neapolitans still have the ball.\n33:20 Comment: Cast to Insigne.\n33:22 Comment: And a header to the goalkeeper with the ball, Angelo D'Acosta.\n33:30 Comment: By the way, this is a meeting of principle, including for Donadoni.\n33:34 Comment: Because he also worked at Napoli.\n33:38 Comment: And I was in Donadona.\n33:39 Comment: And this happened, in my opinion, in 8-9 years.\n33:42 Comment: But not very successfully.\n33:44 Comment: Yes, he left Naples after a series of unsuccessful matches.\n33:47 Comment: First, sporting director Pier Paulo Marino left.\n33:50 Comment: Which, by the way, invited Donadoni to the team.\n33:53 Comment: But the dismissal didn’t seem to be planned.\n33:56 Comment: But then Roberto Donadoni left too.\n33:59 Comment: Gumshi as I saw it.\n34:1 Comment: Behind Manole Gabiedini.\n34:3 Comment: Made a pass to the Italian.\n34:5 Comment: Gabiedini with the ball.\n34:6 Comment: Funny.\n34:8 Comment: With a ball.\n34:9 Comment: Lost speed.\n34:10 Comment: And, by the way, the free kick was earned.\n34:16 Comment: Well, just after Donadoni left, Walter Mazari joined the team.\n34:19 Comment: With which the revival of Naples is supposedly associated.\n34:22 Comment: Yes.\n34:23 Comment: By the way, Roberto Donadoni was said to be a candidate for the post of head coach at Dynamo Moscow.\n34:28 Comment: But in the end he ended up in Calyar.\n34:30 Comment: Like this.\n34:31 Comment: Just like that in 2010.\n34:34 Comment: This is true?\n34:35 Comment: Or have you already forgotten how long ago it was?\n34:38 Comment: I don't know, Igor.\n34:39 Comment: It was 6 years ago.\n34:40 Comment: Therefore it is difficult to judge.\n34:41 Comment: Probably the main milestone in the career of coach Donadoni, not a football player, but a coach, was his work in the Italian national team.\n34:48 Comment: Donadoni worked in the Azzuri squadron.\n34:50 Comment: Not the best either.\n34:51 Comment: In the quarterfinals, I think they lost on penalties.\n34:53 Comment: Yes, on penalties.\n34:54 Comment: But, as many believe, if the Italian team had managed to beat the Spaniards on penalties, perhaps the Italians would have been able to surprise many.\n35:4 Comment: Although it is clear that that team was the world champion.\n35:6 Comment: Yes.\n35:7 Comment: Current world champion.\n35:9 Comment: And Donadoni came to the superstar team after Marcello Lippi.\n35:13 Comment: He was very difficult.\n35:14 Comment: But Donadoni was still a more stellar player.\n35:18 Comment: Undoubtedly.\n35:20 Comment: Although his coaching career is in full swing.\n35:22 Comment: He is quite young by coaching standards.\n35:25 Comment: Therefore, it is quite possible that he will be able to achieve success in the future precisely on the coaching bridge.\n35:32 Comment: Either in Bolonia, or, perhaps, will receive an invitation from a more titled and eminent team.\n35:36 Comment: Calihon!\n35:37 Comment: And he's on the right flank.\n35:39 Comment: By the way, there has already been talk that Donadoni is a candidate for the post of Milan coach.\n35:44 Comment: The team that is probably his closest.\n35:48 Comment: Precisely in club football.\n35:49 Comment: Yes.\n35:50 Comment: Milan had a crazy lineup back then.\n35:53 Comment: Simply incredible.\n35:56 Comment: There are Boban, and Pesai, and Maldini, Tassotti, Panucci, Savicevic, Masara.\n36:6 Comment: It’s just funny for me to even look at Milan’s current lineup.\n36:9 Comment: Kalihon is on the attack!\n36:11 Comment: Napoleo had a great opportunity.\n36:13 Comment: Again the opponent's goal is threatened.\n36:16 Comment: But here, of course, Kose-Maria Calijon was mistaken.\n36:19 Comment: Frankly I was wrong.\n36:21 Comment: It was possible to do a completely different program.\n36:24 Comment: George Via.\n36:26 Comment: Well, you can remember there as much as you like.\n36:28 Comment: Who later joined the team.\n36:32 Comment: Capello coached.\n36:34 Comment: Yes, Fabio Capello.\n36:35 Comment: I think that, of course, the same Capello influenced the coaching thoughts of Roberto Donadonni.\n36:41 Comment: I do not doubt that.\n36:43 Comment: The Neapolitans have the ball so far.\n36:47 Comment: Albiol passes to the other player.\n36:51 Comment: To Galida Coulibaly.\n36:53 Comment: Hamshek is on Albiol again.\n36:56 Comment: Albiol approaches the center circle.\n36:58 Comment: Here again it is played with a partner.\n37:0 Comment: Again the pass goes backwards.\n37:1 Comment: They are still looking for a continuation of the attack.\n37:3 Comment: Bologna is now all behind the ball line.\n37:5 Comment: But Hamshek finds Incini.\n37:7 Comment: Receives a postback.\n37:9 Comment: There was a free zone here.\n37:11 Comment: But not an accurate pass from Marek.\n37:15 Comment: Craft.\n37:17 Comment: Swedish defender Emil Kraft.\n37:20 Comment: Passes back.\n37:21 Comment: Next, take the ball forward.\n37:22 Comment: And for the first time Simone Verdi plays so confidently.\n37:26 Comment: Got caught on the ball.\n37:27 Comment: Turned around.\n37:28 Comment: Well, a free kick.\n37:29 Comment: In principle, Verdi played usefully in this moment.\n37:35 Comment: But what happens in the center of the field is another matter.\n37:37 Comment: This does not pose any particular danger to the Naples goal.\n37:44 Comment: Well, here, accordingly, there was an offside position.\n37:49 Comment: What does the assistant referee signal?\n37:52 Comment: Let us remind you that today Daniel Doveri is officiating at this meeting.\n37:59 Comment: Yes, Daniel Doveri.\n38:1 Comment: Experienced.\n38:5 Comment: Arbitrator.\n38:6 Comment: Who has been working in the Italian Serie A for several years now.\n38:14 Comment: Ensignem.\n38:15 Comment: Good pass to Stritch.\n38:17 Comment: Here he serves.\n38:18 Comment: There are no partners there in that part of the penalty area.\n38:22 Comment: And the balloons knock the ball out of the field.\n38:26 Comment: But the benefit of the Neapolitans.\n38:28 Comment: Elseid Hysaj will put the ball into play now.\n38:33 Comment: Once again there shows the moment.\n38:34 Comment: Well, Ivan Strinich's game was unsuccessful.\n38:39 Comment: Back again through Kulebali.\n38:42 Comment: Kulebali with a long stride.\n38:44 Comment: Moves to someone else's half of the field.\n38:47 Comment: Passes to Ensigna.\n38:49 Comment: Ensigna back to the African.\n38:52 Comment: Strinich.\n38:54 Comment: And Strinich is forced to play back to Pepe Reina.\n38:59 Comment: Albiol.\n39:2 Comment: Albiol is wrong.\n39:4 Comment: And here is the opportunity for Boloni to attack.\n39:7 Comment: And this attack ends with a shot and a corner.\n39:10 Comment: Federico de Francesco hit with a turn.\n39:12 Comment: Blocked Kulebali's shot.\n39:15 Comment: Here he is Federico de Francesco.\n39:21 Comment: And the set piece will be served by the Czech Vladislav Krejci.\n39:26 Comment: Also a young guy.\n39:28 Comment: Ball draw.\n39:30 Comment: To the tider in the penalty area. It could be dangerous.\n39:33 Comment: And at the last second.\n39:35 Comment: I think it was Ivan Strinich.\n39:37 Comment: Or Raul Albiol.\n39:38 Comment: Kicks the ball for a corner.\n39:40 Comment: There, a Greek defender somehow slipped past Mario Suikonomo’s ball.\n39:47 Comment: If I had stayed a little behind, it could have been very dangerous.\n39:51 Comment: What, are they going to play a prank? Yes, they played it.\n39:54 Comment: Gostin played a corner now.\n39:56 Comment: Verdi receives the ball from Krejci.\n39:58 Comment: Entered the penalty area.\n40:0 Comment: No, Lorenzo, if you don’t play like that, you can’t beat him.\n40:2 Comment: It turns out...\n40:3 Comment: No, it doesn't work.\n40:5 Comment: Napoli quickly go on the attack.\n40:7 Comment: The result is a violation of the rules.\n40:9 Comment: Pause at the end of the first half.\n40:11 Comment: 40. First minute of the match.\n40:13 Comment: Napoli are ahead.\n40:15 Comment: Beating Bolonio.\n40:17 Comment: 1-0. So far, the only goal has been scored by Jose Califo.\n40:21 Comment: Federico de Francesco has now left.\n40:26 Comment: And the Neapolitans will take the penalty kick.\n40:28 Comment: Well, I didn't.\n40:29 Comment: But, in principle, this fall is justified.\n40:31 Comment: But Don Nadoni shows us Sedovlasova.\n40:36 Comment: Who doesn't care about his gray hair at all.\n40:39 Comment: He said this in one of his interviews.\n40:42 Comment: These are the questions Italian journalists ask.\n40:45 Comment: Well, it seems appropriate to me.\n40:47 Comment: Don Nadoni. Gray hair.\n40:50 Comment: So it’s hardly worth worrying about.\n40:53 Comment: The topic of hair has been going sideways lately.\n40:56 Comment: But, in principle, this is not so.\n40:57 Comment: The topic of hair has been very fashionable in Italy lately.\n41:2 Comment: Kulebalie plays for Jorginho.\n41:5 Comment: Pass to Gabiadin.\n41:6 Comment: The one who tried...\n41:9 Comment: And, by the way, I earned a free kick.\n41:11 Comment: He tried to play with Kalifon.\n41:13 Comment: Gabyadine. And in the end he earned a free kick.\n41:15 Comment: And, by the way, perhaps for yourself.\n41:18 Comment: Gabyadine received the standard.\n41:21 Comment: Because there is an opportunity to shoot on goal.\n41:24 Comment: Mitrov probably has three.\n41:25 Comment: But Mitrov is probably 30 to the gate.\n41:28 Comment: But we remember how dangerously Gabiadine shot from outside the penalty area.\n41:32 Comment: Now is the chance to do it again.\n41:34 Comment: Polumal Starosidis.\n41:36 Comment: Apparently, he believed that he did not break the rules.\n41:39 Comment: Yes, but Gabiadine will hit the static ball.\n41:42 Comment: Nearby is Lorenzo Insini.\n41:45 Comment: Well, more likely, it seems to me, even 27 meters to the gate, friends.\n41:48 Comment: And not 30, but 27.\n41:50 Comment: Important clarification.\n41:52 Comment: Yes, I think the chances have increased somewhat.\n41:54 Comment: At least it helped Gabyadina hit his own goal.\n41:59 Comment: But Lorenzo Insini is also on the ball.\n42:5 Comment: But, more likely, he is.\n42:8 Comment: Although, judging by the run-up, Lorenzo himself is also preparing for the blow.\n42:15 Comment: Let's see. A most curious moment.\n42:18 Comment: No, of course, Gabiadine hits the wall.\n42:21 Comment: But, of course, it won't get up.\n42:24 Comment: The selection is still up to Bolonia.\n42:27 Comment: But the out is in favor of the Neapolitans.\n42:29 Comment: Napoli will kick the ball into play behind the touchline.\n42:32 Comment: Simone Verdi is dissatisfied.\n42:34 Comment: But he slid into a tackle with the ball from Napoli.\n42:36 Comment: Another positional attack.\n42:38 Comment: Gabyadine has moved quite deep now.\n42:42 Comment: And a long shot.\n42:44 Comment: Marik Hamshik. He is also famous for his famous kick.\n42:47 Comment: And this time Hamshik shot from both feet from the left.\n42:51 Comment: And to the costa on the spot.\n42:52 Comment: 62 to 38 in possession.\n42:55 Comment: Napoli has a total advantage.\n42:58 Comment: Very serious.\n43:0 Comment: In terms of ball control.\n43:4 Comment: But in this case it is an important role.\n43:6 Comment: Yes, which, in general, is probably not surprising.\n43:9 Comment: By the way, it’s interesting that according to statistics\n43:12 Comment: Inter has the greatest ball control in the Italian Serie A.\n43:19 Comment: Which is quite interesting.\n43:21 Comment: Which is quite...\n43:22 Comment: Well, I don't know, strange is not strange.\n43:24 Comment: But Inter, in general, is playing poorly so far.\n43:26 Comment: Inter is playing poorly.\n43:27 Comment: I would say even extremely unsuccessful.\n43:29 Comment: Judging by the Europa League.\n43:30 Comment: Defeated by Makabi.\n43:31 Comment: From Hapuel, I apologize.\n43:33 Comment: Bayersheua.\n43:34 Comment: Not even from Tel Aviv's Hapuel.\n43:36 Comment: Yes, Bayersheua.\n43:37 Comment: Plus only 4 points for the Italian series.\n43:41 Comment: And tomorrow, of course, is a big exam for Franco de Buro.\n43:44 Comment: Match against Juventus.\n43:45 Comment: Derby of Italy.\n43:46 Comment: The famous Italian derby.\n43:47 Comment: Naturally, you can watch this match on our channels from the holding match.\n43:54 Comment: Well, this match could become decisive in the career of Franco de Buro in the Italian Serie A.\n44:1 Comment: Quite possible.\n44:3 Comment: So far, the press has been mercilessly criticizing him.\n44:8 Comment: Napoleon is on the attack.\n44:9 Comment: Another breakthrough from Callejon.\n44:11 Comment: Trying to take possession of the ball.\n44:13 Comment: And loss.\n44:17 Comment: And Vasily Starosidis will dribble the ball on the sideline.\n44:20 Comment: Screaming there next to him.\n44:22 Comment: Exactly...\n44:25 Comment: No.\n44:26 Comment: Next will be throwing the ball.\n44:28 Comment: There's a loss here.\n44:29 Comment: Bolonia have a loss in their own half of the field in front of their own penalty area.\n44:33 Comment: This is always very dangerous.\n44:35 Comment: But the guys did a great job here in defense.\n44:37 Comment: And now Bolonia will try to enter the opponent’s half of the field.\n44:43 Comment: Simone Verdi gets caught on the ball.\n44:45 Comment: He got hit in the legs.\n44:46 Comment: From Jorginho.\n44:48 Comment: And the visiting team will take the penalty kick.\n44:51 Comment: The main time of the first half ends.\n44:55 Comment: I think that very soon we will find out how much Doveri added.\n44:58 Comment: I don't think that...\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Rotation players are mostly players with a great future, I would say so because\n0:4 Comment: that not all are young guys. Well, like the Napoli team, if they don’t continue to lose players?\n0:9 Comment: Yes, let's talk about the composition. Napoli is part of Bologna. Napoli have the 25th at Pepperine's goal,\n0:13 Comment: in the field 2nd Hysaj, 3rd Strinnich, 33rd Albioli, 26th Kulebali, 8th Jorginio, 20th Zelinsky and 17th Hamshik,\n0:22 Comment: 23rd Gabieddine, 7th Calijon, 24th Lorenzo Incini. Napoli plays in a 4-3-3 formation. Team Mentor\n0:28 Comment: Mauritso Sari. And the composition of Bolonia. Number one is Angela D'Acosta in goal. Field players\n0:36 Comment: 4th Emil Kraft, 35th Vasiliy Starosidis, 28th Daniel Gastaldelo and 2nd Marius\n0:46 Comment: Ikonomou. This is the line of defense. Now this attack by Bolonia will end. I will continue about the composition of the guests.\n0:52 Comment: Kulebali knocks the ball out. There will be no quick way out of defense. Next is the semi-lawyer\n0:58 Comment: Paschito, 16th Adam Nagy, 8th Safir Taiderro, 31st Blerim Djameili, 11th Ladislav Krejci,\n1:8 Comment: center forward Simone Verdi. Oh, yes, I forgot about Fredikov Di Francesco. Kreich and\n1:16 Comment: Di Francesco play on the flanks in attack. Similar schemes. Although, of course, Bolonia has graphic\n1:24 Comment: as our Italian colleagues tell us, the scheme is slightly different. 4-2-3-1.\n1:28 Comment: In my opinion, Nagy acts a little deeper. And, in principle, the schemes are similar. 4-3-3.\n1:33 Comment: Yes Yes Yes. Because initially, as it were, they gave these arrangements. 4-3-3. Both coaches play.\n1:41 Comment: Note that neither Naples nor Bolonia have any replacements. Well, now Napoleon is on the attack. Jorginho with the ball.\n1:48 Comment: Jorginho is wrong. The Bolonia team has a chance for a counter-offensive. Let's see what will happen next.\n1:55 Comment: Pass.\n1:58 Comment: To Taider Square.\n2:2 Comment: A huge number of ricochets. And Napoleon fought back with difficulty. Gimaele dragged the ball about 20 meters.\n2:9 Comment: But in the end, in my opinion, it was not used in the best way.\n2:15 Comment: Refers to the 4-3-3 formation. By the way, Donadoni also played in the Italian national team according to this scheme.\n2:21 Comment: And, in my opinion, it was with this setup that he lost to the Dutch, if my memory serves me correctly.\n2:28 Comment: Yes, it was in the first round of Euro 2008. 0-3 in the Italian national team, in the status of the current world champion, they lost to Marco Van Basten in the Dutch national team.\n2:41 Comment: Interception of the ball. Bolonia is on the attack.\n2:44 Comment: Bolonia with the ball. This is Emil Kraft, a fullback who has moved to the center. Now Swedish.\n2:52 Comment: Let's see. He ran back, yes, to his position Kraft.\n2:58 Comment: it was situational, after the partners did not support him, he ran forward reliably with such enthusiasm\n3:5 Comment: his counterattack simply began to roll the sword in the center of the field, Zelinsky passed three players, but then\n3:11 Comment: inaccurate pass we look at Bologna hit we have sophir taider with the ball still Bologna\n3:21 Comment: the attack of the guests continues, maybe there is no support here, practically it screams at the mousse to the left\n3:28 Comment: makes a pass back to that hole, now they’ve just come closer to someone else’s penalty area\n3:34 Comment: football players Bologna Taider kick and Reina on the spot this is already dangerous, perhaps for the first time in the match football players\n3:41 Comment: Bologna so many attacked the Napoleon gate perhaps 5 6 football players participated\n3:49 Comment: I still accepted that this happens at the beginning of the first half, an important moment and it is very important for us to understand\n3:55 Comment: and the Bologna initiative is burning, such a serious conversation\n3:58 Comment: was in the locker room or the players attacked a little, probably believed in victory until they were older, they fought\n4:7 Comment: and we didn’t expect such a start from Bologna at home, now everything will fall into place, let’s see\n4:13 Comment: let's see for now that korihon earned out in this situation by squatting Vasilisa Toro City himself\n4:23 Comment: Greek national team player and talked about fashion\n4:28 Comment: agate football players, but I note that recent years have certainly produced a huge number of football players\n4:33 Comment: from Greece it’s close to sail probably too, I’m playing quite an important lesson only in the composition of the balloon\n4:42 Comment: basically there are two of them, but as for the Greeks, they are such a special nation that they are now attacking\n4:52 Comment: the blow will take place before the blow took place\n4:58 Comment: such a warm-up for Angela Do Costa, such a juicy blow, the ladies turned out great, he seems to be there all the time\n5:4 Comment: he put in the force, the shot came out well, but before the cost in this situation he was good, he was on the line\n5:11 Comment: managed to react to the blow, it seems to me a sin, it is important not only the amount of the contract but also the situation which\n5:17 Comment: surrounds and the climate and landscapes and so on and so on and in this regard we are either very close but you\n5:26 Comment: right I think that\n5:28 Comment: from the point of view of the environment, and surrounded by people, landscapes, as you say, Italy is a miracle, yes, and yes, ideal\n5:39 Comment: the country is largely European attack another assembly of course in a balloon and then we’ll talk about the national teams now\n5:49 Comment: club football Jim or with the ball tries to throw the ball but it’s too late to play with\n5:58 Comment: the ball to the left flank and that it was offside, and by the way, Safir Tider ran in offside\n6:5 Comment: there was a position in the miles craft game, but was there a tider mined and it worked great here\n6:12 Comment: the refereeing team was indeed a little half a meter away at the moment of the pass, but it was out of play by Safira Taider\n6:21 Comment: Algerian midfielder with a French passport\n6:28 Comment: In general, it is not surprising.\n6:30 Comment: A free kick was played.\n6:32 Comment: And they are Apolitans.\n6:33 Comment: Kulebali.\n6:36 Comment: Kulebali with the ball again.\n6:40 Comment: The Senegalese passes to the left.\n6:43 Comment: Here is Strinich's connection.\n6:46 Comment: Kulebali again.\n6:47 Comment: I went to someone else's half of the field.\n6:49 Comment: This player is of impressive size.\n6:53 Comment: And we have to go back.\n6:55 Comment: Boloni may have an attack.\n6:57 Comment: Give the pass.\n6:58 Comment: Well, how ridiculous.\n7:0 Comment: And he made a pass now.\n7:2 Comment: Verdi made a mistake with the pass.\n7:3 Comment: But the attack continues.\n7:5 Comment: Boloni, Verdi, Jamili.\n7:6 Comment: Shot on goal.\n7:7 Comment: Ricochet.\n7:7 Comment: Jamili with the ball again.\n7:9 Comment: Boloni is good.\n7:10 Comment: In the first 5-7 minutes of the second half.\n7:12 Comment: Roberto Donadoni's players really play differently.\n7:18 Comment: Oh, Konoma.\n7:20 Comment: Another sin.\n7:21 Comment: Pass forward.\n7:24 Comment: And here Nagy was already wrong.\n7:27 Comment: He didn't deal with Kraft.\n7:30 Comment: Milcraft.\n7:32 Comment: Swede.\n7:34 Comment: More and more often it goes forward.\n7:36 Comment: And Milcraft is also a fairly young guy.\n7:38 Comment: He is only 22 years old.\n7:42 Comment: The Neapolitans already have the ball.\n7:47 Comment: And now it could be a good attack.\n7:49 Comment: Zelinsky.\n7:51 Comment: He held the ball a little.\n7:53 Comment: And he broke the rules of the field.\n7:55 Comment: So, Peter Zelinsky.\n7:56 Comment: Peter Zelinsky.\n7:58 Comment: I remember that he has been in Italy for a long time.\n8:0 Comment: He has been in the Udinese system almost since he was 18 years old.\n8:2 Comment: He showed himself immediately.\n8:4 Comment: Scouts from different clubs began to watch him.\n8:8 Comment: Then there was a rental in Empoli.\n8:10 Comment: And accordingly, Napoli acquired Napoli this summer.\n8:15 Comment: Zelinsky.\n8:16 Comment: The transfer was purchased by Udinese.\n8:18 Comment: Which is interesting.\n8:19 Comment: Zelinsky did not want to move to Napoli for a very long time.\n8:22 Comment: He wanted to go to England.\n8:24 Comment: Because his agent promised him an option with Liverpool.\n8:26 Comment: And in fact, Peter Zelinsky was sure that Liverpool was about to formalize the offer.\n8:33 Comment: And at this time Napoli, as a fairly competent club from a management point of view,\n8:39 Comment: I have already agreed with Udinese on the transfer amount.\n8:43 Comment: And all that remains is to obtain the player’s consent.\n8:47 Comment: And Napoli have already spent a month trying to convince Piotr Zielinski not to wait for Liverpool’s virtual offer.\n8:55 Comment: But still accept Napoli’s real offer.\n8:59 Comment: In the end, Zelinsky agreed.\n9:1 Comment: I think it is unlikely that he will regret it.\n9:3 Comment: The team plays in the Champions League.\n9:5 Comment: The team is ambitious.\n9:7 Comment: And most importantly, because Napoli’s football is close to Zelinsky.\n9:11 Comment: And in what way is it close?\n9:13 Comment: Well, Zelinsky is an attacking footballer.\n9:15 Comment: After all, he basically plays in the center of the field.\n9:17 Comment: Well, Liverpool, Jurgen and Klopp are also close to Zelinsky then.\n9:20 Comment: Now attack, then we will continue.\n9:22 Comment: Insignia. Hit.\n9:23 Comment: On the spot.\n9:24 Comment: Costa is there again.\n9:26 Comment: How many shots did Napoli have from that goal in this match?\n9:29 Comment: I don’t argue, Igor, of course, is close, but there was simply no real offer.\n9:32 Comment: There was just interest.\n9:33 Comment: Napoli made an offer, and football is close, because consider that even in this match Zelinsky plays in the so-called box-to-box position.\n9:40 Comment: Yes, that is, he plays...\n9:41 Comment: But on the other hand, it doesn’t always hit the base.\n9:43 Comment: That's the question.\n9:44 Comment: But there are chances. As we see, Zelinsky has the opportunity to prove himself.\n9:47 Comment: Well, in general, he might not have made it into Liverpool’s starting lineup either.\n9:50 Comment: Undoubtedly.\n9:51 Comment: Zelinsky has a chance to prove himself.\n9:53 Comment: By the way, a Napoli starter.\n9:55 Comment: He is young, he is talented.\n9:56 Comment: And we know that Delavretis understands that Zelinsky is also potential money.\n10:2 Comment: Because a player can increase in transfer price.\n10:6 Comment: So I think Zelinsky has good prospects in Naples.\n10:9 Comment: Well, Napoli got a very talented Polish football player.\n10:14 Comment: Craft, meanwhile, is with the ball.\n10:15 Comment: Failure to pass back.\n10:17 Comment: According to Ikonom.\n10:19 Comment: And a long kick.\n10:20 Comment: The translation is more accurate.\n10:23 Comment: To the opposite flank.\n10:25 Comment: Vasily Starosiis is already here.\n10:27 Comment: And Bologna puts the ball into play behind the touchline.\n10:30 Comment: By the way, Delavretis recently went back to Italian television again.\n10:35 Comment: Where he talked about his greatest love.\n10:37 Comment: There are two of them.\n10:38 Comment: This is cinema and football.\n10:39 Comment: This was reported on the official website of the Neapolitan club.\n10:44 Comment: He did not reveal the secret.\n10:45 Comment: Yes.\n10:46 Comment: Bologna has the ball for now.\n10:51 Comment: They continue to attack.\n10:52 Comment: Hit.\n10:53 Comment: Yes.\n10:54 Comment: Not a goal.\n10:55 Comment: That's a goal.\n10:56 Comment: Verdi.\n10:57 Comment: Simone Verdi.\n10:58 Comment: And his goal is almost like the music of the famous Giuseppe Verdi.\n11:7 Comment: It's just a song.\n11:10 Comment: It's just a symphony.\n11:12 Comment: What a great goal.\n11:14 Comment: Yes.\n11:15 Comment: Well, let's see again now, Nobel, whether Pepe Reina was wrong here.\n11:19 Comment: Here Verdi gets the ball.\n11:21 Comment: Out of 25.\n11:22 Comment: 27 meters.\n11:23 Comment: So he struck.\n11:24 Comment: Was there a ricochet?\n11:25 Comment: That is the question.\n11:26 Comment: There was no rebound.\n11:27 Comment: Reina was wrong.\n11:29 Comment: I tried again to figure out if there was a ricochet.\n11:30 Comment: But the ball changed its trajectory.\n11:31 Comment: I don’t really understand how.\n11:32 Comment: Was Simone Verdi really such a cunning blow?\n11:33 Comment: But in any case, we saw a very beautiful goal.\n11:34 Comment: At least an unexpected goal.\n11:35 Comment: There may be a mistake.\n11:36 Comment: Well, it’s logical to agree, if we take the beginning of the half.\n11:37 Comment: Here you go.\n11:38 Comment: Here.\n11:54 Comment: Yes.\n11:55 Comment: Verdi's second goal of the season.\n11:56 Comment: Verdi, as we have already said, is a young guy.\n12:0 Comment: He is only 24 years old.\n12:2 Comment: He spent last year with the Carpi team.\n12:5 Comment: Before that he played in Spain in the Eibar team.\n12:8 Comment: And Bologna bought the transfer completely from Milan.\n12:12 Comment: And Verdi was in Milan.\n12:14 Comment: But it was actually about the most correct word.\n12:16 Comment: Because he didn't play.\n12:17 Comment: He never played a single match for Milan.\n12:19 Comment: Boar.\n12:20 Comment: didn't pass.\n12:21 Comment: He is a product of the Milan youth team.\n12:24 Comment: Yes, I was also in Torino. He played in Torino.\n12:26 Comment: Played 16 matches for Torino.\n12:28 Comment: But he didn't score any goals.\n12:30 Comment: Actually, this is his first\n12:31 Comment: draws in the season\n12:34 Comment: in general in such big football.\n12:36 Comment: Because he scored in Empal.\n12:39 Comment: But that was also pretty\n12:40 Comment: for a long time. Well, here you go\n12:42 Comment: and the young attack worked\n12:44 Comment: Bologna.\n12:46 Comment: Next is a strike from Simon Verdi.\n12:48 Comment: Not without participation, frankly speaking,\n12:50 Comment: Peppereyny. But now let's see\n12:52 Comment: what Napoli will look like.\n12:53 Comment: And he still looks very good\n12:55 Comment: Bologna's attack is unclear.\n12:57 Comment: Verdi again. Shout.\n13:1 Comment: Do Di Francesco ball\n13:2 Comment: didn't make it.\n13:5 Comment: Not a violation\n13:6 Comment: rules\n13:8 Comment: Apparently there was\n13:9 Comment: in the playing position, most likely.\n13:12 Comment: Yes, the Neapolitans are lucky here,\n13:14 Comment: that the whistle sounded. And so\n13:16 Comment: there was another very dangerous attack.\n13:18 Comment: Yes, Hamshek.\n13:19 Comment: Insigne.\n13:21 Comment: No, it won't work here. Gorgeous\n13:24 Comment: Emil Kraft.\n13:26 Comment: All football players are different\n13:28 Comment: play against Bologna in the second half.\n13:29 Comment: Well, maybe except for DaCosta. And only in the first half did I play reliably.\n13:32 Comment: But if you take the field ones,\n13:34 Comment: how he managed to transform them\n13:35 Comment: Donadoni?\n13:37 Comment: This is psychology.\n13:40 Comment: This is locker room talk.\n13:41 Comment: And forward transmission. Not here\n13:43 Comment: Tarasidis. Tarasidis is good.\n13:46 Comment: Although in the first half it was he,\n13:48 Comment: didn't follow Insigne.\n13:52 Comment: Verdi.\n13:54 Comment: Translation.\n13:55 Comment: Too much.\n13:57 Comment: But the idea was not bad.\n13:59 Comment: Sharply transfer the ball to the left flank,\n14:1 Comment: where was Czech\n14:3 Comment: Kraich.\n14:7 Comment: Albiol.\n14:10 Comment: Gabiedini.\n14:11 Comment: Deeply departed from the depths. Starts\n14:13 Comment: Gabiedini's attack. Didn't go well\n14:16 Comment: for three persons. And he lost the ball.\n14:18 Comment: Running in. And gets the ball\n14:20 Comment: Tider.\n14:22 Comment: There are two players against him. Transfer to partner.\n14:25 Comment: Nagy.\n14:26 Comment: Further to the right. And here\n14:28 Comment: you have to make a discount.\n14:30 Comment: Yes, it goes to Emil Kraft.\n14:32 Comment: But, however, they have already closed the zone\n14:34 Comment: Neapolitans. Safe here for now\n14:36 Comment: there was Strinnich. Moves to the center\n14:38 Comment: Jamie Lee.\n14:40 Comment: There was a pass to the left flank.\n14:44 Comment: Tider.\n14:46 Comment: Nagy.\n14:48 Comment: Torosidis.\n14:50 Comment: Another pass back.\n14:52 Comment: Malonic is now in control of the ball.\n14:54 Comment: And actually play number one.\n14:56 Comment: Yes, I think the percentage of ball possession is completely different.\n14:58 Comment: Well, it probably hasn’t leveled off yet.\n15:0 Comment: Paulo himself whistles.\n15:2 Comment: What I talked about at the end of the first half.\n15:4 Comment: It is very important to be in the right tone emotionally\n15:6 Comment: to be Naples fans.\n15:8 Comment: That's literally a wasted 15 minutes\n15:10 Comment: and already there is a whistle in the tribune.\n15:12 Comment: Like this.\n15:14 Comment: And probably by now\n15:16 Comment: in the first minute. And this one, of course,\n15:18 Comment: Arkady Shmelik.\n15:20 Comment: Here he is the new hero of Naples.\n15:22 Comment: Polish national team player.\n15:24 Comment: Arkady Shmelik.\n15:26 Comment: Should appear on the field.\n15:28 Comment: But first, Bologna has a replacement.\n15:30 Comment: They leave the Nagy field.\n15:32 Comment: And Gonfried Donza comes out,\n15:34 Comment: which I already spoke about.\n15:36 Comment: Ghanaian midfielder. A very talented player.\n15:38 Comment: Gonfried Donza.\n15:40 Comment: Well, Napoleon has a replacement in position.\n15:42 Comment: Manolou Gabidini.\n15:44 Comment: Leaves the field.\n15:46 Comment: I couldn't.\n15:48 Comment: And instead of him Arkady Shmelik\n15:50 Comment: appears on the field.\n15:52 Comment: Number 99.\n15:54 Comment: Yes, Shmelik is the main hope\n15:56 Comment: to the second stage\n15:58 Comment: Neapolitans.

Undoubtedly,\n16:30 Comment: Mauritso Sari knows how to reveal\n16:32 Comment: football players. He was famous for this in\n16:34 Comment: Empaul, and Napoleon.\n16:36 Comment: And I think that for Shmelik this\n16:38 Comment: not the most\n16:40 Comment: to put it mildly, a bad option\n16:42 Comment: career continuation. Not only financially, but also\n16:44 Comment: financial aspect. But first of all because\n16:46 Comment: Melik can and should\n16:48 Comment: play better. Well he's pretty early\n16:50 Comment: By the way, he went abroad. Arkady\n16:52 Comment: Shmelik from Górnik Zabrze.\n16:54 Comment: In my opinion,\n16:56 Comment: 18 years of age.\n16:58 Comment: Although he was already playing in Gurnik as a starter.\n17:0 Comment: Arkady\n17:2 Comment: Shmelik number 99.\n17:8 Comment: With nothing Bolonia.\n17:10 Comment: A loss.

really was a pass\n27:4 Comment: Good\n27:5 Comment: For a second\n27:9 Comment: Hanshek was late, although of course not for us\n27:11 Comment: And no one really\n27:13 Comment: criticize him\n27:15 Comment: Hansek is one of the best passers\n27:17 Comment: In European football, but really\n27:20 Comment: It was clear that\n27:21 Comment: Hysai has already begun to open\n27:23 Comment: To this zone\n27:24 Comment: Tider\n27:25 Comment: And there, in my opinion, by the way, Allan\n27:29 Comment: Changed clothes at Napol's\n27:30 Comment: He is the one who will replace him now\n27:32 Comment:

position of Rigista\n28:54 Comment: Football players who play in the support zone\n28:55 Comment: Which starts the attacks\n28:56 Comment: Alan will most likely take over the team\n29:1 Comment: Now

Comment: Yes, someone plays better as a substitute\n29:45 Comment: But Milek and so and so\n29:47 Comment: And here is a great game from goalkeeper Pepe Reina\n29:50 Comment: Living space does not really affect the Turkish park for football players\n29:51 Comment: Deploys the Boloni player.\n29:53 Comment: It was a very dangerous situation.\n29:54 Comment: And then Pepperrain also played passing ball.\n29:57 Comment: And this is Alan.\n29:58 Comment: How did it go?\n29:59 Comment: Two rivals.\n30:0 Comment: There is xinxin.\n30:1 Comment: And Lorenzo Insigne receives the ball.\n30:4

playing at all.\n30:49 Comment: It was different in the second half.\n30:50 Comment: Bologna, I'm sure there will still be a chance to score.\n30:53 Comment: The home team has already made two substitutions.\n30:58 Comment: But this blow is Insigne.\n30:59 Comment: There may be a chance for Mertens to appear on the field.\n31:2 Comment: The signal is more accurate for Sarri.\n31:4 Comment:

apparently.\n32:24 Comment: Because the ball somehow went through his hands.\n32:28 Comment: He apparently wanted to catch him tightly.\n32:31 Comment: Let's see, Melik.\n32:32 Comment: From the left leg.\n32:34 Comment: Yes, yes, of course, until the end.\n32:34 Comment: No, he hit.\n32:35 Comment: He didn’t catch him tightly, but he didn’t help him out.\n32:38 Comment: Could he?\n32:39 Comment: Yes, I could, of course.\n32:40 Comment: From hand to bone, the ball went into the net.\n32:43 Comment: Melik scores the fourth goal in Serie A.\n32:46 Comment: And plus more goals in the Champions League.\n32:48 Comment: Fantastic start.\n32:49 Comment: Six goals by Arcadio Shemilik in Naples.\n32:52 Comment: And look, these people, friends, have already forgotten about Higuain, so I suspect.\n32:57 Comment: In the first Arcadio Shemilik.\n32:59 Comment: Now pizza in Naples will be named after him.\n33:2 Comment: In the name of Arkadio Shemilik.\n33:4 Comment: Melik.\n33:5 Comment: Well, the word is quite simple for an Italian.\n33:7 Comment: So...\n33:8 Comment: Double by Arkadio Shemilik.\n33:10 Comment: 3-1.\n33:11 Comment: The goal pretty much came out of nowhere.\n33:14 Comment: Because, well, Melik had the ball.\n33:16 Comment: Yes, he was close to the free kick.\n33:18 Comment: Then he sped up.\n33:19 Comment: He beat his opponent and shot.\n33:20 Comment: Arcadio Shemilik with the ball again.\n33:22 Comment: This time Gastaldello.\n33:24 Comment: It feels like he is already terrifying the Bolonia defense.\n33:28 Comment: Bolonia wins the ball.\n33:30 Comment: Tider plays to the left.\n33:32 Comment: Verdi opens here.\n33:34 Comment: But the pass should be backwards.\n33:37 Comment: And right to the central defender.\n33:41 Comment: Aikonomou.\n33:42 Comment: He's looking to see who to pass on to.\n33:44 Comment: Long transfer to the left.\n33:45 Comment: No, there is no chance for now.\n33:48 Comment: Oh, what will happen in Italian newspapers tomorrow.\n33:51 Comment: On television about Arkadio Shemilik.\n33:54 Comment: They will literally sing along to him.\n33:57 Comment: Well, especially the Neapolitan editions.\n33:59 Comment: Also Polish.\n34:2 Comment: Well, Polish, I have no doubt.\n34:4 Comment: Will definitely be noted.\n34:5 Comment: And here's Polish football.\n34:7 Comment: And so the superstar of the attacks.\n34:10 Comment: Robert Lewandowski.\n34:11 Comment: And then Arcadio Shemilik appears, who, of course, is still inferior to Lewandowski.\n34:18 Comment: For many components, probably.\n34:19 Comment: Well, he was already a starter, yes.\n34:21 Comment: We understand that Milik is a national team player.\n34:24 Comment: Yes, but not in pairs. He works in tandem with Lewandowski.\n34:26 Comment: Yes, even before his appearance in Naples.\n34:28 Comment: But now, playing in a big European championship, playing in a big team,\n34:33 Comment: Of course, Milik is already talking about himself as a potential star of European football.\n34:38 Comment: Considering his age.

    "summary": "In a thrilling encounter at Stadio San Paolo, Napoli secured a 3-1 victory over Bologna in the Italian Serie A. From the first whistle, it was evident that both teams were eager to assert their dominance on the pitch. Napoli, under the guidance of head coach Maurizio Sarri, showcased their traditional flair and tactical precision, while Bologna, led by Roberto Donadoni, sought to overturn recent form and make a statement.\n\n**First Half:**\n\nNapoli started the first half with a lineup slightly different from their regular starting XI, with notable inclusions being Ivan Strinic and Peter Zielinski, while key players such as Arkadiusz Milik, Allan, and Dries Mertens were on the bench. The attack was spearheaded by Manolo Gabbiadini, with Lorenzo Insigne and José Callejón flanking him on either side.\n\nMinutes into the game, Napoli exhibited strong ball possession. Marek Hamsik, the team's captain and tactical lynchpin, along with Jorginho, directed midfield play with finesse. Bologna, aware of Napoli's attacking prowess, opted to play conservatively. Their defensive efforts were put to the test early on as Insigne executed one of his classic moves, cutting in from the left and attempting a shot on goal, which unfortunately was too weak to trouble the keeper, Angelo Da Costa.\n\nDespite Napoli's dominance in possession and fluid passing, Bologna created the first significant scare for the hosts. A well-delivered free kick led to a dangerous moment, which Napoli's goalkeeper Pepe Reina managed to diffuse with a critical save. Simone Verdi, standing in for the injured Mattia Destro, appeared eager to impress and threatened Napoli's defense with his movement and sharp play.\n\nThe opening goal arrived in the 14th minute through a precise piece of teamwork. Insigne, moving with characteristic agility on the left flank, dispatched a sublime cross that found Callejón. The Spaniard headed the ball into the net, marking his fifth goal of the Serie A campaign and putting Napoli ahead 1-0. The early goal lifted the spirits of the home side while underlining their attacking quality.\n\nFor the remainder of the first half, Napoli continued to press, looking for a second goal to solidify their lead. Insigne remained a constant threat with his dribbling and incisive runs. Jorginho and Hamsik maintained control in midfield, keeping Bologna on the back foot. The visitors, missing several key players due to injuries, notably struggled to maintain any meaningful possession or create substantial threats to Napoli's goal.\n\nHowever, towards the latter stages of the half, Bologna managed to craft some attacking moves. Federico Di Francesco, attempting to follow in his father Eusebio Di Francesco's footsteps, showcased his speed and skill down the flanks. Yet, his and his teammates' efforts were often stifled by Napoli's well-drilled defense, led by Kalidou Koulibaly and Raul Albiol.\n\n**Second Half:**\n\nThe second half began with Napoli still leading by a solitary goal. Bologna returned from the break with renewed vigor and immediately put pressure on the Napoli defense. The Italian side, keen to not relinquish their lead, remained composed and disciplined. Bologna's early persistence paid off in the 57th minute when Simone Verdi unleashed an extraordinary strike from distance. The ball flew past Reina, catching him off guard and nestling into the net to level the score at 1-1. This goal was a testament to Verdi's skill and potential. \n\nSpurred by the equalizer, Bologna seemed more confident, launching attacks with greater frequency. Their defensive line, marshaled by the experienced Daniele Gastaldello and Emil Krafth, thwarted Napoli's attempts to regain the lead. Napoli coach Maurizio Sarri decided to shuffle his pack, bringing on Arkadiusz Milik to replace the quiet Manolo Gabbiadini. The move would prove to be crucial.\n\nMilik's impact was almost immediate. Known for his clinical finishing and positional sense, the Polish striker wasted no time in making his presence felt. In the 67th minute, Marek Hamsik's exquisite pass found Milik, who deftly chipped Da Costa to restore Napoli's lead. The stadium erupted as Milik celebrated his goal, which reflected his growing importance for the Naples side.\n\nSubsequent to Milik’s goal, Napoli did not relent. They continued to press and probe Bologna’s defense looking to extend their lead and secure the win. Lorenzo Insigne, although frustrated at missing a golden opportunity from an Alan assist, continued to torment Bologna's defense with his agility and creativity on the ball.\n\nIn the dying moments of the game, Napoli solidified their victory through another Milik strike. The Polish forward received the ball from a deep position, maneuvered past his marker, and fired a shot that Da Costa could only parry into the net. This was Milik's second goal of the match and his fourth of the season, underscoring his rapid adaptation and form since joining Napoli.\n\nMilik’s double capped off a stellar performance, where his introduction single-handedly swung the match back in Napoli’s favor. The final whistle blew, sealing a 3-1 victory for Napoli. Bolstered by his outstanding brace, Arkadiusz Milik duly earned the man-of-the-match accolade.\n\n**Match Analysis and Future Implications:**\n\nNapoli's triumph displayed their depth in squad and tactical flexibility, pivotal for their aspirations in both the Serie A and the Champions League. Maurizio Sarri’s strategic substitutions and the team’s resilience after Bologna’s equalizer emphasized their championship credentials.\n\nFor Bologna, despite the loss, there were positives. Verdi’s stunning goal and their initial response in the second half highlighted potential areas to build upon. However, defensive lapses and failure to manage late-game pressure remained concerns that coach Roberto Donadoni would need to address.\n\nThe match also pointed towards the increasing significance of players like Hamsik and Milik. Hamsik’s leadership and creative playmaking were integral, while Milik’s goal-scoring prowess suggested a formidable replacement for the departed Gonzalo Higuain.\n\nAs Napoli looks ahead to a congested fixture list, including vital Serie A matches and European commitments, sustaining this form will be crucial. With this victory, they affirmed their status as serious contenders and showcased their ability to bounce back under pressure.\n\nIn conclusion, Napoli’s 3-1 victory over Bologna was a display of tactical mastery, individual brilliance, and effective team play. The match highlighted the team’s strengths and adaptability and set a marker for their ambitions in the ongoing season."
