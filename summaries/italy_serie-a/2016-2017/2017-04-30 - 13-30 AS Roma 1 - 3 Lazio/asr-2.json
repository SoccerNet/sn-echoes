A really clean tackle from the Angolan defender.\n10:9 Comment: Emerson moves forward more actively than Rudiger.\n10:16 Comment: Louisianus has a good choice of full-backs in the police.\n10:18 Comment: There is Bruno Perez, there is also Mario Rui.\n10:20 Comment: But Emerson is very talented.\n10:22 Comment: And this is another talented guy, Svetlana Lulich.\n10:24 Comment: And he didn’t trip up Mark Parov.\n10:27 Comment: Long shot by Lucas Bigley.\n10:31 Comment: The captain decided to check how Voitsekhshchentny was feeling there.\n10:34 Comment: Missed.\n10:37 Comment: Lulic threw the ball between his legs.\n10:39 Comment: And further.\n10:41 Comment: He gave an absolutely clear pass.\n10:43 Comment: Baldequit was not there.\n10:45 Comment: And it seems to me that they lacked a person like Ciro Imobili.\n10:48 Comment: Who could play on the forward's instincts in this situation.\n10:53 Comment: But Latso made such a choice.\n10:56 Comment: After the match, let's imagine in the newspapers why this happened.\n10:58 Comment: Luxurious transfer to Keith.

Latso takes the lead in the Rome derby!\n11:7 Comment: Baldequita!\n11:8 Comment: 12th goal in Italian Serie A this season.\n11:14 Comment: And now Kurvasut will behave even more quietly.\n11:18 Comment: Unless, of course, these guys' conscience awakens.\n11:22 Comment: And they won’t remember that they need to push their team forward.\n11:28 Comment: A shot from under the defender into the dead zone for Wojciechshchenzny.\n11:32 Comment: Let's watch.\n11:34 Comment: And it seems like they’ve already covered it here.\n11:35 Comment: And he hits Emerson between the legs.\n11:38 Comment: And the Polish goalkeeper cannot react in time.\n11:41 Comment: He can’t simply because he doesn’t see the moment of impact.\n11:43 Comment: Not even in the corner.\n11:46 Comment: On the counter move he catches Keith Szczemcny.\n11:49 Comment: And Latso comes forward.\n11:51 Comment: Like this. Unexpectedly, because, of course, much more Roma attacked.\n11:58 Comment: Well, Latso scored in a situation where the goal did not seem to follow from the logic of the game.\n12:5 Comment: Roma won 2-0 in the first round.\n12:8 Comment: Then Latso finished in the minority due to the sending off of Danilo Cataldi.\n12:12 Comment: Strotman and Rajan Engolan scored for Roma.\n12:16 Comment: Well, now Latso has scored.\n12:19 Comment: And we remember that there were two more Roman derbies this season.\n12:23 Comment: In the semi-finals of the Cup. And there, on aggregate, Latso advanced further.\n12:27 Comment: Lazo will play in the Coppa Italia final against Juventus on June 2nd.\n12:32 Comment: And now the Latsali continue to move forward.\n12:34 Comment: The pass to Lukaku is too inaccurate.\n12:37 Comment: Although Jordan shows that a pass was made into the correct zone.\n12:46 Comment: How will Roma recover now from this quick missed goal?\n12:52 Comment: Olimpico continues to yell. I can't find another word.\n12:59 Comment: I can imagine how cool it is to be there in the stadium now.\n13:4 Comment: Senate Lulic.\n13:9 Comment: Here he copes with pressure from his opponent.\n13:13 Comment: It was Manolas who tried to push him out of the field.\n13:16 Comment: Bastan.\n13:18 Comment: Latso keeps the ball. Lumbago.\n13:22 Comment: And in a tackle, Emerson blocks this swing so that it lands in the hands of Schentsny.\n13:26 Comment: Conduct a counterattack on the throne at speed. This team is very good.\n13:30 Comment: Edge Sharai on the left, Salah on the right.\n13:32 Comment: Salah runs in. Pass too strong.\n13:33 Comment: But, nevertheless, Mohammed will be in time. He stops the ball right at the baseline.\n13:38 Comment: Engeland is waiting for a pass at the penalty line. It's hard to give it there.\n13:41 Comment: But this is a beautiful play in the style of Ronaldinho.\n13:47 Comment: And it almost passed Kevin Strotman.\n13:49 Comment: This feint is called elastico, when the ball is switched from one part of the foot to another in the blink of an eye.\n13:58 Comment: Well, here's Keitan.\n14:0 Comment: It would seem, how to score here?\n14:1 Comment: There are two defenders in front of you.\n14:3 Comment: They are blocking you.\n14:5 Comment: However, one false move and a very fast strike.\n14:8 Comment: Moreover, the kick is precisely when the goalkeeper begins to move towards the center and cannot clearly push off in order to get to this ball.\n14:23 Comment: 15th minute.

These numbers are called.\n23:25 Comment: Arsenal.\n23:27 Comment: He wants...\n23:32 Comment: But here, again, it is important what policy Ramon Monchi, Roma’s new sporting director, will pursue.\n23:37 Comment: And probably in the summer a very large-scale transfer campaign awaits us in Rome.\n23:48 Comment: Lukako.\n23:49 Comment: Got it out with Keita. Notice how deep Balde Keita goes.\n23:53 Comment: He is the only striker today, but he is not there waiting for the ball.\n23:58 Comment: Someone else's free kick. He tries to participate a lot in the combination.\n24:1 Comment: There was no violation against Biglia this time.\n24:7 Comment: And here Lucas Biglia is already here.\n24:13 Comment: Many people ask about pronunciation.\n24:15 Comment: But my colleagues and I learned that this is what they call it in Argentina a long time ago.\n24:21 Comment: In the Spanish style, not the Italian one.\n24:23 Comment: If it were in Italian, it would be Biglia.\n24:25 Comment: But he is Lucas Biglia.\n24:30 Comment: Emerson.\n24:35 Comment: They release him to pass along the flank.\n24:37 Comment: Lazio football players.\n24:38 Comment: But El Sharawi is already being met.\n24:40 Comment: But El Sharawi is moving to the center.\n24:41 Comment: Nain Golan is on his feet.\n24:42 Comment: Brilliant as always.\n24:44 Comment: You can serve.\n24:45 Comment: It's not so comfortable on the left leg.\n24:46 Comment: And the ball flew too close to Thomas Strakosi, who collected it on the way out without any problems.\n24:51 Comment: Tomas Strakosi made his debut in Lazio during this season.\n24:57 Comment: This was a match that I also had the chance to commentate on.\n24:59 Comment: Then Federico Marchetti got the right.\n25:5 Comment: Game against Milan.\n25:7 Comment: It was on...\n25:7 Comment: San Siro.\n25:9 Comment: Milan won 2-0.\n25:11 Comment: But then Strakosha played two games in a row without conceding goals.\n25:17 Comment: Everyone realized that he was fine.\n25:19 Comment: And, in general, Lazio fans are no longer so worried about Federico Marchetti being injured.\n25:27 Comment: This season is already 17 matches to date.\n25:32 Comment: That is, today is the 18th on the account of Thomas Strakosha.\n25:35 Comment: He conceded only 16 goals.\n25:36 Comment: Less than one goal per game on average.\n25:41 Comment: Although, in general, Lazio concedes a lot.\n25:43 Comment: 38 goals.\n25:45 Comment: By comparison, Roma now have 29 conceded goals.\n25:51 Comment: And this is the second result in the championship.\n25:53 Comment: Naturally, Juventus has less than 22 goals.\n25:56 Comment: Juve, who are in first place, just missed out.\n26:0 Comment: And who, let me remind you once again, lost points in the match with Atalanta in this round.\n26:4 Comment: And it will allow...\n26:5 Comment: If Roma wins, he will allow him to get closer to himself, a tangible distance.\n26:13 Comment: But this victory is now very far from Roma, because Roma is 0-1.\n26:18 Comment: And Roma cannot penetrate into the penalty area in any way.\n26:21 Comment: Lazio have to throw on Dzeko.\n26:25 Comment: But the very large Bastos and Defrey are always ahead of him.\n26:35 Comment: But he can't get into the stadium.\n26:39 Comment: Lazio fans are here.\n26:41 Comment: There were very serious security measures before this match.\n26:45 Comment: Many Roma fans were not even allowed into the stadium wearing paraphernalia with relatively offensive words addressed to Lazio.\n26:56 Comment: This is also probably correct.\n26:58 Comment: Although, on the other hand, is it possible to have a derby without this mutual picking?\n27:4 Comment: Another lag.\n27:5 Comment: Earns money.\n27:6 Comment: They haven't been around for a while.\n27:7 Comment: At the beginning of the match regularly.\n27:9 Comment: We saw these serves, but they did not turn out to be dangerous.\n27:14 Comment: And now?\n27:15 Comment: Now it didn't work either.\n27:18 Comment: And there will be one more try.\n27:28 Comment: The Romans also tried to play tricks here.\n27:31 Comment: But he is completely Ingalana.\n27:32 Comment: The awnings don't work.\n27:35 Comment: And the 28th minute.\n27:38 Comment: Roma is now in some kind of game state.\n27:44 Comment: I can't show my game.\n27:52 Comment: I wonder how stubborn Lucianos Paletti will be today.\n27:55 Comment: How long will he keep Totti on the bench?\n28:1 Comment: Lost Lazio.\n28:2 Comment: Quick draw.\n28:2 Comment: And you can immediately throw it at Salah.\n28:5 Comment: The speed of Mohamed Salah.\n28:7 Comment: There's a chance again.\n28:8 Comment: Jackon.\n28:10 Comment: Bad reception.\n28:11 Comment: Just bad from Edin Jackon.\n28:13 Comment: And while he was there looking for the ball at his feet,\n28:16 Comment: Bigley got his bearings very quickly.\n28:18 Comment: He knocked it out accurately without violating the rules.\n28:21 Comment: You need to run Parola.\n28:23 Comment: Although here both Baldeki and Tapa insure.\n28:32 Comment: John again.\n28:33 Comment: The three of them had already met him.\n28:35 Comment: Includes Roma players,\n28:37 Comment: realizing that now this guy cannot be beaten.\n28:41 Comment: El Sharai.\n28:42 Comment: Dzeko performed well in the role of Pillar now.\n28:46 Comment: El Sharai failed to outwit Bashtoush.\n28:49 Comment: And the Roma footballer breaks the rules in attack.\n28:52 Comment: Lazio have done very well in their goal so far.\n28:54 Comment: Dzeko had a moment at the beginning.\n28:57 Comment: Salah had a moment\n28:58 Comment: when he beat Luk in speed.\n28:59 Comment: All.\n29:1 Comment: Given that Roma has the ball\n29:4 Comment: 70 percent of the time\n29:5 Comment: Not enough time, probably.\n29:13 Comment: Valeky That is a very interesting figure.\n29:18 Comment: A man who could easily play for the Spanish national team.\n29:22 Comment: Because he is a product of Barcelona.\n29:27 Comment: And he was born in Spain.\n29:29 Comment: In the end, I still chose the Senegalese team.\n29:31 Comment: Last year he made his debut for her.\n29:32 Comment: Already played 12 matches.\n29:33 Comment: Scored three goals.\n29:36 Comment: It seemed to me that the Spaniards could have played it earlier.\n29:40 Comment: But perhaps it was his choice.\n29:43 Comment: At the same time, Valeky Ta has one match for the Catalan national team.\n29:49 Comment: Emerson's cross to the far post.\n29:51 Comment: Salah clearly places the ball on the turf.\n29:53 Comment: But here it’s definitely possible to play on the same level.\n29:56 Comment: The defender of Latso is on his way.\n29:57 Comment: Takeout Another takeaway.\n30:0 Comment: Maybe Latsale is a little lucky.\n30:5 Comment: And the fans immediately turn on too.\n30:11 Comment: I would like to believe that Emerson will touch Roma to the quick.\n30:18 Comment: The defenders have already moved forward.\n30:23 Comment: Rüdeger.\n30:25 Comment: Salah.\n30:30 Comment: Well, the Latso players realized that Salah was outplaying in terms of speed.\n30:35 Comment: And now Jordan Lukaku is much more careful on his flank.\n30:43 Comment: And Kurva Sud just now began to actively support Roma.\n30:49 Comment: The Roma fan platform was silent for exactly half an hour.\n30:53 Comment: This is such a protest. Well, at least not the whole match.\n30:55 Comment: And that's good.\n30:58 Comment: And it's all.\n31:10 Comment: Yes, now we hear that Roma has support in this derby.\n31:15 Comment: Below is the brilliant Daniel Derosy.\n31:17 Comment: He knows how to do it.\n31:18 Comment: But Salah did not immediately get his bearings and was unable to derive any benefit from this.\n31:26 Comment: Derosi tries to lead the team.\n31:28 Comment: Strotman.\n31:29 Comment: Pass to Dzeko.\n31:31 Comment: Edin hasn't gotten into this match at all yet.\n31:33 Comment: Parolo.\n31:35 Comment: Balde Keita\n31:36 Comment: Lazio no longer flies into a counterattack\n31:39 Comment: Acts a little more academically than it was at the beginning\n31:42 Comment: Dushimbasta is free on the right\n31:48 Comment: Well, there’s no risk here either.\n31:53 Comment: Saves the start of Sali Lukaku\n31:56 Comment: Parolo\n31:57 Comment: There is free space in front of him\n31:59 Comment: Manolos does not immediately meet him\n32:0 Comment: Keita placed the body well\n32:2 Comment: Walks into the penalty area\n32:2 Comment: Five of them surrounded him with Roma players\n32:4 Comment: And Keita is absolutely not worried about this\n32:10 Comment: Keeps the ball for Lukaku\n32:12 Comment: And out in favor of Lazio\n32:14 Comment: The nominal guests look calmer, much calmer\n32:19 Comment: Roma understands what this match means to her\n32:27 Comment: She really wants the Scudetto, but she can't win it\n32:32 Comment: Over the past years\n32:34 Comment: Calmed down\n32:34 Comment: And then came the clues\n32:38 Comment: Sick Keita vs. Kevin Strotman\n32:41 Comment: We need to calm down there, because\n32:46 Comment: Keita was left alone against two\n32:48 Comment: And still the conversations continue\n32:50 Comment: But it seems they managed to localize the conflict\n32:57 Comment: Dorosi\n33:1 Comment: Wow\n33:4 Comment: Interesting pass\n33:6 Comment: Dorosi is also a student of Totti\n33:12 Comment: If you can play beautifully\n33:15 Comment: And this does not pose any danger to the team\n33:19 Comment: And sometimes it even carries\n33:20 Comment: Anyway, play nice\n33:22 Comment: Joe Gabonitu\n33:32 Comment: Salah, there is no dangerous game\n33:34 Comment: Dorosi, good pass as planned\n33:41 Comment: A little stronger than necessary\n33:42 Comment: Yes, Salah’s speed is, of course, very respected by Roma players\n33:46 Comment: But it's not limitless\n33:47 Comment: Here he couldn’t catch this ball\n33:49 Comment: The captain apologizes\n33:53 Comment: In front of your partner\n33:56 Comment: Simon Enzaghi\n33:58 Comment: Goes to the edge of the field\n34:0 Comment: What about Paletti?\n34:4 Comment: Povashe and Simona\n34:7 Comment: It was interesting for us\n34:9 Comment: It could be here too\n34:12 Comment: Traditional emotional\n34:14 Comment: But we see him extremely rarely\n34:16 Comment: First half progress\n34:25 Comment: Emerson\n34:26 Comment: Again quite boldly goes to the other side of the field\n34:30 Comment: On Ingovlan\n34:32 Comment: Fasion\n34:34 Comment: Emerson.\n34:36 Comment: The translation into Roediger is not bad.\n34:38 Comment: But it won’t connect forward right away.\n34:40 Comment: Therefore, you have to play through Manolos.\n34:42 Comment: And Manolos does not accurately pass to Roediger.\n34:44 Comment: Roma lose balls in simple situations.\n34:46 Comment: Francesco Totti went to warm up.\n34:50 Comment: Bam-bam-bam-bam.\n34:52 Comment: Maybe we'll even see him during the break.\n34:54 Comment: Well, that is, right after the break.\n34:59 Comment: If this is the case, then probably Jack instead.\n35:2 Comment: But we already saw what Jack did in the match with Piscara.\n35:7 Comment: When he was replaced by Luciano Spalletti.\n35:10 Comment: There was very active dissatisfaction about the fact that\n35:15 Comment: that Edin was forced to leave the field earlier.\n35:18 Comment: Baldekita's leg went off.\n35:19 Comment: Again, I put it under the left.\n35:20 Comment: A healthy shot into the far corner.\n35:22 Comment: This is Marco Parolo.\n35:23 Comment: I ran at the second pace.\n35:25 Comment: It wasn't easy for Disappeared.\n35:29 Comment: But here Wojciech saw everything.\n35:31 Comment: It is very important.\n35:32 Comment: And for the goalkeeper.\n35:33 Comment: If you see the moment of impact, you can react in time.\n35:37 Comment: The lawn failed.\n35:38 Comment: The Stadio Olimpico turf let us down a little.\n35:41 Comment: In Baldequita.\n35:47 Comment: Several saves are already very good.\n35:49 Comment: Shown by Wojciech Częc.\n35:50 Comment: And I wouldn’t blame him for the missed goal.\n35:53 Comment: Of course this is the near corner.\n35:54 Comment: But this is not a situation in which a goalkeeper could and would be obliged to save his team.\n36:2 Comment: If I had saved him, I would have been a hero.\n36:5 Comment: And it was a little unlucky.\n36:15 Comment: Jordan Lukako will throw.\n36:17 Comment: Valdequita will, of course, go into the penalty area.\n36:21 Comment: Lukako plays back a little.\n36:24 Comment: And that's a loss.\n36:25 Comment: For Latsov, Wallace makes too inaccurate a pass.\n36:32 Comment: The game has calmed down.\n36:35 Comment: And this plays into Latsov’s hands.\n36:36 Comment: Latsova is now in control of the situation.\n36:38 Comment: Latsova feels her strength.\n36:40 Comment: Including in defense.\n36:41 Comment: And so he tries not to speed up the pace too much.\n36:48 Comment: Rüdiger.\n36:50 Comment: Salah.\n36:51 Comment: Again very deep.\n36:52 Comment: Laziale defense line.\n36:54 Comment: And Strotman simply rests on Biglia.\n36:57 Comment: Biglia, who is playing a magnificent match today.\n37:2 Comment: Well, it’s not for nothing that he is the main supporter of the Argentina national team.\n37:7 Comment: Which, however, may not yet get to the World Championships in Russia.\n37:10 Comment: But that's another topic.\n37:11 Comment: Strokosha.\n37:14 Comment: Shows. Remove this lying around here.\n37:20 Comment: Well, I think it was he who first spoke about Jack.\n37:23 Comment: But in the end, Bastos has problems.\n37:26 Comment: Which to Jack with his elbow.\n37:31 Comment: At first.\n37:32 Comment: Detained. Then he massaged it.\n37:35 Comment: As a result, I laid it on the lawn.\n37:42 Comment: Totti. To pair with Jack or instead of Jack?\n37:47 Comment: Complex issue.\n37:50 Comment: Edin Jack.\n37:53 Comment: Top scorer of the championship.\n37:54 Comment: He can score in almost any situation.\n37:58 Comment: But in almost any situation he may not score.\n38:0 Comment: What will he come up with to burn?\n38:9 Comment: Pressure from Roma.\n38:11 Comment: Not the most typical sight for this match.\n38:13 Comment: Jack definitely needs to fight here.\n38:15 Comment: And go to the end.\n38:18 Comment: On Ingolan.\n38:22 Comment: El Sharawi shifts to the right.\n38:23 Comment: They don't let him beat him.\n38:25 Comment: And again this is Biglia.\n38:26 Comment: Which is reliable.\n38:27 Comment: At the same time, it seems to be invisible.\n38:30 Comment: But it works very clearly in all situations.\n38:35 Comment: On Ingolan. On the left is Emerson.\n38:36 Comment: Ingolan plays through the center. Fine.\n38:38 Comment: Casting Fucked. Jack falls.\n38:40 Comment: What does Daniel Rusato show?\n38:43 Comment: Nothing.\n38:45 Comment: To drop such a colossus, you have to try very hard.\n38:50 Comment: Bashkor didn’t try very hard here.\n38:54 Comment: There was a hand, but it was not fatal.\n38:57 Comment: This is not a penalty.\n39:0 Comment: And it’s certainly not a penalty compared to what happened in Roma’s penalty area at the beginning of the match,\n39:5 Comment: when Manolos kicked Jordan Lukako's legs.\n39:15 Comment: Emerson moves to the center.\n39:17 Comment: It's dangerous there. It was possible to lose the ball.\n39:20 Comment: Verosi. Rüdiger.\n39:23 Comment: Struatman.\n39:25 Comment: It seems that Latsu’s defense is being pulled away a little from the Roma footballer.\n39:27 Comment: Mohammed Salak. The delivery is again unaddressed.\n39:30 Comment: Because Dzeko is closed.\n39:31 Comment: He doesn't try to get ahead of the curve.\n39:33 Comment: He doesn't operate in the style of, for example, Edinson Cavani.\n39:35 Comment: Who catches just these balls in the penalty area, often jumping to the near post.\n39:40 Comment: And in the end Latsu counterattacked.\n39:42 Comment: Beagley slows her down.\n39:44 Comment: Doesn't wait for connection.\n39:46 Comment: This time Lulic has no backup on the right flank.\n39:50 Comment: Do they really believe that Lulic won’t beat Fazio?\n39:53 Comment: I didn’t beat him because I didn’t do it.\n39:55 Comment: I ended up in Derosi.\n39:57 Comment: Fasio.\n40:0 Comment: Emerson.\n40:2 Comment: Nice passage.\n40:4 Comment: And a violation of the rules on the part of Lucas Bigley.\n40:6 Comment: So far, by the way, Daniel Orsato is working very calmly.\n40:9 Comment: Yes, he did not award a possible penalty.\n40:11 Comment: But he has the game under control.\n40:14 Comment: No yellow cards.\n40:18 Comment: Does not allow serious clashes.\n40:22 Comment: Considering that this is a derby.\n40:24 Comment: Here there should be sparks in any part of the field.\n40:30 Comment: But, as you can see, it does not rise.\n40:32 Comment: Fifth time.\n40:33 Comment: Five minutes before the end of the first half.\n40:35 Comment: And, probably, at least two will be added.\n40:38 Comment: But it’s too early to draw conclusions.\n40:40 Comment: I think that now the ending will also be impressive for us.\n40:44 Comment: Emerson.\n40:46 Comment: Lazio dug in here.\n40:48 Comment: El Sharawi.\n40:50 Comment: Serve again.\n40:52 Comment: Bad option. These awnings are just a bad option.\n40:54 Comment: We need to end him because he can't win.\n40:56 Comment: But of course this is not true.\n40:58 Comment: We need to finish with him, because he is clearly hopeless.\n41:13 Comment: But these are the emotions Garoma really evokes in the first half.\n41:17 Comment: A very good shot from Italian kalapi.\n41:23 Comment: El Sharawi needs to keep the ball in the field.\n41:25 Comment: Who's in the penalty area?\n41:26 Comment: Stefan is walking on his own.\n41:27 Comment: Pass with the outside.\n41:28 Comment: Salak.\n41:29 Comment: Where's Jacko?\n41:30 Comment: Strotman.\n41:31 Comment: Raja Neingolan.\n41:32 Comment: Pass to the far post.\n41:33 Comment: You can break through here.\n41:34 Comment: High jump from Wallace Neingolan.\n41:36 Comment: Basta is against him.\n41:37 Comment: There is a safety net.\n41:38 Comment: Raja serves again.\n41:39 Comment: Lazio fought back again.\n41:40 Comment: Rüdiger.\n41:41 Comment: From the left leg.\n41:42 Comment: Well, not very much.\n41:43 Comment: But on target.\n41:44 Comment: And who is not happy here anymore?\n41:45 Comment: Roma fans, why are they fighting back like this?\n41:46 Comment: And here it is.\n41:47 Comment: Stand.\n41:52 Comment: And who is not happy here anymore?\n41:55 Comment: Roma fans, this is how this attack ended.\n41:58 Comment: Or Lazio fans.\n41:59 Comment: In principle, the very fact of existence in the world\n42:2 Comment: Antonio Rudiger.\n42:3 Comment: Simone Enzaghi.\n42:8 Comment: Replacement.\n42:9 Comment: Wow.\n42:10 Comment: Some kind of trauma.\n42:11 Comment: Yes, Lukako apparently has an injury.\n42:13 Comment: Philip Anderson comes on instead.\n42:18 Comment: Looks like there will be a tactical change at the end of the first\n42:21 Comment: half.\n42:22 Comment: Things are not going my way.\n42:23 Comment: A bit of Lazio today with these injuries.\n42:29 Comment: Apparently, the immobiles also received some damage.\n42:31 Comment: warm-up.\n42:32 Comment: Once it was replaced at the last moment.\n42:34 Comment: And Lukako is injured.\n42:35 Comment: He explains now in what situation this happened\n42:42 Comment: trouble.\n42:43 Comment: Philip Anderson.\n42:44 Comment: One of the best passers in the Italian Serie A.\n42:49 Comment: He has 8 assists.\n42:51 Comment: And Mzagi, in his own style, shows that he is wrong\n43:3 Comment: Roma football players.\n43:4 Comment: But in the end they gave the ball to Lazio.\n43:6 Comment: So everything is fine.\n43:7 Comment: And the reserve referee reassures the head coach of Lazio El\n43:12 Comment: Sharavi.\n43:13 Comment: There, of course, they closed the front gate.\n43:15 Comment: There are no fouls at all in front of the penalty area.\n43:17 Comment: There is absolutely no chance for dangerous free kicks.\n43:20 Comment: And here he is, in the ranking, not winning.\n43:23 Comment: Lazio's defenders play extremely accurately.\n43:30 Comment: But it seems to me that this is not only a matter of their skill,\n43:33 Comment: but also that Roma can’t offer anything special\n43:36 Comment: non-standard.\n43:37 Comment: Here's Rudiger, his dribbling.\n43:39 Comment: This is non-standard, right?\n43:40 Comment: Yes!\n43:41 Comment: Let's!\n43:42 Comment: On indu-lan!\n43:44 Comment: Rüdiger!\n43:46 Comment:

replay.\n44:15 Comment: Well, what exactly is the question?\n44:21 Comment: Well, just a blow to the legs.\n44:23 Comment: Maybe he didn't break his leg?\n44:26 Comment: Oh, not here.\n44:28 Comment: Listen, how different is real-time mode from super slow-motion replays?\n44:35 Comment: Lucas Bigley receives a yellow card.\n44:37 Comment: But in the situation when Lukako fell, it seemed to us in life mode that this was not a penalty.\n44:45 Comment: And there was a penalty here.\n44:46 Comment: It seemed to us in life mode that it was definitely a penalty.\n44:48 Comment: In fact, the Lazio football player did not hit Strotman in the leg.\n44:51 Comment: Derosi takes the 11-meter kick.\n44:53 Comment: And he still scores.\n44:56 Comment: Although it is not clear how.\n44:57 Comment: 1-1.\n44:58 Comment: Futura's captain Daniel Desrosy equalizes the score.\n45:1 Comment: How did the ball fly into the goal?\n45:3 Comment: Strokoshevich guessed right.\n45:5 Comment: And the ball

Video replays.\n45:21 Comment: Come to us, please.\n45:23 Comment: So that everything is fair and simple.\n45:27 Comment: Yes.\n45:29 Comment: And Strokosha didn’t guess.\n45:31 Comment: He tried to react and just didn't reach that ball.\n45:36 Comment: He jerked a little to the right and was no longer able to push off well enough to reach it.\n45:42 Comment: The last moment changed the goalkeeper's decision.\n45:45 Comment: In Laziale.\n45:47 Comment: 1-1.\n45:50 Comment: But we can say that this is not so.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Gate, in the center of defense is the very

his hands\n1:7 Comment: But twice wrong decisions related to penalties\n1:10 Comment: Accepted based on tips from his assistants\n1:13 Comment: Volvulus\n1:13 Comment: Also, do not forget that the judging panel must be considered as a single whole.\n1:19 Comment: If she's wrong, she's completely wrong.\n1:22 Comment: Your TV match commentator Pavel Zanozin\n1:25 Comment: Rome Derby, Bruno

Simply brilliant.\n17:35 Comment: Philip Anderson.\n17:38 Comment: Basta has already taken up residence in the penalty area.\n17:40 Comment: He asks for a transfer, and Philip Anderson goes at his expense.\n17:43 Comment: And now you can cross, and he hits the near corner.\n17:46 Comment: Sly.\n17:48 Comment: Didn't score, but was very close to it.\n17:52 Comment: The catchers corner earns.\n17:53 Comment: It was possible to give this pass to Basta at the last moment.\n17:56 Comment: Here. Because Basta was alone.\n17:58 Comment: Fazio just didn’t reach him.\n18:2 Comment: Voitsekhschensny tripped him up.\n18:4 Comment: Let's see.\n18:7 Comment: But here, along with the ball, at least it hit Fazio’s leg.\n18:10 Comment: So there is less chance of a penalty here than there was in the case of Lukako Lulic.\n18:16 Comment: The ball flies past the goal.\n18:17 Comment: Although it was a serve, not a hit.\n18:19 Comment: Why is there no replacement now?\n18:22 Comment: At this moment Diego Perotti should appear on the field instead of Federico Fazio.\n18:28 Comment: Logical. There is no need to keep three central defenders.\n18:31 Comment: Luciano Spalletti changes the scheme again.\n18:32 Comment: Second time in the match.\n18:34 Comment: Getting back to the game.\n18:36 Comment: Four defenders.\n18:39 Comment: And, accordingly, Perotti, along with Allah and Jekko, will be in the attack.\n18:46 Comment: But at least it's not just a game.\n18:48 Comment: It's a numbers game.\n18:50 Comment: Some may think this is just a numbers game.\n18:53 Comment: But there is a fundamental difference between the formations of two and three central defenders.\n18:57 Comment: And even very experienced football players sometimes say that it is not so easy for them to adapt.\n19:2 Comment: Especially during one match.\n19:4 Comment: Especially back and forth.\n19:6 Comment: But now Roma needs more people in attack.\n19:9 Comment: Therefore, Spalletti does not hesitate to change his defender.\n19:14 Comment: Release.\n19:15 Comment: Well, almost a forward, let's put it that way.\n19:17 Comment: Perotti is almost a striker.\n19:19 Comment: But a real striker.\n19:21 Comment: Or rather, a person without a position.\n19:25 Comment: The man who once became a false nine for

Manages to get ahead of Allah.\n19:43 Comment: How many times could Jekko header today?\n19:44 Comment: Zero.\n19:45 Comment: Because he hides behind defenders all the time.\n19:47 Comment: Because

seamless.\n20:13 Comment: You can already place bets on what minute Francesco Totti will enter the field.\n20:18 Comment: It seems to me that everyone understands that he is needed here, with the exception of one person, Luciano Spalletti.\n20:21 Comment: Many Roma supporters hate Spalletti because he dared to belittle Totti, dared to make him a substitute.\n20:26 Comment: But this is

    "summary": "The Rome derby in the 34th round of the Italian Serie A between AS Roma and Lazio commenced with high anticipation. The initial atmosphere was characterized by a tense yet vibrant energy, emblematic of the historical significance of this fixture. Within the first minute, Lazio’s lone striker, Walde Keita, was flagged for offside as he made an early attempt to break through Roma's defensive line. The calling was marginal, but replays confirmed the decision as correct, marking the precursor to an intensely scrutinized match officiating throughout the game.\n\nEarly moments were indicative of a careful and methodical defensive approach by Lazio, contrasting with Roma’s aggressive offensive stance. With the entire Roman squad advancing into Lazio’s half, Emerson undertook ambitious forward movements, exemplifying his Brazilian flair. Yet, despite Roma's early dominance, Lazio maintained composure, defending competently without showing signs of panic.\n\nEdin Dzeko, Roma's pivotal striker and one of the Serie A top scorers with 25 goals alongside Ciro Immobile of Lazio, whom Simone Inzaghi surprisingly benched, showcased his adept ball-receiving skills but failed to capitalize early on a well-crafted opportunity, shooting centrally instead of to a corner.\n\nLazio's goalkeeper, Thomas Strakosha, filled in admirably for the injured Federico Marchetti, demonstrating his agility with fingertip saves—a reassurance for Lazio’s defensive stability. Despite their inferior possession, Lazio seemed prepared to leverage counterattacks. However, the absence of Ciro Immobile raised eyebrows among spectators and pundits, speculating the tactical shift's implications.\n\nTactical discipline marked the first half, although sparse attacks from Roma through the wings—particularly Mohamed Salah—were vigilantly stifled by Lazio’s backline. Salah’s interplay with Rudiger highlighted Roma's attempts to breach Lazio’s defense but resulted in speculative efforts rather than decisive strikes. Salah’s dribbling provided sporadic sparks, but Lazio’s defenders remained resolute.\n\nIn a pivotal moment, Milinkovic-Savic created space with a rapid counter, checking Salah’s defensive duties who were adept at nullifying potential threats. Tactically, both sides maintained midfield compactness; major credit to Daniele De Rossi's leadership. His pre-match statement underscored his old-school football ethos, balancing the game with combative midfield control.\n\nThe match’s fiery nature was underpinned by passionate remarks, including De Rossi's notorious threats towards teammates misusing social media—emphasizing old-school principles permeating through Roma’s approach to the game. Support from the Curva Sud was noticeably absent as a protest, following the arrest of the Roma fan movement leaders; a silence punctuated by occasional vocal urgings reflecting the rich derby heritage.\n\nThe stadium’s atmosphere intensified at the 12-minute mark, where Walde Keita capitalized in a tight sequence. Receiving the ball, he maneuvered skillfully between defenders, exploiting a slight lapse before finishing with precision, justifying his selection by Inzaghi in Immobile's stead.\n\nDespite trailing, Roma probed persistently, with Salah accelerating down the wing yet again, contending with powerful Lukaku. Strakosha’s continued excellence between the posts thwarted valiant efforts from Salah. Roma persisted with set-piece opportunities, indicative of their dominance in creating corner scenarios yet failing to capitalize significantly.\n\nLazio continued their offensive efforts, largely hinged on quick transitions. The absence of a vocally supportive Curva Sud did little to diminish the tactical robustness Lazio exhibited. Lucas Biglia and Marco Parolo anchored the midfield, ensuring balanced defensive coverage and orchestrating counters effectively.\n\nThe culmination of the first half saw Roma’s relentless pursuit pay off. In a contentious event leading to a penalty, De Rossi seized upon the opportunity unwaveringly, though Strakosha guessed correctly. The goal was greeted with immense fervor from the Roma supporters now engagingly vocal, marking the half-time at an even 1-1.\n\nAs both teams resumed, tactical adjustments marked the second half, reflecting managerial ingenuity from Simone Inzaghi and Luciano Spalletti. Lazio’s defensive trio of De Vrij, Wallace, and Bastos remained compact, while departures from the initial bench included Philippe Anderson injecting creativity due to Jordan Lukaku's injury.\n\nEarly in the second half, Roma’s chances were plentiful but lacked precision. Dzeko's erratic finishing became a recurring motif; notably, missing from close range underscored his inconsistent conversion despite positional excellence. Lazio capitalized yet again in the 48th minute—Dusan Basta, advancing unexpectedly with a deflected strike from Federico Fazio past Szczęsny—an opportunistic finish reflective of Lazio’s advantage-taking mentality.\n\nAs time progressed, Roma's offensive thrust increased, urged by chants calling for Totti’s introduction. Spalletti’s hand was forced; Diego Perotti replaced Federico Fazio, transitioning Roma to a more attack-oriented formation. The anticipation surrounding Totti's involvement grew palpably among the fans, aware of the symbolic weight of potentially his final derby involvement.\n\nHowever, Lazio’s robust backline, along with their midfield linchpins Biglia and Parolo, continued neutralizing Roma’s threats effectively. Despite possession and persistency, Roma's endeavors through crosses scarcely troubled Strakosha decisively.\n\nIn a final defining moment, Lazio’s composure in counterattacks manifested vividly. Lulic’s excellence translated into a lethal assist for Keita, who scored his second goal—a precise demonstration of clinical finishing putting Lazio ahead 3-1. This spellbound the half-filled stadium, dejected on the Roma side.\n\nIn the ensuing moments, Totti entered, cementing his legacy amidst rapturous applause. Despite a valiant effort, including creative interplays primarily facilitated by Salah, the deficit remained insurmountable. Totti’s introduction, while uplifting in spirit, rendered minimal tactical alteration against a disciplined Lazio, on a mission to clinch the derby.\n\nWith the final whistle, Lazio affirmed their superiority in this fiercely contested derby with a 3-1 victory. Despite high hopes pinned on Totti’s magical influence, the pragmatic and well-executed strategy of Lazio, underscored by Keita’s brace and Basta’s momentous contribution, rewarded them the crucial triumph.\n\nSimone Inzaghi's choice for tactical flexibility showcased his managerial acumen. Roma’s struggle to break through reflected severe ramifications in their Scudetto aspirations, underscoring this derby's critical impact on both entries in the Juventus race for points distancing.\n\nIn introspection, this derby bore witness to tactical brilliance, youthful exuberance, seasoned determination, and the fateful emergence of decisions shaping the game dynamics. Reflective of historical rivalries, this bout symbolized the enduring narratives woven into the fabric of Rome’s football heartland."
