There is free space.\n3:59 Comment: But Kulebali is already meeting him.\n4:1 Comment: And it does it quite tightly.\n4:2 Comment: Cool pass.\n4:4 Comment: In theory, yes, he could have gone to the far post if he had sent the ball a little lower.\n4:10 Comment: Icardi.\n4:12 Comment: There was an opportunity for Kondraev to catch on.\n4:16 Comment: Well, it’s a pretty tight fight here, of course.\n4:19 Comment: They probe each other.\n4:22 Comment: T-shirts are checked for strength.\n4:25 Comment: By the way, at one time, including in order to prevent the possibility of clinging to T-shirts,\n4:30 Comment: came up with such tight-fitting shaped sets.\n4:34 Comment: Murillo pauses. Turns around.\n4:38 Comment: And it comes to Samir Khondanovich.\n4:40 Comment: Serious challenge.\n4:45 Comment: I had to bring Hondanovic in the last matches,\n4:48 Comment: because he misses an unusual amount of time.\n4:51 Comment: Two from Torino, two from Samdori, two from Crotone.\n4:55 Comment: Two from Milan.\n4:56 Comment: And as many as five goals in the previous round.\n5:0 Comment: Only for some of the series of missed goals\n5:3 Comment: You can make some claims against the jackdaws of Peru.\n5:6 Comment: Basically, of course, the problems are very serious with defense.\n5:10 Comment: I’m not just on the defensive line, I’m also on the defensive team actions in general.\n5:14 Comment: When \"A\" is ready, he intercepts the ball, but for Zelinsky.\n5:17 Comment: And he throws the ball to his partner.\n5:20 Comment: Usay, Asek Alijon and Murillo.\n5:23 Comment: And that, of course, is all that can be done.\n5:25 Comment: Zelinsky throws the ball to his partner.\n5:28 Comment: Usai, Asek Alikhon avoided being caught offside.\n5:32 Comment: He makes a pass with his left foot and is the first to grab the rebound.\n5:42 Comment: Active on the field in the first minutes.\n5:46 Comment: Moreover, the overwhelming number of attacks take place precisely along the right edge,\n5:52 Comment: where the softened ones work.\n5:53 Comment: Usai, Zelinsky and Jose Alijon move a little to the right.\n6:3 Comment: The Swede cuts this pass from Zelinsky to his partner.\n6:12 Comment: And Inter has a chance for a counterattack.\n6:14 Comment: Kondreva is on the right edge, Kulebali moves towards him.\n6:18 Comment: Kondreva leaves the African.\n6:21 Comment: He picks up the ball back, playing great against the wall.\n6:24 Comment: And not the most obvious solution.\n6:27 Comment: Well, yes, he probably wanted to go into the corridor between the two defenders,\n6:30 Comment: extreme and central, direct the ball for Icardi's dash.\n6:34 Comment: But Icardi wasn’t quite ready there.\n6:37 Comment: There is a violation of the rules in the attack.\n6:39 Comment: Mertens fouls Murillo.\n6:43 Comment: Yes, it's an obvious foul.\n6:45 Comment: A push in the lower back, in the back.\n6:49 Comment: Snokatochka.\n6:51 Comment: Well, we see, yes, the assistant to the chief referee was also included in the frame,\n6:55 Comment: located at the gate.\n6:57 Comment: All this happened before his eyes.\n6:59 Comment: And, in principle, the main one also arrived in time.\n7:1 Comment: Although there was such a fast counterattack.\n7:4 Comment: Interception.\n7:6 Comment: Zelinsky tried. Hamshik back.\n7:8 Comment: Nadya Varam.\n7:10 Comment: Saint-Sin moved here to the middle.\n7:12 Comment: But he is still so fast that, in fact, he corrected the mistake.\n7:15 Comment: The ball was released.\n7:17 Comment: Then he picked him up and made a clear pass to Hamsik.\n7:21 Comment: Readable for opponents.\n7:26 Comment: The game is gaining momentum.\n7:28 Comment: Eighth minute of the match of the 34th round of the Italian Championship.\n7:31 Comment: Inter vs Napoleon.\n7:33 Comment: Meeting of the third and seventh teams of the Championship.\n7:38 Comment: In principle, each of them has the opportunity to rise.\n7:42 Comment: Napoleon will not change his position.\n7:44 Comment: But I’ll repeat it again.\n7:46 Comment: It is very important.\n7:48 Comment: Napoleon has a chance to close the gap with Roma.\n7:50 Comment: With Juventus and its championship.\n7:52 Comment: Everything is already clear.\n7:54 Comment: But the fight is to get directly into the Champions League.\n7:58 Comment: This is an important, dangerous moment.\n8:0 Comment: It could have happened if Icardi had touched the ball, retraining Eduard.\n8:5 Comment: I understand that this is what he wanted to do.\n8:7 Comment: Well, or earn some money for your own family.\n8:11 Comment: If the right flank of Napoleon's attack is active, then we can say exactly the same about Inter.\n8:17 Comment: The right edge, where Kondreeva operates.\n8:19 Comment: D'Ambrosio is also moving there.\n8:22 Comment: This is serious power.\n8:24 Comment: Peperenni's soft discount here.\n8:29 Comment: And the throw is fantastic, probably 50 meters.\n8:34 Comment: Right on Insigne's move.\n8:36 Comment: And he doesn’t pass to Kalifon because he was off-set.\n8:40 Comment: They understood each other.\n8:44 Comment: The attack is already taking place at a different pace.\n8:46 Comment: Zelinsky back.\n8:48 Comment: Husai. Devil.\n8:50 Comment: Husai again.\n8:54 Comment: Edar had already appeared in front of him.\n8:56 Comment: In general, in the defensive phase, Inter players operate essentially in a 4-5-1 formation.\n9:7 Comment: Makes a pass while hitting.\n9:10 Comment: Maybe even slightly bending this most famous cone of Mark Hamshik.\n9:21 Comment: Or no, by the way, the ball hit somewhere in the jaw, not in the forehead.\n9:24 Comment: Here he is, Hamshik with the ball under the left ball.\n9:26 Comment: And past. Past the gate.\n9:28 Comment: In fact, it was not the strongest blow.\n9:30 Comment: And even if this ball was heading towards the corner, it seems to me that the long-armed Khan Daivonovich would have made it in time.\n9:35 Comment: Here's his jump. With reserve. With reserve.\n9:40 Comment: But in any case, this is not the first attempt by the Neapolitans to shoot at Samir’s goal.\n9:48 Comment: Moments arise, chances arise.\n9:51 Comment: But Inter is not asleep either.\n9:53 Comment: In general, of course, many specialists in Italy, and in Russia, and here, or fans of forecasts,\n10:2 Comment: Of course, we agreed that the game should be productive.\n10:5 Comment: Here, firstly, of course, Inter’s recent games hint at this.\n10:10 Comment: The games turn out to be spectacular, with a lot of goals missed and missed by Inter.\n10:17 Comment: Well, Napoli. The style of the Neapolitans is also well known to everyone.\n10:23 Comment: Marek Hamsik recently said in an interview here that Napoli plays the most entertaining football in Europe.\n10:32 Comment: When I read this interview, I immediately asked my colleague Konstantin Genishchev if this was true in his opinion.\n10:37 Comment: He said that Tokarev is playing the most spectacular football right now.\n10:41 Comment: Well, we can debate here. The topic is interesting.\n10:44 Comment: Well, this is a violation of the rules. Jao Mario advances.\n10:48 Comment: He is being pushed. It doesn’t hurt, it doesn’t even push so much as it holds it with your hand.\n10:53 Comment: Almost by the throat. This is definitely a violation of the rules.\n10:57 Comment: Is there anyone to break through? This is, first of all, to Andrey.\n11:0 Comment: And I’m not just talking about the canopy, but specifically about the strike.\n11:5 Comment: We see Cardi, Brozovic, and Eder nearby.\n11:14 Comment: Eder also has a cannon strike.\n11:18 Comment: She has no consistency. But then they bring Nagotom to the strike position.\n11:22 Comment: Why Nagotoma? Not a bad idea.\n11:24 Comment: Not a bad idea.\n11:25 Comment: It seemed to me that there was a bit of a lack of agreement there.\n11:29 Comment: And the first touch was not made in a timely manner.\n11:32 Comment: Eder was not ready for him.\n11:35 Comment: But, yes, he passed the ball further to Nagotom.\n11:37 Comment: But it's pretty clever.\n11:41 Comment: Brozovic. Oh, what a swing from the left serve. Hit!\n11:45 Comment: Past the gate. It might have seemed that the ball dived into this very goal.\n11:50 Comment: And, as I understand it, Cardi struck too.\n11:53 Comment: Galerdini is showing something.\n11:55 Comment: Yes, Mauro and Cardi.\n11:57 Comment: Nine Ner Azzuri.\n12:0 Comment: Black and blue.\n12:1 Comment: He was in a striking position.\n12:3 Comment: And here is Napoleon's answer.\n12:4 Comment: Oh, what a plastic transmission.\n12:6 Comment: Great performance.\n12:8 Comment: This ball could not be processed.\n12:11 Comment: Still, it was difficult, this ball, not only for the opponent, but also for Insini, as far as I understand.\n12:18 Comment: But Naples still owns it.\n12:20 Comment: Napoleon, Gulyam, left foot, cross!\n12:24 Comment: Towards Mertens.\n12:29 Comment: Well, again, the starting rush allows Driss Mertens to instantly jump behind the defenders.\n12:36 Comment: And score, score, score a lot.\n12:43 Comment: Mertens on Ensign.\n12:46 Comment: Incine further to the flank.\n12:48 Comment: Hysai is here.\n12:49 Comment: Napoleon's ball is moving well.\n12:51 Comment: In any case, there is no burden in the middle of the field.\n12:59 Comment: Well, let's say 5-6 gears can be across.\n13:3 Comment: But then you should definitely escalate it.\n13:6 Comment: We had a moment of gamshik.\n13:8 Comment: There were situations at the beginning of the game when they shot dangerously a couple of times from the right flank.\n13:13 Comment: Mertens couldn't keep up.\n13:14 Comment: So far, Napoleon's football looks a little more respectful.\n13:17 Comment: But Inter does not give up counter play at all.\n13:21 Comment: Well, and here, for example, is a blow after a standard on an alter card.\n13:24 Comment: Not a bad application from the gumsha to touch the pass.\n13:27 Comment: Mertens immediately turns around.\n13:29 Comment: And Insigne gets to the ball first.\n13:33 Comment: How original he performed it.\n13:35 Comment: But I think those of you who have been watching Napoleon in general and Insigne in particular for a long time,\n13:42 Comment: They understand that such a trick, such a decision from him, is not news.\n13:48 Comment: That's how he scored.\n13:50 Comment: And we remember the corner of the Real Madrid goal in the first match.\n13:53 Comment: In other meetings.\n13:56 Comment: This is what both Mertens and Insigne do.\n13:58 Comment: They don't like to throw the ball over goals.\n14:1 Comment: Long pass forward.\n14:2 Comment: Nagotomo fights with his opponent.\n14:5 Comment: This is Zelinsky.\n14:7 Comment: The Neapolitans mainly focus on football\n14:10 Comment: The Neapolitans always have the middle of the field in their rotation.\n14:14 Comment: There is strong competition here.\n14:17 Comment: Here you and Jorginho.\n14:22 Comment: Here you have Marquez Allen.\n14:24 Comment: They are both on the bench today.\n14:27 Comment: If desired, El Jocherini can also play.\n14:32 Comment: Well, today it’s just such a trio – Zelinsky, Diawara and Hamshik.\n14:37 Comment: Zelinsky.\n14:41 Comment: Kolikhon somehow acted smugly.\n14:42 Comment: I could compete for this ball here.\n14:45 Comment: It wasn't the most inconvenient transfer.\n14:48 Comment: But here Colijon corrects himself.\n14:51 Comment: A series of air combats.\n14:53 Comment: Diawara puts on the back and cardio.\n14:55 Comment: There is no violation of the rules.\n14:57 Comment: And a blow.\n14:59 Comment: An attempt from Joao Mario, who was quite active in the first minutes.\n15:6 Comment: Portuguese.\n15:7 Comment: By the way, with Angolan roots.\n15:10 Comment: European champion with the Portuguese national team in 2016.\n15:19 Comment: This is a repeat of the beat and cardi.\n15:21 Comment: We see that he really didn’t hit his header.\n15:23 Comment: It was more of a shoulder strike.\n15:27 Comment: Well, who knows, if, as they say in our football, the ball had hit the corner of the head,\n15:33 Comment: Maybe it would have bounced back to where it needed to be.\n15:37 Comment: Eder wins another horse fight.\n15:42 Comment: Helps his defense a lot.\n15:46 Comment: 15 starting minutes are behind us.\n15:49 Comment: Well, not to say that Napoli had a direct assault.\n15:51 Comment: But Napoli, in its own style, tries to hide the opponents’ defense in the first minutes.\n15:57 Comment: Will there be a selection here?\n15:58 Comment: Yes, he's interested.\n15:59 Comment: This is Eder on Joao Mario.\n16:1 Comment: Was it played dangerously?\n16:3 Comment: But the Portuguese has no complaints here.\n16:5 Comment: The Portuguese tried his best.\n16:7 Comment: Another inaccurate pass.\n16:8 Comment: Brozovich!\n16:10 Comment: He looked at Icardi, but was still turning around while preparing to pass.\n16:15 Comment: Although everything was basically done quickly.\n16:17 Comment: Icardi had already been grabbed, and the transfer was not the most convenient.\n16:25 Comment: This match has a decent pace.\n16:30 Comment: I even follow, let’s say, the commentator’s feelings.\n16:34 Comment: Because we, too, are called to always feel some pauses,\n16:38 Comment: where we can tell stories.\n16:39 Comment: But this is where all the main stories on the field happen.\n16:42 Comment: Because if the transmission were a little weaker,\n16:45 Comment: the fleet-footed Lorenzo Insinnia would fight one-on-one with Hondanovic.\n16:50 Comment: The Slovenian goalkeeper is in place.\n16:52 Comment: He has a great feel for the game, of course.\n16:54 Comment: Those moments when you need to get out of your own goalkeeper.\n16:59 Comment: Although he is a rather large, powerful goalkeeper.\n17:2 Comment: Heavy.\n17:5 Comment: They almost delivered it.\n17:7 Comment: An Inter player's own goal shot.\n17:10 Comment: This is Medel.\n17:11 Comment: Well, basically, with such a lightweight attack, Napoles Medel.\n17:16 Comment: What Inter needs.\n17:17 Comment: Although he often plays in the lineup.\n17:23 Comment: There is no need to fight for any top balls here.\n17:27 Comment: The Neapolitans will have little supply.\n17:29 Comment: Here you need, as they say, to stand firmly on the ground.\n17:34 Comment: And keep up with the fast-paced forums.\n17:37 Comment: Kulebolim on the left edge.\n17:39 Comment: The Neapolitans Insinia or Ghulam figured it out here.\n17:43 Comment: Any one of them could have caught it.\n17:47 Comment: Kulebolim on Raul Albeol.\n17:50 Comment: Good first pass.\n17:51 Comment: Zelinsky plays in touch with Diavaran.\n17:53 Comment: Continue to Gulyama.\n17:55 Comment: There is an offer from Insinia.\n17:57 Comment: Insiny likes to start his raids from about this zone.\n18:2 Comment: Towards the opponent's goal.\n18:4 Comment: It's being played out somewhere.\n18:5 Comment: Hanshek.\n18:6 Comment: Delivery to the far post.\n18:7 Comment: Calihon.\n18:8 Comment: One is processing.\n18:9 Comment: Lumbago.\n18:10 Comment: And it was a scoring chance.\n18:12 Comment: It was a scoring chance.\n18:14 Comment: Of course, Little Mertons didn't have enough blame for his legs here.\n18:19 Comment: The movement did it right.\n18:21 Comment: Absolutely correct movement.\n18:23 Comment: He was not caught offside.\n18:25 Comment: But at the same time, in fact, he was ahead of the defender.\n18:28 Comment: Just literally about 10 centimeters was not enough.\n18:32 Comment: There are already empty gates there.\n18:33 Comment: And 1-0.\n18:34 Comment: One of the best attacks of the Neapolitans in this match.\n18:38 Comment: Rozion Amedela is there.\n18:39 Comment: We have to knock it out.\n18:41 Comment: The rival Inter is under pressure.\n18:43 Comment: Almost all field players are in the home team's half of the field.\n18:48 Comment: Yes, yes, and without forgetting, for a second.\n18:52 Comment: Match for Inter.\n18:54 Comment: Your own home.\n18:59 Comment: Well, it’s unlikely that there were any pleasant feelings from the first meeting this season with Napoleon.\n19:5 Comment: The fact is that in the 15th round, it was in December,\n19:9 Comment: Naples defeated Inter with a score of 3-0.\n19:12 Comment: 3-0.\n19:13 Comment: And then the opening five minutes was absolutely fantastic.\n19:20 Comment: Because by the fifth minute Naples was leading 2-0.\n19:23 Comment: Zerinsky scored in the second minute.\n19:26 Comment: And on the fifth he made an assist to Gansha.\n19:29 Comment: Well, that's essentially all.\n19:32 Comment: And in the second half Lorenzo Insi added his own goal.\n19:37 Comment: There were quite a few yellow cards there.\n19:39 Comment: Inter kicked and tried.\n19:41 Comment: By the way, he had his moments there.\n19:42 Comment: Enough.\n19:43 Comment: But, in the end, a dry victory for Naples.\n19:47 Comment: Harry Medel on Murilla.\n19:50 Comment: Joe Miranda is not playing today.\n19:52 Comment: Inter's main central defender.\n19:55 Comment: Defender of the Brazilian national team.\n19:59 Comment: This is definitely a loss.\n20:1 Comment: Eder.\n20:5 Comment: Galliardini.\n20:6 Comment: He has a good mid-range shot.\n20:9 Comment: Just from about 30 meters away.\n20:13 Comment: I don’t remember scoring, but it can be done.\n20:15 Comment: The counterattack failed.\n20:17 Comment: Eder and Brozovic did a great job here.\n20:20 Comment: Brozovic, he's with the ball.\n20:22 Comment: Overall.\n20:23 Comment: Elegantly avoids a collision with Insigne.\n20:26 Comment: Insigne, too, apparently, is working out.\n20:28 Comment: Works well without the ball.\n20:30 Comment: Galliardini.\n20:31 Comment: Murillier.\n20:33 Comment: Murillier, in fact, changed the starting line-up.\n20:36 Comment: Miranda.\n20:44 Comment: Oh, what a fit!\n20:45 Comment: One-on-one exit.\n20:46 Comment: And Handanovich!\n20:49 Comment: Handanovich has an absolutely animalistic jerk and leap forward.\n20:56 Comment: Something so wildly feline.\n21:2 Comment: A terrible jump to the feet, which, if, let’s say, it wasn’t accurate, perfectly calculated,\n21:12 Comment: then, of course, it could have ended in a penalty.\n21:14 Comment: Because, it seems, Mertens was already the first on the ball.\n21:18 Comment: He was ready to swerve to the side.\n21:21 Comment: But Handanovic caught the ball just when it was at Mertens’ feet.\n21:28 Comment: Kondreeva.\n21:29 Comment: Kondreeva runs on the right sideline.\n21:31 Comment: Antonio passes and wins a corner.\n21:36 Comment: Yes, what a great pass it was to Mertens.\n21:39 Comment: Kelihon catches the ball here.\n21:41 Comment: Accelerates and passes to Dris.\n21:44 Comment: Now, it seems, he manages to give it a lift.\n21:46 Comment: I wanted to give you a lift, yes.\n21:48 Comment: Pick the ball over Handanovic.\n21:50 Comment: But it’s not for nothing that Samir is one of the most stable, best goalkeepers in the series in recent seasons.\n21:56 Comment: Submission from Kondreeva.\n21:58 Comment: Famous for his excellent crosses from the right touchline and set pieces.\n22:3 Comment: Can hang it as needed.\n22:6 Comment: This weapon is also the most important for Inter.\n22:9 Comment: Mcinni.\n22:11 Comment: Waiting.\n22:12 Comment: Near Diawara.\n22:14 Comment: 23 minutes 0-0 in the Internapole match.\n22:17 Comment: And throw it behind Mogotom's back.\n22:19 Comment: Here.\n22:21 Comment: Got out.\n22:22 Comment: I got the ball.\n22:26 Comment: Diawara.\n22:28 Comment: Gamshik.\n22:33 Comment: Handle Zelinsky's ball more carefully here.\n22:35 Comment: That's it, two defenders would have been cut off.\n22:38 Comment: And all they could do was foul.\n22:40 Comment: But in the end, I lost the ball a little.\n22:42 Comment: Kondreeva.\n22:43 Comment: Another attempt.\n22:44 Comment: Pepereina.\n22:45 Comment: On the second attempt, he only fixes the ball.\n22:49 Comment: And, in my opinion, Carr was already ready to overtake this rebound.\n22:55 Comment: Well, we have practically no middle field.\n22:59 Comment: Game without delays in this zone.\n23:3 Comment: Very quickly, at a pace.\n23:5 Comment: And we see that this is probably one of Inter’s main mistakes.\n23:9 Comment: He allows the opponent, including running,\n23:12 Comment: build attacks at speed.\n23:14 Comment: And in Naples, in counterplay, he is very dangerous.\n23:18 Comment: The heel transfer did not go through.\n23:20 Comment: This is a loss.\n23:21 Comment: 13 losses in the 24th moment of the game.\n23:25 Comment: By 13.\n23:26 Comment: A bit much.\n23:28 Comment: It is difficult, of course, to stretch any of the excuses.\n23:33 Comment: Why is that? There are a lot of losses.\n23:35 Comment: Worried? No.\n23:36 Comment: Tired?\n23:37 Comment: We are still in season.\n23:38 Comment: Maybe, but at the pace it still shows good things.\n23:44 Comment: There is another version.\n23:46 Comment: Inter and Napoleon are just playing for fun.\n23:49 Comment: They try to take a lot of risks when building combinations.\n23:54 Comment: Hence the losses.\n23:56 Comment: Still, there is a feeling that there will be enough goals today.\n24:1 Comment: Insignia deftly left.\n24:3 Comment: Brozovic lay flat.\n24:5 Comment: Insignia continues his transverse travels.\n24:9 Comment: And a blow.\n24:10 Comment: It's very difficult in this situation.\n24:13 Comment: Of course, it was possible to get into the door.\n24:15 Comment: But this is to score a goal.\n24:17 Comment: So that the moment really is shared.\n24:19 Comment: Although, in theory, Gamshik was in the goalkeeper's room.\n24:24 Comment: But still the attempt counts.\n24:27 Comment: Another moment.\n24:28 Comment: Another situation that could potentially become shared.\n24:32 Comment: Ellir Diniem has a seseder.\n24:35 Comment: If Kondreva, a player on the right flank and attack,\n24:40 Comment: He, of course, runs more around the edge.\n24:44 Comment: Always gets the ball in play.\n24:46 Comment: Eder actually works more in opposition attacks with the ball.\n24:51 Comment: He has good control too.\n24:53 Comment: A technical football player.\n24:54 Comment: He also has a pass.\n24:55 Comment: Of course, an excellent blow.\n24:57 Comment: Forward of the Italian national team.\n25:0 Comment: Like Kondreva, midfielder of the Italian national team.\n25:5 Comment: Inter's squad is very decent.\n25:8 Comment: Whatever the state of the team,\n25:10 Comment: no matter where she occupies,\n25:12 Comment: there are still some top level footballers,\n25:17 Comment: who could also play in the starting lineup at other top clubs.\n25:23 Comment: Napoleon with the ball.\n25:25 Comment: Zelinsky on...\n25:27 Comment: Lyuboli.\n25:29 Comment: Further. This is Incinia.\n25:30 Comment: The blue is sinking deeper and deeper,\n25:32 Comment: helping the attacking defensive midfielders get started.\n25:36 Comment: Albiol on the right side.\n25:39 Comment: This is Albanian Hyusa.\n25:43 Comment: Murillo is practically on his knees.\n25:45 Comment: While located, this transmission is blocked,\n25:47 Comment: counterattack begins.\n25:48 Comment: Runs up to Ambrosio.\n25:50 Comment: And he asks for a transfer to Andreev.\n25:52 Comment: Andreeva must be given to Ambrosio.\n25:54 Comment: But too much.\n25:55 Comment: Enough to leave the ball in the field.\n25:57 Comment: Pass to Mario.\n25:58 Comment: He is losing the fight.\n25:59 Comment: And Kaliphon is right there.\n26:2 Comment: It seems to me that Califon has now won.\n26:4 Comment: I think this is a simulation.\n26:6 Comment: There was a shoulder-to-shoulder collision.\n26:10 Comment: Let's see.\n26:15 Comment: Tass set it up a little.\n26:17 Comment: Inter player.\n26:19 Comment: Okay, maybe, of course, he’s not faking it.\n26:23 Comment: But here Hamshik was on the verge, on the verge of being offside.\n26:27 Comment: Of course, I tried to look at it here too.\n26:29 Comment: In theory, he put his body forward a little.\n26:32 Comment: During my sprint.\n26:35 Comment: Well, after all, even if your nose is offside,\n26:38 Comment: This is a violation of the rule.\n26:40 Comment: Because the nose is the part of the body that can be clogged.\n26:43 Comment: As well as rockets, by the way.\n26:45 Comment: Albeol.\n26:48 Comment: Zelinsky handles a difficult ball.\n26:51 Comment: This is something he has, of course, in complete order with.\n26:53 Comment: So it is with handling, in general with working with the ball.\n26:58 Comment: A technical player.\n26:59 Comment: He grew up in front of Serie A fans in Dinez.\n27:8 Comment: Last season he was quite successful in Empel.\n27:12 Comment: Well, in Naples he also scores and assists.\n27:15 Comment: Appears regularly on the field.\n27:23 Comment: Interception after interception, error after error.\n27:26 Comment: And still 0-0.\n27:27 Comment: 28th minute.\n27:30 Comment: Incini.\n27:31 Comment: The ball is being dragged.\n27:32 Comment: Incini, Incini.\n27:33 Comment: He knows very well that he needs to protect his right leg.\n27:37 Comment: He has this favorite maneuver.\n27:39 Comment: Take it sharply under the right into the center of the field and punch.\n27:44 Comment: How many of these balls did he hit?\n27:46 Comment: Incini, by the way, is a different story.\n27:48 Comment: I'll tell you after this attack.\n27:51 Comment: Maybe Lorenzo Zelinsky will try to complete it.\n27:56 Comment: Back pass to Polyak.\n27:58 Comment: And Murillo plays hard and earns the head.\n28:3 Comment: Lorenzo Incini hasn't been playing very well these days.\n28:7 Comment: Lorenzo Insini recently signed a new contract with the team until 2022.\n28:16 Comment: He, of course, is on board, a non-politan.\n28:18 Comment: You know everything perfectly well.\n28:19 Comment: True, he had different stages.\n28:21 Comment: It happened that even the bencher became angry.\n28:26 Comment: Little on the field, rarely appeared on the field.\n28:28 Comment: He scored few goals.\n28:29 Comment: And he also had problems with fans.\n28:32 Comment: At a certain point.\n28:33 Comment: Now he is certainly one of the main stars of Napoli.\n28:37 Comment: One of the most profitable players.\n28:42 Comment: And one of the leaders.\n28:44 Comment: Serving from the corner store.\n28:47 Comment: With a strong spin, the ball hits the goal line towards Albeol.\n28:51 Comment: The rebound is due to Diawar.\n28:53 Comment: At Livali's.\n28:54 Comment: Livali has a soft pass to the far post.\n28:58 Comment: Runs into the area where the ball was heading towards Alikhon.\n29:0 Comment: But the selection.\n29:1 Comment: The rebound came from Fauzi Gulyamov, who stayed after the corner kick.\n29:7 Comment: Amazing story.\n29:8 Comment: I still can’t understand it.\n29:10 Comment: Mertens is on the team.\n29:12 Comment: Insigne is on the team.\n29:14 Comment: Football players less than 170 cm tall.\n29:18 Comment: Why not set standards for them?\n29:21 Comment: They can also set good spin on the ball.\n29:23 Comment: They can also make a good pitch.\n29:25 Comment: Instead, anyone serves.\n29:29 Comment: Strinich served the Japanese.\n29:31 Comment: Serves it to the ghouls.\n29:32 Comment: The full backs, who are pretty tough guys themselves.\n29:36 Comment: And they can turn there into the penalty area.\n29:38 Comment: There they would be of more use than the low-status Mertens and Insigne.\n29:43 Comment: Well, here it is offside, which ends up with Mauro and Candreva.\n29:48 Comment: I'm sorry.\n29:49 Comment: Antonio Candreva.\n29:50 Comment: Kandreva also has a great feel for the game.\n29:53 Comment: And when necessary, it shifts to the central zone.\n29:56 Comment: He scores very well.\n29:58 Comment: Gives away no less.\n30:0 Comment: This is his first season at Inter.\n30:3 Comment: And the season is very, very productive.\n30:7 Comment: In more detail, Candreva has already scored 6 goals this season.\n30:11 Comment: And he made 10 assists.\n30:13 Comment: 16 points according to the Gold Plus Pass system for 33 games.\n30:17 Comment: Not bad.\n30:18 Comment: Long pass.\n30:19 Comment: Translation.\n30:22 Comment: Somewhere in the direction of Handanovich.\n30:24 Comment: Where none of the attackers ran into the dust.\n30:42 Comment: So that's the story.\n30:43 Comment: The Nepolitans continue to press.\n30:45 Comment: Even if it didn’t get as crazy as it was around 20 minutes.\n30:49 Comment: And so.\n30:50 Comment: Counterattack.\n30:51 Comment: Impact position, by the way.\n30:52 Comment: But pass to Kandreva.\n30:53 Comment: Antonio tried to return, it seems to me, towards Icardi.\n30:59 Comment: The fans are making noise.\n31:1 Comment: They are indignant, demanding a penalty.\n31:4 Comment: But let's not rush.\n31:5 Comment: Let's watch the replay.\n31:7 Comment: Well, we see, we are rocks.\n31:10 Comment: By the way, one of those referees who won’t think for a long time,\n31:14 Comment: if there is a reason for a penalty.\n31:18 Comment: But in the end he threw up his hands.\n31:20 Comment: No 11 meters.\n31:22 Comment: This is another episode.\n31:23 Comment: There is a lot of struggle here.\n31:25 Comment: Here Hamshik pressed the ball with his foot.\n31:30 Comment: He also demonstrated some elements of break dancing.\n31:34 Comment: Watch, of course, the fight episode with the ball possibly hitting your hand.\n31:39 Comment: In the penalty area.\n31:42 Comment: Napoleon is not playing like an away team.\n31:45 Comment: Forward with great strength.\n31:47 Comment: But we know that for Neapolitans there is not much difference.\n31:54 Comment: They play at home or away.\n31:56 Comment: They always act in their own style.\n31:59 Comment: I even remember in Madrid in the first match.\n32:5 Comment: Against Real Madrid.\n32:7 Comment: During these periods they played very actively with the ball.\n32:11 Comment: They tried to suppress the opponent.\n32:13 Comment: What came out of it is another matter.\n32:16 Comment: They played on the left sideline.\n32:22 Comment: Here, too, Gulyam and Insine interact quite well.\n32:27 Comment: They have been playing on the same sideline for a dozen matches in Medel.\n32:37 Comment: So, here he is, here he is. Repeat.\n32:39 Comment: Not really. No.\n32:40 Comment: The ball hits.\n32:42 Comment: Some might call this hand position unnatural.\n32:46 Comment: But Ghulyam tried with all his might to take this ball, this hand away from the ball.\n32:52 Comment: That is, to minimize the chances of the ball contacting your hand.\n32:56 Comment: After all, where can they put these same hands?\n33:0 Comment: Well, perhaps an additional factor.\n33:3 Comment: Still, he did not increase the body area.\n33:5 Comment: I squeezed this hand.\n33:6 Comment: So, in my opinion, Rocky got it figured out.\n33:9 Comment: And his assistant.\n33:11 Comment: Kyusai on Zielinski.\n33:13 Comment: Zielinski turns around skillfully.\n33:15 Comment: There is Gamshik nearby.\n33:17 Comment: Acute transmission. Free kick.\n33:19 Comment: And past the thief.\n33:21 Comment: The ball even hits the goalkeeper.\n33:23 Comment: Was Mertons offside?\n33:25 Comment: That's what's interesting.\n33:27 Comment: No.\n33:29 Comment: And a fantastic pass to Zielinski.\n33:32 Comment: Fantastic.\n33:33 Comment: Past three Inter defenders.\n33:36 Comment: By the way, in my opinion, in the end it was still offside.\n33:39 Comment: No.\n33:41 Comment: I didn’t start from the Inter penalty box, in my opinion.\n33:44 Comment: But Zielinski executed the pass magnificently.\n33:48 Comment: This is probably his main quality.\n33:50 Comment: The ability to make timely, accurate passes.\n33:56 Comment: And so we see that, albeit at an angle,\n33:59 Comment: but still one on one with Handanovich to get to the floor.\n34:3 Comment: Mertons threw the ball over him and hit the post.\n34:7 Comment: Great attack.\n34:9 Comment: 35th minute.\n34:11 Comment: Inter with the ball.\n34:13 Comment: Kondreva.\n34:15 Comment: If I blow him away.\n34:20 Comment: Several position changes.\n34:22 Comment: And Kondreva is already in the zone of responsibility of the right defense.\n34:26 Comment: Essentially, D'Ambrosio pushed forward.\n34:28 Comment: And, in my opinion, Mbrozovich was also there nearby.\n34:34 Comment: Today we could probably see Ivan Peresic in the starting lineup.\n34:41 Comment: Croatian attacking midfielder.\n34:46 Comment: The last time he started a game from the bench was in the 16th round.\n34:53 Comment: It was a home game with Sajeno.\n34:55 Comment: And then he came out in the 57th minute.\n34:58 Comment: But after that there were a lot of matches where he appeared on the field from the first minutes,\n35:4 Comment: and in many of them he played until the final whistle.\n35:7 Comment: Today Peresic is in reserve.\n35:10 Comment: Like Cantecbia, Banega.\n35:18 Comment: Well, for example, the same Palacio.\n35:28 Comment: I saw the orbiter here was offside.\n35:34 Comment: Let's watch the replay.\n35:36 Comment: Mertens did everything well.\n35:38 Comment: But we see that here the ball was spinning away from the goal.\n35:42 Comment: That is why the ball went off the desired Mertens trajectory and only hit the post and not the goal.\n35:50 Comment: Naples' statistics here in Milan are certainly not the most impressive.\n35:55 Comment: I mean the games with Inter at Juze Pomeac.\n35:58 Comment: Yes, they beat Inter in the first round with a score of 3-0.\n36:1 Comment: But if we turn to the statistics of the new millennium, let’s call it\n36:8 Comment: in this very new millennium for all the away matches with Inter\n36:14 Comment: Napoli achieved just one victory.\n36:16 Comment: It was in 2011, the victory was 3-0.\n36:19 Comment: Insigne!\n36:21 Comment: A few tricks and tricks.\n36:24 Comment: He threw the ball past two opponents at once, or even tossed it, but the shot didn’t work out.\n36:33 Comment: There was one thing Guilherdi didn't beat.\n36:36 Comment: And the pass, by the way, was quite convenient.\n36:46 Comment: I will give you a contract until 2022.\n36:49 Comment: Although many said that it was time for Insigne to try himself in a foreign championship.\n36:55 Comment: And different rumors were said, different rumors appeared.\n37:0 Comment: These rumors were sent to England and to Spain.\n37:5 Comment: Of course, the player is very technical.\n37:8 Comment: Of course, there must be a specific team in which he will end up.\n37:12 Comment: Different, yes, in comparison with Napoleon.\n37:15 Comment: Still, Insigne is one of the personifications of this style of combinational meaning of maneuvers and so on.\n37:22 Comment: Passage along the right flank.\n37:24 Comment: This is Zelinsky, the tireless Zelinsky.\n37:26 Comment: The ball is under the left, strikes, takes the breath away, in my opinion, of Muril.\n37:32 Comment: The Colombian is ready to continue the match on the right side.\n37:36 Comment: Kontreva switches to third speed and stops.\n37:39 Comment: Nobody supported him.\n37:42 Comment: Only after a pause does this attack gain new breath.\n37:46 Comment: Eldar on the left edge.\n37:48 Comment: Will there be a feed? Borisovich chooses.\n37:51 Comment: Waits for Nagotom to run in and waits for him.\n37:54 Comment: The Japanese is in no hurry with the ball either.\n37:57 Comment: Positional attack, 39th minute.\n37:59 Comment: Inter has the ball, they are playing at home with Napoleon in a draw.\n38:2 Comment: So far, the momentum advantage has been created.\n38:5 Comment: Of course, the Neapolitans don't want it to be a draw.\n38:7 Comment: But of course he must.\n38:9 Comment: Of course, the Neapolitans. Nakedness.\n38:14 Comment: Epiphany\n38:22 Comment: And here it is, sending it to the far post.\n38:25 Comment: Another corner earned.\n38:28 Comment: There are enough rooters, some and others.\n38:31 Comment: Well, it seems that the execution is still more dangerous than the standard.\n38:34 Comment: Milantsev.\n38:36 Comment: Because they have Icardia, because they have Murillo.\n38:40 Comment: Galerdin E might jump out great .\n38:43 Comment: It’s not like jumping out, but the growth is also good.\n38:46 Comment: Andreeva serves in the direction of Murillo.\n38:50 Comment: He finds himself on the lawn again.\n38:52 Comment: But it turns out he doesn't rise so quickly.\n38:55 Comment: And Gian-Luca Rocky stops the game.\n39:0 Comment: Apparently it's back.\n39:2 Comment: Apparently, paying attention to Jason Murillo.\n39:7 Comment: He's not okay.\n39:20 Comment: Let's see how it happened.\n39:22 Comment: Oh, they collided heads with kulebali.\n39:26 Comment: As I understand it, yes, I just grabbed hold of the lock.\n39:28 Comment: You can get a slight concussion after such collisions.\n39:38 Comment: Both bones are occipital and frontal, they are, of course, very, very powerful.\n39:50 Comment: Sparks flew.\n39:52 Comment: For Jason Murillo, this is the 25th game in the Italian Championship this season.\n39:58 Comment: He started 20 matches.\n40:1 Comment: So far I have not scored a goal or assist.\n40:5 Comment: Just yellow cards.\n40:8 Comment: True, not much, 4 pieces.\n40:12 Comment: And the previous time in the starting lineup, he came to the game against Roma in the 26th round.\n40:20 Comment: Oh, we see, it turns out there are also cuts.\n40:24 Comment: I saw blood.\n40:25 Comment: But Jason probably has a reason to put a net like this on his head.\n40:34 Comment: And then, by the way, in that match when Murillo started,\n40:38 Comment: Inter lost by 2 goals to Roma.\n40:42 Comment: Based on 1-3 houses.\n40:46 Comment: On the finished \"Amp\".\n40:48 Comment: Low gear.\n40:50 Comment: Vicardi is not always great at clinging today.\n40:52 Comment: But here he rudely substitutes and also loses the ball.\n40:55 Comment: And, wasn’t there, yes, there was a violation of the rules on Mertens.\n41:0 Comment: Mertens, in fact, does not need to place his body, back, or hip rigidly.\n41:6 Comment: He just jumps first on the ball very cleverly.\n41:10 Comment: It is very difficult, of course, to grab onto it.\n41:13 Comment: Although this was ultimately done by Chiliy Smedel.\n41:16 Comment: By the throat, this Belgian practically dug into the throat.\n41:19 Comment: And I broke the rule.\n41:21 Comment: 42nd minute.\n41:23 Comment: We see Murillo.\n41:25 Comment: Looks like he's back in the game.\n41:27 Comment: Even if the injury is minor.\n41:30 Comment: But we also see other damage.\n41:38 Comment: Insignem.\n41:40 Comment: Today he is, of course, the main creative force in Naples.\n41:42 Comment: A lot of contact with the ball.\n41:44 Comment: Attempts to pass the ball into the penalty area.\n41:47 Comment: But so far, Zelinsky has probably been more successful in this regard.\n41:51 Comment: Gabshik.\n41:53 Comment: Insigne, run from Ghulyam.\n41:55 Comment: We'll wait.\n41:57 Comment: No, he leaves him alone against two opponents.\n42:0 Comment: Against the defender and his belay.\n42:4 Comment: The same Insigna.\n42:7 Comment: Kulebalim on Albiol.\n42:13 Comment: No, just start yourself.\n42:14 Comment: Mertens seems to be speaking.\n42:16 Comment: Instantly returning the ball.\n42:18 Comment: Albiol, diagonal to the left edge.\n42:20 Comment: Here is Insigna.\n42:22 Comment: For a short time he was alone with De Abrosio.\n42:24 Comment: True, here is a proposal.\n42:26 Comment: By weight.\n42:28 Comment: Offer from a partner.\n42:30 Comment: Oh, what a moment and a goal!\n42:32 Comment: Yuta Nagotoma makes a terrible mistake.\n42:35 Comment: A Se Calihon.\n42:38 Comment: She's under guard.\n42:40 Comment: Well, this is a gift in its purest form.\n42:42 Comment: In a match where Inter seemed to mostly cope with this formidable attack on the field.\n42:49 Comment: The Milanese simply gave this ball as a gift.\n42:53 Comment: Let's see how it was.\n42:55 Comment: Insigne moves.\n42:57 Comment: Well, everything, everything is blocked.\n42:59 Comment: First on the ball is Nagotoma.\n43:1 Comment: And here's the cut.\n43:3 Comment: I wish I could understand in my head, get into the Japanese’s room, what he wanted to do.\n43:6 Comment: I wanted to handle the ball.\n43:8 Comment: Or just knock it out to the side.\n43:9 Comment: But it turned out to be a perfect assist to Jose Calijon.\n43:14 Comment: The score for the match is open.\n43:20 Comment: Spaniard José Calijon scored his 11th league goal in his 30th game.\n43:27 Comment: Impressive performance.\n43:29 Comment: Moreover, it remains approximately at this level every season.\n43:33 Comment: 10 assists for him too.\n43:34 Comment: But could it be otherwise hot in one of the regular players of the base.\n43:42 Comment: Such an attacking team as NAPP.\n43:45 Comment: Nudity. We need to improve.\n43:48 Comment: We need to improve.\n43:50 Comment: Experienced defender.\n43:52 Comment: Anything happened in his career too.\n43:55 Comment: And red cards are out of place, and mistakes.\n43:59 Comment: But mainly, of course, it is famous for its reliability.\n44:2 Comment: And connections to attack.\n44:5 Comment: This is only Nagotom's 12th league match.\n44:9 Comment: In fact, he often suffered from injuries last season.\n44:13 Comment: And the 8th game is based.\n44:20 Comment: You can, for example, visit.\n44:24 Comment: There is not enough practice, but it all seems like an excuse, nothing more.\n44:29 Comment: Dombrov.\n44:30 Comment: Still, the ball catches up and gets it back from Kondreeva.\n44:34 Comment: Dombrov.\n44:36 Comment: And Ganshik does a great job here.\n44:38 Comment: Another corner turn by Pepe Rainham.\n44:41 Comment: Here is the very end of the first half.\n44:45 Comment: Well, let's see.\n44:47 Comment: How he runs. Galerdini prepares to lunge.\n44:51 Comment: Murilyu’s rewound head also slides down.\n44:55 Comment: And so, of course, basically, basically, basically,\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Second half of the Inter-Napoli match, round 34, April 30, Sunday, 1-0, in favor of the guests from Naples behind Jose Calijon.\n0:13 Comment: The only goal so far in this match, let me remind you, is his 11th goal in the championship.\n0:18 Comment: Antonio Condreva close-up, he is one of those who leads the team, it seems, in this game, leads the way.\n0:26 Comment: He makes a lot of offers, opens great, broke a couple, served, crossed.\n0:33 Comment: But this didn’t lead to goals, or even scoring chances.\n0:41 Comment: Stefana Pioli vs Maurizio Sari, it's a coaching duel.\n0:45 Comment: And Gian-Luca Rocchi is the main referee of this meeting, so far he is not in the spotlight.\n0:49 Comment: In fact, he didn’t demonstrate a single yellow one.\n0:55 Comment: Which, by the way, happens to be wrong with him.\n0:56 Comment: But of course this is more common.\n0:57 Comment: Dmitry Shnyakin at the microphone.\n0:59 Comment: Oh, a gross violation of the rules.\n1:2 Comment: It could, of course, lead to serious injury.\n1:5 Comment: Still, step on the Achilles with thorns.\n1:7 Comment: But here, in my opinion, it’s not on the Achilles, but simply on the protected heel of the boot.\n1:12 Comment: So it’s not so painful for Ghulam.\n1:18 Comment: It was him.\n1:20 Comment: Nagotoma, center field, Galerdini.\n1:21 Comment: Galerdini.\n1:24 Comment: Well, there were segments.\n1:26 Comment: At the end of the first half, when Inter also played ball control,\n1:29 Comment: I tried my hand at positional attacks.\n1:31 Comment: Well, it’s not like there are many original ideas.\n1:35 Comment: And Cardi once again loses the ball.\n1:37 Comment: It wasn't the most convenient pass, of course.\n1:39 Comment: To the tonsils, as football players say.\n1:43 Comment: But, nevertheless, Cardi doesn’t know how to accept people like that either.\n1:45 Comment: Murillo!\n1:47 Comment: A horseman with a rewound head.\n1:49 Comment: Pushes forward.\n1:51 Comment: He received cut damage after colliding with Kulebali.\n1:56 Comment: Thanks a lot.\n1:56 Comment: Great director.\n1:59 Comment: Well, Kulebali is also a cast iron head.\n2:3 Comment: Go with this one.\n2:5 Comment: Here the players of Inter and Naples are warming up.\n2:10 Comment: By the way, let me tell you at the same time who can join either one or the other team.\n2:15 Comment: Goalkeepers.\n2:16 Comment: Inter has only one goalkeeper in reserve.\n2:18 Comment: This is Karisom.\n2:20 Comment: Defenders of Andreoli.\n2:22 Comment: Sainsbury's.\n2:24 Comment: Yao.\n2:25 Comment: Midfielders.\n2:26 Comment: Indek Biya.\n2:27 Comment: Bonega.\n2:28 Comment: Peresic.\n2:28 Comment: Forwards Palacio, Bibeni and Gabriel.\n2:31 Comment: Well, Ivan Peresic's exit.\n2:35 Comment: For some fresh attempts to win back, it’s quite readable.\n2:41 Comment: Yes, in any case, I think he will appear on the floor.\n2:43 Comment: Well, Ever Bonega also often appears in the second half for Stefan Piel.\n2:49 Comment: Naples have goalkeepers Cabral and Sepin.\n2:54 Comment: Defenders of Strinich.\n2:55 Comment: Maggio.\n2:56 Comment: Maksimovich.\n2:57 Comment: Kirikesh.\n2:58 Comment: Midfielders Jack Chirini.\n2:59 Comment: Allan.\n3:0 Comment: Jorginho.\n3:1 Comment: Horn.\n3:2 Comment: Oh, by the way, I also forgot about Marco Rog when I listed the players who are in the rotation in the middle of the field.\n3:8 Comment: A dangerous moment may arise.\n3:10 Comment: Mertens picked up the ball.\n3:11 Comment: Pass towards Zelinsky.\n3:14 Comment: It did not pass.\n3:15 Comment: All roads are

No, this is Brozovic\n11:38 Comment: together with Zhao Mario played. And a counterattack began.\n11:41 Comment: Counterattack. Two to two.\n11:43 Comment: By the way, he runs away\n11:44 Comment: Hysaj and Medel.\n11:50 Comment: Like a high school student\n11:51 Comment: the guy has it somewhere behind the fence\n11:57 Comment: from second grade\n11:59 Comment: took the money.\n12:3 Comment: Such\n12:3 Comment: school racket.\n12:6 Comment: Medel took the ball very easily.\n12:9 Comment: Experienced footballer.\n12:11 Comment: Chilean national team player\n12:13 Comment: maybe we'll see him in the Chilean national team\n12:16 Comment: at the Confederation Cup\n12:17 Comment: in Moscow.\n12:20 Comment: Where else effective ended on\n12:24 Comment: Sighting Gebais not only\n12:26 Comment: Hertéralink5, but also\n12:28 Comment: under Kiyolskaya Xena,\n12:29 Comment: By the way, attraction Karo.\n12:31 Comment: And what does this mean as a football player?\n12:33 Comment: Our little bird,\n12:34 Comment: amenser,\n12:35 Comment: fellow envision Travia,\n12:37 Comment: but the young man called 하니까\n12:38 Comment: ter numa\n12:42 Comment: fifthmeno ribbon.\n12:43 Comment: Iga so because of the crowd\n12:44 Comment: to trainee definition of grief\n12:46 Comment: in different places.\n12:47 Comment: Such kits with ap频.\n12:49 Comment: But it's loose.\n12:49 Comment: Iezyzh.\n12:50 Comment: Lots of serves, lots of passes.\n12:53 Comment: Zhou Mario.\n12:56 Comment: Excellent with the ball.\n12:58 Comment: Of course, there is a lot of creativity behind it.\n13:2 Comment: But not everything works out for Eder.\n13:4 Comment: Eder, of course, is good when he comes on as a substitute.\n13:6 Comment: He has already scored three goals this season, playing the role of the Joker.\n13:12 Comment: Diawara.\n13:14 Comment: Long forward cast.\n13:16 Comment: An excellent football player, of course.\n13:17 Comment: Diawara develops and progresses.\n13:21 Comment: He is only 20 years old.\n13:24 Comment: Runs up the center of the field.\n13:26 Comment: Eder!\n13:27 Comment: And here he covers it with such an original selection.\n13:32 Comment: Slash-practice tackle.\n13:35 Comment: Kulebali.\n13:37 Comment: The question is whether the ball was played cleanly there.\n13:41 Comment: Judging by the bounce of the ball, it seems so.\n13:44 Comment: Pereshishch.\n13:45 Comment: Well then, Edera.\n13:46 Comment: This was the last solo by Eder before the replacement, we see.\n13:52 Comment: Or someone from central midfield.\n14:1 Comment: Joe Mario. Like this.\n14:3 Comment: Joe Mario.\n14:6 Comment: You see.\n14:9 Comment: Your commentator made a mistake.\n14:11 Comment: Well.\n14:13 Comment: Curious. Curious.\n14:15 Comment: In theory.\n14:16 Comment: Must move.\n14:18 Comment: Here, too, there should already be such a chaotic movement in the attack.\n14:21 Comment: Pereshishch can also attack from deep in the center.\n14:25 Comment: Not necessarily from the flank.\n14:27 Comment: Although he loves this business.\n14:28 Comment: Now we see Pereshishch to the left.\n14:30 Comment: In theory, both Cardi and Eder can form a pair of two strikers.\n14:36 Comment: Yes Yes Yes.\n14:36 Comment: This is exactly how it happens.\n14:38 Comment: We see they are approximately on the same line.\n14:42 Comment: To the right.\n14:44 Comment: But in turn there will be Kondreva.\n14:45 Comment: To the left is Peresic.\n14:46 Comment: Well, everything else is the same.\n14:48 Comment: Oh, how Mertens played.\n14:50 Comment: Returning the ball that had almost gone out of bounds.\n14:57 Comment: But it turned out that it was the opponent who passed the ball.\n14:59 Comment: Kondreva.\n15:0 Comment: You know, I'm also curious.\n15:2 Comment: After all, history.\n15:3 Comment: The composition is excellent.\n15:4 Comment: Gorgeous at Inka's.\n15:5 Comment: Well, they're great players.\n15:7 Comment: True, whoever you take.\n15:8 Comment: But still, there are not so many football players who are such charismatics.\n15:13 Comment: Really follow the team.\n15:15 Comment: They are pulling.\n15:16 Comment: Here Kondreva is one of them.\n15:18 Comment: Joau Mario.\n15:19 Comment: This is not the kind of person who is ready to throw the team into a bag and drag it.\n15:27 Comment: Drag along with you.\n15:28 Comment: No.\n15:29 Comment: He's more of an incidental player.\n15:31 Comment: Maybe because of this, Piole is the first to replace him today.\n15:35 Comment: It did not give stable movement.\n15:37 Comment: Eder, we see, is still rushing.\n15:40 Comment: He has good athleticism.\n15:42 Comment: But Kondreva is just the one who can.\n15:44 Comment: Lead the team.\n15:46 Comment: True, Peresic has the ball now.\n15:48 Comment: And his passing shot.\n15:53 Comment: As a result, he blocks Khulebali with his loot.\n15:57 Comment: Aurelio Doradzin.\n15:59 Comment: By the way, yes, the ball was actually played.\n16:1 Comment: Gave an interesting interview.\n16:2 Comment: Touched on a lot of topics.\n16:3 Comment: He also told about Khulebali.\n16:6 Comment: He said Conte offered €55 million for the centre-back.\n16:11 Comment: But the President of the Russian Federation.\n16:12 Comment: But the Napoli president refused.\n16:15 Comment: Because he had no replacement.\n16:17 Comment: Ready right here now.\n16:18 Comment: Although Maksimovich was bought.\n16:20 Comment: But we see that the players are of different levels.\n16:25 Comment: So there is a persistent serious demand for Khulebali.\n16:28 Comment: As well as Dries Merkels, by the way.\n16:30 Comment: There is a story about it too.\n16:33 Comment: Doloradzin said that a lot depends on the Belgian’s wife.\n16:38 Comment: Which, as I understand it, is not experienced.\n16:40 Comment: Not under the spell of the city of Naples.\n16:43 Comment: He does not experience any pleasant feelings from being there for a long time.\n16:47 Comment: And he’s already eager to go somewhere, I don’t know, to England or something.\n16:50 Comment: Probably to where they will pay more.\n16:53 Comment: Broadcast.\n16:54 Comment: Mertens falls short again.\n16:56 Comment: Although he was caught offside again.\n16:58 Comment: Stood the line well.\n16:59 Comment: And he jumped out on time.\n17:1 Comment: Well, those same long legs.\n17:3 Comment: Which, by the way, Povaletti and Meliko have.\n17:5 Comment: By the way, she wasn't there.\n17:6 Comment: But, by the way, she didn’t reach it.\n17:7 Comment: And here she is.\n17:9 Comment: On the hierarchy.\n17:10 Comment: She didn't have enough.\n17:11 Comment: Mertens, Mertens, Mertens.\n17:14 Comment: 22 goals.\n17:15 Comment: Imagine.\n17:16 Comment: Dries Mertens has scored this season.\n17:18 Comment: This is exactly the same as in the previous 3 seasons.\n17:23 Comment: Italy combined.\n17:25 Comment: 11, plus 6, plus 5.\n17:27 Comment: That turns out to be 22.\n17:28 Comment: And he scored all these 22 during this not yet completed season.\n17:32 Comment: Well, the first substitution in Naples, as I understand it, is the answer.\n17:35 Comment: This is Sarri's answer.\n17:36 Comment: And because Zelinsky leaves the field with two feet.\n17:39 Comment: Here Rock appears on the field.\n17:41 Comment: A more recent defensive habi, who, in my opinion, is a little more experienced in defensive matters.\n17:47 Comment: Although Rock can also give an excellent pass.\n17:51 Comment: At the same time, he is probably not that useful in attacking actions.\n17:57 Comment: That is, this is already a kind of change of emphasis.\n18:2 Comment: Napoleon understands that Inter is now rushing to attack in large numbers.\n18:6 Comment: And he tries a little to hold him back.\n18:10 Comment: Including with the help of such a replacement.\n18:12 Comment: The replacement took place and we have a corner.\n18:15 Comment: Corner near Handanovic's goal.\n18:17 Comment: They haven't been around for a long time.\n18:18 Comment: From the first half, the ball was sent to the center towards Kulebali.\n18:22 Comment: He is, of course, the most dangerous on set pieces.\n18:25 Comment: The tallest, heaviest.\n18:26 Comment: Gamshik.\n18:29 Comment: We will probably see his replacement today too.\n18:31 Comment: Marek Hamsik.\n18:33 Comment: Lately it's often in the 70s.\n18:36 Comment: Minutes.\n18:37 Comment: Leaves the field.\n18:38 Comment: And a blow.\n18:39 Comment: Near corner.\n18:40 Comment: Handanovic pulls this ball out of the corner.\n18:44 Comment: Big question for Stvorla.\n18:46 Comment: The ball was heading.\n18:48 Comment: Still, it seems like it’s passing.\n18:49 Comment: But Handanovic played it safe.\n18:53 Comment: And he did the right thing.\n18:57 Comment: Lorenzo Incini.\n18:58 Comment: I really don't know.\n19:1 Comment: Surely the contract will be on improved terms.\n19:5 Comment: Allowing.\n19:6 Comment: Earn more in a team where he improves, improves, improves.\n19:28 Comment: Well, well, well already, well already.\n19:30 Comment: Stop procrastinating.\n19:34 Comment: Cat by the whiskers.\n19:36 Comment: Murillo.\n19:37 Comment: With the back of his head he throws the ball further.\n19:40 Comment: And this yellow card is automatic.\n19:43 Comment: Automatically.\n19:44 Comment: I think many of my colleagues in their reports from different championships\n19:48 Comment: told you that we recently had a seminar,\n19:53 Comment: in which Lind Kaloshin took part,\n19:55 Comment: representative of our refereeing department.\n19:58 Comment: And he showed us a video that\n20:1 Comment: sent\n20:3 Comment: sent from Efim.\n20:6 Comment: And it was Murifa, as far as I remember.\n20:7 Comment: And such episodes were very clearly depicted in these videos.\n20:13 Comment: These are the jumps on your feet.\n20:15 Comment: Even if you hit your sword first and then your opponent’s leg,\n20:19 Comment: they are automatically punished with a yellow card.\n20:22 Comment: This is dangerous for health, for the opponent’s ankle, and so on.\n20:25 Comment: Got yellow culebaria.\n20:26 Comment: Dangerous blow.\n20:28 Comment: Snowballs from the second line.\n20:29 Comment: But finally we remember Mauro Icardi.\n20:33 Comment: The bafter has 24 goals in this championship.\n20:35 Comment: And that's it.\n20:37 Comment: The Argentine also fell apart towards the end of the championship.\n20:40 Comment: In the match with Ferentina in the last round, he scored 3 goals.\n20:45 Comment: Moreover, 2 are already at the very end at 88 and 91 added time.\n20:49 Comment: Before that he scored against Milan.\n20:53 Comment: Well, I remember, at least he had a trig in the match with Atalanta too.\n20:58 Comment: Now, so far, well, this was probably the most striking, poignant episode with his participation.\n21:3 Comment: Kondreeva, Kondreeva, all through the right eyebrow.\n21:6 Comment: Here is the translation finally to Peresic.\n21:8 Comment: They remembered him. Ivan Peresic. Soft pass.\n21:12 Comment: But Pepperine caught the ball.\n21:17 Comment: Recently, there was also talk that he, Pepperane, was already 40 years old at lunchtime.\n21:22 Comment: To be more precise, 37.\n21:27 Comment: And, of course, we need to think about a new goalkeeper.\n21:30 Comment: And it was said that almost Minaraiola offers Donara.\n21:36 Comment: But this was only the first inter. Imagine what will happen.\n21:39 Comment: If one of the most talented goalkeepers in the world moves to the neighboring camp.\n21:43 Comment: Mertens. Impact position.\n21:46 Comment: Rocky Handanovich.\n21:49 Comment: He reaches the ball, although the ball is from under the feet of two defenders at once.\n21:56 Comment: I won’t say, I flew out.\n21:59 Comment: Crawled out.\n22:0 Comment: Yes, the blow was not strong, but very cunning.\n22:2 Comment: Very.\n22:5 Comment: Extremely.\n22:6 Comment: But, of course, the main inspirer of this attack was Incini.\n22:11 Comment: And here is Mertens.\n22:12 Comment: Remember what I told you?\n22:14 Comment: Yes, he is not tall.\n22:16 Comment: Yes, not heavy.\n22:17 Comment: He's very good on his feet.\n22:19 Comment: And there are many episodes when he stands at the center of the odds, puts his back and shoulder hard.\n22:26 Comment: That is, not an insect in football.\n22:29 Comment: But in football he is again actively playing secrets.\n22:37 Comment: I'll give Dries Mertens a good football player.\n22:38 Comment: Ontez in front of us over bizi.\n22:40 Comment: But in Mega Man he tramples not only Schnitsurning and always the fruit.\n22:41 Comment: And Based on Hitman, and everything else openings.\n22:45 Comment: Hasting's insects are now 你想, what is in the Leon Thor

also rolled up.\n23:10 Comment: Ghulyam strikes.\n23:12 Comment: He made an excellent pass to Incinia.\n23:15 Comment: But he was still in such a position that it was only possible to break through the heel.\n23:20 Comment: There was still a ricochet there.\n23:21 Comment: And Handanovich helps out.\n23:23 Comment: I wonder where the ball would have gone if not for this ricochet.\n23:26 Comment: Well, Handanovich is still the main hero of the match.\n23:29 Comment: How many?\n23:30 Comment: Here.\n23:30 Comment: You know, in my opinion, there would be a goal.\n23:32 Comment: It seems to me, based on this replay, that there would have been a goal, because the ball was sent to the left of Handanovic.\n23:39 Comment: An unprotected goal for him.\n23:40 Comment: Down pretty quickly.\n23:42 Comment: It would be very beautiful.\n23:44 Comment: This could be a contender for the title of the best goal of the season in Italy.\n23:49 Comment: Rose's is so great.\n23:51 Comment: But there are not enough heads, you will agree.\n23:53 Comment: For such a match, Naples leads 1-0.\n23:56 Comment: Eder.\n23:56 Comment: Continues to fight with Raul Albel and Diawara.\n24:1 Comment: Diawara is excellent in the middle of the field.\n24:4 Comment: By the way, there has been talk that Mamadou Diawara could become a player for the Italian national team.\n24:12 Comment: Although, well, you

    "summary": "In a highly anticipated Serie A clash, Inter Milan hosted Napoli at the iconic Stadio Giuseppe Meazza in Milan for the 34th round of the Italian Championship. The electrifying atmosphere was palpable from the kickoff, with fans fervently backing their respective teams.\n\nInter Milan set up with Samir Handanovic guarding the goal. Their defensive line featured Danilo D'Ambrosio on the right, Yuto Nagatomo on the left, and central defenders Jason Murillo and Gary Medel. The midfield consisted of Marcelo Brozovic and Roberto Gagliardini in defensive roles, with Antonio Candreva on the right and Eder on the left flanking the attack. Joao Mario played just behind the lone striker, Mauro Icardi, who also captained the side.\n\nNapoli, led by head coach Maurizio Sarri, lined up with Pepe Reina in goal. Their back four included Faouzi Ghoulam on the left, Elseid Hysaj on the right, and the central partnership of Kalidou Koulibaly and Raul Albiol. The midfield trio comprised captain Marek Hamsik, Amadou Diawara, and Piotr Zielinski. Lorenzo Insigne and Jose Callejon operated on the wings, while Dries Mertens played as the central striker, leading the line.\n\nThe game kicked off with Napoli immediately showing their attacking intent. Early on, Insigne's cross found its way to the near post but was cleared by Inter's defense. Inter also attempted to threaten, with an early corner creating a chance, though it was quickly dealt with by Napoli's defense.\n\nAs the game progressed, Napoli began to dominate possession, moving the ball swiftly and creating several half-chances. Zielinski played a crucial role, often moving the ball backward to retain possession and reset attacks. A notable moment saw Napoli's combination play involving Hamsik and Insigne, only for the ball to be cut out by Inter's defense.\n\nA significant point of contention came in the first ten minutes when Icardi, involved in defensive duties, successfully cleared an Napoli attempt, highlighting his all-round contributions. As the first half developed, Inter's defense, notably Jason Murillo and Gary Medel, had to be vigilant to deal with Mertens' and Insigne's clever movements and quick passes.\n\nNapoli's full-backs, Hysaj and Ghoulam, kept pushing forward, adding width to their attacks. Ghoulam, in particular, was crucial on the left flank, overlapping and delivering crosses into the box, looking for the intelligent runs of Mertens. Despite the pressure, Inter's defense stood firm with Handanovic making key saves to keep the scores level.\n\nNapoli's persistence paid off towards the end of the first half. In a moment of high pressure, Yuto Nagatomo misjudged the ball inside his own penalty area, attempting to clear but instead inadvertently setting up Callejon. The Spaniard calmly finished past Handanovic, giving Napoli a deserved 1-0 lead in the 44th minute.\n\nThe second half commenced with Inter making a concerted effort to claw their way back into the game. Antonio Candreva remained a key outlet, frequently making runs on the right wing and delivering crucial crosses. Despite his efforts, Napoli's defense remained resolute, with Koulibaly and Albiol effectively neutralizing threats.\n\nInter's best chances came from set-pieces and crosses into the box. Candreva's pinpoint deliveries kept testing Napoli's defense, yet Inter couldn’t find the elusive equalizer. Brozovic and Gagliardini shot from distance, but their attempts lacked the precision to trouble Reina.\n\nMertens remained a constant thorn in Inter’s side. He came close to doubling Napoli’s lead multiple times, including a curling effort that hit the post, and a beautifully crafted pass to Callejon which nearly resulted in another goal but was thwarted by Handanovic's quick reflexes.\n\nAs the game progressed, substitutions were made by both managers in an attempt to influence the result. Inter brought on Ivan Perisic, aiming to inject more pace and creativity into their attacks. Napoli responded by introducing defensive-minded players like Allan and Marko Rog, looking to consolidate their lead.\n\nNapoli's tactical adjustments paid off as their midfield asserted more control. The likes of Diawara and Rog disrupted Inter's play, making crucial interceptions and maintaining possession. Meanwhile, Marek Hamsik continued to orchestrate play from midfield until he was substituted for additional defensive stability.\n\nInter's frustration grew as time ticked away. Mauro Icardi, who had been largely kept quiet, struggled to find clear opportunities against a stubborn Napoli defense. Inter's sporadic attacks often ended in crosses easily claimed by Reina or shots blocked by the resolute Koulibaly and Albiol.\n\nIn the dying moments, Inter pushed forward desperately, committing players to attack. This left spaces at the back, which Napoli almost exploited multiple times through quick counterattacks. Insigne and Mertens continued to trouble Inter’s defense, forcing Handanovic into several crucial saves to keep his team in the match.\n\nAs the final whistle blew, Napoli emerged victorious, holding onto their slender but crucial 1-0 lead. The win reinforced their position in the Serie A table, keeping their hopes for a Champions League spot alive. For Inter, the defeat marked another setback in their pursuit of European football, despite a spirited effort.\n\nThis match showcased Napoli's tactical discipline, attacking flair, and defensive resilience, highlighting why they remained a force in Italian football. Inter, while valiantly fighting, were left to rue missed opportunities and defensive lapses, most notably Nagatomo's costly error.\n\nAs the season neared its climax, both teams would reflect on this match's lessons, Napoli reveling in a hard-fought victory and Inter seeking to address their shortcomings in the pursuit of their season objectives."
