Fauzi Ghulam, 31st, play on the flanks.\n1:1 Comment: 21st Vlad Kirikish and 26th Kaleidou Coulibaly.\n1:5 Comment: Central defenders. The defensive line does not change.\n1:10 Comment: She is stable. Yes, actually, Napoli as a whole has had a very stable squad for several years now.\n1:16 Comment: But there is a choice in midfield. In particular, today's number 42 is Amadou Diawara.\n1:20 Comment: In the role of support next to him is 5th Marquez Alan.\n1:22 Comment: And then 17th Maria Gamshik.\n1:25 Comment: Attack.\n1:26 Comment: If Yuvi has 2 large ones, then Napoli has 3 small ones.\n1:29 Comment: Like that. This is a problem for Napoli. Milik is not playing today, Gabidini is not playing.\n1:34 Comment: 14th Dries Mertens, 7th Jose Callejon.\n1:37 Comment: And 24th, the shortest of the Napoli attack players, Lorenzo Incinia.\n1:43 Comment: He's with the ball now. He may even have to be in the center forward position from time to time.\n1:49 Comment: But somehow there will need to escape the attention of the defenders.\n1:52 Comment: Mauricio Sari, head coach of Napoli.\n1:56 Comment: These are the starting minutes, dear friends.\n1:59 Comment: A very important point, of course, is how Napoli will show itself at Juventus-Tettem.\n2:4 Comment: The thing is that in the last six matches here in Turin, Juventus certainly, certainly won.\n2:10 Comment: And this is a problem for Neapolitans.\n2:12 Comment: For example, last year, when Napoli was the leader, and Juventus was catching up with Napoli with great difficulty.\n2:17 Comment: And it seemed to everyone that Napoli could win the Scudetto right here, in the decisive match,\n2:21 Comment: when Simon Dzadze's goal largely deprived Napoli of the Scudetto.\n2:25 Comment: And Tettus.\n2:26 Comment: It happened.\n2:28 Comment: Chief referee Gianluja Rocchi.\n2:31 Comment: Today he is an important referee for the Italian Serie A.\n2:35 Comment: The Melikos of the Tonolini station help him.\n2:39 Comment: That's all, friends.\n2:41 Comment: Serious attention to what Napoli will try to do against today's Juve.\n2:47 Comment: Yes, Nobel, you are absolutely right.\n2:48 Comment: Defeat from Milan, and quite recently, a week ago.\n2:51 Comment: And before that, Inter showed Juventus to the entire league.\n2:55 Comment: Wiswick.\n2:56 Comment: Vizvim.\n2:58 Comment: And this team can be beaten.\n2:59 Comment: And, of course, including in such big matches.\n3:1 Comment: Because Juventus is strong at a distance.\n3:3 Comment: He can beat average Italian teams without\n3:6 Comment: problems.\n3:7 Comment: But in big matches there is a chance to beat Juventus.\n3:10 Comment: Let's see how Napoli will play against the old team today\n3:14 Comment: Signory.\n3:15 Comment: Well, concluding the preview, in fact, about average Italian\n3:18 Comment: teams.\n3:19 Comment: Sambdoria has turned into a middle one in recent years.\n3:21 Comment: And now her Juventus is on tour.\n3:24 Comment: At ten.\n3:25 Comment: Midweek.\n3:26 Comment: And so he won.\n3:27 Comment: Moreover, he famously beat 4-1.\n3:29 Comment: Napoli also won their match against a team that\n3:33 Comment: once coached by the current coach of the Neaptalitans.\n3:36 Comment: Empoli won 2-0.\n3:37 Comment: Empoli, like Sambdoria, is at the bottom of the table.\n3:39 Comment: So no one was particularly surprised.\n3:41 Comment: The argument is traditional at the very beginning of the match.\n3:45 Comment: Dries Mertens is unhappy.\n3:46 Comment: Today he plays as a center forward.\n3:49 Comment: Or a false nine.\n3:50 Comment: Call it whatever you want.\n3:51 Comment: But now there is an argument with Banucci about who touched the ball\n3:53 Comment: the last one in this situation.\n3:55 Comment: Claudio Marchisi.\n3:56 Comment: He's not playing today.\n3:57 Comment: He played in the last match.\n3:59 Comment: But he is still protected.\n4:0 Comment: Well, they showed Emmanuella Jokerina.\n4:2 Comment: It is important.\n4:3 Comment: He is now part of Napoli.\n4:4 Comment: His team is attacking.\n4:6 Comment: But he played for Juventus.\n4:7 Comment: He played an important role.\n4:9 Comment: Mertens lost the ball.\n4:12 Comment: And Juventus’ attack has already begun.\n4:14 Comment: It also breaks down.\n4:16 Comment: Diawara maintain a good pace.\n4:17 Comment: And those and others.\n4:18 Comment: In the first minutes.\n4:19 Comment: Penalty patch.\n4:20 Comment: Kick to the legs.\n4:21 Comment: Gamchik has the ball.\n4:22 Comment: Pause.\n4:23 Comment: Further, further left.\n4:24 Comment: Naples needs a happy defender.\n4:26 Comment: Blue.\n4:27 Comment: This is how he decided to pass between Barzalia and Khidira.\n4:31 Comment: Two such giants were almost left behind.\n4:34 Comment: Hysai on the right flank.\n4:37 Comment: It's interesting that Napoli now have an advantage from the point\n4:39 Comment: view of ball control.\n4:40 Comment: This doesn't always happen.\n4:41 Comment: Match against Juventus.\n4:42 Comment: Calihon.\n4:43 Comment: The wall is good.\n4:44 Comment: Hysai on the right flank.\n4:45 Comment: Will serve or cross.\n4:47 Comment: Juventus struggles to fight back.\n4:48 Comment: The second pace was not enough, in my opinion, for the Neapolitans.\n4:51 Comment: All those people who took the penalty have already run\n4:54 Comment: past the ball.\n4:54 Comment: And then Juventus responded.\n4:56 Comment: Good speed.\n4:58 Comment: Mandzhuki passes.\n4:59 Comment: Penalty.\n5:0 Comment: Higuain is here.\n5:1 Comment: They forced him out.\n5:2 Comment: Kulebali is well located.\n5:3 Comment: Did not allow Higuain to receive the ball, handle and search\n5:8 Comment: partner.\n5:9 Comment: But Higuain is experienced.\n5:10 Comment: Grand Master Gonsal Higuain delivered the body.\n5:12 Comment: Waited for the blow to the legs.\n5:14 Comment: He fell onto the lawn and earned a free kick.\n5:16 Comment: Quite dangerous from this area, because in the past\n5:19 Comment: tour against Samdori, Juventus scored out of four\n5:21 Comment: three balls with a head.\n5:23 Comment: And one after a similar fine.\n5:24 Comment: Game again.\n5:27 Comment: Kulebali played well.\n5:28 Comment: I emphasize once again and note, among other things, that this is the only\n5:33 Comment: Napoli field player, who has played in ten rounds so far\n5:37 Comment: all matches without exception without substitutions.\n5:40 Comment: There are only two such players.\n5:41 Comment: 900 minutes in ten rounds.\n5:42 Comment: This is Reina, goalkeeper and central defender Kalidou Kulebali.\n5:47 Comment: Free kick from Miralim Pjanic.\n5:49 Comment: Great master of set pieces.\n5:52 Comment: Next to him is Alex Sandro.\n5:53 Comment: And Pjanic saddled up in the last round.\n5:54 Comment: Tested for a goal.\n5:56 Comment: Now Miralim has another opportunity.\n5:58 Comment: But you said that the dispatcher was Hernanes.\n6:1 Comment: I’m not against it, but Pyanich is also one of those.\n6:4 Comment: Feed is high.\n6:5 Comment: There will be a blow.\n6:6 Comment: No.\n6:7 Comment: Again Kulebali wins the episode.\n6:8 Comment: But Reina, also mentioned in the previous passage, calmly\n6:12 Comment: completes the job by picking up the ball.\n6:15 Comment: Forward kick towards Lorenzo Incinio.\n6:17 Comment: And here Elik Steiner almost made a mistake.\n6:20 Comment: By the way, Olegre continues to rotate the flanks.\n6:23 Comment: It has four magnificent flanks.\n6:24 Comment: Footballer Euro Dani Alves is not playing today.\n6:28 Comment: This is actually an interesting solution.\n6:30 Comment: But here is also Quadrado, who was in the last round\n6:32 Comment: He also played great.\n6:33 Comment: And in Lyon he played great in the Champions League.\n6:36 Comment: But today Quadrado plays on the bench\n6:38 Comment: Elik Steiner.\n6:39 Comment: Yes, we have already forgotten that there is also Quadro Samo,\n6:42 Comment: For example.\n6:43 Comment: In general, Juventus has an amazing squad.\n6:46 Comment: A man who was almost promoted to new\n6:50 Comment: simultaneously Pirlo Baggio and Del Pierro.\n6:52 Comment: But he doesn't play.\n6:54 Comment: Is it that Juventus has ceased to be Juventus?\n6:55 Comment: In no case.\n6:56 Comment: Paulo Dibalo will return and restore just as quickly,\n7:1 Comment: I think all the playing conditions of Juventus.\n7:3 Comment: With whom and with him.\n7:5 Comment: But even without him.\n7:6 Comment: People understand perfectly well what is happening due to\n7:9 Comment: why you can shake up someone else’s defense.\n7:11 Comment:

He tries to turn around, but Juventus puts pressure on him.\n7:22 Comment: Andre Barzali is a big defender.\n7:24 Comment: He played precisely under pressure against Florence Insigni.\n7:26 Comment: This is Muritso Sarri.\n7:27 Comment: He has been criticized lately because he is somewhat\n7:30 Comment: failed in the Champions League.\n7:32 Comment: Including losing at home to Besiktas.\n7:35 Comment: Few people expected it, to be honest, after the wonderful\n7:37 Comment: start.\n7:38 Comment: But this also happens.\n7:39 Comment: Well, we will probably remember the match that Napoleon\n7:42 Comment: will be in the Champions League.\n7:44 Comment: The most important, reciprocal.\n7:45 Comment: With Besiktas, everything became very difficult in the group.\n7:49 Comment: A curious situation could arise.\n7:51 Comment: If Napoleon had won against Besiktas, and in parallel\n7:53 Comment: match...\n7:54 Comment: If two teams played each other, it would be the first time\n7:56 Comment: in the history of the group stage, League group stage\n7:59 Comment: Champions one team would advance to the next round\n8:2 Comment: after three rounds.\n8:3 Comment: But no.\n8:4 Comment: It didn’t work out, it didn’t work out.\n8:6 Comment: And Naples will still suffer in the Champions League, judging\n8:8 Comment: throughout.\n8:9 Comment: For now, Alexandro is playing ahead of Mario Majukic.\n8:11 Comment: He sets up the body.\n8:12 Comment: Kirkish is against him.\n8:14 Comment: And the defender from Romania plays quite confidently.\n8:16 Comment: Yes, Euro participant.\n8:21 Comment: Like many here.\n8:22 Comment: Hernanes.\n8:23 Comment: One more pass back.\n8:25 Comment: Chiellini on Leonardo Banucci.\n8:29 Comment: And he doesn’t come up with anything.\n8:31 Comment: Plays short with the same Chiellini.\n8:33 Comment: Chiellini is the kind of defender who starts attacks\n8:35 Comment: ready to support them.\n8:36 Comment: Diawara is here.\n8:37 Comment: Lies in wait.\n8:38 Comment: Inaccurate reception of the opponent.\n8:40 Comment: And the ball flies towards the Juve goal.\n8:43 Comment: Moreover, if he had remained in the field...\n8:45 Comment: Here is Anieli.\n8:46 Comment: If this ball had remained in the field, I could have\n8:49 Comment: fight Dries Mertens.\n8:51 Comment: And even continue the attack.\n8:53 Comment: From the side.\n8:55 Comment: Napoleon.\n8:56 Comment: As I already said, it feels quite comfortable\n8:58 Comment: at the Event Stadium.\n8:59 Comment: Hysai.\n9:0 Comment: Pass towards Dries Mertens.\n9:2 Comment: He's spinning and spinning.\n9:5 Comment: And in the end he plays on Hysai.\n9:7 Comment: Calihon.\n9:8 Comment: And there is no free kick.\n9:9 Comment: No penalty.\n9:10 Comment: And Rocky showed that she was going with Whist.\n9:13 Comment: But I came up with it.\n9:14 Comment: I think he fell too quickly.\n9:17 Comment: The frankness of this hint that the opponent cannot\n9:18 Comment: leave.\n9:19 Comment: And here is Dries Mertens.\n9:20 Comment: He can't leave.\n9:23 Comment: And just like that he failed.\n9:24 Comment: Rocky didn't like it very much.\n9:25 Comment: Jose Calijon didn't even try to stay on his feet.\n9:29 Comment: Well, here is the overlay.\n9:32 Comment: Kiri didn't kick the ball.\n9:35 Comment: And this is how Kalikhon happened.\n9:37 Comment: This is still not Kalihon.\n9:39 Comment: It is quite possible that this is Sid Hysay.\n9:41 Comment: No no.\n9:42 Comment: Calihon.\n9:43 Comment: Closed the zone.\n9:46 Comment: Banucci puts pressure on Napoleon.\n9:52 Comment: And Vitus shows.\n9:53 Comment: It is difficult to go from defense to attack.\n9:56 Comment: Higira has to play backwards.\n9:57 Comment: Banucci.\n9:58 Comment: Pass to Barzalia.\n9:59 Comment: And now the transfer to the board of directors is Gonsal El Gono.\n10:1 Comment: Handled the ball well.\n10:2 Comment: Not bad for Hernandez.\n10:3 Comment: But the Brazilian was not ready for this pass.\n10:4 Comment: Calihon.\n10:5 Comment: Shot on goal.\n10:6 Comment: The Spaniard has a very good shot.\n10:7 Comment: Not without reason.\n10:8 Comment: He was one of the snipers.\n10:9 Comment: Even under Guain.\n10:10 Comment: He scored a lot from his right wing.\n10:11 Comment: Well, today, too, the game will definitely go through him.\n10:12 Comment: Well, Marquez Alan is wrong here.\n10:13 Comment: He did not understand Marquez Alan.\n10:14 Comment: He didn't understand.\n10:15 Comment: He maneuvers his partner.\n10:16 Comment: And he gave it back.\n10:17 Comment: But it was necessary to play on the move.\n10:18 Comment: Juventus returns the ball.\n10:19 Comment: Well, let's see how many players there are.\n10:20 Comment: Napoleon settled down in the opposing half of the field.\n10:21 Comment: At least five.\n10:22 Comment: Pass forward to Higuain.\n10:23 Comment: He clings.\n10:24 Comment: No.\n10:25 Comment: He clings.\n10:26 Comment: They cling to him.\n10:27 Comment: As a result, both players fall.\n10:28 Comment: And that's not very good.\n10:29 Comment: But like I said.\n10:30 Comment: The game will go.\n10:31 Comment: But, as I already said.\n10:32 Comment: The game will go.\n10:38 Comment: But, he clings.\n10:39 Comment: No.\n10:40 Comment: He clings.\n10:41 Comment: They cling to him.\n10:42 Comment: As a result, both players fall.\n10:43 Comment: Ikirikish.\n10:44 Comment: Higuain.\n10:45 Comment: Gamshik.\n10:46 Comment: Wonderful pass to the left flank.\n10:49 Comment: Here Lorenzo Insigni will handle the ball.\n10:51 Comment: And he can go into the free zone.\n10:53 Comment: Heel pass.\n10:54 Comment: But on who?\n10:55 Comment: To whom is the transfer?\n10:56 Comment: There was no one there.\n10:57 Comment: But Fauzi Ghulam was supposed to be there.\n11:1 Comment: Should have opened up.\n11:2 Comment: Start moving.\n11:3 Comment: And Insigny relied on his partner.\n11:6 Comment: But left-back Napoleon did not go forward.\n11:7 Comment: And Juventus rushes to attack.\n11:9 Comment: Higuain Majukic.\n11:10 Comment: Climbed up.\n11:11 Comment: Almost went offside.\n11:13 Comment: Pepperrain appreciated.\n11:14 Comment: Everything came out.\n11:15 Comment: He took the ball into his hands.\n11:17 Comment: Confused Higuain Majukic from Debala.\n11:19 Comment: The pass to Horvat was too strong.\n11:21 Comment: We know the advantages of Majukic.\n11:23 Comment: But we also know its disadvantages.\n11:24 Comment: He doesn't have the fastest starting speed.\n11:26 Comment: He can't make a dash.\n11:28 Comment: And at this moment, of course, Higuain should have played differently.\n11:30 Comment: In my opinion, pass to the feet and open into the free zone.\n11:34 Comment: However, apparently, the mutual understanding between the big strikers is not ideal yet.\n11:38 Comment: Well, maybe you can just be more careful and move on.\n11:40 Comment: But the ball flew too far.\n11:43 Comment: Reply to Napoleon.\n11:44 Comment: Albanian Elsid Hysaj delivers towards the penalty area.\n11:47 Comment: It will be difficult for the Neapolitans to fight for top goals here.\n11:51 Comment: But the rebound is in the center of the field.\n11:53 Comment: Everything is quiet.\n11:54 Comment: And now Vlad Kirikish passes to the flank again.\n11:57 Comment: Through Diawar, through Hamshik.\n12:0 Comment: And a little back.\n12:1 Comment: Indeed, Napoleon feels absolutely comfortable.\n12:4 Comment: In this game.\n12:5 Comment: Gamshik.\n12:7 Comment: Now I don't understand a little.\n12:9 Comment: Hamshik Ensigny.\n12:10 Comment: But Gulyam is the first on the ball here.\n12:12 Comment: Gamshik.\n12:13 Comment: A lot depends on him.\n12:14 Comment: Here is Marko Hamsik, leader of Napoleon.\n12:16 Comment: In this situation, certainly Napoleon.\n12:18 Comment: Gulibali.\n12:19 Comment: Broadcast.\n12:20 Comment: Offside.\n12:22 Comment: Yes, offside.\n12:23 Comment: The ball hits the net.\n12:24 Comment: By the way, Kalikhon did everything beautifully.\n12:26 Comment: And maybe he really didn't hear.\n12:28 Comment: The 42,000-seat stands are overcrowded.\n12:30 Comment: Indeed, it is offside.\n12:32 Comment: Well, a whistle.\n12:33 Comment: It was quite possible that it sounded already at the moment when I came up with this reversal.\n12:38 Comment: And he sent the ball past Buffon.\n12:40 Comment: Jose Calijon, in any case, fans love it when the ball ends up in someone else's net.\n12:45 Comment: But goalkeepers don't like it.\n12:47 Comment: Goalkeepers, of course.\n12:48 Comment: Accordingly, yes.\n12:49 Comment: Like in that joke.\n12:50 Comment: You say good, she doesn't say good.\n12:52 Comment: And it's the other way around.\n12:53 Comment: Eventus came out from under pressure.\n12:56 Comment: Leonardo Banucci rushes forward.\n12:58 Comment: Looking for a continuation of this attack.\n13:0 Comment: The translation is wonderful.\n13:1 Comment: To the left flank.\n13:2 Comment: On Miralim Petrus.\n13:3 Comment: Pyanich settle the ball.\n13:4 Comment: And it was easy to process.\n13:5 Comment: Aleksandrova is played on the left hand by center Pjanic.\n13:8 Comment: Hernanes.\n13:9 Comment: Ricochet.\n13:11 Comment: Reina.\n13:13 Comment: After last year's season, Reyna is afraid of ricochets.\n13:17 Comment: We remember Simone Tsadze's goal.\n13:19 Comment: There, probably, the rebound played a key lesson.\n13:22 Comment: But still the blow was amazing.\n13:24 Comment: And the fact that Iventus and Olegre released a fresh striker in the end decided\n13:31 Comment: Exodus.\n13:32 Comment: The outcome of the most important match.\n13:35 Comment: Before the finish line.\n13:36 Comment: The rest was already clear.\n13:38 Comment: Eventus will not give anything away.\n13:39 Comment: Khidiram.\n13:41 Comment: Player of the German national team.\n13:43 Comment: With a ball.\n13:44 Comment: And bad transmission.\n13:45 Comment: Hamshek.\n13:46 Comment: Majukic in a tackle.\n13:47 Comment: Creeps.\n13:48 Comment: This is why Masimiliana Olegre loves him so much.\n13:50 Comment: He believes Mario Majukic has something other strikers don't have.\n13:54 Comment: Ability to fight.\n13:55 Comment: Ability to work for a team.\n13:57 Comment: Spread in tackles.\n13:58 Comment: Press.\n13:59 Comment: Run without a ball.\n14:0 Comment: This is, of course, a big plus.\n14:1 Comment: For Mario Majukic.\n14:3 Comment: Well, for Eventus.\n14:5 Comment: That it has such a format.\n14:6 Comment: Undoubtedly.\n14:7 Comment: He's quite patient.\n14:8 Comment: He remained in the team despite the arrival of Le Guain.\n14:11 Comment: He is eager to join the team.\n14:13 Comment: He is quite fresh when he takes the field.\n14:17 Comment: And he scored a goal in the last round.\n14:19 Comment: For the first time in almost 900 minutes.\n14:21 Comment: Licksteiner.\n14:23 Comment: Not the best transfer.\n14:25 Comment: Coulibaly.\n14:26 Comment: Long pass forward again.\n14:27 Comment: In the direction of Dries Merkins.\n14:29 Comment: He will handle the ball.\n14:30 Comment: And it will exclude.\n14:31 Comment: Partner.\n14:32 Comment: Penalty kick for the opponent.\n14:33 Comment: There's really no one there.\n14:34 Comment: This is his favorite position.\n14:35 Comment: Mertens.\n14:36 Comment: Ricochet.\n14:37 Comment: The ball is in the hands of the Fon club.\n14:38 Comment: But we see that both Incinio and Mertens, and from time to time\n14:41 Comment: Kalikon is forced to shift to the center.\n14:44 Comment: It seems like they put a coach there from the very beginning.\n14:47 Comment: Precisely Belgian.\n14:48 Comment: But, of course, neither he, nor Incinio, nor Kalikon are uncomfortable, not\n14:52 Comment: It's handy to play there.\n14:53 Comment: It is quite possible that there will be a completely false nine.\n14:55 Comment: Hamshek will play a kind of Totti, right?\n14:57 Comment: From the depth.\n14:58 Comment: And he has these blows.\n14:59 Comment: Here's Paula Dybala.\n15:0 Comment: And Marco Pjac.\n15:1 Comment: Another injured Juventus player.\n15:3 Comment: The last two strikers are in Juve's hospital today.\n15:7 Comment: And therefore, for the umpteenth time, in the fifth match, in my opinion,\n15:11 Comment: in a row, the guy from 2000 is on the Juventus bench\n15:15 Comment: birth of Moise Kean.\n15:17 Comment: He is 16 years old, dear friends.\n15:19 Comment: And anything can happen.\n15:21 Comment: He may also appear on the field today.\n15:23 Comment: Well, Donoroma is almost Bufon’s heir, right?\n15:27 Comment: That is, young football players are advancing to Italy.\n15:30 Comment: And they are in Italy quite quickly.\n15:32 Comment: And the main thing is that the coaches are not shy about giving them chances.\n15:35 Comment: The trend has been for the last three to four years.\n15:37 Comment: In Italy they are really concerned about young players getting practice.\n15:41 Comment: And for Italian football to develop.\n15:43 Comment: Not only with the help of legionnaires, but also with their students.\n15:46 Comment: Hysaj on the right flank.\n15:48 Comment: An Albanian defender who is highly respected and loved by Mauritso Sari.\n15:52 Comment: I took it from Empoli.\n15:54 Comment: Diawara.\n15:56 Comment: Yes, one of the three, in my opinion, football players who came.\n15:59 Comment: And he was also in Aldifiore.\n16:1 Comment: But he had already left for Torino.\n16:3 Comment: Already left for Torino.\n16:5 Comment: And Hysai is here. Hysaj is a starting player.\n16:7 Comment: Essentially, he has no alternative on the right flank of defense.\n16:10 Comment: Here he is with the ball.\n16:11 Comment: Plays well for Alan.\n16:13 Comment: Diawara. Another young talent, really.\n16:15 Comment: African, but still.\n16:17 Comment: Although Mosekin, he has African roots, but in Italian.\n16:21 Comment: Beautiful translation.\n16:23 Comment: Legsteimer took a long time to adjust.\n16:25 Comment: Still, he knocked the ball out of the sideline.\n16:27 Comment: However, exactly what kind of side. There weren't really any options.\n16:29 Comment: He threw the ball over Hidiro.\n16:33 Comment: But also out.\n16:37 Comment: Ximulian Allegri is calm.\n16:39 Comment: Although one cannot help but feel, including from his facial expressions,\n16:43 Comment: how Juvetus's trainer lightly bites his lips,\n16:46 Comment: that the game is difficult.\n16:48 Comment: It's already complicated.\n16:50 Comment: It will be so traumatic for Juve today's Napoli.\n16:54 Comment: Moreover, without a center forward, such as Higuain.\n16:58 Comment: You have to play.\n16:59 Comment: You bought the best player from this team.\n17:3 Comment: The most effective.\n17:5 Comment: Well, go ahead and prove it.\n17:7 Comment: Of course, if Allegri loses today or even Nishcha plays,\n17:10 Comment: there will be such a wave of criticism.\n17:12 Comment: This is actually a gigantic pressure on Ximuliana Allegri.\n17:14 Comment: He understands this.\n17:16 Comment: Higuain is not only a big plus, it’s also a big minus for him.\n17:18 Comment: This is a huge investment and responsibility for the result.\n17:21 Comment: Legsteimer.\n17:23 Comment: Investments need to be earned back.\n17:25 Comment: Hidiro, serve.\n17:27 Comment: Alexandro picks up the ball too much.\n17:30 Comment: Here, next to him, was Hernanes.\n17:32 Comment: But Hidiro played forward in the attack.\n17:34 Comment: What, another offsite?\n17:36 Comment: In any case, the hosts have now confused the Naples defenders.\n17:39 Comment: And he confused Sandro, who is clearly left-handed, but made a serve with his right foot.\n17:44 Comment: Few expected this.\n17:46 Comment: Hidiro started a little at the wrong time.\n17:49 Comment: He found himself in an offside position.\n17:51 Comment: Here Levshan is already backing away and misses the ball.\n17:54 Comment: But that's not true.\n17:55 Comment: Dries Mertens is lonely.\n17:57 Comment: It will be difficult for him.\n17:58 Comment: Kicks the ball back.\n17:59 Comment: And what? Offsite again.\n18:1 Comment: Mertens was initially offside.\n18:3 Comment: Apparently, yes.\n18:5 Comment: Delayed signal from the arbitrator.\n18:12 Comment: Olegre said before the match that today, or rather, today the Scudetto will not be played out.\n18:17 Comment: This is a match for three points.\n18:19 Comment: Nothing more, it’s October.\n18:21 Comment: And as Olegre said, he says he won’t play around today.\n18:24 Comment: The game against Lyon on Wednesday is much more important for Juvi.\n18:31 Comment: Because in this game Juventus can book a ticket to the Champions League.\n18:35 Comment: Yes, and immediately relieve all this tension of the volumetric season.\n18:40 Comment: Always very, very difficult for large teams.\n18:43 Comment: In the fall, you need to preserve your strength and you need not to lose it all, not to play for explosions.\n18:51 Comment: On the left is Ghulyam's attack.\n18:53 Comment: Insigne Hamshik missed the touch.\n18:56 Comment: Where were you aiming?\n19:14 Comment: We welcome the audience of the Match TV channel.\n19:18 Comment: The central game, perhaps, of the first round of the Italian Championship.\n19:22 Comment: And, of course, this distance that has been covered, Juventus takes on Napoleon, ahead of the opponent by 4 points.\n19:30 Comment: Roma is between them.\n19:32 Comment: And this is incredibly important.\n19:37 Comment: Nobel Rustamyan, Alexander Shmurdov, together with you.\n19:39 Comment: We saw the head coach of the Italian national team.\n19:41 Comment: And in general, all eyes here, all attention is focused on the match in Turin.\n19:46 Comment: This is not a derby, dear friends. First of all, good evening everyone.\n19:49 Comment: This is not a derby, not a derby status.\n19:51 Comment: It’s certainly a fashionable word today in Russia.\n19:54 Comment: This is a fundamental match between the South and the North.\n19:57 Comment: Juventus is a popular northern team.\n19:59 Comment: Napoleon is the personification of the South of Italy.\n20:2 Comment: Therefore, this is also, to some extent, a hot Italian match.\n20:6 Comment: Juventus at their stadium.\n20:8 Comment: And the team as a whole spent the first 20 minutes busily, calmly, like a leader.\n20:14 Comment: But Napoleon very unexpectedly got down to business.\n20:18 Comment: Immediately Napoleon attacks a lot.\n20:20 Comment: Napoleon is bold and daring.\n20:24 Comment: And it's nice.\n20:25 Comment: And here is the first yellow card of the match.\n20:27 Comment: And Juventus defender Giorgio Cellini gets it.\n20:29 Comment: Let's briefly talk about the lineups for the Match TV audience.\n20:33 Comment: So, Juventus number one in goal is John Luigi Buffon.\n20:36 Comment: On defense is the third Kellyni.\n20:38 Comment: 19th Banucci, 15th Borzali.\n20:40 Comment: Flanks of the 12th Alexandrova, 26th Elik Steiner.\n20:43 Comment: Center field: 6th Hidiro, 11th Hernanes and 5th Pjanic.\n20:48 Comment: Forwards of the 9th Guai.\n20:50 Comment: 17th Majukic.\n20:51 Comment: Juventus coach Masimiliano Allegri.\n20:53 Comment: Higuain leaves Marquez Alan with the ball.\n20:57 Comment: But the Brazilian dealt brilliantly with his former partner.\n21:0 Comment: Of course, one of the most important intrigues of this confrontation.\n21:3 Comment: The game of Higuain, who was sold to Juventus by the Neapolitans for almost 100 million.\n21:9 Comment: Well, here you go, the second yellow card in 2 minutes.\n21:12 Comment: And the Juventus defender gets it again.\n21:15 Comment: But we clarify that Juve still has 3 defenders and 2 flank players.\n21:20 Comment: In Italy, as they say, in Italy.\n21:22 Comment: And now he’s just such a player.\n21:24 Comment: Alexandro, number 12.\n21:25 Comment: For this foul against Dries Mertens he receives a warning.\n21:29 Comment: The second yellow for Juventus and about the Napoli composition, briefly.\n21:33 Comment: Pepperaina, defensive goalkeeper.\n21:35 Comment: On the right is number 2 Hyusai.\n21:37 Comment: And on the left is the 31st Ghulyam.\n21:39 Comment: In the center is the 21st Kirikish, 26th Coulibaly.\n21:42 Comment: Midfield Diawara, 42nd.\n21:45 Comment: Marques Alan, 5th.\n21:46 Comment: Marek Hamsik, 17th.\n21:48 Comment: And the attack line is injury-free.\n21:50 Comment: Anatoly Milika, he is called to replace Higuain.\n21:53 Comment: And essentially replaced him at the start of the season.\n21:55 Comment: But he was out for a long time.\n21:57 Comment: 3 small forwards.\n21:58 Comment: Mertens, 14th.\n21:59 Comment: Kaleihon, 7th.\n22:0 Comment: And Insigna, Lorenzo Insigna, 24th.\n22:3 Comment: Because in the lineup, in the application, there is also his brother Robert.\n22:7 Comment: Alexandro, long pass forward.\n22:9 Comment: Coulibaly is on the spot.\n22:11 Comment: Everything is calm, everything is stable for Napoli in defense.\n22:14 Comment: The match is very, extremely important.\n22:16 Comment: Juventus has already lost twice to its direct, big rivals Inter and Milan.\n22:20 Comment: Therefore, of course, Juventus is vulnerable.\n22:22 Comment: Napoli has a chance to return itself to the Scudetto game.\n22:25 Comment: And also help Roma, who is also somewhere nearby at the top of the table.\n22:29 Comment: Well, I must say that, after all, losing to Milan and Inter today is not so scary.\n22:33 Comment: These are not direct competitors.\n22:35 Comment: But Napoli, perhaps, with a blow from Insigne.\n22:38 Comment: Innings.\n22:40 Comment: There was no rebound.\n22:42 Comment: They asked for a corner, maybe they can also reach an agreement with the referee.\n22:46 Comment: His name, by the way, is Gian-Luca Rocky.\n22:48 Comment: Here he is in front of you.\n22:50 Comment: Mare Hamshik.\n22:52 Comment: Leader of Napoli.\n22:54 Comment: A man who, despite a very difficult press in recent years, has remained a symbol of the team.\n23:5 Comment: There were seasons, or stretches of seasons, when Hamsik did absolutely nothing.\n23:11 Comment: But he really is a very big player.\n23:14 Comment: He is a symbol of Napoli, unlike Goncal Higuain.\n23:17 Comment: As I said later.\n23:18 Comment: Goncal Higuain is probably the main figure of today's match.\n23:20 Comment: A football player who was sold, well not sold, and Irlandus bought him, so to speak correctly, from Napoli for 90 million euros.\n23:27 Comment: And now Higuain is in a dangerous moment in the penalty area.\n23:29 Comment: And Goncal Higuain doesn't score.\n23:31 Comment: Well, bravo, Vlad Kirikesh.\n23:33 Comment: The Romanian defender catches up with the Argentine.\n23:35 Comment: Helps his goalkeeper.\n23:37 Comment: There will be a corner.\n23:39 Comment: Let's look again. Great pass from Sami Khidira.\n23:41 Comment: Kirikesh is in the way.\n23:43 Comment: And Pepperade.\n23:44 Comment: I already saw this somewhere today.\n23:46 Comment: Looks like the moment.\n23:47 Comment: They scored there.\n23:48 Comment: Yes, Ze Luis scored there.\n23:49 Comment: Match Spartak CSKA.\n23:51 Comment: Goncal Higuain doesn't score here.\n23:53 Comment: Although the moment was a little more complicated.\n23:55 Comment: The defender was also hanging on Goncal Higuain's leg.\n23:57 Comment: The fact of the matter is that Kirikesh played the episode to the end.\n24:0 Comment: Corner from the right flank.\n24:1 Comment: High feed.\n24:2 Comment: No, there won't be a hit.\n24:4 Comment: By the way, I think Kirikesh did it again.\n24:7 Comment: Well, the central defender must go to the receiving point, the arrival of the ball, yes.\n24:12 Comment: If the goalkeeper doesn't come out.\n24:14 Comment: And the serve was, of course, not for the goalkeeper.\n24:17 Comment: Kelineem plays with his head.\n24:19 Comment: Wins the fight.\n24:20 Comment: But there is no one there except Pepperin, the Spanish goalkeeper who is feeling very confident.\n24:25 Comment: Indeed, he has already entered the game a couple of times.\n24:28 Comment: And reliable in Naples.\n24:32 Comment: And the attack of Napoleon.\n24:33 Comment: Hamsik is not offside on the left flank.\n24:35 Comment: Accurate transmission required.\n24:36 Comment: This is the diagonal.\n24:38 Comment: With difficulty Borzali knocks the ball out.\n24:40 Comment: Calihon. Hit.\n24:41 Comment: Ricochet.\n24:42 Comment: Rebound from Alex Sandro's leg.\n24:44 Comment: And already a corner on the opposite half of the field.\n24:48 Comment: The teams keep an amazing pace.\n24:50 Comment: More than half the half.\n24:52 Comment: And most importantly, Napoleon is not afraid.\n24:54 Comment: This is the most important point.\n24:55 Comment: Naples in the last six matches here in Turin certainly lost to Juventus.\n25:0 Comment: Always. The last six times.\n25:2 Comment: Therefore, of course, the pressure, and the Italian press wrote about this, is on Naples.\n25:7 Comment: But Napoleon is good.\n25:9 Comment: First 25 minutes.\n25:11 Comment: Considering that Kirikis won the previous two episodes, we can say so, yes, and with Higuain, then after the corner they showed him for a reason.\n25:17 Comment: There was no prank here.\n25:19 Comment: The offsider was holding onto the bar.\n25:20 Comment: One of the Juve defenders.\n25:21 Comment: Innings. There will be a blow.\n25:22 Comment: No. The ball bounces.\n25:24 Comment: And, apparently, Kulebalin violated the rules.\n25:27 Comment: He sat down on his shoulders.\n25:29 Comment: Like grief.\n25:31 Comment: He climbed into the knapsack of his colleague, the Juventus defender.\n25:37 Comment: Look what Napoleon is doing.\n25:39 Comment: Yes, Napoleon regained the ball quite quickly.\n25:41 Comment: Diawara plays the Kulebalin.\n25:43 Comment: The one on Marik Hamsik.\n25:45 Comment: Napoli controls the ball well.\n25:47 Comment: And he holds it.\n25:48 Comment: In general, the important point is that under Sari, this was last year, Napoleon focuses and relies on ball control.\n25:54 Comment: On possession of the ball, on how to play exactly, hiding the opponent’s defense.\n25:59 Comment: Yes, Benitos had a different football.\n26:1 Comment: Although, in my opinion, he has already moved away from the counterattack model, from the obvious active use of the flanks, which was the case under Walter Mazzari.\n26:11 Comment: Current coach Napoleon has gone even further.\n26:14 Comment: He is building together with the president.\n26:17 Comment: With Aurelio Della Urentis.\n26:19 Comment: A club that will eventually get closer to the top in terms of mentality.\n26:25 Comment: That's what we're talking about.\n26:27 Comment: Licksteiner on the right flank.\n26:29 Comment: Throws the ball forward.\n26:31 Comment: But Ghulam is great.\n26:33 Comment: Places the body.\n26:35 Comment: And Licksteiner breaks the rules.\n26:37 Comment: Do you agree that Napoli has such a chance, even despite the sale of its most serious player, Higuain.\n26:44 Comment: In the end, many clubs are selling the same Juventus.\n26:46 Comment: Sasha, you're right.\n26:48 Comment: And I emphasize that a very important point is that Napoleon did not want to let Higuain go.\n26:53 Comment: Juventus and other teams made an offer for Higuain in the amount of 75 million euros.\n26:58 Comment: But Napoleon was categorically against it.\n27:1 Comment: Juve bought Higuain for only one reason.\n27:3 Comment: The amount of compensation was prescribed, the so-called clause in Europe.\n27:6 Comment: And that's why this deal happened.\n27:9 Comment: Napoleon did not sell it himself.\n27:11 Comment: Yes, I didn’t sell it for some modest money.\n27:14 Comment: I sold it for 90.\n27:16 Comment: It's funny to talk about the modesty of 70 million.\n27:18 Comment: But there is such a rule.\n27:20 Comment: Right now, for example, they are ready to sign 430 million euros for Neymar.\n27:25 Comment: Something completely transcendental.\n27:27 Comment: In my opinion, the budget of a decent country is small in Latin America.\n27:34 Comment: Calihon handles the ball.\n27:37 Comment: Pass to Hysai.\n27:39 Comment: The Albanian plays Alan.\n27:42 Comment: And here Alex Sandro comes into play.\n27:45 Comment: 0-0 no goals.\n27:46 Comment: But the game is by no means boring at the Juventus Stadium.\n27:48 Comment: No, not boring at all.\n27:50 Comment: And the most important thing is that Juventus does not yet clearly understand, apparently, how to play against this Napoleon.\n27:57 Comment: This is a home match.\n27:59 Comment: This is favorite status.\n28:1 Comment: You have Higuain, bought from this team.\n28:4 Comment: But still, still, during these 28 minutes, Juve did not impose anything on Napoleon.\n28:10 Comment: No will of your own.\n28:12 Comment: Alexandro throws to Mairo Majukic.\n28:15 Comment: Higuain.\n28:16 Comment: Hernanes.\n28:18 Comment: The Brazilian is not bad for Higuain.\n28:20 Comment: There is free space in front of him.\n28:22 Comment: How easily Higuain was neutralized.\n28:25 Comment: It was Koulibaly who took the ball away.\n28:26 Comment: He did such an important thing.\n28:28 Comment: For Naples.\n28:30 Comment: In general, of course, people in Naples don’t like Higuain very much after his summer action.\n28:35 Comment: And not only in the city, but also in the team.\n28:37 Comment: For example, Maurizo Sarri called Higuain...\n28:42 Comment: A child, a son who ran away from his parents' home.\n28:47 Comment: Literally betraying all my relatives.\n28:49 Comment: Yes, but there were a lot of words before this match.\n28:51 Comment: We need to remember that Juventus lost to Milan not so long ago, a week ago, in the round before last.\n28:55 Comment: Including due to a refereeing error.\n28:57 Comment: Interception by Napoleon in front of the penalty area.\n28:59 Comment: Four of them go forward.\n29:1 Comment: Hit.\n29:2 Comment: No, well, you can’t score against Bufon like that.\n29:6 Comment: You don't have to be a buffoon to deflect such balls.\n29:9 Comment: Bufonchik is enough.\n29:10 Comment: Alexandro.\n29:13 Comment: Another pass back.\n29:15 Comment: Kellyni is already here.\n29:17 Comment: And here he is John Luigi Bufon.\n29:23 Comment: That's it, all the rebounds are for Napoleon.\n29:25 Comment: Although now Pjanich was in the right place at the right time.\n29:28 Comment: Higuain in midfield.\n29:29 Comment: Pass to the left flank to Alex Sandro.\n29:32 Comment: We are talking about Juventus playing with two big forwards.\n29:35 Comment: This is not entirely usual for the team of Mandzhukichi and Higuain.\n29:37 Comment: But Gonzalo happily steps back.\n29:39 Comment: In general, this is in his manner.\n29:41 Comment: Licksteiner earns a free kick.\n29:43 Comment: We saw two yellow cards.\n29:44 Comment: We'll see the third one.\n29:45 Comment: Lorenzo Insigno receives.\n29:47 Comment: Probably the shortest footballer in the Italian Serie A.\n29:50 Comment: But at the same time very efficient.\n29:52 Comment: Well, such a grin at the referee from Maurizo Sarri.\n29:57 Comment: Yes, there was sarcasm in it.\n29:58 Comment: But we saw twice how Juventus defenders thwarted attacks.\n30:5 Comment: And it’s not like they played very roughly there.\n30:7 Comment: And Kellini, and then Alexandro.\n30:8 Comment: But they received cards precisely for depriving the opponent of the opportunity to continue a promising attack.\n30:15 Comment: And even on the other side of the field.\n30:18 Comment: And here Licksteiner was very, very close from the corner of the penalty area.\n30:22 Comment: Pjanic and Aleksandro are on the ball.\n30:26 Comment: Juventus is going to play the standard.\n30:29 Comment: Juventus scored three goals with their heads in the last round in the match against Sandori.\n30:33 Comment: Therefore, it is clear that Naples is well aware of this.\n30:36 Comment: Good game.\n30:38 Comment: High serve, drop, Mandzukic fights for the ball.\n30:41 Comment: But here Diawara helps the defenders, knocks the ball out wide.\n30:45 Comment: And Encini's wonderful run.\n30:47 Comment: Licksteiner understood perfectly well that it was impossible to throw this ball to Andrea Barzali to the goalkeeper.\n30:52 Comment: And immediately returns forward.\n30:54 Comment: But this is how a hidden avoidance of offside turned out.\n30:58 Comment: If Pjanic had been closer to the ball, he would have been in the right position.\n31:2 Comment: Yes, definitely.\n31:5 Comment: Amiralim Pjanic had the opportunity to escape.\n31:7 Comment: But the transmission was not the most comfortable for processing.\n31:11 Comment: That is, you need to understand this.\n31:13 Comment: A little more than half an hour is behind us in Turin.\n31:16 Comment: 0-0 Juventus Napoli.\n31:18 Comment: The central game of the Italian tour.\n31:21 Comment: Let us remind you once again that Juventus is the leader.\n31:23 Comment: He has 24 points.\n31:24 Comment: Next are Roma 22 and Napoli 20.\n31:27 Comment: In other words, having won Napoli, they can get closer to Juventus.\n31:31 Comment: And change the leader, yes, help change Roma.\n31:34 Comment: So tight, tight, everything.\n31:35 Comment: We're not quite used to this, it seems.\n31:38 Comment: But on the other hand, we must not forget about last season,\n31:40 Comment: when Juve is quite serious due to the restructuring.\n31:43 Comment: And in general, I’ve been in 10th place.\n31:47 Comment: At this time, at the end of October, Juventus were in 12th place.\n31:51 Comment: Maybe even 12.\n31:52 Comment: Therefore this is not surprising.\n31:53 Comment: Juventus then managed to change everything.\n31:55 Comment: But along the way there were big problems.\n31:57 Comment: Hidiro plays back to Kellyni.\n32:1 Comment: Translation by Leonardo Banucci.\n32:3 Comment: That one on Hernanez.\n32:5 Comment: And Brazilian.\n32:5 Comment: What will he come up with?\n32:8 Comment: Good pass to Hidiro.\n32:9 Comment: The one in the direction of Guaina.\n32:11 Comment: But Coulibaly films everything.\n32:13 Comment: Coulibaly played great once again.\n32:16 Comment: Gamshik to the right.\n32:17 Comment: Opens up the possibility for Naples to attack with the right flank.\n32:20 Comment: Ersit Hysaj paused.\n32:23 Comment: The Neapolitans will be happy to launch a positional attack.\n32:26 Comment: We see all of these 32 and a half minutes.\n32:31 Comment: Napoleon seems to be enjoying himself.\n32:34 Comment: Possession of the ball.\n32:35 Comment: Not in a big hurry.\n32:37 Comment: Although both of them had already created chances.\n32:41 Comment: Yes, Napoleon feels comfortable in Turin.\n32:44 Comment: This is already a fact for everyone.\n32:45 Comment: Although Ventus is now trying to take the ball to the center of the field.\n32:49 Comment: Apply pressure.\n32:50 Comment: But a violation of the rules by Mario Majukic on Diawara.\n32:56 Comment: Yes, there was a foul.\n32:58 Comment: Of course, there cannot be two opinions here.\n33:2 Comment: Vlad Kirikesh.\n33:4 Comment: Central defender of Napoleon.\n33:5 Comment: Translation.\n33:5 Comment: To the left.\n33:6 Comment: To Gulya.\n33:7 Comment: Malzhiretz.\n33:8 Comment: He plays technically.\n33:9 Comment: Next to Incinia.\n33:11 Comment: Florenzo Insini.\n33:12 Comment: Italian national team player.\n33:15 Comment: He was attracted, it seems to me, by dribbling.\n33:16 Comment: But in the end I kept the ball.\n33:17 Comment: Hysai.\n33:20 Comment: Juventus is retreating as a team.\n33:22 Comment: So we see the center of the forwards here.\n33:24 Comment: Banucci logically misses the ball.\n33:27 Comment: To Bufon.\n33:28 Comment: Well, how Juventus knows how to straighten up.\n33:31 Comment: How he knows how to win matches when the opponent does not give territory.\n33:34 Comment: We know very well too.\n33:35 Comment: This was particularly the case in last season’s match here.\n33:39 Comment: When Juventus was inferior to Napoleon at some points in the game.\n33:44 Comment: But in the end, reserve striker Simona Dzadze came out.\n33:49 Comment: And he scored essentially on a counterattack.\n33:52 Comment: Yes, it was essentially a golden goal for that championship, which changed a lot.\n33:55 Comment: Lorenzo Incinia, meanwhile, is with the ball.\n33:57 Comment: Pass into the penalty area.\n33:58 Comment: Excellent transfer of Bufon.\n34:0 Comment: Bufon is in place.\n34:1 Comment: Although Calijon was in the right zone.\n34:4 Comment: Calikhon died.\n34:5 Comment: Lorenzo Incini.\n34:6 Comment: Of course, it is very difficult to choose which of them will be a central striker given their size.\n34:13 Comment: But they are trying.\n34:14 Comment: They try to elude defenders.\n34:16 Comment: So they play in a scheme against each other.\n34:21 Comment: It seems to be very comfortable for both.\n34:23 Comment: Juventus has three strikers, three defenders.\n34:26 Comment: And it's the other way around.\n34:27 Comment: Juve has two central and two forwards.\n34:29 Comment: That's why it could be 0-0.\n34:31 Comment: Everyone has their own personal peek.\n34:35 Comment: Borzali on the right flank.\n34:40 Comment: Licksteiner.\n34:42 Comment: Pass towards Guain.\n34:45 Comment: Vlad Kirikish.\n34:46 Comment: Diawara is playing well.\n34:48 Comment: Go ahead Diawara.\n34:49 Comment: But Allan is here.\n34:51 Comment: How the Brazilian fought with his compatriot.\n34:55 Comment: Iernanes pushed Allan.\n34:58 Comment: He remained on the lawn.\n34:59 Comment: Well, of course.\n35:0 Comment: The drunkard will be persuaded now.\n35:2 Comment: Or the referee will be persuaded to stop the game.\n35:4 Comment: But it's not that.\n35:5 Comment: The fact is that maybe there was a fall there.\n35:10 Comment: Quite possible.\n35:11 Comment: Now we will figure it out on repeat.\n35:13 Comment: Rocky made this decision.\n35:16 Comment: He places one leg crossed.\n35:18 Comment: And maybe he plays this one correctly in the fight.\n35:21 Comment: Iernanes.\n35:22 Comment: But he cuts it down with his other foot.\n35:26 Comment: It was just not a neat tackle.\n35:27 Comment: And this is a violation of the rules.\n35:28 Comment: This is a violation that the referee did not notice.\n35:35 Comment: Iernanes.\n35:37 Comment: His place in the lineup was not so obvious.\n35:39 Comment: The fact is that Claudio Marchisio has finally recovered.\n35:44 Comment: He had a cruciate ligament injury.\n35:46 Comment: And he played for the first time in six months in the last round in a match against Sabdori.\n35:50 Comment: This was on Wednesday.\n35:51 Comment: But apparently they are taking care of Claudio Marchisio.\n35:54 Comment: They don't want to put too much pressure on it.\n35:56 Comment: And that’s why we need to rest today.\n35:57 Comment: Perhaps Marchisio will play the Champions League matches against Lyon.\n36:0 Comment: Which will be out next Wednesday.\n36:2 Comment: Yes, but the ball does come back to Youville.\n36:4 Comment: The referee did not determine a violation of the rules.\n36:7 Comment: Well, Alan, apparently, will be ready to return to the field.\n36:12 Comment: While Juve is attacking on the left flank.\n36:14 Comment: Alexandro Calijon moved to defense.\n36:17 Comment: And it prevents the Brazilian from moving forward.\n36:20 Comment: Alexandro again.\n36:22 Comment: I took a small step towards the 11-meter Mandzhuki.\n36:25 Comment: A little further away.\n36:26 Comment: Gonzalo Higuain.\n36:28 Comment: Juve plays the ball.\n36:30 Comment: We saw a little that Mandzhukin did not win.\n36:32 Comment: But that's not true.\n36:33 Comment: We saw few positional attacks by the hosts.\n36:36 Comment: During these 36 minutes, Napoleon does not allow his game to be played.\n36:40 Comment: However, what is your own game for Juventus?\n36:42 Comment: Sometimes even the counterattack model turns out to be very comfortable.\n36:46 Comment: Licksteiner.\n36:48 Comment: Encounter with Ghulam.\n36:49 Comment: There was, of course, no foul here.\n36:50 Comment: Licksteiner loves and knows how to fall beautifully.\n36:52 Comment: But this time I didn't buy it.\n36:54 Comment: Here's to this trick.\n36:56 Comment: Which Licksteiner himself sought contact with Ghulam.\n36:59 Comment: To have a reason to dive beautifully like that practically.\n37:2 Comment: Into the opponent's penalty area.\n37:4 Comment: Well, yes, if anyone violated, it was most likely Licksteiner.\n37:6 Comment: Licksteiner, of course.\n37:7 Comment: Good game ahead.\n37:9 Comment: Here, knowing that he is offside, he does not touch the ball.\n37:12 Comment: Although, in my opinion, Sasha, in my opinion, Higuain was not offside.\n37:15 Comment: Because Vlad Kilikish is still stuck there.\n37:17 Comment: Higuain could have played differently.\n37:20 Comment: Meanwhile, Dries Mertens.\n37:21 Comment: It was in vain that I hurried.\n37:23 Comment: Of course, Mertens played center.\n37:25 Comment: What happened there?\n37:27 Comment: We have to kick the ball out again.\n37:29 Comment: Jerked George Kellyni's muscle.\n37:32 Comment: They show Marchisio.\n37:37 Comment: Although, if Kellyni leaves, it is unlikely that Maximilian Olegre will release Marchisio.\n37:43 Comment: There is a defender named Rugani.\n37:45 Comment: There is Benatya.\n37:47 Comment: First of all, who is on the bench.\n37:50 Comment: And there's also Dani Alves.\n37:53 Comment: Who in the previous match against Sandori played one of the three central defenders.\n37:58 Comment: Which was very interesting.\n38:0 Comment: Well, they show us Mehdi Benatya.\n38:2 Comment: Maracano.\n38:5 Comment: With a French passport.\n38:7 Comment: And therefore in the European Union is not considered a foreigner.\n38:9 Comment: Apparently, he is the one coming out.\n38:15 Comment: Due to his warm-up, George Kellyni will not be able to continue the match.\n38:18 Comment: A loss.\n38:19 Comment: Still a loss for Juventus.\n38:21 Comment: Very calm composition.\n38:23 Comment: And Juventus has an excellent reserve team.\n38:25 Comment: I would not want to destroy such a structure.\n38:28 Comment: Oh-ho!\n38:29 Comment: What a choice!\n38:30 Comment: Wow!\n38:31 Comment: What is Massimiliano Allegri doing?\n38:34 Comment: It is not Menatio, not Rugani, not even Dani Alves who is releasing instead of Kellyni.\n38:39 Comment: And Juana Cuadrado.\n38:41 Comment: A brilliant attacking football player.\n38:43 Comment: And apparently Juventus is restructuring to a four-back formation.\n38:47 Comment: Because there isn't a single player from the rest of the roster, right?\n38:53 Comment: Who could play third with Manucci and Borzal.\n38:55 Comment: No.\n38:56 Comment: Not on the field.\n38:58 Comment: No.\n38:59 Comment: Of those who have now left.\n39:0 Comment: Therefore, it turns out Banucci, Borzal and two central defenders.\n39:3 Comment: Alexandro and Lichsteiner flank the defense.\n39:6 Comment: And then there is the line of midfielders and the attack.\n39:9 Comment: It's very strange because there is a player on each flank.\n39:12 Comment: Cuadrado comes out to support the Lichsteiner flag, apparently.\n39:16 Comment: This is the edge.\n39:17 Comment: Yes exactly.\n39:18 Comment: Well, it also needs to be said that with this scheme, Hernanes will move very deep.\n39:22 Comment: He loves to give out peppercorns.\n39:25 Comment: He jumped outside the penalty area and crashed into Alexandro, knocking the ball away.\n39:29 Comment: In my opinion, the Spanish goalkeeper now wants to prove that Alexandro played carelessly against him.\n39:35 Comment: You can show him the yellow one, which means delete it.\n39:38 Comment: Because Alexandro already has one yellow one.\n39:43 Comment: Well, like this.\n39:46 Comment: Sarri insists.\n39:47 Comment: Alexandro's leg was not exposed.\n39:49 Comment: I even hugged Pepper Alexandro when it happened at that moment.\n39:53 Comment: Therefore, of course, this is rather an attempt by Napoli to get, to earn Eventus a removal.\n39:59 Comment: Well, yes, it influences the referees.\n40:1 Comment: I just went to reserve referee Sarri to talk, and we already saw it on replay.\n40:6 Comment: Alexandro tried and tried to catch the pepper.\n40:14 Comment: Now Mario Majukic is also a great specialist in provocations on the football field.\n40:18 Comment: He is also trying to influence the pepper.\n40:21 Comment: Fuck those Italian games.\n40:23 Comment: You see, the long dispute between Majukic and Rein.\n40:26 Comment: How can that Spaniard put the ball into play?\n40:28 Comment: To this day, Majukic cannot keep up with Reina.\n40:31 Comment: Reyna started first.\n40:33 Comment: Here he put his hand quite openly forward, pushing Madzukic away.\n40:38 Comment: They showed Jorginho and the Napoli bench in general.\n40:41 Comment: Eventus has a choice, we talk about it a lot.\n40:44 Comment: But Napoli in today's squad also does not have 12 players, as it played last season.\n40:50 Comment: They also got a bench length.\n40:52 Comment: Not at all, of course. There are football players, there is Jocherini, there is, by the way, Jorginho, there is Piotr Zelinsky.\n40:57 Comment: There are Marco Rocca, in fact, football players who can take the field.\n41:1 Comment: Diawara is still playing quite confidently on the right flank.\n41:4 Comment: He is only 18 years old.\n41:6 Comment: And such a confident play in the center of the field.\n41:8 Comment: Here he is with the ball, and Diawara is in hell.\n41:10 Comment: Gamshik.\n41:12 Comment: Here is Kirikish.\n41:15 Comment: And Kirikish is wrong.\n41:18 Comment: But the ball flies towards the Napoli goal.\n41:20 Comment: And there is absolutely no chance for any of Yuvi’s attackers to catch on there.\n41:24 Comment: The attack on the right flank begins again.\n41:27 Comment: Hysai.\n41:29 Comment: Alan.\n41:31 Comment: Well turned around.\n41:35 Comment: They have a duel with Hernandez. Almost every 2-3 minutes.\n41:38 Comment: Well, of course, they play in a similar manner.\n41:41 Comment: Although Hernandez, of course, can also be a dispatcher.\n41:43 Comment: And Marco said Alan is clean.\n41:45 Comment: A real Brazilian number five.\n41:50 Comment: Eliksteiner.\n41:54 Comment: Leonardo Banucci.\n41:55 Comment: Pass to Andre Bartoni.\n41:57 Comment: Azali.\n41:58 Comment: That's one touch.\n41:59 Comment: Good on Alex Sandro.\n42:0 Comment: Well, let's celebrate again and again.\n42:2 Comment: We said that in passing.\n42:3 Comment: Juventus and Allegri can change from three to four defenders and back.\n42:9 Comment: Well, how to change clothes, like Carlson changed his socks.\n42:12 Comment: Right to left, left to right.\n42:13 Comment: Nothing happened.\n42:15 Comment: Diawara.\n42:16 Comment: In the center of the field.\n42:18 Comment: Dries Mertens plays well.\n42:19 Comment: Diawara is back with the ball.\n42:21 Comment: Mertens.\n42:22 Comment: To the right flank towards Hysai.\n42:23 Comment: And Napoli's attack began.\n42:25 Comment: And four people fell behind.\n42:26 Comment: And four people opened up near the penalty area.\n42:27 Comment: Kaliekhon misses the ball.\n42:28 Comment: A partner was already flashing there.\n42:29 Comment: But we need to continue this attack.\n42:30 Comment: They didn't let me in.\n42:31 Comment: On the flank of Jose Calliejon.\n42:32 Comment: But the rebound is for Napoli.\n42:33 Comment: And there will be no whistle here.\n42:34 Comment: You can continue to attack Diavar.\n42:35 Comment: Mertens did not handle the ball very carefully.\n42:36 Comment: Lost.\n42:37 Comment: Juve's third loss in one attack.\n42:38 Comment: And, in my opinion, it will end with a penalty in the end.\n42:39 Comment: And perhaps a yellow card for Miralem Pjanic for the foul.\n42:40 Comment: Almost all.\n42:41 Comment: And so, as you see, Diawara, like everyone else,\n42:42 Comment: vs Dries Mertens.\n42:43 Comment: Andre Barzali argues.\n42:44 Comment: But in any case, Ventus is obvious, if we take it as a whole\n42:45 Comment: first half, Napoli concedes.\n42:46 Comment: In many aspects.\n42:47 Comment: I would still... Well, of course, the glass is always half full\n42:48 Comment: empty, half full.\n42:49 Comment: And there seems to be no difference.\n42:50 Comment: But lately, I think Mertens has...\n42:51 Comment: won.\n42:52 Comment: Yes.\n42:53 Comment: But, in my opinion, this is the first thing.\n42:54 Comment: And, of course, first of all.\n42:55 Comment: And perhaps it will be a ball.\n42:56 Comment: And, probably, Kaliekhon, in my opinion, will be a ball.\n42:57 Comment: But, in my opinion, it will be a ball.\n42:58 Comment: Borzali, but anyway\n43:0 Comment: Juventus obviously, that's if\n43:2 Comment: take the first half as a whole,\n43:4 Comment: Napoleo is inferior in many aspects.\n43:7 Comment: I would still, well, of course,\n43:8 Comment: the glass is half empty and half full\n43:10 Comment: and there seems to be no difference,\n43:12 Comment: but I would rephrase it. Napoleo\n43:14 Comment: Juventus beats.\n43:17 Comment: Maybe. Means,\n43:18 Comment: It was not for nothing that they showed us Marchisio, because\n43:20 Comment: one of the main problems lies in the center of the field\n43:22 Comment: Juve. Not the best quality game\n43:24 Comment: Hernanez, in my opinion, and therefore\n43:26 Comment: I think Marchisio is entering the field\n43:28 Comment: quite a real story. At Juventus\n43:30 Comment: the ball doesn't stay centered\n43:32 Comment: fields. But after what's left\n43:34 Comment: two central defenders, needed here\n43:36 Comment: such a support that will be very deep\n43:38 Comment: play. I can't imagine Pyanich\n43:39 Comment: or Khidiru, who will go down into the sleeve. I represent Marchisio.\n43:43 Comment: What, number five?\n43:44 Comment: Certainly. Well, let's see. Let's look at the forecast\n43:46 Comment: Nobel Rustamyan for the second half.\n43:48 Comment: It is clear that there will be no replacement before the break.\n43:50 Comment: And now a free kick\n43:51 Comment: 45th.\n43:54 Comment: Perhaps not the last minute of the first\n43:56 Comment: half. There were stops and they will add\n43:58 Comment: Gianlu Carocchi for a couple of minutes.\n44:0 Comment: And this is the moment. This is the moment.\n44:2 Comment: We also need to go for rebounds.\n44:4 Comment: Restored very meticulously\n44:6 Comment: wall\n44:6 Comment: judge. So, what about the pitch?\n44:11 Comment: Throwing a walking meter or hitting?\n44:13 Comment: An attempt to break through the near corner.\n44:15 Comment: I think these are seeds for\n44:17 Comment: Bufona. From here\n44:19 Comment: Uzi Gulamu\n44:21 Comment: basically it was impossible to score. This time\n44:23 Comment: near corner. If only Bufon\n44:25 Comment: won't slip or yourself\n44:28 Comment: beckons. Attempt. Attempt\n44:29 Comment: Napoli. Bufon\n44:31 Comment: no option to play\n44:34 Comment: pass your neighbor. We have to\n44:35 Comment: hit forward. Direction\n44:36 Comment: left flank. And here is Ventus\n44:39 Comment: barely earns money\n44:41 Comment: out.\n44:44 Comment: Barzali.\n44:45 Comment: Pass to Leonardo Banucci. It's on the left\n44:47 Comment: flank only out. And if on the right, then\n44:49 Comment: just out.\n44:51 Comment: This is true. Where does Lichsteiner play?\n44:54 Comment: Square. Here we look at the right flank.\n44:55 Comment: How will he work for Juve now?\n44:58 Comment: Stefan Lichsteiner moved a little deeper.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: and they just showed a large treasure of Vlad Chirikis, the Romanian central defender of Napoli, he saved, then during the break we managed to watch several replays, it didn’t come to Pippi Reina, the Napoli defender knocked the ball out, literally took it off his feet, blocked Gonzalo Higuai’s shot\n0:15 Comment: an important point, Juventus is obliged to change the situation on the field, Juventus is playing at home, don’t forget about it, so playing the whole match without the ball as number two is not entirely correct, even from the point of view of the club’s philosophy, Higuain lost the ball\n0:32 Comment: yes, there are losses right there, this speaks of the density of Napoli’s play in the center of the field, excellent pass, forward Encini, then Callijon, pause, Encini with the ball, not even for him with his excellent starting speed\n0:45 Comment: and further\n0:45 Comment: even at the beginning of the attack there was not enough agility here\n0:50 Comment: Banucci figured out a difficult situation, passed to Alex Sandro, he was not bad, it turned out even better to Kvadratov, a pass from Diavar, and now Kvadratov has a chance to accelerate, a good pass to Pyanich, but Pyanich simply did not have time to handle the ball\n1:7 Comment: well, Juventus also launches its counterattacks very quickly, that very Higuain moment that we remembered, it is essentially the result\n1:15 Comment: result\n1:15 Comment: attack, we can say that Olegrie accepted the game with black on his field, there is nothing shameful in this, absolutely, Italian teams always make very serious plans, a tactically fruitful opening idea should be, well, today we see this Juventus, passing from the depths of the field , no offside, Encini is in control of the ball, no, no, no, no, no, no, they didn’t let me do anything, Bufon stood waiting for the Belgian\n1:44 Comment: but there is no such thing\n1:45 Comment: short Mertens that he could not\n1:48 Comment: put the corps in the fight against Borzalia,\n1:50 Comment: with Bufon, that's why he lost the ball so easily.\n1:52 Comment: Well, yes, 1.69 mertens.\n1:54 Comment: Lorenzo Incini, if he were there,\n1:56 Comment: his chances may have been even less.\n1:58 Comment: 1.63. One of the most\n2:0 Comment: undersized Serie A players.\n2:2 Comment: Well, actually, Kaliekhon, who has to\n2:4 Comment: sometimes help them.\n2:6 Comment: Up to 1.80 meters.\n2:8 Comment: The meter, in my opinion, is 77 times it.\n2:11 Comment: And this is how it has to be\n2:12 Comment: after the sale of Higuain\n2:14 Comment: and injuries to Arkady Shamilik\n2:16 Comment: play Neapolitan.\n2:18 Comment: And it was Higuain who launched the attack\n2:20 Comment: pass to Juan Quadrana.

And loss.\n2:37 Comment: Alexander didn't play very convincingly.\n2:39 Comment: After just three passes he comes out\n2:40 Comment: Neapolitan. And what?

Banucci here\n3:44 Comment: claims for this foul, which\n3:46 Comment: was, but the referee\n3:48 Comment: didn't register it.\n3:50 Comment: In my opinion, no serious rudeness\n3:53 Comment: there was no such thing from Mertens.

Juventus is ahead. Right\n5:20 Comment: attack. Higuain serves for Mandzukic\n5:22 Comment: a bit far. We'll be there later\n5:24 Comment: I'll probably figure it out on replays, who\n5:26 Comment: So he gave out a terrible transmission.\n5:29 Comment: And of course there could be no offside.\n5:30 Comment: Because the ball flew away from the Naples defender.\n5:32 Comment: Turning kick.\n5:35 Comment: It's a difficult moment.

And Gazalo Higuaina.\n9:33 Comment: Which is somewhat dazed\n9:35 Comment: happening in Naples.\n9:37 Comment: Under him, Napoli did not play like that.\n9:39 Comment: I thought it was Kalihon.\n9:42 Comment: Looking at me. Scores.\n9:44 Comment: Higuain thinks. No pipes.\n9:46 Comment: Hernanes. Brazilian\n9:48 Comment: plays well. Nomerolima Pjanic.\n9:50 Comment: The same penalty dangerous moment. Maybe not.\n9:52 Comment: Pjanic failed to make the pass.\n9:54 Comment: This is Alan. Well, incredibly interesting\n9:56 Comment: how both teams will behave. Because we talked\n9:58 Comment: at the beginning of the second half. Juventus needs\n10:0 Comment: different football. We need home football.\n10:2 Comment: Leadership.\n10:3 Comment: Where's the favorite here? And they\n10:5 Comment: generally proven. Because for a reason\n10:7 Comment: the ball was there near the penalty area. They\n10:9 Comment: managed to do it yourself. Maybe a little\n10:12 Comment: pick it up and continue\n10:14 Comment: Attack. Just how we missed the return goal.\n10:16 Comment: Banuchi's show is amazing\n10:18 Comment: to Alex Sandro. That\n10:19 Comment: arranged tribling. Hernanes is in the penalty area.\n10:22 Comment: Hit. No. Players are blocking\n10:23 Comment: on the field. Sami Khidira.\n10:26 Comment: Briefly with Lichsteiner.\n10:28 Comment: And he is already returning\n10:30 Comment: ball to a player of the German national team.\n10:31 Comment: It became a little rough on the right flank. Reina\n10:33 Comment: will come out of the gate. He will take the ball. Not good.\n10:36 Comment: Honestly, I don't really understand\n10:38 Comment: Quadrado exit. He\n10:39 Comment: I cut off a piece of Lichsteiner on one side.\n10:42 Comment: And he went out to some\n10:43 Comment: limited role.\n10:46 Comment: Like it's secondary.\n10:48 Comment: But in other way\n10:50 Comment: after all, this is perestroika\n10:52 Comment: to which Olegre\n10:53 Comment: the ball was decided instantly.\n10:56 Comment: And this is not a forced move at all.\n10:57 Comment: Let us remind you again. George Kellyni was injured.\n11:0 Comment: And it wasn’t the central defender who came out.\n11:1 Comment: But rather an attacking pass from deep.\n11:4 Comment: Very dangerous. Reyna comes out of the gate.\n11:5 Comment: Who will get the ball?\n11:7 Comment: Quadrado. Sami Khidira.\n11:11 Comment: Need to\n11:12 Comment: continuation of the attack. The Khidira themselves are actively looking for him.\n11:14 Comment: But we have to play back to Andre Barzali.\n11:17 Comment: Barzali on\n11:18 Comment: Hernanez.\n11:20 Comment: Further to the right there is a partner.\n11:22 Comment: Lichsteiner went to attack Quadrado.\n11:24 Comment: The two of them are already on the right flag.\n11:25 Comment: The quadrado moves to the center.\n11:27 Comment: Khidira. Khidira works with the ball for a long time.\n11:30 Comment: Pass to Lichsteiner. Innings\n11:32 Comment: into the penalty area. Guain!\n11:34 Comment: Great like Curibali\n11:35 Comment: settled down calmly.\n11:38 Comment: Took an extra step\n11:40 Comment: at the moment when it was needed.\n11:42 Comment: Blue on Marka Gapchik.\n11:43 Comment: 3 in 2 attack.\n11:45 Comment: There is Kalikhon. On the right is Kalikhon.\n11:48 Comment: I decided to break through\n11:49 Comment: with instant current Sani.\n11:52 Comment: Or was it a pass?\n11:53 Comment: There may have been a return transmission.\n11:55 Comment: They probably didn't decide the attack in the best way.\n11:57 Comment: How did football go?\n11:59 Comment: There may be less Italian left in him,\n12:2 Comment: than Juventus fans would like.\n12:4 Comment: They're used to it calmly\n12:5 Comment: outplay your opponents.\n12:7 Comment: Even if they disappeared. But now I have to get involved\n12:9 Comment: into this game.\n12:12 Comment: Blow for blow. Attack on attack.\n12:14 Comment: Napoli doesn't want\n12:15 Comment: even with this score 1-1\n12:17 Comment: be satisfied with a quick return goal.\n12:20 Comment: Diamara.\n12:21 Comment: Napoli understands, the players understand,\n12:23 Comment: and Sari understands what Juventus is like\n12:25 Comment: can be beaten in Turin.\n12:27 Comment: This will be an event in the last five matches.\n12:30 Comment: Juventus will definitely win\n12:32 Comment: Napoli is here. And Napoli\n12:33 Comment: scored in five matches only\n12:35 Comment: one goal at Juventus stadium.\n12:38 Comment: Of course, fantastic statistics\n12:40 Comment: for the old lady. But Napoli\n12:41 Comment: trying\n12:42 Comment: change it today.\n12:43 Comment: Well, by the way, he scored then too, getting even\n12:46 Comment: at the beginning of the second half.\n12:48 Comment: But in the end it’s still Juventus\n12:50 Comment: was stronger. It was a good match.\n12:52 Comment: Juve won 3-1.\n12:53 Comment: Led the entire first half.\n12:56 Comment: 1-1 in the 50th minute.\n12:58 Comment: And today, I guess\n13:0 Comment: Juventus fans are confident in their souls\n13:2 Comment: what their team knows\n13:4 Comment: how to make the ending stronger again.\n13:6 Comment: But, hand on heart,\n13:9 Comment: answer, you are like that\n13:10 Comment: When have you seen Napoli?\n13:12 Comment: Next time.\n13:13 Comment: Lorenzo Encines is back with the ball. Shot on goal.\n13:16 Comment: And he went to pick up the ball himself.\n13:18 Comment: But it's very cool here\n13:20 Comment: played by Stefan Licksteiner.\n13:21 Comment: And then Kvadradova offers the Swiss\n13:23 Comment: open the flank. And the two of them are already moving forward.\n13:26 Comment: There are partners in the center. Kulebali.\n13:29 Comment: Interception.\n13:30 Comment: And then the attack.\n13:32 Comment: Alan Marques will receive the ball. Goes for three.\n13:34 Comment: Borzali is a little heavy.\n13:35 Comment: But Alan is tired.\n13:38 Comment: Choked in his run.\n13:40 Comment: Kvadradova. Pass forward.\n13:42 Comment: Gonsal Eguaina. Thoth against Husay.\n13:44 Comment: But also Pepperine. How is he playing today?\n13:46 Comment: Very often he cleans up\n13:48 Comment: behind the defenders.\n13:49 Comment: Yes, you can say in the rooms.\n13:51 Comment: Well, essentially, yes.\n13:53 Comment: And here it is. Perfect transmission\n13:55 Comment: by Lorenzo Encines.\n13:56 Comment: Well, let's give him Kalijo. But he didn’t invent anything.\n13:59 Comment: Invent with the first touch.\n14:1 Comment: Cheek to the far corner.\n14:3 Comment: No options for Jen Luigi Buffon.\n14:6 Comment: Khidira.\n14:11 Comment: Borzali.\n14:12 Comment: Both Puffin and Ventus have to exchange passes like this\n14:15 Comment: central defender. Licksteiner.\n14:18 Comment: Well, no matter what kind of pure flank striker Kalihon is,\n14:22 Comment: this is the man who scores\n14:23 Comment: his seventh goal in the championship.\n14:26 Comment: This is a forward. Real.\n14:27 Comment: Milik is missing. Please, Kalihon plays.\n14:30 Comment: He has amazing results.\n14:31 Comment: Well, Lorenzo Encine hasn't scored yet.\n14:34 Comment: Naples' best passer this season.\n14:36 Comment: Lorenzo has the fourth assist.\n14:38 Comment: So this combination\n14:40 Comment: absolutely to the point.\n14:42 Comment: This is thoughtfully deserved.\n14:43 Comment: Hernanes.\n14:46 Comment: Banucci. Very often Banucci plays\n14:48 Comment: as a dispatcher.\n14:49 Comment: But this is Banucci's mistake.\n14:51 Comment: And Mark Hamsik has an opportunity\n14:52 Comment: develop Naples' attack. Pass on Ensign.\n14:56 Comment: A beautiful pause.\n14:57 Comment: But here Mertens is nearby.\n14:59 Comment: Again Encine misses Diabara's ball.\n15:1 Comment: Diabar's kick is a bit high.\n15:3 Comment: A little. Well, not a little. Twice as high as necessary.\n15:6 Comment: The young defender shot.\n15:7 Comment: Naples goalkeeper.\n15:9 Comment: And here is the replacement. The replacement that\n15:11 Comment: many were waiting. The fact is that\n15:13 Comment: Jackerine in this stadium\n15:15 Comment: won a trophy with Juventus.\n15:17 Comment: This is where the audience looks like. Well, maybe he has his own\n15:19 Comment: additional emotions. He wasn't really eager to come here.\n15:21 Comment: And I wanted to play in this match.\n15:23 Comment: Well, in fact, this is where Jackerina\n15:25 Comment: became a player for the Italian national team.\n15:28 Comment: And, in fact, he played two tournaments\n15:29 Comment: wonderful. Two European Championships\n15:31 Comment: in Poland and Ukraine. And of course,\n15:33 Comment: French. And especially,\n15:35 Comment: when it seemed like they were no longer waiting. This\n15:38 Comment: French Euro Championship\n15:39 Comment: 2016. Jekerine ahead.\n15:41 Comment: And he played just incredible\n15:44 Comment: healthy. He hit 13 kilometers.\n15:46 Comment: Sasha, well, on the other hand, reaction\n15:47 Comment: Incini is also acquitted. He played, after all, wonderfully.\n15:50 Comment: And they changed it.\n15:51 Comment: I am surprised. I am surprised. Another one\n15:53 Comment: yellow card. This time Hernanes. I think,\n15:55 Comment: that Yuvi has him as the main candidate for replacement. For a long time\n15:57 Comment: already. You know, Nobel, I\n15:59 Comment: in principle, with your own assessment of the possibilities\n16:2 Comment: Hernanez doesn't entirely agree.\n16:4 Comment: He's a bit of a strange player.\n16:5 Comment: He was like that in Latz too. He came\n16:7 Comment: to Juventus. He still can’t reach himself.\n16:9 Comment: But Hernanes\n16:10 Comment: Not\n16:11 Comment: an incredibly diverse defensive midfielder.\n16:13 Comment: That is, the supporting one, which turns\n16:15 Comment: to ten and back.\n16:18 Comment: I'm afraid he has\n16:19 Comment: little time left at Juventus\n16:21 Comment: prove yourself. May be.\n16:23 Comment: But this\n16:24 Comment: is far from a superfluous figure.\n16:28 Comment: Barzali.\n16:29 Comment: Hernanes is on again. Played by Alex Sandro.\n16:32 Comment: That one forward.\n16:33 Comment: In the direction of Goen. And Gohan is good\n16:35 Comment: throws the ball to Majukic.\n16:37 Comment: And already Mario Majukic.\n16:38 Comment: Against him. Against him. Very\n16:40 Comment: exactly.\n16:41 Comment: The defender is positioned. Connects\n16:43 Comment: Majukic. Pyanich. Transfer by\n16:45 Comment: diagonally back. And Gohan\n16:47 Comment: They don't let me beat you. Khedira. Quadrado.\n16:50 Comment: Tricky pass. But the ball\n16:51 Comment: hit the Jokerina, who had already\n16:53 Comment: participate. Although he probably went out\n16:55 Comment: neither there nor on defense.\n16:57 Comment: But this man\n16:58 Comment: fantastic performance.\n17:2 Comment: By the way, from the point of view\n17:3 Comment: physical capabilities\n17:5 Comment: Napoleon didn't win. Jokerina\n17:6 Comment: about the same height as\n17:9 Comment: Incine. Meter sixty five.\n17:11 Comment: If I am not mistaken. And Emmanuel's\n17:13 Comment: Jokerina.\n17:15 Comment: Hides his ideas.\n17:18 Comment: And replacements are ahead.\n17:19 Comment: Juvertus has Max\n17:21 Comment: Allegri. Pjanic in front of the penalty area.\n17:23 Comment: Coulibaly. And what is Coulibaly doing?\n17:25 Comment: Today? And again a chance\n17:27 Comment: for a quick attack. Transfer to the center.\n17:29 Comment: Manages to play.\n17:31 Comment: A little back Mertens. Didn't climb\n17:33 Comment: is he upside? Yes. It was.\n17:36 Comment: Sixty three minutes\n17:37 Comment: Behind us is the Juventus stadium. Wonderful\n17:39 Comment: football. Juventus on the field. One\n17:41 Comment: for one. Italian central match\n17:43 Comment: tour. And let us remind you again. Four\n17:45 Comment: points difference between these teams.\n17:47 Comment: And right in the middle\n17:49 Comment: Roma. She's twenty-two. Twenty four\n17:51 Comment: at Juve. Twenty at Napoleon.\n17:53 Comment: And the fight for\n17:54 Comment: Well, let's call it half a position.\n17:57 Comment: Like in racing. Which today\n17:59 Comment: we saw it too. Just\n18:1 Comment: qualification.\n18:3 Comment: It's a struggle for the winter\n18:5 Comment: leave feeling\n18:7 Comment: feel comfortable.\n18:9 Comment: Banuche. Pass to the right flank.\n18:11 Comment: Ecksteiner.\n18:14 Comment: Bad.\n18:15 Comment: Bad pass to Majukic. However\n18:17 Comment: interception No. It doesn't work out\n18:19 Comment: Higuaina intercepts the ball. Alan\n18:21 Comment: cleans up everything after everyone.\n18:23 Comment: Napoleon really looks very monolithic\n18:25 Comment: and strong. Very high quality match\n18:27 Comment: from Maurizio Sarri's team.\n18:30 Comment: Indeed, even though\n18:31 Comment: for individual mistakes, here's the kick\n18:33 Comment: sad\n18:35 Comment: for Fauzi Ghulam. Agree\n18:37 Comment: with your definition. They are as one\n18:39 Comment: team.\n18:41 Comment: Now maybe even defeat\n18:43 Comment: from Besiktas in the Champions League\n18:44 Comment: Napoleon was a little upset. They're completely different\n18:47 Comment: reacted. Although\n18:49 Comment: What's there to tune in to Juventus?\n18:52 Comment: There is no need for extra attitude.\n18:54 Comment: Absolutely right. For Napoleon\n18:55 Comment: this is a very important match.\n18:57 Comment: In Naples, in the city\n18:59 Comment: They hate Juventus. This is the most\n19:1 Comment: correct definition. And even more so\n19:3 Comment: after the story with Higuain.\n19:7 Comment: Bufon.\n19:8 Comment: Plays calmly\n19:9 Comment: Gian Luigio Bufon.\n19:11 Comment: But Coulibaly answers him in exactly the same way.\n19:13 Comment: And instantly translates again\n19:15 Comment: attack game\n19:16 Comment: Neapolitans. Here they connect the defender on the left\n19:19 Comment: Fauzi Ghulam. He doesn't need\n19:21 Comment: to be shy. Diamara.\n19:23 Comment: Hamshek. They took the ball. Again\n19:25 Comment: took the ball. 1-1. Michya visiting\n19:27 Comment: at Juventus.\n19:29 Comment: This is a springboard for searching\n19:31 Comment: victory. For Napoleon\n19:33 Comment: Hamshek played well now.\n19:35 Comment: Penetrating pass to the flank. But\n19:37 Comment: managed to close Turinets.\n19:39 Comment: The pass turns out good. Banned.\n19:41 Comment: Romajuki Chuck. And here\n19:43 Comment: Gonzalo Higuain is already going to press\n19:45 Comment: Coulibaly. Takes risks\n19:47 Comment: Coulibaly, but still overplays\n19:49 Comment: Higuaina. He tried himself\n19:51 Comment: on braking. Yes, that's how I played it\n19:53 Comment: with an opponent.\n19:55 Comment: In general, this confidence of the central\n19:57 Comment: a defender means a lot\n19:59 Comment: in modern football. How are you\n20:1 Comment: are you launching an attack? Due to what?\n20:4 Comment: Are you nervous?\n20:5 Comment: When do they start putting pressure on you? When\n20:7 Comment: Are they pressing by 5 or 6? Or are you ready\n20:9 Comment: through the pats to get out of defense?\n20:11 Comment: Yes.\n20:11 Comment: This generally changes the internal state.\n20:14 Comment: Temperature and even\n20:15 Comment: team consciousness.\n20:16 Comment: Kedira. Licksteiner.\n20:20 Comment: You don't have to go back like that\n20:21 Comment: play Juventus at Bufona.\n20:23 Comment: And look, three players\n20:25 Comment: the defenders are already on the field.\n20:27 Comment: On the feet of the defenders. Juve Sandro.\n20:31 Comment: For the side, and maybe even more\n20:33 Comment: will fight. No. Jose Calijon. This ball\n20:35 Comment: won't catch up. Anyway\n20:36 Comment: Juventus again\n20:39 Comment: didn't get close to the penalty area.\n20:41 Comment: Hernanez plays backwards. Andrea Barzali\n20:43 Comment: and Bufon.\n20:50 Comment: Licksteiner.\n20:53 Comment: Khedira. Khedira went ahead.\n20:56 Comment: Today was not his best match.\n20:58 Comment: Look, you're already\n20:59 Comment: Hernanes said.\n21:1 Comment: There is still Pyanich left.\n21:2 Comment: This again, in my opinion,\n21:6 Comment: credit to Napoli.\n21:7 Comment: First of all, Alexander Smechev. It's a free kick.\n21:9 Comment: Dangerous Pyanich.\n21:11 Comment: Cross feed. A little confused.\n21:14 Comment: Got stuck in my own\n21:15 Comment: feintah Miralin Pjanich. Square.\n21:17 Comment: High feed. There will be a blow.\n21:20 Comment: No discount. To a free place\n21:21 Comment: Calijon will pick up the ball. Only with the help\n21:23 Comment: Juventus cross threatens goal\n21:25 Comment: Peperaina. Higuain tackle.\n21:27 Comment: Pepita Higuaina. And there are no violations\n21:29 Comment: rules I think he\n21:31 Comment: I really didn't notice that I touched the ball.\n21:34 Comment: Rolling under an opponent.\n21:36 Comment: And already begged for an out\n21:37 Comment: for the umpteenth time.\n21:41 Comment: Not being able to do anything\n21:43 Comment: something useful to do for the team.\n21:45 Comment: This is how Higuain mostly talks.\n21:47 Comment: But remember that it opened well\n21:49 Comment: in the first half. Which almost\n21:51 Comment: scored. Then Vlad Kirikish helped out\n21:53 Comment: on the way. He's good at playing along. Basically\n21:55 Comment: today throughout the match. And he often\n21:57 Comment: creates attacks. But at the same time\n21:59 Comment: They expect him to score goals and replace him\n22:1 Comment: Juventus and Claudio Marchisio instead\n22:3 Comment: Pyanich. Instead of Pyanich.\n22:5 Comment: Which is interesting.\n22:7 Comment: And I agree. I don't see any problems\n22:9 Comment: neither Hidira nor Hernanes. Especially against\n22:11 Comment: of this Napoleon will have to spend the entire second\n22:13 Comment: half. Well, how much is left? Quarter\n22:15 Comment: match. Play a lot\n22:17 Comment: in the defense zone.\n22:19 Comment: Midfield. But in phase\n22:21 Comment: defensive. And therefore Khidira\n22:23 Comment: and Hernanes remain on the field.\n22:25 Comment: This is my time.\n22:27 Comment: Square.\n22:31 Comment: Licksteiner. Juventus again\n22:33 Comment: somewhat perplexed.\n22:35 Comment: What to do with the ball? And just like that\n22:37 Comment: pass back to Bufon.\n22:39 Comment: Banucci.\n22:41 Comment: Marchisio.\n22:43 Comment: Claudio Marchisio with the ball.\n22:46 Comment: I think Juventus is putting to sleep\n22:47 Comment: opponent, so that just in the 80th minute\n22:49 Comment: Maybe. How does this happen to him very often?\n22:52 Comment: It happens. Turn around\n22:54 Comment: in a counterattack with Leon.\n22:56 Comment: If you remember, it was a similar story.\n22:58 Comment: In principle, Leon played very well\n23:0 Comment: home match of the Champions League.\n23:1 Comment: A week and a half ago. But Juventus scored\n23:4 Comment: in the end. And he also scored\n23:6 Comment: in the minority. Because Leon has already\n23:7 Comment: I didn’t seem to be waiting for this moment.\n23:11 Comment: Now Hernanes is beautiful\n23:14 Comment: pass to Quadrado. And already\n23:15 Comment: Quan Quadrado. Hernanes.\n23:18 Comment: Shot on goal. Coulibaly\n23:19 Comment: He also blocks all blows. Second try\n23:22 Comment: Hernanez. Above the gate.\n23:27 Comment: They just announced for Juventus\n23:29 Comment: stadium about replacement.\n23:32 Comment: Well, basically everything has been like this for a long time\n23:34 Comment: understood.\n23:35 Comment: We're talking about that\n23:37 Comment: How deep is the composition?\n23:39 Comment: And how difficult Oleg’s task is.\n23:41 Comment: In this regard, choose\n23:43 Comment: those who will bring results right now.\n23:46 Comment: Again, this is a replacement.\n23:48 Comment: Who will Marchisi come in instead of?\n23:49 Comment: Let's see how he shows himself. He came out\n23:51 Comment: eighth. Not in depth. You promised.\n23:54 Comment: But for now this is postponed.\n23:56 Comment: Checking Marchisi for\n23:57 Comment: positions let's say\n23:59 Comment: Erzat Spirlo.\n24:5 Comment: Jackini.\n24:7 Comment: Mark Hamsik has the ball.\n24:9 Comment: Diawara.\n24:11 Comment: Jackini.\n24:13 Comment: Pass to the right flank. Good.\n24:15 Comment: No. A little late\n24:17 Comment: Susay.\n24:19 Comment: Despite the fact that Juventus\n24:20 Comment: there is no stability.\n24:23 Comment: Basically at the beginning of this season\n24:25 Comment: reasons for\n24:26 Comment: super experiments.\n24:29 Comment: By and large, no. Of course they are always there.\n24:31 Comment: Because the top club must live\n24:33 Comment: in development. Must always\n24:35 Comment: take steps forward. But unlike\n24:37 Comment: Naples, for example, did not have a single player\n24:39 Comment: all matches without substitutions.\n24:41 Comment: Yes it's true. The same Gene Luigi was in football.\n24:45 Comment: Bratar missed the match from the last round.\n24:47 Comment: They just gave him a break. A small match against\n24:50 Comment: Sandori played as a reserve goalkeeper for the Brazilian\n24:53 Comment: Net. Higuain with the ball. Well now maybe\n24:55 Comment: Maybe something will work out for Higuain. Nice thin\n24:56 Comment: pass to Hidyra. Higuain. Hit.\n24:59 Comment: Goal by Gonzalo Higuain. What's happened? What is happening?\n25:4 Comment: He doesn't celebrate. He doesn't celebrate. He is still\n25:7 Comment: loves Naples.\n25:9 Comment: Although Naples no longer celebrates. He doesn't celebrate. He still loves Naples.\n25:9 Comment: Although Naples no longer loves him.\n25:12 Comment: Unrequited love Alexander. This also happens in football.\n25:15 Comment: Gonzalo Higuain scores. And it proves that\n25:20 Comment: truly a top forward.\n25:23 Comment: Gonzalo. Listen. Listen to his name\n25:28 Comment: welcomes Juventus Stadium. Well, of course\n25:29 Comment: Higuain's reaction is a different story.\n25:31 Comment: And again Fauzi Ghulam got into Dibal's trouble.\n25:35 Comment: Juventus had a nervous game.\n25:39 Comment: Game at Juventus. Game at Juventus.\n25:39 Comment: Sami Khedira fights for the ball.\n25:42 Comment: Disturbs the defender. For the first time, look for the first time\n25:46 Comment: Kuleibali was unable to play the ball. And the feeling that Gulyam interfered with him.\n25:51 Comment: He would, he would have dealt with Khedira. But Ghulyam took and knocked the ball in front of him.\n25:56 Comment: It was not for nothing that they showed a close-up of the Algerian defender of Naples.\n26:0 Comment: Another mistake of his. Second assist of the match by the same opposing defender.\n26:5 Comment: Sasha, but I still defended Ghulyam. He said that this is what Higuain is all about.\n26:9 Comment: He started this attack. He came up with it. The pass was good.\n26:12 Comment: He made a pass with his right foot. Throw it into the penalty area. There was a mistake.\n26:16 Comment: Then Higuain, finishing, did not play simply brilliantly.\n26:19 Comment: Naples response was immediate, just like after the first goal.\n26:22 Comment: This is the kind of high-scoring football we see.\n26:25 Comment: And the fact that Juventus can defeat Sandoria, as in the previous round.\n26:29 Comment: This is a completely different type of game.\n26:33 Comment: We understand perfectly well that the opponent there was pliable.\n26:37 Comment: This is where Napoli takes offense.\n26:39 Comment: One of the best matches in recent memory.\n26:41 Comment: And it's far from over. The shot is dangerous.\n26:44 Comment: Panucci knocks the ball out. The Turin team play a pass with their own penalty kick.\n26:47 Comment: Licksteiner for free space.\n26:49 Comment: Manjo Keech gets the ball. Kuribali will be thrown from behind the sideline.\n26:56 Comment: Kirikesh.\n26:59 Comment: Diawarau knocks to the ball. On the left there is partner Mare Hamshek.\n27:2 Comment: Next on Jackerin.\n27:7 Comment: Jekerine is higher in the position of NS.\n27:9 Comment: Jackerina, of course, will not distribute such programs.\n27:11 Comment: But this is not required of him.\n27:14 Comment: Perhaps, after the departure of the National Assembly, this, as we say, conductor’s baton will not pass to Hamshek.\n27:19 Comment: He will have the ball under his feet more often when he needs to pass.\n27:23 Comment: To be honest, the replacement hasn't worked yet.\n27:25 Comment: Dzhekerina is clearly inferior in ingenuity and even mobility somewhere to NS.\n27:30 Comment: This is amazing in terms of mobility.\n27:33 Comment: And it was clear from the very beginning about ingenuity.\n27:35 Comment: Mertens goes wide and hits the corner.\n27:37 Comment: Oh, how dangerous it turned out.\n27:39 Comment: A very, very dangerous shot from Daris Mertens.\n27:42 Comment: I don’t know whether Buffon was in control of the situation in this episode.\n27:46 Comment: Let's see now. Hit...\n27:48 Comment: Rather yes than no.\n27:50 Comment: But if he had gotten into the top nine, and that was also possible, Buffon could have had difficulties.\n27:57 Comment: Gonzalo Higuain.\n27:58 Comment: But we talked about Naples’ statistics, about who is the best passer in the current championship today.\n28:6 Comment: The eleventh round, let us remind you, is underway.\n28:8 Comment: Incini has four assists.\n28:10 Comment: And the seventh goal scored today was scored by Jose Callejon.\n28:16 Comment: Juventus' situation is as follows.\n28:19 Comment: Gonzalo Higuain also scored the seventh goal.\n28:22 Comment: Caught up with Kaliekhon.\n28:24 Comment: But he made a pass to him again at Sigul.\n28:29 Comment: So no one will add anything here.\n28:32 Comment: Juventus is preparing another replacement.\n28:34 Comment: Stefano Sturaro.\n28:35 Comment: At the edge of the field.\n28:36 Comment: Another central midfielder.\n28:38 Comment: Well, notice how Juventus’ game changed when Marchisio left.\n28:42 Comment: Still, he added some balance to Juventus.\n28:47 Comment: Barzalia.\n28:49 Comment: Sturaro, by the way, was injured at the beginning of the season.\n28:51 Comment: Then he sat in reserve.\n28:53 Comment: And in the last rounds he began to go out regularly.\n28:56 Comment: Let it be for 10, let it be 15 minutes.\n28:58 Comment: But for such a grueling season as they imagined.\n29:4 Comment: And which the people of Turin dream about.\n29:6 Comment: I think they want to play football until May.\n29:9 Comment: Even until June.\n29:10 Comment: Until June.\n29:11 Comment: Yes, June 3rd.\n29:12 Comment: So, for a season like this, a player with incredible experience will be very, very useful.\n29:20 Comment: Quadran.\n29:21 Comment: Pass to Mario Majukic.\n29:23 Comment: Angular.\n29:25 Comment: Cross and corner kick.\n29:26 Comment: Here he is Mario Majukic.\n29:31 Comment: I'm curious who will replace Sturaro.\n29:32 Comment: And this is Peter Zelinsky.\n29:35 Comment: Another talent from Napoli.\n29:37 Comment: Polish midfielder.\n29:38 Comment: Who spent the last two years in Empoli.\n29:43 Comment: And it has proven itself well.\n29:45 Comment: As one of the most interesting young players.\n29:48 Comment: At the same time, of course, I followed him through my channels.\n29:52 Comment: On Sari Street.\n29:54 Comment: Definitely, definitely.\n29:55 Comment: And by the way, he was close to moving to Liverpool in the summer, not to Napoli.\n29:59 Comment: But Napoli was eventually convinced.\n30:0 Comment: And by the way, he was close to moving to Liverpool in the summer, not to Napoli.\n30:1 Comment: Both Empoli and the footballer were able to move to the south of Italy.\n30:5 Comment: Cuandredo has a bad serve.\n30:7 Comment: Devara kicked the ball out of the side.\n30:8 Comment: But he remains in the Neapolitans' half of the field.\n30:12 Comment: We saw how they reacted a second time to the missed goal.\n30:16 Comment: But Juventus has now slowed down this pace.\n30:18 Comment: After the score was 2-1, that freedom that Napoli had was clearly not there in these few minutes.\n30:25 Comment: Juventus, and then number 11, Hernanes, came out.\n30:27 Comment: Yes, Hernanes.\n30:28 Comment: Certainly.\n30:29 Comment: 11 number.\n30:30 Comment: Hernanes.\n30:31 Comment: This is, in my opinion...\n30:32 Comment: Why, of course?\n30:34 Comment: No, no, I agree that at this moment, when leaving Turan, one of the central midfielders needs to be changed for volume.\n30:45 Comment: Khedir is still above class.\n30:47 Comment: Of course, definitely.\n30:48 Comment: But it’s not without reason that Hernanes is now applauded at Juventus Stadium.\n30:53 Comment: He played his 75 minutes very well.\n30:56 Comment: And the second substitution this time for Napoli.\n30:59 Comment: Alan Pole leaves.\n31:0 Comment: This is a pure defensive midfielder, although he can play from free kick to free kick.\n31:4 Comment: But a pronounced attacking midfielder, Petr Zelensky, comes out.\n31:8 Comment: Well, by the way, he played in the starting lineup in the match with Empoli in the previous round.\n31:12 Comment: And there were changes.\n31:14 Comment: I emphasize once again that Napoli is not so monotonous this season.\n31:18 Comment: I won’t even say stable, because stability is the result.\n31:22 Comment: And they played with the same lineup all season.\n31:25 Comment: It was good, but, in my opinion, we were a little tired of each other.\n31:30 Comment: And now Sari has a choice, she has a choice.\n31:34 Comment: Marchisio has now dropped into Hernanes' place.\n31:37 Comment: Claudio Marchisio is playing in front of the defenders.\n31:40 Comment: Quadrado, Elik Steiner, Marchisio.\n31:43 Comment: Claudio Marchisio with the ball again.\n31:45 Comment: And the transfer is good to the left flank to Alex Sandro.\n31:50 Comment: And then two attackers nearby begin to open up.\n31:53 Comment: One of them, Marchisio has both a long pass and a cross.\n31:58 Comment: But I tried to win.\n31:59 Comment: But I tried to play like this.\n32:1 Comment: Not very convincing.\n32:4 Comment: Kaliejon back.\n32:6 Comment: And in the end, Hysaj came out of defense.\n32:11 Comment: Again the Albanian gets the ball.\n32:13 Comment: Vlad Kirikesh.\n32:14 Comment: Transfer to the flank by Fuzi Gulyava.\n32:17 Comment: And the Algerian needs to move forward.\n32:18 Comment: Mandzukic presents him and drops him onto the lawn.\n32:23 Comment: Kaliejon on the lawn.\n32:27 Comment: Well, maybe.\n32:29 Comment: You will need medical attention.\n32:31 Comment: As did Gulyava, who also became a victim in the episode with Mario Mandzukic.\n32:39 Comment: Let's look at the goal again.\n32:41 Comment: Indeed, Higuain turned out to be such a parodist.\n32:46 Comment: How he drove the ball with his left foot into the far corner.\n32:49 Comment: Yes, everything is fine with the technology.\n32:51 Comment: But, of course, it's a gift.\n32:53 Comment: Second gift in half an hour from Fuzi Gulyava.\n32:57 Comment: This is a bit much.\n32:59 Comment: It is difficult for Napoleon to beat Juventus.\n33:1 Comment: Today this has almost been achieved.\n33:3 Comment: By the game, by the structure, by the mood, by the passion.\n33:7 Comment: And even in terms of possession of the ball in the territory.\n33:9 Comment: But mistakes, mistakes.\n33:11 Comment: The Neapolitans help Juve lead.\n33:17 Comment: And we are still shown Marchisio.\n33:21 Comment: Apparently, the director is tied to the latest success.\n33:25 Comment: In this match of Juventus with the release of Claudio Marchisio.\n33:29 Comment: As it appears.\n33:31 Comment: Well, it’s obvious that after his injury they are trying to take care of Marchisio a little.\n33:37 Comment: Keep an eye on what doesn't work out.\n33:39 Comment: Moreover, especially as you understand, he is a real Juventinion.\n33:43 Comment: Brought up at the Juventus Academy.\n33:45 Comment: He was born in Turin.\n33:47 Comment: He has been a Juve fan since his early years.\n33:49 Comment: Therefore, of course, as a symbol of Juventus.\n33:51 Comment: Of course, very important for the team.\n33:53 Comment: And for the club as a whole.\n33:55 Comment: For Juventus, for them this is real.\n33:57 Comment: And now people have gotten into the habit.\n33:59 Comment: They say that they have been on the team since childhood.\n34:1 Comment: About which six months ago they still knew nothing.\n34:3 Comment: Square.\n34:9 Comment: Goes back to play.\n34:11 Comment: On Oligsteiner.\n34:13 Comment: Marchisio.\n34:15 Comment: The touch is very healthy.\n34:17 Comment: And the speed of the day is enough.\n34:19 Comment: Certainly.\n34:21 Comment: Hidiro was almost an additional striker there.\n34:23 Comment: Pippi Reina dribbles past her opponent.\n34:25 Comment: But otherwise you won’t end up in a completely different game.\n34:27 Comment: On the attack.\n34:29 Comment: Where Napoleon spent almost the entire match.\n34:31 Comment: And where everything is not over for him yet.\n34:33 Comment: Diawara.\n34:35 Comment: Zelensky.\n34:37 Comment: Played by Mark Hamsik.\n34:39 Comment: Diawara is back with the ball.\n34:41 Comment: One more serve.\n34:43 Comment: And they get a little nervous after these diagonals.\n34:45 Comment: From the depth.\n34:47 Comment: These are the Neapolitans who are the owners.\n34:49 Comment: Yes, Alexandra could have left the ball on the accounting floor.\n34:51 Comment: I didn't do this.\n34:53 Comment: Now forward.\n34:55 Comment: The ball was taken too harshly.\n34:57 Comment: And Juve's attack.\n34:59 Comment: Quadrado. Diawara is in front of him.\n35:1 Comment: Quadrado plays to the left for Goncal Higuain.\n35:3 Comment: Where Higuaina receives the ball.\n35:5 Comment: Really curious.\n35:7 Comment: Almost the entire match he was ready to play from deep.\n35:9 Comment: Moreover.\n35:11 Comment: He scored his goal thanks to a rush from the second line of attack.\n35:13 Comment: This is also important.\n35:15 Comment: This is exactly how Higuain is ready to play at Juventus.\n35:17 Comment: He is also growing.\n35:19 Comment: He is also developing.\n35:21 Comment: Let's play.\n35:23 Comment: Like a master.\n35:27 Comment: Gulyam misses the ball.\n35:31 Comment: Napoleon needs to get started.\n35:33 Comment: It is clear that a lot of effort has already been spent in this meeting.\n35:35 Comment: But Napoleon needs\n35:37 Comment: a new assault on the Juventus gates.\n35:39 Comment: Well, this is an offensive feeling.\n35:41 Comment: What are you going to do?\n35:43 Comment: But they played so well.\n35:45 Comment: And two mistakes, two goals.\n35:47 Comment: It certainly torments the Neapolitans.\n35:49 Comment: But they are moving forward.\n35:51 Comment: Kalikhon throws into the penalty area.\n35:53 Comment: In the center of the field.\n35:55 Comment: The owners have a loss here.\n35:57 Comment: Higuain's loss.\n35:59 Comment: Marchisio helped.\n36:1 Comment: He returned the ball to the Argentine.\n36:3 Comment: And Gonzalo Hod dials.\n36:5 Comment: Two partners in front still support on the right.\n36:7 Comment: Here he is.\n36:9 Comment: Good pass from Higuain.\n36:11 Comment: Higuain serves.\n36:13 Comment: Just like Higuain.\n36:15 Comment: This would be a draw between two football players.\n36:17 Comment: A wall of sorts.\n36:19 Comment: Too long.\n36:21 Comment: But in my opinion, Gonzalo Higuain threw the ball away.\n36:23 Comment: At the pace of one of the partners.\n36:25 Comment: Two people opened up at once.\n36:27 Comment: Well, one more replacement.\n36:29 Comment: Marek Hamsik leaves.\n36:31 Comment: Omar El Kadoury.\n36:33 Comment: He's about to appear on the field.\n36:35 Comment: Marek Hamsik goes on vacation.\n36:37 Comment: And who will pass?\n36:39 Comment: Kadoorie, Jocherini?\n36:41 Comment: Just Kel Kaduri.\n36:43 Comment: He will take this position.\n36:45 Comment: Well, there is Peter Zelinsky.\n36:47 Comment: He is a player who can come up with attacks.\n36:49 Comment: Can give such a last pass.\n36:51 Comment: The captain's summons is being inquired.\n36:53 Comment: Pepe Reine.\n36:55 Comment: But this is the last change.\n36:57 Comment: Approximately 10 minutes on the field.\n36:59 Comment: Until the final whistle.\n37:1 Comment: The central match, which no longer deceived\n37:3 Comment: our hopes.\n37:5 Comment: Like a performance.\n37:7 Comment: But the Neapolitans wanted more.\n37:9 Comment: And in my opinion they deserved more.\n37:11 Comment: Raine is wrong.\n37:13 Comment: And Ventus intercepted the ball.\n37:15 Comment: Sturaro.\n37:17 Comment: Alex Sandro.\n37:19 Comment: Brazil is turning around.\n37:21 Comment: Got hit in the legs.\n37:23 Comment: And in the end a free kick.\n37:29 Comment: The Turin people are shredding the game a little.\n37:31 Comment: Maybe even\n37:33 Comment: deliberately committed a foul.\n37:35 Comment: To have a free kick.\n37:37 Comment: For time to pass.\n37:39 Comment: And so that Napoleon does not return this to himself\n37:41 Comment: inner feeling\n37:43 Comment: enjoyment of the game.\n37:45 Comment: From playing on someone else's half of the field.\n37:47 Comment: Barzali.\n37:49 Comment: Bass on the right flank.\n37:51 Comment: Stefan Licksteiner.\n37:53 Comment: Square.\n37:55 Comment: Feed into the penalty area.\n37:57 Comment: And Vlad Kirikesh plays well here.\n37:59 Comment: Marchisio is the first to rebound again.\n38:1 Comment: Tricky bass.\n38:3 Comment: One touch further to the left.\n38:5 Comment: Alexandru will not catch this ball.\n38:7 Comment: Will throw.\n38:9 Comment: And the Neapolitans need to do this quickly.\n38:11 Comment: The intrigue is still alive and well.\n38:13 Comment: It’s hard, of course, to win back twice in a match.\n38:15 Comment: When such an opponent.\n38:17 Comment: Feeling in his right.\n38:19 Comment: But Napoli should have a chance.\n38:21 Comment: So far, Edira themselves are in possession of the ball.\n38:23 Comment: Banuchia.\n38:27 Comment: That’s also a question, Sash.

    "summary": "The highly anticipated match between Juventus and Napoli at the Juventus Stadium unfolded in a captivating and dramatic fashion, showcasing the intensity and skill synonymous with top-tier Italian football. Juventus emerged victorious with a 2-1 triumph over their resilient opponents, Napoli, in a game that saw both tactical depth and individual brilliance.\n\nFrom the outset, the tension was palpable. The Juventus Stadium, a fortress for the home team, was packed with ardent supporters creating a feverish atmosphere. Juventus, determined to maintain their dominance and extend their lead at the top of Serie A, faced a Napoli side eager to secure a historic victory in Turin.\n\nThe first half began with both teams cautiously feeling each other out, not willing to make early mistakes. Juventus started with a back three of Giorgio Chiellini, Leonardo Bonucci, and Andrea Barzagli, flanked by Alex Sandro and Stephan Lichtsteiner. In the midfield, Sami Khedira, Hernanes, and Miralem Pjanic worked to control the tempo and supply the forwards, Gonzalo Higuain and Mario Mandzukic, who spearheaded the attack.\n\nNapoli's formation was equally intriguing, with a defense consisting of Vlad Chiriches and Kalidou Koulibaly at the center, flanked by Elseid Hysaj and Faouzi Ghoulam. Amadou Diawara anchored the midfield alongside Allan and Marek Hamsik, while the petite yet dynamic trio of Dries Mertens, Lorenzo Insigne, and José Callejón aimed to unsettle Juventus' defense with their pace and creativity.\n\nThe early exchanges were marked by a tactical chess match. Both teams worked diligently to maintain possession, trying to find gaps in their opponent's defense. Juventus' defense had to be alert, and Lichtsteiner found himself caught offside while pushing forward. Napoli, showing admirable composure, enjoyed spells of controlled possession, with Hysaj and Ghoulam making probing runs down the flanks.\n\nBuffon, a beacon of calm at the heart of the Juventus defense, was called into action as Lorenzo Insigne, working tirelessly as an unexpected center forward, tested the veteran goalkeeper on a couple of occasions. Insigne demonstrated his versatility and vision, controlling the ball adeptly and linking up play with Mertens and Callejón.\n\nJuventus, despite regularly pushing forward, found it difficult to break down Napoli's disciplined defense. Chiellini, solid as ever, marshaled the Juventus backline, ensuring that Napoli's attacks didn't overwhelm them. The midfield battle was intense, with Diawara impressing for Napoli with his distribution and defensive work.\n\nA pivotal moment in the first half arose when Lichtsteiner, showcasing his offensive intent, surged down the right flank. His cross into the box looked promising, but Higuain, under pressure from Koulibaly, couldn't convert the opportunity. On the other side, Mertens, Callejón, and Insigne kept Juventus' defense on its toes with quick interchanges and darting runs.\n\nAs the first half wore on, Juventus began to assert more influence. Pjanic and Alex Sandro exhibited excellent ball control, creating a few goal-scoring opportunities. Higuain, almost unrecognizable from his prolific self, struggled to find space, shadowed closely by Koulibaly and Chiriches.\n\nAt the 31st minute, Juventus had their best chance when Higuain was released by a splendid ball from Khedira. But, under pressure from Chiriches, Higuain’s shot was blocked, and Pepe Reina collected the rebound efficiently. Napoli responded with a swift counter-attack, with Hamsik and Insigne combining well, but the final touch eluded them.\n\nThe latter part of the first half saw more end-to-end action. Juventus pressed forward, with Mandzukic's physical presence causing problems for Napoli's defense. Lichtsteiner's crosses from the right looked threatening, but the final delivery lacked precision. On the other hand, Mertens and Callejón remained a constant threat, their understanding apparent as they exchanged quick passes and made dangerous runs behind Juventus' defense.\n\nThe second half began with renewed vigor from Juventus, who needed to impose their authority on the game. Cuadrado was introduced to add width and pace, altering Juventus' formation to a back four. This tactical switch allowed Juventus to exert pressure from the flanks, with Cuadrado and Lichtsteiner doubling on the right.\n\nJuventus' persistence paid off in the 48th minute when a seemingly routine clearance from Napoli's defense went awry. Bonucci capitalized on Ghoulam’s mistake, showing remarkable composure and technical ability to fire a left-footed shot past Reina, giving Juventus the lead. The Juventus Stadium erupted in celebration, and the goal seemed to galvanize the home side.\n\nNapoli, however, showed tremendous character and resilience by responding almost immediately. Barely ten minutes later, Insigne and Callejón combined brilliantly, with Insigne finding Callejón behind Juventus' defenders with a perfectly weighted pass. Callejón, displaying his sniper-like precision, drove a low shot into the net, bringing Napoli level and silencing the home crowd momentarily.\n\nThe game intensified, with both sides pushing for the win. The tactical battle continued to unfold, with Juventus maintaining a slight edge in possession but Napoli looking dangerous on the break. Marchisio came on to replace Pjanic, adding stability to Juventus' midfield and helping them regain control.\n\nIn the 70th minute, Juventus struck again. Higuain, lurking in the box, capitalized on another defensive mistake by Ghoulam, who failed to clear the ball properly. Higuain's finish was clinical, a poignant moment as he chose not to celebrate out of respect for his former club. The goal further ignited the contest, as Napoli desperately sought an equalizer.\n\nAs the clock ticked down, both teams demonstrated immense determination. Buffon made crucial saves, and Bonucci and Barzagli were resolute at the heart of Juventus' defense. Napoli threw caution to the wind, bringing on Jorginho and Zelinski to add creativity and energy to their attacks.\n\nDespite their relentless pursuit, Napoli could not find a way past Buffon and the Juventus defense. The final whistle confirmed Juventus' hard-fought 2-1 victory, a testament to their tactical nous and the sheer quality in their squad.\n\nThe match showcased the competitive spirit of Serie A and the tactical acumen of both managers. Juventus, led by Allegri's astute decisions, demonstrated why they remain the team to beat in the league. Napoli, though valiant in defeat, left Turin with their heads held high, knowing they had pushed the reigning champions to their limits.\n\nFor Juventus, this victory solidified their position at the top of the Serie A table, while Napoli’s performance underscored their credentials as serious contenders. The encounter was a thrilling advertisement for Italian football, filled with tactical battles, individual brilliance, and dramatic moments that will linger in the memories of those who witnessed it."
