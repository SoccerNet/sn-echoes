such a good transfer\n4:40 Comment: performed on Parades.\n4:42 Comment: He himself dispersed the attack and made a through ball.\n4:46 Comment: Not even in the cut, in principle in the corridor, which is so\n4:50 Comment: Edin Dzeko left a trail of his run.\n4:54 Comment: Edin Dzeko takes the ball and hits the near corner.\n4:59 Comment: In principle, everything was done well.\n5:1 Comment:

Comment: Roma today operates according to the scheme.\n5:53 Comment: Well, basically, with the release of Francesco Totti.\n5:57 Comment: It's probably something resembling 4-2-3-1.\n6:2 Comment: Probably, Totti is still in the position of a playmaker, a dispatcher.\n6:8 Comment: Your choice.\n6:12 Comment: Well, another attack is accelerating.\n6:14 Comment: Strotman.\n6:16 Comment: Receives the postback.\n6:18 Comment: Once again, Strotman is not very accurate.\n6:21 Comment: So it was impossible to understand.\n6:21 Comment: Either Totti or El Sharover.\n6:23 Comment: He makes the transfer.\n6:24 Comment: Totti sent El Sharovy on such a short run.\n6:27 Comment: Inaccurate transmission.\n6:29 Comment: Totti again.\n6:30 Comment: Totti in the cut.\n6:32 Comment: Francesco makes a wonderful pass.\n6:34 Comment: On the move to Perez, who is very, very strong in distance speed.\n6:42 Comment: Scary.\n6:44 Comment: On the left side of Roma, as I already said, Perez is acting.\n6:48 Comment: Bruno Perez, team newcomer.\n6:49 Comment: The center of defense is Facio and Manula.\n6:52 Comment: Fazio is also a player.\n6:53 Comment: New to the Romans.\n6:54 Comment:

defensive midfielders.\n7:10 Comment: Central Habek.\n7:11 Comment: In such a match, I think they will still spend much more time on the away field.\n7:16 Comment: This is Strotman and Paredes.\n7:20 Comment: Francesco Totti.\n7:22 Comment: Also in the middle.\n7:23 Comment: Although Totti is where the ball is.\n7:26 Comment: Let's be honest.\n7:27 Comment: Three forwards.\n7:28 Comment: On the left is Sharawi, on the right is Salah, Edin Dzhekov.\n7:31 Comment: Center drop-down.\n7:33 Comment: A very attacking scheme.\n7:35 Comment: Attacking variation from Lucian Spalletti.\n7:37 Comment: Could it have been different when the Outsider came to visit.\n7:40 Comment: The last team in the championship.\n7:43 Comment: And in general we need to rehabilitate ourselves for reflecting on Farens.\n7:46 Comment: The shot doesn't work.\n7:48 Comment: By Rafael Palladino.\n7:51 Comment: What is this?\n7:51 Comment: I'm sorry.\n7:52 Comment: I forgot it.\n7:53 Comment: Designate when listing the starting lineup players.\n7:57 Comment: Torres on El Sharawi.\n8:0 Comment: He dances around the ball and gives the goal to Kiper in the process.\n8:4 Comment: Like this.\n8:6 Comment: Croton scheme.\n8:9 Comment: Well, let's take a look.\n8:10 Comment: Let's watch.\n8:11 Comment: David Nikola tried different options.\n8:15 Comment: Still at training camp.\n8:18 Comment: Analysts in Italy speculated about this.\n8:20 Comment: Will he work with the scheme that allowed Cruton to exit Serie B?\n8:28 Comment: True, under the guidance of another coach.\n8:31 Comment: Ivan Yurich.\n8:33 Comment: Crutona then played in a 3-4-3 formation.\n8:36 Comment: Well, essentially, of course, with five defenders.\n8:39 Comment: And not with three.\n8:40 Comment: Perez.\n8:41 Comment: Perez accelerates.\n8:43 Comment: This is probably the most original combination.\n8:50 Comment: The last week in world football.\n8:52 Comment: Knock the ball into your partner's jaw.\n8:55 Comment: And still have time to process it somehow.\n8:57 Comment: And that’s not what footballer Crouton can do.\n8:59 Comment: So, according to the 3-4-3 scheme.\n9:1 Comment: Krutona was still active in Serie B.\n9:3 Comment: But it seems like we see a team with four defenders.\n9:7 Comment: Let's take a look along the way.\n9:9 Comment: This match.\n9:11 Comment: Attention.\n9:12 Comment: Paladin.\n9:13 Comment: Here it is.\n9:19 Comment: Paladin.\n9:20 Comment: His first blow is covered.\n9:22 Comment: Florenzo also copes with the second attack.\n9:27 Comment: Fasio.\n9:28 Comment: The best one is on the second floor.\n9:30 Comment: And the rebound belongs to Roma.\n9:31 Comment: You can go on the attack.\n9:32 Comment: If only the ball had gotten to Torti right away.\n9:35 Comment: Crouton's players are a little bolder.\n9:40 Comment: By the way, we have 10 minutes behind us.\n9:42 Comment: Like this.\n9:43 Comment: It would seem that the starting whistle was about to blow.\n9:46 Comment: But we have already seen the barbell.\n9:48 Comment: And other scoring chances.\n9:49 Comment: And Paladin continues to be active on the left edge as an attacker.\n9:53 Comment: And it was a scoring chance, if I may.\n9:56 Comment: I hit him in the body with his kidney; in my opinion, Manulas repelled this blow.\n10:5 Comment: And I must say that the position was lethal.\n10:8 Comment: Killer.\n10:9 Comment: The blow is powerful.\n10:10 Comment: Closer.\n10:11 Comment: Let's see who hit it.\n10:13 Comment: But Manulas, in fact, covers this blow at the last moment with a tackle.\n10:18 Comment: But we know that different coaches in modern football perceive the tackle as a means of defense differently.\n10:26 Comment: Someone is only glad if he has either an attacker or a defender making tackles.\n10:32 Comment: And he rips off the very place where they are sitting.\n10:35 Comment: But some perceive the tackle as an emergency measure.\n10:40 Comment: As an opportunity to correct your own positional miscalculation.\n10:46 Comment: Well, there is a feeling that the Italian directors will never allow us to enjoy this repeat.\n10:54 Comment: Brutal repetition.\n10:56 Comment: Well, we see that Manulas seems to have already recovered.\n10:59 Comment: But here the violation of the rules is obvious.\n11:2 Comment: Michael Totti.\n11:4 Comment: You see that the fight for Michael Totti begins already during the match.\n11:10 Comment: It’s basically no secret that every time after every match.\n11:15 Comment: There's Totti.\n11:16 Comment: Michael can even give out two by three.\n11:18 Comment: There are a lot of requests.\n11:20 Comment: Everyone is seizing the moment while this incredible legend Totti lives on.\n11:27 Comment: And we can observe it.\n11:29 Comment: Salah.\n11:31 Comment: I waited for a run from my partner.\n11:34 Comment: But the pass was unsuccessful.\n11:35 Comment: Totti.\n11:36 Comment: Hit.\n11:37 Comment: In my opinion, even two rebounds.\n11:38 Comment: And another corner.\n11:40 Comment: Very cheerful football performed by the Romans.\n11:43 Comment: We probably didn’t expect anything else.\n11:45 Comment: Although I remember the game.\n11:46 Comment: In my case, I had the opportunity to comment on it.\n11:48 Comment: First round against Udinese.\n11:50 Comment: Home win with a score of 4-0.\n11:52 Comment: And there.\n11:54 Comment: The Romans harnessed it there for a very long time.\n11:57 Comment: By the way, didn’t the ball get away from Jack?\n12:0 Comment: That is the question.\n12:1 Comment: Well, it’s good that this corner did not end in anything dangerous for Croton.\n12:5 Comment: Otherwise, of course, out of the blue, the referee would have given it.\n12:9 Comment: This is the basis for controversy.\n12:11 Comment: In Italian editions.\n12:15 Comment: However, Roma has never been this team.\n12:17 Comment: Which, according to the press, is being pulled by the referee.\n12:20 Comment: 13 minutes.\n12:22 Comment: Roma Crotone.\n12:23 Comment: Fifth round of the Italian Championship.\n12:25 Comment: The match takes place on Wednesday.\n12:28 Comment: Like the vast majority of other games.\n12:31 Comment: Fifth jornat.\n12:32 Comment: What is a tour called in Italy?\n12:35 Comment: Well, basically, to speed up.\n12:40 Comment: Why not.\n12:41 Comment: Attendance is not the worst.\n12:43 Comment: But that's another matter.\n12:45 Comment: That the tour was very bright.\n12:47 Comment: In past exits, follow the signs.\n12:49 Comment: And how after that.\n12:51 Comment: The fans are feeling well.\n12:53 Comment: Maybe a lot of emotions were released.\n12:55 Comment: Are they ready to show good attendance on weekdays?\n12:58 Comment: But these are Italian problems.\n13:0 Comment: Not ours.\n13:3 Comment: Paradosa too.\n13:5 Comment: They ask for a jersey during game time.\n13:10 Comment: Parados is a very interesting character.\n13:13 Comment: Interesting yes.\n13:15 Comment: What will be his future games?\n13:17 Comment: How do you think.\n13:19 Comment: Roma fans in particular.\n13:21 Comment: Will it pull or not?\n13:23 Comment: So far this season he has.\n13:25 Comment: But he is only starting his second game in the starting lineup.\n13:27 Comment: I actually played against Genez.\n13:29 Comment: From the first minutes against Kaleri.\n13:31 Comment: It only came out at the end.\n13:33 Comment: Then there are two matches in reserve.\n13:35 Comment: Against Sampa and Ferentina.\n13:37 Comment: Here with Krutona again at the base.\n13:39 Comment: Talent.\n13:41 Comment: Great talent.\n13:43 Comment: Which even Zenit took a closer look at.\n13:45 Comment: And it seemed like he was ready to pay the money.\n13:47 Comment: Again we see exclusively through the maiden's flank.\n13:49 Comment: Attacks Crouton.\n13:51 Comment: But only Jack picks up the ball.\n13:53 Comment: On his long Bosnian stride.\n13:55 Comment: Well, by the way, the pasta definitely turned out in the end.\n13:58 Comment: Let's continue playing.\n14:0 Comment: El Sharawi makes a turn.\n14:2 Comment: With these elegant and endless steps.\n14:6 Comment: I don’t think that this will count as Finn, of course.\n14:10 Comment: Totti.\n14:12 Comment: Diagonal.\n14:13 Comment: Right on Florence.\n14:15 Comment: But there was a violation of the rules.\n14:17 Comment: Yes.\n14:18 Comment: Blows the whistle.\n14:21 Comment: Arbitrator Russo.\n14:27 Comment: Well, I wouldn’t say what Russian refereeing is.\n14:30 Comment: Only for now.\n14:32 Comment: I think you noticed that.\n14:35 Comment: It seems to me that the Russian referee is still under influence.\n14:38 Comment: These are the current trends.\n14:40 Comment: And influenced by what they saw.\n14:42 Comment: During the European Championship.\n14:43 Comment: Tries to blow whistles less often.\n14:45 Comment: And don't split the game.\n14:46 Comment: Don't divide it into these endless standards.\n14:48 Comment: Cuts and stuff.\n14:50 Comment: This is of course in favor of dynamics.\n14:53 Comment: This is an attempt to make football spectacular.\n14:55 Comment: But that's not what this is about.\n14:56 Comment: Francesco Totti.\n14:58 Comment: Near the ball.\n15:0 Comment: Well, the emperor in such a situation can invent anything.\n15:3 Comment: Until the blow.\n15:4 Comment: It's a bit far though.\n15:7 Comment: Let's see.\n15:9 Comment: Just like that, line up.\n15:10 Comment: Yes.\n15:11 Comment: Croton players settled down.\n15:13 Comment: This is defense.\n15:15 Comment: Not personal.\n15:18 Comment: Zone.\n15:20 Comment: Let's see how they run out.\n15:22 Comment: The referee is not too confident.\n15:25 Comment: Goalkeeper, I beg your pardon, played.\n15:27 Comment: El Sharawiya.\n15:29 Comment: Sorry quickly.\n15:31 Comment: Roll out the ball like this with a fan.\n15:32 Comment: And Perez.\n15:33 Comment: That's all for now.\n15:35 Comment: He can't be a player.\n15:37 Comment: Let's burn it.\n15:38 Comment: This is the ultimate attack.\n15:40 Comment: By the way, on Perez.\n15:41 Comment: It ends with Perez again.\n15:43 Comment: Perez starts dribbling.\n15:45 Comment: I saved the ball.\n15:47 Comment: Don't understand how.\n15:48 Comment: It seemed like two opponents were already putting pressure on him.\n15:50 Comment: Yes he is good.\n15:52 Comment: He's fast.\n15:53 Comment: He's pumping it up.\n15:55 Comment: But he still makes a lot of unnecessary touches.\n15:58 Comment: It seems to me.\n15:59 Comment: Roma Spalletti is still a game combinatorics.\n16:3 Comment: Accept this, give it back.\n16:7 Comment: Something like that.\n16:9 Comment: Ptotheus.\n16:10 Comment: Serve to the near post.\n16:12 Comment: And again the goalkeeper makes a mistake.\n16:14 Comment: But not without the help of an opponent.\n16:16 Comment: There was a violation of the rules here.\n16:18 Comment: Well, there is a rare opportunity for the Croton football players to take a break.\n16:24 Comment: There is, of course, tension from the very first minutes.\n16:27 Comment: Fasio.\n16:28 Comment: Facio fell.\n16:29 Comment: But nothing surprising.\n16:30 Comment: He has gained fame a long time ago.\n16:33 Comment: Tough guy.\n16:36 Comment: If not rude.\n16:39 Comment: This.\n16:42 Comment: Well, and one more thing.\n16:45 Comment: And further.\n16:50 Comment: Well, if we continue the topic of Fazio and the rest of Roma’s defenders.\n16:54 Comment: There are problems here too.\n16:56 Comment: Roma has problems playing defensively.\n16:59 Comment: She misses a lot.\n17:1 Comment: And something needs to be done about this.\n17:7 Comment: But they bought defenders.\n17:9 Comment: Well, cool company.\n17:9 Comment: And Joao Jesus.\n17:17 Comment: Yes.\n17:18 Comment: Traumatized now.\n17:20 Comment: Generally.\n17:22 Comment: Certainly.\n17:23 Comment: There is a choice.\n17:24 Comment: On the one side.\n17:25 Comment: On the other hand.\n17:26 Comment: We need something like that.\n17:27 Comment: Still understand who will be the main one.\n17:28 Comment: But for this you need something players.\n17:29 Comment: Eventually they recovered.\n17:30 Comment: And so.\n17:37 Comment: Eventually they recovered.\n17:39 Comment: And it was possible to compare.\n17:42 Comment: Although.\n17:44 Comment: Roma's attack continues.\n17:46 Comment: Very long.\n17:48 Comment: Boring in places.\n17:49 Comment: But even here the football players are croutons.\n17:51 Comment: Slowly they have probably already adapted.\n17:53 Comment: Grouped up.\n17:55 Comment: And they try to put pressure at times.\n17:58 Comment: Manulas.\n18:0 Comment: Some kind of thing.\n18:1 Comment: Also on its way.\n18:3 Comment: Croutons.\n18:4 Comment: I met such an underground one.\n18:6 Comment: Chewed his leg.\n18:8 Comment: Well.\n18:9 Comment: Don't know.\n18:10 Comment: At first sight.\n18:11 Comment: According to the picture.\n18:12 Comment: Yes.\n18:13 Comment: Everything seems to be fine with the field.\n18:15 Comment: But let's not forget.\n18:16 Comment: That the load on him is double.\n18:17 Comment: Weekly.\n18:18 Comment: Even more.\n18:19 Comment: If we take into account the European Cups.\n18:21 Comment: Lazio is playing.\n18:22 Comment: Roma is playing.\n18:23 Comment: We are all waiting, of course.\n18:24 Comment: So to speak.\n18:25 Comment: All Serie A fans.\n18:26 Comment: Yes.\n18:27 Comment: So that new stadiums appear.\n18:28 Comment: Roma has a finished project.\n18:29 Comment: That's all.\n18:35 Comment: And it seems like that.\n18:37 Comment: Three years later.\n18:39 Comment: This new arena should appear.\n18:42 Comment: Facem.\n18:43 Comment: Strootman.\n18:44 Comment: Returns to Federico.\n18:46 Comment: Well, by the way, dual citizenship.\n18:48 Comment: The most Argentinian.\n18:50 Comment: But an Italian passport.\n18:51 Comment: It also has.\n18:52 Comment: Native of Buenos Aires.\n18:54 Comment: An interesting experiment.\n18:56 Comment: Subtitles.\n19:6 Comment: By the way, I always liked this combination\n19:7 Comment: two nicknames for Federico Fazio.\n19:10 Comment: El Flaco and La Tore.\n19:13 Comment: First Skinny.\n19:15 Comment: Second tower.\n19:16 Comment: Well, this happens.\n19:18 Comment: Well, to be honest, it seems to me that over time\n19:20 Comment: he got it all right, after all.\n19:22 Comment: And at some time I could even associate\n19:29 Comment: with this same miser.\n19:30 Comment: The fact is that Spartak claimed him.\n19:33 Comment: He essentially bought an exhibition in the forum\n19:35 Comment: We'll see\n19:39 Comment: Serious competitors\n19:41 Comment: Once again, yes, I will list these central defenders\n19:43 Comment: Joan Jerus, Thomas Vermaline\n19:45 Comment: Costas Manula, Federico Fazio\n19:48 Comment: And Antonio Rudiger, yes, I'm sorry\n19:49 Comment: Injured Rüdiger since the start of the season\n19:51 Comment: Roma can't help\n19:53 Comment: These are all very, very decent defenders\n19:55 Comment: Central defenders\n19:57 Comment: Croutons, by the way\n19:59 Comment: Attacks, attacks positionally\n20:1 Comment: Again through the left edge\n20:4 Comment: It's like it's smeared with honey\n20:7 Comment: And he was also involved in this attack\n20:10 Comment: Rafael Palladino\n20:11 Comment: I think you remember him\n20:14 Comment: In particular, based on performances for Parmo\n20:16 Comment: This is probably one of the most famous\n20:20 Comment: Players in Crouton's squad\n20:21 Comment: You understand, yes, if Palladino is here\n20:24 Comment: Almost a star\n20:25 Comment: What can we say about the rest of the cast?\n20:27 Comment: El Sharawi gets the timing wrong\n20:29 Comment: This counterattack\n20:31 Comment: And Politi, by the way, doesn’t even look at it\n20:34 Comment: How is he\n20:34 Comment: Counterattacks Crouton\n20:35 Comment: And instead he shoves El Sharawi\n20:42 Comment: Because he\n20:44 Comment: I fiddled with the ball there for a very long time\n20:46 Comment: And in my opinion what happened there\n20:48 Comment: shield, shield\n20:49 Comment: At first it seemed that Manu Lassa\n20:51 Comment: Butsa fell off her feet\n20:54 Comment: But it turned out that it was just a shield\n20:55 Comment: Dropped out\n20:56 Comment: But this is how they put pressure on Kruton\n20:59 Comment: What a central defender\n21:0 Comment: Even has the opportunity\n21:2 Comment: Stand up calmly\n21:4 Comment: Put the shield back\n21:6 Comment: Well, nowadays shields, yes, no way\n21:8 Comment: In ancient times\n21:9 Comment: Well, I don't know, you never know\n21:10 Comment: What doesn't he know?\n21:11 Comment: If before they were like this with Velcro\n21:14 Comment: Well, at least someone maybe\n21:16 Comment: And with graves, shields with Velcro\n21:18 Comment: They also use\n21:19 Comment: Now they are simply inserted under\n21:22 Comment: Tight leggings\n21:24 Comment: They hold up normally\n21:28 Comment: Well, after such a stormy start\n21:31 Comment: Roma has slowed down a little\n21:33 Comment: Although, I think this may even be a definite plan.\n21:39 Comment: Pull the opponent into your half of the field a little, and then organize something sharp again.\n21:44 Comment: Well, Bruno Perez continues to play with himself, but he still executed the serve.\n21:48 Comment: Not the worst, by the way.\n21:49 Comment: If Mohamed Salak had run all the way to the far post, there could have been a sharp chance.\n21:55 Comment: Standard position.\n21:57 Comment: In my opinion, this is the fourth corner in almost 22 minutes of the game.\n22:1 Comment: Another draw.\n22:2 Comment: Totti sends a through ball.\n22:6 Comment: What a subtle, yet smart pass Totti had.\n22:9 Comment: What a pleasure, what a thrill, when you have the opportunity...\n22:15 Comment: By the way, the big question was for Abside.\n22:18 Comment: There is an opportunity to watch Francesca from the first minutes.\n22:22 Comment: Although personally I am an absolute supporter of Spalletti.\n22:25 Comment: Here it is on your screens in this matter.\n22:27 Comment: It seems to me that he emerged from that very conflict with minimal losses.\n22:32 Comment: With Francesco, which was started immediately after his return.\n22:36 Comment: But you remember everything that happened there.\n22:39 Comment: An unflattering statement about Spalletti in an interview.\n22:45 Comment: Overall a tough interview from Totti.\n22:47 Comment: The conflict that is like this has even reached the level of the president.\n22:52 Comment: Well, in the end, in the end, Totti made it clear that Francesco now, at his current age and condition, is a function player.\n23:1 Comment: This is a player who...\n23:2 Comment: Capable of helping a team in 20-25 minutes, maybe less.\n23:6 Comment: And he does it.\n23:7 Comment: Both at the end of last season and this season.\n23:10 Comment: What is a goal from Samdori worth, even from the penalty spot?\n23:13 Comment: Then, by the way, Totti admitted that for the first time in a long time he felt nervous when taking the 11-meter kick.\n23:21 Comment: Because such a moment was truly a peak in tension.\n23:26 Comment: Okay, we will definitely discuss this topic in detail with Trotman at Totti.\n23:32 Comment: Trotman on Parades.\n23:34 Comment: For some reason he picks up the ball, but plays accurately.\n23:37 Comment: Manulas.\n23:38 Comment: Trotman.\n23:39 Comment: Trotman strokes the ball with his spikes.\n23:44 Comment: A dubious pleasure for the ball, but it turns out very similar to mini-football.\n23:49 Comment: Parades.\n23:51 Comment: And such a transfer with deception.\n23:55 Comment: False in the eyes of the performer, but almost accurate in execution.\n24:2 Comment: But still the ball did not reach his partner.\n24:5 Comment: So like this.\n24:6 Comment: Roma players combine and dream.\n24:8 Comment: But so far, so far, probably the most poignant moment was this blow from Dynajack’s barbell.\n24:15 Comment: And even then at an angle.\n24:17 Comment: The near corner, which the goalkeeper seemed to control.\n24:20 Comment: We need to invent something more interesting.\n24:24 Comment: After all, we have even more halfway through the first half.\n24:27 Comment: Protone feels good.\n24:32 Comment: At these speeds.\n24:33 Comment: By the way, I didn’t talk about how Nikola’s team is performing this season.\n24:40 Comment: In the opening round, the defeat from Bolonia was 0-1.\n24:43 Comment: Still offensive.\n24:44 Comment: Then homework from Genoa.\n24:47 Comment: Pass into the penalty area.\n24:48 Comment: By the way, two players in wolf skins immediately intended to handle the ball.\n24:56 Comment: Well, let me remind you that wolves are the nickname of Roma football players.\n24:59 Comment: And, by the way, the nickname of Crotona players is Sharks.\n25:2 Comment: This is our animalism.\n25:5 Comment: Peculiar wolves against sharks.\n25:8 Comment: Somehow I don’t even have enough imagination to imagine some kind of battle in real nature.\n25:13 Comment: Forenzi. Lumbago. And blow! Goal!\n25:18 Comment: Stefan El Sharawi.\n25:21 Comment: It connects from somewhere behind the edge of the screen.\n25:28 Comment: From somewhere in an unknown zone.\n25:31 Comment: Which was visible exclusively to Alexander Florenzi.\n25:35 Comment: Hit to touch. Double rebound.\n25:39 Comment: And by the way, I’m not even sure that it was El Sharawi who made the transfer to Florenzi.\n25:43 Comment: There, at the 11-meter mark, Totti opened up.\n25:47 Comment: But Stefan still scores the goal.\n25:51 Comment: The ball is important. A ball that registers at least on the scoreboard, yes, this is the overwhelming advantage of the Romans.\n25:58 Comment: Although in the last minutes there was an overwhelming advantage.\n26:1 Comment: But of course it wasn't.\n26:3 Comment: However, Stefan El Sharawi. Let's celebrate his goal once again.\n26:9 Comment: And, by the way, it’s also understandable during the promotion, yes.\n26:13 Comment: This is his first goal this season.\n26:15 Comment: There was no way he could score. Although Starkov appeared more often.\n26:19 Comment: In the composition, rather than vice versa.\n26:21 Comment: But there are still certain claims regarding Stefan’s form.\n26:24 Comment: After all, he has never played from the first to the last minute in the current championship.\n26:28 Comment: It was replaced from Udinese to 57th.\n26:31 Comment: With Kaleri during the break. Samdori is also on a break.\n26:34 Comment: In the end, I left Ferentina only for the last 20 minutes.\n26:37 Comment: And here he is from the first minutes on the field. And now he’s already scoring.\n26:41 Comment: Edin Jackman. Strikes with his left foot.\n26:43 Comment: El Sharawi asks for the ball. Although, it seems to me that the boss made the right decision.\n26:48 Comment: There's already a bit of a shortcut there. I think it would be redundant.\n26:52 Comment: Loopy's striking position. El Sharawi.\n26:58 Comment: Congratulations to him. Let me remind you that during last season he moved as a loan player from Monaco.\n27:8 Comment: And in fact, this summer he signed a full-fledged contract with Roma.\n27:13 Comment: And the revival of the pharaoh took place. Revival.\n27:17 Comment: Under the leadership of the head of the department. Strotman.\n27:22 Comment: Salaak. Transfer to the far post. Totti.\n27:27 Comment: It was very difficult to process.\n27:29 Comment: Well, maybe, of course, there was one...\n27:32 Comment: Maybe a more active player instead of Francesco.\n27:35 Comment: Then I would have caught up.\n27:37 Comment: But I think the Giver is primarily to blame here.\n27:44 Comment: Well, that’s how the Shark’s next defeat comes to pass.\n27:49 Comment: Once again, yes. In Bologna in the first round they lost 0-1 to Jen.\n27:54 Comment: In the second 1-3.\n27:56 Comment: Then there was a defeat from Empoli.\n27:58 Comment: In such a fairly equal game with a score of 1-2, there were chances to take a draw.\n28:2 Comment: But the newcomers still took a draw in the fourth round in the match against Palermo.\n28:7 Comment: 1-1 was played.\n28:9 Comment: The first points in the club's history in Serie A.\n28:13 Comment: Perhaps this is such an inspiring fact.\n28:16 Comment: Please note that Roma is not limited to...\n28:20 Comment: This is such a blow.\n28:22 Comment: Not limited to small and medium gears.\n28:25 Comment: Lots of passes into the penalty area.\n28:27 Comment: Moreover, there is a forward of such texture as Dzhekua.\n28:31 Comment: And in general there are a lot of passes inside the penalty area.\n28:35 Comment: This emphasizes the charge to attack Rome.\n28:45 Comment: A little more at Crutone.\n28:49 Comment: For example, this is the first time I’ve had the opportunity to commentate on a match this season.\n28:55 Comment: Crutone, who was probably the strongest newcomer.\n28:58 Comment: The team finished second in Serie B last season.\n29:3 Comment: They performed well.\n29:5 Comment: In the end, however, we missed the opportunity to win Serie B.\n29:8 Comment: Although there was a solid indicator, a gap.\n29:11 Comment: We scored 82 points in the VKG.\n29:14 Comment: They missed a few.\n29:16 Comment: On average less than a goal per match.\n29:18 Comment: They didn't score very many goals.\n29:20 Comment: Croutone is more about defense.\n29:22 Comment: Well, probably the most important thing you need to know is\n29:26 Comment: this is that Ivan Yurievich, let me emphasize again, left the team.\n29:31 Comment: The specialist who led the team from the city of the same name to this historical success.\n29:38 Comment: He probably felt that that was it, there was nothing more he could squeeze out.\n29:42 Comment: What a ceiling at Crutone.\n29:44 Comment: And he moved to Jena.\n29:46 Comment: There are, of course, more serious opportunities there.\n29:48 Comment: Serve to Jack!\n29:51 Comment: Jack jumped quite high from the lawn.\n29:54 Comment: Sometimes there is a moment when a player is tall, but does not jump very well.\n29:58 Comment: Everything is fine here.\n30:0 Comment: Strothman drops his opponent with his heel.\n30:3 Comment: And then Paredes covers.\n30:6 Comment: Football players of Crutone. Sharovy, Sharovy.\n30:10 Comment: He, in turn, was caught putting pressure on him.\n30:13 Comment: This is the battle of rebounds.\n30:15 Comment: And Manuelos was wrong in this situation.\n30:19 Comment: That's how Ivan Yuryevich.\n30:21 Comment: Left the team.\n30:23 Comment: By the way, this same Crutone, together with Jena, has already managed to beat in the second round.\n30:27 Comment: 3-1.\n30:29 Comment: The main problem is that there is not enough money.\n30:32 Comment: Crutone doesn't have enough money.\n30:34 Comment: Therefore, they could not acquire anyone worthwhile.\n30:38 Comment: Don't know.\n30:41 Comment: More losses.\n30:43 Comment: For example, Ante Budemer moved to Sandoria for almost 2 million.\n30:47 Comment: This, by the way, is so that you understand, yes, the level.\n30:51 Comment: This is Crutone's most expensive deal yet.\n30:54 Comment: The most serious gain.\n30:56 Comment: 1 million 800 thousand euros.\n30:58 Comment: Do you understand, right?\n31:0 Comment: On Budemer, well, perhaps they kept Leonardo Capece.\n31:7 Comment: In such a way that they signed a full contract with him.\n31:10 Comment: That's probably all there is to be proud of.\n31:12 Comment: So everyone, almost everyone in Italy writes Crouton off.\n31:17 Comment: But here's the pitch.\n31:19 Comment: This kind of scoring chance could have arisen if, in my opinion, Diego Falcinelli had shown himself somehow more simply.\n31:29 Comment: Also, by the way, with experience playing in Serie A.\n31:31 Comment: Here's another point.\n31:33 Comment: And this is a truly goal-scoring action.\n31:35 Comment: This is a moment that definitely had to be implemented.\n31:39 Comment: Necessarily.\n31:41 Comment: Here are those on.\n31:43 Comment: Firill Roma is ahead.\n31:45 Comment: As a result, a simple serve turns into a scoring chance.\n31:48 Comment: Manuelos and Florence played very poorly here.\n31:52 Comment: Very weak.\n31:54 Comment: Everything seemed to be clear.\n31:56 Comment: They have two rivals.\n31:58 Comment: They took personal care.\n32:0 Comment: Simple delivery.\n32:2 Comment: There is no amazing spin of the ball and so on.\n32:4 Comment: In the end, both fell short.\n32:6 Comment: And Rafael Paladin.\n32:8 Comment: He did not become an executioner for the Roman defense in this episode.\n32:13 Comment: Shot wide.\n32:15 Comment: From a killing position.\n32:16 Comment: But Roma allows their opponents a lot in this half hour.\n32:22 Comment: And you know, so far the weakest link, as we see, in Roma’s defense is Florency.\n32:30 Comment: Florency, through his edge, often entered the free space of the penalty area as a Paladin.\n32:39 Comment: It is clear that Florency is pulling ahead.\n32:42 Comment: He's already doing great.\n32:44 Comment: He has already done it.\n32:46 Comment: But you and I understand and know whose blood it will be.\n32:50 Comment: Yes?\n32:52 Comment: He is an Atapi player first and foremost.\n32:56 Comment: But he turned into defenders last season.\n33:5 Comment: Another standard.\n33:8 Comment: Of course, Croton football players are trying, away from the penalty area.\n33:14 Comment: But, as you can see, there are excellent performers.\n33:16 Comment: This is for you Salajo, Toti, Shrawi can kiss you.\n33:20 Comment: Submission from Francesco.\n33:22 Comment: But it's right in the hands of the goalkicker.\n33:26 Comment: Yes, I forgive you.\n33:28 Comment: I forgave, frankly speaking, Rafael Paladin Roma.\n33:32 Comment: Ex-Juventus striker, if you remember.\n33:35 Comment: Well, somewhere around there he played 50 matches for Juventus.\n33:39 Comment: Scored 10 goals.\n33:42 Comment: Well, basically, my career started off promisingly.\n33:46 Comment: Well, and then Saversa Lernitana, Levorno, Genoa, by the way, Parmo and here are the crotons.\n33:53 Comment: 2015 plays for this team.\n33:56 Comment: At one time, Rafael Paladinov was even seen in the main Italian national team.\n34:0 Comment: He played regularly in the youth teams.\n34:2 Comment: But he played the main three matches.\n34:4 Comment: Here he is with the ball. Please note that Florenzo is located very far from him.\n34:10 Comment: Yes, in such a defensive position, but still.\n34:14 Comment: Florenzo was already practically squeezed into goalkeeping.\n34:17 Comment: Look, he doesn’t meet me.\n34:20 Comment: Aggressively, I mean.\n34:22 Comment: Maybe he is afraid, of course, of some feints, some unimaginable accelerations.\n34:29 Comment: But it seems to me that we need to act more closely.\n34:32 Comment: The paladin is currently leading the croton attack behind him.\n34:37 Comment: Another corner turn by Chentsov.\n34:40 Comment: Serve to the near post.\n34:42 Comment: A series of ricochets.\n34:44 Comment: Here Dzhekov pushed his opponent.\n34:46 Comment: But one more serve.\n34:48 Comment: Chentsov, by the way, it seems to me that in this situation he could have caught less.\n34:52 Comment: Okay, offside.\n34:54 Comment: But here again it speaks of a lack of mutual understanding.\n34:57 Comment: That's where the offside was, yes, between the goalkeeper and the defense.\n35:0 Comment: OK.\n35:2 Comment: Bad episode.\n35:10 Comment: I'll give you a super chance.\n35:12 Comment: Rafael has a great chance.\n35:15 Comment: It’s amazing, of course, to look at him for 32 years.\n35:20 Comment: Time flies.\n35:22 Comment: Fasio.\n35:24 Comment: Manulas.\n35:26 Comment: Roman takes a short pause to get back into the grooves, right?\n35:30 Comment: To take control of the ball, the game, the territory again.\n35:34 Comment: And, of course, take a break.\n35:38 Comment: To take control of the ball, the game, the territory, as she likes.\n35:42 Comment: Paraves on toti, toti.\n35:45 Comment: Again, with such a light, seemingly instant, the foot sends the ball to where the partner is.\n35:53 Comment: Well, or vice versa.\n35:55 Comment: With this pass, with this ball, the partner forces him to go somewhere.\n35:59 Comment: But it's almost always accurate.\n36:4 Comment: Bruno Perez.\n36:6 Comment: Interesting.\n36:7 Comment: Kasani will be beaten eight times during this match.\n36:9 Comment: Let's count.\n36:10 Comment: But here Salah is in a striking position.\n36:12 Comment: Goal!\n36:13 Comment: But this is a truly Roman scoring attack.\n36:17 Comment: No slowdown.\n36:19 Comment: Or maybe even the other way around.\n36:21 Comment: There is a pause, but at some point there is a sharp transfer.\n36:24 Comment: And the attack explodes.\n36:27 Comment: Explodes with the quick feet of Mohamed Salah.\n36:31 Comment: Who crosses the penalty area and then hits it under the crossbar.\n36:34 Comment: And it doesn’t matter there anymore.\n36:36 Comment: He will put at least two, at least three, at least four goalkeepers.\n36:39 Comment: At least he will build the Berlin Wall.\n36:41 Comment: It will strike.\n36:43 Comment: Stitches.\n36:47 Comment: Ed Sharawi, by the way, becomes the author of the assist.\n36:51 Comment: Surrounded by almost three rivals.\n36:53 Comment: Stefan takes this slight reverse touch to Salah.\n36:58 Comment: And two Roma newcomers from last season.\n37:1 Comment: They showed good performances that season too.\n37:5 Comment: Good understanding.\n37:8 Comment: One football. The same.\n37:14 Comment: They didn't play anything different.\n37:17 Comment: Well, here they understand each other.\n37:19 Comment: They play deftly, effectively, quickly.\n37:22 Comment: 2-0 in the 38th minute of the match.\n37:26 Comment: Well, now, I think Roma can breathe a sigh of relief.\n37:30 Comment: Although one of the favorite predictions of Italian coaches.\n37:34 Comment: More precisely, let's say, the favorite prediction of a Russian fan, appropriated by the Italian coach.\n37:42 Comment: I actually said it for the first time, the Italian coach.\n37:45 Comment: The fact that 2-0 is not the most comfortable score.\n37:49 Comment: 1-0 is better than 2-0.\n37:51 Comment: We are talking, of course, about loss of concentration.\n37:54 Comment: Roma has already lost this concentration a couple of times.\n37:57 Comment: But I think it’s important that the second goal was scored before the break.\n38:4 Comment: This will allow us to discuss something, restructure something after the break, or more precisely, probably during this pause itself.\n38:13 Comment: Maybe this will allow Spalletti to somehow balance the team and make some kind of replacement.\n38:21 Comment: Because for now, for now, 4 players at once, well, essentially, are not defending.\n38:27 Comment: Al Sharawi, Toki Salah, Dzeko.\n38:30 Comment: Jacko, the forum center is heavy.\n38:32 Comment: Well, why should he rush forward there?\n38:34 Comment: Currents, back and forth, right?\n38:36 Comment: Toki, in principle, is not capable of covering long distances at this age.\n38:42 Comment: And Nige Ravi and Salah have a lot of acceleration.\n38:47 Comment: Although, of course, with such Crouton...\n38:50 Comment: I won't say it's folding.\n38:52 Comment: Cruton also had a good time in this match at times.\n38:55 Comment: But, in general, you can take further risks.\n38:58 Comment: Salah.\n39:0 Comment: Salah took on two opponents at once.\n39:3 Comment: Passed it back.\n39:5 Comment: Strotman here.\n39:7 Comment: Parades.\n39:11 Comment: Well, Kevin Strotman is in phase.\n39:14 Comment: 2-0.\n39:16 Comment: 2-0 Crutone.\n39:18 Comment: Well, we can say that this team hasn’t conceded too many goals yet, right?\n39:24 Comment: One goal from Bolonia, three goals from Jen.\n39:28 Comment: Two from Empel.\n39:30 Comment: That is, this team has never been defeated.\n39:32 Comment: Bye.\n39:33 Comment: Paladin.\n39:35 Comment: Returns to the partner.\n39:37 Comment: Good through ball to Falcinelli.\n39:39 Comment: He picked up speed.\n39:41 Comment: Well, he is certainly not the fastest striker in Serie A.\n39:46 Comment: But taking into account the fact that he won the position, he could, of course, reach it.\n39:55 Comment: Good, by the way, Kruton’s attack really worked.\n40:3 Comment: It can be classified as a counterattack.\n40:8 Comment: Everything was completed in one go.\n40:11 Comment: Well, Falcinelli.\n40:14 Comment: Falcinelli.\n40:16 Comment: I already said that he has experience playing in Serie A.\n40:23 Comment: Here the cross from Jaiko was not the most accurate.\n40:26 Comment: Please note that he ended up in the right winger position two times in a row for some reason.\n40:34 Comment: In theory, such shots should be made on him.\n40:38 Comment: So Falcinelli, if you remember, played for Susolo in Serie A last season.\n40:42 Comment: In general, it belongs to Susolo for quite a long time.\n40:45 Comment: Since 2009.\n40:47 Comment: Well, then such real Italian adventures.\n40:52 Comment: His Italian travels began in 2010.\n40:55 Comment: Follinio, Juvestabe, Volonciano, Perugio.\n41:0 Comment: And here's Crouton from 2016.\n41:2 Comment: These are all rentals. Seasonal.\n41:9 Comment: Well, it must be said that only in Perugio, in Serie B, did he demonstrate more or less such stable and impressive performance.\n41:22 Comment: It is clear that Crutone so far, in its history, in its way, resembles Carpi or Frasenones.\n41:39 Comment: The same teams that make it to Serie A for the first time in their history.\n41:44 Comment: Well, they immediately return back to the Italian football dungeon.\n41:49 Comment: But you're always waiting for something.\n41:52 Comment: Something unusual.\n41:54 Comment: There is an example of Sesuolo.\n41:56 Comment: There are other examples.\n41:58 Comment: Empoli.\n42:0 Comment: It was a good shot. There, as if two players were opening up at once.\n42:5 Comment: In general, to complete the topic, there are examples of teams that, when moving to Serie A, suddenly became a surprise.\n42:13 Comment: But still, this requires performers.\n42:17 Comment: Cool shot. Again, I think Salah no longer looked at the goalkeeper.\n42:22 Comment: The third goal for him in this championship.\n42:25 Comment: Played as effectively as possible in this episode, without making things up.\n42:31 Comment: It would be necessary to invent it there, before the penalty area. They dealt with it.\n42:35 Comment: I think this is also a draw worthy of the long training time spent.\n42:44 Comment: Through a play near the corner of the field, then a pass to the near post.\n42:48 Comment: And there Strotman throws his heel further.\n42:51 Comment: And he continues this pass.\n42:53 Comment: Totti heels the ball towards Jekko.\n42:56 Comment: Innings. And Alex Korda catches the ball.\n43:1 Comment: Great attack. And the diagonal to Totti was executed.\n43:4 Comment: To be honest, I didn’t have time to notice who performed it. Just great.\n43:9 Comment: And Totti, I think, could easily have handled the ball in some more familiar way.\n43:17 Comment: But he did it with his heel. And then the outside of his foot hit Jekko in the forehead.\n43:21 Comment: For Jekko, of course, it is important to score while he continues to be in the attack zone of the sharp tongues.\n43:38 Comment: Everyone laughs at, again, his effectiveness.\n43:43 Comment: Undistinguished. Well, yes, indeed, he needs four or five chances to score.\n43:48 Comment: But he has these moments.\n43:51 Comment: Everything will be completely bad when Jekko, well, somehow moves around like that.\n43:57 Comment: Here and there. And he won’t meet the ball at all.\n44:1 Comment: That's when Pishi disappeared.\n44:3 Comment: El Sharawi. And he received the pass to Jekko.\n44:8 Comment: And for a second it seemed that Kordats had lost the gate.\n44:12 Comment: And he doesn’t control the situation. El Sharawi aimed for the far corner. It was great.\n44:17 Comment: And Jekko made a very good discount that was comfortable for his partner.\n44:21 Comment: Although he was attacked by two opponents at once.\n44:34 Comment: Roma showed some good football. But, again, this is not the case when the team should be retrained.\n44:40 Comment: Well, first of all, let’s still talk about the fact that, once again, yes, that the opponent is of an undistinguished level.\n44:47 Comment: Secondly, Croton had his moments. And again questions about the balance in Roma’s game.\n44:53 Comment: Having lost to Ferentina in the previous round last weekend,\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: For your attention, the score 2-0 settled down at the break.\n0:5 Comment: And I must say that Roma seems to be something special\n0:8 Comment: I didn’t experience any problems during the first 45 minutes,\n0:11 Comment: But Kraton had two moments when they could have scored.\n0:17 Comment: But at the same time, the Romans feel at ease\n0:20 Comment: on the attack, trying different options, penetration\n0:23 Comment: Enough in the penalty area.\n0:25 Comment: Well, I think, probably, Roma will somehow develop\n0:28 Comment: your advantage, especially, I repeat, we need to rehabilitate ourselves\n0:32 Comment: in the eyes of the fans for this disappointing defeat\n0:35 Comment: from Ferentin.\n0:36 Comment: 2-0 and let me remind you about the lineups.\n0:40 Comment: The second half has begun, there seem to be changes... but we'll see,\n0:46 Comment: We'll see though.\n0:47 Comment: I see, yes, Kraton has a replacement.\n0:53 Comment: Kraton has a replacement on the field.\n0:56 Comment: Now I'll tell you who.\n0:59 Comment: Kraton and Kordats are the number one pre-players in the gates.\n1:2 Comment: Ferrari 13 kleitome, 3 Cecherine, 17 Samperise, 31.\n1:10 Comment: The number 6 player, Marcus Rogden from Sweden, entered the field.\n1:13 Comment: He replaced, or rather he left the field, yes, and instead of him\n1:20 Comment: Andrea Nalin came out.\n1:21 Comment: Defender number 9.\n1:24 Comment: He fell for number 20 Kapetse, 28 Krizetik, 8 Falcinelli,\n1:29 Comment: 11 Palladino, 7.\n1:32 Comment: Roma, well, first of all, has a captain.\n1:35 Comment: He was just with the ball.\n1:36 Comment: Francesco Totti is mostly in the lineup.\n1:39 Comment: Isn't this a reason to spend an evening for the fans\n1:43 Comment: Jelarusi, of course, spend the evening in front of the screen.\n1:46 Comment: A wonderful opportunity to admire Francesco.\n1:50 Comment: Who knows, maybe, figuratively speaking, the psycho will fly\n1:55 Comment: and in general the entire 90 minutes will be given to the player.\n1:56 Comment: Roma's gate is beautiful.\n1:57 Comment: Number 1 fielders.\n1:58 Comment: Perez 13, Manuella 44, Facio 20, Florenza 24, Strogman 6,\n2:3 Comment: Salah 11, Paredes 5, Jack, who didn't jump out,\n2:11 Comment: number 9, Totti 10, El Sharawi 92.\n2:16 Comment: Let me remind you once again, the goal was scored in the 26th minute by Stefan El Sharawi\n2:20 Comment: from Alexander's transmission to Florence.\n2:23 Comment: In the 37th Mohamed Salah after a pass from Stephane El Sharawi,\n2:27 Comment: whose 1 plus 1, by the way, made the score 2-2.\n2:31 Comment: For El Sharawi this is the first goal and the first efficient assist\n2:34 Comment: this season.\n2:35 Comment: And here's a pass to Dzeko and it's 3-0.\n2:39 Comment: An outstanding broadcast from somewhere, I don't know, a neighboring city,\n2:46 Comment:  may be.\n2:47 Comment: Let's guess who made it.\n2:49 Comment:  There are options?\n2:51 Comment: You all understand that it's not even Edin and Jack who are applauded.\n2:54 Comment: This fantastic transmission of perfect power, perfect direction\n3:0 Comment: I could do 40 meters in this team, I think,\n3:4 Comment: Only Francesco Totti.\n3:10 Comment: But she was so convenient for the attacker.\n3:15 Comment: How did the ball spin turn out?\n3:19 Comment: He literally spun that ball into Edin Jack's foot.\n3:24 Comment: He also bounced back so gently and pliantly.\n3:28 Comment: That’s it, throw me over the goalkeeper’s goal, as if he asked for this ball.\n3:32 Comment: Francesco Totti is in the club's starting line-up for the first time in a year,\n3:37 Comment: to whom he gave his life, dedicated his destiny.\n3:43 Comment: Doesn't leave the field without scoring and continues Roma Ferry.\n3:48 Comment: 3-0 already at the beginning of the second half.\n3:50 Comment: Bruno Ferris, bumping into those crotons,\n3:57 Comment: Climbing out from under the lawn at the wrong moment, he still collapsed and earned a free kick.\n4:4 Comment: Totti will now have the opportunity to score a goal.\n4:8 Comment: I practically rule out possible other authors of the strike.\n4:14 Comment: Yes, they hit me once, a second time, and even if the ball was played.\n4:20 Comment: Anyway, they didn’t treat Ferris very nicely before that.\n4:27 Comment: Penalty.\n4:28 Comment: There is an opportunity to view the wonderful tattoos of Alex Cordos.\n4:34 Comment: There is such a style in tattoos.\n4:38 Comment: I mean his right sleeve.\n4:40 Comment: When tattoos are so old school.\n4:47 Comment: Well, okay, that's another topic.\n4:49 Comment: Francesco Totti is also embalmed.\n4:52 Comment: I’m still amazed at Dmitry Sennikov, how he became one of our experts.\n4:57 Comment: Like from Moftballs.\n4:59 Comment: But the way I played hasn’t changed at all since then.\n5:1 Comment: Here comes Francesco Totti.\n5:4 Comment: He was, I don’t know how it is for women, but he became even more attractive, or something, as a man.\n5:11 Comment: Looks great.\n5:12 Comment: It's his age.\n5:13 Comment: From the rockets.\n5:15 Comment: A free-kick, but this is the case when, yes, he makes a claim on Redus.\n5:21 Comment: That's the case when a little hitter had to be rolled.\n5:24 Comment: That is, not just to the edge.\n5:26 Comment: Also under attack closer to the striking leg.\n5:29 Comment: Just because the defenders have time to jump out from under the wall.\n5:34 Comment: From the wall.\n5:35 Comment: Well, that's it, the blow is covered.\n5:39 Comment: Many people wonder why such balls are played at all, yes.\n5:42 Comment: This is always a chance to shorten the distance for this very wall.\n5:46 Comment: But rollbacks like this, this kind of play allow you to slightly change the angle of impact, change the angle of attack.\n5:56 Comment: And beat this very wall.\n5:58 Comment: But it didn't work out.\n6:0 Comment:  Did not work out.\n6:1 Comment: Anyway, Roma’s search continues.\n6:4 Comment: Look, Salah is defending here with Manolas.\n6:8 Comment: And Florence, yes, Florence is somewhere out there too, out of frame.\n6:11 Comment: Flew off to her tackle.\n6:15 Comment: In general, such episodes make it clear that Roma is not going to do any nonsense in defense.\n6:28 Comment: We're looking at the Crutone standard.\n6:34 Comment: The Roman football players have grouped together.\n6:37 Comment: A short distance from the Vratarskaya line, everyone scatters together like a wave.\n6:41 Comment: And Manolas, who feels great in horse martial arts.\n6:48 Comment: Manolas is generally good at martial arts.\n6:50 Comment: I've told you more than once that he's in the first three.\n6:53 Comment: Manolas is generally good at martial arts.\n6:56 Comment: I have talked more than once about the fact that he loves kickboxing, loves martial arts, and mixfight.\n7:2 Comment: He works out on his own in the gym.\n7:5 Comment: By the way, I know a lot of football players, like Zlatan Ibrahimovic, yes, for, well, let’s put it this way,\n7:13 Comment: To develop my body, yes, for flexibility, I work in the gym and do martial arts.\n7:20 Comment: Dmitry Tarasov, for example, also likes to hit the bag, or even get crushed.\n7:30 Comment: 3-0. 3-0 after Saturday's defeat to Ferentina.\n7:36 Comment: Just what you need. Balm.\n7:39 Comment: For the Roman soul.\n7:41 Comment: In that match, Roma actually looked good, according to some analysts, even better than Ferentina.\n7:49 Comment: And everything was decided at the very end, when Badel’s shot, for me, still should not have been counted as a goal.\n7:58 Comment: Still, a partner appeared on Badel’s path and spread his legs.\n8:2 Comment: This partner was in an offside position, obviously.\n8:6 Comment: So he's, let's say, at a playing distance, he had an impact on the episode.\n8:13 Comment: Legs spread, confused.\n8:16 Comment: The ball slipped between the legs and between the legs.\n8:18 Comment: Well, that's it. The goal flew into the air, but the referees did not react.\n8:25 Comment: In the end it's 1-0.\n8:27 Comment: And, well, it seems that with such passable football and with a refereeing error, there’s nothing to scold for.\n8:34 Comment: But Spalletti already said at the press conference that the most important points were lost.\n8:38 Comment: The most important.\n8:40 Comment: It's like he's ready to regret them somewhere at the end of the championship.\n8:43 Comment: Counterattack is cool.\n8:44 Comment:  He...\n8:45 Comment: Attention! Scoring chance!\n8:47 Comment: Yes, hit the near corner!\n8:49 Comment: Falcinelli in this episode, it seems to me, is purely strategic, as a forward,\n8:54 Comment: I acted rather strangely.\n8:56 Comment: Well, yes, in theory, yes, you need to attack in the far, bottom corner.\n8:59 Comment: But here there was an option to play like a stud, like in sala, right?\n9:4 Comment: Which I don't think about for too long.\n9:6 Comment: I hit him, albeit in the center, but with such force.\n9:10 Comment: Already there, no one would be able to cover, be in time, and so on.\n9:16 Comment: We're looking at the standard.\n9:17 Comment: Here again, again there are rarefied zones in Roma’s penalty area.\n9:22 Comment: Tackle to the near post.\n9:24 Comment: Literally, the entire belt is removed at the standards, in their own penalty area.\n9:29 Comment: But still, there is such a group of heroes here.\n9:32 Comment: Mama Fazio 195 cm.\n9:35 Comment: Manulas is under 190.\n9:37 Comment: Edin always helps Jack.\n9:40 Comment: And Edmond is good too.\n9:43 Comment: But what kind of transmission from Francesco Totti?\n9:46 Comment: This is, of course, pastura.\n9:48 Comment: I don't know about the goal.\n9:50 Comment: After all, there are many matches going on at the same time.\n9:53 Comment: Manulas seemed to be talking to Totti about something, even in such elevated tones.\n9:57 Comment: Well, go talk to him.\n10:1 Comment: From high.\n10:2 Comment: Well, he'll put anyone up.\n10:3 Comment: And in this regard, Totti...\n10:6 Comment: In this regard, he sometimes even runs aground.\n10:9 Comment: Many people say that the presence of Totti in the lineup is sometimes not so much a benefit, but a detriment for Roma.\n10:17 Comment: It's always this kind of bomb.\n10:20 Comment: It's just a slow-acting bomb, sometimes fast.\n10:24 Comment: So, of course, it’s not easy with him.\n10:27 Comment: He's the chief glastilin.\n10:30 Comment: Rome of football.\n10:32 Comment: There's nothing you can do about it.\n10:35 Comment: Many people even put it that way.\n10:38 Comment: When Totti leaves the team and finishes his career, then Roma will win their next win.\n10:47 Comment: But while Totti is on the field.\n10:49 Comment: And you know, Spalletti said at one of the press conferences that Totti is in the best shape since Spalletti was in charge of the team.\n10:57 Comment: Absolutely fantastic, he has no right not to deliver it.\n11:1 Comment: Here was another potentially sharp, dangerous counterattack.\n11:6 Comment: But in the end Proton gets a counter-attack.\n11:10 Comment: Dzeko 2-0.\n11:13 Comment: Edin Dzeko scores a double.\n11:15 Comment: Well, just think about it, huh.\n11:19 Comment: Dzeko takes two out of three chances.\n11:25 Comment: Great pass from Mohamed Salah.\n11:29 Comment: Yes, there was no offside at any point here.\n11:34 Comment: The defender played poorly, but this pass had such a pace.\n11:38 Comment: We see that the Roman moles helped Roma Crotona score.\n11:44 Comment: Because at the very last moment the ball jumped over the defender's foot.\n11:49 Comment: Have you seen the second replay?\n11:51 Comment: The ball bounced over my foot.\n11:54 Comment: This is what helped Jack get into the ideal striking position.\n11:58 Comment: The Balkan forward's fourth goal in five games in the statistics.\n12:3 Comment: He scored against Dinezo at the end of the match in the 82nd minute.\n12:8 Comment: Scaleri didn't score, but he made an assist.\n12:11 Comment: And he came out there immediately after the break in the 46th minute.\n12:14 Comment: And already on the 46th he organized a goal and made a pass.\n12:19 Comment: He scored with Samdori.\n12:21 Comment: One goal. Although it also came only in the second half, right from the 46th minute.\n12:28 Comment: Well, here he is at the base in the match against Croton.\n12:30 Comment: Yes, just Crotons.\n12:32 Comment: But his effectiveness today is very good.\n12:36 Comment: Here you go. Five matches, four goals and there’s still half an hour of play left.\n12:40 Comment: 4-0. Roma crushes the opponent.\n12:44 Comment: Well, let's see if she's going to stop there.\n12:49 Comment: We need to do statistics. Again, a luxurious pass to Salah.\n12:53 Comment: Once again we were shown the final phase of the counterattack, when Salah made an amazing pass.\n12:59 Comment:  Thin.\n13:1 Comment: But even before that there was a magnificent pass from deep to Salah.\n13:8 Comment: Well, you know, that's what they call class.\n13:12 Comment: When the team is basically, basically, not enough.\n13:19 Comment: But basically the same approaches.\n13:21 Comment: And look, another scoring chance could arise.\n13:23 Comment: Falcineli. Not bad, by the way, he understands dibling here.\n13:26 Comment: But it was Falcineli who ran into a counterattack with a partner 2 on 2.\n13:30 Comment: They could have played a better ball.\n13:33 Comment: As a result, there was an interception, a counterattack in response, and now Salah and Jack ran out in reverse.\n13:38 Comment: You see, that's the story.\n13:40 Comment: At the most crucial moment, Crotona players cannot perform the same as Roma players.\n13:47 Comment: That's it. That's the reason for 0-4.\n13:53 Comment: Well, here are the statistics for that same Jack.\n13:56 Comment: What's going on here? Is it really a penalty?\n13:58 Comment: Is it really a penalty?\n14:0 Comment:  However...\n14:3 Comment: You know, so boo that everything happened here.\n14:5 Comment: It just seemed to me that such shame was quite playful.\n14:11 Comment: The penalty is awarded to Carmen Russo.\n14:15 Comment: Well, don't be a dry macho, Kostya Khashchensov.\n14:19 Comment: The ball of Rafael Paladino, who managed to ruin a couple of episodes today,\n14:25 Comment: But at the same time, he was one of the thick replacements.\n14:29 Comment: So, Paladino versus Khashchensov. Khashchensov's strike!\n14:34 Comment: Roma's Polish goalkeeper pulls the ball out.\n14:39 Comment: Probably capturing Croton's powerlessness in this game.\n14:44 Comment: There are enough cool ones, a little less than Roma.\n14:48 Comment: But they simply can't take them, even when it comes to penalties.\n14:52 Comment: Paladino didn't hit well. It wasn't a corner kick.\n14:59 Comment: But it was not a frankly weak blow.\n15:2 Comment: Therefore, the compliment disappeared here.\n15:5 Comment: Replacement in the Crotona lineup. So, at the same time, yes, the substitution took place, and a penalty was awarded.\n15:11 Comment: By the way, I'd like to watch a replay of the episode again.\n15:14 Comment: Paul left Mario with Samperisi.\n15:17 Comment: Bruno Martello entered the field.\n15:20 Comment: 4-0.\n15:22 Comment: Also the penalty was not realized. But this, of course, is a blow.\n15:25 Comment: Salah, by the way, really wanted to perform a similar program.\n15:28 Comment: This time the mood was already there.\n15:31 Comment: We're looking at Sharov.\n15:35 Comment: Florence, it turns out he earned a penalty.\n15:38 Comment: Did he hit his leg?\n15:40 Comment: A dynamic episode. I would, of course, like one more repeat.\n15:47 Comment: But Rousseau is somehow too bold and...\n15:52 Comment: ...did it by epilation.\n15:54 Comment: Heads the point.\n15:55 Comment: Here's a nice flirt from Florence.\n16:0 Comment: But again, yes, that’s what we were talking about.\n16:3 Comment: Florence is, of course, a great helper of attacks. Absolutely.\n16:6 Comment: This is a player dedicated to...\n16:10 Comment: ...pass the game.\n16:12 Comment: He can make a pass of absolutely any length.\n16:16 Comment: But he loses his position regularly.\n16:19 Comment: Or he just makes such mistakes in his penalty areas.\n16:29 Comment: Dzeko again makes a very convenient discount for his partner.\n16:32 Comment: No mistakes.\n16:33 Comment: Dzheko, Knight, Sharovy.\n16:34 Comment: Sharovi further on Toti. Toti hits!\n16:37 Comment: This is a half-hit, half-cross, to which three partners could respond at once.\n16:41 Comment: But Toti scored these kinds of goals.\n16:46 Comment: In my opinion, his famous goal was scored by Dory himself.\n16:52 Comment: So what happened here?\n16:56 Comment: That's not what directors are focusing on.\n17:0 Comment: Yes, and the kick is not in the corner.\n17:3 Comment: We need episodes like this...\n17:6 Comment: You need to invest in such strikes.\n17:11 Comment: Many football players say that the goalkeeper can guess or not guess as much as he likes.\n17:16 Comment: But if you punch more or less hard and closer to the corner, then there is no chance.\n17:22 Comment: Toti is not sure in this situation. I would like to hit him the wrong way.\n17:26 Comment: Francesco smears. Nice move, by the way.\n17:30 Comment: Every time it ends up where the Romans attack.\n17:38 Comment: And in general, of course, in a good mood.\n17:42 Comment: Francesco's good mood. Could it have been otherwise?\n17:46 Comment: He hasn't been in the main lineup for a long, long time.\n17:51 Comment: This is great news.\n17:53 Comment: By the way, I don't know how...\n17:58 Comment: This information, how early it spread throughout Rome.\n18:2 Comment: The fact that Francesco will appear in the team.\n18:5 Comment: Surely this could even affect the sale.\n18:9 Comment: There is no forelock.\n18:23 Comment: Well, we see how Toti wants to score.\n18:26 Comment: He was already in a striking position. There were chances before that.\n18:29 Comment: And the goal is not at all simple. Will he score? If he scores.\n18:33 Comment: Firstly, I must say that the last time he appeared in the main lineup was on September 20, 2015.\n18:40 Comment: He hasn’t even been in the lineup for over a year now.\n18:43 Comment: Since September 20, 2015. But how many goals have you scored, huh?\n18:47 Comment: Let him only perform the Joker.\n18:50 Comment: So, then he started in the match against Susuol.\n18:57 Comment: And in the same game he scored his 300th goal for Djalo Rosi. 300 in general.\n19:3 Comment: But you and I know very well that the main goal is\n19:9 Comment: To score as much as possible in the Italian Championship, as much as possible.\n19:12 Comment: To set an eternal record.\n19:15 Comment: But to do this, of course, you need to stack the balls in batches.\n19:19 Comment: And if Totti scores in this game, he will already have 250 goals in Serie A.\n19:29 Comment: Well, let’s add that Francesco Totti’s birthday is coming up very soon.\n19:36 Comment: Maybe this is the gift Spoliti gave him for the upcoming holiday.\n19:42 Comment: Francesco Totti will turn 40 on September 27.\n19:47 Comment: Oh well, we're concentrating on the emperor here.\n19:51 Comment: Although here the main character is Combatant.\n19:54 Comment: In the last minutes, Palladino missed.\n19:58 Comment: Palladino also goes as a replacement.

We must be content with the Europa League.\n31:3 Comment: However, Roma’s reserves are good, good.\n31:6 Comment: And you can even use the second team to solve the problem of leaving the group.\n31:15 Comment: Well, and then we can fight, of course, for the main trophy for Roma.\n31:19 Comment: I think winning the Europa League will really be a status.\n31:25 Comment: There aren't many trophies.\n31:29 Comment: Zhaiko.\n31:31 Comment: Nice pass.\n31:34 Comment: A bit of a miss.\n31:36 Comment: Turbo could have made it here if Edin had executed a stronger pass.\n31:41 Comment: Bruno Perez continues to iron Brow Com.\n31:47 Comment: In general, I must say that the left-back position is not the most familiar for him.\n31:53 Comment: We know Bruno Perez as a right-back.\n31:55 Comment: It's time to play for Torino and Turbo.\n31:58 Comment: Turbo hits the top tier.\n32:2 Comment: Somewhere out there the ball is now looking.\n32:4 Comment: Or maybe he became a gift for someone after the match.\n32:21 Comment: Well, that's a face like this.\n32:24 Comment: He received it the other day\n32:30 Comment: such a very nice compliment from Ancelotti's colleague,\n32:34 Comment: the manager of Bavaria today.\n32:38 Comment: He said that he was the ideal coach for Roma.\n32:42 Comment: He probably also means the game style.\n32:47 Comment: Oh, what a hit on the post.\n32:50 Comment: A powerful shot.\n32:52 Comment: Here we go again, from some almost sleepy state\n32:57 Comment: This game is breaking out.\n33:1 Comment: And we get a scoring chance.\n33:4 Comment: Another attack.\n33:6 Comment: They are playing very deep now, close to their own penalty area.\n33:10 Comment: The Croton football players have the opportunity to run away.\n33:14 Comment: Joan Jesus attacked his opponent in a dirty way, holding him by the shirt.\n33:17 Comment: At the same time, there is space for a counterattack at Liturbe.\n33:22 Comment: He runs on the right side and only in the penalty area.\n33:25 Comment: Meets the opponent.

Another flanker, Emerson, enters the field.\n34:12 Comment: I remembered Dorosi and his sending off in the match against Porto.\n34:19 Comment: The second villain for this public was Emerson.\n34:22 Comment: Let's see, by the way, how she meets him.\n34:25 Comment: Emerson also received a red card.\n34:29 Comment: Whistling. The whistling is heard. Heard in the stands.\n34:35 Comment: There was no time to pay attention to this.\n34:38 Comment: Emerson has time to prove his need to Roma.\n34:46 Comment: The competition is very high.\n34:50 Comment: Jackov. Well then. Well.\n34:52 Comment: We note with you that all three replacements have been made.\n34:56 Comment: And Turbo and Jesus and Emerson appeared on the field, replacing Manolas, Florences, Lak.\n35:3 Comment: This means that Francesco in Tota will spend the entire 90 minutes on the field.\n35:10 Comment: To be honest, I don't have much time to dig around right now.\n35:15 Comment: I just remembered in the previous match, when Tote was in the starting lineup.\n35:20 Comment: I don’t remember if he spent the whole 90 minutes there, he scored a goal.\n35:25 Comment: But, probably, a long time ago there really was such a match for Francesco.\n35:31 Comment: Well, so what. There is a result.\n35:34 Comment: You can, of course, indulge in a little populism, yes, I mean burn it down.\n35:41 Comment: Although Tote, of course, has already been busy.\n35:44 Comment: 40 years old. Well, what do you want.\n35:50 Comment: Well, coach Spalletti, a genius, according to Ancelotti, copes with the task of beating an outsider.\n35:57 Comment: You really wouldn’t want to miss it here.\n36:0 Comment: Good today.\n36:2 Comment: Chen Si.\n36:4 Comment: And he didn't deserve the goal he missed.\n36:7 Comment: But Roma's defense deserved it.\n36:9 Comment: So to speak.\n36:12 Comment: Well, Gollan didn't help the team today.\n36:16 Comment: Diego Pirotti, Daniel Aderosi.

Naingalan will replace it.\n38:40 Comment: They'll play the whole match.\n38:42 Comment: In general, he can change the team's game with the help of substitutions.\n38:51 Comment:  Much.\n38:53 Comment: El Shiravich was now trying to throw the ball to Jack with one touch behind the defender's back.\n38:59 Comment: Well, this is, again, a move that Toti has already performed in this match.\n39:12 Comment: A good victory in terms of statistical indicators for the same Jack,\n39:20 Comment: for the same Shiravi, who did not score, for Salah.\n39:24 Comment: We don't forget about transmissions.\n39:26 Comment: And I’ll say it again, this texture is healing after playing with Ferentina.\n39:35 Comment: After that match, Roma players talked for a long time in the press about,\n39:40 Comment: What, they say, we don’t deserve.\n39:43 Comment: The strot was furious, saying that you were saying that the three points should have been ours.\n39:50 Comment: Spalletti echoed him, but again, Ferentina is also very dangerous, in my opinion, not for a football player.\n39:58 Comment: A shot that could have turned into the fifth goal for Roma.\n40:4 Comment: Attack from the second floor.\n40:9 Comment: High jump, high, you know, from the highest on the field, Joan Jesus.\n40:16 Comment: Opportunities to admire Francesco Toti and his elegant passes.\n40:23 Comment: You see what’s good about Toti is that, of course, he doesn’t hold the ball in this situation,\n40:28 Comment: Unlike many of their partners.\n40:31 Comment: It compensates for this lack of speed and mobility with its temporary transmission.\n40:37 Comment: And, of course, their accuracy.\n40:42 Comment: Hey, what can we talk about here, friends?\n40:45 Comment: We admired you today, I don’t know how appropriate the word admire is here.\n40:52 Comment: We were worried, maybe, yes, in some matches, about some matches in Russia.\n40:58 Comment: And this football day ends with such a performance by the bright Francesca Toti and his Roma.\n41:8 Comment:  For dessert.\n41:10 Comment: Feed.\n41:26 Comment: Roma's starting lineup is crystallizing.\n41:31 Comment: I think there will still be some changes in much more important matches.\n41:38 Comment: Mendalan instead of Paredes, for example.\n41:41 Comment: I think, after all.\n41:43 Comment: Oh, what a moment!\n41:45 Comment: Well, here we are again talking about defense, Roma.\n41:48 Comment: All these perturbations, all these tests of one ligament and then another lead to such episodes.\n41:58 Comment: There are, of course, defensive midfielders too.\n42:1 Comment: I don't know what we were doing anymore.\n42:3 Comment: We were planning our route, probably to the locker room.\n42:6 Comment: But neither Paredes nor Strodman were seen there.\n42:9 Comment: And all four of the defenders ended up in Vratarsk.\n42:12 Comment: There was no one to take the pick.\n42:17 Comment: Well, I think it’s only luck and plus, of course, the skill of searching that ensures that Roma is fighting a dry group.\n42:26 Comment: Only I said that it seems that the basis is being looked out for.\n42:31 Comment: But this probably doesn't apply to the defensive line.\n42:35 Comment: There still needs to be some kind of unified solution.\n42:39 Comment: Facio, Ivan Jesus and the rest are not without sin.\n42:44 Comment: Here we go again.\n42:46 Comment: Well, look, today there are two goals per player.\n42:49 Comment: Well, it's certainly not very good.\n42:51 Comment: But of course it's not very good.\n42:53 Comment: Well, look, today I played proton iron like concrete for two goals, or even more.\n43:0 Comment: Well, how many chances can we give to such opponents?\n43:5 Comment: And again, everyone, everyone condensed into the same zones, forgetting the players behind them.\n43:11 Comment: We've played the last few episodes.\n43:13 Comment: Here, no pugnacious person would help.\n43:15 Comment: To be honest, I didn't see who was throwing the punch.\n43:17 Comment: But that doesn't matter anymore.\n43:19 Comment: Fact.

    "summary": "AS Roma vs. Crotone: Detailed Match Commentary\n\nAS Roma delivered a dominant display against Crotone, securing a 4-0 victory in a match filled with high-energy performances, thrilling attacks, and commanding play. The game unfolded in a captivating fashion that reflected Roma's attacking prowess and Crotone's struggles to establish themselves in Serie A. \n\n### First Half\n\nAt the onset, Roma showcased their intent with pressing and dynamic play. Salah initiated early sequences, sneaking into the penalty area but opting for a pass rather than a shot from a tight angle. It set the tone for Roma's high tempo and attacking mindset. Totti, pulling the strings from midfield, orchestrated several early chances. Florenzi, known for his versatility and attacking vigour, was also instrumental in his overlapping runs and offensive contributions. \n\nRoma's lineup included key players like Bruno Peres, Kevin Strootman, Edin Dzeko, and Francesco Totti, among others. Peres had a noticeable impact on the left flank with his sequences of feints and crosses. He created opportunities by delivering precise balls into the penalty area, although some came to naught due to rushed touches or narrow misses.\n\nCrotone, on their part, had a defensive lineup geared toward resisting Roma's relentless pressure. Yet, despite setting up a blockade, they found it challenging to interrupt Roma's fluid ball movement and tactical ingenuity. Ferraris and Capece often found themselves involved in critical defensive plays to stem Roma's advances. The defensive discipline from Crotone saw sporadic moments where Roma's potent build-up could have been more effectively converted into goals.\n\nHowever, by the midpoint, Roma's dominance began yielding tangible results. In the 26th minute, Stefan El Shaarawy capitalized on Florenzi's precise ball for a clinical finish, placing Roma ahead. This goal underscored El Shaarawy's sharpness in exploiting defensive gaps and highlighted Florenzi’s accuracy in delivering assists from wide positions.\n\nRoma doubled their advantage in the 37th minute. Salah, having been a consistent threat on the wings, converted a well-placed pass from El Shaarawy. Salah’s position and execution were impeccable, striking the ball powerfully under the crossbar, which left the goalkeeper no chance to react. The first half ended with Roma firmly in control, leading 2-0, despite occasional defensive lapses that allowed Crotone a few notable forays forward.\n\n### Second Half\n\nRoma commenced the second half with undiminished intensity. They retained possession expertly, weaving intricate passing patterns and pushing Crotone deep into their own half. Inside the first few moments, Roma further extended their lead through a brilliant sequence initiated by Francesco Totti. Totti, showcasing his timeless vision and passing range, delivered a magnificent 40-meter ball to Edin Dzeko. Dzeko capitalized on the perfect through ball, clinically finishing to make it 3-0. Totti’s creativity and grasp of space were pivotal, allowing him to engineer chances that kept the opposition defense on tenterhooks.\n\nBruno Peres continued his offensive journeys down the left. His attempts to break through Crotone's defense culminated in drawing fouls and earning set-pieces, enhancing Roma's offensive momentum. Totti, once again at the heart of the action, stood over a free kick, delivering with his characteristic precision, although Crotone managed to put up a more organized defensive response to this threat.\n\nCrotone had moments where they could have altered the scoreline. Falcinelli, one of Crotone’s attacking outlets, almost found success with his penetrating runs and attempts at goal. A noteworthy chance in the second half came when Falcinelli broke through but chose to aim for the near rather than the far post, which resulted in a straightforward save for Szczesny.\n\nRoma's defensive setup, while primarily strong, had lapses. Manolas, known for his defensive acumen and physical presence, had moments where coordination faltered, leading to goal-scoring opportunities for Crotone. Despite this, the core of Roma’s defense — composed of players like Fazio and Juan Jesus — managed to stave off real danger for most of the match.\n\nEdin Dzeko's evening was further brightened when he struck his second goal in the 57th minute. Salah, instrumental in managing the transitions, provided a perfectly weighted pass that found Dzeko in prime position. Dzeko's goal marked his fourth of the season, a statistic reflecting his growing confidence and form as a leading striker.\n\nIn the latter stages, Roma saw substitutions including Juan Jesus and Emerson, which demonstrated the depth of the squad. Bruno Martella's appearance from the bench added fresh legs to the Crotone lineup, though it did little to change the collective imbalance on the field. Crotone’s persistency in seeking a goal led to a penalty, given somewhat controversially. However, Szczesny's brilliance in goal shone through as he saved Paladino's strike, maintaining Roma's clean sheet.\n\nThe midfield, marshaled by Strootman and Paredes, ensured Roma dominated possession and tempo. Paredes’ nick on the ball and accurate distribution were crucial in maintaining the attacking flow. Emerson’s introduction added vigor on the left, demonstrating versatility and readiness to contribute both defensively and offensively.\n\nIn reflection, Roma's tactical discipline, combined with individual brilliance, delivered a well-earned victory. Crotone's defensive frailties and inability to capitalize on key moments spoke of their challenges in adapting to Serie A’s rigorous demands. Roma’s ability to control the game, transition smoothly between defense and attack, and capitalize on scoring opportunities highlighted their quality and experience.\n\nAs the whistle blew, AS Roma secured a resounding 4-0 victory, a testament to their dominance and mastery on the field. The result was an optimal response to their prior defeat against Fiorentina, restoring confidence and forward momentum in their campaign."
