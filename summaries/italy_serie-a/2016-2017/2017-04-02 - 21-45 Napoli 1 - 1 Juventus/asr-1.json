goal.\n8:1 Comment: His sixth goal this season.\n8:3 Comment: For a defensive midfielder, this is more than decent to show.\n8:7 Comment: For a central midfielder...\n8:10 Comment: Now you must agree that Juve mainly plays with a position of strength.\n8:13 Comment: And his supporting hobbacks also spend a lot of time in attack.\n8:18 Comment: And your record.\n8:20 Comment: He beat Turinsky.\n8:22 Comment: Scored five for Juve last season.\n8:24 Comment: And it was his first season in Italy.\n8:26 Comment: It's already six goals.\n8:29 Comment: Serving into the center of the penalty area is absolutely useless in my opinion.\n8:34 Comment: A futile maneuver.\n8:36 Comment: After all, Dries Mertens is one of the shortest football players on the field right now.\n8:41 Comment: But also count on him to win the fight in anucha...\n8:45 Comment: Especially at Filini's...\n8:48 Comment: It's hardly worth it.\n8:50 Comment: Osamo plays touch.\n8:52 Comment: Zhukhusai.\n8:54 Comment: Tears off the opponent.\n8:56 Comment: Useless football in the first minutes.\n8:58 Comment: But no matter how this missed goal broke the Neapolitans.\n9:3 Comment: Let's look again at how it happened.\n9:6 Comment: Here I would first of all express my complaints against Ilyakhon.\n9:10 Comment: An attacking player, but he has the defensive skills of his entire Neapolitan career.\n9:20 Comment: I spent a lot of time, let’s say, in my own half of the field.\n9:24 Comment: He usually helps the defenders and does it well.\n9:27 Comment: But now he didn't make it.\n9:29 Comment: Perhaps this is a consequence of the damage he received a minute earlier before the goal.\n9:33 Comment: Nevertheless, he pulled his leg.\n9:35 Comment: I was in the inactive selection phase.\n9:38 Comment: Service into the penalty area.\n9:40 Comment: Towards the same Kalikhon, towards Filini.\n9:44 Comment: Knocked the ball out while bending over to his death.\n9:47 Comment: Well, by the way, I agree.\n9:49 Comment: We just saw this shot.\n9:51 Comment: The ball did not completely go out of bounds.\n9:54 Comment: And Ilya Steiner showed it.\n9:56 Comment: He deliberately did not touch the ball, inviting the orbit to come up and take a look.\n10:2 Comment: I remind you that the ball, its projection must be completely outside the field.\n10:8 Comment: To have a reason to blow the whistle.\n10:10 Comment: And yet, a corner. The first goal of Bufon.\n10:14 Comment: Service from Calihon. Bufon.\n10:17 Comment: Inconsistency with Mandzukic.\n10:19 Comment: And yet, some danger has passed.\n10:24 Comment: Juventus have been exceptionally good in the last ten rounds of the Italian championship.\n10:31 Comment: There was a defeat in January against Ferentina.\n10:35 Comment: And after that, a luxurious series, ten matches, win-win.\n10:40 Comment: Nine wins and only one draw with Dineska.\n10:44 Comment: Sometimes things go wrong.\n10:47 Comment: We beat India, we beat Latsu, we beat Milan.\n10:52 Comment: And during this entire period, Juventus’s armored defense conceded only three draws.\n10:57 Comment: Here the combination also breaks down, inaccuracy.\n10:59 Comment: And Oan himself plays bravely, inside the penalty area itself.\n11:4 Comment: But Kievini was no longer here before the elections.\n11:7 Comment: He knocks the ball out.\n11:8 Comment: Napole keeps his opponent captive on the field.\n11:12 Comment: But I wouldn't call it pressure from Juventus.\n11:15 Comment: On their third field, even the whole team condensed.\n11:21 Comment: I just defended myself positionally.\n11:23 Comment: Albeoli on Georgina.\n11:26 Comment: Kyusai.\n11:28 Comment: Albeoli.\n11:29 Comment: Gamshin sees three draws.\n11:32 Comment: Transfer to him.\n11:33 Comment: It's true that Yingsign interfered with the game here.\n11:36 Comment: It seems to me that this transmission suited him.\n11:39 Comment: Feed from Strinich.\n11:41 Comment: I'll repeat it again.\n11:42 Comment: During innings like this, Kalijo should probably play a big role.\n11:48 Comment: But he's still taller.\n11:50 Comment: Kipryguch visited him from Anapa.\n11:52 Comment: He scored with his head.\n11:53 Comment: So he can narrow the space in attack.\n11:58 Comment: Move on such pitches.\n11:59 Comment: Insinya.\n12:1 Comment: I worked with the ball carefully.\n12:2 Comment: But Marek Hamsik is on the selection list.\n12:4 Comment: Gamshik's role as a leader is very important.\n12:7 Comment: Day mastermind.\n12:9 Comment: Now in this part of the game.\n12:11 Comment: He must lead the team.\n12:13 Comment: Allen.\n12:15 Comment: Pauses.\n12:17 Comment: There are a lot of players in blue around.\n12:20 Comment: We still have to find it.\n12:21 Comment: Space is free.\n12:22 Comment: Look.\n12:23 Comment: Three football players around Yinsign.\n12:25 Comment: One more serve.\n12:26 Comment: But again.\n12:27 Comment: Even if it were accurate.\n12:29 Comment: I doubt Merton could put up a fight.\n12:32 Comment: Although during the course of this fantastic series in the outer season.\n12:37 Comment: The season when Merton scored in droves.\n12:39 Comment: He keeps doing it.\n12:41 Comment: There were instances where he played quite hard.\n12:44 Comment: Putting up the body.\n12:46 Comment: And his opponents flew away from him.\n12:48 Comment: It all depends on how you stand on your feet.\n12:50 Comment: Higuain.\n12:51 Comment: And then there's the whistle.\n12:55 Comment: But we'll wait.\n12:56 Comment: We'll probably wait until Gonzalo Higuain\n12:59 Comment: will meet the ball for a more or less long period.\n13:4 Comment:  And then.\n13:7 Comment: Then I will not envy our sound engineer Tatyana.\n13:11 Comment: Although she doesn't know Italian.\n13:13 Comment: It's unlikely that all that swearing will be heard.\n13:17 Comment: All this dirty speech that will flow from the podium.\n13:20 Comment: To Gonzalo Higuain.\n13:23 Comment: Well, in general, there will still be time.\n13:24 Comment: I'll be sure to tell you what I'm doing.\n13:26 Comment: Well, in general, there will still be time.\n13:28 Comment: I will definitely tell you all the twists and turns of this story.\n13:32 Comment: The most important thing is that Gonzalo Higuain plays against Napoli for the first time in Naples.\n13:37 Comment: Before this there were two matches.\n13:40 Comment: Kobrov, by the way, scored against Naples.\n13:42 Comment: But these were Tuina matches.\n13:43 Comment: Another corner.\n13:45 Comment: Strinch with his active work on the flank.\n13:48 Comment: He earns it.\n13:50 Comment: Kalihon. And Strinch is nearby.\n13:52 Comment: Calihon crosses to the far post.\n13:54 Comment: Khulebali.\n13:56 Comment: Jumped on Bufon.\n13:58 Comment: Gigi doesn't argue.\n14:0 Comment: It looks like there was an attack on the goalkeeper.\n14:4 Comment:  And that is all.\n14:10 Comment: I already said that today there are exclusively Neapolitan fans in the stands.\n14:17 Comment: No, maybe there are some latent fans present.\n14:24 Comment: They don't hide.\n14:26 Comment: Nevertheless, the Naples authorities banned Juventus fans from attending this game.\n14:30 Comment: And the cup match will be very soon.\n14:32 Comment: In a few days there will be a return game here between these teams.\n14:36 Comment: All this is due to security reasons.\n14:39 Comment: More precisely, mercy.\n14:41 Comment: For the ecstatic Naples fan, anyone in black and white today.\n14:46 Comment: This is Higuain's projection.\n14:48 Comment: Here he is with the ball.\n14:49 Comment: Goncal Higuain clings to the ball.\n14:51 Comment: Puts up the body.\n14:52 Comment: Hysai is pushing.\n14:53 Comment: Higuain beats the Albanian.\n14:55 Comment: Higuain is already in the penalty pass.\n14:57 Comment: And they kicked.\n15:0 Comment: Here again, my action did not agree with Rafael Cabral.\n15:5 Comment: Today he replaces Pepe Reina in the main post.\n15:10 Comment: Who has health problems.\n15:12 Comment: The main goalkeeper of the Neapolitans.\n15:16 Comment: Can't help the team.\n15:17 Comment: Higuain is good.\n15:18 Comment: He played it handily.\n15:20 Comment: Original along.\n15:23 Comment: On the goal line.\n15:25 Comment: Well, he made an aggravating pass.\n15:28 Comment: Pianich.\n15:30 Comment: Duistic.\n15:31 Comment: Suttle.\n15:34 Comment: It's the same principle again.\n15:35 Comment: The main thing is that the ball touches the line.\n15:37 Comment: It is not necessary to be completely in this zone.\n15:42 Comment: Marquisio.\n15:44 Comment: Service from Claudio Albiol.\n15:46 Comment: That's a roundhouse kick from Kellyni.\n15:49 Comment: Everything is correct.\n15:50 Comment: He did everything absolutely right.\n15:51 Comment: The main thing for a defender in such situations is not to cut.\n15:54 Comment: And it doesn’t matter how he completes the attack with a curved blow, a half-cross, or a half-cross.\n16:0 Comment: The main thing is that there is no contract.\n16:4 Comment: Dries Mertens.\n16:5 Comment: Napoli's top scorer on your screens.\n16:10 Comment: In his first three seasons in Italy, he scored 22 league goals.\n16:15 Comment: Now, just for this season, he already has 20.\n16:19 Comment: You can imagine how he has blossomed as a centre-forward.\n16:23 Comment: The man who played on the wing for 29 years.\n16:28 Comment: These are the perturbations.\n16:35 Comment: Such an explosion of performance.\n16:37 Comment: Although he once played for PSV, he also scored 21 in one season.\n16:43 Comment: Guvianthus is trying to get out of defense.\n16:45 Comment: Lichsteiner.\n16:46 Comment: Yellow walks with his left foot, without looking to launch the ball into the middle zone.\n16:50 Comment: Here the selection is for Naples.\n16:52 Comment: Georges Nyo.\n16:53 Comment: Insigne doesn't play touch.\n16:54 Comment:  It is important.\n16:55 Comment: This is a very important technique.\n16:56 Comment: When there is such density, or rather, I get the rigidity of the penalty area, I need to try to get by with one touch more often.\n17:7 Comment: Higuain.\n17:8 Comment: You understand everything.\n17:11 Comment: Lichsteiner connects.\n17:16 Comment: And it takes a long time to get back.\n17:18 Comment: If we continue the topic of absentees, then, of course, we must say that Paulo Debau is not playing in today's lineup.\n17:28 Comment: He’s on the bench, I must say right away.\n17:30 Comment: But Maximilian Olegovich said at the pre-match press conference that Debau returned from the Argentina national team not in the best condition, not in a nightmare, not in a terrible state.\n17:39 Comment: But this form can’t be called good either.\n17:41 Comment: Insigne.\n17:46 Comment: Swing feints.\n17:47 Comment: This is also his uterus.\n17:52 Comment: Again with the ball.\n17:54 Comment: Low center of gravity.\n17:57 Comment:  Quick legs.\n17:59 Comment: But again there is not enough space to run around.\n18:2 Comment: Ganshik.\n18:3 Comment: Handled a difficult ball.\n18:4 Comment: Feed.\n18:6 Comment: Ilinia.\n18:8 Comment: Imagines the back of his head, which is rapidly balding.\n18:12 Comment:  A gun.\n18:16 Comment: She may be balding, but she’s still as reliable as ever.\n18:21 Comment: Insigne.\n18:23 Comment: Here, on the left edge, such a triangle has formed, already a square.\n18:27 Comment: Zhirinyev and Ganshik are also here.\n18:28 Comment: Gallans.\n18:29 Comment: Strinich.\n18:30 Comment: Insigne.\n18:31 Comment: The ball is moving.\n18:32 Comment: Alan had a tough fight with Hidira.\n18:35 Comment: Galihot.\n18:36 Comment: Na fusai.\n18:38 Comment: All field players are in Juventus' half.\n18:40 Comment: Strinich.\n18:42 Comment: Strinic's appearance in the main lineup is also somewhat of a surprise.\n18:46 Comment: After all, the main left-back is Maracan Fauzi Ghulam.\n18:50 Comment: He's on the bench today with bass attacks.\n18:54 Comment: Well, if you probably close the system\n18:57 Comment: absent, injured,\n18:59 Comment: Of course, it's a shame about the opiate\n19:2 Comment: Talented Horvat, who has already played out in Juventus.\n19:6 Comment: His damage, crosses.\n19:9 Comment:  Serious injury.\n19:10 Comment: And this hurts Juventus' prospects even as champions, in my opinion.\n19:15 Comment: Kipiatsia came out very well on the note.\n19:18 Comment: Alan.\n19:20 Comment: Alber.\n19:24 Comment:  Error.\n19:26 Comment: Interception from Martizio.\n19:28 Comment: And Juventus is already playing his game called Anu Kapin.\n19:33 Comment: Accepts Naples' challenge and puts pressure on the opponent\n19:36 Comment: The most obverse. Error!\n19:38 Comment: Attention! Alan is with the ball.\n19:40 Comment: Selects the recipient.\n19:42 Comment: Discount. Strike!\n19:44 Comment: And Mark Hamshik doesn’t get this shot.\n19:47 Comment: Not even a corner earned.\n19:53 Comment: Well, this is probably the most poignant moment near the Bufon gate.\n19:57 Comment: This same pressure worked.\n19:59 Comment: Alan waited a little.\n20:1 Comment: Waited for Mertens to open.\n20:3 Comment: He makes absolutely the right decision.\n20:5 Comment: Throwing the ball at Hamsik because Hamsik was facing the goal.\n20:8 Comment: It was an awkward position.\n20:11 Comment: Well, and Mark Kovyrnuk.\n20:13 Comment: What to hide.\n20:20 Comment: Alber.\n20:22 Comment: Let's go, let's go game.\n20:24 Comment: And we remember that in the first minute after the holo-missed the public\n20:27 Comment: the same Neapolitan, hot, exortic\n20:30 Comment: She became quiet and quiet.\n20:32 Comment: But now it seems like you can hear it again.\n20:34 Comment: Serve!\n20:35 Comment: And this is how you have to play to Elina.\n20:37 Comment: This is probably a rare case when a pass is sent into the penalty area for Juventus\n20:40 Comment: can be effective.\n20:43 Comment: When an attacking player is allowed to avoid being caught offside,\n20:46 Comment: And he runs behind the opponent's back.\n20:51 Comment: He doesn't lead here.\n20:53 Comment: It's a straight martial arts day.\n20:55 Comment: And this is very important.\n20:57 Comment: He's trying to jump up his opponent positionally.\n20:59 Comment: Another corner.\n21:0 Comment: Enough Neapolitans in the first half of the first half.\n21:5 Comment: Fourth try.\n21:6 Comment: Strinich.\n21:7 Comment: Uli-bali.\n21:8 Comment:  AND...\n21:9 Comment:  So like this.\n21:10 Comment: It’s not for nothing that Diego Armando Maradonna once said in an interview,\n21:14 Comment: what's in his team, that is, in that very champion Naples\n21:18 Comment: in the 80s, in a Mercedes,\n21:24 Comment: Mertens could have played in the 80s.\n21:34 Comment: Then he also proved that...\n21:39 Comment: proved that this touch did not exist.\n21:42 Comment: Surprised face.\n21:44 Comment:  Anyway.\n21:46 Comment: Anyway, we see\n21:48 Comment: this positional attack of the Neapolitans,\n21:50 Comment: let it be with innings,\n21:52 Comment: but no spicy...\n21:56 Comment: allows you to create.\n21:58 Comment: This is where Allan breaks the rules.\n22:0 Comment: He butted heads with Pyanich for a long time.\n22:2 Comment: And already in the skate he played dangerously.\n22:15 Comment: I mentioned\n22:17 Comment: Napole in the times of Diego Maradona.\n22:20 Comment: And it is with him that the main successes of the Neapolitans are connected\n22:23 Comment: in the Italian championship, the championship of 1987 and 90.\n22:28 Comment: After that it was cut off.\n22:30 Comment:  On the other side,\n22:32 Comment: We sometimes criticize the Neapolitans for this,\n22:36 Comment: what do they rent out in the second part of the seasons\n22:39 Comment: and they can’t manage a full-fledged

And that's it. A dangerous situation is immediately created.\n31:17 Comment: Well, Mandzukic is good here. He folds. Iglain doesn't have time.\n31:20 Comment: And here he is.\n31:21 Comment: By the way, there are few fouls. Still, Ursat blows the whistle.\n31:27 Comment: This is, of course, for the benefit of the Game.\n31:30 Comment: But this is not so much Ursatu’s achievement here, it seems to me that this is just the way football is played here.\n31:37 Comment: Here you don’t need to hit your legs much.\n31:41 Comment: Although there are enough emotions. Allan. Mandzhik.\n31:45 Comment: And here he is.\n31:46 Comment: Here's a strinich.\n31:48 Comment: This strinich is probably the least sophisticated in terms of combinations, in my opinion.\n31:52 Comment: Here is a football player who likes to serve from the wing.\n31:55 Comment: That's how Gamshik is here.\n31:58 Comment: And they perform strinich from the left edge.\n32:2 Comment: But under such football, of course, you or Acadio Shamilikov, who has already recovered, will fall.\n32:9 Comment: Well, that's all here, of course.\n32:11 Comment: But you or Acadio Shamilikov, who has already recovered, fall down.\n32:16 Comment: Allan.\n32:19 Comment: Hysai.\n32:21 Comment: Nowhere.\n32:23 Comment: All bets are covered there.\n32:27 Comment: And there's not even a crack.\n32:30 Comment: Marquisio.\n32:32 Comment: Almost losing balance, the team still retains the ball.\n32:36 Comment: And he himself is also extremely calm in his control.\n32:40 Comment: Timchat.\n32:43 Comment: Mertens, Mertens, Mertens!\n32:46 Comment: The football players call it the entrance.\n32:49 Comment: He eats up his opponent when he doesn't handle the ball very well.\n32:56 Comment: Mertens switches on his quick feet and forces a thrilling ball to be lost.\n33:1 Comment: 34th minute of the game.\n33:3 Comment: Napoleo and Juventus. The central game of the 30th round.\n33:5 Comment: Let me remind you that Napoleo's lead over Juve is 10 points.\n33:11 Comment: And yet in Italy they are waiting for the moment when Juventus misfires.\n33:16 Comment: They expect that they want at least some intrigue.\n33:19 Comment: Mertens! Strike position!\n33:22 Comment: But the backhand didn't work.\n33:24 Comment: I did everything right, I beat my opponent from a distance.\n33:28 Comment: I just didn't have time to cover it.\n33:30 Comment: It was my opinion Kaylini.\n33:32 Comment: Look, he's passing between the lines.\n33:35 Comment: Irina's critics really turned her back.\n33:37 Comment: And no one has met me. Come on, I don’t want to.\n33:40 Comment: This is a scoring chance.\n33:42 Comment: The blow didn't work.\n33:47 Comment: Good. Dries Mertens is good after all.\n33:50 Comment: Even in the worst match, Napoleo creates something.\n33:57 Comment: By the way, there is fresh transfer football here.\n34:0 Comment: Manchester United are allegedly targeting Mertens.\n34:2 Comment: I invested his salary for about 5 million.\n34:5 Comment: Although up to lower ratings, the head of Napoleo can pay a maximum of 3.\n34:8 Comment: Although I think he’ll fork out in the end.\n34:10 Comment: Well, these scenes even indicate the chances that Mertens will leave the team.\n34:16 Comment: 80 percent, imagine.\n34:19 Comment: A player like this needs to be preserved.\n34:21 Comment: Hansek strikes again.\n34:23 Comment: But again it was too thick there.\n34:25 Comment: The ball got stuck in this thicket.\n34:27 Comment: Pjanich is wrong.\n34:29 Comment: Today Pjanic is positioned as a trequartist in the attack group.\n34:37 Comment:  Probably so.\n34:39 Comment: In general, we remember that in Roma, and in the Bosnian national team, Herzogovin and Pjanic acted only from deep.\n34:44 Comment: He loves to do this.\n34:46 Comment: Excellent long broadcasts and requests.\n34:49 Comment: But with the arrival of Juventus, its new functionality appeared.\n34:53 Comment: Oleg sees him much closer to the attack.\n34:58 Comment: Kulebolitis.\n35:0 Comment: A star rocket flashes onto Hanshek.\n35:3 Comment: But for now there is a penalty area in the distance.\n35:5 Comment: Strinich.\n35:7 Comment: Legsteiner is against him.\n35:9 Comment: Strinich on the shadow.\n35:11 Comment: The ball is moving.\n35:13 Comment:  More.\n35:15 Comment: In one or two touches.\n35:17 Comment: This is pinball.\n35:19 Comment: The ball comes back in the pensin.\n35:22 Comment: To serve.\n35:24 Comment: But he lets me in.\n35:25 Comment: You know, just recently I was surprised by the result of the cup match.\n35:29 Comment: Let me remind you that the team has already played the first and one or two finals of the Italian Cup.\n35:34 Comment: And there Juventus' victory was held by Saszek Triodi.\n35:38 Comment: And Jodi was successful with set pieces and in the fight.\n35:41 Comment: Neither Mertens nor Insigne, who are one and a half meters high, took the corner kicks.\n35:48 Comment: Strinic served at 186.\n35:51 Comment: And Mertens and Insigne were inside the goalkeeper’s area, not even in the penalty area.\n35:55 Comment: What could be done with such height against Grin, in my opinion, the best wrestler?\n36:1 Comment: I didn’t understand. I even turned to Oleg Kombe for advice.\n36:5 Comment: To our famous courtyard famous coach, who is crushing Krasnodar.\n36:10 Comment: He was also surprised, although he is a fan of Sarri's talent.\n36:14 Comment: But he assumed that they should just create movements there.\n36:18 Comment: Here's one of those moving Lorenzo and Incine getting a yellow card.\n36:22 Comment: For some more expressions.\n36:28 Comment: He turns on his sharp tongue.\n36:31 Comment: He often gets warnings for talking.\n36:35 Comment: This match is no exception. Incine.\n36:39 Comment: Ganshi, Georgini. 37 minutes are over.\n36:42 Comment: Okay, just a second. Time passes quickly.\n36:45 Comment: Believe me, who, who, Lorenzo and Insigne have the right to such attempts.\n36:50 Comment: It's not so much about the accuracy of the strike, but about the distance.\n36:53 Comment: Remember, for example, his goal in Harentin.\n36:57 Comment: Roughly from this position.\n36:59 Comment: But it's Lorenzo.\n37:2 Comment: Napole, who strangled him a little, it seems to me, why in vain, Mauritsa Sarri.\n37:7 Comment: After the first match with Real Madrid, lost with a score of 1-3.\n37:10 Comment: Told me he couldn't play football.\n37:12 Comment: Lost with a score of 1-3.\n37:14 Comment: Criticized Sarri's tactics instead of supporting them.\n37:19 Comment: After all, we remember that in the second match Naples were low.\n37:23 Comment: In the first half we led 1-0.\n37:25 Comment: Then Sergio Ramos.\n37:28 Comment: I said my word.\n37:30 Comment: Gansch meets the ball.

G. Bufon is one of the great football players,\n39:10 Comment: who didn't win the Champions League.\n39:14 Comment: But there is still time to eliminate this shortcoming.\n39:19 Comment: The game with Barcelona is ahead.\n39:21 Comment: I'll remind you of this again.\n39:23 Comment: Alla Istova fights in the middle of the field, accelerating the attack.\n39:26 Comment: This is the diagonal.\n39:28

most talented football players\n40:13 Comment: the new Italian generation.\n40:15 Comment: But he didn't hit his own goal.\n40:17 Comment: It’s clear, this was also an attempt to hit a long shot with a passing shot.\n40:20 Comment: Napole has this moment.\n40:22 Comment: Incinia has a moment, Hamsik has a moment, Mertens has a moment.\n40:26 Comment: One more serve.\n40:28 Comment:

episode.\n42:19 Comment: Filinina Bufona.\n42:21 Comment: 43rd minute.\n42:24 Comment: We see that Naples did not have enough strength\n42:27 Comment: actively put pressure on the opponent.\n42:29 Comment: But, on the other hand, you need to put pressure,\n42:31 Comment: if the opponent has the ball.\n42:33 Comment: We see that Juventus doesn't really need this ball.\n42:35 Comment: Even he doesn't have the strength.\n42:37 Comment: And, of course, at Wanchzhuk's,\n42:39 Comment: He has no strength.\n42:40 Comment: And, of course, Wanchjuk doesn’t really need this ball.\n42:42 Comment: Even in games with much lower status opponents\n42:44 Comment: Sometimes Juve gives up the ball.\n42:46 Comment: He is comfortable playing on the counter-attack.\n42:49 Comment: Mertens.\n42:51

flying for a very long time,\n43:32 Comment: and let him catch it.\n43:35 Comment: But Gigi is the easiest option here.\n43:38 Comment: But this is again experience.\n43:40 Comment: When it's the end

Comment: It's two hundred to Gamshik.\n44:3 Comment: Blue.\n44:5 Comment: However, he plays enough.\n44:6 Comment: Nevertheless, we will act under Hamsik's style.\n44:12 Comment: And this happens to a

I only remember the pass by Hysaj\n1:1 Comment: I earned the chapter, nothing more.\n1:4 Comment: But there is no feeling that Higuain is somehow overly worried, nervous, etc.\n1:11 Comment: I’ll introduce Daniel Orsatu once again, the chief referee, assistants Defiore, Manganelli, Dmitry Shnekin, microphone, Napoleon, of course, sweeps away\n1:19 Comment: Hysai\n1:21 Comment: Looking

But today at the core\n2:34 Comment: And, to be honest, so far, I probably haven’t shown myself in any way in the attack.\n2:40 Comment: But it works in defense\n2:41 Comment: Here he stuck his iron chin into the back of Califon Kirini's head\n2:50 Comment: Kirini everything is iron\n2:53 Comment: In principle, dealing with him is unpleasant\n2:58 Comment: Boolean\n3:2 Comment: Near Hamshik\n3:3

viscous approach\n3:17 Comment: And Mark Hamshik’s transmission is not accurate\n3:20 Comment: He has his own statistical points up and up\n3:23 Comment: He also has\n3:28 Comment: Interesting indicators\n3:30 Comment: He currently has\n3:32 Comment: Mark Hamsik for Napoleon\n3:35 Comment: Quite a few goals scored\n3:37 Comment: More precisely 110 in all tournaments\n3:40 Comment: And up to

Comment: Performed by Dries Mertens\n4:48 Comment: You can imagine how he handled\n4:50 Comment: It worked, or rather, Gamshik\n4:52 Comment: On the right edge is Kalihon\n4:54 Comment: Far post delivery\n4:55 Comment: Insinia is lonely there\n4:57 Comment: Against him is Licksteiner, hiding his hands\n4:59 Comment: Incinia!\n5:1 Comment: Here it is, his signature move\n5:3 Comment: And past the gate once again\n5:5 Comment: In this game Incinia gets rid of\n5:8 Comment: From the guardianship of defenders\n5:10 Comment: But he can’t hit the target\n5:13 Comment: On the! This is the fly swatter\n5:17 Comment: It was played cleanly\n5:19 Comment: Albeit at risk to Higuain's health\n5:21 Comment: How did Mertens work?\n5:23 Comment: Moreover, he not only took the ball\n5:25 Comment: He was also the first to run to the opponent's goal\n5:27 Comment: This is a completely different mood\n5:29 Comment: There were few such episodes in the first half\n5:31 Comment: Emotionally, of course, you need\n5:33 Comment: Naples to add\n5:35 Comment: What kind of nerves and emotions were there?\n5:37 Comment: Blood, sweat, snot, tears\n5:39 Comment: In the first half of the game with Real Madrid\n5:41 Comment: How they pushed\n5:43 Comment: And that's how he got up\n5:49 Comment: Forgetting about defense, about your goal\n5:51 Comment: And they achieved their goal\n5:53 Comment: But mentally in the second half they, of course, gave up\n5:55 Comment: They didn’t understand that a second goal against Real Madrid was enough\n5:58 Comment: And expect to score against Real Madrid\n6:0 Comment: And don’t miss it\n6:2 Comment: Well, this is for Naples with its defense\n6:7 Comment: Rotten plan\n6:9 Comment: Well, until the injury takes you, of course, to the capital\n6:13 Comment: Or rather, to the strongest\n6:15 Comment: Well, until the injury takes you, of course, to the strongest\n6:17 Comment: Stories, simpler stories on the theme of Higuain\n6:21 Comment: Why not now\n6:23 Comment: Here's to remember\n6:25 Comment: Well, for those who don't know\n6:27 Comment: Goncal Higuain joined from Real Madrid in 2013\n6:29 Comment: In Naples for 37 million euros\n6:33 Comment: In the end, he played 146 matches\n6:35 Comment: And scored 91 goals\n6:37 Comment: Amazing performance\n6:39 Comment: Became Serie A record holder\n6:41 Comment: Having scored those same 36 goals\n6:43 Comment: Took the cup, Italian Super Cup\n6:45 Comment: Moreover, the Italian Super Cup\n6:47 Comment: They brought it to Juventus\n6:49 Comment: Well\n6:53 Comment: Already, probably, all sorts of sports media\n6:55 Comment: The story went around that\n6:57 Comment: Juventus hired more\n6:59 Comment: Bodyguards at the hotel\n7:1 Comment: Where is the team located?\n7:3 Comment: Just right for Higuain\n7:5 Comment: For the rest of the team\n7:7 Comment: Anything happened here when Juventus came\n7:9 Comment: In 2013, for example, they threw stones at\n7:11 Comment: Something else\n7:13 Comment: Bus\n7:15 Comment: In particular, the glass itself got\n7:17 Comment: His head was completely broken\n7:19 Comment: Window on the bus\n7:21 Comment: So\n7:23 Comment: This measure was not superfluous\n7:25 Comment: And the hotel where Juventus resides\n7:27 Comment: It's closed\n7:29 Comment: But still, of course, nearby\n7:31 Comment: They make noise\n7:33 Comment: Trying to unbalance\n7:35 Comment: Error\n7:37 Comment: Meffins worked again\n7:39 Comment: Again he forced, in this case, Lichsteiner\n7:41 Comment: Lose the ball\n7:43 Comment: Strinnich\n7:45 Comment: Convenient pass for Jorginho\n7:47 Comment: Caresses the ball with such mini-football movements\n7:49 Comment: Works with the sole a lot\n7:51 Comment: Jorginho on Strinnica\n7:53 Comment: Blue\n7:55 Comment: Cast to Gamshik\n7:57 Comment: Gamshik managed to look back\n7:59 Comment: And there he was already flying at full speed\n8:1 Comment: This terrible Kielin\n8:3 Comment: Football, scary\n8:5 Comment: Gamshik\n8:7 Comment: Killed\n8:9 Comment: toy\n8:15 Comment: Allan\n8:19 Comment: Well, it was possible to break through Allan\n8:21 Comment: It's already too late\n8:23 Comment: He plays the short Scalliehon\n8:25 Comment: In general, it’s surprising that Allan scored quite a few goals for Udinese\n8:27 Comment: He has a set shot\n8:29 Comment: From a distant, middle position\n8:31 Comment: But this season\n8:33 Comment: He never scored\n8:35 Comment: Although, in a team like Napoli\n8:37 Comment: Not scoring at all in 30 games\n8:39 Comment: Of course, you have to try\n8:41 Comment: Jorginho's throw\n8:43 Comment: Streaming\n8:49 Comment: Incini\n8:50 Comment: Again he tries to feint, but immediately gets stuck\n8:54 Comment:

trying\n9:5 Comment: Play\n9:6 Comment: Keep it silent\n9:7 Comment: The Neapolitans are under attack\n9:10 Comment: Probably increase the speed a little\n9:12 Comment: Movements and transfers\n9:16 Comment: And losses\n9:18 Comment: Here's the story\n9:20 Comment: But still\n9:22 Comment: So far these attempts\n9:24 Comment: I personally like Napoleon better\n9:26 Comment: Than what we saw before the break\n9:28 Comment: The stands turn on\n9:31 Comment: Well, we found someone to criticize\n9:35 Comment: Claims against Bufon, who replaced the ball\n9:37 Comment: As far as I understand\n9:38 Comment: And so they pumped it up\n9:40 Comment: Here in general\n9:46 Comment: Also a funny story\n9:49 Comment: Many people have told me about her\n9:50 Comment: Toilet paper is sold in the city\n9:54 Comment: With a photo of whom?\n9:56 Comment: Of course, Goncal Higuain\n9:57 Comment: Well, you know, it seems to me\n9:59 Comment: Toilet paper with a photo of Higuain\n10:1 Comment: Is it dangerous\n10:2 Comment: She can score\n10:4 Comment: From a precision pipe, for example\n10:6 Comment: Ganshin\n10:7 Comment: On blue\n10:8 Comment: Look again\n10:10 Comment: Look again, almost from the position of left back he begins his actions in attack.\n10:18 Comment: The cast was inaccurate.\n10:20 Comment: At the same time, Strinich is initially closer to the goal than Ensi.\n10:27 Comment: Well, I don't know how effective this can be.\n10:29 Comment: Still, it takes Lorenzo’s strength to, say, reach the goal from such a deep position.\n10:38 Comment: Albiol.\n10:40 Comment: And Olga with the first pass.\n10:42 Comment: Slightly higher than in Bali.\n10:43 Comment: And we see this clearly.\n10:45 Comment: Gamshik.\n10:46 Comment: Hit.\n10:47 Comment: Finishing off.\n10:48 Comment: Goal.\n10:49 Comment: Which is scored from offside and will not be defended.\n10:55 Comment: Oh, I wanted fire.\n10:57 Comment: I won’t say that Naples really deserved this goal.\n11:1 Comment: But the second half is turning out well so far.\n11:4 Comment: Well, of course, there is a two-meter offside here.\n11:7 Comment: The defenders played great, by the way.\n11:9 Comment: Veneduo.\n11:10 Comment: If you didn't see on the replay, almost the entire defensive line took a step towards the passer.\n11:17 Comment: More precisely, the batter, right?\n11:19 Comment: That is, thereby driving Kalikhon into offside.\n11:26 Comment: But in any case, this is an impulse, this is a surge of emotions that the Neapolitan club should pick up.\n11:39 Comment: Gamshik.\n11:40 Comment: Faster, faster we need to turn around.\n11:43 Comment: Lead from flank to flank.\n11:46 Comment: Of course, at the speed Napolé is showing now, the Juventus defense is comfortable.\n11:54 Comment: Well, we see more blows, right?\n11:56 Comment: A blow was struck.\n11:57 Comment: Bufon, by the way, right?\n11:59 Comment: He didn't play well, hitting the ball in front of him.\n12:1 Comment: Yes, there was an offside, but if it had not been there, if the referee had made a mistake.\n12:8 Comment: Everything suggests that, probably,\n12:10 Comment: It’s worth applying more often from afar.\n12:12 Comment: So far, he hasn’t exactly succeeded in this, but Insi was often marked by such a blow.\n12:18 Comment: All.\n12:19 Comment: Where is Gamshik?\n12:21 Comment: Where is Allan?\n12:25 Comment: Yes, the same Kalikhon.\n12:27 Comment: Oh, what a tackle from Khidira.\n12:30 Comment: He immediately moves to the right edge, but does not do it accurately.\n12:34 Comment: Here Liminan could not make it in time.\n12:37 Comment: Barzali.\n12:38 Comment: It's experienced, closet-like, in a good way.\n12:43 Comment: Amazing physique.\n12:46 Comment: Power.\n12:47 Comment: He's warming up, but I think it's just in the plans.\n12:51 Comment: Warm up.\n12:53 Comment: According to the rules, three football players can be located in the warm-up area.\n12:56 Comment: By the way, we also see Quadrada there.\n12:58 Comment: By the way, it seems to me that the replacement, the entry of Quadrad instead of Limin,\n13:2 Comment: this is quite predictable,\n13:8 Comment: This is a direct move by Maximilian Orega.\n13:10 Comment: He is generally famous for his rather late substitutions.\n13:13 Comment: From about the 70th minute they start releasing fresh players.\n13:17 Comment: And here on his bench, ugh, guys, Benatia, Sandro, Barzali,\n13:25 Comment: Dani Aulis, Daniel Rugani, who just played for the Italian national team,\n13:30 Comment: Stefano Sturaro, Tomas Rincón, friend of the Venezuelan team,\n13:36 Comment: talented Mandrake,\n13:38 Comment: Quadrada, the main player of the Colombian national team, well, in my opinion, she will generally be enough for a point.\n13:43 Comment: Mertens! Mertens! Strike position!\n13:46 Comment: It hits the opponent's buttocks, nothing more.\n13:51 Comment: But it springs back so much that the ball comes back to us.\n13:56 Comment: Bite! Bite! Slightly less noticeable in the second half.\n14:0 Comment: Until the break Mertens! Mertens!\n14:3 Comment: Even the corner didn’t work, in my opinion, or...\n14:8 Comment: I was just deciding.\n14:10 Comment: Mertens, of course, leads by example. Well, you see, we've sorted it out.\n14:16 Comment: Quadrada, I think, cannot replace other options here.\n14:21 Comment: Cominant.\n14:29 Comment: Gavshik, Insiniem.\n14:34 Comment: Georgini, here it is, touch, here it is, a game of touch!\n14:37 Comment: Go!\n14:38 Comment: Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!\n14:41 Comment: Mare Hamshik!\n14:43 Comment: Finally!\n14:44 Comment: They should have not hesitated, they should have designed their combination with touch passes.\n14:51 Comment: And here he is naked!\n14:52 Comment: And you must admit how similar this is to what Juventus invented at the beginning of the game.\n14:59 Comment: This is also a game against the wall, as far as I understand.\n15:4 Comment: Let's see how it was.\n15:6 Comment: Here it is, Insinium.\n15:7 Comment: Leader!\n15:8 Comment: And Hamshik was not caught offside.\n15:12 Comment: Shot perfectly.\n15:13 Comment: He didn’t get closer, didn’t try to invent anything, just shot over Bufon.\n15:18 Comment: Yes, the pass is performed not by Insigno, but by Mertens.\n15:22 Comment: Listen.\n15:24 Comment: Gavrii!\n15:37 Comment: Stop him before he falls unconscious.\n15:47 Comment: This is Decibel Bellini, one of the most famous heralds in world football.\n15:53 Comment: That's how he strains himself, that's how he yells.\n15:55 Comment: It would seem that just recently he excited the stands with the cry of “Gonzalo!”\n16:2 Comment: Higuain.\n16:3 Comment: Well, now Maryganshik scores a goal.\n16:6 Comment: Well, it does it nicely, but what was the combination?\n16:9 Comment: In fact, there would be one more repetition.\n16:12 Comment: Watch how it developed from the very beginning, and so does this.\n16:17 Comment: But we passed. 1-1.\n16:19 Comment: Marchisio Jurentus picks the ball.\n16:21 Comment: Well, many expected, to be honest, that both teams would score in this match anyway.\n16:27 Comment: Because the attacking potential is, of course, fantastic.\n16:30 Comment: What some have, what others have.\n16:31 Comment: Somehow he doesn’t play defensively.\n16:34 Comment: But in my own style now.\n16:36 Comment: Now he scored on the field.\n16:38 Comment: Fast.\n16:39 Comment: Touch.\n16:41 Comment: After all, Ganshik also hit the ball.\n16:44 Comment: Oh, the bootie.\n16:46 Comment: Both balls turned out just right.\n16:49 Comment: Raoul Albiol.\n16:51 Comment: Well, now the mood is completely different.\n16:53 Comment: We can say that the commands have been reset.\n16:56 Comment: We returned to what it was at the very beginning.\n16:59 Comment: But now, probably, there is still a slight superiority in psychological terms.\n17:6 Comment: But, of course, the Neopolitans.\n17:7 Comment: They have the ball, they create chances, they scored in the second half.\n17:11 Comment: They need, of course, to use this inertia.\n17:15 Comment: Drunk.\n17:16 Comment: That's how deep he sank.\n17:17 Comment: Marchisio Hidiro on fire.\n17:20 Comment: Here he is, a trequartist.\n17:21 Comment: This is already a much more comfortable position for Pjanic, it seems to me.\n17:25 Comment: Here, I remember, Rimsky.\n17:28 Comment: In general, while playing for Roma, he became the best assistant of the Italian Championship for two seasons in a row.\n17:36 Comment: And he continued to give him love.\n17:38 Comment: Hidiro.\n17:39 Comment: Aju Kicha does a great job of translating for us.\n17:41 Comment: It takes time to process, but still the body is impenetrable.\n17:46 Comment: He died and was saved.\n17:48 Comment: And Ani Ich on Higuain.\n17:50 Comment: He doesn’t pass the ball accurately, but Marchisio Legstein provides backup.\n17:56 Comment: Interception.\n17:57 Comment: Touch.\n17:58 Comment: Pass here.\n17:58 Comment: Zvona is free.\n17:59 Comment: Incinia doesn't put a hard foot on it.\n18:1 Comment: It seems to me that he wanted to forward it like that.\n18:3 Comment: This ball is either between or above the opponent’s foot.\n18:6 Comment: He could have tried, of course, to be tougher.\n18:10 Comment: But, nevertheless, an interception.\n18:11 Comment: Napoli have the ball.\n18:14 Comment: The stands began to smoke.\n18:19 Comment: Such a veil.\n18:21 Comment: Fog over the lawn.\n18:23 Comment: It’s unlikely that this bothers the players.\n18:26 Comment: Rather, it reminds us of the fighting that took place here near Naples and Juventus.\n18:35 Comment: Georgini.\n18:36 Comment: Easier.\n18:37 Comment: It unfolds so neatly.\n18:38 Comment: Not under pressure, but here everything is already compressed.\n18:42 Comment: Attention!\n18:45 Comment: Mertens!\n18:46 Comment: And a barbell!\n18:48 Comment: Fantastic moment!\n18:49 Comment: Dries Mertens watched for a terrible mistake by the Juventus defenders.\n18:55 Comment: Stuck into a buffer without breaking the rules.\n18:58 Comment: But the ball did not bounce the way Dries needed.\n19:2 Comment: Already from almost zero angle.\n19:4 Comment: Murderer.\n19:35 Comment: so few pauses, so few segments,\n19:37 Comment: when I have time\n19:39 Comment: talk about something, talk about something.\n19:41 Comment: This is where the game gets fun.\n19:43 Comment: Here is the most evening Italian football.\n19:45 Comment: Streams.\n19:50 Comment: Further on\n19:51 Comment: tenge\n19:53 Comment: This is how it throws\n19:54 Comment: with a ladle.\n19:58 Comment: Well, nothing, he used this ladle\n19:59 Comment: it won't cook here.\n20:2 Comment: Manju Kachkak\n20:3 Comment: deftly exposes the body,\n20:5 Comment: forwards further to Asamo, but here there is an error.\n20:7 Comment: But Manzhu Kachkak himself selects.\n20:10 Comment: This ball is unowned.\n20:14 Comment: Marchisio.\n20:15 Comment: High again\n20:17 Comment: Neapolitans have high pressure.\n20:19 Comment: Look where Kalikhon is.\n20:21 Comment: Only through a long pass.\n20:23 Comment: Counting on Higuain.\n20:24 Comment: He cunningly exposed his back.\n20:27 Comment: Framed Coulibaly.\n20:28 Comment: But I won’t be of much help to him.\n20:32 Comment: Coulibaly\n20:33 Comment: in the second.\n20:33 Comment: And in general, if you remember\n20:36 Comment: in scoring episodes at the gate\n20:38 Comment: Cabral,\n20:39 Comment: scored a goal.\n20:42 Comment: A few more dangerous approaches\n20:43 Comment: when the same Higuain beat\n20:45 Comment: Dufus.\n20:47 Comment: That's probably all.\n20:57 Comment: And Samoan is picking up speed.\n21:1 Comment: See\n21:2 Comment: seems to have been processed unsuccessfully,\n21:3 Comment: but a series of rebounds in his favor.\n21:8 Comment: Rigidly places the body in a square.\n21:11 Comment: Strenich.\n21:11 Comment: And here there is a violation of the rules.\n21:15 Comment: Still, there was a whistle,\n21:16 Comment: but here Levsteiner can be understood.\n21:19 Comment: Just in this noise din\n21:20 Comment: does not allow you to hear the judges' chatter.\n21:24 Comment: All clear.\n21:26 Comment: Yes, this is a violation of the rules.\n21:29 Comment: Rarely, rarely found.\n21:31 Comment: Now, this is Samoa's mistake.\n21:33 Comment: And Mertens.\n21:36 Comment: In my opinion, he didn’t even hit the post.\n21:38 Comment: He hit it.\n21:39 Comment: Let's see how it happened.\n21:40 Comment: In leg.\n21:41 Comment: No, no, no, hit the bar.\n21:43 Comment: Banucci was there too, although he was blocking the corner.\n21:45 Comment: And Mertens almost roars.\n21:49 Comment: You see, firefighters and police are not what they are looking for,\n21:52 Comment: just encouraging.\n21:55 Comment: All of Naples, and not only Naples.\n21:59 Comment: I am sure that in Rome, for example,\n22:1 Comment: today they support Naples.\n22:3 Comment: I just want at least some shadow of intrigue\n22:6 Comment: was at the end of this championship.\n22:8 Comment: Juventus still has an away game with Roma ahead.\n22:11 Comment: Game in Bergamo.\n22:13 Comment: With burning atalanta.\n22:15 Comment: Well, this is a violation of the rules.\n22:17 Comment: I think we still only have one yellow card.\n22:21 Comment: And that one for the censorship armor was shown intimately.\n22:26 Comment: Yes, a tough joint.\n22:31 Comment: But Kellyniev’s nose.\n22:33 Comment: I've been broken more than once.\n22:36 Comment: His nose, not himself.\n22:38 Comment: So it's not scary.\n22:41 Comment: Zelinsky appears on the field.\n22:45 Comment: Little by little Poles begin to appear on the field here.\n22:49 Comment: I’m still talking about this with a hint of Milik, of course.\n22:54 Comment: Allan played a good match, but nevertheless,\n22:57 Comment: you know, during the break I watched a few more alternative reruns.\n23:1 Comment: That same goal by Khidire.\n23:3 Comment: It all started with Allan.\n23:4 Comment: He didn't make it.\n23:6 Comment: He pursued Hidira to the end.\n23:8 Comment: And there he was.\n23:9 Comment: Already in the seventh minute.\n23:10 Comment: Marco Sallan.\n23:11 Comment: Central midfielder from Brazil.\n23:13 Comment: By the way, he never competed with the national team in Brazil.\n23:16 Comment: Golya leaves.\n23:17 Comment: Peter Zelinsky.\n23:19 Comment: 22-year-old Polish central midfielder.\n23:21 Comment: Rapid progress.\n23:23 Comment: In 27 matches in Naples this season, he has already scored the same number of points, namely 10.\n23:29 Comment: how much for 35 games last season in Empol.\n23:33 Comment: Agree, the thing is indicative.\n23:37 Comment: In the summer, I remember, Orel and Adele Laurenquin served, they say, Zelinsky is not disrupting the transfer, he wants to go to Liverpool.\n23:45 Comment: I was unhappy.\n23:47 Comment: Nevertheless, they persuaded him and bought him.\n23:50 Comment: And so, in principle, he shows himself great in Naples.\n23:54 Comment: It seems to me that Zelinsky is, first of all, some kind of diversity in the middle of the field.\n24:0 Comment: Plus Allan, of course, was busy.\n24:1 Comment: Strinnich wins the fight.\n24:3 Comment: Hamshek.\n24:5 Comment: Hamshek is dangerous.\n24:7 Comment: Here you need to play easier.\n24:9 Comment: Strinnich understands this.\n24:11 Comment: And his good takeaway is always a pass.\n24:13 Comment: Mertens and Calikhon understood this.\n24:16 Comment: They went for the ball.\n24:18 Comment: Well, you see, again it comes to Strinnich.\n24:22 Comment: Former defender of Dnepropetrovsk Dnieper.\n24:27 Comment: Well, by the way, he and Dnepr did not reach the Europa League final.\n24:30 Comment: Remember?\n24:31 Comment: I didn’t play for everyone.\n24:32 Comment: He has already switched to Napoleon.\n24:34 Comment: Where?\n24:35 Comment: Who has been a replacement player for a season now.\n24:37 Comment: It’s still surprising to me why Fauzel Ghulam is not talking about the foundation today.\n24:40 Comment: It seems that the last time he played for the Algerian national team was at the Courque de Afrique.\n24:44 Comment: They say he's tired and so on.\n24:46 Comment: But today Strinnich is on the defensive flank.\n24:49 Comment: And he seems to be quite good.\n24:50 Comment: Mandzukic.\n24:51 Comment: Here, with a bow.\n24:52 Comment: A game.\n24:53 Comment: Casting\n24:54 Comment: A game.\n25:1 Comment: Casting\n25:2 Comment: Kulebali.\n25:3 Comment: He picked up the ball.\n25:4 Comment: Sending him outside the penalty area.\n25:6 Comment: Jorginho.\n25:8 Comment: In a trap.\n25:9 Comment: We have to send this ball to the flank like this.\n25:12 Comment: Kalihon puts pressure on Mandzukic.\n25:14 Comment: Look where Mandzukic is.\n25:15 Comment: At left back position.\n25:17 Comment: And Samoa is ahead.\n25:18 Comment: Some expected Alex Sandro to be in the starting lineup today.\n25:21 Comment: But Samoa, in general, this season, I must say, has regained the confidence of the coaching staff.\n25:27 Comment: Showed again that he was needed.\n25:28 Comment: Although there was talk that there might be other teams.\n25:31 Comment: Which team or another will they go to?\n25:34 Comment: But he proved it.\n25:35 Comment: Proved.\n25:36 Comment: Plus, of course, rotation is important.\n25:38 Comment: Alexa Sandro, I think, will almost certainly appear in the match against Barca.\n25:43 Comment: Or, for example, in a match against Naples.\n25:46 Comment: But in a cup.\n25:47 Comment: Let me remind you that on Wednesday there is a return cup game between Napoleon and Ventus.\n25:53 Comment: This is exactly where this often happens when championship and cup matches intersect.\n25:58 Comment: It's always surprising.\n26:0 Comment: It gets boring.\n26:1 Comment: You always have to go to another player.\n26:3 Comment: You should always look for some additional motivation.\n26:6 Comment: Well, much more motivation, right?\n26:9 Comment: To win Juventus.\n26:11 Comment: Khidira gets hit in the legs.\n26:15 Comment: Khidira on the lawn.\n26:17 Comment: A little more fouls in the second half.\n26:19 Comment: But, probably, there are rare Juventus fans today.\n26:22 Comment: Pavel Medved and other megaferons.\n26:24 Comment: Yuvent.\n26:25 Comment: It got tough here.\n26:27 Comment: But Achilles, by the way, is very painful.\n26:30 Comment: It's enough.\n26:32 Comment: Hidiri, I already said that he is one of the most titled in the Italian Championship.\n26:36 Comment: You probably haven’t forgotten that he is the champion of Germany, the champion of Spain.\n26:42 Comment: Italian champion with Juventus.\n26:45 Comment: World champion.\n26:47 Comment: Champions League winner.\n26:49 Comment: Well, he has already reminded more than once in interviews that he was happy to repeat his achievements in the Champions League with Juventus.\n26:58 Comment: Juventus won the main tournament.\n27:1 Comment: One might even say peace.\n27:3 Comment: Well, the tournament.\n27:5 Comment: Since '96.\n27:9 Comment: This is, of course, what people dream about in a tournament.\n27:11 Comment: The emotions faded a little.\n27:14 Comment: And in general, it’s been a long time since the ball was even in close proximity.\n27:19 Comment: It's a free kick.\n27:20 Comment: But now Miralem Pyankhin.\n27:22 Comment: Look, almost the first standard, the first free kick, which Pyankhin takes.\n27:26 Comment: How rarely do Neapolitans fall today?\n27:28 Comment: But they know very well that Pyankhin is the best free-kick taker in Serie A.\n27:33 Comment: Maybe even not only in presentation.\n27:35 Comment: Cabral copes.\n27:37 Comment: Here, in fact, the bucket got in the way.\n27:39 Comment: Kostrinich.\n27:41 Comment: Yes, you and I talked in the first half about whether Cabral made a mistake in the episode with the goal.\n27:45 Comment: But in general, what do you want if a person is playing in the Italian Championship for the first time this season?\n27:51 Comment: First.\n27:53 Comment: He only has one match in the entire season.\n27:55 Comment: Against Specials.\n27:57 Comment: In the Italian Cup.\n27:58 Comment: Well, what can we talk about?\n27:59 Comment: No tone.\n28:0 Comment: Isinia.\n28:1 Comment: Threw the ball past Leshtainer.\n28:3 Comment: He put out the spool.\n28:4 Comment: But calling a foul was not enough.\n28:8 Comment: And Isinia doesn’t really argue.\n28:10 Comment: Bulbolin.\n28:11 Comment: Strange show.\n28:13 Comment: Packy.\n28:16 Comment: Bulbolin.\n28:18 Comment: You need to train.\n28:20 Comment: Here, by the way.\n28:27 Comment: Continuing the theme of kule-bali.\n28:30 Comment: The famous football player, now an agent Roman Reshchuk, said that Kule-Bali could have turned out to be the Russian Championship in 2019.\n28:40 Comment: Womberby, by the way, should skip it.\n28:42 Comment: Did not work out.\n28:44 Comment: Colichon.\n28:45 Comment: Lumbago.\n28:46 Comment: There are a lot of blue players here.\n28:48 Comment: See marquisia.\n28:49 Comment: What does this guy allow himself to do?\n28:51 Comment: Juggler's tricks.\n28:52 Comment: Juggling tricks inside the penalty area, but how careful Claudio is when working with the ball.\n28:59 Comment: Anyone, but the Prince, will be able to do this with his technology.\n29:6 Comment: Banuchi.\n29:8 Comment: Iguai.\n29:10 Comment: Once again the surrounding area will be noisy.\n29:14 Comment: Neapolitan public. But who will be here?\n29:17 Comment: All of Naples, I'm sure, is around the TV.\n29:19 Comment: And those who are not near the TV are in the stands.\n29:28 Comment: Olegri, by the way, according to tradition, before the match, he took up his iron and began to smooth out the corners.\n29:35 Comment: Higuaina whistling is normal.\n29:39 Comment: I am sure that the Neapolitan fans will show fireplay and a culture of cheering.\n29:43 Comment: Well, in general, it’s always told in this spirit.\n29:46 Comment: Always for peace, chewing gum.\n29:48 Comment: Game.\n29:49 Comment: Also a cross from Mertens.\n29:52 Comment: But Mertens himself must be there and respond to these crosses.\n29:55 Comment: Blue. Wow, what a show.\n29:57 Comment: Dries Mertens. Impact position.\n30:0 Comment: Another attempt.\n30:3 Comment: What are you going to do? What's with the long shots in Naples today?\n30:7 Comment: Here comes Georgina.\n30:9 Comment: Again, it only threatens advertising accounts.\n30:13 Comment: Hamshik leaves the field.\n30:14 Comment: And someone, perhaps who had not seen Napol in action for a long time, grabbed his head.\n30:19 Comment: Maybe even because of Irakez.\n30:21 Comment: Like, how can this be? What would we do without this embalmed Irakez?\n30:26 Comment: What about without the captain, leader and goal scorer?\n30:29 Comment: But this is one of the most common replacements for Saree in recent times.\n30:34 Comment: Very often, somewhere in the 70s, 75s, Hamshik chooses exactly the minutes.\n30:42 Comment: And another Horvat appears on the field.\n30:45 Comment: Between this and then.\n30:47 Comment: The same goes for the defender, by the way.\n30:49 Comment: Collection of Croatia.\n30:51 Comment: A player named Marco Rock.\n31:2 Comment: Well, I do not know. This is also, probably, an attempt to impose this same Juventus on Rock.\n31:8 Comment: He should play more aggressively in the middle of the field.\n31:11 Comment: Hamshik gave a lot of everything.\n31:13 Comment: Well, in principle, this football player with a sonorous surname can add energy.\n31:18 Comment: Quite technical.\n31:20 Comment: And he is increasingly getting playing time in the last rounds.\n31:25 Comment: Georgini.\n31:27 Comment: Albiol.\n31:29 Comment: Well, I want to. I want Napoleon to take a risk.\n31:32 Comment: Albeit, maybe at the cost of the second goal.\n31:35 Comment: But still we love Sari football, Napoleon football.\n31:39 Comment: And in general, this city is the custodian of great football traditions.\n31:45 Comment: For the emotions of football.\n31:48 Comment: This is how Zelinsky played.\n31:51 Comment: And there was a pass between two defenders.\n31:53 Comment: The pressure is on.\n31:55 Comment: This is the pressure. Higuain.\n31:57 Comment: Higuain loses the ball.\n32:3 Comment: Off and on, the combination went.\n32:5 Comment: The ball has a move.\n32:7 Comment: And by the way, it’s been a long time since Juventus counterattacked.\n32:9 Comment: Here's a long shot. This is just Rock, if I'm not mistaken. Yes.\n32:14 Comment: I am more than sure that a certain installation.\n32:17 Comment: It was from Sari.\n32:19 Comment: Try to attack with ranged attempts.\n32:23 Comment: Considering that Juventus besieged all approaches to the penalty area.\n32:32 Comment: You won't get through.\n32:33 Comment: Well, here we go.\n32:35 Comment: Well, let's speculate.\n32:37 Comment: It turns out Fauzi Ghulyan, right?\n32:39 Comment: Which we saw in the starting lineup.\n32:42 Comment: Well, most likely, instead of Strinich.\n32:45 Comment: What didn’t you like about Strinich?\n32:46 Comment: In theory, this is probably a response to the exit of the Square.\n32:50 Comment: Yes? Kvadrata directed the player to attack.\n32:57 Comment: I just wouldn’t say that he is organizing any problems for Strinich there.\n33:0 Comment: For example, Strinich covered him.\n33:2 Comment: There is no violation of the rules.\n33:4 Comment: Is it worth changing?\n33:6 Comment: Rock.\n33:8 Comment: Passed into touch by Mertens.\n33:11 Comment: I must say that Rock was not very successful either.\n33:16 Comment: Inconvenient, by the way.\n33:18 Comment: Zelinsky.\n33:22 Comment: Rock.\n33:23 Comment: Right here, right?\n33:24 Comment: A very important quality.\n33:26 Comment: After the transfer, immediately offer yourself back.\n33:28 Comment: On the reverse pass.\n33:30 Comment: Rock.\n33:32 Comment: Yes, and finally, Paula Debala.\n33:34 Comment: We discussed this in the first half.\n33:37 Comment: Regarding the fact that his entry onto the field is inevitable.\n33:42 Comment: Yes, Strinich hits the field.\n33:44 Comment: Well, I can only assume that Strinic in general is not used to playing the full 90 minutes this season.\n33:53 Comment: And in order to avoid any excesses, Sari removes him from the field in advance.\n33:59 Comment: Well, Debala takes the field instead of Marchisio.\n34:5 Comment: Marchisio.\n34:7 Comment: That's the risk. This is the risk from Allegri.\n34:10 Comment: Much more gifted in terms of attacking qualities.\n34:12 Comment: The football player is released by Massimiliano Allegri.\n34:17 Comment: Marchisio worked fruitfully in the middle of the field.\n34:21 Comment: Curious.\n34:25 Comment: Pjanic and Khidira will apparently form a team of tenacious midfielders.\n34:30 Comment: Two in their place.\n34:33 Comment: Squares on the right.\n34:35 Comment: Manjuki Chetanko on the left.\n34:37 Comment: Well, and Debala.\n34:39 Comment: Korvardova is pulling.\n34:41 Comment: Korvardova will have a hard time performing.\n34:44 Comment: Debala, Debala, whatever.\n34:47 Comment: It will be comfortable.\n34:50 Comment: Pyanich.\n34:52 Comment: That one is on the killline.\n34:54 Comment: We see that we are also under pressure.\n34:57 Comment: Isamoa throws this ball.\n35:0 Comment: It’s interesting, by the way, that in the second half, as far as I understand, the teams have never taken it to a corner.\n35:7 Comment: Sometimes it happens.\n35:8 Comment: Seven corners in the first half, zero in the second.\n35:11 Comment: This is still a kind of reflection of flank activity and activity in general in the attack.\n35:21 Comment: Yes, and so if you look at it, there are probably still a little less prominent episodes than before the break.\n35:28 Comment: Incinia is played.\n35:31 Comment: It seems to me that he came up with a completely different program.\n35:34 Comment: He probably wanted to make a through pass.\n35:36 Comment: It turned out somehow in the center, not in the flank.\n35:38 Comment: But then there is Fauzi Ghulam. Fresh.\n35:41 Comment: Meets Kvadrat.\n35:42 Comment: That's why he came out onto the field.\n35:45 Comment: Came out to confront Ivan Kvadrat.\n35:48 Comment: Kvadrata is in good spirits.\n35:50 Comment: By the way, unlike Debal, he returned after competing in the South American qualifying round for the World Championships in Russia.\n36:0 Comment: Still, Colombia won two victories over Bolivia, in particular.\n36:5 Comment: And Colombia also beat with direct participation.\n36:9 Comment: Ecuador.\n36:12 Comment: Ecuador scored a goal.\n36:14 Comment: Colombia is now in second position after Brazil.\n36:16 Comment: But everything is still tight there.\n36:18 Comment: Well, Argentina and Debala are on the verge of disaster.\n36:21 Comment: Argentina may not qualify for the championship.\n36:23 Comment: But these are all international matters.\n36:26 Comment: We're talking about clubs here.\n36:29 Comment: And it’s very interesting to see what’s there in Kazakhstan.\n36:33 Comment: And here, in Kazakhstan.\n36:37 Comment: It's very interesting to see Napoleon at the end.\n36:40 Comment: Yes, Napoleon has its own local task.\n36:44 Comment: Nobody really talks about the fact that Juventus can be seriously overtaken.\n36:49 Comment: And deprive him of another championship title.\n36:52 Comment: But, firstly, it would have been a landmark victory if Napoleon had won it.\n36:56 Comment: Secondly, Napoleon is fighting with Roma for second place and a direct ticket to the Champions League.\n37:2 Comment: I understand that the team that finishes third in Serie A\n37:5 Comment: Only through qualification will she be able to get into the main round of the Champions League.\n37:12 Comment: There are enough tackles in our own half.\n37:16 Comment: Rafael Cabral is bored and cold.\n37:20 Comment: But in fact, Buffon, yes, there was an episode where he fought with Mertens.\n37:30 Comment: That's all. What a goal.\n37:32 Comment: We didn’t really think about Buffon either.\n37:34 Comment: Although he also has, in a sense, a landmark game today.\n37:37 Comment: The fact is that today Gigi Buffon is playing his 615th match in Serie A.\n37:43 Comment: And in this indicator he caught up with the legendary Javier Sanetti.\n37:48 Comment: The legend of Inter Milan.\n37:54 Comment: Eternal Buffon.\n37:56 Comment: As timeless as Sanetti.\n37:58 Comment: Over the years, the appearance has not changed at all.\n38:0 Comment: But that's another story.\n38:2 Comment: And so far in our history...\n38:4 Comment: 1-1.\n38:5 Comment: Pyanich.\n38:6 Comment: Loses the ball.\n38:7 Comment: Mertens.\n38:8 Comment: Here is a chance to accelerate.\n38:9 Comment: One to one.\n38:10 Comment: Banucci is against him.\n38:11 Comment: Leo Banucci.\n38:13 Comment: Bravo.\n38:15 Comment: Holding out a hockey stick.\n38:17 Comment: In the purest way, it leaves the opponent without a game projectile.\n38:23 Comment: It was well done.\n38:25 Comment: It's not even a tackle.\n38:27 Comment: Paging.\n38:28 Comment: And again Leo Banucci is in place.\n38:30 Comment: Somewhere before Kirini.\n38:32 Comment: Selection, however, deputy.\n38:33 Comment: Neapolitans.\n38:35 Comment: Kick to the legs.\n38:36 Comment: It's a foul.\n38:37 Comment: By the way, here’s another one who’s bored.\n38:40 Comment: Yes, Orsat.\n38:41 Comment: But he sees here, according to the principle of advantage, the ball remains with Naples.\n38:43 Comment: He doesn't blow the whistle.\n38:44 Comment: Incinia.\n38:45 Comment: And so it continues.\n38:47 Comment: When was the last time Orsat blew the whistle?\n38:51 Comment: 5-7 ago.\n38:53 Comment: Debala.\n38:54 Comment: It’s difficult, of course, to enter a match like this.\n38:56 Comment: This program, it seems to me, was unnecessary.\n39:1 Comment: Little by little.\n39:2 Comment: Pass towards the goal.\n39:5 Comment: Juventus.\n39:6 Comment: Gigno.\n39:8 Comment: Blue.\n39:9 Comment: Zelinsky.\n39:10 Comment: The Whirlwind has begun.\n39:12 Comment: Incinia.\n39:13 Comment: Left Pyanich.\n39:15 Comment: Struggle.\n39:17 Comment: Hysaj materialized there on the corner of the penalty area.\n39:23 Comment: And Osamo punches forward.\n39:26 Comment: Osamo, by the way, did not go to the African Cup.\n39:28 Comment: He admitted that he was called, the coach called him.\n39:31 Comment: The whole country wanted the star to be on the team at the right time.\n39:35 Comment: But he deliberately refused, realizing that he could lose his position in the club.\n39:42 Comment: This has happened more than once during the African Cup of Nations.\n39:46 Comment: That's why I stayed.\n39:47 Comment: Here we see, it is based on the central achturo.\n39:53 Comment: Zelinsky was seen to apologize to Incinia for not returning the ball to him in touch.\n39:59 Comment: This is one of the gaming principles of the Neapolitans.\n40:2 Comment: Pass the ball with minimal touch.\n40:7 Comment: Oh, the through ball to Insinia didn’t go through.\n40:11 Comment: Transmission with body.\n40:12 Comment: Two defensive lines at once.\n40:14 Comment: Come on, Juventus, I'm your counterattack.\n40:17 Comment: Eisteiner, Quadrado.\n40:20 Comment: Well, what kind of counterattack can we talk about here if there is only one pin on the opposing side of the field.\n40:25 Comment: And the Neapolitans are trying with all their might to secure it.\n40:29 Comment: Well, for now it's Chet.\n40:32 Comment: We see that Gellini.\n40:34 Comment: Gellini is wrong.\n40:36 Comment: There is no handball here, as it seemed.\n40:38 Comment: And here it is, the long-awaited whistle of Urs.\n40:44 Comment: Well, some will say that there was not enough blood in today's match.\n40:49 Comment: On the other hand, it says that football is in the spotlight.\n40:53 Comment: They are mixed of the day.\n40:54 Comment: Here is Miralem Pjanic.\n40:56 Comment: Leaves the field.\n40:58 Comment: Another central midfielder comes out with such strong defensive capabilities.\n41:6 Comment: This is Venezuelan Tomas Olenko, who moved to Juventus in the winter.\n41:12 Comment: But as expected, he did not take a place in the starting lineup.\n41:16 Comment: But it was still clear that this would be a replacement player.\n41:20 Comment: Pyanich, after all, tried.\n41:23 Comment: Again, first of all, there is destruction on the Niva.\n41:26 Comment: He doesn't depend on attack anymore, right?\n41:30 Comment: Rinko.\n41:33 Comment: In my opinion, the attempt to play in attack did not fully justify itself.\n41:38 Comment: Or even create at least some kind of counter-game through Debala’s exit.\n41:42 Comment: And Allegrio cements himself into the middle of the field.\n41:47 Comment: Let Rinko take Pyanich's place.\n41:49 Comment: Debalom.\n41:51 Comment: Again a violation of the rules on the part of the Neapolitans.\n41:56 Comment: All three substitutions were made by Sari.\n41:59 Comment: And here, you see, I can’t get into Sari’s head.\n42:3 Comment: To be honest, I expected either Milik or Pavoletti to appear on the field.\n42:9 Comment: But neither one nor the other.\n42:11 Comment: Although, in fact, neither one nor the other scores.\n42:13 Comment: Yes, they are professional center forwards.\n42:16 Comment: But so far there is no hope for them lately.\n42:20 Comment: Milik, in general, of course, in record time in four.\n42:25 Comment: But, of course, they’ll be back in a little more than a month after rupturing their cruciate ligaments.\n42:30 Comment: Of course, the modern agency creates fantasy.\n42:35 Comment: Broadcast.\n42:38 Comment: Well, it's that simple.\n42:40 Comment: Without thinking, he pounces forward.\n42:43 Comment: Well, it’s difficult to call these two meetings between Naples and Juventus a two-round confrontation.\n42:50 Comment: But there is a feeling that in boiling water, everything will probably be fine.\n42:53 Comment: But there is a feeling that there will be a fire in boiling water.\n42:56 Comment: Today, after all, in the second half, yes, there was a goal, there was this episode with Osamo’s mistake.\n43:2 Comment: Otherwise, the Juventus defense looked unshakable.\n43:8 Comment: The Maipolitan plan did not work 100 percent.\n43:11 Comment: Well, we evened the score, and that’s not bad.\n43:14 Comment: Yes, because in the previous two matches of this season they lost to Juventus.\n43:19 Comment: Higuain scored both times.\n43:21 Comment: And today on dry rations.\n43:24 Comment: Gonsal Higuain.\n43:26 Comment: I remember when he moved to Naples, the angry Nepolitans came up with all sorts of things.\n43:32 Comment: And I remember one cafe took the following action.\n43:42 Comment: In general, it suggested that if Higuain were injured,\n43:51 Comment: offered its visitors Margherita pizza one E at a time.\n43:55 Comment: And indeed there was an episode when Higuain was injured.\n43:58 Comment: In general, these are all these facets of Neapolitan hatred for their future femme.\n44:7 Comment: Nicola Amaruza also spoke on this topic.\n44:10 Comment: A famous striker who also played in Naples and Turin.\n44:13 Comment: He said Higuain's move was seen as a betrayal.\n44:19 Comment: He, of course, showed outstanding football for three years in Naples, but he must be ready for the municipality.\n44:26 Comment: I don’t know, it doesn’t seem to me that Higuain somehow sticks to them all today.\n44:32 Comment: Naples' attack continues.\n44:33 Comment: Well, finally, only at the 90th minute we got to the penalty area.\n44:36 Comment: Attention! Discount!\n44:39 Comment: And the offside position was once again recorded, as far as I understand.\n44:44 Comment: Bufon smiles.\n44:47 Comment: You know, it was so...\n44:48 Comment: A smile of superiority.\n44:50 Comment: Like, guys, don't make noise.\n44:55 Comment: There was no offside here.

    "summary": "In the historical San Paolo Stadium, an electric atmosphere set the stage for the high-stakes Serie A clash between Napoli and Juventus. From the outset, it was clear that the match, laden with subplots and drama, would be nothing short of a thriller. Both teams had reasons to give their best, with Napoli looking to topple Juventus's dominance and secure crucial points, while Juventus intended to keep their grip on the top of the table firm.\n\nKickoff saw Napoli field a lineup under the command of Rafael Cabral between the posts. The defense was organized with Ivan Strinic on the left, Elseid Hysaj on the right, and the central pairing of Raul Albiol and Kalidou Koulibaly. Midfield duties were handled by Marek Hamsik, Jorginho, and Allan. In the attack, Lorenzo Insigne played on the left wing, José Callejón on the right, and the ever-dangerous Dries Mertens positioned centrally.\n\nFor Juventus, Gianluigi Buffon guarded the goal, exuding experience and leadership. The defensive lineup had Kwadwo Asamoah on the left and Stephan Lichtsteiner on the right, with Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini forming a formidable center-back duo. Sami Khedira and Claudio Marchisio provided stability and control in midfield. The attacking quartet featured Mario Mandzukic on the left, Mario Lemina on the right, Miralem Pjanic in the creative role, and Gonzalo Higuain spearheading the attack.\n\nThe match started with both teams feeling each other out, showing moments of caution mixed with sudden bursts of aggression. By the seventh minute, Juventus had taken the lead. It was Sami Khedira, one of the most accomplished midfielders in Serie A, who capitalized on a gap in Napoli’s defense. Picking up the ball, Khedira deftly maneuvered past several defenders and finished clinically from close range, a shot with a bounce that left Rafael Cabral sprawled. This goal underscored Juventus’s experience and ability to seize opportunities with ruthless efficiency.\n\nDespite conceding early, Napoli did not lose their fighting spirit. They pressed forward, orchestrating several plays mainly through their talismanic figure Hamsik and the ever-creative Insigne. Insigne threatened repeatedly, often finding space around Lichtsteiner. His dribbling and finesse, however, lacked the crucial final touch needed to convert these chances into goals.\n\nBuffon was called into action multiple times, showcasing why he remains a stalwart in goal even in the twilight of his illustrious career. His saves, coupled with the resilience of Chiellini and Bonucci, frustrated Napoli. Strinic’s early presence was notable, often driving forward to add width to Napoli’s attacks. However, Juventus’s well-drilled defensive line remained resolute.\n\nNapoli’s central midfield trio – Hamsik, Jorginho, and Allan – worked tirelessly, linking defense and attack. Allan, in particular, was a dynamo in midfield, disrupting Juventus’s flow and distributing the ball efficiently. Yet, Juventus’s own midfielders, especially Khedira, proved challenging to contain. Khedira’s goal highlighted his offensive instincts, surprising the Napoli defense.\n\nGonzalo Higuain, the former Napoli hero turned antagonist, was closely watched by the home crowd. His every move was booed, and his touches were limited, thanks to the robust defending of Koulibaly and Albiol. Higuain's performance, however, had flashes of brilliance, including a deft pass to Lemina that nearly extended Juventus’s lead.\n\nIn the second half, Napoli’s urgency was evident. They ramped up their pace and intensity, pressing Juventus back and controlling possession. Their persistence bore fruit in the 60th minute when Hamsik finally breached Buffon’s defenses. The play was a masterclass of one-touch football, with Insigne and Mertens combining exquisitely before Hamsik struck a decisive finish past Buffon. The stadium erupted, and the scoreline was leveled at 1-1, injecting new life into Napoli’s ambitions.\n\nWith the match on a knife-edge, both teams made strategic substitutions. Juventus brought on the dynamic talents of Juan Cuadrado and Paulo Dybala to add fresh legs and attacking impetus. Napoli introduced Piotr Zieliński and Marco Rog, aiming to fortify their midfield and sustain their forward momentum. The introduction of Zuryn was a tactical move as it aimed to exploit any lapses in Juventus’s defensive concentration.\n\nWith time winding down, Napoli continued to press, their attacking trio relentlessly probing for a winning goal. Mertens, Hamsik, and Insigne showcased remarkable fluidity and interchange, each taking turns to torment the Juventus backline. Yet, Juventus’s experience allowed them to absorb the pressure, using tactical fouls and time-wasting maneuvers to disrupt Napoli’s rhythm.\n\nTowards the end of the match, both teams showed signs of weariness but maintained their commitment to finding a decisive goal. A dramatic moment came when Lorenzo Insigne’s shot narrowly missed the target, a culmination of brilliant individual skill but lacking in precision. As the minutes ticked away, Napoli’s chances became more infrequent, with Juventus’s defense tightening their grip.\n\nJuventus, while often on the back foot in the second half, orchestrated several counter-attacks. Higuain had opportunities to silence the hostile crowd, but Rafael Cabral was alert, denying him with crucial saves. The defensive efforts from Koulibaly, whose physical presence was imposing throughout, also played a significant role in staving off Juventus’s advances.\n\nWith the referee’s final whistle, the match concluded at 1-1, a result that left both sets of fans with mixed emotions. For Napoli, it was a display of resilience and quality, that showed they could stand toe to toe with the champions. For Juventus, it was a testament to their tactical discipline and the ability to grind out results under pressure.\n\nThe draw meant that Juventus maintained their position at the summit of Serie A, taking a step closer to another league title. Napoli, on the other hand, could take pride in their performance, knowing they had pushed one of Europe’s elite clubs to the limit.\n\nThe return of Higuain to the San Paolo was one of the storylines that dominated the pre-match talk and, predictably, the match itself. His move to Juventus had soured his relationship with the Napoli faithful, and the jeers and whistles whenever he touched the ball were a constant reminder of his controversial transfer. Nonetheless, the Argentine striker’s performance showed professionalism, even if luck and Rafael Cabral denied him the goal to leave a significant mark on his return.\n\nOverall, the match was a showcase of high-quality football, characterized by intense midfield battles, tactical ingenuity, and moments of sublime skill. It underscored the competitive nature of Serie A and the enthralling football on offer. Both teams, while leaving with a share of the spoils, provided a spectacle that will be remembered by fans for its passion and drama."
