    "summary": "AS Roma hosted Inter in what turned out to be an exhilarating encounter, with the final scoreline of 2-1 in favor of the home team. The match saw a fascinating blend of attacking flair, defensive solidity, and tactical battles, truly encapsulating the spirit of Serie A football.\n\nThe first half kicked off with AS Roma initiating the play at exactly 00:01. Early possession changes dominated the first few minutes, with the ball going out of play at 00:23. Inter quickly sought to establish their dominance with a corner at 00:38, but their resulting shot went off target at 00:50. AS Roma was quick to clear any danger at 01:16. As play continued, both teams grappled for control, resulting in a series of balls out of play and throw-ins.\n\nAS Roma soon showcased their attacking prowess. At 02:09, they won a corner. However, this effort was disrupted, and the ball went out of play again at 02:11. Another corner for AS Roma at 02:28 ended with a foul against them, breaking their momentum.\n\nInter tried to mount their own attacks, but Roma's defense stood resolute, clearing the danger at 04:13. The home side's efforts paid off at 04:26 with a shot on target leading to the match's first goal. The goal, which came just 4 minutes and 26 seconds into the game, saw AS Roma take a crucial early lead, sending their fans into raptures.\n\nInter, undeterred, resumed play with the kickoff at 05:23. As the match progressed, both teams exchanged clearances and throw-ins. However, the game was far from static. Inter earned a free-kick at 10:54 following a foul by Alessandro Florenzi of AS Roma. Inter's shot on target from the free-kick at 11:17, taken from 25 meters out by Ever Banega, was thwarted by the Roma defense.\n\nAntonio Candreva of Inter tried to capitalize on a corner at 11:46 but was effectively neutralized by Wojciech Szczesny, who snuffed out the attack at 12:57. Roma responded with their own opportunity in the 13th minute but failed to convert. Diego Perotti burst into the penalty area, only to direct his shot well wide of the target at 13:46.\n\nInter continued to press, with Candreva once again in the thick of the action. However, he was repeatedly frustrated by solid defensive displays from Roma. The match saw a flurry of activity around the 15-minute mark, with both sides exchanging throw-ins, clearances, and brief moments of possession. Inter's Cristian Ansaldi whipped in a promising cross at 16:08, but it was unsuccessful in finding a teammate.\n\nRoma's attacking intent was clear, with Mohamed Salah finding himself offside at 16:35. Ever Banega tried his luck from long range in the 18th minute, but his effort went well wide of the right post. Salah almost doubled Romaâ€™s lead at 20:18 after receiving a fantastic pass and shooting from close range, but the ball crashed against the post.\n\nThe home side did not relent. Salah again forced a fine save from Interâ€™s goalkeeper Samir Handanovic at 21:00. For Inter, Ivan Perisic produced a dangerous low pass into Romaâ€™s penalty area, which earned them a corner at 21:56, but this opportunity was wasted as the ball was cleared by the first man.\n\nTempers flared when Davide Santon of Inter received a yellow card at 23:39 following a tackle. Federico Fazio missed a great header opportunity for Roma shortly after the resulting free-kick. Both teams continued to exchange attacks and moments of defensive solidity.\n\nRomaâ€™s intensity did not drop.
