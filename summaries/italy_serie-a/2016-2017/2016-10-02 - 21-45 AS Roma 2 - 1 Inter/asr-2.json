And here Roma earns a second corner in a row.\n2:14 Comment: Cross. The header knocks the ball out of bounds again.\n2:19 Comment: This is a good start in terms of the number of attacks from both Inter and Roma.\n2:25 Comment: Standard position. Roma, of course, will try to score now after this corner ball.\n2:31 Comment: I just didn’t make it to Jeckle.\n2:33 Comment: The formula is not bad. Of course, he will try to score after this standard in the third minute.\n2:37 Comment: In general, any trainer can have a wonderful attitude.\n2:40 Comment: It would be nice to score one, or even better, two, and then play according to the score.\n2:44 Comment: But this is where Tevens Trottman overdid it. Dutch national team player.\n2:47 Comment: And he fouled on Harry Medelli.\n2:50 Comment: Luciano Spalletti is criticized. He is criticized for his relationship with Francesco Totti.\n2:56 Comment: Here, additional firewood was added after the birthday.\n3:1 Comment: Francesco, who turned 40 this week. Just imagine, 40 years.\n3:6 Comment: Some of them have already graduated from college.\n3:9 Comment: Get married several times, get divorced and get married again.\n3:13 Comment: And Francesco Totti continues to play for Roma.\n3:16 Comment: Well, Luciano Spalletti let slip somewhere that he would like to give Francesco Totti a time machine.\n3:24 Comment: Well, Totti said that yes, it would be nice to lose 10 extra years.\n3:28 Comment: Some people lose extra pounds, but Totti wanted to lose a few extra years.\n3:34 Comment: By the way, Spalletti hints in all interviews that his relationship with Totti has normalized.\n3:40 Comment: And Totti himself confirmed this in one of his interviews and that he has normal relations with both coach Spalletti and President Polotta, the owner of Roma.\n3:49 Comment: Therefore, there are no global problems now.\n3:51 Comment: They may be inside both Totti and Spalletti, some kind of anti-sympathy for each other.\n3:59 Comment: But nevertheless, they still live a normal life.\n4:2 Comment: Totti played, let me remind you, in the Europa League against Astra, he made three assists and played well.\n4:7 Comment: I think he has a chance on the field today.\n4:10 Comment: Played well, it's a good run when a person makes three assists in a match where his team wins 4-0.\n4:18 Comment: Roma with the ball, pass to Salah, David Santon against him.\n4:22 Comment: Events are developing on the right flank, the inclusion of a defender and a goal!\n4:29 Comment: Edin Dzeko!\n4:31 Comment: Gooooool!\n4:32 Comment: Well, it was worth scolding, it’s Edin Dzeko, how he puts his Bosnian leg out of the Goalkeeper’s area and sends the ball into the goal.\n4:40 Comment: This is Edin Dzeko's fifth goal of the season.\n4:43 Comment: But what, what is defender Bruno Perez like, huh?\n4:47 Comment: Here he worked the ball and look, but there is no side.\n4:50 Comment: But there is no side, in this situation Dzeko played perfectly with one touch.\n4:55 Comment: And look how Dzeko very cleverly left the referee.\n4:58 Comment: Here, oh, like an elephant walker down a hill, yes, he went down and went around special sticks.\n5:4 Comment: And here he went around the referee and it was 1-0.\n5:7 Comment: Handanovic is powerless, a wonderful goal.\n5:9 Comment: I would note the whole combination and the inclusion of the defender and the timely pass.\n5:13 Comment: And Edin Dzeko, and the applause of Francesco Totti.\n5:16 Comment: He is happy with Francesco Totti, but Dzeko seems to answer you.\n5:20 Comment: Konstantin, the fifth goal scored, something scolded him.\n5:22 Comment: And by the way, they say that Dzeko failed last season at Roma.\n5:26 Comment: But this has already scored 5 goals in the Italian Championship.\n5:29 Comment: He is already next to Higuain and Icardi.\n5:32 Comment: Plus Bacca, these three forwards have 6 goals each.\n5:36 Comment: Dzheko 4 and Ignipola are almost the entire game ahead of today's.\n5:41 Comment: Jack had 4, became 5.\n5:44 Comment: It became 5, another one will score it, let’s say today.\n5:46 Comment: It will catch up with Higuain, Icardi, and Bacca.\n5:49 Comment: Although Icardi also has the whole game ahead today.\n5:52 Comment: Fine. Ansaldi with the ball.\n5:54 Comment: We had a very fun start, such tempo football.\n5:57 Comment: Here the ball is taken away from the Argentines.\n5:59 Comment: This is Perotti next. Give it to Dzeko, he has a game today.\n6:3 Comment: Dzeko, serve, new guy.\n6:5 Comment: Why not with your head? Where did you fly off to?\n6:9 Comment: I had to get the ball across the goal with my curls now.\n6:13 Comment: But what an attack, and again Roma is dashing, right?\n6:16 Comment: Whirlwind Roma in the first minutes.\n6:19 Comment: But explain why the new guy didn’t really go to play with his head,\n6:23 Comment: and began to put out his left leg.\n6:25 Comment: It seems to me that this reflex was already set up by the new guy,\n6:27 Comment: that he will try to close this cross with his foot,\n6:30 Comment: and was unable to quickly find his bearings and switch.\n6:33 Comment: Harry Medel with the ball, pass to the center to Iver Bonega.\n6:36 Comment: Bonega leaves the ball to Jao Mario.\n6:39 Comment: Mario, they say, has already become almost one of the key players at Inter.\n6:44 Comment: Another mistake in Inter's defense.\n6:46 Comment: Pirotti picks up the ball.\n6:48 Comment: Good pass.\n6:49 Comment: No, I probably could have played Diego Pirotti on Edin Dzeko a little more accurately.\n6:54 Comment: But in any case it was very dangerous.\n6:56 Comment: And you're absolutely right.\n6:57 Comment: Zhao Mario is already a leader within the team.\n7:0 Comment: The fans already adore him.\n7:2 Comment: Jao Mario is one of the most high-profile transfers in the history of Inter.\n7:5 Comment: In total, Inter will pay Sporting Lisbon almost 45 million euros for him.\n7:11 Comment: A huge amount of money in today's times.\n7:13 Comment: But this just speaks about the bombs of the new owners of Inter,\n7:17 Comment: who are going to really invest, invest and build a great team.\n7:22 Comment: Nobel, explain this trick to me.\n7:24 Comment: Christian Ansaldi, we know him as a left-footed player.\n7:27 Comment: His left leg is strong.\n7:29 Comment: Why does he play as a right-back?\n7:31 Comment: I think the point is that Inter have obvious problems on both flanks of defense.\n7:37 Comment: And Santon, who plays on the left today.\n7:40 Comment: And D'Ambrosio, who usually plays on the right.\n7:42 Comment: They don't shine with their play at Inter.\n7:45 Comment: And so I think that when choosing between Santon and D'Ambrosio,\n7:48 Comment: DeBoer thought that Santon would climb onto the field, so Ansaldi plays on the right.\n7:52 Comment: Ansaldi is, in principle, a fairly versatile football player.\n7:56 Comment: He can play both left and right in defense.\n7:58 Comment: Therefore, I think that globally I proceeded from...\n8:0 Comment: Oh, we have another mistake on Roma’s part.\n8:4 Comment: Dangerous counterattack.\n8:5 Comment: Banega hits a twist.\n8:6 Comment: And a barbell!\n8:8 Comment: This is Evero Banega's shot!\n8:10 Comment: And Voisek Honest was already powerless here.\n8:13 Comment: Inter Kondreva continues to have the ball.\n8:16 Comment: It seemed to me that Ever Banega was freaking out,\n8:20 Comment: because there were other options for developing the attack, passing.\n8:23 Comment: Moreover, more obvious options.\n8:25 Comment: Yes, it was Kosta Samonov’s mistake with their blunder in their own half of the field.\n8:31 Comment: Well, this is probably typical for Roma this season.\n8:34 Comment: And in general, under the leadership of Lucianos-Poletiy.\n8:35 Comment: Not only Lucianos-Poletiy, but also Srudi Garsi.\n8:38 Comment: Such errors were made in the transmission.\n8:40 Comment: But the hosts were lucky now that the ball hit the post.\n8:44 Comment: But it didn’t fly into the goal from the post.\n8:47 Comment: Jesus, forward kick.\n8:49 Comment: And the blow is not entirely accurate.\n8:51 Comment: Roma again intercepts the ball in the center of the field.\n8:53 Comment: Jack is at great speed in today's match.\n8:55 Comment: True, there are a lot of mistakes, but that's not scary.\n8:57 Comment: At least in terms of football content.\n8:59 Comment: Salah, he's already in the opponent's gangway.\n9:1 Comment: Under attack!\n9:2 Comment: Shot by Bruno Perez.\n9:4 Comment: Just the right defender of Roma, but his shot was not accurate.\n9:7 Comment: This is already a practiced combination.\n9:9 Comment: Two Salah-Perez.\n9:11 Comment: Timely inclusion.\n9:13 Comment: Broadcast.\n9:14 Comment: First, Perez made an assist to Jack.\n9:16 Comment: And this time Ever Bonega struck the most excellent shot.\n9:19 Comment: Here is such a happy trajectory leaving the fighter.\n9:24 Comment: Well, lucky.\n9:25 Comment: Let's say again that Inter was lucky.\n9:28 Comment: Despite the fact that just now, yes, they brought themselves a moment of guests.\n9:32 Comment: After Miranda’s mistake, the Luciano-Spaleki team immediately responds with their gift.\n9:37 Comment: Concluding the conversation about the composition of Inter Milan.\n9:39 Comment: Indeed, the coach’s decision to release Ansaldi on the right flank.\n9:43 Comment: Well, I’ll add that Deboer has practically no problems with the composition.\n9:46 Comment: Andreola is injured, but he is not a starter.\n9:49 Comment: Yes, he's getting in shape.\n9:51 Comment: Another high-profile acquisition of Inter is Gabriel Barbosa or Gabi Go.\n9:56 Comment: As they call him all over the world, especially in Brazil.\n9:59 Comment: He is on the bench today at number 96.\n10:2 Comment: Brazilian, we are waiting for him.\n10:3 Comment: Also in reserve, for example, is Italian national team player Eder, whom everyone remembers from the European Championship.\n10:9 Comment: Jovi Tinch is in reserve, Kondagbia is in reserve, Philippe Mel is in reserve.\n10:12 Comment: In general, Inter has a very, very solid and deep squad, in my opinion.\n10:18 Comment: Ansaldi, well, I probably said rashly that he is left-footed.\n10:21 Comment: He still knows how to play both.\n10:23 Comment: Yes, yes, he is a versatile footballer.\n10:25 Comment: Versatile football player.\n10:26 Comment: As far as I remember, he had a good, very tight shot from his left foot.\n10:30 Comment: Therefore, here it is by no means a categorical assessment that he is a football player who only knows how to play with one leg.\n10:38 Comment: Luca Bantin awards a free kick in the 11th minute of the match.\n10:41 Comment: Garry Medel is brought down in midfield by Alexander Florence.\n10:48 Comment: And there will be a free kick for Ever Bonego.\n10:50 Comment: By the 11th minute I was already sweating.\n10:52 Comment: Argentinean.\n10:53 Comment: Also, by the way, a football player who becomes the leader of Inter.\n10:57 Comment: And, by the way, it was his performance in the Itari Derby, in the match against Yvette,\n11:2 Comment: was recognized as almost the best in the Milan club.\n11:6 Comment: So, free kick.\n11:7 Comment: The Argentine with the ball can naturally shoot at goal.\n11:10 Comment: Moreover, we have already seen in this match how he hits from long range.\n11:14 Comment: But it’s a bit far for Bonega.\n11:15 Comment: I remember him from Sivili, how he performed.\n11:17 Comment: But it was closer to the penalty area.\n11:19 Comment: Kick, the ball hits the head.\n11:20 Comment: One of the Roma players goes for a corner.\n11:23 Comment: 12 minutes, and how many events have already happened.\n11:25 Comment: And the goal, and the post, and another chance for Roma.\n11:28 Comment: And the fourth corner of today's meeting.\n11:30 Comment: Ever Bonego himself went to serve.\n11:33 Comment: Near Peresic.\n11:34 Comment: Inter players play the ball.\n11:37 Comment: Peresic under the left serve.\n11:39 Comment: And here Manolas kicks the ball away.\n11:42 Comment: Inter players are on selection.\n11:45 Comment: This is Santon playing on the left flank.\n11:47 Comment: Bonego with the ball.\n11:48 Comment: He can naturally try to come up with a good continuation of the attack.\n11:52 Comment: No, he plays with his neighbor.\n11:53 Comment: Harry Medel is switched to the right.\n11:56 Comment: Bad translate.\n11:57 Comment: Harry Medel is minding his own business.\n11:59 Comment: This is actually not exactly its function.\n12:1 Comment: Well, yes, we know Harry Medel as a vacuum cleaner player.\n12:3 Comment: The player is like a dog who is in the center of the field.\n12:5 Comment: He bites into balls and wins the fight.\n12:7 Comment: And then he plays on his neighbor.\n12:8 Comment: He plays against his neighbor, Bonega or Jao Mario.\n12:10 Comment: And they should already spread the rays in different directions.\n12:14 Comment: And direct the rhythm of the team's attack.\n12:17 Comment: And understand where your opponent’s might break thinly.\n12:20 Comment: Jao Mario, pass to Bonega.\n12:23 Comment: Bonego further to the center on Icardi.\n12:25 Comment: Icardi is currently playing a mini-football pole.\n12:28 Comment: Turn right to Andreev.\n12:29 Comment: Transmission is dangerous.\n12:30 Comment: Icardi falls.\n12:31 Comment: But without the help of an opponent.\n12:34 Comment: Jao Mario.\n12:35 Comment: Inter has now pressed down, pinned down the opponent.\n12:37 Comment: Here is the Portuguese with the ball.\n12:39 Comment: Let me remind you that he is the European champion, by the way, this year.\n12:42 Comment: He was part of the Portuguese national team.\n12:43 Comment: And, by the way, one of the leaders of that team was.\n12:46 Comment: I think many people remember him from his performances in France.\n12:48 Comment: Miranda.\n12:49 Comment: Pass to Cristian Azalday.\n12:52 Comment: Well, in general, Sporting Lesbon is a real conveyor belt.\n12:55 Comment: By the presence of such quality players.\n12:58 Comment: All of Portugal.\n12:59 Comment: Yes, not only sporting.\n13:0 Comment: Also Benfica and Porto.\n13:2 Comment: Of course, in this sense, Portugal is put on a pedestal.\n13:6 Comment: Players who are very cool are then sold for big money.\n13:10 Comment: And this is Bonega's blow.\n13:12 Comment: Well, crazy trajectory.\n13:14 Comment: Notice that the ball barely spins.\n13:16 Comment: That is, such a pebble flew into the upper corner.\n13:20 Comment: Honest, but the Rimlins are lucky here.\n13:23 Comment: Roma's left flank is now involved.\n13:26 Comment: This is Diego Pirotti.\n13:28 Comment: Pass to Kevin Strotman.\n13:31 Comment: Strotman plays back.\n13:33 Comment: Derosi.\n13:34 Comment: Another pass to the left flank.\n13:36 Comment: Pirotti enters the penalty area.\n13:38 Comment: It hits with a turn.\n13:39 Comment: Well, he did everything right, except for the finishing blow.\n13:41 Comment: Ansaldi did not allow himself to be outplayed very easily.\n13:43 Comment: Such a slight movement to the side.\n13:48 Comment: An easy feint from Diego Pirotti.\n13:50 Comment: And Ansaldi is already left behind.\n13:52 Comment: We talked in detail about Inter's composition.\n13:55 Comment: Let's talk about Roma too.\n13:56 Comment: Because Roma has roster problems.\n13:58 Comment: Firstly, Rudiger, the central defender, is injured.\n14:1 Comment: Mario Rui also doesn't play.\n14:3 Comment: Vermallin is injured.\n14:4 Comment: Still important players for Roma.\n14:6 Comment: First of all, in the defensive line.\n14:8 Comment: But I will also note that I have changed the cast of Luciano Spalletti somewhat.\n14:12 Comment: Because in reserve, as I already said, is Nain Golan.\n14:16 Comment: This is an amazing decision by Nain Golan.\n14:18 Comment: Among the leading football players of Roma.\n14:20 Comment: There is also a very talented Argentine Leandro Paredes in the reserves.\n14:23 Comment: Who has a magnificent future knitted on his brain.\n14:26 Comment: Totti doesn't play.\n14:28 Comment: But this is already a familiar story.\n14:29 Comment: Totti is more of a 15-20 minute player at the end of the match.\n14:32 Comment: But El Sharaoui doesn’t play either.\n14:35 Comment: And of course the most important and interesting point.\n14:37 Comment: Position of Alexandro Florenzi.\n14:39 Comment: We are all accustomed to the fact that Florenzi is a human rights activist.\n14:41 Comment: And today Florenzi plays in the position of almost a three-quarter player.\n14:45 Comment: In Totti's position.\n14:46 Comment: That is, a football player, if translated from Italian.\n14:48 Comment: Who plays and comes up with attacks in front.\n14:51 Comment: Number 10 plays.\n14:55 Comment: Nobel came in nicely.\n14:56 Comment: Beautiful.\n14:57 Comment: Especially with an Italian accent.\n15:0 Comment: You do it best.\n15:4 Comment: With a ball.\n15:5 Comment: Yes, with the inter ball.\n15:6 Comment: Long pass attempt from Jason Murillo.\n15:10 Comment: Florenzi puts his foot out and the ball goes into touch.\n15:14 Comment: He quickly returns him to the game as an Inter football player.\n15:17 Comment: 15 minutes flew by literally like a blink.\n15:20 Comment: Harry Medel.\n15:22 Comment: Chile is looking for someone to make the pass to.\n15:25 Comment: Of the people who were separating Banega and Jao Mario, no one was nearby.\n15:30 Comment: Therefore, we had to play on the flank.\n15:32 Comment: Here is Jao Mario.\n15:35 Comment: Another pass to the right flank.\n15:36 Comment: Ansaldi.\n15:37 Comment: Again Jao Mario with the ball.\n15:38 Comment: Three football players around him.\n15:40 Comment: Joan Jesus, by the way, is an ex-Inter football player.\n15:43 Comment: He understands this situation.\n15:45 Comment: And Luciano Spalecti throws up his hands.\n15:47 Comment: He's unhappy about something.\n15:48 Comment: How exactly is this going?\n15:50 Comment: He is unhappy that there was a foul on a Roma player.\n15:53 Comment: And it was necessary to defect him to Banega.\n15:56 Comment: According to Roma fans and according to Luciano Spalecti.\n15:59 Comment: Attack again through the right flank.\n16:1 Comment: And a serve over Manolus's head.\n16:3 Comment: Failed to make this flank cross.\n16:6 Comment: To the top of Ansaldi's flank.\n16:8 Comment: And note that so far Inter is attacking one-sidedly.\n16:12 Comment: Or there is a long passage through the center.\n16:15 Comment: Or immediately pass to the right to Ansaldi.\n16:17 Comment: And he already comes up with something through individual actions.\n16:20 Comment: The left flank is much less involved.\n16:23 Comment: And Santon practically doesn’t move forward.\n16:25 Comment: They write about this almost every day in Italy.\n16:27 Comment: What a very unbalanced team.\n16:29 Comment: Now inter.\n16:30 Comment: All in all, the composition is not bad.\n16:32 Comment: And there are really great performers.\n16:34 Comment: But for now the main problem is Deboer.\n16:36 Comment: He cannot build a game as such.\n16:40 Comment: Yes, it was wonderful, a wonderful, incomparable match against Juventus.\n16:44 Comment: When Inter lost 0-1, they won 2-1.\n16:47 Comment: But nevertheless, DeBoer is still criticized regularly.\n16:51 Comment: Here was Mohamed Salah's position of play.\n16:54 Comment: And here is this beautiful plan from the director.\n16:57 Comment: Once again it shows that even the judges take care of themselves here in Italy.\n17:2 Comment: Very careful in appearance.\n17:5 Comment: Well, how could it be otherwise?\n17:7 Comment: We already talked about this at the very beginning.\n17:10 Comment: With such a grin, he showed with his finger that he was offside.\n17:15 Comment: Referee from Leghorn Luca Banti.\n17:18 Comment: But in favor of Inter and again all the actions take place on the right flank of the attack.\n17:27 Comment: Varentsy returned.\n17:29 Comment: Jacko.\n17:30 Comment: Here Miranda played very well against him.\n17:34 Comment: Murillo.\n17:35 Comment: Harry Medel to the center.\n17:37 Comment: Jao Mario.\n17:38 Comment: Harry Medel again.\n17:39 Comment: And over there on the crossing.\n17:40 Comment: He was already tired of soaking his hands.\n17:42 Comment: Santon.\n17:45 Comment: Lost speed.\n17:46 Comment: Yes?\n17:47 Comment: The speeds are gone.\n17:48 Comment: But this is probably beneficial for Roma now, who is keeping score.\n17:51 Comment: And who of course plays more in defense.\n17:54 Comment: Hopes for quick counterattacks.\n17:56 Comment: Moreover, there are very fast football players.\n17:59 Comment: First of all, Salah.\n18:0 Comment: I think that if we take the football player’s ability to run with the ball.\n18:4 Comment: Then Salah is one of the best in the Italian series.\n18:7 Comment: Plus there is Pirotti and of course there is Florenz.\n18:10 Comment: Dzheko is heavy, but he has slightly different functions.\n18:14 Comment: Therefore, I think that Luciano in flight is happy with the current state of affairs.\n18:18 Comment: The team leads and the team defends more in the hope of counterattacks.\n18:22 Comment: Meanwhile.\n18:25 Comment: The twist kick is not entirely clear why Kandreva did it.\n18:28 Comment: Well, notice how the stadium reacts.\n18:30 Comment: Kostya has already stated this.\n18:31 Comment: Kandreva is an ex-footballer from Latso.\n18:33 Comment: Well, we know the relationship between Latso and Roma.\n18:36 Comment: Today, by the way, there was a very good turnout at the Olympic Stadium.\n18:40 Comment: It's rarely sold out here lately.\n18:43 Comment: For obvious reasons.\n18:46 Comment: And today there are more than 50 thousand.\n18:49 Comment: According to data from Italy.\n18:51 Comment: It's a great turnout.\n18:52 Comment: And there are few fans.\n18:53 Comment: I'll talk about this briefly.\n18:54 Comment: Because of the fans of Latso and Roma.\n18:57 Comment: And so they united in the opposition.\n18:59 Comment: There are serious disagreements with the City Hall of Rome.\n19:3 Comment: Which somewhat divided the sectors at the Olympic Stadium.\n19:6 Comment: And that’s why they’ve been on strike for the second year.\n19:8 Comment: Tifosi.\n19:9 Comment: Such true ultra fans.\n19:11 Comment: Roma and Latso against the city hall.\n19:14 Comment: This is precisely what accounts for the not-so-high attendance.\n19:17 Comment: More than 50 thousand is good attendance.\n19:20 Comment: Even for the Olympic Stadium.\n19:24 Comment: Murillo.\n19:26 Comment: Miranda.\n19:29 Comment: A very controversial decision.\n19:31 Comment: The intro bosses are assigned to Frank Debura.\n19:34 Comment: It seemed to me that he would still be able to come to an agreement with Giego Simeonov.\n19:38 Comment: Former player.\n19:39 Comment: But that's a different story.\n19:41 Comment: A separate story.\n19:42 Comment: But Frank Debura is still Dutch.\n19:44 Comment: And a coach from Holland.\n19:46 Comment: With your own approach to work.\n19:48 Comment: When you work with young people in Ajax.\n19:50 Comment: This is one story.\n19:52 Comment: And when you come to an ambitious team.\n19:54 Comment: Which wants to regain its former glory.\n19:57 Comment: And he wants to get back into the fight.\n19:58 Comment: For the highest places.\n20:0 Comment: In such a difficult championship.\n20:2 Comment: Like in series A.\n20:3 Comment: Transfer to Salah.\n20:4 Comment: Acceleration of Salah.\n20:5 Comment: One-on-one exit.\n20:6 Comment: And Salah doesn't score.\n20:8 Comment: Mohammed Salah.\n20:10 Comment: He really demonstrated his speed.\n20:13 Comment: But how did he not score?\n20:16 Comment: Konstantin.\n20:18 Comment: Jacko.\n20:19 Comment: Excellent pass into the lineout.\n20:21 Comment: I remember right away.\n20:22 Comment: How many chances did Roma have in the Champions League?\n20:24 Comment: When we played with Real Madrid.\n20:27 Comment: We lost both times by 0.2.\n20:29 Comment: Especially in the return match at the Bernabeu.\n20:31 Comment: Salah simply mocked Roma fans.\n20:35 Comment: Because time after time.\n20:37 Comment: He left the Real Madrid defense out in the cold all the time.\n20:39 Comment: But I couldn’t implement it one-on-one.\n20:41 Comment: And now.\n20:42 Comment: Another one.\n20:43 Comment: Give it back.\n20:44 Comment: Give it to Jacko.\n20:45 Comment: Since you can't do it.\n20:46 Comment: Hit.\n20:47 Comment: My God.\n20:48 Comment: What save did you make now?\n20:49 Comment: Samir Handanovich.\n20:50 Comment: Now this hit was from a long distance.\n20:54 Comment: Roma.\n20:55 Comment: What are you doing?\n20:56 Comment: You play on your nerves.\n20:57 Comment: On the thin strings of his fans.\n21:0 Comment: How could it be possible not to realize these moments now?\n21:3 Comment: This is Roma.\n21:5 Comment: This is a series.\n21:6 Comment: And now the main thing is to fight back.\n21:7 Comment: Peresic.\n21:8 Comment: The blows here are already fair.\n21:10 Comment: This is already fair.\n21:11 Comment: It wasn't that dangerous to save your team.\n21:13 Comment: From the outside.\n21:14 Comment: At least.\n21:15 Comment: Anyway.\n21:16 Comment: Inter is attacking.\n21:17 Comment: Ansaladin is back with the ball.\n21:18 Comment: Pass to Antonio Condrevo.\n21:19 Comment: Italian national team player.\n21:20 Comment: What will it do?\n21:21 Comment: Probably right now.\n21:22 Comment: No.\n21:23 Comment: The heel plays Icardi.\n21:24 Comment: The one on the flank.\n21:25 Comment: Icardi serve.\n21:26 Comment: If only there was such a pitch for him.\n21:27 Comment: He most likely would have scored.\n21:28 Comment: But there is no penalty there.\n21:29 Comment: And this is Bonega.\n21:30 Comment: Beautiful Bonega.\n21:31 Comment: Another shot.\n21:32 Comment: How hard it is for brother Roma.\n21:33 Comment: Listen.\n21:34 Comment: This is the nerve.\n21:35 Comment: This is the degree.\n21:36 Comment: These are the emotions of Italian football.\n21:38 Comment: What a period in football it was now.\n21:39 Comment: As we like to say.\n21:40 Comment: Because two sons are crazy.\n21:41 Comment: Two rescues for crazy people.\n21:42 Comment: From Handanovic and right there in the game.\n21:43 Comment: Wojciech is honest.\n21:44 Comment: Joa Mario.\n21:45 Comment: Picks up the ball.\n21:46 Comment: Plays backwards.\n21:47 Comment: Salakhov.\n21:48 Comment: Literally, like a belt rushing past a beggar.\n21:49 Comment: Yes.\n21:50 Comment: You understand.\n21:51 Comment: This is the nerve.\n22:3 Comment: Salakhov.\n22:4 Comment: Literally, like a belt rushing past a beggar.\n22:5 Comment: Yes.\n22:6 Comment: From an opponent.\n22:7 Comment: I told you about his speed.\n22:8 Comment: He runs the fastest with the ball in the Italian series.\n22:10 Comment: But this is just in time to talk about Frank de Boer.\n22:13 Comment: Yes.\n22:14 Comment: After all, there is football without towers in Holland.\n22:17 Comment: No crazy stuff.\n22:18 Comment: They don't build a defense there.\n22:19 Comment: They are building an attack there.\n22:21 Comment: In the Italian series ai this is not possible.\n22:23 Comment: Absolutely not.\n22:24 Comment: But in general there is a long story about how de Boer ended up at Inter.\n22:27 Comment: Now there is a big restructuring at Inter.\n22:29 Comment: Inter has new owners.\n22:31 Comment: Chinese investor.\n22:32 Comment: One of the largest companies in China, Suning.\n22:34 Comment: And what’s interesting is that the decision will be made by de Boer.\n22:37 Comment: Moreover, in August, when the series was about two weeks away from the start, it was not the Suning company that hosted it, but the former owner of the club.\n22:44 Comment: This is Eric Thohir.\n22:45 Comment: He is still not the best team president for the rest of the year.\n22:47 Comment: But this is all very, very difficult.\n22:49 Comment: Things are so Italian inside.\n22:51 Comment: Inter club affairs inside.\n22:53 Comment: Therefore, of course, de Boer has a very difficult situation.\n22:56 Comment: Therefore, the result must prove that he should continue to work with this team.\n23:2 Comment: Baneyaga.\n23:4 Comment: Long pass.\n23:5 Comment: Not accurate, unless, of course, he wanted to make a pass to the Polish goalkeeper.\n23:10 Comment: Derosi.\n23:12 Comment: Derosi, who was mercilessly criticized.\n23:15 Comment: All September and, naturally, August.\n23:17 Comment: It was largely because of Derosie that Roma did not qualify for the Champions League in the group stage.\n23:22 Comment: Yes, there were two deletions.\n23:24 Comment: And there is absolutely no need for them.\n23:26 Comment: Derosi was simply the first to leave.\n23:28 Comment: Well, the second Remerson was also ironclad.\n23:31 Comment: Salah managed to push the ball through.\n23:33 Comment: Now there will be a gold card.\n23:35 Comment: Yes, Davides Anton.\n23:37 Comment: And Sulukobante is absolutely right.\n23:40 Comment: But how much faster, of course, is Mohamed Salah.\n23:42 Comment: Still, against Roma, play so high towards the center of the field...\n23:47 Comment: Is it dangerous.\n23:48 Comment: It's really very dangerous to play against Salah.\n23:51 Comment: Because he’ll probably even put anyone on his shoulders with Antona.\n23:56 Comment: And with him, Murile will still be able to overtake Jason.\n24:0 Comment: Well, how are they...\n24:2 Comment: This is the second time, when I came out at an angle,\n24:4 Comment: there was a pass to Jack.\n24:6 Comment: The director doesn’t even have time to show you and me a replay.\n24:11 Comment: But he’s just greedy, Kostya.\n24:13 Comment: Greedy?\n24:14 Comment: Greedy.\n24:15 Comment: Well, why didn’t he pass?\n24:16 Comment: I wanted to score myself.\n24:18 Comment: What about the interests of the team?\n24:20 Comment: Tournament table.\n24:50 Comment: Returning to Facio.\n25:16 Comment: A very dubious candidate for the central defender position.\n25:20 Comment: Especially in such...\n25:26 Comment: In such a fast team as Roma.\n25:29 Comment: Why? Because Fazio is a bomb in his garden.\n25:33 Comment: A person who can bring himself to a level place.\n25:36 Comment: Already brought it.\n25:37 Comment: Already? It already happened.\n25:38 Comment: In the first match for Sevilla last season, he was loaned and returned, so to speak.\n25:43 Comment: Seville, since it didn’t work out against Tottenham.\n25:46 Comment: In the first match, in the 25th minute, he received two yellow cards and was sent off.\n25:50 Comment: Well, I’ll just add that Roma has a problem in defense.\n25:53 Comment: Rudiger is injured and will be ready for the 10th round.\n25:56 Comment: And another Roma acquisition is also injured.\n25:59 Comment: This is Vermaline.\n26:0 Comment: Defender from Barcelona.\n26:1 Comment: It's rented.\n26:2 Comment: He played many matches in Barcelona.\n26:4 Comment: Well, status.\n26:5 Comment: Barcelona.\n26:6 Comment: For how many titles he took.\n26:8 Comment: Yes, from Barcelona.\n26:9 Comment: Well, he's injured too, anyway.\n26:11 Comment: Of course, two central defenders cannot play with the function of the calculated fourth on the list.\n26:16 Comment: And that's why Simon Oleson plays Facio, not Rudiger or Vermaline.\n26:22 Comment: Ansaldi nudged Diego Pirotti's back.\n26:24 Comment: We played good football in the first half of the first half.\n26:28 Comment: With Edin Jack's goal and three, four more, probably even more unrealized chances.\n26:35 Comment: Just two exits from Alakhat are worth it.\n26:37 Comment: And the ball hit the post after Banega's shot.\n26:41 Comment: And some good passes.\n26:43 Comment: In general, I think we are not bored.\n26:48 Comment: We're definitely not bored.\n26:49 Comment: Now Jesus will take the free kick.\n26:55 Comment: Inter is trying to put pressure.\n26:58 Comment: But Jesus plays quite simply on Kostas Manolas.\n27:3 Comment: One of the most reliable defenders of the Italian series of the last two years.\n27:7 Comment: And this is Bruno Perez moving to the center.\n27:10 Comment: Brazilian and good passing.\n27:12 Comment: True, Davido Santom is reliable in this situation.\n27:15 Comment: Again the Italian with the ball.\n27:19 Comment: And Dzeko Pirotti doesn’t play very well in this situation.\n27:24 Comment: Roma fails to get Banega to take possession of the ball.\n27:27 Comment: A good way out of the defense by Zhalvarin.\n27:29 Comment: He handled the ball in the wrong direction.\n27:30 Comment: Derosi works great here.\n27:32 Comment: But try to get close to him.\n27:34 Comment: Like a bear stood up and didn’t let anyone get to the ball.\n27:37 Comment: Salag Dzheko. Impact Handanovich.\n27:41 Comment: It was as if Handanovich was now catching a hot coal.\n27:47 Comment: And in the end, I still managed to record when it cooled down.\n27:52 Comment: Banega.\n27:53 Comment: Ever Banega. A very important figure in Inter Milan.\n27:57 Comment: Pass to the right flank. Christian Assaldi.\n28:0 Comment: Kondreva moves to the center.\n28:2 Comment: Antonio Condreva.\n28:3 Comment: And then pass to the left.\n28:7 Comment: And unsuccessfully.\n28:8 Comment: But what is Peresic? Torvadian Inter football player.\n28:12 Comment: The new owners, new investors of Inter will think about\n28:16 Comment: to return Masim Maradchik to his place as team president,\n28:19 Comment: who had already retired, as we remember, several years ago.\n28:23 Comment: Innings.\n28:24 Comment: And here the ball flies through Fazio and through Manolus.\n28:29 Comment: But Peresic did not have time to reach this flank overhang.\n28:34 Comment: And Masima Maradchika said that in the future the team will definitely be led by Diabe Semenovich.\n28:39 Comment: I have virtually no doubt that he will definitely come to Italy after the athletics.\n28:43 Comment: It is a well-known fact that Semenovich is definitely going to Italy.\n28:46 Comment: Moreover, by the way, let's congratulate him.\n28:48 Comment: It's unlikely that anyone will hear us.\n28:50 Comment: But today Diego Semen's son, Giovanni Semenovich, plays for the Genova team.\n28:56 Comment: Today he scored his second goal in the Italian Serie A in his debut season.\n29:1 Comment: How quickly other people's children grow up, Nobel.\n29:3 Comment: Yes.\n29:4 Comment: And for this reason, we note the following fact that Semenovich is very attached to Italy.\n29:10 Comment: And in general he believes that Italy has given him a lot both in life and in football.\n29:14 Comment: And plus his child plays here.\n29:16 Comment: I think that, of course, Semenovich will want to return.\n29:19 Comment: Where to return? Of course, at Inter, where he did a lot.\n29:22 Comment: These are the same mad eyes as we just saw in Luciano Spalletti.\n29:26 Comment: I think that many Roman fans do too after Mohamed Salah’s unrecorded moments.\n29:32 Comment: And the nervousness that exists in the Roma penalty area with every attack by Franco Debourg’s team.\n29:40 Comment: Angular.\n29:41 Comment: Frank Deboer sits somewhat sadly on the bench.\n29:45 Comment: Worth Aver Banega.\n29:46 Comment: The Argentine midfielder is about to serve into the opponent's penalty area.\n29:51 Comment: We are half an hour behind us in Rome.\n29:54 Comment: Innings.\n29:55 Comment: And here, who touches the ball, in my opinion, the Roma player did it.\n29:58 Comment: Now the corner from the opposite flank is Daniel Ederosi.\n30:2 Comment: I was just on your screens.\n30:4 Comment: Surprisingly similar to Garrick Kharlamov.\n30:8 Comment: Their fighter is honest.\n30:9 Comment: Jao Mario commands his defense.\n30:11 Comment: Ansaldi.\n30:12 Comment: Innings.\n30:13 Comment: And here none of the guys, I almost said, are in dark uniform, but Roma is playing in dark uniform today.\n30:20 Comment: There was no black uniform, but Bruno Perez was already here.\n30:31 Comment: From the side.\n30:32 Comment: Inter are now attacking again.\n30:35 Comment: Inter did not have the best week because it was a Europa League match on Thursday.\n30:40 Comment: And Konstantin already spoke about this.\n30:42 Comment: Against Prague Sparta.\n30:43 Comment: Inter lost 1-3.\n30:44 Comment: And just like that, friends, listen.\n30:47 Comment: Inter lost in the first two rounds in the Europa League, not the most important tournament on the continent.\n30:53 Comment: Lost to Sparta and lost to Hapuel of Beirschel.\n30:56 Comment: Has zero points, or rather has no points.\n30:59 Comment: At the moment, there are two meetings with Authent ahead.\n31:2 Comment: Amazing.\n31:3 Comment: But if with Hapuel we played frankly with the second team, then with Sparta we were already close to the optimal outcome.\n31:8 Comment: An optimal exception.\n31:9 Comment: There is nowhere to go.\n31:10 Comment: By the way, I was in Israel on the very day when Inter played the Israeli champion Hapuel.\n31:17 Comment: And this was perceived as a victory for Hapuel in the Europa League in general.\n31:22 Comment: That is, it was in a tournament.\n31:24 Comment: Yes, in the tournament. It was a sensation.\n31:26 Comment: And they didn’t talk about it for very long, showing goals from different angles.\n31:29 Comment: But, in general, a victory at San Siro is truly a great event for an Israeli club.\n31:36 Comment: Inter plays the ball again from the corner mark.\n31:39 Comment: Peresic easily eliminated Salah.\n31:42 Comment: The transmission ends up in Florence.\n31:44 Comment: Another oats.\n31:45 Comment: Oh, Kondreva is alone here.\n31:48 Comment: Eh, Kondreva, Kondreva struck with his first touch.\n31:51 Comment: Perhaps it was the right decision.\n31:53 Comment: But not on a long journey.\n31:57 Comment: How is he so alone?\n31:59 Comment: Manoles is watching a movie.\n32:1 Comment: Derosi is watching a movie.\n32:2 Comment: Here Perotti came up and hoped that the movie was over and everyone else would deal with their own things.\n32:10 Comment: But, of course, you can’t play like that defensively.\n32:12 Comment: It's good that Kondreva didn't get hit.\n32:15 Comment: You know, it seems to me that everyone was focused on another Inter player.\n32:19 Comment: And it’s clear which one.\n32:20 Comment: Mauro Icardi is arguably the most fearsome striker currently in the Italian series.\n32:24 Comment: And even more dangerous than Gonzalo Higuain.\n32:26 Comment: Although today Gonzalo Higuain caught up with Icardi in terms of goals scored.\n32:31 Comment: Yes, I did a double.\n32:33 Comment: By the way, Mauro Icardi also scored a double when they played Empli.\n32:39 Comment: So here they are about the same.\n32:43 Comment: Well, as in a wonderful joke, let's compare the clocks.\n32:47 Comment: Yes, mine are worth ten thousand euros from you.\n32:51 Comment: You know, in Icardi’s justification, he said that Juvetus, before buying Higuain, offered Inter 50 million for Icardi.\n32:58 Comment: Inter refused.\n32:59 Comment: And already on the field, having received money from Juvetus, 90 million, 70 of them were offered to Inter for Icardi.\n33:6 Comment: Therefore, in principle, Icardi is six years younger than Higuain, if I’m not mistaken, five.\n33:11 Comment: And therefore, maybe he will catch up with Gonzalo Higuain in terms of transfer price.\n33:16 Comment: Well, it's a good investment.\n33:18 Comment: He is only 23 years old, but he is already the captain of Inter.\n33:21 Comment: And it plays really very brightly.\n33:23 Comment: Pass to Salah.\n33:24 Comment: This is where the first goal came from.\n33:26 Comment: Salah picked up the ball.\n33:27 Comment: Where is Bruno Perez?\n33:29 Comment: Tired.\n33:30 Comment: Bruno Perez did not support this attack.\n33:32 Comment: Salah made a free kick pass and was not accurate.\n33:35 Comment: Oh, what a mistake.\n33:36 Comment: Stratman.\n33:37 Comment: Pass to Diego Perotti.\n33:39 Comment: The Argentinean receives the ball.\n33:41 Comment: Will serve the penalty area.\n33:42 Comment: Good serve, but Samir Handanovic.\n33:45 Comment: Look, Stratman was absolutely alone.\n33:47 Comment: And Perotti had already lowered his head and hoped for Russian...\n33:51 Comment: Go for Jack.\n33:52 Comment: But Jack was ahead of Samir Handanovic.\n33:54 Comment: He is taller and primarily plays with his hands.\n33:56 Comment: Ansaldi moves to the center.\n33:58 Comment: Pass to Condreo.\n34:0 Comment: Condreo has a lot of, it seems to me, unnecessary movements.\n34:3 Comment: Not entirely thought out, perhaps.\n34:5 Comment: Although, of course, he is a great footballer.\n34:7 Comment: But today, it seems to me, it doesn’t suit him to play.\n34:12 Comment: Maybe.\n34:14 Comment: And into battle.\n34:15 Comment: Got him right in the face with Anton.\n34:16 Comment: Like in a shooting gallery, you know.\n34:17 Comment: Yes here...\n34:18 Comment: Well, it’s like knocking down a pin just now in bowling.\n34:22 Comment: Salah of this program with Anton.\n34:24 Comment: The head brought Zhisus to his gate.\n34:26 Comment: Condreo is nearby.\n34:27 Comment: Ansaldi.\n34:28 Comment: Condreo doesn't know what to do.\n34:29 Comment: Understands that it is better to play.\n34:31 Comment: Ansaldi back to Zhalmar.\n34:34 Comment: He's in the penalty area.\n34:35 Comment: There is a struggle here.\n34:37 Comment: Miranda lost.\n34:39 Comment: And Jacko away.\n34:40 Comment: Salah...\n34:43 Comment: Salah is dangerous.\n34:44 Comment: Then at speed he can really...\n34:47 Comment: And use pressure to gain the upper hand in confrontation with opponents.\n34:50 Comment: Condreo.\n34:51 Comment: Delivery to the far post.\n34:53 Comment: Peresic.\n34:54 Comment: The ball doesn't reach him.\n34:55 Comment: Harry Medel.\n34:56 Comment: And Peresic had already raised his leg to wave towards the goal.\n35:3 Comment: But Kostas Manolas acts reliably.\n35:6 Comment: Zhalmarya.\n35:7 Comment: Well, you can’t say that Inter is inferior in terms of performance.\n35:9 Comment: He's outscored.\n35:11 Comment: And according to the moment.\n35:13 Comment: There are more Roma moments, but we have already explained that.\n35:15 Comment: On the other side was Peresic's passage.\n35:17 Comment: There was a Condreo moment.\n35:18 Comment: Hit the post.\n35:19 Comment: Although yes, if you sum it all up.\n35:21 Comment: In principle, Inter also scored 100% of the goals.\n35:24 Comment: Another thing is that Roma, we remember, also has a barbell performed by Salah.\n35:28 Comment: And the exit of another Egyptian football player.\n35:31 Comment: Pass to Icardi.\n35:32 Comment: So far Ikard is not too noticeable.\n35:33 Comment: But on the other hand, you understand, Ikard is such a striker,\n35:36 Comment: who only needs one moment to score.\n35:38 Comment: He doesn't need much.\n35:39 Comment: You don't need to be at the epicenter of events every minute.\n35:45 Comment: Perote.\n35:47 Comment: This is a fall.\n35:48 Comment: Yes.\n35:49 Comment: Tackle from behind and yellow card from Christian Ansal.\n35:52 Comment: The first warning in our match.\n35:54 Comment: No no.\n35:55 Comment: There was already one.\n36:0 Comment: It was, it was.\n36:1 Comment: But what will you look like?\n36:3 Comment: Yes Yes.\n36:4 Comment: I am sorry.\n36:5 Comment: David Santon received a yellow card.\n36:8 Comment: The second card is for the Inter players.\n36:10 Comment: Moreover, pay attention, both are protective angels.\n36:13 Comment: What answer do you want to hear?\n36:17 Comment: Yes.\n36:18 Comment: So that you record it.\n36:19 Comment: Recorded.\n36:20 Comment: Two of the four defenders hang on the flank warning.\n36:24 Comment: Flanks.\n36:25 Comment: Faso.\n36:26 Comment: Jesus.\n36:29 Comment: In the center.\n36:30 Comment: Derosi is good.\n36:31 Comment: But touch.\n36:32 Comment: And then Stratman.\n36:33 Comment: It seems to me that I have chosen the right direction\n36:35 Comment: Kevin Stratman.\n36:36 Comment: All.\n36:37 Comment: No.\n36:38 Comment: But it seems to me that Derosya is doing well.\n36:40 Comment: But it seems to me that it’s almost there.\n36:43 Comment: He tried to put the ball directly into Jack's foot.\n36:46 Comment: And he had a corridor for his transmission.\n36:49 Comment: No, direction.\n36:50 Comment: Direction.\n36:51 Comment: Wrong, because I managed to intercept.\n36:53 Comment: Option.\n36:57 Comment: Joan Miranda.\n36:58 Comment: It was a good idea.\n37:0 Comment: But the execution let Kevin Stratman down.\n37:3 Comment: Kevin Stratman is now a first-team player for Roma.\n37:6 Comment: Although he had two very serious injuries.\n37:10 Comment: Moreover, injuries that often affect the careers of football players.\n37:14 Comment: He tore his ACL twice.\n37:16 Comment: And the same ones.\n37:18 Comment: And many believed that Stratman would end his football career altogether.\n37:21 Comment: But bravo Stratman, bravo Roma and the club’s doctors,\n37:26 Comment: who helped Stratman return to big-time football.\n37:30 Comment: He's quite young.\n37:31 Comment: He is 125 years old.\n37:32 Comment: Kevin Stratman.\n37:34 Comment: Ansaldi.\n37:36 Comment: This is a rare case when Perutti managed to return back\n37:40 Comment: and meet Ansaldi's face.\n37:43 Comment: The fans are buzzing because there is an intro player on the lawn.\n37:49 Comment: And it was, as you understand, Kondreva.\n37:51 Comment: That's why they buzz.\n37:53 Comment: It's Murillo, pass to Santon.\n37:56 Comment: Joa Mario.\n37:57 Comment: Joa Mario tries to take part in all attacks.\n38:0 Comment: He is the most important figure.\n38:1 Comment: Even though he has only been with the team since the end of August.\n38:4 Comment: He is not mistaken in the meantime and the map in a simple situation.\n38:6 Comment: And here he is Salah.\n38:7 Comment: That's his speed.\n38:8 Comment: Run Salah, run.\n38:11 Comment: Not that side.\n38:12 Comment: Got tangled up there in my legs and sword.\n38:14 Comment: Mohamed Salah in the center on Stratman.\n38:17 Comment: Here Perutti is absolutely alone.\n38:19 Comment: That's right Salah.\n38:20 Comment: The ball is transferred to him here.\n38:21 Comment: Perutti with a right shot into the far corner.\n38:25 Comment: This blow was coming.\n38:26 Comment: Well, it's painfully predictable.\n38:29 Comment: And I think that's the whole number.\n38:31 Comment: And the gate there is high level.\n38:32 Comment: Let's note that Samir Khondanovich.\n38:34 Comment: Well, come on, you know.\n38:36 Comment: I wouldn't save it.\n38:37 Comment: Hondanovic wouldn't have saved it.\n38:40 Comment: But this couple, of course, Perutti and Ansaldi are giving each other some frolic today.\n38:48 Comment: Perutti does not always return back and now through the Ansaldi zone.\n38:52 Comment: Roma’s attack also looked dangerous.\n38:56 Comment: Medel.\n38:58 Comment: Banega.\n38:59 Comment: Pass to the right flank.\n39:0 Comment: Ansaldi is here.\n39:4 Comment: Joe Mario handled the ball poorly.\n39:6 Comment: Stratman does not allow the Portuguese to get to the ball.\n39:10 Comment: And here it is in favor of Roma.\n39:12 Comment: Five minutes until the break.\n39:16 Comment: Those 40 minutes flew by.\n39:19 Comment: It's simple how.\n39:21 Comment: I don't know.\n39:23 Comment: The wind cleared away the leaves even in autumn weather.\n39:27 Comment: And please.\n39:29 Comment: Like a snap of fingers.\n39:31 Comment: The first half is almost behind us.\n39:33 Comment: High-quality football at the Olimpico Murillo stage.\n39:36 Comment: But marriage is still too much, I agree.\n39:41 Comment: In such simple situations.\n39:43 Comment: When nothing is allowed.\n39:45 Comment: These are individual mistakes made by defenders.\n39:47 Comment: First of all, this happened especially at the beginning of the match.\n39:49 Comment: But very good pace.\n39:50 Comment: Really very good pace.\n39:52 Comment: And football tries to play both teams.\n39:55 Comment: Dorossi.\n39:57 Comment: Long pass forward.\n39:58 Comment: And Mohamed Salah was no longer there.\n40:0 Comment: Murillo.\n40:4 Comment: To Handanovich.\n40:6 Comment: Transfer 0-0.\n40:7 Comment: Let's go back to the spares again.\n40:10 Comment: Break is coming soon.\n40:12 Comment: Let me remind you that Inter have Palacio in reserve.\n40:15 Comment: There is Kondakbia.\n40:16 Comment: There is Filippo Mello.\n40:17 Comment: Eder.\n40:18 Comment: Gabriel Barbosa.\n40:19 Comment: Everyone is especially looking forward to it.\n40:21 Comment: As part of Inter.\n40:22 Comment: And of course Stefan Jovicic.\n40:24 Comment: Also on the bench.\n40:25 Comment: At Roma El Sharaoui's.\n40:26 Comment: Totti and Turbo Paredes.\n40:28 Comment: And Nain Golan.\n40:29 Comment: People who can come out and strengthen Roma's squad without a doubt.\n40:32 Comment: Florenzi, meanwhile, hits the goal.\n40:34 Comment: And how does Florence beat?\n40:36 Comment: How does Florence hit?\n40:37 Comment: Unsuccessful.\n40:38 Comment: Alessandro had a great opportunity to score.\n40:41 Comment: But how did he get through?\n40:43 Comment: To your question, how does Florence hit, he hits poorly.\n40:46 Comment: Now Jesus’ pass was really in the right direction.\n40:50 Comment: And Florence, without looking at the goal, simply relying on the force of the strike, sent the ball past the near corner.\n40:59 Comment: Of course, you could have played, tried to play more cunningly, it seems to me, Alessandro.\n41:6 Comment: Now Inter attack.\n41:9 Comment: Santon on the left flank receives the ball from Peresic.\n41:12 Comment: Santon na Banega.\n41:16 Comment: There's nothing here.\n41:17 Comment: Back.\n41:18 Comment: Inter have a lot of academic play in midfield.\n41:21 Comment: The team doesn't explode.\n41:23 Comment: This is a good pass.\n41:24 Comment: Ansaldi crosses.\n41:25 Comment: So where is Icardi?\n41:27 Comment: Icardi, a striker of this level, should.\n41:30 Comment: And it helps here.\n41:32 Comment: This is the moment.\n41:34 Comment: This is an honest army.\n41:36 Comment: Stop the planet, I will step off.\n41:38 Comment: This is top level football.\n41:40 Comment: Look how cool Ansaldi is here.\n41:42 Comment: But we have to jump out, of course, Icardi was here.\n41:45 Comment: Icardi, as much as 100%.\n41:46 Comment: Well, then Kondreva finally struck the ball the right way.\n41:49 Comment: Hit the far corner.\n41:50 Comment: But the honest troops were good.\n41:52 Comment: One more serve.\n41:53 Comment: And Miranda doesn’t score here.\n41:55 Comment: Brazilian Miranda doesn't score.\n41:58 Comment: I already wanted, honestly, friends, to shout Go.\n42:2 Comment: But I didn't want to.\n42:3 Comment: I wanted too much.\n42:4 Comment: Changed my mind logic.\n42:5 Comment: Yes, because the ball went close to the post.\n42:7 Comment: Serve pereshich.\n42:8 Comment: Great shot.\n42:10 Comment: Good too.\n42:11 Comment: Also, no, a good shot is when the ball flutters in the net.\n42:14 Comment: And this is a good try from Miranda.\n42:20 Comment: But the ball goes wide of the goal.\n42:22 Comment: In a good way.\n42:24 Comment: 2-2.\n42:25 Comment: Yes, Roma and Inter should have played the first half like Zenica did with Spartak.\n42:29 Comment: 2-2, I told you so.\n42:30 Comment: On Petrovsky, yes.\n42:31 Comment: And note that so far there have been no mistakes on the part of the referee.\n42:34 Comment: Jacko.\n42:37 Comment: Impact Ihandanovich.\n42:39 Comment: Don't stop the game please.\n42:42 Comment: It's a shame there's a break.\n42:43 Comment: It's a pity that the half lasts 45 minutes.\n42:45 Comment: The teams got so fired up and excited.\n42:49 Comment: The last few minutes, look, moment by moment.\n42:52 Comment: Dzeko easily, just like a pioneer, removes Zhao Miranda from the road,\n42:57 Comment: not just anyone, but a Brazilian defender, a national team player, after all.\n43:1 Comment: And just like that, Ihandanovic hits the bottom corner.\n43:4 Comment: This is the captain of the Brazilian national team.\n43:6 Comment: I do not remember.\n43:8 Comment: I remember Miranda, the captain of the Brazilian national team.\n43:10 Comment: But it's not that important.\n43:11 Comment: He is a player who started the squad of five-time world champions.\n43:14 Comment: Jao Mario, pass to the right flank.\n43:16 Comment: Ansaldi.\n43:18 Comment: Once again Perote managed to take his place in defense.\n43:22 Comment: Stroatman counterattack.\n43:23 Comment: There is still a minute and a half to play in the first half.\n43:25 Comment: There was also a pause while assistance was provided.\n43:28 Comment: Jacko.\n43:29 Comment: This is where you need to move the ball.\n43:31 Comment: Derosie Stroatman would be a good idea to try.\n43:35 Comment: What do the football players show there, that you need to kick the ball into touch.\n43:39 Comment: They shouted to Kostya Somanov.\n43:41 Comment: Ansaldi has problems.\n43:44 Comment: He fell on the lawn during Inter's last attack.\n43:46 Comment: Here, look.\n43:47 Comment: When he went to beat Stroatman.\n43:49 Comment: And he may have been seriously injured.\n43:52 Comment: He is holding his knee.\n43:54 Comment: He had problems last season.\n43:57 Comment: And he missed the start of this.\n44:0 Comment: Well, this is the reaction and emotions of Edin Dzeko.\n44:3 Comment: Bosnian striker when he failed to beat Samir Handanovic.\n44:8 Comment: How many moments, how many episodes, how many chances for the players of Roma and Inter.\n44:14 Comment: Yes, it’s moments like these that you realize that it’s a shame that the half lasts 45 minutes.\n44:22 Comment: Because this pause, of course, is now...\n44:25 Comment: It will kill emotions.\n44:26 Comment: Yes, he will kill.\n44:27 Comment: And all this will subside, and all this will go away.\n44:29 Comment: And the diaphragm will go down eventually.\n44:32 Comment: And having already caught your breath with breaks, maybe the coach will make some adjustments.\n44:38 Comment: And the coach. I think that now coaches, despite the fact that they, of course, have painted over football,\n44:41 Comment: but I think that even to the Burmese degree, and the sports fans will definitely say, play more carefully.\n44:46 Comment: Behind, in the baron, because we still want to win today.\n44:50 Comment: Roma needs a win today.\n44:52 Comment: And this is more important than colorful football for the whole world.\n44:57 Comment: Kondreva with the ball.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: The team, since Inter has Samir Handanovic No. 1 in goal, then 15th Christian Assaldi plays defense on the right, David Isanton No. 21 on the left, 2 central defenders 25th Miranda, 24th Murillo.\n0:14 Comment: There are 3 players in the center of the field, 19th Bonega, 6th Joa Mario and 17th Harry Midelli and, finally, the attack group. The right inside attacking winger is played by, whatever you want to call, Antonio Kondreeva No. 87, on the left is Ivan Peresic No. 44 and the impact forward No. 9 in all respects, only on the T-shirt, this is Mauro Icardi, captain of Inter, the top scorer before this round of the Italian series.\n0:42 Comment: Well, maybe it’s not accepted that way now.\n0:44 Comment: I can’t say because it’s a cliché, but, nevertheless, perhaps the game is going for 3 results, even despite the fact that while Roma is keeping score, because you are absolutely right, Inter can still return to this game and turn the tide meetings.\n0:59 Comment: Woyzeck Honest, one of Roma's heroes in the first half as number one in defense. Kosta Smanova, 44th and Federico Fazio, 20th pair of central defenders.\n1:12 Comment: On the right is the author of assist 13.\n1:14 Comment: Bruno Perez on the left, Jesus No. 3 in the support zone of Daniel Desrosy, captain of the team 16.\n1:20 Comment: Next to him is Kevin Strotman, 6th, and a little higher is Alexandro Florenzi, 24th.\n1:25 Comment: On the flanks of the attack are Mohammed Salah, 11th on the right, on the left is Diego Perotti, 8th.\n1:31 Comment: And Bosnian Edin Dzhekon No. 9 is the author of the only goal scored.\n1:38 Comment: Luciano Spalletti, head coach of Roma.\n1:41 Comment: Inter has Frank Deboer as a coach.\n1:44 Comment: Teams, as for the referee, he is Luca Banti, two yellow cards, Davidos Anton and Christian Ansalov.\n1:52 Comment: The Inter defenders received them in the first half.\n1:55 Comment: There are fears that the second half will be less exciting, less eventful,\n1:59 Comment: because the break really seemed to let the air out, yes,\n2:3 Comment: you can find the following analogy, this is how air is deflated from a balloon,\n2:8 Comment: but also for sub-ball players, this air and emotions can leave, because they have just accelerated,\n2:14 Comment: just caught the right tempo, rhythm, electric currents,\n2:20 Comment: Such are the correct currents of this match, the players, as, unfortunately, the time for the whistle for half-time has come.\n2:27 Comment: But perhaps these fears are unfounded.\n2:30 Comment: Let's see, now Roma attacked well, and Salah is again good at tackling the ball in the opponent's half of the field.\n2:36 Comment: Kevin Strotman plays on the left flank, here Diego Perrotti moves to the center, looking for opportunities to hit Strotman.\n2:44 Comment: This is the trick, yes, Diego Perrotti should move to the middle and send the ball into the far corner with a dribbling kick from his right foot.\n2:50 Comment: He tried it several times in the first half, and...\n2:54 Comment: It worked once.\n2:55 Comment: Once he really came very close to punishing Inter.\n2:59 Comment: Samir Handanovic throws the ball in with his hand, and it’s unsuccessful.\n3:2 Comment: He threw it far towards the center of the field, but right on the head of Kevin Strotman.\n3:7 Comment: This is Bruno Perez.\n3:8 Comment: Played by Kevin Strotman.\n3:11 Comment: Replacements... Yes, there are no replacements yet, but Billy said it right,\n3:14 Comment: that Yuta Nagotoma is warming up.\n3:16 Comment: Maybe Roma, of course, will have Francesco Totti,\n3:21 Comment: but Nobel gave him about 15-20 minutes in the second half.\n3:25 Comment: It's not me who determined it, I want Totti to play more.\n3:27 Comment: Don't think that I am against Francesco Totti.\n3:29 Comment: This was determined long ago by Lucha Los Paletti.\n3:32 Comment: The time has long been determined by this.\n3:34 Comment: Or like this.\n3:36 Comment: Or so, because Totti is 40 years old.\n3:37 Comment: By the way, there really was a big celebration in Rome in honor of Francesco Totti’s 40th birthday.\n3:42 Comment: If he appears on the field, I will certainly...\n3:44 Comment: I'll tell you some details of his birthday.\n3:46 Comment: Because you were there.\n3:47 Comment: I wasn't, unfortunately.\n3:48 Comment: You were there, Nobel.\n3:49 Comment: I was not.\n3:51 Comment: Do not be shy.\n3:52 Comment: Pass to the center to Maura Icardi.\n3:54 Comment: The pair of defenders Federico Fassi and Kostas Manolas are still very confident against Icardi.\n4:0 Comment: And Icardi, by and large, didn’t have a single moment in today’s match.\n4:5 Comment: But there was a moment when Icardi had to act like a top player and chew the ball with meat,\n4:13 Comment: who walked...\n4:14 Comment: By the goalkeeper.\n4:16 Comment: Woyzeck disappeared after Christian Ansaldi's cross.\n4:19 Comment: But somewhere there he hid behind Manolas Icardi.\n4:22 Comment: And I didn’t get to the ball.\n4:25 Comment: Perez throws from behind the side to Jack.\n4:28 Comment: Brazilian Bruno Perez is with the ball again.\n4:30 Comment: One more pass back.\n4:32 Comment: And here Kostas Manolas is the goalkeeper.\n4:35 Comment: Woyzeck disappeared, who was really good in the first half.\n4:38 Comment: And twice he saved his team from a difficult situation.\n4:41 Comment: Salah.\n4:43 Comment: Mohamed Salah.\n4:44 Comment: Speeds up, maybe a free kick.\n4:46 Comment: Pass.\n4:47 Comment: Salah would also like to have an intellect like Francesco Totti.\n4:52 Comment: Yes, although such intelligence is not for sale.\n4:55 Comment: Even for rent.\n4:56 Comment: In general, this is a piece goods.\n4:57 Comment: But Salah, in addition to his speed, would like to add a little more cunning to him.\n5:3 Comment: So far everything is very predictable and programmed by Mohammed.\n5:8 Comment: This is where he was making this transfer now.\n5:10 Comment: There was no one there in burgundy uniform at all.\n5:13 Comment: Fasio.\n5:14 Comment: Center.\n5:15 Comment: Dorosi.\n5:15 Comment: Fine.\n5:16 Comment: It's good here too.\n5:17 Comment: If only Salah had fled there, and not Florence.\n5:21 Comment: Something is missing somewhere in Roma, right, Kostya?\n5:24 Comment: Looks like the composition is excellent.\n5:26 Comment: It seems that every football player has his own advantages.\n5:28 Comment: But the puzzle is not yet complete.\n5:30 Comment: Although at times Roma plays beautifully.\n5:33 Comment: And, in fact, Roma, if not for this failure in response to the match against Porto.\n5:38 Comment: Let me remind you that Roma lost 0-3 in response to the Champions League qualifying game.\n5:42 Comment: And he dropped out of the tournament.\n5:44 Comment: Chart would be nice.\n5:45 Comment: For Roma, without the Champions League, of course, it’s a little difficult.\n5:47 Comment: But now they ran, ran to their gates.\n5:50 Comment: Peresic.\n5:50 Comment: In my opinion, Peresic had a good idea.\n5:53 Comment: That's where Antonio Condreva ran on a parallel course.\n5:56 Comment: But Peresic did not turn this planned transfer onto his partner.\n6:2 Comment: But they turned around again, noticed, yes, facing Rom.\n6:5 Comment: And when the team from the center of the field is built like this,\n6:10 Comment: that is, excuse me, sometimes the herd, yes, runs back.\n6:14 Comment: And it catches up with the attack, which means there was something wrong somewhere.\n6:18 Comment: Well, in general, Roma has a reserve in the middle of the field.\n6:21 Comment: I emphasized it and will say it again.\n6:24 Comment: Rajan Aingolan is in reserve.\n6:26 Comment: And this is Peresic.\n6:27 Comment: I tried to handle the ball well, but it didn’t work out.\n6:31 Comment: Perez on the right flank.\n6:32 Comment: Dzeko was unable to play against Salak with one touch.\n6:35 Comment: Jacko stopped.\n6:37 Comment: Derosi captain.\n6:38 Comment: Roma, he actually has the nickname captain futuro.\n6:41 Comment: In translation, Stalyansky future captain.\n6:44 Comment: He can end his career so that Derosi can become the current captain.\n6:47 Comment: But this is not bad.\n6:48 Comment: Lumbago.\n6:50 Comment: Leg tripped by Zhao Miranda.\n6:52 Comment: And Inter has the ball again.\n6:55 Comment: The game goes on without a middle ground.\n6:57 Comment: This is where the support zone for some and for others absolutely sags, yes.\n7:1 Comment: Derosi is impeccable.\n7:3 Comment: A tackle, a pure tackle.\n7:5 Comment: Italian tackle.\n7:6 Comment: Italian tackle in the style of Italian football.\n7:9 Comment: And now Mirotti is moving to the center.\n7:11 Comment: It hits with a turn.\n7:12 Comment: Handanovich drags.\n7:13 Comment: And this time.\n7:14 Comment: Mirotti shot not into the far corner, but into the near one.\n7:16 Comment: I wanted to outwit Slavyantsyn, but it didn’t work out.\n7:18 Comment: With the ball Inter in the center.\n7:20 Comment: Jao Mario is absolutely alone.\n7:21 Comment: Jao Mario runs again, Strotman runs.\n7:24 Comment: Here on a parallel course next to Peresic.\n7:27 Comment: Peresic receives a pass from Bruno Perez.\n7:29 Comment: Opposite him is Peresic in the far corner.\n7:31 Comment: And Honest helps out.\n7:32 Comment: To repeat the first half, there is now one attack on Handanovic’s goal.\n7:37 Comment: Here is Inter's answer.\n7:38 Comment: And there are already eight Honest in the game.\n7:41 Comment: Moreover, mind you, the flank players were hitting.\n7:43 Comment: Perotti is there.\n7:44 Comment: Again, on the left flank.\n7:45 Comment: And here on the left flank, however, it’s a little different.\n7:48 Comment: Ivan Peresic.\n7:49 Comment: Do you know which particular book is the most interesting?\n7:52 Comment: Such a big fat volume, yes, where the pages are turned one after another.\n7:56 Comment: You read it, this attack.\n7:58 Comment: Immediately another attack began.\n8:0 Comment: And you get more and more interesting.\n8:1 Comment: What will there be a corner here again?\n8:3 Comment: Did one of the Roma players touch the ball or not?\n8:5 Comment: Well, this is a tackle.\n8:7 Comment: Children, guys from children's and youth football schools.\n8:10 Comment: See how to make tackles, as I just demonstrated\n8:13 Comment: Peter.\n8:14 Comment: Daniel Ederosi.\n8:18 Comment: Roma fans.\n8:21 Comment: Manolas's hairstyle, yes, I think, hurt me a little.\n8:23 Comment: No.\n8:24 Comment: In my opinion, it was not touched by the refereeing team.\n8:27 Comment: Here Manolas went for two with the ball and beat two.\n8:30 Comment: But there were some problems with the transmission.\n8:32 Comment: Although there was a rebound.\n8:33 Comment: Yes, ricochet.\n8:34 Comment: Yes, and he tripped me up.\n8:36 Comment: Kostya Manolas, by the way, is one of Roma’s main assets.\n8:39 Comment: Let me remind you that Antonio Conte really wanted to buy him in the summer.\n8:43 Comment: Hondon Chelsea.\n8:44 Comment: But Roma was categorical.\n8:45 Comment: Neither Manolas nor Nine Holland sold their chels.\n8:49 Comment: Considering that Roma has the most serious ambitions.\n8:52 Comment: And there is no reason to sell your leaders to England.\n8:58 Comment: Out again.\n9:0 Comment: And again in favor of Roma.\n9:2 Comment: And I would note the work of Luca Banti.\n9:4 Comment: Lets you fight, lets you play.\n9:7 Comment: And these extra whistles are gone.\n9:10 Comment: That's why the game looks good.\n9:12 Comment: Yes, absolutely correct.\n9:14 Comment: And by the way, I noticed that the referee depends a lot in Italian football.\n9:19 Comment: Especially where there is very contact football.\n9:21 Comment: And when you let it play, you only increase the pace of the game.\n9:24 Comment: So bravo Luca Banti.\n9:26 Comment: He's good today.\n9:27 Comment: Bye.\n9:28 Comment: For now, yes.\n9:28 Comment: Let's not run ahead of the locomotive.\n9:31 Comment: And in the end still play for more than 30 minutes.\n9:36 Comment: Salah.\n9:38 Comment: Davides Anton meets him.\n9:40 Comment: Salah.\n9:41 Comment: Transfer to the left flank.\n9:43 Comment: Where did you just come from?\n9:43 Comment: The ball came to Salah.\n9:46 Comment: Perotti again.\n9:47 Comment: Feed to the center again.\n9:49 Comment: The task, of course, is to kill Miranda with the Sting.\n9:51 Comment: Not easy, by the way.\n9:52 Comment: He is very tall and jumpy.\n9:55 Comment: Football player.\n9:55 Comment: This is Bonega.\n9:56 Comment: He can speed up the game.\n9:58 Comment: But a bad, bad pass.\n10:0 Comment: Over Peresic, Kevin Strotman was right there.\n10:5 Comment: Strotman failed to win the ball for Roma.\n10:9 Comment: Strotman believed that the ball touched Peresic here.\n10:12 Comment: But.\n10:13 Comment: In fact.\n10:15 Comment: This is wrong.\n10:16 Comment: Out.\n10:19 Comment: With Anton.\n10:20 Comment: Miranda.\n10:26 Comment: Saldi.\n10:27 Comment: Pass to the right flank.\n10:28 Comment: Like Andreeva.\n10:30 Comment: Zhou Mario.\n10:33 Comment: Portuguese with the ball.\n10:35 Comment: Indeed, he joined Inter.\n10:36 Comment: Agree, Kostya, it’s hard to imagine Inter in midfield without him.\n10:40 Comment: And, by the way, he seated Jefric Delbia on the benches.\n10:43 Comment: And, of course, he had a football player from France.\n10:47 Comment: Who played quite successfully for Monaco and Seville, if I'm not mistaken.\n10:52 Comment: But not everything is going well for Victor.\n10:54 Comment: Well, he only spent a year with Sevilla when he really showed his worth.\n10:58 Comment: It was later sold for good money in Monaco.\n11:3 Comment: Here in Monaco he has already matured.\n11:7 Comment: And another strike from long range matured.\n11:11 Comment: It's Ever Bonega hitting again.\n11:13 Comment: He did better in the first half.\n11:15 Comment: But this time the ball went wide of the goal.\n11:18 Comment: The team played for just over ten minutes in the second half.\n11:22 Comment: And this is a beautiful gear five.\n11:25 Comment: From the same Ever Bonega.\n11:32 Comment: Go ahead, Jacko!\n11:34 Comment: He wins the fight.\n11:36 Comment: I already said that Dzeko failed last season.\n11:38 Comment: But, you know, you can just type into YouTube about Mahi Dzheko.\n11:41 Comment: You can laugh there.\n11:42 Comment: He was in battle until the morning.\n11:43 Comment: Today, from those moments, he did not score, did not convert\n11:48 Comment: scoring episodes.\n11:49 Comment: But in the end I managed.\n11:50 Comment: By the way, Luciano Spalletti, when he was asked in the summer,\n11:53 Comment: who is your main acquisition on the market in attacks,\n11:57 Comment: he said we already have it.\n11:59 Comment: This is Jacko.\n12:0 Comment: I'm working with him for the first full ball of the season.\n12:3 Comment: I collect it, it will add more.\n12:4 Comment: He will improve and will score.\n12:6 Comment: Spalletti did not deceive.\n12:7 Comment: Indeed, five goals scored.\n12:8 Comment: This is a good statistic for a striker literally behind\n12:9 Comment: one and a half seasons.\n12:10 Comment: And it's very nice.\n12:11 Comment: Yes, by the seventh round it was almost on average per game.\n12:16 Comment: Moreover, today there is still time for Dzeko to excel.\n12:22 Comment: What is Luca Banti?\n12:23 Comment: The ball is in play.\n12:26 Comment: Game continues.\n12:27 Comment: Strotman back at his goalie.\n12:31 Comment: Szczetsny.\n12:32 Comment: Manolas.\n12:33 Comment: Fasna.\n12:34 Comment: Now it's dangerous.\n12:35 Comment: Fasyu.\n12:37 Comment: Fasyu is dangerous.\n12:38 Comment: But look, he decided not to risk it.\n12:39 Comment: He didn't decide.\n12:41 Comment: He decided not to risk it.\n12:42 Comment: Played back to Vosik Shtetsna.\n12:43 Comment: He put the goalkeeper in a difficult position.\n12:46 Comment: And just like that, you see, Roma was a little nervous in this situation.\n12:51 Comment: As a result, he intercepted the ball.\n12:52 Comment: Cross over.\n12:53 Comment: Florenzo is here.\n12:54 Comment: First I lost the ball.\n12:55 Comment: Then he quickly returned it to Rome.\n12:57 Comment: And the Roman counterattack.\n12:58 Comment: Salaheh.\n12:59 Comment: He didn’t manage to process the ball’s entrance and then enter\n13:3 Comment: with him in the penalty area.\n13:4 Comment: But this is great.\n13:5 Comment: Strotman.\n13:6 Comment: Everything was wonderful.\n13:8 Comment: By the way, Strotman made a pass to Salaheh and ran to open up into the penalty area.\n13:10 Comment: And in fact, if Strotman played his head a little better, this is not his strongest devilry.\n13:16 Comment: Strotman made a pass and ran to the far post.\n13:19 Comment: Salaheh saw this.\n13:20 Comment: And in the end, a good presentation.\n13:22 Comment: A little bit too high, I think.\n13:24 Comment: Not much at all.\n13:25 Comment: What do you think, will Jack take Strotman’s place?\n13:27 Comment: I think the likelihood of a shot on target would at least be higher.\n13:30 Comment: It's not a fact that it's a goal, knowing Jack.\n13:31 Comment: Exactly the same, right?\n13:32 Comment: No.\n13:33 Comment: Knowing Jack, it’s not a fact that it’s a goal.\n13:34 Comment: But the probability that it would be more dangerous is 100%.\n13:39 Comment: But Savna did not run.\n13:40 Comment: And here is New Curie.\n13:41 Comment: Now he will appear on the field.\n13:44 Comment: Ivorian.\n13:45 Comment: A very young football player.\n13:46 Comment: He was born in 96th year.\n13:48 Comment: In general, Inter still has a lot of talented young people.\n13:50 Comment: It's not just New Curie.\n13:52 Comment: This is Myange, a player from Belgium.\n13:54 Comment: Yes, and the same Gabi Gou.\n13:56 Comment: Gabriel Barbosa is very young.\n13:58 Comment: But this is the policy of many Inter owners.\n14:1 Comment: After all, what, in short, was the main disagreement with Roberto Mancini, the Chinese investors?\n14:7 Comment: He really wanted to buy Ia Toure.\n14:9 Comment: Who is 33 years old.\n14:10 Comment: And Toure is an expensive transfer.\n14:12 Comment: Not even in terms of the amount that must be paid for Toure, but in terms of salary.\n14:18 Comment: But the Chinese said that they were ready to invest a lot of money in the team, but for young players.\n14:24 Comment: Therefore, Zhou Mario was bought, who is now being replaced for 45 million euros.\n14:28 Comment: Gaby Gow was purchased.\n14:30 Comment: And Inter is looking for young talents all over the world.\n14:33 Comment: Including Aritz New Curie.\n14:35 Comment: New Curie instead of Zhou Mario.\n14:36 Comment: But still, he has only just recovered.\n14:38 Comment: He had a back injury.\n14:40 Comment: He approached the match with Roma in combat readiness for official matches.\n14:46 Comment: Apparently, the injury is still making itself felt.\n14:49 Comment: That's why Frank Debura replaces him.\n14:51 Comment: This is Salah.\n14:52 Comment: Salah.\n14:53 Comment: Ricochet.\n14:54 Comment: His head.\n14:56 Comment: You can’t help but feel that every attack can lead to a goal.\n15:0 Comment: 19 years total New Curie.\n15:4 Comment: We talk about when a football player needs to open up.\n15:7 Comment: When he can.\n15:8 Comment: Yes, open up.\n15:9 Comment: When should he be allowed near the train?\n15:13 Comment: Well, some open up at 19, some at 23.\n15:17 Comment: But they are not shy.\n15:18 Comment: They really don’t hesitate to give way to young people.\n15:21 Comment: And prove yourself in such matches.\n15:23 Comment: Well, the tradition of recent years is the Italian series.\n15:26 Comment: There are many young football players.\n15:27 Comment: In the meantime, file a fine.\n15:28 Comment: Jack's head!\n15:29 Comment: No, Manolas, in my opinion, still hit with his head.\n15:32 Comment: Ahead of both your partner and your rivals.\n15:38 Comment: Yes, Manolas.\n15:39 Comment: Although, it seems to me, he could have punched Jack in the same way.\n15:43 Comment: Exactly the same way.\n15:44 Comment: Just past, yes.\n15:46 Comment: Eddie Jack, here he is.\n15:47 Comment: Well, we make fun of him a little.\n15:49 Comment: In fact, he is a really great striker.\n15:52 Comment: We remember his magnificent play in Wolfsburg, Germany,\n15:55 Comment: and in England too.\n15:56 Comment: Manchester Sitlen played very, very usefully.\n16:0 Comment: Neranda.\n16:2 Comment: Now the team has already played.\n16:5 Comment: Fasio.\n16:6 Comment: Well, here's Facio.\n16:7 Comment: Here's Facio.\n16:8 Comment: Normally he made a pass between his two players.\n16:13 Comment: Out.\n16:14 Comment: And another replacement, apparently.\n16:16 Comment: Yes, Inter already has, again, what I talked about in the first half,\n16:19 Comment: De Buro's team has problems on the flanks in defense on the flanks.\n16:23 Comment: Therefore, they change players here quite often.\n16:26 Comment: But Ansaldi still appeared in the starting lineup for the first time.\n16:29 Comment: In general, this season he is playing in the Italian Serie A for the first time.\n16:33 Comment: Nagotomo is speed, it is movement.\n16:36 Comment: This is the motor.\n16:37 Comment: This is a problem on defense.\n16:39 Comment: Nagotomo is a football player with a king in his head, he can run forward and forget about defense,\n16:45 Comment: forget that your role is really that of a defender, not a midfielder.\n16:50 Comment: For the Dutch coach who came from Ajax, just the thing.\n16:53 Comment: Yes, the player is excellent.\n16:54 Comment: A player who fits perfectly into his concept.\n16:58 Comment: Well, sometimes it happens, like in the film, what the men talk about, somehow he ran non-conceptually.\n17:4 Comment: Yes?\n17:5 Comment: Maybe non-conceptually Nagotomo can play in this meeting.\n17:12 Comment: Well, let's see.\n17:13 Comment: He just left.\n17:14 Comment: Bonega.\n17:15 Comment: Bonega walked away from one, from the other, like a bun.\n17:19 Comment: Bonega's kick.\n17:20 Comment: I went out the gate.\n17:21 Comment: And he raised his hands up, honestly showing that he had everything under control.\n17:27 Comment: Bonega's kick.\n17:28 Comment: Let's see again on replay how he got away from two or three opponents.\n17:32 Comment: And in the end he struck.\n17:33 Comment: In fact, there weren't very many options.\n17:34 Comment: Nevers, so the blow somewhere was even logical.\n17:39 Comment: And this is Luciano Spalletti in a wonderful suit.\n17:45 Comment: And, as always, very emotional.\n17:47 Comment: Let's see if he promises his players or fans that if the result is unsuccessful, then he will burn the suit.\n17:54 Comment: As some other Italian specialists do.\n18:1 Comment: Daniel Edrosi.\n18:4 Comment: This is such a soft cast.\n18:7 Comment: Fasio.\n18:8 Comment: Jacko.\n18:10 Comment: Bonega.\n18:11 Comment: And now Facio will have to run back.\n18:13 Comment: And here Inter still has a numerical advantage, but not for long.\n18:18 Comment: Kondreva.\n18:19 Comment: Kondreva leaves.\n18:20 Comment: It's a foul.\n18:21 Comment: This is a foul under a yellow card from Jesus.\n18:23 Comment: And a dangerous free kick for a left-footed player.\n18:27 Comment: I think for Peresic.\n18:28 Comment: I'll tell you now.\n18:29 Comment: Peresic can shoot.\n18:30 Comment: But I think that as soon as Ever Bonega arrived at Inter,\n18:33 Comment: all standards are in favor of the Argentine.\n18:36 Comment: He really almost always takes both free kicks and corners.\n18:40 Comment: Of course, there are still other players at Inter.\n18:42 Comment: There is Kondreva with a wonderful, powerful, you know, blow.\n18:47 Comment: But I think that most likely you are right.\n18:49 Comment: Either for Peresic, or, it seems to me, more likely for Ever Bonega.\n18:54 Comment: Well, from here you can actually try with your right foot to the near corner.\n18:58 Comment: Spin the ball, but it’s probably more convenient with the left hand.\n19:1 Comment: Although she disappeared.\n19:2 Comment: On the left, although it disappeared.\n19:4 Comment: Let's see.\n19:5 Comment: There are options.\n19:7 Comment: But, as Nobel said, since Ever Bonega appeared, then, probably, there are no options.\n19:11 Comment: Although we don't have long to wait.\n19:15 Comment: Although you have to take risks.\n19:16 Comment: Where there is risk, there is opportunity.\n19:18 Comment: Cardi can also shoot there, and he can actually score, and he’s also near the ball.\n19:24 Comment: Cardi, you know, has that feeling of being naked.\n19:27 Comment: And from any point, from any position.\n19:29 Comment: Anything can happen.\n19:31 Comment: But you see, three football players.\n19:32 Comment: Give us a forecast, Nobel, that now the goal, the wall, is out...\n19:35 Comment: No, that's too much. Come on, someone will punch.\n19:37 Comment: Come on, Peresic.\n19:38 Comment: I think Peresic.\n19:39 Comment: That's how I advertised Bonega.\n19:42 Comment: I will stand on this footballer that Ever Bonega will shoot.\n19:46 Comment: Although for some reason he has now moved away from the ball.\n19:49 Comment: My shares have fallen a lot, Konstantin.\n19:52 Comment: This is how Inter fans cross their fingers.\n19:57 Comment: Yes, Bonega is on the sidelines.\n19:58 Comment: Peresic beats.\n19:59 Comment: Konstantin is absolutely right.\n20:0 Comment: But the blow is not accurate.\n20:2 Comment: Yes, but it hit well.\n20:5 Comment: Peresic brought the ball along this directional trajectory.\n20:10 Comment: AND...\n20:11 Comment: Such cold-bloodedness, yes, there will be, to be honest.\n20:14 Comment: What did you see.\n20:15 Comment: Well, here are the Inter fans.\n20:18 Comment: Of course, they are also available here in Rome, at the Olympic Stadium.\n20:22 Comment: But Inter is a very popular team in Italy.\n20:24 Comment: Second team in the country.\n20:26 Comment: The most popular club is Juventus.\n20:29 Comment: People all over Italy are rooting for him.\n20:32 Comment: And the second is Inter.\n20:33 Comment: Second Inter.\n20:34 Comment: This is a well-known statistic.\n20:36 Comment: The most famous fan, I think many people know him, is Drianon Celentano.\n20:40 Comment: By the way, this is really...\n20:42 Comment: By the way, if we talk about popularity and support, yes, indeed Juventus and Inter.\n20:46 Comment: But, if you ask which team you hate the most, both Juventus and Inter are here.\n20:52 Comment: Well, by the way, this is logical.\n20:53 Comment: This was the case in all countries.\n20:54 Comment: I think the same can happen, for example, in Russia.\n20:57 Comment: The same may happen in Russia.\n20:58 Comment: The same may be true in Spain.\n21:1 Comment: They love Real, they hate Real.\n21:4 Comment: In England, in Germany, for example, in Bavaria, the majority probably love it, but the majority just can’t stand it.\n21:10 Comment: This is a normal story for any country.\n21:13 Comment: But Inter really has a very large army of fans.\n21:18 Comment: And in recent years, given the results of Inter, I sincerely feel sorry for them.\n21:22 Comment: It’s a pity, but, I repeat, there is such optimism now.\n21:26 Comment: Now Cardi is with the ball.\n21:28 Comment: No, of course, I overestimated the situation a little.\n21:31 Comment: He was not with the ball, he tried to shoot straight away.\n21:33 Comment: In general, a neutral fan, of course, really wants the two Milanese teams, Inter and Milan, to finally return there.\n21:40 Comment: Everyone wants it, Konstantin, everyone wants it.\n21:42 Comment: Here is the correct piloton, which follows the first, second, third team.\n21:46 Comment: Yes, they are floundering somewhere in the middle.\n21:49 Comment: Inter loses the ball.\n21:52 Comment: No, Inter lost the ball, and Roma earned a throw-out.\n21:58 Comment: Here in the fight with Anton.\n22:4 Comment: They didn't fight for the ball and...\n22:5 Comment: Minor injury.\n22:6 Comment: ...thrown out of bounds.\n22:7 Comment: Yes, the Brazilian has a minor injury.\n22:9 Comment: But Inter fans have optimism.\n22:11 Comment: I will return to this topic.\n22:12 Comment: Indeed, Chinese investors came in earnest.\n22:16 Comment: Lots of transfers, lots of money.\n22:19 Comment: And, again, the hope is that Macio Murati will return to the presidency, and this, by the way, is the initiative of the Chinese.\n22:25 Comment: Who was talking about something?\n22:26 Comment: And by the way, Macio Murati...\n22:27 Comment: ...declared that he was ready to do this.\n22:31 Comment: In principle, he will reflect, think.\n22:33 Comment: And the Chinese offered him to buy out part of the shares that remained, 30%, from Eric Thohir, the current owner of the club.\n22:40 Comment: And Murati himself, by the way, said that Erik Thohir lost control.\n22:44 Comment: Literally, by the way, the toy seemed too big.\n22:48 Comment: So, you know, Masio Murati spoke a little, not very nicely, about the now ex-owner of Inter.\n22:55 Comment: Beautiful!\n22:56 Comment: Ivan Nagatono!\n22:57 Comment: Cross from Icardi!\n22:59 Comment: Hit! Where are you going?\n23:1 Comment: This is the same Aryan, his friends, Asan Yukeri, who entered the field at number 27.\n23:9 Comment: He performs and is only 19 years old.\n23:11 Comment: Well, indeed, he clearly did not have enough experience at this point.\n23:14 Comment: Well, I think it was just not enough...\n23:16 Comment: ...and skill, yes, more.\n23:17 Comment: ... efficiency, yes, and technology.\n23:19 Comment: Because this Aryan of his got hooked on the ball.\n23:24 Comment: And I think that if Icardi had been in his place, the blow would have been more dense, and yes, correct.\n23:32 Comment: The attack was good at the moment, and we note the very skillful action of Nagatono.\n23:36 Comment: What's here?\n23:37 Comment: Salad is offside here.\n23:39 Comment: By the way, it’s been a long time since Roma threatened the goal.\n23:42 Comment: Yes, it was offside, of course.\n23:44 Comment: Samir Handanovic's goal.\n23:46 Comment: Well, now Inter has an obvious advantage.\n23:51 Comment: One more replacement.\n23:52 Comment: And El Sharawy!\n23:53 Comment: Jovetic appears on the field for Roma and Inter.\n23:56 Comment: Jovetic replaces Antonio Candreve, who is booed.\n24:1 Comment: Listen to how Kandreva sees off.\n24:7 Comment: Jovetic has not yet come out and has already told everyone how to play with his appearance.\n24:13 Comment: Montenegrin Stefan Jovetic appears on the field.\n24:17 Comment: And one more replacement.\n24:19 Comment: El Sharawy!\n24:20 Comment: Italian football player.\n24:21 Comment: He changes Savakh.\n24:22 Comment: Spalletti's amazing decision.\n24:24 Comment: Although, you know, even if he played a little uselessly, let’s say, but, on the other hand, he often emanated a threat.\n24:31 Comment: He started the scoring attack, yes.\n24:33 Comment: And so Spalletti said, where did he go, dear?\n24:36 Comment: Where? Your hand.\n24:37 Comment: Where is your hand, here is mine for you.\n24:39 Comment: And Savakh reluctantly, yes, still stroked Spalletti’s hand.\n24:44 Comment: Give me your pen, yes.\n24:46 Comment: I'll tell you fortune.\n24:47 Comment: Breed.\n24:48 Comment: AND...\n24:50 Comment: It really suggested itself, in my opinion, to replace Perotti rather, yes.\n24:53 Comment: If Roma plays a counter-game, Savah can easily escape from the same Jason Murili.\n24:59 Comment: Yes, I agree with you.\n25:1 Comment: But, you know, I think that Spalletti understands football in general a little better than us.\n25:5 Comment: The natural situation in Roma.\n25:7 Comment: The key word is “slightly” in the number.\n25:9 Comment: Change it.\n25:11 Comment: Leave the ball in play.\n25:13 Comment: Santon.\n25:15 Comment: This was played well, in my opinion, Savakh.\n25:17 Comment: Breaking the rules.\n25:18 Comment: But Luca Banti does not react, because he is waiting for his clue...\n25:24 Comment: No, by the way.\n25:25 Comment: Tips from your assistant.\n25:27 Comment: Have you figured it out?\n25:28 Comment: In my opinion, the judges assessed the episode absolutely correctly.\n25:32 Comment: And, in particular, the referee working on the far side, El Sharawi.\n25:37 Comment: El Sharaoui, right, Nobel?\n25:39 Comment: Like this...\n25:41 Comment: It needs a little fixing.\n25:43 Comment: Well, that’s what the Italians call such a football player.\n25:45 Comment: By the way, I just made a mistake...\n25:47 Comment: Still the same Ares Newkeri.\n25:49 Comment: And you know, this is how I think about it now.\n25:51 Comment: Amazing solution from Deboer.\n25:53 Comment: Because with all Newcarey’s talent, and the fact that he is young, it is necessary to give way to the young.\n25:57 Comment: But it’s a status match, an important match.\n25:59 Comment: Even more so for Deboer.\n26:1 Comment: Candecbia is in the reserve, Filippo Melo is in the reserve.\n26:3 Comment: And you're missing out on Newcarey for that position.\n26:5 Comment: Well, a very high pace.\n26:7 Comment: And not everyone, perhaps, will fit into such a pace.\n26:9 Comment: Although Kandekbia is still...\n26:11 Comment: Well, that's not true.\n26:13 Comment: This is wrong.\n26:16 Comment: Kandekbia is still young.\n26:18 Comment: Young football player.\n26:19 Comment: Okay, let's not criticize Newcarey prematurely.\n26:21 Comment: Here he is with the ball.\n26:22 Comment: Maybe he will score two now and Inter will win?\n26:24 Comment: Not a bad pass.\n26:25 Comment: Bonega!\n26:26 Comment: Icardi in one touch.\n26:27 Comment: Bonega.\n26:28 Comment: Without giving Saido, without giving Saido.\n26:29 Comment: Hit!\n26:30 Comment: Gooool!\n26:31 Comment: Gooooool!\n26:34 Comment: Ever Bonega!\n26:36 Comment: Ever Bonega scores.\n26:38 Comment: And what, what, what combination.\n26:41 Comment: Bonega and Icardi.\n26:42 Comment: And it was started, by the way, by Asan Nyukeri.\n26:45 Comment: Which one came out.\n26:46 Comment: Start to criticize strongly.\n26:47 Comment: But no.\n26:48 Comment: He also took part in this moment.\n26:51 Comment: Well, brilliant.\n26:52 Comment: Two Argentines Bonega and Icardi played the ball.\n26:56 Comment: Yes, there was no side.\n26:57 Comment: Here Roman’s defenders tried to come out synchronously.\n27:1 Comment: What a blow Bonega has.\n27:2 Comment: Here is the Moscow Art Theater pause.\n27:3 Comment: And from the left leg under the supporting leg.\n27:5 Comment: In the Honest corner closest to Wojtsk.\n27:8 Comment: No chance for the goalkeeper.\n27:10 Comment: Draw 1-1.\n27:11 Comment: The guests played this combination really well.\n27:14 Comment: And let’s be honest, Inter probably scored their goal after these 72 minutes.\n27:22 Comment: Agree.\n27:24 Comment: Well, good Ever Bonega.\n27:26 Comment: By the way, he moved to Inter for free in the summer.\n27:30 Comment: But what a master.\n27:33 Comment: Almost the entire attacking game in Seville was based on it.\n27:36 Comment: Therefore, it is not surprising that he is truly a master.\n27:41 Comment: But a new challenge was needed.\n27:43 Comment: A new page was needed in his biography.\n27:47 Comment: He chose Italy and Inter chose him.\n27:50 Comment: And Bruno Perez.\n27:53 Comment: Bruno Perez back.\n27:55 Comment: Change it.\n27:56 Comment: No, this is Yuvitich.\n27:57 Comment: I'm sorry.\n27:59 Comment: Long pass forward.\n28:0 Comment: Manolas is ahead of him on Icardi.\n28:3 Comment: Now the game has definitely gone for three results.\n28:6 Comment: Purely, in my opinion, purely after all, Bonega took the ball away.\n28:9 Comment: What I like about the Italian Championship.\n28:10 Comment: That's how much they invest.\n28:13 Comment: This emotionality in every match.\n28:16 Comment: Now Inter was happy about this goal.\n28:18 Comment: In a way that Atlético Madrid was probably not happy in the Champions League final.\n28:22 Comment: When he scored against Real Madrid.\n28:23 Comment: But imagine what happens when a team wins the Champions League.\n28:26 Comment: They rarely do this lately.\n28:28 Comment: Very, very, Nobel, rare.\n28:30 Comment: But, by the way, Inter last won the Champions League from an Italian.\n28:34 Comment: Six years ago.\n28:34 Comment: But, really, the emotions are crazy.\n28:36 Comment: They don't always happen.\n28:37 Comment: That’s why people love the series, they love calcio.\n28:43 Comment: Not only within Italy, but, naturally, beyond its borders.\n28:47 Comment: Well, Spalletti probably felt something.\n28:49 Comment: Because now, probably, there won’t be this open game from Inter.\n28:53 Comment: Maybe Inter will play a little deeper.\n28:55 Comment: Therefore, Pirotti is already here.\n28:59 Comment: And above El Sharawi, who is still more diverse than Salah.\n29:3 Comment: Maybe he felt that Spalletti was about to...\n29:7 Comment: Well, you know, it’s also important to understand how El Sharawi will play instead of Salah.\n29:12 Comment: Because Salah...\n29:13 Comment: We have already noted that he was a threat to Inter.\n29:17 Comment: He didn't convert the chances, but...\n29:19 Comment: He was running away.\n29:19 Comment: He ran away, yes.\n29:20 Comment: He was running away.\n29:21 Comment: Now, perhaps, there will be nowhere to run.\n29:23 Comment: Free kick for Roma.\n29:25 Comment: This is Florence Alexandrov at the ball.\n29:29 Comment: Manolas, Fazio, Dzhekov.\n29:31 Comment: Tall players there.\n29:33 Comment: Penalty on actions.\n29:34 Comment: The presentation is good.\n29:37 Comment: Peresic jumps the highest.\n29:39 Comment: And the ball kicks out.\n29:40 Comment: But Bruno Perez is in the wings.\n29:42 Comment: Brazil.\n29:43 Comment: The Brazilian went on his own.\n29:45 Comment: Foul.\n29:46 Comment: Jovicic.\n29:48 Comment: He braided his legs.\n29:49 Comment: Well, we were talking about who would take what looked like a free kick.\n29:54 Comment: It was a little closer to the center.\n29:56 Comment: At Inter.\n29:58 Comment: And Roma.\n29:58 Comment: At Roma's...\n29:59 Comment: Release Francesco Tochi.\n30:0 Comment: Now let him shoot from here with his first touch.\n30:3 Comment: Like he did with Astra.\n30:4 Comment: Moreover, the time has come, right?\n30:6 Comment: 75th minute.\n30:7 Comment: Like he did with Astra.\n30:8 Comment: Yes, he hit it great.\n30:9 Comment: Then they scored the fourth goal.\n30:13 Comment: There is Rothman.\n30:14 Comment: There is Florenzi.\n30:17 Comment: But I am afraid...\n30:18 Comment: Yes, Florenzi.\n30:19 Comment: Florenzi will shoot.\n30:21 Comment: Not Derosi.\n30:22 Comment: Yes, Derosi is unlikely to be an assistant for the team in this situation.\n30:26 Comment: Yes, Alexandra Florenzi.\n30:27 Comment: Young.\n30:28 Comment: Again, I emphasize, ring-linin.\n30:29 Comment: Which is very important for Roma.\n30:30 Comment: Future captain, no doubt.\n30:32 Comment: Roma through...\n30:33 Comment: Although some will end their career.\n30:36 Comment: More like Florenzi.\n30:37 Comment: Why are you sending him to retire?\n30:39 Comment: No, not under any circumstances.\n30:40 Comment: No way.\n30:40 Comment: Florenzi.\n30:42 Comment: And the presentation.\n30:43 Comment: Hit.\n30:44 Comment: Goal!\n30:47 Comment: Kostas Manolas.\n30:48 Comment: The namesake practically scores.\n30:50 Comment: The Greek is on fire.\n30:53 Comment: Kostas Manolas and Alexandra Florenzi organized the goal for Samir Handanovic.\n30:58 Comment: Excellent presentation.\n31:0 Comment: And here they are, here they are emotions.\n31:3 Comment: Where are we going today, asks Luciano-Spoletic.\n31:6 Comment: We celebrate the time of so many cool restaurants that are open late.\n31:10 Comment: But the presentation, right?\n31:11 Comment: Right on the lips.\n31:12 Comment: And a shot into the near corner.\n31:14 Comment: And even Handanovich’s reaction is not enough to cope with this blow.\n31:17 Comment: You know, I think there's a pharmacy there.\n31:18 Comment: No, wait.\n31:20 Comment: Impact, no.\n31:21 Comment: The ball hit Icardi in the head.\n31:24 Comment: It was Manolas who hit him, but Icardi hit him in the head, yes.\n31:28 Comment: Such.\n31:29 Comment: Repeat this.\n31:30 Comment: Yes Yes Yes.\n31:31 Comment: It turned out like a doublet, right?\n31:35 Comment: Billiard.\n31:37 Comment: And this is how the Olympic stage reacts.\n31:39 Comment: This is how the Olympic stage reacts.\n31:42 Comment: The ball is scored.\n31:43 Comment: 2-1.\n31:45 Comment: Roma is ahead.\n31:46 Comment: Kostas Manolas scores.\n31:48 Comment: And we really have a very bright evening in Rome.\n31:52 Comment: And what?\n31:53 Comment: And does Entar still have gunpowder in these flasks?\n31:56 Comment: Or not 15 minutes of fiery football?\n32:0 Comment: Release Francesco Totti.\n32:3 Comment: We miss him.\n32:4 Comment: The only thing missing from this game is Francesco Totti.\n32:6 Comment: Please, Luciano.\n32:7 Comment: And I think Spoletti talked about this with his assistants.\n32:11 Comment: Here's a break.\n32:12 Comment: Which was.\n32:12 Comment: With Anton.\n32:13 Comment: Meanwhile, they play on New Kiri.\n32:15 Comment: His young arids Jo Miranda.\n32:18 Comment: Miranda.\n32:20 Comment: Brazilian Miranda.\n32:21 Comment: Former Atletico Madrid football player.\n32:23 Comment: New Kiri.\n32:24 Comment: New Kiri to the center.\n32:26 Comment: The defender is good here.\n32:28 Comment: It's Jesus fighting there.\n32:30 Comment: Peresic is tired too.\n32:31 Comment: You know, he acted very slowly now.\n32:33 Comment: Could and should have been faster.\n32:36 Comment: No.\n32:37 Comment: A replacement will appear.\n32:38 Comment: Paredes.\n32:40 Comment: But, in principle, two more replacements.\n32:41 Comment: As long as I remember.\n32:42 Comment: I understand that Roma has it.\n32:43 Comment: Therefore, Totti still has a chance to enter the field.\n32:46 Comment: His birthday was on the 27th.\n32:48 Comment: If I'm not mistaken, September.\n32:51 Comment: He turned 40 years old.\n32:53 Comment: Francesco Totti.\n32:54 Comment: There was a big holiday in Rome.\n32:56 Comment: Big birthday for Francesco Totti.\n32:58 Comment: In Italy this date is celebrated.\n33:0 Comment: Just like that.\n33:0 Comment: And in the invitation to the guests there was a request from Francesco Totti\n33:5 Comment: come without gifts,\n33:7 Comment: and transport the money that was going to be spent on a gift,\n33:10 Comment: to the orphanage.\n33:10 Comment: Like this.\n33:12 Comment: This is what Francesco Totti did.\n33:13 Comment: And in Italy, of course, everyone appreciated this act.\n33:15 Comment: Substitution for Roma.\n33:17 Comment: Pirotti, whom you have already escorted to the rescue bench.\n33:20 Comment: The fans applaud him.\n33:22 Comment: And Leandro Paredes comes out instead.\n33:25 Comment: I'll tell you honestly,\n33:26 Comment: I really like this football player\n33:29 Comment: who can do almost everything on the field.\n33:31 Comment: It is in the center of the field.\n33:32 Comment: He's, you know, in Italian football\n33:35 Comment: There is a term called “rigista”.\n33:37 Comment: Game director.\n33:37 Comment: He's perfect for this role.\n33:39 Comment: Yes, and the institution of renting here is also for him.\n33:42 Comment: And he is already helping, because last season\n33:43

    "summary": "The match between AS Roma and Inter Milan at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome was an enthralling encounter filled with high-intensity action, vivid emotional moments, and a plethora of scoring opportunities. In the end, Roma emerged victorious with a 2-1 scoreline over Inter, marking a significant win for Luciano Spalletti's side against Frank de Boer's men in what was one of the most exhilarating and gripping contests of the Serie A season.\n\nFirst Half:\n\nThe match kicked off with both teams showing their intent right from the start. Within the first few minutes, it was evident that Inter's head coach, Frank de Boer, had recovered from a back injury and was keen on making a statement. Key players like Ever Banega (number 19) and Antonio Candreva were expected to play pivotal roles.\n\nAt the 9th minute mark, applause was directed towards the prolific Ivan Peresic, the 44th Inter Milan captain and top scorer, signaling his importance to the team's offensive capabilities. Mauro Icardi, wearing the number 9 jersey and leading Inter from the front, sought to make an impact early on, in line with the tactical directives of de Boer.\n\nRoma, under the watchful eyes of their head coach Luciano Spalletti, also displayed defensive resilience, with goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny safeguarding the goal (number 1). The defense was manned by influential players including Joao Jesus (number 3) on the left and Bruno Peres (number 13) on the right, providing a sturdy backline. However, the standout moment early on came when Inter's threatening cross from Candreva skipped past his intended target, flying out of bounds.\n\nRoma's counter-attacks were swift and potent. By the 19th minute, they had shown their own tactical discipline, with a line of defense composed of Federico Fazio (number 20) and Kostas Manolas (number 44) working industriously to stave off Inter’s advances. The midfield was bolstered by Kevin Strootman (number 6) and Daniele De Rossi (number 16), providing a platform for attackers like Diego Perotti (number 8), Alessandro Florenzi (number 24), and the pacy Mohamed Salah (number 11) to push forward. Edin Dzeko, wearing the number 9 jersey, led the attacking line but was yet to find his scoring touch.\n\nIt took until the 29th minute for the match to see its first real breakthrough. Salah intercepted a ball high up the pitch and laid it off to Bruno Peres, who in turn delivered a precise cross into the penalty area. Dzeko showed his predatory instincts as he deftly redirected the ball using his Bosnian leg, past Inter’s Samir Handanovic. The stadium erupted as Dzeko scored his fifth goal of the season, showcasing a sublime piece of team play. This goal came after several failed attempts by Roma's forwards, hinting at a potential revival of Dzeko’s form which had been under scrutiny.\n\nInter’s response was not immediate, as Roma continued pressing forward. Inter suffered a blow when Banega’s shot struck the post, a moment that left their fans buzzing with anticipation and frustration alike. Soon after, Dzeko found another opportunity, but Handanovic was determined to keep the scoreline within reach.\n\nHowever, Inter remained relentless, with their midfield, particularly Banega and Joao Mario, orchestrating plays to create openings. Despite their best efforts, they struggled to breach Roma’s solid defensive unit, who remained compact and tactically astute throughout.\n\nAs the half wore on, the tempo escalated with both teams exchanging dangerous forays. Inter had a brief moment of hope when a cross from Perisic nearly found its mark, only for it to be squandered.\n\nThe first half culminated in a flurry of end-to-end action, but the score remained 1-0 in favor of Roma, thanks to Dzeko’s early strike and a series of last-ditch defensive efforts by players like Bruno Peres and Manolas. Inter's attack led by Mauro Icardi, who had been largely kept quiet, hinted that the second half might hold promises of a comeback.\n\nSecond Half:\n\nThe teams re-emerged with Inter making a few tactical adjustments, with players like Yuto Nagatomo warming up on the sidelines, ready to inject pace and intensity into the game. Roma, maintaining their structure, hoped to sustain their defensive solidity and exploit counter-attacking opportunities.\n\nWithin minutes of the restart, Roma’s Strootman found Perotti on the left flank. The Argentine winger attempted to replicate his first-half efforts by cutting inside and aiming for the far corner, but Handanovic was equal to the task, keeping Inter in the game.\n\nJust moments later, a defensive mishap by Murillo nearly allowed Dzeko through, but the Inter defenders managed to recover. Inter then began to show glimmers of resurgence, with Banega and Candreva becoming more involved in the game, weaving through Roma’s midfield and firing shots towards the goal, only to find Wojciech Szczesny in inspired form.\n\nThe introduction of New Curie for Joao Mario sparked fresh energy into Inter’s play. Despite his youth and some early nerves, New Curie combined well with Perisic and Banega in creating a cohesive attacking front. Around the 70-minute mark, it was Banega, combining with captain Icardi, who found the breakthrough. An exquisite pass from Icardi set up Banega, who displayed composure and clinical precision to slot it past Szczesny, bringing the score to 1-1. This equalizer ignited hope among Inter supporters, with their side now visibly rejuvenated.\n\nWith the game precariously poised at 1-1, Roma knew that any lapse in concentration could tilt the balance. Just when it seemed Inter might seize control, Roma's resilience came to the fore. Florenzi, whose influence had been growing, delivered an impeccably timed cross into the box. Kostas Manolas rose highest, sending a bullet header initially deflected off Icardi’s head and then trickling past Handanovic into the net.\n\nThis goal in the 75th minute restored Roma’s lead and reenergized the home crowd. Inter threw caution to the wind as they pushed for another equalizer, with Jovetic and Nagatomo launching desperate attacks forward. Despite several forays into Roma’s half and a few nervy moments in the Roma defense, Szczesny and his defenders held firm.\n\nAs the match drew to a close, Spalletti introduced further changes, bringing on Nainggolan to bolster the midfield and see out the game. The final minutes were a testament to Roma’s strategic acumen and defensive diligence. Manolas, who had been pivotal throughout, continued to clear crosses and win aerial duels with unerring authority.\n\nDespite three minutes of added time and some late drama, including a stunning save by Handanovic to deny Dzeko a second goal, Roma managed to hold onto their lead. The final whistle blew to confirm a 2-1 victory, a result that showcased Roma’s clinical edge in attack and tenacity in defense.\n\nThis match not only bolstered the confidence of Spalletti’s squad but also illustrated the intense competitiveness of Serie A, where every fixture carries weight and every point is fiercely contested. For Inter, it was a game of missed opportunities and moments of brilliance that, however, fell short against a well-drilled Roma side.\n\nIn a match that celebrated tactical nous, individual brilliance, and the undying spirit of the beautiful game, Roma emerged deserving winners in front of a jubilant home crowd."
