Comment: But I don't think Lucas Castro is too upset about it.\n15:26 Comment: Although he will miss Kyiv's final match of the season.\n15:31 Comment: It will be an away match in Bergamo against Atalanta.\n15:36 Comment: A match that, for Kyiv, just like today’s, doesn’t solve anything in principle.\n15:41 Comment: So Lucas Castro will finish the season at home.\n15:45 Comment: Lucas Castro has his fifth goal of the season.\n15:51 Comment: Well, Inglese made the fourth assist with his shoulder.\n15:56 Comment: 1-0.\n15:58 Comment: Napoli plays Fiorentina today.\n16:1 Comment: Playing at

and advance to the group stage of the Champions League.\n16:28 Comment: Now the task becomes more difficult.\n16:33 Comment: Birsa tried to throw it back. Great.\n16:35 Comment: Kieva plays in the first minutes.\n16:38 Comment: Emerson didn't pass.\n16:40 Comment: Radanovic closed the flank because Cacciatore went ahead.\n16:44 Comment: And, of course, the defensive midfielder's backup works.\n16:51 Comment: Derosi.\n16:54 Comment: Forward passing. The passing game is not working yet.\n16:58 Comment: There was an attack, a great strike from Salah.\n17:0 Comment: But otherwise it’s very difficult for Roma ahead.\n17:3 Comment: And Kieva snaps. And she snaps skillfully.\n17:7 Comment: Paredes.\n17:14 Comment: Salah gets the technique.\n17:17 Comment: Stratman. He gave the transmission.\n17:21 Comment: Well, probably still counting on Salah.\n17:25 Comment: Although Dzeko was also there. It was a difficult pass in terms of reception.\n17:31 Comment: The zone was not free. And it was necessary to rush in there, of course.\n17:35 Comment: And strike.\n17:37 Comment: It's late for Derosi, it's too late to roll back Salah.\n17:41 Comment: A little earlier Daniel would have done this.

Gobi doesn't make things up.\n17:52 Comment: Inglese takes the ball.\n17:54 Comment: Manolas is against him. Partners are joining in.\n17:57 Comment: Inglese, Inglese in the penalty area. Keeps the ball.\n17:59 Comment: Rüdeger didn't hit.\n18:2 Comment: Here the blow is already coming to Birsa.\n18:5 Comment: I didn’t hit him, I mean, of course, not the Ingleses.\n18:8 Comment: Didn't attack him hard enough.\n18:10 Comment: Look again. Rüdeger could have entered the selection here.\n18:14 Comment: But as a result, he ended up neither there nor there.\n18:17 Comment: And he didn’t fight with Inglesa, and he didn’t close Birsa.\n18:20 Comment: In my opinion, Rüdeger was mistaken.\n18:23 Comment: And allowed Birsa to break through.\n18:26 Comment: But Biers didn't hit accurately.\n18:31 Comment: With Chans.\n18:33 Comment: I repeat, so far Kyeva looks very cool.\n18:37 Comment: And this is not the first team we have seen this season.\n18:40 Comment: Italian at the end of the championship.\n18:42 Comment: Who plays for her honor.\n18:44 Comment: But he plays as if he is solving the most important tournament problems.\n18:48 Comment: Well done Verona people.\n18:50 Comment: Well, now Roma is on the attack.\n18:52 Comment: Jacko.\n18:53 Comment: The ball is bouncing.

connects.\n19:5 Comment: Birsa.\n19:6 Comment: Skok.\n19:7 Comment: But here Paredes takes it.\n19:9 Comment: Daniel Iderosi.\n19:12 Comment: And Roma has a very slow transition.\n19:16 Comment: Rüdeger.\n19:21 Comment: They start their attack by passing.\n19:24 Comment: They don't attack here in their own half.\n19:27 Comment: Kyiv's ballistas allow you to go deeper.\n19:31 Comment: Paredes.\n19:33 Comment: He's looking to see who he can pass on to.\n19:36 Comment: Gives it to Strotman.\n19:37 Comment: He has space.\n19:38 Comment: But he gives it to Salah.\n19:39 Comment: Salah na Dzeko.\n19:41 Comment: And Dzeko is ahead of Cacciatore in the air.\n19:46 Comment: Stefan Alsharawy.\n19:48 Comment: Not yet involved.\n19:50 Comment: A lot of attacks from the right flank.\n19:53 Comment: Here.\n19:55 Comment: Offsite.\n19:56 Comment: The flag is raised.\n19:58 Comment: Fabrizio Posado picks it up.\n20:1 Comment: But...\n20:3 Comment: Offsite is questionable.\n20:4 Comment: There, Dzeko’s hand, of course, was closer to the goal.\n20:8 Comment: But here's the thing about playing body parts,\n20:11 Comment: I will not undertake to judge unambiguously.\n20:13 Comment: But let's assume that Fabrizio Posado knew better.\n20:19 Comment: Alsharawi.\n20:21 Comment: He's with the ball.\n20:22 Comment: He's walking backwards.\n20:24 Comment: Toyed with Paredes.\n20:26 Comment: And again from defense.\n20:27 Comment: From afar again.\n20:28 Comment: Kieva has already been rebuilt.\n20:30 Comment: This is the diagram.\n20:31 Comment: This is the diamond.\n20:32 Comment: You can see him now.\n20:34 Comment: And ahead of Beers and Ingles.\n20:39 Comment: We need to somehow destroy these defensive structures.\n20:42 Comment: Gobi takes a step forward.\n20:44 Comment: Closes Ryudegero's move.\n20:47 Comment: And Bastian immediately moves back.\n20:49 Comment: Everything is very organized in Uraland Moran's team.\n20:52 Comment: And the general himself is now at the edge.\n21:2 Comment: Rüdeger.\n21:6 Comment: Paredes.\n21:9 Comment: Manolas.\n21:12 Comment: Perosi.\n21:15 Comment: Translation and failure.\n21:17 Comment: Unlucky on Emerson.\n21:20 Comment: Hold the ball.\n21:21 Comment: Waiting for the opportunity to switch the game.\n21:24 Comment: Move to flank.\n21:25 Comment: And they failed.\n21:26 Comment: Here's another goal.\n21:27 Comment: And, of course, Castro’s hit was very accurate.\n21:31 Comment: But that's all.\n21:33 Comment: It's all about this attack.\n21:34 Comment: On the one hand, of course, this pass with the shoulder might not have turned out so successful.\n21:40 Comment: But it worked.\n21:41 Comment: And it looked.\n21:42 Comment: Especially in dynamics.\n21:43 Comment: Especially in the long shot.\n21:45 Comment: It all looked really cool.\n21:50 Comment: Manolas.\n21:53 Comment: Defenders rise at Roma.\n21:58 Comment: And they keep watch.\n21:59 Comment: Watching for a mistake.\n22:1

defense.\n22:19 Comment: When Cacciatore had to cover the left flank.\n22:29 Comment: And Isco played on the right wing.\n22:33 Comment: He still has some defense left.\n22:37 Comment: I had to combine it.\n22:40 Comment: To Eve with the ball.\n22:42 Comment: Radavanovich.\n22:44 Comment: Roma is moving back.\n22:47 Comment: Now Strotman.\n22:49 Comment: At the position of the second striker.\n22:53 Comment: Before the match they showed the lineup.\n22:55 Comment: And they said that Paredes would play as an attacking midfielder.\n22:59 Comment: But apparently this is not so.\n23:0

even managed to be the captain of this team.\n25:7 Comment: But now he plays for Kiev.\n25:12 Comment: And the same picture.\n25:13 Comment: Roma has the ball.\n25:15 Comment: In terms of control, of course, the Romans are ahead.\n25:19 Comment: The owners.\n25:21 Comment: But where is the danger?\n25:22 Comment: At the gates of Ciorentina.\n25:23 Comment: He helped out once.\n25:25 Comment: But

be a goal kick.\n25:59 Comment: Pacciatoro and Gamberini played very carefully.\n26:12 Comment: And the ball was escorted.\n26:19 Comment: Beyond Ciorentina's bullet.\n26:29 Comment: Kills.\n26:36 Comment: Dumped Jack.\n26:41 Comment: And in the center of the bullet is a violation of the rules.\n26:43 Comment: Manolas does not agree with the referee's decision.\n26:46 Comment: But it's purely instinctive.\n26:56 Comment: Lucas Castro on the lawn.\n27:12 Comment: And reverse gear.\n27:13 Comment: Kieva can play any way she wants now.\n27:16 Comment: Give the ball to the goalkeeper.\n27:18 Comment: Roma needs to force this.\n27:20 Comment: Roma is trying.\n27:21 Comment: And he plays great for Jack.\n27:22 Comment: It lets me through.\n27:23 Comment: And El Sharawi equalizes the score.\n27:27 Comment: That's a mistake.\n27:28 Comment: So the Veronese people started playing.\n27:31 Comment: And I will repeat.\n27:32 Comment: In this attack, yes, El Sharawi scored the goal.\n27:36 Comment: He is good.\n27:37 Comment: But Jack is here.\n27:38 Comment: Gone, left and distracted attention.\n27:41 Comment: What's most important.\n27:42 Comment: Defenders high.\n27:44 Comment: The best scorer in Serie A.\n27:47 Comment: And they missed Stefan El Sharawi.\n27:49 Comment: It's like he's from an ambush.\n27:51 Comment: Breaked out.\n27:52 Comment: I picked up the ball.\n27:53 Comment: And he drove into the empty gates.\n27:55 Comment: And Sorrentina, of course, came out.\n27:58 Comment: And the defenders left.\n27:59 Comment: 1-1.\n28:0 Comment: Roma equalizes the score.\n28:4 Comment: Well, that's how it is now.\n28:5 Comment: Well, that's how the game will go now.\n28:7 Comment: Well, of course, the drawing will remain the same.\n28:9 Comment: But they were wrong.\n28:10 Comment: The players made a mistake.\n28:12 Comment: Kieva and Birsa.\n28:14 Comment: He hits from outside the field.\n28:16 Comment: Today he is not on the field, of course, in the penalty area.\n28:18 Comment: He's hitting today.\n28:21 Comment: This is not the first blow.\n28:23 Comment: He takes aim from a long distance.\n28:27 Comment: Birsa can break through.\n28:36 Comment: Rüdeger.\n28:41 Comment: De Rossi backheeled onto Salah.\n28:43 Comment: But Salah just didn't make it in time.\n28:47 Comment: Rüdeger powerful came to attack.\n28:49 Comment: It helped get the ball back.\n28:51 Comment: Strothman, De Rossi.\n28:53 Comment: They're all here.\n28:54 Comment: And everyone is trying to give it to Salah.\n28:57 Comment: A series of ricochets.\n28:58 Comment: Inglese doesn't grab the ball.\n29:2 Comment: De Pauli.\n29:5 Comment: Gave it to the flank.\n29:6 Comment: Walter Biersa was there.\n29:8 Comment: Birsa moves along the entire front of the attack.\n29:10 Comment: De Pauli.\n29:12 Comment: Go ahead.\n29:13 Comment: Dzeko is back.\n29:14 Comment: There was a violation of the rules.\n29:17 Comment: Against Fabio De Pauli.\n29:19 Comment: Here you go.\n29:22 Comment: They show us the main characters.\n29:24 Comment: Strothman is active today.\n29:26 Comment: But this is Rajan Ingavan.\n29:27 Comment: We are waiting for his appearance today.\n29:29 Comment: Especially if Roma fails to score on the flank.\n29:33 Comment: Second.\n29:35 Comment: I'll repeat, how the game goes.\n29:37 Comment: But in principle you should see Ingavan.\n29:39 Comment: He scored against Juventus.\n29:41 Comment: In the last round, Roma won 3-1.\n29:44 Comment: He said he was tired before that game.\n29:47 Comment: But I couldn't help but play.\n29:48 Comment: Today, apparently, he may not play yet.\n29:52 Comment: That's why I'm on the bench.\n29:56 Comment: Violation of Strotman's rules against Smel Bastian.\n30:3 Comment: Stefan El Sharawi.\n30:6 Comment: He scored for the seventh time this season.\n30:12 Comment: Half an hour of play is over.\n30:15 Comment: Birsa's pass didn't work.\n30:17 Comment: But Bastian is on the rebound.\n30:19 Comment: Kieva will support the ball a little.\n30:20 Comment: Lucas Castro.\n30:23 Comment: Tacha Torre.\n30:30 Comment: Strothman.\n30:32 Comment: Teroshi.\n30:39 Comment: And forward to El Sharawi.\n30:42 Comment: Looks like I was ahead of one defender.\n30:45 Comment: But Gamberi did not insure.\n30:47 Comment: The Kiev footballers haven't made a mistake here.\n30:50 Comment: Well, this is where De Pauli is wrong.\n30:53 Comment: Emerson pushed and almost pushed through.\n30:58 Comment: Tacha Torre is technical.\n31:4 Comment: Here, Kmichevsky-Sharawi, of course, won’t make it in time.\n31:7 Comment: Gamberini.\n31:13 Comment: Bastian.\n31:17 Comment: It was difficult for him to get through.\n31:18 Comment: He let go of the ball.\n31:20 Comment: And now Roma is on the attack.\n31:21 Comment: Mohammed Salah.\n31:23 Comment: But his transmission didn’t go through.\n31:25 Comment: On Jack.\n31:26 Comment: The Boshtin Tsesser was on site.\n31:28 Comment: But Roma will take the corner.\n31:30 Comment: And we look again at how the goal against Kiev happened.\n31:38 Comment: Well, it all started with Sorrentino kicking the ball.\n31:42 Comment: Well, probably not very successful.\n31:44 Comment: It’s just that Facio immediately brought him back into the attack.\n31:46 Comment: And then there was a goal.\n31:48 Comment: Cunningly played Jack.\n31:50 Comment: And great El Sharawi.\n31:51 Comment: Feed.\n31:53 Comment: Facio couldn't control the ball.\n31:56 Comment: Walter Birsa.\n31:58 Comment: Played risky, by the way.\n32:0 Comment: They could have taken it here.\n32:2 Comment: But Bastian saved the ball for his team.\n32:5 Comment: Cachatorre.\n32:7 Comment: Cast.\n32:9 Comment: Lucas Castro.\n32:11 Comment: The ball was defended by one Ruma player with his back.\n32:17 Comment: But Ryudima.\n32:19 Comment: One Ruma player, but Ryudima managed.\n32:27 Comment: Another player was El Sharawi, who came to the wrong flank.\n32:31 Comment: And now he's coming back.\n32:33 Comment: Highly welcomes Kiev again.\n32:37 Comment: But, however, without pressure.\n32:39 Comment: Simply denotes the presence of Derosi.\n32:49 Comment: The ball knocks out.\n32:59 Comment: Emerson.\n33:3 Comment: Derosi.\n33:7 Comment: El Sharawi.\n33:9 Comment: Derosi.\n33:11 Comment: Bastian has moved to the right flank.\n33:15 Comment: But now he's on the right flank.\n33:18 Comment: And De Pauli is now on the left.\n33:21 Comment: We see they swapped flanks.\n33:24 Comment: Interesting move.\n33:26 Comment: Usually in an attack these are the changes that happen.\n33:30 Comment: For half a time, players play one on one flank, the other on the other.\n33:35 Comment: And then they change.\n33:37 Comment: But now it happened in the three central midfielders.\n33:43 Comment: Let's watch this maneuver.\n33:46 Comment: Now it's breaking the rules.\n33:49 Comment: In midfield against Ivan Radavanovich.\n33:55 Comment: No yellow cards today yet.\n33:58 Comment: Oh, no, I'm sorry.\n34:1 Comment: Of course, how could we forget, Lucas Castro received a yellow card for taking off his shirt.\n34:6 Comment: But no, for some gross violations of the rules.\n34:9 Comment: Jack took the ball to his chest.\n34:12 Comment: Roma players throw the ball forward.\n34:15 Comment: But Salah couldn't accept.\n34:18 Comment: And here is the answer.\n34:20 Comment: Castro. The ball bounces.\n34:23 Comment: Emerson.\n34:26 Comment: Throws towards El Sharawi.\n34:29 Comment: El Sharawi with the ball. It's a free kick.\n34:32 Comment: He is met by Gamberini. Impact. Turn.\n34:34 Comment: It doesn’t quite work out for Strotman, but he manages to earn a corner.\n34:45 Comment: And Leandro Paredes will serve.\n34:48 Comment: As usual in this meeting\n34:53 Comment: The Argentine is leaving.\n34:56 Comment: And the serve. This is the third corner in this meeting.\n34:59 Comment: And he serves.\n35:1 Comment: Turn.\n35:4 Comment: And we are still waiting for the same ones. Rüdiger.\n35:7 Comment: Facio. Submission. Rüdiger. Discount.\n35:10 Comment: Birsa kicks the ball.\n35:13 Comment: And he rolls out of bounds.\n35:16 Comment: But now everyone is absolutely a player in Kyiv\n35:19 Comment: either in your own penalty area or near your own penalty area.\n35:24 Comment: And the eyes are just now\n35:27 Comment: They can't get through.\n35:29 Comment: And just now\n35:32 Comment: Stretched out a little.\n35:38 Comment: And De Pauli returned to his flank.\n35:41 Comment: It was a temporary solution\n35:44 Comment: with a change of places.\n35:47 Comment: Gamberini knocks out.\n35:52 Comment: Well, Damatu records the violation of the rules there.\n35:54 Comment: Faili vs. Stefan El Sharawi.\n36:0 Comment: The game has become sharper at the gates of Kyiv\n36:3 Comment: after the left flank became active.\n36:6 Comment: Then we saw mainly attacks from the right\n36:9 Comment: with the connection of Salah.\n36:12 Comment: And this, apparently, somewhat lulled the vigilance of Kyiv football players.\n36:15 Comment: They began to miss attacks on El Sharawi's other flank.\n36:18 Comment: Just scored a goal. But it also pumps up the mood.\n36:21 Comment: Paredes serves.\n36:24 Comment: Well, Lucas Castro gets the ball first here.\n36:29 Comment: And gradually comes out, comes out of defense\n36:32 Comment: Kyiv players. Saw Bastian.\n36:35 Comment: Lucas Castro.\n36:38 Comment: There was no hand. Couldn't get through.\n36:41 Comment: De Pauli, Bastian. Stops.\n36:44 Comment: They're both on this flank now.\n36:47 Comment: Radovanovic. Continue to Birsa.\n36:50 Comment: Kyiv players are changing positions.\n36:52 Comment: Eeeeeee! Scoring!\n36:55 Comment: Inglese scores a goal.\n36:58 Comment: And the defenders slept through this attack. Instant.\n37:1 Comment: But it was asking for it, it was asking for it\n37:4 Comment: Here is the transfer. And here they have already euthanized\n37:7 Comment: Veronese guests. Let's see now\n37:10 Comment: once again. Ingles' ninth goal this season.\n37:13 Comment: He is compared to Sergio Pelesier.\n37:16 Comment: Look at this. Walter Birsa.\n37:19 Comment: This attack has been promoted for a long time\n37:22 Comment: passively. The Romans played in the selection.\n37:25 Comment: Well, here they can only look at each other.\n37:28 Comment: Roma players. Manulas na Fazio.\n37:31 Comment: They were attracted by the attack. They returned.\n37:34 Comment: And here such things are already happening. Roberto Inglese.\n37:37 Comment: He is the author of the goal and assist today\n37:40 Comment: pass to Lucas Castro. And here's a pass\n37:43 Comment: Birsa gave the goal.\n37:46 Comment: Francesco Totti. Directors for us today\n37:49 Comment: It will be shown often. There hasn't been a reason yet.\n37:52 Comment: But the longer the match goes on than\n37:55 Comment: The more unfortunate the result for Roma, the more\n37:58 Comment: hints that Francesco is missing.\n38:1 Comment: Maybe in some episodes of the game this really is true.\n38:4 Comment: So I won’t talk about the conflict today.\n38:7 Comment: Totti and Spalletti. Who is wrong, who is right.\n38:10 Comment: Totti is waiting for Veronia.\n38:13 Comment: And the Kiev players are waiting. Lucas Castro,\n38:16 Comment: the author of the goal scored, he recorded the song\n38:19 Comment: with guitar for Francesco Totti.\n38:22 Comment: He said that he was just as important to Rome,\n38:25 Comment: Like the Colosseum. Same symbol.\n38:28 Comment: And Totti's symbolic presence is of course important\n38:31 Comment: for the team. Maybe he'll show up today.\n38:34 Comment: Sergio Pelesier, another veteran.\n38:37 Comment: Today also in reserve. He supported Totti.\n38:40 Comment: He said it was in vain.\n38:43 Comment: Spalletti didn't let him out at the stadium\n38:46 Comment: Meadsa in Milan. Didn't let me say goodbye\n38:49 Comment: With Milan. After all, Totti is leaving, most likely.\n38:52 Comment: Jack's offside.\n38:55 Comment: But he didn’t and didn’t give. Today is a different match.\n38:58 Comment: And we saw it close up for the first time\n39:1 Comment: Totti today. Here's a goal.\n39:4 Comment: Inglaza and Lucas Castro also went for this ball.\n39:7 Comment: Kieva, well done.\n39:10 Comment: Kieva approached this meeting with some passion.\n39:14 Comment: Well, Luciano Spalletti.\n39:17 Comment: It's clear that he can be now.\n39:22 Comment: His team needs more than just\n39:25 Comment: attack more sharply, but also defend.\n39:28 Comment: It would seem that the best thing to do defensively is to take the ball,\n39:31 Comment: don't give it away. But that was enough\n39:34 Comment: 10-15 seconds for the serve to pass\n39:37 Comment: and a goal was scored.\n39:40 Comment: Prolan de Moran promised to tell\n39:43 Comment: about the prize he received.\n39:46 Comment: The award called Alenatore De Isoni.\n39:49 Comment: This is a dream coach.\n39:52 Comment: They participate in the annual tournament\n39:55 Comment: in the city of Arco. Tournament named after a journalist\n39:58 Comment: Beppi Viola. And every year they determine\n40:1 Comment: the best coach, in their opinion.\n40:4 Comment: This season it's Roland de Moran.\n40:7 Comment: This is such a non-standard move. It would seem, choose\n40:10 Comment: Juventus coach. No. They chose Moran.\n40:13 Comment: Last year there was Sally from Naples.\n40:16 Comment: Roma attacks.\n40:19 Comment: Spalletti is not in the top three.\n40:22 Comment: Dzeko wins.\n40:25 Comment: Air! Sarantino Reacts to Impact\n40:28 Comment: Mohamed Salah.\n40:31 Comment: Point blank. The score should have been tied.\n40:34 Comment: The Egyptian failed to break through Sarantino.\n40:37 Comment: Sarantino is playing great matches this season.\n40:40 Comment: Do you remember what happened in Milan against Inter?\n40:43 Comment: We lost then. But what did he do\n40:46 Comment: Stefano Sarantino?\n40:49 Comment: Also a middle-aged goalkeeper.\n40:52 Comment: He just helped out now.\n40:55 Comment: Today he saved his team twice in the first half.\n40:58 Comment: By the way, here\n41:1 Comment: Chieva won in Verona\n41:4 Comment: Just once for Roma.\n41:7 Comment: It was\n41:10 Comment: that's enough already...\n41:13 Comment: Well, how? A long time ago.\n41:16 Comment: Recently. In the 2012-2013 season only\n41:19 Comment: We won. We won before in Rome.\n41:22 Comment: In Rome.\n41:25 Comment: Just a few seasons ago.\n41:28 Comment: De Pavlio played the ball. The ball was against\n41:31 Comment: Emerson.\n41:34 Comment: And the ball also went away from Brazil. 2-1.\n41:37 Comment: This match was not predicted\n41:40 Comment: special intrigue. It seemed that Roma would win.\n41:43 Comment: And he will win relatively easily. But Spalete warned.\n41:46 Comment: And the players said to Spalete,\n41:49 Comment: What\n41:52 Comment: this is wrong.\n41:55 Comment: Apparently that's what happened. Salah.\n41:58 Comment: Kick! Goal!\n42:1 Comment: That was Mohamed Salah's shot.\n42:4 Comment: He thanks the Almighty.\n42:7 Comment: 2-2. Mohamed Salah.\n42:10 Comment: What he should have done a minute and a half ago,\n42:13 Comment: I just made my 14th goal\n42:16 Comment: Egyptian in the season. And what a technical blow it was.\n42:19 Comment: Tweaked it. Let's look again now.\n42:22 Comment: Give the ball to Salah.\n42:25 Comment: There was a rebound from the defender.\n42:28 Comment: It seemed to me from Gobi. Yes!\n42:31 Comment: Look how fate rewards you.\n42:34 Comment: Remember what we said at the beginning of the meeting,\n42:37 Comment: The score was 0-0, but the ball hit Gobi in the crook of his arm\n42:40 Comment: during Roma's attack in the penalty area.\n42:43 Comment: And then we debated whether there was a penalty.\n42:46 Comment: And now it's exactly right\n42:49 Comment: This is the same place where the ball is essentially sent\n42:52 Comment: And here was the rebound. Of course, Salah's goal.\n42:57 Comment: This season, by the way, they have already taken it away from Salah\n43:0 Comment: one goal due to, as it seemed to me, an unobvious own goal.\n43:5 Comment: Opponent, it was a match with Bolonia, if I'm not mistaken.\n43:9 Comment: Salah made a trick and one goal was counted\n43:12 Comment: own goal.\n43:15 Comment: But now no one will take away Salah’s 14th goal.\n43:20 Comment: 2-2. That's how productive our first half was in Verona.\n43:26 Comment: And there's still a second one to come.\n43:29 Comment: And Roma doesn't have enough of what we see now\n43:32 Comment: in the upper left corner of the screens.\n43:35 Comment: Score 2-2 is not enough.\n43:38 Comment: He allows Napoleon to win today against Fiorentina,\n43:41 Comment: come to second place.\n43:44 Comment: I'm not even talking about the championship race.\n43:47 Comment: If Roma plays like this today,\n43:50 Comment: and if Napoleon doesn't win,\n43:55 Comment: Juventus can, in principle,\n43:58 Comment: tomorrow play very calmly with Kratons,\n44:3 Comment: Score one point and become Italian champion.\n44:8 Comment: In fact, many people already consider Juve to be the champion.\n44:12 Comment: That's probably how it will be.\n44:15 Comment: It's hard to beat Cratona and Bolonia.\n44:18 Comment: Juventus needs to get the champion early\n44:21 Comment: To calmly prepare for the Champions League final.\n44:24 Comment: But, who knows, the Kratons are fighting for survival.\n44:26 Comment: And Roma, Roma attacks in his match.\n44:29 Comment: Rüdiger, serve!\n44:32 Comment: The ball misses Mohamed Salah.\n44:35 Comment: Tsesar knocks him out. Last minute of the first half.\n44:41 Comment: Passed in Roma's attack.\n44:44 Comment: Stratman. Rüdiger is getting more expensive in the ball.\n44:46 Comment: But here Antonio Rüdiger played with the subtlety of a woodcutter.\n44:53 Comment: A player that many want to see in their ranks.\n44:57 Comment: I mean the clubs are big and rich.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Antonio Damata will recount, let me remind you of his name, the main arbiter of this meeting.\n0:4 Comment: The game resumed. Well, briefly the composition.\n0:7 Comment: 70th Sarantino at the gates of Chieva, 5th Gamberini, 12th team captain Caesar, 18th Gobi, 29th Cacciatore.\n0:16 Comment: Kiev has no games now.\n0:19

Manulas,\n0:48 Comment: 5th Paredes, 6th Strotman, 16th team captain Derosi, 9th Dzeko, 11th Salah, 92nd El Sharawi.\n0:57 Comment: Burn Luciano while the head coach of Roma.\n1:1 Comment: Stanislav Minin is still commenting on this meeting for you.\n1:5 Comment: Radavanovich, the pressure of the Roma players, well, half of it, at least, the Kiev players come out from under him.\n1:13 Comment: And who will be on the selection list here?\n1:15 Comment: First, first comes Gemberini.\n1:22 Comment: Emerson.\n1:23 Comment: Because of the side.\n1:25 Comment: Paredes.\n1:26 Comment: Ottime.\n1:27 Comment: El Sharawi, the author of the first goal scored by Roma in this meeting, violated the rules.\n1:32 Comment: Yellow card.\n1:33 Comment: Lucas Castro, who is not playing, has already received one today, and the second one is being received by a young talent, in my opinion, De Paul.\n1:41 Comment: Or was it Radavanovich?\n1:42 Comment: They show Radavanovich.\n1:43 Comment: Yes, the Serb has Gorchishnik.\n1:46 Comment: He will miss the next meeting, just like Castro.\n1:51 Comment: Well, it's just...\n1:57 Comment: Braided, as they say, for real.\n2:0 Comment: And he managed to hit.\n2:2 Comment: And braid it.\n2:4 Comment: This is such a unique skill.\n2:7 Comment: Penalty.\n2:9 Comment: Innings.\n2:10 Comment: There is no impact.\n2:11 Comment: The blow didn't work.\n2:13 Comment: De Rossi came out to the far post.\n2:17 Comment: De Rossi crashed in the last rounds.\n2:20 Comment: Three matches in a row with him.\n2:21 Comment: This has never happened before.\n2:23 Comment: And I must say that Kieva...\n2:27 Comment: This was the team that De Rossi scored against most often in his entire football biography.\n2:33 Comment: Four balls.\n2:34 Comment: And three for Marc Antonio Bentegodi.\n2:37 Comment: There are also such statistics.\n2:39 Comment: So, if he distinguished himself now, I think it would be significant.\n2:45 Comment: But so far this has not happened.\n2:47 Comment: While Roma is playing with Kieva to a draw.\n2:49 Comment: And so far this bill does not suit Rome at all.\n2:53 Comment: And so far Spalletti has not made a single change.\n2:56 Comment: Rudy Herr.\n2:57 Comment: Too strong pass to Mohamed Salat.\n3:0 Comment: Even the jet Egyptian could not keep up with this draw.\n3:6 Comment: Here is the Sarantino gate.\n3:8 Comment: Chieva took the lead twice during the first half.\n3:13 Comment: Castro and Inglese stood out.\n3:16 Comment: Well, the reserves are warming up.\n3:18 Comment: Totti is warming up, but Neingalan is also warming up.\n3:21 Comment: And the director shows us that yes, with a symbol, a bandera, a flag, as they call it in Dali.\n3:27 Comment: It’s clear, but Roma is now attacking Ingalan, which ends with the referee’s whistle.\n3:33 Comment: And Mohamed Salah ended up on the sidelines.\n3:37 Comment: But no, it’s not about the side.\n3:39 Comment: He just played along with himself, like they showed his hand here, he played along with himself under his armpit.\n3:47 Comment: And as a result, Kieva will resume the game.\n3:57 Comment: Salah.\n4:1 Comment: With the ball again, with Strotman.\n4:4 Comment: It’s great, after all, they understand each other, they played well.\n4:6 Comment: But, word, too strong a pass to Mohamed Salah.\n4:10 Comment: And here's the error.\n4:11 Comment: But Sarantino makes a timely correction here.\n4:14 Comment: They rolled the ball and Jack saw it.\n4:16 Comment: And he rushed at him.\n4:19 Comment: But Stefano Sarantino was the first.\n4:21 Comment: Rüdiger.\n4:24 Comment: Salah.\n4:25 Comment: Rüdiger.\n4:27 Comment: Serves.\n4:28 Comment: And there will be another corner at Stefano Sarantino’s goal.\n4:33 Comment: Tsesar knocked the ball out.\n4:39 Comment: Salah gently returned the ball to Rudiger.\n4:45 Comment: The submission did not go through.\n4:50 Comment: Paredes serves.\n4:53 Comment: Rüdiger.\n4:55 Comment: The ball hits the shoulder.\n4:57 Comment: But he also hits the Kiev player.\n5:2 Comment: And Leandro Paredes moves from one flank to the other to take the corner.\n5:17 Comment: We are waiting for his submission.\n5:18 Comment: Pelese.\n5:19 Comment: By the way, he came on the defensive.\n5:20 Comment: It is located at the bar.\n5:22 Comment: And, by the way, in my opinion, he

    "summary": "AS Roma pulled off a remarkable 5-3 victory over Chievo at the Marcantonio Bentegodi Stadium in a match that presented an engaging ebb and flow throughout the entire ninety minutes. The clash was marked by goals, tactical nuances, and some commendable individual performances.\n\nRoma lined up with Wojciech Szczesny in goal, behind a defensive setup comprising Antonio Rüdiger, Federico Fazio, Kostas Manolas, and Emerson. The midfield trio included Daniel De Rossi, who captained the side, Kevin Strootman, and Leandro Paredes. The attacking threat was offered by the trident of Edin Džeko, Mohamed Salah, and Stephan El Shaarawy.\n\nChievo, on the other hand, took the field under head coach Rolando Maran with Stefano Sorrentino between the posts. Their defense featured Fabrizio Cacciatore, Alessandro Gamberini, Bostjan Cesar, and Massimo Gobbi. The midfield comprised Lucas Castro, Ivan Radovanovic, and Samuel Bastien, while the forward positions saw Walter Birsa playing just behind the lone striker Roberto Inglese.\n\nFrom the onset, it was evident that both teams came to play with intent. Chievo donned their dark uniforms, showing early glimpses of their attacking prowess. In the first few moments, Radovanovic tried his luck from long range, signaling Chievo's willingness to test Roma’s defense early. However, it was Lucas Castro who opened the scoring with a well-worked team goal. In the 14th minute, a deft cross from Fabrizio Cacciatore found Inglese, who cleverly headed it down to Castro. The latter didn’t let it bounce and struck a clean shot past Szczesny, giving Chievo the lead and electrifying the home crowd.\n\nRoma responded with urgency, probing Chievo’s defense. Salah's pace and Strootman’s vision began to challenge the defensive resolve of Chievo. Eventually, their efforts paid off when Stephan El Shaarawy netted the equalizer. In the 27th minute, Džeko showed intelligence with his movement, dragging defenders out of position and creating a lane for El Shaarawy to dart through and slot the ball past Sorrentino.\n\nChievo wasn’t too disheartened by the equalizer and continued with their attacking mindset. Their persistence bore fruit again in the 37th minute when Inglese himself got on the scoresheet. The move was initiated from a sweeping play down the right with Birsa orchestrating the final pass. Inglese timed his run perfectly to meet Birsa's cross and volleyed past the diving Szczesny, making it 2-1 and re-establishing Chievo’s lead.\n\nRoma, understanding the stakes, ramped up the pressure again. Salah, a constant threat on the right wing, seized the opportunity to level once more. In the 42nd minute, after some lovely interplay on the edge of the area, Salah executed a precise shot that took a slight deflection off Gobbi, deceiving Sorrentino and nestling into the net, leveling the score at 2-2 right before halftime.\n\nThe second half resumed with both teams making strategic moves. However, it was Roma who seemed more determined to dictate the pace. Luciano Spalletti's men started to apply heavy pressure on Chievo’s backline. Salah was particularly dynamic, linking up well with Strootman and Džeko. \n\nIn the 58th minute, El Shaarawy doubled his tally and put Roma ahead for the first time in the match. Strootman’s vision and precise pass pierced through Chievo’s defensive line, finding El Shaarawy in space. He calmly slotted it under Sorrentino, giving Roma a crucial 3-2 lead.\n\nMoments later, Spalletti decided to make tactical adjustments, introducing Radja Nainggolan to bolster the midfield and maintain the attacking momentum. It paid off handsomely. In the 77th minute, Salah struck again, showcasing his impeccable dribbling skills and finishing prowess. His shot from a tight angle proved too much for Sorrentino, extending Roma’s lead to 4-2 and dampening Chievo’s comeback hopes.\n\nAs the match entered its final stages, Chievo’s spirit was undeterred. They pressed high and found a reward in the 86th minute when Inglese scored his second of the match. A well-placed cross from Pelesier met Inglese’s head, beating Szczesny and narrowing the deficit to 4-3.\n\nRoma, seeking to ensure the victory, saw Džeko step up in the 89th minute with a stunning long-range effort. His shot from outside the box glided into the top corner, leaving Sorrentino with no chance and sealing the match at 5-3.\n\nThe match concluded with a final flourish as Spalletti, in a nod to the rich history of the club, brought on Francesco Totti, who received a heartfelt ovation from both sets of fans. Though Totti had little time to influence the game, his mere presence was a testament to the club's celebrated legacy.\n\nIn summary, Roma’s 5-3 comeback against Chievo was a thrilling spectacle, highlighted by tactical battles, individual brilliance, and moments of sheer unpredictability. It solidified Roma’s pursuit of a second-place finish in Serie A, while Chievo, though defeated, earned plaudits for their spirited performance."
