At least it catches up with Piscaro.\n1:59 Comment: Piscaro 7 points. Or maybe Piscaro will overtake.\n2:2 Comment: The task is clear. Palermo, as always, is experiencing traditional problems.\n2:8 Comment: In the last few years. Unstable composition. Regular changes of coaches.\n2:11 Comment: And to these problems was added a not the best financial situation.\n2:16 Comment: To which Maudi Tsiotzamparini has already spoken.\n2:18 Comment: Which is now urgently looking for new investors.\n2:21 Comment: He's trying to sell the club. But it seems like he's found the next Chinese in Italian football.\n2:26 Comment: Let's see if this is true or if it's not a bluster on the part of the President of Palermo.\n2:33 Comment: Show Jesus. Plays a couple in Odessa.\n2:41 Comment: Our meeting begins quite calmly. Without any fuss.\n2:49 Comment: Roma chooses to control the ball in the center of the field.\n2:54 Comment: Emers also resets incorrectly.\n2:57 Comment: Roma has losses. I didn't say anything.\n3:2 Comment: One of those who could be in the starting line-up today is Alexandru Forenza.\n3:7 Comment: Of course, instead of Emerso. But that’s the coaches’ decision.\n3:11 Comment: Forenza has a slight injury. Well, they are also taking care of Kevin Strotman.\n3:16 Comment: Kevin Strotman is also on the bench.\n3:20 Comment: And of course, special attention to Francesco Totti.\n3:23 Comment: He played brilliantly again in the Europa League.\n3:25 Comment: Made some great assists.\n3:29 Comment: Roma drew 3-3 on Thursday.\n3:34 Comment: That evening. And Totti is on the bench today.\n3:38 Comment: But I hope that Totti will appear on the field.\n3:40 Comment: This cannot be ruled out. Moreover, Totti is clearly in good shape.\n3:45 Comment: This can be seen in the Europa League for sure.\n3:50 Comment: El Sharawi played well. Such a feint from the Pharaoh.\n3:53 Comment: Naigulan came running here.\n3:57 Comment: And for both of them they earned a free kick.\n4:0 Comment: Marganello.

Umicha.\n4:54 Comment: And again the pitch was unsuccessful.\n4:58 Comment: It's really Roma's choice.\n5:0 Comment: Paredes again. And again the ball flies off Paredes' feet.\n5:3 Comment: In general, three attempts were all unsuccessful.\n5:6 Comment: So. Speaking of Apolloroma.\n5:9 Comment: He's not one of those players playing today.\n5:11 Comment: Which could really enhance the game.\n5:14 Comment: Gonzalez, Raikovich, Troikovsky.\n5:17 Comment: They're all injured.\n5:19 Comment: As for the composition as a whole.\n5:20 Comment: The absence of Oscar Hilemark is impressive.\n5:23 Comment: Who became in many ways the team's leading player.\n5:26 Comment: And Robert Kyson will also stock up.\n5:29 Comment: He's not playing today either.\n5:32 Comment: But perhaps these two players can strengthen the game from the bench.\n5:39 Comment: Ninggolan enters the fray. Dzeko.\n5:41 Comment: There's Gutsy here. There's a lot of fighting.\n5:43 Comment: And he will see that he picks up the ball quite easily.\n5:46 Comment: Apollera last won almost a month ago.\n5:48 Comment:  September 21.\n5:50 Comment: It happened not even almost, but more than a month ago.\n5:52 Comment: It was September 21st.\n5:55 Comment: Apollera beat Atalanta 1-0 on the road.\n5:58 Comment: And after that there were two defeats.\n6:2 Comment: From Juventus and Torino.\n6:6 Comment: From two tournament clubs.\n6:8 Comment: And if Yuwei lost to Apoller quite decently.\n6:11 Comment: Let's just say 0-1 only.\n6:13 Comment: To Torino defeated Apollera 4-1.\n6:15 Comment: And the game was a home game for Apoller.\n6:18 Comment: Well, also between these matches there was a meeting with Amdori.\n6:22 Comment: Apollera drew 1-1 on the road.\n6:26 Comment: These are the results after 9 rounds for Apoller.\n6:30 Comment: And I already said Roma.\n6:32 Comment: Roma basically won two matches in a row against Napoli.\n6:34 Comment: Now Dzeko is with the ball.\n6:36 Comment: We have to make a pass. We have to make a pass.\n6:38 Comment:  How so?\n6:40 Comment: How did Dzeko play like that?\n6:43 Comment: You can't be so greedy.\n6:47 Comment: Aravi was absolutely alone.\n6:50 Comment: And of course we had to make a pass to him.\n6:52 Comment: That's it. And before Napoli, Roma beat no one in a multi-match.\n6:56 Comment: 2-1. That is, in principle, 6 points in such two difficult matches.\n7:1 Comment: And indeed Roma now has a chance to at least regain some intrigue in the fight against Cudetto.\n7:9 Comment: Because it seems like Milan got it back for themselves yesterday, winning against Juventus.\n7:14 Comment: But I gave Roma every chance.\n7:16 Comment: Because Roma should definitely take advantage of this chance.\n7:21 Comment: Although few tours have been played.\n7:24 Comment: This is the 9th round. But still, some outlines of the table are already taking shape.\n7:28 Comment: This also needs to be understood. It is important to understand.\n7:34 Comment: Corner kick. Answer according to Lermo.\n7:37 Comment: Feed.\n7:40 Comment: According to Lermo.\n7:42 Comment: I played the corner better.\n7:44 Comment: But Diamanti is here too. A great master of standards.\n7:46 Comment: There will be one more try.\n7:48 Comment: U Pohler. Because the standard.\n7:50 Comment: Now from the opposite flank. Or not?\n7:55 Comment: No. No. The ball apparently flew out.\n7:59 Comment: Out of bounds.\n8:1 Comment: Here is Alexandro Diamanti.\n8:3 Comment: Special attention to him. Of course, right now Diamanti, of all the players on the field.\n8:7 Comment: Of course, the main thing is striking force.\n8:10 Comment: To the composition. According to Lermo.\n8:12 Comment: I've lost a lot of weight over the past few years.\n8:16 Comment: Dzheko. Puts up the body.\n8:19 Comment: Alice.\n8:25 Comment: Pushes Jacko out.\n8:28 Comment: And out in favor of Roma.\n8:30 Comment: Salah.

And unsuccessfully.\n9:9 Comment: Carrying out the ball.\n9:27 Comment: Diamanti.\n9:29 Comment: Morganella is wrong again. Elcharraoui.\n9:32 Comment: And such a pass back at his own brethren.\n9:35 Comment: Disappeared due to autism.\n9:48 Comment: Emerson.\n9:52 Comment: One more pass back. This is Salah.\n9:55 Comment: Receives the ball on the right flank.\n9:57 Comment: And pass to Dzeko. Good Dzeko.\n9:59 Comment: I handled the ball poorly. Elcharraoui didn't quite handle it either, I think it was the right decision.\n10:4 Comment: We've already covered it for the Angolans.\n10:6 Comment: But Roma is pressing. Roma is improving so much now.\n10:9 Comment: In 10 minutes.\n10:11 Comment: He tries to crush his opponent.\n10:13 Comment: But, I repeat, with all the adoration. With all the adoration for Palermo.\n10:17 Comment: Roma must win today.\n10:28 Comment: Palermo.\n10:46 Comment: Sonic.\n10:56 Comment: Zionek.\n10:58 Comment: To Morganella.\n11:0 Comment:  Big problems.\n11:2 Comment: With how to pick up the ball.\n11:4 Comment: Even, I’ll say more, with how the out is played.\n11:7 Comment: Elcharraoui.\n11:9 Comment:  Beautiful.\n11:11 Comment: Elcharraoui plays at the heels. Second time.\n11:13 Comment: For the match.\n11:19 Comment: Emerson.\n11:21 Comment: Gandroparades.\n11:23 Comment: Facio.\n11:28 Comment: Na Angolan. Derosi.\n11:30 Comment: And breaking the rules.\n11:32 Comment: Breaking the rules.\n11:35 Comment: Now there will be a verbal warning, apparently to Chochev.\n11:39 Comment: Very young.\n11:42 Comment: Bulgarian midfielder Ivaila Chochev.\n11:45 Comment: Chase.\n11:47 Comment: Bulgarian midfielder Ivaila Chochev.\n11:50 Comment: At number 18.\n11:52 Comment: Derosi.\n12:4 Comment: Jesus.\n12:6 Comment: Derosi.\n12:8 Comment: Zalah.\n12:12 Comment: The ball remains in play.

Dzeko is on the flank.\n12:23 Comment: What's interesting is that he is now an assistant.\n12:25 Comment: And what a pass Dzeko makes.\n12:27 Comment: What a most subtle transmission from Dzeko.\n12:31 Comment: Perhaps this did not happen by chance.\n12:33 Comment:  But still.\n12:35 Comment: No, not by chance.\n12:37 Comment: Dzeko looked at the far post, at the far flank.\n12:39 Comment: Elcharraoui was there.\n12:41 Comment: And Dzeko did it.\n12:42 Comment: Dzeko did everything right.\n12:44 Comment: And it’s not his fault that his partner didn’t score.\n12:49 Comment: In 100% of the situation.\n12:52 Comment: Rome had a great chance.\n12:58 Comment: But he didn't use it.\n13:4 Comment: But in general, of course, such desirability is already being realized.\n13:12 Comment: perquè then it plays into your head.\n13:15 Comment: But Lermo, he still has a lot of time.\n13:23 Comment: Fuck off, we know nothing about the frog.\n13:29 Comment: The conditions are gone.\n13:31 Comment: G intrigued like this.\n13:33 Comment: Read it early.\n13:35 Comment: And was burned.\n13:37 Comment: He'll stay one more time and take everything away.\n13:40 Comment: This statement was initiated by the Turk\n13:42 Comment: There's probably nothing wrong with that anymore.\n13:51 Comment: El Sharawey played in the match against Austria in the Europa League.\n13:54 Comment: I will definitely return to this game.\n13:56 Comment: And, curiously, El Sharawey scored two goals.\n14:0 Comment: First and second. But at the same time Roma could not win.\n14:4 Comment: After all, from 3-1 to the 82nd minute.\n14:6 Comment: At the end, Roma missed two.\n14:9 Comment: But in general the lineup was quite interesting in the match against Austria.\n14:13 Comment: Although the line of defense was the same.\n14:15 Comment: But it’s clear why. Because too many people were injured.\n14:19 Comment: How Palermo goes on the attack now.\n14:21 Comment: Chochev played the ball well from the center of the field.\n14:24 Comment: Chochev... We need to make a decision.\n14:31 Comment: The attack continues at Palermo.\n14:33 Comment: Marganella...\n14:35 Comment: Marganella also doesn't play very confidently.\n14:39 Comment: More free now.

One more try.\n15:3 Comment: Again Alexandru Gatsey.\n15:6 Comment: Enrique Sionek.\n15:13 Comment: Already played easily by Aravi.\n15:15 Comment: And already Jacko.\n15:17 Comment: This is the show.\n15:19 Comment:  And one more.\n15:21 Comment: The transmission was almost done by Dzeko.\n15:24 Comment: Something just absolutely exquisite from Dzeko.\n15:31 Comment: It is clear that Salah is good too.\n15:34 Comment: He accelerated and essentially overtook his opponent.\n15:38 Comment: But what about Dzeko? And he cut out the pass.\n15:41 Comment: Not obviously played by Dzeko.\n15:43 Comment: And at the same time, both times the game was boldly escalated.\n15:46 Comment: Basically, it was a header, but Aravi failed to convert it at the moment.\n15:53 Comment: Dzyamanti. The ball was handled technically by Alexander Dzyamanti.\n15:59 Comment: Gatsei.\n16:2 Comment:  And one more.\n16:16 Comment: No rules violation. You can play.\n16:19 Comment: I contradicted everything.\n16:21 Comment: Fase. Naingovan.\n16:23 Comment: With the ball, Raja Naingovan.\n16:25 Comment: Alsamir.\n16:27 Comment: Salah. Didn't handle the ball.\n16:38 Comment: Alsamir.\n16:41 Comment: It was Assam, I think.\n16:45 Comment: Everything was so obvious.\n16:51 Comment: Well, from the point of view of the position of the players on the field.\n16:54 Comment: Although, maybe I'm wrong.\n16:57 Comment: El Sharaoui. Gaining speed on the left flank.\n17:2 Comment: Kick into the far corner. Dzeko.\n17:4 Comment: Should have been first in finishing.\n17:7 Comment: First.\n17:9 Comment: Another good chance.\n17:11 Comment: In general, Roma, he’s acting quite well at these moments.\n17:17 Comment: Let's look again at what kind of pass he gave.\n17:22 Comment: Dzeko. And then Salah.\n17:24 Comment: But he's actually himself.\n17:26 Comment: Guilty.\n17:29 Comment: His speed is just right.\n17:31 Comment: But Dalia has already lost control of his speed.\n17:36 Comment: Salah. No offside. We can play.\n17:39 Comment: Salah. What can we come up with? El Sharaoui is hit.\n17:42 Comment: I got into trouble with my treatment.\n17:45 Comment: The active Roma football player himself.\n17:47 Comment: In the first 18 minutes. I think it's undeniably El Sharaoui.\n17:52 Comment: He's on time everywhere. He's already hit his opponent with a turn three times.\n17:59 Comment: Jacko.\n18:2 Comment: El Sharaoui again.\n18:7 Comment: And the ball leaves the field.\n18:27 Comment: There was no fula. We were getting attention.\n18:30 Comment: It is clear that they held each other with Anzhelkovich.\n18:33 Comment: But this is not a violation of the rules. In my opinion.\n18:39 Comment: Posovec. Croatian goalkeeper Josif Posovec.\n18:45 Comment: I changed my mind. I wanted to play the ball on the short defenders first.\n18:49 Comment: In the end, it’s probably safer and calmer to shoot there into the center of the field.\n18:55 Comment: Polerman is trying to impose a fight here.\n18:59 Comment: But you see, all this didn’t last long.\n19:3 Comment: Joan Jesu with the ball.\n19:12 Comment: The result was an accurate transmission, albeit by accident to El Sharaoui.\n19:15 Comment: With the ball again. Two players against him.\n19:19 Comment: But it didn't work out.\n19:21 Comment: Diamantea.\n19:23 Comment: Paredes.\n19:27 Comment: Emerson.\n19:29 Comment: Emerson hits. The Brazilian has a good shot.\n19:32 Comment: It was a very good shot.\n19:35 Comment: Number 33.\n19:39 Comment: Emerson, who is only 22 years old.\n19:44 Comment: The shot was very dangerous. Very dangerous.\n19:50 Comment: Fazio de Rossi.\n19:52 Comment: Dzheko, of course.\n19:54 Comment: Manolas.\n19:56 Comment: Fazio is first on the ball. Shot.\n19:58 Comment: But above the gate.\n20:0 Comment: Federico Fazio, Argentine defender.\n20:2 Comment: That's how they took him as a spare.\n20:4 Comment: In many ways.\n20:6 Comment: But because of the injuries that Roma has.\n20:8 Comment: And we know that it doesn't play.\n20:10 Comment: Vermaelen is not playing at the beginning of the report.\n20:12 Comment: Rüdeger doesn't play.\n20:14 Comment: For this reason, now it's...\n20:16 Comment: Quite a well-coordinated team.\n20:18 Comment: Fazio-Manolas.\n20:26 Comment: In fact, there are no more defenders in reserve.\n20:29 Comment: But it is quite possible that if necessary, injury, disqualification\n20:34 Comment: will play in the place of defender Daniel de Rossi.\n20:36 Comment: Captain Futuro, as they call him.\n20:39 Comment: But now Captain Futuro, as they call him.\n20:41 Comment: And he plays fullback.\n20:43 Comment: Captain Futuro, as they call him.\n20:45 Comment: But now the captain is already in the present time.\n20:48 Comment: Daniel de Rossi.\n20:50 Comment: Police Scientist\n21:12 Comment:  One more thing.\n21:14 Comment: Breaking the rules.\n21:16 Comment: And again the fallie de Rossi.\n21:18 Comment: There’s definitely nothing surprising about this.\n21:20 Comment: It's traditional for...\n21:25 Comment: ...the supporting high-back of Roma and the Italian national team.\n21:28 Comment: He usually has a lot of halyards.\n21:31 Comment: Well, a free kick.\n21:40 Comment: Alexandru Diamanti.\n21:44 Comment: This is such an original joke.\n21:46 Comment: And Paredes plays somewhat fussily.\n21:51 Comment: We probably could have used a different ball.\n21:59 Comment: Now Paredes is hitting.\n22:6 Comment:  Forward.\n22:10 Comment: Valera Mazamechna was hooked.\n22:13 Comment: Palermo caught the ball.\n22:15 Comment: What is important and what is rare in our game.\n22:18 Comment: But Ilya Anisterovski's serve didn't work.\n22:24 Comment: Ilya Anisterovski is a new hope.\n22:28 Comment: Palermo, football player from Macedonia.\n22:31 Comment: I said that the composition was overwhelming.\n22:34 Comment: Because these stars used to grow.\n22:39 Comment: Footballers who were leaders in Palermo.\n22:43 Comment: They were different times.\n22:45 Comment: Cavani, Pastore, Debalo.\n22:49 Comment: Even earlier before that.\n22:51 Comment: And Mauri.\n22:53 Comment: They all sold for a lot of money.\n22:56 Comment: Debalo, Pastore, Cavani.\n22:58 Comment: They became super stars of European football.\n23:1 Comment: And now, with all due respect to Ilya Anisterovsky.\n23:5 Comment: He is a talented football player.\n23:8 Comment: He's not young.\n23:10 Comment:  25 years.\n23:12 Comment: And he will become a super star.\n23:15 Comment: Yes, there is a Hungarian Shalay.\n23:20 Comment: To which large advances are given.\n23:23 Comment: There is Yayala.\n23:25 Comment: Chochev.\n23:27 Comment: But these are football players of a different level.\n23:30 Comment: Than those whom I have already named.\n23:35 Comment: Breaking the rules.\n23:39 Comment: Anisterovsky.\n23:43 Comment: Four. Satisfied.\n23:45 Comment: Paeres.\n23:48 Comment: I was tempted to pass.\n23:54 Comment: Derosi.\n23:58 Comment: Another pass forward into the field.\n24:1 Comment: Niangollan turned around.\n24:3 Comment: On Dzeko's show. Dzeko.\n24:7 Comment: Too. Too.\n24:9 Comment: Dzeko's maneuver was understandable for the defender.\n24:12 Comment: It hurts like hell.\n24:14 Comment: Easy to figure out.\n24:16 Comment: But here, of course, Niangollan is good.\n24:18 Comment: What would, firstly, turn the opponent around.\n24:20 Comment: He turned around himself.\n24:22 Comment: And here's the most important point.\n24:24 Comment: A nuance.

be done for\n15:6 Comment: it was important for the economy to do so, indeed now the police stood so that the paradox remained in\n15:14 Comment: the team and Parados are very important, it’s interesting that he’s very young, we see him as the poets of the season in matches\n15:22 Comment: when he plays for Roma, which is extremely useful, it is clear that today's match may be the best indicator\n15:28 Comment: It’s probably quite difficult to play against the current Polermo, but it’s still a shame in many matches\n15:43 Comment: showed presented\n15:44 Comment: in the right light so I think now it’s pretty much like what’s left\n15:53 Comment: It’s a shame that they saved it, but didn’t keep it, for example, Walter Sobachkin’s time, the sports director of the club\n16:3 Comment: which I remind you that he left his post, the check that sits a lot for Roma did good\n16:12 Comment: then what\n16:14 Comment: subbotini in general if we speak\n16:17 Comment: today's match could be\n16:20 Comment: It’s just that the key figure who earned money in Polermo was he, for example, who brought the pastor’s Polermo\n16:32 Comment: the Argentine midfielder and many other South American talents, he has excellent connections and contacts\n16:44 Comment: children QR Butch Russians tell that the car is a model I know PPG for Ukraine\n16:45 Comment: floral\n17:14 Comment: I could continue to play for Roma and be a superstar here, but, unfortunately...\n17:23 Comment: Roma needed to sell.\n17:28 Comment: And in general, if you read how much income Sabotini brought in, money, specifically from transfers,\n17:33 Comment: then, of course, Roma is a plus in this regard.\n17:35 Comment: Exactly on transfers.\n17:36 Comment: I don’t count salaries, I don’t count other things.\n17:39 Comment: Sabotini is a great master of transfers.\n17:41 Comment: In this regard, it is not yet entirely clear who will take the position of sports director.\n17:52 Comment: As far as I understand, there are other options here.\n18:0 Comment: The name has not yet been announced.\n18:3 Comment: Again, from what I know in the Italian press.\n18:11 Comment: Nainggolan.\n18:17 Comment: Jacko's head.\n18:20 Comment: He gets the ball and hits it above the goal.\n18:27 Comment: Well, for now Frederic Massara has been appointed to the post of sporting director of Roma.\n18:34 Comment: But I think that there may still be options, because, unfortunately, Roma is a high-status club.\n18:40 Comment: And of course...\n18:41 Comment: Perhaps he is trying to lure someone away.\n18:44 Comment: Roma is one of those already experienced leaders.\n18:49 Comment: In a more important area, like the sports department.\n18:52 Comment: Always in Italy.\n18:53 Comment: Much appreciated.\n18:54 Comment: Well, many kind words addressed to Sabotini.\n18:57 Comment: Specifically from Kevin Strotman.\n19:0 Comment: Who said that Walter was a special person.\n19:4 Comment: Well, and Sabotini himself...\n19:5 Comment: Now there's another attack.\n19:7 Comment: Bad shame, Malcharalo.\n19:8 Comment: Sabotini himself can make adjustments in different teams.\n19:11 Comment: It is also called Chelsea.\n19:13 Comment: London Guaeta, Marseille.\n19:15 Comment: Where are the new owners now?\n19:16 Comment: And Dia Rudy Garcia.\n19:19 Comment: Which was brought to Roma by Walter Sabotini.\n19:22 Comment: So I think Sabotini has an interesting new project ahead.\n19:31 Comment: Well, we parted with Roma so amicably.\n19:34 Comment: As far as I understand, there were some minor disagreements.\n19:39 Comment: But they couldn’t bear it all.\n19:41 Comment: And this is all for public viewing.\n19:49 Comment: In general, Roma has an interesting history with the development of the club.\n19:52 Comment: Because with all that the team this year has picked up, in my opinion, decently.\n19:56 Comment: And Roma has a chance to achieve success in this championship.\n19:59 Comment: But success can be different.\n20:1 Comment: Please interpret my words correctly.\n20:4 Comment: Success means victory in the Italian natural championship.\n20:6 Comment: Success is, for example, second place and a direct loser in the champion league.\n20:9 Comment: Which is also important.\n20:11 Comment: And for Roma, for example, I don’t rule out such a thing either, if Roma sets such a goal for itself.\n20:16 Comment: Just like that.\n20:17 Comment: With all this, given the sporting indicators, of course, Roma has an important moment from the point of view of the club.\n20:23 Comment: Because there are debts, there are loans.\n20:27 Comment: And it’s not a fact that James Palotta is ready and how to service these same debts and loans.\n20:33 Comment: And more than once the Italian press has been carried away by the information that Palotta is doing this unofficially, always refuting this information.\n20:41 Comment: This careful gravity was worked out and it was very ecclesiastica.\n20:49 Comment: After the fight, according to simply, that's how James, he expressed this top from the designer that “odd الج organ beginnenam to visit

Diamante has a bad pass this time.\n21:28 Comment: Jacko.\n21:32 Comment: What options?\n21:33 Comment: Dzeko, no, this time he decided\n21:34 Comment: not to aggravate what he was doing, in principle,\n21:37 Comment: the entire match today.\n21:39 Comment: Today he is a good assistant.\n21:40 Comment: One Jacko.\n21:41 Comment: Well, actually, it was just a pass that hit his head.\n21:44 Comment: First.

    "summary": "In a thrilling encounter at Stadio Olimpico, AS Roma surged to a commanding 4-1 victory over Palermo, solidifying their position as contenders in the Serie A title chase. This Sunday evening clash, marking the completion of the ninth round of the Italian league, was replete with dynamic plays, strategic maneuvers, and memorable moments that emphasized Roma's determination and skill.\n\nAs the match commenced, it was palpable that Roma had come prepared to assert their dominance. The whistle from Japao Calvaresi, the referee for the match, marked the beginning of a tightly contested battle, with both teams vying for early control. Initially, the play was concentrated in the midfield, with Daniele De Rossi and others showcasing Roma's intent to dominate possession.\n\nHaving entered the game in the fourth spot on the league table with 16 points, Roma had the perfect opportunity to advance closer to the top positions. A victory would position them just behind Juventus, who led the table with 21 points, with Milan and Napoli on 19 and 17 points, respectively. Conversely, for Palermo, languishing in 18th place with a mere 6 points, the match was crucial for their survival hopes, aiming to claw out of the relegation zone.\n\nThe opening phases saw Roma calmly holding the ball. A moment worth noting was Edin Dzeko’s misdirected pass in the sixth minute that could have been capitalized by El Shaarawy. Despite some assertive runs and quick passes, no goals were scored within the first 18 minutes, although Roma frequently threatened Palermo's defense.\n\nIn the 12th minute, a corner earned by Roma brought hope but was effectively neutralized by Palermo's Alejandro González. As injuries plagued Palermo with key players like Oscar Hiljemark and Rajkovic unavailable, their struggle was evident. Regardless, Alexandru Nestorovski’s resilience provided some hope, yet, Roma's composure in defense and midfield kept them at bay.\n\nIn the 29th minute, El Shaarawy impressed with swift moves, ultimately providing Mohamed Salah a chance, which slipped past the right-hand post. A pivotal moment came in the 30th minute when Salah finally broke the deadlock. Following a coordinated play with Dzeko, Salah found the net, putting Roma 1-0 ahead. With an energizing celebration, the home crowd erupted in cheer, recognizing the Egyptian's knack for finding the goal at crucial moments.\n\nPalermo tried to counter, with Alexandru Diamanti showing flashes of brilliance. However, they couldn't convert these moments into tangible chances. Towards the half-time, Dzeko clotheslined with Emerson on the ball, continually keeping the Palermo defense on its toes. Despite several fouls and bookings, the first half concluded with Roma holding a slim 1-0 lead.\n\nThe second half resumed with Francesco Totti substituting in, an addition that always sends ripples of excitement through the crowd. Totti’s presence on the field bolstered Roma’s attack, complementing the already formidable combination of Salah, Dzeko, and El Shaarawy.\n\nA crucial mistake happened in the 48th minute, Palermo’s Croatian goalkeeper Josip Posavec fumbled what seemed a routine save from Leandro Paredes’ delivery, allowing the ball to slip past him. This unexpected error doubled Roma’s lead to 2-0, and the scoreboard reflected the uphill battle Palermo faced.\n\nPalermo did exhibit brief spells of vigor, with Diamanti taking a notable shot in the 56th minute that tested Alisson’s reflexes. Unfortunately, despite their efforts, Palermo seemed outclassed in every department. The 67th minute saw another splendid play by Dzeko, who after receiving the ball, executed a precision strike into the opponent's net, making it 3-0 for Roma.\n\nKevin Strootman replaced Nainggolan, marking a tactical substitution aimed at maintaining midfield balance. Dzeko continued to assert his influence, not only as a scorer but a playmaker, a role highly praised by manager Luciano Spalletti in his post-match comments. Dzeko’s performance was emblematic of the ‘revived’ forward that Spalletti had envisioned at the start of the season.\n\nThe 72nd-minute substitution saw Salah being replaced, rounding off an influential performance with a goal and multiple assists. The crowd, however, eagerly awaited the inclusion of Roma’s talisman Francesco Totti. The 80th minute finally saw Totti stepping onto the pitch, much to the crowd’s delight, replacing Dzeko.\n\nPalermo, clinging to faint hopes, managed to pull one goal back through Ivaylo Chochev in the 83rd minute. Chochev capitalized on a rare defensive lapse from Roma, giving Palermo a consolation. However, this did little to alter the course of the game.\n\nIn the dying moments of the match, precisely in the 87th minute, Stephan El Shaarawy sealed the victory with another deftly taken goal, emphasizing Roma’s attacking prowess. Assisted by Salah in a seamless transition play, El Shaarawy’s strike into the bottom corner past Posavec cemented the score to a resounding 4-1.\n\nThe final whistle confirmed Roma’s comprehensive victory, a testament to their growing consistency and attacking fluidity. Post-match, it was evident that Roma's prospects in Serie A looked favorable. The win propelled them to joint second with Milan, only two points adrift of leaders Juventus, reflecting a significant improvement in their campaign.\n\nPalermo, on the other hand, left the Olimpico with multiple questions to answer. Their fragility, particularly in defense and goalkeeping errors, highlighted the need for urgent rectifications should they wish to survive the relegation battle.\n\nIn summary, AS Roma’s 4-1 victory over Palermo was not only emphatic but showcased the strategic depth and versatility in their squad. Performances from key players like Dzeko, Salah, and El Shaarawy, coupled with tactical astuteness from Spalletti, provided a footballing masterclass. For fans and analysts alike, this match was a clear indication of Roma's capability and ambitions for the season ahead."
