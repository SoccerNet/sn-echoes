Naturally, we expect Roma to try to win the ball and control it.\n0:11 Comment: Piscara, a team that plays mostly defensively and scores quite a few goals.\n0:17 Comment: But what can I say, the team generally scored only one goal in the last five matches, and did this four rounds ago.\n0:26 Comment: And Alberto Aquilani, who is missing the match today, scored. He has an injury. More precisely, not an injury, he caught a cold.\n0:35 Comment: Injuries to other football players. Piscara in particular does not. In Alexandre Bruno, Andrea Coda, Norbert Diomber, Michele Fornacier, Hugo Companer.\n0:46 Comment: I mostly call defensive players. You yourself can imagine that today I simply glued together protection from some separate scraps.\n0:56 Comment: Roma do not have Leandro Paredes, Roma do not have Florence, who has a torn cruciate ligament.\n1:10 Comment: He should probably recover in February. So, in any case, this is what they expect and hope for in Rome.\n1:20 Comment: In that part of him that is rooting for Roma.\n1:24 Comment: But otherwise, the players seem to have started.\n1:26 Comment: That's the only thing that Stefanel Charawy received Roma's score.\n1:32 Comment: Quite a significant loss. But, however, the losses are expected to be short-lived.\n1:38 Comment: As well as the loss of central defender Kostas Manalas.\n1:41 Comment: He played in the last match of the series against Atalanta.\n1:45 Comment: Well, after that, again, after the damage. And is still missing.\n1:50 Comment: It's probably all about losses.\n1:52 Comment: That's it. Attention.\n1:55 Comment: Playing.\n1:56 Comment: In the game, Roma actually wins the ball.\n1:59 Comment: Strotman looks back and knocks the ball away.\n2:3 Comment: Because someone got hurt.\n2:8 Comment: As it appears.\n2:13 Comment: Something is wrong with Jean Christophe Bayback.\n2:17 Comment: But this is just a nightmare, friends.\n2:19 Comment: Now, if he has an injury now, and if he has to leave the field,\n2:23 Comment: and leave the game altogether.\n2:26 Comment: Let's see what happened here.\n2:28 Comment: Yes, Bayback pulled a muscle.\n2:30 Comment: As it appears. Can you imagine what a misfortune it is?\n2:32 Comment: He played two minutes.\n2:34 Comment: He had not played almost the entire season before.\n2:37 Comment: He started and played two matches.\n2:39 Comment: And in one of these matches he scored.\n2:43 Comment: And now the first action is literally.\n2:46 Comment: The very first movement.\n2:48 Comment: That's all.\n2:50 Comment: He actually has three matches.\n2:52 Comment: Sveta fourth.\n2:53 Comment: And here’s the problem.\n2:55 Comment: Let me remind you that Reynold, he can't play with him.\n2:56 Comment: But he doesn't have Monai today.\n2:57 Comment: Solution by Massimo Oda.\n2:58 Comment: Well, everything is written on the face of Jeanne Christophe Bayback.\n3:3 Comment: It's just fatal bad luck.\n3:7 Comment: Let's wish Bayback good health.\n3:9 Comment: Let's hope this injury isn't so serious.\n3:14 Comment: But what a shame.\n3:16 Comment: From the very first minutes, Kevin Stroatman was there for him, even the Roma players were full of sympathy.\n3:22 Comment: Well, I don't think they're keeping an eye on Reynold that closely.\n3:24 Comment: But it's not that scary.\n3:25 Comment: It's not that scary.\n3:25 Comment: Behind the fate of Bayback's biography.\n3:28 Comment: But the fact that a player basically gets injured in the first minutes is very unpleasant for everyone.\n3:33 Comment: Especially Stroatman, who has missed so much recently due to injuries.\n3:37 Comment: And it was he who kicked the ball.\n3:42 Comment: And somehow the tempo in this game even lost.\n3:45 Comment: The players seemed a little confused by what happened.\n3:49 Comment: Stroatman passes to Rudiger.\n3:52 Comment: Rüdiger transfers to the left flank.\n3:54 Comment: Left flank.\n3:55 Comment: Emerson here.\n3:56 Comment: I also missed due to injuries.\n3:59 Comment: And a replacement.\n4:1 Comment: A replacement is now being prepared as part of Piscara.\n4:5 Comment: Emerson.\n4:8 Comment: There are ten guests so far.\n4:10 Comment: Bruno Perez.\n4:16 Comment: Salah.\n4:18 Comment: Forward transmission.\n4:21 Comment: In the calculation found for Jack.\n4:22 Comment: Jack hasn't had a problem for a long time.\n4:23 Comment: In the Italian Championship.\n4:25 Comment: But in the Europa League match.\n4:26 Comment: The last one.\n4:27 Comment: Against Victoria.\n4:28 Comment: Made a hit trick.\n4:29 Comment: To Ingalan.\n4:30 Comment: With the rights of a captain.\n4:31 Comment: Today.\n4:32 Comment: Of course, he comes to express himself.\n4:33 Comment: But also the hundredth match.\n4:34 Comment: I repeat.\n4:35 Comment: And here is the first replacement.\n4:36 Comment: Gian-Christophe Beibeck.\n4:37 Comment: Leaves the field.\n4:38 Comment: And Gian Luca Caprari appears.\n4:39 Comment: Beibek is very upset.\n4:40 Comment: But Caprari here greets with such half-naked, half-applause.\n4:41 Comment: And so.\n4:53 Comment: Answered during the finals match.\n4:55 Comment: Together with Tour\n5:14 Comment: from place.\n5:15 Comment: Perversion.\n5:16 Comment: Along the fence.\n5:17 Comment: votes.\n5:18 Comment: Stand.\n5:19 Comment: Power dzเ razors.\n5:21 Comment: Then.\n5:22 Comment: Titled.\n5:23 Comment: A match from Bolonia, also at home.\n5:25 Comment: This was on the tour before last.\n5:28 Comment: True, the first goal there was rather scored into an own goal.\n5:30 Comment: But they counted three goals for Mohamed Salah.\n5:35 Comment: Pushed the ball.\n5:37 Comment: And the defender did it.\n5:41 Comment: Well, here is Alban Bidzar’s reaction.\n5:47 Comment: Rudger is the first to reach the ball.\n5:51 Comment: Emerson.\n5:53 Comment: Emerson again.\n5:59 Comment: But the ball is released too far.\n6:1 Comment: And now Caprari joins in the attacks.\n6:4 Comment: Now he was already playing the ball in the center with Lydyan Mimushai.\n6:8 Comment: Interception.\n6:9 Comment: Salah on speed.\n6:11 Comment: Pass to Dzeko.\n6:13 Comment: And Dzeko became close to Biraghi here.\n6:16 Comment: Here is the three central defenders.\n6:18 Comment: This is all obvious now.\n6:19 Comment: Biraghi is, in principle, a football player from Brovka.\n6:21 Comment: But there is no good...\n6:23 Comment: In a good life, he is transferred to the center of defense.\n6:25 Comment: And in general there is no good life there, there are three central defenders.\n6:28 Comment: This is how we played against Juventus in the last round.\n6:31 Comment: The ball was lost.\n6:32 Comment: Polistas Piscara.\n6:33 Comment: But they acted precisely in the three central ones.\n6:36 Comment: Canopy.\n6:37 Comment: And a blow.\n6:38 Comment: And a goal.\n6:39 Comment: The account is open.\n6:40 Comment: And this is Edin Dzeko.\n6:43 Comment: They missed him.\n6:45 Comment: They allowed me to serve it.\n6:46 Comment: Allowed to accept.\n6:49 Comment: And hit it accurately.\n6:50 Comment: Edin Dzeko knows his stuff.\n6:52 Comment: He has this one.\n6:53 Comment: He shook.\n6:53 Comment: Now he is in clear first place in the scorers race.\n6:59 Comment: Serie A.\n7:1 Comment: Belotti is pursuing him.\n7:2 Comment: Let's look again.\n7:4 Comment: Innings.\n7:5 Comment: Well, there are three central ones.\n7:8 Comment: Four.\n7:9 Comment: Five defenders.\n7:10 Comment: Doesn't matter.\n7:11 Comment: If this is how Biraghi fights.\n7:13 Comment: He just played great.\n7:15 Comment: Well, we see how it acts after a few seconds.\n7:19 Comment: Lets go of Dzeko.\n7:20 Comment: And Dzeko opens the account.\n7:22 Comment: Well, pretty good.\n7:23 Comment: And here, of course, Belotti has a bench.\n7:25 Comment: Roma and Francesco Totti.\n7:27 Comment: And Eldorosi in particular.\n7:29 Comment: So here's Belotti.\n7:31 Comment: Andrea Belotti.\n7:33 Comment: I caught up with Dzeko in the last round.\n7:35 Comment: Let me remind you that Dzeko hasn’t scored in Serie A for a long time.\n7:37 Comment: Belotti is a Torino player.\n7:39 Comment: But yesterday Belotti failed to score.\n7:41 Comment: Although Torino won.\n7:43 Comment: Another player scored two goals there.\n7:45 Comment: Yagu Falke.\n7:47 Comment: Well, Dzeko took his chance.\n7:49 Comment: Eleven goals scored.\n7:51 Comment: And this one.\n7:52 Comment: And this.\n7:53 Comment: And he feels great this season at Roma.\n7:57 Comment: Rüdiger.\n8:1 Comment: It was very important for Roma to score the first goal as early as possible.\n8:4 Comment: I remember the recent match with Empoli.\n8:6 Comment: The balance of forces is also obvious.\n8:9 Comment: But they couldn’t score for a long time.\n8:10 Comment: And they never scored.\n8:11 Comment: We played 0-0.\n8:12 Comment: And there was a fear that this could theoretically happen in this match as well.\n8:16 Comment: But it didn't happen anymore.\n8:18 Comment: Already scored.\n8:19 Comment: This means that Piscara now has nothing to defend.\n8:22 Comment: Piscara needs to somehow restructure himself, thinking about attacks.\n8:26 Comment: This means that Roma has more freedom to maneuver.\n8:30 Comment: Which could turn out to be murder for Piscara.\n8:38 Comment: Forward delivery.\n8:39 Comment: And immediately interception.\n8:40 Comment: So far, of course, Piscara is acting very unsuccessfully.\n8:43 Comment: Zampano gives it back.\n8:45 Comment: Number eleven.\n8:47 Comment: Circle of the right edge.\n8:48 Comment: This is where it was potentially dangerous.\n8:51 Comment: And also Gaston Brugman.\n8:54 Comment: The ball was intercepted in the center.\n8:57 Comment: As for Caprari, who came on as a substitute, he played in the match against Juventus from the first minutes.\n9:3 Comment: And he played the entire match.\n9:5 Comment: And his partner, by the way, in attack was Petinari.\n9:7 Comment: Another Roma student.\n9:9 Comment: Maybe today it will appear during the meetings.\n9:12 Comment: Bruno Perez on the lawn.\n9:14 Comment: Rough.\n9:16 Comment: They played him rough.\n9:21 Comment: And so, as you can see, he played.\n9:27 Comment: Emerson.\n9:29 Comment: Binali immediately tries to put pressure.\n9:32 Comment: But, in any case, it does not allow the ball to be moved forward immediately.\n9:36 Comment: For the first two or three seconds it exerts pressure.\n9:39 Comment: Then he steps back.\n9:41 Comment: This is the second time we have seen this.\n9:43 Comment: Mohammed Salah.\n9:45 Comment: Gleboko goes down in search of the ball.\n9:47 Comment: And accelerates the attack.\n9:49 Comment: Now Emerson. He passes to Perotti.\n9:52 Comment: Perotti vs. Zampanu.\n9:54 Comment: Here Binali is already serving.\n9:56 Comment: On Jacko.\n9:58 Comment: And the score becomes 2-0.\n10:1 Comment: We got down to business right away.\n10:4 Comment: Edin Dzeko. 2-0.\n10:6 Comment: And how catastrophically Piscara’s defense is playing today.\n10:10 Comment: But everything that we managed to say even before the start of the meeting, in the first minutes,\n10:14 Comment: that this is a defense\n10:17 Comment: which was molded from the shoulders.\n10:19 Comment: And from what happened.\n10:21 Comment: Literally. But Viturinha, of course, is not a first-team player.\n10:25 Comment: And Abiragi is not a central defense player.\n10:27 Comment: But here, look, there is no offside.\n10:30 Comment: Not the slightest.\n10:31 Comment: Late. And the defender was late,\n10:33 Comment: which is central in its primary role.\n10:37 Comment: This is Darjos Zuparic.\n10:39 Comment: And he missed Edin Jack.\n10:41 Comment: Well, that is Albana Bizzari.\n10:43 Comment: He can scream here as he pleases.\n10:46 Comment: And the thing is...\n10:48 Comment: It doesn't stick at all.\n10:50 Comment: 2-0. And this is already a bid for victory.\n10:54 Comment: According to the plans, according to the situation in Piscara.\n10:57 Comment: Based on how the team is going through the season.\n10:59 Comment: And the way Roma is going.\n11:1 Comment: And how is she feeling today?\n11:2 Comment: Pirotti. To Ingalan.\n11:4 Comment: It's very easy so far everything works out.\n11:6 Comment: This is where destruction can happen.\n11:8 Comment: Of course, Roma will have a rest.\n11:11 Comment: One week until the derby.\n11:13 Comment: There is no reason to preserve by force.\n11:16 Comment: To Ingalan.\n11:18 Comment: Jack's on the show again.\n11:23 Comment: Almost free.\n11:24 Comment: Will he make it to this ball?\n11:25 Comment: Has time.\n11:26 Comment: Stops.\n11:27 Comment: It's difficult to attack here.\n11:28 Comment: But they will play.\n11:29 Comment: Pirotti.\n11:30 Comment: He scored an incredible goal against Victoria.\n11:32 Comment: Work with this technique.\n11:35 Comment: Moreover, he himself admits that he did not try to hit the goal.\n11:40 Comment: That he served.\n11:42 Comment: As a result, the ball ended up in the goal.\n11:44 Comment: Kyshimov. A wonderful goal.\n11:45 Comment: If suddenly for some reason.\n11:47 Comment: Well, Roma fans, of course, saw him.\n11:49 Comment: What if someone hasn't seen him?\n11:52 Comment: Look here please.\n11:54 Comment: Find and rate.\n11:56 Comment: To Ingalan.\n11:57 Comment: I've outdone myself.\n12:1 Comment: And breaking the rules.\n12:3 Comment: Under the liquidation of Mushai.\n12:11 Comment: Strotman. Fouls.\n12:15 Comment: Here it is on your screens.\n12:18 Comment: There are many nice words about him.\n12:20 Comment: Luciano Spoletti said at the pre-match press conference.\n12:23 Comment: He said that Kevin is our support.\n12:26 Comment: They asked him if it seemed to him that Strotman had given up a bit.\n12:33 Comment: Compared to the beginning of the season.\n12:34 Comment: What Spoletti said is that changes in shape are a natural thing.\n12:38 Comment: But in his opinion, everything is fine with Strotman.\n12:43 Comment: Strotman.\n12:46 Comment: Gerson.\n12:49 Comment: This was practically the first, almost the first time he was with the ball now.\n12:52 Comment: It was simply not possible before.\n12:54 Comment: We can see him with the ball.\n12:57 Comment: It's interesting to watch him today.\n12:59 Comment: And so they went on the attack.\n13:1 Comment: Left flank.\n13:2 Comment: Pirotti.\n13:3 Comment: Gives it to Emerson.\n13:5 Comment: Emerson back.\n13:7 Comment: Strotman.\n13:12 Comment: Of the three central midfielders, Strotman certainly sinks deeper than others.\n13:18 Comment: But it’s difficult to say anything definite about Gerson’s position.\n13:24 Comment: But it is clear that he is a central midfielder.\n13:26 Comment: Spoletti himself said that he was still a very young player.\n13:28 Comment: Who still needs to be molded into a football player.\n13:31 Comment: And that includes shaping with regard to a specific position on the field.\n13:39 Comment: For now, says Spoletti, it is not clear.\n13:41 Comment: Gerson.\n13:42 Comment: Who should he be?\n13:44 Comment: Can be a defensive midfielder.\n13:48 Comment: To those who in Italy are called reggista.\n13:52 Comment: Conductor from the depths.\n13:54 Comment: Maybe play closer to the attack.\n13:57 Comment: Spoletti will deal with this.\n13:59 Comment: He is pleased with how Gerson is progressing.\n14:1 Comment: How he works in training.\n14:3 Comment: He improved in physics.\n14:5 Comment: Pano himself.\n14:8 Comment: Frary got played.\n14:9 Comment: But they didn’t let me go forward.\n14:10 Comment: Strotman is already here.\n14:11 Comment: Ingalan came there.\n14:13 Comment: There is no violation.\n14:14 Comment: Pano himself fought to the end.\n14:16 Comment: Translation into Benali.\n14:19 Comment: So far, Simon and Pepe are absolutely invisible.\n14:21 Comment: Benali is noticeable without the ball.\n14:23 Comment: He manages to move to the defensive.\n14:26 Comment: This, by the way, does not help the defense at all.\n14:28 Comment: And he, we already talked about this in attack, constantly enters the press.\n14:33 Comment: Denotes it.\n14:35 Comment: But, nevertheless, Emerson still feels quite at ease.\n14:38 Comment: Here's Benali again.\n14:39 Comment: Caprari is here.\n14:41 Comment: They took it this time.\n14:42 Comment: Caprari receives the ball.\n14:43 Comment: Here an accurate transfer must be made.\n14:45 Comment: And Caprari makes a mistake in this pass to Simone Pepe.\n14:50 Comment: Or maybe it would be better to break through here yourself.\n14:53 Comment: Caprari did not dare.\n14:54 Comment: Mohamed Salah played one-on-one with the referee.\n14:57 Comment: Doesn't lose speed.\n14:58 Comment: To Ingalan.\n14:59 Comment: And he doesn’t have time to intercept here.\n15:1 Comment: Crescenza somehow miraculously shifts.\n15:4 Comment: Innings.\n15:5 Comment: And it comes down to the blow.\n15:7 Comment: And it doesn't even come to blows.\n15:10 Comment: But a second wave of attack is still possible.\n15:17 Comment: They allow you to calmly control the ball.\n15:19 Comment: Roma football players Piscard.\n15:20 Comment: Another serve to Edin Jack.\n15:22 Comment: And Albana Bizzari takes the ball.\n15:24 Comment: Reminds us of the seventh and tenth minutes.\n15:26 Comment: Edin Jacka.\n15:27 Comment: Two goals scored.\n15:29 Comment: And twelve already this season.\n15:31 Comment: And, on top of everything else, Edin Dzeko.\n15:35 Comment: Also assists.\n15:38 Comment: Available in two quantities.\n15:41 Comment: Pepe.\n15:42 Comment: Discount on Caprari.\n15:43 Comment: Well, something started to work out for Piscara in attack.\n15:46 Comment: It was not in vain that we celebrated Benali.\n15:48 Comment: He acted very well in one of the previous episodes.\n15:52 Comment: And now attack with the other flank.\n15:53 Comment: Crescenians.\n15:54 Comment: And a blow.\n15:55 Comment: Well, Simone Pepe is here.\n15:57 Comment: It seems to me that I could have missed the ball.\n16:0 Comment: We scolded him.\n16:2 Comment: But he became more active.\n16:3 Comment: Let's try.\n16:4 Comment: Well, he spat.\n16:7 Comment: Allowed Roma to carry out an attack.\n16:9 Comment: Go Crescenians!\n16:13 Comment: And again a good prising by Benali.\n16:15 Comment: But Jorson did not lose the ball.\n16:19 Comment: Gave it to Rüdiger.\n16:21 Comment: True, it didn’t aggravate it at all.\n16:23 Comment: And Rüdiger did not switch to the attack either.\n16:29 Comment: On the flank!\n16:31 Comment: Too much.\n16:32 Comment: Gogolny.\n16:33 Comment: Too much.\n16:34 Comment: Not only is the transmission transverse.\n16:37 Comment: But, apparently, no one should get the ball.\n16:40 Comment: There was a shaft.\n16:42 Comment: Zampan for the side.\n16:54 Comment: Sent to the lawn.\n16:58 Comment: Well, there was a violation here.\n17:0 Comment: This is clearly visible on replay.\n17:3 Comment: Schenster commands his own.\n17:13 Comment: Standard is a chance.\n17:15 Comment: Always for the team that is inferior in class.\n17:18 Comment: You can always win something with this standard.\n17:23 Comment: 38 meters.\n17:24 Comment: But it does not matter.\n17:25 Comment: The pitch will still be quite strong.\n17:28 Comment: Where it is calculated that someone can close.\n17:30 Comment: Semelyan Irati.\n17:33 Comment: Sent by players.\n17:36 Comment: Gives them some instructions.\n17:38 Comment: Gives warnings.\n17:39 Comment: Piscara's players didn't figure it out.\n17:41 Comment: Everything fell apart.\n17:42 Comment: And the presentation.\n17:44 Comment: Well, Federico Fazio is the tallest here.\n17:47 Comment: Kicks the ball for a corner.\n17:51 Comment: Memushay, Pepe.\n17:54 Comment: We thought and wondered.\n17:57 Comment: Well, as a result we earned a corner.\n18:0 Comment: Simone Pepe will serve.\n18:7 Comment: And Benali is waiting that maybe he will choose another option.\n18:10 Comment: No, Benali went for the rebound.\n18:13 Comment: Otacha.\n18:14 Comment: Air wins Strotman.\n18:15 Comment: And Benali hits.\n18:17 Comment: Hit the defenders.\n18:18 Comment: So far I really like it.\n18:19 Comment: Well, if there is someone, about someone you can say in Piskara that Dakhmat Benali really likes it,\n18:24 Comment: I really like his acting so far.\n18:27 Comment: In today's meeting.\n18:30 Comment: Caprari.\n18:33 Comment: Brugman Caprari.\n18:36 Comment: We tried to make it beautiful and subtle, but...\n18:41 Comment: Wrong mechanism.\n18:43 Comment: Set it up.\n18:49 Comment: They overestimated their own strengths.\n18:52 Comment: Gerson.\n18:54 Comment: Emerson.\n18:58 Comment: We saw statistics on losses.\n19:0 Comment: Sword.\n19:2 Comment: Roma has more, but Roma also wields a sword more.\n19:8 Comment: There is something to lose.\n19:15 Comment: Piscard’s players began to act more harshly in selection.\n19:18 Comment: And tighter.\n19:21 Comment: We managed to recover from the shock of the first 10 minutes.\n19:24 Comment: And now they are trying to create some moments.\n19:29 Comment: And the ball is still holding.\n19:30 Comment: In Roma's half of the field.\n19:34 Comment: Benali has come again.\n19:36 Comment: Here, where Emerson is.\n19:39 Comment: He didn't make the forward pass accurately.\n19:41 Comment: There's a loss here.\n19:42 Comment: And he didn’t play forward on Ingalan.\n19:44 Comment: One of Piscard's players is lying on the lawn.\n19:46 Comment: As for Ingalan, he, of course, could immediately escalate and give it forward.\n19:50 Comment: But he considered it necessary to go and take a place in the attack himself.\n19:54 Comment: And play from deep.\n19:57 Comment: Rudiger.\n19:59 Comment: Luna Perez.\n20:0 Comment: Rudiger.\n20:4 Comment: A series of short passes.\n20:6 Comment: And Rajan Ingalan hits very well.\n20:8 Comment: Good attack.\n20:10 Comment: Now I was at Roma's.\n20:12 Comment: Ingalan's shot didn't quite work out.\n20:14 Comment: But how was it organized?\n20:16 Comment: First, a small pass game.\n20:19 Comment: Then an explosive movement.\n20:21 Comment: And the attack.\n20:23 Comment: Breakthrough to Ingalan.\n20:26 Comment: Aesthetically very cool.\n20:30 Comment: Europe championship.\n20:41 Comment: Because of this, he missed the German national team.\n20:46 Comment: Been back for a long time.\n20:48 Comment: Kick from under Facio.\n20:51 Comment: It was Caprari who beat him.\n20:57 Comment: Caprari, by the way, for the third time.\n20:59 Comment: In Piscara he now belongs to Inter.\n21:1 Comment: It was bought and returned.\n21:3 Comment: So that he continues to gain experience.\n21:5 Comment: The twist kick is very tight.\n21:8 Comment: Right into Shenstny's hands.\n21:10 Comment: But Gaston Brugman intimidated.\n21:13 Comment: And Roma's response attack.\n21:14 Comment: Perotti.\n21:17 Comment: Darjo Zuparic couldn't stop him.\n21:23 Comment: He is now, we see,\n21:26 Comment: turned out to be on the right.\n21:31 Comment: But he returns to the center.\n21:33 Comment: Francesco Zampano just rose high enough there.\n21:36 Comment: The structure does not change in Piscara.\n21:40 Comment: Mutual transmissions.\n21:43 Comment: And good Ben Ali connection.\n21:45 Comment: Zampano also comes in very handy here.\n21:47 Comment: Ben Ali.\n21:48 Comment: Transfer a little backwards.\n21:49 Comment: And a great pass from Zampano.\n21:51 Comment: Bursts into the penalty area.\n21:52 Comment: And it would be great to play here.\n21:54 Comment: So, to raise.\n21:55 Comment: So that the helper can roll out Ben Ali under attack.\n21:58 Comment: And they just rolled out under the attack of Simon Peppin.\n22:0 Comment: It’s the subtleties of Piscara that are missing.\n22:4 Comment: And in some places the attacking play of this team looks very nice today.\n22:7 Comment: Here after the tenth minute.\n22:9 Comment: Note.\n22:10 Comment: There are problems in defense.\n22:12 Comment: They're not going anywhere.\n22:14 Comment: And they are objective.\n22:16 Comment: But in attack, especially when this man, Ahmad Ben Ali, gets involved.\n22:20 Comment: It gets very interesting there.\n22:22 Comment: Yes, and Caprari.\n22:24 Comment: We have already appreciated Jean Christophe Beebeck.\n22:27 Comment: But Caprari, who appeared on the field.\n22:30 Comment: He is very agile.\n22:32 Comment: And he participates in the attack, of course, wisely.\n22:38 Comment: It moves great.\n22:40 Comment: Now the game has been rebuilt.\n22:42 Comment: After all, there are two strikers ahead, purely structurally.\n22:47 Comment: And below them there is only Ben Ali.\n22:49 Comment: Neingalan.\n22:51 Comment: Neingalan tried, I don’t know what to do now.\n22:53 Comment: Punch or pass.\n22:55 Comment: But he apparently earned a corner.\n22:58 Comment: For your team.\n23:9 Comment: It is not entirely clear who exactly the ball hit here.\n23:15 Comment: He is also on the defense in which Penalty was located.\n23:19 Comment: Piroti.\n23:21 Comment: Fasio.\n23:23 Comment: Salah.\n23:25 Comment: Bruno Perez plays well.\n23:28 Comment: The attack continues.\n23:30 Comment: Serves.\n23:31 Comment: Brungman picks the ball.\n23:33 Comment: Gerson is on the selection list.\n23:35 Comment: Gerson.\n23:36 Comment: Piroti.\n23:37 Comment: You're at risk.\n23:39 Comment: And it hits, hitting Crescenci.\n23:41 Comment: Ben Ali.\n23:42 Comment: Against Gerson.\n23:49 Comment: And Simone Pepe can’t go any further.\n23:52 Comment: Rebuilding.\n23:54 Comment: Roma Masimoda was on your screens.\n23:57 Comment: I told you that he took part in the Roman derbies.\n24:2 Comment: In general, he played against Roma for different teams.\n24:8 Comment: 17 times.\n24:11 Comment: And he shot down 3 times.\n24:14 Comment: Moreover, once just in that very derby, which ended 3-0.\n24:19 Comment: This was 10 years ago.\n24:21 Comment: And by the way, then Roma was also coached by Luciano Spalletti.\n24:31 Comment: Now Sodo is already dating as his fellow coach.\n24:36 Comment: Jacko.\n24:38 Comment: Piroti.\n24:40 Comment: Emerson runs away.\n24:42 Comment: Piroti noticed this.\n24:43 Comment: Emerson serves.\n24:45 Comment: Kills Bizari.\n24:46 Comment: Who's on the pick here?\n24:47 Comment: And here is Stropman.\n24:49 Comment: Bruno Perez.\n24:50 Comment: With great strength.\n24:51 Comment: Roma goes on the attack.\n24:53 Comment: Strotman.\n24:58 Comment: Lemusha meets him.\n25:3 Comment: Emerson.\n25:8 Comment: Piroti.\n25:10 Comment: Turns around.\n25:11 Comment: Zampana will leave through the transfer.\n25:13 Comment: Gerson.\n25:15 Comment: For now, it seems to me that he is nervous.\n25:18 Comment: He has a lot of mistakes.\n25:23 Comment: And, by the way, Luciano Spalletti is now turning to him.\n25:28 Comment: And gives him some instructions.\n25:30 Comment: And now something else for Rajan Ingalan.\n25:37 Comment: Spalletti screams.\n25:40 Comment: Piroti.\n25:43 Comment: Gerson.\n25:45 Comment: Caprari presses well.\n25:52 Comment: As a result, look, this is where Brugman gets involved.\n25:55 Comment: And the ball returns to Voishchikh Shenzny.\n26:2 Comment: Now, if it weren’t for two missed goals.\n26:4 Comment: Now Piscaro would look very decent.\n26:7 Comment: But, of course, we can’t forget about the missed goals.\n26:11 Comment: Viturinha passes forward.\n26:13 Comment: Memoshai.\n26:14 Comment: Caprari.\n26:16 Comment: Yuli Antonov and Rüdiger are immediately opposite him here.\n26:21 Comment: Rüdiger plays above all praise.\n26:24 Comment: Calmly.\n26:26 Comment: It's sorted out in class.\n26:29 Comment: Spalletti has often been shown to us, and will be shown to us.\n26:36 Comment: But here they are tugging at the Piroti's T-shirt.\n26:39 Comment: At Piscaro's.\n26:41 Comment: Killed.\n26:43 Comment: Piscaro has just one win this season.\n26:46 Comment: And this is a victory that the team achieved not entirely on its own.\n26:53 Comment: And in general, it must be said that Susuolo lost that match.\n26:57 Comment: This was in the second round.\n26:58 Comment: But then it turned out that Susuolo did not have the right to field Antonin Ragusa for this game,\n27:4 Comment: undeclared according to all the rules of Serie A, and Susuolo was counted as a technical defeat.\n27:9 Comment: This is the only victory Piscaro has.\n27:11 Comment: And besides this there are four more draws.\n27:14 Comment: In general, only one is on the road.\n27:16 Comment: That's all.\n27:17 Comment: The team is in third place from the bottom.\n27:19 Comment: While Mohamed Salah shoots from under the defender.\n27:21 Comment: Rajah!\n27:22 Comment: And Bidzari helps out.\n27:25 Comment: Raja was cunningly beaten.\n27:29 Comment: He wants to distinguish himself today, to celebrate his hundredth match.\n27:35 Comment: Salah, of course, didn’t get the shot.\n27:37 Comment: But Piskar.\n27:38 Comment: Here it is.\n27:39 Comment: Salah, of course, didn’t get the shot.\n27:41 Comment: But Nengalan hit very dangerously.\n27:43 Comment: And another corner.\n27:45 Comment: Ivan Bidzari tries, although he is also not perfect.\n27:49 Comment: Do you remember how you knocked the ball out during one of the crosses?\n27:52 Comment: 3-2 already on corners.\n27:54 Comment: Just like that.\n27:56 Comment: We haven't played for half an hour yet.\n28:2 Comment: Jack.\n28:4 Comment: Serves the penalty and kick.\n28:7 Comment: This time.\n28:8 Comment: There will be no criminal charges.\n28:9 Comment: That the whistle blew.\n28:10 Comment: Antonio Rudiger overdid it a bit.\n28:14 Comment: Semelyan Iratti has already this season, here we see Rudiger’s foul, this season he already worked in Piscara’s match.\n28:26 Comment: It was a scandalous match.\n28:27 Comment: Match in Genoa against Genoa.\n28:29 Comment: It ended 1-1.\n28:31 Comment: There Iratti showed as many as 9 cards.\n28:34 Comment: And two are red.\n28:35 Comment: And both footballers from Genoa.\n28:36 Comment: After that.\n28:37 Comment: The President of Genoa said that Piscara is the only way to win.\n28:42 Comment: Well, you can say it.\n28:44 Comment: Until Piscara denied his words.\n28:49 Comment: Because she hasn't won since then.\n28:55 Comment: Well, today it will also be extremely difficult for her to do this.\n28:58 Comment: 0-2.\n29:2 Comment: The team has lost its last five matches.\n29:7 Comment: But the truth is that nothing seems to be said or written about Masimov’s coaching fate.\n29:13 Comment: There seems to be trust.\n29:16 Comment: Everyone understands so many injuries very well.\n29:19 Comment: Well, in general, Piscara is a team that initially had to fight for survival.\n29:26 Comment: A draw with Napoleon in the first round means nothing.\n29:29 Comment: Krishentsi.\n29:31 Comment: Memushai.\n29:33 Comment: He was aiming.\n29:35 Comment: I measured the transmission.\n29:36 Comment: As a result, he messed up and lost the ball.\n29:39 Comment: Well, in general, a whole set of errors.\n29:44 Comment: He also grabbed Rüdiger here in a way you wouldn’t want anyone to be grabbed.\n29:55 Comment: Gerson.\n30:2 Comment: Perotti.\n30:6 Comment: Gerson went back.\n30:14 Comment: Well, I guess the comments with Poletti were about his position.\n30:19 Comment: During the attack, he should still be closer to the center of the field.\n30:26 Comment: And if you need to connect.\n30:28 Comment: The first yellow card in this meeting.\n30:33 Comment: Receives it by Christian Hermann.\n30:35 Comment: Christian Biraghi.\n30:42 Comment: This is Christian Biraghi's third mustard plaster.\n30:47 Comment: There is no one in Piscara's squad who would be threatened with disqualification due to a yellow card.\n30:56 Comment: That is, no one has four mustard plasters yet.\n30:59 Comment: No.\n31:0 Comment: Some players have already served their suspensions.\n31:5 Comment: Especially Bruno.\n31:8 Comment: As for Roma, only Joan Jesus has four yellows.\n31:14 Comment: But Joan Jesus is in reserve today.\n31:16 Comment: And it’s not at all a fact that he will appear on the field.\n31:19 Comment: Bruno Perez.\n31:22 Comment: Serves and...\n31:25 Comment: And on a budget.\n31:26 Comment: Bruno Perez is not very noticeable in attacking actions.\n31:29 Comment: Yes, it connects.\n31:31 Comment: But he...\n31:32 Comment: The kind of footballer who...\n31:34 Comment: Very good when playing reactively.\n31:37 Comment: When the opponent attacks a lot.\n31:39 Comment: Bruno Perez takes advantage of the freedom behind the opposing players.\n31:44 Comment: And breaks through the flank.\n31:46 Comment: Dribbles well.\n31:48 Comment: Today he simply has nowhere to run.\n31:50 Comment: Because Piscara.\n31:53 Comment: He plays the second number.\n31:54 Comment: Another yellow card.\n31:56 Comment: Antonio Rilf receives it.\n31:59 Comment: Take it away, Gigorchishnik, Yuri.\n32:3 Comment: Yellow cards were exchanged.\n32:15 Comment: Well, it's better to burn it down.\n32:16 Comment: Well, it looks as if the team is playing the ball, and not leading 2-0.\n32:20 Comment: Quite comfortable.\n32:22 Comment: The ball was a little closer than the last time Piscara took the free kick.\n32:28 Comment: The ball, as I understand it, is all the same.\n32:33 Comment: Simone Pepe and, apparently, Mimushai.\n32:36 Comment: Well, on the bench, if you don’t take Spalletti, then Roma is in a great mood.\n32:45 Comment: Well, Simone Pepe may serve better now than last time.\n32:49 Comment: Or maybe he won’t do it at all.\n32:51 Comment: Well, left or right.\n32:54 Comment: Pepe!\n32:57 Comment: Last time, of course, you remember, we were late with the delivery.\n33:2 Comment: The wall there had already crumbled.\n33:3 Comment: This time it seemed to be better.\n33:5 Comment: But they miss the attack.\n33:6 Comment: Or don't they let you through?\n33:7 Comment: No.\n33:8 Comment: Mimushai had already returned and grabbed the ball.\n33:11 Comment: Goes forward.\n33:14 Comment: Aprari.\n33:19 Comment: Gerson.\n33:26 Comment: Emerson.\n33:29 Comment: Pirotti.\n33:30 Comment: They immediately put their hands to work.\n33:32 Comment: From Zampana.\n33:33 Comment: He doesn't keep up with Piruti at all.\n33:35 Comment: On the attack.\n33:37 Comment: Ingalan.\n33:38 Comment: Forward.\n33:39 Comment: Salah.\n33:40 Comment: Didn't give it to Bruno Perez.\n33:43 Comment: Gerson.\n33:45 Comment: So what, he drops it here?\n33:46 Comment: No.\n33:47 Comment: It drops, just the opposite, for the Piscara player.\n33:51 Comment: Gerson fumbled with the ball.\n33:58 Comment: Let's see again.\n34:2 Comment: There was a small push in the back from Aprari.\n34:6 Comment: But it’s unlikely that he could shoot it down.\n34:9 Comment: Bruno Perez.\n34:19 Comment: Dissatisfied with the Mimushai legends.\n34:23 Comment: Because the referees decided that he had lost the ball.\n34:28 Comment: Shenzni.\n34:32 Comment: Emerson.\n34:33 Comment: Benali.\n34:34 Comment: This time with a violation of the rules.\n34:36 Comment: As soon as Emerson moves forward a little with the ball,\n34:39 Comment: Benali appears immediately next to him.\n34:42 Comment: And we have Benali...\n34:44 Comment: This is a player from the Nivia national team.\n34:47 Comment: Although with a Sombrian passport.\n34:52 Comment: It could very well...\n34:53 Comment: Team Nivia.\n34:54 Comment: But that's not true.\n34:55 Comment: This is wrong.\n35:3 Comment: As if he could not have chosen a different football fate.\n35:4 Comment: He was captain of the Manchester City youth team.\n35:12 Comment: And in Piscara, since last season, he helped the team reach...\n35:17 Comment: Return to service.\n35:22 Comment: Brugman.\n35:27 Comment: I noticed movement, but it was too late.\n35:29 Comment: And Caprari went offside.\n35:30 Comment: I went off-site, but it didn’t work out.\n35:34 Comment: Piscara has won twice in its history against Roma in Serie A.\n35:40 Comment: And what’s most interesting is that both victories happened here, at the Olympic stage.\n35:46 Comment: Piscara has never beaten Roma at home.\n35:51 Comment: And they won twice in the 92-93 season 1-0 and 3-1 in the 88-89 season.\n35:58 Comment: Then Tita, a Brazilian who was quite famous in those days, made a hit trick.\n36:5 Comment: And then Giampiero Gasperini, the current coach of Atalanta, played for Piscara.\n36:13 Comment: By the way, Piscare plays Atalanta in the middle of next week in the Italian Cup.\n36:17 Comment: Roma does not take part in the Cup yet.\n36:21 Comment: Waits, gives such privileges.\n36:28 Comment: Pirotti.\n36:29 Comment: Will be accused.\n36:31 Comment: Will serve.\n36:34 Comment: On Najek's account.\n36:35 Comment: Grun Perez hasn't had a rebound here yet.\n36:41 Comment: Gasperini played in the 80s, and in the early 90s Massimiliano Allegri played for Piscara.\n36:47 Comment: Who is currently coaching Juventus Turin?\n36:53 Comment: Well, Roma won the last time, just imagine.\n36:58 Comment: In season 88.\n36:58 Comment: In the 87-88 season.\n37:0 Comment: However, they were defeated 5-1.\n37:3 Comment: Then Piscara to the Olympic stage.\n37:9 Comment: Then Gasperini also played for Piscara.\n37:14 Comment: Well, for Roma.\n37:16 Comment: Guy footballers Giannini and Zbigniew Bonik.\n37:22 Comment: And goalkeeper Frank Tancredi.\n37:25 Comment: The kick turned and it seemed like a good one.\n37:28 Comment: Because, in my opinion, there was a rebound.\n37:31 Comment: And there should be a corner.\n37:32 Comment: But it seems like no, they don’t prescribe it.\n37:34 Comment: Wojcisz Chance goes after the ball.\n37:36 Comment: But I remembered Frank Tancredi.\n37:39 Comment: It was a remarkable match.\n37:40 Comment: Here is the same 5-1.\n37:41 Comment: Then the stands of the Olympic Stadium.\n37:43 Comment: They personally supported Tancredi.\n37:46 Comment: Roma goalkeeper.\n37:47 Comment: Well, already a legendary goalkeeper, one might say.\n37:50 Comment: It’s easy for him in the previous meeting at San Siro.\n37:56 Comment: The Milanese fans hit him with a guitar.\n37:58 Comment: And he received some kind of minor burn.\n38:2 Comment: He drained it from the field.\n38:4 Comment: And after that he recovered.\n38:6 Comment: And I played with Piscara in that memorable match.\n38:8 Comment: Neingalan.\n38:9 Comment: Receives a yellow card.\n38:11 Comment: We already have more yellow cards than goals scored.\n38:16 Comment: And Roma has two of them.\n38:21 Comment: He played a bit harshly.\n38:24 Comment: I would even say it's a bit rude.\n38:28 Comment: Well, to finish this historical excursion.\n38:33 Comment: I must say that the last time we met was in the 2013 season.\n38:37 Comment: When Piscara was and was relegated from Serie A.\n38:40 Comment: Well, then in Rome we played 1-1.\n38:47 Comment: And Destro and Caprari scored, by the way.\n38:51 Comment: And in Piscara, Roma won with a score of 1-0.\n38:55 Comment: And Mateo Destro also scored.\n38:57 Comment: But Destro is already...\n38:58 Comment: Not in Roma.\n39:1 Comment: Destro is currently playing for Bologna.\n39:4 Comment: Here they repeat Edin Jack's first goal.\n39:6 Comment: And now they will repeat the second one.\n39:9 Comment: Pirotti.\n39:10 Comment: External feed.\n39:11 Comment: And the Bosnian striker calmly finishes.\n39:17 Comment: Play for just over five minutes.\n39:20 Comment: In the first half.\n39:24 Comment: Zampano.\n39:27 Comment: Benali.\n39:28 Comment: Guys.\n39:28 Comment: Benali will still take the ball.\n39:30 Comment: But it will be very difficult for him, because there is no support from his partners.\n39:33 Comment: I started dribbling.\n39:34 Comment: Zampano.\n39:36 Comment: Benali.\n39:38 Comment: Zampano.\n39:40 Comment: And here is the mistake.\n39:41 Comment: And here on Ingalan.\n39:43 Comment: Shoots on the flank.\n39:45 Comment: Tourigny managed to return.\n39:47 Comment: And Brugman is good.\n39:52 Comment: Brugman.\n39:53 Comment: He did all the work as it should.\n39:58 Comment: And now Davido Vitturini is on the sideline.\n40:5 Comment: He is also a 19-year-old student.\n40:9 Comment: Piscars.\n40:11 Comment: Davido Vitturini.\n40:14 Comment: Well, due to the fact that many players are not there, he plays mostly in the squad.\n40:21 Comment: The second match is mainly played with the squad.\n40:25 Comment: Breaking the rules.\n40:27 Comment: Emerson fails.\n40:28 Comment: Manages to linger.\n40:33 Comment: Piscari is on the attack now.\n40:35 Comment: And they will serve from the flank.\n40:40 Comment: Piscara gets his chances.\n40:42 Comment: The third standard is already being earned on this flank.\n40:46 Comment: Now it’s quite literal.\n40:49 Comment: They will serve practically from the corner mark.\n40:53 Comment: And this is Simone Pippi.\n40:54 Comment: It is important to score against Piscari.\n40:56 Comment: At least score.\n40:56 Comment: If before the break, then, of course, it will be completely.\n40:58 Comment: Great for her.\n41:1 Comment: Benali in the penalty area.\n41:3 Comment: I wonder if he can compete for the top ball with his height.\n41:6 Comment: Let's see.\n41:7 Comment: Pippi serves.\n41:8 Comment: And here there is no one to compete with Fazio.\n41:10 Comment: He is the tallest football player.\n41:12 Comment: Peppy, Benali.\n41:14 Comment: Was there a violation?\n41:16 Comment: Yes it was.\n41:23 Comment: What is Benali demanding?\n41:26 Comment: Benali!\n41:57 Comment: kept season.\n41:58 Comment: We will notice the next serve of Simone Peppi,\n41:58 Comment: We'll celebrate another pitch from Davon O'Nana,\n41:58 Comment: He became a pitcher in Piscara.\n42:4 Comment: His new role.\n42:5 Comment: Simone Pepe.\n42:7 Comment: And now there will be a corner.\n42:10 Comment: And again Simone Pepe.\n42:13 Comment: Gaston Brugman fought Bruno Perez there.\n42:17 Comment: Spares are being replaced.\n42:25 Comment: Serves.\n42:26 Comment: Discount.\n42:27 Comment: There's no one at the far post.\n42:28 Comment: And only now, only now does Caprari come.\n42:32 Comment: And Crishenza's twist kick.\n42:35 Comment: There's no one here from the Roma trains.\n42:36 Comment: But Mohammed Salah rushes to Ben Ali.\n42:39 Comment: First on the ball.\n42:42 Comment: Zampano.\n42:44 Comment: Forced to give back.\n42:52 Comment: Gerson played well.\n42:55 Comment: AND.\n42:57 Comment: Falat on James.\n42:58 Comment: Zheka.\n43:1 Comment: Two minutes.\n43:3 Comment: I think they will add a minute.\n43:4 Comment: Because Jean Christophe Boybeck had an injury.\n43:7 Comment: And the game stopped at the very opening.\n43:22 Comment: Gerson.\n43:26 Comment: Good pass from Rudiger.\n43:28 Comment: Aggravating.\n43:28 Comment: And now the pasty Salah did not catch on the ball.\n43:33 Comment: Strotman is good.\n43:34 Comment: No breaking the rules.\n43:36 Comment: Mimushae was taken away.\n43:37 Comment: 64 to 36 in possession.\n43:41 Comment: Ben Ali is still good.\n43:43 Comment: This is, of course, a football player.\n43:46 Comment: May the many fans of Piscara not be offended by me.\n43:51 Comment: But this is a player who, in my opinion, should play in a higher-class team.\n43:57 Comment: Still because he...\n43:58 Comment: Demonstrates.\n44:0 Comment: And maybe he will play.\n44:1 Comment: But the school is felt.\n44:2 Comment: Serving by Bruno Perez.\n44:5 Comment: Everson.\n44:8 Comment: Pirotti.\n44:11 Comment: Yacht.\n44:12 Comment: Defender Pirotti.\n44:13 Comment: Serves.\n44:14 Comment: And a blow.\n44:15 Comment: And we have already seen this combination.\n44:17 Comment: And Piscara’s players don’t learn from their own mistakes.\n44:21 Comment: But now, however, there was a cross and Edin headed it to Jack.\n44:26 Comment: And in the previous case he...\n44:28 Comment: He kicked and scored.\n44:31 Comment: But the defender still backs away.\n44:33 Comment: Doesn't take away.\n44:34 Comment: What is he waiting for?\n44:35 Comment: But Pirotti will find an opportunity to serve.\n44:38 Comment: And he finds it.\n44:40 Comment: And he didn’t count two.\n44:41 Comment: Three zeros.\n44:44 Comment: The stands will sing.\n44:51 Comment: Several of them were corporals.\n44:53 Comment: Well, we still counted two scoring chances.\n44:58 Comment: And Piskar.\n44:59 Comment: AND...\n\nSecond Half:\n0:30 Comment: With\n0:44 Comment: for hours.\n1:0 Comment: There were violations of the rules. In the first half, Irati showed the teams yellow cards three times.\n1:11 Comment: In general, Irati is refereeing the fifth match in the series this season.\n1:20 Comment: Last season, when he worked at Roma matches, but Piscard was not in the series,\n1:25 Comment: He refereed four games and only one had fewer than six goals scored.\n1:31 Comment: Imagine, the scores were 3-3, 3-3, 5-1, and then once they beat Fiorentina at home 4-1.\n1:38 Comment: To be honest, considering the weight of the opponent, the result is more than worthy.\n1:43 Comment: So, Irati has interesting statistics related to Roma.\n1:51 Comment: Well, as for Piscara, there are no special stories here.\n1:56 Comment: The only thing was that there was once a Coppa Italia match, where Piscara lost to Spezia 0-3.\n2:3 Comment: Well, that also happened last season and there Zuparić was sent off by Semyan Irati.\n2:12 Comment: Yes, and, of course, when Irati started only in Serie A in 2012-2013,\n2:17 Comment: he was allowed to officiate several matches in his team in Serie A,\n2:24 Comment: He worked more in Serie B and for two of Piscara’s matches his work came.\n2:29 Comment: But the results there were unsuccessful for Piscara, a draw and a defeat.\n2:40 Comment: Pirotti shoots across the flank.\n2:44 Comment: That’s when Župarić, whom Irati kept sending off the field all the time, knocks him out.\n2:49 Comment: And on the lawn, Pirotti holds on to the sore spot and shows Irati that doctors should appear in the field.\n3:2 Comment: I landed unsuccessfully on my elbow and could have been injured.\n3:15 Comment: Verre.\n3:18 Comment: Facio was pushing forward.\n3:21 Comment: Gerson.\n3:23 Comment: Antonio Rüdeger sends back.\n3:25 Comment: Very good fight in the first half.\n3:27 Comment: Everything that depended on him, he performed above all praise.\n3:31 Comment: Bruno Perez.\n3:33 Comment: Stratman.\n3:35 Comment: Gerson.\n3:37 Comment: Otherwise back.\n3:39 Comment: Fasio is far away.\n3:41 Comment: Roma's central defenders rise high.\n3:45 Comment: Stratman.\n3:47 Comment: Bruno Perez.\n3:51 Comment: Irati.\n3:53 Comment: Bruno Perez.\n3:57 Comment: The Caprari are against him.\n4:0 Comment: It works. It will be very interesting now to see how the structure of Piskar’s game will change in attack.\n4:6 Comment: If the team is even allowed to go on the attack while Roma controls the ball.\n4:10 Comment: And by the way, Diego Pirotti returned to the game.\n4:16 Comment: A large number of gears.\n4:18 Comment: Rüdeger. He's wrong.\n4:21 Comment: But all this is not for long, because he himself corrects the mistake.\n4:24 Comment: Takes it technically on the chest.\n4:27 Comment: And Salab strives forward. Crescenze holds him.\n4:30 Comment: It does, but that, of course, was...\n4:32 Comment: It seemed to me that it was a violation of the rules.\n4:34 Comment: But the referee considered that both players fought there and made the same efforts.\n4:39 Comment: In all senses.\n4:41 Comment: That’s why I didn’t stop the game.\n4:43 Comment: Well, here's a blow to the face.\n4:47 Comment: Gerson receives.\n4:48 Comment: There should be a card, in theory.\n4:50 Comment: But if the whistle...\n4:56 Comment: Well, or here Gerson will be awarded a fall.\n5:6 Comment: Here Crescenza struggled.\n5:10 Comment: Well, you know, here...\n5:12 Comment: Be it my will. Minnow, by the way, they gave the ball back.\n5:14 Comment: Gerson flew, got it.\n5:16 Comment: But first, Pepets himself fouled.\n5:18 Comment: I would, of course, whistle there.\n5:20 Comment: Because Crescenze grabbed the T-shirt.\n5:23 Comment: There was no way for Salah to escape.\n5:25 Comment: Salah after that, yes, he also used his hand.\n5:28 Comment: But he tried to remove Crescenza’s hand first of all, so that he would finally let him go.\n5:32 Comment: Well, the judge somehow thought that it was quite a game episode.\n5:37 Comment: And he didn’t stop Mohammed Salah’s attack in any way.\n5:40 Comment: Well, let's leave it on the conscience of Mussimilian Irati.\n5:44 Comment: This is unlikely to be a decision that will affect the course of the game.\n5:50 Comment: Edin Dzhekov takes a free kick!\n5:52 Comment: And it hits the side net.\n5:55 Comment: Instantly launched an attack.\n5:57 Comment: Well, we deployed the wrong verb here.\n6:0 Comment: Because it turned out to be as vertical as possible.\n6:2 Comment: Mohamed Salah, of course, a wonderful season.\n6:4 Comment: Just a wonderful time in Roma.\n6:7 Comment: And you probably know that the second half of January,\n6:11 Comment: The African Cup will begin on the 20th.\n6:16 Comment: And the Egyptian team will take part in it.\n6:19 Comment: Well, and, accordingly, the Egyptian national team cannot be imagined without Mohamed Salah.\n6:24 Comment: So they're waiting for at least two weeks.\n6:28 Comment: Well, there are also fees, of course.\n6:30 Comment: But Mohammed Salah will be gone for three weeks.\n6:33 Comment: And they were already looking at a potential replacement in Roma.\n6:37 Comment: They were looking at the Dutch market.\n6:41 Comment: Because it will be very difficult without Salah.\n6:44 Comment: Very hard.\n6:46 Comment: This is a footballer who largely defines the face of the attack for today's Roma.\n6:51 Comment: Francesco Totti is warming up.\n6:53 Comment: I really want to see him.\n6:55 Comment: We miss him already.\n7:1 Comment: Brugman.\n7:5 Comment: Benalik didn't have time to throw his sword.\n7:7 Comment: Benalic was Pescara's best in the first half.\n7:11 Comment: Very nimble, tenacious.\n7:14 Comment: And we saw several successful actions on his part.\n7:19 Comment: Well, we praise you for what you have.\n7:21 Comment: Because, of course, Roma has an advantage.\n7:25 Comment: And she implements it.\n7:28 Comment: Jerson began to feel more confident.\n7:30 Comment: Let me remind you that Leandro Paredes is injured today.\n7:34 Comment: Remained in reserve, Gerosi is resting.\n7:37 Comment: And now Pescara is attacking.\n7:39 Comment: And Pepe didn't overact.\n7:41 Comment: He did not outplay Shenstov in close combat.\n7:44 Comment: And Pescara had, of course, the most realistic chance.\n7:49 Comment: How did this all happen?\n7:51 Comment: He was ignored in Caprara.\n7:56 Comment: The Roma players acted relaxed.\n7:59 Comment: If they don't burn without concentration, they'll get theirs, of course.\n8:2 Comment: And the low corner was played by Memushai and Perrotti.\n8:5 Comment: Kills on Zampano's rebound.\n8:8 Comment: But Roma still knocks the ball out.\n8:11 Comment: A game like this will be more interesting.\n8:14 Comment: Well, not for Roma fans, of course.\n8:16 Comment: They want to see a landslide victory for their team.\n8:19 Comment: But if we talk about a neutral fan,\n8:22 Comment: Here, of course, a goal from Simon and Pepe could add entertainment value.\n8:26 Comment: Intrigue and nerves in this game.\n8:30 Comment: But the chance didn't help.\n8:39 Comment: Good goalkeeper.\n8:44 Comment: Roma also has Alison.\n8:47 Comment: Brazilian goalking in stock.\n8:49 Comment: Warmed up for the Brazilian national team.\n8:52 Comment: And the main player.\n8:54 Comment: But Alison will play in Europa League matches.\n9:0 Comment: He played in the last two.\n9:2 Comment: In particular, with Austrian Victoria from Plesen.\n9:9 Comment: Good pass to Nayengalan.\n9:12 Comment: Nayengalana, probably in the penalty area.\n9:14 Comment: Well, here...\n9:18 Comment: The Pescara players haven't fully figured it out.\n9:21 Comment: Discount on Bidzari.\n9:23 Comment: Bidzari didn't quite make it.\n9:30 Comment: And there will be Pirotti's corner.\n9:35 Comment: Another corner.\n9:37 Comment: Pescara was ahead of Roma to this point.\n9:44 Comment: And now Roma are level on five corners.\n9:53 Comment: No, not the corner one.\n9:55 Comment: It was apparently a handball.\n9:57 Comment: So it will remain so in the corners.\n9:59 Comment: And Pirotti will take the free kick.\n10:8 Comment: Well, what can Pirotti compose?\n10:11 Comment: We saw this in the match with Victoria.\n10:13 Comment: Now he just needs to deliver accurately.\n10:16 Comment: Dzeko is there, and Rüdiger follows.\n10:18 Comment: Serve!\n10:19 Comment: Everything is played by Bizzari.\n10:21 Comment: Salah.\n10:24 Comment: The ball was thrown.\n10:26 Comment: Salah.\n10:27 Comment: Air wins Roma.\n10:30 Comment: Jacko.\n10:31 Comment: Benali doesn't get to the ball.\n10:33 Comment: There's no one ahead.\n10:35 Comment: Facio controls everything there.\n10:37 Comment: And there’s still some left behind, Emerson is insuring.\n10:41 Comment: Everything is clear for Roma here.\n10:45 Comment: You can't figure it out alone.\n10:49 Comment: Bruno Perez.\n10:52 Comment: Breaking the rules.\n10:58 Comment: Krishentsev is always on the edge.\n11:0 Comment: Fola sometimes plays beyond the bounds.\n11:4 Comment: But his task is difficult.\n11:5 Comment: He and Salah have to hold on, and Bruno Perez also gets involved sometimes.\n11:11 Comment: Stratman.\n11:13 Comment: Right ahead.\n11:22 Comment: Frosty weather, I'd say, well, by Italian standards.\n11:25 Comment: In Rome there is steam at the mouth.\n11:29 Comment: And even on the field, I don’t know if you noticed, there’s something like frost.\n11:34 Comment: But covered.\n11:35 Comment: There's some kind of freezing frost here.\n11:39 Comment: Well, winter is coming.\n11:43 Comment: Rüdeger.\n11:48 Comment: Salah.\n11:49 Comment: He's going back.\n11:51 Comment: Stratman.\n11:52 Comment: Salah.\n11:53 Comment: The aggravation immediately plays Dzeko.\n11:56 Comment: His defender squeezes him in the fight.\n11:59 Comment: This is Župarić.\n12:0 Comment: Zampano.\n12:2 Comment: It's a good pass.\n12:4 Comment: Mimushai ended up here.\n12:5 Comment: And it will be possible to transfer it to the second tempo.\n12:7 Comment: Succeeds.\n12:8 Comment: Could there be a blow here?\n12:10 Comment: And Chanson helps out his team once again.\n12:14 Comment: Well, this is Piscaro’s second scoring chance in the second half.\n12:18 Comment: The first one was absolutely obvious.\n12:21 Comment: But even here the blow was quite dangerous.\n12:23 Comment: Well, Roma misses these attacks.\n12:25 Comment: As for Roma itself, we didn’t see such acute moments in the second half.\n12:30 Comment: Well, here we see that they are still grabbing each other's T-shirts.\n12:36 Comment: And here is the reaction of Woichch and Shenson.\n12:41 Comment: Rüdeger.\n12:45 Comment: Bruno Perez.\n12:50 Comment: And just like that, in the first half.\n12:51 Comment: Perez.\n12:56 Comment: Salah lost sight of the ball.\n12:59 Comment: 5-5.\n13:1 Comment: We counted by shots on target.\n13:2 Comment: The gate is still 4-3 on shots wide.\n13:6 Comment: In general, Roma have an advantage, but Piscaro is catching up.\n13:11 Comment: The score, however, is 2-0 so far.\n13:13 Comment: Good transfer to Ingalan.\n13:15 Comment: I was trying to either serve here, or try to hit it somehow cunningly.\n13:20 Comment: Difficult to understand.\n13:22 Comment: Prary takes the ball.\n13:24 Comment: Strothman, Salah and...\n13:26 Comment: Offside.\n13:27 Comment: Mohamed Salah scores, but the referee's flag was raised earlier.\n13:34 Comment: Here we go again.\n13:37 Comment: Yes.\n13:39 Comment: Mohamed Salah's body was already offside.\n13:45 Comment: It is difficult to assess exactly what episode Spoliti reacted to in this way.\n13:50 Comment: But it's unlikely for this canceled Salah goal.\n13:54 Comment: Everything was obvious.\n13:55 Comment: More likely that they missed Piscaro's attack.\n13:58 Comment: 2-1 on...\n14:1 Comment: Offside.\n14:3 Comment: Salah is waiting to connect to Ingalan.\n14:7 Comment: The game went to Ingalan, but practically without a center.\n14:15 Comment: Memushai.\n14:18 Comment: Tepe.\n14:20 Comment: Zampano.\n14:24 Comment: Memushai.\n14:32 Comment: Benali.\n14:36 Comment: Piscaro plays the pass and Zampano plays well.\n14:40 Comment: Gives it back, from here you can take a shot and a goal.\n14:44 Comment: Goal 2-1.\n14:45 Comment: Piscaro wins one back.\n14:47 Comment: And this is absolutely deserved, friends.\n14:50 Comment: In the second half, the guests looked great in attack.\n14:57 Comment: Memushai didn't score.\n15:1 Comment: Once again.\n15:4 Comment: Zampano came and connected great.\n15:7 Comment: Yes, here, well, we can say that Simon and Pepe were offside.\n15:13 Comment: But these are the episodes that are always controversial.\n15:15 Comment: Was the offside passive?\n15:17 Comment: Pepe himself did not participate in the attack, well, in general.\n15:20 Comment: On the other hand, he distracted the attention of the goals and the defenders.\n15:23 Comment: So here the referee saw that there was no active offside.\n15:30 Comment: Igor counted it 2-1.\n15:32 Comment: Piscaro hasn't scored in 4 rounds in a row.\n15:35 Comment: The last one to stand out was Alberto Aquilani, a former Roma footballer.\n15:41 Comment: Didn't come here today.\n15:42 Comment: Daniel Oderos, I think he will replace Gerson.\n15:47 Comment: Experienced football player.\n15:52 Comment: Must appear on the field.\n15:59 Comment: Well, apparently, I did.\n16:2 Comment: Remember that Gerson does not hold a position.\n16:6 Comment: It was from there that the dangerous moments began to come.\n16:10 Comment: Minushai scored from there.\n16:13 Comment: Violation of the rules against Simone Peppi.\n16:17 Comment: Unexpectedly, the match, which was completely dictated by Roma, became problematic for her.\n16:23 Comment: A puddle accidentally forces you to take some actions in flight to rebuild the game.\n16:30 Comment: Ben Ali.\n16:32 Comment: Everson drops it.\n16:34 Comment: Everson will now receive a yellow card.\n16:36 Comment: Roma players began to break the rules more often.\n16:39 Comment: It's only about 30 seconds now.\n16:41 Comment: There were two violations against Pippi and Ben Ali.\n16:45 Comment: Here comes Emerson.\n16:47 Comment: There was a violation.\n16:49 Comment: Ben Ali is technical and very difficult to handle.\n16:53 Comment: Well, Derosin's instructions.\n16:55 Comment: I think he understands everything himself.\n16:58 Comment: Minushai scored the first goal.\n17:0 Comment: By the way, he didn’t take a penalty this season in a match with another Olympic team, Slazio.\n17:5 Comment: Right here at the Olympic Stadium.\n17:8 Comment: Get into the penalty area.\n17:10 Comment: Well, the package was unsuccessful.\n17:16 Comment: And Simone Pippi is forced to return.\n17:19 Comment: By the way, today was also my first appearance in the main lineup during this season.\n17:25 Comment: Violent collision.\n17:29 Comment: Apologizes to Perotti.\n17:30 Comment: Pippi says he played ball on Irata.\n17:33 Comment: Another opinion, if anything, is on Krivertsa.\n17:36 Comment: Well, who will Daniel Derosy appear in instead of?\n17:42 Comment: I doubt it's Derosi's place instead of anyone other than the Priest.\n17:49 Comment: Napole.\n17:50 Comment: By the way, he can also play central defender.\n17:52 Comment: There is no need for this now.\n17:54 Comment: Problematic position.\n17:55 Comment: Obviously.\n17:57 Comment: Perotti.\n17:59 Comment: Jack.\n18:2 Comment: Salah.\n18:4 Comment: Stops.\n18:6 Comment: Prary.\n18:8 Comment: Here a free kick helps defend.\n18:10 Comment: Bungalan.\n18:12 Comment: There is no violation of the rules.\n18:14 Comment: And Raja himself beats.\n18:16 Comment: And the ball almost slipped under my arm.\n18:18 Comment: Killed by Zarri.\n18:20 Comment: Missed the corner.\n18:22 Comment: Past the gate.\n18:23 Comment: And a replacement.\n18:25 Comment: Now to thunderous applause.\n18:27 Comment: Of course, they repeat this episode again.\n18:29 Comment: It seemed in the dynamics that Beizarri didn't really reach under the arm here.\n18:35 Comment: Well, it's heavy here.\n18:37 Comment: No.\n18:39 Comment: Instead of Raja with Ingalan.\n18:41 Comment: Imagine.\n18:43 Comment: And passes the captain's armband to Ingalan.\n18:47 Comment: A player who can't give him a turn.\n18:48 Comment: Imagine.\n18:50 Comment: And passes the captain's armband to Ingalan.\n18:53 Comment: The player who played his hundredth match for Roma today.\n18:56 Comment: Gives way to a football player who is playing his 400th game today.\n19:2 Comment: My 400th game for my team.\n19:6 Comment: Like Totti, he doesn't seem to be going anywhere.\n19:11 Comment: Spends his entire career in Rome.\n19:14 Comment: Jersey remains.\n19:16 Comment: Still.\n19:18 Comment: Well, I think that Spoletti is also acting psychologically here,\n19:23 Comment: So let the guy play to the end.\n19:26 Comment: Now I think he'll just play higher.\n19:29 Comment: And so he goes on the attack.\n19:32 Comment: He clearly gravitates towards attacking actions.\n19:34 Comment: Because of this, Spoletti criticized him in the first half.\n19:37 Comment: But he waved his hand.\n19:40 Comment: And now he can't give it a turn.\n19:43 Comment: And left Jersey at Nayingavan's position.\n19:49 Comment: We'll see how he does.\n19:54 Comment: Brugman.\n19:57 Comment: Benali.\n20:0 Comment: Mushai.\n20:2 Comment: Dawn.\n20:4 Comment: Benali subtly played on Simone Peppe.\n20:8 Comment: And Edin Dzeko commits violation of the rules.\n20:12 Comment: Roma is nervous.\n20:14 Comment: Edin Dzeko is very nervous.\n20:20 Comment: And he broke the rules at Crescenza.\n20:28 Comment: The game has become unexpectedly interesting in terms of intrigue.\n20:34 Comment: It's clear that Roma is going with a better team.\n20:37 Comment: And this is the team that is fighting for the Scudetto this season.\n20:43 Comment: We need to catch up with Juventus.\n20:48 Comment: For those who don’t want to talk about the score, I won’t tell you how Juventus played today.\n20:52 Comment: Peppe serves, discount.\n20:58 Comment: The short ball is knocked out.\n21:3 Comment: Tompano, participant in the scoring attack.\n21:8 Comment: Piscaro plays very well in passing.\n21:13 Comment: Between Semers.\n21:18 Comment: Zampano.\n21:22 Comment: Vere.\n21:25 Comment: Mushai.\n21:28 Comment: Vare won't get to the ball, but it's difficult for Roma to go on the attack.\n21:34 Comment: Župarić.\n21:36 Comment: Breaks the rule.\n21:38 Comment: Let's pay attention to how high Piscaro's defenders play.\n21:43 Comment: The team is acting boldly and has absolutely nothing to lose.\n21:46 Comment: She felt that Roma could score.\n21:52 Comment: It’s strange that Župarić hasn’t received a yellow card yet today.\n21:56 Comment: He's getting it now.\n22:0 Comment: Justified. 3-2 on yellow cards.\n22:2 Comment: 2-1.\n22:4 Comment: What is the score in the match.\n22:7 Comment: Besides, Roma's performance is different.\n22:10 Comment: Perez.\n22:11 Comment: Derosi.\n22:17 Comment: Gonoli

stands.\n23:13 Comment: Stratman.\n23:16 Comment: Country house.\n23:19 Comment: The ball doesn't reach the jack.\n23:22 Comment: The defenders of Pescara stopped letting him go.\n23:25 Comment: Calm down.\n23:26 Comment: Russia.\n23:28 Comment: Perotina slipped.\n23:30 Comment: Goes further into the penalty area.\n23:32 Comment: And what's here?\n23:34 Comment: Let him demand a penalty.\n23:36 Comment: And it looks like the arbitrator is appointing him.\n23:42 Comment: At the same time, he consulted with the referee, who works behind the baseline.\n23:49 Comment: But it is none other than the Pescara players who are arguing now.\n23:54 Comment: Let's get a look.\n23:56 Comment: There was a violation of the rules here.\n23:58 Comment: It's a clean 11-meter kick.\n24:0 Comment: Not into any ball.\n24:2 Comment: Klishents did not play here at all.\n24:4 Comment: Klishents finished his game.\n24:6 Comment: Already failed once today.\n24:8 Comment: He didn't reach the ball.\n24:10 Comment: He himself thinks differently.\n24:12 Comment: And a penalty will be awarded.\n24:15 Comment: And then Dominic Celli helped.\n24:17 Comment: He's behind the right gate and working.\n24:20 Comment: The judge, by the way, is Serya.\n24:26 Comment: And here's a successful stretch of Pescara.\n24:28 Comment: And it ends with an 11-meter rum.\n24:33 Comment: The stands are noisy, is it really his decision?\n24:36 Comment: The arbitrator no, he didn't cancel it.\n24:38 Comment: And Pirotti.\n24:40 Comment: He has already scored from the penalty spot several times this season.\n24:44 Comment: He scored three goals on his debut.\n24:46 Comment: Then they defeated us from the penalty spot.\n24:56 Comment: Dineso scored twice in the first round.\n24:59 Comment: Then he scored.\n25:1 Comment: And now is the chance again.\n25:3 Comment: Pirotti hits.\n25:5 Comment: And the goal is 3-1.\n25:7 Comment: Roma regains the two-goal gap.\n25:10 Comment: Diego Pirotti.\n25:14 Comment: It's his fifth goal of the season.\n25:21 Comment: I crossed myself on my feather.\n25:23 Comment: And not by chance, but because\n25:24 Comment: He beat the goalkeeper very well.\n25:27 Comment: Because it really became alarming.\n25:29 Comment: Pescara carried out the attack successfully.\n25:31 Comment: I scored a goal and could have scored a second one.\n25:33 Comment: And before that there were two dangerous moments.\n25:40 Comment: They chant the name of the person who scored the goal.\n25:43 Comment: The stands, well, manage to send all the tattoos.\n25:46 Comment: Well, now the King of Rome will appear.\n25:51 Comment: Francesco Totti.\n25:54 Comment: Instead of whom, I wonder?\n25:56 Comment: Instead of someone from the attack group, probably.\n25:59 Comment: Maybe instead of the same Pirotti.\n26:1 Comment: Let the game be rebuilt.\n26:3 Comment: Maybe instead of Jack.\n26:5 Comment: And the game will go on without a pure center forward.\n26:10 Comment: Pig and falls.\n26:12 Comment: Breaking the rules of the whole party.\n26:14 Comment: Valerio Verre.\n26:17 Comment: Well, we couldn't do without Totti today.\n26:19 Comment: The stands are singing, and he comes out instead of Jersey.\n26:25 Comment: He will be an attacking midfielder now.\n26:29 Comment: 19 year old.\n26:31 Comment: And he gives way to a 40-year-old.\n26:34 Comment: But I don’t want to call Totti a veteran.\n26:38 Comment: Because at heart he is forever young.\n26:41 Comment: And he talks about it himself.\n26:43 Comment: He told me a lot of interesting things in the interview,\n26:45 Comment: Which is officially published on the website of the Club of Rome.\n26:49 Comment: He said, why am I going to retire?\n26:52 Comment: if I'm fine.\n26:57 Comment: Uena Perez.\n26:59 Comment:

thinks about the future.\n27:35 Comment: Will he become a coach?\n27:37 Comment: He said I'm too good a guy to be a coach.\n27:40 Comment: Well, let's see.\n27:42 Comment: He listed those whom he identified for the role of coach,\n27:48 Comment: back when they were playing.\n27:50 Comment: Canavaro and Materazi and Monteu, who are now coaching.\n27:56 Comment: That's what they could be.\n27:58 Comment: Filippo Inzaghi.\n28:0 Comment: I somehow doubt it,\" said Totti.\n28:4 Comment: He talked about how he trains and takes care of himself more than ever.\n28:8 Comment: Well, 40 years.\n28:10

It's getting counted.\n28:26 Comment: This is Caprari.\n28:28 Comment: He's celebrating very low-key now.\n28:30 Comment: And the few Pescara fans in the stands are celebrating.\n28:32 Comment: Great match.\n28:34 Comment: Who would have thought.\n28:36 Comment: Unfortunate discount.\n28:38 Comment: And it was Cemerson who made a mistake.\n28:39 Comment: And Caprari.\n28:41 Comment: Pupil of Roma.\n28:43 Comment: The former scores the goal for his team.\n28:45 Comment: And he does this for the second time in his career.\n28:47 Comment: Looks like a young player.\n28:49 Comment: And the second time for Pescara.\n28:51 Comment: This is how fate works out.\n28:53 Comment: Next season we might see him inside.\n28:55 Comment: Caprari is playing well today.\n28:57 Comment: And there is still time.\n28:59 Comment: Gruna Perez.\n29:1 Comment: Transfer to second tempo.\n29:3 Comment: On Salatas.\n29:5 Comment: Location.\n29:7 Comment: We must go back.\n29:9 Comment: Because Pescara's attack has already begun.\n29:11 Comment: Caprari.\n29:13 Comment: But Caprari now he could not stand up to the authority of Daniel Derose.\n29:18 Comment: And you can’t explain it any other way.\n29:23 Comment: Stratman.\n29:25 Comment: Emerson.\n29:30 Comment: Roma's attack is developing at a low tempo.\n29:36 Comment: Pirotti.\n29:39 Comment: And he leaves in a panic.\n29:41 Comment: Serves.\n29:44 Comment: And can we continue the game?\n29:46 Comment: Well, of course not.\n29:48 Comment: There should have been a criminal.\n29:50 Comment: But I really like Pescara's attitude to business.\n29:53 Comment: Even if they lose today.\n29:55 Comment: I think that after such a meeting.\n29:57 Comment: Considering the personnel problems.\n29:59 Comment: Well, no complaints.\n30:1 Comment: Maybe leaving.\n30:3 Comment: Well, there may be specific private actions in defense.\n30:5 Comment: But by self-delivery.\n30:6 Comment: Nothing to show.\n30:8 Comment: Feed.\n30:10 Comment: Bruno Perez.\n30:13 Comment: Gently throws.\n30:15 Comment: Facio folds.\n30:19 Comment: And the corner one.\n30:21 Comment: The ball goes away from Biraghi.\n30:23 Comment: And the corner should have

subsequent matches.\n31:10 Comment: Totti.\n31:12 Comment: Demonstrates the technique.\n31:14 Comment: But I think he let the ball go.\n31:16 Comment: And here.\n31:18 Comment: By the way, the rebound

    "summary": "AS Roma 3 - 2 Pescara\n\nIn a thrilling encounter at the Olympic Stadium, AS Roma emerged victorious with a 3-2 win over Pescara in a clash that saw fluctuating fortunes and non-stop action right from the outset.\n\nThe match started with anticipation, as both teams prepared to vie for control. With notable absences such as Leandro Paredes and Alessandro Florenzi due to injuries, Roma knew they'd have to make strategic adjustments. Their opponents, Pescara, were without key players like Alberto Aquilani due to illness and several defensive members out injured, compelling them to piece together a makeshift defense.\n\nEarly moments in the game saw Roma taking the initiative, with Kevin Strotman directing play and making an early impact despite some unfortunate fouls and stoppages. Pescara’s Jean-Christophe Bahebeck, who unfortunately pulled a muscle, had to be substituted just minutes into the game, visibly disappointed as he left the field.\n\nRoma capitalized on the disarray in Pescara's defense early on. By the seventh minute, Edin Dzeko opened the score, showcasing his clinical finishing prowess after a well-placed cross from Bruno Peres. Just a few minutes later, Dzeko extended Roma’s lead to 2-0, expertly finding the net again. At this point, it seemed as though Pescara was in for a long night, struggling to contain Roma's offensive onslaught.\n\nDespite their initial setback, Pescara attempted to rally, with their players like Ahmad Benali and Gianluca Caprari displaying commendable attempts to push forward and disrupt Roma’s play. Pescara managed sporadic pushes into Roma’s half, but their attacks were often thwarted by a composed Roma defense led by the sturdy Rüdiger and the watchful Szczesny in goal.\n\nThe first half ended with Roma's dominance on display, their midfield orchestrated effectively by Nainggolan and Gerson holding firm to keep Pescara at bay. Nevertheless, the visitors exhibited glimpses of potential with Brugman and Zampano attempting to lead the charge from their half but often fell short in finishing off their moves.\n\nAs the second half started, the atmosphere remained charged with possibilities. Pescara came out determined, and it wasn’t long before their efforts bore fruit. Ahmad Benali, who was a noticeable presence all game, linked well with Zampano and Memushai to create opportunities. By the 60th minute, their perseverance paid off as Memushai’s focused play compensated for Pepe's previous miss, reducing the deficit to 2-1.\n\nThis goal sparked a visible resurgence in Pescara’s demeanor, and they became increasingly aggressive and purposeful in their play. Roma, who had looked comfortable, started showing signs of nervousness, with their previously steady defense now appearing vulnerable to Pescara’s revived attacks.\n\nLuciano Spalletti, Roma’s manager, readjusted his approach. Gerson, who showed flashes of brilliance but also signs of inexperience, was substituted mid-half for the more experienced Daniel De Rossi, who came on to stabilize the midfield and offer his veteran leadership.\n\nThis substitution proved timely. Just as Pescara seemed to be gaining momentum and potentially looking for an equalizer, Roma got a crucial breakthrough. Diego Perotti, executing a calm and precise penalty, restored Roma’s two-goal cushion to 3-1 after a clear foul by Crescenzi on Perotti in the box.\n\nHowever, Pescara was not ready to concede defeat. They kept pushing forward. As the game progressed towards its final stages, Gianluca Caprari, Pescara's lively forward, showed his mettle. Capitalizing on an error, he brought the score back to 3-2 with a well-timed effort, injecting fresh drama and tension into the match.\n\nThe closing minutes were a testament to both teams’ resolve. Roma, now scrambling to maintain their precarious lead, brought on Thomas Vermaelen for a more defensive approach. Despite this, Pescara did not relent, embodying a relentless spirit that had them pressing and probing Roma’s defense till the very end.\n\nThe match concluded with a dramatic scene as Nainggolan, making way for De Rossi, and emerging hero Francesco Totti coming off the bench, providing seasoned experience to stave off the persistent Pescara attacks. The final whistle blew with Roma narrowly holding on for a 3-2 win.\n\nIn summary, the game at the Olympic Stadium was a pulsating spectacle of goals, grit, and relentless pursuits. Roma, despite their early commanding lead and momentary lapses, managed to secure three points through strategic play and veteran experience. Pescara, while ultimately falling short, exhibited commendable resilience and spirit, promising tough contests for any future opposition."
