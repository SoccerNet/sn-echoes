Oh!\n36:34 Comment: And here on the side of the young halkeeper\n36:37 Comment: It turns out the judge, and Baka, by the way, agrees.\n36:43 Comment: Into the building.\n36:47 Comment: Joseph Bosavica played Buck.\n36:52 Comment: Bosavitz had already touched the ball and just right\n36:55 Comment: Because of this single combat, I dropped it from my hands.\n37:2 Comment: Oops!\n37:6 Comment: By the way, what is Baka doing?\n37:11 Comment: He creates this Mind Protection.\n37:14 Comment: There goes his wall kiss.\n37:18 Comment: So if Chanate\n37:21 Comment: represents this sticking function\n37:24 Comment: That's why the right hand is on the pedal...\n37:27 Comment: HIT!\n37:29 Comment: Guest headquarters.

How will this turn out?\n38:51 Comment: Turn on the puller, serve. Bis-vis-talk. Wrestling is not according to the rules.\n39:4 Comment: Roland Shaline.

Milan is ahead.\n39:22 Comment: One goal was scored by Suslo in the 15th minute.\n39:27 Comment: It was the result of Milan's starting pressure in the first minutes, which Montello's team played powerfully and correctly.\n39:40 Comment: By comparing the potential and extrapolating the football that Milan showed in these first 15 minutes for the subsequent time,\n39:50 Comment: It can probably be assumed that, playing Milan's kind of football further, he could quickly score the second goal.\n39:57 Comment: Or maybe even the third.\n40:1 Comment: There was no such twist in the game.\n40:4 Comment: And now it's 1-0. A real Moscow score for Milan.\n40:19 Comment: Hiljamarc makes a mistake, robs him here and rushes forward with the ball.\n40:25 Comment: It's crazy.\n40:27 Comment: Balermo loses more goals.\n40:30 Comment: Milan, while losing balls, has more luck in rebounds.\n40:40 Comment: Good interception now.

Locotelli did not disappoint.\n43:51 Comment: Romagne Yolin.\n43:57 Comment: Fout.\n44:4 Comment: Oh, how clever!\n44:7 Comment: Bruno Henrique.\n44:9 Comment: In general, he prefers not to make a pass, but to advance towards the opponent’s goal by dribbling.\n44:22 Comment: But he can do it. He has a very high-speed dribble.\n44:28 Comment: Embala.\n44:34 Comment: I decided to confuse Palette.\n44:37 Comment: The pallet, of course, moves like a leg, and very easily finds use at any point.\n44:45 Comment: Yes, Kolik, when his team is defending, and the right flank is already insuring the left, he is located in the middle.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Resuming the match. No substitutions were made during the break.\n0:5 Comment: This means that everyone is healthy and, in principle, everything is more or less satisfactory for the coaches so far in terms of fulfilling the game’s task.\n0:18 Comment: Let's remember the lineups.\n0:20 Comment: Josip Pasavic, already mentioned several times, defends the goal in Lermo.\n0:24 Comment: He has number one. Olesya Sami is number 19 on the left in defense.\n0:31 Comment: In the center is Anzhelkovich 4th and Raikovich 5th.\n0:36 Comment: On the right flank is Syunok 15th.\n0:43 Comment: In the center of the field, the captain of the Gadsi team is number 14, Bronenrike is 25th and Hiljamar is 10th.\n0:53 Comment: And in the attack Shalay number 20, Nestorovsky 30, Embalo 11.\n1:3 Comment: Roberto de Zebri is the head coach of the field.\n1:11 Comment: Milan, Donnaruma gate number 99.\n1:16 Comment: In defense on the right is number 20 Abade, the team captain.\n1:21 Comment: In the center of the field are Paletto 29th and Romagnoli 13th.\n1:27 Comment: Dashillo is number 2 on the left flank.\n1:31 Comment: The central zone is 33rd Kutskam, 73rd Lokotelli and 80th Pashanovich.\n1:40 Comment: In attack, Suso is number 8, Baca is number 70 and Bonaventura is number 5.\n1:47 Comment: Milan head coach Vincenzo Montello.\n1:52 Comment: The main referee of the match is Paolo Matzoley.\n1:56 Comment: Here he is now with another trill.\n2:3 Comment: I wonder what pace the game will take in the second half from the very beginning.\n2:11 Comment: The first half was quite fast, such lively, dynamic football.\n2:17 Comment: Why did Milan immediately increase this pace and force the defense and goalkeepers of Palermo to make mistakes.\n2:27 Comment: Now Palermo is apparently trying to follow the same path.\n2:31 Comment: He starts to play attack. The pressure, look how unambiguous it is.\n2:36 Comment: It's asking for Suso, but not from Saba.\n2:39 Comment: I decided that it would be dangerous to continue playing this square here at my own goal.\n2:41 Comment: And throws a long pass forward.\n2:44 Comment: And Pasalic flies, flies, and the ball flew even further from him.\n2:48 Comment: Pasalic sits on the grass and looks at the judge.\n2:51 Comment: On judges from all inthesiasm.\n3:11 Comment: The fans are still noisy.\n3:14 Comment: A moment of defense. Milan is not doing well.\n3:19 Comment: Although he played so clearly now, knocking the ball out to Romagnoli.\n3:24 Comment: But Paletto took a lot of risks with his free kick.\n3:27 Comment: The Abbot of Donorum.\n3:33 Comment: Not very far ahead.\n3:36 Comment: And the ball falls back from Kutska.\n3:41 Comment: Bruno Enrique is the main macho tribler so far.\n3:50 Comment: A little chaotic football.\n3:53 Comment: Fussiness, the feeling that not all actions are thought out.\n3:59 Comment: Still, it is based on the desire to attack.\n4:3 Comment: Everyone is moving forward.\n4:5 Comment: And Milana flies whenever possible.\n4:7 Comment: And Palermo also goes, goes, goes.\n4:10 Comment: Look into Donoruma's eyes.\n4:13 Comment: Is there any fear there?\n4:16 Comment: Here, in my opinion, everything was fine at the moment the ball was hit.\n4:20 Comment: The players looked around, determining whether they were offside or not.\n4:25 Comment: But Ilya Nestorovsky, like many other players,\n4:30 Comment: doesn't look very good.\n4:33 Comment: And now, like I said, everything is fine.\n4:41 Comment: And so, like I said, it's fine.\n4:43 Comment: But Ilya Nestorovsky was definitely not closest to the gate.\n4:52 Comment: Monaventura.\n4:54 Comment: It seems that everything is already done, but here Yoneka was offended.\n4:57 Comment: But he didn't have the ball under control.\n5:0 Comment: And there is no violation here.\n5:7 Comment: Raikovich.\n5:11 Comment: The Balkan link is here.\n5:14 Comment: In the center, the central triangle is defensive.\n5:17 Comment: Croatian goalkeeper.\n5:19 Comment: By Soviet Slovenian defenders Anjelkovic and Serbian defender Rajkovic.\n5:25 Comment: This is the center.\n5:27 Comment: Barons.\n5:30 Comment: The young

not happy with the inventory.\n6:14 Comment: He thinks he was stopped.\n6:16 Comment: Illegal reception.\n6:19 Comment: Here you go, the ball.\n6:21 Comment: And one more trick.\n6:23 Comment: Also

Comment: at the very beginning of the game already...\n11:29 Comment: I think he received some orders...\n11:32 Comment: about the fact that he should get ready.\n11:34 Comment: It happened in the first half.\n11:36 Comment: And now Embalo is leaving...\n11:38 Comment: and Simone Lofaso.\n11:42 Comment: Appears in this game.\n11:45 Comment: Well... in this way...\n11:47 Comment: Two

Lofaso, appeared on the field.\n14:24 Comment: And they must, apparently, refresh the attack.\n14:40 Comment: Romagnoli. Continue ahead.\n14:45 Comment: The transfer is messed up. Some kind of fight is being imposed in the center.\n14:55 Comment: And Nestorovsky wins it.\n14:57 Comment: Something might work out for Diamanti on the right flank.\n15:0 Comment: Now he's invading the penalty area.\n15:2 Comment: The result was an involuntary transmission.\n15:4 Comment: And the third player in a row in the penalty area.\n15:7 Comment: During this combination, he has the opportunity to touch the ball and make a point.\n15:13 Comment: But no one got a good hit.\n15:16 Comment: It's such a great moment in Palermo right now.\n15:22 Comment: Lofaso.\n15:26 Comment: Yes, Alisami.\n15:31 Comment: Lost the ball, but is tormented by Inezu Abate.\n15:36 Comment: Prevents him from launching an attack.\n15:40 Comment: Back Anzhelkovich wins back.\n15:43 Comment: Losavec.\n15:49 Comment: In such a slightly incredible reminder, this title has now appeared, which shows that Milan seems to have scored in this game.\n15:59 Comment:  That was a long time ago.\n16:1 Comment: It doesn't seem true.\n16:3 Comment: It's been 45 game minutes with that couple.\n16:7 Comment: And Milan no longer came close to making claims, taking over the initiatives.\n16:24 Comment: Rajkovic, Anjelkovich, Bruno Henrique.\n16:36 Comment: Both to the left and to the flank.\n16:39 Comment: Lofaso.\n16:44 Comment: What an easy combination. Lofaso's penalty area wall shoots through.\n16:48 Comment: The goal is empty, the ball is rolling past it.\n16:51 Comment: The goal is empty and the ball rolls past.\n16:56 Comment: Donna Ruma couldn't do anything there.\n17:0 Comment: But here, of course, he miscalculated the jump a little.\n17:3 Comment: He jumped, but the previous attack was most interesting.\n17:5 Comment: Diamantium penetrates. It doesn't work.\n17:7 Comment: The heel is played by Hilja Mark.\n17:9 Comment: Nestorovsky flies past the cash register, and also Bruno Enrique.\n17:12 Comment: Although Nestorovsky spreads his arms there, indicating that he was pushed.\n17:16 Comment: And he dives. After this, he dives, not in a bad way, but simply because of this movement.\n17:21 Comment: Bruno Henrique.\n17:23 Comment: During one attack there were two, in my opinion, the most unfounded suspicions of a penalty.\n17:31 Comment: But there is no penalty.\n17:33 Comment: Replacement in Milan.\n17:35 Comment: Mati Fernandez.\n17:37 Comment: Today I could have started in the starting lineup for the first time, but it didn’t happen.\n17:43 Comment: Changes according to mischief.\n17:50 Comment: Number 14.\n18:2 Comment: Senok will still play to the card.\n18:5 Comment: Here she already is.\n18:10 Comment: He tested the judge's patience.\n18:14 Comment: And the judge punished him in the third tough fight.\n18:19 Comment: Here, of course, he just chopped.\n18:22 Comment: On the legs.\n18:26 Comment: And according to the noment.\n18:29 Comment: And according to the noment it is prepared for serving.\n18:41 Comment: Diamanti.\n18:45 Comment: Now he speaks with the help of Sokosovitsa's hands.\n18:49 Comment: Well, here the defense is zone-based.\n18:53 Comment: At Palermo.\n18:55 Comment: What a blow.\n18:57 Comment: Cunning.\n19:2 Comment: Pure deceit.\n19:5 Comment: Romagnoli strikes.\n19:10 Comment:  Ball.\n19:14 Comment: Here is a Milan player leaving the field.\n19:27 Comment: On two sides.\n19:30 Comment: Fixed.\n19:33 Comment: Well, the violation really has to be whistled.\n19:38 Comment: Referee Paulo Macelli is not always.\n19:41 Comment: Although there are few truly egregious cases.\n19:48 Comment: And he is a small fall who...\n19:50 Comment: You see why he’s like this?\n19:52 Comment: Unacceptable situation for Palermo players.\n19:55 Comment: However, as for the Milan players.\n19:57 Comment: So that someone suddenly gets the ball.\n19:59 Comment: And had the opportunity to look around.\n20:1 Comment: And run with your head up.\n20:3 Comment: Select transmission address.\n20:5 Comment: This will immediately cover your dreams.\n20:7 Comment: That's the setup.\n20:11 Comment: And here, of course, that's all.\n20:19 Comment: That's the setup.\n20:23 Comment:  Without it...\n20:27 Comment: You can't take the ball for yourself and you can't build anything.\n20:30 Comment: Here is Heljamark.\n20:32 Comment: One of the most pressing people right now.\n20:37 Comment: Swedish midfielder.\n20:41 Comment: He just ran to cover Milan's defense.\n20:45 Comment: Now he has rebuilt and moved to the center of the field.\n20:56 Comment: Also a fairly young football player.\n20:59 Comment: He's 24 years old.\n21:8 Comment: Champion of

great football players, original players,\n22:27 Comment: You'll still have to see what happens to you.\n22:31 Comment: And it probably won't be like that.\n22:34 Comment: And it won't be the way we thought.\n22:37 Comment: Still, we'll have to wait for these masters\n22:46 Comment: They will mature in this composition.\n22:50 Comment: If they happen to play together, of course\n22:53 Comment: several good seasons in a row.\n22:57 Comment: Milan today\n23:2 Comment: a fairly pragmatic team,\n23:5 Comment: who understands that yes, there are abilities\n23:10 Comment: to score and upset your opponents\n23:14 Comment: but then you have to\n23:20 Comment: Run a lot and fight with the defenders.\n23:27 Comment: But there is Juventus, which is still unattainably high in the table,\n23:33 Comment: There is Roma, which Milan is trying to get ahead of.\n23:38 Comment: And there is every chance, in principle, to win today.\n23:57 Comment: Palermo players stop.\n24:3 Comment: They're watching what's going on in their half of the field.\n24:6 Comment: Milan is up to something with the sword.\n24:10 Comment: Although there is still the possibility of counting on a counterattack.\n24:17 Comment: And the attack is fast and sharp.\n24:21 Comment: Roman Yulin back.\n24:27 Comment: Donna Ruma.\n24:38 Comment: Paletto.\n24:42 Comment: And the Abbot.\n24:46 Comment: Milan has a very smart line of defenders.\n24:52 Comment: Today they play very carefully, without inventing anything,\n24:58 Comment: without bringing anything extra to your gate.\n25:2 Comment: And at the same time they defend themselves without even some grace.\n25:6 Comment: Paletto, for example, because it works,\n25:11 Comment:  sample.\n25:15 Comment: He's going to the selection.\n25:25

failed.\n25:34 Comment: Diamanti pulls his team into a counterattack.\n25:39 Comment: Colo, Faso, Diamanti.\n25:41 Comment: That's how authority works.\n25:43 Comment: Diamanti simply forced his

fallen onto the lawn.\n26:12 Comment: Well, here we see passive offside.\n26:15 Comment: It is Haitham Ali Samion who is not in the episode.\n26:19 Comment: And Nestorovsky enters the penalty area at the right moment.\n26:28 Comment: Well, you've been playing around, Milan, what should you do?\n26:30 Comment: Where are you going?\n26:31 Comment: I played poorly after scoring.\n26:34 Comment: And I

    "summary": "AC Milan emerged victorious in a tightly contested match against Palermo, securing a 2-1 win at the Stadio Renzo Barbera. The encounter was marked by gripping moments, tactical maneuvers, and individual brilliance that kept the fans on the edge of their seats until the final whistle.\n\nThe match began with both teams lining up in a 4-3-3 formation. For Palermo, Josip Posavets guarded the goal, while the backline consisted of Thiago Cionek, Haitam Aleesami, Sinisa Andelkovic, and Slobodan Rajkovic. In midfield, Alexander Gazzi, Oscar Hiljemark, and Bruno Henrique sought to control the tempo, while Roland Sallai, Ilija Nestorovski, and Carlos Embalo formed the attacking trident.\n\nAC Milan, under the guidance of Vincenzo Montella, had Gianluigi Donnarumma between the posts. The defensive quartet comprised Mattia De Sciglio, Alessio Romagnoli, Gabriel Paletta, and Ignazio Abate. The midfield trio included Manuel Locatelli, Juraj Kucka, and Mario Pasalic, with Suso, Carlos Bacca, and Giacomo Bonaventura constructing the attacking line.\n\nRight from the kickoff, Milan exerted pressure on the Palermo defense. The Rossoneri’s aggressive start paid dividends in the 15th minute when Suso capitalized on a mistake by the young Palermo goalkeeper Josip Posavets. The ball fell kindly to Suso, who made no mistake in slotting it into the net, giving Milan an early lead. This goal was emblematic of the early dominance displayed by Milan, as they pinned Palermo back and forced them to commit errors.\n\nPalermo, despite the early setback, did not lose heart and gradually found their footing in the game. They started pressing higher up the pitch and forcing Milan into making rushed clearances. The interplay between Bruno Henrique and Oscar Hiljemark in midfield began to show glimpses of creativity as they attempted to pry open the Milan defense. However, their efforts were effectively neutralized by the composure and organization of Milan's backline, particularly the towering presence of Romagnoli and Paletta.\n\nAs the first half wore on, Palermo's attacking intent grew more pronounced. They earned a series of corners but failed to convert them into goals, thanks in large part to Donnarumma’s towering presence and excellent shot-stopping capability. Nevertheless, Palermo’s persistence paid off in earning free kicks in dangerous positions, one of which saw Hiljemark testing Donnarumma's reflexes with a powerful strike.\n\nMilan, having taken the lead, opted for a more cautious approach as the half progressed, focusing on maintaining possession and waiting for counter-attacking opportunities. Suso continued to be a creative force, frequently troubling the Palermo defense with his incisive runs and pinpoint crosses. Despite their reduced attacking output in the latter part of the first half, Milan remained dangerous and seemed content with their one-goal advantage.\n\nThe half-time whistle blew with Milan leading 1-0, but the game remained finely poised. Palermo's resurgence hinted at the possibility of an interesting second half, particularly if they could find a way to breach Milan's defense.\n\nThe second half resumed without any substitutions, indicating that both managers were satisfied with their lineups for the time being. Palermo initially displayed greater urgency, clearly intent on leveling the score. They moved the ball with greater purpose and challenged Milan with renewed vigor.\n\nPalermo's efforts were soon rewarded in the 71st minute. After sustained pressure, a well-crafted move saw the ball delivered into the box where Ilija Nestorovski was waiting. Seizing the opportunity presented by a rare lapse in Milan's defense, Nestorovski adeptly controlled the ball and dispatched it past Donnarumma to bring Palermo level. The home crowd erupted in jubilation as their team finally managed to break through Milan's defenses.\n\nDetermined to regain control, Montella made a tactical switch, bringing on Mati Fernandez and Gianluca Lapadula. The changes injected fresh energy into Milan’s play. Fernandez's creativity and Lapadula's poise in front of the goal added a new dimension to Milan's attacks. The match intensified as both teams now sought the winning goal.\n\nMilan's persistence paid off in the 83rd minute. Following a series of frantic plays near the Palermo penalty area, Suso, once again at the heart of the action, delivered a decisive pass. The ball eventually found its way to Gianluca Lapadula, who had the presence of mind to use his heel to redirect the ball past a scrambling Posavets. The goal was a testament to quick thinking and agility, attributes that Lapadula brought onto the pitch immediately after his introduction.\n\nWith the lead restored, Milan shifted to a more defensive setup to preserve their advantage. Palermo, unwilling to accept defeat, continued to push forward, but their endeavors were thwarted by the steadfast defense of Milan, led admirably by Romagnoli and Paletta. Despite their vigorous attempts, Palermo could not find another breakthrough.\n\nAs the final minutes ticked away, Milan maintained composure and thwarted Palermo’s desperate attacks. Donnarumma's commanding presence provided a sense of security to the defense, as he collected crosses and made crucial saves to keep Milan in front. His performance highlighted why he is seen as one of the most promising goalkeepers in Serie A.\n\nThe final whistle brought an end to a thrilling contest with Milan emerging as 2-1 victors. The win highlighted Milan’s ability to absorb pressure and execute swift counter-attacks, a strategy that proved effective throughout the match. For Palermo, it was a case of missed opportunities and occasional defensive lapses that ultimately cost them the game.\n\nMilan’s early goal by Suso and the late winner by Lapadula showcased their attacking prowess, while Donnarumma’s solidity between the posts was instrumental in securing the win. Palermo, despite their spirited performance, were left to rue their missed chances and the defensive shortcomings that allowed Milan to clinch the crucial three points.\n\nThe match was a testament to the intensity and excitement that Serie A football offers, with both teams exhibiting moments of brilliance and resilience. For Milan, the victory provided a significant boost in their campaign, while Palermo would need to regroup and address the areas that led to their downfall. The encounter, filled with drama and quality football, left fans thoroughly entertained and set the stage for an intriguing continuation of the Serie A season."
