    "summary": "In a tightly contested match at the iconic San Siro Stadium, AC Milan managed to edge past Cagliari with a narrow 1-0 victory. The game, characterized by a relentless back-and-forth, tactical discipline, and occasional moments of brilliance, offered a feast for the eyes to dedicated football fans. Here’s a detailed account of the events that transpired during both halves of this exhilarating encounter.\n\n### First Half:\n\nThe match kicked off with Cagliari getting the first touch of the ball. Immediately setting the tempo, AC Milan appeared assertive, with the first significant moments of the game unfolding as early as the 1st minute when the ball went out of play, signaling Milan's early pressure. Just moments later, AC Milan forced a corner—it presented a promising opportunity which unfortunately culminated in a shot that did not hit the target, causing the ball to roll out of play. Cagliari, showing defensive resilience, managed a timely clearance but Milan regained possession quickly.\n\nAs the minutes ticked on, the frenzy of action continued. By the 5th minute, Milano had taken the game into Cagliari’s half repeatedly, earning another corner that, yet again, did not yield an immediate goal. Milan's pushing seemed incessant, creating shots on target, though not converting, while their opponents were forced into defensive maneuvers, including a series of clearances and throw-ins. AC Milan's dominance in possession and territorial advantage, however, did not translate to early goals.\n\nThe tone of the game hinted at an end-to-end battle when Cagliari launched threatening counterattacks occasionally. By the 12th minute mark, Cagliari captured the game's fine margins, forcing AC Milan to commit fouls and relinquish set-piece advantages. Notably, in the 13th and 14th minutes, Cagliari managed shots on target that tested Milan’s defense and the goalkeeper’s agility. Despite their valiant efforts, Cagliari could not break the deadlock.\n\nPressure continued to mount as the half progressed. In the 18th minute, AC Milan earned an indirect free-kick, capitalizing on Cagliari's foul. However, this effort, like several others, did not culminate in the desired breakthrough. A string of continuous throw-ins and indirect free-kicks characterized the subsequent minutes. Milan's dominance on ball possession was clear, yet they found it challenging to penetrate Cagliari’s defensive lines decisively.\n\nA critical moment came in the 21st minute when a clear foul by Cagliari led to an indirect free-kick for Milan. The drama of the match heightened as Milan's attackers were caught offside, repeatedly losing momentum. As the first half's tempo swirled, both teams exchanged possession through throw-ins in rapid succession, each trying to implant their pattern into the game but being met with stiff resistance.\n\nThe duel continued to remain in equilibria until roughly the 25th minute when a wave of opportunities unfolded, starting with a corner for Cagliari that was not converted and included a substitution from Milan to refresh their strategic outlook. The pattern of the first half persisted with scattered fouls and indirect free-kicks, indicating a scrappy midfield battle for control rather than clinical offensive executions.\n\nThe tension peaked again in the 29th minute as AC Milan launched an attack, forcing Cagliari to commit another foul. Milan received another indirect free-kick, reflective of the match's physical battles. By the closing stages of the first half, Milan found themselves repeatedly advancing into Cagliari’s box, creating threats but failing to break their defensive shell and convert opportunities.\n\nJust before the half-time whistle, in quick succession, AC Milan forced a few corners, each bringing the ball tantalizingly close to the goal but ending either wide or in the keeper’s safe hands. Cagliari's defense and Milan's persistent offense characterized the first half's closing moments, effectively maintaining a goalless draw into the break.\n\n### Second Half:\n\nThe second half of the game resumed energetically, with AC Milan taking the kick-off. Milan immediately set the tone with aggressive ball play, but Cagliari remained resilient at the back, clearing the ball out of danger when necessary. A few early throw-ins signaled Milan’s controlling spirit in the initial minutes. However, it wasn't long before the narrative of missed chances resurfaced—by the 3rd minute, Milan was caught offside, yet again missing an opportunity to capitalize on their possession.\n\nThe intensity did not waver, with Cagliari, too, making their presence felt through counters specifically translating into near-miss shots off target. Both teams exchanged rapid clearances, throw-ins, and indirect free-kicks in the opening quarter of the second half—all indicative of a highly tactical and physically demanding midfield battle. \n\nAround the 12th minute of the second half, AC Milan’s battery of attacks saw a renewed surge. A well-constructed move led to several shots, pressuring Cagliari's defenses to the brim. Nevertheless, their defensive fortitude prevailed with crucial clearances. By the 14th minute mark, Milan had managed a slew of shots, yet pointing towards an intrinsic struggle to convert these moments into goals—at one point, seeing their shot hit the woodwork.\n\nA moment of significant drama came around the 18th minute when multiple efforts by Milan saw them pushing aggressively into Cagliari’s box, eventually resulting in off-target shots following on-the-mark attempts. As the half advanced, substitutions from both teams signaled varying tactics, with Milan attempting to maintain pressing intensity and Cagliari looking to rejuvenate their defense and midfield stability.\n\nBy the 26th minute, the battle saw heightened physical contestation leading to set-pieces for Milan. Cagliari, resilient in their approach, committed fouls that granted Milan indirect free-kicks. Despite having several such opportunities, Milan faced an unyieldingly structured Cagliari defense. The arrival of the 29th minute brought further intense actions, as Milan continued dominating ball possession and generating several shots on target.\n\nThe game maintained its rigorous momentum into the final quarters, with a significant shift arriving only at the 42nd-minute mark. AC Milan, after persistent attacking persistence, finally broke the deadlock with a shot on target that found the back of the net. This critical moment, greeted with thunderous applause from the home crowd, tilted the scales of the match in Milan’s favor, establishing a much-desired 1-0 lead.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, the game’s physicality did not recede. Cagliari, pressing for an equalizer, endured setbacks including a yellow card and multiple fouls committed in desperation to regain possession and pressure Milan. The entry into the closing minutes was marked by strategic fouls and throw-ins, indicating a tightly-fought battle as Cagliari aspired to level the scoreline.\n\nA dramatic twist occurred almost at the very end when, in a frantic effort, Cagliari’s disciplinary issues culminated in a red card around the 48th minute. This left them a man down and effectively sealed their fate, reducing their chances to mount a last-ditch comeback against Milan’s maintained composure in defense.\n\nThe final whistle blew, confirming AC Milan’s 1-0 hard-fought victory over Cagliari. The narrative of the match centered around Milan’s dominant possession play and relentless attacks stymied by Cagliari's formidable defense that, despite heroics, was breached just once—a goal sufficient to change the game's fate.\n\nThe match was a vivid exhibition of tactical discipline, physicality, and sporadic moments of flair that ultimately saw AC Milan clutching the crucial three points while Cagliari contended with both the loss and reflection on their tough defensive effort and critical errors. It justified the anticipation, providing fans with a thrilling lens into top-tier football’s intricate dynamics and the fine lines that often separate victory from defeat."
