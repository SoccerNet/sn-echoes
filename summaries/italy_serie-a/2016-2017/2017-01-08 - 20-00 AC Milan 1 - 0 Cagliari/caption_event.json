    "summary": "In what was an overall average display, AC Milan managed to triumph over Cagliari by a narrow 1-0 margin in a match filled with numerous moments of promise but ultimately low on concrete action. The fixture took place on a fine evening, with both teams eager to convert their strategies into points on the board.\n\nFrom the first whistle, Cagliari took initiative, kicking off the game at exactly 00:00. Despite the enthusiastic start, the ball quickly found itself out of play at 01:01. AC Milan tried to capitalize soon after, earning a corner at 01:26—one of the earliest threats by the home team. However, their shots didn’t find the target and AC Milan's early attempts were thwarted by Cagliari's defense in subsequent minutes.\n\nAC Milan continued to search for a breakthrough, and they earned another corner at 05:22 and 05:51. Cagliari's defense held firm and managed to clear any immediate threats. The home side's aggressive pressing paid off as they executed multiple throw-ins and corners, showing their relentless nature while also committing fouls, including an indirect free-kick situation at 07:04.\n\nThe game witnessed its first offside at 08:03 by AC Milan, providing some breathing space to the Cagliari defense. Shortly after, a shot from Carlos Bacca (AC Milan) sailed high, not posing any real danger to Cagliari’s goal (11:16). The initial exchanges hinted at an evenly matched contest with neither side getting a firm grip on the proceedings.\n\nOne of Cagliari's key opportunities came at the 13:04 mark when they tested Gianluigi Donnarumma with a threatening shot. The game saw its tempo being disrupted frequently, with stoppages for fouls and the ball going out of play several times. Piero Giacomelli, officiating the match, had to repeatedly stop the game to signal fouls committed by both teams.\n\nMidway through the first half, Carlos Bacca's shot missed the target over the crossbar (15:30). In responding fashion, Diego Farias of Cagliari forced a save from Donnarumma only for the rebound to be effectively cleared, thus neutralizing Cagliari's effort (24:56).\n\nAC Milan replaced Ignazio Abate with Luca Antonelli due to an injury at 26:17. The first half was notably marked with AC Milan’s persistent but unfruitful efforts on goal along with several offsides and corners, showing their clear intent but lack of precision in front of goal. Cagliari managed to defend resolutely but did not pose significant offensive threats of their own.\n\nThe first half concluded with no goals but significant action. AC Milan dominated possession and passages of play but couldn't break the deadlock as both teams went into the half time goalless (47:06).\n\nWhen the second half kicked off, AC Milan looked determined to convert their superiority in play into goals. Throughout the second half, they maintained pressure on Cagliari's defense. The early period saw several throw-ins and corners in favor of AC Milan, though they were unable to penetrate a tightly-knit Cagliari defense.\n\nMario Pasalic on the edge of the penalty area sent several attempts wide, missing the chance to get on the scoresheet. At the other end, Cagliari too tried to take advantage of any counter-attacks. Despite some promising positions, they lacked composure in the final third.\n\nOne pivotal moment in the half was a beautifully weighted cross by Mario Pasalic that was intercepted right before any serious damage (08:18). Milan’s continued advanced play finally started showing signs of urgency as more players committed to pressing the opposition high up the field.\n\nA significant break for Milan came at 14:12 when Giacomo Bonaventura's header missed narrowly over the bar, missing a perfect chance to score. Throw-ins and corners became vital for AC Milan as they tried to break the resolute defense of Cagliari.\n\nCagliari had their hope diminished with a series of offsides and unsuccessful shots. Mauricio Isla thought he found a breakthrough but his goal was ruled out for offside, much to the disbelief of Cagliari's supporters.\n\nKey substitutions mid-way through the half by both teams, with Cagliari bringing on Marco Borriello (27:30) and Joao Pedro (32:20), aimed at altering their fortunes and providing fresh legs upfront. AC Milan's tactical changes with Andrea Bertolacci (18:50) and Gianluca Lapadula (33:55) highlighted their persistence in seeking that elusive goal.\n\nThe ultimate game-changing moment arrived at the 42:13 mark of the second half when Gianluca Lapadula showed great vision and composure, assisting Carlos Bacca who fired the ball into the bottom left corner, finally putting AC Milan in the lead, 1:0. The stadium erupted with joy as the deadlock was broken by a piece of brilliance.\n\nShortly after the goal, tension rose as Mauricio Isla received a yellow card for dissent. The mood among Cagliari's players grew tense as time was running out. They attempted to respond quickly but their efforts were not successful. Their night turned worse when Bruno Alves was shown a straight red card for a serious foul (48:19), with mere moments left until full-time.\n\nAs the final minutes counted down, AC Milan defended their narrow lead fiercely, not allowing Cagliari a way back into the game. Cagliari's last-ditch efforts were fruitless, continually repelled by Milan's disciplined backline. Gianluca Lapadula’s on-target free-kick effort at 49:55 that flew inches over the crossbar could've potentially sealed the match with more comfort for Milan but didn’t add to the scoreline.\n\nFinally, after a hard-fought game, the referee blew his whistle signaling the end of the match at 50:38. AC Milan secured a well-deserved yet hard-fought 1-0 victory over Cagliari. Though the match lacked plenty of genuine goal-scoring opportunities, AC Milan’s persistence paid off.\n\nThe game was an exemplar of tactical playing, where Milan's superior game management and consistent pressing earned them the crucial three points. For Cagliari, the match exhibited areas needing refinement especially in converting their counter-attacking chances. Despite moments of tension and fervor, the hosts AC Milan emerged victoriously, albeit in a match marked more by its strategic execution than exhilarating action."
