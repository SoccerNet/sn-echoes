    "summary": "It was an eventful, tightly contested Milan derby between AC Milan and Inter that ended in a dramatic 2-2 draw at the iconic San Siro. From the very first whistle blown by referee Paolo Tagliavento, it was clear that this match would be fiercely competitive, with both teams striving to gain the upper hand right from the start.\n\nAC Milan kicked off the proceedings, but within mere seconds, the ball went out of play, rendering an early throw-in to Inter. This opening period was characterized by both teams exchanging possession and a slew of minor stoppages, with the ball going out of play multiple times. Inter attempted an early direct approach, with Danilo D'Ambrosio sending a long ball forward in the first ten minutes, only for it to be comfortably gathered by AC Milan's seasoned goalkeeper, Gianluigi Donnarumma.\n\nThe tension was palpable as early as the fourth minute when Inter conceded a foul, giving AC Milan their first indirect free-kick of the match. Although this opportunity didn't yield any results, it set the tone for a game rife with physical duels and tactical fouls. This was evident when Geoffrey Kondogbia was shown a yellow card in the 19th minute for a rough tackle after bringing down an AC Milan player. Milan themselves weren’t angels, with Juraj Kucka picking up a booking in the 21st minute for a bad tackle.\n\nInter showcased their attacking intentions early on with numerous shots, albeit mostly off target. In the 9th minute, their first major effort came when they took a shot that unfortunately went wide. However, Inter's persistent pressure led to a series of corner kicks which, while not immediately fruitful, kept AC Milan's defense constantly on alert. The Milan defense, led by Donnarumma, had to be at their best with Marcelo Brozovic and his colleagues repeatedly threatening, albeit without the final touch needed to secure a goal.\n\nOn the other side, AC Milan also had their moments. An attempt by Mattia De Sciglio in the 40th minute, a well-taken long-range effort, forced Samir Handanovic into action, and just over a minute later, Carlos Bacca’s sharp shot on target was another test for the Inter goalkeeper.\n\nThe breakthrough came in the 42nd minute. AC Milan’s Suso, having collected a precise pass from Giacomo Bonaventura on the edge of the penalty area, unleashed a superb strike into the bottom left corner, leaving Handanovic helpless and giving Milan a 1-0 lead. The goal was greeted with rapturous applause, and seemed to jar Inter, who, despite having dominated spells of possession, found themselves trailing.\n\nInter, refusing to be cowed, kicked off again and continued to fight back but without much success before the halftime whistle. AC Milan retired to the dressing room with a slender but precious 1-0 lead.\n\nThe second half began with Inter kicking off, and AC Milan immediately looking to push forward. Just minutes into the half, Ignazio Abate of AC Milan tried feeding Carlos Bacca with a long through ball, but it was intercepted by Inter’s defense. A pattern had been set, with Milan altering their strategy to balance their defensive stability alongside swift counter-attacks.\n\nDuring these initial exchanges, a major turning point occurred in the 49th minute when Antonio Candreva seized a moment of brilliance to level the score for Inter. Candreva beat two defenders before firing in a rocketed shot from just outside the penalty area into the top right corner. His goal underscored his individual talent and was celebrated with great fervor by the Inter supporters.\n\nAC Milan were undeterred and continued pressing. In the 59th minute, Suso, who had been a persistent thorn in Inter’s side, once again showcased his extraordinary ability. His solo run culminated in a precise low shot into the bottom left corner of the net, restoring AC Milan's lead. The score was now 2-1, and Inter found themselves in familiar territory – needing to chase the game.\n\nThe game became even more frenetic as the clock ticked down. Inter’s attempts were met by fierce resistance from AC Milan’s defense and particularly from Donnarumma, who pulled off a string of vital saves, denying Mauro Icardi and other Inter forwards multiple times.\n\nAs the match drew towards its conclusion, Inter ramped up their efforts, and it paid off in the dying moments of the game. A corner taken by Joao Mario was knocked down by Jeison Murillo, and Ivan Perisic was impeccably placed to finish from close range, leveling the score at 2-2. His goal in the 94th minute was a testament to Inter’s relentless pressure and determination to salvage something from the game. Perisic, despite his earlier yellow card, was nothing short of heroic for Inter, linking up play and driving the team forward.\n\nAC Milan tried to fashion a last-ditch effort but couldn’t effectively penetrate Inter’s defense in the closing stages. The referee’s whistle, signaling the end of an intense 48 minutes of the second half, saw both sets of players exhausted but acknowledging a hard-fought affair.\n\nThis draw leaves both teams with plenty of work to do as they push forward in their respective campaigns. AC Milan will ponder over the missed opportunity to close out the match, while Inter can take heart from their remarkable resilience, clawing back a game that seemed to be slipping away from them. It was a match that had everything – drama, spectacular goals, tactical battles, and above all, the unyielding dynamism that defines a Milan derby. \n\nIn the final analysis, neither team exhibited overwhelming dominance but delivered an entertaining and nail-biting spectacle that left fans craving more. The game highlighted both sides' strengths and vulnerabilities – Milan's counter-attacking prowess versus Inter’s resolute build-up play. For the aficionados of Italian football, it was a fitting showcase of passion, skill, and drama inherent in one of football's most storied rivalries."
