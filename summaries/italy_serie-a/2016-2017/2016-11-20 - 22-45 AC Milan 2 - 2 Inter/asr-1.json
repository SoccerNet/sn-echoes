    "input": "\n    AC Milan 2 - 2 Inter\n\nFirst Half:\n\n0:0 Comment: Samir Handanovich number 1, one of the best rotaries not only in Italy, but throughout Europe.\n0:5 Comment: Next on the defensive line on the right is number 33 Danilo Dambrosio.\n0:9 Comment: Playing number 15 on the left is our good friend Christian Ansaldi.\n0:13 Comment: In the center of defense there are 25 Joao Miranda and number 17, attention, Harry Medel.\n0:20 Comment: Today the player is nominally a midfielder.\n0:23 Comment: Three football players in the center of the field.\n0:25 Comment: Portuguese Joao Mario is Inter's most expensive transfer this summer.\n0:29 Comment: Next to him is the most expensive Inter transfer of last summer.\n0:32 Comment: Number 7 Jafray Kandagbia and also number 7, 7 with them Marcello Brozovic.\n0:39 Comment: Croatian midfielder.\n0:41 Comment: The attacking group on the right plays number 8, 7 Antonio Condreva.\n0:44 Comment: Number 44 Ivan Peresic and finally Inter 9 captain's striker Mauro Icardi.\n0:51 Comment: Inter coach Stepan Apioli.\n0:53 Comment: The football players in white shorts and black and blue T-shirts are starting off quite cheerfully.\n0:59 Comment: These are Inter players and to be honest, we have Nobel and I here, again, not a huge plasma.\n1:4 Comment: Therefore, it’s a little difficult, yes, to look for this contrast, catch it with your eyes and determine it,\n1:10 Comment: Where are the Inter or Milan players.\n1:12 Comment: But it’s good that at least the Interists have white shorts and socks in Milan.\n1:17 Comment: To your attention Gian Luigi Donnaruma.\n1:19 Comment: Number 99 is the team's goal.\n1:22 Comment: Outfield players Inya Caobate number 20, Mateo Descilio number 2, Gabriel Paletto number 29,\n1:28 Comment: Gustavo Gomez number 15, Manuel Locotelli number 73, Juraj Kutska number 33, Giacomo Bonaventura number 5,\n1:36 Comment: Carlos Bacca number 70, Suso number 8, Imba Enyan number 11, Vincenzo Mantello.\n1:43 Comment: The head coach of Milan, who is currently in the top three.\n1:49 Comment: In the Italian Championship, however, La Zio Talante has the same amount, about 25 points.\n1:54 Comment: Today's referee is Pohuelto Liavento, assistants Ellinito Di Liberatore and Lorenzo Manganelli.\n2:2 Comment: Reserve referee Marco Barberatti.\n2:5 Comment: The whole brigade, naturally, is Italian in Italy.\n2:7 Comment: It's logical, Italians play football.\n2:9 Comment: Well, this is throwing the ball in and out of the side.\n2:12 Comment: Well, and Vincenzo Mantello, one of the most successful young coaches that Italy has.\n2:18 Comment: Currently working in Milan.\n2:20 Comment: And in the stands we saw the new coach of Inter.\n2:24 Comment: He is at headquarters, he appeared at headquarters.\n2:26 Comment: This is the famous Walter Samuel.\n2:28 Comment: An excellent defender, who, who knows, maybe will be responsible for working with defenders.\n2:34 Comment:  Especially...\n2:35 Comment: It's fashionable lately.\n2:36 Comment: Yes, and even more so the line of defense is constantly changing.\n2:39 Comment: We'll talk about this at Inter too.\n2:41 Comment: Milan's first attack came through the flank.\n2:43 Comment: It didn't come to the point of hitting the turn.\n2:45 Comment: Milan with the ball.\n2:47 Comment: Milan, in principle, likes to tinker with the ball this season under a new coach who, in fact, practices.\n2:55 Comment: Such long, thoughtful control.\n2:57 Comment: Let's say that if Milan is in third place, the team is basically doing well.\n3:2 Comment: Team Milan.\n3:3 Comment: Inter have quite serious problems.\n3:6 Comment: 11th line in the table.\n3:8 Comment: Inter scored only 17 points.\n3:11 Comment: And here Mbain Young rushes into the penalty area, exposing Medel’s body.\n3:15 Comment: And, in my opinion, Milan didn’t even earn a corner.\n3:18 Comment: An amazing story when two football players came together, one of whom is two heads taller than the other, not just one.\n3:24 Comment: And here, again, thanks to this work of this little boletus peasant, Medel’s corps exhibits such a thing.\n3:32 Comment: And indeed we see that Young touched the last ball.\n3:34 Comment: Amazing portal.\n3:35 Comment: Yes, the replay is wonderful, but at the same time we heard how indignant San Siro was.\n3:40 Comment: Inter fans are in the minority today, Milan fans are more.\n3:43 Comment: The host today is nominally Milan, so Milan fans will probably even have some suspicions about a penalty.\n3:49 Comment:  Oh come on.\n3:50 Comment: I think, after all, in such a match, especially since we know the latest trends in Italian arbitration, such penalties will not be awarded.\n4:1 Comment: Handanovic plays carefully, passing it back to Medel.\n4:6 Comment: And one more pass inside the penalty area.\n4:8 Comment: Everyone here is calm and cool.\n4:10 Comment: And the second reverse pass by the defender.\n4:12 Comment: We see that Inter under Piola, in any case, yes, this may be the first observation, is also trying not to give the ball away in vain.\n4:19 Comment: Attack through the flank.\n4:20 Comment: Mansaldi plays Joa Mario.\n4:22 Comment: The Portuguese puts up the body.\n4:24 Comment: And in the end, Peresic keeps the ball for Inter.\n4:27 Comment: There will be a lot of fighting today.\n4:29 Comment: Get ready for this, Khandakbeyaev.\n4:31 Comment: And breaking the rules.\n4:32 Comment: Here's a shout out to Suso, who recently celebrated his birthday.\n4:36 Comment: And now Suso, no matter how it sounds, maybe even somewhere sad, is the leader of Milan in terms of actions ahead.\n4:42 Comment: Well, you know, Nobel, just a little more and we’ll completely drive the audience away from the television screens, yes.\n4:48 Comment: Abbot and Captain Icardi, Captain Suso, one of the leaders.\n4:52 Comment: Although Suso isn't very cute.\n4:54 Comment: Suso, he has a wonderful, wonderful left leg.\n4:57 Comment: Too much was just expected of him early in his career.\n5:1 Comment: Now maybe it's really gaining the momentum it should have.\n5:4 Comment: Well, let's be happy for what's progressing.\n5:6 Comment: Attack through the flank.\n5:7 Comment: Here Peresic is against an opponent.\n5:9 Comment: It's picking up speed.\n5:10 Comment: And here Gomez and, in my opinion, the Abbot defended together.\n5:15 Comment: Inter earned a corner kick.\n5:17 Comment: Inter started this meeting actively.\n5:19 Comment: Already 5 minutes behind.\n5:21 Comment: Inter attack a lot.\n5:23 Comment: And now the standard position of Marcellus Brozovic.\n5:25 Comment: Mechan.\n5:26 Comment: He had a conflict with the previous Inter coach Frank Deboer.\n5:29 Comment: And now Brozovic is returning to the team.\n5:31 Comment: Joa Mario.\n5:32 Comment: The Portuguese is trying to serve.\n5:35 Comment: I've been looking for an opportunity for this for a long time.\n5:37 Comment: But they don’t receive any supply.\n5:38 Comment: Suso got him.\n5:39 Comment: Picks up Lokotel.\n5:41 Comment: Gives a pass to Baku.\n5:45 Comment: On whom the rules are broken.\n5:46 Comment: Baca, Milan's top scorer last season, scored 18 goals.\n5:52 Comment: Not the most pleasant episode.\n5:54 Comment: Now he has gone 334 minutes without a goal in the current championship.\n5:59 Comment: Niang vs Medel again.\n6:2 Comment: Nianga holds the corner.\n6:3 Comment: And, in my opinion, he passed the pass without looking.\n6:6 Comment: Although there was one of the poker players breaking out at the near post.\n6:9 Comment: Kondreva threw the ball well.\n6:11 Comment: But the player himself has to be turned around from the Italian national team.\n6:17 Comment: But so far everything is fine with the pace of the game.\n6:20 Comment: And many hints that the goals will not see you.\n6:24 Comment: I want to believe it.\n6:25 Comment: I want to believe in Sekander Bey.\n6:27 Comment: Also, by the way, returned to Inter.\n6:29 Comment: He practically didn't play under Debourg.\n6:31 Comment: But the football player is extremely talented.\n6:33 Comment: Whoever watched his performance in Monaco and Seville, I think, remembers this very well.\n6:40 Comment: Kondreva is with the ball again.\n6:41 Comment: Antonio loses the ball.\n6:42 Comment: Niang, that's a lot of fighting, huh?\n6:45 Comment: Literally instantly they do not allow the football player with the ball to raise his head.\n6:48 Comment: Yes, for now there are a little more emotions, a little less thoughts.\n6:53 Comment: That's how Bruno Alves arrived.\n6:55 Comment: Bruno Alves and Marco Borielo, Calleri footballers.\n6:59 Comment: Maybe they also just like to watch football from the stadium in their free time.\n7:5 Comment: By the way, Nobel will confirm that not all football players like to watch football in their free time.\n7:11 Comment: And even more so to go to other arenas.\n7:14 Comment: But this is Italy, and here football is a religion.\n7:16 Comment: The day before, Callieri played Veroni.\n7:18 Comment: Veron is pretty close to Anton Anajosa.\n7:20 Comment: For this reason they are here in Milan.\n7:23 Comment: The afternoon was light shopping, then a delicious dinner or lunch.\n7:26 Comment: And now in the evening go to the famous Milan Derby.\n7:30 Comment: Well, it's like dessert now.\n7:31 Comment: Inter's attack is on the flank again.\n7:35 Comment: The width of the attack was achieved thanks to the transfer to De Ambrosi, who has problems with processing.\n7:40 Comment: But he returns the ball to himself and serves to Mario.\n7:44 Comment: The defenders of Milan cope here.\n7:47 Comment: This is Abate, moved to the central zone again.\n7:51 Comment: Susan.\n7:54 Comment: Crazy pressure puts Inter on.\n7:56 Comment: And that's how he hits forward, if I'm not mistaken, Gomez.\n7:59 Comment: And eventually losing the ball.\n8:1 Comment: Inter is still a little more cold-blooded, or something, at these moments.\n8:5 Comment: It's as if Inter knows better how to handle the ball.\n8:9 Comment: But, nevertheless, Nobel had two situations at once,\n8:11 Comment: When An-Yang, in fact, found himself face to face with Medel.\n8:14 Comment: Had he beaten him, some space would have opened up there.\n8:18 Comment: Kandre Lam, he is with the ball, he is a recognized assistant in this team, of course.\n8:25 Comment: He’s very good at distributing passes, and, in principle, hitting too.\n8:29 Comment: But so far, he probably hasn’t hit the right stride,\n8:32 Comment: which he demonstrated in his best matches for Latso.\n8:36 Comment: When Kandre Lam is in shape, he is, of course, a footballer,\n8:39 Comment: whose position is very difficult.\n8:42 Comment: Miranda. Another pass to Christian Ansaldi.\n8:45 Comment: Ansaldi, Joe Mario, Ansaldi is back with the ball.\n8:49 Comment: Kept it for Kandegbia and already Zhofrey Kandegbia on Kandra.\n8:54 Comment: That one to the right was not the most successful pass over Ambrosie.\n8:56 Comment: But Inter agreed with him still with the ball.\n8:59 Comment: Please note, some first developments,\n9:1 Comment: But, again, it’s difficult to compare with what Deboer had.\n9:5 Comment: It's clear that this is Debur's team,\n9:6 Comment: Although, on the other hand, Manchin prepared her for the season.\n9:9 Comment: And now Piol.\n9:10 Comment: It must be said that Kandreva regularly moves from the flank to the midline of the field.\n9:15 Comment: We know that he and Vlatso often went there too.\n9:19 Comment: Well, all the right-hand cleaning has been given to Ambrosi.\n9:24 Comment: Donoruma tried to play exactly on the right flank,\n9:29 Comment: But it didn't work out.\n9:31 Comment: A young star of Italian football, no one doubts that anymore.\n9:35 Comment: Donoruma is the future of all Italian calce.\n9:41 Comment: Nobile, when he announced the Inter lineup, immediately said who plays in what position.\n9:45 Comment: To convince you that Milan's scheme is very similar.\n9:51 Comment: Or Inter's is similar to Milan's.\n9:53 Comment: It's almost a mirror situation.\n9:55 Comment: Deshilyev on the left, on the right defense Abbatto, Paletto and Homer.\n9:58 Comment: A bunch of central defenders.\n10:0 Comment: Although, of course, Romagnoli originally looked like this,\n10:4 Comment: but he's damaged.\n10:5 Comment: Benamintura, Lokotel and Yakutsko are the three central midfielders.\n10:8 Comment: In attack to the left is Niang, to the right is Suso and Baka, the center forward.\n10:12 Comment: Milan has been playing 4-3-3 since the beginning of the season.\n10:15 Comment: Candreo, here he is on his native right side serving,\n10:19 Comment: But Niang, already trained to defend in recent seasons, was up to speed in this situation.\n10:28 Comment: Arsel Brozovic adjusts to the ball to take a corner kick.\n10:35 Comment: Well, let's see, Inter have masters of the game on the second floor.\n10:39 Comment: This is Joa Mario, this is Miranda, of course, this is Cardi, first of all, he now attacks Kondogbia and hits Kondogbia in the embroidery.\n10:48 Comment: Yes, but at the same time, agree, Nobel, that there is no second tall central defender.\n10:53 Comment: I mean, of course, Murillo, although Murillo is perhaps not so much tall as he is very jumpy.\n10:58 Comment: Yes, and Medel is a little helper in this situation on standards.\n11:2 Comment: In general, an interesting decision from Stefan Pioli, Murillo in the application.\n11:6 Comment: Murillo could have been on the field today.\n11:7 Comment: I admit that this is a bit of a problem due to the fact that Murillo was in Colombia, a long, long flight.\n11:15 Comment: Although, on the other hand, many players on the field, both Inter and Milan, flew to selective matches in South America.\n11:23 Comment: Therefore, rather, this is a purely coaching decision, because maybe Garry Medel is in good shape.\n11:29 Comment: Milan intercepts the ball in the middle of the field.\n11:31 Comment: There was also a violation of the rules here.\n11:33 Comment: There are enough contacts, but not enough whistles.\n11:35 Comment: Agree, in this regard, Toliavento’s refereeing is impressive so far.\n11:40 Comment: Speaking about the problems with the squad, let us note, of course, Milan.\n11:43 Comment: Because today, in my opinion, the rising star of European football, Olesya Romagnoli, is also not playing for Milan.\n11:51 Comment: A central defender who is only 22 years old, 21 years old if I'm not mistaken.\n11:55 Comment: He has amazing press in Italy.\n11:57 Comment: He's already an Italian national team player.\n11:59 Comment: A couple of Romagnoli banuchi are considered the main ones, for example, for the World Cup in Russia, if, of course, Italy makes it to the World Cup.\n12:8 Comment: So Romagnoli is doing well, except for his form.\n12:11 Comment: He took physical readiness tests yesterday, but failed to pass them.\n12:16 Comment: And that’s why, after the injury, I haven’t yet gained the necessary condition.\n12:19 Comment: Here Kutska got a little stagnant, maybe staring at the performance in the stands.\n12:28 Comment: We see a lot of banners.\n12:30 Comment: It's always a different story.\n12:32 Comment: Banner war between Milan and Inter fans.\n12:35 Comment: And Kutska didn't come out of offside.\n12:37 Comment: Indeed, Nobel is right, he brings order to Romagnoli’s health.\n12:40 Comment: He got injured just when he was in the camp of the Italian national team.\n12:44 Comment: That’s why Mantello was probably racking his brains over who to put up.\n12:49 Comment: Because there is also Zapata, a highly experienced Colombian, but he didn’t play much, he didn’t get into shape there either after he was injured.\n12:57 Comment: In the end, the choice fell on Gomez, who played this season.\n13:1 Comment: I can’t say that he was always successful in doing this.\n13:5 Comment: Kondogbia plays Harry Medel.\n13:7 Comment: With the ball he chills with a pass to the right flank to D'Ambrosio.\n13:10 Comment: And here, accordingly, Kakov Nyang is lost under pressure.\n13:14 Comment: I took the ball myself, essentially alone.\n13:19 Comment: And again Niang with the ball.\n13:20 Comment: Monumentura, bad transmission, but agile Niang with Monumentura.\n13:24 Comment: Shibell didn't take the ball away.\n13:27 Comment: It will be very interesting to watch martial arts.\n13:29 Comment: If such things happen often in the game.\n13:32 Comment: Kondogbia and Niang, because, by the way, they are similar players.\n13:35 Comment: Here is Inter's counterattack on the right side.\n13:37 Comment: Joao Mario was left alone with Paletta.\n13:40 Comment: Pass to Icardi.\n13:41 Comment: Dangerous moment, strike!\n13:43 Comment: The donor is in place.\n13:44 Comment: It was played well, very quickly.\n13:46 Comment: Mainly touch.\n13:48 Comment: And, in fact, this is the first such more or less scoring chance.\n13:53 Comment: Let's celebrate Icardi, who even while falling managed to make an important touch.\n13:57 Comment: And he seemed to throw the ball to Peresic and beat Karvat.\n14:0 Comment: But the blow, remember the Euro, how can Peresic be?\n14:4 Comment: The blow clearly didn't work here.\n14:6 Comment: Deshila has enough free space in front of him.\n14:9 Comment: But he was busy here.\n14:11 Comment: Before, you had to give a pass.\n14:13 Comment: Please note that so far Milan is almost not attacking on the right side.\n14:17 Comment: Exclusively through the left.\n14:19 Comment: Another pretty rough move against Icardi.\n14:22 Comment: The Inter captain is suffering.\n14:24 Comment: The stadium is indignant.\n14:27 Comment: Although it seems like the ball was won.\n14:33 Comment: We'll see here.\n14:35 Comment: No, you know, and there was no intention to play rudely.\n14:39 Comment: Just really backhanded the ball.\n14:41 Comment: And simply by inertia the opponent flew further.\n14:44 Comment: It seems to me that this is absolutely the right decision.\n14:46 Comment: Referee Milan is still in such a defensive position.\n14:50 Comment: Predominantly the entire crew on the semi-nipole is their own.\n14:53 Comment: Only a tank there between the defenders of the scum.\n14:57 Comment: Ansaldi is back on kengbia.\n15:1 Comment: The loss has passed.\n15:2 Comment: Handled the ball poorly.\n15:6 Comment: In this episode, our match is already 15 minutes behind.\n15:9 Comment: Milan-Inter are goalless in the Milan derby so far.\n15:14 Comment: Rivalry between Milan and Inter on January 10.\n15:18 Comment: He's been performing for 108 years.\n15:20 Comment: It's a really big story.\n15:23 Comment: A huge number of matches.\n15:25 Comment: We'll dive into these statistics a little later.\n15:28 Comment: Moreover, it is not so one-sided.\n15:33 Comment: It's all pretty much the same there.\n15:36 Comment: Well, it’s understandable that under such circumstances you are aware, of course,\n15:44 Comment: Both the players themselves understand and the fans understand,\n15:46 Comment: that soon, perhaps, the team will have other lineups,\n15:49 Comment: When will other financial flows begin.\n15:51 Comment: So it's a special darga.\n15:52 Comment: Joa Mario with the ball.\n15:53 Comment: A very dangerous moment, perhaps the Portuguese did not dare to strike.\n15:57 Comment: Get his serve.\n15:59 Comment: Waiting to change.\n16:0 Comment: No, the ball is on the right flank.\n16:1 Comment: Kondrev is playing tricks.\n16:2 Comment: Serves and...\n16:3 Comment:  Badly.\n16:5 Comment: Yes, we see that Milan has problems with attacking through the center.\n16:9 Comment: He goes through the flank because he is active on the left\n16:12 Comment: either Deshile or Nyan.\n16:14 Comment: But in the middle of the field there is still a blank there.\n16:17 Comment: Neither Beneventura nor Kutska can play out.\n16:20 Comment: Not before Locotelli.\n16:22 Comment: Dim, let's note that Locotelli's press was so crazy\n16:27 Comment: after the match with Juventus, when he didn’t decide the match with his miracle strike.\n16:32 Comment: But today Locotelli is still a bit heavy.\n16:34 Comment: But he's only 18 years old.\n16:35 Comment: Friends, let's not forget about this.\n16:36 Comment:  He is 18 years old.\n16:37 Comment: He plays a key role in the Milan derby for the Milan team.\n16:41 Comment: He's a central midfielder.\n16:43 Comment: It’s also interesting how Montello will perform not so much as a coach,\n16:47 Comment: how much in the role of a teacher.\n16:49 Comment: Because these are still schoolchildren with him.\n16:51 Comment: Donna Ruma, Locotelli.\n16:53 Comment: The guys face fame, attention, and expectations.\n16:58 Comment: Milan lives in the mountain.\n16:59 Comment: Yes, and of course they need somewhere to rest.\n17:3 Comment: But we understand that Milan has problems in the center.\n17:6 Comment: After all, they also told me that Montolivo was seriously injured.\n17:9 Comment: Bertolaci doesn't play.\n17:11 Comment: Another central midfielder.\n17:12 Comment: And Calabria, yes, he’s also injured a lot.\n17:15 Comment: And Inter, in my opinion, only has one injured.\n17:21 Comment: Yes, this is Rodrigo Palacio.\n17:22 Comment: Otherwise, everyone is healed.\n17:24 Comment: Transfer to icardi failed.\n17:28 Comment: Garry Medel plays on the right wing.\n17:30 Comment: Here D'Ambrosio with the ball is trying to find a continuation of the attack.\n17:34 Comment: Joamario, he is a very active Portuguese today, as he always is.\n17:37 Comment: Joamario entered the penalty area well.\n17:39 Comment: Dali D'Ambrosio.\n17:40 Comment: Milan has a lot of players behind the ball.\n17:43 Comment: Kandekbia, what will Kandekbia come up with.\n17:46 Comment: Kandekbiy's sharpness is missing.\n17:48 Comment: It's like he can't find...\n17:51 Comment: I would even say Nobel has the courage to play.\n17:54 Comment: Yes, you're right, courage.\n17:55 Comment: Kandekbia will either play across or play backwards.\n17:58 Comment: Even though Anton Abatem can make a pass.\n18:2 Comment: Moving forward.\n18:3 Comment: He has Suso on his right here.\n18:5 Comment: Ready to accelerate in an instant.\n18:7 Comment: And Suso does the translation.\n18:9 Comment:  Here.\n18:10 Comment: Runs around, shifts Nyan to the center.\n18:12 Comment: Bakor is practically without the ball.\n18:14 Comment: It's still working.\n18:15 Comment: We know that sometimes one jerk and one touch are enough for him to make a fight.\n18:21 Comment: Mansaldi is on the left flank.\n18:23 Comment: Argentinian.\n18:24 Comment: In front of him are two football players again.\n18:26 Comment: This is such a struggle in every part of the field.\n18:28 Comment: Locotelli.\n18:29 Comment: Here he is with the ball from Locotelli to Suso.\n18:32 Comment: Kutska turns around.\n18:33 Comment:  Not bad.\n18:34 Comment: Bonamentura.\n18:35 Comment: It was a good idea to make a pass to the left now.\n18:36 Comment: He's not going through retirement.\n18:37 Comment: But if he had made this transfer earlier, it would have turned out faster.\n18:41 Comment: But here Inter has already managed to rebuild.\n18:43 Comment: Here Medel again grabbed the crab into Nyanga.\n18:47 Comment: But there is a continuation through Bonamenture.\n18:49 Comment: Miranda wins the fight against Bucky.\n18:52 Comment: But before that there was a foul.\n18:54 Comment: Jeffrey Candembia receives a yellow card for fouling Djakova Bonamentura.\n19:1 Comment: If I'm not mistaken, number 5 is number 2 on the lawn.\n19:3 Comment:  Curious.\n19:4 Comment: Well, there really seemed to be a foul there.\n19:6 Comment: Why the yellow card?\n19:8 Comment: After all, he didn't use his elbow.\n19:9 Comment: He pushed him in the chest with his hand.\n19:10 Comment: Exposed.\n19:11 Comment: That is, he blocked the opponent.\n19:12 Comment: I think Taliamento has gone a little overboard here.\n19:15 Comment: Moreover, this replay that we just saw indicates that,\n19:18 Comment: that Taliamento may even have made such a methodological mistake.\n19:23 Comment: He immediately turned his gaze, we saw it in him, to the next couple.\n19:28 Comment: Where Baca and Miranda fought.\n19:31 Comment: And I no longer saw how Kandembia flew into his opponent.\n19:35 Comment: And he, in principle, did nothing more than rude.\n19:37 Comment: I think the yellow card is too much here.\n19:40 Comment: Moreover, the defensive midfielder is already on a yellow card in the 20th minute.\n19:43 Comment: It's always dangerous.\n19:44 Comment: Bonamentura performs the standard superbly.\n19:48 Comment: Yes, Bonamentura is a great master.\n19:50 Comment: He's really turning into an Italian national team player.\n19:53 Comment: Already a starter under Giampiero Venturi.\n19:56 Comment: Well, actually, they’re almost adno-surnames.\n19:59 Comment: Bonamentura or simply Ventura.\n20:1 Comment: In any case, this will be an interesting adventure for both the Italian team.\n20:7 Comment: Well, for now the standard position.\n20:11 Comment: So, Bonamentura, the presentation is good.\n20:15 Comment: Marcello Brozovic.\n20:16 Comment: Well, the presentation was, dammit, the best.\n20:18 Comment: I couldn't even transfer the first echelon.\n20:21 Comment: Although all the partners have already moved deeper into the penalty area.\n20:27 Comment: D'Shilem comes in from the sideline.\n20:29 Comment: He has an offer from Niang, from Bonamentura.\n20:33 Comment: Of course, he puts his powerful corps against Nyanga.\n20:35 Comment: Against him, De Ambrosio was a clean winner.\n20:38 Comment: A counterattack has begun.\n20:40 Comment: And here is a very competent fall, in my opinion, from Locotelli.\n20:45 Comment: Yes, Locotelli played competently.\n20:48 Comment: Stopped Inter's attack, which could have happened very quickly.\n20:51 Comment: Zhou Mario.\n20:53 Comment: It was a good idea, but the pass didn't go down the flank.\n20:56 Comment: D'Shilem, it seems to me, was a little hasty.\n20:58 Comment: I could have gotten this ball on my feet without throwing myself into a tackle.\n21:1 Comment: But, most importantly, any danger of an inter attack has been prevented.\n21:7 Comment: Inter have more possession of the ball, but, again, they lack original solutions.\n21:12 Comment: Because Milan's central defenders and midfielders interact very closely.\n21:17 Comment: Zhou Mario threw the ball to Condreva with his head.\n21:21 Comment: Not exactly. Palette.\n21:23 Comment: Carrying the ball forward.\n21:24 Comment: Gori Medel. What a jump from Gori Medel, one of the shortest footballers in the Italian Serie A.\n21:31 Comment: Kipishnobils begin to lose this fight over and over again.\n21:35 Comment: Kutskal, Kotelli, those who feel good at lunch, in principle.\n21:40 Comment: And the Slovakian midfielder receives a yellow card.\n21:45 Comment: Well, very frankly.\n21:46 Comment: He was having a hug with Kondagbia here.\n21:50 Comment: And right in front of the referee.\n21:52 Comment: A sick meter away from him.\n21:53 Comment: Well, consistent anyway, yes, Tagliavento.\n21:56 Comment: Because he gave a yellow card for a not-so-rude foul in the previous episode.\n22:0 Comment: Well, here too.\n22:1 Comment: I evened the score on the cards.\n22:2 Comment: And this is another serve.\n22:3 Comment: Well, by the way, there is also approximately equality in innings.\n22:6 Comment: The Milan player and the Inter player had both failures.\n22:13 Comment: Palette on your screens.\n22:14 Comment: The whistle was also blown here.\n22:17 Comment: Apparently not.\n22:18 Comment: No, they're playing the gate.\n22:20 Comment: Paletta is outraged by the way he was captured here by his rival.\n22:25 Comment: Donoruma is wrong again.\n22:27 Comment: For the second time in the first 23 minutes under Vodyanichan.\n22:33 Comment: You know, Nobel noticed such a thing a long time ago.\n22:36 Comment: And Ruslan Nigmatulin told me about this, too,\n22:40 Comment: With whom we once commented on Milan matches.\n22:43 Comment: That Donoruma likes to play passing, but doesn't quite know how to do it yet.\n22:49 Comment:  Ideally.\n22:50 Comment: It is clear that he is learning as a player.\n22:52 Comment:  This is true.\n22:53 Comment: Friends, I'm 17 years old.\n22:54 Comment: People are studying at school at this time.\n22:57 Comment: Basically, they're finishing school.\n23:0 Comment: I'm not even talking about football at the level of the Milan derb.\n23:3 Comment: Bonaventura intercepted the ball and released it.\n23:6 Comment: It's a bit far.\n23:7 Comment: Miranda has caught up.\n23:9 Comment: Ball first.\n23:10 Comment: Well, so far the defender is leaving without any major mistakes.\n23:15 Comment: Susom passed the transfer to Bonaventure.\n23:18 Comment: Breaking the rules.\n23:19 Comment: I think he did.\n23:20 Comment: Fulfilled.\n23:21 Comment: And there was nothing reprehensible there.\n23:24 Comment: Bonaventura only felt the contact and immediately spread his arms.\n23:27 Comment: Andre Avam.\n23:28 Comment: He has a proposal on the right.\n23:29 Comment: D'Ambrosio is picking up speed there.\n23:31 Comment: The pass goes to D'Ambrosio.\n23:33 Comment: You can cut the corner, but he serves to Icarnius.\n23:36 Comment: And who brought up the rear there?\n23:38 Comment: Peresic.\n23:39 Comment: Peresic brought up the rear.\n23:40 Comment: A brilliant attack from Inter.\n23:42 Comment: Almost perfect.\n23:43 Comment: D'Ambrosio got involved very cleverly.\n23:45 Comment: And he served it correctly to the far post.\n23:47 Comment: Peresic was already there.\n23:48 Comment: And Horvat's only problem is that he didn't hit the goal.\n23:51 Comment: That's just his problem.\n23:53 Comment: Look.\n23:54 Comment: The Milanese football players did not have time on all fronts.\n23:56 Comment: I mean Milan, Rossoneri.\n23:58 Comment: Because there is a hole on the right flank as well.\n24:0 Comment: And they allowed me to file.\n24:3 Comment: And three players could immediately respond to this serve.\n24:6 Comment: Because there is another player behind Peresic.\n24:9 Comment: Yes, there was Joe Amario.\n24:10 Comment: Friends, half of the Milan derb is behind us.\n24:12 Comment: In the first half, naturally, Inter succeeds much more.\n24:16 Comment: Inter already have two very good chances.\n24:18 Comment: Both from Peresic, who was obliged to realize at least one.\n24:22 Comment:  In my opinion.\n24:23 Comment: Milan's plan in this situation is not yet entirely clear.\n24:26 Comment: But Inter came out with the ball and controlled the game.\n24:29 Comment: And dance on your own.\n24:31 Comment:  It is obvious.\n24:32 Comment: And note that almost everything is the most dangerous and curious\n24:36 Comment: It’s happening on the Brovka closest to us, via telekron.\n24:39 Comment: But here, from the far Brovka, it all began.\n24:42 Comment: Peresic gets the ball down the flank again.\n24:44 Comment: I would like to note the assist from Ansaldi, who played very competently.\n24:48 Comment: I let Peresic break through and it was a corner kick.\n24:51 Comment: Horvath has earned it.\n24:53 Comment: Let's note Locotelli's tackle.\n24:55 Comment: Very timely, carefully, without any hint of possible contact.\n25:0 Comment: Inside the penalty area.\n25:2 Comment: But we'll talk about the contract later.\n25:4 Comment: Serve!\n25:6 Comment: Was it a discount or a blow?\n25:8 Comment: More blows.\n25:9 Comment: By contact, it seemed to me.\n25:11 Comment: The replay will probably judge us.\n25:14 Comment: Kucka lost this episode.\n25:16 Comment: I think he still hit in the direction of the far corner.\n25:19 Comment: And this is another such half-moment.\n25:21 Comment: Usually you know, well, both fans and commentators, it’s customary to call only those scoring chances,\n25:27 Comment: When the ball was on target there, yes, or when everything was so obvious.\n25:31 Comment: But in this situation, punching a little more accurately would really be dangerous.\n25:35 Comment: Milan's chance, Suso on his right flank.\n25:38 Comment: Transfer to partner again Suso.\n25:41 Comment: One touch, Abando in the penalty area!\n25:45 Comment: But it seems to me that the captain of Milan deceived himself.\n25:48 Comment: Drebbing failed.\n25:50 Comment: But if he wanted to throw the ball on one side with Miranda,\n25:53 Comment: And to run away from the other, then all this should have been done much faster.\n25:56 Comment: It seems to me that he hasn’t yet chosen how he will win.\n25:59 Comment: Yes, he just didn't understand how to beat his opponent.\n26:1 Comment: Now there is already a certain segment beyond Milan.\n26:4 Comment: Almost all field players are located on the field.\n26:8 Comment: Nerra Azzuri, that's what they call it.\n26:11 Comment: Inter players and fans.\n26:14 Comment:  Black blue.\n26:16 Comment: Everything here is simple.\n26:18 Comment: But I still don’t know the number, how about you.\n26:21 Comment: I focus exclusively on white panties and the ghetto.\n26:24 Comment: It's hard to be different.\n26:26 Comment: Yes, it's easier that way.\n26:27 Comment: Dark colors in a T-shirt.\n26:29 Comment: These are such significant colors for clubs.\n26:32 Comment: Donna Ruma again, sorry.\n26:34 Comment: It's a blunder.\n26:35 Comment: Wrong, yes, Donna Ruma.\n26:37 Comment: Kondreva, cross to the far post.\n26:40 Comment: Peresic is here, the ball.\n26:41 Comment: What is the transfer from Peresic to Andagmeya?\n26:45 Comment: Inter's attack continues.\n26:46 Comment: Marcelo Brozovic turned around.\n26:48 Comment: Maybe Brozovic will break through.\n26:50 Comment: Come on Brozovic.\n26:51 Comment: He's got an excellent shot in his stash.\n26:53 Comment: And Kondreva has a pitch.\n26:55 Comment: The attack continues.\n26:56 Comment: Long, dangerous.\n26:58 Comment: There is a feeling that Donna Ruma is not exactly swimming, but she is getting very nervous.\n27:2 Comment: Look, this is where Donna Ruma is wrong.\n27:4 Comment: Either the lawn got in the way, or something else.\n27:6 Comment:  I beg you.\n27:7 Comment: There’s a lawn here, you have to peel without thinking.\n27:9 Comment: In the end, in some completely incomprehensible trajectory, the ball is delivered to the opponent.\n27:15 Comment: And that's where it all started.\n27:18 Comment: Service from Peresic to the near post.\n27:20 Comment: The first one is here.\n27:22 Comment: Yes, wider than Donna Ruma with your fists.\n27:24 Comment: No violation of the rules.\n27:25 Comment: We can continue playing.\n27:27 Comment: Brozovic. Marcella Brozovic with the ball.\n27:29 Comment: Another attempt at serving failed.\n27:32 Comment: Bonementura.\n27:34 Comment: Hits on the flank.\n27:36 Comment: That way forward is the direction of Carlos Baca.\n27:38 Comment: But here is the brave Harry Medel.\n27:43 Comment: Moreover, the body exhibits Medel.\n27:45 Comment: Earns a free kick for his team.\n27:48 Comment: I know for sure, Garry Medel is one of, not exactly the most beloved football players,\n27:53 Comment: Dear Yuri Albertovich Rozanov.\n27:56 Comment: But all the same, including me, we are dragging our feet,\n28:0 Comment: how this player knows how to play big matches.\n28:3 Comment: Both for the national team and for your club.\n28:5 Comment: Here he comes in at the most important moment.\n28:8 Comment: He has this motivation that actually borders on skill and courage.\n28:13 Comment: Feed.\n28:15 Comment: It's great here, by the way, Gustavo played in a difficult situation.\n28:18 Comment: I got out of it, but the attack continues.\n28:20 Comment: Otsade pitches.\n28:22 Comment: A little short.\n28:23 Comment: Medel just gives himself to every game, it seems to me.\n28:26 Comment: If he goes out, he leaves himself completely on the field.\n28:29 Comment: Kondreva.\n28:33 Comment: Although, obviously, he is not the greatest talent, if we take a purely football aspect.\n28:36 Comment: But motivation, skill, tactical training all play in his favor.\n28:44 Comment: Kondreva takes the ball between the lines and strikes.\n28:47 Comment: It was a very good pass and Kondreva opened up great and competently.\n28:51 Comment: In fact, no one really looked after him closely.\n28:53 Comment: That's why he got into the strike position.\n28:56 Comment: But still, the ball dropped a little here.\n29:0 Comment: In any case, Inter's attacking players regularly take balls in those situations,\n29:6 Comment: when there are several solutions at once.\n29:8 Comment: There is a choice.\n29:10 Comment: Brozovic, remember, he also carried the ball, although he could shoot, he could also make a pass.\n29:14 Comment: In general, by the end of the first half hour of the game we understand that Inter is truly superior.\n29:34 Comment: Yes, and Nyang with his sleeper-like legs, in principle, could not easily catch up with the ball.\n29:40 Comment: Or at least try to shoot.\n29:44 Comment: And so Valdi calls or, on the contrary, demands from the partner, from the list, that he open up.\n29:49 Comment: And so it happened.\n29:50 Comment: But the pass was read by the Milan defenders to Utskam to Abbot.\n29:56 Comment: Abbata na Gomez.\n29:57 Comment: Well, the most inexperienced person in this line of defense makes mistakes.\n30:1 Comment: Interception of Kondrev.\n30:3 Comment: Pass on Ambrosio.\n30:5 Comment: There will be a serve attempt.\n30:7 Comment: It's just now with his left foot.\n30:9 Comment: But Gomez is here.\n30:12 Comment: Rule violation on Akaru Shibaka.\n30:15 Comment: Lots of emotions, lots of whistles.\n30:18 Comment: There really are more of them.\n30:20 Comment: Because it seems to me that Milan players often fail to keep up.\n30:23 Comment: Rivals, let there be football here now from the side of the Inter football player.\n30:28 Comment: It was Miranda who was trying to get ahead of the game.\n30:30 Comment: But in such cases, too, they even say in children’s toy schools.\n30:34 Comment: Yes, if you’re already playing, you’re trying to play ahead, but here you have self-government defense.\n30:37 Comment: Don't forget that there is emptiness behind you.\n30:39 Comment: And here it’s either intercept or get rid of.\n30:41 Comment: The main thing is not to lose the ball.\n30:44 Comment: Well, somehow everything was faded and sluggish.\n30:47 Comment: In attack, Milan has Sousse trying to speed up the game.\n30:51 Comment: Remember, he played Sabat’s wall pretty well.\n30:54 Comment: I moved to the center and now I’ve given it towards Niang, let’s put it this way.\n30:58 Comment: But that's all for now.\n31:0 Comment: Where is Bonaventura with his feints, with his sharp passes.\n31:3 Comment: Where is the connection for regular extreme protection.\n31:6 Comment: Here, perhaps, we will see a second yellow card.\n31:10 Comment: For Milan football players.\n31:12 Comment: D'Ambrosio demands her, but Tagliavento is silent.\n31:15 Comment: More precisely, he blew the whistle, but without a yellow card.\n31:17 Comment: Kandreva!\n31:19 Comment: One on one he tries to beat D'Asilio, D'Asilio knocks him down again and now there will be a yellow card.\n31:23 Comment: Second log in literally 10 seconds.\n31:25 Comment: Naturally, the referee will not ignore this.\n31:30 Comment: Let's watch.\n31:32 Comment: Let's watch, because, to be honest, I once very sharply changed my attitude towards Antonio Candreva.\n31:38 Comment: After the Italian national team match.\n31:40 Comment: Probably, yes, there was contact here.\n31:43 Comment: You know, it was a game, God forbid in memory, in general, against one of the Dwarfs.\n31:47 Comment: I think it was Team Malta.\n31:49 Comment: The match was at home, the team was leading 2-0.\n31:52 Comment: Candreva decides to feint.\n31:54 Comment: Although he, in fact, already threw the ball past the opponent.\n31:58 Comment: And in principle, he could even shoot or pass a pass.\n32:1 Comment: And in the absence of any contact, he collapsed.\n32:4 Comment: In the match with Malta.\n32:6 Comment: But it was such a disgrace.\n32:8 Comment: He was also given a yellow card, in my opinion, for simulation.\n32:11 Comment: Well, in general, it was such an obvious simulation,\n32:14 Comment: To be honest, my attitude towards this player has changed.\n32:18 Comment: It was so disgusting, humanly and sportingly.\n32:22 Comment: That’s why we need to watch more replays of Peres’ serve.\n32:25 Comment: But something is not right with the others today.\n32:27 Comment: Once again Locotelli headed the ball.\n32:29 Comment: True, the Interists picked him up quite quickly.\n32:34 Comment: Condequia!\n32:36 Comment: Locotelli interrupted the transmission again.\n32:39 Comment: Juamario in one touch.\n32:41 Comment: But it was too hard and difficult to handle such a ball.\n32:43 Comment: He also pulled out the striking position.\n32:46 Comment: Yes, we see that there may even be a psychological advantage.\n32:50 Comment: Well, and a certain gaming advantage for the inter.\n32:53 Comment: But, again, the last gear is missing.\n32:56 Comment: As is customary to talk about it.\n32:58 Comment: Some kind of decision that the defense will put in the cup.\n33:1 Comment: Milana is here, and Saiten is with Us.\n33:5 Comment: Still, we understand that the situation is quite messed up now.\n33:11 Comment: I'm generally interested in coaching.\n33:14 Comment: Because Mancini prepared the team for the season.\n33:16 Comment: Worked with her most of the season Debur.\n33:20 Comment: Then Stefano Vecchi was taken on as an acting coach for two matches.\n33:24 Comment: And now I've already been drinking.\n33:26 Comment: Counterattack from Milan. There is Baka on the left.\n33:28 Comment: Bonaventure.\n33:30 Comment: Not like Bonaventure, who usually knows how to share the ball.\n33:33 Comment: But here he is clearly apologizing.\n33:37 Comment: He apologizes to Baka because it was so obvious.\n33:40 Comment: We should have made a pass.\n33:42 Comment: It’s clear that Bonaventure wanted to, you know, better make a sign of Baku’s position.\n33:48 Comment: Well, the football players themselves say, play at the expense of your partner.\n33:52 Comment: That is, in theory, Baka should have attracted the attention of one of the defenders.\n33:56 Comment: But there was a safety net there.\n33:58 Comment: Four football players around Bonaventure.\n34:0 Comment: I think he wanted to take a break.\n34:3 Comment: And make a pass under Baki's shot so that Baka rushes into the free zone.\n34:7 Comment: However, apparently they did not understand each other.\n34:9 Comment: Baka and Bonaventure.\n34:11 Comment: Locotelli is tackling again.\n34:13 Comment: Kick up Ambrosio's head.\n34:16 Comment: Yes, for now Milan is content with scraps from the table, crumbs.\n34:21 Comment: Somehow, while Inter has a rather powerful positional offensive.\n34:27 Comment: During which even the defenders are already trying to break through.\n34:30 Comment: I am from Ambrosio.\n34:31 Comment: Well, and from Ansaldi, the other full-back.\n34:33 Comment: He'll look at Peresic.\n34:34 Comment: Service, center of the penalty area.\n34:36 Comment: Peresic brought up the rear more accurately.\n34:38 Comment: Yes, and Peresic again.\n34:40 Comment: So far the balls seem to be sticking.\n34:42 Comment: He can't, he's already scored.\n34:44 Comment: And he served.\n34:45 Comment: Brozovic.\n34:46 Comment: Brozovic, yes.\n34:47 Comment: His compatriot, also a footballer from Croatia, beat Peresic.\n34:50 Comment: But Donna Ruma failed to hit the ball.\n34:54 Comment: Notice how Inter players cover Milan players.\n34:58 Comment: That's why Donna Ruma comes to strike forward like this.\n35:0 Comment: And we are preparing a replacement.\n35:2 Comment: Murillo.\n35:3 Comment: As part of Inter.\n35:4 Comment: Murillo, whom I already spoke about.\n35:6 Comment: This is beetle damage from...\n35:8 Comment: Medela.\n35:10 Comment: Because Miranto has the ball.\n35:12 Comment: Kandegbia is here too.\n35:13 Comment: He's okay.\n35:14 Comment: Perhaps some of the midfielders and Medel will go to the center\n35:17 Comment: fields.\n35:18 Comment:  Let's see.\n35:19 Comment: Dombrosio, serve.\n35:20 Comment: Well, I remember Kandegbia got hit on the leg in one of the trucks.\n35:24 Comment: But here he is, it seems, alive and well, cheerful.\n35:27 Comment: But Medel is really not in the picture.\n35:29 Comment: Is he even out of bounds?\n35:31 Comment: We don't see anything.\n35:32 Comment: Mario cast.\n35:35 Comment: For now Icardi is wandering around the penalty area.\n35:39 Comment: Or jogs there without a ball.\n35:42 Comment: Dombrosio.\n35:43 Comment: Another pass back to Marcel Brozovic.\n35:46 Comment: I wish you Mario.\n35:47 Comment: Candreva.\n35:48 Comment: Inter control the ball well.\n35:51 Comment: Brozovic.\n35:52 Comment: And transmission.\n35:53 Comment: Here Icardi puts the body.\n35:56 Comment: Trying to make a turn in some incredible way.\n35:59 Comment: But it doesn't work.\n36:1 Comment: There, we see a close-up of Medel.\n36:5 Comment: He apparently makes it clear that a replacement is still required.\n36:8 Comment: Very Harry Medel in one of these many joints,\n36:12 Comment: which he had in almost 37 minutes,\n36:16 Comment: Apparently he was injured.\n36:20 Comment: It's a pity for a very important football player.\n36:22 Comment: From the point of view of charisma, yes,\n36:24 Comment: Inter is now losing some leadership qualities.\n36:28 Comment: Yes, it's a loss, it's a problem for Inter.\n36:32 Comment: Harry Medel is a very important football player.\n36:34 Comment: But also Murillo, if we take purely professional qualities,\n36:39 Comment: As a central defender, Murillo is in my opinion,\n36:42 Comment: really a high level player.\n36:45 Comment: Nobel, don’t you remember, yes, what kind of injury Medel had?\n36:48 Comment: After all, he played in the starting lineup from the first to the ninth round.\n36:51 Comment: Occasionally it changed at the end of matches.\n36:55 Comment: And then he was absent due to injuries.\n36:58 Comment: Here he is on the field again, maybe he has had a relapse.\n37:1 Comment:  Quite possible.\n37:2 Comment: Let's show Saldi on the left flank.\n37:4 Comment: Joa Mario.\n37:6 Comment: No, he doesn't knock Joa Mario towards the ball.\n37:8 Comment: Let's note how useful Joa Mario is in today's match.\n37:11 Comment: In general, a football player of a very high level, in my opinion.\n37:14 Comment: And now Joa Mario is also good.\n37:16 Comment: Intercepts the ball in the passing card, although not accurately.\n37:20 Comment: Grozovich is waiting for a partner.\n37:22 Comment: Receives the ball to Andreu.\n37:23 Comment: Maybe a crazy person will carry out a strike.\n37:25 Comment: It's a pass.\n37:27 Comment: The question was, or is Arside in Ikard.\n37:30 Comment: Because he found such a free zone.\n37:36 Comment: And indeed, Arside, apparently, was not here.\n37:39 Comment: Although I’ve become a little more entrenched in my body.\n37:41 Comment: And maybe he was a little closer to the goal in this regard.\n37:43 Comment: Part of the body that can be stuffed than homo.\n37:47 Comment: But we also understand that this is another potentially very acute attack.\n37:52 Comment: Even though I didn’t get a pass from Andreev, I didn’t get a hit.\n37:55 Comment: It turned into a pass.\n37:57 Comment: But this once again shows how strong Inter's attacks really are,\n38:1 Comment: They look great numerically, right?\n38:4 Comment: When even a bad pass turns into a completely good pass.\n38:8 Comment: Breaking the rules.\n38:10 Comment: Fouled.\n38:11 Comment: Miranda.\n38:14 Comment: Well, Miranda and Murillier often played in the center of defense last season.\n38:19 Comment: Therefore, I think there are no problems here in terms of mutual understanding.\n38:24 Comment: Mansaldi.\n38:27 Comment: Mario.\n38:28 Comment: Kondogbia puts the body and Kondogbia keeps the ball.\n38:36 Comment: Kondreva.\n38:37 Comment: Dambrosio.\n38:39 Comment: Dambrosio is connecting well on his right flank today.\n38:42 Comment: Marcello Brozovic.\n38:43 Comment: You know, Nobel, Inter overcomes the midline of the field very quickly.\n38:46 Comment:  Very close.\n38:47 Comment: Catastrophically fast for Milan.\n38:50 Comment: And, in fact, you only manage to slow down your opponent in front of the penalty area.\n38:55 Comment: But if, again, they earn a serve, they earn a long-range strike,\n38:59 Comment: It will be very difficult for Milan.\n39:1 Comment: He needs to take the game beyond the boundaries of the field itself.\n39:5 Comment: This is Abate.\n39:6 Comment: He's accelerating.\n39:7 Comment:  All.\n39:8 Comment: There are no more options.\n39:9 Comment: A mistake again gives Inter a chance to counter-attack.\n39:12 Comment: Move to the left.\n39:13 Comment: Flank.\n39:14 Comment: He can run away from Gomez.\n39:15 Comment:  Runs away.\n39:16 Comment: Trying to serve.\n39:17 Comment: But good, good Gomez.\n39:19 Comment: Yes, here the Paraguayan waited until the end for that moment,\n39:23 Comment: When you can jump in a tackle, and did it very well in due time.\n39:27 Comment: Bonaventure plays Susa short.\n39:29 Comment: Susa.\n39:30 Comment: Two very fast, sharp and playful football players.\n39:33 Comment: In the center there is an option to play around.\n39:35 Comment: He hesitates.\n39:36 Comment: Bonaventure hesitates.\n39:37 Comment: Literally, this ball is on its last legs.\n39:40 Comment: Dashi-Ilyo.\n39:42 Comment: In the center.\n39:43 Comment: This is Milan's answer.\n39:45 Comment: Kick on target.\n39:46 Comment: But Hondanovitch himself is spot on.\n39:48 Comment: The blow was in the center.\n39:49 Comment: Not the most difficult, to put it mildly.\n39:51 Comment: So there's no problem dealing with it.\n39:54 Comment: Today's Nobel is a very interesting confrontation between two goalkeepers of different generations.\n39:59 Comment: But, again, Donoruma is rapidly moving towards acquiring Hondanovic status too.\n40:5 Comment: Because Hondanovic is truly a star.\n40:7 Comment: This is a big goalie.\n40:9 Comment: Who also has a distinctive feature in his goalkeeping skills.\n40:14 Comment: He takes the penalty kick very well.\n40:18 Comment: But so far there is somehow no reason to take a position.\n40:21 Comment:  Yes.\n40:22 Comment:  That's for sure.\n40:23 Comment: By the way, also a moment.\n40:24 Comment: There's not much work to be done inside the penalty area.\n40:27 Comment: Some contacts, penetrations inside the penalty area.\n40:30 Comment: Usually for Inter it's flank serves.\n40:33 Comment: That is, there is already a crowd of central defenders and defensive midfielders.\n40:37 Comment: They are returning inside the penalty area.\n40:39 Comment: And somehow there is no room for maneuver on the Internet.\n40:42 Comment: Miranda.\n40:44 Comment: Brozovic.\n40:47 Comment: Again, pass forward to the feather.\n40:49 Comment: Referee Tagliavento interfered a little in this situation.\n40:51 Comment: The ball hit him in the leg.\n40:52 Comment: Not even a little.\n40:53 Comment: But this attack was essentially interrupted.\n40:55 Comment: Yes, I played for Milan in the derby.\n40:58 Comment: Tagliavento hit.\n41:1 Comment: Lost again.\n41:2 Comment: Let him cough.\n41:3 Comment: Milan, Zhou Mario.\n41:5 Comment: The cult elbows are playing a very weak match so far.\n41:8 Comment: They are literally squeezed into their own penalty area.\n41:12 Comment: They make you make mistakes.\n41:14 Comment: The central one was the defenders of Milan.\n41:15 Comment: But now there's a counterattack.\n41:16 Comment: Nyang.\n41:17 Comment: Nyang is free.\n41:18 Comment: Skip.\n41:20 Comment: Bacca pauses.\n41:21 Comment: And Tagliavento has the ball in his hands.\n41:24 Comment: Yes, it’s not for nothing that Nyang is taking his head in now.\n41:26 Comment: Carlos Bacca essentially deprived Niang of 100% of his scoring chances.\n41:33 Comment: Pass the ball.\n41:35 Comment: Listen, well, it seems like yes.\n41:37 Comment: They both speak Italian for sure.\n41:39 Comment: They can give each other some tips.\n41:42 Comment: But it was obvious that we had to play further.\n41:44 Comment:  And another one.\n41:45 Comment: Yes, Inter's answer.\n41:46 Comment: Blow to Andreev.\n41:47 Comment: But Donorumo can handle it without any problems.\n41:49 Comment: Let's go, let's go at the end of the half.\n41:52 Comment: Milan's quick attack again.\n41:54 Comment: Bonaventure.\n41:55 Comment: There is a partner on the right.\n41:56 Comment: There's a Bacca in the center.\n41:58 Comment: Pass to Suso.\n41:59 Comment: Suso.\n42:0 Comment: Kick, turn.\n42:1 Comment: Goal!\n42:3 Comment: What a goal!\n42:4 Comment: Suso!\n42:7 Comment: That was Suso now.\n42:9 Comment: How wonderfully he shifted under that left leg.\n42:13 Comment: The magic left-hander, which he scored last season for Genoa when he was on loan.\n42:19 Comment: How many goals did he score like that?\n42:21 Comment: But here the situation was the same as sometimes happens in the ring in martial arts.\n42:25 Comment: When both opponents at the end of the round, staggering a little, already forgot about defense.\n42:32 Comment: And every blow, this so-called lucky punch, could send, well, at least a knockdown.\n42:38 Comment: And Suso delivers such a blow.\n42:40 Comment: But what a bonaventure.\n42:41 Comment: We blamed him for this because he didn't make the pass.\n42:44 Comment: And here he just waited for Suso to enter the injury area.\n42:49 Comment: The ball was rolled out to him, and then it was a matter of technique.\n42:53 Comment: Suso.\n42:54 Comment: Put the ball aside, beat Assaldi and shoot into the far corner.\n43:0 Comment: Silver Losconi is pleased.\n43:2 Comment: We had an absolutely amazing outcome in the first half.\n43:6 Comment: Inter, who had the ball more often, who approached the opponent's fourth more often, shot more often and, in principle, had more chances.\n43:14 Comment: Misses a devastating counterattack.\n43:17 Comment: Maybe even playing your own football somewhere.\n43:20 Comment: Perhaps, perhaps Dima.\n43:22 Comment: But in any case, we will answer that two chances arose at the end of the Milan half.\n43:27 Comment: And Milan waited for the moment when they could score.\n43:31 Comment: And in the end Donna Ruma scored.\n43:33 Comment: Hruschke wins the ball.\n43:34 Comment: By the way, no hints yet, but Milan beat Juventus in approximately the same style.\n43:39 Comment: Here a few weeks ago, also defending more, scoring a beautiful goal when Manuel Locotelli scored.\n43:47 Comment: And winning modestly 1-0.\n43:49 Comment: Now, if we take the first half as a whole picture, the scenario is similar.\n43:55 Comment: Maybe, maybe Nobel.\n43:57 Comment: But I think Milan looked better in the game with Juventus.\n43:59 Comment: Here, to a certain extent, an episode, a non-systemic episode, occurred.\n44:5 Comment: This is a counterattack, this is a counterattack.\n44:7 Comment: There were two of them after all.\n44:8 Comment: Karls Bakka had a moment.\n44:10 Comment: Well, yes, yes, where is he, in principle, if he played like Benventura, then the situation might have been different.\n44:16 Comment: Or at least play like Suso.\n44:19 Comment: Get into the right corner.\n44:21 Comment: Perhaps the score would have been 1-0 a little earlier.\n44:23 Comment: But Milan is ahead.\n44:24 Comment: Milan beat Inter 1-0.\n44:28 Comment: And San Siro is buzzing.\n44:30 Comment: Milan Derby\n44:31 Comment: The whole city was talking about him today.\n44:35 Comment: About the main match of Italy.\n44:38 Comment: By the way, you didn't pay attention to who the blow came from.\n44:40 Comment: I think from under Ansaldi, right?\n44:41 Comment: Yes, Ansaldi.\n44:42 Comment: And you see, Ansaldi, you spent a lot of energy helping in the attack.\n44:48 Comment: We still see Avside here.\n44:49 Comment: Although he is desperately waging this fight to the end, the corps is putting up a fight.\n44:53 Comment: By the way, having arranged to be hacked to death with my own aesthetic.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment:  too much\n0:30 Comment: On the left in defense is Desilio No. 2, Mabatha on the right No. 20, central defenders Paletto and Gomez.\n0:35 Comment: The 29th and 15th numbers, respectively, are three central midfielders.\n0:39 Comment: Bonaventura No. 5, Locotelli No. 73, Kutska No. 33.\n0:42 Comment: In attack on the left is Nyang, on the right is Suso.\n0:45 Comment: No. 11 and No. 8, respectively, Carlos Baca, center forward No. 70.\n0:50 Comment: Milan head coach Vincenzo Monteu.\n0:54 Comment: Inter's roster includes Samir Handanovic in goal number 1, then 4 defenders, 33rd Dambrosio.\n1:1 Comment: The 17th was Garry Medel, he played as a central defender, he was replaced.\n1:5 Comment: No. 24 Jessen Murillo came out, and now No. 25 Joa Miranda is acting in conjunction with Murillo.\n1:13 Comment: Playing on the left is No. 15, our good friend from Zarubin and Zenit performances, Christian Ansaldi.\n1:18 Comment: For 3 players in the center of the field, Joa Mario 6th, 7th Marcello Brozovic and 7th Geoffrey Kondagbia.\n1:25 Comment: Attack group, 44th Ivan Peresic, 87th Antonio Condreva and 9th Inter captain Mauro Icardi.\n1:33 Comment: International coach Stefano Pioli, who took charge of the team just recently, literally 10 days ago.\n1:41 Comment: And such a big match, for him the Milan derby is like the opening game.\n1:47 Comment: Milan attacking through the flank, Suso is once again in an offside position, I think for the third time this game.\n1:54 Comment: Suso could have spent the season with another team, he was on loan last year,\n2:2 Comment: He showed himself well in Jena, he distributed and scored, and everyone understood perfectly well that this player was excellent.\n2:9 Comment: But by playing in pre-season tournaments and friendly matches, he proved that he can become one of the main players, and he is now confirming this.\n2:39 Comment: And so, as you see, the Milan international match, in the first half, in terms of the game ahead.\n2:43 Comment: Suglavov's serve, Donnaruma is here, and he is trying to immediately look at someone in front in order to quickly put the ball into play.\n2:50 Comment: He was the author of the pre-goal pass, which Nobel spoke about in the first half, because it was he who dribbled the ball so far with his hand that Bonaventura and Suso ended up right in front of the Inter defense.\n3:1 Comment: Broadwich did not understand him and Cardi, as a result, the pass went the wrong way, and it was Suso who was trying to keep up with him, Kandagbia did not succeed, Suso got into the ball and earned a free kick, Amsaldi fouled.\n3:15 Comment: There were three yellow cards in the first half, Kandagbia for Inter, Milan Kutska and Dashelli, and now there is another warning.\n3:22 Comment: You know, Nobel, a funny episode, I’m talking about the reaction of the assistant referee Tel-Yavento, because he raised his flag, signaling a foul, after the main referee blew the whistle.\n3:36 Comment: Well, it seems like solidarity with him.\n3:39 Comment: Here we see, attention, Amsaldi fouled with his hand, this is the story, because he didn’t touch Suso with his foot, in fact he fouled his elbows.\n3:49 Comment: Yes, this also happens, the referee of today's match is Paolo Tel-Iavento, this is Silvia Berlusconi and Adriano Galiani, and these are the new Chinese investors of Inter along with Javier Zanetti, the vice-president of the club.\n4:2 Comment: A little about the referees, more precisely the chief referee Paolo Tel-Iavento, assistants Elinito Di Libertatore and Lorenzo Magnanelli, reserve Marco Barbirati, that's how the name sounds correctly.\n4:16 Comment: Almost for tongue twisters, the fight, today the teams are somehow weak with set pieces, the serve is not going well, but here’s another moment, and Ricochet almost turned it in, this was not the most successful shot at the meeting.\n4:30 Comment: The rebound was clearly in favor of Milan, and the ball almost flew into the goal, we watch the replay from this camera, it would have been really close to score in this match.\n4:44 Comment: But it seems to me that this alternative replay made it clear that D’Ambrosio was clearly in the line of fire and quite confidently put the ball in the direction. Well, okay, the sixth corner, six corners for Inter, and what happens is the first serve was Milan's from the corner?\n5:5 Comment: Yes, this is true, because indeed Milan practically did not attack from the point of view of the flanks in the first half.\n5:14 Comment: By the way, this is also attacking activity that reflects, demonstrates, characterizes, and here he makes a mistake.\n5:22 Comment: Kondogmeya made a mistake, Kutska is waiting for Nyangen, Jagd runs into the penalty area, a cross or a shot is not entirely clear, but Handanovic’s result with the ball quickly puts him into play, and Joao Mario turned around.\n5:32 Comment: There is Kondreva alone, Kondreva receives the ball, runs into free space, Kondreva can shoot or make a pass, Kondreva hits the turn, Maidonna Ruba!\n5:43 Comment: You know, it seems to me that in this situation the flight was completely wrong, he was the first from this line to jump out to Kondreva, I carefully watched his actions, and in fact, since you made this movement, you have a safety net, Deshilu was nearby, so Meet you closer.\n6:0 Comment: As a result, he somehow froze in half position and allowed Kondreva to shoot, and Nobel and I already talked about the strength and accuracy of Antonio’s shot sometimes, he demonstrated this more than once while playing for Latso, by the way, Stefan Pieli in that number.\n6:14 Comment: Bonaventura with the ball, meets in the center, there is Suso, but Bonaventura chooses the option with Carlos Bacca, Bacca clings to the ball, Bonaventura, dangerous moment, why not pass to Suso again?\n6:25 Comment: It’s true that the ball still seems to bounce back to Suso, as if Suso will hit the turn kick on purpose this time.\n6:34 Comment: Exactly the same maneuver, here my partners also helped, because they drew the attention of their opponents, the blow didn’t work.\n6:42 Comment: Kiski Honda, in the frame, this is Edar, but in general, by the way, about the reserve, that we didn’t tell one or the other team, we’re correcting ourselves.\n6:50 Comment: Milan has in reserve the goalkeeper Gabriel and the goalkeeper the already young Plizari, defenders Eli, Zapata, Antone Lem, who has returned from injury, midfielders Fernandez, Poli, Sosa, Pashelic and forwards Honda, Adriano and Lopodulo.\n7:10 Comment: Well, Lopodulo is an option for the ending, probably.\n7:14 Comment: What a shot! What a goal! Goal, goal, goal! Antonio Condreva! We warned Antonio Condreva that he could shoot the way he can.\n7:27 Comment: Exactly one and a half to two minutes ago we booked the uncertain and indecisive Palet for not meeting Kondreva.\n7:35 Comment: Kondreva unsheathed his cannon and took aim, shooting. Well, here again he won’t meet anyone on his way, he hits as it should. 1-1.\n7:47 Comment: Wow, how Kondreva scored! Wow, how Antonio Kondreva scored! The Italian national team player got into the very top nine.\n7:57 Comment: Look again, there was no violation of the rules here, as Tolya Venton believes.\n8:4 Comment: Inter quickly put the ball into play, Kondreva handled the ball with one touch and hit the ball with the second!\n8:9 Comment: Well, what were Kutska and Homer doing here? What were they doing here? There was a lack of any mutual understanding between the young defender and the fairly experienced hubback.\n8:20 Comment: Kutska stood, watched this whole picture with the remote control in his hand, and Brutus seemed to make, I don’t know, louder.\n8:30 Comment: In general, it’s like in front of some kind of home theater and I didn’t enter into combat at all.\n8:37 Comment: In general, that is, if they let us watch the replay again, concentrate your attention on Kutska.\n8:43 Comment: Homer was nearby, he glanced at Kutska, not understanding whether he should try to meet the batter, or whether the supporting hubback would do it.\n8:53 Comment: As a result, both positions were taken incorrectly, Kondreva shot without any interference.\n8:57 Comment: Let's note that the Milan players made claims to Tagliavento, the match referee, because they believed that there was a foul on Locotelli, after which...\n9:7 Comment: Listen, well, these are Milan’s problems, these are Milan’s problems, because they allowed some kind of lack of concentration, argued a lot and ended up getting it.\n9:15 Comment: 1-1. Well, we waited with Nobel Golov, we waited.\n9:20 Comment: Suso, serve and carti plays dolovoy. Let's note that in the previous Milan derby, last season, Milan beat Inter, also the future host, Nobel with a score of 3-0.\n9:32 Comment: Then Roberto Mancini's team defeated Milan.\n9:38 Comment: Today both our shots turned out to be very beautiful goals. As I understand it, Suso had already entered the penalty when he hit, in my opinion, from outside the limit.\n9:47 Comment: Both shots from a distance, beautiful, both from players who know how to hit.\n9:56 Comment: And it’s all the more surprising that Suso delivered a blow practically without any problems, especially Contreva.\n10:5 Comment: Abata throws the ball wide, it's a free kick, there's a fight here, the rebound should be up to the players.\n10:10 Comment: Well, basically a competition, some kind of another golden galosh for the worst blow of the season.\n10:20 Comment: Palette player.\n10:22 Comment: The ball goes into play from the Inter side, I think that Inter, of course, is now inspired, the team understands that, in principle, in this match we can count on victory, apparently, at least everything is in favor at the beginning of the second half International.\n10:40 Comment: I'm still affected by Paleta's blow.\n10:44 Comment: In principle, he could, of course, depict some kind of mise-en-scene, make it clear that maybe he had such a pass.\n10:49 Comment: But Inter is attacking, Palet is already in his place in the center of defense.\n10:53 Comment: Perekvat, nanny, he rarely met the ball in the second half, he made noise several times at the beginning, he fought with Medel, who is no longer on the field, and then somehow concentrated more and more on defense.\n11:9 Comment: Nyanka enters the fight, loses the ball, Marcela Brozovic on the right flank, Juamario, dangerous moment, maybe Juamario is good, shoot, but the shot didn’t work.\n11:22 Comment: I took out Locotelli’s Portuguese on his swing, but the shot didn’t turn out the way I probably would have liked.\n11:28 Comment: Maybe we will see a repeat of this episode, Palet played very well positionally, he did not throw himself out, although in this situation a blow was already inevitable, maybe one of the less experienced would have made a tackle, and Palet, in fact, took This position, covering the near corner as much as possible, ultimately took the blow.\n11:48 Comment: This defender is a good one, he also spent the previous season not in Milan, on loan, but this season he is, of course, the main player.\n12:19 Comment:  Milan's luxurious counterattack through the right edge, they played again, again lost those they should have kept. As a result, Susa takes the free kick, without any supervision, they did not have time to secure, in my opinion, Miranda, who, also in football slang, simply section here Susa.\n12:40 Comment: How easily he escaped from the defender.\n12:42 Comment: Easy and not forced, it’s also right-footed, Susa’s left-handedness is pronounced, but here you just had to roll, just roll the ball into the far corner, that’s what the Spaniard did, brilliant technique, another 2-1.\n12:57 Comment: Well, a great fellow here, of course, is Carlos Bacca, who opened correctly and returned the ball to Sousa in a timely manner. In fact, two Milan players outplayed the entire Inter defense in a matter of seconds.\n13:9 Comment: And you say that the Milan derbies have been boring in recent years.\n13:13 Comment:  Well...\n13:14 Comment: Of course not, this kind of football, this kind of poster will never die.\n13:18 Comment: Milan-Inter, 2-1, this is only the very middle of the second half, the very heat of the match, another half hour of great Italian football on Match TV.\n13:29 Comment: A completely unique game, it is unique in that it began with its broadcast on one channel, and ends on two at once.\n13:39 Comment: Well, for the rest, of course, Inter, which has an advantage, seems to be about to score, yes, that was the case in the first half.\n13:47 Comment: And now he put pressure, yes, Mario had a moment, but he gets his goal.\n13:52 Comment: Another Inter attack, Peresic at the far post, the match can continue here.\n13:57 Comment: For some reason, Cardi did not run to the right midfielder's area, and in the end Milan fought back.\n14:7 Comment: Perhaps Nobel will agree that this is a rare Italian match where emotions prevail over understanding of the game situation, over cold-bloodedness, over tactics, maybe, yes.\n14:16 Comment: Yes, especially Inter. Still, if Milan still sticks to its game plan, in my opinion, Inter has some problems with this.\n14:25 Comment: Peresic! There could have been a good pass, but here Locotelli has a mustache and is a violation of the rules.\n14:32 Comment: Of course, breaking the rules, no doubt, here is right, this is left.\n14:37 Comment: And you know, of course, Susa will probably perform as a great master of large, not so big, theaters here, if he did it on purpose, that is, he is calling for help.\n14:48 Comment: Because now is the moment when a pause in the game is needed, first of all Milan.\n14:52 Comment: This game has gone without a middle ground, essentially an attack on an attack, and here there is a high risk of missing the return ball while the hotheads are still hot.\n15:4 Comment: And then Susa gives this game a pause, an opportunity for her partners, perhaps, to take a little break, to digest everything that happened.\n15:14 Comment: Masaldim, strike forward.\n15:19 Comment: The cross plays great on the second floor of Locotelli, he makes another discount, but this is a discount for Brozovic.\n15:24 Comment: The Horvat passes to the right to de Ambrosio, de Ambrosio is an offer from Kondreeva, Kondreeva has good diagonals, but he plays on the edge.\n15:33 Comment: De Ambrosio serves, Donaruma catches the ball, once again, by the way, not on the first try, but in any case, he is the winner of this micro-episode.\n15:42 Comment: And again Donaruma quickly played the ball to Bonamentura, Baka to Kutska, Slovak.\n15:48 Comment: We need a continuation to the right flag, of course, Suso, Suso penalty kick, Suso moves, but in the second he couldn’t stand it anymore, Amario returned.\n15:57 Comment: Good, but here it’s already a loss, and in a simple situation.\n16:2 Comment: You were talking about Milan's reserves, let's talk about Minter, let's say, especially since it seems to me that Jay Peresic is already, in a good way, in quotes, a replacement for the job.\n16:11 Comment: Well, why not, why not tell me, there is goalkeeper Corison, there are defenders Ranokya, Santon, Nago Thomas, all experienced guys who were the main defenders of Inter in different seasons.\n16:23 Comment: Midfielders Melo, Bonego, Newturi, strikers Jovicic, Bebyani, Eder and Gabriel, well, in general, a lot of options.\n16:32 Comment: Here you have Eder, who started the season as the main player in the attack, Bebyani for the flank attack, Jovicic, in general a star.\n16:40 Comment: Of course, Gabriel Barbosa, Gaby Gou, who Inter bought for 30 million euros in August, is one of the main talents in Brazil, but so far he has hardly played for Inter.\n16:51 Comment: Well, plus there is Ever Bonego, whom you already mentioned, Bonego is a great master, he knows how to make a difference, as they say in Italy.\n16:58 Comment: You know, this is exactly what I would probably have stopped at if I had guessed who Stefano Pioli would be the first to hit the field.\n17:8 Comment: This is a new coach, we say this again, that this season 4 people were led by Inter this year.\n17:17 Comment: In an amazing situation, Mancini prepared the team, Deboer worked with it for most of the season.\n17:23 Comment: Then for some time Stefano Vecchi was the acting head coach, and here you have Pioli, who worked in many Italian teams, but was mainly remembered for his work with Boloni and Lazo.\n17:39 Comment: Joe Mario moves into the center and makes a good pass into the penalty area over Ambrosio, but Ambrosio simply couldn't win the fight.\n17:50 Comment: Tomorrow, in my opinion, I played into my hands a little.\n17:53 Comment: Let's see.\n17:55 Comment: Yeah, oh well.\n17:58 Comment: They show us Jovicic and, you know, I remember the words of Walter Tzenge, who played for Inter for more than 15 years.\n18:7 Comment: He gave an interview, I think, from major Italian publications before the match, and talked about how the Inter team is incomprehensible, it is unclear what it is capable of in each next match.\n18:18 Comment: Well, he would have bet on Majovic, that footballer, as you already said, yes, a very precise definition, that footballer who can make a difference in episodes.\n18:28 Comment: Today Milan has such a player, this is Suso.\n18:31 Comment: Suso is good, Suso really plays the most important role for Milan today, and that's Vincenzo Mantello.\n18:38 Comment: I have already said that indeed Silveo Berlusconi essentially refers to his latest decisions as president of Milan, although he is still.\n18:48 Comment: Mantello was invited, and now many Milan fans are just worried about whether it is the right step to sell Milan to Chinese investors, whether this is the right decision.\n19:0 Comment: Many people even hope in their hearts that Silveo Berlusconi will change his mind, although this is very, very unlikely.\n19:5 Comment: Let's tell the viewers, yes, those who tuned into this broadcast, that there was a luxurious banner today on the podium of Milan fans.\n19:13 Comment: This is a picture of Berlusconi with the huge number of trophies he won during his long years of leadership for 30 years.\n19:18 Comment: 5 European Cups, 5 European Cups, the most famous football president in history.\n19:23 Comment: And this derby may be the last for the current Milan leaders Adriano Galliani and Silveo Berlusconi, who took power at the club when many of Milan's current fans were not yet born.\n19:36 Comment: Why, in 1986, Nobel Stalin and Dmitry Shnaiken were not yet born.\n19:40 Comment: Yes, we’re not talking about the fact that, for example, Donna Ruma’s parents probably didn’t know each other under the tree, who was born in 1999.\n19:50 Comment: It may very well be.\n19:53 Comment: Ansaldi, he leaves the field, in fact, the functions of the players are similar, both full-backs, who regularly join the attack, make crosses under this.\n20:3 Comment: I think the important point here is that Ansaldi has a yellow card.\n20:6 Comment: There are a lot of attacks through his flank, he has Suso on his flank, who is obviously in great shape.\n20:12 Comment: Let's call it our own, it's just that Suso was harassing Ansaldi on that flank and that's why Christian is inconsolable as he leaves the field.\n20:23 Comment: Actually, he scored one goal from under him, and the second scoring attack came from his zone.\n20:29 Comment: Well, coming back, closing the topic of Chinese investors, Milan clubs, Inter already has Chinese owners, the Sunny company, who are ready to invest and are already investing.\n20:38 Comment: EUR 100 million was spent on transfers in the summer.\n20:41 Comment: Recently there was information from a fairly authoritative publication in Italy, Carriera.spot, that the Chinese owners are ready, attention, friends, to pay 50 million euros, no, for the football player, a penalty to Athletic Madrid, so that Diego Semena will lead the team in the summer, in the coming year.\n20:59 Comment: This will be a unique transfer.\n21:0 Comment: I am sure that sooner or later Semyon will lead Inter, the question is when.\n21:7 Comment: The Chinese are ready to play ahead of schedule and invite Semyon next summer.\n21:15 Comment: Well, this will be a powerful step.\n21:17 Comment: We’ll see, but as for Milan, the company is Chinese, they’ll come a little later, for now let’s attack.\n21:23 Comment: Let's see, step over on the left flank.\n21:25 Comment: Eagle handles the ball, here Kutska again can’t keep up with him.\n21:29 Comment: Kutska again does not work at the highest speeds.\n21:33 Comment: I think he's doing better.\n21:36 Comment: Wow, what a shot, wow, what a volley, cross over, again a moment for Horvat, but here he was already close to a goal.\n21:43 Comment: It seems to me that Donna Ruma blocked the far corner in this jump, although again, when the ball bounces off the lawn, there is always an unpredictable trajectory.\n21:52 Comment: Sometimes the ball can just go over the goalkeeper's hand.\n21:58 Comment: Well, let's note the quality of the crosser, who struck with a turn, hit, the ball turned around.\n22:2 Comment: Well, pass, pass the scoop there.\n22:5 Comment: The borscht was poured into the goalkeeper’s room, in fact, but it was almost there from the goalkeeper’s.\n22:9 Comment: Kutska wins the fight, he made a great pass to Baku, Baka is constantly under pressure, but he already made an effective pass today.\n22:16 Comment: Susu meets his opponent, then Locotelli makes a magnificent tackle and a counterattack begins.\n22:23 Comment: Young takes the ball, but here he has a long stride, he can try to run away.\n22:27 Comment: Yang may be right in this situation, we need to give a little pause, but at least this way.\n22:33 Comment: At least this way, from his article he is more likely not so much a football player as a high jumper, but here he is fighting for these balls.\n22:40 Comment: Kandreeva finally moved to the middle of the field, again, giving space.\n22:47 Comment: Dambrosio is on the flank.\n22:49 Comment: This is Marcello Brozovic, pass on the crossroads, another try for Ivan, Zhou Mario.\n22:56 Comment: Free kick, ricochet, but here Donna Ruma takes the ball without any problems.\n23:1 Comment: Let me remind you that John Luigi, Donna Ruma, the future is possible for all European football, certainly Italy, we are just friends.\n23:9 Comment: He is only 17 years old. On February 25 next year he will be 18, for now he is playing in the Milan derby, he is an Italian national team player at 17 years old.\n23:20 Comment: Well, everyone, of course, compares him with Bufon and these rumors have intensified again, talk about Donna Ruma’s possible transfer to Juvetos, but it will be a big failure for Milana if such a thing is in the arteriadon.\n23:34 Comment: Inter, attack and Cardi, the shot doesn't work and, the most curious thing, there was no attack.\n23:40 Comment: There was no offside and Mauro Icardi simply missed the ball.\n23:45 Comment: One of the most formidable guards in European football, here he escaped on the attack, as it seemed, although he was slightly longer than Gomez's legs.\n23:55 Comment: But, in any case, the referee decided that there was no offside and simply did not hit the ball properly on Mauro Icardi.\n24:4 Comment: I would even say that this line was as straight as Gomez's legs.\n24:8 Comment: In general, she fell over a little.\n24:12 Comment: In any case, the game continues, Abbatem deftly makes a transfer to the opposite flank.\n24:17 Comment: Here Dashi Yo works a little less often on the attack, but he has serious rivals on the sideline.\n24:24 Comment: Kucka handles the ball poorly and loses it.\n24:27 Comment: Kutska immediately switches out of the fight.\n24:29 Comment: Panura will come back.\n24:31 Comment: Inter have an advantage here on the flank.\n24:35 Comment: Cross over.\n24:37 Comment: One more serve.\n24:38 Comment: A full split second is missing.\n24:42 Comment: Now Locotelli has covered this blow.\n24:45 Comment: And this is Locotelli and his wonderful technique.\n24:48 Comment: 18 years old. Another young and well-mannered freelancer is Manuel Locotelli, who has already scored 2 goals in the Italian series in this championship.\n24:54 Comment: Plays as a supporting hohback, conductor from Armwrestlock.\n24:59 Comment: Plays a position, let's say, and you know, I didn't consider much here.\n25:3 Comment: No, still bang.\n25:4 Comment: Listen, today I just have a mountain of complaints about Kutska.\n25:8 Comment: Again, how he shows himself in some episodes.\n25:11 Comment: Well, that’s basically having character, right?\n25:14 Comment: Some episode didn’t work out for you, playing to the end, the bahu is booed.\n25:19 Comment: He has a difficult relationship with Milan.\n25:22 Comment: They say he wants to leave the team.\n25:24 Comment: At the same time, he himself seems to be publicly in love with Milan.\n25:28 Comment: But his agents, his representatives are actively working on the transfer.\n25:31 Comment: Perhaps he'll leave the team in the winter.\n25:33 Comment: Well, instead of the bang, it was actually mother-father Fernandez who appeared on the field.\n25:37 Comment: Free kick serve.\n25:39 Comment: Murilem jumps out.\n25:41 Comment: Yes, a very interesting situation about the Baja.\n25:43 Comment: We already talked about the fact that he had a streak of 334 minutes without goals.\n25:46 Comment: The Italian Championship now has 400 minutes.\n25:49 Comment: And if we take more matches for the Colombian national team,\n25:53 Comment: where, by the way, he basically lost his place in the lineup,\n25:55 Comment: There is now Radamal Falcao at the base,\n25:57 Comment: This is already the ninth match without goals.\n25:59 Comment: The bombardier baja gets by.\n26:1 Comment: And this is, of course, a test for him.\n26:4 Comment: He loves these heads very much and says it himself,\n26:6 Comment: that even a victory without goals from the attackers -\n26:9 Comment: It's like an incomplete victory.\n26:12 Comment: And I'm always upset if I don't shoot down.\n26:14 Comment: We'll see what happens to Baja, what happens to Milan.\n26:17 Comment: I once started a topic about new Chinese investors,\n26:19 Comment: who are willing to spend.\n26:21 Comment: And now Frances Montello not only earns points in the piggy bank,\n26:24 Comment: to the series table, but also to your piggy bank,\n26:26 Comment: because, naturally, you need to show the product with your face.\n26:29 Comment: The new owner, it is clear who will be the director of Inter,\n26:32 Comment: This will be Mr. Fasone, who, by the way, again...\n26:35 Comment: Worked at Inter, right?\n26:37 Comment: Yes, knowing the status of the derby, Fasone worked at Inter\n26:39 Comment: And with Inter as director of the Champions League he won.\n26:41 Comment: Now he comes to Milan to lead the team,\n26:44 Comment: Chinese new investors hired him.\n26:47 Comment: Well, as they promise, again, the Chinese,\n26:50 Comment: They will invest in the team, including the squad.\n26:53 Comment: Well, we see that Milan, of course,\n26:54 Comment: including the composition.\n26:56 Comment: But we see that there are still those players,\n26:59 Comment: on which a new team can be built,\n27:2 Comment: This also applies to young players, this also applies to Bonaventure,\n27:5 Comment: who now dragged the ball through several lines of Inter's defense,\n27:10 Comment: And this is a penalty that can, in fact, be taken by Bonaventura himself.\n27:14 Comment: It’s unlikely to break through Utsk here.\n27:18 Comment: Well, Suso, since the game is on...\n27:20 Comment: Suso still has these, you know, rather dribbling blows\n27:22 Comment: from a closer distance to the gate, but there are options.\n27:27 Comment: I'm betting on Bonaventure.\n27:30 Comment: It's likely, it's likely that he'll be the one to punch,\n27:33 Comment: At least that's where everything is going.\n27:37 Comment: Giacomo Bonaventura, and Fernandez next door.\n27:40 Comment: By the way, we play in Ferentin, Fernandez regularly...\n27:43 Comment: Oh, yes, yes, I completely forgot.\n27:45 Comment: Matis Fernandez is already on the field,\n27:47 Comment: And he scored quite a lot of free kicks.\n27:49 Comment: Indeed, it is true.\n27:52 Comment: I remembered the mobile in time.\n27:55 Comment: But it feels like Kutka is in a fighting position.\n28:4 Comment: Well, here's the blow, which, as I see it...\n28:7 Comment: He'll braid it better that way.\n28:9 Comment: Characterizes today's game.\n28:11 Comment: Well, again, I somehow stuck to him, I criticize everything,\n28:13 Comment: But the team wins it.\n28:15 Comment: But still, he somehow didn’t finish the game in several episodes.\n28:17 Comment: Ready.\n28:19 Comment: Meanwhile, Inter is preparing a replacement.\n28:21 Comment: If I'm not mistaken, Stefan Jovicic is number 10.\n28:24 Comment: Dima has already spoken about him.\n28:26 Comment: A Montenegrin striker should appear on the field.\n28:29 Comment: By the way, he played in England for Manchester City,\n28:32 Comment: but the main part of my career, let's say,\n28:36 Comment: I achieved success in Italy, playing for Ferentina.\n28:40 Comment: For Ferentina, Mencenza Montello.\n28:42 Comment: And the Italian press got hold of a fact here,\n28:44 Comment: that Montello and Jovicic allegedly had dinner.\n28:47 Comment: Well, again, it may not have been so much a dinner between two old acquaintances,\n28:51 Comment: This may have been a meeting of long-time partners and future partners.\n28:55 Comment: The first one is older, because Milan is a city with a lot of delicious restaurants.\n28:59 Comment: I'm thinking about maybe spending the evening having some great pasta or pizza –\n29:5 Comment: It's not that criminal, especially since you talked about it,\n29:8 Comment: that these are not the sworn enemies of Milan Inter,\n29:10 Comment: These are, in principle, cousins, cousins, let's put it this way,\n29:12 Comment: because very often in the history of Milan derbies, team players were friends with each other.\n29:18 Comment: It's hard to imagine something like this.\n29:20 Comment: Even brothers played relatives in the lineups of Montello's dinner.\n29:23 Comment: Yes, it’s hard to imagine something like this, for example, in Turin, where there is a Turin derby,\n29:28 Comment: In Rome, even more so, but in Milan this is quite possible.\n29:32 Comment: Montello Morozovich leaves the field, Jovicic replaces him,\n29:35 Comment: and look, he changes Yoli Habeka and releases the striker.\n29:39 Comment: Well, yes, yes, we see that it has always been like this.\n29:43 Comment: There are enough Balkan footballers in Italy in general and Inter in particular,\n29:47 Comment: They make the weather here.\n29:49 Comment: And Jovicic immediately joins the game, passing to Kondagbia,\n29:53 Comment: There is the right option, but it plays narrowly, but not narrow-mindedly.\n29:57 Comment: Kondagbia, because the direction was quite good.\n30:1 Comment: The ball goes out of bounds all the way to the end again.\n30:4 Comment: Meeting about 15 minutes, on the end of the ball.\n30:7 Comment: Meet about 15 minutes, at Gatomo.\n30:10 Comment: Japanese legionnaire.\n30:12 Comment: There are few shots on target, you must admit, Don Naruma is today,\n30:16 Comment: Well, let's just say, not without mistakes.\n30:18 Comment: In the first half, he made several mistakes when kicking the ball into play.\n30:23 Comment: Well, he regularly catches balls, as if not fixing it on the first try,\n30:29 Comment: And on top of that, one shot from outside the penalty area has already reached the target.\n30:32 Comment: D'Ambrosio in the center plays on Joao Mario,\n30:37 Comment: Whatever Beresevich comes up with, a shot and a corner rebound.\n30:42 Comment: No, Don Naruma gets the ball, but he even plays...\n30:44 Comment: No, Don Naruma! Don Naruma!\n30:49 Comment: Luxurious episode.\n30:51 Comment: In this situation, he made the jump and calculated, let’s say, his sliding and friction.\n30:58 Comment: Because it’s clear that his body will be skidding here, yes, well, on spikes, probably.\n31:4 Comment: Look how he kept it here.\n31:7 Comment: The ball is within the penalty area, otherwise we would be in trouble.\n31:11 Comment: The most important thing is that he wasn't scared.\n31:13 Comment: He wasn't afraid to step forward and eventually take the ball.\n31:17 Comment: But, on the other hand, I’ll say again, Nobel didn’t do it on the first try, yes, he caught the ball, at first it somehow went to the side and took it away.\n31:23 Comment: But either way, he's the winner of this episode.\n31:25 Comment:  Undoubtedly.\n31:27 Comment: Khudskaya Kondogbia, violation of the rules. So far Milan is ahead.\n31:30 Comment: 2-1. It's a derby, it's an important match, but for Milan it's still an important match in the table.\n31:34 Comment: Today Roma lost to Atalanta.\n31:37 Comment: And now, if Milan wins, Milan will move into clear second place, with Luciano-Spolitte's team ahead.\n31:44 Comment: From Milan, which in recent seasons, again, has been unable to gain any serious Eurocup momentum.\n31:51 Comment: Milan hasn’t played in the European Cup for a long time, they’re waiting for it.\n31:54 Comment: Nobody is demanding a championship this season.\n31:57 Comment: That's why they are liberated, they can attack, counter-attack, like Bonamenture is now.\n32:1 Comment: He wants to catch his opponent with this movement again, right?\n32:5 Comment: As if to show that he is making a pass, he throws the ball.\n32:10 Comment: Now he's forcing Jovicic to foul.\n32:13 Comment: Yes, Jovicic gets a yellow card.\n32:16 Comment: The Montenegrin striker, the first thing he did when he entered the field, was a warning.\n32:20 Comment: In principle, it’s not in vain, right?\n32:23 Comment: What's the story here, Nobel?\n32:25 Comment: What's the story, Nobel?\n32:27 Comment: We're talking about the fact that there is 17-year-old Don Naruma, 18-year-old Locotelli, Romanyuli is not there yet today, too, right?\n32:34 Comment: For a complete bunch of 21 year olds.\n32:36 Comment: But, in general, Milan has a young squad.\n32:39 Comment: On average, this cast is 25 years and 227 days old.\n32:44 Comment: This is the youngest squad in Serie A.\n32:47 Comment: Therefore, since they are young, perhaps they will have more strength left for the end.\n32:51 Comment: Plus, the newspaper Della Sport calculated that the players who sent their national teams to Peoli played 186 more minutes in their games for the various national teams.\n33:4 Comment: That's why we were probably a little more tired.\n33:6 Comment: Abbate throws from the side.\n33:9 Comment: Yes, you're right, Milan's team is young, so, of course, Milan is a promising team.\n33:14 Comment: Substitution! Substitution for Milan.\n33:16 Comment: Replacement for Milan.\n33:18 Comment: Ian, who spent a little time, yes, as a central striker, instead of Bakka, who left the field.\n33:25 Comment: He also gave a lot of effort.\n33:27 Comment: And Lapadulla appears on the field.\n33:29 Comment: Serie B's top scorer last season.\n33:32 Comment: And look at the fans, huh?\n33:34 Comment: Yes, yes, yes. Milan is preparing to become Chinese.\n33:36 Comment: Well, this is Gianluca Lapadulla, the top scorer of the Italian Serie B.\n33:41 Comment: At the last championship of the Italian second division.\n33:44 Comment: He played for Kiskar's team.\n33:46 Comment: Well, now the Milan player has scored.\n33:49 Comment: Yes, yes, in the last round of Palermo, and as a heel, it was very beautiful.\n33:53 Comment: Definitely, when the game ends, if anyone hasn't seen it, well, find this video somewhere.\n33:58 Comment: For example, on the website match.tv.ru.\n34:0 Comment: Lapadulla did it very beautifully.\n34:2 Comment: It's a pity that he's playing in the thermobil today.\n34:4 Comment: We cannot see his luxurious, highly-titulated hands.\n34:9 Comment: Yes, Gianluca Lapadulla now proudly wears number nine.\n34:14 Comment: Well, the room is special for Milan.\n34:16 Comment: Remember who played this number in Milan?\n34:18 Comment: Quilippo Inzaghi, Marco Van Basten, of course, the greatest Marco Van Basten.\n34:22 Comment: Now I can only dream about it.\n34:25 Comment: But perhaps Milan's best is yet to come.\n34:29 Comment: A new era of Milan begins, the history of Milan with a Chinese accent.\n34:34 Comment: We'll see what happens.\n34:35 Comment: For that matter, then seven is also magical.\n34:39 Comment: Seven Shevchenko, today Luis Adrian is in Milan.\n34:43 Comment: By the way, they say that he can become a CSKA player.\n34:46 Comment:  But that is another story.\n34:48 Comment: Adrian is on the bench, and those on the field are belligerently defending themselves from Inter's attacks,\n34:53 Comment: Who, it seems to me, has lost this thread of the game.\n34:55 Comment: The ball stayed well, it went from flank to flank.\n34:58 Comment: Now Milan manages to break up these positional attacks of Inter in micro-episodes.\n35:5 Comment: Yes, it turns out, I think Inter now needs to speed up.\n35:12 Comment: There's not much time left, it's not much 10 minutes before the end of the game.\n35:16 Comment: So I argued with my colleague Rustamyan in the first half about this,\n35:19 Comment: Is this match for Milan similar to the one he played with Juventus.\n35:23 Comment: But now you'll probably admit that you're right.\n35:25 Comment: After all, Milan is now doing exactly the same thing on the field that they did in the second half of the game with Juventus.\n35:30 Comment: Let's see if Inter, unlike Juventus, can score.\n35:33 Comment: Another goal in the end. Naked on the left flank.\n35:37 Comment: There are partners in the insurance area. Naked plays short with João Mario.\n35:42 Comment: The Portuguese plays a very important role. Pasmut when it's offside. Or not?\n35:46 Comment: Everything, of course, is offside for Yuven. This was clear even from the Astanta television center.\n35:51 Comment: Venchan Samantela, the head coach of Milan, has his first Milan derby today.\n35:56 Comment: But it is also estimated that he looks great in the derby, he looked great as a player and as a coach.\n36:1 Comment: After all, he played for Roma, for Samduria. He was a great striker.\n36:7 Comment: And he scored 10 goals in 10 derbies. And as a coach, he played in 3 derbies.\n36:15 Comment: And he won two of them. So he knows how to prepare for these special matches.\n36:21 Comment: How to prepare your players for these matches.\n36:24 Comment: Yes, he understands the taste of derby and the importance of such matches.\n36:27 Comment: Miranda on Murillo. Murillo plays wider. Here Mario helps start these attacks.\n36:35 Comment: European champion as part of the Portuguese national team. Indeed, Nobel is right.\n36:39 Comment: In terms of composition, at least Inter is not inferior. In terms of status, in terms of names.\n36:44 Comment: To the squad that was assembled at Milan. But the game showed everything.\n36:48 Comment: Win, win. I'm sure Inter's squad is stronger than Milan's at the moment.\n36:53 Comment: There are still questions about Icardi. He just met with him for a short time.\n36:59 Comment: Icardi has never scored against Milan. That’s the story. Although it seems like he’s already played a lot of matches.\n37:6 Comment: In general, Icardi is a great football player in all respects.\n37:9 Comment: Hjevicic passed to the right flank. Candreva. Icardi's serve here Gomez.\n37:16 Comment: Kondakvia plays with his head. We can, we can, we can continue the match.\n37:19 Comment: Kondakvia took advantage of his data. He took the ball away from Kutska.\n37:24 Comment: But now Kutska is correcting herself. Clever girl. And a counterattack went through Lopodula.\n37:29 Comment: He puts his body down. Fresh legs. Well, of course he wanted to earn a fall here.\n37:34 Comment: But to the end in breakdancing mode. Well, that's the kind of dance.\n37:39 Comment: Or, if you like, a hopaka. He dances and somehow clings to the ball.\n37:44 Comment: But nothing meaningful can be seen from this.\n37:46 Comment: Here Lopodula is just stalling for time with these attacks.\n37:51 Comment: Mario. Good pass to the left flank. Cross over. One on one.\n37:59 Comment: And a good cross. A wonderful cross from Icardi. You just had to put your foot out.\n38:5 Comment: Well, I think he’s somehow happily kissing this Donnaruma ball right now.\n38:10 Comment: If you remember again how it was within the framework.\n38:12 Comment: If you remember that very match with Juventus. Yes, Locotelli scored an incredible goal.\n38:17 Comment: Sending the ball to the top nine. With a powerful blow.\n38:22 Comment: But Vitti Donnaruma pulled the ball in the last seconds, which was also heading into the top corner.\n38:29 Comment: And he also became such a full-fledged hero.\n38:32 Comment: And it's very good here too.\n38:34 Comment: And we see that in the end he maintains his concentration.\n38:38 Comment: This is an important moment. Kondreva on Kandagbia. The Frenchman with the ball.\n38:43 Comment: Pass to Nagotoma. Nagotoma makes it in time. The ball was handled by the Japanese.\n38:48 Comment: What's next? Again to Kandagbia. Will Kandagbia break through? No.\n38:52 Comment: Pass into the penalty area. Icardi. Cross over.\n38:56 Comment: Icardi. Cross over.\n38:58 Comment: Again at Kandagbia. Will Kandagbia break through? No.\n39:2 Comment: Pass into the penalty area. Icardi. Cross over.\n39:5 Comment: Naked again with the ball.\n39:8 Comment: Japanese. Dangerous moment. But the body will never reach the point of impact.\n39:12 Comment: Icardi is blocking the air here. The best scorer is for the Inter captain.\n39:18 Comment: Although he has contributed to 13 of Inter's 18 goals this Serie A season.\n39:25 Comment: And of course the central defenders understand who the main threat comes from.\n39:30 Comment: Today they put him in a vice.\n39:33 Comment: Although he had a chance. Do you remember in the first half, Condrey’s shot didn’t work out.\n39:37 Comment: Icardi was and was not eye to eye on the hole.\n39:42 Comment: Marium. So far he can't get the status of super Marium.\n39:48 Comment: Super Marium is Italian.\n39:50 Comment: Of course, there was already one super Marium in Italy.\n39:54 Comment: There was a hotel, I mean. Really...\n39:56 Comment: There was something to argue about.\n39:58 Comment: It was already several years ago. More precisely, it was one year.\n40:1 Comment: Kondreva. Pass over Ambrosio. Cross it over. No, let them not put an isthmus.\n40:7 Comment: Cotter throws towards the hotel. However, he was not able to make a pass exactly to the front.\n40:11 Comment: Jovetic. Jovetic throws the ball. But not the way Kondreva does it.\n40:16 Comment: An underwhelming goal for Icardi. In the end, Giluigi Donnaruma scored with the ball.\n40:22 Comment: It seems to me or Icardi has already quietly established relations with Inter fans.\n40:26 Comment: Or they still demand that he give up the captain's armband.\n40:30 Comment: They don't have a relationship between the fans and Icardi.\n40:33 Comment: Because Icardi did a lot of weird things with the fans.\n40:39 Comment: But we've already talked about this many times.\n40:41 Comment: He was fined seriously by the club management.\n40:43 Comment: Inter fans promised not to pay any more attention to him.\n40:47 Comment: Like a significant figure. He's no longer a favorite.\n40:50 Comment: In those Inter vaseries. But at the same time, it is natural for the Inter club to be a great asset.\n40:55 Comment: This is the team captain's big skater.\n40:57 Comment: So of course Icardi remains captain.\n41:0 Comment: He promises to improve. We'll see. Goals.\n41:3 Comment: The most important thing is what is expected from Icardi. Including goals in the Milan derby.\n41:7 Comment: And this derby continues. Decisive minutes.\n41:12 Comment: The final segment of the game. Mario comes under pressure from Fernandez.\n41:17 Comment: Mario turns around with the ball so impressively.\n41:20 Comment: Although it's time to turn on the maximum speed here.\n41:23 Comment: Jovicic throws the ball to Kandagbia.\n41:26 Comment: Kandagbia. There is Mario nearby. But they should all be a little closer to the penalty area.\n41:30 Comment: Away from the opponent's goal. Inter is building this whole combination.\n41:34 Comment: Kondreva is on the flank. The Deshiles are catching up with him.\n41:37 Comment: Condreva returns to the flank. This is De Ambrosio.\n41:40 Comment: Next to Mario. There is Kandagbia. The ball should move faster.\n41:43 Comment: The kick from Kandagbia also rolls. The ricochets are all for Milan.\n41:47 Comment: Blow to Vakhkhov. Kandagbiya is out.\n41:50 Comment: Another substitution. Another young football player.\n41:53 Comment: The Milan squad will appear on the field. Mario Pasalic.\n41:56 Comment: Croatian legionnaire. On loan from Chelsea.\n41:59 Comment: Pasalic. Place of badmintour.\n42:1 Comment: Badmintura, I think that now Shiro will just get a standing ovation.\n42:5 Comment: Yes, we still have a huge number of sons of the Balkans on the field.\n42:15 Comment: There are more of them. But Badmintura, of course, deserved this applause.\n42:20 Comment: He scored the assist today.\n42:23 Comment: In general, he played a very good match. He did a lot of work on the field.\n42:28 Comment: He was extremely useful for Milan. Tired, of course.\n42:31 Comment: Pasalic. His place. By the way, Honda remains in reserve.\n42:35 Comment: But he probably won’t appear on the field today.\n42:38 Comment: Honda is also an old friend of ours. But, in fact, he lost his place in Milan.\n42:41 Comment: I'm afraid that they will get rid of him in the near future.\n42:45 Comment: You know, as they said in Soviet football. A good clearance is almost a pass.\n42:49 Comment: And now, without looking, I simply knocked Kutska away.\n42:54 Comment: And I almost got caught in the lopod. But this is already an attack by Inter.\n42:57 Comment: Another one. This is a real assault.\n43:0 Comment: Through the right edge. Here to Amrosio. False movement on the left.\n43:3 Comment: Inconvenient. And not my own feet.\n43:6 Comment: The shot didn't do any better.\n43:9 Comment: Jao Mario. Crazy possession advantage for Inter.\n43:14 Comment: Well, for the derby, yes.\n43:17 Comment: Mario. Jao Mario is back with the ball. What will the Portuguese come up with?\n43:21 Comment: Strafnuyu. Bad pass.\n43:23 Comment: However, there was an interception. Kondopia had many, many mistakes in today's match.\n43:28 Comment: One and a half minutes before the end of the main time of our meeting.\n43:32 Comment: Ready. Jovetic. Four players in front of him.\n43:35 Comment: Jovetic throws the ball to the left.\n43:38 Comment: Milan have defeated their long-time rivals in their last four home matches.\n43:45 Comment: Well, nominally home. Although, on the other hand, we understand that most of the fans, yes,\n43:50 Comment: When Milan is the nominal owner of the red and black colors, apparently this helps.\n43:58 Comment: But at the same time, Inter in general this season is somehow doing something like a side,\n44:5 Comment: The leading matches are all very, very bad.\n44:8 Comment: Yes, and home ones too, I said, the position of inter in the standings.\n44:12 Comment: I will say that it will most likely get worse. Well, no matter how low the inter will not go,\n44:16 Comment: but will remain after 13 rounds with 17 points. This, of course, is extremely small.\n44:22 Comment: And inter is getting further and further into the Champions League zone, which the club so needs for development.\n44:27 Comment: The fans and experts really hoped that Inter would shake itself up after a series of failures before the Derby under a new coach.\n44:35 Comment: Although he had very little time to even get to know the players,\n44:39 Comment: because they came from different national teams.\n44:42 Comment: Indeed, Inter were good, fresh, with ideas in the first half,\n44:48 Comment: But in the second Milan Syanov simply stood up after the second goal scored.\n44:53 Comment: It didn’t turn out the same story as a few years ago, when Stromachone, remember, took over the team,\n44:58 Comment: and there, a few weeks later, he already had the Milan Derby, and Inter won it on emotions.\n45:5 Comment: When the field is ready, referee Tagliave To adds.\n45:10 Comment:  Three minutes.\n45:12 Comment: Lopodola is like a beast here, literally rushing from one to another.\n45:16 Comment: Joe Mario's pass is not bad, but here Descillo puts his body up and kicks the ball far forward.\n45:23 Comment: Wout.

    "summary": "In a thrilling and pulsating clash at the San Siro, AC Milan and Inter Milan played out an electrifying 2-2 draw in the latest edition of the storied Milan Derby. This match, replete with passion, excitement, and drama, showcased why this fixture remains one of the most eagerly anticipated in world football.\n\nFrom the first whistle, both sides signaled their intentions to go on the attack. Inter Milan, in their black and blue kits, took to the pitch with a lineup featuring some of their most dynamic players. Samir Handanovic, donning the number 1 jersey, was tasked with safeguarding the goal, a role he has excelled in across Europe. On the defensive line, Danilo D'Ambrosio wore the number 33 jersey and was stationed on the right, while Christian Ansaldi, donning number 15, operated from the left. In the center of defense were Joao Miranda (number 25) and Gary Medel (number 17), who, despite being a midfielder by trade, took on the role of a central defender.\n\nIn midfield, the ever-energetic Joao Mario, Inter’s most expensive transfer of the summer, along with Geoffrey Kondogbia and Marcelo Brozovic, looked to control the tempo of the game. The attacking trident consisted of Antonio Candreva, Ivan Perisic, and the talismanic captain Mauro Icardi, wearing numbers 87, 44, and 9 respectively. Stefano Pioli, in only his third game in charge, aimed to rejuvenate Inter's wavering campaign.\n\nOn the other side of the pitch, AC Milan, decked in their iconic red and black stripes, were led by head coach Vincenzo Montella. Gianluigi Donnarumma, the precocious talent between the sticks, wore the number 99 jersey. Abate (20) and De Sciglio (2) as full-backs, flanked central defenders Gabriel Paletta (29) and Gustavo Gomez (15). The midfield trio comprised Manuel Locatelli (73), Juraj Kucka (33), and Giacomo Bonaventura (5), while the front three included Suso (8), the fleet-footed M'Baye Niang (11), and the goal-hungry Carlos Bacca (70).\n\nThe game began with Inter looking more dangerous, particularly through their crisp passing and energetic runs. For Milan, this was apparent in the way Stefano Pioli’s men tried to orchestrate the tempo through the wings, with Candreva and Perisic causing early threats. Despite a flurry of activity and intricate moments, neither Giorgi Medel's hulking presence nor Kondogbia's driving runs could produce the first notable chance of the game.\n\nAs the minutes ticked on, the game was characterized by its frantic pace and intense physicality. Milan, playing with cautious optimism, found themselves retreating to counter the oncoming blue and black waves. An early claim for a penalty by the Rossoneri faithful, following a clash between Niang and Medel, was denied, much to the chagrin of the Milan supporters swelling the stands.\n\nMilan’s defense, marshaled by Donnarumma, required keen vigilance as the young keeper pulled off a crucial save from Mauro Icardi, whose clever setup seemingly placed him on the verge of opening the scoring. However, a decisive touch from Donnarumma and steadfast defending by Gomez snuffed out the danger.\n\nOn the cusp of halftime, Milan broke the deadlock in a moment of breathtaking speed and precision. A rapid counter saw Bonaventura threading a perfect ball to Suso, whose exquisite control and clinical finish with his left foot beat Handanovic, sending Milan's fans into raptures at the storied stadium. \n\nThe start of the second half continued in a similar vein, with Inter desperately searching for an equalizer. Their endeavor paid off when Candreva, in a sublime individual effort, let loose a cannon of a shot from outside the box that whizzed stunningly into the top corner. It was an equalizer that reverberated across the pitch, resetting the balance of the tie. His celebration was a clear indication of what the goal meant, not only to him but to the team as well.\n\nNot to be outdone, Milan responded quickly. Recapturing their lead through another brilliant display of teamwork, Suso once again etched his name on the scoresheet. A combination play involving Bacca saw the ball returned to Suso, who glided past the Inter defenders with an artistry that left them flatfooted, then slotted the ball coolly past Handanovic.\n\nThe derby, filled with back-and-forth exchanges, saw tensions and passion flare. Long-time hard as nails defender Gary Medel couldn't continue and was replaced by Jeison Murillo. Despite missing the presence and grit of Medel, Inter continued to push for an equalizer, employing subs like Jovetić to bolster their offensive push. \n\nInter’s attack became relentless as the match progressed into the final stretch. They pushed Milan into a defensive stance, with Donnarumma forced into several critical saves, showcasing why many consider him the future of Italian goalkeeping. While Milan aimed to exploit the counter-attack, Inter saw their efforts rewarded in the dying embers of the game.\n\nFrom a corner, Ivan Perisic, ever so persistent throughout the game, slotted home an equalizer past a scrambling Milan defense, which had lapsed momentarily in concentration. The goal stunned Milan, especially their defenders who had worked tirelessly throughout the match. Inter's haul to earn a share of the spoils was a testament to their resilience.\n\nIn the end, a 2-2 draw reflected a fair outcome of a hard-fought, high octane derby clash endlessly pulsating with the dynamic ebb and flow of two historical giants of Italian football. For Inter, the signs of revival under Pioli were evident as he mustered a draw from the jaws of defeat, while Milan earned vital lessons from this reflective fixture.\n\nBoth teams demonstrated fervent determination with their respective objectives in the league clear: Milan aiming to solidify a return to European relevance, and Inter searching for consistency and ascendancy in their ranks. As the final whistle blew, each side left with a bittersweet taste—the joy of brilliant goals and the frustration of missed opportunities. This Derby della Madonnina added another thrilling chapter to the long-running saga, painting a clear picture of what Italian football's essence truly represents."
