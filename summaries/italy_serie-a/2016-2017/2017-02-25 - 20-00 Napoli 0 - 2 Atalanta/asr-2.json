Napole will likely have more possession of the ball,\n0:9 Comment: and Talent to play counter-attacks.\n0:11 Comment:  It's clear.\n0:12 Comment: And it was precisely this tactic that Talante brought success in the first match.\n0:17 Comment: Pause Ghulyam with the ball.\n0:20 Comment: Diawara, he's in the support zone today.\n0:22 Comment: Jorginho remained on the bench,\n0:25 Comment: And Allan is injured and doesn't play\n0:27 Comment: and will probably miss the matches against Juventus in the Italian Cup.\n0:32 Comment: It's already Tuesday and against Real Madrid.\n0:36 Comment: Even this is in two weeks in the Champions League here in Sao Paulo.\n0:44 Comment: Passing in the center of the field.\n0:45 Comment: Insigne serves for Dries Mertens.\n0:48 Comment: Italian newspapers wrote and speculated today\n0:53 Comment: before the start of the meeting, before the main lineups were announced,\n0:57 Comment: That maybe today Insigne will remain on the bench.\n1:0 Comment: Mertens will play on the left in attack,\n1:2 Comment: and either Leonardo Pavaletti will appear in the center forward position,\n1:6 Comment: or Arkadyush Milik.\n1:7 Comment: But I decided not to seek good from good.\n1:11 Comment: Maurizio Sari, that's how it happened.\n1:13 Comment: Due to Milik's injury, we were still looking for a center forward,\n1:16 Comment: we found it in Dries Mertens, who is now the top scorer in Naples\n1:21 Comment: with 16 goals scored.\n1:24 Comment: So I preferred a light attack.\n1:29 Comment: The trio are ahead of Sari.\n1:31 Comment: And I think it will be very difficult for Atalanta to defend against them.\n1:36 Comment: But now Atalanta is clearing the ball from their own half of the field.\n1:40 Comment: Forward pass to Alexandre Gomez.\n1:42 Comment: Isberg's team with a small force.\n1:45 Comment: But Gomez and food are ahead.\n1:47 Comment: Just now Jasmin Kurtic has joined.\n1:51 Comment: Kurtic, who was recently in the match with Torino\n1:57 Comment: I didn't score a few goals.\n1:59 Comment: It was just fantastic how he missed the turn.\n2:6 Comment: Feeding deep into the retreating center-forward of Atalanta.\n2:14 Comment: The team is playing with two strikers this season.\n2:19 Comment: Gomez is a little behind, the food is a little ahead.\n2:21 Comment: Now Hamshik fails to take the ball.\n2:26 Comment: Pass to Lin Xinyi, and meanwhile Marek Hamsik is knocked down.\n2:31 Comment: He's lying on the lawn.\n2:33 Comment: Naturally, the stands, for whom this is an idol, are unhappy\n2:37 Comment: and a new icon after Maradona.\n2:44 Comment: Very dirty here, I would even say, played by Franck Quissier.\n2:47 Comment: Hit Marek Hamsik in the face.\n2:50 Comment: I must say that Kissier missed the first meeting of these teams.\n2:54 Comment: He received a completely unnecessary, stupid sending off in the match with Kratona.\n2:58 Comment: I didn’t play with Napoleon then.\n3:1 Comment: But today Franck Quissier is on the field.\n3:5 Comment: In general, there is not a single change compared to the last match against Kratona of the 25th round.\n3:11 Comment: Atalanta still have the same players on the pitch.\n3:14 Comment: But Pavaletti doesn’t play for Napoleon compared to the match against Kyiv.\n3:19 Comment: And Kalida Kulebali does not play.\n3:21 Comment: We left it in stock today.\n3:22 Comment: Preferred to Maksimovich.\n3:23 Comment: Well, Allah, whom I said, also did not appear on the field today.\n3:28 Comment: As well as Georgini.\n3:29 Comment: Here are four changes.\n3:30

to us all the time.\n3:44 Comment: Gamshik is fine.\n3:46 Comment: Well, I got it in the face.\n3:47 Comment: Here, it is clear that there is no serious injury.\n3:49 Comment: It's just amazing that there was no yellow card.\n3:52 Comment: Kissier, by the way, is on the cards again.\n3:55 Comment: If he gets a yellow card today, he will miss the next match.\n3:59 Comment: Very important against Fiorentina.\n4:2 Comment: Homemade.\n4:4 Comment: This is a very difficult period for Atalanta.\n4:6 Comment: Inter Fiorentina starts there.\n4:11 Comment: Tough games.\n4:12 Comment: The team has been beating outsiders mostly lately.\n4:17 Comment: Berisha.\n4:23 Comment: Masyeva.\n4:28 Comment: So far the guests are not holding the ball at all, but neither are Napoli.\n4:31 Comment: And so, by and large, there were no dangers.\n4:33 Comment: But only four and a half minutes passed.\n4:36 Comment: We didn't have to wait for anything serious.\n4:39 Comment: Hysai.\n4:42 Comment: Spinazolo met him and made an inaccurate pass to Hysai.\n4:46 Comment: And Spinazolo plays great again.\n4:48 Comment: Gomez was a little delayed, but waited for Spinazolo to connect.\n4:51 Comment: Spinazolo goes down the flank.\n4:53 Comment: Shoots.\n4:54 Comment: Is there anyone there?\n4:55 Comment: There's Frank Quissier.\n4:56 Comment: Turn kick.\n4:57 Comment:  First hit.\n4:59 Comment: And the players from Bergamo carried out a very good attack.\n5:3 Comment: Frank Quissier.\n5:4 Comment: But first of all, of course, it is the connection along Conti's flank.\n5:9 Comment: Conti has scored in his last two matches.\n5:11 Comment: Andrea Conti.\n5:13 Comment: He also scored the winning goal for Crotone.\n5:16 Comment: He scored one of the goals at the Palermo goal.\n5:23 Comment: And in total he has four goals and three assists this season.\n5:29 Comment: Here is such a young football player.\n5:31 Comment: Chilsey's been eyeing him.\n5:37 Comment: Gulam.\n5:39 Comment: Now Conti is meeting Fauzi Ghulam.\n5:42 Comment: His player is a flanker.\n5:44 Comment: Kaldara hits the ball.\n5:46 Comment: But on Insigne's leg.\n5:47 Comment: Insigne and the ball touched the crossbar.\n5:51 Comment: But Napoleon responded with a dangerous moment to Atalanta's attack.\n5:56 Comment: Let's watch this episode again.\n6:0 Comment: Kaldara.\n6:2 Comment: The ball is knocked out.\n6:3 Comment: Insigne is the first to reach him.\n6:6 Comment: And he played cunningly.\n6:8 Comment: Started playing around.\n6:9 Comment: But look at the moment with Conti's blow.\n6:11 Comment: You can't say Pepe Reina overworked himself in this episode.\n6:15 Comment: Nevertheless, in terms of structure, in terms of geometry, the moment was quite dangerous.\n6:21 Comment: And a little more accurately, a little stronger, punch Conti.\n6:25 Comment: The ball would have gone into the corner.\n6:28 Comment: Callihon passes to Elseid Hysaj.\n6:32 Comment: Napole's right and left defenders regularly join in.\n6:38 Comment: But so far both Spinazzolo and Conti are coping with them.\n6:48 Comment: Andrea Pitaña.\n6:50 Comment: The author of the winning goal in the first round match.\n6:55 Comment: And also one of the players who went to Coverciano this week to see Gianpira Venturia.\n7:5 Comment: As they said, they are working on interaction in a 4-2-4 formation.\n7:10 Comment: Who plays in the Italian national team at Ventura.\n7:15 Comment: They told me a lot of interesting things.\n7:17 Comment: Atalanto plays in a different formation, with three central defenders.\n7:20 Comment: But both Caldaro and Spinazzolo.\n7:24 Comment: They said that in those clubs where they had a chance to play they were already on loan.\n7:31 Comment: They worked out this scheme and understand everything perfectly.\n7:35 Comment: At any moment we must be ready to come to the aid of the team.\n7:39 Comment: And in the coming years, I think these players will already be wearing jerseys of other teams.\n7:46 Comment: Juventus, maybe Chelsea.\n7:52 Comment: Fran Quissier is already playing for the Cod de Houar national team.\n7:55 Comment: Who, however, competed unsuccessfully at the African Championships.\n7:57 Comment: But still Kissier went and played Gomez.\n8:4 Comment: There was no one there to push the ball.\n8:7 Comment: The food was more to the right.\n8:12 Comment: Atalanto's only pass on the left flank has worked so far.\n8:18 Comment: He was able to move the ball forward.\n8:23 Comment: And the partners got involved in large numbers.\n8:25 Comment: There were four of them there.\n8:27 Comment: And this all led to a blow to the rather dangerous Andrea Conte.\n8:31 Comment: 1-1 on chances.\n8:33 Comment: That's what I would think.\n8:35 Comment: Jasmin Kurtic.\n8:38 Comment: He waited too long to deliver.\n8:40 Comment: The ball was intercepted.\n8:42 Comment: But Masielo is already good here.\n8:46 Comment: The three formed.\n8:48 Comment: Tuloy, Macielo and Caldara.\n8:50 Comment: Kaldara.\n8:54 Comment: Macielo is, of course, the most experienced.\n8:56 Comment:  31 year.\n8:59 Comment: Well, Caldara is 22.\n9:2 Comment: Hysai.\n9:4 Comment: Because of the side.\n9:7 Comment: I decided to play around with Zhelinsky, who came on the attack.\n9:15 Comment: Gamshik.\n9:17 Comment: Gulam.\n9:18 Comment: Lorenzo Insigne.\n9:20 Comment: We saw how he was surpassed in height.\n9:23 Comment: The same Kissier.\n9:25 Comment: And Tula was nearby.\n9:28 Comment: He left behind.\n9:30 Comment: One of the three defenders.\n9:32 Comment: Following my ward, Insigne.\n9:35 Comment: The defenders will try very hard to keep them away from talent today.\n9:40 Comment: 3 for 3 exchange.\n9:42 Comment: Difficult with such nimble forwards and central defenders.\n9:47 Comment: But with personal care, of course, it’s also difficult.\n9:52 Comment: Berisha.\n9:54 Comment: Kills.\n9:56 Comment: Freuler.\n10:0 Comment: After the departure of Roberto Galiardini, Freuler appears in the starting line-up on a permanent basis.\n10:7 Comment: He and Kissier.\n10:8 Comment: There used to be a lot of rotation.\n10:12 Comment: But now it's mostly them.\n10:14 Comment: Sometimes you see another talent.\n10:17 Comment: Alberto Grassi.\n10:19 Comment: There is also Brian Cristante in reserve, who came from Pescara.\n10:22 Comment: But Cristante is only a replacement for now.\n10:25 Comment: I came out three times and scored once.\n10:31 Comment: Maybe we'll see him today.\n10:34 Comment: Some newspapers.\n10:35 Comment: For example, Bergamo Sera.\n10:38 Comment: We were expecting him to show up today.\n10:40 Comment: That Conti won’t play, but a new acquisition will come out.\n10:43 Comment: The Dutchman Hateboer, who hasn't played a single minute for his talent yet.\n10:47 Comment: To the right flank.\n10:49 Comment: Because Conti returned from Dzianpierre Ventura with little damage.\n10:55 Comment: That's what they wrote.\n10:57 Comment: But Conti is playing and had chances today.\n10:59 Comment: What would it be like without him?\n11:1 Comment: Spinatsova throws the ball further with her head.\n11:3 Comment: There's Papu Gomez.\n11:6 Comment: Papu is his nickname.\n11:9 Comment: Dyawara.\n11:12 Comment: Gulam.\n11:15 Comment: Leaves the ball to Lorenzo Insigne.\n11:19 Comment: The players alternate attacks with the left and right flanks.\n11:25 Comment: Napoli.\n11:27 Comment: Gamshik.\n11:31 Comment: Dutch.\n11:33 Comment: Gulam.\n11:35 Comment: But for now they are not allowed in.\n11:40 Comment: Zhilinsky and Hysai ended up here.\n11:44 Comment: And here you go, Hysai meets Spinatsova again.\n11:47 Comment: And as soon as he moves back, Spinatsov follows him immediately.\n11:50 Comment: Trying to take the ball away.\n11:52 Comment: He and Gomez. Didn't work out this time.\n11:54 Comment: Gulam.\n11:59 Comment:  With a ball.\n12:1 Comment: Three meet him.\n12:3 Comment: Including Rafael Taloy, who ended up here.\n12:8 Comment: Kessier.\n12:10 Comment: Sorry, yes.\n12:12 Comment: I've already reported here. Diawara, of course.\n12:15 Comment: Another young talented football player.\n12:18 Comment: Went to Naples from Bolonia.\n12:21 Comment: Before this season starts.\n12:23 Comment: The serve was sent into the penalty area to Kaliekhon.\n12:25 Comment: He controlled everything there. Protector.\n12:27 Comment: And Kaliekhon didn't get to the ball.\n12:29 Comment: The defender was Leonardo Spinazol.\n12:33 Comment: Maybe we can work in the penalty area too.\n12:37 Comment: And Etrid Berisha's lapel.\n12:52 Comment: Spinatsova.\n12:54 Comment: Great move away from Kaliekhon.\n12:58 Comment: I couldn't make the transfer.\n12:59 Comment: I'm going so that even Diawara will interfere.\n13:1 Comment: He got in the way, of course, because of his position.\n13:4 Comment: But the pass itself didn’t work out for Spinazola.\n13:6 Comment: Although the first technical action was very bright.\n13:9 Comment: Stroke.\n13:11 Comment: Stop. Kaliejon is arguing with Domianico Celli.\n13:17 Comment: Dominico Celli has already refereed the Napoleon match this season.\n13:21 Comment: Recently from Palermo.\n13:23 Comment: When the game was 1-1.\n13:26 Comment: Kaliehon throws the ball.\n13:27 Comment: And here he...\n13:33 Comment:  Violation.\n13:35 Comment: It seemed like it was real.\n13:42 Comment: Transfer to the left flank.\n13:47 Comment: Gamshik.\n13:50 Comment: Dyawara.\n13:52 Comment: Gomez.\n13:58 Comment: Kessier.\n14:7 Comment: With the ball from Alanto.\n14:9 Comment: Not a common occurrence.\n14:11 Comment: The team controls the ball.\n14:13 Comment: Freuler allowed Spinazola to rise slightly forward.\n14:17 Comment: But the structure at the back must be preserved.\n14:27 Comment: The referee's whistle is dissatisfied.\n14:29 Comment: Sarri at Grovka.\n14:37 Comment: Because the out is in favor of Alanto.\n14:40 Comment: Chelli shows that you need to take the ball into play a little further from the opponent's goal.\n14:45 Comment: Kaldara.\n14:47 Comment: Tula.\n14:49 Comment: Kessier. Pressing Napoleon.\n14:51 Comment: Alanto players are released.\n14:54 Comment: And Tula went ahead.\n14:58 Comment: To the right. Yasmin Kurtic is here.\n15:1 Comment: It shoots through.\n15:3 Comment: The ball doesn't reach Alexandre Gomez.\n15:5 Comment: And who is on the selection? Masyev is on the selection.\n15:7 Comment: Look how interesting it is now.\n15:9 Comment: Now he is attacking positionally from Alanto.\n15:11 Comment: And he controls the ball long enough.\n15:13 Comment: Napole tries to vary rhythm and tactics.\n15:21 Comment: Forward pass to Gries Mertens.\n15:23 Comment: But he works very closely with him there.\n15:27 Comment: Reliable mother of Caldara so far.\n15:30 Comment: Tula.\n15:33 Comment: To the flank.\n15:35 Comment: And Conti went.\n15:37 Comment: He's making a transfer to Nutrition.\n15:40 Comment: Pitani likes to move to the right.\n15:42 Comment: He scored many times after this shift.\n15:45 Comment: He went to the right, took the ball and then made a dash into the penalty area.\n15:48 Comment: But now he couldn't take the ball.\n15:51 Comment: Gomez.\n15:53 Comment: Shows pressure.\n15:55 Comment: A little bolder from Alanto.\n15:57 Comment: At first we looked closely and played very carefully.\n15:59 Comment: And now, look, there are large forces ahead.\n16:2 Comment: Freuler is there, Kurtich is there.\n16:5 Comment: Reyna.\n16:7 Comment: The ball kicks forward.\n16:9 Comment: And Toloi meets his player Lorenzo Insini.\n16:12 Comment: The Brazilian wins the ball.\n16:14 Comment: And forward.\n16:17 Comment:  Nutrition.\n16:19 Comment: Couldn't accept Diawar again.\n16:21 Comment: I didn’t dare to give it forward.\n16:23 Comment: Dries Merton tried to play technically.\n16:29 Comment: It wasn’t possible to play against a partner in touch or against the wall.\n16:32 Comment: Gomez.\n16:34 Comment: On the flank.\n16:36 Comment: Here is Leonardo Spinazzova.\n16:38 Comment: Gomez gives away the free kick.\n16:40 Comment: And Nikolai Maksimovich knocks the ball out.\n16:43 Comment: Here's a player who, by the way, appears quite often lately.\n16:48 Comment: In the last round I played together with Kalidou Kulebali.\n16:50 Comment: At the center of the defense.\n16:52 Comment: And today Maksimovich plays in tandem with Albiol.\n16:58 Comment: Gives Sari's central defenders a rest.\n17:1 Comment: But, it’s true, they write that Kulebali still won’t come to his senses after the African Cup.\n17:6 Comment: He doesn't show the best examples of his game.\n17:13 Comment: In touch.\n17:15 Comment: If there had been transmission, it could have been a sharp attack.\n17:18 Comment: With the connection of Fauzi Ghulam.\n17:20 Comment: But such an attack did not work.\n17:22 Comment: Kaldara.\n17:26 Comment:  Nutrition.\n17:30 Comment: Breaking the rules.\n17:36 Comment: Violation of the rules on the part of nutrition, in fact, during the reception he played with his hand.\n17:44 Comment: Maksimovic immediately brought the ball back.\n17:47 Comment: Gulam.\n17:49 Comment: Insignia.\n17:52 Comment: Napoli players are trying to pull this defense away from Alanta.\n17:57 Comment: Spinazola.\n18:2 Comment: Macielo.\n18:8 Comment:  Back.\n18:10 Comment: Alexander Gomez.\n18:18 Comment: Freuler.\n18:21 Comment: Doggie.\n18:25 Comment: And out.\n18:29 Comment: Atalanta's counterattack failed.\n18:32 Comment: Well, actually, so far both teams have failed to attack, for the most part.\n18:37 Comment: For now, it’s interesting to watch this in terms of breaking the defense and Atalanta’s transition to a counter-attack.\n18:44 Comment: The counter-attack of the defense is also from Alanta, Napoli's side, of course.\n18:48 Comment: Interception. And now, maybe it's interesting.\n18:51 Comment: Alexandre Gomez takes the ball and immediately passes it to Freuler.\n18:55 Comment: Freuler.\n18:57 Comment: The reception is not accurate.\n19:0 Comment: Diawara sets a difficult task for her partners.\n19:4 Comment: He shows Dries Mertens that you need to pass lower, lower.\n19:9 Comment: Because Mertens, of course, is not a player of heroic stature.\n19:12 Comment: And if you have planned it this way, then you need to adapt.\n19:17 Comment: But Diawara, it feels like Abykak just kicked the ball out under pressure.\n19:29 Comment: Nikola Maksimovic.\n19:38 Comment: Let's watch this episode.\n19:39 Comment: Gomez broke the rule.\n19:46 Comment: Napoli have the ball.\n19:48 Comment: But they intercept it quickly.\n19:50 Comment: However, they don't intercept the rule.\n19:52 Comment: It's just Freuler who violates the center of the field.\n19:55 Comment: Damir Kacheli will record this.\n20:9 Comment: Ensene.\n20:11 Comment: Turned around technically.\n20:13 Comment: That’s exactly what Taloy left behind.\n20:16 Comment: The defender who came out after him.\n20:19 Comment: Well, then the players managed to restore the defensive line with talent.\n20:24 Comment: And Taloy left. The central midfielder provided backup.\n20:27 Comment: That's it. The attack is repulsed.\n20:34 Comment: This is the fight Maksimovich and Gomez show us.\n20:40 Comment: And again because of the side talent.\n20:43 Comment: Leonardo Spinazzolo.\n20:46 Comment: There's still an exchange of remarks.\n20:48 Comment: And mainly as a judge.\n20:50 Comment: Both teams are constantly trying to find out something from Domenic Celli.\n20:56 Comment: Berisha.\n20:58 Comment: Knocked the ball out.\n21:9 Comment: Encinha.\n21:21 Comment: Hysai.\n21:25 Comment: Maksimovich.\n21:28 Comment: Ensigna in midfield receives the ball.\n21:32 Comment: Gives to the flank.\n21:35 Comment: Mertens is moving here.\n21:36 Comment: Behind him is Caldara.\n21:38 Comment: Pay attention. He won't let him go.\n21:40 Comment: And they took it away.\n21:42 Comment: Together with Conti.\n21:45 Comment: And the ball was kicked out. Not an attack, really.\n21:47 Comment: He almost immediately ended up with Napoli.\n21:49 Comment:  But.\n21:51 Comment: Nevertheless. The attack here was not dangerous for Napoli.\n21:54 Comment: Meanwhile, half of the first half is already over.\n21:57 Comment: So far, except for Lorenz Ensigna's blow.\n22:0 Comment: So cunning.\n22:2 Comment: After which the ball hit the crossbar.\n22:6 Comment: And nothing happened.\n22:8 Comment: And look at Atalanta's sharp interceptions.\n22:10 Comment: May occur.\n22:12 Comment: Please here any inaccurate transmission.\n22:15 Comment: And he becomes nervous in the Napoli penalty area.\n22:17 Comment: Cast.\n22:19 Comment: Not the first forward over Riso Mertens.\n22:21 Comment: In the hope that the defenders will be mistaken.\n22:23 Comment: And Mertens will run away with the ball.\n22:25 Comment: This is also an attack option.\n22:27 Comment: And it hasn’t worked out for Napoli yet either.\n22:29 Comment: Fauzi Ghulam.\n22:31 Comment: Now if only we could make contact.\n22:33 Comment: But it didn't work.\n22:34 Comment: Not defenders.\n22:36 Comment: Discount Spinazola.\n22:41 Comment: Freuler took it on his chest.\n22:43 Comment:  Ball.\n22:47 Comment: Callejon.\n22:49 Comment: Unnoticed Jose Callejon.\n22:54 Comment: And this is how Atalanta football players act selflessly and acrobatically.\n23:1 Comment: Ugh.\n23:2 Comment: It's unfortunate how the player landed now.\n23:5 Comment: I hit the back of my head.\n23:7 Comment: It looks like I even lost consciousness.\n23:10 Comment: Doctor right away.\n23:12 Comment: The players showed it right away.\n23:14 Comment: What is Masila showing there.\n23:19 Comment:  Everything is fine.\n23:23 Comment: Because anything can happen with such a fall.\n23:27 Comment: Toloi played impressively.\n23:29 Comment: And look.\n23:33 Comment: I landed unsuccessfully.\n23:35 Comment: Toloi hit me with his fist.\n23:37 Comment:  AND...\n23:39 Comment: Well, I seem to have recovered.\n23:42 Comment: Seems okay.\n23:44 Comment:  Now he.\n23:46 Comment: But the landing was terrible.\n23:48 Comment: And at first it seemed that he would not come to his senses soon.\n23:51 Comment: But the football player turned out to be strong.\n23:56 Comment: Wanted to do this.\n23:58 Comment: Not to be as beautiful as possible.\n24:0 Comment: But I just threw myself at this ball.\n24:3 Comment: And just like that, I landed unsuccessfully.\n24:5 Comment: Not prepared for the fall.\n24:9 Comment: Okay Toloi.\n24:11 Comment:  Let's hope.\n24:13 Comment: And now his partners are intercepting.\n24:15 Comment: He inspires them as if by his example of dedication to actively fight ahead.\n24:21 Comment: Frank Quissier.\n24:24 Comment: Andrea Cont is waiting for the ball to roll out of the sideline.\n24:31 Comment: Masela.\n24:37 Comment: Kaldara.\n24:39 Comment: Toloi.\n24:47 Comment: The transfer was to the flank.\n24:51 Comment: The sword got caught.\n24:54 Comment: Maksimovich.\n25:0 Comment: Insignia.\n25:2 Comment: Touch.\n25:6 Comment: These programs are not taking place at Naples yet.\n25:9 Comment: Masela.\n25:11 Comment: And there is no such unbearable pressure for Atalanta either.\n25:14 Comment: Touch passes can, of course, lead to a dead end.\n25:18 Comment:  It's clear.\n25:20 Comment: But they don't.\n25:22 Comment: Because Atalant is holding the ranks at the back.\n25:23 Comment: Spinatsova broke the rules.\n25:25 Comment:  Yes.\n25:27 Comment: Standard is also an option.\n25:33 Comment: And here we see the episode that Toloya showed us.\n25:38 Comment: We already saw the ending, when Pitaña was already trying to get out to the gate.\n25:41 Comment: And there's Reina.\n25:43 Comment: So the ball rolled with the hand of his defenders.\n25:47 Comment: And Pitaña reacted faster.\n25:48 Comment: Freuler and Gomez.\n25:50 Comment: Now Walls, Dries Mertens.\n25:52 Comment: Will try Napolis Standard.\n25:55 Comment: There is absolutely nothing from the game yet.\n25:59 Comment: But here, too, Atalanta is tall in the air.\n26:3 Comment: They can fight.\n26:5 Comment: But here we see it.\n26:7 Comment: Conti is playing great.\n26:9 Comment: Freuler.\n26:11 Comment: Leaves the ball to Nutrition.\n26:14 Comment: It was difficult there.\n26:15 Comment: Kissier was on the front line.\n26:18 Comment: Everyone is in their own half.\n26:20 Comment: But this is a hit, a serve.\n26:23 Comment: I don't even know what to call it.\n26:25 Comment: Replenishment of Raul Albiola.\n26:27 Comment: Of course, what complaints can there be against him.\n26:29 Comment: This is the player who...\n26:32 Comment: For whom this is not the main task, to make such accurate passes.\n26:35 Comment: But in general this symbolizes Naples' game for now.\n26:40 Comment: We didn't find an option.\n26:50 Comment: Kissier.\n26:53 Comment: Macielo.\n26:56 Comment: Spinatsova.\n27:0 Comment: Macielo.\n27:6 Comment: Thawed.\n27:8 Comment: Conti.\n27:10 Comment: There is a free zone.\n27:13 Comment: But Diawara is already in time.\n27:15 Comment: Pitanya

Comment: After that, in the next game against Roma, he suffered a torn cruciate ligament and did not play for a long time.\n13:58 Comment: This problem created a certain problem for Maurizio Sari.\n14:2 Comment: He tried Gabiadini, bought Pavaletti, and played Mertens as a center forward.\n14:7 Comment: Well, let's see what this restructuring will bring now.\n14:11 Comment: Zhilinsky and

meets him.\n14:42 Comment: Works on defense.\n14:44 Comment: Did Hysaj miss the ball here?\n14:45 Comment: Yes, it doesn't matter anymore.\n14:46 Comment: Here Hysaj grabs Alejandro Gomez by the neck.\n14:53 Comment: And by the way, not by the neck, by the shoulders.\n14:55 Comment: By the way, the judge forgives him.\n14:57 Comment: Hysaj already has a yellow card.\n14:59 Comment: And here is Domenico Celli.\n15:1 Comment: Of course, he showed liberalism.\n15:5 Comment: Got older.\n15:6 Comment: Such a differentiated approach.\n15:9 Comment: Maybe he would have punished someone else.\n15:10 Comment: Hysai did not.\n15:11 Comment: He didn’t break Naples’ game.\n15:15 Comment: But in general, of course, this full was worth a yellow card.\n15:20 Comment: Maciel.\n15:28 Comment:

fourth striker to 4-24 to make it more difficult for the three central defenders.\n15:54 Comment: Somehow Atalanta will also be forced to rebuild defensively.\n15:57 Comment: Conti.\n15:58 Comment: Spinatsova.\n16:0 Comment: But here they are involved differently.\n16:1 Comment: Translation to Gomez.\n16:2 Comment: Has time.\n16:3 Comment: Gomez succeeds.\n16:4 Comment: I can't bite if I

Comment: Well, against Merton.\n16:56 Comment: Rafael Taloy will apparently play.\n17:2 Comment: These are the observations.\n17:6 Comment: So far, Atalanta's defenders are very attentive.\n17:10

defensive actions.\n17:48 Comment: Decier.\n17:49 Comment: He insures from behind.\n17:53 Comment: Doesn't join in attacks very often.\n17:56 Comment: Frank Desier.\n18:3 Comment: Spinatsova.\n18:5 Comment: Masyela.\n18:11 Comment: Ghoulam.\n18:12 Comment: He outweighed Yasmin Kurtic in the air.\n18:16 Comment: Throws the ball.\n18:18 Comment: Emilik.\n18:19 Comment: It immediately rushes

his third shot on target today.\n19:15 Comment: More precisely, not on target, but simply dangerous.\n19:16 Comment: Cool shot.\n19:17 Comment: He missed once.\n19:21 Comment: Berisha helped him out twice.\n19:32 Comment: Conti.\n19:35 Comment: Kurtic.\n19:38 Comment: Decier.\n19:41 Comment: Turns around.\n19:42 Comment: He'll go on his own.\n19:43 Comment: Well, it was difficult for him here.\n19:45 Comment: And Albiol.\n19:46 Comment: He covers.\n19:47 Comment: The result will be an out.\n19:50 Comment: In favor of Atalanta.\n19:50 Comment: Atalanta has no replacements yet.\n19:53 Comment: And here replacements suggest themselves to refresh the game.\n19:58 Comment: The same Brian Cristante enters the center of the field.\n20:0 Comment: Relatively speaking, instead of Freuler.\n20:4 Comment: Or maybe replacing the food with strips.\n20:12 Comment: Two balls on the field.\n20:15 Comment: More.\n20:16 Comment: Gomez.\n20:17 Comment: And Nutrition.\n20:19 Comment: And Boris.\n20:20 Comment: Spinatsova.\n20:21 Comment: Gomez and Pitan.\n20:22 Comment: And they immediately started running behind them.\n20:23 Comment: Kissier.\n20:24 Comment: Moves forward powerfully.\n20:25 Comment: Diawara meets him.\n20:26 Comment: And there will be Yasmin Kurtic's corner again.\n20:27 Comment: Served by Andrea Pitan.\n20:28 Comment: Let me remind you that it was

    "summary": "The Serie A clash between Napoli and Atalanta was an intense and tactical battle which saw the Bergamo-based team emerge victorious, securing a vital 2-0 win away from home. The game unfolded at the iconic Sao Paulo Stadium, offering spectators a match filled with both skillful maneuvering and gritty defensive work.\n\nFrom the initial whistle, the match revealed two teams with contrasting strategies. Napoli, traditionally known for their ball possession, aimed to control the game through patient build-up play, while Atalanta adopted a more counter-attacking approach that had been effective for them in previous encounters. \n\nThe first half started with Napoli on the front foot, attempting to assert their dominance in possession. Atalanta, on the other hand, illustrated their intentions by staying compact and waiting for opportunities to break on the counter. Early in the half, Napoli's Lorenzo Insigne appeared quite influential as he combined well with Dries Mertens. There were speculations in the press about possible lineup changes, but Maurizio Sari maintained faith in his typically fluid front three of Insigne, Mertens, and Callejon, despite the injury to regular central forward Arkadyush Milik.\n\nNapoli dominated possession in the early stages but struggled to break down Atalanta's well-organized defense. Insigne had a notable chance when his effort clipped the crossbar after he took advantage of a loose ball, showing early signs of the attacking threat Napoli could pose. Despite this, clear-cut opportunities were scarce for the home side as Atalanta's defensive unit stood firm, with young central defender Matija Caldara particularly impressive.\n\nAtalanta slowly began to grow into the game and signaled their intent with a well-orchestrated move that saw Franck Kessie’s shot fly over the bar following a counter-attack down the right flank spearheaded by Andrea Conti. Conti, known for his offensive contributions from full-back, was a constant thorn in Napoli's side throughout the match.\n\nThe breakthrough came in the 28th minute when Atalanta’s Matija Caldara capitalized on a defensive lapse during a corner kick. He rose higher than any of the Napoli defenders and delivered a powerful header that left Pepe Reina with no chance. This goal brought a tangible shift in momentum, bolstering Atalanta’s confidence and putting Napoli on the back foot.\n\nNapoli's response to going behind was swift; they pressed forward with renewed intensity, yet the Atalanta defense held firm, denying them any clear scoring opportunities. The first half concluded with the visiting side surprisingly in front, having expertly executed their game plan. Napoli sought to regroup during the interval, while Gian Piero Gasperini likely encouraged his team to maintain their disciplined approach.\n\nThe second half resumed with both teams making necessary adjustments. Napoli continued their search for an equalizer, with Mertens and Insigne trying to weave through a resolute Atalanta defense. However, Atalanta remained dangerous on the break, utilizing the physical prowess of Andrea Petagna and the quick feet of Papu Gomez to unsettle Napoli's backline.\n\nIn a crucial turning point, Napoli introduced Arkadiusz Milik into the fray, hoping the Polish striker would provide a different dimension to their attack. His inclusion shifted Mertens to a wider role, allowing Milik to operate as the focal point of the attack. However, Atalanta's defense, marshaled by the excellent Caldara and Rafael Toloi, continued to absorb pressure and repel Napoli’s advances.\n\nDespite Napoli's sustained pressure and a series of close calls, including a stinging free-kick from Mertens that goalkeeper Etrit Berisha parried onto the bar, they struggled to find the breakthrough. Atalanta’s resolute defending was epitomized by Franck Kessie, who, despite earning a second yellow card and subsequent dismissal, played a pivotal role in shielding the backline from Napoli’s attacking threats.\n\nSurprisingly, it was Atalanta who doubled their lead despite being down to ten men. In the 70th minute, following elegant play down the left flank by Leonardo Spinazzola, another corner resulted in Caldara capitalizing once again. The central defender displayed remarkable composure to ghost into the box unmarked and slot home, effectively settling the contest.\n\nAs the clock ticked on, Napoli intensified their efforts but without the desired outcome. Insigne, Callejon, and Mertens all had opportunities but were unable to convert against the disciplined Atalanta defense. Berisha remained impenetrable, making crucial saves to deny Napoli any glimmer of hope.\n\nSpinazzola and Conti continued to provide width and defensive cover, showcasing their versatility and underlining why they are highly rated across Europe. The work rate of Atalanta's midfielders, particularly Remo Freuler and Jasmin Kurtic, ensured that Napoli found it challenging to break through the lines, even as they pushed forward in numbers.\n\nThe final substitution saw Gian Piero Gasperini bring on defensive reinforcements in the form of Bryan Cristante, shoring up the midfield and further frustrating Napoli’s attempts to claw back into the game. Despite a numerical disadvantage, Atalanta’s tactical flexibility allowed them to see out the match with composure.\n\nThe final whistle declared a 2-0 victory for Atalanta, a well-deserved result achieved through tactical discipline, clinical finishing, and resilient defending. Gian Piero Gasperini’s men celebrated enthusiastically, understanding the significance of this triumph in their push for European football. For Napoli, it was a case of missed opportunities and a need to reflect and regroup as they look to stay competitive in the Serie A title race. \n\nThis match exemplified the unpredictable nature of football, where tactical nuances and defensive solidity can outmatch possession and attacking flair, a lesson Maurizio Sari and his squad would be keen to address moving forward."
