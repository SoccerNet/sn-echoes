Vermaline was sent off, although Roma opened the scoring.\n4:10 Comment: But there were many other dangerous moments.\n4:12 Comment: Goal canceled against the Romans.\n4:15 Comment: So it's 1-1. A very convenient result in order to continue the fight for getting into the Champions League.\n4:23 Comment: Bruno Perez was wrong in this situation.\n4:26 Comment: And he probably couldn't win this match.\n4:28 Comment: But Emerson is on the left edge.\n4:31 Comment: This defender will have been in action, in fact, since last season.\n4:35 Comment: He was played on the right for Roma.\n4:37 Comment: Bruno Perez, Vermaline and Manolas.\n4:40 Comment: This is such a newly formed combination of central defenders.\n4:45 Comment: The three central obveks are Strohman, Ningalan and Paredes.\n4:49 Comment: Very many people in Italy, in Russia, don’t know what it is.\n4:52 Comment: And this is probably very important in order not to lose this match.\n4:55 Comment: Ningalan and Paredes.\n4:57 Comment: Many people in Italy are surprised by the latest invention of Luciano Spalletti.\n5:1 Comment: After all, this trumpet is located more often on the field.\n5:5 Comment: At least that's what happened in the match against Porto.\n5:9 Comment: Not horizontally, but vertically.\n5:14 Comment: More on that later.\n5:15 Comment: Attack with the left edge.\n5:16 Comment: Adnan uprooted that ball.\n5:18 Comment: Feed to the far post.\n5:19 Comment: Duván Zapata makes a discount.\n5:22 Comment: Well, there was even a slight panic here, it seems to me, in the defense of the damage.\n5:29 Comment: Long pass towards Jack.\n5:31 Comment: He can't catch the ball yet.\n5:33 Comment: And in general I rarely met him.\n5:35 Comment: Widmeer on the right, edge of the pass.\n5:37 Comment: And in this situation, Manolas wins the fight against Duvan Zapata.\n5:43 Comment: A very interesting confrontation.\n5:45 Comment: Powerful Zapata armor-piercing forward against Manolas,\n5:50 Comment: who is also an exceptionally good martial artist.\n5:54 Comment: So, Strotman, Neingalan and Paredes are positioned vertically.\n5:57 Comment: It seems like Neingalan acts more deeply than anyone else.\n6:1 Comment: This is what we see now.\n6:8 Comment: No, in this situation Paredes is number five.\n6:13 Comment: Yes, deeper than the others, higher than Strotman and Neingalan.\n6:16 Comment: In general, almost in a position under the attackers.\n6:19 Comment: But believe me, they will change these positions regularly.\n6:23 Comment: On the right side of the attack is Mohamed Salah.\n6:25 Comment: On the left is El Shirawima.\n6:26 Comment: We remember this from last season.\n6:28 Comment: Edin Dzeko, center forward.\n6:30 Comment: Everything is clear here.\n6:31 Comment: Bruno Perez quickly escapes his opponent's serve.\n6:34 Comment: Maybe ex-footballer Torino.\n6:38 Comment: Black and white colors are irritating and exciting in a good way.\n6:44 Comment: Remember that goal against Juventus?\n6:46 Comment:  Anyway.\n6:47 Comment: Bruno Perez has now left his sideline, by the way.\n6:50 Comment: And I have a feeling that Manulas is addressing such claims to his partner.\n6:55 Comment: The Greek had to work out and clean up in this situation.\n7:2 Comment: Paredes.\n7:4 Comment: Carefully to the right edge.\n7:6 Comment: So far, this right side, as I see it, is a little more active and productive.\n7:10 Comment: Thanks, first of all, to the inclusion of Brazilian defender Perez.\n7:16 Comment: Malin.\n7:18 Comment: El Sharawi.\n7:20 Comment: He lets Emerson go along the edge, giving him his position.\n7:25 Comment: I've moved a little to the center.\n7:27 Comment: The Roman positional offensive continues.\n7:30 Comment: We know this handwriting.\n7:32 Comment: Well, by the way, under so many coaches, Roma played with approximately the same philosophy.\n7:38 Comment: I mean ball control.\n7:39 Comment: But I think it was under Spalet that it became a tradition.\n7:47 Comment: I could be wrong though.\n7:49 Comment: Because even before Spalete there were coaches who preferred combination football.\n7:54 Comment: There were different eras.\n7:56 Comment: I think the first coming and this first segment of Spalete’s work in Roma is a whole era.\n8:3 Comment: What will happen now.\n8:4 Comment: Last year, during the season, Luciano came and pulled the team into the Champions League.\n8:12 Comment: Third place, let me remind you, will be from last season's episode.\n8:18 Comment: At Dinezo, I think we can definitely talk about this now.\n8:23 Comment: Looking at the fact that there are three central defenders on the field.\n8:26 Comment: Quite a decent story for both the Freuleitians and the Yakini.\n8:32 Comment: He is also a supporter of this kind of defense, rich with three central defenders.\n8:38 Comment: This is Erto, Danilo and Samir in a specific situation.\n8:41 Comment: On the right is Widmer along the entire edge.\n8:44 Comment: Also, in fact, his position is familiar.\n8:47 Comment: As for Aliadnan, who operates from the left.\n8:52 Comment: The big fist in the middle is Badu, Polfredson, Fofana and De Paul.\n8:58 Comment: Newcomers De Pauli and Fofana.\n9:0 Comment: It's very interesting to watch them.\n9:2 Comment: Well, Duvan Zapata.\n9:5 Comment: Now to Udineso.\n9:9 Comment: He never managed to open up on the field.\n9:13 Comment: Although, as the Joker, he performed great there.\n9:16 Comment: Transfer to El Sharawi.\n9:18 Comment: El Sharawi, it’s not clear whether he threw it off with his heel like that, or processed it.\n9:26 Comment: Emerson.\n9:28 Comment: He marks to the center and Roma begins to carry this ball around the perimeter.\n9:34 Comment: And a long shot!\n9:36 Comment: A very good El Sharawi could pick up the ball.\n9:40 Comment: It's very neat here, the way Rto worked the ball.\n9:43 Comment: I think it's a violation of the rules.\n9:45 Comment: They pushed a little, they pushed Zapata.\n9:49 Comment: After all, this guy is one of those who won’t just fall.\n9:55 Comment: Stroutman.\n9:57 Comment: A neat pass into the penalty area with your left foot.\n10:0 Comment: And for some reason El Sharawi didn’t finish this episode.\n10:4 Comment: It seemed to me that at first he performed this snatch quite well.\n10:9 Comment: Nice hit.\n10:12 Comment: Not the easiest job for Kornezis.\n10:15 Comment: Although, perhaps it would have been even more dangerous if the ball had managed to ricochet on his lawn right in front of the goalkeeper.\n10:21 Comment: I'll fall on Foufratsen.\n10:23 Comment: He's accelerating through the center of the field.\n10:24 Comment: And a good pass to Duvan Zapata, who plays against Vermaline.\n10:28 Comment: Zapata with the left foot.\n10:30 Comment: The ball gets stuck between Chen's legs again.\n10:33 Comment: And this is a scoring chance.\n10:35 Comment: With your permission, I will characterize him this way.\n10:39 Comment: Long pass forward to Salah, who manages to catch the ball.\n10:45 Comment: Although, it seems that he has already left the field.\n10:48 Comment: Salaha is first on the ball here.\n10:51 Comment: Feed to the far post.\n10:53 Comment: Well, you know, we are now seeing absolutely equal football.\n10:57 Comment: It seems to me that Dinez is even a little sharper in his counter-attacks.\n11:0 Comment: We saw Duvan Zapata hit.\n11:3 Comment: We saw two counterattacks where the final pass wasn't accurate enough.\n11:9 Comment: What about Roma?\n11:11 Comment: Roma, perhaps, had a perfect try from Bruno Perez.\n11:15 Comment: We'll force everything.\n11:16 Comment: The Romans fans are in a good mood.\n11:19 Comment: They practically never stop talking today.\n11:22 Comment: Well, just like that, by eye.\n11:24 Comment: Probably around forty thousand.\n11:31 Comment: Perez passes to Salah.\n11:34 Comment: Salah vs Adnan.\n11:38 Comment: Also quite an interesting confrontation.\n11:42 Comment: Two fleet-footed football players.\n11:45 Comment: Egyptian Salah vs Adnan from Iraq.\n11:52 Comment: Adnan established himself in Serie A last season.\n11:57 Comment: Actually, he showed his universalism.\n12:1 Comment: It can be equally useful both when connecting to attack and defense.\n12:7 Comment: Your eyebrow.\n12:8 Comment: Well, and speed. His speed is probably his main quality.\n12:12 Comment: By mouth.\n12:15 Comment: This is a violation of the rules.\n12:17 Comment: By the way, a very smart midfielder.\n12:20 Comment: I remember how great he performed right away that season,\n12:25 Comment: When Verona jumped into the elite because of Serie B.\n12:29 Comment: And he, of course, restored order in the middle of the Veronese field.\n12:33 Comment: But of course he didn't win.\n12:35 Comment: I restored order in the middle of the field for the Veronese team.\n12:41 Comment: A little later, of course, we’ll perhaps focus our attention.\n12:45 Comment: Let's focus it on transfer issues.\n12:48 Comment: Now I just want to watch football.\n12:51 Comment: More Italian football.\n12:53 Comment: If only there were more moments.\n12:55 Comment: But Edwin Jacka opened up well again.\n12:57 Comment: It was difficult, of course, to shoot with one touch in this situation.\n13:1 Comment: But at least a corner was earned.\n13:2 Comment: And this means that we will see Manu Los in the penalty area.\n13:6 Comment: We'll see Jacko.\n13:8 Comment: We'll probably see Neingalan.\n13:12 Comment: And, of course, the second central defender Vermaline.\n13:16 Comment: Well, Kevin Struatman too.\n13:18 Comment: This whole group of football players has very decent credentials.\n13:22 Comment: Growth weight.\n13:24 Comment: So your feet are on the left or on the right?\n13:27 Comment: On the left.\n13:29 Comment: Here's Emerson.\n13:30 Comment: Emerson bottom and heel.\n13:33 Comment: Neingalan tried, as the players say, to continue this pass.\n13:47 Comment: Emmane Aliaghiman Badu is accelerating.\n13:53 Comment: As for the quality of the top, it is not surprising to confuse Fafan and Badu from time to time.\n13:58 Comment: I apologize in advance if I did this several times.\n14:2 Comment: Neingalan comes under pressure from rivals.\n14:7 Comment: But he came out of this situation with honor, making a very careful pass to Salah.\n14:12 Comment: Salah, as always, impresses with his mobility, his arsenal.\n14:21 Comment: And another combination through the right edge of Bruno Perez.\n14:26 Comment: It took too long to adapt to this serve and the opponent manages to cover.\n14:32 Comment: Perez, also his mobility, his energy now benefits the team.\n14:44 Comment: Good throw to Salah. Salah and Dzeko shoot high.\n14:49 Comment: But there is a feeling that at the last moment he was interrupted and...\n14:52 Comment: Oh, I don’t want to talk about all these stories again, of course.\n14:56 Comment: I know that many colleagues mercilessly criticize Edin Jack.\n15:0 Comment: But I have my own version of what is happening.\n15:4 Comment: But actually here Jack didn't touch the ball at all.\n15:7 Comment: Edin wasn't in the business at all.\n15:10 Comment: If he shot, it hit the opponent’s leg and Tamajer then knocked the ball out for a corner.\n15:14 Comment: It was so obvious.\n15:17 Comment: Well, it wasn't obvious, of course.\n15:19 Comment: We understand that this is a very dynamic episode.\n15:22 Comment: And we won’t scold the referees too much.\n15:33 Comment: Today Debelo, Marzolone, Carbona and Fiorito are helping.\n15:41 Comment: Edmer's breakthrough and questions about breaking the rules.\n15:45 Comment: Was it there or not?\n15:48 Comment: But, to be honest, Edmer stopped a little even at some point.\n15:53 Comment: As if waiting for this push. Let's see.\n16:2 Comment: There was contact.\n16:5 Comment: There was contact, but, to be honest, there was no contact from the Roman team player\n16:10 Comment: Some kind of integrity, some kind of contact.\n16:14 Comment: Some kind of solid, obvious movement towards the opponent.\n16:20 Comment: Not every contact is a penalty or a football.\n16:24 Comment: 0-0 and we still have an absolutely equal game.\n16:28 Comment: As for my taste, Roma, of course, has the territory, control of the ball, initiative.\n16:34 Comment: But the Izudin team was ready for this situation.\n16:41 Comment: Defens very tightly.\n16:44 Comment: And we see that two football players are ready to launch a counterattack.\n16:49 Comment: This is primarily Zapata and, of course, Rodrigo De Pauw.\n16:52 Comment: By the way, it was with his dribbling that Edmer's pass began,\n16:57 Comment: Which could have ended with a 11-meter penalty.\n17:2 Comment: Yes, even though Neingalan was the first to hit the ball, it’s still dangerous for the opponent.\n17:7 Comment: He raised his leg.\n17:12 Comment: I almost started acupuncture with my thorns.\n17:17 Comment: So far, in any case, there are no serious falls, screams, oohs, aahs and blood.\n17:27 Comment: Long forward pass. Handled by Zapata.\n17:33 Comment: Well, De Paul slowed down a little.\n17:35 Comment: Edmer. He's being pursued by El Sharawi.\n17:39 Comment: Edmer. Zapata. Zapata should give the ball back.\n17:43 Comment: Edmer pursued, or rather, continued his offensive parallel to Zapata.\n17:50 Comment: But Duvan in this situation, it seems to me, is being greedy.\n17:53 Comment: Good translation. It's more free here, it's easier to breathe.\n17:57 Comment: Bruno Peires can beat the slow-moving Holfersen one-on-one.\n18:0 Comment: This is what happens to Holfersen, but on a safety net.\n18:4 Comment: Ali is the only one on backup.\n18:9 Comment: Heman is being substituted in hell in this situation.\n18:15 Comment: Passage along the left edge. One, he meets him late. Parades.\n18:20 Comment: And Kostas Manolas is first on the ball in this situation.\n18:24 Comment: Through the captain, through Kevin Strootman.\n18:27 Comment: El Sharawi.\n18:30 Comment: You see, this trick actually almost took off.\n18:37 Comment: In the depths of the field, even closer to the opponent's goal, there is not El Sharawi, but Emerson, the full-back.\n18:46 Comment: This is how Roma is trying to attack.\n18:50 Comment: Hermaline.\n18:53 Comment: Nice pass to El Sharawi.\n18:56 Comment: Emerson.\n19:0 Comment: Stroutman.\n19:5 Comment: So far, Parades and Neingalan are involved in little combination play.\n19:11 Comment: We actually see Strootman with the ball a little more often.\n19:16 Comment: Parades on Hermalina.\n19:18 Comment: Well, now all of Roma's field players are in the opponent's half of the field.\n19:24 Comment: You can spin your carousel endlessly.\n19:26 Comment: Jack.\n19:28 Comment: I wanted to bring Salah back in one touch, but it was already difficult to do there.\n19:36 Comment: Won’t there be a corner here too?\n19:40 Comment: Well, by the way, there really will be some kind of cascade of ricochets, so...\n19:45 Comment: You won’t understand with this repetition either.\n19:47 Comment: In principle, it could have happened that the Udinese defender had two touches at once.\n19:57 Comment: But let's trust the referees. 20 minutes are behind us.\n20:1 Comment: Manolas will win the horsemanship.\n20:3 Comment: Hoferson.\n20:5 Comment: Shirem.\n20:9 Comment: And the diagonal.\n20:11 Comment: Here Vedmer plays Udinez very broadly.\n20:13 Comment: Another long pass across the penalty area.\n20:16 Comment: Well, again, here’s what I was talking about, probably by the tenth minute.\n20:20 Comment: It doesn’t seem bad that Udinese is going on a counterattack.\n20:24 Comment: There is speed, there are right decisions.\n20:27 Comment: But the last pass is of very poor quality.\n20:33 Comment: Here is an episode with Zapata from the same series.\n20:36 Comment: Remember, I could have won.\n20:38 Comment: But, unfortunately, it didn't work out.\n20:39 Comment: Udinese is missing half its chances.\n20:44 Comment: And Roma doesn’t have them yet.\n20:48 Comment: Manolas.\n20:51 Comment: Bruno Pires.\n20:53 Comment: He starts dribbling again and shoots with his left foot.\n20:57 Comment: Basically, his left is not just for walking either.\n21:2 Comment: But, of course, Dinez also has chances.\n21:4 Comment: Basically, his left is not just for walking either.\n21:10 Comment: In any case, it’s captivating that he takes the initiative.\n21:14 Comment: Little by little, little by little, yes, this generational change is happening in Roma.\n21:20 Comment: Look, Daniel Dorosi is on the bench.\n21:23 Comment: Although he played sports, there is still a big question.\n21:26 Comment: What is this anyway?\n21:30 Comment: Is this some kind of trend, or maybe they just gave it a rest and so on?\n21:34 Comment: Degas Perotti is not related to the topic of generational change, but we could quite see it at the core.\n21:41 Comment: Transfer to Salaham.\n21:45 Comment: Well, Florenzo.\n21:47 Comment: Out of composition today.\n21:49 Comment: It will be very interesting to watch them compete with Bruno Pires for the right-back position.\n21:56 Comment: Jacko.\n21:58 Comment: Stuck in the butt so hard.\n22:0 Comment: Vedmeer in front of him, bare edge, Vermaline is late.\n22:4 Comment: And again there are problems with the pass.\n22:6 Comment: And Zapata points with his finger that it was necessary to give the gear a little forward, a little forward.\n22:12 Comment: So that Zapata can correct this ball somewhere with his shovel.\n22:18 Comment: It was then that there was quite a bit left to the gate.\n22:22 Comment: And besides everything else, about the horse.\n22:25 Comment: Bad pass, bad pass from Vedmeer.\n22:30 Comment: Well, Zapata himself also couldn’t stand the line about the horse.\n22:34 Comment: Perez.\n22:36 Comment: Next to Trottman.\n22:41 Comment: Here he is with Trottman, with the ball.\n22:43 Comment: He turned well and made a pass forward to Dzeko.\n22:46 Comment: He plays touch, smart too.\n22:49 Comment: Salah's delivery doesn't stand up to scrutiny.\n22:53 Comment: Well, things aren't going well for the Romans yet.\n22:58 Comment: It's time to play with plans, look for the same Derosi, the same Totti.\n23:8 Comment: Novices, Roma.\n23:15 Comment: Actually, this wonderful dark-skinned guy.\n23:20 Comment: With such, by the way, a rather serious, adult expression on his face.\n23:28 Comment: This is the same Gerson, purchased in Brazil for very decent money.\n23:34 Comment: Gerson, who, I think, wants and can flourish in Serie A.\n23:42 Comment: Gerson Santos, 19-year-old central midfielder.\n23:51 Comment: Which Roma acquired from Luminens.\n23:58 Comment: Vedmer.\n24:2 Comment: Dinez is such an active figure in the interactions between football players.\n24:8 Comment: He builds a lot through the right edge.\n24:11 Comment: Well, Ali Adnan is much less active on the left.\n24:16 Comment: He is focused on destruction, because after all, he has the formidable Salah as his rival.\n24:22 Comment: Discount from Zapata. Holfredson is some semblance of either a discount or a blow.\n24:28 Comment: Here I depicted 0-0. 0-0 for Dinez, in my opinion, now everything is going according to plan.\n24:36 Comment: The Fryulians shackle Roma's legs, first of all.\n24:43 Comment: They don't let her play tempo football.\n24:46 Comment: Well, the Romans themselves, I must say, make a lot of unforced mistakes.\n24:51 Comment: Let's call it the language of tennis or volleyball.\n24:57 Comment: Well, football too.\n24:59 Comment: Badu is accelerating, he has the opportunity to pass to Sapati.\n25:5 Comment: There was no whistle.\n25:7 Comment: And Paredes played so well at Baroni.\n25:10 Comment: Look how clean and neat it is.\n25:12 Comment: But if there had been a foul, then I think everyone would have been motivated by the referee to get a yellow card.\n25:19 Comment: El Sharawi on Engolan.\n25:22 Comment: Near Emerson on Engolan.\n25:26 Comment: Well, a foul in the attack by Edin Jack.\n25:29 Comment: In this situation, Samir was crushed.\n25:34 Comment: Bad mistake and watch Paredes' tackle.\n25:38 Comment: Well, friends, an obvious violation of the rules.\n25:43 Comment: An obvious violation of the rules.\n25:46 Comment: It seems to me that in this situation the referee of the meeting simply did not keep up with the episode.\n25:53 Comment: Well, on the other hand, if you didn’t see it, then don’t whistle.\n25:56 Comment: Although, if you didn’t see it, then don’t whistle.\n25:59 Comment: Although, there is such a thing as a judge's instinct.\n26:6 Comment: And in such a situation, it seems to me that Babu was really the first on the ball.\n26:11 Comment: You could feel it.\n26:14 Comment: El Sharawi strikes.\n26:17 Comment: Somehow his activity faded away, although in the first minutes he showed himself well in interaction with Emerson.\n26:24 Comment: In any case, there was some kind of ligature, the attack was on their left flank.\n26:29 Comment: Here's a corner earned.\n26:31 Comment: Not bad, by the way.\n26:33 Comment: Remember, Roma played their first, so far the only corner, it was a pass, and some kind of chewed one from Paredes from the bottom.\n26:42 Comment: And it wasn’t very strong, even he sent the ball there, to the near post.\n26:46 Comment: And then he played naingal with his heel.\n26:47 Comment: It was dangerous.\n26:49 Comment: Here's another pass to the near post.\n26:51 Comment: This is Strotman.\n26:53 Comment: Without a jump, seemingly not attacked by anyone.\n26:56 Comment: He struck, but much higher.\n27:4 Comment: A lot is expected from Roma this season.\n27:7 Comment: The news is also good in terms of transfers.\n27:10 Comment: First of all, it must be said that the Romans bought out the contracts of Salah, El Sherawy, Dzeko, Pirotti.\n27:20 Comment: Now all these players are full members of the team, let's say they are on loan.\n27:29 Comment: Look, Udinese is already ahead in numbers.\n27:32 Comment: The serve is good on Avedmer.\n27:34 Comment: El Sherawy wins the fight against him.\n27:36 Comment: Now we should intercept and try to organize a counterattack.\n27:40 Comment: This is the chance.\n27:42 Comment: There probably aren't many Udinese players there.\n27:44 Comment: The audience feels it too, and they just don't want to play.\n27:47 Comment: And now this is not very good.\n27:49 Comment: Udinese, of course, doesn't want to play.\n27:51 Comment: But he finally got up.\n27:53 Comment: He's already up.\n27:54 Comment: This is the chance.\n27:56 Comment: There probably aren't many Udinese players there.\n27:58 Comment: The public feels it too, urging El Sherawy on.\n28:1 Comment: But there are few recipients, not enough.\n28:3 Comment: Very slowly, somehow viscous Roma.\n28:6 Comment: This isn’t even a counterattack anymore.\n28:9 Comment: Everything, all Udinese, all in their half of the field.\n28:15 Comment: And here the defender Samir Salah puts the body.\n28:22 Comment: Nondel.\n28:24 Comment: Here is Gerson from the newcomers.\n28:29 Comment: Alesson from the international, acquired goalkeeper.\n28:34 Comment: And we remember him from that very match with Porto.\n28:42 Comment: Mario Rui.\n28:44 Comment: Also a character that I really liked in the last seasons of Series A.\n28:50 Comment: Portuguese full-back.\n28:54 Comment: Why not try him too in competition with Emerson.\n28:58 Comment: El Sherawy.\n29:1 Comment: El Sherawy is on short terms with Neingalan.\n29:5 Comment: Emerson.\n29:7 Comment: Emerson has too much movement.\n29:9 Comment: So, in futsal style, he caressed the ball under Butsi’s sole.\n29:13 Comment: Only later did I make the transfer.\n29:16 Comment: What if it were at pace, right away?\n29:18 Comment: I'll close this topic of transfers.\n29:19 Comment: But you see Roma Vermaline.\n29:22 Comment: Paredes too.\n29:26 Comment: An extended lease was taken from Empol.\n29:29 Comment: Sweethearted, Bruno Perez, Facio and Joan Jesus.\n29:33 Comment: Feed.\n29:35 Comment: In general, as always, Roma has a wonderful lineup.\n29:39 Comment: And it seems to me that the team should rather think about parting with someone.\n29:45 Comment: To settle, to balance your statement.\n29:47 Comment: After all, the team had certain problems with financial fireworks.\n29:52 Comment: I'll tell you more than that.\n29:54 Comment: Actually, this is the sale of Miralem Pjanic, and quite quickly.\n29:58 Comment: The transfer itself was completed in just a few days.\n30:3 Comment: Dzeko. It's a free kick. It's wide.\n30:6 Comment: There was an opportunity, of course, to roll back to the left edge.\n30:9 Comment: But Edin in this situation, as a center forward, simply had to deliver some kind of blow in the end.\n30:15 Comment: This may not be the most advantageous position.\n30:18 Comment: Although there are 12 meters to the gate.\n30:26 Comment: The ball came off my foot.\n30:28 Comment: So, Miralem Pjanic was given to Juventus for 32 million.\n30:36 Comment: A big loss, of course.\n30:37 Comment: A player who fully corresponded to Roma's philosophy of play, who was twice the best assistant in the Italian championship.\n30:46 Comment: He was given away.\n30:48 Comment: And thanks to this transfer, again, Roma protected itself from any possible sanctions or claims from Yufa.\n31:7 Comment: And, of course, at this moment, at this moment, of course, Roma, like everyone else,\n31:12 Comment: he is not only in this place, but also in this place, of course, in this place,\n31:16 Comment: He is not only in this place, but also in this place.\n31:19 Comment: And, of course, in this place, he is not only in this place, but also in this place.\n31:50 Comment: Vermaelen to the right edge.\n31:52 Comment: Bruno Perez is here.\n31:54 Comment: You don’t find anything similar with Maicon, the Brazilian Maicon, who, of course, probably spent the best years of his career not in Roma, but in Inter, where he was probably good, even, it seems, the best right-back in the world in some way. the moment when Inter won the Champions League.\n32:15 Comment: So, due to some habits, maneuvers, it also accelerates at speed.\n32:23 Comment: But Maicon, again, if anyone is interested, left Roma as a free agent.\n32:28 Comment: The hit is pretty solid.\n32:31 Comment: And here Jack just did what he was supposed to do according to his status, according to his position.\n32:38 Comment: He just threw off a conveniently soft one in one touch.\n32:41 Comment: Look, firstly, he didn’t get sidelined, secondly, he won the fight, thirdly, he made a very convenient discount not even with his chest, but with his shoulder to Stefan El Sharawi.\n32:51 Comment: El Sharawi shot from under the defender.\n32:54 Comment: And it seemed to be low, it seemed like that, closer to the center, but still this ball, this blow was fraught with a threat.\n33:3 Comment: 34th minute of the first match of the new season of the Italian series.\n33:9 Comment: Roma vs Udinese.\n33:12 Comment: 0-0 so far.\n33:14 Comment: To be honest, I personally expected much brighter football from the Romans.\n33:18 Comment: But we see that there are certain personnel changes and tests.\n33:23 Comment: The Luciano-Spalete laboratory continues to operate.\n33:25 Comment: Well, Udinese is pleasantly impressive.\n33:34 Comment: It surprises, perhaps, even with its composure and organization.\n33:38 Comment: Honestly, with such a lineup, it’s not outstanding.\n33:50 Comment: Jakom na Neingalana.\n33:52 Comment: Neingalana and Roma rolls out.\n33:56 Comment: There is free space.\n33:58 Comment: El Sharawi is on the left.\n34:0 Comment: Salah.\n34:2 Comment: But this transfer is not where the situation requires.\n34:5 Comment: And El Sharawi is the same in the program and answers.\n34:8 Comment: What are you going to do with them?\n34:10 Comment: Salah and El Sharawi, who were the main driving force behind the team's attack during the period when Spalete returned.\n34:19 Comment: They scored and gave away a lot.\n34:25 Comment: Salah, by the way, according to numerous versions of different publications, and so on, was included in theoretical, all kinds of symbolic teams.\n34:39 Comment: Jack was offside here.\n34:42 Comment: About Edin Jack.\n34:44 Comment: You know, of course, what kind of plants and other trees it was compared to during last season.\n34:56 Comment: A lot of misses, just a ton of unrealized chances, including 146%.\n35:6 Comment: There were such chances when you could just walk into an empty goal with the ball, and not necessarily shoot.\n35:14 Comment: And you know, I must say that overall, Jack didn’t have a good last season.\n35:20 Comment: I remember what disgusting games he played in the play-offs for the Bosnian national team against the Irish for the right to compete in the European Championship.\n35:30 Comment: Then everything was not all right with his health and form, and then he moved to Roma.\n35:39 Comment: All these mistakes, spread of rot even from the very demanding Roman public, well, from such an active sector of fans.\n35:49 Comment: And I remember Edin’s interview, he said that the first seasons in new championships are always very difficult for him.\n35:56 Comment: If you look at the statistics, it’s true that in Germany, in England, and in Italy he started out with difficulty.\n36:3 Comment: But then I returned to my certain scoring pace.\n36:9 Comment: Aw! Such a blow, the ball fell off the Spaniards' feet.\n36:15 Comment: Rodrigo De Paul.\n36:32 Comment: The Argentine midfielder was taken from Valencia for almost 5 million euros.\n36:40 Comment: Well, I must say that, of course, technique, of course, the ability to work with the ball, but there are also obvious disadvantages, in particular, impulsiveness.\n36:55 Comment: It happens that he overwhelms it and earns a red one.\n37:0 Comment: Sapatov is gaining cruising speed.\n37:3 Comment: Took me away from Manulas and Parades.\n37:6 Comment: Fafana is, of course, wrong in this story.\n37:12 Comment: But in any case, by the way, the old Dunez was not seen in the attack.\n37:17 Comment: I praised everything and praised this team for half an inning.\n37:20 Comment: But she doesn’t show any counterplay, but there’s also no outstanding game in attack.\n37:37 Comment: Today the team cannot be helped by its best scorer from last season, RTO.\n37:43 Comment: By the way, I remind you, again, I remind you that Antonio Dinatali left Duneza.\n37:54 Comment: This is probably one of the main news for all of Udine.\n37:58 Comment: A legend not only of local football, but of the entire Italian league.\n38:4 Comment: Finally finished.\n38:6 Comment: Remember how he ended last season?\n38:10 Comment: By the way, I had a chance to comment on the bushes.\n38:12 Comment: He scored three goals in his last farewell match.\n38:17 Comment: Hat trick. Scored for every taste.\n38:19 Comment: That is, he transported people in such a way that it was very expensive to watch.\n38:23 Comment: Well, naturally, with tears in my eyes.\n38:24 Comment: There were several laps of honor there.\n38:28 Comment: Back for next season.\n38:31 Comment: But, as it turned out, maybe even in vain.\n38:34 Comment: Last year Dinatali played very little and scored very few goals.\n38:41 Comment: Well, maybe we’ll be able to score a lot again, like Tero did last year.\n38:48 Comment: Tero, I’ll say it again, he’s not showing up today.\n38:53 Comment:  Health problems.\n38:55 Comment: Last season's marder was better.\n38:58 Comment: Udinese manages this standard.\n39:1 Comment: Again, very few attacks.\n39:3 Comment: But of course he doesn't score.\n39:4 Comment: And of course he doesn't score.\n39:6 Comment: But of course he doesn't score.\n39:36 Comment: And it's still an extension.\n39:40 Comment: When performing standard provisions.\n39:42 Comment: But it seems that in some situations it can be simpler.\n39:44 Comment: For example, like this.\n39:46 Comment: Just go to the center.\n39:48 Comment: Even the goalkeeper.\n39:50 Comment: Not just a free kick.\n39:52 Comment: El Sharawi.\n39:54 Comment: Loses balance.\n39:56 Comment: And let's go!\n39:58 Comment:  Go!\n40:0 Comment: Agiman Gbadu is looking somewhere in the middle of the field.\n40:2 Comment: There's Depaul on the flank.\n40:4 Comment: Yes, with the flanks and serves today it’s just some kind of guard.\n40:8 Comment: What's Widmer's, what's Hofrazen's.\n40:12 Comment: And Francesco Totti,\n40:15 Comment: who seems to have come to terms with the role, the status of a player for 15 minutes,\n40:21 Comment: as they say about him in Italy.\n40:23 Comment: Sawah, I won one.\n40:26 Comment: I also came up with such an interesting story.\n40:29 Comment: With this dash into the penalty area.\n40:33 Comment: Well, at least the corner ones.\n40:35 Comment: In corners, of course, Roma has a significant advantage, but it’s no use.\n40:45 Comment: Salah, this Roman Pushkin,\n40:51 Comment: Now he’ll be writing another story of his own.\n40:57 Comment: Poetic football, of course, which Salah showed last year.\n41:1 Comment: It's something with something.\n41:2 Comment: Of course, in the second part of the season I was very productive.\n41:8 Comment: And he didn’t just score and distribute, but did it beautifully every time.\n41:12 Comment: Now he made a pass to the near post,\n41:13 Comment: But Arestis Cornesis controlled everything there, even if the ball hit the barrel.\n41:19 Comment: 42nd minute, end of the first half.\n41:22 Comment: Kornesis leads far ahead on Emerson.\n41:26 Comment: Not the most comfortable pass from Jack.\n41:28 Comment: And Roma is lucky that such a shot ends in a corner.\n41:34 Comment: This is Danilo.\n41:37 Comment: Kornezis probably kicked him at first for putting his foot in such a careless manner,\n41:43 Comment: But most importantly, there is no moment.\n41:47 Comment: This is how football players can't figure it out in Denez.\n41:49 Comment: Also the first one to play the ball.\n41:50 Comment: Serve to Jack, hit.\n41:52 Comment: Now this is more dangerous.\n41:54 Comment:  Why not?\n41:55 Comment: You and I all understand that Roma Spalletti,\n41:58 Comment: This is combinatorics, these are short passes in different directions and different lengths.\n42:6 Comment: But when you have such a head start, such jumping ability, such power,\n42:11 Comment: why not use his trump card?\n42:13 Comment: Why not serve it at the top of your head?\n42:16 Comment: If there are, of course, serving players, and they are in Roma.\n42:20 Comment: And Tamyer then receives slight damage.\n42:26 Comment: Well, he bit off his lip to the left, or someone broke it for him.\n42:30 Comment: Well, this is actually kindergarten, not trauma.\n42:41 Comment: The Roman public is not impressed.\n42:44 Comment: But no further than on Tuesday we’ll be playing sports.\n43:0 Comment: By the way, I quite think I'm real.\n43:8 Comment: I fully think that a sold-out sports match is realistic.\n43:12 Comment: Today we have already started talking about the activity of Roman fans.\n43:17 Comment: Of course they had a very serious conflict,\n43:20 Comment: like the Latso fans too,\n43:24 Comment: with local business authorities,\n43:26 Comment: and then also with the management due to the fact that\n43:29 Comment: They put up barriers and fences on the fan stand.\n43:33 Comment: Even so, they put me in a cage.\n43:36 Comment: Talah, long pass to El Sharawi.\n43:43 Comment: We saw, of course, that in terms of ball control\n43:46 Comment: Roma has very solid advantages.\n43:50 Comment: 65 to 35, but\n43:53 Comment: The quality of these programs is not yet the highest.\n43:56 Comment: You see, this is not the highest level.\n44:0 Comment: El Sharawi is wrong again.\n44:4 Comment: I'd like to see, maybe\n44:9 Comment: in dribbling at him, how he will act\n44:12 Comment: at his speed, when it is necessary\n44:15 Comment: invent something unusual.\n44:30 Comment: Depaul.\n44:36 Comment: Well, such a lazy dance with a ball\n44:39 Comment: from DePaul, and then from Widmer too.\n44:43 Comment: The fun is deeper\n44:46 Comment: at Samir.\n44:49 Comment:  And that is all.\n44:52 Comment: I'm more than sure not for a single minute\n44:55 Comment: will not be added to the main time of the first half.\n44:58 Comment: In this case, in this moment,\n45:1 Comment: I think it will\n45:3 Comment: Very, very interesting taimen.\n45:6 Comment: And I think it will\n45:9 Comment: Very, very interesting taimen.\n45:12 Comment: And I think it will\n45:15 Comment: Very, very interesting taimen.\n45:18 Comment: And I think it will\n45:21 Comment: Very, very interesting taimen.\n45:24 Comment: And I think it will\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Roma will attack and pass the ball very well,\n0:25 Comment: by the way, promising for Bruno Perez.\n0:28 Comment: And having become Roma, I remind you, you’re a happy little collar.\n0:31 Comment: In defense, Emerson, Vermaline, Manolas and Bruno Perez.\n0:38 Comment: Midfielders Strootman, Neingalan, Paredes.\n0:41 Comment: El Sharawi, Dzeko, Salah are in attack.\n0:46 Comment: Udinese has defenders, so let's call them five,\n0:51 Comment: Ali Adnan, Samir, Danilo, Erto and Widmer.\n0:55 Comment: Central midfielders Badu, Holfredsen, Fofana, Depaul, and center-forward Sapat.\n1:6 Comment: Chief referee Marco Debelo, Dmitry Shnyaykin at the microphone.\n1:10 Comment: Nothing has really changed here.\n1:13 Comment: Vermaline is wrong.\n1:16 Comment: Depaul plays with Badu, who plays with Holfredsen.\n1:20 Comment: And again DePaul is playing number ten.\n1:25 Comment: I'll focus on this again.\n1:30 Comment: Sapat could have made this discount a little earlier, Udinese is losing pace in the attack.\n1:34 Comment: However, it already has positional status.\n1:39 Comment: Of course, not everything is good here.\n1:41 Comment: Udinese doesn't have many players who are ready to make an accurate, subtle short pass.\n1:47 Comment: Bruno Perez on his own rails.\n1:49 Comment: It bounces, but here, of course, the pass is too strong.\n1:54 Comment: Neingalan doesn't have time.\n1:57 Comment: I have a feeling that Raj Naingalan’s body is gradually, slowly but surely turning black.\n2:8 Comment: His tattoos are completely varied.\n2:11 Comment: By the way, some time, read some material about what these tattoos mean.\n2:16 Comment: Although, for my taste, the most original and effective are Daniel Dorosi, who is on the bench today.\n2:24 Comment: No Dorosya in the squad, no Totti in the squad, no Joan Jesus in the squad.\n2:33 Comment: Firenze is having fun in the stands.\n2:36 Comment: He was in very good spirits.\n2:39 Comment: But Joan Jesus, at least he's in reserve.\n2:43 Comment: In this program, by the way, there was a scoring chance, probably the brightest.\n2:46 Comment: Near the Cornesis Gate.\n2:48 Comment: We remember that Jack had an episode, but then he didn’t strike.\n2:52 Comment: He's a mouth guard, he's not with the ball.\n2:54 Comment: And here is Salah, with the outside of his foot, so as not to waste time trying to work the ball under his right.\n3:2 Comment: Makes a pass to Neingalan.\n3:5 Comment: Why did Raja turn away?\n3:7 Comment: Why did he turn away from the ball? That's what I don't understand.\n3:10 Comment: Two meters to the gate.\n3:11 Comment: Cornesis has already been won back.\n3:13 Comment: But this is a super chance that Raja does not take advantage of.\n3:18 Comment: And this is the first yellow card of the match.\n3:21 Comment: Instantly, instantly, DiBello takes it out of his pocket.\n3:25 Comment: Because there was simply no reason not to give it.\n3:28 Comment: Samir himself understands, he doesn’t argue, he doesn’t even look at the orbit.\n3:34 Comment: In this situation, he played with the body quite deliberately.\n3:37 Comment: Moreover, I also put up such a barrier, I mean my hand.\n3:41 Comment: A powerful defender who gave Salah some speed.\n3:47 Comment: Which, by the way, is no wonder.\n3:51 Comment: Just go and catch up with Salah.\n3:59 Comment: So, pitch from Bruno Perez.\n4:4 Comment: So, neither two nor one and a half served Emerson.\n4:7 Comment: Emerson, yes, of course, shifted from his left foot to the right edge.\n4:13 Comment: Well, here you see, again according to the principle that the ball should spin towards the goal.\n4:19 Comment: From the left foot there, closer to the frame.\n4:23 Comment: Well, for now, again, this abundance of standard provisions\n4:28 Comment: It's just not enough.\n4:30 Comment: Abundance of set pieces.\n4:33 Comment: Minimum use.\n4:35 Comment: Nothing survives from these episodes.\n4:40 Comment: Perez.\n4:42 Comment: It's interesting that Roma got injured during training.\n4:45 Comment: This is where Salah has his moment.\n4:47 Comment: Discount on Jack.\n4:48 Comment: And here again, it seems, this coach of the central defender manages everything.\n4:53 Comment: But the problem is this.\n4:55 Comment: Where exactly is Ali Adnan?\n4:57 Comment: Here they showed us a close-up.\n5:0 Comment: Where does he actually travel?\n5:2 Comment: Maybe he didn’t even take the field, although it seems like they gave him a close-up.\n5:9 Comment: Stayed in the locker room.\n5:11 Comment: In general, it still seems to me that Ali Adnan, if I’m not on the Olimpico lawn,\n5:16 Comment: because he missed three attacks in a row from the 45th to the 50th minute on his flank.\n5:23 Comment: Here, of course, Bruno Perez commits atrocities.\n5:27 Comment: And it feels like we will have our first match with a substitution.\n5:35 Comment: It seems to me that Tamara Ertou has something wrong with her ligamentous apparatus.\n5:48 Comment: And sharp, so painful injuries occur precisely in heaps with ligaments.\n5:54 Comment: So as to immediately refuse to continue the game.\n5:58 Comment: By the way, he gave up rape, as far as I understand, he is French.\n6:4 Comment: Well, number four enters the field.\n6:9 Comment: Also defender Gabriele Angelo.\n6:13 Comment: Italian.\n6:17 Comment: With very decent data, by the way, 190 centimeters tall.\n6:21 Comment: Should help, including on standards.\n6:23 Comment: And again this play, when a pass is made to the near post.\n6:29 Comment: And again Neingaland is trying somehow so original with his heel\n6:34 Comment: to break the movement of the ball in this direction of the goalkeeper.\n6:39 Comment: Well, by the way, while performing this trick, he also managed to hurt Badu.\n6:43 Comment: Yes, you know, Tama Erto is a very serious loss for Ludinez.\n6:47 Comment: Leader.\n6:49 Comment: One of the leaders of the defense.\n6:51 Comment: And, by the way, an extremely useful person on standards.\n6:54 Comment: And I mean the goal standards of one and the other team.\n6:59 Comment: Erto scores them with his head a lot.\n7:2 Comment: Well, maybe Angelo will take up his cause.\n7:7 Comment: Tama Erto, of course, we wish you a speedy recovery.\n7:12 Comment: I don’t know, maybe it just happened that way, but for some reason it’s on the topic of injuries.\n7:18 Comment: The director, and maybe this was done deliberately, grabbed Kevin Strotman.\n7:23 Comment: Who, if not him, should know what torment is.\n7:27 Comment: Everyday, long, short, short, short, short\n7:33 Comment: Everyday, long, difficult because you can't play football due to injury.\n7:44 Comment: I love this story very much, I’ll get tired of repeating it.\n7:47 Comment: The way Kevin Strotman was supported in Italy.\n7:50 Comment: And, by the way, not only Roma fans.\n7:52 Comment: The flash mob was launched.\n7:54 Comment: We had to take a photo with the washing machine.\n7:59 Comment: Well, write something there to support Kevin Strotman.\n8:4 Comment: We'll decipher this flash mob a little later.\n8:7 Comment: And then Dzeko Karnezis delivers into the penalty area!\n8:13 Comment: Awesome safe from the Greek goalkeeper.\n8:18 Comment: Come on, where are the Dzeko haters?\n8:21 Comment: They're climbing out of all the cracks again.\n8:23 Comment: But guys, how Karnezis played.\n8:25 Comment: Edin did everything right.\n8:27 Comment: Counter the goalkeeper.\n8:29 Comment: But this long-armed, powerful goalkeeper works wonders.\n8:36 Comment: Runo Perez is slowly starting up Olimpico.\n8:40 Comment: Let him go without his fan core.\n8:45 Comment: One more blow.\n8:51 Comment: Well, Roma started very well in this half.\n8:55 Comment: Diversity is attacking.\n8:56 Comment: And there are long-range strikes, and some kind of flanking initiatives.\n9:0 Comment: And, of course, Karnezis's shiny safe.\n9:3 Comment: Nice pass from Emerson.\n9:5 Comment: Dzeko hits in the opposite direction, reaching for the ball.\n9:8 Comment: But it may not be ideal, of course.\n9:10 Comment: Not in the very corner.\n9:13 Comment: Of course, ideally he should have cut under the bar somewhere.\n9:19 Comment: But it seems to me that in this situation the forward is not so much to blame,\n9:23 Comment: how good a goalkeeper is.\n9:32 Comment: And yet, it's still Edin Dzeko and his promo.\n9:37 Comment: They laugh at him, of course, in Italy.\n9:39 Comment: But I’ll repeat, yes, I already forgot this topic in the first half,\n9:41 Comment: that the first seasons are difficult for him.\n9:45 Comment: He scored a little in England, and in Germany, and in Italy at first.\n9:48 Comment: But then, after the first serious training camp,\n9:53 Comment: after adapting to the speeds in the league,\n9:56 Comment: One way or another, he is already starting to demonstrate his previous performance.\n10:3 Comment: I think it will be the same this season.\n10:7 Comment: Service again in Dzeko's direction.\n10:13 Comment: Diego Pirotti is on the bench and we...\n10:17 Comment: Ha ha ha!\n10:19 Comment: Honestly, I didn't see him change his clothes.\n10:23 Comment:  That's funny.\n10:26 Comment:  Like this.\n10:28 Comment: We just started talking about the Argentine attacking midfielder.\n10:33 Comment: Literally two seconds later they snatch him away.\n10:37 Comment: Diego Pirotti is on the bench, it's time for him to come on.\n10:39 Comment: And that's what I wanted to say.\n10:41 Comment: I was thinking about last year\n10:43 Comment: Pirotti probably played one of the defining roles in the end.\n10:50 Comment: A football player who creates amazing volumes in the middle of the field.\n10:54 Comment: And with him in the lineup, Roma played without central forwards.\n11:0 Comment: That is, they acted on the flanks of Salah and Sharawi,\n11:2 Comment: They took turns moving into the forward position.\n11:7 Comment: Well, Pirotti was rampaging in the middle of the field.\n11:9 Comment: He certainly has great speed.\n11:12 Comment: The pass is in perfect order.\n11:14 Comment: Well, maybe he’ll shoot from the penalty area, mom, don’t worry.\n11:18 Comment: Standard near Chenston Gate.\n11:23 Comment: Bad delivery. And here's Angela.\n11:27 Comment: Again on Niva Rto.\n11:31 Comment: It was dangerous.\n11:33 Comment: Maybe it was just static, the defender was hitting.\n11:36 Comment: And the ball flew for a long time.\n11:38 Comment: And yet, I think it made me nervous.\n11:41 Comment: And El Sharawi leaves the field.\n11:43 Comment: That's the story.\n11:45 Comment:  Who would have thought.\n11:47 Comment: Stefan El Sharawi.\n11:49 Comment: I don’t remember such a tattoo on Pirotti’s neck.\n11:53 Comment: Turns out it's contagious.\n11:55 Comment: Well, I spent half a season with Neingalan.\n12:0 Comment: And little by little he also began to blacken.\n12:4 Comment:  Anyway.\n12:5 Comment: It's still a trend.\n12:8 Comment: Perez.\n12:9 Comment: Inaccurate pass to Dzeko.\n12:18 Comment: Neingalan.\n12:21 Comment: So far, in my opinion, I’ve never really unsheathed my gun.\n12:24 Comment: I hit it once, but higher.\n12:25 Comment: Pirotti makes a discount.\n12:26 Comment: And here comes the blow.\n12:27 Comment: From Paredes, however, not from Neingalan.\n12:30 Comment: Midboard Jack.\n12:31 Comment: Won a great fight for Salah.\n12:33 Comment: Salah ignored Bruno Perez.\n12:35 Comment: Only now the ball has risen for him.\n12:36 Comment: Shoot!\n12:37 Comment: Ricochet!\n12:38 Comment: And takes the ball out of the empty goal.\n12:40 Comment: One of the defenders, this is Widmer.\n12:42 Comment: Can you imagine?\n12:43 Comment: Like this, from the right edge.\n12:44 Comment: So he narrowed the area.\n12:46 Comment: And he appeared right at the gate.\n12:47 Comment: Another pitch from Strotman.\n12:49 Comment: Roma took charge.\n12:50 Comment: Perez.\n12:51 Comment: He hesitates in this situation.\n12:52 Comment: There is an opportunity to run into a counterattack at Dinese.\n12:55 Comment: There's an option on the left for DePaul.\n12:57 Comment: He uses it.\n12:59 Comment: This is Zapata.\n13:0 Comment: He will try to beat one on one.\n13:2 Comment:  Or not?\n13:4 Comment: Greek Manulas.\n13:6 Comment: Well, a very weak solution.\n13:8 Comment: It seems to me that Zapata is also distant now.\n13:12 Comment: Far from ideal form.\n13:16 Comment: Salah is picking up speed.\n13:18 Comment: Pass to Edin Jack, who loses the fight to Danilo.\n13:24 Comment: The position loses first.\n13:30 Comment: Salah.\n13:31 Comment: Well, that's the kind of feint he uses with his hands.\n13:33 Comment: He showed that he would make a pass to the far post.\n13:36 Comment: Played through the center.\n13:37 Comment: But the ball still got here.\n13:39 Comment: Outline.\n13:40 Comment: Emerson from Jack.\n13:41 Comment: This is the situation.\n13:43 Comment: Of course, I won't praise the forward.\n13:45 Comment: He had to break into the first pace.\n13:49 Comment: But in a game like this, if Roma doesn’t let go of Dinese’s grip,\n13:55 Comment: Then, I think, the same Jack should score.\n13:58 Comment: Roma as a whole should score.\n14:1 Comment: Dinese is still extremely attentive.\n14:7 Comment: And in some episodes he even desperately defends himself.\n14:12 Comment: By the way, they didn't give a repeat there.\n14:14 Comment: But, yes, this moment.\n14:16 Comment: That's the combination.\n14:18 Comment: Perez is walking sharply.\n14:20 Comment: And I think it’s unlikely that the ball would have gone into the goal right away.\n14:24 Comment: It's just that there was a Roma player there at the far post.\n14:27 Comment: And he was ready to correct the ball.\n14:31 Comment: Manalas shows with his eyes where to serve.\n14:35 Comment: How many standards does Roma have today, huh?\n14:38 Comment: No, corners, free kicks.\n14:43 Comment: And everything is close to the penalty area.\n14:47 Comment: Why not punch Mohammed?\n14:50 Comment: Canopy!\n14:54 Comment: And he brushed this ball almost off Vermaline’s head from the opaque.\n15:0 Comment: Helped, came in handy, smart girl.\n15:8 Comment: Please note, every time Roma takes corners,\n15:11 Comment: Well, except that Paredes, remember, served alone once in the first half.\n15:16 Comment: But there are always two players.\n15:18 Comment: Feed.\n15:20 Comment: And the big question here is whether the Udinians are ready for this,\n15:25 Comment: Or maybe it's just a distraction.\n15:28 Comment: But they always place one player, not far from the corner taker.\n15:33 Comment: Therefore, perhaps there is no particular reason to play in uniform.\n15:42 Comment: Perotti, Perotti cuts the corner and manages to make a pass.\n15:46 Comment: Salah makes an allowance and handles the ball softly.\n15:49 Comment: Kick from Perez. Salah free kick again.\n15:52 Comment: And the deflecting blow is already past the cash register.\n15:56 Comment: Roma gives a great segment.\n15:58 Comment: These 15 minutes are like a breeze.\n16:1 Comment: But there is no goal.\n16:3 Comment: In this situation, the worst thing for Udinese is that, no, the ball did not completely leave the field.\n16:8 Comment: We see that in his projection he slightly touched this line, caught it.\n16:16 Comment: The worst thing for Udinese in this situation is not to counter at all.\n16:20 Comment: And we see that this wave is never extinguished.\n16:23 Comment: And it rolls and rolls on poor Kornesis.\n16:28 Comment: A very strong goalkeeper, Udinese has a very strong goalkeeper.\n16:32 Comment: And Simone Skoufet is still on the bench.\n16:35 Comment: The same young schoolboy, just a child, a child who showed off two seasons ago.\n16:41 Comment: All of Italy started talking about him, as the new Bufon, about the future of the Italian national team, and so on.\n16:49 Comment: Moreover, it’s the first player there in many, many decades to be a goalkeeper on the roster.\n16:57 Comment: Yes, Paul, look what he's doing.\n17:2 Comment: And by the way, the selection is also his.\n17:4 Comment: Strothman is washing it here.\n17:10 Comment: Well, ending the topic, Skufet is still on the bench.\n17:13 Comment: And it seems to me that it’s time to loan him out, because such talent cannot waste away.\n17:19 Comment: He is already Donoruma, a similar talent, yes, appeared in Milan, and he plays.\n17:25 Comment: And Skufet is still under Kornezis, to whom there are very few claims.\n17:31 Comment: Well, since Strotman played well in the previous episode, I would finish this story about the washing machine.\n17:39 Comment: The point was that they once called Kevin Strotman a washing machine.\n17:52 Comment: The fact is that, in my opinion, either the Roma coach, or one of the journalists,\n17:59 Comment: he acts like a washing machine, takes dirty balls in difficult situations,\n18:4 Comment: not the most convenient transfers, processes them and makes them absolutely such clean, comfortable situations.\n18:10 Comment: It's a convenient pass to Dzeko, he gets it in the legs and it's a 11-meter kick.\n18:16 Comment: Dzheko got hit in the legs, the assistant referee was very close by.\n18:22 Comment: Well, he saw everything here before his eyes, and I think it’s typical that Danilov is the team captain,\n18:28 Comment: Who, in principle, is such an emotional guy, he doesn’t argue at all.\n18:34 Comment: And Bruno Perez becomes the co-author of this effective attack.\n18:38 Comment: And we, in turn, note that Dzeko was offside.\n18:41 Comment: In my opinion, this is clearly evidenced by the repetition.\n18:45 Comment: It was offside.\n18:50 Comment: Here there is a hit on the ankle.\n18:53 Comment: Well, let's see, Diego Perotti is near the ball.\n18:56 Comment: Maybe he’ll hit it with his cheek, like the one tattooed on his neck.\n19:4 Comment: An original run-up and a goal. 1-0. 1-0. The first goal of the new season of the Italian championship.\n19:13 Comment: Scored from the left penalty spot.\n19:19 Comment: Somehow it's even characteristic.\n19:22 Comment: Keeping in mind that this penalty is from the left, I'm talking first of all about the fact that Dzeko was offside.\n19:28 Comment: And, of course, in this situation it was necessary to raise the crap.\n19:34 Comment: But this is how Diego Perotti Cornesis deceives with his predatory gaze.\n19:40 Comment: Looks to the left corner. Accelerates very slowly.\n19:44 Comment: So he doesn’t even run up, but approaches the ball and sends the ball with his right foot.\n19:50 Comment: Not even so much in the corner as in the opposite direction of the goal.\n19:55 Comment: I noticed another tattoo there on Perotti. Another ten on his forearm.\n20:6 Comment: Well, he has a different number on his back.\n20:8 Comment: You understand, in order to loudly get a ten, you probably need to wait until the moment when...\n20:16 Comment: Wait, probably, for the moment when Francesco Totti will be the Gray-haired Grandfather.\n20:24 Comment: Dinez is preparing a substitution. 1-0.\n20:27 Comment: Well, you and I assumed that if the Udinians did not establish some kind of counter-game,\n20:33 Comment: at least they won't try to push the game away from their own goal,\n20:39 Comment: Then everything will come to this.\n20:41 Comment: Because there was a lot of pressure.\n20:46 Comment: It seems to me... Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!\n20:49 Comment: Here is their lucky one... Well, we know that he seems to be an unreliable goalkeeper,\n20:53 Comment: but from time to time there are some eccentricities behind him.\n20:56 Comment: He's following this Garik Kharlaun.\n20:59 Comment: Even when he played at Arsenal, he missed ridiculous goals a couple of times during the season.\n21:7 Comment: But I must say, he spent last season at the highest level.\n21:11 Comment: Well, here too, I think so.\n21:13 Comment: Plays with his fist. No problem for the Pole.\n21:16 Comment: Vedmeer. Vedmeer. The pitch is too low.\n21:20 Comment: And in this situation, of course, it was possible to suggest a partner.\n21:24 Comment: I didn’t see who kicked the ball, but no one pushed, no one pulled.\n21:28 Comment: You could have processed it and rushed into a counterattack.\n21:33 Comment: Roma has a goalkeeper Alison, defenders Joan Jesus, Mustafa Seck, Federico Facio.\n21:43 Comment: Listen, what kind of reserve does Roma have, huh?\n21:46 Comment: Well, here two compositions can be invented, and absolutely equal.\n21:51 Comment: Ricardo Marchica, midfielders Daniel Dorosi, Federico Ritchie.\n21:59 Comment: Juan Turbo and Francesco Totti, well, these are probably strikers.\n22:3 Comment: Dinese has goalkeeper Skufed, defenders Pablo Armero, Philippe, Edo Nielsen.\n22:10 Comment: Midfielders Yavkuk and Yangto, Francesco Low Dimp, forward Lucas Evangelista.\n22:20 Comment: Well, here, in fact, are Adalbert and Francesco Totti.\n22:26 Comment: Having watched enough of Messi or already, I don’t know who, maybe some Japanese cartoons.\n22:31 Comment: But it's something out of an anime now, according to the Venezuelan forward, a newcomer to the team.\n22:38 Comment: For some reason it seemed to me that I could try some pepper.\n22:41 Comment: Rider Matos is also languishing on the bench, but now he's a newbie.\n22:44 Comment: And that, in fact, is probably all.\n22:47 Comment: Well, actually, that’s probably all.\n22:50 Comment:  Confidence.\n22:52 Comment: 68th minute. Serve!\n22:54 Comment: And how does Manulas, who is not being attacked by anyone, hit in this situation?\n23:0 Comment: Very difficult to understand.\n23:2 Comment: Well, here, of course, the guests screwed up outside the game.\n23:6 Comment: Yes, we're late.\n23:8 Comment: Well, Ovsai was here.\n23:10 Comment: Well, Ovsai was here too.\n23:20 Comment: Moreover, Manulas was also among those who supported this imaginary line...\n23:25 Comment: Hello, judge!\n23:27 Comment: What's going on with the young man sitting on the edge?\n23:31 Comment: By the way, there is another injured person here.\n23:33 Comment: What are you going to do today?\n23:36 Comment: Too much trouble for the defensive line.\n23:39 Comment: The second central defender is experiencing health problems.\n23:44 Comment: Manulas.\n23:50 Comment: In this situation, Orestis Kornezis was already glued to a ribbon.\n23:54 Comment: He didn’t go out anywhere and, in my opinion, he even gave up.\n23:57 Comment: Because, well, if Manulas got hit, there would be no chance to react.\n24:8 Comment: Orestis is active.\n24:11 Comment: Hispanic.\n24:12 Comment: And here it is, a pass to Salah.\n24:13 Comment: Salah in this situation.\n24:15 Comment:  Hit.\n24:16 Comment: I think Salah sometimes looks for the better of the good.\n24:20 Comment: Roma tried to realize this numerical majority,\n24:23 Comment: While they were helping Samir there.\n24:26 Comment: If they give us a repeat.\n24:28 Comment: There was an opportunity to take a short pause and wait for Perez.\n24:32 Comment: He could have attacked the goal from a much more comfortable angle.\n24:37 Comment: Yeah, okay.\n24:38 Comment: In any case, Roma does not let out of this trap with Dinez.\n24:43 Comment: And we don’t see, again, Dinez in the attack at all.\n24:47 Comment:  At all.\n24:50 Comment: Salah.\n24:53 Comment: Center of the transmission field.\n24:54 Comment: Strohman is here.\n24:57 Comment: Wider.\n24:58 Comment: Emerson.\n25:3 Comment: Well, not really.\n25:4 Comment: But, in principle, it would be very good.\n25:7 Comment: In this match, I prefer the way Bruno Perez debuts.\n25:13 Comment: Ex-defender of Torino.\n25:15 Comment: It's interesting that Florence wasn't the only one injured,\n25:19 Comment: but also Therasidis, the Greek defender, is another right-back.\n25:23 Comment: That is, both main, well, let's say, first and second choice numbers\n25:29 Comment: In the right-back position, Spalletti found himself out of the game.\n25:34 Comment: And here comes Bruno Perez's chance.\n25:36 Comment: Of course, the competition in some positions is amazing.\n25:41 Comment: On the defensive, huh?\n25:43 Comment:  How many people.\n25:44 Comment: Here Joan Jesus was acquired from Inter.\n25:47 Comment: Here's Federico Fassio.\n25:49 Comment: Here's Manulas Vermaelen.\n26:1 Comment:  Hard.\n26:3 Comment: It's hard for Penerand to get into the game.\n26:8 Comment: Well, Roma is still on the move.\n26:10 Comment: Here Jack might even be right.\n26:12 Comment: Takes a short pause.\n26:14 Comment: Now it's time for Roma.\n26:16 Comment: It goes, it flows.\n26:20 Comment: Now they understand that they are absolutely the rightful masters of the situation.\n26:26 Comment: Of course, I can’t part with this thought about this finale.\n26:33 Comment: I would have to fight my way too.\n26:38 Comment: Folk, of course, in my opinion, there was.\n26:40 Comment: But this very off-site and then another mistake.\n26:44 Comment: The referee just really, really doesn't want to.\n26:47 Comment: Oh, Zapata. No! There is no offside.\n26:49 Comment: Strike position.\n26:51 Comment: Why not immediately to the left?\n26:53 Comment: The Colombian also has problems with confidence.\n26:58 Comment: Good, good.\n26:59 Comment: The first one is probably more or less spicy.\n27:1 Comment: In any case, with such a penetrating acute transmission.\n27:3 Comment: Dinez's attack in the second half.\n27:5 Comment: And we already have 18 minutes left.\n27:8 Comment: It's a little late for us to recover.\n27:9 Comment: But, however, nothing is lost yet.\n27:18 Comment: 9 against 4.\n27:19 Comment: Emil Holfredson.\n27:22 Comment: Icelandic central midfielder.\n27:27 Comment: We know, of course.\n27:29 Comment: There's such a focus on Icelandic football as a whole.\n27:34 Comment: After what happened at the Euro.\n27:50 Comment: Out.\n27:52 Comment: Manos.\n27:53 Comment: Well, by the way, he’s one of those who doesn’t really like to invent things either.\n27:57 Comment: And if there is an opportunity to defuse the situation, he will do it.\n28:0 Comment: Neranda.\n28:6 Comment: Looking at the newcomer.\n28:8 Comment: Well, he's still trying to get used to it.\n28:10 Comment: Works with the ball.\n28:14 Comment: He even has dribbling ability.\n28:19 Comment: Meet, meet.\n28:20 Comment: These are all new faces.\n28:23 Comment: Which will make this season bright and unforgettable for us, I hope.\n28:31 Comment: And most of all I want it to be intriguing.\n28:35 Comment: At least with some kind of fight for the championship.\n28:38 Comment: No, here, again, I turned away.\n28:41 Comment: Yes, maybe the hand was in a not entirely natural position.\n28:44 Comment: But it's still enough.\n28:48 Comment: That's enough for a free kick.\n28:51 Comment: Perez is wrong.\n28:53 Comment: And now comes the chance.\n28:54 Comment: Angela is out there somewhere.\n28:56 Comment: Tall, good serve.\n28:58 Comment: But no one came all the way.\n29:0 Comment: Perotti, Perotti Elgago.\n29:2 Comment: Barzai is his nickname.\n29:4 Comment: And he runs forward like Barzai.\n29:7 Comment: Pass to Salahana.\n29:9 Comment: And this is a clear penalty.\n29:12 Comment: Unambiguous.\n29:13 Comment: The other thing is that it's not a red card.\n29:15 Comment: We are once again reminded of the new rules.\n29:20 Comment:  What's happened?\n29:26 Comment: Let's see.\n29:28 Comment: Spun this attack at speed.\n29:30 Comment: Here, he wins the fight.\n29:34 Comment: So it was.\n29:35 Comment: The hand was placed on Salah's back.\n29:37 Comment: This push.\n29:40 Comment:  Here.\n29:42 Comment: It's movement.\n29:43 Comment: Movement trajectories crossed.\n29:46 Comment: And yet, yes, yes.\n29:47 Comment: A clear penalty.\n29:48 Comment:  It's enough.\n29:49 Comment: Well, some would say there was nowhere to go.\n29:52 Comment: To the Udinese player.\n29:53 Comment: And yet, he failed.\n29:55 Comment: Perotti.\n29:56 Comment: 2-0.\n29:59 Comment: Curious, huh?\n30:1 Comment: Diego Perotti, who, in fact, will not play even half.\n30:5 Comment: In this match he becomes the goal scorer.\n30:9 Comment: Well, actually, in any case, yes.\n30:12 Comment: Penalty.\n30:13 Comment: First of all, we need to score him.\n30:14 Comment: But we don’t forget that it was Perotti who picked up the ball.\n30:19 Comment: I ran a good few meters, well, about 60.\n30:21 Comment: Before, by the way, you give a very sensible transmission to the salon.\n30:24 Comment: Well, again, you know, in the army nadho style.\n30:29 Comment: Well, there are other such performers.\n30:31 Comment: Blatelier, for example, is among those who wait until the last minute.\n30:35 Comment: And it hits the goalkeeper.\n30:37 Comment: Perotti is among them for the second time he beat the goalkeeper.\n30:42 Comment: Once again, an important topic, friends, is that...\n30:45 Comment: So that you don't get confused in the future, don't be surprised, and so on.\n30:49 Comment: Why isn't there a red card here?\n30:51 Comment: Just a reminder that the rules have changed.\n30:53 Comment: Joan Jesus enters the field.\n30:55 Comment: This, by the way, is also a landmark episode.\n30:58 Comment: Ex-Nerazzuri player makes his debut in the Italian Championship for Roma.\n31:4 Comment: Ex-Inter player.\n31:5 Comment: In general, it often happens that one player played for both Roma and Inter.\n31:15 Comment: There are many examples.\n31:16 Comment: Okay, I'll finish this topic about the penalty.\n31:19 Comment: This triple punishment story has been cancelled.\n31:23 Comment: If a penalty is awarded, there is no red card shown, just a yellow one.\n31:31 Comment: At the same time, if outside the penalty violation of the rules,\n31:36 Comment: but there is an opportunity to attack the goal very sharply,\n31:41 Comment: Then a free kick is given and a red card is shown.\n31:47 Comment: These are the nuances.\n31:48 Comment: Holfredson 2-0, Roma ahead.\n31:51 Comment: The serve into the penalty area was good, by the way.\n31:54 Comment: Where are these serves, where were all these passes during the course of more than half of the players?\n32:6 Comment: Yes, we see that Dinez had enough for a maximum of one half today.\n32:10 Comment: Non-stop attacks right after the break.\n32:13 Comment: And I attribute this not so much to the team’s work in defense,\n32:17 Comment: how much with the attack.\n32:18 Comment: This attack does not exist, so Roma is humiliated by those in power.\n32:27 Comment: Although it may be said loudly.\n32:29 Comment: However, the benefits are, I think, stated.\n32:34 Comment: Dinez will have one more replacement.\n32:37 Comment: And this is Seko Fafana.\n32:39 Comment: Today the newcomer is powerful.\n32:41 Comment: Rodrigo De Pauw.\n32:43 Comment: According to Rodrigo, we can say that, in principle, the pausa culture is quite decent,\n32:49 Comment: but there are very few aggravating transfers.\n32:51 Comment: But he acts in a position where he is obliged to invent it.\n33:0 Comment: I think that the same Fafana, in principle, deserved a couple of kind words.\n33:5 Comment: But, you see, the good Fafan gave him and his team Roma a blow.\n33:11 Comment: And how many minor injuries will we have today?\n33:14 Comment: Fafana, by the way, is leaving the field.\n33:16 Comment: Lodi, experienced Lodi.\n33:19 Comment: A favorite of Sicilian fans.\n33:22 Comment:  And not only.\n33:27 Comment: This, by the way, is the footballer whose quality, perhaps, was lacking during this game.\n33:35 Comment: Lodi is still capable of making an accurate pass.\n33:38 Comment: His standards are, of course, excellent.\n33:43 Comment: Francesco Lodi played 24 matches last season.\n33:46 Comment: I only scored one goal.\n33:48 Comment: In general, the story of this Neapolitan is quite, well, traditional.\n33:55 Comment: When great talent at the level of maybe not the most grandiose teams showed something.\n34:1 Comment: He was even a leader.\n34:2 Comment: One can remember that he was a leader.\n34:4 Comment: But, basically, he wasn't.\n34:6 Comment: Well, and then...\n34:8 Comment: Then it farts, farts, fades.\n34:11 Comment: Where are all these standards, penalties, mind-blowing.\n34:15 Comment:  Anyway.\n34:16 Comment: Maybe Lodi can do something with the remaining time.\n34:21 Comment: Manoise, he's leaving the field.\n34:23 Comment: Thorn replacement.\n34:24 Comment: And meet me.\n34:36 Comment: As far as I understand, Mustafa Seck is entering the field.\n34:43 Comment: No, this is Facio.\n34:44 Comment:  I am sorry.\n34:45 Comment: I didn't recognize it in the makeup.\n34:47 Comment: With that beard.\n34:49 Comment: This is Facio.\n34:53 Comment: Famous football player.\n34:55 Comment: First of all, due to the times of performance in Spain.\n35:0 Comment: Well, again, all that remains here is to wish good health to Manualas.\n35:7 Comment: Which, you see, how Roma’s defensive line is changing.\n35:10 Comment: And Manualas is in place.\n35:13 Comment: Ofersen fails.\n35:14 Comment: Facio immediately makes, well, a bad pass in the direction of Salah.\n35:18 Comment: But processing this transmission was difficult.\n35:21 Comment: The ball is flying from behind.\n35:22 Comment: I've had enough.\n35:23 Comment: Yes, that’s, of course, what kind of puzzles Spalletti will have.\n35:28 Comment: Spalletti won't let Toti out.\n35:30 Comment: But this is a forced replacement.\n35:32 Comment: I think Toti would have appeared on the field if not for the injury of the central defender.\n35:49 Comment: Lots of substitutions.\n35:52 Comment: Lots of transfer topics.\n35:54 Comment: In general, I must say, well, now the game, of course, has reduced the pace a little.\n35:59 Comment: Everything is clear here.\n36:0 Comment: I don’t even know what needs to happen for Dinezo to come to his senses and show us at least something interesting.\n36:10 Comment: Here Jack plays a good role as a dispatcher.\n36:13 Comment: Usually, of course, we know what the story is.\n36:16 Comment: The story of Dinezo.\n36:17 Comment: What did this team live for.\n36:19 Comment: And, in principle, she didn’t live badly.\n36:21 Comment: You yourself understand that a few seasons ago the Roma match at Dinezo would probably have been the central taste.\n36:27 Comment: Well, it’s true that there are a lot of measures against the backdrop of the event with Ferritti.\n36:32 Comment:  Nevertheless.\n36:33 Comment: But there is a feeling that the company Potz and the group, which is the owner of Dinezo.\n36:42 Comment: Well, Giampaulo Potz himself, who owns a Spanish grenade, Watford English and Dinezo.\n36:49 Comment:  Oh oh oh!\n36:50 Comment: Edin Dzeko still scores.\n36:53 Comment: What a pass Rajan Ingalam is throwing.\n36:57 Comment: A miracle transfer from a Belgian.\n37:0 Comment: Miracle transmission.\n37:1 Comment: Well, you see.\n37:2 Comment: I told you that he still has to score against Edin Dzeko.\n37:5 Comment: Like all of Roma in general.\n37:7 Comment: He will find his chance.\n37:11 Comment:  Look.\n37:12 Comment: This is a real, I would even say, not a football freestyle.\n37:20 Comment: This is some kind of underground dancing.\n37:24 Comment: The ball slipped between the opponent's legs.\n37:27 Comment: Ingalam fought to the end for this episode, for this ball.\n37:32 Comment: And a luxurious, perfect pass.\n37:35 Comment: This is how you had to navigate here in order to play the ball to Dzeko’s partner like that.\n37:42 Comment: We know he's had problems.\n37:44 Comment: I already talked about this when we were sorting things out with an empty net.\n37:48 Comment: But he didn't miss here.\n37:52 Comment: 3-0.\n37:53 Comment: Edin Dzeko.\n37:54 Comment: First goal of the season for him.\n37:56 Comment: Perotti double.\n37:58 Comment: Roma is doing brilliantly in the second half.\n38:1 Comment: But questions still remain.\n38:3 Comment: What happened to her in the first half?\n38:5 Comment: If, let's say, she gets to a team that can hold out for more than a half.\n38:13 Comment: Well, I'll finish this topic.\n38:15 Comment: Apparently, they are still betting on the English Premier League, on Watford.\n38:20 Comment: And worldwide sweat.\n38:21 Comment: That’s why Dinez has a little less money, a little less of some flashy purchases.\n38:27 Comment: Whereas before this team acquired young, talented football players and then sold them for decent money.\n38:35 Comment: Now even more experienced players have begun to appear more often, who will even allow the team to remain in the series.\n38:44 Comment: Salah scores here too.\n38:47 Comment: But guys, what did Cornesi do again?\n38:50 Comment: Here, of course, the entire defense is broken.\n38:54 Comment: It's not even happening at the seams.\n38:57 Comment: It's just torn at the narrow point.\n39:1 Comment: And I just feel sorry for Kornezis.\n39:3 Comment: Salah scores.\n39:4 Comment: The flight strikes.\n39:5 Comment: Yes, straight to Cornesis.\n39:6 Comment: But if you go there, you’ll choose the right position.\n39:10 Comment: Kornesis is dragging the ball.\n39:12 Comment: But Salah was the first to finish.\n39:14 Comment: Danila still has some half-position here.\n39:16 Comment: It’s unclear how he met this episode like that.\n39:19 Comment: Why didn't you hit it?\n39:21 Comment: I just stood there.\n39:22 Comment: 4-0. 4-0.\n39:25 Comment: I admit it myself, I thought during the break that this would end well.\n39:29 Comment: There could be another 2-0, 1-0 or 2-0.\n39:32 Comment: But now Roma, having gained momentum, resembles the team that appeared last season.\n39:38 Comment: This is actually Roman history.\n39:41 Comment: Catch the courage and put pressure on your opponent, and then play your role.\n39:53 Comment: Let's hear them sing.\n39:58

Comment: I mean Roma fans.\n40:28 Comment: Well, just like the Roma players, actually.\n40:32 Comment: Today the answer lies with Juventus, but it will be more difficult for them.\n40:35 Comment: Randa, hit, ricochet, but not in place here now.\n40:39 Comment: It will be more difficult for him.\n40:41 Comment: This is Ferentina.\n40:43 Comment: Ferentina has also updated herself a bit.\n40:46 Comment: And she, of course, is seen by a team with a much more serious resource than the current Uzinov.\n40:53 Comment: Yes, maybe if there was Rom...\n41:0 Comment: Well, I have admitted more than once that I have sympathy for this French striker.\n41:4 Comment: If he were today, maybe even paired with Zapata,\n41:7 Comment: or just as another attacking option, it would be sharper near the goal, honestly.\n41:13 Comment: For sure. But we see that the bench does not hiss upward.\n41:18 Comment: In principle, although more often it happened differently in the last season.\n41:23 Comment: There was a choice.\n41:24 Comment: Bruno Fernandes has left the team.\n41:27 Comment:  Very disappointing.\n41:29 Comment: He moved to Samdoria for nothing.\n41:31 Comment: Well, in that sense, I’m saying that in general, based on talent, based on my data.\n41:36 Comment: Bruno Fernandes could, of course, move to a very big team and shine there.\n41:43 Comment: But that’s the only way it turned out.\n41:48 Comment: Bruno left, Zelinsky left in Naples.\n41:53 Comment: But, really, for a lot of money.\n41:54 Comment: And here, probably, we again note the work on the transfer market.\n41:58 Comment: This familiar one, this Dineza.\n42:2 Comment: Well, probably, under the pressure of these Roman attacks, even the signal twitched,\n42:8 Comment: Not to mention Dinez's defense.\n42:11 Comment: Well, in principle, this picture can be used to characterize Dinez’s defensive play.\n42:19 Comment: Complete darkness.\n42:24 Comment: Slowly the signal is being restored.\n42:26 Comment: You yourself understand that these technical problems do not come from our country and not from Ostankino.\n42:36 Comment: It's something the Italians are doing.\n42:40 Comment: It’s great, by the way, that the opening match of the championship turned out to be productive.\n42:44 Comment: Although after the first half it didn’t seem like that would be the case.\n42:49 Comment: A productive match.\n42:50 Comment: Yes, the first goal was scored after a referee's error.\n42:55 Comment: Besides, the look there was off-site.\n42:58 Comment: Yes, the second goal was also a penalty.\n43:0 Comment: But, nevertheless, Roma absolutely deservedly puts pressure on the opponent.\n43:4 Comment: Probably another confirmation that the Italian Championship is no longer the same league where everyone puts most of their energy into defense.\n43:23 Comment: Well, Dinez, yes, there is Hall Fredson, there are other interesting performers.\n43:31 Comment: Fufana, who played most of the match today.\n43:37 Comment: But still, when you...\n43:46 Comment: When you are cut out of you by this legend.\n43:48 Comment: The legend itself is gone, but still.\n43:50 Comment: That's the story, these are the leaders in the locker room.\n43:54 Comment: That is, the entire team is somehow getting onto a new track.\n43:57 Comment: Moreover, Pascual is still gone, yes, that’s what I said.\n44:0 Comment: Damizi, these are all the leaders.\n44:3 Comment: These are leaders, maybe not always on the field, but always in the locker room.\n44:8 Comment: Very experienced football players.\n44:11 Comment: Well, instead of this Pinerand from Vocord, this one continues...\n44:21 Comment: A whirlwind of soccer players in this Potsu family.\n44:27 Comment: Cycle.\n44:28 Comment: Here you have Wadworth, and Granada, and Dineza.\n44:32 Comment: And the best, it feels like, the best will now speak for Wadworth.\n44:36 Comment: Who knows though.\n44:39 Comment: Depaul, Perritsa from Chelsea has arrived.\n44:42 Comment: Fufana from Manchester City.\n44:44 Comment: Evando, by the way, is for decent money, 2.5 million euros.\n44:48 Comment: This is also money for Italy.\n44:51 Comment: And somehow we have to put it all together.\n44:54 Comment: These are not the times of Francesco Guidolli, who has worked wonderfully with the young players here and in Chini.\n    \n\n    #######TASK \n    Provide a factually correct and detailed textual description of the game compiled from the information presented above from different sources, in more than 1000 words.\n            \"Cap:\": represents the captions published in the online portal usually within 30 seconds of the event.\n            \"E:\" represents events recorded exactly after the event happened.\n            \"Comment.\": represents the real-time noisy commentary from the commentator as the game progresses.\n    Don't mention sources of information like commentators or captions, write as if you saw them live.\n    \n    ",
    "summary": "AS Roma triumphed in a dominant 4-0 victory over Udinese at the Stadio Olimpico in what was a thrilling start to the Serie A season. This commanding performance established Roma as an offensive powerhouse right from the initial whistle, and despite the match's slow build-up, it was an emphatic demonstration of their capabilities.\n\nThe game began with an initial exploration of the team compositions. Roma, setting the tone early on, lined up magnificently at the military gates. The team's set-up boasted defensive solidity with Bruno Perez, Emerson, Kostas Manolas, and Thomas Vermaelen deputizing in defense. The midfield included the ever-dynamic Radja Nainggolan, Leandro Paredes, and Kevin Strootman, while the attacking trident saw Mohamed Salah, Stefan El Shaarawy, and Edin Dzeko leading the charge. The head coach, Luciano Spalletti, had decided on a tactical approach that promised ball control and attacking flair.\n\nIn the opening minutes of the first half, Roma's defense and midfield orchestrated themselves well, building attacks from the back with precision. Early on, their defensive and midfield prowess was clearly evidenced as they managed to stifle Udinese's counterattacks. They displayed not only defensive resilience but also sharpness in transitioning play from defense to attack.\n\nUdinese, on the other hand, under the guidance of head coach Giuseppe Iachini, presented a formidable lineup. Orestis Karnezis stood between the sticks, and the defensive setup included Sylvan Widmer, Ali Adnan, Samir, Danilo, and another member in the quintet. Their midfield was helmed by Emmanuel Agyemang Badu, Emil Hallfredsson, and others, with Duván Zapata leading their offensive efforts.\n\nAs the first half progressed, Roma started asserting themselves more, with neat passes and disciplined build-ups. Their high tempo became evident around the 9th minute when a near-chance was fabricated through Manolas’s long pass, which Dzeko attempted to flick toward the goal. However, contact wasn't ideal, and the execution went slightly awry.\n\nThe rest of the first half saw Roma maintain consistent pressure while Udinese attempted to capitalize on any counter-attacking opportunities. Mohamed Salah and Edin Dzeko were often at the heart of these attempts, showcasing fluid connection amongst themselves. Salah's runs down the right flank kept Udinese's defense on their toes, but didn’t initially yield tangible results.\n\nIn the 22nd minute, Roma launched another impressive attack. Emerson and El Shaarawy managed to synergize on occasions, moving the ball swiftly with composed passing in the midfield and attack zones. This eventually led to Kevin Strootman and company establishing possession in dangerous areas, but the Udinese rearguard was just about resilient enough to thwart these early attempts.\n\nUdinese’s offensive replies often transferred through Rodrigo De Paul and Duván Zapata. The latter, in particular, exhibited some powerful runs, but he found himself muscled out of opportunities by Roma’s imposing central defenders, Manolas and Vermaelen.\n\nAs the half drew to a close, the game maintained a tense equilibrium—Roma dominating in possession and showcasing several attacking forays, while Udinese defended stoutly, albeit without the quality needed in their final third to convert their counterattacks into scoring opportunities. Nonetheless, the breakthrough wasn’t achieved by either team as they headed into the break still deadlocked at 0-0.\n\nThe second half, however, was an entirely different narrative, dominated by Roma's relentless pursuit of goals. The tactical reshuffle saw Roma maintaining their attacking lineup and control. The breakthrough finally came through a penalty situation stemming from an infringement on Edin Dzeko. Dzeko, who was clearly offside before being fouled by Danilo, saw the resultant penalty succinctly converted by Diego Perotti in the 64th minute. Perotti, with a unique run-up, skillfully sent Karnezis the wrong way, slotting the ball calmly into the net.\n\nThe influence of Diego Perotti became increasingly pronounced as the game advanced. Within moments of the first penalty, Salah’s cross led to another penalty shout as he was bundled over, resulting in Perotti stepping up again in the 75th minute. Calm and composed, he once again deceived Karnezis to double Roma’s lead.\n\nAt 2-0, the floodgates opened. In the 82nd minute, Radja Nainggolan demonstrated his prowess by fighting robustly for the ball and threading a brilliant through pass to Dzeko, who made no mistake this time. Dzeko, who had faced immense criticism the previous season for his prolificacy issues, latched onto the perfectly weighted pass, and slotted it home beautifully to score Roma's third.\n\nUdinese’s defense crumbled under continuous Roma pressure, and within minutes, a disastrous moment for Udinese’s defense allowed Mohamed Salah to score the fourth goal. His initial shot was blocked, but Salah pounced on the rebound, firing into the roof of the net, solidifying an exceptionally dominant second half for Roma.\n\nUdinese’s response was tepid at best, as their initial semblances of tactical organization and defensive resoluteness dissolved rapidly in the face of Roma’s pressure. Despite a few attempts to create attacking opportunities—driven by Fofana and later substitutes like Lodi—Udinese struggled to establish any effective rhythm.\n\nRoma’s substitutions, including Joan Jesus and newcomer Federico Fazio, worked seamlessly within the dynamics of Spalletti’s system, indicating the depth and adaptability within their squad. Florenzi and other notable talents had to be content on the bench but will undoubtedly play vital roles through the season.\n\nThe atmosphere within the Stadio Olimpico was electric. Despite conflicts involving Roma’s fans and local authorities regarding fan stand setups and earlier tensions, an inspiringly vibrant ambiance prevailed as fans celebrated the comprehensive victory. The supporters' undying spirit undoubtedly bolstered the team’s performance throughout the second half. \n\nThis opening match showcased Roma’s attacking prowess and tactical intelligence, emphasizing their potential for the season ahead. The second half, brimming with clinical finishes and cohesive gameplay, contrasted sharply with a somewhat lackluster first half. Nonetheless, this 4-0 victory announced Roma's intentions to be serious contenders in Serie A, setting a high standard from the very beginning."
