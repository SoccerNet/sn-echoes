possession.\n6:26 Comment: Therefore a penalty.\n6:29 Comment: And now Dries Mertens has a great chance to score.\n6:39 Comment: Mertens doesn't score, doesn't score.\n6:42 Comment: The chance was great for Dries Mertens.\n6:45 Comment: The most obvious, a penalty kick, but the Belgian striker failed to convert it.\n6:53 Comment: Let's also look at why the penalty was awarded in this situation.\n6:57 Comment: And then the implementation itself.\n6:59 Comment: This blow, or rather, the moment was not realized.\n7:3 Comment: Mertens shot very poorly.\n7:6 Comment: He just wanted to roll the ball in the center, not too much, but it was a risk.\n7:10 Comment: You see, Skorubsky kicked the ball.\n7:12 Comment: And in the end it's still a 0-0 draw.\n7:16 Comment: By the way, an important point is that Mertens usually takes penalties quite confidently.\n7:21 Comment: But, nevertheless, this has not happened now.\n7:25 Comment: Mertens failed to score.\n7:26 Comment: Of

15, plays instead of Cosic.\n8:6 Comment: Well, according to the replacement position.\n8:8 Comment: Maybe Uros Cosic was injured.\n8:11 Comment: And that’s why Costa is playing today.\n8:13 Comment: And this is our serve from the left flank.\n8:20 Comment: Pascual.\n8:23 Comment: Executed.\n8:26 Comment: Had tried.\n8:27 Comment: Completed a cross or serve.\n8:29 Comment: But he made money

ball was thrown.\n9:9 Comment: And behind the side.\n9:10 Comment: And the ball was thrown incorrectly.\n9:15 Comment: Apparently, that's why it's Empoli now.\n9:18 Comment: And Lorini will do it.\n9:23 Comment: And this is Moriso Sarri.\n9:29 Comment: Another whistle from Damato.\n9:38 Comment: Referee for today's match.\n9:40 Comment: This is Cuciarelli.\n9:43 Comment: Played with his hand.\n9:44 Comment: Well, unintentionally.\n9:45 Comment: But, in any case, there was a hand.\n9:46 Comment: She influenced the episode.\n9:50 Comment: Empoli is trying to play hard.\n9:54 Comment:

accordingly...\n38:22 Comment: Already Lorenzo Insini's 12th goal.\n38:30 Comment: Therefore, he has very good statistics.\n38:33 Comment: It is clear that it will be difficult to catch up.\n38:37 Comment: But of course he can't.\n38:39 Comment: Better scorers.\n38:40 Comment: But if Incini continues to score like this, why not every match has two goals?\n38:44 Comment: then, of course, he will increase his number of goals.\n38:51 Comment: It is obvious.\n38:52 Comment: And your place in this table.\n38:54 Comment: Turning kick.\n38:55 Comment: So what's here?\n38:56 Comment: This is already

score?\n39:46 Comment: Here they are.\n39:46 Comment: Two pressing questions.\n39:48 Comment: But the first half gives a very eloquent assessment.\n39:56 Comment: What's happening.\n39:57 Comment: The score provides a telling assessment.\n39:58 Comment: What's happening.\n39:59 Comment: 3-0.\n40:0 Comment: Played for only 40 minutes.\n40:2 Comment: By the way, Napoli continues to be the best team

experienced player.\n42:7 Comment: Well, in general, there are options.\n42:10 Comment: But I can’t say that anyone can radically change Empoli’s game.\n42:13 Comment: It is unlikely.\n42:25 Comment:

    "summary": "Napoli emerged victorious in a thrilling encounter against Empoli, securing a 3-2 win that saw both teams demonstrate remarkable tenacity and skill throughout the 90 minutes. The clash took place at Empoli's home ground, where a lively crowd was treated to an action-packed match.\n\nFrom the opening whistle, Empoli displayed a strong intent to press Napoli high up the pitch, with Krunic and Thiam leading the charge. Early on, Empoli's high press paid off, leading to a few discomforting moments for Napoli's defense. Notably, Lorenzo Insigne and Dries Mertens faced intense pressure from the Empoli backline, with Fausi Ghulam struggling to find space to initiate attacks.\n\nIn the 6th minute, Empoli’s aggressive play almost paid dividends. Lorini, tasked with marking the right flank, managed to challenge Alan into making an error, leading to a promising situation. However, Napoli's defense quickly regrouped, nullifying the threat.\n\nBy the 10th minute, it was evident that Napoli's attack was starting to find its rhythm. A quick succession of passes between Insigne, Hamsik, and Alan culminated in Mertens earning a penalty after being brought down by Costa within the penalty area. Unfortunately for Napoli, Mertens' subsequent attempt from the spot was saved by Skorubsky, the Empoli goalkeeper, much to the disappointment of the Napoli fans in the stadium.\n\nNapoli’s perseverance soon paid off. In the 19th minute, Lorenzo Insigne opened the scoring. Following a smart pass from Insigne, facilitating a well-timed shot from the edge of the box, Insigne pounced on a loose ball after a defensive mishap by Costa, slotting it neatly past Skorubsky. The 1-0 lead energized Napoli, and the traveling fans erupted in celebration.\n\nNapoli continued to pile on the pressure, and just minutes later, a free-kick from Dries Mertens doubled their lead. In the 23rd minute, Mertens redeemed himself for his earlier penalty miss by curling the ball into the top corner, leaving Skorubsky rooted to the spot. The Belgian's expertly taken free-kick showcased his precision and calm under pressure.\n\nEmpoli struggled to regain composure, and Napoli further capitalized on this in the 38th minute by winning another penalty. This time, it was Lorenzo Insigne who stepped up confidently and converted the spot-kick, placing it beyond the reach of Skorubsky and making it 3-0 for Napoli. The match appeared to be slipping away from Empoli, who found themselves trailing by three goals before halftime.\n\nAs the second half commenced, Empoli showed resilience and an unyielding spirit. The introduction of Massimo Macarone added a veteran presence up front, potentially stabilizing their attack. Their efforts bore fruit when in the 70th minute, Omar El Kadoury, taking the free-kick he had earned, brilliantly executed a shot into the top corner of the net to bring the score to 3-1.\n\nEl Kadoury's goal injected new life into Empoli, who began to press more aggressively, sensing an opportunity to claw back into the game. Their persistence soon led to another breakthrough when Napoli's Ghoulam fouled Krunic inside the box, awarding Empoli their second penalty of the match. Massimo Macarone stepped forward to take this crucial penalty and calmly sent Reina the wrong way, closing the gap to 3-2 in the 83rd minute.\n\nEmpoli, buoyed by their comeback, pressed relentlessly for an equalizer, causing several nervous moments for Napoli's defense. Napoli, however, managed to hold firm despite the mounting pressure. The Neapolitan side had to contend with a series of free-kicks and corners as Empoli continued to attack until the final whistle.\n\nThe match ended with Empoli narrowly missing out on a draw, while Napoli breathed a sigh of relief, having held onto their slender lead. The final whistle signaled a hard-fought 3-2 victory for Napoli, who earned an important three points in their pursuit of Juventus and Roma at the top of Serie A. Both teams showed commendable spirit, with Napoli's clinical finishing in the first half proving decisive despite Empoli's spirited comeback in the second.\n\nOverall, it was a match filled with drama, skill, and resilience, epitomizing the excitement and unpredictability of football. The fans at Carlo Castellani Stadium were treated to a spectacle that will be remembered as one of the more thrilling encounters in Serie A this season."
