Comment: A blot was allowed.\n2:36 Comment: It was Parola who screwed it up.\n2:38 Comment: Mertens.\n2:39 Comment: Next is Alan.\n2:41 Comment: And Alan was quite successfully rendered soft.\n2:44 Comment: Long transfer in the direction of Ciro and Mobile.\n2:48 Comment: The attacker is mobile and will move along the entire front of the attack.\n2:51 Comment: And of course most of the programs are directed at him.\n2:55 Comment: Napoleon with the ball.\n2:56 Comment: Incini.\n2:57 Comment: On the left, Stritch offers himself.\n2:59 Comment: The ball also rolls towards him.\n3:1 Comment: Stritch.\n3:2 Comment: Already a confrontation with another Balkan Basta.\n3:7 Comment: An elegant combination.\n3:10 Comment: There was also a heel pass.\n3:12 Comment: And in general this is a combination.\n3:14 Comment: Direction.\n3:18 Comment: Albiol.\n3:19 Comment: Not the most convenient pass.\n3:21 Comment: Therefore, Alan returned the ball to him.\n3:23 Comment: Continue on to Gamshik.\n3:25 Comment: Mara Hamshik.\n3:26 Comment: It starts attacking from the depths.\n3:28 Comment: Again here is the Bronunian movement.\n3:30 Comment: Football players in Naples.\n3:32 Comment: The main thing is that the ball moves.\n3:34 Comment: And it’s not so important who will be glued to what position.\n3:37 Comment: Well, here's left back Stritch.\n3:39 Comment: Often works with the ball.\n3:41 Comment: So far, this ball has not reached Esid Hysaj.\n3:43 Comment: In theory, Kulebali could now be transferred there to the free zone.\n3:47 Comment: But it hasn't come to that yet.\n3:49 Comment: Kulebali.\n3:50 Comment: In the middle of the field to Alan.\n3:52 Comment: The defensive midfielder passes to Hamsik.\n3:54 Comment: But.\n3:55 Comment: This ball is intercepted by his partner Insigne.\n3:58 Comment: Alan.\n3:59 Comment: And I made the selection.\n4:1 Comment: And the capital passage is trying to organize.\n4:3 Comment: But here he came across Bashtoush.\n4:9 Comment: Basta.\n4:10 Comment: In the most difficult situation, he keeps the ball.\n4:13 Comment: Bastos.\n4:14 Comment: Basta.\n4:20 Comment: And under the cut is Stritch.\n4:22 Comment: Interrupts Lazio's attempt to select.\n4:24 Comment: Although here is the actual penalty kick.\n4:26 Comment: Well, in fact, we see that now the number is positional.\n4:29 Comment: Lazioli are defending.\n4:31 Comment: Almost how much.\n4:33 Comment: 8 field players are always behind the ball line.\n4:35 Comment: This is understandable.\n4:37 Comment: Napoleon is in possession of a fake ball.\n4:39 Comment: Most in Serie A.\n4:41 Comment: And pass the ball.\n4:43 Comment: Try to catch your opponent on the counter play.\n4:46 Comment: This is probably a completely understandable plan.\n4:49 Comment: For Simon Inzaki's team.\n4:51 Comment: Nothing unusual here.\n4:53 Comment: Bastos.\n4:56 Comment: Moving forward.\n4:57 Comment: And he pierced the ball quite far from himself.\n5:2 Comment: I had to make a pass already in the fall.\n5:4 Comment: Casting on Imobili.\n5:5 Comment: Immobiles.\n5:7 Comment: Turning in time, he even managed to throw the ball between Raul Albioli’s legs.\n5:11 Comment: But there were three defenders on the field at once.\n5:13 Comment: Attention.\n5:14 Comment: Philippe Anderson delivers a cross to the far post.\n5:17 Comment: Hit.\n5:18 Comment: And the first match is a corner match.\n5:20 Comment: It seemed that Pepe Reina was already in a dead zone.\n5:22 Comment: Punched.\n5:24 Comment: I think Murzha.\n5:26 Comment: 20 year old midfielder.\n5:28 Comment: Well chosen position.\n5:29 Comment: Hit to touch.\n5:30 Comment: The ball went wide.\n5:32 Comment: On his way to Gulebala.\n5:34 Comment: Remained.\n5:36 Comment: Well, the main thing is that he didn’t send the ball into his own goal.\n5:41 Comment: Of course there would be a courier.\n5:43 Comment: Murzha performs.\n5:45 Comment: No. The blow was struck by Milinkovic Savic.\n5:48 Comment: And Murzha is now performing the standard.\n5:50 Comment: Semenin.\n5:52 Comment: Before serving.\n5:53 Comment: Pass to the near post.\n5:55 Comment: The ball did not go through this palisade of legs.\n5:59 Comment: Incine.\n6:1 Comment: His usual Finn.\n6:3 Comment: A familiar maneuver.\n6:4 Comment: When it suddenly shifts to the center.\n6:6 Comment: Everybody knows.\n6:7 Comment: But it's so hard to resist.\n6:9 Comment: Because Lorenzo Insine has very fast feet.\n6:11 Comment: Ganshik.\n6:13 Comment: Returns to Insigne.\n6:14 Comment: Iman Strinic offers himself again on the left side.\n6:18 Comment: Lately Strinich.\n6:20 Comment: This is the feeling.\n6:21 Comment: He did not forget his position in the starting lineup.\n6:23 Comment: Ub.\n6:25 Comment: Fauzigulya.\n6:30 Comment: Interception from Lazio.\n6:31 Comment: Filippo Anderson can beat more than one with speed.\n6:34 Comment: But he runs into the unyielding Marquez Alla.\n6:40 Comment: A real fighter.\n6:42 Comment: Feels a little good in martial arts.\n6:46 Comment: Well, if he plays from the first to the last minute.\n6:49 Comment: He is often among the leaders at the end of the tour.\n6:52 Comment: In terms of interceptions.\n6:54 Comment: Martial arts won.\n6:56 Comment: True, he shone with these statistics more often when he played for Udineso.\n7:0 Comment: Still, this is a more defensive team compared to Napoleon.\n7:3 Comment: Strinich.\n7:4 Comment: Runs into Anderson.\n7:6 Comment: Very tight in the middle of the field.\n7:7 Comment: And indeed in Lazio’s half of the field.\n7:11 Comment: Very little space.\n7:12 Comment: Mertens.\n7:13 Comment: Takes over the game.\n7:15 Comment: Three rivals hung on it.\n7:17 Comment: There's no getting around here.\n7:19 Comment: Lazio plays defensively in the first minutes.\n7:24 Comment: Very disciplined.\n7:27 Comment: Very clear.\n7:29 Comment: And practically without errors.\n7:33 Comment: Strokosha.\n7:36 Comment: Oh, how he endures it.\n7:38 Comment: Good for Savich.\n7:39 Comment: Savich wins the fight.\n7:40 Comment: And he picks up the ball himself.\n7:42 Comment: Savic with the ball.\n7:44 Comment: The feint has passed.\n7:45 Comment: And they hit him.\n7:46 Comment: There is a feeling that the hall was there after all.\n7:49 Comment: But he doesn't react to this episode.\n7:52 Comment: Whistle.\n7:53 Comment: At least to Massimiliano Irati.\n7:56 Comment: We have no reason not to trust him.\n7:58 Comment: The referee is experienced.\n7:59 Comment: This is a status match.\n8:3 Comment: We could not see a young referee who had not been tested by difficult confrontations.\n8:12 Comment: Marek Hansik turns the ball around.\n8:15 Comment: Trinich.\n8:16 Comment: And if you break through.\n8:18 Comment: He ends up making an inaccurate pass to Mertens.\n8:23 Comment: And he immediately ran to open it.\n8:25 Comment: I was probably counting on a wall game with Drisser.\n8:29 Comment: Pepe Reina is guarding here not even the most convenient pass.\n8:34 Comment: Awww.\n8:35 Comment: Strinnich.\n8:36 Comment: It was played effectively.\n8:37 Comment: And then the transfer is not accurate.\n8:39 Comment: Like this.\n8:40 Comment: From prince to rags.\n8:42 Comment: Manages to transfer the Password.\n8:44 Comment: But here all the defenders are on alert.\n8:48 Comment: And the Hovbecks.\n8:49 Comment: Napoleo.\n8:50 Comment: The interception was carried out by Jorginio.\n8:51 Comment: He is now launching an attack.\n8:53 Comment: Now it happens that Jorginio is not in the spotlight.\n8:59 Comment: In principle, he does not often threaten the opponent’s goal.\n9:2 Comment: And it seems that he is not always the first during selection.\n9:6 Comment: But he has the most important role in the development of attacks.\n9:9 Comment: The gears are in perfect order.\n9:10 Comment: Here is one of them.\n9:11 Comment: Well, here's a short pass.\n9:13 Comment: He is such an important in-between.\n9:16 Comment: In.\n9:17 Comment: Napoleo's positional attacks.\n9:22 Comment: A short stop.\n9:23 Comment: Savich has health problems.\n9:27 Comment: Well, you're probably used to it too.\n9:29 Comment: The double surname is so long that it’s easier to write Sergei on a T-shirt.\n9:36 Comment: Well, I actually thought that after all...\n9:39 Comment: Oh, that's it.\n9:40 Comment: What does Seryozha smell like?\n9:44 Comment: Well, it wasn't very rough there.\n9:46 Comment: It is clear that it is a game moment.\n9:47 Comment: In no case did anyone try to touch up the nose of the Balkan football player.\n9:55 Comment: Interesting repetition.\n10:2 Comment: Well, Napoleo with the ball.\n10:3 Comment: Let's move on.\n10:4 Comment: The game develops at a clear pace, in a clear pattern.\n10:9 Comment: The Neapolitans are shaking the ball.\n10:11 Comment: Although we see that Mertens decided to take a long-range shot here.\n10:14 Comment: But, in the end, it was necessary to check already.\n10:15 Comment: Rival.\n10:16 Comment: Check how Strokosha is doing.\n10:18 Comment: Which is showing amazing statistics this season.\n10:24 Comment: One of the most impenetrable goalkeepers in the championship.\n10:27 Comment: This is already the 15th game for Thomas Strokoshi.\n10:30 Comment: Albanian goalkeeper, quite young, 22 years old.\n10:33 Comment: And he is currently conceding an average of about half a goal per game.\n10:40 Comment: Or one goal in two matches.\n10:42 Comment: That is, the coefficient is impenetrable.\n10:45 Comment: The game resulted in 0-57.\n10:47 Comment: Overall, great numbers.\n10:49 Comment: Of his 14 previous matches, 6 of them ended in blowouts.\n10:54 Comment: Didn't miss it.\n10:55 Comment: Allan picks up the ball.\n10:58 Comment: On selection.\n11:3 Comment: Lots of moving, changing positions.\n11:5 Comment: A lot of wall play, short passing.\n11:10 Comment: Again, taking into account the fact that there is no tall, powerful football player in attack.\n11:14 Comment: In Naples, both in the middle and from the middle, in principle, there is no one to connect to.\n11:18 Comment: Although Hamshik can head the ball.\n11:20 Comment: In general, it makes no sense to give a penalty kick, perform crosses,\n11:25 Comment: when you have a forward who is less than 170 centimeters tall.\n11:30 Comment: I am, of course, Risi Merkels.\n11:38 Comment: Let this phrase perhaps smack of some kind of stereotype.\n11:43 Comment: And moss.\n11:44 Comment: But for now this is such a classic Italian match, where no one makes mistakes.\n11:49 Comment: This means that the coach has nothing to worry about.\n11:53 Comment: Shot from Savic.\n11:55 Comment: So far this is the main striking force of Glocial in this match.\n11:58 Comment: He takes on the game well.\n12:0 Comment: We remember his solo passage.\n12:2 Comment: Here it is.\n12:3 Comment: In general, it is, of course, a very rare quality for such a tall, powerful midfield player to have dribbling ability.\n12:9 Comment: Now before the impact.\n12:10 Comment: And that's not true.\n12:11 Comment: This is wrong.\n12:12 Comment: But before the strike he managed to spin one of his opponents.\n12:15 Comment: Well, for comparison, who else can you remember?\n12:18 Comment: Well, probably Josip Ilyichic, right?\n12:21 Comment: For example, from Ferentina.\n12:23 Comment: There is also quite a bit for him, up to 190 centimeters is not enough.\n12:28 Comment: A tall guy, but at the same time very fit, he performs all these feints on himself.\n12:33 Comment: And in general he knows how to handle the ball.\n12:37 Comment: Strokoshin.\n12:38 Comment: 13 minutes of the 31st round of the Italian championship.\n12:43 Comment: The game that closes this round.\n12:46 Comment: Well, now an interception from the Neapolitans.\n12:49 Comment: Allah!\n12:50 Comment: Pushed on Mertens.\n12:52 Comment: But he couldn’t get past one of the defenders with this pass.\n12:56 Comment: Mertens, of course, had the best position.\n12:59 Comment: He handled the ball there.\n13:0 Comment: All.\n13:1 Comment: It would be a one-on-one situation.\n13:2 Comment: How will Mertens take his chances this season?\n13:5 Comment: This is simply fantastic.\n13:6 Comment: Immobiles.\n13:8 Comment: Mobile immobil.\n13:9 Comment: Despite his last name.\n13:11 Comment: Savich to the left edge.\n13:13 Comment: This is Lukako.\n13:14 Comment: Lukako is a fan of attacking.\n13:16 Comment: Well, with such and such a name.\n13:18 Comment: Dan Lukako moves to the center.\n13:21 Comment: Of course, not very effective.\n13:23 Comment: And in general this season he made only one assist.\n13:25 Comment: But he reaches someone else's fines.\n13:30 Comment: Well, we don’t forget that Lazio operates according to a formation with three central defenders.\n13:35 Comment: And Lukako.\n13:38 Comment: A position that involves joining the attack.\n13:41 Comment: Yes, indeed, Jordan was offside.\n13:46 Comment: Belgian defender.\n13:48 Comment: Who is also called up to the national team.\n13:52 Comment: Pel.\n13:57 Comment: Someone stellar, I must say.\n13:59 Comment: Strimich.\n14:1 Comment: It's funny.\n14:2 Comment: A mixture of laughter and the roar of dissatisfaction was now in the stands.\n14:8 Comment: But the most important thing is that Strimich still ran around Iratti’s assistant.\n14:15 Comment: I understand it was Filippo Melli.\n14:18 Comment: There is no violation of the rules.\n14:21 Comment: Another meeting between Basta and Strimich.\n14:25 Comment: Ivan Strimic, Croatian defender, defensive end player.\n14:31 Comment: Well, Tushin Basta, who has been playing for Lazio for the third season.\n14:34 Comment: It was here that Lazio finally reformatted into a defender.\n14:38 Comment: It is curious that Basta has already played more than 80 matches in these three seasons with Lazio.\n14:45 Comment: And so far he has scored only one goal.\n14:47 Comment: Just one.\n14:49 Comment: And even then against a little-known team in the Italian Cup.\n14:54 Comment: After all, he once scored for Pudineso and often did it beautifully.\n15:1 Comment: Mertens on Kalifona.\n15:4 Comment: Kalifon performs an amazing program.\n15:7 Comment: Diagonal to the full-back across half the field.\n15:11 Comment: Back to your gate.\n15:13 Comment: And this happens in cooliball.\n15:15 Comment: Coolibole danced around the ball here.\n15:19 Comment: It took me a long time to make a decision.\n15:21 Comment: And finally, Suite Hu Sai.\n15:23 Comment: Finally we have a ball.\n15:25 Comment: In my opinion, he is the only one who plays in thermal underwear today.\n15:29 Comment: Well, in my opinion, it’s not that cold in Rome.\n15:34 Comment: Anyway.\n15:35 Comment: Strinnich.\n15:36 Comment: Basta immediately meets him.\n15:38 Comment: But Strinnich still came up with a pass to Mertens.\n15:41 Comment: Mertens!\n15:42 Comment: Throws the ball.\n15:43 Comment: But Bastos is there.\n15:45 Comment: Places the body well.\n15:46 Comment: The same Angolins Bastos.\n15:50 Comment: You haven't forgotten him, have you?\n15:52 Comment: The same guy to whom Rostov owes its amazing success.\n15:57 Comment: One of those who forged victories.\n16:0 Comment: Including, by the way, some of the Eurocups.\n16:3 Comment: Still, Bashtush managed to play in the Champions League for Rostov at the beginning of the season.\n16:8 Comment: Well, Vladson moved over.\n16:13 Comment: True, he doesn’t always play in the base.\n16:15 Comment: And Mobiles.\n16:18 Comment: It went to Philip Anderson.\n16:21 Comment: I, you know, always when I look at football, I think that this is not true.\n16:25 Comment: You know, I have always been interested in this question.\n16:30 Comment: What was going through the mind of Claudio Lotito, president of Lazio, when he rejected Manchester's application?\n16:39 Comment: In my opinion, this is almost official information.\n16:41 Comment: Everyone knows that...\n16:42 Comment: Here he is, by the way, right?\n16:43 Comment: Thank you very much to the Italian director.\n16:45 Comment: I’m not sure, of course, that he hears my report, to put it mildly.\n16:50 Comment: But, nevertheless, it turned out, as they say, at the box office.\n16:52 Comment: And then there is Aurelio Delaraitis.\n16:54 Comment: This is the head of Naples.\n16:55 Comment: So, Manchester United, after Anderson’s outstanding season before last, claimed big money for this player.\n17:3 Comment: He allegedly offered 40 or 50 million euros.\n17:6 Comment: Anderson was not sold.\n17:7 Comment: Here he is.\n17:8 Comment: And as a result, last season turned out to be lackluster.\n17:12 Comment: Yes, and I can’t say what’s brilliant about this.\n17:14 Comment: Just like it was in those very games, when he was outwitting his opponents, he scored a lot and gave away a lot.\n17:22 Comment: That's interesting.\n17:23 Comment: I wonder if Latita regrets it or not.\n17:25 Comment: In any case, he decided to keep the Brazilian attacking midfielder in the team.\n17:29 Comment: In order, probably, to build a team of such a different class, which is capable of more in the Italian Championship.\n17:36 Comment: Maybe even for the championship fight.\n17:39 Comment: The Neapolitans suffered many losses.\n17:41 Comment: But Matton Switchiama gives in on Ensign.\n17:43 Comment: Insigne already has a free kick.\n17:45 Comment: Bastoush!\n17:47 Comment: Selects.\n17:48 Comment: I hope, with knees, nothing else.\n17:50 Comment: It turned out to be a goal.\n17:51 Comment: He found himself on his knees in front of Mertens.\n17:54 Comment: But he did not beg for forgiveness, did not ask for mercy.\n18:0 Comment: He took the ball away like that.\n18:4 Comment: Several unusual episodes in these 18 minutes of play.\n18:7 Comment: Another thing is that there are not enough episodes of scoring chances.\n18:10 Comment: Incine.\n18:11 Comment: Incine throws it onto Mertens.\n18:14 Comment: He turns around.\n18:15 Comment: And he runs into Lowes.\n18:18 Comment: Hamshek inside the penalty area.\n18:20 Comment: Murgia neutralized him.\n18:24 Comment: And a feed to Kaliphon.\n18:27 Comment: He handles the ball with difficulty.\n18:29 Comment: Napoli's protracted positional attack.\n18:33 Comment: It will never come to a blow.\n18:34 Comment: Alan. Translation is not precise.\n18:40 Comment: Well, so far the Luciales are coping.\n18:44 Comment: There was no offside here.\n18:46 Comment: But Kalifon handled it well.\n18:49 Comment: It is actually very difficult to handle balls.\n18:52 Comment: When the ball flies out from behind your back or over your shoulder.\n18:56 Comment: Still on the move.\n18:59 Comment: Beautiful.\n19:1 Comment: But the technical guys are gathered in Napoli.\n19:3 Comment: We know this very well.\n19:4 Comment: Alan.\n19:6 Comment: Look. Also the first yellow card in this match.\n19:10 Comment: By the way, Bastos receives it.\n19:15 Comment: Was it worth it to be so strict with him?\n19:21 Comment: Well, let's see.\n19:22 Comment: Alan forwards.\n19:23 Comment: And Bastos.\n19:24 Comment: Well, yes. Apparently just from a different position.\n19:26 Comment: And Rati watched this episode.\n19:28 Comment: And Bastush probably put his hand out deliberately.\n19:30 Comment: That is, he deliberately thwarted this attack.\n19:33 Comment: The opponent was picking up speed.\n19:36 Comment: So yes.\n19:37 Comment: The attack had prospects.\n19:38 Comment: It's torn down.\n19:39 Comment: This is a yellow card.\n19:40 Comment: Oh oh oh.\n19:42 Comment: Balidukhu li Bali.\n19:43 Comment: I acted very rudely here.\n19:44 Comment: And Mobile doesn't play dirty against him.\n19:47 Comment: Kuli Bali kicked.\n19:48 Comment: Kicked an opponent.\n19:49 Comment: Who knows, maybe this episode will be dissected later.\n19:54 Comment: With the help of repetitions.\n19:57 Comment: Maybe even some kind of punishment will be imposed.\n20:0 Comment: Although, in theory, it’s a trifle.\n20:2 Comment: So, the first corner is near the gate of the OSHM lines.\n20:12 Comment: One proud one has already shot him.\n20:13 Comment: Latso already has one proud one.\n20:16 Comment: We finally got to this point.\n20:19 Comment: Califon.\n20:20 Comment: Center of the penalty area.\n20:21 Comment: And the tall OShM jumped with his palm, as if the ball had brushed away a fly.\n20:30 Comment: The selection is up to the Neapolitans.\n20:34 Comment: From here, from the depths.\n20:35 Comment: Here again Insini found himself.\n20:37 Comment: But this is a situational story.\n20:39 Comment: On set pieces, players like Incini are short.\n20:43 Comment: The safety nets are usually located closer to the central circle.\n20:46 Comment: Hamshik to the right edge.\n20:48 Comment: This is Alan.\n20:49 Comment: Napoleon slowed down a little at the pace of this combinatorics.\n20:55 Comment: Can't quickly pass the ball to each other.\n20:59 Comment: And this allows the Latso defender to orient himself.\n21:3 Comment: Just like Rado. It was a close-up.\n21:5 Comment: Alan won the ball again.\n21:8 Comment: The same tenacious football player.\n21:9 Comment: Innings.\n21:10 Comment: But here there is no chance.\n21:12 Comment: Bashtozh is not made of poly.\n21:14 Comment: But he has a wonderful, excellent jump.\n21:16 Comment: So whoever you take, any Latso player is higher than his opponent from Naples.\n21:22 Comment: Well, unless, of course, you take Naples' central defenders.\n21:27 Comment: Coulibaly and Raoul Alberly.\n21:29 Comment: Kaliho.\n21:34 Comment: Lost the ball.\n21:39 Comment: It works.\n21:42 Comment: The Romans cut, cut off this space for the combination.\n21:50 Comment: Reduce time for making decisions.\n21:53 Comment: Hence the number of losses and unforced mistakes.\n21:57 Comment: And forced, including from rivals.\n22:0 Comment: Koulibaly hits a through ball. This is also a loss.\n22:3 Comment: Well, of course, it was very dense, very narrow.\n22:6 Comment: Where would such a simple transfer go?\n22:12 Comment: It would seem that's why...\n22:24 Comment: Crap.\n22:25 Comment: Well, now banana.\n22:26 Comment: Which APPLAUSE?\n22:27 Comment: Of course it's juegos de kische that Cali.\n22:29 Comment: entonces\n22:31 Comment: Well, weDon't be strong.\n22:33 Comment: I say let's go here Proteu.\n22:37 Comment: What is the intellectual weight under more to Aí\n22:39 Comment: AND\n22:40 Comment: subtitles avoir.\n22:41 Comment: People of leadership, police and so on.\n22:45 Comment: In general, you know this story because my colleagues and I have repeatedly talked about it on air.\n22:51 Comment: About the fact that fences were installed in the fan sections.\n22:57 Comment: And both Roma fans and Latso fans opposed this.\n23:1 Comment: They boycotted some games.\n23:3 Comment: Weak attendance was also observed at the derby.\n23:5 Comment: But they were finally removed.\n23:8 Comment: You see, this is the real power of the fan.\n23:11 Comment: They proved their right not to be in an enclosure at football.\n23:17 Comment: Like in a zoo.\n23:19 Comment: They can be understood.\n23:21 Comment: Although, of course, these guys are hot.\n23:24 Comment: They can afford a lot in the stands.\n23:29 Comment: Standard position.\n23:30 Comment: Serve to the center of the penalty area.\n23:32 Comment: And a violation in the attack.\n23:35 Comment: By the way, you can also get a yellow card for this.\n23:38 Comment: After the whistle.\n23:40 Comment: Besides, there...\n23:41 Comment: Now Kulibari is probably punching for two seconds.\n23:44 Comment: Yes, Kalifon was pushing his opponent.\n23:46 Comment: This is clearly visible on the replay.\n23:48 Comment: 24th minute.\n23:50 Comment: Latso on the field.\n23:51 Comment: Once again I will briefly talk about disposition.\n23:54 Comment: For those who didn't catch the very beginning of the report.\n23:57 Comment: In third position on the field there are now 64 points.\n24:2 Comment: 7 points behind Roma, which is in second place.\n24:6 Comment: Well, let me remind you that the difference is significant.\n24:10 Comment: Become second or third.\n24:11 Comment: In Italy.\n24:11 Comment: Because the first two teams from the slot go to the group stage of the Champions League.\n24:15 Comment: The third will participate in the qualifying round.\n24:19 Comment: And we remember that Roma failed to qualify for the Champions League this season.\n24:24 Comment: She lost to Porto in the group.\n24:27 Comment: Well, we can say that later Juventus took revenge.\n24:31 Comment: Because it was Juve who interrupted Porto’s path in the Champions League.\n24:38 Comment: Well, Latso is in fourth position.\n24:40 Comment: 4 points behind Naples.\n24:43 Comment: And again, this is a Champions League game.\n24:46 Comment: Essentially, if Latso wins, she reduces the gap to Napoles to a minimum.\n24:50 Comment: And here it is, a fight for a lot of money, by the way.\n24:53 Comment: Mertens. Mertens lands a sword on Shikago's legs.\n25:4 Comment: Great combination.\n25:6 Comment: They use compasses, pencils and other instruments.\n25:9 Comment: They painted their next attack on this canvas.\n25:14 Comment: Signature attack.\n25:16 Comment: Where there is a low pass, where there is a pass that is somewhat unexpected.\n25:23 Comment: There is no offside.\n25:24 Comment: But how did Hamshik spot Jose Calijon on the far corner?\n25:29 Comment: Through the entire line of defense.\n25:30 Comment: There were three football players there.\n25:31 Comment: See, one, two.\n25:32 Comment: Well, two.\n25:34 Comment: But he still saw his boyfriend in black.\n25:37 Comment: He passed the ball perfectly.\n25:39 Comment: And here he is.\n25:40 Comment: No, I'm not inclined to call this...\n25:43 Comment: Look, it's not Ederley who is rooting for Naples.\n25:46 Comment: Not a forward for the Italian national team.\n25:48 Comment: Is very similar.\n25:50 Comment: Okay, that's not what we're talking about.\n25:53 Comment: Actually, the mastermind of this attack was Mertens.\n25:55 Comment: He struggled and grabbed the ball.\n25:57 Comment: He made a very convenient pass for Hamsik.\n26:0 Comment: Gamshik has already driven towards Kalihon.\n26:2 Comment: Here's a three.\n26:4 Comment: Simple, confidently executed.\n26:7 Comment: 1-0. Naples is ahead.\n26:9 Comment: Class.\n26:10 Comment: Well, what a cool attack it was.\n26:12 Comment: How many of these goals have Napoli already scored?\n26:15 Comment: Including, by the way, in the previous round.\n26:18 Comment: Yes, I remind you that Naples has a corner week.\n26:21 Comment: They are playing their third match in the last 7 days.\n26:24 Comment: And all three matches are with big Italian teams.\n26:28 Comment: Two games.\n26:29 Comment: You see how it was.\n26:30 Comment: Mertens lost the ball.\n26:31 Comment: But thanks to this agility of his, the nimble player,\n26:35 Comment: he immediately knocked him down.\n26:36 Comment: Here it is.\n26:39 Comment: He takes on Gamshik.\n26:40 Comment: Gamshik on Kalikhona.\n26:41 Comment: All.\n26:42 Comment: That's all the vaunted wandering.\n26:44 Comment: This is, of course, Radu's mistake.\n26:46 Comment: Of course, Radu's mistake.\n26:48 Comment: He didn't reach it.\n26:49 Comment: He did not control the movement of Calihon.\n26:53 Comment: Kose Kalihon.\n26:55 Comment: Another of his goals this season.\n26:57 Comment: Quite a productive player.\n26:58 Comment: In general, I must say, this is not the first time it has been noticed,\n27:3 Comment: for all these Italian seasons of his,\n27:5 Comment: that he is very effective in the first round.\n27:9 Comment: In the first matches.\n27:10 Comment: In the first third, I would even say, season.\n27:12 Comment: So it was in the current season.\n27:14 Comment: By the fourth round he had already scored five goals.\n27:18 Comment: I designed two takes.\n27:19 Comment: I shipped two goals to Milan, two goals to Palermo and so on.\n27:23 Comment: Well, but then everything was somehow dry.\n27:27 Comment: And I must say that Calijon is in the Italian Championship\n27:30 Comment: scored for the first time in ten rounds.\n27:37 Comment: For nine.\n27:38 Comment: I'm sorry.\n27:39 Comment: Last time Jose Calijon scored naked\n27:42 Comment: in the match against Milan away on the twenty-first Ashtur.\n27:46 Comment: And now the thirty-first is on.\n27:49 Comment: Then he opened the account.\n27:55 Comment: Well, you know, in a Naples like this, it seems to me that even the dead will start scoring.\n28:0 Comment: Well, or Cripple.\n28:2 Comment: Well, or a person who, in principle, is weak at football.\n28:7 Comment: This attack is so life-giving.\n28:10 Comment: Mertens. What a heavy ball he caught.\n28:14 Comment: This fantastic Mertens, who is prolific, of course, in both goals and assists.\n28:21 Comment: And on pre-goal goals, too, as we see.\n28:23 Comment: Let me remind you once again that it was he who inspired the team to score, so to speak.\n28:30 Comment: Mertens. This is Insignan.\n28:36 Comment: Well, that's who can often be confused.\n28:38 Comment: Yes, Insignan and Mertens. One has number 14, the other has number 24. Both are short.\n28:43 Comment: And feints are sometimes similar in some ways.\n28:47 Comment: Gamshik. Casting is not the most convenient.\n28:50 Comment: Lukaku interrupted the pass.\n28:52 Comment: And he himself accelerates the attack. Long pass.\n28:56 Comment: Due to the merits of Napoli, in addition to the fact that the team scored a goal in the first half, this, of course, is that the immobile is completely turned off from the game.\n29:6 Comment: Not a single blow yet.\n29:8 Comment: Not once, in my opinion, did he even receive the ball inside the penalty area.\n29:12 Comment: Did he actually touch him inside the penalty area? Well...\n29:19 Comment: This, for a second, is the author of 18 goals this season.\n29:23 Comment: Well, for now he has room to strive. His personal record in the Italian Championship.\n29:28 Comment: But that’s not about that now. Anderson takes the striking position. Hit!\n29:33 Comment: Well, here on finishing right away...\n29:36 Comment: On the rebound, or rather, there are two defenders at once.\n29:39 Comment: That’s why, probably, it was pointless for Anderson to run to finish.\n29:43 Comment: Such a powerful attempt. This is a scoring chance, in my opinion.\n29:48 Comment: Anderson could have shot even more dangerously. The situation was convenient.\n29:52 Comment: Page Not a bad answer from Lazio.\n29:56 Comment: Again, even after conceding, Lazio does not abandon the counter-attacking model.\n30:2 Comment: This is Lazio.\n30:4 Comment: This is probably the most correct way to get to the gates of Naples.\n30:10 Comment: I'm just not sure Lazio is ready now. This is the Lazio squad.\n30:16 Comment: In general, the team’s style is not such as to impose its attacking football,\n30:23 Comment: impose a positional attack on an opponent of Naples' caliber.\n30:27 Comment: Long kick forward. Kulebali.\n30:30 Comment: Well, here somehow Parola, in my opinion, is not very good.\n30:33 Comment: Parola, in my opinion, acted softly.\n30:39 Comment: Or Anderson. It didn't matter. The main thing is that Kulebali got the ball very, very easily.\n30:47 Comment: Mertens loses his balance, but does not beg, does not beg the referee for a free kick or anything like that.\n30:54 Comment: Mertens puts pressure on Bastusan.\n30:59 Comment: Murgia. Good pass to Milinkovic Savic.\n31:3 Comment: Cutting 30 meters of Lukaku space at once.\n31:8 Comment: What a great run.\n31:11 Comment: Sprint mode turned on. Lukaku almost got to the ball first.\n31:16 Comment: But Pepe Reina jumped out ahead.\n31:21 Comment: Pepe Reina was unable to help his team in the previous round match against Juventus.\n31:27 Comment: Let me remind you that Napoleon played 1-1 with Juventus, conceding in the first minutes.\n31:31 Comment: There were certain complaints about Napoleon's reserve goalkeeper Rafael Cabral.\n31:37 Comment: He missed the ball under him after Khidira's shot.\n31:41 Comment: But again, I said in that report that it’s probably difficult to demand ideal gaming tone\n31:47 Comment: and numerous saves from the goalkeeper, who played in the Italian Championship for the first time this season.\n31:52 Comment: I'm with Rafael Cabrale. But we see that Pepe is back and he has already helped his team a couple of times. Really.\n31:59 Comment: Wall game, touch game. Great, beautiful. Hurry up Gamshik.\n32:4 Comment: Gamshik. There is Sik Chusai free on the right sideline. Rarely do his partners involve him.\n32:10 Comment: Chusai. Innings! And the restless Dries Mertens jumped out from behind Bastos.\n32:18 Comment: At the moment, the Belgian attacking midfielder, who, as you know, retrained as a forward this season, has scored 20 goals.\n32:29 Comment: For 27 games. Plus 5 more assists. So we get 25 points according to the goalkeeper system. An excellent indicator.\n32:43 Comment: Mertens also made his name in poker this season. Moreover, he scored two tricks in a row.\n32:51 Comment: It's been a while since a series like this has happened, if I'm not mistaken. Since the time of Shevchenko.\n32:58 Comment: In any case, such a rate of fire only happened when Shevchenko scored for Milan.\n33:4 Comment: He scored 3 goals against Caleri and 4 goals against Torino in the next round.\n33:9 Comment: And then he polished this story further in the match with Ferentin. In general, he scored 8 goals in 3 matches.\n33:17 Comment: Even for the current Italian championship, which is not famous for the quality of defensive players, there are many young players, and this is what I attribute to such performance.\n33:28 Comment: Even for such a championship this is, of course, a lot.\n33:31 Comment: Mertens continues to fight with Bastos. Well, we still remember this from the Russian Championship matches.\n33:38 Comment: Bastos is very good in one-on-one play. He may lose his position. He may, again, mess up somewhere during the transfer.\n33:47 Comment: But when it comes to fighting one on one, eye to eye, then he is exceptional.\n33:54 Comment: Here is Bastos with the ball. Mongolian in Serbo Bastum.\n33:58 Comment: Bastos, Basta. Here's a link.\n34:3 Comment: Buzbush. Bazbash, to be more precise. It looks like the name of some Tatar dish.\n34:10 Comment: But I must say that this is rather Latso’s problem. I mean the defensive line. It is still not very stable and reliable.\n34:21 Comment: Although Simon Inzaghi, we haven’t talked about him yet during the first half.\n34:26 Comment: It seems to me that more often he manages to find a balance between defense and attack.\n34:36 Comment: Well, in principle, this season, if, again, this match is not taken into account, Latso conceded 31 goals in 30 matches.\n34:43 Comment: Not the worst indicator, let's say, in terms of this indicator Latso. Well, exactly in fourth position, where the overall standings are located, we conceded fewer goals.\n34:55 Comment: But no, in the third, I apologize, only Roma and Juventus conceded fewer goals. But still more than a goal per game on average.\n35:3 Comment: Gamshik! Wonderful cutting pass from Alla Mertens! And it was probably unnecessary. Too tricky. The ball was intercepted.\n35:14 Comment: But most of the rebounds today belong to the Nepolitans. That's the most important thing. The Romans don't take selections. Therefore, after each attack of the Nepolitans, another follows.\n35:25 Comment: It's very hard to catch your breath here. It is also psychologically difficult. You are only working for destruction. There is not always enough strength for this.\n35:37 Comment: Milinkovic Savic scored one of the goals against Roma in the cup clash. Let me remind you that Latso won unexpectedly in the first match. I mean the score is unexpected. 2-0.\n35:53 Comment: That is, do not miss this match from Roma.\n35:55 Comment: This is an achievement. Well, last week Latso lost 2-3. However, he is in the finals.\n36:0 Comment: Dangerous attack, shot and corner, as far as I understand. No, not even a corner will be awarded. But I dare to assume that Mertens was trying to throw the ball behind Starokoshi’s ears.\n36:12 Comment: He shows us another side of Mertensovsky’s art. Yes, he is here too. Good Anderson throws the ball.\n36:23 Comment: By the way, there was a touch of the thigh.\n36:25 Comment: But probably not enough for a foul. Anderson how he fights. Three times, three times within 7-8 seconds, he took the ball away from his opponent.\n36:35 Comment: You don't often see Anderson like this. Great. The Brazilian got wound up.\n36:41 Comment: And yet I have a feeling that the rules were violated there. When he threw the ball, remember, they slowed down his running pace a little and another defender already provided backup.\n36:53 Comment: Throw into the penalty area. Kalikhon puts pressure on one of the defenders, forcing him to knock out the shaft. Well, at least it’s not a corner one.\n37:3 Comment: Wow, Anderson did a great job here. Let them both attack each other dirty, holding each other by the T-shirt, by the shorts.\n37:16 Comment: There were fouls, but they were mutual, so they were still consistent.\n37:21 Comment: Georginio. Coulibaly. These are his pauses before the transmission. Still, he is far from being a master at playing passing.\n37:31 Comment: But still one of the most liquid players in Napoli. His transfer value there is about 35 million euros.\n37:39 Comment: Well, only Incini, as far as I understand, is more expensive in this team.\n37:44 Comment: Anderson. Anderson throws the ball to Immobile. Poor Immobile.\n37:51 Comment: And Murgio continues to cuckoo and run without the ball. Finally, he met him.\n38:0 Comment: True, I couldn’t play during the aggravation. And Murgio back.\n38:5 Comment: It’s difficult, difficult, of course, for this guy. 20 years. 20 years old, a graduate of Roman football, a graduate of Lazio.\n38:13 Comment: This is his eleventh game this season.\n38:20 Comment: Moreover, only the second game in the base.\n38:24 Comment: In fact, Alexandra Murgio even scored naked against Torino this season.\n38:30 Comment: For which we congratulate him.\n38:33 Comment: Also an interesting character. Quietly, Simone Inzaghi brings young players to the core of Lazio.\n38:40 Comment: And I must say that Alexandra Murgio was one of Simon Inzaghi’s main players.\n38:46 Comment: In general, he was one of the leaders of the Lazio youth team.\n38:49 Comment: From which Simona came to the main team of Lazio.\n38:57 Comment: Nsinya na Gamshika. A little wider on Alan. We see very good football played by Alan today.\n39:3 Comment: Lots of interceptions. There are many such impulses for attack.\n39:10 Comment: Kulebalim came from him.\n39:13 Comment: Here again, again, again these folk dances.\n39:19 Comment: African.\n39:22 Comment: Maybe even Senegalese.\n39:26 Comment: Let me remind you that this is a Senegalese with a French passport.\n39:29 Comment: In short, he hesitates when launching attacks.\n39:35 Comment: This is one of its disadvantages.\n39:38 Comment: Georginio broke the rules.\n39:40 Comment: 40th minute of the Lazio-Napoli match.\n39:43 Comment: I told you that in recent years these teams have been playing quite effectively.\n39:49 Comment: And all the matches work out. One of them.\n39:51 Comment: Be sure to remember if there is any pause.\n39:54 Comment: Because there was something incredible there.\n39:58 Comment: Two seasons ago.\n40:0 Comment: Well, in the first round match the teams played 1-1.\n40:4 Comment: Before that we played 0-2.\n40:9 Comment: That is, Napoli won 2-0 against Lazio last season.\n40:14 Comment: And Napoli also beat Lazio at home last season.\n40:18 Comment: With a score of 5-0.\n40:21 Comment: In general, there is something to take revenge for.\n40:25 Comment: Georginio.\n40:28 Comment: Gamshik, Georginio.\n40:30 Comment: Well, the current process is sluggish.\n40:32 Comment: Perhaps Napoli will wait for the moment when Lazio tries to stifle the opponent and put pressure on them.\n40:39 Comment: And the zones will be freed up for the breakthroughs of Incinio, Mertens, and Calijon.\n40:48 Comment: Let's talk a little about substitutions.\n40:50 Comment: Because Napoli is in the reserve first of all.\n40:53 Comment: There are enough players who can change the game a little.\n40:58 Comment: Goalkeepers Cabral and Sepe.\n41:1 Comment: Defenders Maksimovich, Kirikesh, Maggio, Gulya.\n41:6 Comment: Midfielders Diawara, Zelinsky, Rock.\n41:9 Comment: Striker Lean Trinho, there is a Brazilian.\n41:13 Comment: Milik and Pavaletti.\n41:16 Comment: We will see one of these two forwards. Hardly two at once.\n41:19 Comment: And I am more than sure that we will also find the Pole Zelinsky Napoli today.\n41:27 Comment: Oh, how great Incinio turned around.\n41:29 Comment: But Philippe Anderson once again played excellently against him in the selection.\n41:34 Comment: How many interceptions and tackles has he already made in the first half?\n41:38 Comment: Plus he was also the initiator of one dangerous attack.\n41:42 Comment: Remember when he shot from under the defender?\n41:44 Comment: Forward cast.\n41:53 Comment: Of course, of course, we must say that there are not enough football players in Latvia.\n41:59 Comment: I haven’t touched on this topic yet, but the football in the first half of the first half turned out to be quite exciting.\n42:4 Comment: Now, I think it's time to say that Biglia, the main central midfielder, is missing.\n42:13 Comment: which is on the British agenda from time to time.\n42:16 Comment: There is also such a cast on Immobile.\n42:18 Comment: Will Immobile be the first?\n42:20 Comment: Oh, Pepperrain has failed on Immobile now.\n42:24 Comment: And he hits the empty goal.\n42:26 Comment: Yes.\n42:28 Comment: First of all, you know, I want to applaud Chiru Immobile.\n42:32 Comment: Well, for making the most of this moment.\n42:37 Comment: Well, the maximum, of course, would be a goal if it hit that empty goal.\n42:40 Comment: Secondly, this is where he didn’t fall.\n42:43 Comment: He didn’t squirm, didn’t demand anything.\n42:45 Comment: And I think Reina would definitely have received a yellow card if Immobile had crashed onto the lawn.\n42:50 Comment: Here he is hitting him with his hip.\n42:53 Comment: In general, Pepperrain is now...\n42:58 Comment: ...that was wrong.\n42:59 Comment: Well, the coaching staff of the Italian national team is here too. Everything is in place.\n43:2 Comment: Mertens! Incine's dangerous attack!\n43:6 Comment: Past the gate!\n43:8 Comment: Is there a better chance for Role Lorenzo that he will stand on an empty net?\n43:11 Comment: And so, as you can see, Role Lorenzo stood up at the top to distinguish himself.\n43:14 Comment: No one had time to meet his right hand neatly into the center of the penalty area.\n43:19 Comment: Mertens created everything for him. Well, perfect pass. It just hits. It just hits.\n43:29 Comment: Yes, dripping afterwards, Naples fans and Insigne himself did not remember this episode as fatal.\n43:36 Comment: It's now 2-0 in the locker room, as they say. That's it.\n43:42 Comment: Sit in the bunker, wait for your chances to counter-play. And how strong Napoleon is in quick attacks.\n43:49 Comment: Actually, one of the quick attacks has now been launched.\n43:52 Comment: 44th minute. Kulebali with the ball.\n43:56 Comment: Anderson! Anderson again. Intercepts the ball.\n44:2 Comment: Well, I repeat, this is still far from Anderson’s fairy tales, which he showed the season before last.\n44:11 Comment: He is good, we see, in tackling, in destruction, but in attack. He then simply picked up the ball and created.\n44:23 Comment: By the way, it seems to me that Irati will not add a single minute, because there were a minimum of stops.\n44:29 Comment: Well, they celebrated the goal there, there was a yellow card. Yes, that's probably all. I probably didn’t remember any injuries.\n44:39 Comment: Good football.\n44:41 Comment: Good mobility for those and others. Not a bad pace.\n44:45 Comment: And again, Lazio has a chance to get back the goal. This is the main thing.\n44:51 Comment: In general, the match is not one-way traffic.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Well, here we go.\n0:2 Comment: Time at number 2.\n0:3 Comment: And immediately a long pass towards the Napoli penalty area.\n0:8 Comment: The Nepolitans line up in a line of four defenders.\n0:11 Comment: And immediately all the midfielders, except Mertons, also lined up\n0:15 Comment: lining up.\n0:16 Comment: And essentially, in the defensive phase, Napoli appears as a team,\n0:21 Comment: playing in a 4-5-1 formation.\n0:23 Comment:  Like this.\n0:25 Comment: But I think if we see more episodes like this,\n0:30 Comment: For Napoli to be so tight in defense, it will be already\n0:32 Comment: closer to the end of the game, if the score remains like this.\n0:37 Comment: And Lazio will try to storm somehow.\n0:40 Comment: Let's talk about the lineups.\n0:41 Comment: There are no changes for Lazio.\n0:46 Comment: Three central defenders - Radu, Wallace and Pastos.\n0:49 Comment: On the left, Lukako is operating along the entire edge, and on the right is Basta.\n0:53 Comment: In the center of midfield - Parola, Murgia, Milinkovic, Savic\n0:57 Comment: and Anderson.\n0:58 Comment: Well, the center forward is Ciro and Mobel.\n1:2 Comment: The Neapolitans have a defender at the Rhine gate on the right\n1:6 Comment: Yusai, on the left - Strinich, in the center - Kulebali and Alpiol.\n1:10 Comment: Their central wards are Gamshik, Georginio, Allan.\n1:16 Comment: Callejon, Insigno and Mertons are the attack.\n1:19 Comment: That same bright, memorable attack on the field.\n1:26 Comment: The shot to the rebound did not arrive in time for Calejon, balance\n1:30 Comment: lost.\n1:31 Comment: The main orbiter of this meeting is Masimiliano

Allan is next to Calejon.\n1:58 Comment: Yusai runs in.\n2:0 Comment: Allan gives it to the center.\n2:1 Comment: Allan again, how much contact with the ball.\n2:6 Comment: Today he is, as they say, on fire.\n2:9 Comment: Although, again, Naples have competition in the middle of the field\n2:12 Comment: This season is quite serious.\n2:15 Comment: Amadou Diawara is also vying for one of the three positions here,\n2:19 Comment: a super talented young player, both Marco Rocco and Peter\n2:22 Comment: Zelinsky.\n2:23 Comment: Long shot.\n2:24 Comment: Strakoshka copes with this blow.\n2:28 Comment: Recruitment for Insigne.\n2:29 Comment:  Another attempt.\n2:30 Comment: Here the Albanian takes the ball tightly.\n2:33 Comment: Well, that's the momentum of the first half.\n2:38 Comment: The Nepolitans picked up the ball again.\n2:39 Comment: They are moving forward again in large forces.\n2:41 Comment: And Loziale is practically eight behind the ball line.\n2:47 Comment: Both Mobile and one of the attacking players, either Savic or\n2:52 Comment: Anderson are waiting for some kind of rebound.\n2:55 Comment: Now, you see, Anderson and Mobile.\n2:58 Comment: The rest are all behind the ball line.\n3:0 Comment: Gamshik plays wall with Insigne.\n3:2 Comment: Insigne sees Mertens, and Mertens throws the ball,\n3:6 Comment: but it's a bit far.\n3:8 Comment: Mertens threw the ball away.\n3:9 Comment: Selection.\n3:10 Comment: Good for the floor.\n3:16 Comment: Just good.\n3:17 Comment: I don’t even want to criticize Latso here.\n3:20 Comment: When the Nepolitans have this ball control,\n3:23 Comment: When they catch their game, they catch their opponent's\n3:29 Comment: mistakes.\n3:30 Comment: And here's Psy, Jorginho cuts into the right flank.\n3:36 Comment: Kirikon a

the first half, had the opportunity\n4:1 Comment: add, there is already an empty gate, close it more precisely\n4:4 Comment: to the far posts.\n4:5 Comment: In my opinion, Ostrokosha finally touched the ball.\n4:7 Comment: Anyway, I hit the ball.\n4:9 Comment: Back to the center again.\n4:10 Comment: Oh, this is a repeat of the episode when Hamshik shot from outside the penalty area\n4:14 Comment: punched through.\n4:15 Comment: And one more try from Ensign.\n4:17 Comment: Total superiority in ball control, control\n4:20 Comment: territory, by the number of blows, blows of the door,\n4:24 Comment: left moments.\n4:25 Comment:  No, it was not.\n4:26 Comment: Here, even if the ball hit your hand, of course,\n4:30 Comment: no penalty.\n4:31 Comment: Don't play the hand.\n4:32 Comment: Your also even moved this hand away from contact with the ball.\n4:35 Comment: Feed.\n4:36 Comment: Indeed, corner.\n4:37 Comment: The most dangerous thing for Naples here is, of course, the machine gun.\n4:41 Comment: And Albeol.\n4:42 Comment: And Mobele acts technically.\n4:47 Comment: What, wasn't there a foul?\n4:50 Comment: Mobele, by the way, doesn't argue.\n4:53 Comment: Well, maybe this is such a position, right?\n4:56 Comment: What, maybe there is a Brawler here, if anything, Knidam.\n5:0 Comment: Or maybe there really is nothing.\n5:3 Comment: Fisai.\n5:6 Comment: Deploys the attack to the center.\n5:8 Comment: More and more often, in the second half, we started working\n5:12 Comment: through the right edge, because Kyusai joined here\n5:15 Comment: And Allan, and Kalikonchik.\n5:17 Comment: It's already falling here.\n5:18 Comment: In general, I must say that of the two full-backs\n5:21 Comment: At Kyusai and Strinic, Strinic was more active.\n5:24 Comment: In the first half, here he is with the key, fighting with the pasta.\n5:28 Comment: Blue is a whirlwind again.\n5:31 Comment: Running in again.\n5:33 Comment: Again one-touch advantageous pass,\n5:35 Comment: so that the opponent does not have time to change lanes.\n5:37 Comment: Allan, poor handling, we have to throw the ball.\n5:39 Comment: He does it great!\n5:42 Comment:  Fantastic!\n5:43 Comment: Lorenzo and Sinya have fully rehabilitated themselves for their mistake\n5:47 Comment: sample of the first half, handling the hardest\n5:51 Comment: The pass, in fact, with one touch he completed the processing\n5:55 Comment: the ball, and a goal kick.\n5:58 Comment: Bravo, Lorenzo!\n5:59 Comment: Bravo, Allan!\n6:1 Comment: Bravo, Napoleon!\n6:2 Comment: 2-0!\n6:4 Comment: Well, shall we close the shop?\n6:7 Comment: To be honest, I want to root for Latsev, I want to\n6:9 Comment: cheer for the intrigue first of all, but with such Napoleon\n6:13 Comment:  what can you do?\n6:14 Comment: Well, yes, yes, as a hint, whoever, if not Xinya, should\n6:19 Comment: including the Italian national team to pull along.\n6:22 Comment: Well, this is how the pass turned out.\n6:27 Comment: Well, again, yes, there would be no happiness.\n6:30 Comment: Allan handled the ball poorly, he was on point\n6:34 Comment: hips, he was already under pressure, and the only option\n6:37 Comment: It was easy to throw the ball forward.\n6:39 Comment: In the end, I pierced the ball under the goalkeeper like this.\n6:41 Comment: Replacement, replacement whale, Murgio leaves, whale, which by some\n6:46 Comment: Publications planned as a starting player,\n6:49 Comment: appears, and Bastos, as I understand it, also leaves the field.\n6:57 Comment: Yes, there are complaints about the action, attention, a dangerous moment,\n7:1 Comment: and to whom?\n7:6 Comment: They just ruined it.\n7:10 Comment: They just threw their own super chance into the trash.\n7:13 Comment: Let's see how it was Anderson, a wonderful transfer, and\n7:16 Comment: with the first touch in this game, with the first touch,\n7:19 Comment: As Mertons did this week, the whale could have made his mark.\n7:23 Comment: In the end, he rolled this ball somewhere not into the bush.\n7:25 Comment: Why not try to break something out of the hole while finishing?\n7:31 Comment: Why did he give that pass?\n7:33 Comment: But once again we note Hamshik’s competent actions here,\n7:35 Comment: who didn’t touch the ball, you never know it could have ended up there\n7:38 Comment: offside and gave Insina the opportunity to score\n7:41 Comment: My 13th goal this season.\n7:44 Comment: Insine is super-efficient, Insine is good.\n7:49 Comment: Attack on Apel, Lasov faltered, Imobili had a chance,\n7:53 Comment: Anderson on the rebound, soft serve towards Imobili,\n7:58 Comment: Basta, look how high he’s pushing his opponent,\n8:2 Comment: How close he was to other people's lessons.\n8:4 Comment: So, Laurenson Insigne, 13th goal this season.\n8:10 Comment: And they often compare that Milinkovic himself received a yellow card,\n8:20 Comment: for, as I understand it, conversations, because it wasn’t he who forged.\n8:24 Comment: He's not the foril.\n8:26 Comment: Basta was a friend here.\n8:28 Comment: Well, not exactly a friend, just really violated correctly.\n8:32 Comment: Well, there was no hand playing here, under any circumstances.\n8:35 Comment: So, Lawrence Incine is often compared both in his manner and in his football performance,\n8:41 Comment: with Zola, with John Franco Zola.\n8:44 Comment: And Cinder is probably one of those rare examples,\n8:47 Comment: when the Italian flourished beyond the Pieniny Peninsula.\n8:54 Comment: And many are talking about the fact that Lawrence can find himself in Europe, in another team,\n8:59 Comment: prove in another league.\n9:1 Comment: Well, of course, it must be a top team.\n9:4 Comment: What about Klim?\n9:5 Comment: Otherwise, what’s the point of leaving your homeland?\n9:9 Comment: He's local, Neapolitan, his own board.\n9:12 Comment: Although he also had conflicts with local fans,\n9:15 Comment: And he expressed dissatisfaction; there were various conflicts.\n9:19 Comment: Lukako, he's offside.\n9:21 Comment: That's where Lukako is.\n9:31 Comment: Afterwards, Hood came into the center of defense instead of Bastos.\n9:41 Comment: But in general a defender is enough.\n9:43 Comment: By the way, I listed the reserve in Naples,\n9:46 Comment: But I didn’t have time to talk about the substitutes in Lazeo in the first half.\n9:49 Comment: There are goalkeepers Ivan Vargic and Margus Adamonis.\n9:52 Comment: By the way, a Lithuanian goalkeeper.\n9:55 Comment: Defender Gabaron.\n9:58 Comment: One defender, Hood, has already entered the field.\n10:1 Comment: Cassio Cordoselli.\n10:4 Comment: Young player. I'm already at the midfield line.\n10:7 Comment: Luis Alberto, Luca Creco.\n10:9 Comment: Forwards Filip Djordjevic, Christiano Lombardi, Mamadou Tounkara.\n10:13 Comment: Well, Baldekitar has already entered the field.\n10:22 Comment: Mertens is accelerating.\n10:24 Comment: And the enemy does not give up Insina.\n10:31 Comment: You know, there is a saying that\n10:36 Comment: if you love what you do,\n10:38 Comment: then you will never have a single working day in your life.\n10:41 Comment: Well, about like that, huh?\n10:43 Comment: Then you'll never go to work.\n10:45 Comment: I have a feeling that for Insigne and Mertens,\n10:47 Comment: when, again, they are enemies,\n10:49 Comment: Football will never work.\n10:52 Comment: For them, pleasure is a thrill.\n10:54 Comment: A way to realize your ambitions and your skills,\n10:58 Comment: Which Gogogo has.\n11:0 Comment: Strinich.\n11:2 Comment: We almost collided with Incine.\n11:4 Comment: Alan. Hamshek.\n11:6 Comment: That's the one who scored today.\n11:11 Comment: Well, Mertens. Mertens still needs to make his mark.\n11:13 Comment: Mertens is, after all, a contender for the title of top scorer\n11:20 Comment: Italian championship, although he has rivals there.\n11:24 Comment: In general, I must say, a great fight unfolded\n11:27 Comment: for the title of best sniper of series A.\n11:35 Comment: At the moment Andrea Belotti from Torino is leading this race.\n11:39 Comment: He has 24 goals.\n11:41 Comment: It is true that Jack of Rome is secluded.\n11:43 Comment: Jack has been extremely productive this season.\n11:48 Comment: Also 24 goals.\n11:51 Comment: An interesting statistic is that Belotti scored 13 first goals.\n11:55 Comment: 13 goals that opened the scoring.\n11:58 Comment: This is also a very important indicator.\n12:2 Comment: Goncal Higuain has 3 fewer goals.\n12:4 Comment: Mar Icardi has 20 goals.\n12:6 Comment: Mertens also has 20 and Mobile 18.\n12:9 Comment: Well, then it's a big scam.\n12:13 Comment: It’s all the same, it seems to me, to Mobile, and Mertens, and Icardi, and Higuain, and Jack, and Belotti.\n12:17 Comment: claim to be the best sniper.\n12:21 Comment: With different chances, but still.\n12:23 Comment: Forward cast.\n12:25 Comment: And Mobile tries, fights, claims and earns, in my opinion, a corner after all.\n12:30 Comment: There was an assistant behind the gate, he saw everything perfectly.\n12:33 Comment: It didn't register.\n12:34 Comment: But here's the thing. Even before that, the ball left Anders in the field.\n12:39 Comment: He spins and holds the ball for a long time.\n12:43 Comment: And Strinich not only takes the ball, he also thinks about passing with his heel while under pressure.\n12:50 Comment:  That was great.\n12:53 Comment: Alan.\n12:55 Comment: Once again a delightful treat.\n12:58 Comment: Borya. Kalikhon.\n13:0 Comment: Kalihon to the far post.\n13:2 Comment: It was something quite strange.\n13:4 Comment: It seems to me that he didn’t hit, he just shot so hard towards the attacker.\n13:9 Comment: Igardi.\n13:19 Comment: It was weird.\n13:21 Comment: He shot really hard towards the attacker.\n13:24 Comment: And the third substitution. That's it.\n13:26 Comment: And the hours of play didn't pass by.\n13:31 Comment: Belets is on the field instead of Basta.\n13:40 Comment: It was unexpected.\n13:42 Comment: Basta, yes, he, of course, is not from Rostov, and his name is\n13:49 Comment: not Vasily, but today have fun, show off your football skills\n13:55 Comment: He couldn't rap.\n13:58 Comment: Although I tried, I pushed hard, I supported the attack of the soul.\n14:2 Comment: Basta, but, you see, he has exhausted the replacements, he has the limit of his strength.\n14:5 Comment: I already said, he has a third season, five seasons\n14:9 Comment: Dina had shoulders in one season, in total, 9 years in Italy,\n14:14 Comment: Already practically a veteran.\n14:16 Comment: Well, Gabaron, the Spaniard on the field, appears, well, me\n14:20 Comment: as I understand it, to maintain flank activity, yes\n14:23 Comment: Not even just maintaining it, but creating it.\n15:10 Comment: A completely different caliber, Melinkovich, Savic.\n15:15 Comment: By the way, it seems to me that the football player is growing, and completely.\n15:18 Comment: soon teams will probably be interested in him\n15:21 Comment: different status, teams from other championships,\n15:23 Comment: Teams with money.\n15:26 Comment: Somehow, not so much.\n15:31 Comment: He is progressing, developing, I repeat, great ladies.\n15:38 Comment: On the field in attack, Mertens couldn't cope with the handling.\n15:42 Comment: I assume that Mertens will concede at some point.\n15:45 Comment: I think there’s a place on the field for Milik, after all Arkadyush\n15:51 Comment: Miliku, although Povaletti was also bought for many euros,\n15:57 Comment: But Povaletti somehow doesn't fit.\n16:0 Comment: There is a powerful gauge attached there, but it seems to me now,\n16:3 Comment: It doesn’t fit into the concept of current football on the field at all.\n16:8 Comment: But for a change, it will also be useful for a clip.\n16:23 Comment: Lukak, by the way, was the only one, no one was there to anyone\n16:27 Comment: I didn’t put pressure, I could have played more securely.\n16:31 Comment: Allan is good today, I never tire of praising him.\n16:35 Comment: It goes to the flank and whether there was contact there is a general question.\n16:39 Comment: Allan proves that, you know, even by the sound,\n16:42 Comment: because there is a microphone nearby, it seemed so.\n16:47 Comment: And again he shows that the heel of the prostrate man\n16:52 Comment: Lukako touched the ball.\n16:55 Comment: Well, of course, in the second half, after the second goal,\n17:0 Comment: Napole gives the ball to the opponent, maybe even the initiative,\n17:4 Comment: but at the same time continues to press high because,\n17:7 Comment: I repeat, then, as the first, as if by passing, the attacks begin\n17:13 Comment: In fatherhood, it's not always sinless.\n17:16 Comment: A hair, a tower, something already, Kolya, some, and a foot, that's all\n17:20 Comment: they can lead.\n17:21 Comment: And they need to be caught doing this.\n17:22 Comment: Oh, albiol, well, you can get mustard plaster for that too.\n17:27 Comment: An elbow to the back of the head, a poke.\n17:33 Comment: It's a bit rude, it's a bit rude.\n17:37 Comment: Gamshik.\n17:39 Comment: Gamshik scored in the match against Juveentus, compared\n17:46 Comment: with Lukako.\n17:47 Comment: And at the moment Marak has 110 goals left for Naples\n17:54 Comment: 5, only 5 left.\n17:59 Comment: Until Diego Armando Maradona's performance.\n18:7 Comment: Well, again, how correct, in fact, it was.\n18:10 Comment: How many seasons did Hamsik play, more than Maradona?\n18:15 Comment: And in general, well, you will agree, they are of different calibers after all\n18:17 Comment: figures.\n18:18 Comment: Oh, I'm sorry, yes, Hamsik scored 2 Juveentus goals,\n18:21 Comment: He also scored in the cup game this week, so\n18:25 Comment: 111, a beautiful number, by the way, and 4 goals to Maradona.\n18:33 Comment: And, of course, Marak, of course, has another ball,\n18:36 Comment: Beautiful figure, by the way, and 4 goals to Maradona.\n18:43 Comment: Today, you know, while walking with my family in the park, I saw\n18:50 Comment: a young man with such a sports jacket,\n18:55 Comment: On the back of which was written Hand of God.\n19:0 Comment: How bright is this phenomenon in history?\n19:3 Comment: world football, this brand is practically.\n19:7 Comment: Of course, I'm hinting at Maradona's goal with my hand, at the threshold\n19:10 Comment: Slovenia, at the World Cup.\n19:17 Comment: I’ll be honest with you, I even told my wife how.\n19:19 Comment: It was, what a match it was, what Maradona did.\n19:23 Comment: If you remember, there was quite a funny episode in the match\n19:28 Comment: with Juveentus in the championship in the previous round Mertens\n19:32 Comment: In a very similar manner, I also wanted to cheat, too\n19:36 Comment: I wanted to handle it like that, and he added in the end, he touched the ball\n19:40 Comment: and sent his goal with his hand, but the referees were on alert.\n19:54 Comment: Unlike the referee who officiated the match\n19:57 Comment: 1986.\n20:4 Comment: Ali Bin Nase, the same Tunisian who made history.\n20:8 Comment: Okay, we're being nostalgic now, if you allow it,\n20:12 Comment: because there was a pause, the damage was minor, but here is Latso\n20:16 Comment: He goes on the attack with the mood, nothing else really\n20:19 Comment: It’s not finished here, that same bench is still Roman, no\n20:24 Comment: covered as long as there are players like Anderson\n20:29 Comment: with character, with technique, with movement, Lukako, pass,\n20:35 Comment: here you can already see the double center, look, or Koshet,\n20:39 Comment: by the way, from my own, from Gabaron, who is regularly displaced\n20:42 Comment: from Brovka to the center of the penalty area in order to somehow react\n20:47 Comment: for these numerous sacrifices.\n20:49 Comment: It's probably a good tactic, though.\n20:54 Comment: If only Djordzhiovich could be useful for such programs,\n20:58 Comment: under such a flank.\n21:0 Comment: Gabaron, he's on the right now.\n21:11 Comment: His shot didn't work out and the ball hit the strinch,\n21:16 Comment: who actually stood on the side.\n21:23 Comment: And it’s unlikely that he could have somehow influenced the episode.\n21:26 Comment: The blows are not coming, they are not coming today, although there were chances, but\n21:35 Comment: Somewhere Peppa Reina also helped.\n21:38 Comment: Peppe Reina, well, let's really see how they will be\n21:43 Comment: The situation with the goalkeeper position in Naples.\n21:46 Comment: There are already reports that Mateo Perin, goalkeeper\n21:50 Comment: The Italian national team and Genoa are ready to move to Naples\n21:54 Comment: and become number one.\n21:56 Comment: It seems to me that it’s time, it’s been a while.\n21:59 Comment: And Perin stayed in Genoa, which was very decent\n22:3 Comment: level of the goalkeeper position.\n22:4 Comment: A very decent level goalkeeper who can improve.\n22:15 Comment: Well, Strakosha is progressing, as we can see, yes, he missed two goals,\n22:19 Comment: but at the same time he helped the team out several times.\n22:22 Comment: He is fighting with Marchetti for the main title.\n22:25 Comment: By the way, Marchetti should have more matches, but he didn’t play.\n22:29 Comment: since February 2, when he received two from Pescara, let Laso win.\n22:34 Comment: Still, Strakosha is in charge now.\n22:39 Comment: Tomas Strakosha, 22-year-old goalkeeper from Albania.\n22:46 Comment: Lukak, he easily works well in defense and doesn't lose his position.\n22:56 Comment: Tsavich further, Volosov, well, being under pressure from Tsal, he retreats.\n23:3 Comment: Radu technically played.\n23:11 Comment: Lukakom.\n23:15 Comment: Tsavich.\n23:17 Comment: So, strike position and Pepe Reina.\n23:22 Comment: In a luxurious leap.\n23:25 Comment: What you need for a television picture.\n23:28 Comment: This replay will probably be in super slow motion.\n23:30 Comment: He saw the moment of impact, so he dealt with it.\n23:33 Comment: But it was dangerous.\n23:35 Comment: Andersan.\n23:37 Comment: He gets out of the trap, although three people surrounded him.\n23:40 Comment: Cavic handled it in the best possible way.\n23:42 Comment: That's it, we have to take a break.\n23:44 Comment: Although, in theory, if I had processed it successfully right away, then I could have tried and broken through.\n23:48 Comment: Casting, good for defense.\n23:51 Comment: And Pepe Reina helps the team out again.\n23:54 Comment: Corner at Laso.\n23:56 Comment: That's inspiration.\n23:57 Comment: You can also hear it from the reaction of the stands.\n23:59 Comment: The defenses were not under siege.\n24:1 Comment: Listen, how's it going?\n24:3 Comment: How did the assistant chief see it?\n24:5 Comment: There were four players on approximately the same line.\n24:7 Comment: Some of Laso's players are under siege.\n24:9 Comment: But the burn did not rise and the fight was right.\n24:12 Comment:  Hit!\n24:14 Comment: And that was dangerous.\n24:16 Comment: From the defendants.\n24:18 Comment: I just, boom, slipped for a second.\n24:20 Comment: Noland center back.\n24:22 Comment: It was a solid blow.\n24:24 Comment: And I don't have the feeling that it was a blow.\n24:27 Comment: I think I was prepared for this blow from Rain.\n24:29 Comment: But he was perfectly prepared for this blow.\n24:32 Comment: Here it is in slow motion.\n24:35 Comment: Well, actually, it's not as dangerous as it might seem.\n24:38 Comment: However, China and its appearance on the field.\n24:42 Comment: It brought the whole thing to life.\n24:44 Comment: By the way, he is also a fairly marketable football player.\n24:46 Comment: Precious.\n24:48 Comment: But we still need to promote it.\n24:50 Comment: There’s no way he can become a full-fledged main.\n24:52 Comment: Laso, although talent, speed, tribulin.\n24:55 Comment: The ability to break into a striking position.\n24:58 Comment: It's all there.\n25:0 Comment: By the way, he scored quite a lot this season.\n25:2 Comment: Eight goals already.\n25:4 Comment: The last time Arturino scored.\n25:6 Comment: Here he is with the ball.\n25:8 Comment: Strike position.\n25:10 Comment: Ukaku.\n25:12 Comment:  And How?\n25:14 Comment: How does Laso not score?\n25:16 Comment: Who was this hero?\n25:21 Comment: One more thing.\n25:23 Comment: We see completely different football.\n25:25 Comment: Ildari platform.\n25:27 Comment: Joining man for new roster.\n25:30 Comment: Athletes63,\n25:42 Comment: O.Kishilyav 김 evolutionc Awich there is gay and cannot mierz\n25:45 Comment: get off your mobile\n25:48 Comment: Zarada in bisa 5 pumps up the opponent\n25:53 Comment: another criminal\n25:55 Comment: The segment is all intact, but Mertens counterattacks, Mertens gains speed, and can escape from the center of the field\n26:0 Comment: one on one, but he's waiting for Hoot, he'll screw him, he'll definitely screw him, but he's content here\n26:7 Comment: Mertens is the head. Bravo Huth, bravo! I take my words back, it would seem he is losing his balance here,\n26:19 Comment: but still he chose the ball, great play, well, here’s Kita, and he still beat Lukahu, he didn’t give it away, but how Lorenzo Insinin played here at the last moment\n26:32 Comment: It was he who now played the role of Reina, he helped the team out when Gabaron was already striking against an empty goal\n26:42 Comment: a real safe, you know, you can actually chalk up two goals to your account\n26:49 Comment: He scored one and helped out the other\n26:56 Comment: saved yet\n27:0 Comment: And again Huth, again Huth prevented Mertens from scoring, Mertens of course wants to score, he is an extremely team player\n27:10 Comment: He sees the field well, he’s not greedy, he gives when needed, but he has a taste for goals, he wants to score more and more.\n27:21 Comment: The serve managed to distance the Neapolitans from their own goal for a segment of the game\n27:31 Comment: let's not forget about the important old rule, according to which the best defense is, of course, an attack\n27:42 Comment: The transfer took place on Insinia, by the way it was not there and again the most elegant processing\n27:47 Comment: These short shields that don’t come down, well, Zelinsky, yes, they told me, I’m sure he’ll go on the field.\n27:55 Comment: Another thing is that this replacement is surprising in that Kolijo leaves the field, and he moves to the right edge\n28:5 Comment: Zelinsky himself, in theory, yes, yes, we now see him on the right in attack, or rather on the right in

let's call it that\n30:7 Comment: a dangerous episode, Mertens demands a penalty, but all that remains is, again, on the lawn, everyone is doing it for themselves,\n30:20 Comment: although the lawn is, of course, in excellent condition, Dris just tore off such a cry\n30:28 Comment: live game, in the second half, at the end of the Latz match against Napoli, round 31, third and fourth teams\n30:36 Comment: Championship meet Milinkovic Savic with the ball, long diagonal from Anders, pass to the far post,\n30:48 Comment: but he did it too early, Govoron continues to fight, but Pepe Reina is not the tallest of\n30:55 Comment: Modern goalkeepers, frankly speaking, but he knows how to jump out and dunk his hand well\n31:7 Comment: However, I still don’t want this one, not even a light, but a fire that lights up in half the field\n31:13 Comment: Napoles, no gas, I want more intrigue, and so Juventus is literally strangling all the main intrigue, yes,\n31:22 Comment: with my mighty hands, at least there is some diversity here in the fight for the Champions League, by the way,\n31:31 Comment: promised to tell about one absolutely amazing match that took place between Lattsev and\n31:36 Comment: Napole, this was the game of the last round, the last round of the season before last,\n31:45 Comment: and, well, besides the fact that in that game, by the way, such champion ambitions were played out,\n31:51 Comment: because Lattsev won in the 38th round with a score of 4-2 and beat Naples in the fight for this very one\n31:58 Comment: the Champions League, there was, of course, a crazy intrigue, Lattsev led 2-0, then Napoleon 2-2\n32:5 Comment: I equalized, Higuain made another, then Higuain missed the penalty, and after that in the most\n32:10 Comment: In the end, Onnasi and Klose, what a pity it is that he still doesn’t play for Lattsev, they did\n32:16 Comment: The score was 4-2, there was another important moment, after the attack Mertenz, by the way, could eventually find the ball\n32:24 Comment: Hamshik's head, due to Irakez, it is a little longer, and thus more dangerous.\n32:36 Comment: So, in one of our puff-making projects, which were on NTV+ channels, Alexander\n32:42 Comment: Ivanovich Shmurnov, a well-known commentator, did absolutely everything within the framework of the project\n32:48 Comment: unprecedented, he had to win back, an unprecedented bet on the account, he tried\n32:54 Comment: to predict the score of that match, believe it or not, he put it at 4-2, the odds were\n32:58 Comment: About 90, even more, and he won, such amazing events happen. Lattsov still\n33:8 Comment: in the attack, was Likoshet there, a prepared blow from Milinkevich Savich, he can hit it,\n33:14 Comment: We see it’s a little late here when his opponent met, so why not,\n33:22 Comment: but these shots have no accuracy, we see Mertens got confused here, there was no foul here,\n33:27 Comment: Although he was yelling, although you see, he’s hitting the ball, he’s playing the ball, he’s hooking his heel here,\n33:36 Comment: although there was contact, I still think it doesn’t look like a foul,\n33:43 Comment: sufficient for a penalty. Margamshik leaves the field, I have already said more than once that this is common for\n33:49 Comment: This season's replacement, Hamsik, of course, has amazing motor activity, and in the end\n33:55 Comment: the batteries are already running low, Sarii thanks him, and then Rock, Mark Rock, one of those thick ones, comes out onto the field\n34:11 Comment: Croatian diaspora on the Pieniny Peninsula, almost the entire Croatian national team plays in Serie A,\n34:18 Comment: And Mark Rock is one of those players who are called up to the national team,\n34:22 Comment: lately I've started getting a little more play time, and it can be quite useful\n34:31 Comment: in the middle of the field, good ball control, good technique, I think he will still have time to demonstrate it to you,\n34:38 Comment: Well, congratulations to Hamsik on a good game, even if he doesn’t score a goal, and his passes are solid.\n34:52 Comment: I’m sorry, it was Hamshik who gave it to Golihon, well, an assist, the captain can be pleased with himself.\n35:5 Comment: It’s tough, it’s Rock, he lost the ball and almost tore off his shirt with a hair, also this one, of course.\n35:13 Comment: hair, Dos Santos, central defender, 22-year-old Brazilian, such another product\n35:21 Comment: selective processing of Monaco, he spent the previous two seasons in France, but by the way, 10 million for\n35:27 Comment: It was transferred from Lazio to Braga, who owned the rights to it, and not Monaco. Game 20 for him in\n35:34 Comment: This championship, he has been a substitute more often lately, today in a dream.\n35:43 Comment: In general, of course, I remember how the hair played in the Roman derby, how he brought it in the most terrible way,\n35:51 Comment: I started to dribble around someone else’s penalty area, Strotlin, in my opinion, or one of the supporting players. I suddenly thought,\n35:57 Comment: that for a defender the surname is Vol Les, I think experts in the English language understand what I mean,\n36:5 Comment: not the best, not the best surname, not suitable. Ox, Wall, Forest, let's say, almost its absence.\n36:16 Comment: However, here is a player who is growing with Lazio, and now there is an important lesson,\n36:25 Comment: The game against Naples, one of the best attacking teams in the championship, is even better,\n36:31 Comment: If we take purely statistics, goals scored. Alan, Gulebaliy, Alan again.\n36:46 Comment: And Rock makes an inaccurate pass. Listen, cheer up, of course, the Roman eagles.\n37:3 Comment: Oh-oh-oh, you’re my little one, huh. No, it seemed, it seemed like a Lazio fan was crying, roaring,\n37:14 Comment: But in general, I think he really has reasons for this. Mimi loses the match,\n37:20 Comment: his team has been replaced. Dries Mertens and Arkadiusz Milik are leaving the field. You see, we are with you too\n37:26 Comment: we sorted it out, assuming that it was Milik, and not Pavleti, who would appear on the field. Arkadiusz Milik,\n37:34 Comment: Yes, his Neapolitan career, of course, is going very, very hard so far. And it’s not about the goals,\n37:42 Comment: They were there in the first part of the season, it’s a matter of injury. It’s a matter of injury, a terrible injury,\n37:48 Comment: which he received, damage to the rat-shaped ligaments, tears. And, of course, one can only wonder\n37:55 Comment: to be amazed, to be surprised by this modern medicine, which puts you back on your feet after such injuries\n38:0 Comment: More than four months, imagine. More than four months. Here is Milik in a strike position,\n38:6 Comment: The left hand is working, and it hits from it. He recovered very quickly and talked about it in various interviews,\n38:14 Comment: There's no point in writing him off. He's very determined to regain his place in the starting lineup.\n38:26 Comment: But at first he scored, remember, and in the Champions League, also there, Dynamo Kyiv scored 2.\n38:33 Comment: There was such a story. Finger with the ball, come on. Long pass forward to Lukako, active Lukako,\n38:39 Comment: He could score and could also become the author of a laundry program. And all this in one episode.\n38:44 Comment: Radum. Well, such a cordiality he had on the sidelines today. His area of ​​responsibility today was on\n38:57 Comment: a grab. A big hit here, of course, well done Starakosha fixed the ball tightly,\n39:6 Comment: because another Napoleon player was already there, Korshun, ready to finish. Oh, there was no hand play here.\n39:12 Comment: The public saw it. Hysaj, it seems to me, sent the ball into Albiol’s hand with his head. But this,\n39:19 Comment: Of course, it's not an attempt to play with your hand, it's more of an accident. However, there is a reason.\n39:28 Comment: It’s sad, of course, that in the very, very end, Napoles spends the last minutes with the ball and no\n39:36 Comment: Latso has the strength to continue the assault that has been outlined. After all, at some point it seemed that it was about to happen,\n39:43 Comment: It will happen soon, Latso will score his goal soon. Violation of the rules. Filippo Andersen,\n39:51 Comment: that circler, he continues to take forward. After all, at first he didn’t go for big ones at all.\n39:59 Comment: money. They bought him from Santos, in which he made his debut at the age of 17. And I remember,\n40:6 Comment: It rarely worked out; when I did, nothing worked. But then he admitted,\n40:9 Comment: that he changed his attitude towards training, towards food, began to eat more intelligently. And off we go.\n40:18 Comment: Radu here he dispersed the attack well. Lukako gets to the penalty area and violates the rules. More\n40:28 Comment: One yellow card and the next Hysaj. By the way, today there is, yes, an Albanian confrontation.\n40:36 Comment: We have an organized Hysai against Strakosha. True, Hysai did not directly threaten his own goal.\n40:46 Comment: colleagues on the national team. By the way, I’ll tell you briefly now. It’s interesting that just recently Strakosha\n40:52 Comment: He made his debut for the Albanian national team in a match against the Italian national team. Imagine. And as a starter\n40:58 Comment: It was put in by the Italian coach Debiasi. He said that Strakosi had reached another level and it was time,\n41:4 Comment: It's time for him to make his debut. Well, I think you remember how it ended. Italy won with\n41:10 Comment: The score is 2-0. Serve from a free kick. The Neapolitans cope. They are such a crowd\n41:19 Comment: We got to the ball and knocked it out. A long pass from Strakosha, accurate. Great, by the way, the pass was completed.\n41:33 Comment: We almost immediately passed the first line of pressure. Well, the extremely diligent Allan continues,\n41:40 Comment: including in the last minutes, seconds, running around with a vacuum cleaner and pulling all the balls towards you. I'm glad.\n41:56 Comment: But here the Romanian actually had such a poor quality pass. The ball bounced,\n42:3 Comment: That’s why Lukashenko’s pass, in turn, didn’t work either. Well, let’s take it slowly, though...\n42:15 Comment: But you must agree, yes, for a long time, there, for decades, when it came to endings, yes,\n42:21 Comment: remembered the match between Bayern and Manchester in this Barcelona Champions League final. Well, like a mantra\n42:29 Comment: They read, yes, Manchester was able to score two goals in two minutes. Why shouldn’t others do this?\n42:36 Comment: Well, now there is a fresh example of a Barcelona passenger. It's the same story.\n42:44 Comment: Therefore, of course, we will not bury Latsev. I will say this, at the moment in the online table\n42:49 Comment: Napoleon continues to occupy third place in the Italian Championship, with 67 points, regaining this lead\n42:57 Comment: 4 points from Roma. I remind you that you need to take second place in order to directly qualify for the Champions League.\n43:5 Comment: This is not only prestige, it is, of course, a lot of money guaranteed for participating in another stage.\n43:10 Comment: Lukako, what are you doing out of the blue? It's a mistake!\n43:18 Comment: And Latso is being pressed by Atalanta. She has one point less.\n43:24 Comment: If we talk about the calendar, firstly, I must say that Latso's unbeaten streak is interrupted.\n43:33 Comment: In rounds 21-22, Lazar suffered two defeats. They lost to Juventus and Uikeevu, and then 6-2 to Piscaro,\n43:40 Comment: 1-1 with Milan, 2-1 with Empoli, 1-0 with Udineso, 2-0 with Baloney, 3-1 with Torino, 0-0 with Calere.\n43:48 Comment: 2-1 win over Sesolo in the previous round. A great run.\n43:52 Comment: That is, 8 consecutive matches without defeat, including 6 wins and success in the Italian Cup.\n44:0 Comment: And here you have a home, sensitive defeat from Napoli.\n44:5 Comment: There are already halyards at the end, showdowns, noise, uproar, screaming, and so on.\n44:9 Comment: Less football, more emotions.\n44:11 Comment: Concerning the Neapolitan calendar.\n44:18 Comment: In the next round they will play Udineso, Domo, then Sesolo away.\n44:24 Comment: And there will be a great match in the 34th round of Internapol.\n44:27 Comment: Again, a lot of goals, a lot of noise and passion.\n44:34 Comment: Well, Lazzo is playing away against Genua in the next round. It's a tough trip.\n44:40 Comment: In any case, Lazziale needs to retain its place in the Europa League.\n44:47 Comment: By the way, Lazzo is, roughly, a team that was not so irresponsible in the Europa League.\n44:54 Comment: I remember, several seasons ago I reached the quarterfinals.\n45:3 Comment: It's also money.\n45:6 Comment: Kaakum has four minutes added to the regular time of the second half.\n45:11 Comment: Yes, the eagles have blown.\n45:14 Comment: They clipped their wings a little at the very end.\n45:18 Comment: It's a shame.\n45:23 Comment: Well, the Neapolitans are having a good week.\n45:26 Comment: Yes, they had certain chances, of course, to fight with Juventus on equal terms.\n45:34 Comment: And they could.\n45:39 Comment: But again Higuain, Gonzalo Higuain, scoring a double in response to a public match.\n45:45 Comment: All hopes are buried.\n45:46 Comment: Still, defeating Juvia.\n45:48 Comment: The very fact that Napoleon scored three goals at once against the Turin team is something that will be remembered.\n45:55 Comment: Well, here's another victory over Lazzo away.\n45:58 Comment:  Not bad.\n46:4 Comment: Insigne.\n46:5 Comment: Napoleus is no longer there.\n46:8 Comment: Milik.\n46:9 Comment: Good pass to Zelinsky.\n46:10 Comment: Kick and goal.\n46:11 Comment: An amazing combination.\n46:16 Comment: Well, listen, for every taste.\n46:20 Comment: Well, this gesture, this dub from Insigne, re-performed in this game.\n46:28 Comment: Double of Lorenzo Insigna.\n46:29 Comment: 14th goal in the current championship.\n46:32 Comment: But how was everything planned here?\n46:33 Comment: Firstly, Insigna himself started this attack.\n46:35 Comment: From our own half of the field.\n46:37 Comment: 3 on 3 attack is underway.\n46:38 Comment: 3 on 4 even, because Milik hid here in the corner of the screen.\n46:42 Comment: Congratulations to him.\n46:44 Comment: Oh, Zelinsky.\n46:45 Comment: Congratulations to him on his assist.\n46:46 Comment: He throws a touch to Insigne, who practically did not stop, running away from his half of the field.\n46:52 Comment: Hit to touch.\n46:54 Comment: Takes out 2-0.\n46:56 Comment: No amount of strokosha, no amount of berishi and martetti would have helped under the bar.\n47:2 Comment: Twice, by the way, with a rebound from the post, as far as I understand, the ball was sent into the goal by Insigna.\n47:7 Comment: We congratulate him because this...\n    \n\n    #######TASK \n    Provide a factually correct and detailed textual description of the game compiled from the information presented above from different sources, in more than 1000 words.\n            \"Cap:\": represents the captions published in the online portal usually within 30 seconds of the event.\n            \"E:\" represents events recorded exactly after the event happened.\n            \"Comment.\": represents the real-time noisy commentary from the commentator as the game progresses.\n    Don't mention sources of information like commentators or captions, write as if you saw them live.\n    \n    ",
    "summary": "In a captivating match at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome, Napoli showcased their formidable prowess with a commanding 3-0 victory over Lazio. The encounter began with both teams entering the field with significant expectations, given their impressive standings in the Serie A championship and recent strong performances in the Italian Cup.\n\nAs the game kicked off, Lazio lined up in a defensive formation, aiming to counter Napoli's aggressive play. Lazio's lineup featured Tomas Strakosha in goal, supported by a defensive line of Stefan Radu, Wallace, and Bastos, with Jordan Lukaku and Dusan Basta operating on the flanks. The midfield saw Marco Parolo, Alessandro Murgia, and Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, while the attack was spearheaded by the dynamic duo of Felipe Anderson and Ciro Immobile, who has been prolific this season.\n\nNapoli, on the other hand, fielded a full-strength squad. Pepe Reina returned between the posts after a brief injury spell, protected by a backline consisting of Elseid Hysaj, Kalidou Koulibaly, Raul Albiol, and Ivan Strinic. Their midfield was orchestrated by the experienced trio of Allan, Jorginho, and Marek Hamsik, providing the foundation for the attacking trio of Jose Callejon, Lorenzo Insigne, and Dries Mertens, one of the top scorers in Serie A.\n\nThe first few minutes of the match were tightly contested, with both sides struggling to gain control. Lazio focused on maintaining a disciplined defensive structure, while Napoli attempted to break through with quick, fluid movements. The ball predominantly moved in the middle of the park, with neither side creating clear-cut opportunities early on. A notable moment came when Lazio's Felipe Anderson showcased his dribbling skills, gaining valuable space, but his subsequent cross was well-defended.\n\nNapoli, maintaining their high pressing and quick passing game, began to find rhythm. Around the 24th minute, a brilliant interplay saw Mertens regain possession. He swiftly passed to Hamsik, who then delivered an impeccable through-ball to Callejon. The Spanish winger made no mistake, calmly slotting the ball past Strakosha, giving Napoli a well-deserved lead. It was a goal that exemplified Napoli's quick, incisive play, catching Lazio's defense off-guard.\n\nLazio responded with increased urgency. Felipe Anderson took the initiative, driving forward and testing Reina with a powerful shot that was deflected just wide for a corner. Despite these efforts, Napoli's defense, led by Koulibaly and Albiol, stood firm, thwarting several Lazio attacks. Immobile, usually a pivotal figure, found it difficult to penetrate Napoli's solid backline, as he was constantly marked and isolated.\n\nAs the first half progressed, Napoli continued to dominate possession and territory. Their midfield trio, especially Allan, was instrumental in cutting off Lazio's transitions and initiating attacks. Allan’s work rate and ability to win back possession were crucial. Lorenzo Insigne, displaying his usual flair, often cut inside from the left, causing problems for Lazio's defense. Despite this, Lazio managed to hold off further damage before the end of the first half, thanks in part to Strakosha's excellent goalkeeping.\n\nThe second half began with Lazio trying to mount a resurgence. However, Napoli's defensive organization and counter-attacking threat kept the pressure on the home side. Players like Lukaku and Basta pushed forward to support the attack, but Napoli's midfield and defense were always ready to intercept and counter.\n\nAround the 51st minute, Allan again showcased his defensive skills, intercepting a pass and setting up a swift Napoli attack. He found Insigne with a neat pass on the left. Insigne controlled the pass beautifully and fired home with precision, beating Strakosha and doubling Napoli's lead. This goal was a testament to Napoli's clinical finishing and swift transitional play.\n\nDespite being two goals down, Lazio continued to push for a breakthrough. Milinkovic-Savic and Murgia worked tirelessly in midfield to create opportunities, but Napoli's defense was resolute. Efforts from Immobile and Anderson were either blocked or saved, reflecting the frustration of the Lazio attack.\n\nAs the match neared its conclusion, Simone Inzaghi made substitutions in a final attempt to change the game's dynamics, bringing on fresh legs to augment his side’s attacking efforts. However, Napoli's tactical discipline and relentless pressing made it difficult for Lazio to find any rhythm or space.\n\nIn the dying moments of the match, Napoli cemented their victory with a well-executed counter-attack. Arkadiusz Milik, who had come on as a substitute for Mertens, played a crucial role. He received the ball from Insigne, who had initiated the play deep from his half. Milik then returned the favor with a timely assist to Insigne, who made a composed finish, scoring his second goal of the match. This third goal highlighted the depth and versatility within Napoli's squad, as even the substitutes made significant contributions.\n\nNapoli's 3-0 victory was a comprehensive display of their tactical superiority, defensive solidity, and attacking brilliance. Allan was particularly noteworthy for his exceptional performance, winning numerous tackles and setting the tempo in midfield. Strakosha, despite conceding three goals, made several vital saves that prevented the scoreline from being even more flattering for Napoli.\n\nLorenzo Insigne, with his double, was the standout performer, not only scoring but also being instrumental in Napoli's attacking plays. His ability to drift past defenders and execute precise finishes was a joy to watch, reaffirming his status as one of Serie A's elite forwards.\n\nCallejon’s opener was a masterpiece of team play, encapsulating Napoli's strategy to exploit quick transitions and catch Lazio's defense napping. The Spanish forward has proved his mettle time and again with timely goals and assists, and this match was no different.\n\nLazio, despite their valiant efforts, were outclassed by a Napoli side that executed their game plan to near perfection. Immobile, usually a prolific goal-scorer, was effectively neutralized by the Napoli defense, highlighting the visitors' tactical acumen and defensive organization.\n\nThis victory not only solidified Napoli’s position in the upper echelons of the Serie A standings but also served as a statement of intent. Their ability to perform consistently against top-tier teams underscores their potential to seriously challenge for the title. Meanwhile, Lazio, though disappointed, would look to regroup and address the tactical shortcomings exposed by Napoli in this encounter.\n\nAs the final whistle blew, Napoli's fans celebrated a significant away victory, while Lazio's supporters, though dejected, acknowledged the quality of their opponents. It was a game that highlighted the competitive spirit of Serie A, with Napoli emerging as triumphant conquerors, showcasing a blend of flair, discipline, and tactical genius."
