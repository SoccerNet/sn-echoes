    "summary": "AS Roma secured a 2-0 victory over Empoli, demonstrating their resilience and strategic acumen throughout the match. It was a fascinating fixture that saw varied tempo and tactics from both sides, as Roma looked to consolidate their standing in the Italian Serie A and build momentum ahead of the Coppa Italia semi-final. \n\nThe game kicked off with Roma displaying their traditional lineup, featuring Bruno Peres and the attacking trio led by Perotti on the left, Salah on the right, and Edin Dzeko spearheading the attack. Dzeko, having already scored 21 goals in the Italian championship, was only one behind Torino's striker Belotti. This match provided him the chance to close or surpass that gap.\n\nEmpoli began with a more complex situation due to the absence of their two main central defenders, Bellusci and Costa. Costa was suspended, and Bellusci missed out due to injury. The team was without Diussy as well due to disqualification. Despite these absences, Empoli's lineup saw Lorini on the right and veteran Pasqual on the left, with a central defense comprising SL and Federico Barba who is notably a product of Roma's youth academy.\n\nThe initial exchanges saw Roma in possession, displaying fluid movement especially from Salah and Perotti who frequently shifted flanks to exploit spaces. Salah, showing his customary speed and control, often moved closer to the center to engage in playmaking duties, reflecting Roma’s intent on taking control of the game from the start.\n\nEarly on, Edin Dzeko showed promising form as he latched onto several through balls, with Saleh supporting him effectively. This attacking prowess came to fruition in the 12th minute when Edin Dzeko scored the opening goal of the match. Receiving a well-timed knockdown from Antonio Rudiger after a corner, Dzeko found himself unmarked in the penalty area and slotted the ball into the net, leveling himself with Andrea Belotti in the race for the top scorer of Serie A with 22 goals each.\n\nEmpoli, despite their defensive frailty, responded with vigor, forcing several interceptions and attempts on goal. Thiam and Maccarone were notable in their forward thrusts but faced a robust Roma backline led by Rüdiger, Manolas, and Fazio. Their attempts were commendable but lacked the final touch as Empoli struggled to break through Roma's defensive structure.\n\nAs the first half progressed, Empoli had moments of ascendancy marked by possession and controlled passing. However, their inability to capitalize on half-chances and the disciplined Roma defense kept them from equalizing. El Kadoury, pivotal in Empoli’s midfield, tried to orchestrate attacking moves but with limited success. The first half ended with Roma leading 1-0, a scoreline reflective of their dominance and Empoli’s near-misses.\n\nThe second half began with renewed energy from both teams. Empoli made a determined effort, earning a corner early on. Croce’s delivery saw Marilunga's attempt saved by Roma’s goalkeeper Szczesny, showcasing his excellent reaction time and positioning. Empoli's intent was clear; they were pushing for an equalizer.\n\nRoma, maintaining their tactical shape, continued to exploit the flanks with Salah and Perotti causing constant problems for the Empoli defense. Salah’s pace and ability to cross the ball into dangerous areas were pivotal. In the 56th minute, Roma doubled their lead through another goal by Edin Dzeko. The goal came from an effective combination play where Salah, demonstrating his vision, delivered a precise cross for Dzeko to head past Skorupski, marking his 23rd goal of the season and solidifying his position as the league's top scorer.\n\nEmpoli made tactical substitutions, introducing Andrea Tello for Marilunga in a bid to recalibrate their midfield dynamic. Meanwhile, Roma continued their strategic onslaught, with Granier replacing Perotti, adding fresh legs to the midfield and providing more control and distribution.\n\nThis phase of the game saw Empoli trying to regain presence in midfield with Tello becoming increasingly involved in their build-up play. Thiam showcased his acceleration and ball control, but his efforts were often stymied by Roma’s well-organized defense. Empoli's persistent yet futile attempts reflected their underlying issues: a lack of clinical finishing and defensive lapses.\n\nIn the later stages, seeing the game under control, Roma introduced their talisman Francesco Totti, receiving a thunderous applause from the fans. Francesco Totti, embodying Roma's spirit, provided depth and experience on the pitch. His vision and passing kept Roma's midfield ticking and allowed them to manage the tempo.\n\nMassimo Macarone also came on for Empoli, hoping his experience could tilt the scales. Macarone, a seasoned forward, endeavored to combine with Krunic and Thiam to create scoring opportunities but found it difficult against Roma’s resolute defense.\n\nIn the dying minutes, Roma’s game management was impeccable as they controlled possession and mitigated any Empoli threats. A notable instance was when Salah, after a well-crafted move, saw his shot rattling off the crossbar, nearly adding a third for Roma. This sequence highlighted Roma's balanced approach, combining defensive solidity with attacking flair.\n\nEmpoli’s effort was tangible until the final whistle, evidenced by another attempt from Büchel which went over the bar. Despite developing promising plays and showcasing individual skill, Empoli lacked the cutting edge to breach Roma’s rear-guard.\n\nWith the final whistle, AS Roma emerged victorious with a 2-0 scoreline. This win bolstered their league campaign and provided them with a morale boost ahead of their crucial Coppa Italia fixture against Lazio. Edin Dzeko’s brace was pivotal, not only in securing the three points but also in him securing the top spot in the Serie A goal-scoring charts.\n\nEmpoli, while resilient, faced their seventh consecutive defeat, a streak that aligned with past club records. Despite their spirited performance, the lack of defensive cohesion and finishing left them without points, underscoring the challenges they face to lift themselves from the lower end of the table."
