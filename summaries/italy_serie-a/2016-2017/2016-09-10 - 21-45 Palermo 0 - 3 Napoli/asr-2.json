Well, let's watch football.\n0:32 Comment: Napoleon immediately switches to pressing, high pressing. It is clear that the team is charged and feels like a favorite in this match.\n0:39 Comment: They press high, I think there will be a lot of attacking, a lot of possession.\n0:43 Comment: And we know very well from last season that the team can do this well. Reminds me of something a la Spanish Barcelona.\n0:49 Comment: Yes, but rival Napoleon presents much more serious chances than Barcelona.\n0:56 Comment: Because...\n0:57 Comment: It’s impossible to play so calmly, it’s impossible not to miss counterattacks.\n1:2 Comment: And, in fact, the 4 goals that Naples have already conceded in two matches once again confirms this.\n1:7 Comment: It is interesting to watch Milik, for me personally, because I am very impressed by the game of this forward.\n1:12 Comment: And I liked it at the Euro, despite the fact that Livandovsky drew a lot of attention to himself.\n1:16 Comment: Milik had enough chances to convert more often and more.\n1:20 Comment: But still, I think he’s a good striker. He scored a lot for Ajax, and now he’s scoring regularly for Naples.\n1:25 Comment: The fashion for white hair did not escape Lorenzo Insigni.\n1:28 Comment: He now also sports a hairstyle a la Leo Messi.\n1:33 Comment: By the way, Lorenzo Insigni was not called up to the Italian national team.\n1:35 Comment: During the last matches I lost a little confidence in the Italian team.\n1:41 Comment: Now that the team is headed by Jampier Ventura.\n1:43 Comment: But he will start in Naples, although colleagues from the Dolla Sport newspaper did not expect Insigni to appear from the first minutes today.\n1:51 Comment: Everyone wants to be like Messi, right?\n1:53 Comment: Well, of course. Insignes are sometimes similar even in the way they play.\n1:55 Comment: Well, here in Naples they simply pray for him.\n1:58 Comment: He is a real Neapolitan, he belongs to him.\n2:1 Comment: And when he played at a high level, the fans were simply delighted.\n2:6 Comment: By the way, the fans are also delighted with Mark Hamsik, because the man has already spent 10 years at the club.\n2:12 Comment: 10 years in Naples, 10 years in Naples.\n2:14 Comment: And, of course, in my opinion, he is the longest-living foreigner in Serie A.\n2:20 Comment: No one has played in the same club for 10 years.\n2:23 Comment: Of course, it's just respect.\n2:25 Comment: Yes, huge.\n2:27 Comment: Yes, of course, every year, in every transfer campaign, they plan to buy Mark Hamsik,\n2:33 Comment: but for now they are keeping him in Naples.\n2:35 Comment: And he himself stays here with pleasure.\n2:38 Comment: The president of the club, Aurelio de Laurentiis, speaks separately about this.\n2:41 Comment: Gamshik is our everything.\n2:42 Comment: Hamsik is an incredibly important person for Naples.\n2:46 Comment: Bata Yaylo on your screens.\n2:47 Comment: One of those who was in Palermo last season.\n2:51 Comment: Well, you can really count them on one hand here.\n2:53 Comment: Just a new club.\n2:55 Comment: Given that Davido Balardini was fired after two rounds,\n3:0 Comment: The wording looks very strange.\n3:3 Comment: He considered that the club conducted an unsuccessful transfer campaign,\n3:7 Comment: although there are a lot of new players,\n3:9 Comment: and some of them are quite qualified, national team players,\n3:12 Comment: but nevertheless he decided to criticize the president,\n3:14 Comment: and Maurizo Zamparini cannot stand being criticized.\n3:17 Comment: And he immediately dismissed Balardini.\n3:20 Comment: And then Roberto Dedzerbi came.\n3:23 Comment: I always enjoy watching the match start\n3:25 Comment: because from the first 5-7 minutes it is clear what kind of football the teams will play.\n3:30 Comment: That is, I personally now already see that Napoleon will dominate,\n3:33 Comment: Napoleon will meet very high, press,\n3:35 Comment: try to force your opponent to make a mistake and immediately punish.\n3:38 Comment: Palermo is clear that it won't have very many chances,\n3:44 Comment: but he will probably still play as number two\n3:46 Comment: and try to punish the opponent on counterattacks and catch your own small moments.\n3:51 Comment: Palermo has performers.\n3:53 Comment: And the same Diamanti, this is a serious force,\n3:55 Comment: Despite being 33 years old, he is still very highly regarded in Italian football.\n4:0 Comment: He returned from the Guangzhou Evergrande team.\n4:3 Comment: They went there with Gelardin.\n4:6 Comment: Gelardin played for Palermo last season, and now Diamanti.\n4:8 Comment: Pash, can I make a joke? Is anyone really returning from China?\n4:11 Comment: You understand, there are now football players of a higher level.\n4:14 Comment: That is, Diamanti is probably no longer listed there.\n4:17 Comment: And here Palermo is very welcome.\n4:23 Comment: Pass forward from Koulibaly.\n4:24 Comment: Milik.\n4:25 Comment: I tried to handle the ball.\n4:26 Comment: It seems like we managed to save it.\n4:27 Comment: But here Palermo also plays quite tightly.\n4:30 Comment: And so far, Naples does not provide freedom to football players.\n4:33 Comment: They play tight defense because they sit deep enough behind the center line.\n4:38 Comment: And Napoleon needs to carry out good positional attacks in order to open such a dense, dense opponent’s defense.\n4:44 Comment: Well, by the way, Palermo, in general, tries to control the ball.\n4:47 Comment: So far in the first five minutes it’s about 50/50.\n4:50 Comment: With only one exception, which is mostly at their own gates.\n4:54 Comment: But statistics.\n4:55 Comment: This is usually not addressed.\n4:55 Comment: So no one will write where these 50% of those recruited were.\n5:0 Comment: Carlos Embalo falls back.\n5:2 Comment: A very interesting football player.\n5:4 Comment: He represents Guinea Bissau.\n5:6 Comment: He has been in the Palermo system for quite a long time.\n5:11 Comment: Went for rent several times.\n5:13 Comment: And before this season, it was decided to finally give him a chance in the main team.\n5:18 Comment: He spent last season in Bresha and scored five goals for this team.\n5:24 Comment: And behind the side.\n5:25 Comment: Christian Maggio will throw.\n5:29 Comment: Not bad.\n5:30 Comment: And there is a first chance.\n5:31 Comment: Feed too high.\n5:33 Comment: Who is there to blame like that?\n5:34 Comment: On Insindi, who is barely sixty meters tall.\n5:40 Comment: Palermo sits deep.\n5:42 Comment: Now, most likely, there will be a serve against Milik.\n5:44 Comment: And maybe Insindi will also dribble.\n5:47 Comment: The two of them meet him.\n5:48 Comment: They didn't let me in.\n5:50 Comment: Foul.\n5:51 Comment: The judge is absolutely right.\n5:52 Comment: The hands were on, let's say, the hip.\n5:55 Comment: In the opponent's dribbling lineup.\n5:57 Comment: Therefore, the judge understood the situation absolutely correctly.\n5:59 Comment: There will be a very dangerous free kick.\n6:1 Comment: Yes, especially since Naples has several great standard performers.\n6:6 Comment: Let's look again.\n6:7 Comment: Diamanti.\n6:8 Comment: He caught Jorginho with his hands.\n6:11 Comment: And right in the center.\n6:12 Comment: Twenty-three, twenty-four meters to the gate.\n6:15 Comment: Great chance.\n6:16 Comment: Fairy tale.\n6:19 Comment: Club legend Diego Armando Maradona.\n6:20 Comment: I think now I could figure it out practically with my eyes closed from this point.\n6:25 Comment: There is also a club legend, Lorenzo Incia.\n6:28 Comment: And also Fauzi Gulyan, who can shoot with his left foot.\n6:32 Comment: Josip Posovets puts up a wall.\n6:34 Comment: Cornerkeeper from Croatia, who replaced long-time Palermo goalkeeper Stefano Sorentino.\n6:41 Comment: So he left the team.\n6:42 Comment: But now Posovets.\n6:43 Comment: He is only twenty years old.\n6:45 Comment: Well, over the wall or into the goalkeeper's corner?\n6:47 Comment: Through the wall, yes, most likely?\n6:48 Comment: Hit through the wall, of course.\n6:50 Comment: You probably would have punched it like that.\n6:51 Comment: No, I can't.\n6:52 Comment: I would just shoot straight at the goalkeeper, most likely.\n6:54 Comment: Into the goalkeeper's corner.\n6:55 Comment: But I hoped for luck.\n6:57 Comment: There's a little fight there.\n6:58 Comment: Milik is pushed against the wall.\n7:2 Comment: I think it’s still Incinia.\n7:7 Comment: He steps from foot to foot.\n7:8 Comment: Hit the wall.\n7:9 Comment: The ball hits.\n7:9 Comment: Failed to lift.\n7:12 Comment: And immediately into the selection.\n7:13 Comment: Everything is correct.\n7:14 Comment: If you lose the ball, you need to immediately put pressure to win the ball.\n7:16 Comment: And carry out your second attack with a second wave.\n7:20 Comment: Napoleon tries to play with one touch.\n7:22 Comment: Zhorzhin moves her to the right.\n7:23 Comment: Great.\n7:24 Comment: Calihon.\n7:25 Comment: Further away.\n7:25 Comment: Began.\n7:26 Comment: But again for some reason on Incinia.\n7:27 Comment: Where is Milik?\n7:28 Comment: Milik gets stuck all the time.\n7:29 Comment: He doesn’t go for these balls that are flying there to the far post.\n7:33 Comment: Well, Milik acts more proactively.\n7:35 Comment: Plays near post.\n7:36 Comment: But it turns out that Insinia covers the long one.\n7:38 Comment: But the passes are too inaccurate.\n7:40 Comment: And too much inaccurate.\n7:42 Comment: If we compare Milik and Higuain.\n7:44 Comment: In your opinion, is this the same type of striker?\n7:46 Comment: Or is Milik a slightly different form?\n7:50 Comment: I think it's of a different kind.\n7:51 Comment: And yet Higuain, you know, and even according to statistics\n7:55 Comment: he consistently scores a lot of goals in the 20s every year.\n7:59 Comment: Therefore, it is too early for Milik to compare him with Higuain.\n8:3 Comment: I think it's more versatile.\n8:5 Comment: But let's just say Higuain is more versatile.\n8:10 Comment: But Milik is probably still more powerful.\n8:11 Comment: He can push through.\n8:12 Comment: Higuain can make a goal out of nothing.\n8:14 Comment: We saw it beautifully when he scored through himself.\n8:16 Comment: Milik is probably simpler.\n8:18 Comment: But still more powerful.\n8:19 Comment: Meter eighty six.\n8:21 Comment: The height of Arkady Shamilik.\n8:22 Comment: And speaking of goals.\n8:24 Comment: Yes, he hasn't had one yet.\n8:25 Comment: Some outstanding results.\n8:27 Comment: Even in Holland for Ajax in the last season he scored only 21.\n8:30 Comment: For Holland this is not much.\n8:32 Comment: But, nevertheless, he is steadily increasing his level.\n8:36 Comment: If you look at Bayer.\n8:38 Comment: He had no goals in the Bundesliga in his first season.\n8:40 Comment: Then in Augsburg there are two.\n8:42 Comment: At Ajax in the first season there were 11.\n8:43 Comment: In the second season there are already 21.\n8:46 Comment: Well, for the national team.\n8:47 Comment: He has already scored 11 goals for the Polish national team.\n8:50 Comment: Good striker.\n8:51 Comment: We really got to know him really well.\n8:53 Comment: At the European Championships.\n8:55 Comment: But.\n8:55 Comment: For many, this transition to a higher level is not easy.\n8:59 Comment: Pash, don’t forget that he played under Livandovsky in the national team.\n9:2 Comment: And here he needs to play number one.\n9:4 Comment: Take over the game.\n9:5 Comment: Essentially Livandovsky.\n9:7 Comment: At the expense of Livandovsky, he had moments.\n9:9 Comment: Now he also needs to create for someone or create for himself.\n9:12 Comment: And it's always more difficult.\n9:14 Comment: But Melik started very well.\n9:15 Comment: Two goals in the first two rounds.\n9:17 Comment: And he, along with Dries Mertens, is now the team's top scorer.\n9:21 Comment: Two turns of whom?\n9:23 Comment: Milan turnover.\n9:25 Comment: And Dris Melik?\n9:25 Comment: Melik Mertens, by the way, remained in reserve today.\n9:27 Comment: Despite the fact that if he comes out, most likely he will appear as a replacement.\n9:31 Comment: This will be his 100th appearance for Naples in the Italian Serie A.\n9:35 Comment: It's Reina who's calm.\n9:38 Comment: Crazy goalkeeper line, by the way, in Naples.\n9:40 Comment: Besides Reina, there is also a very talented Brazilian goalkeeper, Rafael Cabral.\n9:45 Comment: And Ludzhi Seppe, who is also considered one of the best in Italy.\n9:49 Comment: Melik drops deep to receive the ball.\n9:51 Comment: It seems to me that he still needs to act more.\n9:55 Comment: To someone else's penalty area.\n9:57 Comment: And then Hamshik will figure it out himself in the center of the field.\n9:59 Comment: And Georgini too.\n10:1 Comment: And Peter Zelinsky, let’s not forget him.\n10:4 Comment: Napoleon now has such a very attacking midfield.\n10:8 Comment: By the way, Alan is not here today, who usually plays such a pure defensive player.\n10:12 Comment: But there are three players capable of supporting the attack.\n10:15 Comment: Now, Melik almost got to the ball.\n10:17 Comment: But still, we still need to somehow improve the pitches.\n10:19 Comment: Because the striker’s ball always goes over.\n10:22 Comment: And mostly they serve it to the far post.\n10:24 Comment: Inexplicably.\n10:25 Comment: Is it even necessary to play with these Napoleon high balls?\n10:28 Comment: In fact, they are all combinational.\n10:30 Comment: And they may well enter the penalty area with a small pass.\n10:34 Comment: Absolutely exactly what they have proven more than once.\n10:36 Comment: Margeau threw out.\n10:38 Comment: Again not very accurate.\n10:40 Comment: Polarma is playing quite calmly so far.\n10:43 Comment: In general, I don’t know how, in principle, you can be calm while in a club that, as they say, is run by Zumparine.\n10:49 Comment: But even the coaches who come to Polyarma say, so what?\n10:52 Comment: I try not to pay attention to this president.\n10:55 Comment: It seems to me that everything will be fine.\n10:57 Comment: That's what everyone says.\n10:58 Comment: Last season Polarma changed his coach 8 times.\n11:3 Comment: Imagine, 2 coaches came to the club twice during the season.\n11:8 Comment: That is, there is complete disgrace going on there.\n11:11 Comment: Pash, well, probably only these two people remembered their names.\n11:13 Comment: The rest didn’t even have time to remember Boris’s name.\n11:16 Comment: They were fired immediately, right?\n11:17 Comment: One trainer worked for 6 days.\n11:19 Comment: Wow, this is great.\n11:21 Comment: Did you get your salary, what do you think?\n11:23 Comment: I could have made it, I could have made it.\n11:25 Comment: What in particular is in the contract of Roberto Dedzerbi, who now runs the club,\n11:31 Comment: very serious fines are prescribed if his club suddenly dismisses him.\n11:36 Comment: Let's talk about this coach.\n11:38 Comment: I promised to tell about him.\n11:39 Comment: By the way, he played for Napoleon for quite a long time.\n11:43 Comment: And he played in this team quite recently, in 2010.\n11:47 Comment: He is only 37 years old.\n11:48 Comment: And he has a good career.\n11:50 Comment: Great!\n11:51 Comment: Good point, good point.\n11:53 Comment: Finally a minor pass.\n11:54 Comment: And here you go.\n11:55 Comment: Now, if they show us a replay, we will see how Milik played a great heel on Hamsik.\n11:59 Comment: Gamshika sent Lensinin to the flank.\n12:1 Comment: Yes, that's a good point.\n12:2 Comment: To the flank and immediately, pay attention, Milik returned it and immediately into the penalty area.\n12:6 Comment: Stay ahead of the curve.\n12:6 Comment: And here it is, a dangerous moment from the left foot.\n12:8 Comment: Here, he just points with his heel and immediately into the penalty area.\n12:11 Comment: This is a real Napoleon game.\n12:14 Comment: This is a much more familiar Muritso Sarri team than what we saw in the first 10 minutes.\n12:19 Comment: So, Roberto Dedzerbi ended his playing career in 2013.\n12:25 Comment: The team was headed by Darfo Buario.\n12:28 Comment: Then he moved to Foggio.\n12:30 Comment: With Foggio he showed himself very well in the Che Uno series.\n12:32 Comment: And please go to a very high level in Serie A in Palermo.\n12:36 Comment: By the way, before this he had already refused Crutone.\n12:39 Comment: Also a team that now plays in the Italian top division.\n12:44 Comment: Now let’s see how Palermo applies pressure.\n12:47 Comment: And will he run away or not?\n12:48 Comment: Oscar Healy Mark corrected his own mistake in Kulebali.\n12:51 Comment: His pass was not accurate, but this defender is good in power play.\n12:55 Comment: Just chic and calm.\n13:0 Comment: Well, Palermo, of course, will not put pressure.\n13:2 Comment: Better to roll back.\n13:6 Comment: Georgini is a good finishing pass.\n13:8 Comment: But there Palermo meets its opponent clearly without breaking the rules.\n13:15 Comment: Lets Davide Massa fight. Thanks to him for this.\n13:18 Comment: Today we saw how Mark Clatenburg worked in the Manchester derby.\n13:21 Comment: There, in principle, to earn a foul, you had to practically tear off your opponent.\n13:25 Comment: And here he threw his opponent's leg.\n13:30 Comment: Kulebali and Albiol.\n13:32 Comment: Both defenders with good first passes.\n13:34 Comment: As a result, Albiol launches an attack.\n13:36 Comment: But here they did not understand each other, Milliko Nsi.\n13:38 Comment: Palermo plays very compactly.\n13:40 Comment: It seems to me that between the lines, between the line of defense and attack, there are literally 35-40 meters.\n13:45 Comment: No more for sure.\n13:47 Comment: Therefore, Napoli faces certain problems.\n13:50 Comment: And Diamanti is all in the fight.\n13:52 Comment: She takes it very well.\n13:54 Comment: On the right flank is Andrea Rispoli.\n13:58 Comment: Of course, he doesn’t let him go anywhere.\n13:59 Comment: Diamanti is already here.\n14:3 Comment: Expands Palermo's attack.\n14:7 Comment: But, unfortunately, they don’t yet know what to do with the ball in the opponent’s half of the field.\n14:11 Comment: Therefore, we returned to the usual, our own.\n14:14 Comment: In my opinion, this is the case when a team is better off when the opponent attacks.\n14:18 Comment: Because you can intercept the ball and launch a quick counterattack into the depleted zones.\n14:22 Comment: Palermo is clearly in trouble positionally.\n14:24 Comment: But Napoli still does not reveal its entire squad.\n14:27 Comment: Because he understands that Palermo has really fast football players.\n14:30 Comment: Insigne dribbling again in the penalty area.\n14:32 Comment: Lumbago. Milik needs to be scored.\n14:34 Comment: And Slobodan Rajkovic played great until the end.\n14:37 Comment: Good point. Firstly, Insigny.\n14:40 Comment: Great dribbling.\n14:41 Comment: Secondly, for the second time, pay attention, defender Milik runs behind him.\n14:45 Comment: Look, it's waiting, waiting, waiting.\n14:46 Comment: And now it will pop up.\n14:47 Comment: Look, and it jumps out at the neighbor. Understand?\n14:49 Comment: He plays great as a forward.\n14:52 Comment: First he hides behind his back, and then runs out ahead of him.\n14:55 Comment: This is excellent quality.\n14:56 Comment: All that remains is to knock down goals.\n14:57 Comment: Well, let's praise Slobodan Rajkovic once again.\n14:59 Comment: A very famous defender who for a long time belonged to London's Chelsea.\n15:3 Comment: I just couldn’t play in any of the clubs where I went on loan.\n15:7 Comment: I played in PSV, I played in Hamburg.\n15:9 Comment: Well, I have now come from Darmstadt to Palermo.\n15:11 Comment: Serve to the near post.\n15:13 Comment: You can score from here.\n15:14 Comment: How did it happen?\n15:15 Comment: How so?\n15:16 Comment: Raul Albiol misses.\n15:18 Comment: Good point, indeed.\n15:19 Comment: And it could have actually been 2-0.\n15:22 Comment: There are moments, it’s good.\n15:23 Comment: It's interesting to watch, but you still need to score.\n15:25 Comment: Yes, but here it’s easy to hit the near corner, which no one had time to block.\n15:30 Comment: Everyone flew by.\n15:31 Comment: By the way, this was not a transfer.\n15:33 Comment: The Palermo defender touched the ball with his head and it turned out that he played against his team.\n15:43 Comment: Yes, Napoli, of course, will have enough chances today.\n15:45 Comment: Implementation.\n15:46 Comment: Actually, with Higuain the implementation was not always ideal.\n15:49 Comment: We remember that Gonzalo could have missed 3 chances and then only scored.\n15:59 Comment: Moritzo Sari.\n16:1 Comment: For him, by the way, the transition to a higher level was not the most difficult.\n16:6 Comment: It seemed to everyone that it was one thing to work in Empol, to coach a team that does not aspire to high places,\n16:13 Comment: It’s quite another thing to fight for the Scudette.\n16:15 Comment: But no.\n16:16 Comment: In Naples, he also built everything according to his own laws.\n16:18 Comment: And he also works as best he can.\n16:21 Comment: Like a professor.\n16:22 Comment: Yes, I already told you that that season I commentated on several Napoli matches.\n16:27 Comment: And in fact, the team seemed to me to be practically the best performing in Serie A.\n16:30 Comment: Well, maybe the same as Juventus.\n16:32 Comment: Because they played very nicely.\n16:34 Comment: We played attacking combination football.\n16:36 Comment: There are many small transfers and many sharpening and creative decisions ahead.\n16:41 Comment: This is exactly the football of Moritzo Sari.\n16:44 Comment: But, probably, there wasn’t enough meat from strangers.\n16:46 Comment: Napoli in order to fight Juventus to the end.\n16:49 Comment: But still, Incini is not offside to win the Scudette.\n16:52 Comment: He's on the flank here all the time.\n16:54 Comment: The two of them meet him all the time.\n16:56 Comment: Because they understand perfectly well that Incini is very dangerous when dribbling.\n16:59 Comment: Diamonds. Good pass.\n17:2 Comment: Run to the end of the flight field.\n17:4 Comment: Well, Kulebali, how are you running?\n17:6 Comment: He just calmly puts the body down and that’s it.\n17:8 Comment: And you're already out of the game.\n17:10 Comment: Look, they played the ball quickly.\n17:11 Comment: And they almost brought themselves a moment right away.\n17:13 Comment: And so, like, I don’t know.\n17:14 Comment: But that's probably not true.\n17:15 Comment: Just a moment.\n17:16 Comment: They want to play fast.\n17:18 Comment: They want to get the ball into the opponent's half of the field as quickly as possible.\n17:20 Comment: Marek Hamsik.\n17:22 Comment: Gamshik will pull closer to Insini.\n17:24 Comment: They are two people who are two side by side.\n17:26 Comment: Must be nearby all the time.\n17:27 Comment: But they will definitely come up with something.\n17:29 Comment: Jorginho.\n17:30 Comment: This time it didn't work out.\n17:32 Comment: Question to the right.\n17:36 Comment: Pelejon is still a little out of the picture due to Napoli's performance.\n17:39 Comment: Everything rolls towards the left edge.\n17:43 Comment: Most likely there was a transfer.\n17:44 Comment: But it was a blow.\n17:45 Comment: And that was not the case.\n17:48 Comment: Has the coach undressed yet?\n17:49 Comment: He took off his jacket.\n17:50 Comment: Everything is hot.\n17:51 Comment: Yes, everything is hot.\n17:52 Comment: Naturally.\n17:53 Comment: Because you don’t just have to train.\n17:56 Comment: And also figure out how Roberto Deserbi would coach in your place.\n18:0 Comment: Of course, they probably discussed everything with the assistant.\n18:6 Comment: But the head coach is still on the podium.\n18:11 Comment: I wonder what they will do now.\n18:12 Comment: Do something.\n18:13 Comment: And it will be very interesting.\n18:14 Comment: I wonder if during a break, when you're lifted,\n18:17 Comment: go down to the locker room.\n18:18 Comment: Or they won't let you in either.\n18:19 Comment: This is an interesting question.\n18:21 Comment: I think it's possible.\n18:23 Comment: Well, or, as a last resort, talk on a mobile phone.\n18:26 Comment: And use all the innovations of technological progress.\n18:32 Comment: Good translation by Kelehon.\n18:33 Comment: Discount!\n18:34 Comment: Doesn't fall.\n18:35 Comment: And he does the right thing in not falling in this episode.\n18:38 Comment: But Palermo may have a counterattack.\n18:41 Comment: Diamanti.\n18:42 Comment: Everything is through him.\n18:43 Comment: Certainly.\n18:44 Comment: He is a key player for Palermo.\n18:46 Comment: All attacks start through it.\n18:48 Comment: An interesting football player.\n18:49 Comment: Interestingly, Alexander Diamanti scored his first goal in the Italian Serie A back in 2008 against Naples.\n18:55 Comment: He then played for Livorno.\n19:1 Comment: Rispolin.\n19:4 Comment: I tried to find Diamanti again.\n19:6 Comment: And the second time.\n19:7 Comment: But both times they blocked the captain of Palermo.\n19:10 Comment: Blue is so quick with the ball.\n19:13 Comment: Very technical.\n19:14 Comment: Naples begins another positional attack.\n19:20 Comment: Meanwhile, 20 minutes are already ticking by.\n19:23 Comment: 0-0.\n19:24 Comment: Milik goes very deep again.\n19:26 Comment: It’s clear that you want to receive balls.\n19:28 Comment: But nevertheless, he is still dangerous when he is near the opponent’s penalty area.\n19:34 Comment: The defenders of Palermo are telling each other quite aggressively.\n19:41 Comment: One big loss today.\n19:43 Comment: Palermo has both injured and suspended Michel Murganello.\n19:48 Comment: Who most often plays on the right flank in defense.\n19:51 Comment: As for Naples, Emmanelli Jackie Vinni is still injured.\n19:55 Comment: And Lorenzo Tonelli.\n19:57 Comment: Insigne.\n19:58 Comment: Turning kick to the bottom corner.\n20:0 Comment: Josip Osowicz takes the shot in front of him.\n20:2 Comment: But no one went to finish off.\n20:4 Comment: I think Insigne hastened. It was possible to come up with something.\n20:7 Comment: Now we will look at this moment.\n20:9 Comment: It's coming.\n20:10 Comment: There was Gamshik nearby, and Milik nearby.\n20:12 Comment: It was possible to depict something.\n20:14 Comment: Favorite walls.\n20:16 Comment: Pass to third.\n20:17 Comment: It could have been played more sophisticatedly.\n20:19 Comment: Well, by the way, Insigne has a good shot.\n20:21 Comment: He scored with such long-range shots more than once.\n20:23 Comment: For some reason, Insignia is still a little lacking in self-confidence this season.\n20:29 Comment: Psychology.\n20:30 Comment: Because not everything works out both in the national team and in the club, probably not as we would like.\n20:33 Comment: Therefore, this has an effect in any case.\n20:35 Comment: Milik.\n20:36 Comment: It's poor handling rather than poor transmission.\n20:38 Comment: Psychology.\n20:40 Comment: Back pass.\n20:41 Comment: According to advice.\n20:42 Comment: Milik will continue to press until the end.\n20:44 Comment: But the Croatian young goalkeeper calmly clears it.\n20:46 Comment: True, there is absolutely no one there to knock out.\n20:48 Comment: Even Diamantiy plays in his own half of the field.\n20:54 Comment: At the same time, Polermo’s scheme was designated to us as 4-3-3.\n20:57 Comment: But this is very conditional.\n20:59 Comment: It's actually more of a 4-6-0.\n21:5 Comment: Well, indeed, we see Diamantiy very often even in our own penalty area,\n21:8 Comment: when he, remember, made a mistake, for example.\n21:10 Comment: On Georgini.\n21:11 Comment: This was the position of a defensive midfielder.\n21:14 Comment: But, on the other hand, Polermo really understands that playing open football with Napoli is impossible.\n21:19 Comment: They will sit deeper and then look for chances to counterattack.\n21:23 Comment: This is, in principle, logical.\n21:24 Comment: That's how it should be.\n21:25 Comment: Because if you start playing open football, then you really get 6-0.\n21:28 Comment: Only not in terms of the defensive line, the first line, but in terms of the score on the scoreboard.\n21:35 Comment: Pass to the right. Great.\n21:36 Comment: Well, here's Califon.\n21:37 Comment: His first chance.\n21:38 Comment: Milik is trying to get ahead again.\n21:40 Comment: Califon plays too smart, perhaps.\n21:42 Comment: I outsmarted myself.\n21:45 Comment: There, Incini clearly did not have time for this transfer.\n21:47 Comment: That case when there were not enough players in the penalty area, because only Milik was running and no one else.\n21:51 Comment: The attack developed so quickly that its partners simply did not have time to support it.\n21:55 Comment: By the way, about Kaliphon.\n21:56 Comment: He also scored two against Milan.\n21:57 Comment: It turns out that three of their players have two goals each, right?\n22:3 Comment: Yes.\n22:4 Comment: We'll check this again now.\n22:6 Comment: Serie A's top scorer so far is Andrea Bellotti.\n22:8 Comment: A sensation for the season.\n22:10 Comment: Renault has already scored 4 goals.\n22:12 Comment: Higuain has 3 after today's double.\n22:14 Comment: Just like Frankie C because of the talent of Carlos Baca and Geg Perotti.\n22:18 Comment: Well, here's Napoleon.\n22:20 Comment: Mertens, Milik, Kalifon.\n22:23 Comment: Two balls each.\n22:26 Comment: Polermo, by the way, has a terrible calendar at the very beginning of the season.\n22:29 Comment: Sesuolo, Inter, Naples.\n22:31 Comment: In the first three rounds.\n22:32 Comment: So, the fact that Polermo has one point so far is not bad at all.\n22:35 Comment: Sesuolo lost 0-1 at home.\n22:36 Comment: We tied with Inter 1-1 away.\n22:38 Comment: On the road, yes.\n22:39 Comment: And after that...\n22:40 Comment: After this match, David Abble Ordy was fired.\n22:44 Comment: Yes, the president of the club makes an interesting decision.\n22:46 Comment: Such...\n22:47 Comment: Powder keg, yes.\n22:48 Comment: And coach, can you imagine what it’s like to work in such conditions,\n22:51 Comment: when you just understand that, I don’t know, today, tomorrow, at any moment you can be hired and fired.\n22:56 Comment: In the Russian Championship, it seems to me that the coaches in Kuban will be about the same.\n22:59 Comment: When you just need to always keep your suitcases packed in advance,\n23:3 Comment: so that you can leave at any time.\n23:5 Comment: More precisely, it is better not to disassemble them at all.\n23:6 Comment: Yes.\n23:7 Comment: So as not to make unnecessary movements that you may need on the bench.\n23:10 Comment: In terms of odiousness, President Napoleo Aurelio de Laurentiis is probably not much inferior to Zampari.\n23:16 Comment: But he nevertheless trusts his coaches.\n23:18 Comment: First Walter Matsari worked for him for a long time, then Rafa Benitos.\n23:23 Comment: Well, now Mauritso Sari.\n23:24 Comment: The choice is very thoughtful, very correct.\n23:27 Comment: And I also think that a fairly long career awaits him in Naples.\n23:30 Comment: Pash, you know, I can’t imagine any other way to give results.\n23:34 Comment: If it’s always a leapfrog, a coaching leapfrog, then it’s generally impossible to produce results in such conditions.\n23:39 Comment: Still...\n23:40 Comment: There must be stability, including definitely on the coaching bridge.\n23:44 Comment: Undoubtedly.\n23:47 Comment: It was offside.\n23:48 Comment: But Palermo has its own logic here.\n23:50 Comment: Diamantik slightly, maybe a couple of centimeters of his body, climbed into an offside position.\n23:56 Comment: Let's note Coulibaly, who saw everything and deliberately did not take a step towards his goal.\n24:0 Comment: And he raised his hand when he saw that Diamantik was offside.\n24:6 Comment: Ghoulam.\n24:10 Comment: Gamshik.\n24:12 Comment: Deep too.\n24:13 Comment: Napoleon feels confident.\n24:15 Comment: Lots of positional attacks, lots of movement.\n24:18 Comment: I know that there is a creative attack group that still converts its chances.\n24:23 Comment: I really like how Palermo will be covered so far.\n24:25 Comment: Because they clearly prepared for Naples absolutely correctly.\n24:28 Comment: And while there is enough strength, at least they are blocking all zones.\n24:33 Comment: Yes, the key word is “while you have enough strength.”\n24:35 Comment: I think that, again, if Naples scores the first goal now,\n24:39 Comment: I’ll see how Palermo will act, because it won’t be entirely profitable to play as number two and close down.\n24:44 Comment: Dangerous!\n24:45 Comment: And Melik has another chance, but again he doesn’t score with his first touch, and then the defender manages.\n24:51 Comment: Again he plays great, breaks away from the defender, but also again does not score his chance.\n24:56 Comment: This is, in fact, what we were talking about.\n24:57 Comment: Look, there’s a lead again, again the left foot is on time and misses the ball.\n25:1 Comment: There are many, many moments. I would even say too much.\n25:4 Comment: Because in the 25th minute he already had three chances, and at least one needs to be realized.\n25:8 Comment: This is how a forward feels in a situation where you have chances, but you don’t score all the time?\n25:12 Comment: Does this take a little off the game?\n25:14 Comment: Yes, of course, of course, it puts pressure psychologically, because from moment to moment you cannot do what you should do,\n25:20 Comment: and what you, in principle, manage to do periodically.\n25:22 Comment: Well, the very first thing is that you immediately begin to scold yourself.\n25:25 Comment: You say that how can it be, why are you so bad, you need to implement such and such moments.\n25:31 Comment: But, in fact, it was two meters to the gate.\n25:33 Comment: Yes, you just had to hit the ball.\n25:35 Comment: Hit the ball and that's it.\n25:36 Comment: I think that the goalkeeper simply would not have won.\n25:37 Comment: Yes Yes Yes.\n25:38 Comment: If there was no chance, he would not have time to react.\n25:40 Comment: We often see these psychological problems in forwards.\n25:43 Comment: Now, for example, we’ll see you at Kovan, which was also spectacular in Naples.\n25:46 Comment: Almost the same story from Paris Germain.\n25:48 Comment: He can't start scoring after Zlatan Braginovich left and Kovane became number one again.\n25:54 Comment: By the way, Covane could have returned to Naples, but they decided to spend the money for Higuain in a different way.\n26:1 Comment: And it’s interesting that so far the newcomers are very gradually joining the team.\n26:6 Comment: Today there are two of them - Zelinsky and Milik.\n26:8 Comment: Two Poles, by the way.\n26:10 Comment: The Rock is in reserve, Amadou Diawara is in reserve, and the injured Jocherini and Tunnels are in reserve, so to speak.\n26:18 Comment: Well, just in case.\n26:20 Comment: In general, in principle, I think that as the season progresses, the same Diawara and the same Jocherini can become players in the starting lineup.\n26:28 Comment: But Sari takes everything step by step.\n26:31 Comment: They spent 32 million euros for Milik, and it seems to me that it was not in vain, because he is a really good striker.\n26:36 Comment: And the main thing to consider is that 22 million.\n26:37 Comment: In fact, this is the age, you know, when it’s not even like dawn.\n26:42 Comment: There is still time before dawn, and I am sure that it will increase in Naples.\n26:46 Comment: Insignia to the far post, Milik misses.\n26:49 Comment: There wasn't enough growth here.\n26:51 Comment: But again, they all the time seem to feel this mutual understanding among themselves, a little bit lacking in precision.\n26:58 Comment: It all comes with time, comes with games.\n27:2 Comment: I'm sure this trio will spoil your nerves.\n27:5 Comment: Hanshik, Milik.\n27:6 Comment: And Incinia.\n27:8 Comment: And plus Colijon, and plus Mertens.\n27:11 Comment: Yes, Colijon, of course, yes, yes, yes, and Mertens, of course.\n27:13 Comment: Good composition.\n27:15 Comment: Such a playing gang.\n27:17 Comment: Last season, by the way, Napoli used the same starting line-up so often that in principle it was no longer possible to even guess who Murizo Sari would push out there.\n27:27 Comment: In reality, they had 11 people constantly.\n27:29 Comment: Plus the same three came on as substitutes.\n27:31 Comment: Now the situation is different.\n27:32 Comment: We see that there is rotation.\n27:34 Comment: And even Gadzetto.\n27:35 Comment: The Napoli lineup is not entirely accurate, because in this match, for example, they were waiting for Alcido Hysaj, the defender of the Albanian national team, who was replaced at the start by Christian Maggio.\n27:44 Comment: They were waiting for Alan, not waiting for Zelinsky.\n27:46 Comment: Well, the choice was Incinia or Dries Mertens.\n27:49 Comment: Mertens played very well against Milan, but Sari still decided that Incinia should be given a chance.\n27:54 Comment: Mertens, in my opinion, if I’m not mistaken, gave a couple of assists.\n27:59 Comment: But Incinia is more creative.\n28:0 Comment: You probably know how the coach probably thought that he would have to hide the defense after all.\n28:4 Comment: What kind of rival is he?\n28:6 Comment: He has a very good dribbling ability.\n28:8 Comment: And, perhaps, the calculation of what to hide, beat, score.\n28:15 Comment: Well, let’s not forget that Dries Mertens is always a very good substitute.\n28:19 Comment: He is used to this role.\n28:20 Comment: And even he, probably, in some ways considers himself really the same Joker.\n28:26 Comment: We know that in basketball there is a concept of the best sixth man.\n28:29 Comment: Dries Mertens is probably the best twelfth player in the entire series.\n28:33 Comment: Thank you.\n28:34 Comment: aghetti\n28:37 Comment: No, well, but probably.\n28:39 Comment: We play igual.\n28:40 Comment: Exactly.\n28:41 Comment: We're Eight by twenty passed.\n28:42 Comment: And eBay.\n28:43 Comment: AP Legal, it is included\n28:59 Comment: He became quite a working boy.\n29:3 Comment: gate, only then did I receive\n29:5 Comment: opportunity to play.\n29:8 Comment: I wonder what\n29:9 Comment: Polermo goalkeeper Josip Osovit\n29:11 Comment: He plays tricks on his neighbors all the time. The ball doesn't try\n29:13 Comment: carry far forward. Polermo also values ​​the ball.\n29:18 Comment: Valued primarily because\n29:20 Comment: they're not with him often\n29:21 Comment: meet. And again, better\n29:24 Comment: own it rather than take it away all the time.\n29:26 Comment: Tyamanti passed the ball very well to Embolo.\n29:29 Comment: A fall. No, nothing here\n29:31 Comment: did not have. But such a big guy like\n29:32 Comment: Carlos Embolo, it's not easy to take down.\n29:35 Comment: And I think David Mass is here\n29:37 Comment: so he will judge.\n29:41 Comment: We'll watch the replay later, of course.\n29:42 Comment: Carlos Embolo.\n29:45 Comment: Football player from Guinea Bessau.\n29:46 Comment: This is very rare for\n29:48 Comment: Italian TV series and in general for\n29:50 Comment: top championships.\n29:54 Comment: We spotted him in Polermo,\n29:55 Comment: when he was\n29:56 Comment: 18 years. Brought\n29:58 Comment: from Africa. And here he is\n30:0 Comment: finally made it to the main team.\n30:2 Comment: Maybe now Pauzina will show this moment\n30:5 Comment: about the penalty. Yes, that's it\n30:7 Comment: Insignio. Well, especially Incinio.\n30:9 Comment: No no no. Yes, he's already, look,\n30:11 Comment: took two steps and then began to fall.\n30:13 Comment: This is, of course, one. Incinio weighs, I think\n30:15 Comment: which is less than one and a half times\n30:17 Comment: approximately than Embolo.\n30:19 Comment: Well, by the way, on that second repeat\n30:20 Comment: it seemed like a push from the back. Just\n30:22 Comment: Embolo didn't realize it right away.\n30:25 Comment: His reaction speed prevented him from falling instantly.\n30:29 Comment: I thought and thought, took a couple of steps and fell.\n30:32 Comment: 14-14.\n30:32 Comment: Seconds. Minimum possible\n30:34 Comment: human reaction speed. That's why,\n30:36 Comment: for example, in athletics, when\n30:38 Comment: people start before this time,\n30:41 Comment: this is considered a false start. Pasha, by the way,\n30:42 Comment: standards are one of the main things\n30:44 Comment: guns of Palermo\n30:46 Comment: against\n30:48 Comment: Napoli. I think so. Because\n30:50 Comment: teams that rarely\n30:51 Comment: attack\n30:55 Comment: it’s precisely this that can win due to standards\n30:56 Comment: this match. Yes, but here we must admit\n30:58 Comment: that Napoli have many players who\n31:0 Comment: They play great with their heads. And two central ones\n31:2 Comment: shield protector first of all.\n31:5 Comment: But for now that's it\n31:6 Comment: The Neapolitans coped with this serve.\n31:9 Comment: Ilya Mark. Palermo yesterday in half the field\n31:10 Comment: entrenched. There is a chance\n31:12 Comment: carry out another attack. Understands\n31:15 Comment: Mato Yailo is here. Strike one. On target\n31:16 Comment: gate Peppe Reinan, by the way, got the job.\n31:19 Comment: Well, that's the kind of work, you know.\n31:21 Comment: Light hack.\n31:23 Comment: 'Cause it's hard to beat\n31:24 Comment: you can't name it. Peppe Reinan\n31:26 Comment: I controlled everything.\n31:30 Comment: And how will Napoli respond?\n31:32 Comment: The mass shows that we can continue.\n31:35 Comment: Lam.\n31:36 Comment: So far, by the way, the full-backs are not very active\n31:38 Comment: Napoli are moving forward. Although it seems like both\n31:40 Comment: they are attackers. Either Maggio or Bulyam.\n31:43 Comment: But there's plenty of activity there\n31:44 Comment: on the flanks and without them.\n31:46 Comment: You can't let Insina turn around like this\n31:48 Comment: in the center of the field, because he is immediately\n31:49 Comment: gives such dangerous passes.\n31:52 Comment: Joseph Porsovets played very competently now.\n31:54 Comment: Didn't touch\n31:55 Comment: this ball and missed it. Look how quickly he turned around.\n31:58 Comment: I turned around, immediately saw it and gave it away\n32:0 Comment: great transfer. A little bit not exactly.\n32:2 Comment: Literally, I probably didn’t hit one like that.\n32:7 Comment: So far the rivals are worthy of each other.\n32:10 Comment: In this, by the way, in general\n32:11 Comment: salt series A. No one ever\n32:14 Comment: doesn't give up right away. Here\n32:16 Comment: There are no such failures.\n32:18 Comment: It seems that Polermo 16th place in the past\n32:20 Comment: season, Napoli 2. It would seem\n32:22 Comment: completely different level. But\n32:23 Comment: we see that Polermo is trying to use his trump cards.\n32:32 Comment: Positional attacks for the second time already.\n32:38 Comment: Yes, it’s true, of course, they don’t quite know what to do, but now it could be dangerous.\n32:41 Comment: Roland Szalley, the Hungarian striker, tries to shoot with a turn.\n32:45 Comment: But here he fouls against Christian Maggio.\n32:48 Comment: Maggio set himself up very competently.\n32:50 Comment: Also a newcomer, Salleya is from a team called the Ferenc Puskas Academy.\n32:58 Comment: Moved to Italy. By the way, I already managed to borrow it.\n33:0 Comment: Already found it.\n33:1 Comment: Returned.\n33:2 Comment: He will make his debut for the Hungarian national team in a friendly match before the Euro.\n33:6 Comment: Didn't make it to the European Championship.\n33:13 Comment: Kulebolin.\n33:14 Comment: And all the time he gives Albiol the right to start an attack.\n33:17 Comment: Polermo plays very compactly. Very compact.\n33:20 Comment: The whole team moves in the direction where the ball is and...\n33:26 Comment: Maggio. Submission to Meliko.\n33:29 Comment: But Eduardo Goldoniga is holding him all the time.\n33:32 Comment: Another newbie.\n33:34 Comment: Polermo. Maybe such a protector.\n33:37 Comment: He holds up well, but nevertheless Meliko does everything right all the time.\n33:40 Comment: But in terms of it, it is precisely in terms of movement.\n33:43 Comment: He runs behind his back, opens up completely, well, let’s say, ahead of the curve.\n33:46 Comment: And, in principle, this all passes, but...\n33:48 Comment: Well, he doesn’t have time to hit the turn. Either you can’t hit it, or the defender still covers you.\n33:54 Comment: Goldoniga is 7 centimeters taller than Meliko. An important advantage.\n33:59 Comment: No violation here. You can get there.\n34:0 Comment: No violation here. We can continue.\n34:2 Comment: Manages to get to his feet.\n34:5 Comment: Who was that? It was Zelinsky.\n34:8 Comment: He also appears there closer to the right flank from time to time.\n34:12 Comment: But Polermo also wins such goals due to his dedication.\n34:15 Comment: And Polermo’s players are trying to squeeze them out right away.\n34:19 Comment: The stadium deserves a round of applause. Absolutely correct. Polermo spends 34 almost exemplary minutes.\n34:24 Comment: We see that the scoring chances are 3-0 in favor of Naples.\n34:28 Comment: And, of course, the Napolitans attack much more often.\n34:30 Comment: But Polermo even does everything he can to prevent Meliko from scoring.\n34:35 Comment: Actually, either Raikovich or Goldoniga is hanging on his feet all the time.\n34:41 Comment: Great. This pass between the lines is very dangerous. And Meliko, strike!\n34:46 Comment: But here Iglain would probably be better. Because these are just his moments.\n34:52 Comment: Perhaps it could have been played more cunningly. Try to clean it up for yourself. Not so obvious.\n34:58 Comment: Shoot with your left foot.\n34:59 Comment: They will always be compared. At least during this season for sure.\n35:4 Comment: Because, naturally, Gonzalo Iglain was an incredibly important player for Naples.\n35:10 Comment: Serie A top scorer last season. The first person since the 50s to score more than 30 goals.\n35:22 Comment: Scored 36.\n35:23 Comment: 36 balls. Serie A is a cosmic result. This simply doesn't happen.\n35:29 Comment: And here Insinya and Hamshik are already interfering with each other a little. I saw it great.\n35:36 Comment: Calihon!\n35:37 Comment: Oh no no no!\n35:38 Comment: Kalihon is really not at ease yet. He just can't make the right decision.\n35:46 Comment: Gamshik is next to Insigne all the time. They interact well. Now we are watching how Gamshik gives.\n35:52 Comment: Yes, they even interfered with each other. We managed to readjust. And yet they brought this attack to a good point, it seems.\n35:58 Comment: Transfers to the right, but for some reason Kalihon decided to break through.\n36:0 Comment: Calihon falls out of this trio. Hamshik, Insinyu and Milik.\n36:6 Comment: In principle, if we predict Dries Mertons entering the field, then for now he should probably change Calijon.\n36:11 Comment: But hardly immediately after the break. Most likely, Muritso Sari will give Jose Calijon some more time.\n36:18 Comment: He is also a very strong football player. It's just not stable.\n36:23 Comment: Milik holds.\n36:27 Comment: Milik pulls the defender all the time, opening up and out into the country, and, of course, behind his back.\n36:32 Comment: Zelinsky.\n36:33 Comment: You can move to the left. Gulamp is completely free there.\n36:39 Comment: Insignia began to be greeted at the moment of receiving the ball.\n36:41 Comment: It's not easy for him either.\n36:45 Comment: As they say in football, they started to bite him a little. Now Milik has lost his mind and what will he come up with?\n36:51 Comment: Calihon.\n36:52 Comment: Zelinsky.\n36:53 Comment: Again there are five people from the polar.\n36:55 Comment: It is not clear how to get through this stockade, through this windfall of legs.\n37:0 Comment: Just like that. We roll the ball from flank to flank and look for a free zone for aggravation.\n37:7 Comment: Well, will there be a counterattack or not?\n37:9 Comment: No, after all, there is no risk of polarity here.\n37:12 Comment: Great.\n37:13 Comment: Mbalo.\n37:14 Comment: Mbalo. No, the starting speed is not enough to catch this ball.\n37:17 Comment: Coulibaly pulled himself out and did everything right. Immediately an interception and a new attack on the field.\n37:22 Comment: Insignia.\n37:23 Comment: There is Gamshik on the left.\n37:25 Comment: Not around all the time. Constantly.\n37:30 Comment: As a defender he played bravely now.\n37:33 Comment: And Diamanti. Great welcome.\n37:38 Comment: Mbalo has nowhere to run.\n37:40 Comment: But not to himself. Will he really go through the whole field alone?\n37:44 Comment: Perfect tackle from Luzi Gulyam.\n37:50 Comment: Yes, of course, a polar person shouldn’t snuggle up like that.\n37:53 Comment: Because there is simply no opportunity for attackers.\n37:57 Comment: Certainly. Firstly, it is difficult to defend. Secondly, Napoli has a creative attack group.\n38:2 Comment: Which, in fact, if they spend so long on the attack, then of course they will find an opportunity to finish it naked.\n38:9 Comment: It's too hard for the defenders.\n38:11 Comment: Naturally, there isn’t much that’s polarizing so far, this is the first half.\n38:14 Comment: But it will certainly have an impact in the end.\n38:18 Comment: Gamshik.\n38:20 Comment: This is his second inaccurate pass in a row.\n38:23 Comment: Yes, if we count inaccurate passes, then these players are of a really high level.\n38:28 Comment: Because when a person is of a bad level, we simply don’t count them.\n38:32 Comment: We'd lose count.\n38:34 Comment: This is Marik Hamshik.\n38:35 Comment: Legend of Napoli.\n38:36 Comment: We often use this word today, but in relation to him it is indeed absolutely true.\n38:41 Comment: He ranks third in terms of appearances.\n38:45 Comment: Only players who played in the 70s play for the club.\n38:50 Comment: Giuseppe Bruscalo and Antonio Jones.\n38:53 Comment: And he is fifth in goals.\n38:55 Comment: Maradona, Attila Salustro, Edinson Covani and Antonio Wojack.\n39:1 Comment: They scored more.\n39:2 Comment: By the way, it’s quite a bit to Maradona.\n39:4 Comment: Hamshik has only 17 goals left.\n39:6 Comment: Incini wanted to check.\n39:9 Comment: That's right, you need to hit.\n39:10 Comment: Especially if there is an opportunity.\n39:12 Comment: If the ball is received between the lines.\n39:13 Comment: If there is space and time.\n39:14 Comment: Of course, you need to try and beat.\n39:16 Comment: By the way, today Alexander Sologin showed us, yes, how to hit.\n39:20 Comment: Don't be afraid to hit.\n39:21 Comment: 40 meters.\n39:22 Comment: I played a very nice ball.\n39:25 Comment: The winning ball.\n39:26 Comment: Amkara vs Tomskaya Tomsk.\n39:30 Comment: Well, Palermo from Palermo plays a goal kick.\n39:34 Comment: Immediately high pressure.\n39:35 Comment: Napoleon is doing everything right.\n39:37 Comment: We need to meet.\n39:38 Comment: You need to force him to make mistakes like this and try to carry out a quick attack.\n39:41 Comment: And Milik.\n39:43 Comment: Hamshik saw Milik.\n39:44 Comment: Hamshik made a very correct pass this time.\n39:46 Comment: But Slobodan Rajkovic closes the zone again.\n39:49 Comment: This defender was much criticized in the German Bundesliga.\n39:51 Comment: But Slobodan Rajkovic is still a talent, of course.\n39:54 Comment: Here, in my opinion, for now he simply feels like the master of the situation.\n39:59 Comment: It’s hard, it’s hard for Milik.\n40:1 Comment: But on the other hand, Milik pulls them all the time.\n40:4 Comment: Bounces deeper.\n40:6 Comment: Then behind the back.\n40:7 Comment: It flies at all shots.\n40:8 Comment: It is, of course, very difficult to play with such a striker.\n40:12 Comment: Powerful on the stern, now taking a corner can be dangerous.\n40:15 Comment: Oh!\n40:16 Comment: Gamshik cut there with his maraquez, into the near corner, but missed.\n40:21 Comment: By the way, there is not very much resin.\n40:23 Comment: But he tries all the time until dangerous moments.\n40:26 Comment: Get things done on the field with their help.\n40:29 Comment: Notice how Hamshik’s hairstyle stands still.\n40:33 Comment: I wonder what he uses to style his hair?\n40:36 Comment: It’s a stupid question, because, of course, Evgeniy Savin\n40:40 Comment: likes to have a high enough hairstyle on air.\n40:46 Comment: By the way, there is not very much resin.\n40:48 Comment: But he tries all the time until dangerous moments.\n40:49 Comment: Diamantius is always in dispute with David Massa.\n40:54 Comment: The captain's armband will not help him at all if the referee decides to show a yellow card.\n41:0 Comment: But for now, Massa understands perfectly well that Diamantius is simply getting accustomed to a new role.\n41:5 Comment: He feels very much like a leader.\n41:7 Comment: He is the leader, because all attacks actually go through him.\n41:10 Comment: Now for a moment I caught myself thinking that if it weren’t for Diamantium,\n41:13 Comment: then at the expense of whom would they go on the attack?\n41:15 Comment: He helps in defense and runs out.\n41:18 Comment: And runs out into a quick counterattack.\n41:20 Comment: Such a link between the defense and attack of his team.\n41:24 Comment: Breaking the rules.\n41:25 Comment: From behind, three times, in my opinion, Balo stepped on Gulyam.\n41:34 Comment: Apparently it was raining.\n41:35 Comment: You can see from the lawn that the lawn is very soft.\n41:42 Comment: What will the Neapolitans come up with this time?\n41:44 Comment: Immediately serving or is it still a draw?\n41:46 Comment: We don’t really need to give money for a crisis.\n41:48 Comment: Because there is only one Milik.\n41:49 Comment: Even the defenders did not meet this standard.\n41:51 Comment: Well, for now, at least.\n41:52 Comment: Strange.\n41:53 Comment: Neither Koulibaly nor Albiol, really.\n41:54 Comment: Maybe they save their energy towards the end of the half.\n41:57 Comment: Maybe just know that there will be a draw?\n42:0 Comment: We ourselves asked Naples to play more with small passes downstairs.\n42:6 Comment: The only thing is that, of course, you need to increase the speed of these transmissions.\n42:12 Comment: Then Palermo will be very difficult.\n42:14 Comment: Milik turned and shot.\n42:16 Comment: Of course, he wants to prove himself.\n42:18 Comment: But so far the first half is his asset.\n42:20 Comment: Akadiy Shumilik still didn’t depend on him.\n42:22 Comment: He probably even landed 5-6 blows.\n42:24 Comment: And not a single one clogged with anything.\n42:26 Comment: There are many desires, many moments.\n42:28 Comment: But you know, basically, he does everything right.\n42:30 Comment: Because for the striker, after all, even though it doesn’t work out, he still needs to score.\n42:34 Comment: If he scores a goal, then perhaps he will be in trouble.\n42:36 Comment: But this desire to score still gets in the way.\n42:38 Comment: Yes, definitely.\n42:40 Comment: It is confusing and may not be appropriate.\n42:42 Comment: But of course this is not suitable.\n42:44 Comment: It confuses you and you begin to see nothing around you.\n42:46 Comment: Only the gate.\n42:48 Comment: And they float before your eyes, for sure.\n42:50 Comment: Muritso Sari must now find the right words for Milik during the break.\n42:52 Comment: I think he should just come up and say, just play your football.\n42:54 Comment: Forget it, don't concentrate on goals.\n42:56 Comment: Just play.\n42:58 Comment: You can do everything.\n43:0 Comment: Everything works out for you.\n43:2 Comment: And everything is fine.\n43:4 Comment: Because, really, he is fixated on the goal.\n43:6 Comment: I see.\n43:8 Comment: Hit from all positions.\n43:10 Comment: Turns around.\n43:12 Comment: Flies to all shots.\n43:14 Comment: Maybe you need to let go of the situation somewhere, breathe out.\n43:16 Comment: And then, maybe, the goal will come on its own.\n43:18 Comment: Surely the attacker must be selfish.\n43:20 Comment: Certainly.\n43:22 Comment: It matters to what extent.\n43:24 Comment: Hamshik free kick.\n43:26 Comment: Gamshik twists everyone.\n43:28 Comment: We still have to give it back, because there were too many rivals there.\n43:30 Comment: Jorginho.\n43:32 Comment: Calihon.\n43:34 Comment: Now, in my opinion, the turning blow is inaccurate.\n43:36 Comment: The entire Palermo team was now in their own penalty area.\n43:38 Comment: They go very deep when defending.\n43:40 Comment: But so far it's working.\n43:42 Comment: Peter Zelinsky concludes.\n43:44 Comment: Napoleon completed the attack.\n43:46 Comment: Everything was played out correctly.\n43:48 Comment: And this time Asek Kalikhon very accurately passed into the zone.\n43:50 Comment: Well, for some reason they can’t hit the target in Balestinapol from such positions.\n43:56 Comment: Passion shows us to the podium.\n43:58 Comment: Even though there are not many fans, the acoustics at the Renzo Barbero stadium are still quite good.\n44:6 Comment: An old stadium, like many in Italy.\n44:8 Comment: This is a very big problem for Serie A.\n44:10 Comment: Of course, there are not enough new arenas.\n44:12 Comment: Lack of financial strength.\n44:14 Comment: But, of course, in Lebanon.\n44:16 Comment: Even Napoleo. This is a rich team.\n44:18 Comment: But the stadium is still very, very old.\n44:20 Comment: 58 to 42 showed us the percentage of possession.\n44:22 Comment: Not such a big advantage for Napoleo.\n44:24 Comment: Like you said, about 50/50.\n44:26 Comment: But still, Polermo needs to pay attention to the fact that everyone constantly receives balls between the lines.\n44:32 Comment: And Sinyu and Gamshik.\n44:34 Comment: If this happens in the second half, there will definitely be problems.\n44:38 Comment: The first half was almost exemplary. Polermo worked to the end.\n44:42 Comment: The last seconds are already ticking by.\n44:44 Comment: There is unlikely to be much stoppage time from David Masse.\n44:46 Comment: Because we played without pauses at all.\n44:48 Comment: And 0-0 in such a game.\n44:50 Comment: A very good score for the hosts.\n44:52 Comment: Innings.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Two of us play the ball in the center of the field, although now we can do it one at a time.\n0:3 Comment:  Remained.\n0:4 Comment: They immediately go on the attack.\n0:5 Comment: Let's remember that Napoli had the advantage in the first half,\n0:9 Comment: although in terms of ball possession, in principle, there was practically equality.\n0:12 Comment: Nonetheless, Napoli dominated the field.\n0:14 Comment: There were a lot of positional attacks, we tried to be creative in front.\n0:19 Comment: Not everything worked out, but, nevertheless, Milik had three chances,\n0:21 Comment: Which he could realize at least one of.\n0:24 Comment: Yes, Arkadyosh Milik is the main culprit for the fact that the account has not yet been opened.\n0:29 Comment: Along with him, of course, are the defenders.\n0:31 Comment: Polermo, Slobodan Rajkovic and Eduardo Galdoniga,\n0:34 Comment: which at the last moment Milik was stopped several times.\n0:38 Comment: Napoli earns a penalty.\n0:41 Comment: Colifon does not agree.\n0:42 Comment: Haitham Ali Sami, defender of the Norwegian national team.\n0:45 Comment: You can't tell by looking.\n0:47 Comment: With Moroccan roots, just also a newcomer Polermo.\n0:54 Comment: Polermo is trying to play compact.\n0:56 Comment: I don't know, there's very little space between the lines.\n0:58 Comment: In principle, they have succeeded so far.\n1:0 Comment: But, again, you can't press yourself close to your goal,\n1:2 Comment: because Napoli is a good team,\n1:4 Comment: Very creative attack group.\n1:6 Comment: And they will always find their chance if you practically don’t leave the defense.\n1:9 Comment: We've already talked about this several times.\n1:11 Comment: Indeed, although Polermo should be praised for the first half,\n1:14 Comment: there is still a certain feeling that\n1:17 Comment: Sooner or later Napoli will achieve their goal.\n1:19 Comment: But maybe Polermo will play differently in the second half.\n1:21 Comment: Diamante is launching on the right flank\n1:23 Comment: who just replaced Ilyin Nestorovsky.\n1:27 Comment: Gamshik is great in selection.\n1:29 Comment: That's it, the danger has been eliminated.\n1:33 Comment: Now, according to the classics, Polermo will sit back.\n1:36 Comment: Approximately on the line, on the center of the line, on the line of the center of the field.\n1:40 Comment: And he will greet Napoli slowly.\n1:44 Comment: Sinyem Gamshik.\n1:46 Comment: This brew is still together.\n1:48 Comment: Zelinsky casting is great.\n1:50 Comment: Ghulyam is connecting. Finally, we got a little confused.\n1:52 Comment: Shot and...\n1:55 Comment: Marie Hamszyk catches up with this attack\n1:57 Comment: and opens the scoring with a gorgeous shot off the crossbar.\n2:1 Comment: Good attack and made an excellent pass slightly under himself.\n2:4 Comment: Gamshik was typing there.\n2:6 Comment: And that's what Milik needed to do in the first half,\n2:8 Comment: when he kicked with his left foot but missed the ball,\n2:10 Comment: It's just as easy to hit the goal.\n2:12 Comment: And the goalkeeper couldn't do anything.\n2:14 Comment: It is very important that Hamshik started this attack,\n2:16 Comment: And he finished it.\n2:18 Comment: He managed to keep up with its development.\n2:20 Comment: It opened into the zone, and no one had time to block it.\n2:23 Comment: And look how dissatisfied Alexander Gadsi, the defensive player, is with himself,\n2:26 Comment: Who really didn't make it here for Hamsik.\n2:30 Comment: Yes, exactly. Gadsi ran, ran, ran, ran.\n2:32 Comment: I tried to catch up, then I tried to catch up in the tackle,\n2:34 Comment: But I didn't have time.\n2:36 Comment: Gamshik was the first, with his left foot just off the crossbar.\n2:38 Comment: 1-0.\n2:40 Comment: Kisses the hand. Everyone is happy.\n2:42 Comment: The team wins. Bye.\n2:44 Comment: That's how important self-confidence and, of course, performance skill are.\n2:46 Comment: 1-0.\n2:48 Comment: We were waiting for something to hit us. It happened pretty quickly.\n2:50 Comment: In the second half, already 2 minutes after it started\n2:53 Comment: and now the game must change.\n2:54 Comment: Palermo goes forward. Diamanti crosses straight away.\n2:56 Comment: Palermo's attack. It's a rare beast in this match.\n2:58 Comment: You can put it in the Red Book.\n3:0 Comment:  That's for sure.\n3:2 Comment: But now we need to change something, because, losing 1-0,\n3:4 Comment: This is how to play defensively, play as number two\n3:6 Comment: Not entirely profitable.\n3:8 Comment: Perhaps there will be another replacement.\n3:10 Comment: Maybe someone else will join the attack group near Palermo.\n3:12 Comment: Yes, there are other options there.\n3:14 Comment: Both Troikovsky and Norbert Balok.\n3:16 Comment: Another Hungarian forward.\n3:18 Comment: And Ivaylo Chochev,\n3:20 Comment: who has been playing in Palermo for quite some time.\n3:23 Comment: But, of course, there are not enough stars.\n3:25 Comment: With all intents and purposes\n3:27 Comment: it would be here\n3:29 Comment: We need some person who could decide.\n3:31 Comment: He's probably alone.\n3:33 Comment: Palermo is Alexandru Diamanti.\n3:35 Comment: You said about Hamsik's confidence,\n3:37 Comment: and I absolutely agree that it is Milik\n3:39 Comment: It’s this calmness that’s missing.\n3:41 Comment: Because, you must admit, Gamshik does not run headlong,\n3:43 Comment: And it’s not his goal in itself to bother his head.\n3:45 Comment: But when he had a chance, he immediately took advantage of it.\n3:47 Comment: This is exactly what Milik lacks.\n3:49 Comment: We look, in my opinion, again. Yes, we look at the moment.\n3:52 Comment: Everything is very cool. Look, he’s raising his head,\n3:54 Comment: He lifts and gives off magnificently with his left foot.\n3:56 Comment: And immediately Gamshik everything flares up.\n3:58 Comment: Milik, by the way, also correctly participated in this attack.\n4:0 Comment: He brought a defender behind him to the near post,\n4:2 Comment: thus freeing up this space into which Gamshik could get.\n4:4 Comment: Absolutely right. We discussed this\n4:6 Comment: in the first half, what Milika when\n4:8 Comment: There were passes to the far post, but he wasn't there.\n4:10 Comment: But in fact, he is always on the other side, leading away,\n4:12 Comment: If he doesn’t get to the ball, he takes the opponent away.\n4:14 Comment: And that’s exactly where we go to this zone\n4:16 Comment: Gamshik burst into the second attack.\n4:18 Comment: And that led to a fight.\n4:20 Comment: Roberto De Zerbi rushes like a lion in a cage,\n4:22 Comment: Palermo head coach.\n4:24 Comment: They might take him away after this match.\n4:26 Comment: Oh-oh-oh. You know, anything can happen.\n4:32 Comment: It turns out that he hasn’t actually led the team yet,\n4:34 Comment: because in this meeting he\n4:36 Comment: disqualified and forced to remain in the stands.\n4:40 Comment: Kulebali played well before this.\n4:42 Comment: And I have a feeling that this is the only person,\n4:44 Comment: who hasn't made a mistake in this match yet.\n4:46 Comment:  With a ball.\n4:48 Comment: I made a mistake once, but I corrected my mistake,\n4:50 Comment: when an inaccurate pass was in our own half of the field.\n4:52 Comment: And now an inaccurate pass towards Insigne.\n4:54 Comment: It's going to be a goal kick.\n4:58 Comment: Five minutes played in the second half,\n5:0 Comment: but the situation has already changed a lot, because\n5:2 Comment: Napole is packed.\n5:6 Comment: Napoli players do not allow Palermo players to play.\n5:8 Comment: They meet high, the team immediately moves.\n5:10 Comment: And look, that's all, that's all.\n5:12 Comment: No one to give it to. And interception.\n5:14 Comment: And very dangerous, maybe from Milik.\n5:16 Comment: Zielinsky was looking for a partner in the Polish national team.\n5:18 Comment:  Have not found.\n5:20 Comment: I was looking for a compatriot.\n5:24 Comment: Well, now we need to put pressure on Palermo.\n5:26 Comment: And now he really asks\n5:28 Comment: go ahead of partners.\n5:30 Comment: Ilya Nastarovsky was the replacement.\n5:34 Comment: It seems to me that the coach needs to decide on drastic changes here,\n5:36 Comment: because playing in the second number is already, well, simply pointless.\n5:38 Comment:  Need to\n5:40 Comment: raise the line of pressure and try\n5:42 Comment: catch Napoli by surprise\n5:44 Comment: and look for your chance. And Milik right away\n5:46 Comment: He gave it and immediately forward. Immediately forward, like a real forward.\n5:48 Comment: Dangerous. Insidia is good. 2-0.\n5:50 Comment: Kalihon.

    "summary": "In a comprehensive display of tactical superiority and clinical finishing, Napoli emerged victorious against Palermo with a commanding 3-0 win. The match, played at the Stadio Renzo Barbera, highlighted Napoli's dynamic attacking prowess and Palermo's struggles in both defense and offense.\n\nFrom the outset, Napoli established their intent by adopting a high pressing strategy. They quickly put Palermo under pressure, forcing the home side to sit deep and defend in numbers. Napoli, dressed in their classic blue kits, committed to a high-pressing game reminiscent of Spanish Barcelona, as they constantly harried Palermo's players, not allowing them any space or time on the ball.\n\nArkadiusz Milik was of particular interest, having impressed many during the European Championships and continuing to do so with his goal-scoring form for Napoli. Despite the high expectations, Milik struggled to convert his chances in the first half, often finding himself thwarted by Palermo’s defense, particularly Slobodan Rajković and Edoardo Goldaniga, who remained resolute in their duties.\n\nMarek Hamšík, a pivotal figure for Napoli for over a decade, showcased why he is held in such high regard. His deep involvement in the build-up play and fluid movement into attacking positions made him a constant threat. Alongside him, Lorenzo Insigne, the diminutive forward with bleached hair, attempted to create havoc with his dribbling and willingness to take on defenders.\n\nDespite Napoli's dominance in possession and offensive maneuvers, the first half ended without goals. Palermo, often pinned back in their half, managed to thwart Naples' attacks, although they offered very little going forward themselves. On the few occasions they did venture out, it was through the orchestrated play of Alessandro Diamanti, who, even at 33, showed glimpses of class, but found himself isolated without significant support.\n\nThe second half saw Napoli break the deadlock just two minutes in. An intricate passing move culminated in Marek Hamšík, patiently waiting outside the box, collecting a layoff and firing a shot that thundered off the crossbar into the net. The assist came from Fawzi Ghoulam, whose overlapping run and subsequent cross were perfectly timed.\n\nThis breakthrough catalyzed Napoli, who soon doubled their lead. José Callejón, much more involved in the second half, netted after a clever exchange of passes opened up Palermo's defense once more. A pinpoint pass from Piotr Zieliński found Callejón in the box, who made no mistake, finishing expertly to the goalkeeper's right. The goal highlighted Napoli's fluid attacking play and Palermo's inability to contain them.\n\nNapoli's dominance was further confirmed with a third goal ten minutes later. José Callejón, again, was at the heart of it, capitalizing on a lapse in concentration from Palermo's defense. Zieliński, driving forward and drawing defenders towards him, slotted a pass that found Callejón, who squeezed a shot under the goalkeeper. The strike not only secured his brace but also effectively put the game beyond Palermo's reach.\n\nDespite being two goals down, Palermo offered a brief glimmer of threat, with Bruno Henrique, fresh off the bench, narrowly heading over the bar from a cross. However, this chance was a mere aberration as Napoli continued to control proceedings. The hosts couldn't muster any sustained pressure, with even their talisman Diamanti finding himself constantly outnumbered and isolated.\n\nArkadiusz Milik, despite his best efforts, couldn’t find his name on the scoresheet. His movements were intelligent as he often dropped deep to link up play or made runs to drag defenders out of position, creating space for his teammates. However, Milik was substituted, visibly frustrated at not bagging at least one goal for his efforts.\n\nThe introduction of Dries Mertens and Manolo Gabbiadini added fresh legs and another dimension to Napoli's play. Mertens, a livewire, continuously pressed high and tried to exploit tired legs in Palermo's defense. Gabbiadini, too, had his moments but failed to convert clear-cut chances, his closest attempt saved commendably by Josip Posavec.\n\nNapoli's defensive solidity, led by the imposing Kalidou Koulibaly and the experienced Raúl Albiol, ensured that their goalkeeper, Pepe Reina, had a relatively quiet evening. The few times Palermo broke through, either Koulibaly or Albiol was there to snuff out the danger.\n\nFor Palermo, the night was one of missed opportunities and defensive lapses. Their approach was largely reactive, aiming to absorb pressure and hit on the counter but failed to transition effectively. Their defensive organization in the first half unraveled as soon as the first goal was scored, and they could not regain any semblance of control or compactness thereafter.\n\nThe final whistle brought relief to Palermo, having withstood a relentless Napoli onslaught. The Sicilian side, now with more questions than answers, turned their focus on regrouping and strategizing for the grueling Serie A campaign ahead.\n\nFor Napoli, this match was a statement of their offensive capabilities and a reaffirmation of their title ambitions. Maurizio Sarri’s men exhibited tactical discipline, creative flair, and importantly, an ability to score crucial goals. With the likes of Hamšík, Insigne, Callejón, and the emerging Piotr Zieliński pulling the strings, Napoli posed a formidable threat, capable of breaking down the staunchest of defenses.\n\nTo conclude, Napoli’s 3-0 victory over Palermo was marked by brilliant individual performances, cohesive team play, and strategic superiority. While Arkadiusz Milik's lack of goals might be a slight concern, the overall team performance overshadowed individual shortcomings. For Palermo, the match underscored the need for strengthened resolve and strategic adjustments if they aim to climb the Serie A table."
