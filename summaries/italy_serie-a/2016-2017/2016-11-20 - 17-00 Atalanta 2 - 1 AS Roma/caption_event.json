    "summary": "The highly anticipated match between Atalanta and AS Roma took place on a sunny afternoon at the Stadio Atleti Azzurri d'Italia. From the very start, it was clear that both teams were eager to dominate, and the game didn’t disappoint in delivering an exhilarating contest. \n\nAs soon as the referee blew the whistle at kick-off, Atalanta took the initiative to move the ball up the field. However, it wasn't long before the ball went out of play, setting the tone for a game that would be full of interruptions. AS Roma's defense was called into action early on, with several clearances in the opening minutes setting the stage for a defensive tug-of-war.\n\nAtalanta's offensive efforts were tangible from the outset, with the first shot on target coming at just 3:35. Despite their early endeavors, AS Roma's defense stood firm. AS Roma responded with a corner kick, but the delivery from Diego Perotti failed to find its mark, and Atalanta managed to clear their lines, showcasing their defensive composure.\n\nThe match quickly became a physical battle with several fouls disrupting play. By the 5th minute, both teams had already committed fouls that led to indirect free-kicks. The first near miss came from Atalanta at 6:18, when a shot went off target, illustrating their growing offensive pressure. Nevertheless, AS Roma's defense continually cleared their lines effectively, often pushing Atalanta back.\n\nAs the minutes ticked by, Atalanta seemed to capitalize on every opportunity to push forward. By the 8th minute, another shot on target from Atalanta tested AS Roma’s goalkeeper, Wojciech Szczesny, who would later play a crucial role in keeping his team in the game.\n\nAS Roma gradually started to find their rhythm midway through the first half with a series of corners. Perotti's subsequent corner was neutralized by Atalanta’s defense, but Roma kept the pressure on. By 11:27, Perotti sent another corner into the box, only for Etrit Berisha, Atalanta's goalkeeper, to collect it confidently.\n\nThe game progressed with continuous back-and-forth thrusts from both sides. There was a significant moment at the 13:51 mark when Edin Dzeko's strong challenge led referee Riccardo Di Fiore to blow for a foul, setting the scene for more AS Roma corners that failed to result in a meaningful chance.\n\nFouls occurred frequently enough to slightly dampen the flow of the game, like the clumsy one by Mohammed Salah at 14:21 during what seemed a promising solo run that was blocked. This pattern of interruptions minimized long spells of possession for either team, suggesting a game defined by brief bursts of activity rather than sustained pressure.\n\nOne of Atalanta's best early chances came during the 17:55 mark when Alejandro Gomez saw an opportunity close to the offside line but couldn't quite break through the stern AS Roma defense. Another key attempt by Roberto Gagliardini at 21:00 saw a good pass deep into the box, only for his shot to go embarrassingly off target.\n\nAs in any high-stakes match, discipline issues came to the fore. Salah’s foul at 24:00 for his careless challenge showed the competitive undercurrent of the game. There were more flashes of potential from AS Roma, with Edin Dzeko missing a header at 25:02 from a promising lofted pass.\n\nMohammed Salah was particularly vibrant in the first half, evidenced at 25:29 when he broke past Atalanta’s defense and saw his shot thwarted by a daring save from Berisha. Yet, Atalanta's resolve was put to the test repeatedly, and they relied on consistent clearances and defensive orchestration to keep their goal intact.\n\nThen, drama unfolded at 39:35 when Rafael Toloi handled the ball inside the box, leading to AS Roma being awarded a penalty. Diego Perotti stepped up and coolly converted with a low drive into the left side of the net, putting AS Roma in the lead by the 40-minute mark. The goal was crucial as it marked the first real breakthrough and set the baseline for the tactical adjustments in the second half.\n\nAtalanta, undeterred by the late first-half setback, attempted a rally through Alejandro Gomez, who found himself with a prime scoring chance right before the half-time whistle. However, his header went well over the bar, signaling missed opportunities and ensuring the halftime scoreline stayed 1-0 in favor of AS Roma.\n\nWith the second half underway, AS Roma kicked off with immediate vigor. Leonardo Spinazzola from Atalanta tried to send a long ball across the pitch early on, but it fruitlessly went out of play, demonstrating early nerves. Several minutes into the half, Atalanta showed intent by pushing forward and attempting crosses that didn’t connect. \n\nA significant in-game management decision came at 4:00 when Atalanta decided to bolster their squad by substituting Marco D'Alessandro for Andrea Masiello. The change was a tactical shift aiming to impose more attacking prowess to overturn the one-goal deficit.\n\nAS Roma's defensive resilience held until about the 11:14 mark when Atalanta's Rafael Toloi saw his close-range header spectacularly saved by Szczesny, keeping Atalanta temporarily at bay. Another substitution was made by Atalanta with Remo Freuler replacing Jasmin Kurtic at 12:00 to freshen the squad and inject some new energy.\n\nThe pendulum swung in Atalanta's favor when they finally broke through at 16:26 with a superb goal by Mattia Caldara.
