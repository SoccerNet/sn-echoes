he stands up.\n36:47 Comment: It's great how Gomez is turning out.\n36:52 Comment: Gagliardino supported him.\n36:53 Comment: Zukanovic also supported him.\n36:56 Comment: There Kurtic went forward.\n36:57 Comment: Kessier helps.\n37:1 Comment: Soft serve.\n37:2 Comment: That's it.\n37:3 Comment: Fighters.\n37:4 Comment: Atalante.\n37:5 Comment: Power scored three goals in the season.\n37:6 Comment: But still, it’s hard for Gomez to fight for high balls in someone else’s penalty area.\n37:12 Comment: Derosi.\n37:13 Comment: Here Strotman acts in a completely justified manner.\n37:16 Comment: Falls under yet another violation of the rules.\n37:18 Comment: It was Masevu who met him.\n37:36 Comment: Manulas.\n37:48 Comment: Derosi.\n37:49 Comment: Ryddi Gärb.\n37:50 Comment: Xhaku is forced to take almost all the balls from behind in someone else's goal and outside the penalty area.\n37:54 Comment: But at the same time he does not break away from the team.\n37:56 Comment: And it's not that simple.\n38:0 Comment: What to do with this ball.\n38:3 Comment: It is not simple.\n38:4 Comment: Doesn't break away from the team.\n38:5 Comment: And Roma’s attacking block is quite compact.\n38:9 Comment: He cannot go into the penalty area alone when everyone here is still at war with the Atalanta midfield.\n38:18 Comment: Shchensny.\n38:20 Comment: As an additional field player it has now worked.\n38:24 Comment: Helped me pick up this ball.\n38:26 Comment: De Rossi.\n38:27 Comment: Long ball towards Salah.\n38:30 Comment: And now Strotman throws a great ball to Edin Jack.\n38:33 Comment: How to get together with this ball, this opportunity.\n38:37 Comment: Roman football team.\n38:39 Comment: And apparently Zukanovic received a 11-meter penalty for handball.\n38:43 Comment: Although it might seem that this was the hand of keeper Berisha.\n38:48 Comment: But.\n38:54 Comment: We'll figure out.\n38:56 Comment: Now.\n38:58 Comment: Zukanovic threw the ball away.\n38:59 Comment: And a new show.\n39:0 Comment: Different from Strotman.\n39:3 Comment: Yes.\n39:3 Comment: The ball hits the hand.\n39:5 Comment: Field player.\n39:6 Comment: In what ways is it not Zukanovic?\n39:7 Comment: This is Rafael Toloi.\n39:10 Comment: What a heel pass from Jack.\n39:16 Comment: What happened, happened.\n39:17 Comment: The ball was on target.\n39:18 Comment: And the involuntary nature of the touch does not serve as any justification here.\n39:24 Comment: Without any doubt.\n39:25 Comment: I approached the 11-meter mark.\n39:29 Comment: Diego Perotti.\n39:33 Comment: The ball rolled slightly from the 11-meter mark there.\n39:36 Comment: But this didn’t bother anyone.\n39:38 Comment: 0-1 in the 40th minute.\n39:40 Comment: Diego Perotti scores the penalty kick.\n39:43 Comment: Yes.\n39:44 Comment: Everything is to the point.\n39:46 Comment: Roma repeatedly made these one-touch throws.\n39:53 Comment: Behind the back defender.\n39:55 Comment: And now there is this second wave of attack.\n40:0 Comment: Well, here we go.\n40:1 Comment: Maybe.\n40:3 Comment: Don't have your hand in that place.\n40:5 Comment: Then Loi everything would have ended well for Atalanta.\n40:9 Comment: Because Berishev forced the glove.\n40:12 Comment: And it seemed to me that he could block this blow.\n40:16 Comment: And without help.\n40:21 Comment: Brazilian defender.\n40:22 Comment: But he, of course, did it unwittingly.\n40:26 Comment: This, however, does not make it any easier for Atalanta.\n40:30 Comment: Roma scores.\n40:42 Comment: This is the 30th ball.\n40:46 Comment: Romans this season.\n40:48 Comment: There, in my opinion, the Roma fans are starting some mild disturbances.\n40:51 Comment: Therefore, Daniel Deroyce goes to the podium of his fans.\n40:57 Comment: To calm them down as much as possible.\n40:59 Comment: And here Daniel Deroyce is already melting into smoke.\n41:8 Comment: Having nothing to do with fruit trees.\n41:11 Comment: This is pyrotechnics.\n41:13 Comment: Yes, Roma scores the 30th goal.\n41:15 Comment: Roma is the most successful team in Serie A.\n41:19 Comment: Juventus, even having scored three goals against Pescara in this round, has 28 goals so far.\n41:24 Comment: But Juventus still has an even better goal difference.\n41:32 Comment: Plus 19.\n41:33 Comment: Roma is now plus 18.\n41:37 Comment: Last five minutes.\n41:41 Comment: Took off.\n41:43 Comment: Let's go.\n41:57 Comment: Very important for Atalanta.\n41:59 Comment: Because the owners need to try to get together now and strike back.\n42:12 Comment: If possible, of course.\n42:23 Comment: But actually it is not.\n42:29 Comment: In the first part he scores his fourth goal.\n42:32 Comment: In this season.\n42:38 Comment: He is the team's third scorer after Djeku and Salah.\n42:42 Comment: Which have 10.8 goals scored, respectively.\n42:46 Comment: Now it’s possible that Atalanta will be able to create something in attack.\n42:51 Comment: Atalant.\n42:52 Comment: Gogliardini.\n42:53 Comment: In terms of possession of the ball, we see the hosts slightly ahead.\n42:56 Comment: And an unusual blow.\n42:59 Comment: Gomez lands a sudden blow.\n43:2 Comment: But he was too weak.\n43:5 Comment: To impress Wojciech Szczęcny.\n43:8 Comment: Rüdiger.\n43:9 Comment: Jerk.\n43:11 Comment: Broadcast.\n43:12 Comment: Jack.\n43:13 Comment: One touch to Ingolan.\n43:15 Comment: He also doesn't waste time.\n43:17 Comment: Strotman.\n43:19 Comment: A few sours.\n43:21 Comment: Atalanta's players look big now.\n43:26 Comment: Salah.\n43:27 Comment: How easily he was now freed from guardianship.\n43:33 Comment: But here I am alone.\n43:35 Comment: They leave Gomez.\n43:36 Comment: He makes a pass immediately in touch.\n43:38 Comment: Atalanta’s attack now played in this Roman style.\n43:42 Comment: But Pitanini was able to seize his chance.\n43:46 Comment: Here he is an additional defender.\n43:48 Comment: If three and a half.\n43:49 Comment: That.\n43:50 Comment: In principle, even the last two can run away.\n43:53 Comment: At Roma's.\n43:54 Comment: Because Daniel Edros is always ready to back up.\n43:57 Comment: Rüdiger.\n43:58 Comment: It was a good idea.\n43:59 Comment: Indeed, Edin Jack revealed himself there.\n44:1 Comment: But Perotti.\n44:2 Comment: It was Perotti who now took advantage of the sluggishness.\n44:5 Comment: Here's another pass behind the back.\n44:7 Comment: How often.\n44:8 Comment: How regularly do they happen?\n44:9 Comment: Never before has an offside been recorded as a result of such a pass.\n44:12 Comment: Here.\n44:13 Comment: I think there's a problem ahead.\n44:15 Comment: It's up to Gian-Pierre Gasperini to decide at half-time.\n44:18 Comment: How to contain it.\n44:20 Comment: This.\n44:21 Comment: Method of attack.\n44:23 Comment: Romans.\n44:24 Comment: How to eliminate the possibility of such sharp throws into the penalty area.\n44:29 Comment: Which are constantly used.\n44:31 Comment: Salah.\n44:32 Comment: Jacko.\n44:33 Comment: Nain Golan.\n44:35 Comment: Perotti.\n44:37 Comment: And in the last minute of the half.\n44:40 Comment: Roma wins a corner.\n44:48 Comment: Bohamed Salah.\n44:50 Comment: Four corners of Rome.\n44:52 Comment: Not a single one in Bergamo yet.\n44:54 Comment: Salah.\n44:58 Comment: Rüdige.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: The ball is played in the classic way in the center of the field now by Nain Golan and Jack\n0:7 Comment: And while Raja even tried to go forward himself, but was restrained by Gomez\n0:14 Comment: And here is Bruno Perez, passing into the penalty area\n0:17 Comment: Roma has a very active attacking right-back\n0:21 Comment: This team has historically had very bright football players in the formal defense\n0:28 Comment: But actually in attack on the flank\n0:30 Comment: There was Vincent Candela, there was Cafu\n0:33 Comment: And in this powerful tradition, the game of Bruno Perez is absolutely\n0:41 Comment: The footballer apparently still has good prospects\n0:50 Comment: He spends his first season with Roma\n0:58 Comment: Previously played for Torino\n1:6 Comment: Was a main player for two seasons\n1:12 Comment: And he scored three goals each time\n1:14 Comment: Bruno Perez is 26 years old\n1:19 Comment: The age is still normal, suitable for big things\n1:22 Comment: Here's another football player who made the most pleasant impressions with his performance in the first half\n1:28 Comment: This is Atalanta's right flank\n1:32 Comment: Leonardo Spinazolo\n1:35 Comment: In the replay we can still see how softly and beautifully Yasmin Kurtic handled the ball.\n1:41 Comment: And now Fazio Strotman is stepping forward\n1:46 Comment: Fazio Bruno Perez again\n1:48 Comment: What cramped little technical areas for coaches in the stadium in Bergamo\n1:55 Comment: Something is not so good here for some broad-minded people\n1:58 Comment: And it's not that it definitely won't fit\n1:59 Comment: Especially when emotions come to visit them\n2:3 Comment: This is how Ganeli Derosi plays\n2:10 Comment: Including hands, including a small lung such rudeness\n2:15 Comment: However, this is not rudeness\n2:16 Comment: It's just experience, look, he yelled at everyone\n2:18 Comment: He even yelled at the fans now\n2:20 Comment: And in my opinion, he shouted them down\n2:22 Comment: And most importantly, the truth is behind him\n2:25 Comment: Indeed, the ball went away from his opponent’s foot\n2:28 Comment: Now out of bounds\n2:30 Comment: Fazio, long kick forward\n2:31 Comment: Strikes, can hardly be called a pass\n2:34 Comment: Jack applauded this program\n2:37 Comment: Just out of politeness\n2:39 Comment: Due to inaccurate passes, Roma surrounds Talanta twice\n2:49 Comment: I just have a suspicion that Roma generally makes more passes in general\n2:54 Comment: Therefore, there are also more inaccurate ones among them\n2:56 Comment: Although the proportions, of course, are not very large\n2:58 Comment: Not like that\n2:59 Comment: In completed passes\n3:2 Comment: Not one to two\n3:3 Comment: Masiello\n3:10 Comment: And here is the transmission\n3:12 Comment: It seems that Gomez took the ball comfortably\n3:17 Comment: But Manolos was nearby\n3:19 Comment: Kurtic\n3:20 Comment: Dangerous\n3:23 Comment: Free kick\n3:28 Comment: And transfer\n3:30 Comment: Cross section\n3:31 Comment: Maslenitsa\n3:32 Comment: And from behind\n3:33 Comment: took off\n3:34 Comment: But he didn’t fly away\n3:35 Comment: And here is this saucepan\n3:36 Comment: took off\n3:38 Comment: But didn't fly away\n3:39 Comment: took off\n3:42 Comment: But didn't fly away\n3:43 Comment: took off\n3:45 Comment: Now people say I was wrong\n3:47 Comment: Trying to calculate Spinazolo's actions\n3:50 Comment: But he was physically fit enough to jump back, pick up the ball, and make a pass forward\n3:55 Comment: And there it is already against Perotti\n3:56 Comment: Doesn't fly away\n3:58 Comment: Spinazolo didn't play very well.\n4:0 Comment: And now there's a replacement.\n4:2 Comment: And just now.\n4:5 Comment: In place of Andrea Masielo.\n4:10 Comment: Marco D'Alessandro comes out.\n4:12 Comment: At number seven.\n4:25 Comment: It’s a bit tough here, of course, after the break.\n4:28 Comment: Marco D'Alessandro.\n4:32 Comment: Field center player.\n4:41 Comment: Now some kind of restructuring will happen.\n4:46 Comment: Although now he still occupies the position of this left in the central three.\n4:51 Comment: But one can assume that he should be a little more active forward.\n4:58 Comment: The ball will be under his foot.\n5:11 Comment: Talent today cannot count on Andrea Conti at all.\n5:14 Comment: This is probably the most important loss so far.\n5:16 Comment: Also, Bukari Drameh, Abdoulaye Konko.\n5:20 Comment: Well, at Roma Manolas returned to duty.\n5:25 Comment: And they are still waiting.\n5:28 Comment: Romans by Alexandru Florence, Thomas Fermalina, Mario Rui.\n5:32 Comment: Well, Francesco Totti, of course.\n5:34 Comment: A promising attack was ruined by a not very accurate pass.\n5:40 Comment: Nutrition apologizes.\n5:41 Comment: Because he gave a little harshly.\n5:44 Comment: He took the ball.\n5:46 Comment: Convenient.\n5:48 Comment: And here is Otto.\n5:49 Comment: That's what he gave.\n5:51 Comment: Like a stranger.\n5:53 Comment: It’s even embarrassing to open your eyes and look them in the eyes.\n5:58 Comment: Abdoulaye Konko.\n6:1 Comment: Alexandru Gobbis.\n6:10 Comment: Take the charm.\n6:11 Comment: One touch.\n6:14 Comment: On Caldaro.\n6:16 Comment: Here we go on to Rafael Toloe.\n6:20 Comment: And this is where it gets a little stuck.\n6:22 Comment: Attack Talent.\n6:23 Comment: Gagliardini turns in this direction.\n6:26 Comment: Kessier.\n6:26 Comment: To the left front.\n6:28 Comment: Wing.\n6:29 Comment: Here you go, D'Alessandro's offensive inclusion now.\n6:34 Comment: Something we haven’t seen performed by Masiello, of course.\n6:37 Comment: Masiello preferred to participate in attacks with long forward passes.\n6:40 Comment: Occasionally.\n6:41 Comment: Kessier.\n6:41 Comment: There was a touch of the ball.\n6:43 Comment: And Roma intercepts.\n6:44 Comment: Nain Gulan.\n6:44 Comment: The attack slows down a little due to the fact that I had to make this pass on the pirote.\n6:48 Comment: And who forced, in fact, Nain Gulan?\n6:49 Comment: But it doesn't matter anymore.\n6:50 Comment: Because there is an attack.\n6:51 Comment: She flies forward.\n6:52 Comment: The ball is on the left flank.\n6:53 Comment: Jacko.\n6:54 Comment: In front of him.\n6:54 Comment: The clouds are gathering, the clouds are gathering.\n6:56 Comment: But he finds an opportunity to pass to Nain Gulan.\n6:59 Comment: A powerful blow.\n7:1 Comment: But just to cut off the head.\n7:5 Comment: He closed his eyes a little.\n7:8 Comment: He winced a little.\n7:10 Comment: It was painful.\n7:10 Comment: The ball flew away quickly.\n7:13 Comment: But this attack was probably worth more.\n7:17 Comment: Fifth corner.\n7:20 Comment: But he hasn’t earned any talent yet.\n7:24 Comment: We fought back quite easily.\n7:29 Comment: Gagliardini did it.\n7:31 Comment: And here is a yellow card.\n7:33 Comment: Here's the second half right away.\n7:34 Comment: And for such a foul, which in the first...\n7:36 Comment: Well, of course, it would be marked by a stoppage of the game.\n7:40 Comment: The cards came right away.\n7:41 Comment: Strotman receives his first warning of the match.\n7:47 Comment: Actually, well-deserved.\n7:48 Comment: Argue with Nesich, of course.\n7:51 Comment: Jumped in the leg.\n7:52 Comment: Got it.\n7:52 Comment: Jumped.\n7:54 Comment: Perhaps he saved Perotti's cards in this way,\n7:57 Comment: who was there catching up with Gomez from behind.\n8:1 Comment: And he was already trying on the jump.\n8:5 Comment: Edin Jack's touch was not exactly played now.\n8:8 Comment: Gagliardini was very attentive.\n8:17 Comment: Jack.\n8:18 Comment: Derosi.\n8:24 Comment: Kurtic loses the ball.\n8:32 Comment: I went overboard with Grigoriev.\n8:33 Comment: Grudia.\n8:34 Comment: One touch.\n8:35 Comment: All in one touch.\n8:36 Comment: Strotman also throws the ball right away.\n8:38 Comment: Without hesitation.\n8:38 Comment: Forward.\n8:40 Comment: Berisha is here.\n8:44 Comment: Let off some steam now.\n8:46 Comment: From mouth.\n8:49 Comment: Here are some belittling words from Luciano and Paletti.\n8:52 Comment: AND...\n8:54 Comment: Quite cool Bergamo.\n9:2 Comment: But we remember that Luciano managed to adapt in his career\n9:7 Comment: to much more severe weather conditions.\n9:11 Comment: In the cold.\n9:13 Comment: He took off himself in outerwear.\n9:15 Comment: Been there in pleasant moments of victory.\n9:23 Comment: Gallardini.\n9:24 Comment: These programs started.\n9:26 Comment: Yes.\n9:27 Comment: Nutrition takes the ball.\n9:28 Comment: Faco is hanging on it.\n9:30 Comment: Power back.\n9:33 Comment: And Gallardini.\n9:35 Comment: What's the next solution?\n9:36 Comment: Pass to Gomez.\n9:38 Comment: Against Gomez here is Bruno Perez.\n9:40 Comment: Argentina vs Brazil.\n9:41

    "summary": "In an electrifying contest, Atalanta triumphed over Roma 2-1 in a gripping encounter held in Bergamo. The stage was set with Atalanta's remarkable showcase of resilience, overcoming one of Serie A's top sides.\n\n**First Half:**\n\nThe game unfolded with excitement right from the get-go. Federico Fazio at number 20 spearheaded the defense for Roma, with Bruno Perez operating the left flank diligently. The midfield was well-guarded by Kevin Strootman and Daniel De Rossi, both bringing their experience into play. In the attacking region, Roma had a formidable lineup with Mohamed Salah on the right, Diego Perotti on the left, and Radja Nainggolan taking charge in the center to create opportunities for Edin Dzeko up front.\n\nThe game saw Roma's head coach Luciano Spalletti meticulously orchestrating his team's approach. In the opening minutes, both teams engaged cautiously, understanding the weight of each pass and tackle. Roma initiated the first attack around the ten-minute mark when a dynamic breakthrough tested Kostas Manolas, who had just returned to duty post-injury, making his presence felt instantly.\n\nGasperini’s men, showcasing immense tactical discipline and aggression, remained undeterred. The aggressive nature of Atalanta’s play forced Roma to transform their tactical utility, seen through various ball recoveries and small gains. Atalanta, though perceived as underdogs against a high-flying Roma, kept their heads cool and displayed the season's great form, justifying their current sixth place in Serie A standings with 22 points to Roma's 26.\n\nAs the game matured, both teams indulged in gnarly midfield battles, Kevin Strootman and Radja Nainggolan imposing themselves physically. Frank Kesier was robust in midfield for Atalanta, consistently disrupting Roma's rhythm. His duels with Strootman were a sight to behold, as both players clashed endlessly for control of the crucial center territory.\n\nAround the 20-minute timeline, a notable moment arrived when Spinazzola's audacious move into Roma’s penalty area concluded with an overzealous shot that sailed off the target. This offensive momentum from Atalanta signaled their intention to attack vigorously. This was immediately followed by a sharp interception by Atalanta’s defense that led to a reversal of play, nearly catching Roma off-guard.\n\nNevertheless, despite Atalanta's valiant efforts, Roma was first to draw blood. In the 40th minute, Diego Perotti stepped up and converted a penalty kick, which rolled smoothly, making it 1-0 in Roma's favor. The penalty resulted from a handball incident involving Rafael Toloi, who inadvertently got in the way of a shot from Edin Dzeko. The conversion by Perotti was as clinical as it gets, sending Berisha the wrong way.\n\nRoma closed out the half by coasting on a wave of tactical coherence, yet Atalanta’s resolute defensive maneuvers ensured they trailed by just a single goal going into halftime.\n\n**Second Half:**\n\nThe second half commenced with Roma trying to maintain their dominance. Nain Golan and Jack facilitated an immediate push forward, but were promptly restrained by Gomez. Bruno Perez continued his exuberance, playing aggressively into the penalty area. Comparisons with illustrious former Roma fullbacks like Cafu and Vincent Candela were inevitable as Perez upheld the tradition of attacking defenders splendidly.\n\nAtalanta’s tactical adjustments saw Marco D'Alessandro substituted in, escalating their attack significantly. The second half was marked by a more abrasive tone; Kevin Strootman received a yellow card for a clumsy foul on an advancing Atalanta player. Roma locked horns with Atalanta’s midfield, Kessier particularly exhibiting unyielding determination and vigor. His physical play frequently tore through Roma’s midfield structures, mounting continuous pressure on their backline.\n\nBy the 59th minute, Spalletti identified the need for fresh legs, introducing Stefan El-Shaarawy to the fray. However, it was Atalanta who cascaded with intensity, creating profound attacking sequences. The persistence bore fruit as in the 62nd minute, a well-orchestrated move saw the ball pinball around Roma’s penalty area before Mattia Caldara managed to bundle it in, leveling the score 1-1. Kessier’s involvement was once again pivotal as his presence in Roma’s defensive area triggered the scrambling Roma defense.\n\nThe game oscillated precariously, with both teams vying tirelessly for supremacy. Roma’s attempts often met stout Atalanta resistance with players like D'Alessandro and Gomez pushing relentless counter-attacks. By the 71st minute, Gasperini revisited his bench, sending Remo Freuler onto the pitch, adding fresh offensive thrust against a teetering Roma defense. \n\nAs the game neared its climax, Atalanta’s Frank Kessier took center stage. In the 80th minute, a penalty was awarded following a mistimed challenge by Leandro Paredes, bringing Gomez down inside the box. Kessier, embodying composure and strength, stepped up and slotted the penalty with conviction, sealing the game at 2-1 for Atalanta. His celebration mirrored the passion and energy he infused throughout the match, confirming his rising star status in Serie A.\n\nRoma’s efforts to retaliate ran aground against a rejuvenated Atalanta defense, which displayed impeccable cohesion. In the dying minutes, Roma threw caution to the wind, but Atalanta’s defensive discipline held stout, with Berisha making crucial saves. The final moments were surmounted by tactical substitutions and tense barricades, ensuring Atalanta’s lead remained intact.\n\nThe conclusion of the match reflected a fascinating narrative where Atalanta, against all odds, dug deep into their reserves of grit and guile to secure a monumental victory over Roma 2-1. This match not only highlighted the tactical savvy of Gian Piero Gasperini but also underscored the unpredictable yet exhilarating essence of football where determination and precise execution can overturn the expectations and offer underdogs their day in the sun.\n\nAtalanta’s victory was celebrated with ebullient cheers from their fans, marking a defining moment in their season as they continued their impressive campaign in Serie A. The blend of spirited young talent and tactical mastery eventually tilted the scale against a heavyweight like Roma, further emphasizing that fortune favors the bold."
