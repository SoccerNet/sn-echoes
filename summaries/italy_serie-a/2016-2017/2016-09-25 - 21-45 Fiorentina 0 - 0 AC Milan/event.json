They managed a few shots on target and continued to push back Fiorentina’s advances. Their counter-attacks were swift but ultimately unfruitful, a pattern epitomized at the 27th minute mark where their attack ended in a shot off target.\n\n**Intensity and Frustrations**\nThe exertions and the highly competitive nature of the game saw tempers flare.
