Although it is the Roman team that needs to win and take points.\n4:23 Comment: You should have heard!\n4:24 Comment: When the lineups were announced, what happened at the stadium.\n4:28 Comment: It was something surreal, apparently on purpose.\n4:31 Comment: The announcer was harsh, so to speak.\n4:33 Comment: Announced last, especially since Totti is in reserve.\n4:37 Comment: And it so happened that he was the last to be announced.\n4:40 Comment: Number 10 to the Captain.\n4:42 Comment: The whole stadium roared.\n4:44 Comment: 60 thousand of their throats Francesco Totti.\n4:46 Comment: And after that the Announcer waited for a theatrical pause.\n4:50 Comment: And he said one Italian word.\n4:52 Comment: Alenatore.\n4:54 Comment: What does trainer mean in Russian?\n4:56 Comment: After that, 60 thousand whistled and buzzed like that.\n4:59 Comment: What I think is that Lucian Spalletti thought again.\n5:2 Comment: I wish I didn't come back here.\n5:4 Comment: To this

Lucian.\n5:27 Comment: Do you hear that, right?\n5:29 Comment: Applause in the stands.\n5:31 Comment: They are already waiting.\n5:33 Comment: Although it's only the sixth minute.\n5:35 Comment: They are already waiting for Totti to take the field.\n5:37 Comment: The question arises whether Totti should have been released from the first minutes for this match.\n5:41 Comment: The football player is in good shape.\n5:43 Comment: He believes he is ready to continue his career.\n5:46 Comment: But Luciano Spalletti believes that the result is more important than anything else.\n5:50 Comment: And left Totti in reserve today.\n5:52 Comment: Daniel Desrosy will take the set piece.\n6:3 Comment: And the goalkeeper, one of the few Italians, by the way, in the visiting team, builds a wall.\n6:12 Comment: Well, it’s unlikely that a blow will follow from here, like yesterday in the Barcelona-Aloves match.\n6:18 Comment: Moreover, there is a sharper angle here.\n6:20 Comment: Well, the presentation is not bad at all.\n6:21 Comment: It's very unfortunate that the ball goes out of bounds.\n6:24 Comment: Pavlo Tagliaventu is refereeing today's important match.\n6:28 Comment: And Lenito Giovanni Diliberaturo.\n6:31 Comment: Alexandro Lochicher.\n6:33 Comment: This is necessary.\n6:34 Comment: We have such beautiful Italian names as referees on the field today.\n6:43 Comment: Well, additional assistants Marco DiBello, Luca Firetto, Giorgio Piretti.\n6:48 Comment: Fourth referee.\n6:49 Comment: Well, I, your today's candidate.\n6:51 Comment: And, of course, Governor Georgy Cherdantsev.\n6:53 Comment: I consider it a great honor to work on such a match.\n6:57 Comment: Because, well, it really is, this is not just a Series A story.\n7:1 Comment: This is the story of all football.\n7:5 Comment: Well, it so happened that Francesco Totti’s career somehow developed.\n7:10 Comment: And she reached the peak before my eyes.\n7:12 Comment: Because somehow I was more focused on working at Serie A matches.\n7:17 Comment: In the late 90s and early 2000s.\n7:20 Comment: Just when Totti was shining in all his glory.\n7:23 Comment: And he approached the most important thing in his life.\n7:25 Comment: To victory at the World Championship.\n7:27 Comment: So far nothing interesting is happening.\n7:29 Comment: Gate of Genoa.\n7:30 Comment: Moreover, Genua wins the ball.\n7:31 Comment: And tries to carry out his attack.\n7:33 Comment: Pass to the right flank.\n7:35 Comment: Next is an attempt to do something here.\n7:38 Comment: The pitch is quite dangerous.\n7:40 Comment: Derosi returned to the penalty area.\n7:41 Comment: Emerson passes to Nain Golan.\n7:43 Comment: I wonder who will win the title of best Serie A player.\n7:47 Comment: This season I would vote for Nain Golan.\n7:49 Comment: Although both Buffon and Guain, I think, are also quite contenders.\n7:54 Comment: But if we talk about the best player of Roma this season.\n7:57 Comment: I would definitely say not Jack.\n7:59 Comment: Although he scored 29 goals.\n8:1 Comment: And Raju Nain Golan.\n8:3 Comment: Which has grown absolutely fantastically.\n8:5 Comment: The footballer, it seems to me, is no longer just European, but world class.\n8:9 Comment: And of course Raja will be a decoration of the Russian World Cup.\n8:13 Comment: I have no doubt that he will come with the Belgian national team.\n8:15 Comment: And he will become one of the main heroes of our championship.\n8:19 Comment: Because he is ours, Russian.\n8:21 Comment: Violation of the rules in the center of the field to Jack.\n8:25 Comment: By the way, I remind you of this from time to time.\n8:28 Comment: It's an interesting story about Serie A goalscorers.\n8:33 Comment: If Jack scores, what happens to happiness?\n8:36 Comment: He took it and ran out of the gate.\n8:38 Comment: Apparently the southern stand is pressing on him too.\n8:40 Comment: And the Pole did not return to the goal, to the target.\n8:42 Comment: The blow followed.\n8:43 Comment: Now the second ball would fly in there.\n8:45 Comment: AND...\n8:47 Comment: That would be very...\n8:49 Comment: Roma was relieved by the task of fighting for second place.\n8:55 Comment: Luchanov from the flight, leaving the technical area,\n8:59 Comment: trying to shout to a very good goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny.\n9:3 Comment: And still urge him to gather his thoughts.\n9:6 Comment: And think not about that, but about football.\n9:8 Comment: But I think it's very, very difficult to do.\n9:10 Comment: Even here, being in Moscow.\n9:12 Comment: Just getting ready for the match, reading the press,\n9:15 Comment: scrolling through Italian Twitter and social networks.\n9:18 Comment: There, in addition to the hashtag Totti, Totti Day, Totti Night in English, in Italian, in which language, Totti 10.\n9:24 Comment: Anything, any hashtags, combination of last name, first name, captain Roma number.\n9:29 Comment: There is nothing more to be said.\n9:31 Comment: No fight for second place.\n9:33 Comment: As if, in principle, no one is interested in this.\n9:35 Comment: This is a direct ticket to the Champions League.\n9:37 Comment: It was very difficult, of course, for Roma to prepare in such an environment and get in the right mood for this match.\n9:41 Comment: Emerson reached the penalty area with the ball.\n9:43 Comment: Broadcast...\n9:44 Comment: Jacko!\n9:45 Comment: Stango Jacko!\n9:46 Comment: Still, he got a start with his stomach.\n9:47 Comment: Still with his belly, he pushed the ball into the goal.\n9:50 Comment: And the score becomes 1-1.\n9:52 Comment: Roma's top scorer is where he needs to be when needed.\n9:56 Comment: And at a crucial moment he helps his team.\n10:0 Comment: And Luciano Spalletti as well.\n10:3 Comment: There is a goal.\n10:4 Comment: The next one.\n10:7 Comment: Well, speaking of what I already started talking about.\n10:11 Comment: Dzeko's 29th goal.\n10:14 Comment: In the history of Serie A.\n10:16 Comment: Since the 60s, since the 60s.\n10:19 Comment: There have only been 2 people in the last 50 years who have managed to score 30 or more goals in Serie A.\n10:26 Comment: This is Luca Toni in 2006, when he played for Ferentina.\n10:31 Comment: And Gonzalo Higuain for Juventus in, it seems, last season or the year before, last season.\n10:37 Comment: Dzeko, having scored the 29th, is now one goal closer to this figure.\n10:44 Comment: Very difficult.\n10:45 Comment: It's very difficult to score in Italy.\n10:47 Comment: Although times are changing.\n10:49 Comment: And this season there is simply amazing performance in the Italian Championship.\n10:53 Comment: Which breaks absolutely all stereotypes about the fact that this is the most closed, the most boring, the most uninteresting league.\n11:3 Comment: Catenacho.\n11:4 Comment: All this has already sunk into summer, drowned in this summer a long time ago.\n11:8 Comment: Very high performance in Serie A.\n11:11 Comment: The only major European championship.\n11:13 Comment: Serious.\n11:14 Comment: Which surpasses the Italian in terms of the average number of goals scored.\n11:21 Comment: This is the Spanish championship.\n11:23 Comment: 2.91 goals on average.\n11:27 Comment: Just think about it.\n11:28 Comment: They're scoring this season.\n11:30 Comment: That is almost 3 goals per game.\n11:32 Comment: In Spain 2.94.\n11:34 Comment: In the Netherlands, which has always been famous for its performance, 2.89.\n11:38 Comment: Germany 2.87.\n11:40 Comment: England.\n11:41 Comment: Well, of course, who came to England?\n11:43 Comment: Antonio Contesa, comrades.\n11:45 Comment: 2.80.\n11:46 Comment: In France 2.61.\n11:48 Comment: That is, Italy from Serie A.\n11:50 Comment: The second most successful championship this season.\n11:52 Comment: Look at Roma's results.\n11:56 Comment: That's 5-3.\n11:58 Comment: Something else like that.\n12:0 Comment: And so now there is always an injury on the field.\n12:2 Comment: A short pause.\n12:4 Comment: Emerson got it.\n12:6 Comment: He lies on the lawn, holding his thigh.\n12:8 Comment: And I’ll just say about these numbers again.\n12:10 Comment: I don't remember this.\n12:11 Comment: 6 people in Serie A this season before the last round.\n12:16 Comment: Well, some teams have already played their 38th game and finished the championship.\n12:20 Comment: Scored more than 20 goals.\n12:22 Comment: Jack is 29.\n12:23 Comment: Mertens 27.\n12:24 Comment: Belotti 25.\n12:25 Comment: Higuain 24.\n12:27 Comment: Icardi 24.\n12:28 Comment: And Mobile 22.\n12:30 Comment: This is what series A is like these days.\n12:32 Comment: And we are watching this combination again with the participation of Stropman,\n12:35 Comment: who carefully threw the ball into the penalty area.\n12:39 Comment: Well, further, yes.\n12:40 Comment: Any goal is a goal.\n12:41 Comment: Although, perhaps, here it seemed to someone that Jack had touched the ball with his hand.\n12:45 Comment: But the referee did not record any violations of the rules.\n12:47 Comment: From the bar Jack got his bearings.\n12:49 Comment: Well, it’s okay that it’s stomach.\n12:51 Comment: The main thing is that not with his hand, but with his hip, he somehow sent the ball sideways into the goal.\n12:56 Comment: 1-1.\n12:57 Comment: It is quite possible that a draw will suit Roma.\n12:59 Comment: This is in case Napoleon does not beat Sandoria,\n13:2 Comment: which also does not solve any tournament problems.\n13:7 Comment: This is unique.\n13:8 Comment: This is the number.\n13:9 Comment: It is also a verb form.\n13:12 Comment: This is one of the main Romance verbs.\n13:16 Comment: Be.\n13:17 Comment: That is, you are the only one.\n13:20 Comment: This is unique.\n13:21 Comment: On the T-shirts it is written, naturally, this is addressed to Francesco Totti.\n13:25 Comment: In the meantime, replacement.\n13:26 Comment: The replacement is forced.\n13:27 Comment: Well, it wasn’t enough for Roma to use three forced substitutions.\n13:30 Comment: For example, in the first half.\n13:31 Comment: And Spalletti will have no time or replacements left to release Francesco Totti.\n13:36 Comment: By the way, I don't know.\n13:37 Comment: Nobody guarantees us.\n13:38 Comment: No one guarantees us that Spalletti will replace Francesco Totti.\n13:43 Comment: Although this will, of course, be something.\n13:45 Comment: However, after the stadium openly booed the head coach of Roma,\n13:50 Comment: today before the start of the match, who knows how Spalletti will end his career at this club.\n13:56 Comment: A scandalous situation arose.\n13:57 Comment: Here he is James Palotto.\n13:59 Comment: President of Roma.\n14:0 Comment: An Italian American who lives in America and rarely comes to Rome.\n14:4 Comment: He doesn't understand what Rome is.\n14:6 Comment: He doesn't understand what Roma is.\n14:7 Comment: He does not understand what the captain of Roma, the emperor, and so on are.\n14:11 Comment: Because it is simply impossible to understand this on remote access.\n14:15 Comment: I think that, largely because of this, the situation that has been happening at the club throughout the season has arisen.\n14:22 Comment: When almost every press conference revolves and revolves around Spalletti and his relationship with Totti.\n14:29 Comment: Why did he release it for 5 minutes or one minute or not at all?\n14:32 Comment: Well, the situation with Milan is scandalous.\n14:34 Comment: When the score was 3-1, he didn't let go.\n14:37 Comment: In favor of Roma 5 minutes before the end of the game.\n14:41 Comment: The whole stadium.\n14:42 Comment: This was the last exit.\n14:43 Comment: It was supposed to be Totti's last appearance at the legendary San Siro.\n14:48 Comment: Spalletti did not release him.\n14:49 Comment: He released another player.\n14:51 Comment: And the Roma fan stand, the visiting fans, simply howled in protest.\n14:56 Comment: And the rest of the match was spent chanting Totti, Totti, Totti, goal.\n15:0 Comment: Now it’s not him, because it’s not his position.\n15:3 Comment: Naturally, a defensive player should come out.\n15:6 Comment: To the left flank.\n15:7 Comment: You still need to complete the task and take second place.\n15:12 Comment: Therefore, he is already preparing to enter the field.\n15:17 Comment: And Mario Rui's number 21 is warming up.\n15:22 Comment: Portuguese defender Roma.\n15:24 Comment: Roma is on the attack.\n15:26 Comment: Rudiger with the ball.\n15:27 Comment: Returns the ball to Ingulana.\n15:29 Comment: One more transfer.\n15:30 Comment: Back and through Facio.\n15:33 Comment: Roma is without one field player.\n15:35 Comment: Derosi motions for his partner to position himself a little to the left.\n15:41 Comment: Because Derosi is still protecting the central zone.\n15:44 Comment: Due to the absence of one field player on the field, the Roman team.\n15:48 Comment: Forward transmission.\n15:49 Comment: Salah set up the body.\n15:52 Comment: Played the ball back to Rudiger.\n15:54 Comment: I talked about Roma's performance.\n15:56 Comment: They scored 5 against Kiev.\n15:58 Comment: 3 to Juventus.\n15:59 Comment: 4 Milan.\n16:1 Comment: 4 Pescara.\n16:3 Comment: Roma's performance is fine.\n16:5 Comment: But here's the truth of the derby.\n16:6 Comment: Roma lost to Lazio.\n16:8 Comment: And she lost her points with the brilliant Atalanta.\n16:10 Comment: Which is trained by Genua's former mentor.\n16:13 Comment: Juric is a student of Atalanta's current coach.\n16:17 Comment: Gasperini.\n16:18 Comment: In which Genua was one of the first to switch to a scheme with three defenders.\n16:22 Comment: Now he is very successfully using this scheme in Atalanta.\n16:26 Comment: Gasperini.\n16:27 Comment: And as far as I know, the coach of the Russian national team.\n16:30 Comment: Head coach Stanislav Cherchesov.\n16:31 Comment: Very interested.\n16:32 Comment: He is very interested in Atalanta’s game.\n16:35 Comment: And the work of Gasperini in particular.\n16:38 Comment: Apparently.\n16:40 Comment: Well, including the quality of the performers.\n16:43 Comment: Still, this is not Chelsea or Juventus.\n16:46 Comment: So far he has played with three defenders.\n16:48 Comment: I mean Atalanta.\n16:49 Comment: Maybe in some sense Stanislav Sanych takes this as a basis.\n16:53 Comment: For some thoughts of your own.\n16:55 Comment: Regarding the construction of the Russian national team's defense.\n16:57 Comment: Defense of Gasperini.\n16:59 Comment: Former coach of Genoa.\n17:0 Comment: Well, now it’s coming out.\n17:2 Comment: Mario Rui on the field.\n17:3 Comment: Instead of the injured Emerson.\n17:6 Comment: There are practically no free places.\n17:8 Comment: Some separate chairs.\n17:9 Comment: Free at the Olympic Stadium in Rome.\n17:11 Comment: And it seems to me that this is because of the scorching sun.\n17:13 Comment: The people there have moved somewhere else.\n17:16 Comment: Regarding the Roma stadium.\n17:17 Comment: This is a separate topic.\n17:18 Comment: But today this is not the main thing.\n17:20 Comment: It seems that the project for the construction of a new stadium has been approved.\n17:23 Comment: But this is Italy.\n17:24 Comment: There if something is agreed with the authorities.\n17:27 Comment: This does not mean that everything will be done.\n17:29 Comment: And it was done quickly.\n17:32 Comment: Bye Olympic Stadium.\n17:34 Comment: Genoa with the ball.\n17:36 Comment: Number four is Ghanaian Kofi.\n17:42 Comment: And a man who played at this stadium more than once.\n17:45 Comment: As part of Lazio.\n17:46 Comment: Therefore, naturally, the Roman fans immediately whistle just in case.\n17:50 Comment: Because Loshald began his career in the Italian series in Lazio.\n17:58 Comment: But he didn’t really go on the field there.\n18:3 Comment: He really started playing in Bolonia, in Empoli and then in Genoa.\n18:8 Comment: 1-1 score.\n18:13 Comment: 19 minutes of the first half of this historic match.\n18:17 Comment: Which will end with a farewell ceremony from big football.\n18:22 Comment: The 40-year-old legendary holder of numerous records.\n18:26 Comment: Serie A and Roma Francesco Totti.\n18:29 Comment: Well, for now Genua is on the attack.\n18:31 Comment: Pass to the penalty area.\n18:33 Comment: The author of the goal was Pellegri.\n18:35 Comment: I couldn't come up with anything worthwhile here.\n18:38 Comment: Derosi passed to Dzeko.\n18:40 Comment: Who, from the position of the central striker, dropped very deep into his own half of the field.\n18:44 Comment: In such...\n18:45 Comment: As a passer.\n18:47 Comment: Now the ball has come out.\n18:49 Comment: El Sharawi returns.\n18:51 Comment: Jacko.\n18:52 Comment: Strotman.\n18:53 Comment: And here is this ball.\n18:55 Comment: Strotman.\n18:56 Comment: Dzeko is already in the striker position.\n18:58 Comment: There is no offside position.\n18:59 Comment: Come on the thirtieth Jacko!\n19:1 Comment: No. Helps out.\n19:3 Comment: Helps out.\n19:5 Comment: His Lohmann team.\n19:7 Comment: Four Italians in the Genoa squad.\n19:10 Comment: The rest are all foreigners.\n19:11 Comment: There is no offside position.\n19:12 Comment: Great pass from Kevin Strotman.\n19:15 Comment: Who unfortunately received a severe injury immediately after his arrival in Roma.\n19:20 Comment: I was treated for a very long time.\n19:21 Comment: But he returned to the team.\n19:22 Comment: And now he proves it once again.\n19:25 Comment: That this was a very correct move by the breeding service.\n19:29 Comment: So does Salah.\n19:30 Comment: Which helps Roma a lot.\n19:32 Comment: A quality footballer.\n19:33 Comment: Now he finds himself in an offside position.\n19:36 Comment: The transfer was interesting.\n19:38 Comment: When, it seems to me, the agents pulled off a cool deal.\n19:43 Comment: In an exchange with an additional payment, Salah to Quadrada.\n19:46 Comment: Fiorentina were involved.\n19:49 Comment: As a result, Quadrado ended up in Juventus.\n19:52 Comment: And Salah is in Roma.\n19:54 Comment: Well, who made money from this?\n19:56 Comment: One can only guess.\n20:0 Comment: Genoa with the ball.\n20:1 Comment: Pass into the penalty area.\n20:3 Comment: Erudy Guerre at center back.\n20:5 Comment: I secured it in the central zone.\n20:7 Comment: Manolas kicked the ball out of the penalty area.\n20:9 Comment: He is also a very well progressing football player.\n20:12 Comment: So far Roma manages to preserve it.\n20:13 Comment: Although, or rather this season, Manolas could end up in England.\n20:18 Comment: Sharavi!\n20:19 Comment: Didn't miss it.\n20:21 Comment: Moment by moment.\n20:22 Comment: We'll have a fun game.\n20:23 Comment: 100% perfect.\n20:25 Comment: There will be all sorts of entertainment until the final whistle.\n20:28 Comment: It's fun for now, but later it will be sad.\n20:31 Comment: If we remember the footage.\n20:33 Comment: Tears on eyes.\n20:35 Comment: Mainly a female audience and children, who were shown to us before the start of the broadcast.\n20:40 Comment: Well, I think that some stingy male tears will also be shed.\n20:45 Comment: About an hour and a half later.\n20:49 Comment: Roma missed two chances.\n20:51 Comment: In order to pull.\n20:52 Comment: To get ahead.\n20:54 Comment: But it seems to me that’s because of how the game is going.\n20:56 Comment: Genoa is not very concentrated.\n21:0 Comment: Yes, she managed to score a quick goal.\n21:2 Comment: But Genua's defense periodically makes mistakes.\n21:4 Comment: Therefore, I think that Roma will continue its scoring extravaganza.\n21:9 Comment: And he will distinguish today, perhaps more than once.\n21:13 Comment: However, Juventus is the champion.\n21:15 Comment: Almost 10 points ahead of Roma.\n21:17 Comment: Although if Roma wins today 87 versus 91.\n21:20 Comment: This is not such a big gap.\n21:21 Comment: But in terms of goals, Roma managed to beat Juventus.\n21:23 Comment: Significantly 87 versus 77.\n21:26 Comment: But in defense, of course, it’s not like Juventus.\n21:28 Comment: Roma played with 10 goals.\n21:31 Comment: The Turin team conceded less.\n21:35 Comment: Champion of Italy, who set an absolute Serie A record this season.\n21:39 Comment: Six championship victories in a row.\n21:42 Comment: Fight with the ball.\n21:44 Comment: Starts his team's attack.\n21:46 Comment: Immediately transfer forward.\n21:47 Comment: But, in my opinion, Genua stopped playing defense altogether.\n21:49 Comment: Now, if Strotman had missed.\n21:50 Comment: Strotman handled the ball correctly.\n21:52 Comment: And I immediately saw Salah.\n21:53 Comment: It's very noisy in the stadium.\n21:54 Comment: Therefore, players probably do not hear all the hints.\n21:59 Comment: Now the Roma players could have fallen into the defense of the Genoa team 3 in 2.\n22:6 Comment: Genoa with the ball.\n22:8 Comment: Kofi did not find any interesting continuation.\n22:12 Comment: The ball ends up on the right flank.\n22:16 Comment: Now you can make a turn.\n22:17 Comment: The ball flies much higher.\n22:19 Comment: Well, it’s hard to say whether Chesny’s ​​fighters have come to their senses.\n22:23 Comment: After he messed up at the beginning of the match by leaving his goal.\n22:28 Comment: And Roma was lucky that the ball didn’t end up in the goal.\n22:31 Comment: Roma have won 10 of their last 12 matches in all competitions.\n22:35 Comment: And he's in good shape.\n22:45 Comment: But a very important match in the derby.\n22:47 Comment: Lazio lost.\n22:48 Comment: And perhaps it was these points that made life difficult for Roma at the end of the season.\n22:54 Comment: And today the match has a sporting component, and not just a celebration of Francesco Totti.\n23:0 Comment: When we could start celebrating from the very beginning.\n23:4 Comment: But I already talked about this.\n23:6 Comment: In principle, of course, the fans had ideas to start with a victory lap.\n23:10 Comment: Do it right away.\n23:12 Comment: But the club still said with all due respect.\n23:14 Comment: Still, let's play football first.\n23:16 Comment: Let's take our glasses.\n23:17 Comment: Let's take second place.\n23:19 Comment: And then we will celebrate, honor the captain and so on.\n23:22 Comment: Well, the mood of Luciano Spalletti, especially with this action now,\n23:26 Comment: demonstrates how he still wants to finish the season in second place.\n23:35 Comment: And with a direct ticket to the Champions League.\n23:39 Comment: Well, then you can always refer to the fact that Totti was distracting.\n23:44 Comment: And this whole story with Totti bothered the team.\n23:47 Comment: And this was very important.\n23:49 Comment: And it was very important for the coach to fulfill the task of a more serious fight for the Scudetto with Juventus of Turin.\n23:56 Comment: At some point it seemed that this fight was over.\n23:59 Comment: Somewhere in the middle of the season, when Juventus went into the lead.\n24:3 Comment: But we must give Roma his due.\n24:5 Comment: She took advantage of this.\n24:7 Comment: And Juventus almost caught up.\n24:15 Comment: And now Roma lost the Olympic.\n24:20 Comment: From Lyon and dropped out of this tournament too.\n24:24 Comment: So, in fact, second place is the only thing we can be proud of.\n24:36 Comment: The Italian Cup didn't work out either.\n24:38 Comment: And again, in the derby, Roma lost to Lazio in the semifinals.\n24:42 Comment: And for the Roman fans, no matter how this coach performed, she could not win.\n24:43 Comment: And this was very important.\n24:44 Comment: But no matter how this team performs, to do this you need to know Rome a little.\n24:48 Comment: And understand this subculture of relations between Roma and Lazio fans.\n24:53 Comment: Times change.\n24:55 Comment: I remember maybe 15-20 years ago on the Rome metro.\n25:0 Comment: The entire metro was covered in very indecent writing.\n25:3 Comment: I will not say this on air with inscriptions addressed to Lazio fans.\n25:8 Comment: Because, to put it mildly, the Romans, the indigenous Romans considered Lazio.\n25:13 Comment: They were considered newcomers, who had come in large numbers, as we would say.\n25:18 Comment: Zamkadyshi, something like that.\n25:21 Comment: And such teasing was very common in Rome.\n25:25 Comment: Now the situation has changed.\n25:27 Comment: Many people living and working in the city support Lazio.\n25:32 Comment: Therefore, this division into the city team and the province of Lazio is already part of history.\n25:37 Comment: This has nothing to do with reality.\n25:40 Comment: Earns a free kick now.\n25:43 Comment: Talliventu Jenu raises his hand and dribbles the ball into play.\n25:49 Comment: But the relationship is still between the fans of the two teams.\n25:52 Comment: This is a very important part of the season.\n25:54 Comment: At the Lazio base, just as you enter the main alley that leads to the training building,\n26:4 Comment: There is a marble memorial plaque installed there by Lazio fans.\n26:11 Comment: In honor of two victories, or rather a season in which Lazio beat Roma four times.\n26:18 Comment: Twice in the Italian Championship and twice in the Cup.\n26:22 Comment: That is, you understand how important these things are, these relationships between the two clubs, victories in local matches between each other, how important they are to the team’s fans.\n26:33 Comment: Therefore, of course, for Luciano Spalletti and for his career at Roma, these are these slaps in the face from Lazio,\n26:39 Comment: coupled with what is happening around Totti, this is truly a completely unbearable situation.\n26:46 Comment: Roma lost 0-2 when Lazio were hosts.\n26:50 Comment: Won 3-2 when she was the host, but Lazio advanced.\n26:54 Comment: Plus another defeat in the championship.\n26:56 Comment: So three defeats. That's a lot for one season.\n27:1 Comment: 1-1 so far. I won’t say what’s happening in Genoa, where Samdor is playing with Napoleon.\n27:6 Comment: In order to maintain suspense.\n27:9 Comment: Perhaps the stadium knows what's going on there.\n27:12 Comment: Probably they transmit information online somehow.\n27:16 Comment: Well, since everything is quiet, then we can probably assume that the account is current.\n27:21 Comment: In both matches, Roma is satisfied; it retains second position, which gives a direct ticket to the Champions League.\n27:28 Comment: Salah with the ball. Transfer to the left. El Sharawi handles the ball.\n27:34 Comment: See if there is a continuation.\n27:37 Comment: They don't subside.\n27:39 Comment: Applause at the Olympic Stadium in Rome.\n27:41 Comment: Just as the first minutes started, they continue to wait for the release of the tenth issue.\n27:47 Comment: Salah passes back. Deiroshi looked around.\n27:50 Comment: Where are some of their rivals?\n27:53 Comment: Rui with the ball.\n27:55 Comment: Well, Roma is in a positional attack.\n27:57 Comment: Genua, Zhenyushka seems tired of putting pressure on me.\n28:0 Comment: And he does it less actively than at the beginning of the match.\n28:2 Comment: But the team's head coach, who returned to his post.\n28:6 Comment: Enrico Priziosi.\n28:8 Comment: An eccentric person.\n28:10 Comment: First, last year he suspended Yurich from work.\n28:15 Comment: Then his replacement was removed.\n28:17 Comment: Jurich returned to his post.\n28:19 Comment: And from April 10, Jurich again leads Genoa.\n28:24 Comment: Won two important matches.\n28:26 Comment: Took the most important six points.\n28:28 Comment: Which actually helped Genua maintain its registration in Serie A.\n28:32 Comment: There is no season after season.\n28:34 Comment: Usually they talk about 39-40.\n28:37 Comment: But in this number there are 40-41 points that need to be scored.\n28:41 Comment: And they guarantee registration in the top division in a tournament of 20 teams.\n28:45 Comment: This time, 36 points was enough to secure a place in Serie A next year.\n28:55 Comment: The Croutons and Empulis, in case you were wondering, are fighting for survival.\n29:0 Comment: Palermo and Pescara Serie A say goodbye.\n29:4 Comment: But here you can bring things to a goal.\n29:6 Comment: Sharavi crosses.\n29:9 Comment: And this is not a pass to the goalkeeper, of course, but a rebound.\n29:19 Comment: In Serie B, the season is not really over yet.\n29:23 Comment: There are playoffs going on.\n29:26 Comment: And choose what you like best.\n29:28 Comment: Benivento Perruggio, Carpi Frosinone.\n29:32 Comment: Here is one of these four.\n29:36 Comment: It will hit according to the English principle.\n29:38 Comment: They started playing in the Italian Serie B.\n29:42 Comment: With the team's ability to get into Serie A from eighth place.\n29:47 Comment: Dzeko passed to Anengulan.\n29:49 Comment: Anengulan was a little late for this program.\n29:52 Comment: Verona returned to Serie A.\n29:54 Comment: The team is famous, even becoming the champion of Italy.\n29:58 Comment: Once upon a time, if you remember, there was a player, well, I’m primarily addressing fans with experience, in Denmark there was such a striker.\n30:6 Comment: Beautiful first name and double surname Larsen Preben Elkjaer.\n30:11 Comment: Once upon a time he played for Verona and Verona became the national champion.\n30:15 Comment: Well, the team with the abbreviation SPAL, which has nothing to do with SPALETI, came out of first place in Serie A.\n30:26 Comment: 30 minutes played in the historic match. 1-1.\n30:30 Comment: And somehow the game calmed down after the first place.\n30:32 Comment: And somehow the game calmed down after first place in Serie A.\n30:37 Comment: And the stadium, it seems to me, is a little tired.\n30:39 Comment: I was exhausted in the sun after 30 minutes of very active life.\n30:44 Comment: I took a short break because I still need strength.\n30:49 Comment: The evening will drag on today in Rome with football.\n30:52 Comment: For a minimum of 40 minutes.\n30:54 Comment: But nothing, no information anywhere.\n30:56 Comment: Even we, the broadcasting company that has the rights to broadcast this championship, in general, usually keep secrets with us for all sorts of purposes.\n31:2 Comment: In general, we usually keep secrets of all sorts of goals.\n31:3 Comment: The secrets of all sorts of goals are shared.\n31:5 Comment: There, for example, is the opening ceremony of the World and European Championships.\n31:11 Comment: Everything that happens before the finals of the Champions League of the Europa League.\n31:15 Comment: There is a scenario plan that they send us.\n31:17 Comment: And the commentator is comfortable telling you what's going on.\n31:20 Comment: Because everything happens according to the script.\n31:22 Comment: Here nothing is known at all.\n31:24 Comment: Besides the fact that Palotov must present some kind of badge.\n31:29 Comment: Everything else is kept secret.\n31:31 Comment: Only the timing is known.\n31:32 Comment: The duration of the ceremony is 40 minutes.\n31:34 Comment: 10 minutes after the final whistle.\n31:37 Comment: This is how it should be.\n31:39 Comment: Savak is still falling.\n31:41 Comment: I rolled towards the head over heels on the lawn.\n31:45 Comment: Referee Tagyavenko did not blow the whistle.\n31:47 Comment: And the stadium whistles, remembering football and the fact that victory guarantees Roma a direct ticket to the Champions League.\n31:57 Comment: Well, and, accordingly, money.\n31:59 Comment: Because, of course, investors are Americans.\n32:2 Comment: They came with good capital.\n32:5 Comment: But no one canceled the money from the Champions League.\n32:8 Comment: Serie A is far from the English Premier League.\n32:11 Comment: The clubs' earnings figures were recently released.\n32:15 Comment: The team that left the English championship from last place and was relegated to the championship earned more than the winner of the Champions League.\n32:23 Comment: In Series A, of course, such money was unheard of.\n32:27 Comment: Therefore, participation in the Champions League, a direct ticket and a guaranteed budget.\n32:31 Comment: Any team, be it Juventus or Roma, whose financial situation is stable, needs income from participation in this tournament.\n32:41 Comment: The ball is all ball.\n32:43 Comment: Strotman.\n32:45 Comment: The one-touch pass to Nendulan did not go through.\n32:47 Comment: Nendulan falls out a little.\n32:49 Comment: On the one hand, perhaps this is due to the fact that the Genoa players are closely acting against him.\n32:55 Comment: And the team coach, Yuryevich, also understands very well who is the leader in this team.\n32:59 Comment: I think something is going on.\n33:1 Comment: There we have a spare comedy.\n33:3 Comment: The stadium applauded.\n33:7 Comment: Maybe Totti stood up simply, so to speak, to show the public that he was here, that he was with them.\n33:13 Comment: But for now it's in stock.\n33:16 Comment: Jacko.\n33:26 Comment: Wall with Strotman.\n33:27 Comment: El Sharawi.\n33:29 Comment: Still resisting.\n33:32 Comment: Are there games?\n33:34 Comment: Yes. The flag is raised.\n33:36 Comment: And Dzeko, it seems to me, saw out of the corner of his eye that he was offside.\n33:38 Comment: Therefore, he did not strike with a very accentuated turn.\n33:41 Comment: Yes exactly. He stood up, which is why he applauded the stadium.\n33:44 Comment: The scout guessed it.\n33:50 Comment: Together with you.\n33:51 Comment: 34th minute.\n33:52 Comment: 1-1 Roma Genoa Dzeko.\n33:54 Comment: We are waiting for the 30th goal from Dzeko.\n33:56 Comment: Cool forward.\n33:57 Comment: There are no questions.\n33:59 Comment: And now I don’t want to talk about the topic.\n34:4 Comment: But if we were coaches with you, who would we appoint?\n34:8 Comment: Dzeko or Totti?\n34:9 Comment: There are various solutions.\n34:12 Comment: There are opportunities for the benefit of the team and the player.\n34:20 Comment: And most importantly, disrespect for talent, for achievements, for regalia, for a person’s status.\n34:28 Comment: Somehow, adhere to a different logic when making certain decisions.\n34:36 Comment: Hey, Charal, he enters the penalty area with the ball.\n34:38 Comment: Hit.\n34:39 Comment: I recently read a very interesting statement about another legendary number 10 of modern Italian football.\n34:47 Comment: If you don't go back in time.\n34:50 Comment: When others are brilliant.\n34:56 Comment: Number tens Gigi Riva, Matsolo and so on played in Italian football.\n35:7 Comment: And modern football is Baggio, Del Piero, Totti.\n35:11 Comment: These are probably the three top tens of Italian football.\n35:14 Comment: Of which, it is curious that the only one who is not a world champion, however, is ranked higher.\n35:21 Comment: Probably, so to speak, in understanding.\n35:24 Comment: In understanding world football in terms of significance and contribution.\n35:29 Comment: Paradoxically, quite a thing.\n35:31 Comment: Than Totti and Del Piero.\n35:33 Comment: So here it is.\n35:39 Comment: Totti received very little playing time.\n35:42 Comment: What did I want to say?\n35:44 Comment: About Carlo Ancelotti's statement.\n35:46 Comment: Regarding Baggio.\n35:49 Comment: Not an accurate transfer.\n35:50 Comment: Now forward.\n35:51 Comment: When Baggio had an option.\n35:52 Comment: He was already old too.\n35:53 Comment: After a lot of injuries and everything.\n35:58 Comment: There was an option with Parma, which was fine then.\n36:0 Comment: She was coached by Ancelotti.\n36:1 Comment: And Ancelotti Baggio didn’t take it.\n36:3 Comment: Based on how to approximately use it.\n36:5 Comment: And what, well, why can’t an injured veteran last 90 minutes every match.\n36:10 Comment: Why do I need a spare?\n36:12 Comment: And Baggio didn’t take it.\n36:13 Comment: And now, years later.\n36:15 Comment: Again, a strange decision made by football player Dzhenu.\n36:18 Comment: The bag flies past the goal.\n36:19 Comment: Years later, Ancelotti confessed.\n36:21 Comment: If only I had been more experienced back then.\n36:22 Comment: Of course I would take Baggio.\n36:24 Comment: Because now already.\n36:25 Comment: So to speak from the height of the past years.\n36:27 Comment: I understand that such talents cannot be wasted.\n36:31 Comment: And you need to be grateful.\n36:35 Comment: To the coach.\n36:36 Comment: Because you have happiness.\n36:37 Comment: Working with such a football player.\n36:39 Comment: Such talent.\n36:40 Comment: As in the case of Ancelotti Baggio.\n36:42 Comment: Which he decided not to work with.\n36:44 Comment: And how in the case of Francesco Totti.\n36:47 Comment: 37 minutes of a special match.\n36:50 Comment: And so.\n36:51 Comment: 1-1.\n36:52 Comment: Nothing special happens on the field.\n36:58 Comment: Precisely because of what you and I understand.\n37:1 Comment: Without hearing any announcements around the stadium.\n37:4 Comment: Apparently nothing like that happens in Gena.\n37:6 Comment: And in the Sandorio-Napoli match.\n37:8 Comment: Which would force Roma to turn on other speeds.\n37:11 Comment: We would feel it right away.\n37:16 Comment: I'm already thinking.\n37:17 Comment: If something like that happened.\n37:19 Comment: Not good for Roma.\n37:21 Comment: In the match Sandorio-Napoli.\n37:23 Comment: If Napoli had scored.\n37:25 Comment: In Sandorio-Napoli, Roma would probably get involved in the game.\n37:28 Comment: Or maybe they don’t announce it.\n37:29 Comment: Or maybe they will announce it.\n37:30 Comment: But I won't tell you anything.\n37:32 Comment: As we have agreed.\n37:33 Comment: Let the intrigue continue until the second half.\n37:36 Comment: 1-1.\n37:37 Comment: Counting bye.\n37:40 Comment: We will probably return to the match in Naples.\n37:42 Comment: If you and I need it.\n37:44 Comment: Well, somewhere around 15 minutes.\n37:45 Comment: Until the final whistle.\n37:47 Comment: To really understand what is happening.\n37:49 Comment: Whether Roma gets into the Champions League directly with this score or not.\n37:52 Comment: Some trainers as far as I know.\n37:55 Comment: They deliberately do not inform their team.\n37:57 Comment: And they seem to protect them from information.\n37:59 Comment: And they ask not to even announce it around the stadium.\n38:1 Comment: In order not to influence the team with knowledge about what is happening in a parallel match.\n38:9 Comment: This helps some people.\n38:10 Comment: It bothers someone.\n38:11 Comment: But it’s difficult for me to judge that from Moscow.\n38:13 Comment: Is Rome aware of what is happening now?\n38:15 Comment: In a match with Andori Jen.\n38:17 Comment: Pass forward to Manolas.\n38:19 Comment: Looks like there's no breaking the rules.\n38:21 Comment: Played in this situation.\n38:23 Comment: Again Lucianus Paliti is unhappy.\n38:25 Comment: The oversight of their defenders.\n38:27 Comment: Which he may see for the last time.\n38:29 Comment: But nevertheless, he continues to actively participate in the hint.\n38:31 Comment: Head coach of Roma.\n38:33 Comment: Expresses dissatisfaction with the way things are now.\n38:35 Comment: In this match.\n38:37 Comment: And this is not only for Roma.\n38:39 Comment: But also for everyone.\n38:41 Comment: And for everyone.\n38:43 Comment: Expresses dissatisfaction with the way things are now.\n38:45 Comment: Swede Hilmark.\n38:47 Comment: They let us in to the gate.\n38:49 Comment: Another try from Genoa.\n38:51 Comment: Move to someone else's half of the field.\n38:53 Comment: Fazio intercepted the ball.\n38:55 Comment: Salah shows give me a long one.\n38:57 Comment: But instead there was a short pass to Dzeko.\n38:59 Comment: They played around with Strotman.\n39:1 Comment: Strotman has a very decent left hand.\n39:3 Comment: Next is El Sharawi.\n39:5 Comment: Next is Jacko.\n39:7 Comment: I think Manchester City made a big mistake.\n39:9 Comment: Parting with Roma.\n39:11 Comment: And Roma, of course, made a very good acquisition.\n39:13 Comment: In the person of this Bosnian.\n39:15 Comment: Rui.\n39:17 Comment: Strotman.\n39:19 Comment: Nain Gulan.\n39:21 Comment: Strotman.\n39:23 Comment: Strotman is waiting.\n39:25 Comment: Opening.\n39:27 Comment: Now Strotman got the ball.\n39:29 Comment: Accidentally.\n39:31 Comment: Penalty.\n39:33 Comment: Tagliavento.\n39:35 Comment: Give it a penalty.\n39:37 Comment: I didn't install it.\n39:39 Comment: Penalty.\n39:41 Comment: I'm not sure that I would have beaten Dzeko.\n39:43 Comment: Under the 30th goal.\n39:45 Comment: Now it's too important to just score.\n39:47 Comment: Or maybe it was offside.\n39:49 Comment: But it seems to me that a violation still took place.\n39:51 Comment: Although there are many more arbitrators.\n39:53 Comment: Than commentators now.\n39:55 Comment: Although if you count all the commentators.\n39:57 Comment: Who works this match all over the world.\n39:59 Comment: Of course we have more.\n40:1 Comment: But the main decision was made.\n40:3 Comment: The side judge and the one behind the goal.\n40:5 Comment: But overall I think it’s a foul.\n40:7 Comment: Unless it's out of the game.\n40:9 Comment: The referee raised it.\n40:11 Comment: Due to endless repetitions, we do not understand what exactly the judge showed.\n40:15 Comment: But the episode is over.\n40:17 Comment: Another moment for Dzeko.\n40:19 Comment: A slight blow to the Lamanna goalkeeper.\n40:21 Comment: And Puchin has a moment.\n40:23 Comment: 40 minutes played in the first half.\n40:25 Comment: The last match of the season for Roma.\n40:27 Comment: And the last match in the career of football player Francesco Totti for now.\n40:29 Comment: In stock.\n40:31

He will probably wipe the dust off these golden axes and his other awards.\n13:17 Comment: World champion gold medal first.\n13:47 Comment: And so I didn’t come to play the fool, but to fight for my results, for my prestige. I think that if Roma score the second, especially if Totti scores or is involved in the creation of the goal, Genoa will not go all out there and dig for an equalizer.\n14:8 Comment: While the Genoese team has the ball, they don’t even try to be so active in attack; something happened there in the first half.\n14:16 Comment: But already on the attack.\n14:17 Comment: In this half, Roma Totti was ahead of the ball almost all the time. Yes, there are rivals on the field, no one will make way.\n14:25 Comment: And Genua goes forward on horseback and receives the ball on the left flank. Rüdiger is against him.\n14:37 Comment: And a shot on goal! Surf Ninkovich lands a good blow.\n14:44 Comment: It hit pretty well.\n14:46 Comment: And Ninkovich believes that he cannot win.\n14:47 Comment: But Fabianski touched the ball.

Number 99.\n15:2 Comment: Footballer 22-year-old Genua, who has been playing in Italy for the second year, transferred from Partisan.\n15:7 Comment: Very talented, very interesting attacking midfielder.\n15:12 Comment: Well, a little about football.\n15:14 Comment: Nain Gulan. Pass forward.\n15:17 Comment: But the attack line didn’t reach the ball.\n15:20 Comment: The situation is very difficult now.\n15:22 Comment: Put yourself in the shoes of the Roma players who are on the field.\n15:27 Comment: What to do now? To play football? Just get the ball there, play, try to score a goal.\n15:31 Comment: Still fulfilling the tournament task, Jack fell under a penalty for Francesco Totti.\n15:37 Comment: But they didn’t give a penalty.

We are watching today.\n16:15 Comment: Even though this is Rome.\n16:17 Comment: That this is the place where the famous phrase “Bread and Circuses” was uttered.\n16:25 Comment: And what a spectacle it is.\n16:27 Comment: The most important spectacle of the 20th and 21st centuries. Football.\n16:37 Comment: A Genua player apparently hit the post there.\n16:43 Comment: And we are already looking at the cut.\n16:45 Comment: The directors prepared for us.\n16:47 Comment: 40 and a half years old.\n16:50 Comment: Francesco Totti.\n16:53 Comment: And in a game with full resistance.\n16:56 Comment: Where do you get injured?\n16:57 Comment: And the director plays us very well with this plan.\n16:59 Comment: This is not a friendly match.\n17:2 Comment: Where everyone makes way and smiles.\n17:5 Comment: And they see off the star character who beat you.\n17:9 Comment: Some smiles and welcoming words.\n17:12 Comment: Here they beat you on your legs.\n17:13 Comment: Here Emerson was injured.\n17:14 Comment: And serious in the first half.\n17:17 Comment: Roma needs to win.\n17:17 Comment: For now it is outside the main Champions League tournament.\n17:20 Comment: Of course, Roma will most likely qualify.\n17:23 Comment: But they finished the season in third place, without winning in the last round, losing the fight for second place to Naples.\n17:30 Comment: It certainly won't be the best.\n17:33 Comment: Not the best point in Francesco Totti's career.\n17:40 Comment: Probably, the lack of big European titles is not with the national team, but with the club,\n17:47 Comment: for Totti to become an even more serious and bigger player.\n17:51 Comment: And not only through the mouth of Maradona to be called the best of those football players that Maradona has seen.\n17:57 Comment: Because after all, in order to be a world-class star, such as, for example, Zidane,\n18:3 Comment: This requires titles not only at the national team level, but Totti is still a world champion.\n18:9 Comment: He has this title.\n18:10 Comment: The most important thing in the career of any football player who claims to be the best of the best.\n18:14 Comment: But unfortunately...\n18:17 Comment: Totti, fortunately from the fans' point of view, spent his entire career at one club.\n18:22 Comment: But Roma is not the team with which it was possible, for example, to win the Champions League.\n18:27 Comment: That's why Totti doesn't have many club trophies.\n18:30 Comment: He's just... It's amazing to even say that.\n18:32 Comment: He became the champion of Italy only once.\n18:36 Comment: Compare with other outstanding football players.\n18:43 Comment: Once during the 2001 season Francesco Totti...\n18:47 Comment: Became champion of Italy.\n18:48 Comment: Just two cups and two super cups.\n18:55 Comment: Yesterday, summing up the Barcelona-Alavesa match, already during the award ceremony, I simply said a rumor and was surprised myself.\n19:4 Comment: Luis Enrique, as a coach, by the way, coached Roma, and, by the way, left Roma because of Totti,\n19:9 Comment: because Totti told everyone that we don’t need one like that.\n19:12 Comment: For some personal reasons.\n19:14 Comment: Luis Enrique won 9 titles with Barcelona.\n19:17 Comment: As a coach for three years.\n19:18 Comment: And Francesco has only 5 titles in 25 years in his 25-year football career.\n19:25 Comment: And precisely because he did not win the Champions Cup, for example, yes, or the Uefa Cup at least.\n19:31 Comment: If he had won something with the club, I think he would have been an even bigger figure in the eyes of fans throughout Europe.\n19:38 Comment: Because they still follow their teams in national championships.\n19:42 Comment: And other teams and other stars are watched, well, or once every 4 years at the championship.\n19:47 Comment: And peace, yes, they remembered Totti.\n19:49 Comment: And not only in 2006, but also in 2002, when there was a very controversial red card and deletion.\n19:58 Comment: This is the new sports director of Roma sitting there, worried about something unknown.\n20:3 Comment: Oh, well, yes, because he is in charge of the money that Roma will earn or not earn from directly qualifying for the Champions League.\n20:12 Comment: That's why he worries.\n20:15 Comment: SUBSCRIBE!\n20:16 Comment: It's outside the main tournament.\n20:19 Comment: There are no chances yet, Totti is in the game.\n20:21 Comment: But he and his team still have 25 minutes to excel.\n20:26 Comment: It is clear that both the broadcast director and the cameramen are all focused on one thing.\n20:31 Comment: The characters are on the same number, on the 10th number of Roma.\n20:34 Comment: Fazio with the ball, pass to the left.\n20:36 Comment: The stadium has now exhaled a little, come, took a short break in order to explode at some of the most necessary, most important moments of this game.\n20:46 Comment: It is very symbolic that Totti now came out under the right podium.\n20:51 Comment: This is the South Stand.\n20:52 Comment: Kurva Sud, that's what they call her.\n20:54 Comment: In Italian, the tribune of Roma fans, who always sat there until recently, until this story of a very complex relationship with law enforcement agencies arose,\n21:7 Comment: who erected protective barriers there.\n21:11 Comment: And fans of both clubs left the stadium in protest.\n21:13 Comment: But now the point is not that, but the fact that...\n21:15 Comment: This year Totti came out under the right stand.\n21:15 Comment: It is very symbolic that Totti now came out under the right podium.\n21:15 Comment: This is the South Stand.\n21:16 Comment: This is the most important moment in my career for Roma.\n21:17 Comment: Shot from Rothman wide of the goal.\n21:19 Comment: Totti leads the team's most ardent fans and him personally under the podium.\n21:27 Comment: One of my most vivid memories of Totti, the footballer, is the Rome derby.\n21:32 Comment: Now I can’t say exactly how many years ago it was.\n21:35 Comment: This is a match where there was unrest before the game.\n21:39 Comment: And a police car, completely by accident, there was no malicious intent there,\n21:44 Comment: a police car by accident...\n21:46 Comment: Vdavki hit and killed a Roma fan while reversing.\n21:52 Comment: And Roma fans, after the start of the derby, at the beginning of the game, demanded that the match be stopped, promising riots.\n22:0 Comment: Three fans, just like that, during the game, during the television broadcast,\n22:3 Comment: They climbed over the fence and went straight out onto the football field.\n22:7 Comment: They approached me personally, not to the judge, not to the coach, not to anyone.\n22:11 Comment: They approached Francesc Totti personally.\n22:13 Comment: They had a conversation.\n22:14 Comment: After that, Totti came over.\n22:15 Comment: To Captain Latso.\n22:17 Comment: And they led the team off the field.\n22:18 Comment: This is possible only, in my opinion, in Italy, only in Rome.\n22:21 Comment: Well, maybe in some other cities it can be too.\n22:24 Comment: But I have never seen anything else like it.\n22:26 Comment: This is Totti and his relationship with the stands, with the fans.\n22:30 Comment: So that you understand how valuable this fact is now that Roma is attacking on the right side.\n22:35 Comment: And if a goal happens, if Totti manages to score, he will have the shortest path with you to the fans.\n22:41 Comment: But there are no moments yet.\n22:42 Comment: The 68th minute is ticking.\n22:44 Comment: Roma is looking for approaches to the goal.\n22:45 Comment: Totti. Long pass.\n22:47 Comment: Casting Forward!\n22:49 Comment: And the captain almost scored an assist.\n22:52 Comment: El Sharrari won the fight.\n22:54 Comment: Punched.\n22:55 Comment: He gives the captain a thumbs up.\n22:58 Comment: This is the diagonal.\n23:0 Comment: Who will be 40 years old in the game?\n23:5 Comment: And he pulls it out.\n23:6 Comment: Goalkeeper Geno Lomano literally pulls the ball out from under the crossbar.\n23:11 Comment: Perotti is an attack substitution.\n23:14 Comment: From Luciano Spalletti.\n23:16 Comment: Instead of El Sharrari, the fresher Perotti comes out.\n23:19 Comment: Played many matches this season.\n23:22 Comment: At some point, he was the main and first choice of Luciano Spalletti as a striker.\n23:31 Comment: But then the choice was made in favor of Dzeko.\n23:37 Comment: And Dzeko fully justified this choice.\n23:39 Comment: Replacement and in the composition of Geno.\n23:41 Comment: And Jeno is included.\n23:44 Comment: Pellegri, who scored a goal, is seen off with a whistle.\n23:48 Comment: And Nchan will take the field for the Genoese team.\n23:55 Comment: Football player from France.\n24:0 Comment: Today is the second season in the Italian Serie A.\n24:4 Comment: Well, in the meantime, Totti serves from the corner flag to hit Strotman.\n24:11 Comment: But the ball did not reach Strotman.\n24:13 Comment: Nain gol Lan.\n24:15 Comment: But this is not a discount. That's right, an attack towards Ruedeger.\n24:18 Comment: And he attacks Lomana incorrectly.\n24:30 Comment: We need to put the ball in play again.\n24:32 Comment: 70th minute.\n24:33 Comment: So far,

Comment: Great!\n27:48 Comment: Manolas, the central defender, found himself in the penalty area.\n27:51 Comment: He comes out with the ball.\n27:52 Comment: Somewhat surprised that he would have to

Totti.\n28:6 Comment: Strotman throws the ball to Dzeko.\n28:8 Comment: Jacko!\n28:9 Comment: Pass to an empty goal.\n28:11 Comment: Derosi.\n28:12 Comment: 2-1.\n28:12 Comment: Derosi scores this

there is still a game here.\n28:37 Comment: They scored theirs.\n28:39 Comment: Well, the captain, like a veteran, was the last one to run up here.\n28:42 Comment: Well, so as not to be crushed, he jumped on top of his comrades.\n28:46 Comment: Congratulations to them for scoring an important goal.\n28:49 Comment: Well, Jack gave the assist.\n28:52 Comment: And the fact that Barbara Rossa, a red beard, who was also not always Luciano Spalletti’s favorite football player,\n29:1 Comment: who also did not always receive playing time and periodically sat in the reserves for some tactical reasons.\n29:8 Comment: Perhaps he is the one who scores the winning goal.\n29:11 Comment: Roma's last goal under Luciano Spalletti.\n29:14 Comment: Although, maybe there will still be goals.\n29:15 Comment: Let's see.\n29:16 Comment: Maybe a pinach.\n29:16 Comment: And there will be a Preslovut from which Totti will score.\n29:20 Comment: Perhaps the same shot he scored against Australia.\n29:23

occasion.\n31:19 Comment: And first of all, when asked by journalists, what next with Totti, he said, let him go to the sea as soon as possible.\n31:26 Comment: Right here tomorrow, Monday.\n31:29 Comment: That is, the question was actually open until the last moment.\n31:33 Comment: Will it be with Totti today, will he finish his football career in Roma today?\n31:39 Comment: In Roma, apparently, yes.\n31:40 Comment: But there was talk that some Italian club wanted to sign him.\n31:45 Comment: Not named.\n31:46 Comment: Club.\n31:47 Comment: After this, such a strange story arose.\n31:50 Comment: Spalletti leaves.\n31:51 Comment: And if there is another coach, maybe Totti will still remain.\n31:55 Comment: But under the new sporting director, I think that Totti would not have had much chance of extending his contract.\n32:4 Comment: This is a very difficult moment.\n32:6 Comment: Deciding when to retire.\n32:8 Comment: Totti went through a very difficult moment.\n32:11 Comment: There were many difficult moments in his career, which are ambiguous for many.\n32:16 Comment: I know.\n32:16 Comment: The relations of some of my very respected colleagues.\n32:19 Comment: Francesco Totti, who remembers how he spat in the face of his opponent at the World Cup.\n32:25 Comment: However, he does not remember why he spat.\n32:28 Comment: And what happened in that match in general.\n32:30 Comment: He remembers being sent off for simulation, which was not the case in the Italy-South Korea match at the 2002 World Cup.\n32:37 Comment: But they don’t remember or don’t know that this man, Francesco Totti,\n32:44 Comment: was shot down.\n32:46 Comment: He was brought down in the penalty area.\n32:48 Comment: And this has been proven by numerous video replays and verdicts of a wide variety of arbitrators and judges.\n32:55 Comment: And the referee of that meeting, Beron Moreno, an Ecuadorian, a few years after the end of that World Cup in Korea,\n33:3 Comment: was detained at the border of the United States of America with several kilograms of heroin and received a long prison sentence.\n33:14 Comment: And others remember.\n33:16 Comment: How in 2006, in February, Totti suffered a broken leg in a match with Empel, when the opposing midfielder almost ruined his career with a brutal tackle from behind and completely put an end to his career.\n33:33 Comment: It was February. The World Championships began in June.\n33:37 Comment: Penalty serve now.\n33:38 Comment: Oh, just like that!\n33:39 Comment: It turns out we are also in football.\n33:41 Comment: We are not seeing Totti off yet.\n33:43 Comment: Here the score becomes 2-2.\n33:45 Comment: Are they joking?\n33:46 Comment: These Genoese.\n33:48 Comment: This is the first team that arose at all.\n33:51 Comment: Football began with it in Italy.\n33:53 Comment: This is a football and cricket club.\n33:56 Comment: This is the name of this team.\n33:58 Comment: Football and cricket club.\n34:2 Comment: Francesco Totti intervenes in the farewell match with a serve like this and a goal like this.\n34:8 Comment: 2-2.\n34:8 Comment: I promised you at the very beginning of the broadcast that this would be a special game.\n34:12 Comment: 2-2 score.\n34:16 Comment: Uazovich like this.\n34:19 Comment: What can you do?\n34:20 Comment: 2-2.\n34:22 Comment: This means that Totti still has a chance to score the decisive goal for his team and still take them to second place.\n34:32 Comment: Typical Italian gesture.\n34:34 Comment: What are they doing?\n34:35 Comment: What's happening?\n34:37 Comment: Without words.\n34:38 Comment: Just with this gesture.\n34:39 Comment: A Roma fan asks.\n34:42 Comment: But there are still 10+ minutes left to win this match on Jack's side.\n34:46 Comment: To

football.\n34:54 Comment: Now the main thing is whether Roma will qualify for the Champions League.\n34:57 Comment: Jenna evened the score.\n35:1 Comment: Well done to Yurich's team.\n35:2 Comment: Jurich, I think, has earned the right to continue working with the team for the next season completely unconditionally, without further ado or reasoning.\n35:11 Comment: Well, now not about that.\n35:12 Comment: Now about who will go to the Champions League from Italy.\n35:16 Comment: On a straight line.\n35:17 Comment: Lucian Spaliti is almost on the field.\n35:19 Comment: He shows with his hands where and how to make a tackle on Daniel Desrosy.\n35:23 Comment: He hears the coach.\n35:25 Comment: Performs this tackle.\n35:26 Comment: 80 minutes played.\n35:28 Comment: There are still

will also be remembered.\n35:41 Comment: About how and how this amazing career ended.\n35:46 Comment: Time!\n35:48 Comment: 10 minutes!\n35:49 Comment: There are practically no such people in sports.\n35:51 Comment: Yes, Paulo Maldini.\n35:52 Comment: Yes, some Juventus players are close to being similar.\n35:57 Comment: But still the same Buffon.\n35:59 Comment: Yes, they are absolutely brilliant.\n36:0 Comment: They are great.\n36:1 Comment: They played in the 2nd division with their team when Juventus went to Serie B.\n36:5 Comment: Well, for loyalty to the club, of course, Totti probably can’t be compared with anyone.\n36:13 Comment: Moreover, unlike Maldini,\n36:16 Comment: he had one that...\n36:16 Comment: There was a real rivalry with Lazio.\n36:18 Comment: It is the fans of Milan and Inter who have a rivalry.\n36:22 Comment: They present something to each other, but they are not football players.\n36:26 Comment: Milan and Inter are a big gang.\n36:28 Comment: The players of the two teams are friends with each other.\n36:30 Comment: They have a common business, common affairs, and so on.\n36:32 Comment: One-on-one exit.\n36:33 Comment: Genua can now finally decide on Roma.\n36:36 Comment: Tickets to the Champions League.\n36:37 Comment: The bar helps Roma out.\n36:39 Comment: But he doesn't want to score.\n36:41 Comment: He realized that he might not leave Rome.\n36:43 Comment: You can’t get to Genua, you can’t fly.\n36:45 Comment: As you saw, he was simply confused.\n36:46 Comment: He was afraid to shoot on goal at 60 thousand.\n36:51 Comment: This is just some kind of fantasy.\n36:55 Comment: Miguel Viloso, seeing the empty goal, did not shoot at it.\n37:0 Comment: I just didn’t shoot at them, because then Roma 2 needs to score to qualify for the Champions League.\n37:11 Comment: Something incredible is happening.\n37:13 Comment: In the last match.\n37:14 Comment: Francesco Totti.\n37:15 Comment: He passes forward to Ingalana.\n37:17
