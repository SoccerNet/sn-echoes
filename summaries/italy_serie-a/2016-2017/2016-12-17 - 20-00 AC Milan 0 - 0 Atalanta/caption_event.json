    "summary": "In a highly anticipated match at the legendary San Siro Stadium, AC Milan locked horns with Atalanta in a fiercely contested fixture. Despite the excitement and skills on display, the match saw no goals and ended in a 0-0 stalemate. The game, bursting with energy from the first whistle to the last, was marked by numerous fouls, missed opportunities, and resolute defending from both sides.\n\n### First Half:\n\nThe game kicked off on a cool evening, with AC Milan taking the initiative as the home side. Within the first minute, an early throw-in for Atalanta indicated a quick start. However, the initial minutes saw the ball frequently going out of play, showcasing the defensive resolve and high pressure both teams were in right from the start. \n\nAtalanta showcased their intent as early as the 3rd minute when they registered a shot off target. The ball soon went out of play, and AC Milan capitalized on the pause to regain their shape. The ensuing minutes were marked by a series of fouls, throw-ins, and indirect free-kicks, reflecting the high-tempo nature of the match and the tactical battles waged in midfield. \n\nAround the 7-minute mark, AC Milan managed their first shot off target from a direct free-kick, signaling their attacking promise. Atalanta responded with high pressing, consistently fouling AC Milan's players to disrupt the home team’s rhythm. Andrea Conti notably escaped with just a warning after a slide tackle in the 11th minute, and moments later, Alejandro Gomez tried a solo run but found himself blocked by a resolute AC Milan defense. \n\nBy the 13th minute, AC Milan got their first corner; Luca Antonelli’s cross attempted to stir trouble in the box but was cleared away. The home side’s attacking impetus was curtailed as they were caught offside soon after. As Atalanta weathered this storm, they themselves struggled with the accuracy on their crosses and passes, leading to more throw-ins and indirect free-kicks.\n\nBoth teams exhibited their defensive tenacity around the 20-minute mark. Atalanta registered a shot on target, forcing Gianluigi Donnarumma into an intervention. AC Milan, keen to settle into their rhythm, saw multiple fouls committed against them, resulting in several free-kicks. AC Milan's Suso floated balls into Atalanta’s box, but the defense held firm.
