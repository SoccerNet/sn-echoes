    "summary": "AC Milan and Lazio clashed at the legendary San Siro Stadium for what promised to be a thrilling Serie A encounter. The anticipation was palpable as the referee's whistle marked the kick-off at precisely 00:02, with AC Milan taking the initiative. Within the first minute of play, a brief interruption saw the ball go out of play, resulting in an AC Milan throw-in at 01:29. Despite this brief hiatus, the tempo quickly resumed, only to witness Lazio being caught offside at 01:49.\n\nAC Milan capitalized on this by launching an indirect free-kick, but Lazio countered swiftly with their first shot on target by 02:22. Gianluigi Donnarumma, Milan's stalwart between the sticks, was tested early in the game. The ensuing minutes saw a series of throw-ins and ball clearances, with both teams fiercely battling for possession. It was a testament to the defensive discipline on display from both sides, as neither team could hold onto the ball for extended periods.\n\nBy 11:01, Lazio managed to fire another shot on target, forcing Donnarumma into a stunning save. Milinkovic-Savic’s header from around the penalty spot seemed destined for the bottom corner, but Donnarumma's quick reflexes kept the scoreline unchanged. This sequence earned Lazio a corner, though it was wasted as Cataldi’s delivery was overhit and failed to connect with his teammates.\n\nAC Milan slowly began to find their rhythm. Around the 13th minute, Niang weaved his way past several Lazio defenders and took a shot from the edge of the box, but Strakosha in the Lazio goal was equal to the challenge. Bastos from Lazio had a brief injury scare, showing painful gestures around the 16th minute. This halt allowed Milan to reset, as Bastos seemed able to continue playing after some medical attention.\n\nM’Baye Niang remained a constant threat on the Milan frontline. He delivered a dangerous cross into the box at 17:38, which was intercepted, preventing any immediate danger to the Lazio goal. As the clock approached the 23rd minute, a handball by Lazio’s Basta, following his failed attempt to control, resulted in an indirect free-kick for Milan. Montolivo stepped up for the free-kick but it was effectively cleared by Lazio’s defense, leading to a corner kick. Despite Suso's best efforts from the corner, the defense stood firm once more.\n\nThe breakthrough eventually came for AC Milan in the 36th minute. Carlos Bacca latched onto a precise through ball from Juraj Kucka, unleashing a powerful shot from the edge of the area that nestled into the bottom left corner of Strakosha's goal. The San Siro erupted with joy as Milan secured a 1-0 lead, a demonstrative strike that underscored Bacca's lethal finishing ability.\n\nHowever, Milan was not finished, as just two minutes after the restart, they nearly doubled their lead. Bonaventura received a pass and found space for a shot, but Strakosha was again up to the task, making a crucial save. The closing moments of the first half saw more attempts from Milan, pressing their advantage. Bonaventura continued to be a central figure, taking a shot from 25 meters that required Strakosha to make another stop as the half ended.\n\nThe second half saw Lazio making tactical changes with two substitutions: Bastos made way for Balde Keita and Felipe Anderson replaced Filip Djordjevic as the visitors kicked off. However, their efforts were initially met with resolute defending by Milan. Lazio's Keita instantly oscillated between moments of brilliance and frustration as his drive in the 47th minute failed to trouble Donnarumma – the ball sailing into the stands.\n\nDespite the back-and-forth nature of the play, the attacks were punctuated with fouls and indirect free-kicks rather than clear chances. Lazio, sensing the urgency, began to press harder, but Milan's defense, anchored by the imperious figure of Donnarumma, kept them at bay. Moments of individual skill were prevalent; however, neither side could consistently capitalize on them.\n\nAs the hour mark approached, the game rhythm remained somewhat disjointed with frequent throw-ins and clearances. Keita, for instance, was brought down inside the box, only for the infringement to occur in his run-up, thus no penalty ensued. Donnarumma again displayed his extraordinary shot-stopping abilities in the 74th minute, denying Anderson’s long-range effort that seemed destined for the bottom corner. The home crowd acknowledged this with a rapturous applause.\n\nAC Milan expanded their lead in the 79th minute under dramatic circumstances. Stefan Radu from Lazio handled the ball inside his box, resulting in a penalty. Niang stepped up confidently and sent Strakosha the wrong way with a precise low shot into the bottom left corner to make it 2-0. This goal provided Milan with a vital cushion as the game entered its final phases.\n\nHowever, the match remained contentious till the end with Lazio picking up multiple yellow cards, a notable one being issued to de Vrij for a late challenge in the 90th minute. AC Milan, buoyed by their advantage, played with maturity, focusing on maintaining their lead. Both teams continued to trade possession and shots, but the defensive stability and tactical discipline of Milan ensured that Lazio could not mount a comeback.\n\nLate substitutions also reflected the strategic shifts with Milan bringing on Keisuke Honda for Bonaventura and Gustavo Gomez for Carlos Bacca, solidifying their defensive setup. Lazio's final push nearly yielded a reward when Keita found himself one-on-one against Donnarumma, but the young keeper produced another critical save.\n\nDespite repeated efforts from Lazio, the final whistle was impending as the clock ticked towards the end of the 90 minutes and beyond into added time. The game concluded with Milan firmly in control, having executed their game plan to perfection.\n\nThe overall display may not have been packed with non-stop excitement, but AC Milan's disciplined approach and timely goals clearly demarcated them as the superior side on the day. Their balance of swift counter-attacks and solid defensive structure neutralized Lazio's long-ball strategy effectively. The match closed at 2-0 in favor of Milan, marking an essential and well-earned victory for Vincenzo Montella's men. The home fans left the San Siro satisfied, buoyed by an efficient and commanding performance from their beloved Rossoneri."
