ball\n14:35 Comment: Because the opponent was already ready to punish for this mistake\n14:38 Comment: Already put pressure\n14:40 Comment: But we see\n14:41 Comment: Roma's pressure is not so high\n14:43 Comment: At Juventus, the Romans are limited to meeting the opponent at the level of the average champions\n14:50 Comment: Diagonal towards Manzhukic\n14:54 Comment: He handles the ball softly\n14:56 Comment: And Binatya returns it\n14:59 Comment: Binatya through two lines\n15:1 Comment: Excellent pass to Higuain and what a treatment it is\n15:3 Comment: Manzukic one-on-one against Rudiger\n15:6 Comment: Didn't rush to dribble\n15:8 Comment: Higuain, striking position\n15:10 Comment: Goncal Higuain is one of those strikers\n15:13 Comment: Which can threaten the opponent's goal

position\n15:46 Comment: Well, in one or two touches everything is solved\n15:48 Comment: Salah\n15:51 Comment: In Jack's absence, of course.\n15:54 Comment: Main attacking force\n15:56 Comment: Strike force is Mohamed Salah\n15:58 Comment: Here he is with the ball\n16:0 Comment: Benatya turns deftly\n16:2 Comment: In violation of the rules\n16:4 Comment: Stops an opponent\n16:6 Comment:

contact\n16:20 Comment: Still at the beginning when\n16:22 Comment: Salah turned around\n16:25 Comment: He was caught on the hip by Benatya\n16:28 Comment: And even Salah\n16:30 Comment: Let's just say I almost lost my balance\n16:33 Comment: And already in an attempt to level it I came across a tackle\n16:37 Comment: I still think for this\n16:40 Comment: The whistle was blown\n16:42 Comment: Paredes performs the standard well\n16:44 Comment: He can even break through from here\n16:46 Comment: But from the run-up it is clear that this will most likely be a serve\n16:49 Comment: Many tall football players\n16:51 Comment: The entire line of defense is worth it\n16:53 Comment: Paredes\n16:55 Comment: Excellent presentation\n16:57 Comment: Berosim\n16:59 Comment: To the striking position\n17:1 Comment: Went out\n17:2 Comment: Ran out\n17:4 Comment: And Nistovy here proves that the ball still went away\n17:7 Comment: Op\n17:9 Comment: And so\n17:10 Comment: Sosnovaya\n17:11

here\n17:21 Comment: But in any case, this is not an episode that needs a long time.\n17:24 Comment: Quarrel\n17:26 Comment: In my opinion, it’s still from Banuch\n17:28 Comment: Left competence in the field\n17:30 Comment: But then one of the assistants to the chief arbiter had to take the floor\n17:33 Comment: Which is located\n17:35 Comment: Near the thief\n17:37 Comment: I think Banty\n17:38

Paredes\n18:23 Comment: Near post delivery\n18:24 Comment: Higuain came in handy here\n18:26 Comment: 19 minutes\n18:27 Comment: Roma Juventus 0-0\n18:30 Comment: Which is already a season in a row\n18:33 Comment: Roma is trying to compete on equal terms with Juventus\n18:36 Comment: Iglain came in handy here 19th minute Roma Juventus 0-0\n18:38 Comment: But here it was a bit rough\n18:40 Comment: And in fact this is already\n18:42 Comment: At least a reason to chat with Rüdiger\n18:45 Comment: Hand poke to the head\n18:50 Comment: In the neck, in the persecution\n18:52 Comment: In my opinion it was used very frankly\n18:57 Comment: And besides, Rudiger was also offside\n19:3 Comment: Roma has been struggling for a season now, trying to hold on\n19:6 Comment: At some parts of the season it even beats Juventus\n19:9 Comment: Well, or on par with him\n19:13 Comment: Well, then everything repeats itself\n19:15 Comment: From time to time\n19:16 Comment: Roma simply cannot perform

Comment: It's just that the transmission doesn't work\n19:58 Comment: Still, Manzhukic is not a master of these cutting passes.\n20:1 Comment: Right here\n20:2 Comment: That's why Janjic exists on the field.\n20:8 Comment: Well, and several other football players\n20:13 Comment: Juventus have the ball under control\n20:18 Comment: In general, this Roma lineup is without Jack, but with Perotti, the

Comment: To the right of Cuadrado.\n2:34 Comment: In the center of Iguaia.\n2:37 Comment: Well, in fact, it’s more like exactly the same 4-2-3-1 formation that Roma uses.\n2:44 Comment: Although this is still debatable.\n2:47 Comment: Well, probably these are the tactical intricacies.\n2:51 Comment: You know, honestly, so far the match isn't even...\n2:57 Comment: provokes these considerations.\n2:58 Comment: What about tactics?\n2:59 Comment: There aren't many original tactical solutions here.\n3:5 Comment: Yes, it was interesting to look at Roma without a classic center forward,\n3:8 Comment: although this happened in the past and the year before.\n3:10 Comment: We can still remember the previous versions of Roma from the fields in the 2000s,\n3:18 Comment: when he used to play without a striker at all.\n3:22 Comment: Transmission from Emerson.\n3:23 Comment: Emerson finally joined the attack.\n3:26 Comment: Roma had a good mood in the first minutes of the half.\n3:28 Comment: Parades passes to the right edge.\n3:31 Comment: Peroti was felt here.\n3:33 Comment: Salak is now in the center forward position.\n3:35 Comment: And, apparently, a corner one.\n3:38 Comment: In general, in theory, Stefan El Sharawi could perform well in this position.\n3:44 Comment: Here it is, by the way, in close-up.\n3:46 Comment: After all, he, speaking for Milan,\n3:49 Comment: it was probably the brightest season of his career,\n3:52 Comment: scored a bunch of goals,\n3:53 Comment: playing exactly centrally.\n3:55 Comment: A striker, and not only that.\n3:58 Comment: Well, that’s Spalletti’s choice.\n4:1 Comment: Serve to the near post.\n4:3 Comment: The banuchy ball clears the rebound for Neingalan.\n4:6 Comment: Stefan El Sharawi did not

still be a whistle.\n4:43 Comment: There was a foul there.\n4:44 Comment: Yellow card.\n4:45 Comment: Delayed foul.\n4:47 Comment: And a set aside card for Neingalan.\n4:50 Comment: Now, let's find out old man Bunty.\n4:56 Comment: He owed us for the first half.\n4:58 Comment: Yellow Derosie, yes.\n5:1 Comment: During which he did not show a single warning.\n5:5 Comment: Yes, no questions asked.\n5:8 Comment: No questions asked.\n5:8 Comment: Bravo, bravo Bunty.\n5:11 Comment: Well done Bunty.\n5:13 Comment: Because this is a common mistake, as young referees told me.\n5:18 Comment: They look at the ball, they look at the continuation of the attack.\n5:21 Comment: And Bunty watched the episode with the cut to the end.\n5:24 Comment: And I saw how Derosi stuck out his leg, stuck out his hip.\n5:28 Comment: And so he, Bunty, stood on the field.\n5:30 Comment: I'm drunk.\n5:31 Comment: Who has already given the transmission.\n5:34 Comment: In general, Derosi consciously committed this violation.\n5:36 Comment: Dirty, ugly.\n5:37 Comment: Yellow card.\n5:39 Comment: But you know, such yellows, such fouls, they are also important.\n5:44 Comment: Derosi now played the role of Tavgay.\n5:48 Comment: Now we are in the midst of the National Hockey League playoffs.\n5:51 Comment: Well, we know these stories when Tavgai often raises their temperature.\n5:57 Comment: Gnaw.\n5:58 Comment: Some kind of fights, some kind of joint and so on.\n6:1 Comment: Another foul from Neingolan.\n6:3 Comment: Please note that Neingolan has torn gaiters.\n6:7 Comment: But this is not an accident.\n6:9 Comment: And this is not a problem with the technical sponsor, the equipment manufacturer.\n6:15 Comment: The point is different; if I’m not mistaken, Inter players introduced such a fashion in the Italian championship.\n6:21 Comment: First.\n6:27 Comment: In short, it seems that this is not so.\n6:28 Comment: This is wrong.\n6:28 Comment: Seriously speaking, we are talking about the fact that leggings, indeed, modern leggings are quite seriously tight.\n6:36 Comment: After all, in addition to everything else, they have one more function - to support the shields.\n6:40 Comment: Although the shields also have their own stockings.\n6:42 Comment: In general, we can talk about this for a long time here, about equipment.\n6:45 Comment: The simple fact is that the leg warmers interfere with blood circulation in the calf muscles, which become quite clogged during matches.\n6:54 Comment: Yes, the load is still some kind of, football players run 11, 10, 12 kilometers.\n6:58 Comment: Blood circulation is disrupted, and it turned out that sometimes even because of gaiters, including football players’ calf cramps at the end of the game.\n7:6 Comment: And so some have come up with this way to get rid of excess pressure.\n7:12 Comment: They cut the gaiters.\n7:14 Comment: That's all.\n7:15 Comment: Sala.\n7:17 Comment: Couldn't catch the ball.\n7:19 Comment: More precisely, he got caught, but they quickly cut him loose.\n7:21 Comment: There are many players here who play excellent tackling.\n7:26 Comment: Two yellow cards at once.\n7:28 Comment: First in the second half at Roma.\n7:30 Comment: Fedrico Pacio and Daniel Edrosi.\n7:32 Comment: This is a slightly different Roma.\n7:34 Comment: Let her play not with a ball, but with a dice.\n7:36 Comment: She is now trying to pin down her opponent.\n7:40 Comment: Somewhere, maybe, it will scare you away.\n7:43 Comment: And show your character.\n7:45 Comment: What was missing in the first half.\n7:47 Comment: Because, I say again, Roma sat down very deeply.\n7:50 Comment: Juventus was able to do a lot in the middle of the field.\n7:53 Comment: Juventus hit often.\n7:54 Comment: According to statistics, under 10 on the point.\n7:58 Comment: Translation.\n8:0 Comment: Square.\n8:3 Comment: Only on the second try.\n8:5 Comment: And even then he didn’t handle the ball.\n8:7 Comment: It hits Alsharovi's legs.\n8:9 Comment: He gets up quickly.\n8:11 Comment: Roma began to enter the selection process much more actively.\n8:15 Comment: Fights more actively for the ball.\n8:18 Comment: Emerson.\n8:20 Comment: By the way, I watched the replays.\n8:22 Comment: I hope together with you.\n8:24 Comment: During the break, a series of alternative repetitions.\n8:26 Comment: And Emerson, of course, is one of the main ones.\n8:28 Comment: The culprits of the goal against Roma.\n8:31 Comment: He let Higuain go behind him.\n8:33 Comment: Although, albeit harsh, but still.\n8:36 Comment: There was a long pass from Sturaro.\n8:39 Comment: And there was enough time to rebuild.\n8:41 Comment: But Higuain again opened up remarkably well.\n8:46 Comment: Well, Sturaro did a great job.\n8:50 Comment: In turn, the main culprit, in my opinion, for the goal missed by Juventus was Lishtan.\n8:56 Comment: Which, in turn, had already missed Drossi.\n8:59 Comment: And let him shoot twice.\n9:1 Comment: Roma is on the attack.\n9:3 Comment: So far these are all balls that are not flying somewhere towards the nose, shoulder and throat.\n9:9 Comment: Try to cope with them.\n9:11 Comment: With such inaccurate transmissions.\n9:13 Comment: But, at the same time, Roma stifles Listeiner, who is forced to perform such an inaccurate pass.\n9:20 Comment: Lots of unforced mistakes from both teams in the second half.\n9:25 Comment: Drossi.\n9:27 Comment: In general, I must say that in recent years Juventus has not been performing very well here at the Olimpico.\n9:34 Comment: There is only one victory in the last six matches.\n9:38 Comment: Roma knows how to play with Juved.\n9:43 Comment: Most often, this is exactly this kind of football.\n9:46 Comment: With the imposition of your will.\n9:48 Comment: That's how it is now.\n9:49 Comment: With control, positional attack.\n9:51 Comment: Emerson.\n9:52 Comment: On Drossi.\n9:53 Comment: Drossi.\n9:54 Comment: Drossi shoots a free throw.\n9:55 Comment: This is Salah.\n9:56 Comment: But once again I am forced to talk about this.\n9:59 Comment: It's Salah, not Dzeko.\n10:1 Comment: Jacko.\n10:2 Comment: How to position the shoulder.\n10:6 Comment: So at least take off his panties, right?\n10:8 Comment: As it happened in the national team match.\n10:10 Comment: Remember?\n10:11 Comment: Another unique episode.\n10:14 Comment: Striptease live.\n10:16 Comment: The match, in my opinion, is with Bosnia Herzegovina.\n10:19 Comment: AND...\n10:20 Comment: Okay, we'll remember this later.\n10:22 Comment: El Sharawi.\n10:23 Comment: Impact position.\n10:24 Comment: What a spin.\n10:25 Comment: Goal!\n10:30 Comment: El Sharawi.\n10:32 Comment: Amazing blow.\n10:34 Comment: It's something from Snooker.\n10:36 Comment: It's something from Billiards.\n10:38 Comment: How this ball, already going out of bounds, seemed to spin.\n10:44 Comment: Yes, he returned to the gate.\n10:46 Comment: This is what we talked about in the first half.\n10:50 Comment: A large number of strikes from medium and long range.\n10:53 Comment: At some point this quantity had to turn into quality.\n10:56 Comment: Higuain is here.\n10:58 Comment: Yes, Ovsal raises this flag, the referee.\n11:2 Comment: But, the principle of advantage.\n11:4 Comment: Roma had the ball.\n11:5 Comment: She continues her attack.\n11:6 Comment: El Sharawi meets him late.\n11:8 Comment: Leichsteiner, who, in theory, is already the culprit.\n11:12 Comment: 2 heads at once.\n11:13 Comment: There is no insurance here.\n11:14 Comment: And, in my opinion, there was even a slight rebound.\n11:16 Comment: Well, it doesn't matter.\n11:17 Comment: Law!\n11:37 Comment: Don't overstrain yourself, poor thing.\n11:38 Comment: They also tell you to stay with them for more than 35 minutes.\n11:42 Comment: Oh, how I burst out.\n11:44 Comment: But it was worth it.\n11:46 Comment: Roma took the lead in the match with the champion.\n11:48 Comment: And Roma, I must say, is reaping the benefits in this match.\n11:52 Comment: And these are the fruits of a rather active period at the beginning of the second half.\n11:57 Comment: Well, a great strike from Stefan El Sharawi.\n12:2 Comment: That's the way he likes to do it.\n12:4 Comment: By the way, during his career he has a lot of goals in exactly this style of execution, as they say.\n12:12 Comment: When, consciously, having seen the goal, turning and twisting the ankle, the football player hits the far corner.\n12:22 Comment: Cool.\n12:23 Comment: Everything was perfectly executed.\n12:25 Comment: But this is a completely different challenge for Juventus.\n12:28 Comment: Come on, Juve, how will the champion respond?\n12:31 Comment: To begin with, the champion earns a corner.\n12:34 Comment: Ha ha ha, drunkard.\n12:36 Comment: Have you seen this?\n12:37 Comment: Here it is a grin, a smile.\n12:39 Comment: He understands perfectly well that this whistle is addressed specifically to him.\n12:43 Comment: Not just anyone, but him.\n12:45 Comment: Pyanich serve.\n12:47 Comment: Rebound for Samoa.\n12:48 Comment: Samoa had already taken a shot and hit the post.\n12:50 Comment: He throws the ball, moves away from Emmers.\n12:52 Comment: She probably earns another corner.\n12:55 Comment: But no.\n12:57 Comment: Emmersan fought back.\n13:0 Comment: Do you see these emotions, these gestures, this articulation?\n13:6 Comment: They get into this game to the fullest.\n13:10 Comment: Nin Galan scores the scoring pass.\n13:15 Comment: Let's look again.\n13:17 Comment: Oh.\n13:20 Comment: Like on cloth.\n13:23 Comment: This ball rolled.\n13:27 Comment: And the joy of the Roman fans.\n13:30 Comment: This is a matter of principles.\n13:32 Comment: By the way, a large number of women and children.\n13:34 Comment: Perhaps, of course, the director and cameraman snatched them especially for the ambience.\n13:42 Comment: But you know very well what a cult of football is in Italy.\n13:46 Comment: Yes, you will answer me now.\n13:48 Comment: Just look at the statistics on season ticket sales, and so on, and so

    "summary": "In a pulsating encounter that saw AS Roma clashing with Juventus, Roma emerged victorious with a 3-1 win, a result that infused fresh vigor into their campaign for a direct Champions League spot. With both teams carrying high stakes into this encounter, the atmosphere at the Stadio Olimpico was electric, intensified further by the late appearance of the legendary Francesco Totti.\n\nFrom the very beginning, the tension in the air was palpable. As the referee's whistle echoed across the stadium, both teams understood the gravity of this clash. A win was mandatory for Roma for a direct entry into the Champions League, while Juventus sought to cement their championship aspirations with a draw or victory.\n\nRoma opened the proceedings energetically. A rapid build-up saw the team briskly transitioning the ball to Mohamed Salah, whose agility and sheer pace put immediate pressure on Juventus' backline. Their aggressive stance bore early witness to tactical fouls and audacious tackles, signaling a high-octane contest ahead.\n\nThe early exchanges swung back and forth with Juventus initially weathering Roma's storm. Breaking through the spine of Roma’s defense, Miralem Pjanic consistently orchestrated plays that sought to disrupt the defensive formation of his former team. However, Juventus met significant resistance from Roma's well-coordinated defense, particularly with Antonio Rüdiger and Kostas Manolas delivering crucial interventions.\n\nJuventus broke the deadlock in the 21st minute. A seemingly innocuous build-up saw Mario Mandzukic control a long pass deftly, midway through Roma's half. His interplay with Gonzalo Higuain culminated in a stinging pass from Higuain to Mario Lemina. Lemina, finding himself in a prime position, made no mistake, firing the ball past Wojciech Szczesny. It was a move that encapsulated tactical precision and split-second decisions, and Juventus celebrated an all-too-familiar scene of capitalizing on their limited opportunities.\n\nJust a few minutes later, Roma responded with an intensity that highlighted their ambitions. From a corner in the 25th minute, Daniele De Rossi showed why he remains a vital talismanic presence for Roma. The initial attempt saw Manolas' header being parried by Buffon, only for the ball to land at De Rossi's feet, who promptly dispatched it into the net, leveling the scoreline. The stadium erupted, reverberating the enthusiasm and relief of the Roman supporters.\n\nSteeped in a mix of high and low blocks, Roma’s defensive strategy oscillated between interception and recycling possession. On the offensive, Salah and El Shaarawy, with their fluid movements, continuously tested Juventus' defensive resilience. Emerson Palmieri, despite an otherwise subdued performance, managed to offer crucial support runs, although he did commit errors leading to dangerous counter plays for Juventus.\n\nAs halftime approached, the momentum swayed like a pendulum. Juventus, typically adept at controlling games with minimal possession, appeared vulnerable against Roma's relentless press. With no substitutions from either side, the second half resumed in the same frenzied fashion. An enthusiastic Roma side, revitalized during the break, launched a more concentrated offensive.\n\nIn the 56th minute, Roma's determination bore fruit again. Stephan El Shaarawy, with a moment of individual brilliance, received the ball from De Rossi and fired a curling shot from just outside the penalty area. The ball, graced with exquisite precision, beat Buffon and nestled into the top corner. The goal demonstrated El Shaarawy’s technical mastery and audacity, reviving his reputation for scoring spectacular goals from range.\n\nJuventus sought an immediate response. Dani Alves, brought in to enhance the offensive dynamics, provided incisive runs and crosses, but found little success against Roma's committed defense. Paulo Dybala’s introduction added more fluidity to Juventus' attacking phase. Nevertheless, Roma’s defensive discipline, led by the stalwarts Manolas and Fazio, thwarted multiple Juventus advancements.\n\nIn the 65th minute, Roma struck once more, delivering a decisive blow to Juventus’ title celebrations. Radja Nainggolan, benefiting from Salah’s incisive pass, unleashed a thunderous strike that further showcased his propensity for crucial goals. The fierce shot from Nainggolan was unstoppable, sending the Roman faithful into raptures and further asserting Roma's dominance on the night.\n\nAs the game drew towards its final chapter, Francesco Totti's entry onto the pitch was met with immense admiration and emotion. The applause and chants symbolized the high regard in which he is held and served as a fitting tribute to his illustrious career. Roma shifted their focus to absorb Juventus’ attacks, relying on counter-attacks to clinch the win.\n\nJuventus, desperate to salvage something from the game, pushed forward earnestly. Their intent was clear with every scramble for the ball in Roma's half. However, critical defensive clearances and key saves from Szczesny ensured Juventus' efforts remained futile.\n\nDespite Juventus’ robust attempts, they found themselves repeatedly thwarted by Roma's steadfast backline and midfield. Dani Alves, tasked with reigniting Juventus’ offensive prowess, found his contributions stymied by collective defensive efforts. The powerful presence of Bonucci and Benatia during set-pieces came close to altering the scoreline again, yet these opportunities fell short of their usual finesse.\n\nThe game was marked by fierce tackles, illustrated by the handing out of yellow cards, which sought to disrupt fluid play and establish a psychological edge. Roma played not just with skill but with hunger and decisiveness, reflecting their understanding of this game’s significance to their season.\n\nAs the final whistle approached, the atmosphere grew more charged, Rome's team deftly managed the closing minutes. Juventus, losing their second game this season by conceding three goals, could only reflect on missed opportunities and defensive lapses. The final moments underscored Roma's tactical acumen, emotional resilience, and unity on the pitch.\n\nThe 3-1 result was a testament to Roma’s formidable display against the reigning champions. It was a night that reaffirmed their Champions League aspirations and emphasized their growth as a cohesive unit capable of defying odds. The Skipper Francesco Totti’s appearance marked a poignant moment in Roma’s history, encapsulating the spirit and legacy that he leaves behind.\n\nThus, in a game that saw tactical brilliance, individual moments of genius, and collective resilience, Roma triumphed in a manner befitting their illustrious heritage. This crucial victory not only enriched their campaign but also cemented their candidature for Europe’s elite competition, drawing the curtain on a captivating chapter of Serie A."
