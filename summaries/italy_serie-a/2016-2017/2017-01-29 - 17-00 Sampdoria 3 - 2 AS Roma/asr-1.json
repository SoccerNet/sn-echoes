Sandoria is in 16th position,\n0:51 Comment: She has 24 points.\n0:55 Comment: But, interestingly, Sandoria's position is now characterized by the number 14, doubled\n1:1 Comment: number 14, because Sandoria has 14 points before the relegation zone, although there are only two lines,\n1:7 Comment: it would seem, but there is such a big gap from Crotone, who has 10 points. And on the other hand\n1:13 Comment: On the other hand, Sandoria has 14 points up to Europe, to sixth place, which it occupies\n1:20 Comment: Atalanta.\n1:23 Comment: AND...\n1:24 Comment: this is the position when\n1:30 Comment: the opportunity to drop into the relegation zone is equal to the opportunity to be in Europe, and both of these\n1:37 Comment: possibilities, by and large, based on a fairly large amount of points, 14,\n1:42 Comment: Let me remind you, it’s quite low probability, probably makes Sandoria a team in this\n1:48 Comment: the classic swamp incarnation, that is, neither here nor there.

Pratt again.\n2:50 Comment: He is now the main entertainer of all these combinations.\n2:56 Comment: At least he has to step back sometimes.\n2:58 Comment: But he has now moved back in order to find a good position for a forward pass.\n3:4 Comment: Muriel fell asleep a little.\n3:6 Comment: The ball bounced towards the middle of the field.\n3:9 Comment: Roma got a break.\n3:10 Comment: And we also have a short break in order to get acquainted with the composition of the playing teams.\n3:15 Comment: So, Dory himself. Today it's Christian Pugioni in goal.\n3:19 Comment: First number.\n3:26 Comment: Here is the ball in his hands.\n3:31 Comment: There is a four in defense.\n3:36 Comment: Vasco Regini defends on the

Comment: It was just a gift, of course, for Bruno Fernandes.\n4:49 Comment: I rested because the ball bounced.\n4:52 Comment: Pujoni's hand to him.\n4:55 Comment: The whole target was in front of him.\n4:57 Comment: There was no point in doing anything, of course.\n5:1 Comment: But the goalkeeper definitely didn’t have time to get up.\n5:6 Comment: And 0-1.\n5:8 Comment: This is how they start.\n5:14 Comment: It’s interesting that in these 5 minutes there were probably 2 attacks in both directions.\n5:19 Comment: But Sandori’s attacks, these starting ones, which began immediately after Paul Matseleni’s whistle,\n5:28 Comment: never resulted in a normal shot on goal.\n5:31 Comment: At Roma, you see, in this second attack, which ultimately became a scoring attack,\n5:38 Comment: there were two good, solid shots on target.\n5:42 Comment: There are no violations of the rules in the opinion of the referee.\n5:45 Comment: Here he must whistle because Daniel Derosy was held back.\n5:48 Comment: It happens.\n5:49 Comment: Sometimes the balls are knocked down by teams that have not yet announced their full roster to us.\n5:59 Comment: But now we are making up for it.\n6:2

ago.\n7:46 Comment: In Kursk.\n7:48 Comment: In the Italian Cup.\n7:50 Comment: Having defeated this team with a score of 4-0.\n7:54 Comment: This, of course, was one of the most important topics of conversation with coaches and players before the match.\n8:4 Comment: But everyone agreed on this, both Spalletti so diplomatically, and Gian Powell, naturally, because it was in his interests,\n8:11 Comment: they said that this championship game would be completely different from the cup game, such a defeat,\n8:16 Comment: such a clear advantage.\n8:18 Comment: And, of course, he, of course, will not have a single team.\n8:19 Comment: We'll see how it all happens.\n8:24 Comment: For now, we note that in 2017, in four matches played,\n8:31 Comment: two tournaments, Roma has not yet conceded a single goal.\n8:36 Comment: Well, he scores in everyone, and scores...\n8:40 Comment: Now it's already...\n8:44 Comment: Not so much...\n8:48 Comment: Not much, but...\n8:49 Comment: These victories are still victories.\n8:53 Comment: It's still three points.\n8:56 Comment: And this is exactly what Chan Spalletti needed, who has been constantly repeating all season.\n9:1 Comment: This is his important idea.\n9:3 Comment: Here’s another great point: the main thing for us is to stay in the rhythm of Juventus,\n9:8 Comment: don’t fall out of it and be there all the time.\n9:13 Comment: It works.\n9:14 Comment: Now it’s just in this style,\n9:18 Comment: here is a good one, high quality\n9:21 Comment: leading the fight for first place in the team.\n9:26 Comment: Then it's not necessary\n9:29 Comment: set off fireworks\n9:31 Comment: in every match,\n9:32 Comment: but be sure to score and\n9:34 Comment: take 3 points.\n9:39 Comment: Roma knocks down.\n9:40 Comment: Now has\n9:43 Comment: another great chance\n9:44 Comment: But\n9:45 Comment: not to tell,\n9:48 Comment: to eat\n9:50 Comment: installation for permanent ownership.\n9:52 Comment: Moreover\n9:52 Comment: included as needed.\n10:15 Comment: Great. That’s how I seem to put my back now\n10:20 Comment: Regini.\n10:23 Comment: But Roma is extremely\n10:24 Comment: aggressive.\n10:25 Comment: Here in the ball yard.\n10:29 Comment: The second chance that Jack had,\n10:31 Comment: arose after Strotman\n10:32 Comment: went to the courtyard in the center.\n10:36 Comment: Here here\n10:36 Comment: put pressure on Roma, of course\n10:38 Comment: maybe phenomenal.\n10:40 Comment: Let's see how he will cope with a pair of attackers.\n10:43 Comment: And a very interesting connection.\n10:44 Comment: Experienced, qualified.\n10:44 Comment: A very interesting connection.\n10:45 Comment: And Orello and spicy,\n10:47 Comment: very talented Muriel.\n10:50 Comment: Roma's three central defenders.\n10:54 Comment: There are certain intrigues.\n11:14 Comment: AND...\n11:15 Comment: Rüdiger slipped while performing a long translation.\n11:19 Comment: But the pass turns out to be accurate.\n11:23 Comment: Derosi.\n11:31 Comment: Offside.\n11:32 Comment: Derosi.\n11:46 Comment: But if Roma's results this year can only please Roman fans,\n11:54 Comment: those who, of course, will not allow it, then the picture is completely opposite in the camp of Sandoria.\n12:0 Comment: There have been no victories here for a very long time.\n12:3 Comment: The last win was recorded on December 4 last year.\n12:9 Comment: Turrino.\n12:11 Comment: Turrino was won here.\n12:11 Comment: Turrino.\n12:12 Comment: Wonderful jouin.\n12:13 Comment: Getting sick, getting sick...\n12:14 Comment: What's there?\n12:14 Comment: Wonderful jouin.\n12:14 Comment: Well, since then, defeats and victories alternate.\n12:22 Comment: In Serie A, the last match was lost to Atalanta with a minimal score.\n12:31 Comment: Although everyone notes, and Marco Gianpaolo pays attention to this,\n12:37 Comment: that Usamboria is among the teams that hit the turn quite often.\n12:41 Comment: Usamboria has some very interesting numbers about hitting the goalposts and crossbar.\n12:48 Comment: That is, luck is somewhere nearby, and the team does a lot to lure it and keep it.\n12:58 Comment: As Gianpaolo says, everything is fine with the organization of chances, bad with their implementation.\n13:4 Comment: Now, please, a clear example.\n13:8 Comment: Brono Ferdandes is actually on his way out.\n13:11 Comment: 1 on 1.\n13:11 Comment: And here Fermalin managed to play very well.\n13:17 Comment: Pass it behind his back.\n13:20 Comment: But amazing goalkeeper play.\n13:23 Comment: Wojciach Szczęcny.\n13:26 Comment: This ball stopped.\n13:29 Comment: Angular.\n13:31 Comment: On that sunny side is the supply.\n13:33 Comment: And Edin Dzeko is doing a great job here, by the way.\n13:37 Comment: So that he does not stretch his legs towards this ball at all.\n13:41 Comment: Brono Percy is also sloppy.\n13:44 Comment: Lets himself be beaten.\n13:48 Comment: Pratu.\n13:49 Comment: Pass into the penalty area.\n13:50 Comment: Murel is there.\n13:51 Comment: And a shot into the near corner.\n13:53 Comment: This is how Sandori works.\n13:55 Comment: Pretty fast.\n13:56 Comment: Insidiously.\n13:57 Comment: And there are interesting performance moves.\n13:59 Comment: Look how gorgeous Prat is.\n14:1 Comment: Here he simply literally swallowed his opponent on the flank in a few moves.\n14:8 Comment: What a convenient pass he made.\n14:10 Comment: And Murel.\n14:11 Comment: Having assessed my position, my loneliness in this attack, I realized that the most cunning and dangerous option for the opponent would be just such a blow, a low thrust into the near corner.\n14:22 Comment: If he had hit the goal, I would not have wanted to be in Wojciech Szczęcny’s place.\n14:29 Comment: It would be very difficult to pull out.\n14:31 Comment: Sandori's new attack.\n14:33 Comment: She feels quite normal in a positional attack.\n14:37 Comment: Possessing the ball.\n14:39 Comment: Using your initiative.\n14:41 Comment: And by the mood, by the movement of the players.\n14:45 Comment: By, so to speak, the level of chins and noses, as well as tails.\n14:56 Comment: It is clear that there is no decline in will or spirit.\n15:6 Comment: The team was quite collected and calmly survived this missed goal.\n15:10 Comment: And still not forgotten.\n15:11 Comment: And he still believes that everything will be fine.\n15:13 Comment: But Roma!\n15:15 Comment: After all, she suppresses her opponents not only with some impudence.\n15:23 Comment: And she can beat not only those who were afraid of her and saved her in front of her.\n15:31 Comment: She can simply beat because of her collective skill, because of her tactical training.\n15:37 Comment: That's why Romy doesn't care what he plays either.\n15:41 Comment: And praticamente, while instinct itself, duria still feels cheerful and normal.\n15:42 Comment: And practically for now, Gương의oruso hetata does not play along with the backgrounds.\n15:45 Comment: Roma plays with a certain reserve, the main thing for some people in its composition is not to play too hard.\n15:46 Comment: Brona Perez already has a bad experience countering Albinatr features before direynpro.\n15:51 Comment: That's rough.\n15:52 Comment: His berke has a citizen\n16:11 Comment: The Belgian midfielder can surpass him.\n16:16 Comment: Emerson is now trying to catch up with his opponent on the flank.\n16:23 Comment: Boretto is very diligent.\n16:26 Comment: Samdoria's three central midfielders are positioned in such a way that they are not grouped centrally.\n16:33 Comment: But Boretto and Prat play a lot in the off-flank zones.\n16:44 Comment: Leaves Thoreira and Bruno Fernandez to cover the central zone.\n16:58 Comment: These are the 4-3-3 or 4-3-1-2 that...\n17:3 Comment: He can do it.\n17:3 Comment: You can even transform mentally into a 4-4-2 with a diamond formation in midfield.\n17:21 Comment: The tall Skriner makes a forward pass.\n17:24 Comment: The attack is developing through the central zone.\n17:26 Comment: Murel in the penalty area.\n17:28 Comment: Murel without any hesitation.\n17:31 Comment: And impatiently.\n17:33 Comment: And tightening all the time beats the turn.\n17:34 Comment: He comes in and hits.\n17:43 Comment: 6 goals this season.\n17:45 Comment: Combines have already scored.\n17:51 Comment: Innings.\n17:52 Comment: The ball goes out of bounds.\n17:54 Comment: But the referee shows that there was a touch and there should be a corner.\n18:3 Comment: And now the football player is ع sequentza.\n18:9 Comment: Well done Elias Ol hemmer.\n18:11 Comment: Butının.\n18:13 Comment: However, Coast came.\n18:14 Comment: Yes.\n18:15 Comment: Noinmsky.\n18:20 Comment: Yes, yes yet.\n18:22 Comment: And so it happened.\n18:24 Comment: The black people were in the comments.\n18:28 Comment: Maybe grab it?\n18:30 Comment: Well, maybe.\n18:31 Comment: And this is Saquio.\n18:32 Comment: Yes.\n18:32 Comment: Well, yes.\n18:32 Comment: Yes.\n18:32 Comment: He's going to win.\n18:32 Comment: Yes.\n18:33 Comment: Paulo Matsoleini captures it correctly.\n18:35 Comment: What actually happened.\n18:37 Comment: Let's see, Paraguayan.\n18:39 Comment: The second one intervenes in the combat.\n18:41 Comment: Yes, indeed, he crashes into Pirotti's knee.\n18:44 Comment: Here's the blow.\n18:47 Comment: Well, in the final phase of this attack there will also be a pass to Quagliarola.\n18:50 Comment: We won't see it.\n18:51 Comment: Now let's see how the defense stops it.\n18:57 Comment: Roma, it was Fazio.\n18:59 Comment: Stops Muriel.\n19:0 Comment: Samdori has a good attack.\n19:3 Comment: Diverse.\n19:5 Comment: Very impudent.\n19:6 Comment: And the pass is also cool.\n19:7 Comment: And a shot on goal.\n19:8 Comment: Honest, as if with some delay, raises his hands above his head.\n19:14 Comment: Here, perhaps, Burno Fernandez had a theoretical chance to play a pass.\n19:18 Comment: Either with Boretta, to play around, or with Muriel.\n19:20 Comment: But he chose not to lose pace and attacked the goal on his own.\n19:28 Comment: Ermalen.\n19:29 Comment: Well, others.\n19:30 Comment: Defense officials.\n19:34 Comment: Roma.\n19:35 Comment: It must be said that Samdori’s speed of play in attack creates difficulties for defenders.\n19:42 Comment: While they still somehow come out in the freshness.\n19:46 Comment: They're coping.\n19:48 Comment: But systemically there can be great difficulties.\n19:51 Comment: Apparently, from the Roma defense.\n19:53 Comment: Boretta.\n19:54 Comment: On the right flank with the ball.\n19:56 Comment: Transfer by Muriel.\n19:58 Comment: Ermalen meets him.\n19:59 Comment: And he attacks.\n20:0 Comment: It turns out to be behind.\n20:1 Comment: And already passed.\n20:1 Comment: Here!\n20:2 Comment: And please, the ball is in the net.\n20:4 Comment: So much for Samdori's attack.\n20:5 Comment: 1-1.\n20:6 Comment: This is the first goal that Roma concedes in the new year.\n20:11 Comment: It must be said that it is conceded by a worthy opponent.\n20:19 Comment: Muriel credits the assist for the goal.\n20:23 Comment: Midfielder Denis Pratt scored the goal.\n20:30 Comment: And here he is.\n20:32 Comment: You know, he made an impression.\n20:35 Comment: In the very first moments of the match.\n20:39 Comment: Launched attacks.\n20:41 Comment: He made sharp passes.\n20:43 Comment: The forest struggled.\n20:44 Comment: Remember how he dealt with Bruno Perez on the flank.\n20:49 Comment: And Samdori hits a very worthy, beautiful, well-deserved ball.\n20:54 Comment: Replying to Roma about this small failure.\n20:58 Comment: It’s hard to even call it a failure.\n21:1 Comment: There was just a very good, tight long-range shot, which the goalkeeper coped with.\n21:5 Comment: But the goalkeeper simply couldn’t cope with getting up.\n21:9 Comment: Did not have time.\n21:10 Comment: And Bruno Perez scored in the desert.\n21:14 Comment: Here Samdori worked for his goal.\n21:19 Comment: Another assist from Muriel.\n21:23 Comment: And Federico Fazo puts his foot down.\n21:25 Comment: So that the ball just flies away somewhere.\n21:29 Comment: It doesn't matter where.\n21:37 Comment: Indeed, this is a difficult match.\n21:46 Comment: For Roma.\n21:54 Comment: In general, the balance of forces and initiatives.\n21:58 Comment: Actions of the attackers.\n22:1 Comment: Probably, the score would be more fair in favor of Samdori.\n22:6 Comment: Roma was very lucky that they managed to score at the very beginning.\n22:11 Comment: Score.\n22:28 Comment: But in the end, it wasn't that easy.\n22:43 Comment: This was the moment when he could no longer win.\n22:45 Comment: And it wasn't that easy.\n22:46 Comment: It wasn't that easy.\n22:46 Comment: Now he is trying to keep up with his teammates.\n22:53 Comment: Keeps up with Prat, Muriel.\n22:57 Comment: Just this trinity.\n22:58 Comment: AND...\n22:58 Comment: Busit is now attacking Samdori.\n23:5 Comment: Busit.\n23:35 Comment: Muriel.\n23:35 Comment: He feels confident here too.\n23:38 Comment: And the judge is on his side.\n23:41 Comment: Middle of the first half Samdori.\n23:42 Comment: Roma.\n23:43 Comment: We have a very interesting match.\n23:46 Comment: The score is 1-1.\n23:58 Comment: Drum.\n24:3 Comment: 其實 video M Personally Master and\n24:6 Comment: foto 일ilci and\n24:22 Comment: fragments and\n24:24 Comment: utor He supported tr sujet from\n24:26 Comment: Bottom thumbnails with\n24:28 Comment: romo will of course understand thatma자는 theatrical control and that it is not he who acts.\n24:28 Comment: Probably the main strength right now is this composure, high speed, high aggressiveness, attack maneuverability.\n24:36 Comment: And Roma, as a team that contains a large number of experienced people who understand the game well, will find a way to rebuild.\n24:50 Comment: Right now, Roma probably doesn’t need to engage in an attack.\n24:52 Comment: There will be time for both Jack and Nain Gulan to prove themselves.\n24:58 Comment: There are clear values.\n25:2 Comment: But now, perhaps, Derosi and Strotman together should organize, first of all, such a first serious wave for rapid development and counteracting Sandori’s quick attacks.\n25:22 Comment: Shkriner went forward.\n25:47 Comment: Fazio advanced.\n25:49 Comment: He won up, but the rebound here...\n25:52 Comment: Alien, so Muriel had space to clash with Rudiker.\n26:0 Comment: Here, it must be said that the Colombians acted in the best way.\n26:8 Comment: Bruno Perez.\n26:11 Comment: Derosi.\n26:16 Comment: Mohamed Salah is still missing.\n26:20 Comment: He was injured here.\n26:21 Comment: Busy right now.\n26:22 Comment: With the Egyptian team at the African Cup.\n26:25 Comment: And when this tournament was approaching,\n26:30 Comment: many expected difficulties for Roma without Salah.\n26:35 Comment: But Spalletti taught how to rebuild.\n26:41 Comment: And now it even turns out that Roma is without this Egyptian winger\n26:49 Comment: works.\n26:50 Comment: And now it even turns out that Roma is operating without this Egyptian winger.\n26:52 Comment: Better luck in defense.\n26:54 Comment: They say take fewer shots at your own goal.\n26:58 Comment: As for the efficiency ahead, the drop is not so significant.\n27:3 Comment: Here's Muriel again in her style.\n27:7 Comment: Quick strike.\n27:8 Comment: Immediately turning around, changing formation on the march, shifting an imaginary ball from one foot to the other.\n27:17 Comment: But in fact, simply picking up the left one to shoot into the near corner.\n27:22 Comment: This is how the Colombian plays.\n27:25 Comment: In each attack he tries to attack the goal as quickly as possible.\n27:34 Comment: Nain Golan.\n27:42 Comment: And here's Dzeko's pass.\n27:44 Comment: Dzeko took the ball.\n27:45 Comment: Maybe not in the best way.\n27:47 Comment: And Nain Golan knows how to score goals from this point.\n27:52 Comment: White.\n27:52 Comment: Undoubtedly.\n27:53 Comment: Now he is disappointed.\n27:55 Comment: He missed the goal.\n27:59 Comment: Yes, it was a little difficult for Jack.\n28:5 Comment: It seemed that Roma had already lost control of the ball in this attack.\n28:9 Comment: With great difficulty I stopped the ball.\n28:12 Comment: But now on the replay it was very clear what a convenient pass he made to Nain Golan.\n28:17 Comment: Despite all his own difficulties for his partner, he did everything right.\n28:22 Comment: Muriel.\n28:24 Comment: Fazio supplanted him.\n28:28 Comment: Into the dribbling zone, let's say.\n28:29 Comment: From the strike zone, the conditional one, where Muriel really likes to be, to the zone where he also, in principle, feels good.\n28:36 Comment: But let him circle around the corner flag.\n28:39 Comment: This is what the Roma defender decided.\n28:41 Comment: But this loss, this loss, will it become a gain for Roma?\n28:47 Comment: In any case, this loss turns into a yellow card.\n28:50 Comment: Fair.\n28:51 Comment: Fair, absolutely.\n28:53 Comment: Torreiro receives his warning.\n28:59 Comment: It was he who gave such an ugly cross pass to someone else.\n29:6 Comment: And he himself brought down Perotti.\n29:16 Comment: Muriel, Torreiro and the one who didn’t make it into the starting line-up today.\n29:20 Comment: What's more interesting is that he didn't hit it.\n29:21 Comment: The most interesting Polish midfielder Karl Linniti.\n29:24 Comment: Three figures that stand out in the composition of Sandoria.\n29:29 Comment: People who attract

here.\n30:50 Comment: The Genoese have loosened their grip a little now on the attack.\n31:5 Comment: There is no such volatile interaction between Pratt\n31:8 Comment: Muriel and Hvaljar Eloy.\n31:9 Comment: And here is Boretto.\n31:10 Comment: Boretto.\n31:19 Comment: Borettin.\n31:20 Comment: Borete.\n31:21 Comment: Well, I must say that Pratt interrupted enough\n31:25 Comment: long series.\n31:31 Comment: In the 2021st minute he scores.\n31:41 Comment: Therefore, 471 min. compiled this very series, during which\n31:47 Comment: Which Samdoria could not score.\n31:52 Comment: The last goal was against Chievo.\n31:56 Comment: In a lost match 2-1.\n31:59 Comment: And from then on there was another match.\n32:2 Comment: In which the match with part of Samdoria, both teams scored.\n32:7 Comment: It was a match against Napoli.\n32:9 Comment: Also lost with a score of 1-2.\n32:12 Comment: But in that game for Samdoria, Elsid Hysaj scored the goal for Napoli.\n32:22 Comment: It was an own goal.\n32:23 Comment: And finally, after 471 minutes of playing time, Goliador appeared in Samdoria’s lineup.\n32:38 Comment: Well, of course, a very quick goal.\n32:42 Comment: But that wasn't what I started.\n32:42 Comment: Samdoria was a little exhausted.\n32:44 Comment: Now it is clear that these speeds, this liveliness, this sharpness in the legs and movements are no longer there.\n32:52 Comment: The home team, which were observed in the first minutes.\n32:58 Comment: And football starts like this, based on other qualities.\n33:4 Comment: More even.\n33:5 Comment: In which it is easier for truly mature, rooted mastery to emerge.\n33:10 Comment: Well, by ourselves.\n33:12 Comment: You understand that in this kind of football Roma should be stronger.\n33:16 Comment: Let's see if this team will take its toll.\n33:20 Comment: Will she score more goals before the end of the first half?\n33:23 Comment: Right now it looks like he might miss it.\n33:27 Comment: Murelius lacked one and a half steps, literally to complete another cross pass into the penalty area.\n33:36 Comment: The Samdoria players played beautifully.\n33:39 Comment: Fermalen.\n33:41 Comment: Fazio.\n33:42 Comment: Derosi.\n33:47 Comment: Now Nain Golan has dropped to the position of second support.\n33:50 Comment: Strotman stepped forward.\n33:53 Comment: Rüdiger.\n33:55 Comment: His favorite beginning.\n33:56 Comment: This is the diagonal to the left edge.\n33:59 Comment: And here the high-speed movement begins.\n34:2 Comment: This is where the stirring begins.\n34:4 Comment: In the end, the ball is delivered somewhere here in the central zone.\n34:8 Comment: Where Nain Golan is usually on duty.\n34:10 Comment: And he is always there.\n34:12 Comment: Loaded with a gun.\n34:13 Comment: He can always cut in from there.\n34:14 Comment: But now Nain Golan was not there.\n34:17 Comment: And it even turned out to be Daniel Derosi, who had some old scores to settle, apparently with Quagliarelli.\n34:24 Comment: And a violation occurred.\n34:31 Comment: Muriel.\n34:34 Comment: I couldn't cope with my own speed.\n34:39 Comment: Derosi.\n34:42 Comment: Katya Trudiger.\n34:44 Comment: This one is already looking out on the left flank for the recipient of the pass.\n34:48 Comment: No.\n34:48 Comment: Makes a pass to Strotman for the nearest pass.\n34:51 Comment: Next to Jack.\n34:52 Comment: And Jack is ahead of the goalkeeper.\n34:56 Comment: Johnny's.\n35:9 Comment: Quagliarella.\n35:12 Comment: Almost exactly now I played on Bruno Fernandez.\n35:21 Comment: Shkrinyard.\n35:23 Comment: Barretto.\n35:25 Comment: Fast forward.\n35:32 Comment: Very attractive football.\n35:36 Comment: At Samduri.\n35:38 Comment: The one that we used to call vertical.\n35:40 Comment: Or...\n35:42 Comment: Football based on longitudinal passes.\n35:46 Comment: This is true.\n35:47 Comment: This is confirmed by statistical data.\n35:50 Comment: that Samduri still has a lot of game ahead.\n35:53 Comment: Derosi.\n36:12 Comment: Certainly.\n36:23 Comment: PrACT wenn...\n36:25 Comment: It was.\n36:27 Comment: It's safer.\n36:28 Comment: It is

Luigi Ferraris stadium is already whistling.\n36:52 Comment: An understandable reaction to the fact that the Romans now have undivided possession of the ball.\n37:0 Comment: On Ingulan what is the most acute transmission.\n37:3 Comment: Bruno Perez could now create the same chance for one of his partners,\n37:7 Comment: which he himself used in the fifth minute,\n37:11 Comment: when the goalkeeper, who fell on the lawn, was powerless against finishing.\n37:15 Comment: But the finishing touch did not happen.\n37:16 Comment: And now the ball is already flying in the opposite direction.\n37:19 Comment: And the strike is under adjusted touch.\n37:22 Comment: Still, he didn’t turn the gate.\n37:27 Comment: Yes, Bruno Fernandes shows that there is more than just a touch,\n37:29 Comment: and there was also a hand movement.\n37:31 Comment: And it was actually necessary to give a penalty.\n37:33 Comment: Paulo Matsoleni disagreed.\n37:35 Comment: That was the sharpest pass, of course.\n37:37 Comment: From Naingulan.\n37:40 Comment: And Pujoni hits the ball.\n37:43 Comment: I definitely didn’t have time to get up either.\n37:45 Comment: But he probably just saw where exactly he was hitting the ball.\n37:48 Comment: Lying like this, stretched out like a string.\n37:53 Comment: And he understood that he was not laying it at someone’s feet,\n37:56 Comment: and to the safe zone.\n37:58 Comment: Look there at the ratio of attacking actions.\n38:2 Comment: 15-8 in favor of Sandoria.\n38:4 Comment: The home team attacks twice more often.\n38:6 Comment: Look.\n38:7 Comment: Again Pratt deals with Bruno Perez very easily.\n38:12 Comment: And what will this lead to in the end?\n38:14 Comment: The sharpest moment.\n38:17 Comment: Valerella releases this chance.\n38:23 Comment: Great.\n38:23 Comment: The ball arrived.\n38:25 Comment: And here he rushed between the figures of Roma football players.\n38:31 Comment: My brother-in-law could come in.\n38:32 Comment: As a result of a ricochet.\n38:34 Comment: As a result, another corner.\n38:37 Comment: Derosi vs. Skriner.\n38:38 Comment: He is inferior to him in height, but tries to tie him up in a boxer's grip.\n38:42 Comment: And the ball is already flying to the far post.\n38:46 Comment: Where Emerson is.\n38:50 Comment: Another pitch settled down.\n38:52 Comment: At a low altitude, Strotman knocks the ball away.\n38:57 Comment: Already out of bounds. Just.\n39:2 Comment: This is how Sandoria acted constantly in the first minutes.\n39:5 Comment: And now at this pace.\n39:7 Comment: In the game it is inclusions, impulses.\n39:11 Comment: But these impulses are very reminiscent of the debut of the game for the Genoese.\n39:19 Comment: So, of course, it’s too early for Roma to relax.\n39:32 Comment: Bruno Fernandes.\n39:37 Comment: Lroc Jacques Kasmiro Mnak.\n39:39 Comment: Ball criterion.\n39:41 Comment: Т Stadium suited.\n39:43 Comment: B Weise, fought last game armed,\n39:45 Comment: Jackie himself is wondering what's in this game so

first half\n40:16 Comment: The score is tied 1-1\n40:20 Comment: Roma scored the first rather suddenly\n40:24 Comment: And Samdoria equalized the score completely on point\n40:37 Comment: Having put a lot of effort into not letting your opponent go too far\n40:46 Comment: And here are the figures who are constantly in action\n40:53 Comment: This is Mrun Fernandes, this is Muriel, this is Collarella\n41:4 Comment: Good attacking group\n41:7 Comment: At Samdoria\n41:7 Comment: Of course, anomalies look\n41:10 Comment: More precisely, it already looked\n41:12 Comment: This is a dry

the ball in the center\n41:32 Comment: Fazio\n41:34 Comment: Rüdiger\n41:37 Comment: Nain gola an\n41:38 Comment: To whom will the transfer be made next?\n41:40 Comment: Bruno Perez connects on the right flank\n41:42 Comment: There are two against him here\n41:44 Comment: We need to look for help\n41:46 Comment: Derosi\n41:47 Comment: But that one is covered too\n41:49 Comment: Raja slightly

and Sylvester, of course, helped this fall with a little hand\n43:6 Comment: lean more heavily on Paula Matsulini and the football players Dori himself proves that gender is not\n43:16 Comment: In general, for their part, the Romans probably could have undertaken to prove that this is not easy\n43:21 Comment: a foul is also a foul on the card, but they did not persist in this; it is enough for them that there is a free kick\n43:27 Comment: a minute and a few more seconds before the end of the first half at the sword of Daniel Derosi\n43:36 Comment: the movement of the goal area began there, the serve and Rudiger knocked it in or not, flicked the ball away, joni\n43:47 Comment: here, too, there is something to tell him; Matsulini shows that there was a violation of the rules and\n43:57 Comment: in any case this ball would not have counted Rudiger\n44:6 Comment: Strotman and Bruno Perez don't understand each other\n44:15 Comment: interesting moment with Rüdiger's turn kick, it would certainly be interesting to look at it again\n44:24 Comment: by the eye of the camera located on the side of the goal, but it doesn’t matter if a big score was preceded\n44:33 Comment: such an unfair fight means this blow\n44:36 Comment: does not have a serious meaning and only 5-6 seconds added to the first half Paula Matzoulini gives\n44:44 Comment: whistle, but after all, this is the camera

this slowness, this calmness of the team.\n8:8 Comment: This is really such a deep fundamental awareness that Roma is stronger.\n8:14 Comment: Or there are simply no really fresh ideas yet on exactly how to blow up the situation.\n8:19 Comment: AND...\n8:20 Comment: Take more initiative, play on the attack.\n8:25 Comment: It seems to me that it makes sense to talk about this specifically in relation to Roma now, because Doria himself does not show any interesting attacking play at all after the break.\n8:42 Comment: Muriel was demolished once.\n8:46 Comment: This can, of course, be considered an aggravation, but...\n8:50 Comment: But that's not all, of course.\n8:52 Comment: That's not all, of course.\n8:53 Comment: But that's not all, of course.\n8:55 Comment: This mechanism,

talking about spare parts.\n10:19 Comment: Roma, Sandori and with them also Napoli.\n10:22 Comment: Three teams with the most successful substitutions in this tournament.\n10:28 Comment: In these

has increased, at least throwing the ball into someone else’s penalty area with a sleepy defender.\n12:29 Comment: He clearly worked on this component in the locker room during the break.\n12:33 Comment: Indicating to his people that they need to use this more often.\n12:36 Comment: We know how to do this.\n12:37 Comment: Let's throw it in, let's throw it in.\n12:41 Comment: The corner earned.\n13:4 Comment: Not a very good presentation.\n13:6 Comment: It came out from Perotti.\n13:8 Comment: Maybe the repeat pass in the penalty area will work better.\n13:11 Comment: Emerson tried to fulfill it.\n13:13 Comment: No, this is Bruno Perez.\n13:14 Comment: Sorry, I didn't succeed either.\n13:28 Comment: Perotti.\n13:32 Comment: Nain Gulan.\n13:32 Comment: Nain Gulan is waiting.\n13:35 Comment: Return pass from him.\n13:37 Comment: And here he is to be at the ball early.\n13:41 Comment: Bruno Fernandes, according to the judge, violates the rules.\n13:48 Comment: Fernandes shows something to Nain Gulan.\n13:50 Comment: For now it just looks like drool.\n13:53 Comment: There doesn't seem to be any blood there.\n13:59 Comment: I don't know, maybe he has such impressive drool,\n14:2 Comment: that Nain Gulan will immediately shut up and admit that he was wrong.\n14:8 Comment: Meanwhile, Pujoni gets a yellow.\n14:11 Comment: And so, as a rule, he stood on this card.\n14:13 Comment: For wasting time.\n14:15 Comment: What a nuisance.\n14:17 Comment: Yes, it’s a pity that Sandori couldn’t match herself in the second half.\n14:18 Comment: Sample of the first half.\n14:19 Comment: Fifth.\n14:21 Comment: And so, as you can see, this is not the case.\n14:23 Comment: This is wrong.\n14:41 Comment: This is a bit strange.\n14:43 Comment: We saw Gian Paulo come out for the second half so inspired.\n14:45 Comment: Offside here.\n14:47 Comment: And it was clear in the facial expressions of head coach Sandori that his team was playing interesting football with a strong opponent.\n14:58 Comment: Got started.\n15:0 Comment: There are some original moves of our own.\n15:3 Comment: There are pieces that Roma players clearly do not handle well.\n15:7 Comment: Doesn't play the way he plays.\n15:9 Comment: Doesn't play like he did in the first half in genauERRAS.\n15:12 Comment: Doesn't play like he did in the first half\n15:34 Comment: Paula.\n15:35 Comment: The first replacement will apparently take place in Sandori's camp.\n15:54 Comment: And Carl Linnity will appear on the field.\n15:58 Comment: The football player who...\n15:59 Comment: We had to wait in the starting lineup.\n16:6 Comment: But Giampaula decided to hold him back to strengthen the game.\n16:12 Comment: Now Sandori definitely needs a new impetus.\n16:18 Comment: Here he is, Carl Linnity.\n16:21 Comment: He has number 16.\n16:24 Comment: And he replaces Denis Prat, the scorer of the goal.\n16:29 Comment: Who made a strong impression in the first half.\n16:34 Comment: And in the second, together with the entire attack group, Sandori was invisible.\n16:44 Comment: Linnity, 21 years old.\n16:46 Comment: He plays his first season in Serie A.\n16:48 Comment: After 4 years he started early.\n16:59 Comment: He played leading roles in Poznań Lech.\n17:13 Comment: Must add speakers now.\n17:18 Comment: Motor skills.\n17:20 Comment: But for now Roma has the ball.\n17:22 Comment: Strotman's serve.\n17:24 Comment: And the blow from Rajin Ingulan.\n17:26 Comment: Such shots often become goals.\n17:29 Comment: And if Ingulan gets past the goalkeeper.\n17:31 Comment: Here he landed exactly in Pujoni.\n17:34 Comment: What a great position to score.\n17:36 Comment: And it hits the goalkeeper straight.\n17:38 Comment: Now Raja.\n17:40 Comment: But he simply forgives his opponent.\n17:48 Comment: Pujoni is also great.\n17:50 Comment: Guessed where he should position himself.\n17:52 Comment: Sandori has three shots on target.\n17:54 Comment: Five for Roma.\n17:56 Comment: And here he is.\n17:57 Comment: Out of nine attempts.\n17:59 Comment: Each team has nine attempts.\n18:0 Comment: With blows.\n18:2 Comment: Here it is already clear that Roma has begun to surpass its opponent.\n18:8 Comment: Well, by the way, this may happen.\n18:11 Comment: What if we put aside emotions and look at dry numbers.\n18:18 Comment: That with all, perhaps, not the strongest impression from the game on Ingulan.\n18:24 Comment: But, of course, that's not all.\n18:25 Comment: That's not all.\n18:26 Comment: Рwl-г migun Mars.\n18:27 Comment:

Comment: Six Roma players and one Muriel\n19:57 Comment: Hopeless story\n20:1 Comment: Well, here Chensny is again literally on the verge of risk\n20:5 Comment: On the very edge\n20:9 Comment: Has stopped\n20:11 Comment: He threw the ball\n20:12 Comment: He passed teasingly in front of Collarella's nose.\n20:17 Comment: It seemed like stretch your leg and the ball would be yours\n20:21 Comment: Perotti\n20:23 Comment: Emerson\n20:25 Comment: Pass, kick and goal\n20:27 Comment: That's it, here's Roma, please\n20:33 Comment: Calm, cool, you know, here\n20:37 Comment: What characterizes this team, as it seems to me?\n20:40 Comment: No major changes in heart rate\n20:43 Comment: Scored\n20:44 Comment: Pulse is even\n20:45 Comment: Missed it\n20:46 Comment: Even more equal\n20:48 Comment: We need to stretch out the game, take points\n20:50 Comment: Calmly\n20:51 Comment: At your working level\n20:54 Comment: Find an option\n20:57 Comment: Here we found it\n20:57 Comment: I don’t know how to evaluate Johnny’s performance here.\n21:1 Comment: Of course, the near corner is so offensive\n21:4 Comment: He launches this ball\n21:5 Comment: Somehow he\n21:7 Comment: I would like to say that it turned out awkwardly\n21:10 Comment: But it will be\n21:11 Comment: Gross violation\n21:13 Comment: Rules of the Russian language\n21:16 Comment: But really\n21:17 Comment: The goalkeeper looked awkward\n21:21 Comment: Trying to stop this blow\n21:23 Comment: Edina Dzeko\n21:24 Comment: And here is the 66th minute\n21:27 Comment: Roma takes the lead\n21:28 Comment: And here is the 66th minute\n21:29 Comment: Roma takes the lead\n21:29 Comment: 15th ball\n21:43 Comment: Edina Dzeko\n21:44 Comment: This season\n21:51 Comment: 3rd, all this etaol is tenting\n21:52 Comment: And this is danger\n21:54 Comment: It means that\n21:55 Comment: Yes, sure\n21:56 Comment: Yuri\n21:56 Comment: Yuriado\n21:57 Comment: lio\n21:57 Comment: That Dzeko broke equality with Higuain and Belotti.\n22:8 Comment: This group of football players had 14.\n22:11 Comment: And now, by the way, let's see how the matter ends.\n22:14 Comment: Perotti delayed the transfer.\n22:17 Comment: I danced here.\n22:18 Comment: And in the end the ball was lost.\n22:22 Comment: Mauro Icardi from Inter and one Dzeko now.\n22:25 Comment: Here is a bunch of the best scorers of the Italian series.\n22:28 Comment: Oh, both have 15 goals scored.\n22:32 Comment: But Icardi and his Inter finished their match against Piscara.\n22:39 Comment: And Dzeko still has time.\n22:41 Comment: He's still on the field.\n22:44 Comment: To become the best sniper today for some time.\n22:48 Comment: Current tournament.\n22:52 Comment: By the way, there is something else to do with Piscara.\n22:54 Comment: You have to forget enough.\n22:55 Comment: Added history.\n22:56 Comment: This flashed at Marco Giampaolo's press conference.\n23:0 Comment: He said that it is not necessary to lose the match against Roma.\n23:4 Comment: Just like the match against Piscara is not at all necessary to win.\n23:8 Comment: In this case, using Piscara as a synonym for a team that is, well, completely weak.\n23:14 Comment: If you don’t beat Piscara, it’s kind of a shame.\n23:17 Comment: Well, Piscara is really in last place.\n23:25 Comment: Oh, how Luciana worries from the fields.\n23:27 Comment: He finally took off his coat, which he couldn’t figure out what was in the inner pockets.\n23:35 Comment: Piscara fell under the pressure of Inter.\n23:40 Comment: Having conceded three unanswered goals.\n23:42 Comment: But Cardi didn’t score either, which is typical.\n23:44 Comment: We have a new replacement here.\n23:47 Comment: Another player from the attacking group leaves the field.\n23:51 Comment: Dory himself.\n23:53 Comment: In this case, Bruno Fernandes.\n23:55 Comment: Gone.\n23:58 Comment: And Linniti appeared on the field after the Pole.\n24:4 Comment: Another Slavic midfielder.\n24:7 Comment: More precisely, even striker Patrick Schick.\n24:14 Comment: Another 21 year old player.\n24:20 Comment: There's a bet on youth.\n24:22 Comment: So.\n24:25 Comment: And the first thing that happened was that Chic fell in someone else’s penalty area.\n24:28 Comment: Clinging to someone's leg.\n24:31 Comment: But.\n24:36 Comment: Although there is Chic.\n24:38 Comment: There is no shine or beauty yet.\n24:43 Comment: But this is just the beginning.\n24:45 Comment: 70th minute.\n24:50 Comment: Maybe these Mishka replacements will liven up the game.\n24:53 Comment: Linnity will eventually be able to weave himself into the fabric of the midfield game now.\n24:59 Comment: And Chic will show himself in something.\n25:2 Comment: Here you are!\n25:3 Comment: Ho-ho-ho-ho!\n25:6 Comment: Hey boy!\n25:10 Comment: Almost the first touch.\n25:12 Comment: Patrick Chic!\n25:14 Comment: Fully lives up to the name.\n25:17 Comment: Entering the field.\n25:18 Comment: Scores his fifth goal of the season.\n25:20 Comment: This is the Joker.\n25:22 Comment: The score becomes 2-2.\n25:24 Comment: None other than Daniel Edrosi is being pushed by this young man here.\n25:32 Comment: And by the way, Luis Murel chalks up the second assist of the match.\n25:38 Comment: He assisted Denis Prat in the first half.\n25:46 Comment: And it was from his head, from the Colombian’s head, that the ball flew to Patrick Chic.\n25:52 Comment: The subscriber is now only on the third ball.\n25:53 Comment: And he is looking.\n25:54 Comment: Interesting.\n25:55 Comment: 2-2.\n25:56 Comment: Let me remind you that in the first round they played 3-2.\n26:0 Comment: Roma also managed to win by one goal in such an intriguing match.\n26:2 Comment: It is very likely that a similar and analogous scenario could be realized today.\n26:8 Comment: And maybe it will be implemented.\n26:10 Comment: And we will have such a productive draw.\n26:16 Comment: This is certainly not part of Luciano Spalletti's plans.\n26:20 Comment: Denis Murel.\n26:21 Comment: It will look like losing points\n26:26 Comment: Although, you know, in a game like this, the way it develops\n26:28 Comment: For Roma, victory will be an unconditional acquisition of points\n26:32 Comment: Because today, in fact, the opponent is very difficult for the Romans\n26:36 Comment: Roma takes a corner\n26:38 Comment: Rudiger's shot fails\n26:39 Comment: Chic catches the ball\n26:41 Comment: Chic passes by Nain Gulan\n26:44 Comment: And flies further at cruising speed\n26:47 Comment: But it's time to part with the ball, because there Rudiger overtook\n26:50 Comment: However, it's not just Rudiger, it's also a yellow card\n27:3 Comment: Yes, I saw Paulo Matsoleni's violation\n27:6 Comment: Listen, what a chic\n27:10 Comment: Don't know\n27:12 Comment: Perhaps if I were the referee, I wouldn’t show the yellow card\n27:17 Comment: Ugh\n27:20 Comment: Paulo unconvincing, chic\n27:22 Comment: In my opinion, there was no violation at all\n27:26 Comment: But, apparently, the referee is also impressed by what kind of player appeared in this game\n27:33 Comment: This chic just radiates confidence all around.\n27:37 Comment: And submits himself to his will\n27:41 Comment: Moure! Wow, Mouret!\n27:43 Comment: Oh, yes goal!\n27:46 Comment: Louis Mouret! Penalty kick falls over\n27:48 Comment: Incredible!\n27:50 Comment: Incredible ball!\n27:53 Comment: Third point according to the scoring system - goal plus pass for the Colombian striker\n27:59 Comment: Two passes and a goal!\n28:1 Comment: But this is a goal that needs some kind of enhancing prefix or ending\n28:9 Comment: Although here, of course, it’s all about ricochet\n28:13 Comment: What we are convinced of as a result of repetitions\n28:17 Comment: Yes, there was a rebound, but this does not detract from the beauty of the force\n28:20 Comment: Impact Power Forces\n28:22 Comment: And, of course, it does not in any way affect the degree to which this goal is counted.\n28:27 Comment: 3-2! Samdori takes the lead!\n28:29 Comment: Ugh! Indeed, this match is not at all similar to the defeat ten days ago\n28:42 Comment: Which Roma committed Samdori, winning 4-0\n28:46 Comment: Now we already have...\n28:50 Comment: The result of the first round match was just turned on its head\n28:55 Comment: Samdori, who hasn’t won for almost two months\n29:1 Comment: Now, finally, we are in the position of a team that is close to winning three points\n29:10 Comment: Yes, there is still a giant time handicap for Roma\n29:15 Comment: The most experienced Roma to score even more than one goal\n29:20 Comment: But Samdori, look how it has blossomed\n29:24 Comment: It seemed to me that already, having looked at the game in the first 15 minutes of the second half, I made this conclusion\n29:33 Comment: That's all Samdori, she stayed there in the first half, she ended\n29:37 Comment: And nothing good awaits us anymore\n29:39 Comment: But...\n29:42 Comment: Managed to surprise Genoa\n29:44 Comment: These replacements are amazing\n29:49 Comment: First of all, exit...\n29:50 Comment: As it turns out, Chic did his job\n29:53 Comment: Chic, coming out, scores with almost the first touch, leveling the score\n30:1 Comment: Then he earns this free kick, from which Muriel scores\n30:4 Comment: Let the free kick\n30:7 Comment: The very fact of his appointment may seem controversial\n30:12 Comment: But Chic did it\n30:14 Comment: Result Man\n30:20 Comment: And the sharpness of his output, his game is comparable to the razor accessories of the same name, it should be noted\n30:39 Comment: well\n30:41 Comment: Samdori and her sudden, at least for me\n30:49 Comment: Razor Chance\n30:50 Comment: Heyday\n30:53 Comment: Before the last one\n30:55 Comment: 15 minute gaming\n30:58 Comment: What\n30:59 Comment: Does Roma think to himself?\n31:4 Comment: First of all, does Luciano Spalletti even have substitute players?\n31:8 Comment: How does he intend to argue with the world?\n31:10 Comment: Let's see who's here\n31:11 Comment: There is Leandro Paredes\n31:14 Comment: There is Francesco Totti\n31:16 Comment: Mustafa Sek\n31:19 Comment: Alison\n31:20 Comment: Mario Rui\n31:21 Comment: Gerson\n31:22 Comment: Kostas Manolas\n31:24 Comment: And Stefan El Sharawi\n31:25 Comment: But it will appear on the field\n31:27 Comment: Francesco Totti\n31:38 Comment: Right now, after this whistle\n31:40 Comment: Legendary\n31:42 Comment: 40 year old\n31:44 Comment: Human\n31:46 Comment: By the way, together with Stefan El Sharawi\n31:49 Comment: Steps on the football players\n31:50 Comment: To the football field\n31:51 Comment: So instead of Bruno Perez\n31:56 Comment: Who opened an account today\n31:57 Comment: Stephan El Sharawi comes out\n32:0 Comment: Totti took part in the match against Udinese\n32:9 Comment: Two weeks ago\n32:14 Comment: Now he has replaced Daniel Desrosy\n32:16 Comment: And at the same time I took it from him\n32:19 Comment: Captain's armband\n32:20 Comment: Obviously\n32:21 Comment: Legend\n32:32 Comment: well\n32:33 Comment: Maybe he's destined\n32:36 Comment: Today somehow\n32:38 Comment: Influence the fate of the match\n32:40 Comment: In Serie A of the current season\n32:44 Comment: Francesco Totti scored two goals\n32:46 Comment: They suffered from it\n32:49 Comment: By the way, Sabdore\n32:50 Comment: And Torino\n32:53 Comment: But both goals that Totti scored\n32:56 Comment: Crowded\n32:57 Comment: Back in September last year\n33:0 Comment: I haven't been different for a long time\n33:2 Comment: In the Italian championship\n33:3 Comment: Interesting\n33:10 Comment: A unique and intriguing ending awaits us.\n33:13 Comment: AND\n33:14 Comment: Here of course\n33:16 Comment: Dory himself\n33:19 Comment: Already\n33:20 Comment: Now\n33:20 Comment: I'm afraid someone will kidnap me\n33:23 Comment: Now that's inspiring leadership.\n33:25 Comment: Someone may now encroach on\n33:27 Comment: This one is still virtual\n33:30 Comment: Undeclared victory\n33:32 Comment: Now they will all be on their feet there\n33:34 Comment: They will jump\n33:35 Comment: Emotions will be poured out\n33:38 Comment: For every occasion\n33:39 Comment: Yes, Faco is there, apparently\n33:45 Comment: Worked a little with my elbow\n33:47 Comment: Got it\n33:48 Comment: And this is how we see\n33:49 Comment: In this case\n33:50 Comment: Temple\n33:51 Comment: Fabio Quagliarelli\n33:52 Comment: It's a pity that Derosi left\n33:58 Comment: Such a galaxy of wonderful veterans\n33:59 Comment: I would be on the field at the same time right now\n34:1 Comment: Derosi, Totti, Quagliarella\n34:3 Comment: Something of\n34:4 Comment: Italian team\n34:7 Comment: A sample from a completely different era\n34:10 Comment: So, free kick\n34:12 Comment: In the spotlight, of course, is Patrick Schick\n34:14 Comment: We already know\n34:16 Comment: What kind of things can he do?\n34:21 Comment: Football players\n34:21 Comment: Muriel\n34:22 Comment: Most successful football player\n34:24 Comment: And, according to statistics\n34:26 Comment: By bare numbers\n34:27 Comment: Best player of today's match\n34:29 Comment: Involved in all goals scored\n34:31 Comment: Your team\n34:33 Comment: Rüdiger grabs the necks\n34:38 Comment: To what extent is he capable of doing this, of course?\n34:41 Comment: Rüdiger\n34:42 Comment: Grabs the necks\n34:46 Comment: To what extent is he capable of doing this, of course?\n34:50 Comment: There will be a corner.\n34:53 Comment: Dory himself needs a good, accurate, clear presentation.\n34:58 Comment: Torreira will try to provide for her.\n35:2 Comment: And until it comes to blows, Muriel makes the discount.\n35:7 Comment: Hit.\n35:7 Comment: There is no ricochet.\n35:10 Comment: Lapel.\n35:13 Comment: Shchensky may not be in a particular hurry.\n35:14 Comment: But generally speaking, of course, Roma should hurry up.\n35:20 Comment: Let me remind you that the Romans do not know defeat.\n35:32 Comment: Since December 17 last year.\n35:35 Comment: Well, that is...\n35:38 Comment: It's the fifth match now.\n35:45 Comment: Without a hint.\n35:47 Comment: Even a draw for them.\n35:49 Comment: They didn't miss it before.\n35:50 Comment: Nothing.\n35:51 Comment: And then we immediately got three goals in one game.\n36:6 Comment: This could be Roma's fifth defeat.\n36:11 Comment: This season the team has lost to Fiorentina, Torino, Atalanta and Juventus.\n36:20 Comment: But lately, when they won, they didn’t have time.\n36:21 Comment: And it's just...\n36:23 Comment: It's simple...\n36:24 Comment: The ball flies towards the target.\n36:26 Comment: But not so that Edin would break into the position of the best sniper in Serie A.\n36:36 Comment: Apparently, it’s enough for him that he equaled Icardi today.\n36:46 Comment: Fazio.\n36:50 Comment: Stratman.\n36:54 Comment: Turns the game and the ball to the right flank.\n36:58 Comment: It is tough.\n37:0 Comment: He puts his foot down very hard.\n37:1 Comment: In opposition to him.\n37:14 Comment: Erin Ginny.\n37:17 Comment: And he meets again.\n37:19 Comment: Perotti.\n37:20 Comment: And the ball flies.\n37:22 Comment: No, in the field for now.\n37:25 Comment: Stays in the game.\n37:27 Comment: Boretto.\n37:28 Comment: Without looking, he kicks it out into Chic's area.\n37:34 Comment: Where he should be.\n37:39 Comment: By the way, it is interesting that Chic is located in the position that Bruno Fernandes occupied.\n37:45 Comment: That is, this is, in essence, a position under the attackers.\n37:47 Comment: But a couple of forwards remained.\n37:50 Comment: Unchangeable in its location.\n37:52 Comment: Quagliarella and Muriel are also ahead.\n37:55 Comment: On ingulan.\n37:56 Comment: Original pass.\n37:57 Comment: El Sharawi.\n37:59 Comment: But it doesn't hit exactly.\n38:2 Comment: Stefan El Sharawi.\n38:3 Comment: Turn.\n38:10 Comment: Third substitution for Sandori.\n38:13 Comment: Luis Muriel went out.\n38:15 Comment: The best Luis Muriel.\n38:18 Comment: Of all those who are playing now.\n38:20 Comment: Football.\n38:21 Comment: On this planet.\n38:24 Comment: Well, jokes aside, he played a great match today.\n38:27 Comment: Two assists and a goal.\n38:29 Comment: Possibly victorious.\n38:33 Comment: Filip Djuricic appeared on the field instead of Muriel.\n38:41 Comment: Serbian midfielder.\n38:42 Comment: Football player.\n38:50 Comment: A football player who loves to travel.\n38:52 Comment: In addition to Serbia, he played in the Netherlands, Portugal,\n38:58 Comment: Bundesliga, Premier League, Belgium.\n39:4 Comment: And now he is here.\n39:6 Comment: Jacko!\n39:7 Comment: So what, is this a goal?\n39:8 Comment: Where does the additional judge end up?\n39:10 Comment: In my opinion, there is a suspicion of offside.\n39:14 Comment: Confirmed.\n39:16 Comment: Yes.\n39:17 Comment: At the moment of passing.\n39:18 Comment: Francesco Totti.\n39:20 Comment: By the way, he gave the transmission.\n39:22 Comment: Edin Dzeko was in position in Nigra.\n39:24 Comment: But still, let's applaud Francesco Totti.\n39:28 Comment: Still, this guy’s offside, you know, that’s not a problem.\n39:32 Comment: Totti.\n39:33 Comment: A?\n39:34 Comment: And Francesco is also...\n39:36 Comment: He is a captain himself, he knows that sometimes the bandages slip off the sleeve for a while.\n39:41 Comment: And long-lasting ones.\n39:43 Comment: And now he helped the judge to fix his vibrating bandage.\n39:48 Comment: But this same offside is not there!\n39:50 Comment: El Sharawi enters the penalty area.\n39:52 Comment: It hits with a turn.\n39:53 Comment: Pujo doesn't get that ball out.\n39:55 Comment: But Dzeko picks it up.\n39:57 Comment: Keeps the intrigue.\n39:58 Comment: And only now Boretto is ousting the Bastian.\n40:1 Comment: And they drop it there with joint efforts.\n40:4 Comment: Together with the defender who arrived in time.\n40:12 Comment: Yes, it was Borischinsky and Boretto here.\n40:16 Comment: Penalty.\n40:17 Comment: Francesco Totti delivers this standard.\n40:20 Comment: We will once again applaud his pass, which should have been a goal if Dzeko had opened up a little more restrainedly.\n40:27 Comment: By now Totti would have had an assist.\n40:30 Comment: And Jack would have had 16 goals for the season.\n40:33 Comment: OK.\n40:35 Comment: The next episode is before us.\n40:37 Comment: The picture changes with the speed of a kaleidoscope.\n40:41 Comment: There is only one person holding her now.\n40:44 Comment: On this planet this is it.\n40:46 Comment: Paolo Matsoleni, who went into the midst of the players to investigate.\n40:48 Comment: Arrange the figures.\n40:49 Comment: Francesco Totti.\n40:51 Comment: We enjoy every second of his time on the football field and in this great game.\n40:55 Comment: Feed into the penalty area.\n40:57 Comment: Very clever.\n40:59 Comment: To strike El Shaarawy.\n41:0 Comment: The ball bounced to Fermalin, who also remained offside.\n41:3 Comment: Like this.\n41:4 Comment: Offside is an annoying, but nevertheless necessary thing in football.\n41:11 Comment: Preventing Francesco Totti's talent from shining.\n41:15 Comment: He also has nothing to do with this offside.\n41:19 Comment: The captain's idea was to provide the ball to El Shaarawy.\n41:23 Comment: And El Shaarawy was at a point in the penalty area where everyone forgot about him.\n41:28 Comment: And no one needed him there.\n41:30 Comment: If El Shaarawy had hit the goal from there, he could have scored.\n41:33 Comment: So, Paredos, despite all the rumors of talk about his imminent separation from the team, comes out.\n41:39 Comment: Maybe this is the last thing, by the way.\n41:41 Comment: And for his last five minutes he comes out to play.\n41:44 Comment: Luciano Spalletti takes risks.\n41:46 Comment: He has now taken Thomas French out of the game.\n41:49 Comment: And now he has embarked on Len's farm.\n41:51 Comment: Thus, whoever is left in the bench is defending in the center of the Fazio field alone now.\n41:58 Comment: In general, only Rüdiger went to the flank.\n42:0 Comment: But the other flank has now pulled back, leaving Emerson behind.\n42:4 Comment: He turned into a defender.\n42:10 Comment: But Paredos, of course, will act closer to the attack.\n42:16 Comment: Now he is still at his gates.\n42:19 Comment: But he doesn't leave.\n42:20 Comment: He's leaving.\n42:22 Comment: El Sharari.\n42:23 Comment: In place, the left edge will go forward.\n42:26 Comment: Beat your opponent.\n42:28 Comment: But what has he done now?\n42:32 Comment: This is not a pass, not a shot on goal.\n42:37 Comment: The team expected more from Stefan now.\n42:43 Comment: Bereschinsky was simply removed from his path.\n42:46 Comment: He was no longer in the way of anything or anyone.\n42:49 Comment: But El Sharari handled the ball poorly.\n42:56 Comment: I asked Skriner to take a goal kick now.\n42:59 Comment: Put Johnny.\n43:1 Comment: Let me remind you that goalkeeper Samduri has a yellow card for wasting time.\n43:5 Comment: And by the way, he is acting strangely here.\n43:8 Comment: For an experienced goalkeeper, 36 years old, he must understand perfectly well that no one will ever show a second yellow card to a goalkeeper for delaying time.\n43:17 Comment: Therefore, you can drag it out as long as you like.\n43:19 Comment: I could take this same goal kick on my own and not be afraid of anything.\n43:23 Comment: But maybe some kind of microtrauma is preventing him.\n43:25 Comment: There was a fall here.\n43:27 Comment: Yes, Paredes was knocked over.\n43:29 Comment: With some delay, but still Romeo was allowed to play this standard.\n43:34 Comment: But apparently we need to do it again, because the ball was rolling.\n43:39 Comment: Paredes again.\n43:41 Comment: Totti was relieved of this duty.\n43:43 Comment: Paredes.\n43:45 Comment: This is mainly for his precise forward passes.\n43:51 Comment: Spalletti replaced Fermalin with Leandro.\n43:56 Comment: The game began with long ones, with spear strikes, rather than dagger strikes.\n44:9 Comment: But, by the way, what a breakthrough it turns out to be.\n44:11 Comment: And... the ball doesn't go into the goal.\n44:14 Comment: What a drama!\n44:15 Comment: Djuricic could now bury Roma and ensure victory for his team.\n44:19 Comment: Complete everything in this match in the 90th minute.\n44:25 Comment: Incredible.\n44:26 Comment: There, such a pass went across the entire field.\n44:28 Comment: And Djuricic turned out to be not offside.\n44:31 Comment: And he removed Paredes on the swing.\n44:33 Comment: But further, well, literally under the armpit.\n44:36 Comment: Probably old-fashioned in some things.\n44:39 Comment: Voytsekhschenstvenny and...\n44:42 Comment: AND...\n44:43 Comment: The ball didn't go through there.\n44:45 Comment: Something was literally stopped by a hair's breadth.\n44:49 Comment: Fabulous.

    "summary": "In a thrilling encounter at Luigi Ferraris Stadium, Sampdoria edged out Roma with a final score of 3-2, showcasing a match filled with dramatic twists and turns.\n\nFrom the first whistle, the game was evenly matched. Both teams demonstrated early vigor in their gameplay. Luciano Spalletti, Roma's coach, acknowledged the inherent challenges of playing against Sampdoria, particularly a team managed by Marco Giampaolo. Giampaolo himself commented on the difficulties his team faces, particularly in attack completion. Despite these concerns, he affirmed his confidence in Sampdoria's organization and gameplay.\n\nThe game began with a fast pace, with no decisive opportunities in the opening minutes, showcasing a fair share of possession and attempts from both sides. The first goal came swiftly, with Roma capitalizing on an early opportunity. Bruno Perez netted the ball in the 4th minute after a sequence of decisive plays catching Sampdoria's defense off-guard. The ball rebounded off Christian Puggioni’s hands, leaving Perez with an open target, which he took advantage of promptly, putting Roma ahead 1-0.\n\nDespite conceding the early goal, Sampdoria remained spirited. They consistently pressed forward with their attacking trio of Fabio Quagliarella, Luis Muriel, and Denis Praet. Their efforts paid off in the 21st minute when Denis Praet, assisted by Muriel, found the back of the net. Muriel's intricate play on the flanks and a well-timed cross provided Praet the perfect opportunity to level the score. This goal resonated as a significant moment for Sampdoria, who had struggled to find the net in recent games, marking a turnaround in their form.\n\nThe game continued with high intensity, and both teams created chances. Roma's experienced squad, including players like Edin Dzeko and Radja Nainggolan, maintained a structured attack, looking for gaps in Sampdoria's defense. In contrast, Sampdoria's play was characterized by rapid transitions and vertical play, often catching Roma on the counter.\n\nEntering the second half, the game was finely balanced. Both sides refrained from making any substitutions initially, opting to continue with their starting XI. Roma had slightly more possession in the first half, but Sampdoria had made more attacking moves, setting the stage for a compelling second half.\n\nAs the game resumed, Sampdoria showed signs of pressing higher up the pitch, attempting to dismantle Roma's defense. However, it was Roma who struck first in the second half. In the 66th minute, Edin Dzeko managed to break through Sampdoria’s defense with a well-placed shot that found the back of the net. Puggioni’s attempt to save was in vain, as Dzeko's strike from the near post outwitted him, putting Roma ahead 2-1. This was Dzeko's 15th goal of the season, making him one of the top scorers in Serie A at that moment.\n\nThe dynamics of the game shifted dramatically after Roma’s goal. Marco Giampaolo made strategic substitutions to inject fresh energy into his team. Notably, he brought on Patrick Schick, a young talented striker, to bolster Sampdoria's attack. Schick's introduction had an immediate impact. In the 70th minute, almost with his first touch of the ball, Schick scored, leveling the match at 2-2. His goal was set up brilliantly by Luis Muriel, who provided the assist, marking his second of the match.\n\nThe momentum favored Sampdoria, and their confidence soared. This newfound energy was exemplified by Muriel, who was having an outstanding game. In the 73rd minute, Muriel himself netted a goal, giving Sampdoria a 3-2 lead. His powerful strike benefitted from a slight deflection, but it was a testament to his skill and tenacity throughout the match. This goal was followed by wild celebrations from Sampdoria's fans and players, representing a significant moment for a team that had been struggling for victories.\n\nRoma, now trailing, sought to regain control. Spalletti responded by bringing on veterans like Francesco Totti and Stefan El Shaarawy in an attempt to resurrect his team’s chances. Totti’s introduction, in particular, brought fresh hope and energy to Roma. His pinpoint passing and tactical acumen were evident as he tried to orchestrate plays from the midfield.\n\nWith the game entering its final stages, the urgency from Roma was palpable. They pushed forward relentlessly, creating several scoring opportunities. In the 90th minute, Filip Djuricic could have sealed the game for Sampdoria, but his attempt was brilliantly saved by Roma's goalkeeper, Wojciech Szczesny. This crucial save kept Roma’s hopes alive.\n\nDespite intense efforts, Roma couldn't find the equalizer. Sampdoria's defense held firm, and their resilience was commendable. The final whistle confirmed a hard-fought victory for Sampdoria, a much-needed win that injected life into their Serie A campaign.\n\nThe statistics of the match highlighted the competitive nature of the game. Both teams had an equal number of attempts, but Sampdoria managed to convert more of their chances effectively. Roma's possession play was slightly dominant, but Sampdoria's counter-attacking strategy paid off.\n\nIn summary, the match was a showcase of tactical ingenuity, individual brilliance, and sheer determination from both sides. Sampdoria's ability to bounce back from adversity and secure a win against a formidable opponent like Roma was a testament to their potential and fighting spirit. This victory marked an end to their winless streak and breathed new life into their season, while Roma was left to reflect on what might have been a missed opportunity to close the gap at the top of the table."
