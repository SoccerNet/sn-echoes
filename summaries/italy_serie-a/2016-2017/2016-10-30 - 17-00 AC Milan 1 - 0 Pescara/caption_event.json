    "summary": "AC Milan and Pescara clashed in an engaging battle that saw its fair share of highs and lows. Below is the detailed description of the match based on the events and moments that occurred during this gripping encounter.\n\n### First Half:\n\nAt the San Siro, the atmosphere was electric as AC Milan kicked off the match. Just a mere 13 seconds into the game, the ball was already out of play, signaling early signs of a tightly contested match. Pescara quickly won a throw-in but lost possession soon after.\n\nWithin the first five minutes, both teams exchanged possession numerous times, showing signs of nerves and eagerness to assert dominance. However, it was Pescara that managed to make the first goal attempt in the 4th minute with a shot off target. The pressure didn't let up as AC Milan committed a foul in the 5th minute, giving Pescara an indirect free-kick.\n\nIn response, AC Milan won an indirect free-kick two minutes later. The match seemed to be a chess game played on the field with neither side willing to give in.\n\nIn the 10th minute, Pescara managed to create a significant chance as Ahmad Benali served up a difficult cross that forced goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma to punch the ball away, resulting in a corner. When Alberto Aquilani took the corner, Ledian Memushaj had a brief moment of brilliance, managing to get a shot on target which Donnarumma saved. \n\nAC Milan slowly began to find their footing. In the 12th minute, Alessandro Crescenzi connected with a shot that went towards the roof of the net but was brilliantly saved by Donnarumma. The tempo of the game was steadily increasing. Pescara forced another corner before AC Milan gained some relief.\n\nJust a few minutes later, the home side launched a fierce attack leading to a corner kick. M'Baye Niang's pass was cut out, but Giacomo Bonaventura's execution of the corner was foiled by Pescara’s defense.\n\nIntense midfield duels characterized the next few minutes, with AC Milan pressing forward. In the 14th minute, Mattia De Sciglio sent a pass into the box which was quickly cleared, and Bonaventura’s follow-up shot was saved by Pescara’s goalkeeper Albano Bizzarri.\n\nPressure points alternated between both teams with fouls occurring on either side, exemplifying the rough nature of the match as players battled for control. Niang's free-kick in the 16th minute was taken well but did not bear fruit.\n\nCarlos Bacca, who was particularly active, saw his effort collected easily by Bizzarri in the 16th. As the half progressed, Caprari found himself offside, showing the visitors’ inclination to press forward.\n\nThe defensive grit from both squads was also on display. Pescara gained multiple throw-ins, and AC Milan defenders such as Sosa were crucial in intercepting potential threats. Gaston Brugman from Pescara required medical treatment around the 25-minute mark, ironically becoming an early setback for the team.\n\nNiang and Bacca were pivotal to Milan's attacking strategy, with Niang narrowly missing several goal-scoring chances. By the 30th minute, a memorable attempt by Niang saw the ball soar into the stands right after he used brilliant footwork to navigate past defenders, yet failed to score.\n\nPescara pressed high, Memushaj at one moment found the net, but it was ruled out for offside. The first half continued in the same tug of war, both teams failing to make decisive blows. Crosses from Memushaj and Caprari proved unsuccessful, with the defensive units of both sides being impressively alert.\n\nAs the first half drew to a close, Bonaventura repeatedly found himself in critical scoring positions but couldn't get past the resolute Bizzarri. In the added minutes of the first half, Niang latched onto a cross but hit the post, symbolizing Milan’s struggle to convert chances.
