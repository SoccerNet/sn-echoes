And the game begins.\n0:11 Comment: The composition of the team was not difficult to predict. At least, colleagues from the Apennine Peninsula\n0:18 Comment: In general, we coped with this task with virtually no problems and no difficulties whatsoever,\n0:25 Comment: to predict the starting 11 for both Piscara and Roma.\n0:32 Comment: Journalists from Italy had no idea. Roma is playing today with the following lineup.\n0:37 Comment: Schencny is number one in defense. Federico Fazio is number 20.\n0:42 Comment: Kostas Manolas 44. Emerson 33. Antonio Rüdiger as the second action number.\n0:49 Comment: Two holding midfielders. Leandro Paredes 5. Kevin Strutman 6.\n0:53 Comment: Italy, Russia, number 2. Attacking midfielders. They are the creators. Rajan Ingalan number 4.\n1:0 Comment: Here he is, the Roma captain with the ball. And trying to shoot at the opponent's goal.\n1:6 Comment: Vincenzo Furil takes the ball. Ingalan 4. Stefan El Sharawi 92. Mohamed Salah 11.\n1:12 Comment: And at the forefront of the attack is one of the best snipers this season. Edin Dzeko.\n1:18 Comment: The number nine is the best Bombardi in Serie A, with 25 goals to his name heading into this match.\n1:27 Comment: Andrea Bellotti and Storino have the same number. But, by the way, the football player from the capital of Piedmont scored his 25 goals in 30 matches.\n1:37 Comment: While Dzeko is already holding his 33rd meeting with Roma in Serie A this season.\n1:42 Comment: El Sharawi moves into the center with the ball. Pass to Dzeko. Shot! The Romans open the scoring in the second minute of the game.\n1:49 Comment: Mohamed Salah did something absolutely phenomenal. I can’t say that Dzeko made a convenient pass for him.\n1:56 Comment: And Salah drives the ball into the far corner. But it seems that the referees still saw the Egyptian in an offside position.\n2:7 Comment: Let's look again. Dzeko continues to fly the ball. Salah brilliantly strikes with his left foot into the far corner into the Vinchentsov-Yurilo goal.\n2:17 Comment: It seemed like it was opening the scoring, but no. But no, the referees saw it.\n2:24 Comment: Salah has minimal offside. And thus the match continues with the same score as this meeting began.\n2:34 Comment: Andrea Marzaloni and Matte Vivenzi are helping the main arbiter of this meeting today.\n2:39 Comment: But the referee is Massimiliano Irrati.\n2:43 Comment: Pescaro conceded, but did not receive one in the column of goals conceded.\n2:48 Comment: Playing today in the following lineup: Vincentsov-Yurilo number one, Chizare Bou 83, Andrea Coda 35 and Cristiano Beraghi 3, Francesco Zampano number 11.\n2:58 Comment: In midfield Sally Muntari 13, Lenian Memushai, team captain 8, Mamadou Kuli Bali 33.\n3:5 Comment: And in attack, Gianluca Caprari 17, Ahmad Benali 10 and Jean-Christophe Beybek, number 15, operate with Den Eczema.\n3:13 Comment: The head coach of Pescaro is well known in Italy for his work with numerous clubs in this country.\n3:20 Comment: And here comes the hosts' attack. It was Muntari who burst into someone else's penalty area.\n3:25 Comment: Sally Muntari is well known to fans from his time playing for the Inter football club.\n3:32 Comment: But now it seems that there is reason to assume that he, like several other very cool, let me call it that way, football players from Pescara.\n3:42 Comment: In particular, this is Simon, and Pepe, and of course Alberto Gialardino.\n3:46 Comment: All these football players seem to be on their way from the fair and there is no return movement in this situation.\n3:53 Comment: Nevertheless, by name Pescaro looks very decent and, frankly speaking, it is somewhat unexpected to see this team at the very bottom of the standings throughout virtually the entire season.\n4:8 Comment: Because judging by the game, by the composition, by the actual names that make up the main team of Pescara, one could assume before the start of the season that this team would not be in such a deplorable state.\n4:24 Comment: What can I say, in particular, the team got excited a few times.\n4:28 Comment: And a 5-0 victory in a home game at Genu a couple of months ago seemed to have interrupted Pescara’s numerous unsuccessful streaks this season.\n4:39 Comment: But then came another of three defeats in a row.\n4:42 Comment: And even this attack cannot yet convince that Pescara is doomed.\n4:46 Comment: Nevertheless, the home team players continue to attack and even play with their heels in someone else’s penalty area.\n4:59 Comment: Another interception.\n5:1 Comment: It will now burn before the start of this meeting.\n5:3 Comment: He said that he understands perfectly well that it won’t be easy.\n5:5 Comment: And it's not just an action movie.\n5:7 Comment: Attempting to shoot from long range.\n5:9 Comment: Happy people don't reach the ball.\n5:11 Comment: But the defender's foot is substituted.\n5:15 Comment: Ricochet.\n5:16 Comment: And in the end, the home team’s players will now take the corner kick.\n5:20 Comment: Well, great, Jean-Christophe Baybek.\n5:22 Comment: Once showed very serious promise in the French Championship.\n5:28 Comment: Played for Saint-Tetien in the 2015-2016 season.\n5:35 Comment: But it's all on lease.\n5:37 Comment: He belonged to the fact that he is running away again in salah.\n5:40 Comment: Runs away, runs away, turns around.\n5:42 Comment: And now he is already in the field.\n5:46 Comment: He belonged to the fact that he is running away again in salah.\n5:48 Comment: Runs away, runs away, turns around.\n5:50 Comment: Makes the pass to a partner.\n5:52 Comment: And another great moment.\n5:53 Comment: Already has belts.\n5:54 Comment: Softly, softly.\n5:55 Comment: El Shaarawy tried to roll the ball past Fiorilo.\n5:59 Comment: But Fiorilo figured out the Belgian's idea.\n6:5 Comment: And he didn't let him open an account.\n6:8 Comment: The Belgians are on our inhalant.\n6:10 Comment: El Shaarawy has nothing to do with this team.\n6:13 Comment: But overall it's a lot of fun.\n6:14 Comment: Starts now.\n6:16 Comment: This is a meeting.\n6:17 Comment: 6 minutes gone.\n6:18 Comment: And we have already seen several dangerous moments in execution\n6:21 Comment: both one and the other Serie A team.\n6:24 Comment: Well, really, in the current, current 33rd round\n6:34 Comment: In almost every meeting the public has something and someone to look at.\n6:38 Comment: Less than three goals were not scored in any of the matches\n6:42 Comment: 33 weeks of Series A.\n6:44 Comment: But Episcara is a fun team.\n6:46 Comment: She, just like Polyarmo in this round at one time lost to Latsev with a score of 2-6.\n6:52 Comment: We lost to Torino away with a score of 3-5.\n6:58 Comment: That is, it seems like he scores.\n7:1 Comment: Especially with the arrival of Zeman from DNA.\n7:5 Comment: There are a lot of Episcara, but they still miss their goals much more.\n7:10 Comment: Roma attack.\n7:11 Comment: Long, long, lingering combination.\n7:13 Comment: And I tried to hit Paredes, who has a very good shot.\n7:17 Comment: From long range, but didn't hit the target.\n7:22 Comment: Kurin.\n7:26 Comment: The Naingalan is being shown to us today with the captain's armband.\n7:29 Comment: Raja Naingalan among the guests.\n7:32 Comment: Well, as you probably know, the owners have Mimusha as the captain of the team.\n7:38 Comment: And another attempt to shoot from long range.\n7:41 Comment: And again not exactly.\n7:43 Comment: But it’s interesting that in both teams the captain-legionnaires of Mimusha are Albanian.\n7:48 Comment: Naingalan has Georgian citizenship, but he was beaten to death.\n7:51 Comment: And he hit great.\n7:52 Comment: I launched the ball over the crossbar with my left foot, but didn't hit it.\n8:8 Comment: It's hard to say that Roma continues to fight for the Scudetto with Juventus.\n8:13 Comment: After the Turin team won the next match against the Gens,\n8:17 Comment: virtually leaving the genoists not a single chance of salvation,\n8:20 Comment: Beating the opponent with a score of 4-0 and regaining an 11-point advantage 5 rounds before the end of the Italian Championship.\n8:29 Comment: But at the same time, Roma, in the event of their own victory over Pescara in this environment,\n8:33 Comment: will once again come within 8 points of Juventus.\n8:36 Comment: Yes, there is a big lag.\n8:38 Comment: The second Señora plays great and doesn’t seem to give any reason to talk about it,\n8:43 Comment: that she may experience some decline and even short-term loss of concentration, and, accordingly, points.\n8:50 Comment: But nevertheless, there are still mathematical chances.\n8:54 Comment: The Romans will naturally fight for first place.\n8:57 Comment: Although experts and fans are inclined to believe that at the moment the main thing is,\n9:2 Comment: What should football players from the Eternal City think about is to ensure themselves a clear second place in the national championship,\n9:10 Comment: which allows you to painlessly get into the group stage of the Champions League,\n9:16 Comment: And let the pursuers, in particular Napoleon, leave Juventus at Pescara.\n9:22 Comment: Well, let's see. Rüdiger makes a pass. Shot!\n9:25 Comment: It's great how El Shaarawy came out on that pass from the right flank.\n9:31 Comment: Antonio Rüdiger, German defender of the Roman footballers\n9:36 Comment: First of all, he doesn't want Juventus to win.\n9:39 Comment: But of course he wants Juventus to win.\n9:42 Comment: And of course he wants Juventus to win.\n9:45 Comment: This pass from the right flank. Antonio Rüdiger, German defender of the Club of Rome,\n9:53 Comment: In an interview with Roma's official website, he noted that he is a central defender.\n10:3 Comment: And this is his favorite place, where he feels most comfortable.\n10:11 Comment: And, in fact, he considers himself a central defender.\n10:15 Comment: But Luciano Spalletti uses the German black footballer in a slightly different position.\n10:21 Comment: And Rüdiger, naturally, has no choice but to obey.\n10:26 Comment: Juventus and Anapole are in good shape now, Rudiger noted.\n10:30 Comment: But, at the same time, we are not cut out for it either.\n10:32 Comment: Yes, maybe a draw against Atlanta was not the best result.\n10:37 Comment: But nevertheless, it showed that both Roma and Bergamas are in very good shape.\n10:43 Comment: A difficult ending awaits us, but we still count on a final, positive ending to the championship.\n10:52 Comment: Let me remind you that the Romans were eliminated from the Europa League.\n10:56 Comment: The Romans lost to their most important rival in the semi-finals of the Coppa Italia.\n11:2 Comment: And, of course, Lazzo in the final, Leon in the semi-finals of the Europa League.\n11:5 Comment: That is, those teams to which Roma lost continue to move on in those tournaments in which the Lion Spalletti team no longer takes part.\n11:16 Comment: But in Serie A, Roma is above its competitors.\n11:20 Comment: There is no need to talk about Leon, but Leon is lower in the French championship than the Romans in the Italian championship.\n11:26 Comment: That is, correspondence is also a competition.\n11:29 Comment: In the domestic championship, it’s still the Roman footballers who win, not the Leonese ones.\n11:34 Comment: Although in the head-to-head confrontation in the Europa League, Leon went further and continues to count on the final traffic.\n11:40 Comment: With a difficult ball, pass to the center.\n11:45 Comment: The Pescara players play very tightly.\n11:47 Comment: Despite the last line of Serie A, Pescara is not the worst team in the championship statistically.\n12:0 Comment: And they conceded no more goals and scored no less than all the players on Danny Casemon's current team.\n12:14 Comment: But Pescara is the first team in the championship from the bottom of the standings to score and concede more than a hundred goals.\n12:26 Comment: The leader in this indicator is the Nepolitans - 77 goals scored, 35 conceded.\n12:32 Comment: And Inter Milan, and after this Tour and Fiorentina, also had similar indicators.\n12:40 Comment: 63-42 Inter, 55-45 Fiorentina.\n12:44 Comment: By the way, Torino also has very high results in this indicator.\n12:48 Comment: Well, of those who are at the bottom of the standings, the most spectacular teams in terms of the total indicator of goals scored and conceded are precisely the Pescara.\n12:57 Comment: 31 goals scored, 70 conceded - that's passive.\n13:1 Comment: Strong with the ball.\n13:2 Comment: Paredes.\n13:3 Comment: Even further to the right.\n13:5 Comment: Negalant.\n13:6 Comment: Transfer to Dzeko.\n13:8 Comment: Wosnitz shoots, the ball goes over the crossbars.\n13:11 Comment: Edin Dzheko jumped out great and envyed the basketball over the backboard.\n13:19 Comment: But his defenders missed him, what can I say.\n13:24 Comment: The only one left against him is Cesare Bolo.\n13:27 Comment: Dzheko is already superior to his opponent in terms of anthropometry.\n13:31 Comment: However, Bolo lost Vosnits in this situation and allowed Dzeko to break through with virtually no resistance.\n13:40 Comment: 0-0 still.\n13:41 Comment:  Jacko.\n13:43 Comment: Pass to the left.\n13:44 Comment: El Shaarawy.\n13:46 Comment: El Shaarawy shows the referee that a corner can be awarded, but Massimiliano Irrati thinks otherwise.\n13:55 Comment: Al Zampan he will begin.\n14:1 Comment: Al Zampan!\n14:8 Comment: Empoli won against Milan away.\n14:10 Comment: Cool, scored 10 points in the last four matches.\n14:14 Comment: And the Empoli players, who have consistently beaten Fiorentina and Milan on their fields, cannot feel safe.\n14:25 Comment: Well, now Piscara’s gap from the saving 17th place is already 15 points with 6 remaining matches.\n14:34 Comment: Mathematically, it is possible to win back such a thing, but such things happen so rarely in life that this probability should still be neglected.\n14:44 Comment: And if the Romans win today, then Piscara will have 15 points and 5 matches left before the end of the championship.\n14:52 Comment: That is, they will be able to score 15 points as much as possible, considering that Piscara currently has only 14 points and 2 wins.\n15:5 Comment: I don’t think anyone can still believe in something like this, even the most hardcore fans of the local team.\n15:16 Comment: Moreover, Piscara’s first technical victory over Sosuolu in the second round might not have happened, because Sosuolu won the meeting here 2-1.\n15:30 Comment: However, this team suffered a defensive technical defeat due to the fact that Antonin Ragusa played, whose application at that time had not yet been processed.\n15:44 Comment: Thus, this season Piscara has won only one single match.\n15:50 Comment: But how did you win? 5 unanswered goals!\n15:55 Comment: Poor Eugenio Lamanna's goal, sending the Piscara fans into the home games against Genu.\n16:3 Comment: Genu Caprari scored twice and Alberto Celli also scored a goal in the elligenal.\n16:11 Comment: And the first goal in that meeting in Kinasta was sent into our own goal.\n16:15 Comment: Rom takes the corner. Salah fought on the second floor with two defenders.\n16:23 Comment: Hrudger. Pass to the left. Paredes.\n16:28 Comment: Mingalan plays with a partner.\n16:32 Comment: Elsha Aravi is trying to open from the left.\n16:35 Comment: But Federico Faso, the Argentinean, connects the right flank.\n16:42 Comment: Hrudger again.\n16:45 Comment: It seems that the German, who called himself a central defender, feels good in someone else’s penalty area.\n16:51 Comment: Dzeko! Piscara's players are fighting back. Mostly goalkeeper Venchanzo Furilo is fighting back.\n16:58 Comment: Already several times the defenders left him to be torn to pieces by the forward of the Roman club.\n17:4 Comment: But for now, once with the help of referees, and in other episodes, Furilo manages on his own.\n17:11 Comment: Hrudger.\n17:17 Comment: Faso.\n17:24 Comment: Faso again.\n17:32 Comment: Stratman.\n17:35 Comment: I tried to involve Dzeko. Look how great the players of the Roman club are in selection.\n17:40 Comment: Sharawi. Hard contact. Attempt to break through. Will it? No.\n17:45 Comment: Stratman. Salah made a pass there on the right. And Salah actually defused the situation with an inaccurate pass.\n17:51 Comment: But again the Romans are the first to pick up.\n17:54 Comment: Golan. Imperious!\n17:57 Comment: Attempting to shoot with the left foot. The ball goes close to the post.\n18:2 Comment: Again Stratman struck for execution.\n18:5 Comment: This attack went on almost without stopping.\n18:9 Comment: We look again at how the ball bounced off the back surface.\n18:13 Comment: Ah, from the back.\n18:16 Comment: From the hip. From the calf of even the defender, the ball bounced towards Jack.\n18:21 Comment: No, I somehow played unsuccessfully. In my opinion, this was the code. Was it?\n18:25 Comment: No, this is not a code.\n18:27 Comment: From whose back the ball rolled to the boss. And he took one touch with his left foot.\n18:31 Comment: Checked Fiorilo.\n18:34 Comment: Fiorilo is holding on.\n18:37 Comment: And we will repeat.\n18:58 Comment: Roma has a very serious advantage.\n19:2 Comment: Currently 75 to 25.\n19:5 Comment: Ball possession statistics favor the Romans.\n19:9 Comment: And it doesn't fully reflect that gigantic gaming advantage,\n19:14 Comment: which the Licharno-Spalyakti football players have.\n19:17 Comment: The crossbar saves the home team.\n19:20 Comment: It was Neingaland who joined the attack.\n19:23 Comment: With two touches he played out this team phenomenally.\n19:27 Comment: And with a pass from deep.\n19:30 Comment: Look, Rüdeger's loss.\n19:36 Comment: What a great performance Neingaland played.\n19:39 Comment: Took the ball on his chest.\n19:41 Comment: And without letting the ball go down, he stabbed it into the crossbar of Fiorilo's goal.\n19:46 Comment: The Pescara players have already held out for 20 minutes.\n19:51 Comment: But how difficult it is for them\n19:55 Comment: current zeros on the scoreboard?\n19:57 Comment: Now it will be 20.\n20:2 Comment: There are, of course, volunteers; Kulebali has this skill,\n20:8 Comment: for which they played for many years for more serious clubs than Pescara.\n20:14 Comment: But youth, of course, cannot be returned.\n20:17 Comment: No offside.\n20:19 Comment: El Shaarami is gaining momentum.\n20:20 Comment: No, only now the referee's whistle still sounds.\n20:24 Comment: Masimiliano Irati reacted to the go-ahead signal.\n20:27 Comment: El Shaarami is discussing something with his partners.\n20:30 Comment: Let's look again.\n20:32 Comment: Yes, at the time of the transfer, two players of the Roman club were offside.\n20:36 Comment: El Shaarami slowed down, and then he ran.\n20:39 Comment: Well, you can’t stay in your own half of the field when there’s such a promising pass.\n20:43 Comment: He came running and realized that the referees were not giving him the opportunity to continue the attack.\n20:50 Comment: Salah is trying to put pressure.\n20:53 Comment: Engalan takes the ball.\n20:56 Comment: El Shaarawy against him Zampano.\n21:0 Comment: El Shaarawy plays with a partner.\n21:2 Comment: Gives both Emerson and Manolas the opportunity to support the ball.\n21:9 Comment: Facio.\n21:13 Comment: Nine strikes.\n21:15 Comment: Two of them were scored by Roma players on target at Vilchentsov-Yurilla's goal.\n21:18 Comment: Despite the fact that a shot at Engalan on the crossbar is not considered a shot on target.\n21:22 Comment: A goal scored as a shot on target is not considered because Salah was in an offside position, according to the referee.\n21:36 Comment: Well, now the Romans also made a mistake by Caprari.\n21:41 Comment: I still got into the offside position by some 15 centimeters.\n21:45 Comment: Oh, it won't be easy with Danny Zamon even in Series B.\n21:52 Comment: I lived in Rome for 25 years.\n21:55 Comment: I have a lot of friends both in Latelo and in Roma, Zamon noted shortly before the match.\n22:0 Comment: But this does not mean that I will prepare my team for the game against Roma any differently compared to other opponents.\n22:10 Comment: I hope we can create problems for our competitors.\n22:12 Comment: But in no way am I thinking about a rematch with the team I once worked for.\n22:22 Comment: We have our own team, our own problems, which are enough.\n22:29 Comment: We are thinking about a possible fight for survival.\n22:32 Comment: And even if there is practically no chance of maintaining registration.\n22:35 Comment: But we remember that we once managed to raise Piscara to the elite in the 2011-2012 season.\n22:44 Comment: And only after even the theoretical possibilities of remaining in the championship are lost, only after that will we benefit from that experience.\n22:56 Comment: In the meantime, we are still among the elite of Italian football.\n22:59 Comment: Emerson, who went forward, falls, but there is no violation of the rules, Emerson believes.\n23:3 Comment: They take the ball away from the opponent, this is Muntari.\n23:6 Comment: Mengalan is in the corner opposite him to Zampanu, who sends the ball to the corner.\n23:11 Comment: More than half of the first half is over.\n23:16 Comment: 0-0. Piscara has never won against Roma at home.\n23:21 Comment: These teams met six times at the Adriatico Stadium.\n23:26 Comment: And four times this year.\n23:29 Comment: Time feels like Ruedeger and Fazio got in each other's way.\n23:38 Comment: In turn, Spalletti noted that Piscara is not as simple as it seems.\n23:43 Comment: Now this team is already dead.\n23:46 Comment: And that doesn't mean Piscara won't play.\n23:52 Comment: In turn, Spalletti noted that Piscara is not as simple as it seems.\n23:57 Comment: Now this team is already very different from the one it was before the appointment of Sdenek Zeman.\n24:4 Comment: If he had been returned earlier, then, I have no doubt, Piscara would be taller now,\n24:9 Comment: than on the last line in series A.\n24:12 Comment: However, I, in turn, am also not going to concentrate on my opponent.\n24:16 Comment: Teams of Roma's level must play from themselves first.\n24:21 Comment: What the opponent shows doesn't matter anymore.\n24:27 Comment: Our calendar at the finish line is a little more difficult than that of our competitors.\n24:30 Comment: But our goal is to win all the remaining matches, and then we will see what place we will take.\n24:35 Comment: Let's look at the Roman calendar.\n24:38 Comment: Thankfully, Klyuchano Spalletti gave me the opportunity to pay attention to him.\n24:44 Comment: And we'll see that in the next round there's another Roman derby,\n24:46 Comment: As in the Italian Cup, we will see it at the Stadio Olimpico.\n24:52 Comment: Then Roma goes to San Siro to visit Milan.\n24:56 Comment: Next is a home match with Juventus.\n24:59 Comment: And two final rounds in Verona against Chievo.\n25:4 Comment: And in the last match of the tournament at home against Geno at the Stadio Olimpico.\n25:11 Comment: Indeed, the next three rounds of La Zio Milan-Juventus may well become decisive.\n25:16 Comment: But at the same time, first we need to achieve a victory against Piscaro away.\n25:21 Comment: And then, you see, the exact meeting against Juventus will also be important in the fight for the Scudetto,\n25:28 Comment: and not just in the fight with Naples for second place, which gives a direct pass to the Champions League.\n25:34 Comment: Piscaro on the attack. Long ball towards the left flank.\n25:37 Comment: Not exactly. Rüdiker is very good today.\n25:40 Comment: The German defender shows that he is capable against teams of Piscaro's caliber\n25:45 Comment: play both on his own and on the other side of the field and he can do everything.\n25:51 Comment: Any sea is knee-deep for Rüdiker.\n25:54 Comment: The Oppennine Mountains are up to your shoulder.\n26:1 Comment: The defenders of the Roman club played great here and did not allow Benalik to score.\n26:9 Comment: Piscaro with the ball.\n26:39 Comment: Long pass to Benali. Plays great. Ten hosts.\n26:58 Comment: Montary went forward.\n27:3 Comment: Benali. Penalty violation.\n27:9 Comment: Benali. Levi football player.\n27:12 Comment: Who also has an English passport.\n27:15 Comment: He even played for England under-17s.\n27:19 Comment: But then I decided to play for the national team of my historical homeland.\n27:24 Comment: Even though I was born in Manchester.\n27:27 Comment: And as you can see, he's playing in Libya.\n27:29 Comment: Benali.\n28:27 Comment: Pescara. Even if it didn't seem so to the Egyptian himself. Pescara is trying on the left flank\n28:34 Comment: Still come up with something, do something on the opposite side of the field. And the hosts get a cross!\n28:39 Comment: An honest school takes the ball into his hands. This Pescara attack could have turned out very dangerous. And now in\n28:48 Comment: The two Romans, Salah and Jack, go forward. Salah falls. There is no violation of the rules.\n28:54 Comment: Not bad. This zampanov burst into someone else's penalty area. Burst was potentially dangerous.\n29:24 Comment: Koulibaly. Young Koulibaly. Central midfielder for Pescara, born in 1999.\n29:49 Comment: Not to be confused with the famous Juarist footballer.\n29:55 Comment: This Madou Coulibaly is from Senegal. However, as for the real age of African players,\n30:4 Comment: You can never be 100% sure here. However, here is Pescara’s attack.\n30:12 Comment: Turning kick! How cool, how dangerous they wrote and composed it in the end. Baybek and his partners.\n30:21 Comment: Gian-Christophe Baibeck shows his team how to take a corner.\n30:26 Comment: Here, perhaps, I will not agree with the judge. Even despite all the recommendations from FIFA and UEFA about support\n30:35 Comment: attacks in dynamics. It seemed that there was an absence. But that’s why he is the referee on the line. To judge the wrong thing,\n30:42 Comment: What seemed to be what happened in reality. Mimushaev will still take the corner.\n30:47 Comment: We quickly played out the standard of a Pescara football player.\n30:59 Comment: An inaccurate pass is awarded to a Pescara football player against each other. And this is not the first time this has happened\n31:6 Comment: see. More than half an hour behind. 0-0 still. The Romans after they unleashed a squall,\n31:15 Comment: attacks in the first 20 minutes on the goal of poor Fiori Lo. We quickly found out that he is not a poor fellow at all,\n31:21 Comment: that he defends very well. And closer to half the first half, the defenders finally came in\n31:27 Comment: himself. And now the Adriatico stage. Continues to drive Pescara forward. To achieve an honorable result\n31:37 Comment: against Roma. In the end, Milanta couldn’t carry his legs out of here. In any case, he didn’t carry everything away\n31:44 Comment: limbs. The famous Milan club, when, thanks to an error by Donna Ruma, Pescara scored\n31:54 Comment: turnover of the opponent and played an honorable draw.\n32:14 Comment: Roma with the ball.\n32:26 Comment: The Roma players are calmly positioned in the opposing half of the field. Now we need to figure it out\n32:31 Comment: What tactical scheme do Pescara players use in defense?\n32:44 Comment: Pescara is mobile. Right now it's 4-4-1-1. Bayabek is trying to put pressure on his opponents while in\n32:52 Comment: in the central circle. Somehow, in addition to Bayabek, Caprari and Benali can also be called forwards.\n33:0 Comment: But Benali is now defending with the defenders. A mistake! Salah shoots! Salah, of course, is very offensive\n33:9 Comment: after the episode at the 107th second of the match, when Salah hit with a brilliant one-touch shot\n33:17 Comment: The opponent's goal. But this goal was not counted. And it continues to embody the motto of Alexander Kirzhakov\n33:26 Comment: to life. He hits and hits the opponent's goal, but less and less successfully with each new attempt.\n33:33 Comment: Roma goes forward. Zampanov. Not Roma, Pescara. Roma goes back and holds the defense. Strike.\n33:40 Comment: And a shot attempt from Bayabek. Ntari. Biraghi is picking up speed on the left flank.\n33:53 Comment:  Not bad.\n33:54 Comment: Will he reach the ball or not? Who is it? This is Coulibaly. They continue to choke the brigade a little\n34:7 Comment: The referees are the players of the Host team. In every episode, without exception, they demonstrate,\n34:12 Comment: that the ball should be theirs. And look, the referees once again followed the lead of Pescara Ningalan.\n34:19 Comment: We Northern Radia proves something. Apparently, it proves that he didn't touch the ball.\n34:27 Comment: And that’s why the corner was awarded without any reason. Well, there is both soil and grass on the field in Pescara.\n34:37 Comment: And now the hosts are giving a corner. 4-3 on the corner. Pescara is even ahead. Therefore, statistically\n34:46 Comment: Indicator: Zampano throws the ball back to Christiana Berraghi. Long throw into the opponent's area\n34:59 Comment: The penalty area. There is still no reason to doubt your own skill as fighters with integrity.\n35:4 Comment: Roma attack. 35 minutes behind.\n35:17 Comment: The Pescara football players are coping with this cavalry attack in the corner. The ball hit the corner\n35:22 Comment: flag. I thought a little and still crossed not the side, but the front.\n35:34 Comment: Dzheka is alone again. The Bosnian knows how to choose a position. He knows how to free himself from defenders.\n35:48 Comment: Salah, pass to the right. And again Jack. Nobody holds him personally. It would seem that in a modern way\n35:57 Comment: In football, personal guarding has not been used for a long time. But Jack, here we are with the standards,\n36:3 Comment: This is the figure for which a half-touch is enough to distinguish himself.\n36:12 Comment: The public was inspired.\n36:20 Comment: The Adriatico stadium was named after the famous Italian hurdler Giovanni Cornache in 2009,\n36:33 Comment: who left this mortal coil in 2008, who is a native of Pescara and three times\n36:41 Comment: took part in the Olympic Games at 64 and 68. His best achievement was a silver medal at\n36:58 Comment: European Championship in Belgrade in 1962. And also victory at the Mediterranean Games in Tunisia.\n37:11 Comment: 110 meters from the hurdle. And now it’s far from 110, but there will be a huge number of matches with hurdles\n37:18 Comment: Pescara players will overcome. Highly likely in Serie B. Meanwhile, for a foul on Salah\n37:23 Comment: Cristian Berraghi receives a yellow card. Number three central defender.\n37:28 Comment: Left back of Pescara. Indeed, Salah is there on his right flank and the attack is already great\n37:38 Comment: Berraghi was tormented and he couldn't stand it. Once he fouled on a warning.\n37:53 Comment: Roma with the ball. 38 minutes behind. Milan at home against Empoli, who gave a striking opening 20 minutes,\n38:8 Comment: Missed in the 40th after Levan Chedlidze converted from the corner flag.\n38:17 Comment: Milan played at home, Roma away. But the situation is similar. Even more than that, Milan is now a team,\n38:26 Comment: Which I won’t say is feverish, but the red-and-blacks don’t have the same ambitions compared to Roma.\n38:35 Comment: Well, Pescara is a team that actually has no chance, unlike Empoli. Empoli has chances.\n38:43 Comment: The biggest ones from the bottom quartet of the Italian Championship are still trying to maintain their residence in the elite.\n38:50 Comment: The home team's referees recorded a violation of the rules for a full against Ruedeger.\n38:56 Comment: Pescara was penalized with a free kick. Now another free kick.\n39:5 Comment: Muntari, in my opinion, receives his second yellow card in this match. The first one is cleared, the second one is from Sali Muntari.\n39:35 Comment: Cards are cards. Now the main thing, of course, is that you rewind.\n39:50 Comment: Here is Sali Muntari, whose best years, of course, were spent playing for Inter Milan.\n40:6 Comment: Well, in Milan, by the way, Sali Muntari also played around.\n40:28 Comment: Managed to play for both Milan teams.\n40:35 Comment: For a long, long time they are preparing to come up with something in the football player of the Club of Rome.\n40:45 Comment: It's already the 41st minute of the game.\n40:54 Comment: What will they perform? Serve. And Jack can't reach the ball. Was it worth fussing over?\n41:0 Comment: Emerson came into someone else's penalty area. Jack was actively waving his arms there.\n41:8 Comment: There are two football players here at once. Piscaro, Coda and Bolo. They show that the guests violated the rules against them.\n41:18 Comment: The code remains lying on the lawn.\n41:20 Comment: But Ingalan, naturally, does not agree with the real injury of one of the hosts’ defenders.\n41:26 Comment: He believes that in this way the players of the team from Dálek Zeman may be stalling for time ahead of the break.\n41:36 Comment: And time, it certainly works on Piscaro’s side in the first half.\n41:40 Comment: The players of the Rome Club were very active.\n41:44 Comment: In the first 20 minutes. Well, now, too, it seems they are trying to come to their senses again.\n41:49 Comment: In order to open the scoring before Irati gives the signal for half-time.\n42:14 Comment: For a long time, at the distance of the entire Italian Championship.\n42:20 Comment: Outsiders cannot, of course, show the same jump that they demonstrate in the 33rd round.\n42:25 Comment: Empeli, Crotone, and now Piscaro show that everyone should take them into account, even the favorites of the match.\n42:35 Comment: Roma in attack. Salah with one touch. Completely unsuccessful.\n42:40 Comment: But Salah liked it. One-touch play, especially when it works,\n42:46 Comment: This is usually an extremely entertaining and very effective element of a football match.\n42:52 Comment: And here, on top of everything, was the offside position.\n42:56 Comment: But Salah understood everything that he was out of the game and didn’t try very hard to...\n43:2 Comment: In any case, I didn’t try to catch the ball on the rise and launch it right into the opponent’s goal.\n43:10 Comment: And again Roma. Strike! 1-0. The Romans open the scoring. They intercepted great and punished the opponent for wastefulness.\n43:29 Comment: For a mistake by the team player Luciano-Spalletti. It would seem that Piscaro had to wait until the break.\n43:36 Comment: And there was an opportunity, after resting for 15 minutes, to go out against the clear favorite with renewed vigor.\n43:45 Comment: Interception in midfield. Long pass to El Shaarawy.\n43:48 Comment: He bursts into someone else’s penalty area and sees Strotman rushing next to him on a parallel course,\n43:54 Comment: Who receives the pass on an empty goal.\n43:57 Comment: The Dutchman probably couldn’t miss in this situation.\n44:3 Comment: El Shaarawy played great. A brilliant pass from deep.\n44:7 Comment: Well, Kemin Strotman has already completed his partner's efforts.\n44:11 Comment: Paredos passed to El Shaarawy from the center circle. 1-0. Roma opens the scoring.\n44:24 Comment: And then Piscaro counterattacked.\n44:33 Comment: Counterattack of the Roman club. Salah, Dzeko.\n44:37 Comment: The blow. 2-0. Piscaro's players fell apart.\n44:43 Comment: Neingaland accepts congratulations from partners.\n44:46 Comment: The hosts could have equalized the score and immediately got the second into their own goal.\n44:51 Comment: This is how Roma punishes an opponent for instant slackness.\n44:59 Comment: Salah runs away on the roof.\n45:1 Comment: Christian Beraghi could not oppose anything to him.\n45:4 Comment: Dzheko would have found the moment to be not just missed, but to come to naught.\n45:9 Comment: Gently grabbed Neingaland and then from about 10 meters in one touch\n45:13 Comment: sent the ball under the already defenseless Vescenza Fiorilo.\n45:17 Comment: 2-0. Raja Neingaland's tenth goal this season in Serie A.\n45:24 Comment: Plus, Ricochet also played for the loan.\n45:28 Comment: Adds one minute on the seven-day rath.\n45:30 Comment: 40 minutes. They punched and punched, but they couldn’t break through.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:1 Comment: So, Piscaro Roma, second half, the team is playing with the following lineups.\n0:8 Comment: 2-0 after the first 45 minutes of the game in favor of the guests.\n0:12 Comment: Roma is number 1 in defense with an honest goal.\n0:14 Comment: Fazio 20, Manuel 44, Emerson 33, Rutiger 2.\n0:18 Comment: Midfielders Parades 5, Strotman 6, Neingalan 4, El Sharawi 92, Salah 11.\n0:25 Comment: And on the sharp attack, Edin Jackon number 9, head coach Luciano.\n0:29 Comment: Spalletti, Neingalan, team captain.\n0:32 Comment: Piscaro, Fiorillo in goal number 1 in defense.\n0:34 Comment: Bobo 83, Coda 35, Biraghi 3, Zampano 11.\n0:39 Comment: Midfielders Mimushai, team captain 8, Gulibali 33, Bruno, who replaced Muntari at number 5, will act.\n0:47 Comment: And in the attack there is a trio of Kaprali 17, Benali 10, Beibek 15, head coach Sdenek Zema.\n0:56 Comment: The main referee of this meeting is Massimiliano Iratti.\n1:7 Comment: But Andrea Marzaloni and Mateo Vivenza help him.\n1:11 Comment: Piscaro on the attack.\n1:16 Comment: Mimushai.

    "summary": "Pescara and AS Roma squared off in an anticipated Serie A fixture at the Adriatico Stadium, with both teams having distinct aspirations for the evening. AS Roma was looking to consolidate its position in the league and keep its mathematical hopes alive for the Scudetto, while Pescara, nestled at the bottom of the table, sought to show their fighting spirit despite their near-certain relegation.\n\nAs the game kicked off, it was clear from the starting lineups that Roma meant business. The visitors fielded an attacking lineup with Edin Dzeko, Mohamed Salah, and Stephan El Shaarawy leading the charge, supported by a robust midfield that included Radja Nainggolan and Leandro Paredes. Roma's defense, marshaled by Federico Fazio and Antonio Rüdiger, showed early intent of keeping things tight at the back.\n\nThe match's early moments were kinetic, with Roma asserting dominance almost immediately. El Shaarawy darted into the center, laying off a perfect pass to Dzeko who efficiently delivered a shot intended for the back of the net, only for it to be ruled offside mere seconds later. This disallowed goal didn't dampen Roma's spirits as they continued to mount pressure on Pescara's defenses. Salah, invoking his usual flair and speed, troubled the Pescara defense constantly, coming close to setting the scoreboard ticking.\n\nPescara stood its ground, despite the flurry of attacks from their opponents. Sally Muntari, a stalwart in their midfield, surged forward displaying glimpses of his vibrant past with Inter Milan, though his efforts were matched with Roma's stern defensive tactics.\n\nThe match hinted at an underdog narrative with Pescara pushing forward intermittently through Gianluca Caprari and Jean-Christophe Bahebeck, who sought openings behind the Roman defenses. Their endeavors, however, were often thwarted by the vigilant Szczesny in Roma's goal, who proved to be a wall Pescara could not bypass with ease.\n\nAs the game progressed, Roma's persistence paid off. Kevin Strootman opened the scoring close to the end of the first half after being brilliantly set up by El Shaarawy, who had pierced into Pescara’s penalty area with finesse and delivered a precise pass. This intricate play was a testament to Roma's brand of football — meticulous and ruthless.\n\nJust moments after the first breakthrough, Roma doubled their lead through Radja Nainggolan. Salah's blistering pace on the counterattack left Pescara’s defenders chasing shadows, leading to a quick exchange that ended with Nainggolan slotting home clinically. The two goals were a body blow to Pescara, who had managed to hold their defenses for the majority of the first half.\n\nIn the second half, Roma's relentless attack continued with Mohamed Salah finally getting his name on the scoresheet. Assisted by Emerson, who had craftily maneuvered past Pescara's Koulibaly, Salah fired a low, precise shot leaving Fiorillo, Pescara's goalkeeper, stranded and the scoreboard read 3-0.\n\nPescara, despite being three goals down, showcased commendable resilience, with Akhmat Benali almost pulling one back only to be thwarted by the woodwork and later the vigilant Szczesny. Their situation saw no improvement as Roma began to toy with their defense, creating chance after chance. El Shaarawy came close to scoring but missed narrowly, with Fiorillo once again called into action to save Pescara from further embarrassment.\n\nThe fourth goal came from a well-orchestrated Roma play where Salah, proving to be a nightmare for the Pescara defense, involved El Shaarawy in a counterattack that was finished off perfectly by Salah himself. This goal all but sealed the match, exhibiting Roma's counterattacking prowess which left no room for Pescara to mount a comeback.\n\nWith the game nearing its end, AS Roma continued to hold possession smartly, ensuring the clock ran down efficiently. Despite the comfort in their lead, Roma's defense showed occasional lapses allowing Pescara moments of hope. This period saw Pescara earn their only goal of the game, thanks to a determined attack that found Benali on the scoresheet, capping off his team's persistent efforts.\n\nThe closing minutes of the game saw Pescara pushing to earn a measure of respect from their supporters, though any thoughts of a miraculous comeback were quickly dashed by Roma's well-settled defense. Meanwhile, Wojciech Szczesny confirmed his essential role for Roma, making critical saves including a brilliant dive to deny an in-swinging free-kick from Biraghi that could have narrowed the goal margin.\n\nThroughout the game, the affair between Salah and the Pescara defense was unmissable. His intent, speed, and technicality underlined much of Roma's attacking fabric, underscored by his two well-earned goals. Indeed, AS Roma's overall performance was one of a team technically superior and determined to clinch full points with minimal errors.\n\nIn what was a vital away win for Roma, the match was marked by player substitutions in its final stages, with Clemens Grienier and Juan Jesus coming on to ensure the squad stayed fresh heading into their next set of demanding fixtures, including a pivotal Roman derby. With 4-1 as the final score, it wasn't just the goals that reflected Roma's superiority but their tactical and physical dominance over the 90 minutes.\n\nAlthough this game plunged Pescara further into the dungeons of the relegation zone, their grit, particularly through players like Benali and Caprari, offered glimpses of what they are capable of. AS Roma, with this commanding victory, underscored their bid for the top positions in Serie A, maintaining pressure on Juventus and keeping Napoli within touching distance in the goals tally.\n\nAs the dust settled, it was evident that this match emphasized the disparity between the top and the bottom of the Serie A table. For Roma, it was a crucial fixture dispatched professionally, moving them one step closer to cementing their place in next season's Champions League."
