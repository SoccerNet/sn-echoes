Within seconds, the ball went out of play, resulting in a throw-in for Cagliari. As the visitors quickly pressed forward, they managed to get a shot on target early in the first minute, testing AS Roma's defense right from the start.\n\nAS Roma regained possession with a throw-in but struggled to progress as the ball frequently went out of play. Both teams exchanged several throw-ins within the first few minutes as they tried to establish control over the game. By the 7th minute, AS Roma had a chance to capitalize on a direct free-kick following a foul by Cagliari. However, their efforts were thwarted as the ball went out of play almost immediately.\n\nThe pattern continued with Cagliari frequently clearing the ball and AS Roma attempting to mount attacks.

AS Roma quickly sought to capitalize on the direct free-kick awarded, but again, their efforts went off target. The visitors’ defense remained stalwart, continuously clearing the ball and interrupting AS Roma's rhythm.\n\nDespite AS Roma's dominance in ball possession and several attacking moves, Cagliari's defense stood like a wall. Even with a few shots on target from AS Roma, they were unable to find the back of the net as the half approached its close. The Giallorossi kept pressing but the frequent interruptions and clearances by Cagliari, combined with several instances of the ball going out of play, kept the scoreboard unchanged.\n\nAs the first half drew to a close, Cagliari committed another foul, resulting in a free-kick for AS Roma. The home side capitalized on these free-kicks to try and create scoring opportunities but were consistently met by strong defensive clearances from Cagliari. The first 45 minutes ended without a goal, with both teams heading into the break locked in a stalemate.\n\nReturning for the second half, AS Roma restarted the match with more urgency. However, the physical nature of the game persisted with an early foul by an AS Roma player. This set the tone for another half filled with tactical fouls and persistent defensive work.\n\nCagliari, still tenacious as ever, managed an early shot off target within the opening minutes of the second half. AS Roma answered with their own counter-attacks, but the game remained a tightly contested battle. The ball frequently went out of play, causing multiple throw-ins which disrupted the flow of the game.\n\nAS Roma managed to break the deadlock in a tense moment around the 10th minute of the second half. Following a foul by Cagliari that led to a free-kick for Roma, the Giallorossi advanced with precision. A vital shot on target found its way past the Cagliari goalkeeper, igniting celebrations among the home fans. The score was now 1-0 in favor of AS Roma.\n\nThe goal injected a burst of energy into both the players and the fans. Cagliari, now trailing, pressed even harder to find an equalizer. They earned a corner shortly after AS Roma’s goal and managed to register a shot on target, but the home team’s defense remained in control. AS Roma’s goalkeeper and defenders worked in unison to thwart any threats posed by Cagliari.\n\nDespite Cagliari's increased efforts to press forward, their endeavours were consistently returned with clearances by AS Roma. The tactical discipline of both teams was on full display, with each side making substitutions to tactical effect.\n\nAround the 30th minute of the second half, AS Roma continued their offensive, pushing for a second goal. They had multiple shots on target, one of which was followed by a clearance by Cagliari, further intensifying the match. The substitutions and numerous throw-ins added to the high-tempo nature of the game.\n\nAs the clock ticked closer to full-time, the tension heightened. Both sides were relentless, resulting in several instances of the ball going out of play and frequent fouls, as players tried to gain any possible advantage. Cagliari made a crucial substitution nearing the final minutes, hoping fresh legs would help secure an equalizer.\n\nA dramatic turn of events unfolded towards the game's conclusion when a Cagliari player was shown a red card for a severe foul, reducing the visitors to ten men. This red card exemplified the fierce and competitive nature of the match, as both sides had fought tooth and nail.\n\nIn the closing moments, AS Roma maintained their 1-0 lead, managing the game skillfully with precise clearances and maintaining possession when possible. Cagliari, even with one man down, did not relent in their pursuit of a goal. However, AS Roma's defensive unit stood resolute, ensuring that the lead they earned early in the second half held until the final whistle.\n\nThe final score read AS Roma 1 - 0 Cagliari. The match was a showcase of competitive spirit, tactical fouling, crucial defensive maneuvers, and consistent persistence from both teams.
