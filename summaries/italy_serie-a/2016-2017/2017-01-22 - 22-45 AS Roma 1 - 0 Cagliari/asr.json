Dzeku received a pass on the verge of offside\n5:31 Comment: But goalkeeper Rafael became close to him\n5:33 Comment: And he didn’t allow Jack to extend the movement of the ball along the goal\n5:38 Comment: Rafael was not the main goalkeeper for Kaliri for a long time\n5:43 Comment: Almost the entire first round\n5:46 Comment: Because in the off-season Marcus Tararius returned to Milan\n5:50

matches yet\n12:29 Comment: In the Italian series this season\n12:31 Comment: This is only his seventh game\n12:33 Comment: But judging by the statistics, he is a big fan of cards\n12:37 Comment: Because in six matches he has already written out as many as 30 of these cards\n12:41 Comment: It’s easy to calculate that on average five per match\n12:45 Comment: He never tried Roma and he never tried Calleri\n12:49 Comment: Go\n12:51 Comment: Muru\n12:56 Comment: Perotti is pushing him\n12:58 Comment: Rajan Ingalan is not very visible yet\n13:0 Comment: Facio Daniel Ederosi\n13:2 Comment:

previous round against Geno\n13:33 Comment: The ex-rule also applies here.\n13:36 Comment: But in general, if you look at Barielo’s track record, who has he played for?\n13:40 Comment: Here you can spend time listing and listing until the end of the half.\n13:45 Comment: In Roma, as I already said, he played 52 matches and scored 12 goals.\n13:50 Comment: But there was a season when he went on loan to Juventus in the winter and with Juventus then became the champion of Italy\n14:0 Comment: Supply to Ingalan\n14:4 Comment: In general, Barielo was better bombarded\n14:6 Comment: In Calleri at the moment 31 goals have been scored in Calleri 31 can you imagine\n14:14 Comment: For example, the same amount as Milan scored\n14:20 Comment: The club from Sardinia scored 9 of these goals, almost a third were sent into the opponents' goal by Marco Barielo\n14:28 Comment: But Calleri’s saddest number is, of course, 44\n14:32 Comment: 44 goals conceded, the most in the Italian Championship\n14:36 Comment: Calleri is now in 11th place\n14:39 Comment: And even poor unfortunate Palermo Cratona and Piscara missed less than Calleri\n14:50 Comment: But Roma scored 41 goals and conceded 18\n14:55 Comment: So far only Juventus have conceded less than Roma 16\n15:0 Comment: Emerson sends the ball out of bounds.\n15:7 Comment: Nice Daniel Ederosi\n15:11 Comment: Stratman Dzeko, surrounded by two football players, turned out to be afraid but also saved the ball\n15:16 Comment: Look how cool Dzeko turned around here, he needs to be rolled there, yes!\n15:18 Comment: Took it and scored\n15:19 Comment: You have to go there, yes!\n15:20 Comment: On Bruno Perez\n15:21 Comment: He picks up speed and who shoots whom then just like that oh oh oh\n15:25 Comment: Perotti, well, you chewed the ball, then\n15:28 Comment: Such a motorcyclist was just given by Diego Perotti, you know when you get on a motorcycle\n15:33 Comment: And now tryn tryn gives him the gas now he was giving him gas in this attack\n15:40 Comment: Diego Perotti's ball then went well to the Argentinean Bruno Alves\n15:45 Comment: Didn't play well and didn't hit the ball\n15:47 Comment: And Roma had to now\n15:49 Comment: The goal was played well, of course, the catalyst for this attack was Edin Dzeko\n15:56 Comment: And his feint in the center of the field and the connection of Bruno Perez on the right flank\n16:3 Comment: Bruno Alves\n16:9 Comment: The Romans do not have a wait-and-see approach; they immediately apply pressure\n16:16 Comment: The field has ended\n16:17 Comment: No matter how wide the field\n16:19 Comment: To the Olympic stage and it sometimes ends\n16:22 Comment: Fabio Pisacane releases the ball\n16:26 Comment: Bruno Perez goes forward again, Brazilian Antonio Rudiger, it’s unclear how he ended up there\n16:34 Comment: Again Rudiger serves Bruno Alves\n16:39 Comment: Daniel Edrosi back Manolas there are again a huge number of rumors around Manolas\n16:47 Comment: Home Manchester United\n16:49 Comment: Home in Inter\n16:50 Comment: But he still remains in rum\n16:52 Comment: Perotti Noceros hits and hits Pisacana's hand\n16:59 Comment: And that’s what, friends, what’s more, Guida receives a yellow card from the referee\n17:4 Comment: And how is this moment different from what it was at the very beginning?\n17:7 Comment: Attention question\n17:9 Comment: You have a minute and you can ask the hall for help\n17:12 Comment: Daniel Edrosi this is exactly the same situation\n17:15 Comment: Perotti hits\n17:16 Comment: Let Pisacana show his hand\n17:17 Comment: The ball hits this hand and is designated as a normal\n17:20 Comment: At the moment at the Roma goal, a penalty was not awarded\n17:23 Comment: Rafael shows 4 green fingers\n17:27 Comment: Symbolic of the flag of Brazil\n17:32 Comment: Which also has a main color of green\n17:39 Comment: 24 and 8\n17:42 Comment: Daniel Edrosi\n17:45 Comment: 24 and 8\n17:47 Comment: Dovorot\n17:50 Comment: Bruno

Comment: Badly\n18:6 Comment: This is certainly not Francesco\n18:8 Comment: We all laughed together on the sidelines\n18:12 Comment: Not a very good shot\n18:14 Comment: Bruno Perez.\n18:15 Comment: And the goalkeeper managed to move here.\n18:18 Comment: 0-0.\n18:20 Comment: Serie A.\n18:21 Comment: 21st round.\n18:22 Comment: Roma vs Kaleri.\n18:25 Comment: Even strange.\n18:27 Comment: Some score more than 40, others concede more than 40.\n18:31 Comment: But there is no head yet.\n18:32 Comment: To Ingalan.\n18:35 Comment: Perotti.\n18:35 Comment: Now three Roma players are at the same point.\n18:39 Comment: Perotti on Dzeko.\n18:41 Comment: But experience, experience of Bruno Alves.\n18:43 Comment: Now I played for him.\n18:45 Comment: He stopped and intercepted this transmission.\n18:49 Comment: Honest on the swing.\n18:52 Comment: Grandmaster.\n18:53 Comment: He paused and rolled towards Emerson.\n18:56 Comment: Perotti.\n18:57 Comment: Daniel Edrosi.\n18:59 Comment: Good throw to Emerson.\n19:0 Comment: He's already here.\n19:2 Comment: 1-1.\n19:4 Comment: Under the left cross.\n19:5 Comment: And Dzeko should have probably run here to the near post.\n19:10 Comment: But I have to.\n19:11 Comment: Doesn't mean he came running.\n19:13 Comment: He did not Kaw discover.\n19:30 Comment: Harry is here.\n19:35 Comment: Ah ah ah.\n19:38 Comment: M

Feasio!\n19:43 Comment: Rüdiger went to the right flank.\n19:46 Comment: Maybe this is Lucian's hint to burn right during the match.\n19:49 Comment: And I find it difficult to say what it is connected with.\n19:55 Comment: Rüdiger.\n19:58 Comment: Struatman.\n20:3 Comment: Rasti said at a press conference before the match that Roma is now in perfect shape.\n20:9 Comment: She looks very cool, agile, interacts well with each other and the football player.\n20:14 Comment: They returned injured and disqualified.\n20:17 Comment: In general, Roma is doing well.\n20:20 Comment: And in order for us to resist the Romans, we must not only defend ourselves, but also think about attack.\n20:25 Comment: At the same time, we must try to hold a benchmark match for our level.\n20:30 Comment: So far Kaleri is coping.\n20:33 Comment: And Borrello carried the ball well.\n20:35 Comment: 19-year-old student.\n20:37 Comment: Kaleri, look what he's doing.\n20:38 Comment: From one I forwarded a second, a third, but this is already rudeness.\n20:41 Comment: This is already rudeness.\n20:42 Comment: Of course, we should have given up the ball earlier.\n20:44 Comment: But Roma does not have a numerical advantage here.\n20:47 Comment: Perotti.\n20:49 Comment: I went forward.\n20:50 Comment: Dzeko is on the wing.\n20:51 Comment: The Bosnian moves to the middle.\n20:53 Comment: Kapitelli cleanly takes

his second entry into the rut.\n22:22 Comment: He has been playing here since 2012.\n22:24 Comment: Jacko falls.\n22:25 Comment: Good pass from Bruno Perez.\n22:27 Comment: This is exactly what a striker should do when he is alone in attack.\n22:32 Comment: When he is like a pillar, he is in the vanguard.\n22:35 Comment: And he must jump out from the flank for these passes.\n22:38 Comment: Good diagonal pass.\n22:39 Comment: Very subtle from Bruno Perez.\n22:42 Comment: And you can’t say that a man as tall as Edin Jack didn’t have enough leg length.\n22:48 Comment: Or length...\n22:49 Comment: Or shoe size, right?\n22:54 Comment: Not the one who plays number nine.\n22:58 Comment: In Roma everything is fine with both height and size.\n23:4 Comment: But here Jack just missed the

What a pass from Dorosya.\n23:23 Comment: You saw that with one pass now four players stood behind the line of the ball.\n23:28 Comment: Perotti hits Ingalan.\n23:31 Comment: I drove to Perotti. Perotti again wanted to do everything himself.\n23:34 Comment: Maybe Ingalana should take over the game more often.\n23:36 Comment: Yes, he praised him.\n23:38 Comment: Right and left.\n23:39 Comment: Luciano Spalletti said at the pre-match press conference that...\n23:43 Comment: Rajana Ingalan can do absolutely everything on the field.\n23:47 Comment: He understands what the coach wants from him.\n23:50 Comment: He does it on the field.\n23:52 Comment: And he compared, imagine, Rajan Ingalan, Luciano Spalletti with Pogba’s field.\n23:59 Comment: He said that the only difference between them is age.\n24:2 Comment: But the impact on the game and, possibly, the transfer price are now the same.\n24:8 Comment: This is Mister.\n24:9 Comment: Rüdiger! Rüdiger!\n24:11 Comment: Well, he turned around like the cruiser Antonio Rüdiger.\n24:15 Comment: True, there was already a whistle.\n24:17 Comment: Rule German.\n24:21 Comment: What is the correct way to say it?\n24:23 Comment: German defender.\n24:24 Comment: Violated.\n24:26 Comment: Where was the floor?\n24:28 Comment: In my opinion, Nikola Muru fell there himself.\n24:34 Comment: Anyway.\n24:35 Comment: The teams crossed the equator of the first half.\n24:37 Comment: Anyway.

And here the ball went.\n26:40 Comment: If there was no foul on Rudiger, then, in my opinion, the ball went away from the Kaleri player.\n26:46 Comment: This is where he definitely left.\n26:48 Comment: Runalwish.\n26:50 Comment: In his repertoire.\n26:52 Comment: But Roma took the corner kick.\n26:56 Comment: Here we look at Rüdiger.\n26:58 Comment: Foul.\n27:0 Comment: Undisputed.\n27:1 Comment: Nicola Borrella.\n27:2 Comment: Definitely hit the leg.\n27:4 Comment: German defender.\n27:6 Comment: Daniel Edrosi takes the ball in the corner.\n27:8 Comment: Innings.\n27:10 Comment: And Jacko!\n27:12 Comment: Lumbago.\n27:13 Comment: Another corner.\n27:14 Comment: Shows that Edin Dzeko had a handball.\n27:16 Comment: Which for some reason was left unattended by Kaleri's defenders.\n27:19 Comment: Whether it was or not.\n27:21 Comment: Well, maybe he played along with his forearm.\n27:24 Comment: Edin Dzeko is wearing it.\n27:26 Comment: But, of course, that's not all.\n27:30 Comment: Edin Dzeko is wearing it.\n27:32 Comment: But the referee ignored this.\n27:35 Comment: 28 minutes.\n27:36 Comment: Another corner.\n27:38 Comment: Innings.\n27:39 Comment: I never noticed that Manolos looks very similar to Salvatore Bacchetti.\n27:45 Comment: They have some common facial features.\n27:48 Comment: Long pass to Murisya Isla.\n27:51 Comment: Daniel Edrosi returned to the defense.\n27:54 Comment: And he interrupts this transmission with his head.\n27:58 Comment: This is worthy of applause.\n28:1 Comment: By fans.\n28:5 Comment: Roma.\n28:7 Comment: Fasio. Good pass to Emerson.\n28:12 Comment: Perotti.\n28:17 Comment: Perotti.

Comment: Emerson is down.\n34:6 Comment: I tried to shoot now, but it didn’t come out.\n34:8 Comment: But look how it got up there on Ingalan.\n34:11 Comment: At least it's not very noticeable.\n34:14 Comment: Never shot on target.\n34:16 Comment: There was a hit from the ice when the ball was loaded.\n34:20 Comment: Much higher than the crossbar.\n34:23 Comment: Belgian.\n34:24 Comment: Attack.\n34:28 Comment: Not much.\n34:31 Comment: Here is the player Luciano Spalletti rated.\n34:37 Comment: As many millions as Paul Pogba.\n34:41 Comment: Manolas.\n34:44 Comment: Fasio.\n34:45

play very subtly.\n34:58 Comment: Strotman.\n35:3 Comment: Emerson.\n35:6 Comment: Peroti.\n35:12 Comment: And there should be a corner.\n35:20 Comment: No, not a corner, but the ball goes away from Peroti.\n35:22 Comment: But for now, the game of Kalyaria is based on the principle of neither oneself nor the people.\n35:25 Comment: That is, Kalyaria himself does not play, and very actively interferes with Roma’s play.\n35:29 Comment: Well, Roma now scares its rivals so much.\n35:33 Comment: Or maybe it’s Rakes El Sharawly who scares his opponents so much,\n35:39 Comment: but, of course, they are not going to play openly with Spalletti’s team.\n35:44 Comment: Chepeteli knocks the ball out.\n35:50 Comment: Strotman.\n35:52 Comment: The ball fell off his foot.\n35:55 Comment: And out of Cagliaria.\n36:0 Comment: I'm telling you, don't narrow the front of your attack.\n36:7 Comment: Go wider.\n36:9 Comment: This is a hint, perhaps, to Bruno Perez.\n36:13 Comment: Or maybe Edin Jack should go there and play as the last defender.\n36:20 Comment: Strotman.\n36:22 Comment: Back.\n36:23 Comment: Derosi.\n36:25 Comment: And again the Cagliaria defense meets this attack head-on.\n36:29 Comment: Peroti.\n36:31 Comment: Innings.\n36:32 Comment: Isakani succeeds.\n36:35 Comment: Serve for Balakiri.\n36:36 Comment: Yes, Roma still can’t think quickly.\n36:42 Comment: Act faster on the beat before the calyaria has time to change lanes.\n36:48 Comment: That's how it was with the Derosi transfer.\n36:50 Comment: I think that if Jack had scored, it would have been much easier for the Romans to breathe.\n36:56 Comment: Broadcast.\n36:57 Comment: Attack.\n36:58 Comment: They will suffer.\n37:0 Comment: Yes, they will wait until the first goal.\n37:4 Comment: Pull the rubber.\n37:6

so far.\n37:16 Comment: Just no errors.\n37:18 Comment: I think at the moment it's 9 from Lagadzeta Delosport.\n37:22 Comment: Of course, after the match with Samdoria, all Italian publications praised Ingolan’s performance.\n37:31 Comment: He became the best player.\n37:34 Comment: According to almost all publications.\n37:37 Comment: And everyone didn’t skimp on the eight.\n37:40 Comment: Well, such authoritative publications, of course.\n37:46 Comment: Fasio.\n37:48 Comment: Barielo.\n37:51 Comment: And that’s where Wisly’s game position was to run.\n37:55 Comment: He understood that

Bruno Alves with the ball.\n38:17 Comment: And Strootman is now like in a derby with a hair, yes, he wanted to punish Bruno Alves.\n38:24 Comment: I quickly went to the selection.\n38:29 Comment: But in Russia it didn’t work out that way for the Dutch.\n38:31 Comment: 38 and a half minutes\n38:34 Comment: the team played in the first half\n38:36 Comment: 21 round\n38:38 Comment: Italian Serie

Comment: he's still a drebler\n39:5 Comment: although in the middle of the timing he showed\n39:10 Comment: not bad on this side\n39:11 Comment: Barielo is also still being pressed by Derosi without the ball\n39:14 Comment: and here is the pressure\n39:15 Comment: purely DS takes the ball away\n39:17 Comment: it could get dangerous\n39:19 Comment: Barielo moves under his left leg\n39:22 Comment:

still has nine goals.\n42:30 Comment: Well, yes, it was Faris.\n42:32 Comment: Faris, Faris, Faris.\n42:38 Comment: Now twice now the director found these moments with painful blows to Borello’s

but a draw.\n43:44 Comment: If only he were in Udinese.\n43:46 Comment: And Spoletti told his players.\n43:48 Comment: Here's a look at the table.\n43:50 Comment: We would still remain in second place.\n43:52 Comment: But at the same time.\n43:54 Comment: 50 different options so as not to fight for the championship and then we would be pressed by a competitor\n44:2 Comment: In short, the shot

is number 13.\n0:35 Comment: In the center \"Derosi\" 16, captain \"Iri\" Strotman 6.\n0:40 Comment: And the attack group “Dzheko” 9, “Perotti” 8, “Neingalan” 4.\n0:44 Comment: \"Luciano\" Mr. Spalletti, head coach of the Romans.\n0:50 Comment: “Rafael” is number one in goal for “Calieri”.\n0:52 Comment: In the center of defense there are Brunualovish 2 and Chapiteli 23.\n0:57 Comment: On the right is “Pesakany” 19, on the left is “Muru” 29.\n1:0 Comment: Pesacani is the only player to receive a yellow card in the first half.\n1:5 Comment: So, by the way, “Takhtsidis” 77, “Borello” 18, “Desena” 4.\n1:12 Comment: This is the middle of the field, this is a powerful fist.\n1:15 Comment: In the center is “Faria” 17, a little to the left on the right is “Isly” 3.\n1:20 Comment: And in the center \"Marco Borello\".\n1:22 Comment: “Marco Borello” is the so-called attack group at Callieri.\n1:26 Comment: For the Massimo Rosteli team, Calleri did not have a single shot against Roma in the first half.\n1:35 Comment: Maybe in the second half Callieri will play more actively.\n1:38 Comment: \"Faria\" with the ball. It’s a nice trick, but there’s no chance of outplaying Kevin Strotman here.\n1:48 Comment: \"Borello\"!\n1:52 Comment: “Farias” demands to meet Luciano-Spalletti’s “Farias” closer with its sonorous roar.\n2:0 Comment: Discount on Borello. There will be a blow. Rüdiger is hit by Borello.\n2:3 Comment: Another blow. It was Maurice Isla who struck.\n2:9 Comment: Chilic, but misses the goal. And again, in the column of shots on goal, shots on target, Callieri has zero.\n2:20 Comment: Because the game never happened honestly.\n2:28 Comment: From Rodgin Ingal the ball is hit.\n2:31 Comment: \"Faria\" throws into the field. Out.\n2:35 Comment: These are the Isakans, who received a card in the 18th minute of the Perotti match.\n2:43 Comment: Cast to \"Dzheko\". Bruno Alves is ahead of him.\n2:47 Comment: At the same time, “Dzeko” managed to step on Bruno Alves’s foot and is looking sideways in that direction.\n2:55 Comment: But “Dzeko” doesn’t understand why Bruno Alves continues to lie on the lawn.\n3:0 Comment: And “Portuguese” is in pain. This can be seen in his closed eyes.\n3:11 Comment: Oh, I twisted my ankle. “Dzeko” didn’t step on Bruno Alves’ ankle.\n3:18 Comment: But when Alves fell, he placed his foot poorly and twisted his ankle.\n3:24 Comment: But it's okay. Now \"Borella\" is running away.\n3:27 Comment: Bruno Perez is pressing him.\n3:30 Comment: Roma immediately shows its intention to move forward.\n3:34 Comment: \"Faiso\" in the center of defense.\n3:36 Comment: Please note that the Roma players have returned to their previous formation in the center of defense.\n3:42 Comment: Ruedeger went to the right flank during the first half.\n3:46 Comment: “Manolos” moved to the middle, and “Faiso” began to act a little to the left.\n3:50 Comment: Now everything is just as it started. \"Rüdeger\" is on the left, \"Faiso\" is in the center, and \"Manolos\" is slightly to the right.\n3:55 Comment: What kind of chess from “Lucian” Spalletti is, probably only he can explain.\n4:0 Comment: \"Perotti\" enters the fight. There he fights at Ingalan.\n4:5 Comment: We managed to get out to “Alira” with no luck.\n4:9 Comment: Long pass forward to Isla.\n4:12 Comment: It's \"Farias\" versus \"Manolos\".\n4:16 Comment: \"Bruno Perez\" and another mistake. There are a lot of mistakes.\n4:22 Comment: “Honest”... Aw! For what? Well, that's what they call a goalkeeper without a job.\n4:27 Comment: In a situation where Chestny’s help was not required, for some reason he ran outside the penalty area and almost caused trouble.\n4:37 Comment: But we figured it out. “Bruno Perez” is actively gesticulating there “Rosteli”.\n4:43 Comment: Shows how his team's players need to move and adjust.\n4:49 Comment: \"Emerson.\"\n4:52 Comment: \"Perotti.\" Pass to Dzeko.\n4:56 Comment: It was difficult, of course, for “Dzeko” to play differently and turn out differently.\n5:0 Comment: Therefore, the attack was choked by Bruno Alves.\n5:4 Comment: Bruno Alves loses the ball in a simple situation. And again “Bruno Perez” makes a mistake for the second time in a row.\n5:11 Comment: Look at the reaction of Lucianos-Politician.\n5:13 Comment: “Darling, darling, what are you doing?”\n5:16 Comment: “Dzheko” was five meters away from you. It was possible to play it more accurately.\n5:20 Comment: But “Bruno Alves”... I said in the first half that Roma’s chance in such a very mediocre situation,\n5:28 Comment: a very mediocre attacking game is “Bruno Alves”.\n5:35 Comment: Bruno Alves missed the last round due to being sent off in Milan.\n5:41 Comment: The match with Milan was sent off by the stoppage time referee and the match was disqualified.\n5:47 Comment: Today he is back in action and, apparently, does not feel at ease.\n5:54 Comment: Daniel Aderosi on the ball.\n5:56 Comment: Wiped it under a wet T-shirt.\n5:59 Comment: Serve, discount and the ball flies past.\n6:4 Comment: Rüdeger was there, and, in my opinion, Manovas was there, who made this discount.\n6:10 Comment: And these little football tricks, Kaleria will probably play like this for the entire second half.\n6:16 Comment: We win an extra 3-4 seconds, as Rafael Facio has just shown us.\n6:25 Comment: \"Bruno Perez\" in front of the head of a Brazilian football player.\n6:29 Comment: And, of course, Milan is included.\n6:35 Comment: Rafael Facio.\n6:37 Comment: \"Bruno Perez\" in front of the Brazilian's head.\n6:40 Comment: The ball flies over.\n6:42 Comment: And again “Bruno Perez” is wrong.\n6:44 Comment: And now it will be replaced.\n6:46 Comment: Farias, Farias, free kick Farias.\n6:48 Comment: Impact, ricochet.\n6:50 Comment: And now Magin Manova takes the ball for a corner.\n6:52 Comment: The first, in my opinion, was Kaleria’s corner in this match.\n6:56 Comment: But what about \"Bruno Perez\"?\n6:58 Comment: Five minutes were played in the second half.\n7:0 Comment: And such monstrous three mistakes.\n7:4 Comment: The Brazilian admits.\n7:8 Comment: Thanked, it appears, honest Manolas.\n7:12 Comment: For the fact that he played reliably in defense.\n7:16 Comment: Angular.\n7:18 Comment: Innings. Taxidis serves.\n7:20 Comment: Fazio is here. Nobody bothers him.\n7:23 Comment: Impact and words don't work.\n7:25 Comment: Barjelu. Farias will not let “Rajan” Ingalam break through.\n7:29 Comment: It was risky for Ingalam to leave in the garage.\n7:31 Comment: But he can.\n7:33 Comment: He makes \"Taxidis\".\n7:35 Comment: Look how Kaleria played it.\n7:37 Comment: Barielo. Dorosi.\n7:40 Comment: Helps Manolas.\n7:43 Comment: With all the desire, of course, run to the attack.\n7:47 Comment: Thinking about how to win today the tenth anniversary match at home this season.\n7:54 Comment: And again reduce to one point in the tournament on the “Gap from Jewels” table.\n7:58 Comment: It is not advisable for Roma to complicate the situation.\n8:4 Comment: Conceding the ball in the second half.\n8:8 Comment: Fazio is good. Federico Fazio is good today.\n8:11 Comment: Muru.\n8:15 Comment: Well, this is football when attack is attacking.\n8:21 Comment: Dorosi.\n8:23 Comment: Muru and Ingalam descended here at the junction.\n8:26 Comment: And the Belgian got it.\n8:29 Comment: Where did it hit him in the lower back?\n8:32 Comment: Defender Nicola Muru.\n8:35 Comment: Yes.\n8:36 Comment: There was a case.\n8:40 Comment: There are a lot of fans at the Olympic Stadium today.\n8:44 Comment: And by the way, Spalletti also noted that a lot of fans came to the cup meeting with Sandori.\n8:54 Comment: And the match was in the middle of the week, in the evening.\n8:57 Comment: This suggests that fans like Roma's performance this season.\n9:4 Comment: Well, on average 25-28 thousand go to Roma.\n9:16 Comment: This is on average.\n9:17 Comment: Sometimes, of course, there is a good match, for example, with Inter, when it was almost 37.\n9:23 Comment: But on Kratuny, of course, there are less than 25.\n9:27 Comment: Stroatman.\n9:31 Comment: Garotti.\n9:33 Comment: I played short with Emmers.\n9:36 Comment: Rüdeger.\n9:37 Comment: Innings.\n9:38 Comment: Jacko!\n9:39 Comment: 1-0!\n9:40 Comment: Well, here it is, finally, Edin Dzeko.\n9:42 Comment: This was how it should have been in the first half.\n9:46 Comment: Edin Dzeko scores.\n9:49 Comment: Opens the account in this meeting.\n9:51 Comment: The more difficult, in my opinion, the scoring situation is for Dzeko, the easier it is for him to send the ball into the goal.\n9:59 Comment: Now Dzeko pushes his opponent and scores Dzeko’s 14th goal in the championship.\n10:6 Comment: There was no offside here.\n10:7 Comment: Antonio Ruedeger, assist.\n10:9 Comment: And who did Edin Dzeko leave so beautifully behind?\n10:16 Comment: And this was Nicola Muru.\n10:18 Comment: And Raphael is powerless.\n10:20 Comment: Here to help your team.\n10:22 Comment: 1-0!\n10:24 Comment: Roma is completing the task at least for now.\n10:32 Comment: Well, look at the joy of Daniel Dorosi.\n10:34 Comment: In general, Italians are always emotional, temperamental, and expressive.\n10:38 Comment: And that's why we love them.\n10:42 Comment: Dzeko hasn't scored on the road for a long time.\n10:46 Comment: The last time was back on October 26th.\n10:50 Comment: Just count the months.\n10:52 Comment: I didn’t score for 3 months with a certain pause on New Year and Christmas.\n10:57 Comment: But Dzeko missed the penalty in Udinesen.\n11:2 Comment: But here Fazio realized his chance.\n11:4 Comment: Fazio is wonderful!\n11:6 Comment: Facio!\n11:8 Comment: It's just a bison today.\n11:10 Comment: Not a wolf in the line of defense, but a real bison.\n11:16 Comment: Federico Facio ate everything.\n11:19 Comment: But don't over-praise.\n11:20 Comment: 57th minute. 1-0.\n11:23 Comment: Edin Dzeko brings back the good mood to the Roman fans.\n11:30 Comment: In the part that he is a fan of the Luciano-Spaleti team.\n11:34 Comment: Another corner goal in Wojci has disappeared.\n11:40 Comment: But what is Ruedeger like?\n11:45 Comment: Antonio Ruedeger's first assist this season.\n11:50 Comment: But he was injured for a long time.\n11:52 Comment: We remember that at the very beginning he did not play at all.\n11:55 Comment: And the match in Udinese...\n11:58 Comment: In Udine against Udinese he missed due to disqualification.\n12:2 Comment: I went through the yellow card.\n12:4 Comment: Innings.\n12:5 Comment: Manualas.\n12:8 Comment: And now it will be really fun.\n12:10 Comment: Now Roma has more than enough space.\n12:13 Comment: And here it makes sense to remember Mohammed Salah again.\n12:19 Comment: Which continues to perform at the African Cup of Nations.\n12:25 Comment: But they failed to escape on a counterattack.\n12:37 Comment: But, as we remember, even a two-goal advantage in the match with Galeria does not guarantee anything for Roma, if we recall the first round match.\n12:48 Comment: One more serve.\n12:49 Comment: Here...\n12:50 Comment: I think Chipeteli will be here.\n12:52 Comment: It is in this period from 46 to 60 minutes that Roma scores most often, on par with the period from 61 to 75.\n13:11 Comment: This is Roma's ninth goal at the beginning of the second half.\n13:16 Comment: What is this if not Mr. Spalet's coaching work?\n13:22 Comment: Valuable advice during the break.\n13:25 Comment: The team that emerges is fired up and knows how to act on the field.\n13:32 Comment: Takzires throws the ball to Pisacan.\n13:36 Comment: These conversations and rumors have resumed again regarding the transfer of sporting director Roman Monchi from Seville to Roma.\n13:51 Comment: Roma really wants to sign him.\n13:53 Comment: Monchi has worked so long and how he worked in Seville, one can generally envy many.\n14:0 Comment: But Monchi himself seemed to say that he plays great in Seville.\n14:3 Comment: But these conversations arise again.\n14:6 Comment: Moreover, a fairly authoritative publication, in particular Mark, recently wrote that Monchi is about to move here to work in Roma.\n14:23 Comment: In the meantime, Roma are without transfers in this winter transfer window.\n14:27 Comment: But that's not how work works.\n14:29 Comment: DRS, another serve to Jack.\n14:32 Comment: Cepetelli is against him.\n14:39 Comment: They didn't allow me to pierce my boot.\n14:42 Comment: Pirotti.\n14:44 Comment: Pirotti didn't even earn a corner.\n14:46 Comment: Here is Desena.\n14:48 Comment: Well, Kaliri signed a new player.\n14:52 Comment: Pirotti, like everyone else, is within limits.\n14:54 Comment: He came from the Navara club.\n14:56 Comment: He never played.\n14:58 Comment: In Serie A he came from a Serie B club.\n15:2 Comment: And he is not yet in optimal shape.\n15:8 Comment: Therefore, it is hardly worth waiting for its appearance today.\n15:13 Comment: Ingalan. There is still plenty of time to play, 30 minutes are still ahead.\n15:18 Comment: The team played for an hour. 1-0 ahead.\n15:21 Comment: Roma distinguished himself.\n15:23 Comment: Edin Jack.\n15:27 Comment: At the 55th minute.\n15:29 Comment: Gum.\n15:41 Comment: At the 55th minute.\n15:43 Comment: Daniel Iderosi. Bruno Perez.\n15:47 Comment: A rare case in the second half when Bruno Perez played exactly at his own feet.\n15:51 Comment: Rüdeger.\n15:53 Comment: A neat cast there to Emerson.\n15:55 Comment: And Emerson carefully threw the ball forward under his left hand.\n15:59 Comment: Against him is the defender of Pisacana.\n16:2 Comment: Diego Pirotti is here. One more for weight.\n16:5 Comment: Jack.\n16:7 Comment: Last time.\n16:9 Comment: Replay.\n16:11 Comment: He failed Nicholas Moore.\n16:14 Comment: For example, in this episode, when he openly pushed him through.\n16:18 Comment: Here Mura tried his best to hold Jack back, but he was good.\n16:24 Comment: Vosnits.\n16:28 Comment: Here he played as, of course, a top former player.\n16:32 Comment: Fasio.\n16:34 Comment: But if we are to choose the best player of the match at the moment.\n16:38 Comment: It is clear that you can praise left and right.\n16:42 Comment: Any player.\n16:44 Comment: And then he makes a key mistake and that’s it, hello.\n16:47 Comment: But so far I kind of liked everyone in this match.\n16:51 Comment: Federico Fazio.\n16:53 Comment: I took off the whole bottom and the whole top.\n16:56 Comment: Handsome.\n16:58 Comment: Emerson.\n17:0 Comment: On this show is Francesco Totti.\n17:3 Comment: But he's not in the game yet.\n17:16 Comment: Transmission in the center field.\n17:17 Comment: Barjela throws the ball to Ingalana.\n17:20 Comment: Perotti.\n17:21 Comment: That's what a throw at Jack.\n17:24 Comment: There was an offside position.\n17:26 Comment: Over the head of Bruno Alves.\n17:28 Comment: Well, at his age it’s already difficult for Bruno Alves to jump, of course.\n17:31 Comment: To get the ball like that.\n17:33 Comment: Was there an offside here, was there a boy, was there an offside.\n17:36 Comment: Yes, to Ingalan.\n17:38 Comment: As if he did everything right.\n17:41 Comment: But how did you handle the ball, right, Jack?\n17:48 Comment: The best in the tradition of Bosnian football.\n17:52 Comment: Fazio is leading the fight here too.\n17:56 Comment: Marco Sau may appear on the field at Kaliri.\n18:1 Comment: He has already scored four goals this season.\n18:4 Comment: And it was Sau who equalized the score in the match, which was in Sardinia.\n18:11 Comment: But then Kaliri brought a draw.\n18:13 Comment: 2-2.\n18:15 Comment: Struat Maan.\n18:17 Comment: Bruno Perez.\n18:18 Comment: Perez raised that the game didn’t go well at the beginning of the half.\n18:23 Comment: The Brazilian Rüdeger now plays more simply.\n18:29 Comment: But Ruedeger is on fire.\n18:31 Comment: To Ingalan.\n18:32 Comment: And break through to Ingalan.\n18:33 Comment: Yes, he has a powerful kick from his right foot.\n18:38 Comment: But this time Raja overdid it and shot above the goal.\n18:52 Comment: February 1st.\n18:54 Comment: After winning the Italian Cup.\n18:58 Comment: Over Samduri 4-0.\n19:0 Comment: Now Roma has reached the quarterfinals.\n19:2 Comment: And on February 1st we have a match against Chisena.\n19:6 Comment: This is a favorable grid for the Romans.\n19:11 Comment: And, of course, this is not just a match.\n19:14 Comment: This is the match against the Romans.\n19:17 Comment: And, of course, this is not just a match.\n19:19 Comment: This is the match against the Romans.\n19:22 Comment: And Chisena outplayed Suolo quite unexpectedly.\n19:27 Comment: In the 1-8 finals.\n19:29 Comment: If Roma deals with Chisena, then this is the semi-final.\n19:33 Comment: Hello.\n19:40 Comment: So Roma is now fighting for the Scudetta.\n19:46 Comment: And he is very determined and serious, as he said.\n19:49 Comment: Head coach of the team.\n19:51 Comment: And Roma has good chances in the Cup.\n19:54 Comment: Parella.\n19:55 Comment: The replacement is being prepared by U.\n20:2 Comment: Jao Pedro will appear on the field in Kaliri.\n20:4 Comment: Brazilian.\n20:8 Comment: The tenth number obliges us in many ways.\n20:12 Comment: Jao Pedro.\n20:14 Comment: This football player is 24 years old.\n20:17 Comment: Played in Palermo.\n20:19 Comment: I started differently from Miner.\n20:20 Comment: Then he was in Palermo, but he did not stay there.\n20:23 Comment: In Portugal, Vitoria Guemaraes.\n20:25 Comment: Then Pignarol curses.\n20:27 Comment: In Brazil, Zasantos.\n20:29 Comment: Then he aged Praya.\n20:30 Comment: And now in 2014 he is in Kaliri.\n20:35 Comment: Jao Pedro, Giraldina, Dosantos, Galla.\n20:39 Comment: Scored two goals this season.\n20:41 Comment: His eighth outing.\n20:46 Comment: In this season.\n20:58 Comment: Rüdeger.\n21:4 Comment: That's where Emerson flanks.\n21:16 Comment: Paresis.\n21:19 Comment: Parella.\n21:21 Comment: Cast to Barjela.\n21:23 Comment: Again Facio is against him.\n21:25 Comment: Of course, Barjela noticeably loses in sharpness.\n21:29 Comment: Barielo made a snail.\n21:32 Comment: I didn't see a way out.\n21:35 Comment: Barielo.\n21:44 Comment: Ways out.\n21:46 Comment: Or entering the penalty area.\n21:48 Comment: Barello.\n21:51 Comment: There is still a player missing by the name of Barrel.\n21:54 Comment: Or Barrail.\n21:56 Comment: For a complete set in Kaliri.\n22:1 Comment: Like Barrello, Barielo and Barrail.\n22:7 Comment: Amazing.\n22:8 Comment: Daniel Desen's place was replaced by Jao Pedro.\n22:12 Comment: Here he is.\n22:14 Comment: 24 years old, number 10.\n22:16 Comment: We are waiting for number 10 to appear for the Roman team.\n22:19 Comment: In the main, Kaleri has already caught up with Roma.\n22:21 Comment: 3-3.\n22:23 Comment: And any standard is a chance.\n22:24 Comment: Innings.\n22:25 Comment: Manolas kicks the ball out.\n22:28 Comment: 1-0.\n22:29 Comment: A very slippery account.\n22:31 Comment: By the way, Roma’s last two victories in a row were with this score 1-0.\n22:36 Comment: With Genu and Najenu.\n22:38 Comment: And against Odinese too.\n22:39 Comment: Who decided one goal on Ingalan.\n22:44 Comment: Muru.\n22:52 Comment: Raphael.\n22:55 Comment: And Manolas carefully throws the ball into his hands with his head.\n23:3 Comment: Check.\n23:4 Comment: Barielo.\n23:5 Comment: That's how Roma shouldn't make mistakes.\n23:7 Comment: Barielo percussion Facio.\n23:10 Comment: And again Facio.\n23:11 Comment: Barielo is very technical.\n23:13 Comment: Now I've got my opponent out of the way.\n23:16 Comment: Throwing the ball forward.\n23:17 Comment: Here, of course, Ingalan Derosi set him up.\n23:20 Comment: Look how Manolas was removed.\n23:24 Comment: Barielo.\n23:25 Comment: But we can’t pass Fazio today.\n23:30 Comment: Barielo stepped up his game in the second half.\n23:34 Comment: Innings.\n23:37 Comment: Headbutt.\n23:39 Comment: If this can be called a blow, it is in my opinion to Chapoutel.\n23:48 Comment: Yes, that's exactly him.\n23:51 Comment: Number 23.\n23:55 Comment: He struck at Kaliria.\n24:1 Comment: Pedro ran.\n24:2 Comment: Barielo.\n24:4 Comment: No.\n24:5 Comment: Fasio.\n24:7 Comment: Today I ate everything I could and couldn’t.\n24:11 Comment: It's like he has invisible pliers.\n24:17 Comment: Brunalves.\n24:22 Comment: Muru.\n24:24 Comment: And now the pressure from Roma.\n24:26 Comment: Perotti is well ahead of Taktsidis.\n24:28 Comment: Perotti's shots are saved by the goalkeeper.\n24:32 Comment: Raphael.\n24:33 Comment: Perotti created this moment for himself.\n24:37 Comment: Rafael felt that he could guide Perotti into the far corner.\n24:40 Comment: And he took such a half-hearted position.\n24:42 Comment: Opening the close one a little.\n24:44 Comment: But I didn’t make a mistake here either.\n24:46 Comment: The shot was in the near corner.\n24:48 Comment: The goalkeeper managed to come together and helped the team out.\n24:51 Comment: Well, then Brunalves.\n24:53 Comment: The ball is kicked out for a corner.\n24:55 Comment: On the corners.\n24:56 Comment: Rome takes the lead again.\n24:58 Comment: 4-3.\n24:59 Comment: Perotti.\n25:0 Comment: Perotti will serve.\n25:2 Comment: Serve by Jao Pedro.\n25:4 Comment: Came in as a substitute.\n25:5 Comment: Played well in defense on Ingalaan.\n25:10 Comment: And here we go forward.\n25:12 Comment: It works exactly like Farias.\n25:15 Comment: This is Pisacane.\n25:20 Comment: Burrell.\n25:31 Comment: And further to Ingalaan.\n25:34 Comment: Like this on Dzeko.\n25:36 Comment: Dzeko also played along neatly with Chipitelli.\n25:39 Comment: But Dzeko is alone here.\n25:40 Comment: He himself approached Basnitz with a long stride.\n25:43 Comment: And Chipitelli is risky.\n25:46 Comment: But within the rules.\n25:49 Comment: Still, in a tackle he knocks the ball out cleanly.\n25:53 Comment: You know, what if Dzeko had pushed the ball a little further?\n25:56 Comment: then this is definitely a penalty.\n26:3 Comment: 20 minutes.\n26:7 Comment: Play small now.\n26:9 Comment: The stands came to life.\n26:10 Comment: I understand that Francesco Totti went to take off his training suit.\n26:18 Comment: Dorosi.\n26:22 Comment: Innings.\n26:25 Comment: And an attack on the goalkeeper.\n26:29 Comment: Here is Antonio Rudger.\n26:32 Comment: He is also interested in Rydger.\n26:36 Comment: Where is the attack on the goalkeeper?\n26:39 Comment: Maybe Dzeko sooner.\n26:41 Comment: Not Rüdger.\n26:42 Comment: He broke the rules.\n26:43 Comment: The Chels are interested in Rüdger.\n26:45 Comment: But Rüdger also said that he was not going to.\n26:48 Comment: Faris is about to leave.\n26:50 Comment: At least here and now.\n26:52 Comment: And he leaves the field.\n26:54 Comment: And Marco Sau, already announced by me, comes out.\n26:58 Comment: The person who scored the goal.\n27:1 Comment: Which brought Kalira a draw in the first round match.\n27:4 Comment: Number 25\n27:5 Comment: This football player is 29 years old.\n27:7 Comment: He has been in Kalira for a long time.\n27:13 Comment: Perez.\n27:14 Comment: To Ingalan.\n27:15 Comment: To the center of Dzeko.\n27:19 Comment: Dorosi.\n27:21 Comment: Perotti.\n27:22 Comment: Emerson.\n27:24 Comment: No.\n27:25 Comment: In Kalira's penalty area everything is teeming with white.\n27:31 Comment: Emerson.\n27:32 Comment: And here is the feed.\n27:34 Comment: But there is only one, one Dzeko.\n27:36 Comment: Everyone else surrounded the gate.\n27:40 Comment: A lot of passes.\n27:42 Comment: But there are few entries into the penalty area.\n27:45 Comment: Here's how Perotti did it.\n27:47 Comment: How Dzeko tried to do it.\n27:50 Comment: Roma doesn't go into the penalty area.\n27:51 Comment: But there is a treasure buried there.\n27:53 Comment: There are gold coins.\n27:55 Comment: There are three points for Roma.\n27:59 Comment: It's good for weight.\n28:0 Comment: But we could somehow try to diversify the game.\n28:4 Comment: Manolas.\n28:5 Comment: Long pass again.\n28:8 Comment: Ampisakan.\n28:15 Comment: Ingalan.\n28:21 Comment: Rüdeger.\n28:22 Comment: Derosi.\n28:23 Comment: Perotti.\n28:24 Comment: Roma is doing this trick well.\n28:27 Comment: Gruna-Perez.\n28:29 Comment: Lumbago.\n28:30 Comment: Jacko.\n28:31 Comment: 2-0.\n28:32 Comment: No.\n28:35 Comment: This was, of course, played out very famously by the Romans.\n28:41 Comment: But there was an offside.\n28:42 Comment: There was an off-site.\n28:44 Comment: It's worth admitting.\n28:46 Comment: Well, El Sharawi talked to Totten today, in my opinion, for a week in advance.\n29:1 Comment: Surely Strotman is already swearing in Italian.\n29:7 Comment: But this was played out.\n29:8 Comment: Strotman.\n29:14 Comment: Yes, Mauricio Kisly got into trouble here.\n29:30 Comment: Rüdeger.\n29:32 Comment: Ruedeger is simply a playmaker.\n29:34 Comment: Casting\n29:36 Comment: In place of Chapiteli.\n29:37 Comment: Fasio.\n29:39 Comment: This is also possible.\n29:42 Comment: 15 more minutes to play.\n29:47 Comment: 1-0 still.\n29:51 Comment: Roma is ahead.\n29:54 Comment: Roma conceded 4 goals in the last 15 minutes.\n29:57 Comment: But, however, in these last 15 minutes she also scores often.\n30:2 Comment: Pirotti's balls.\n30:9 Comment: Emersan.\n30:10 Comment: The ball under his right foot is not very comfortable for him.\n30:12 Comment: Dzeko's serve.\n30:14 Comment: Hit.\n30:15 Comment: And how about Bruno Perez.\n30:19 Comment: Even I would now be in the place of Bruno Perez,\n30:21 Comment: would send the ball into the goal.\n30:23 Comment: Yes, what can we talk about, our editor.\n30:26 Comment: Will return.\n30:29 Comment: What can we talk about, our editor.\n30:31 Comment: Anton Kuzmin would find himself in such a situation.\n30:34 Comment: I would have scored.\n30:37 Comment: How did it happen?\n30:38 Comment: Look, where?\n30:47 Comment: It's not even just Dzeko.\n30:49 Comment: This is a completely different league.\n30:52 Comment: Bruno Perez scores second now.\n30:55 Comment: And all questions are answered.\n30:57 Comment: But.\n31:0 Comment: What follows is an untranslatable pun.\n31:4 Comment: Borella.\n31:8 Comment: Muru.\n31:13 Comment: It happens, well, you sit, yes, on the sofa or in an armchair and think.\n31:17 Comment: In this situation, it was probably easier to score than not to score.\n31:23 Comment: But this is seen in the television picture.\n31:26 Comment: But there everything is completely different.\n31:31 Comment: I placed my shins on my feet wrong.\n31:34 Comment: I looked at the gate the wrong way.\n31:36 Comment: I didn't assess the situation that way.\n31:38 Comment: That's all.\n31:40 Comment: The moment is over.\n31:42 Comment: Bruno Alves.\n31:44 Comment: Dangerous.\n31:45 Comment: No.\n31:46 Comment: Back.\n31:47 Comment: Raphael.\n31:51 Comment: Bruno Alves and his partners continue to play.\n31:56 Comment: Muru.\n32:8 Comment: They hold the ball well in the net.\n32:10 Comment: Maybe remind them that they are losing 0-1.\n32:19 Comment: Here is Sau as the highest replacement.\n32:22 Comment: With the ball in the center of the field.\n32:23 Comment: Continue to Isla.\n32:25 Comment: Islu is further along the flank to Pisacana.\n32:32 Comment: Boriello's serve.\n32:34 Comment: Discount.\n32:36 Comment: But it was incredibly difficult to shoot after such a pass with a head

Comment: He put Jack and Nicola Burrell right on his shoulders.\n43:10 Comment: And together with him he almost reached the center.\n43:12 Comment: 19-year-old student of Kaliri.\n43:15 Comment: Spent the season on loan in Como.\n43:20 Comment: Breaks the rules.\n43:21 Comment: And one more warning.\n43:24 Comment: I said that on average 5 per match.\n43:27 Comment: The card shows.\n43:31 Comment:

    "summary": "AS Roma welcomed Cagliari to the Stadio Olimpico in a highly anticipated clash in the 21st round of the Italian Serie A. The match began with a palpable sense of expectation, and although it ended with a minimalistic scoreline of 1-0 in favor of Roma, the game was packed with drama, defensive resilience, and a few moments of high tension that gave the viewers more than just a glimpse of exciting football.\n\nAs the referee set the ball rolling, Roma immediately took control of the proceedings. The opening quarter of an hour saw the home side asserting itself. From the back, Wojciech Szczesny, their dependable goalkeeper, wore the number 1 jersey, standing behind a three-man defensive line comprising Antonio Rüdiger, Federico Fazio, and Kostas Manolas. Bruno Peres and Emerson Palmieri occupied the flanks, offering both defensive protection and attacking support.\n\nKevin Strootman and team captain Daniele De Rossi anchored the midfield, providing the necessary balance and transition between defense and the forward line. Up front, Roma's attack was orchestrated primarily through Edin Dzeko, their prolific striker wearing the number 9 jersey. Supporting him were Diego Perotti and Radja Nainggolan, who had been in sublime form in recent matches and was expected to be a constant threat.\n\nThe initial exchanges were tightly contested. Cagliari made it evident that they were not there merely to defend. They too displayed attacking intent, particularly through Marco Borriello, their seasoned striker. As the minutes ticked by, Roma seemed more comfortable in possession, stretching the play through their full-backs and attempting to carve openings.\n\nOccasional forays by Cagliari, particularly through Diego Farias, hinted at their potential to exploit any lapses in the Roma defense. In a controversial moment early in the game, Farias struck a shot that appeared to have hit De Rossi’s hand inside the penalty area, prompting calls for a penalty from the Cagliari contingent. The referee, Marco Guida, however, saw nothing untoward and waved play on, much to the dismay of Cagliari's players and fans.\n\nDespite having more control, Roma struggled to create clear-cut chances in the first half. Bruno Peres and Emerson from the wings provided several crosses, yet the precise finishing touch was missing. Perotti had an opportunity but his shot was comfortably saved by Cagliari's goalkeeper, Rafael.\n\nTactically, Roma's Luciano Spalletti and Cagliari's Massimo Rastelli were engaged in a chess match of sorts, with both sides constantly adjusting their strategies. Spalletti's side maintained their 3-4-3 formation, but noticed rotations and positional interchanges among his players, particularly in defense as Rüdiger was occasionally seen moving to the right flank with Manolas covering central lanes.\n\nThroughout the half, the visitors were stout defensively with Bruno Alves and Luca Ceppitelli standing firm in the heart of their defense. Both Rafaels, the goalkeeper and the center-back Alves, had work cut out for them as Roma's persistent attacks required numerous interventions. Alves particularly showed resilience despite having some nervy moments when Dzeko pressed.\n\nAs the half drew to a close, the excitement built up. There were reactions from the stands as several half-chances and failed attacks unfolded. Roma supporters were vocal, expressing their impatience and urging their side to find that opening. The half-time whistle blew with both teams heading into the locker rooms for a stalemate at 0-0.\n\nPost interval, Roma returned with renewed vigor. Spalletti’s half-time talk seemingly worked wonders, as the Giallorossi appeared sharper and more determined. Just ten minutes into the second half, Roma broke the deadlock. Antonio Rüdiger, playing on the right flank, delivered a precise cross into the box finding Edin Dzeko, who deftly pushed his way past Nicola Muru to head home from close range, giving Roma a well-deserved 1-0 lead. This goal was Dzeko's 14th of the season, marking a significant moment for both him and the side.\n\nFrom then on, the game opened up. Cagliari knew they had to push forward to get something out of the match. Massimo Rastelli introduced Marco Sau and João Pedro to add an attacking impetus. The changes spurred Cagliari into life, making several thrusts towards the Roma goal, but they were often thwarted by the resolute defending of Federico Fazio who had an exceptional game.\n\nFazio's brilliance was complemented by Daniele De Rossi’s leadership and the midfield dynamism of Kevin Strootman. Roma's strategy shifted slightly to accommodate a more counter-attacking perspective, with Diego Perotti and Nainggolan providing the necessary speed and ingenuity.\n\nAmidst Cagliari’s continuous efforts, there were on-field shuffles. Maurizio Isla's acute intelligence on the right tried to conjure openings, but he found his attempts largely negated by Manolas and Emerson. In the 71st minute, a significant defensive contribution from Emerson at left-back prevented a near-certain equalizer from Farias who aimed to exploit any defensive frailties.\n\nAs the game entered its final quarter, the tension palpable, and the stands fervent, Roma had to manage the game intelligently. Francesco Totti's potential inclusion was teased from the bench, although Spalletti opted for defensive reinforcements bringing on Thomas Vermaelen to replace Manolas, preserving the lead.\n\nDiego Perotti, who was lively throughout the match, had another close effort saved by Rafael, showcasing the shot-stopping prowess of the Brazilian keeper. The final minutes saw a flurry of actions, with Roma having multiple chances to seal the game, especially an outstanding delivery from Emerson that found Dzeko whose header hit the crossbar.\n\nControversy loomed when João Pedro was given a straight red card for a deliberate foul, reducing Cagliari to ten men in the dying embers of the game. This mirrored the chaotic end to the first-round fixture where Cagliari managed a dramatic draw with a late red card being shown. However, this time around, Roma managed to see out the remaining minutes efficiently, staving off any final assaults from the Sardinian side.\n\nThe final whistle blew to herald a hard-fought yet narrow 1-0 victory for Roma, consolidating their position in the Serie A standings. This match marked their tenth consecutive home victory in the season, bringing them within striking distance of the league leaders Juventus. It was a resilient performance characterized by tactical discipline, strategic adaptability, and a moment of brilliance from Edin Dzeko. The three points garnered today were not just a testament to the team’s quality and depth but also underscored the astute managerial acumen of Luciano Spalletti. Roma's journey for the Scudetto seemed robust as they prepared for the upcoming challenges with unwavering determination."
