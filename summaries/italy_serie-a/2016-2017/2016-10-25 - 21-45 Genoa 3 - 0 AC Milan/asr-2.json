Comment: full back instead of Abbate.\n2:1 Comment: A very interesting change.\n2:3 Comment: Let's see how Polya adapts to this position,\n2:8 Comment: how useful he will be here.\n2:10 Comment: Well, let's focus all our attention on the game.\n2:14 Comment: Your commentator Dmitry Shnyakin.\n2:17 Comment: Martial arts, not quite of the football kind.\n2:20 Comment: Bai Yinyang.\n2:22 Comment: Appeals to the orbit, appeals to rivals.\n2:25 Comment: A little ado about nothing.\n2:27 Comment: Let's move on.\n2:28 Comment: Deshile throws the ball in from the side,\n2:30 Comment: doesn't do it very well.\n2:32 Comment: Kutska, if that's what he intended, in general,\n2:35 Comment: The translation turned out great on the field.\n2:37 Comment: Here is the field.\n2:39 Comment: On the right flank of the defense.\n2:41 Comment: Accurate pass to partner,\n2:43 Comment: albeit not the most difficult.\n2:44 Comment: The attack went on.\n2:45 Comment: Honda.\n2:47 Comment: He cleverly decided to outwit his opponent with a pass like this.\n2:52 Comment: Cut.\n2:54 Comment: Could he supply a partner.\n2:58 Comment: What a Baka he was.\n2:59 Comment: Well, this is pure play on Bonaventure's part.\n3:4 Comment: Fan whistle.\n3:6 Comment:  I warned.\n3:7 Comment: Here they are vigorously expressing their indignation.\n3:10 Comment: The stands are very close to the field.\n3:13 Comment: And in general, this is a stadium with special energy.\n3:16 Comment: Externally, if you approach it from the street,\n3:19 Comment: nothing too special.\n3:22 Comment: The box almost looks like brick.\n3:27 Comment: But there are impulses inside there.\n3:32 Comment: Lovka unfolds surrounded by several opponents with a rink.\n3:36 Comment: Let's talk about the composition of his lineup.\n3:39 Comment: Let's talk to Jena.\n3:41 Comment: Three central defenders.\n3:43 Comment: The usual Munius, Burdiso and Itzo.\n3:48 Comment: The horse is on the left side.\n3:50 Comment: Denilson is on the right.\n3:51 Comment: Two central sides.\n3:53 Comment: The props of Veloso and Rincom.\n3:56 Comment: The attacking triumvirate.\n3:57 Comment: Ninkovich, Semeone and Regoniy.\n4:3 Comment: I still think that Regonius is in this situation\n4:5 Comment: will spend more time playing along.\n4:8 Comment: Let's just say, in the middle line of the field.\n4:11 Comment: Counterattack of Milan.\n4:12 Comment: Baka attracts several rivals.\n4:14 Comment: Translation into Nyanga.\n4:15 Comment: There is no longer any way to break through right away.\n4:18 Comment: There's a draw going on.\n4:19 Comment: Nyang slips through.\n4:21 Comment: Baka was on horseback.\n4:24 Comment:  Don't think.\n4:25 Comment: There was a large crowd of players there.\n4:27 Comment: It seems to me that Carlos himself could have caught the ball.\n4:30 Comment: In the end, interception.\n4:32 Comment: Jana doesn't play a bad ball.\n4:34 Comment: But so far we haven’t been able to move to someone else’s half of the field.\n4:39 Comment: It turns out that Abbot is on the bench today.\n4:42 Comment: I already talked about this.\n4:44 Comment: The field replaced him.\n4:45 Comment: And Suso.\n4:47 Comment: Suso.\n4:48 Comment: Assist author.\n4:50 Comment: The Spaniard Suso, who started all the matches before in the starting lineup for Milan this season.\n4:57 Comment: And in general, he was one of the team leaders in terms of minutes spent on the field.\n5:3 Comment: I think he's given a break.\n5:5 Comment: And there is, of course, the opportunity to cheer up the same Kei Honda a little.\n5:10 Comment: Which chances were, frankly speaking, slim.\n5:13 Comment: Kutska played great here.\n5:16 Comment: Basically, I freed Paleta from some work.\n5:22 Comment: Honda.\n5:25 Comment: Played from the fields.\n5:26 Comment: And it receives the return transmission.\n5:28 Comment: But the Honda's distance speed is not outstanding.\n5:31 Comment: Still, he is, first of all, good at his work with the ball.\n5:35 Comment: Honda appeared on the field for the third time this season in a Serie A match.\n5:39 Comment: And for the first time in the starting lineup in the game with Udinezov, he came out for 10 minutes.\n5:44 Comment: Latso is also 8-10 at the end.\n5:48 Comment:  No more.\n5:49 Comment: Well, as they say, he is doing well at the base, in the Milanella training process.\n5:57 Comment: And, in general, he deserved it.\n6:0 Comment: The serve into the penalty area, plus Honda had a minor injury.\n6:6 Comment: Deschelho is pressing.\n6:9 Comment: He didn't do it very well.\n6:11 Comment: So far, Milan's T-shirts look snow-white and impressive.\n6:15 Comment: By the way, in the last season, I must say, everything is in order with the taste of the technical sponsor of the Milanese.\n6:24 Comment: And the T-shirts look quite original and impressive.\n6:29 Comment: Matija Perin.\n6:30 Comment: Perine.\n6:32 Comment: Also a character who wants to talk a lot.\n6:35 Comment: But let's wait for the opportunity when he shows himself in action.\n6:40 Comment: Rigoni is picking up speed.\n6:41 Comment: He passes to Ede Nilsson on the right flank.\n6:43 Comment: Ede Nilson also likes to tinker with the ball.\n6:45 Comment: More on to Rincon, Ede Neilson.\n6:49 Comment: And even deeper on Itso.\n6:51 Comment: Well, it’s already come to the defenders.\n6:54 Comment: Munius.\n6:56 Comment: Munius, as you remember, there was a lot of talk regarding his possible move to Spartak Moscow.\n7:4 Comment:  In my time.\n7:6 Comment: But we know another defender from Italy.\n7:11 Comment: Moved to Spartak.\n7:12 Comment: To be honest, it's a complete mystery to me.\n7:15 Comment: Why was it useful?\n7:17 Comment: Okay, let's not go from a sore head to a healthy one.\n7:25 Comment: Pass along the flank and serve from somewhere in the sand pit.\n7:29 Comment: Didn't the ball go there during its flight?\n7:32 Comment: Yes, yes, gesture.\n7:34 Comment: Luca Banti's gesture leaves no other options.\n7:40 Comment: It was played in an original way.\n7:42 Comment: And Ede Neilson is good at his passing.\n7:45 Comment: Again, an important skill for a wide player.\n7:51 Comment: He boldly goes into the tapping, even if more than one player from his opponents is in his way.\n7:58 Comment: Transfer to Nyanga.\n8:0 Comment: Even in a fall, he manages to perform some unimaginable pass.\n8:4 Comment: We were breathing between our opponent's legs.\n8:6 Comment: Everything so far she passes on a thin skillfully.\n8:8 Comment: No wonder it ends up being a loss.\n8:13 Comment: Roman Yoli played great in this situation.\n8:16 Comment: And he walked forward himself.\n8:17 Comment: By the way, very tactical, wise, competent.\n8:21 Comment: This is what a confident defender should be like.\n8:25 Comment: I made an interception.\n8:26 Comment: High.\n8:28 Comment: In the opponent's half of the field.\n8:30 Comment: So go ahead.\n8:32 Comment: Let them reward you in Ingrai with a return pass.\n8:35 Comment: By the way, I think Roman Yoli is still somewhere near someone else’s penalty area.\n8:40 Comment: Well, there won't be any need for an extra player.\n8:42 Comment: It will still be necessary, because Milan...\n8:45 Comment: No, it’s only here that Roman Yoli showed up.\n8:48 Comment: Basically, he hid.\n8:50 Comment: Missed the shot.\n8:51 Comment: It seemed to me that I was already completely brave.\n8:54 Comment: Milan is conducting a positional attack.\n8:56 Comment: In large forces, almost everyone is in Jenu's half of the field.\n9:1 Comment: But the corner wasn't even earned.\n9:3 Comment: The big question is what kind of emotional background Milan will have today.\n9:7 Comment: Well, it’s itching, of course, yes, to say that they’re stifled.\n9:12 Comment: They're on a roll and so on.\n9:14 Comment: But very little time has passed.\n9:17 Comment:  Very little.\n9:18 Comment:  Sunday.\n9:20 Comment: They were probably still celebrating this victory there.\n9:24 Comment: It’s not a fact that recovery training was effective.\n9:32 Comment:  Monday.\n9:33 Comment: And that's all.\n9:34 Comment: Tuesday. Game.\n9:36 Comment: Only two days.\n9:37 Comment: Footballers themselves always say that they like to play more than to train.\n9:41 Comment: And yet, we saw these faces after the Juventus game.\n9:46 Comment: Of course, there was a lot of happiness in them.\n9:50 Comment: And other such outstanding facial expressions.\n9:52 Comment: But we understand that the Milan players were very tired then.\n9:57 Comment: It was a very energy-intensive game.\n10:1 Comment: Especially the start of it.\n10:2 Comment: Remember what the speeds were.\n10:5 Comment: Let's move on.\n10:6 Comment: For now we have no...\n10:7 Comment: It's not like there are no scoring chances.\n10:8 Comment: We don't even have any blows.\n10:10 Comment: It's a little confusing for now.\n10:11 Comment: And Denison as a partner.\n10:14 Comment:  Further.\n10:15 Comment: Egg.\n10:17 Comment: See how deep the center backs are moving forward.\n10:23 Comment: Jenu.\n10:24 Comment: Rincon is turning around.\n10:25 Comment: There is an opportunity to shoot from the left.\n10:26 Comment: He still serves and...\n10:27 Comment: GOOOOL!\n10:30 Comment: 1-0!\n10:32 Comment: Jenu is ahead.\n10:36 Comment: It was wonderfully played.\n10:39 Comment: We cooked porridge on the right flank.\n10:41 Comment: We gave several passes to Rincon, who knows how to deal one on one.\n10:46 Comment: Rincona, of course, met his opponent at a respectful distance.\n10:50 Comment:  Who was that?\n10:51 Comment: It was Locotelli.\n10:52 Comment: In the end, the pitch.\n10:53 Comment: No offside.\n10:54 Comment: And a lucky nod in the fall from...\n11:4 Comment: Nikola Ninkovich.\n11:10 Comment: 1-0!\n11:14 Comment: And the presentation, of course, was amazing.\n11:17 Comment: Because it is good because several Jenu football players could respond to it at once.\n11:24 Comment: Ninkovich did it.\n11:27 Comment: The Servian attacking midfielder is playing his fourth match for Jena.\n11:36 Comment: This is the fourth match in a row.\n11:38 Comment: But this is his first game as a starter.\n11:42 Comment: And he proves to the coach, also a Balkan, so that you understand that this choice was not made in vain.\n11:52 Comment: Let me remind you that the Croatian specialist Ivan Yurievich is in charge of Jena.\n11:58 Comment: Well, Nikola Ninkovich is a server.\n12:0 Comment: Well, I must say that Jenu had more possession of the ball in these minutes.\n12:15 Comment: There were more approaches to the opponent's penalty area.\n12:18 Comment: But, essentially, this is the first blow, the first even some kind of half chance.\n12:23 Comment: And all this turns into a son-in-law at the gate.\n12:25 Comment: I must say that here the entire Milan defense, of course, did not act in the best way.\n12:30 Comment: And when we talk about defense, we mean, of course, defensive midfielders as well.\n12:35 Comment: And Locotelli was, of course, wrong in this situation.\n12:38 Comment: He should have held Rincon tighter.\n12:42 Comment: As a result, he even allowed him to aim without any hindrance, to see where he would make this serve.\n12:48 Comment: Well, Ninkovich was already there, not covered by anyone.\n12:51 Comment: But it was a spectacular, spectacular goal.\n12:54 Comment: Still, they still had to come up with such a fish drug.\n13:0 Comment: Other people might even have started handling the ball, and so on.\n13:4 Comment: But, in fact, it was not so.\n13:7 Comment: Other people might even have started handling the ball, so on, so on.\n13:12 Comment: But in 10-11 minutes Jen managed to do this,\n13:20 Comment: What Juventus failed to achieve in all 90 years.\n13:23 Comment: Well, it’s clear that it’s probably pointless to compare here.\n13:26 Comment: And yet, we see that Jena is playing in the hunt, in the attack.\n13:31 Comment: Plays with variety, moving the ball from one flank to the other.\n13:36 Comment: Well, maybe, again, there are not enough shots, some penetrations into the penalty area.\n13:41 Comment: But once was enough.\n13:46 Comment: And Jen continues to hold the ball,\n13:48 Comment: You know, every minute I understand more and more what Mantel was talking about.\n13:52 Comment: I think you already guessed it yourself.\n13:56 Comment: It's about motivation and the ability of the team\n14:1 Comment: get yourself ready for a match, maybe not with a grandee,\n14:5 Comment: But still with a team that has a pretty good class of players.\n14:11 Comment: Baka on the right edge changes the game.\n14:14 Comment: Honda is here, he wins the duel and earns a corner.\n14:18 Comment: He didn't get that ball.\n14:22 Comment: In general, the corners are also stretching.\n14:25 Comment: For such a game, under such a game, this is not the worst option for Milan.\n14:31 Comment: Keisky Honda, he takes this corner, well, of course, with his native left.\n14:37 Comment: He will spin the ball into the penalty area, at the near post, at Bonaventure.\n14:42 Comment: He's winning the fight.\n14:44 Comment: Bunty doesn't whistle enough, and he doesn't whistle here either,\n14:48 Comment: giving the opponent the opportunity to fight on the edge.\n14:54 Comment: And you see, he could have whistled here and there.\n14:57 Comment: But I didn't do it.\n14:59 Comment: In the end, it turned out to be a pretty dynamic episode.\n15:1 Comment: Yes, the ball is lost.\n15:4 Comment:  But nonetheless,\n15:8 Comment: At least there are no unnecessary disputes.\n15:12 Comment: Zheno continues to dominate the middle of the field.\n15:16 Comment: So far, of course, you don’t feel any energy, yes, in Milan’s game.\n15:20 Comment: Agree, they treat their opponents poorly.\n15:24 Comment: It’s a little late, yes, when the opponent gets the opportunity to fight on the edge.\n15:29 Comment: But, nevertheless, this, of course, is not all.\n15:32 Comment: And, of course, that's certainly not all.\n15:34 Comment: But, nevertheless, this, of course, is not all.\n15:36 Comment: The opponent is greeted lowly. It's a bit late, yes, when the opponent gets the opportunity\n15:41 Comment: and handle the ball and play with someone.\n15:44 Comment: In general, Milan does not create a numerical majority in moments of pressure.\n15:49 Comment: And this is almost the main point, not the main parameter.\n15:53 Comment: For example, yes, well, judging by the Russian championship,\n15:57 Comment: how Rostov works.\n15:59 Comment: If the opponent receives the ball in a certain area, three players immediately rush there.\n16:5 Comment: From different sides they press, press and leave no choice.\n16:12 Comment: It's a little different here.\n16:15 Comment: The Milanese must now force themselves to cheer up through the I can’t.\n16:22 Comment: Finding the ball in the end, finding the way to Jen's penalty area.\n16:26 Comment: Because, well, we haven't gotten any opportunity yet\n16:31 Comment: look at this fly agaric beard of Mate Perin.\n16:42 Comment: I don't know why he grew it like that.\n16:43 Comment: Well, in general, he was always distinguished by the hair on his head.\n16:53 Comment: Great Jena goes on a counterattack.\n16:55 Comment: Three by three, even at some point she could have turned out like this.\n17:0 Comment: But the full-backs still keep up here.\n17:2 Comment: The same De Chi Illen.\n17:5 Comment: It's Neilson, yes.\n17:7 Comment: Obviously, yes, he will clean up for himself, realizing that there are no options to expand the attack further.\n17:14 Comment: Ivan Yuryevich’s team is working very competently, very competently now.\n17:20 Comment: Based on the result and the situation, in such moments you should never give the ball to your opponent.\n17:28 Comment: When he has already scored one goal, we need to force him to open up, open up under pressure.\n17:37 Comment: You can replay this way.\n17:41 Comment: Ring.\n17:48 Comment: Further to the left edge.\n17:49 Comment: Viloso has the ball here.\n17:51 Comment: Viloza's are good, yes, these are the diagonals.\n17:53 Comment: And he will over-praise.\n17:57 Comment: Well, Vilosu really, we know him.\n18:0 Comment: We know his style of play.\n18:3 Comment: More from the same Ukrainian championship.\n18:9 Comment: Can he make such a sharp, long pass at once, at the moment.\n18:18 Comment: In this case, the accuracy was not enough.\n18:23 Comment: Genoa has an advantage in the fight, see?\n18:25 Comment: He is now on the wing of lonely Baku, which again only has the ball.\n18:32 Comment: Runs from one opponent to another.\n18:35 Comment: Well, looking for some kind of error.\n18:37 Comment: Rinko, he's, oh, he's so good in the first few minutes.\n18:40 Comment: Accelerating.\n18:41 Comment: There's such an obvious option on the right.\n18:43 Comment: But in the end they transfer to the left flank, to loxalto.\n18:48 Comment: Ruguaev will make one pause, then another.\n18:50 Comment: And in the end the presentation is strong.\n18:56 Comment: Donna Ruma doesn't dare approach her.\n19:0 Comment: Well, actually, it was done correctly.\n19:6 Comment: Look, another rebound.\n19:8 Comment:  Let's get a look.\n19:9 Comment: Let's see, wait for the next moment when Milan takes possession of the ball.\n19:16 Comment: How quickly, in how many seconds will he return back to Jen.\n19:22 Comment: A huge number of losses.\n19:24 Comment: And here we are not only talking about Milan’s unpreparedness for the start of this match.\n19:30 Comment: Poor preparation of Milan for the start of this match.\n19:32 Comment: It’s also about how competently Genua puts pressure on the opponent.\n19:38 Comment: And forces the ball to be given away.\n19:41 Comment: Here, most likely, yes, offsite.\n19:48 Comment: Well, this probably won’t be the most typical case.\n19:50 Comment: Still, now Milan will play this ball from a standard position.\n19:54 Comment: And we see that Deshiil still managed to retreat, driving his opponent offside.\n20:2 Comment: But still, for the purity of the experiment, a situation is needed when in a game episode Milan intercepts the ball.\n20:10 Comment: And I wonder how long they will get along later.\n20:13 Comment: But for now there has been a positional attack.\n20:15 Comment: No one is in a hurry here.\n20:16 Comment: Nyang has been sent to the flank.\n20:18 Comment: Two people greet him immediately.\n20:20 Comment: See what I'm talking about?\n20:22 Comment: Immediately all the options to play on the short side, blocked by Milan.\n20:27 Comment: And Nyang, well, especially here even with the time and distance limits, has to serve.\n20:35 Comment: Just hit there, backhandedly, forward.\n20:42 Comment: As we see, nothing good came of this.\n20:45 Comment: 21 minutes are essentially over.\n20:48 Comment: Genoa and Milan open the first round.\n20:53 Comment: The first match opens the 10th round of the Italian Championship.\n20:58 Comment: And so far we have a kind of mini-sensation.\n21:1 Comment: Although, again, Milan’s loss of points here is unlikely to be considered a sensation.\n21:9 Comment: But, for example, Genua’s victory will be somewhat unexpected.\n21:14 Comment: Roman Yoli on a pallet.\n21:16 Comment: Come on, hurry up, cheer up Milan.\n21:20 Comment: They are chewing this ball in the middle of the field, the griffins have sat a little deeper.\n21:26 Comment: They flew back.\n21:28 Comment: Pallet.\n21:29 Comment: Few, few options.\n21:31 Comment: Well, Honda was found not far from someone else's penalty area.\n21:35 Comment: And further on to Roman Yoli.\n21:37 Comment: There is space in front of him, you can even try to break through.\n21:40 Comment: And here comes the blow! Not bad!\n21:43 Comment:  Why not?\n21:45 Comment: Why not? The only thing that confuses me is this small gap that Roman Yoli made.\n21:49 Comment: He didn't come up with this ready-made solution right away.\n21:52 Comment: Still, at first he thought about making a pass.\n21:55 Comment: And then I realized that absolutely no one was meeting him here.\n21:58 Comment: And you have to hit.\n21:59 Comment: I did everything right.\n22:1 Comment: All that's left is to hit the target.\n22:3 Comment: By the way, the trajectory of this ball was good.\n22:6 Comment: But the bearded forester Mateo Perin seemed to be in control here.\n22:18 Comment: It's also interesting.\n22:19 Comment: Everyone's talking about Donorum now.\n22:21 Comment: The only talk is that this is a 17-year-old talent, Bufon’s replacement, and so on.\n22:28 Comment: But the previous goalkeeper, who was talked about so much, was Mateo Perin.\n22:35 Comment: And at one time there were conversations, among other things, about the possibility of his transfer to Milan.\n22:42 Comment: Born in the city of Latina.\n22:46 Comment: He can dance on a ribbon and get some incredible balls.\n22:51 Comment: The penalty was saved, for example.\n22:52 Comment: In my opinion, completely unfairly appointed in the Genoese derby.\n22:58 Comment: It was there that Perin was involved in the episode.\n23:5 Comment: Palette on your screens.\n23:9 Comment: He spent last season on loan at Talent.\n23:13 Comment: And it seems that somehow this option with a pallet has even been forgotten.\n23:16 Comment: There is Eli, there are other defenders.\n23:21 Comment: In general, we can come up with a partner for Romagnoli.\n23:24 Comment: But in the end I gave the experienced pallet a chance.\n23:29 Comment: Mantello also played well at the training camp.\n23:32 Comment: Later on, I got time in Serie A games.\n23:37 Comment: Nyang continues to make noise.\n23:39 Comment: Rigoni senses injustice.\n23:43 Comment: Because he played the ball.\n23:45 Comment: I think I'll agree with the referee.\n23:49 Comment: Of course, we didn’t observe anything violent here.\n23:53 Comment: But of course, it's still the same as we see that it was a foul ball.\n23:57 Comment: We, of course, did not observe a motionless arbitrator.\n23:59 Comment: But the jump itself was dangerous.\n24:3 Comment: Many people argue about such episodes.\n24:5 Comment: But imagine for a moment that he literally makes it\n24:9 Comment: At the last moment, put your ankle in the path of the accelerating opponent.\n24:15 Comment: In this case it was Nyang.\n24:18 Comment: A slight touch with an elevated foot will be enough to cause injury.\n24:23 Comment: That's why the free kick. Another thing is that Milan wasn't convinced with this free kick.\n24:29 Comment: Locotelli throws the ball away for the opponent.\n24:33 Comment: Locotelli, of course, was also a big hero of the last match against Juventus.\n24:38 Comment: Also very young, 18 years old.\n24:44 Comment: Milan is proud of its youth and this seemingly justified bet on the young.\n24:51 Comment: Well, Perin takes the ball that was rolling into his hands very comfortably.\n24:58 Comment: That's all for now.\n24:59 Comment: No, Milan, of course, perked up.\n25:1 Comment: We see more ideas, more movement with and without the ball.\n25:7 Comment: But for now, this is not beyond the task for Jenu’s defenders.\n25:15 Comment: By the way, they are good defenders, if we talk about the three central ones.\n25:19 Comment: Now there was work for the defenders of Milan.\n25:25 Comment: True, Don Narumo was ahead of everyone.\n25:27 Comment: The transfer was not the most dangerous and cunning.\n25:33 Comment: We're pretty predictive.\n25:34 Comment: Bonaventure.\n25:37 Comment: Locotelli.\n25:38 Comment: So far it's all back.\n25:39 Comment: Paletta.\n25:40 Comment: These transfers need to be done faster, faster.\n25:42 Comment: Here, here, well, 2 seconds earlier this pass could have taken place.\n25:49 Comment: And this one too.\n25:50 Comment: They're slow, they're slow.\n25:52 Comment: Again, let these be passes between the holding midfielder and the central defender.\n25:57 Comment: But they must pass at other speeds.\n26:0 Comment: Because the very next moment the situation on the field may change.\n26:4 Comment: There may be a pocket, a corridor where you can direct this ball.\n26:9 Comment: Just faster.\n26:10 Comment: Roman Yole, Nyan.\n26:12 Comment: Well, there you go, you see.\n26:14 Comment: We see that the culture is quite simple passing.\n26:18 Comment: Now Milan is limping.\n26:22 Comment: And this suggests that there is something wrong with concentration.\n26:29 Comment: Breaking the rules.\n26:30 Comment: Locotelli.\n26:34 Comment: Miguel Veloso is also in the spotlight.\n26:38 Comment: In my opinion, this is a guaranteed yellow card.\n26:42 Comment: Guaranteed yellow card.\n26:49 Comment: Without even a second's thought at all.\n26:59 Comment: Yes, here we are forced to state this fact.\n27:4 Comment: Did you notice? Look.\n27:6 Comment: Well, here, of course, there is a little more specific repetition.\n27:11 Comment: Both players who did not play in the starting lineup against Juventus were out of work.\n27:20 Comment: That is, those two players who, perhaps somewhat unexpectedly, appeared in the lineup today.\n27:25 Comment: It's Paul and Honda.\n27:27 Comment: It was the two of them who guarded the corn, as they say, on the far corner of the penalty area.\n27:34 Comment: And they, these two nannies, have a child, not exactly without an eye.\n27:42 Comment: It's a child.\n27:45 Comment: It was a very nice ball.\n27:47 Comment: And they both overslept.\n27:49 Comment: These are nannies themselves without eyes.\n27:53 Comment: How, again, it’s amazing how this episode was viewed here.\n27:56 Comment: Either they wanted to again organize an offsite, an offsite trap.\n28:2 Comment: For that same Ninkovich. I don't understand.\n28:7 Comment: Pole and Honda, as the culprits, along with Locotelli, as the culprits of this missed goal.\n28:14 Comment: And in any case, they were the closest players to Ninkovich.\n28:18 Comment: We congratulate Ninkovich on his first goal this season.\n28:31 Comment: 21 year old young attacking midfielder.\n28:38 Comment: This is his second team in his Italian career.\n28:41 Comment: In 2016, he moved from Partizan to Kiev.\n28:45 Comment: I played there quite a bit in the second match.\n28:48 Comment: And now he’s already in Genoa, where they trust a little more.\n28:53 Comment: Family youth team player.\n29:2 Comment: Throw ahead to Honda. He gives a good discount.\n29:5 Comment: Baka. Baka will fall down of his own free will without any help from his opponent.\n29:17 Comment: 30 minutes of the game are over and Milan is not impressing, and maybe even some of its fans are depressing with such a game.\n29:29 Comment: A completely different tempo needs to be switched on now.\n29:33 Comment: So far these replacements, probably aimed at some kind of refreshment, have not justified themselves.\n29:40 Comment: I mean Paul and Honda.\n29:43 Comment: Actually, both were also involved in the missed goal.\n29:47 Comment: Ingson is playing great.\n29:49 Comment: But for now, of course, the pleasure is the football that Jena shows.\n29:55 Comment: From the point of view of strategy and fulfillment of coaching tasks, they are probably doing an excellent job now.\n30:7 Comment: I emphasize, they work. Because they played in the first 15 minutes.\n30:12 Comment: Now the plowing has begun, we need to defend ourselves.\n30:15 Comment: Ninkovic is already here. Notice how quickly some of the attacking players rushed towards Ninkovic's penalty area.\n30:32 Comment: Wider, but now again we need to tease the opponent with the ball, who has already run quite a few kilometers without this very ball.\n30:45 Comment: He reeled it in. Now Montello is already in a standing position.\n30:52 Comment: He already has such a rather nervous tip for his players.\n31:0 Comment: Milan's actions lack nerves.\n31:4 Comment: There may even be some irritation, like a reaction to a missed goal.\n31:10 Comment: As for me, Milan now plays as if the score is 0-0.\n31:14 Comment: Perine. Long pass forward.\n31:18 Comment: Luxurious diagonal Denilson.\n31:21 Comment: Milan's entire midfield is now outplayed.\n31:24 Comment: Basically, it’s a failure, but Denilson also takes a pause and Milan’s midfielders manage to return.\n31:31 Comment: Everything has to do with it, right?\n31:34 Comment: Ninkovich. Continue to Velozum.\n31:41 Comment: Velozum. He also makes a neat pass.\n31:49 Comment: It’s also interesting to look at Mr. Niang today.\n31:57 Comment: I think many of you are aware that at a certain stage of his Italian career he performed in Genoa.\n32:8 Comment: Actually from Genoa he returned to Milan.\n32:11 Comment: We rented and showed ourselves well in Genoa.\n32:16 Comment: But more on that later. There is a numerical advantage on the right flank.\n32:19 Comment: Paulie! Hit right at the defender.\n32:22 Comment: Two partners were perfectly open. He had two free throws in front of him.\n32:28 Comment: No violation of the rules. Bravo Bunty. Let's fight to the end.\n32:32 Comment: Perhaps somewhere here the line has already been passed.\n32:37 Comment: But he is principled. He did not reprimand anyone for the previous episode.\n32:45 Comment: And here he lets play.\n32:48 Comment: Another thing is that all this is fraught with damage.\n32:52 Comment: Here the referee needs to feel when there is not just a tough attempt to take the ball away.\n33:0 Comment: And there is a deliberate play on the opponent's body.\n33:3 Comment: It’s more of an accident here. As I understand it, they show us cuts from all kinds of joints.\n33:10 Comment: This is more of a video compilation that shapes the viewer's opinion about Bunty's work.\n33:18 Comment: During all these episodes, as I understand it, he didn’t blow the whistle.\n33:22 Comment: What our football players, online football players, and coaches regularly talk about.\n33:30 Comment: All sorts of football specialists.\n33:33 Comment: That supposedly our coaches don’t allow us to fight like this.\n33:37 Comment: Not in all matches, I disagree.\n33:40 Comment: What is worth, for example, is the memorable work of Alexei Nikolaev in the meeting of Lokomotiv Spartak.\n33:45 Comment: Nevertheless, it seems to me that games like this and Bunty’s refereeing are an example to follow.\n33:50 Comment: Yang picks up speed, gets away from three people at once, but is fumbling.\n33:57 Comment: A little earlier, we probably should have raised our heads at least in search of some kind of role-playing option.\n34:7 Comment: But Young was only thinking about winning.\n34:13 Comment: This is where Perin is wrong.\n34:17 Comment: Everything is quietly approaching the end of the first half.\n34:21 Comment: And here Milan, as a team, is probably a little more ambitious, if we are talking about this season, and in general.\n34:29 Comment: In general, we need to improve.\n34:31 Comment: Increase, act more aggressively.\n34:35 Comment: The last 10 minutes of the first half.\n34:38 Comment: Roman Yoli is smart with the ball.\n34:42 Comment: Pass to Young, but he has already galloped out of the zone where Roman Yoli sent the ball.\n34:49 Comment: French striker.\n34:56 Comment: With Singai roots.\n34:58 Comment: Genoa football has become too defensive in my opinion.\n35:8 Comment: Still, they maintained a certain balance.\n35:11 Comment: And in the first couple of minutes after scoring a goal, they tried to defend by controlling the ball.\n35:16 Comment: Still, no one canceled the golden rule.\n35:19 Comment: As long as you have the ball, they won't score on you.\n35:22 Comment: But right now it's purely a defensive posture.\n35:26 Comment: Kutska.\n35:28 Comment: You see, every ball near Genoa's penalty kick is taken by the Milan players.\n35:35 Comment: Every time we meet one, two, or even three opponents.\n35:39 Comment: That's how Benaventura is on their feet now. There were almost four of them.\n35:43 Comment: Rincount.\n35:44 Comment: Rincount exposes the body.\n35:47 Comment: Of course, I wanted to build an out here from the opponent’s fifth point.\n35:52 Comment: But it turned out to be not soft like a football.\n35:55 Comment: The ball bounced into the field.\n35:57 Comment: Benaventura.\n35:59 Comment: It's picking up speed.\n36:0 Comment: Here you go again, you see, all these labyrinths and closed corridors,\n36:4 Comment: They start playing around.\n36:6 Comment: Well, how could it be otherwise?\n36:8 Comment: You need at least one successful play to gain a numerical advantage in a particular area of ​​the field.\n36:15 Comment: The pallet makes the pitch.\n36:17 Comment:  Discount.\n36:19 Comment: It's all in emptiness.\n36:21 Comment: Well, at least none of the Milan players are there.\n36:24 Comment: But the Genoa players are extremely concentrated and attentive.\n36:32 Comment: Roman Yuliem.\n36:33 Comment: More on to the pallet.\n36:35 Comment: A little more width, of course, Milan could play here.\n36:38 Comment: To pull up this very defense, which has so far been operating unmistakably, who is there, who is here.\n36:45 Comment: You see, in the end everything comes to a head-on attack through the center.\n36:51 Comment: Where is Honda, where is Nyan on the flanks?\n36:55 Comment: Well, you see how in this positional attack the flanks are occupied by defenders on the far right, with Deshileo on the left.\n37:3 Comment: Both Honda and Nyan saturate the center.\n37:5 Comment: You see where Nyan is?\n37:7 Comment: And there's Honda.\n37:9 Comment: White-headed.\n37:12 Comment: Yes, but if this continues, then, of course, I think, in the second half, if we see Honda, then maybe for a few minutes.\n37:23 Comment: Suso, I think he's already rubbing himself there.\n37:28 Comment: Here comes the next finish.\n37:30 Comment: Milan's unconvincing positional attacks.\n37:33 Comment: Long forward passes.\n37:35 Comment: Ricochet, that's all.\n37:37 Comment: I said that Milan had a very good period.\n37:40 Comment: The last time the Rossoneri lost to Dineso in the third round match with a score of 0-1.\n37:46 Comment: There was such a sensation after that.\n37:49 Comment: Victory over Sambdori.\n37:50 Comment: By the way, at the same stadium with the score 1-0.\n37:53 Comment: Victory over La Zio 2-0.\n37:55 Comment: 0-0 with fairly high-quality football with broadcasting.\n37:59 Comment: Well, then those same three victories in a row.\n38:1 Comment: Over Suso, over Keven, over Juventus.\n38:3 Comment: All in all, a good move.\n38:5 Comment: We also remember the victory in the first round over Torino with a score of 3-2.\n38:9 Comment: It was also a brilliant match.\n38:11 Comment: And this is Milan's best start since the 2008-2009 season.\n38:18 Comment: Paletta is wearing these dance t-shirts.\n38:21 Comment: And this, of course, is very good.\n38:23 Comment: Good start from Milan.\n38:25 Comment: And this is also Milan's best start since the 2008-2009 season.\n38:30 Comment: Palette is in such almost dance movements.\n38:34 Comment: Breakdancing.\n38:37 Comment: Takes the ball out of the opponent's feet.\n38:39 Comment: And Gabriel fought to the end here.\n38:44 Comment: Stern and gloomy.\n38:49 Comment: Cool, by the way, I figured it out.\n38:50 Comment:  to him.\n39:20 Comment: Hurray! Oh, but it wasn't very nice here.\n39:23 Comment: Playfully hit in the eyes.\n39:26 Comment: Nyang from Itsom.\n39:39 Comment: Itso also received a yellow card\n39:42 Comment: He gets an autologist for such tricks.\n39:46 Comment: Still, it seems to me that he did it on purpose. Yes, yes.\n39:49 Comment: Absolutely consciously.\n39:51 Comment: By the way, he calmly caught up with this ball.\n39:53 Comment: I don't understand why it was necessary to do this\n39:56 Comment: brutally brush it off.\n39:58 Comment:  AND...\n40:0 Comment: Also a conversation session on\n40:3 Comment: The great and mighty Italian.\n40:6 Comment: It's interesting that Itso and Niang played together in the jam.\n40:13 Comment: Maybe something else from some training there.\n40:16 Comment: Something is wrong in their relationship.\n40:19 Comment: But it's easy to reach the ball.\n40:21 Comment: They easily leave this game situation behind them.\n40:23 Comment: Footballers Jenu, they are not only that\n40:25 Comment: and got to the ball first,\n40:27 Comment: so also\n40:29 Comment: Romagnole broke the rules.\n40:34 Comment: I can't figure out where.\n40:36 Comment: Oh, well, they probably took a close-up of Romagnole for us.\n40:39 Comment: Oh, Paletto was wrong.\n40:41 Comment: Anyway,\n40:43 Comment: The mortal Genoese body lay near Paletto.\n40:49 Comment: Simeone\n40:51 Comment: virtually no ball.\n40:53 Comment: Works almost the entire first half.\n40:55 Comment: I don't remember him being involved in the Togol attack.\n40:57 Comment: But, probably, he distracted the opponent with his movements.\n40:59 Comment:  No more.\n41:1 Comment: Pass Nyanga on Honda.\n41:3 Comment: Honda returns the penalty.\n41:5 Comment: Bakan Young!\n41:7 Comment: Well, here's something worthwhile at least.\n41:9 Comment: In a somewhat similar beach-football style\n41:11 Comment: or in volleyball mode the ball did not land on the lawn.\n41:15 Comment: And Nyang is on time for the Honda.\n41:17 Comment: And Honda to Baku.\n41:19 Comment: And Buck carefully returned it to Nyanga.\n41:21 Comment: He hit it right.\n41:23 Comment: In my opinion, a justified decision.\n41:25 Comment: All that's left is to get there.\n41:27 Comment: Great, huh?\n41:29 Comment: The first attack, during which everyone\n41:31 Comment: from this trimberat,\n41:33 Comment: attacking Milansky, participated\n41:35 Comment: by some action.\n41:37 Comment: Pass or hit.\n41:39 Comment: Locotelli did a great job.\n41:41 Comment: Well, by the way, you can too\n41:43 Comment: in this case, give a verbal warning\n41:45 Comment: Veloso.\n41:47 Comment: Somehow he was especially annoying.\n41:51 Comment: Bonaventure on Descillo.\n41:53 Comment: Further to Kutskun.\n41:55 Comment: Kucka turns around.\n41:57 Comment: Two of them covered him here.\n41:59 Comment: No options.\n42:1 Comment: Ede Nielsen\n42:3 Comment: dances away.\n42:5 Comment: Danced here\n42:7 Comment: on the right flank.\n42:9 Comment: And the ball is already on the left.\n42:11 Comment: Because it passes instantly\n42:13 Comment: in staku Genua.\n42:15 Comment: All that's left is to break through.\n42:17 Comment: Well, or make a pitch.\n42:19 Comment: It's a good presentation.\n42:21 Comment: Could have reached Rigoni's ball.\n42:23 Comment: That's why Descillo didn't take any risks.\n42:43 Comment: Let's look at the standard.\n42:45 Comment: The last minutes of the first half.\n42:47 Comment: Corner twist\n42:49 Comment: Gian Luigi Donna Ruma.\n42:51 Comment: Who, of course, was praised after the match with Juventus.\n42:53 Comment: He is, in principle, together with Locotelli\n42:55 Comment: also became one of the main characters.\n42:57 Comment: Remember, in the last seconds\n42:59 Comment: dragged\n43:1 Comment: excellent\n43:3 Comment: such a ball thrown\n43:5 Comment: Hidiroi.\n43:7 Comment: It was a great trajectory\n43:9 Comment: that blow.\n43:11 Comment: It seems to me that the ball could have landed there after all.\n43:13 Comment: at nine.\n43:15 Comment:  OK.\n43:17 Comment:  This is all\n43:19 Comment: things, albeit recent ones,\n43:21 Comment: but days gone by.\n43:23 Comment: And Donna Ruma, of course,\n43:25 Comment: basking in this glory.\n43:27 Comment:  Too early\n43:29 Comment: appeared\n43:31 Comment: states that\n43:33 Comment: They will definitely rewrite the contract.\n43:35 Comment: Who watched the game\n43:37 Comment: against Juventus\n43:40 Comment: I described that situation in detail.\n43:42 Comment: In short,\n43:44 Comment: of course Milan wants it\n43:46 Comment: extend the agreement\n43:48 Comment: and increase many times\n43:50 Comment: many, many times the salary\n43:52 Comment: Ruma's Donna, but\n43:54 Comment: a lot depends on\n43:56 Comment: Mina Raiola, famous agent,\n43:58 Comment: who handles Donna Ruma's affairs.\n44:0 Comment: He stated that\n44:2 Comment: as soon as it happens\n44:4 Comment: This deal has been fixed\n44:6 Comment: with Chinese investors,\n44:8 Comment: Then, of course, the money will be in Milan.\n44:10 Comment: Then we'll talk about extending the contract.\n44:12 Comment: Galianni of all\n44:14 Comment: convinced\n44:16 Comment: the other day, he said that\n44:18 Comment: Donna Ruma is not going anywhere from us.\n44:20 Comment: He will definitely extend the contract.\n44:22 Comment: But we're not talking about Donna Room yet.\n44:24 Comment: He probably hardly could somehow\n44:26 Comment: help the team\n44:28 Comment: in the episode with Ninkovich's goal.\n44:32 Comment: Although it seems to be in the near corner\n44:34 Comment: The ball was heading, but there was still a ricochet\n44:36 Comment: not shown\n44:38 Comment: close range strike.\n44:40 Comment: What is there to talk about here?\n44:42 Comment: That's the story here,\n44:44 Comment: that we should rather talk about feather beds more often.\n44:46 Comment: But there are all these penalty standards,\n44:48 Comment: approaches,\n44:50 Comment: faded, without dangerous blows,\n44:52 Comment: Honda hands over the entire top, remove\n44:54 Comment: Jen's football players.\n44:56 Comment: Well, you know\n44:58 Comment: a little bit like that...\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Ninkovich jumped and opened the scoring with a header.\n0:5 Comment: 1-0, Geno ahead, second half.\n0:9 Comment: Well, let's be more cheerful.\n0:11 Comment: Let's wake up a little, this is a message to the football players too\n0:14 Comment: Milan about the composition.\n0:16 Comment:  No changes.\n0:18 Comment: Geno has feather feathers in the goal, Munoz Burgiso is in the center of the defenders\n0:24 Comment: and Tsom.\n0:25 Comment: Flanked by Laxald on the left and Denilson on the right.\n0:28 Comment: Veloso and Rincón are in the center of midfield.\n0:32 Comment: A free throw, that's not bad anymore.\n0:34 Comment: In any case, if it were a little lower, this pitch\n0:37 Comment: If Baka won the position, he could headbutt him.\n0:41 Comment: Ninkovich, Semeone and Rigoni in Geno's attack.\n0:45 Comment: At Milan's gate Donna Ruman.\n0:47 Comment: Deshilu is on the left in defense, Poli is on the right.\n0:50 Comment: In the center of Paletto and Armagnoli.\n0:52 Comment: Three central midfielders Bonaventura, Lucatelli,\n0:55 Comment: Kutska.\n0:57 Comment: Three attack players.\n0:58 Comment: Nyang on the left, Honda on the right.\n0:59 Comment: In the center of Baka.\n1:0 Comment: Ivan Yurievich against Vincenzo Mantella.\n1:5 Comment: This is how the coaching confrontation emerges\n1:9 Comment: Dmitry Shnyakin at the microphone Luca Banti with a whistle.\n1:12 Comment: Perine.\n1:13 Comment: Rarely did he have any opportunities at all\n1:21 Comment: At least feel the ball.\n1:23 Comment: Bonaventure strikes.\n1:25 Comment: We remember the same pass by Bonaventura in the first half.\n1:28 Comment: But again, this was all created alone.\n1:33 Comment: We didn't see any combination games.\n1:35 Comment: Bonaventura beat one, beat the other and hit the target,\n1:39 Comment: but weakly.\n1:40 Comment: Here he missed the goal.\n1:42 Comment: Kucka wins the ball for Niang.\n1:44 Comment: Nyanga regularly tries to piss him off.\n1:48 Comment: Sometimes he tugs on his shirt, then we remember him by his face\n1:50 Comment: I hit you with my palm.\n1:52 Comment: That was the only yellow card in the first half.\n1:57 Comment: Palettam.\n1:58 Comment: Slowly, slowly Palette.\n2:1 Comment: But just now I picked up the speed and immediately the distance\n2:5 Comment: he won, but he was never good with assists\n2:10 Comment: special friendship.\n2:11 Comment: Gabriel Paletta is unrecognizable from the back.\n2:19 Comment: Thank God, of course, that he cut his hair.\n2:20 Comment: Here's Jenna.\n2:21 Comment: I didn't talk about Jenna's tournament journey this season.\n2:27 Comment: There aren't many matches.\n2:28 Comment: In principle, we can list everything.\n2:30 Comment: At the start of the season, Jurich's team produced two very\n2:33 Comment: good quality match against Kaleri 3-1 against\n2:36 Comment: Crotone 3-1.\n2:37 Comment: For Juric, the away match with Crotone was, of course, special,\n2:41 Comment: but more on that later.\n2:43 Comment: Then there was a defeat from Sesoul 0-2 and two draws\n2:46 Comment: result.\n2:48 Comment: Inspiring with Napoli 0-0 and somewhat discouraging\n2:53 Comment: It's 1-1 with Piscara at home.\n2:57 Comment: Perine plays great.\n2:59 Comment: Then there was a victory over Bologna, which is going well into the current one\n3:2 Comment: Season 1-0.\n3:3 Comment: Draw with Empoli 0-0.\n3:4 Comment: Here is a defeat in the Genoese derby.\n3:6 Comment: Somewhat discouraging and, of course, very, very\n3:9 Comment: offensive.\n3:10 Comment: After all, the goal was scored by our own defender.\n3:18 Comment: There was such a situation.\n3:19 Comment: If suddenly, if you want to watch it later,\n3:24 Comment: there was a cross and he kicked the ball straight at Armand Itsu\n3:27 Comment: Perine.\n3:28 Comment: Maybe he didn't see what was coming at him\n3:31 Comment: protector.\n3:32 Comment: That's how the own goal was born.\n3:36 Comment: And from this Perin saved the shot from the 11-meter mark.\n3:41 Comment: Not seen in the first minutes of the second half yet\n3:46 Comment: some kind of revival.\n3:48 Comment: Actually, it seems to me that it’s about 50 minutes.\n3:52 Comment: It's time to make a replacement.\n3:54 Comment: And I see Honda as the first contender.\n3:58 Comment: We need Suso.\n4:0 Comment: We need Suso, who has assists this season\n4:3 Comment: distributes.\n4:4 Comment: In the game with Yuvenets, he made his third pass.\n4:7 Comment: I even scored goals on the field.\n4:9 Comment: Well, this is also a special story for him, a special stadium.\n4:12 Comment: Honda on Romagnola.\n4:19 Comment: The heir of Nesta, as they call him in Milan.\n4:22 Comment: Similar in style, hairstyle, and number.\n4:24 Comment: Actually, in honor of Nesta, he took number 13.\n4:27 Comment: Pass to the left flank.\n4:28 Comment: Here is Bonaventure with a ladle on Lokotel.\n4:34 Comment: They pushed my back a little.\n4:36 Comment: But I think Bunty is absolutely right here.\n4:39 Comment: If he didn't give in for what we saw in the first one\n4:41 Comment: In time, there is no violation here either.\n4:44 Comment: He's a follower anyway.\n4:46 Comment: Although, of course, there was a small push.\n4:50 Comment: Lokotele.\n4:51 Comment: Well, by the way, Lokotele didn’t really argue.\n4:53 Comment: Honda Lokotele.\n4:55 Comment: Onwards to Paleta.\n4:56 Comment: Paleta has room to run.\n4:59 Comment: He doesn't use it.\n5:1 Comment: But he made an accurate pass to Nyanga.\n5:3 Comment: That’s why I was waiting for a touch pass from Bak.\n5:5 Comment: But only through the third one can I play.\n5:7 Comment: Bonaventure blow.\n5:8 Comment: It seems to me that the ball went wide of the goal.\n5:10 Comment: But Perin played for sure.\n5:13 Comment: Giacomo Bonaventura.\n5:14 Comment: According to the results of the last round, he scored 25 successful ones\n5:18 Comment: Strokes in the Italian Championship.\n5:21 Comment: This is the best indicator of this season.\n5:24 Comment: But, in general, not the first time.\n5:25 Comment: Yes, by.\n5:26 Comment: Of course, the ball went past the goal.\n5:28 Comment: Not for the first time in this regard Bonaventura\n5:31 Comment: Leads in Serie A.\n5:33 Comment: He's a good bet.\n5:34 Comment: Well, yes, Lokotele, of course, glanced at him for formality\n5:36 Comment: to the referee.\n5:37 Comment: There was a little yelling there.\n5:39 Comment:  No more.\n5:40 Comment: Well, I don’t think you get an 11-meter penalty for that.\n5:42 Comment: In a game like this.\n5:45 Comment: Elbow touch.\n5:47 Comment: It turns out Buck's pass.\n5:49 Comment: We haven't figured it out.\n5:50 Comment: Paleta Strike.\n5:51 Comment: Ricochet.\n5:52 Comment:  And that is all.\n5:55 Comment: Best chance we had in this match.\n5:58 Comment: Milan just created.\n5:59 Comment: He has the best chance.\n6:0 Comment: And didn't implement it.\n6:4 Comment: We see how the team trusts young Lokotel.\n6:7 Comment: He's already scored once.\n6:9 Comment: Roughly from the same position Sesol.\n6:10 Comment: But it was a little closer.\n6:11 Comment: Luxurious long-range strike average.\n6:14 Comment: I scored against Juventus with a long shot.\n6:18 Comment: Well, here, it seems to me, he made a pass after all, and not\n6:21 Comment: hit on touch.\n6:22 Comment: Baka's hooked.\n6:23 Comment: Then the selection.\n6:24 Comment: Well, Perine is the winner of the episode.\n6:28 Comment: His beard is absolutely Makhachkala-esque.\n6:32 Comment: I never tire of being surprised.\n6:34 Comment: Pause.\n6:35 Comment: We have a pause in this match.\n6:42 Comment: Let me remind you about Ivan Yuryevich.\n6:44 Comment: Yes, of course, there are many stories about Milan.\n6:47 Comment: That's understandable.\n6:48 Comment: But Jenu is also interested.\n6:49 Comment: Gasperini finished in 11th place last season.\n6:53 Comment: Team led.\n6:54 Comment: By the way, they're back now.\n6:57 Comment: Everything is back to normal.\n6:58 Comment: This team is currently in 11th place.\n7:1 Comment: But I knew beforehand that I needed to refresh everything somehow\n7:4 Comment: this story.\n7:5 Comment: We need a new character.\n7:7 Comment: And Yuryevich, who played well in Italy at one time.\n7:14 Comment: Croatian Defender.\n7:15 Comment: Someone older remembers.\n7:17 Comment: He also played for Jena.\n7:22 Comment: For crotons first in Italy.\n7:24 Comment: For 150 matches.\n7:25 Comment: Then for Jena.\n7:26 Comment: Four seasons.\n7:27 Comment: Well, in general, it’s not surprising that his coaching career\n7:32 Comment: At first it started in Jena.\n7:35 Comment: He worked with the young men.\n7:36 Comment: He even returned after working as an assistant at Inter\n7:40 Comment: and to Palermo.\n7:41 Comment: And since 2016 he has been Jenu's coach.\n7:44 Comment: Core team.\n7:45 Comment: Last season he brought Croton to Serie A.\n7:50 Comment: But I changed my registration.\n7:54 Comment: Surprisingly, the first replacement was Jena.\n7:59 Comment: Lazovich enters the field.\n8:5 Comment: Darko Lazovic.\n8:7 Comment: Serbian football player.\n8:8 Comment: He replaces another Serb Nikola Ninkovic.\n8:12 Comment: And Ninkovich, of course, gets his applause.\n8:24 Comment: A special day for Ninkovich.\n8:26 Comment: This is his first goal for Jena.\n8:28 Comment: Well, Lazovic, of course, has been on the team a little longer.\n8:33 Comment: Darko Lazovic.\n8:38 Comment: He played for another iconic Serbian team.\n8:45 Comment: Serven the Star.\n8:46 Comment: Belgorodskaya.\n8:47 Comment: Very long, by the way.\n8:49 Comment: Six seasons.\n8:50 Comment: Since 2015 he is a football player for Jenu.\n8:53 Comment: Also, by the way, he can’t distinguish himself in any way.\n8:56 Comment: What a player.\n8:57 Comment: Extended scope of the Serbian national team.\n9:0 Comment: Darko Lazovic is 26 years old.\n9:2 Comment: Well, in any case, he played for the Serbian national team.\n9:8 Comment: Another fall.\n9:10 Comment: Another whistle more.\n9:12 Comment: But for now there is little football, more passion.\n9:15 Comment:  Field.\n9:16 Comment: Honda.\n9:18 Comment: Looking for an option to serve.\n9:19 Comment: No, this is a short pass.\n9:20 Comment: And Locotelli just wasn't ready.\n9:21 Comment: You see, not only I was waiting for this serve, but also Locotelli.\n9:32 Comment: Lazovich has an opportunity.\n9:37 Comment: Here Rincon, who was in the game, comes into play\n9:40 Comment: offside.\n9:41 Comment: There is an opportunity to beat one on one.\n9:43 Comment: But Roman Yoli played very well here.\n9:46 Comment: Yes, so far the flanks and attacks look very weak.\n9:50 Comment: You can, of course, criticize Baku.\n9:52 Comment: Just for what?\n9:53 Comment: He's practically without the ball.\n9:54 Comment: Honda and Nyang are out of the game for now.\n9:57 Comment: I have a feeling that Nyang is a little worried.\n10:4 Comment: I'll tell you why after this corner.\n10:11 Comment: Feed.\n10:12 Comment: To the center of the penalty area.\n10:16 Comment: And there was even an option for hitting through yourself, perhaps.\n10:20 Comment: To do this, football player Jerry had to lie down.\n10:22 Comment: So, about Mbai Nyanga.\n10:26 Comment: We remember that he has been playing for Milan since 2012.\n10:29 Comment: He had a lease in Montpellier.\n10:30 Comment: He was, however, more eccentric there in France than in football.\n10:33 Comment: played.\n10:34 Comment: Although there were successful games.\n10:35 Comment: Then he returns to Serie A.\n10:37 Comment: Another rental in Genoa.\n10:39 Comment: And there he is for real.\n10:40 Comment:  OU!\n10:41 Comment: Well, maybe this is even red?\n10:44 Comment:  No?\n10:45 Comment: Let's see the bow.\n10:46 Comment:  Attention!\n10:47 Comment: Yes, this removal, in my opinion, is justified.\n10:49 Comment: In my opinion, justified.\n10:53 Comment: We remember that there was a warning for making a tackle on the ball\n11:0 Comment: in the first half.\n11:1 Comment: But with a health hazard.\n11:4 Comment: The ball wasn't hit here.\n11:6 Comment: Here on the legs.\n11:7 Comment:  Scary.\n11:8 Comment: But then again, I don't think I'm very sensitive.\n11:13 Comment: Although in the end there will be a thorn of some kind, maybe the leg of the origonia\n11:16 Comment: and hit the ground running.\n11:18 Comment: But the story here is that the very biomechanics of this\n11:23 Comment: The movement was absolutely lumberjack.\n11:27 Comment: I decided to cut it down at the root.\n11:29 Comment: Jump from a distance.\n11:31 Comment: Although I'm more than sure that it's been turned on for the summer\n11:34 Comment: Initially I tried, of course, to play ball.\n11:36 Comment: But this tackle was terrible.\n11:38 Comment: Perhaps, in terms of the consequences, he is not so sensitive.\n11:42 Comment: Although we see that Origonia is limping.\n11:44 Comment: But the movement is dangerous.\n11:46 Comment: In my opinion, a completely justified red card.\n11:50 Comment: And you shouldn’t be surprised that, supposedly, this happened in many episodes before\n11:56 Comment: The bow didn’t whistle, but here, I think, he immediately rubbed in the red one.\n12:0 Comment: That, again, is how bunties work.\n12:3 Comment: This is an example of modern work of judges.\n12:7 Comment: We saw this at the European Championships.\n12:9 Comment: There weren't many red cards, though.\n12:11 Comment: There weren't many rude tactics either.\n12:14 Comment: The tank is leaving the field.\n12:15 Comment: Gomez is coming out.\n12:19 Comment: Well, let's see.\n12:20 Comment: I wouldn’t be surprised if Nyang now moves into the center of the attack.\n12:25 Comment: Well, we've found the culprit.\n12:27 Comment: On the other hand, nothing outstanding either.\n12:29 Comment: Showed nothing.\n12:31 Comment: Where he did meet the ball, he didn’t invent anything.\n12:38 Comment: 58th minute.\n12:39 Comment: Milan is on fire 0-1.\n12:41 Comment: And Milan is in the minority.\n12:42 Comment: Feed from Miguel Veloso.\n12:46 Comment: To the center of the penalty area.\n12:48 Comment: Well done Milanese.\n12:49 Comment: This ball is being taken out.\n12:50 Comment: One more serve.\n12:51 Comment: The donor is in place.\n12:55 Comment: The young goalkeeper is looking and looking.\n12:58 Comment: Options for quickly putting the ball into play.\n13:2 Comment: But it can only be played against the closest defender.\n13:4 Comment: They started singing.\n13:6 Comment: Rosso Bloom.\n13:9 Comment: The Genoa fans are happy, of course.\n13:13 Comment: By the way, last season Genua beat its opponent.\n13:17 Comment: In general, I must say, also with a countdown of 1-0,\n13:20 Comment: I must say that according to the statistics of the matches in Genoa\n13:24 Comment: Genoa is not far behind Milan.\n13:26 Comment: 16 wins for Milan, 13 for Genoa.\n13:30 Comment: And, by the way, there were a lot of draws\n13:33 Comment: in the history of the confrontation right here, in this stadium.\n13:37 Comment: Honda.\n13:38 Comment: Strike position.\n13:40 Comment: But he paused for a very long time.\n13:42 Comment: In the end it's a loss.\n13:44 Comment: I repeat, Honda, in my opinion, is the next candidate for replacement.\n13:49 Comment:  I think,\n13:52 Comment: This requires surgical intervention.\n13:56 Comment: I don't see any reason for Honda to suddenly find the game.\n14:4 Comment: We need to shake up the team.\n14:11 Comment:  Well.\n14:13 Comment: It’s clear that I was pecking at the tank here too.\n14:17 Comment: Obviously, this is a classic substitution when one of the central defenders is sent off.\n14:21 Comment: Usually it is one of the center forwards or the center forward who leaves the field.\n14:30 Comment: It is clear that in other circumstances it is unlikely that the tank would have been replaced.\n14:35 Comment: But now we need to send Gomez.\n14:38 Comment: Patching a hole in the center of defense.\n14:40 Comment: Nyang, yes, we see, is moving to the position of center forward.\n14:44 Comment: Locotelli central obek.\n14:47 Comment: On the edges.\n14:49 Comment: Oh, what a presentation.\n14:53 Comment: Also a chance.\n14:57 Comment: Yes, who would have thought.\n15:0 Comment: It is clear that problems loomed in any case here in Gena and near Milan.\n15:7 Comment: But to be like that?\n15:10 Comment: Service from Rigoni.\n15:12 Comment: Exactly.\n15:14 Comment: And here Captain De Sciglio plays ahead.\n15:16 Comment: By the way, many people wonder why De Sciglio.\n15:19 Comment: But in terms of the number of matches he is now the leader.\n15:23 Comment: The Milanese cope here with both the second and third rebounds.\n15:28 Comment: Oh, attention.\n15:30 Comment: We need to watch the replay.\n15:32 Comment: It feels like Bunty missed the episode.\n15:46 Comment: Obviously higher.\n15:50 Comment: Hips, knees, waistbands.\n15:53 Comment: That leg was up.\n15:56 Comment: Nyanga.\n15:58 Comment: He plays the ball, but immediately acts as Burdiso's hairdresser.\n16:10 Comment: In general, I must say that this is a dangerous game.\n16:12 Comment: Even taking into account the fact that he was momentarily ahead of his opponent's nyang.\n16:18 Comment: Guys, this is a dangerous game.\n16:20 Comment: Well, nothing surprising.\n16:22 Comment: Honda is leaving the field after all.\n16:24 Comment: You and I have figured it out here in quotation marks.\n16:26 Comment: Luis Adriano appears.\n16:28 Comment: I wonder what the attack will be like now.\n16:30 Comment: Nyang back to the edge.\n16:33 Comment: Or they’ll have a kind of double center of attack.\n16:37 Comment: Here comes Adrian straight into the fight.\n16:40 Comment: Yes, on the other hand, Banty probably did not decide to completely strangle Milan here.\n16:45 Comment: By the way, this wouldn't be a penalty.\n16:47 Comment: It's a dangerous game and a free from outside the box.\n16:52 Comment: But Banty did not decide to plant the whistle.\n16:57 Comment:  Field.\n17:0 Comment: The field advanced further into the attack.\n17:3 Comment: Nyang.\n17:5 Comment: Locotelli.\n17:6 Comment: By Nyangu.\n17:8 Comment: Yes, I will finish this story.\n17:10 Comment: He's into Jena.\n17:12 Comment: I still couldn’t do it last season.\n17:14 Comment: Give me the statistics.\n17:16 Comment: Played 14 matches, 5 goals.\n17:18 Comment: And it was with Jenu, and Niang associated this flourishing in his game.\n17:22 Comment: He was allowed to become one of the leaders there.\n17:25 Comment: He gave a lot and scored.\n17:27 Comment: And so he returned to Milan with this attitude.\n17:30 Comment: And we see that now Niang is, in any case, as he claims, one of the leaders.\n17:36 Comment: It really makes a difference.\n17:39 Comment: But he's no good in this game yet.\n17:43 Comment: However, again, the command is a mechanism of communicating vessels.\n17:53 Comment: And I won't say that anyone else in Milan looks great right now.\n17:58 Comment: The whole team was fading, and she needs, again, to force herself.\n18:2 Comment: She needs to show the class she claims to be.\n18:6 Comment: That's what Monte was talking about.\n18:9 Comment: With Juventus - yes, it's a thing in itself.\n18:11 Comment: This is a game that goes beyond even the championship.\n18:15 Comment: But in fact? In fact.\n18:20 Comment: We won against Juventus, lost, for example, to Jen.\n18:24 Comment: And the same three points remain.\n18:26 Comment: Although someone probably thought before these two matches,\n18:29 Comment: It will most likely be the other way around - Yuvi will lose and win against Jen.\n18:35 Comment: That's what glasses are like.\n18:38 Comment: No one will give you extra points for defeating the champion.\n18:43 Comment: Once again, Jenu's defense copes relatively easily.\n18:52 Comment: Still, it seems to me that Abbot is missing on the right sideline today.\n18:55 Comment: He covered very well in the match against Yuvi Alex Sassander.\n19:0 Comment: At first, of course, it didn’t work out.\n19:2 Comment: Sassander was very often on the attack, and was involved in several acute episodes at once.\n19:9 Comment: But then in the second half Abbata healed it.\n19:12 Comment: Field to Nyang. Nyang. He's on the right now.\n19:17 Comment: Or, let's say, more to the right.\n19:18 Comment: It still seems to me that he and Luis Adrian will work together.\n19:25 Comment: In the forward room.\n19:27 Comment: Just one a little to the left, the other a little to the right.\n19:29 Comment:  Probably so.\n19:31 Comment: Nyang serves.\n19:33 Comment: Well, what else did I talk about during the broadcast of the game with Juventus.\n19:36 Comment: Such a tall football player would be more useful in the penalty area.\n19:41 Comment: Well, oh well. You see, there’s no one there to jump out.\n19:43 Comment: This ball will win.\n19:45 Comment: Another good pitch.\n19:47 Comment: Milan fights, Adrian fights.\n19:49 Comment: Adrian came out in a good mood.\n19:51 Comment: Nyang. Extra movement.\n19:53 Comment: Extra.\n19:55 Comment: But here he finds a partner.\n19:57 Comment: But here he raised his elbow.\n19:59 Comment: Real.\n20:1 Comment: It's hard to get out.\n20:3 Comment: You even have to go through the goalkeeper.\n20:5 Comment: Don Aruma connects.\n20:7 Comment: I think he needs to understand that he needs to play higher now.\n20:10 Comment: Now we need to play Neuer a little.\n20:13 Comment: Because, well, he can't play Neuer anymore.\n20:17 Comment: Genoa will counterattack.\n20:21 Comment: And if something happens, you need to insure.\n20:23 Comment: By the way, Genua is preparing another replacement.\n20:25 Comment: I'll list the rest of the spares.\n20:27 Comment: Lazovich has already left.\n20:29 Comment: There are goalkeepers Lohmann and Zim.\n20:32 Comment: Or Winter. Lukashin Winter.\n20:34 Comment: Czech.\n20:36 Comment: Another amazing name.\n20:38 Comment: Gentiletti, Berratsky, Orban and Fiemozzi.\n20:41 Comment: These are the defenders.\n20:43 Comment: Coffee, Nshan, Ocampos.\n20:45 Comment: This is Khabib.\n20:47 Comment: This is Lakey Pavoletti.\n20:49 Comment: Pandev.\n20:51 Comment: Attack players.\n20:53 Comment: Leonardo Pavoletti.\n20:55 Comment: Leader of Genoa's attacks last season.\n20:57 Comment: Was not sold in Naples.\n20:59 Comment: Although there was talk about it.\n21:1 Comment: And this, of course, is a great help.\n21:3 Comment: But I got injured.\n21:5 Comment: Mache Sambori reached the end.\n21:7 Comment: Here he is, yes.\n21:9 Comment: It’s not in vain that I talked about him.\n21:11 Comment: I had a premonition that it was his figure that was flashing.\n21:13 Comment: Well, that's the whole texture.\n21:15 Comment: We'll find out.\n21:17 Comment: Here, those leaving the field are greeted with applause.\n21:21 Comment: How many people meet Pavoletti.\n21:23 Comment: Semyon worked very hard today.\n21:25 Comment: Moved great.\n21:27 Comment: And he defended himself, despite the fact that he was the attacker.\n21:29 Comment: But Pavoletti scored big time.\n21:32 Comment: I scored a lot last season.\n21:34 Comment: And, by the way, he could have saved the team in those 15 minutes that he had in the Gennady derby.\n21:41 Comment: But he hit it point-blank.\n21:43 Comment: And the goalkeeper pulled the ball.\n21:45 Comment: Now a little more.\n21:47 Comment: Time is not given to him at his mercy.\n21:50 Comment: And, in principle, many assumed that Pavoletti would appear on the field today from the first minutes.\n21:54 Comment: Replaced.\n21:56 Comment: Niang is being shut down again.\n21:58 Comment: He really doesn't argue.\n22:0 Comment: He also leaned on the defender.\n22:2 Comment: The fight continues.\n22:4 Comment: Bonaventure!\n22:6 Comment: How impressively he played and used his heel.\n22:8 Comment: Then I carefully pierced the field onto my partner.\n22:10 Comment: Near Niang.\n22:11 Comment: Niang starts these attacks from the middle.\n22:14 Comment: It’s not at all surprising to him that in the end everything came to a loss.\n22:20 Comment: Rincon!\n22:22 Comment: There's an option on the left.\n22:24 Comment:  Attention!\n22:26 Comment: Rigoni!\n22:28 Comment: An extra pause.\n22:30 Comment: Rincon hits, of course.\n22:32 Comment: It seems to me that Rigoni himself could have played sharper and more persistent.\n22:38 Comment: Well, I don't think it was like that.\n22:39 Comment: Well, Donnaruma is no good here.\n22:47 Comment: By the way, also about Donnaruma.\n22:52 Comment: I haven't talked about that first half yet.\n22:55 Comment: But the Milan fans website doesn't let you forget about it.\n23:1 Comment: Shot.\n23:3 Comment: But the defenders can handle it here.\n23:5 Comment: After all, it’s actually exactly one year since GI Joe’s debut in Milan.\n23:13 Comment: Remember, on October 25, 2015, Mikhail Ilyich completely unexpectedly released a 16-year-old guy in the starting lineup in the game against Sesuolo.\n23:22 Comment: Before this, Diago Lopez played unconvincingly.\n23:26 Comment: But in the end the Sesuolo match is won by Milan 2-1.\n23:28 Comment: Then, however, Donnaruma missed such a goal, which he could have taken, it seems to me.\n23:33 Comment: From a free kick.\n23:35 Comment: But memory serves.\n23:37 Comment: Well, you see, he’s already got 40 matches behind him.\n23:41 Comment: A very young kid played 40 matches in a year.\n23:47 Comment: Episode 39, 1 in the cup.\n23:49 Comment: And in the end, I defended 15 of these 40 matches to zero.\n23:53 Comment: And this is one of the best results in Italy among goalkeepers over the past year.\n24:0 Comment: Well, you see, yes, it seems like a significant day for Donnaruma.\n24:3 Comment: But he still can’t prove himself in the game.\n24:9 Comment: And, one might say, for the better for the fighters of Milan.\n24:13 Comment: But here it’s more about the fact that he didn’t save the team in the episode with the goal.\n24:18 Comment: Well, as we see, his partners from the outflow line are still banging their heads against the wall.\n24:24 Comment: No, there is some kind of revival.\n24:26 Comment: And it seems to me that Louis Adrian Unian came out well.\n24:29 Comment: I started playing a little differently.\n24:30 Comment: Well, this same Unyan, as we see, it seems to me, is a disastrous match.\n24:38 Comment: Well, that's what happened.\n24:40 Comment: The audience here greets him with whistles.\n24:44 Comment: And we understand that this is, of course, a very unpleasant story for Unyang.\n24:48 Comment: He probably wouldn't mind hearing some nice words here.\n24:52 Comment: Still, he brought benefit to the team.\n24:55 Comment: Well, that’s it, these are the matches that you also need to experience in your career.\n24:58 Comment: Unyang already has a lot to claim here.\n25:1 Comment: Sky Sport announced that they will sign a contract with him.\n25:6 Comment: Now he earns 800 thousand euros.\n25:9

Adriana.\n33:11 Comment: Adrian is still fighting for these bits.\n33:13 Comment: Some kind of precise pass to the legs.\n33:14 Comment: Well, there was one, after which Adrien himself became ill.\n33:21 Comment: But let’s not forget that Milan, of course, has a hard time being in a niche.\n33:25 Comment: Suusa.\n33:27 Comment: Good girl, how he turned Suus around.\n33:29 Comment: Approaching the penalty area.\n33:31 Comment: He was already covered in time by Kotelli's pass.\n33:33 Comment: Well, there were two options on the right.\n33:35 Comment: He wanted to go to Bonaventure.\n33:37 Comment: Raise your head, young man.\n33:39 Comment: You see, we also praised Milan.\n33:42 Comment: Here are the problems he stumbled into.\n33:44 Comment: And we understand that this is a young team,\n33:46 Comment: Where the main veteran is Paletto.\n33:50 Comment: And here you are, the most experienced one is letting you down like this.\n33:53 Comment: For now, of course, Milan is unstable.\n33:56 Comment: Transfer to the right edge.\n33:58 Comment: Here it is possible to connect a defender running along the flank.\n34:2 Comment: And so, of course, Milan is, of course, unstable.\n34:4 Comment: But of course he's unstable.\n34:5 Comment: Here it is possible to connect a defender running along the flank.\n34:9 Comment: Kick and goal!\n34:11 Comment: Pavoletti!\n34:14 Comment: Or it's an own goal.\n34:16 Comment: We need to figure this out.\n34:18 Comment: In any case, Leonardo's exit justifies itself.\n34:23 Comment: This flank attack is good.\n34:25 Comment: There were several options.\n34:27 Comment: You could have given it to the right to the freshly connected Fiamonza.\n34:31 Comment: But in the end, let's see who it was.\n34:33 Comment: Rincon, what a magnificent translation he does.\n34:36 Comment: In the end it's Darko Lazovic.\n34:43 Comment: Yes, Pavoletti is becoming.\n34:47 Comment: Or maybe not.\n34:49 Comment: It's an own goal.\n34:51 Comment: Yes, Pavoletti's own goal has nothing to do with it.\n34:53 Comment: Juraj Kutska, from old memory, as they say, scored for Genua.\n35:0 Comment: Well, let's note, of course, that all three players,\n35:6 Comment: all three players who came on as substitutes,\n35:10 Comment: were somehow involved in this goal.\n35:13 Comment: But look, Darko Lazovic takes the ball and advances.\n35:17 Comment: And Fiamonze, who was on his right,\n35:24 Comment: He takes away the defender who could have met Lazovic.\n35:27 Comment: He again distracts attention.\n35:31 Comment: As a result, Lazovic makes an unhindered pass to Pavoletti,\n35:35 Comment: which also with its movement, the way it opened,\n35:39 Comment: Confused the defenders.\n35:41 Comment: As a result, Kutska tries to interrupt the transmission.\n35:44 Comment: The pass had the potential to become a goal.\n35:46 Comment: But in the end she did.\n35:48 Comment: The Milan player just showed up.\n35:51 Comment: In the past, let me remind you once again, the player of Genoa, Juraj Kutska,\n35:55 Comment: I played for Genua for a very long time for 4 seasons.\n36:7 Comment: By the way, I’m curious what Loshaty shouted at the stadium.\n36:12 Comment: Is the last name Kutski?\n36:14 Comment: That would be trolling in the absolute highest degree.\n36:20 Comment: But I think they got confused after all,\n36:23 Comment: deciding that Pavoletti had scored.\n36:33 Comment: Genoa goes for the third ball.\n36:35 Comment: Touch kick from Vilosu.\n36:37 Comment: It seems to me that the eyes of the Milanese have gone dark.\n36:41 Comment: Even with 1-0, they didn’t do much.\n36:44 Comment: They understand that they are also a little limited in their opportunities\n36:50 Comment: due to the absence of 11 players.\n36:53 Comment: That's why Milan is finishing this match.\n36:57 Comment: Great lesson.\n36:59 Comment: A great lesson for the youth of Milan.\n37:2 Comment: Let me remind you again, Donoruma 17, Lokotele 18, Niang 21.\n37:11 Comment: For example, Gustavo Gomez appeared,\n37:15 Comment: Proguayan defender, he is also 23.\n37:20 Comment: Young, Romagnoli 21.\n37:25 Comment: The team is young.\n37:29 Comment: A team in which the captain is just starting\n37:35 Comment: By the way, we also wish him a happy birthday,\n37:37 Comment: turned 24, we're talking about Matej Dešil.\n37:41 Comment: Well, in general, she, of course, has not been fired upon yet.\n37:46 Comment: Although there are experienced guys, like Bonaventura, for example.\n37:50 Comment: Well, in fact, storing it in advance is also wrong.\n37:56 Comment: Bonaventure is being taken away from Sus here, he himself takes responsibility,\n38:1 Comment: as one of the team leaders.\n38:3 Comment: Bonaventura has excellent free kicks, we need to take advantage of it,\n38:7 Comment: You can go back to the game.\n38:9 Comment: Giacomo Bonaventura, attention, this is a joke, a blow.\n38:12 Comment: Actually, it worked because we saw it,\n38:16 Comment: how Perin jerked towards the post to his left.\n38:19 Comment: And, in principle, thanks to this draw,\n38:22 Comment: The goalkeeper was probably a little embarrassed somehow.\n38:24 Comment: Look at him.\n38:26 Comment: You see, I took a step, but I have to hit it.\n38:35 Comment: Well, for now here it is.\n38:37 Comment: Genoa confirms Milan's awkward rival status,\n38:42 Comment: especially in Genoese matches.\n38:51 Comment: Problems with the right edge, and it's not just about Honda.\n38:55 Comment: Here, by the way, is a yellow velosa.\n38:58 Comment: Well, according to custom, yes, we will not argue with Bunty in this match.\n39:1 Comment: Although I still think that he should have been free to appoint\n39:4 Comment: towards the gates of Milan.\n39:8 Comment: In the field he is moving to the right-back position\n39:12 Comment: I didn't justify myself today, although he said before the match that\n39:16 Comment: that I’m ready to play for a new position.\n39:20 Comment: I can handle this task, and so on, and so on.\n39:24 Comment: But, basically, it was like this, well,\n39:26 Comment: I can handle this task, and so on, and so on.\n39:30 Comment: In the end, we remember that it was he who missed Ninkovich.\n39:37 Comment: Another standard with a mustache.\n39:40 Comment: Well, the entire top, absolutely the entire top, is taken off by the Genua football players.\n39:44 Comment: Moreover, this rebound became the forerunner of a dangerous counterattack.\n39:50 Comment: And the numerical majority is for Genoa.\n39:52 Comment: Well, that's an extra pass, especially not at the pace.\n39:54 Comment: Well, here you can have fun, again, with positional ball control.\n40:1 Comment: It’s not in vain, it’s probably not in vain that Mantello was so modest.\n40:5 Comment: in various interviews before the match, like some football players,\n40:9 Comment: speaking of the fact that they're not really going to get together right now\n40:14 Comment: Skim off the cream, they should return to the Eurocup for the first time in a long time.\n40:19 Comment: It’s as if they never dreamed of a championship.\n40:21 Comment: Well, yes, yes, let's continue the championship race.\n40:24 Comment: No, no, pass into the penalty area.\n40:27 Comment: Juventus, by the way, which is so far...\n40:30 Comment: Oh, what is Pavaletti doing to Gomez here.\n40:34 Comment: In the football world it's called a section.\n40:38 Comment: The defender was stripped naked and exposed to the public.\n40:44 Comment: In general, it's a real shame.\n40:45 Comment: Like a baby.\n40:48 Comment: Pavaletti.\n40:50 Comment: Leonardo Pavaletti scores a devastating score for Milan.\n40:55 Comment: Let's see.\n40:57 Comment: Axalt makes a pass.\n40:59 Comment: We see how one of the partners, this is Regonia, is indignant,\n41:3 Comment: They say he should have made a pass.\n41:6 Comment: And Leonardo Pavaletti is simple, but very timely\n41:11 Comment: and fast, as it were, in principle, in this case.\n41:14 Comment: So timely and quickly executed feint.\n41:18 Comment: Oh, it actually sends Gomez to his butt.\n41:22 Comment:  Like this.\n41:24 Comment: Here's Serie A for you, Mr. Paraguayan.\n41:30 Comment:  Great.\n41:32 Comment: Great. And let's celebrate Laxalt.\n41:34 Comment: I also saw a vacant corridor.\n41:38 Comment: I passed it there very conveniently to Pavaletti.\n41:41 Comment: Well, Gomez’s one-on-one play, of course, does not stand up to criticism.\n41:53 Comment: 3-0.\n41:56 Comment: What is there to talk about here?\n41:58 Comment: A dark day for Milan and for its fans.\n42:5 Comment: And, of course, this is a sensation.\n42:8 Comment: It's not so much sensational as it is moronic.\n42:11 Comment: Basically the same, yes, today we're talking about the Milan game\n42:15 Comment: absolutely inferior to his opponent in terms of business.\n42:18 Comment: It's also a sensation in form.\n42:20 Comment: Well, to make it 3-0.\n42:22 Comment: Here, in fact, it would not be possible to bring matters to the point of absurdity and pornography.\n42:30 Comment: The transfer, well, that’s how they’re already planning it,\n42:33 Comment: This is how Jenom’s football players draw these combinations.\n42:36 Comment:  Yes.\n42:41 Comment: Genoa football players are already playing on the field.\n42:46 Comment: Actually, that’s why I paused, so that maybe,\n42:51 Comment: It’s not that they are spiteful critics, but there are probably Genoa fans,\n42:56 Comment: We enjoyed this sound.\n42:58 Comment: Today some have triumphed, but, of course, that's not all.\n43:2 Comment: And, of course, that's not all.\n43:5 Comment: Today Jurich is in perfect order along with his team.\n43:11 Comment: Well, Milan has a lot of mistakes,\n43:16 Comment: with an unimpressive attitude towards the game initially.\n43:21 Comment: We see that we are close to getting the fourth ball into the flank.\n43:27 Comment: This is what it looks like.\n43:29 Comment: Soft serve, helps the field.\n43:32 Comment: But the selection is up to Loxalt.\n43:34 Comment: It feels like the attackers there are not going to work on the defense in any way.\n43:39 Comment: But offsite, offsite.\n43:41 Comment: It would be something like 4-0 here by now.\n43:43 Comment: Lucaregoni.\n43:45 Comment: He, too, actually played for some effective action.\n43:50 Comment: He wasn't there today.\n43:52 Comment: It wasn't in my career.\n43:54 Comment: It was in my career.\n43:55 Comment: Opened up, passed.\n43:57 Comment: I did everything right.\n43:59 Comment: Lucaregoni, a highly experienced midfielder,\n44:3 Comment: never played for big teams,\n44:7 Comment: But, again, he found himself in Jenu.\n44:10 Comment: Soft serve.\n44:13 Comment:  Emptiness.\n44:15 Comment: And of course it wasn't like that.\n44:17 Comment: But, in principle, it was not so.\n44:19 Comment: And of course it wasn't like that.\n44:20 Comment: Soft serve.\n44:23 Comment:  Emptiness.\n44:25 Comment: Today near Matej Perin.\n44:28 Comment: Somehow we didn’t even see him in his magnificent jumps.\n44:34 Comment: And look at the courage that catches football player Jen.\n44:37 Comment: In fact, it would be nice to slow things down a little here\n44:41 Comment: and mock your opponent,\n44:47 Comment: playing on this same Ole.\n44:50 Comment: But they want to score a fourth.\n    \n\n    #######TASK \n    Provide a factually correct and detailed textual description of the game compiled from the information presented above from different sources, in more than 1000 words.\n            \"E:\" represents events recorded exactly after the event happened.\n            \"Comment.\": represents the real-time noisy commentary from the commentator as the game progresses.\n    Don't mention sources of information like commentators or captions, write as if you saw them live.\n    \n    ",
    "summary": "In the vibrant setting of Genoa, a much-anticipated match unfolded as Genoa hosted Milan in the opening game of the 10th round of the Italian Championship. The match, held on Tuesday, October 25th, promised high stakes and intense football action.\n\nGenoa's coach Ivan Juric set the stage with a carefully selected lineup. In goal stood the reliable Matteo Perin sporting the number 1 jersey, while the defense was marshaled by Zekel Munoz (#24), Nicolas Burdisso (#8), Armando Izzo (#5), and Andrade Edenilson (#2) on the right. Diogo Laxalt (#93) took charge of the left flank. The midfield boasted the talents of Tomas Rincon (#88) and Miguel Veloso (#44), with Luca Rigoni (#30), Nikola Ninkovic (#99), and Giovanni Simeone (#9) spearheading the attack.\n\nOn the other side, under the stewardship of Vincenzo Montella, Milan lined up with Gianluigi Donnarumma in goal, donning the number 99 jersey. The defensive line included Matteo De Sciglio (#2), Gabriel Paletta (#29), Alessio Romagnoli (#13), and Andrea Poli (#16). The midfield trio consisted of Manuel Locatelli (#73), Juraj Kucka (#33), and Giacomo Bonaventura (#5). The attacking front saw Keisuke Honda (#10), Carlos Bacca (#70), and M'Baye Niang (#11) aiming to breach Genoa’s defenses.\n\nThe match began with Genoa taking early control of possession, maneuvering their passes and testing Milan's defense. Their intent was clear from the onset – to press high and carve out early opportunities.\n\nIn the 10th minute, a counterattack by Milan ensued, where Carlos Bacca cleverly attracted several Genoese defenders before laying the ball off to Niang. However, Milan’s early efforts were foiled by Genoa's disciplined defense.\n\nAs the half progressed, Milan struggled to assert their dominance. The passing interplay, especially in the attacking areas, remained disjointed. In the 11th minute, Andrea Poli, acting as a makeshift full-back in place of Abate, was continually tested by Genoa’s wide players, but showed composure.\n\nThe breakthrough for Genoa came in the 10th minute, courtesy of a strategically executed move. Rincon, showcasing his ball control and vision, found space on the right flank and delivered an inviting cross. Nikola Ninkovic, positioned intelligently, executed a spectacular header to put Genoa in the lead. This goal stirred the Genoa crowd, emphasizing the significance of their lead over Milan.\n\nFollowing the goal, Genoa's grip on the game tightened. Their midfield, led by Rincon and Veloso, orchestrated play with ease. Milan, on the other hand, appeared jaded, perhaps still basking in the afterglow of their recent triumph over Juventus. Locatelli, despite his heroics against Juventus, was unable to replicate his form and control in midfield.\n\nAs the first half wore on, it became evident that Milan needed a spark to reignite their attacking prowess. Bonaventura attempted to inject life into Milan’s game, showcasing his dribbling skills and vision. However, his solo efforts were insufficient to dismantle the staunch Genoa defense.\n\nHalf-time approached with Genoa comfortably controlling the pace of the game. Despite a few forays forward by Milan, notably through Niang and Bacca, Perin was largely untroubled in goal. The first half ended with Genoa leading 1-0, leaving Milan with much to ponder during the break.\n\nThe second half began with Milan striving to claw their way back into the game. Early on, Bonaventura’s persistence created a shooting opportunity, but his effort lacked the venom to beat Perin. Milan’s frustrations grew as their attacks repeatedly met Genoa’s resolute defense.\n\nThe 50th minute marked a pivotal moment in the match as Gabriel Paletta, already skating on thin ice due to his earlier cautions, lunged recklessly at Rigoni. The referee, without hesitation, brandished a red card, reducing Milan to ten men. This dismissal further compounded Milan’s woes, stretching their already beleaguered defense.\n\nSeizing the advantage, Juric introduced fresh legs, bringing on Darko Lazovic for the goalscorer Ninkovic. This substitution aimed to maintain Genoa's attacking verve while also ensuring control in midfield. Milan, in response, introduced Luis Adriano and Suso, hoping to add creativity and energy to their attack.\n\nMilan’s numerical disadvantage quickly translated into further defensive fragility. In the 80th minute, Lazovic, benefiting from Genoa’s fluid attacking play, delivered a cross into the Milan penalty area. Juraj Kucka, in a desperate attempt to clear, inadvertently redirected the ball into his own net, doubling Genoa’s lead.\n\nWith Genoa’s confidence soaring and Milan’s spirit visibly broken, the home side continued to pile on the pressure. As the match entered its final stages, Leonardo Pavoletti, who had come on as a substitute for Simeone, capitalized on a lapse in Milan's defense. In the 86th minute, he received a precise pass from Laxalt, expertly turned his marker, and slotted the ball past Donnarumma, sealing a comprehensive 3-0 victory for Genoa.\n\nThe final whistle blew, confirming a dominant performance by Genoa and a day of reckoning for Milan. This victory not only highlighted Genoa's tactical discipline and execution but also exposed Milan's frailties, particularly in dealing with their recent success and maintaining consistency.\n\nIn the aftermath, Milan's camp, led by Montella, would have much to dissect and rebuild. The resilience and organization shown by Genoa, coupled with strategic in-game adjustments by Juric, were commendable. This match served as a stark reminder that in football, a single day can unravel or uplift a team's fortunes.\n\nIn conclusion, Genoa’s 3-0 win over Milan was a testament to their preparation, tactical ingenuity, and capitalizing on Milan’s shortcomings. As the Italian Championship progresses, this match serves as a crucial chapter in understanding the dynamics of both teams and their ambitions for the rest of the season."
