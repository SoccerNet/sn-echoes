Fulignati has already found his place in goal.\n2:34 Comment: Chochev and Gazzia\n2:35 Comment: clumsy midfielders.\n2:38 Comment: At the same time, Chochev will attack more often.\n2:42 Comment: Well, four attack players.\n2:44 Comment: Enrique.\n2:46 Comment: Well, a kind of track vartista.\n2:48 Comment: Embau.\n2:48 Comment: Closer to the left edge works.\n2:50 Comment: Shala is also on the right.\n2:51 Comment: Well, Nestorovsky is a central striker.\n2:55 Comment: I didn't tell you about the referee.\n2:57 Comment: This is Gianluca Rocchi.\n2:59 Comment: Gianluca Rocchi is one of the best referees in Italy.\n3:2 Comment: The most status ones in recent years.\n3:5 Comment: Fabiano Pretty helps him.\n3:7 Comment: Salvatore Longo.\n3:9 Comment: Reserve referee Alberto Tegoni.\n3:11 Comment: Dmitry Shnyakin from Moscow.\n3:14 Comment: This match is commentated for you.\n3:16 Comment: El Sharawi rushes forward.\n3:18 Comment: There is a proposal on the left.\n3:19 Comment: Greenier.\n3:19 Comment: Lumbago.\n3:21 Comment: In principle convenient, but could not cope with processing\n3:23 Comment: Neingalan.\n3:27 Comment: What is his number in the penalty area?\n3:29 Comment: I failed.\n3:31 Comment: Well, the throw to Salah was too strong.\n3:37 Comment: Interesting trick.\n3:38 Comment: And he managed to jostle and juggle.\n3:41 Comment: All this time he did not let go.\n3:42 Comment: Hit it three times, right?\n3:47 Comment: It burns like you see it, right?\n3:51 Comment: Also in someone else’s penalty area.\n3:55 Comment: Embolon.\n3:57 Comment: No, still he...\n3:59 Comment: To the right it acts along the front of the attack.\n4:1 Comment: But I wouldn’t be surprised if they switch positions with Hungarian Shala.\n4:8 Comment: Casting\n4:9 Comment: And Nestorovsky.\n4:11 Comment: Nestorovsky scores a goal.\n4:13 Comment: Fantastic!\n4:15 Comment: How!\n4:16 Comment: How he managed to push the ball over the goal line, which was already almost rolling out of the field with him.\n4:25 Comment: Top scorer Polerman.\n4:27 Comment: Completely unthinkable.\n4:29 Comment: In an unthinkable sketch, the tightrope walker still loses the ball.\n4:37 Comment: What a pity!\n4:39 Comment: This would, of course, be one of the most striking episodes of the entire European weekend.\n4:45 Comment: How did he get out of this?\n4:47 Comment: Ah, that's what it was.\n4:49 Comment: It was offside.\n4:53 Comment: He didn't miss the ball.\n4:57 Comment: Everything, everything was offside.\n4:58 Comment: AND...\n4:59 Comment: It is noteworthy that it does not matter whether a nearby partner touched the ball.\n5:4 Comment: Because both during the first pass and during the second pass, if there was one in both of these cases, Nestorovsky was closer to the goal than the defender Rom.\n5:19 Comment: But in any case, this mood certainly added to the Sicilians.\n5:25 Comment: AND...\n5:25 Comment: Surprising, of course.\n5:29 Comment: It was a very scary episode.\n5:30 Comment: It is clear that there was a mistake made by Shchentsnov.\n5:35 Comment: Near corner, low, along the line, like a shot.\n5:40 Comment: Moreover, I am sure that if he had not touched the ball, there would have been no goal.\n5:44 Comment: It so happened that first his glove hit the goalkeeper, then, you see, there was already a pass here.\n5:50 Comment: And it doesn’t matter here, although it seems like there was a touch, right?\n5:53 Comment: It doesn’t matter, both here and there.\n5:55 Comment: Nestorovsky.\n5:59 Comment: I was behind the defender's position and was not on the same line with him.\n6:4 Comment: So yes, absolutely the right decision by Rocky's assistant.\n6:10 Comment: Ganel threw it far.\n6:12 Comment: Nestorovsky to the center.\n6:15 Comment: Sloppy pass, there is a chance for a counterattack.\n6:18 Comment: Salah.\n6:19 Comment: No one offers themselves Pokrovka.\n6:20 Comment: You'll have to do everything alone.\n6:22 Comment: Well, by the way, Salah is no stranger to this.\n6:24 Comment: Runo Perez.\n6:29 Comment: And Grinier makes a pass into the center of the penalty area.\n6:33 Comment: And there Mario Rui came running and put pressure.\n6:35 Comment: Yes, in one of the episodes, I apologize, I confused Grinier with Ruy.\n6:38 Comment: Rui is also a rare guest in Roma's starting line-up.\n6:43 Comment: But a defender of strong qualities.\n6:47 Comment: Runo Perez.\n6:48 Comment: The other full-back moves to the center and makes a pass.\n6:50 Comment: Well, of course, his left leg is not as effective as his right.\n6:56 Comment: According to the composition of Roma.\n6:58 Comment: Three central defenders.\n6:59 Comment: Rüdiger, Facio and Jesus.\n7:2 Comment: Roma has been playing like this lately.\n7:6 Comment: Although, of course, not Jesus, but Manulas.\n7:9 Comment: We are used to seeing this as a triumvirate.\n7:11 Comment: But Manulas is disqualified today.\n7:14 Comment: Well, Jesus, again, is a proven player.\n7:17 Comment: Purchased from Inter for serious money.\n7:20 Comment: Perez is acting on the right throughout the traffic jam.\n7:22 Comment: On the left is Rui.\n7:23 Comment: In the center of midfield are Paredes and Grinier.\n7:28 Comment: There are two more central midfielders who are closer.\n7:32 Comment: Another central player who will regularly join the attack.\n7:36 Comment: This is Neingala.\n7:37 Comment: Well, El Sharawi and Salah.\n7:41 Comment: Well, two strikers, probably so.\n7:44 Comment: Although we see Neingal positioned slightly to the left in attack, Salah to the right.\n7:48 Comment: And El Sharawi as a center forward.\n7:50 Comment: Well, actually, it’s been a while since I played center forward.\n7:54 Comment: Well, correct me, Roma fans.\n7:57 Comment: I think it's the last time.\n7:58 Comment: He did it, he did it when he played for Bilan.\n8:1 Comment: And we remember that he did great.\n8:4 Comment: Gace makes a transfer to the left edge.\n8:7 Comment: Resami is here.\n8:9 Comment: Here he is with the ball.\n8:11 Comment: In multi-colored boots.\n8:15 Comment: And then it comes down to defense.\n8:18 Comment: This is Chonek.\n8:20 Comment: Diagonal.\n8:21 Comment: Even if it were accurate, it would still be a struggle.\n8:24 Comment: And this decision is not fully prepared and correct.\n8:28 Comment: Norwegian.\n8:29 Comment: This is such an unusual Scandinavian.\n8:30 Comment: Ali Samim.\n8:31 Comment: Starting lineup circle.\n8:32 Comment: Norwegian of Moroccan descent.\n8:33 Comment: This is such an unusual Scandinavian.\n8:34 Comment: Neengalan.\n8:35 Comment: And he took it away.\n8:36 Comment: And Salah gave a magnificent pass.\n8:37 Comment: El Sharawi must be beaten.\n8:38 Comment: One to one.\n8:39 Comment: El Sharawi against defenders.\n8:40 Comment: That's it, Gace has already arrived.\n8:41 Comment: Neengalan.\n8:42 Comment: To the right is Bruno Perez.\n8:43 Comment: It's just...\n8:44 Comment: There wasn't even a corner kick.\n8:45 Comment: Here he is, Bruno Perez.\n8:46 Comment: Norwegian.\n8:47 Comment: This is such an unusual Scandinavian.\n8:48 Comment: Norwegian.\n8:49 Comment: El Sharawi against defenders.\n8:50 Comment: That's it, Gace has already arrived.\n8:51 Comment: Neengalan.\n8:52 Comment: To the right is Bruno Perez.\n8:53 Comment: It's just...\n8:54 Comment: Not even a corner was earned.\n8:55 Comment: Game continues.\n8:56 Comment: The pass seemed to be delayed by Bruno Perez.\n8:57 Comment: And the central defenders were already prepared for it.\n8:58 Comment: Although, at the moment of handling the ball, Perez, it seems to me, was\n8:59 Comment: closest to the goalkeeper.\n9:0 Comment: Bruno Perez is one of the most active members of Roman\n9:1 Comment: Makarova.\n9:2 Comment: And this, of course, is an unusual Scandinavian.\n9:3 Comment: But, of course, unusual.\n9:4 Comment: And, of course, unusual.\n9:5 Comment: But, of course, unusual.\n9:6 Comment: And the central defenders were already prepared for it.\n9:10 Comment: Although, at the moment of handling the ball, Perez, it seems to me, was\n9:14

used\n9:21 Comment: partners.\n9:22 Comment: Karl Shambhalo.\n9:23 Comment: The ball is lost.\n9:24 Comment: Neengalan tried this again.\n9:25 Comment: And Mario Ruy bumps into Marganella.\n9:26 Comment: With Marganella here, of course, Ruyu is not destroyed easily.\n9:27 Comment: But, of course, unusual.\n9:28 Comment: Game continues.\n9:29 Comment: Bruno Perez.\n9:30 Comment: It's just...\n9:31 Comment: Unusual.\n9:32 Comment: Game continues.\n9:33 Comment: Bruno Perez.\n9:34 Comment: Game continues.\n9:35 Comment: Bruno Perez.\n9:36 Comment: Game continues.\n9:37 Comment: By example.\n9:38 Comment: I mean, something unusual.\n9:39 Comment: With Marganella.\n9:40 Comment: With Marganella here, of course, it won’t be easy for Ruy in any way.\n9:41 Comment: case.\n9:42 Comment: Physically powerful.\n9:43 Comment: Tenacious defender.\n9:44 Comment: But Maria Ruia, as I already said, has her own qualities\n9:48 Comment: There is.\n9:49 Comment: Such as tenacity, speed.\n9:50 Comment: In general, working with the ball is the same.\n9:53 Comment: Well, it all started with a mistake by Karl Shambhalo.\n9:57 Comment: Round plan we saw it.\n10:2 Comment: attacks,

Marganello\n16:26 Comment: absolutely correct proposal\n16:28 Comment: It’s not entirely clear what Nestorovsky was doing there in the depths of the field\n16:31 Comment: here he is, the center forward\n16:33 Comment: with such excommunications somewhere on the flank or in the center\n16:37 Comment: he, of course, deprives his teammates of the opportunity to play in the penalty area\n16:41 Comment: more precisely, not possibilities, but meaning\n16:45 Comment: Enrique is not very noticeable yet\n16:49 Comment: central attacking midfielder\n16:51 Comment: Palermo\n16:53 Comment: he's good at distribution\n16:54 Comment: he has three assists this season\n16:57 Comment: here, however, not a single goal\n16:59 Comment: There is no way he can open the scoring with his goal for Palermo\n17:4 Comment: Gutsi\n17:7 Comment: plays in touch\n17:9 Comment: was under pressure\n17:13 Comment: At the first opportunity, Palermo tries to play what is called vertical\n17:18 Comment:

in the opponents' square.\n28:44 Comment: And yet.\n28:46 Comment: He looked for a situation to strike.\n28:49 Comment: But he had to take this angle.\n28:54 Comment: Because the opponent actually correctly blocked with himself.\n28:58 Comment: Here is number 15.\n28:59 Comment: This is Chonek.\n29:0 Comment: Do you see?\n29:2 Comment: I had to deflect both Chonek and the goalkeeper with this shot.\n29:6 Comment: But neither one nor the other could be done.\n29:8 Comment: This is Andrey's debut.\n29:14 Comment: This is the debut of Andrei Fullignati.\n29:17 Comment: He conceded already in the 23rd minute of his first match.\n29:24 Comment: Serie A.\n29:31 Comment: But he is difficult, of course, to blame.\n29:33 Comment: El Sharoway hit hard.\n29:35 Comment: It turned out that between the legs.\n29:37 Comment: True, Fullignati also jumped there.\n29:39 Comment: But again.\n29:44 Comment: Although, you know, if, for example, Fullignati had stayed in place and not jumped.\n29:50 Comment: I wouldn’t necessarily even have time to put it together.\n29:52 Comment: But just if the ball had hit him in the leg there.\n29:54 Comment: Well, position himself like this.\n29:56 Comment: Many would say that El Sharoway just got into it.\n30:0 Comment: The forward is to blame.\n30:2 Comment: This is all to say that sometimes such saves seem simple.\n30:7 Comment: They only say that the goalkeeper took the position perfectly.\n30:11 Comment: Here.\n30:12 Comment: Did not have.\n30:15 Comment: Have Trizon evaluate the position.\n30:17 Comment: Chentsnogo.\n30:19 Comment: Hit.\n30:20

attack.\n30:31 Comment: And now I'm at the helm.\n30:33 Comment: Mario Ruy.\n30:35 Comment: El Sharoway.\n30:37 Comment: Fought with Gatsa.\n30:40 Comment: Stefan himself got it.\n30:41 Comment: Well, he didn’t remain in debt.\n30:46 Comment: I'm going to the skating rink.\n30:48 Comment: Yes, it's unpleasant.\n30:50 Comment: But some kind of accentuated movement.\n30:53 Comment: In principle, this is exactly how El Sharoway waved it off, because the rules were broken on him.\n30:57 Comment: That is, they lost their balance.\n30:59 Comment: Full Guts is paramount here.\n31:2 Comment: El Sharoway.\n31:4 Comment: Cast from Jesus.\n31:6 Comment: Well, Golan.\n31:7 Comment: Excellent processing.\n31:8 Comment: Another thing is that the Belginian was on horseback.\n31:11 Comment: A wave

Foul.\n44:48 Comment: And here is also Grinere.\n44:53 Comment: He pushed his opponent away rudely.\n44:55 Comment: Well, the referee didn’t think that...\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: close to the

ball.\n2:16 Comment: It's a bit far.\n2:17 Comment: He let me go.\n2:20 Comment: It seems to me that at some point he realized that if he kept the ball, it would be for the opponent.\n2:25 Comment: Well, at least I decided that way, right?\n2:27 Comment: Knock out of bounds in order to return in time.\n2:31 Comment: You never know, a counterattack.\n2:37 Comment: Nestorovsky.\n2:38 Comment: Today he makes a lot of noise, runs around a lot, and rolls around.\n2:44 Comment: But he still, yes, understands that he is the leader of the team.\n2:55 Comment: Chief referee Gianluca Ruchi.\n2:57 Comment: This is Dmitry Shnyakin.\n2:59 Comment: Iroma will commentate this game for you in a quick break.\n3:2 Comment: Greenier.\n3:3 Comment: Greenier to the flank.\n3:5 Comment: Not a very convenient transfer.\n3:6 Comment: This is El Sharawi.\n3:8 Comment: Again he gives speed to this attack.\n3:10 Comment: Greenier.\n3:11 Comment: Hit.\n3:12 Comment: And Chochev takes it upon himself.\n3:18 Comment: Submission from Greenier.\n3:20 Comment: AND...\n3:20 Comment: Well, you and I literally watched some kind of flashback.\n3:26 Comment: We observed.\n3:27 Comment: One on one attack.\n3:29 Comment: One to one.\n3:30 Comment: Pass to Grinier.\n3:32 Comment: And he curls the ball towards the far post with his right foot.\n3:37 Comment: And again Stefan El Sharawi was there.\n3:40 Comment: He, however, hesitated a little.\n3:42 Comment: Probably, it was not the most convenient position for a touch shot, as it was in the first half.\n3:47 Comment: Well, nevertheless, Andrea Fulignati gives the team this scoring chance.\n3:52 Comment: I’ll say it again, Fulignati’s first match of the new season.\n3:56 Comment: Debut.\n3:56 Comment: First.\n3:57 Comment: And as the season progressed, Horvat Josip Posovec found himself in the reserves.\n4:2 Comment: Lopez's curious decision.\n4:4 Comment: Diego Lopez, they haven't talked about him yet.\n4:8

Comment: Sophisticated!\n4:39 Comment: Nestorovsky hands over the command.\n4:41 Comment: Strong transfer nonetheless.\n4:43 Comment: The attack has a second wind.\n4:45 Comment: This is Shalay.\n4:47 Comment: Selection\n4:49 Comment: And a counterattack.\n4:50 Comment: Roma has the answer.\n4:51 Comment: El Sharawi picks up speed in the left traffic jam.\n4:53 Comment: Look how he's rushing.\n4:54 Comment: To Ingalam.\n4:55 Comment: He stopped a little to support the attack at the second pace.\n4:58 Comment: And El Sharawi earned a corner.\n5:0 Comment: This is the segment.\n5:3 Comment: Completely different.\n5:5 Comment: Another energy.\n5:9 Comment: Other intentions.\n5:11 Comment: Chochev played the Sicilian in a tackle, starting this counterattack.\n5:15 Comment: And Diamantius is absolutely right in his decision.\n5:17 Comment: Absolutely.\n5:18 Comment: Was covered by Nestorovsky.\n5:20 Comment: Here, however, he made a strong pass, it seems to me, to his partner,\n5:23 Comment: which, with a more convenient...\n5:25 Comment: ...the passer could, of course, shoot on touch.\n5:28 Comment: But El Sharawi is not bad either, right?\n5:30 Comment: Ran 90 meters.\n5:32 Comment: The corner earned.\n5:34 Comment: This corner is performed by Pareles.\n5:37 Comment: Strong twist.\n5:39 Comment: And to Ingalam.\n5:41 Comment: It’s hard, of course, to break out of such a situation.\n5:43 Comment: There's a partner here.\n5:44 Comment: He was facing the gate.\n5:46 Comment: It's worth leaving it a little.\n5:49 Comment: But I'm sure I would have left it at Ingalam if I had just seen it.\n5:53 Comment: The partner is also in a hurry.\n5:55 Comment: So, at the blade, at first there was a draw with Napoleon.\n6:0 Comment: Absolutely amazing.\n6:2 Comment: And victory over Crouton.\n6:4 Comment: Many believed. Really?\n6:6 Comment: Is it really the same coach who will pull Polermo out of the swamp by the ears, by the hair?\n6:10 Comment: He doesn't.\n6:11 Comment: In the next four matches there was only one draw with Samdoria.\n6:14 Comment: True, it was a lost victory.\n6:16 Comment: Everyone had a chance to win.\n6:18 Comment: Ingalam shoots.\n6:23 Comment: It's a curious statistical fact.\n6:26 Comment: During these six matches at the helm of Polermo, Lopez and his team never left a game without a goal.\n6:36 Comment: Polermo always scored.\n6:38 Comment: True, there is always exactly one ball.\n6:41 Comment: Here too, it seems to me, of course, better than one.\n6:45 Comment: Although, well, we'll see.\n6:47 Comment: Goes to the Games.\n6:48 Comment: Innings.\n6:49 Comment: This is under attack, apparently, right away.\n6:51 Comment: But Paredos had no time here.\n6:52 Comment: Moreover, he is wrong.\n6:53 Comment: There is an opportunity to escape.\n6:55 Comment: Violation of the rules is not recorded.\n6:57 Comment: In my opinion, absolutely fair.\n7:0 Comment: Shalay was afraid of his opponent.\n7:6 Comment: Collapsed even before contact was made by El Sharawi.\n7:13 Comment: He's on the flank again.\n7:15 Comment: Salah takes a position.\n7:17 Comment: Well, a false nine.\n7:18 Comment: Probably that's his way.\n7:20 Comment: Salah, again, is not so easy.\n7:21 Comment: Versatile defensive player.\n7:23 Comment: But now we’re talking more about Roma’s defense.\n7:27 Comment: Because Polermo is rushing forward.\n7:29 Comment: Alice.\n7:30 Comment: Chochev is on the left edge here.\n7:31 Comment: Chochev.\n7:32 Comment: The center is shifting.\n7:33 Comment: Prepares the serve.\n7:34 Comment: No, he plays low.\n7:35 Comment: Back!\n7:36 Comment: Nestorovsky returned this narrow ball into the corridor.\n7:40 Comment: Well, the shutters are closed.\n7:43 Comment: Everyone is afraid.\n7:45 Comment: Salah, by the way, rarely.\n7:48 Comment: Rarely ends up with the ball.\n7:49 Comment: But, by the way, this is not so.\n7:50 Comment: Well, this is probably the case when they should rather throw it at their partners.\n7:54 Comment: Do not notice.\n7:56 Comment: Well, or just to such an attack vector.\n8:0 Comment: Forward cast.\n8:2 Comment: Diamantis, of course, will somehow catch up.\n8:12 Comment: Salah!\n8:14 Comment: You won't be able to go one on one.\n8:15 Comment: But he makes the pass.\n8:17 Comment: Which Marganella reads.\n8:20 Comment: Diamantium!\n8:21 Comment: And a yellow card will certainly be issued to Boredes.\n8:26 Comment: This football player adds.\n8:29 Comment: He gets a lot more playing time.\n8:31 Comment: There was practically a season where he sat on the bench forever.\n8:37 Comment: But they believed in him.\n8:40 Comment: I understand that there are prospects.\n8:43 Comment: They gave it away.\n8:44 Comment: Well, it’s not like it’s impossible to get out.\n8:46 Comment: This was his first season at Roma.\n8:48 Comment: In 2014-2015.\n8:50 Comment: He began in Italy to compose Eve.\n8:53 Comment: I played quite a bit.\n8:55 Comment: He then played 10 matches for Roma.\n8:57 Comment: Again, rather, coming out in the second halves.\n9:0 Comment: Then he moved to Empoli.\n9:2 Comment: And he did well last season at Empoli.\n9:4 Comment: 33 games, 2 goals, assist.\n9:6 Comment: In general, contact was established in the middle of the field.\n9:11 Comment: So he returned to Roma.\n9:13 Comment: He has 2 goals already this season.\n9:18 Comment: Well, I repeat, this is the status of semi-main.\n9:22 Comment: Half-reserve.\n9:24 Comment: There are still 22 years ahead.\n9:27 Comment: Pass to the left edge.\n9:30 Comment: From here Diamantiy begins his approach.\n9:35 Comment: Original.\n9:37 Comment: Well, Diamantium is like that too.\n9:40 Comment: Ubiquitous position player.\n9:45 Comment: It can start from anywhere.\n9:47 Comment: Maybe finish the attack.\n9:49 Comment: Innings.\n9:51 Comment: Shchensny.\n9:52 Comment: This is, of course, an attack on the goalkeeper.\n9:54 Comment: In my opinion, Rocky had a point here.\n9:56 Comment: Give a whistle.\n9:58 Comment: An opponent flew into him.\n10:0 Comment: Well, Rocky, by the way, this is also important.\n10:4 Comment: I didn’t argue with Schentsny at all.\n10:7 Comment: They won't let you repeat it.\n10:9 Comment: Like this.\n10:15 Comment: They won't let you repeat it.\n10:25 Comment: Noam loses the ball.\n10:28 Comment: Grigner, how good the Frenchman is today in this depth.\n10:33 Comment: And picks up the balls.\n10:35 Comment: And he takes them away altogether.\n10:37 Comment: And he launches attacks well.\n10:40 Comment: Well, of course, there is very strong, serious competition.\n10:43 Comment: In the middle of the field.\n10:45 Comment: Noam.\n10:47 Comment: Excuse me.\n10:48 Comment: Strotman plays there.\n10:50 Comment: Derosi will not always be the main place.\n10:52 Comment: Dan shows up.\n10:54 Comment: Lessamim.\n10:56 Comment: On the opponent.\n10:58 Comment: Greenier.\n11:0 Comment: I hope to make another assist.\n11:2 Comment: Again trying to supply Nijemer Sharavi.\n11:4 Comment: Such a connection today.\n11:6 Comment: Wow.\n11:25 Comment: Stefan El Sharawi.\n11:26 Comment: Often, I remember, they snatched his face when he\n11:27 Comment: was located on the substitutes' bench.\n11:29 Comment: And it was clear that he was very, very worried about the connection\n11:33 Comment: with this reserve status of his.\n11:36 Comment: In Milan, of course, he had his last season, well,\n11:40 Comment: himself.\n11:41 Comment: absolutely what and there for three years scored 18 3 goals 3 goals 3 assists gave sensations for 18\n11:52

sword to get there is much more dangerous\n13:20 Comment: Polerma goes into a positional attack, very few of them are like that and it was like that in the first half Alice instant crosses\n13:29 Comment: great corner earned\n13:31 Comment: good second half, this Norwegian is almost crying, he systems that the transmission was interrupted because\n13:38 Comment: how it opened there, not

Another cast.\n16:13 Comment: It seems to me, by the way, that Edin Jack needs to be quietly uncovered.\n16:19 Comment: There is a feeling that he feels uncomfortable on the field.\n16:22 Comment: Salah.\n16:24 Comment: Still, he is good when he picks up speed a little from deep.\n16:29 Comment: When he sees.\n16:31 Comment: Field.\n16:32 Comment: Half a turn.\n16:33 Comment: But in this situation he must work with his back.\n16:35 Comment: Turnover\n16:36 Comment: In fact.\n16:36 Comment: Well, or react somehow while casting.\n16:39 Comment: This is not his.\n16:40 Comment: Of course, Jack is a more skilled player in this regard.\n16:46 Comment: Equipped, of course, with physical data.\n16:49 Comment: Lopez is here.\n16:51 Comment: Also included in the game.\n16:55 Comment: Covering the ball with your body.\n16:57 Comment: This is true.\n17:1 Comment: During the entire current season, Palermo has won only one victory at home, Norenzo Barbero.\n17:12 Comment: Yes, of course, fans have the right.\n17:14 Comment: Do not let anyone express their opinion.\n17:17 Comment: One victory.\n17:18 Comment: And over whom?\n17:19 Comment: Over the steep.\n17:20 Comment: This is exactly what happened during Lopez’s work.\n17:24 Comment: Rui.\n17:31 Comment: Fasio.\n17:37 Comment: There is, of course, a lot of talk about how Fazio has improved.\n17:44 Comment: Under the leadership of the Spleti and in Roma in general.\n17:48 Comment: Still, other qualities of a defender during his entry into Spain.\n17:53 Comment: Well, he differed primarily in his ability to fight.\n17:56 Comment: And hard joints.\n17:59 Comment: A large number of yellow cards are red too.\n18:1 Comment: And here he became a little calmer.\n18:4 Comment: With a very good selection of positions.\n18:7 Comment: And he no longer has any reason to fail so often.\n18:10 Comment: Moreover, in this scheme with three central defenders, the load is redistributed between their partners.\n18:17 Comment: And having settled down well, he already wins the episode.\n18:23 Comment: Well, Jekwa, you see, you and I predicted it.\n18:29 Comment: There, in Rennes.\n18:30 Comment: How?\n18:31 Comment: Salah drops a little towards the attack.\n18:37 Comment: Well, Edin, Dzhekov.\n18:39 Comment: The first plan chooses.\n18:41 Comment: This emblem is beautiful.\n18:43 Comment: Romans on the away kit.\n18:46 Comment: We're already used to it too.\n18:47 Comment: In general, in general, this T-shirt is in the style of minimalism.\n18:52 Comment: Of course it gets chained.\n18:54 Comment: Everyone has.\n18:56 Comment: Dzhekov goes out onto the field with a smile.\n18:58 Comment: Edin, Dzhekov.\n19:0 Comment: Top scorer.\n19:1 Comment: Roma.\n19:3 Comment: And a contender for the trophy for the best scorer based on the season.\n19:8 Comment: 19 goals in 27 matches.\n19:12 Comment: By the way, there is also an important point that many people forget about.\n19:16 Comment: Also 7 assists in the outflow.\n19:19 Comment: There is, of course, such...\n19:27 Comment: hard fall.\n19:29 Comment: Done for Morganello.\n19:30 Comment: And everything is fine with us.\n19:31 Comment: Because it worked out, of course.\n19:34 Comment: The elbow grouped up so quickly.\n19:37 Comment: Well, it seems so.\n19:43 Comment: Michelle quickly came to his place.\n19:46 Comment: Try this about Edin Dzhekov.\n19:49 Comment: Still, he is considered to be the most technically gifted football player.\n19:55 Comment: Well, especially, yes, after the mistakes he had last season.\n20:0 Comment: They were indignant.\n20:1 Comment: The fans were just spectators.\n20:4 Comment: Well, here you go: 8 goals in 31 matches last season.\n20:8 Comment: 19 goals this season.\n20:10 Comment: And 7 gears.\n20:12 Comment: This is a player who knows how to play.\n20:15 Comment: Boris, who knows how to play for his partner.\n20:18 Comment: Feels great while hunting.\n20:20 Comment: And we will have a neat boy.\n20:23 Comment: And it seems to me that even now he does not have so many tasks.\n20:26 Comment: Not only to break into the foreground.\n20:30 Comment: Just handle the ball.\n20:31 Comment: It’s the transfers that need to be made.\n20:32 Comment: That's how it is now.\n20:33 Comment: Here! Here!\n20:35 Comment: Why is Edin Dzhekov coming out?\n20:37 Comment: And Salat, of course, is not capable of all this in the role of center forward.\n20:41 Comment: Winning the fight with that back to the goal.\n20:46 Comment: This is such a specific job that actually\n20:49 Comment: even there the most skilled attacking flank player, yes,\n20:57 Comment: some kind of superstar, not always capable.\n21:1 Comment: But, by the way, as for Jack and his prospects in the scorer race,\n21:11 Comment: It’s clear that this season she’s very interesting.\n21:15 Comment: She's very interesting.\n21:16 Comment: At the moment, we can say, four players are participating in it.\n21:22 Comment: But it still seems to me that Mertens will go at some point, even five, yes, Mertens will go at some point.\n21:30 Comment: Salah.\n21:33 Comment: No, here the second, third was insured, but it was a violation of the rules.\n21:38 Comment: This point is already very, very dangerous.\n21:43 Comment: Yellow card.\n21:47 Comment: It seems to me that Poehler is wasting his own time as a football player.\n21:50 Comment: In these showdowns.\n21:52 Comment: Own.\n21:53 Comment: They lost.\n21:55 Comment: Well, while here, again, Guts gets yellow.\n21:57 Comment: While Passion is here.\n22:1 Comment: Turns around.\n22:3 Comment: Although, you know, he took a step.\n22:5 Comment: He took a step.\n22:7 Comment: After jumping over Guts' leg.\n22:11 Comment: El Sherawy had every chance to survive.\n22:15 Comment: Although, apparently, there was also contact.\n22:17 Comment: But, really, Guts, you see, since the football player defends his position so zealously.\n22:23 Comment: It seems to me that if he understood that the player could be touched, there would be no complaints against the orbit.\n22:29 Comment: And here...\n22:30 Comment: This...\n22:31 Comment: For some reason I want to believe Guts.\n22:32 Comment: Anyway.\n22:33 Comment: Belotti is fast in his scoring race with 22 goals.\n22:37 Comment: Icardi has 20.\n22:39 Comment: Jack has 19.\n22:41 Comment: Higuain has 19.\n22:43 Comment: And Mertens too.\n22:44 Comment: There is already a further gap.\n22:45 Comment: Immobile has three goals.\n22:47 Comment: This whole company is unlikely to get involved.\n22:50 Comment: But Belotti, Icardi, Jack, Higuain, Mertens, it seems to me, will appear less often towards the end of the season.\n22:56 Comment: The city has a center forward.\n22:57 Comment: Still, the midshipman recovered.\n22:59 Comment: There is one in Valletta.\n23:1 Comment: Paredes.\n23:2

has his own company here.\n25:11 Comment: Tegrites Capital.\n25:14 Comment: Well, actually, she is going to purchase 100% of the shares of Polermo in April.\n25:21 Comment: We bought these shares from

anyway...\n25:54 Comment: But still, the contender for the title of top scorer in the Italian championship probably could have shot more skillfully.\n26:5 Comment: Strotman.\n26:6 Comment: Well, this is to cement the very middle of the field and stop these Sicilian attacks.\n26:13 Comment: Stefan El Sharowy.\n26:15 Comment: Congratulations to him on yet another goal.\n26:18 Comment: Stefan's fourth goal of the outside season.\n26:21 Comment: 7 points according to the goal plus pass system.\n26:23 Comment: Before that, he scored against Crotone.\n26:25 Comment: By the way, Palermo scored in the first round.\n26:28 Comment: Then Roma won with a score of 4-1.\n26:30 Comment: Yes, he also scored against Palermo.\n26:32 Comment: Chievo scored.\n26:34 Comment: Samdori scored.\n26:36 Comment: By the way, he hasn’t scored for a long time.\n26:38 Comment: Last time January 19th.\n26:41 Comment: Well, by the way, even in the Europa League, Austria scored two goals.\n26:44 Comment: By

Chechev.\n27:5 Comment: Lisamiy.\n27:7 Comment: Well, Nestorovsky could, of course, put his foot down more firmly.\n27:11 Comment: If I had placed it there, my opponent could have already flown into him.\n27:16 Comment: And Rocky, he’s not a fool to give a penalty.\n27:22 Comment: Just give him a reason.\n27:23 Comment: Ali Asami.\n27:24 Comment: And a throw to the far post.\n27:29 Comment: So

see that this leads to the creation of a certain\n27:54 Comment: tension inside even goalkeepers, not just free kicks.\n27:55 Comment: Replacement in the lineup with Palermo.\n27:56 Comment: Bruno Henrique is leaving the field.\n27:57 Comment: Serie A champion, by the way.\n27:58 Comment: True, in Brazil, from Carinthians.\n27:59 Comment: It was from Carinthiens that he moved to Palermo.\n28:18

Gatsey suggests.\n34:34 Comment: Alexandru Gatsey, the most experienced in this lineup, is 34 years old.\n34:38 Comment: He played 4 seasons in Torino, including being involved in Europe.\n34:43 Comment: But since this season, the footballer Valermo, well, not him, no one else, neither Ajelkovich, nor Marganello, no one prevented this goal from taking place.\n34:55 Comment: Like this with your heel. He was on horseback.\n34:58 Comment: Dorosi enters the field. All those three players who were turned off by the camera in the warm-up area in the first half, all of them were warming up for a reason.\n35:8 Comment: So.\n35:8 Comment: Zaimus Allah today is not the best game, let's say.\n35:12 Comment: Very rarely did he interact with his partners on the last third field.\n35:17 Comment: Still, he is exceptionally good there.\n35:21 Comment: So what about Nestarovsky? That's who is a little disappointing.\n35:26 Comment: Today he didn’t really show himself inside the penalty area.\n35:30 Comment: Regularly, of course, he dropped into the middle of the field, helping to play the ball.\n35:34 Comment: But this is not his football. Football for the 27-year-old striker.\n35:38 Comment: Trafic, this is goalkeeping, these are goals. 10 goals this season, I repeat.\n35:46 Comment: Now he is the most expensive footballer in Palermo.\n35:48 Comment: He was acquired from Inter from Banned.\n35:53 Comment: Which, by the way, is very good, has connections with Palermo.\n35:58 Comment: Three footballers from Banned moved to Palermo.\n36:2 Comment: This is Posovets, this is Troykovsky, this is Nestarovsky.\n36:8 Comment: They bought it for half a million.\n36:11 Comment: Now he’s already worth 3.5 thanks to his effectiveness.\n36:14 Comment: And we’ll also see whether Palermo will hold on to him or try to make money.\n36:18 Comment: But in general, you know, yes, there are talented guys, but for the team that prepared Debala for the giants,\n36:28 Comment: prepared Vasquis, prepared Kovani, have you forgotten about this at all?\n36:33 Comment: Edinson Covani played for Palermo.\n36:38 Comment: Of course, the guy and the club received a lot of money for this.\n36:41 Comment: Right now the most expensive player in its squad costs 3.5 million euros.\n36:47 Comment: This is about the current state of Palermo.\n36:51 Comment: Well, let's see how it will be with the new president,\n36:55 Comment: an ecstatic Mr., who, of course, his photo, covered in tattoos, has already gone viral on the Internet.\n37:6 Comment: This is what the head is like now.\n37:8 Comment: Football President.\n37:10 Comment: The guy who posed naked for the benefit of the campaign to protect lemons, let’s call it that way so as not to destroy it in vain.\n37:21 Comment: That's the kind of guy he is.\n37:22 Comment: I even managed to get another tattoo.\n37:26 Comment: I don’t know, he probably has about a dozen of them there.\n37:28 Comment: Club emblem tattoo.\n37:31 Comment: Yes, all the speakers are banal.\n37:38 Comment: He has already promised to build a new stadium, a new base.\n37:44 Comment: Well, it seems to me that we need to start with the composition.\n37:49 Comment: We need to build a new team.\n37:54 Comment: And there is already talk that Mr. Bocaglini is going to appoint Claudio Ranieri as the head coach of Palermo.\n38:8 Comment: True, I don’t know whether Ranieri will agree to train after the championship in England and the Champions League in Serie B.\n38:15 Comment: But Serie B, by the way, is a pretty strong tournament.\n38:18 Comment: After all, it is from there that the stars of Italian football come out time after time.\n38:24 Comment: Bellotti, Bernardeschi, El Sherawy, Verati also spoke about this.\n38:31 Comment: And the list could take a very long time.\n38:33 Comment: Incini.\n38:35 Comment: All of them.\n38:38 Comment: They sent us to the B series for training.\n38:45 Comment: The match continues.\n38:47 Comment: Here, of course, everything is more or less clear.\n38:50 Comment: Roma will not miss him.\n38:54 Comment: Well, this is a kind of scoring streak.\n38:57 Comment: Will it really end at Palermo?\n38:59 Comment: Six goals, one in each of Palermo's six matches under Diego Lopez.\n39:8 Comment: Which, of course, Palermo did not demonstrate outstandingly today.\n39:13 Comment: There were good stretches.\n39:15 Comment: Where it is clear that there was enough emotion, a desire to go on the attack.\n39:20 Comment: But nothing more.\n39:22 Comment: Diego Lopez.\n39:25 Comment: I worked experimentally in both Callera and Palermo.\n39:28 Comment: Here he is. More precisely in Bologna.\n39:31 Comment: Here's your chance in Palermo.\n39:33 Comment: By the way, he had a pause.\n39:35 Comment: In a year and a half with almost no...\n39:37 Comment: Almost no practice.\n39:41 Comment: It turns out that he is a football player who played for Callere for a long time.\n39:45 Comment: From '98 to 2010.\n39:48 Comment: Here he is now.\n39:50 Comment: A coach who is unable to rise from the bottom.\n39:55 Comment: Together with your team.\n39:57 Comment: Well, it’s true that Palermo is not at the very bottom.\n39:59 Comment: Let me remind you that this team is currently in 17th position.\n40:5 Comment: But the passage is too long.\n40:7 Comment: Here is Empo Lee.\n40:9 Comment: 7 points.\n40:10 Comment: Croutons.\n40:11 Comment: In Palermo 15.\n40:12 Comment: Croutons 14.\n40:13 Comment: Piscars 12.\n40:15 Comment: Here they are, the losers of the current season.\n40:22 Comment: Once again.\n40:26 Comment: Yes, everything is bad.\n40:27 Comment: Leo Croutons, Piscari.\n40:29 Comment: With teams that are selected from Serie B.\n40:31 Comment: They don't have enough resources to stay.\n40:35 Comment: Marganella.\n40:37 Comment: Throw in.\n40:38 Comment: Good presentation by Marganella.\n40:40 Comment: In fact, he was useful in attack today.\n40:43 Comment: But in defense, in fact, he lost two goals.\n40:46 Comment: At first Lesharovi missed.\n40:48 Comment: Then we saw that he was not far from Edin Jack.\n40:51 Comment: Who scored the second goal.\n40:58 Comment: He didn't have enough...\n41:0 Comment: Well, probably concentration to turn on in time.\n41:19 Comment: On the other hand, we saw another game version of the Romans.\n41:23 Comment: At the center of the attack is Stefan El Sharowy.\n41:26 Comment: But we know very well that he knows how to work there.\n41:30 Comment: And playing is also inspired.\n41:33 Comment: This is an option. The variant we have happens to be Ed Jack.\n41:36 Comment: And he...\n41:37 Comment: It was the two central forwards who, in fact, scored the goals today.\n41:40 Comment: El Sharovy and Ed Jacka.\n41:44 Comment: As it should be.\n41:45 Comment: Diamanti.\n41:53 Comment: Diamanti seemed, yes, to briefly inspire Palermo’s attack.\n41:57 Comment: Anyway, the ball started.\n41:59 Comment: Lingers on Roma's playlist.\n42:1 Comment: But he didn't invent anything really dangerous.\n42:14 Comment: Touch, pass.\n42:16 Comment: Roma attacks. Serve to Jack.\n42:23 Comment: He wasn't even a rider there yet.\n42:26 Comment: I took it.\n42:27 Comment: There he wasn’t even offside.\n42:29 Comment: There was some kind of whistling sound.\n42:31 Comment: Let's see.\n42:32 Comment: No. No offside.\n42:34 Comment: It just didn't hit.\n42:35 Comment: It was hard.\n42:43 Comment: Well, let's see what happens to Roma.\n42:46 Comment: At Roma's...\n42:49 Comment: The graph is interesting.\n42:51 Comment: Actually, next week the game is against Leon.\n42:55 Comment: Reply.\n42:57 Comment: Like Roma, I probably saved my strength for this match.\n43:1 Comment: And several key players remained on the bench.\n43:5 Comment: We saw that this game was not so draining for Roma.\n43:13 Comment: Economy mode is turned on. And they probably did the right thing.\n43:19 Comment: In any case, this is how we managed to win.\n43:22 Comment: Without any extra stress, it seems to me.\n43:25 Comment: Roma is also, of course, in the championship.\n43:30 Comment: Interesting encounters too.\n43:32 Comment: In the next round there is a home game with Sesoolo.\n43:35 Comment: Which was never a gift.\n43:38 Comment: There are, however, Empoli, Bologna, which...\n43:43 Comment: Now it’s unlikely that Roma can compete.\n43:46 Comment: Home game with Atalanta.\n43:48 Comment: It seems that it can turn out bright and effective.\n43:52 Comment: Listed away match.\n43:55 Comment: Where, probably, everything is also clear.\n43:57 Comment: And then three straight matches of the heaviest.\n44:1 Comment: Rome derby in the 34th round.\n44:4 Comment: In the 35th round Milan-Roma.\n44:6 Comment: And in the 36th there is a home game with Juventus.\n44:13 Comment: It will be very interesting.\n44:15 Comment: Yes, in the context of these conversations.\n44:19 Comment: The fact that Juventus will get over politics.\n44:22 Comment: It seems to me that there was a violation of the rules here.\n44:24 Comment: Rüdiger was also caught at the bureau there.\n44:26 Comment: But again an important point.\n44:27 Comment: Rüdiger doesn't argue.\n44:28 Comment: Therefore, there are probably no complaints against the arbitrator either.\n44:33 Comment: Again, there is such an arbiter that you can go argue with him.\n44:36 Comment: Morgan Alan.\n44:39 Comment: Decorates the ball.\n44:41 Comment: Immediately under pressure from Rui.\n44:43 Comment: It turns out that Rui is a very good football player.\n44:46 Comment: To be honest, I like this Portuguese guy.\n44:49 Comment: His style of playing on the sideline.\n44:54 Comment: Ever since Empley.\n44:55 Comment: But, of course, Emerson.\n44:58 Comment: Good.\n45:1 Comment: A very strong competitor.\n45:2 Comment: Two to two.\n45:3 Comment: This is what this attack could look like.\n45:6 Comment: Roman Strotman.\n45:10 Comment: Bruno Perez.\n45:11 Comment: And a goal!\n45:13 Comment: 3-0.\n45:15 Comment: Bruno Perez.\n45:17 Comment: Two-hearted Brazilian.\n45:19 Comment: Oh, of course, I would like to watch this from a repeat from a general plan.\n45:23 Comment: Where did he start this race?\n45:26 Comment: I think he definitely ran 60 meters on the scrap.\n45:31 Comment: Come on.\n45:32 Comment: It's not visible here.\n45:33 Comment: Here he is.\n45:34 Comment: From the center of the field.\n45:35 Comment: Here he is.\n45:36 Comment: Running.\n45:37 Comment: And Strotman.\n45:38 Comment: How he looked at it.\n45:39 Comment: How he saw this connection from Perez.\n45:42 Comment: After all, Strotman was preparing to pass while the Brazilian was still in the middle of the field.\n45:48 Comment: But he makes a pass there.\n45:51 Comment: Perez.\n45:52 Comment: Of course, already at an acute angle.\n45:54 Comment: He has at least the ability to accurately shoot.\n45:56 Comment: But he did it.\n45:57 Comment: Again, down under poor Fullignati, who is not helping the team.\n46:2 Comment: Although, it seems to me, he had a chance.\n46:4 Comment: Bruno Perez.\n46:5 Comment: Brilliant game.\n46:7 Comment: Like this.\n46:8 Comment: Enters the field.\n    \n\n    #######TASK \n    Provide a factually correct and detailed textual description of the game compiled from the information presented above from different sources, in more than 1000 words.\n            \"Comment.\": represents the real-time noisy commentary from the commentator as the game progresses.\n    Don't mention sources of information like commentators or captions, write as if you saw them live.\n    \n    ",
    "summary": "On a picturesque evening at the Renzo Barbera Stadium in Sicily, Palermo hosted AS Roma in a highly anticipated Serie A fixture. The match saw an explosive display from Roma, cruising to a 3-0 victory, showcasing their tactical prowess and individual brilliance.\n\nThe atmosphere in the stadium was electrifying as the starting lineups for both teams were announced. For Palermo, Andrew’s Gate was guarded by the young Andrea Fulignati, making his debut. The field players included Michel Morganella (#89), Haitam Aleesami (#19), Sinisa Andjelkovic (#4), and Thiago Cionek (#15). Midfield duties were tasked to Alessandro Gazzi (#14) and Ivaylo Chochev (#18). In the attacking lineup, Bruno Henrique (#25), Roland Sallai (#20), and Carlos Embalo (#11) provided the support to the lone striker Ilija Nestorovski (#30). Diego Lopez, the head coach of Palermo, had his work cut out against a formidable Roma side.\n\nRoma, under the watchful eye of Luciano Spalletti, fielded Wojciech Szczęsny (#1) between the sticks, with a backline of Juan Jesus (#3), Antonio Rüdiger (#2), and Federico Fazio (#20). Mario Rui (#21) and Bruno Peres (#13) provided width and defensive cover. The midfield trio comprised Leandro Paredes (#5), Clément Grenier (#7), and Radja Nainggolan (#4), the captain for the day. Up front, the attacking responsibilities were given to Mohamed Salah (#11) and Stephan El Shaarawy (#92).\n\nThe game kicked off with Palermo exhibiting a sense of urgency, but it was Roma who showcased control and composure early on. The first few minutes were relatively quiet, with both teams trying to settle into their rhythm. El Shaarawy and Salah often drifted wide, attempting to stretch the Palermo defense.\n\nBy the 12th minute, the game saw its first glimpse of intensity as El Shaarawy made a darting run, but his effort was intercepted. A foul on Nainggolan by Gazzi resulted in a free kick, showcasing the physical nature of the match. Roma, keen on asserting dominance, launched several forays into the Palermo half. Grenier whipped in a lethal cross, finding El Shaarawy who volleyed it expertly, forcing a save from Fulignati.\n\nIn the 22nd minute, Roma broke the deadlock. Grenier delivered a sublime touch pass into the path of El Shaarawy, who, with clinical precision, slotted the ball past the debutant Fulignati. The Palermo defense was caught napping, and the 23-year-old debutant goalkeeper couldn’t do much. This marked El Shaarawy’s fourth goal of the season, reflecting his sporadic yet impactful appearances in Spalletti’s side.\n\nPalermo’s response was spirited. Nestorovski, leading from the front, had a goal disallowed for offside shortly before. His work rate and determination were evident as he tried to marshal his team forward. However, defensive lapses and an inability to capitalize on key moments plagued Palermo's attempts. In the 35th minute, a loose ball from Morganella was pounced upon by Salah, but Rudi Garcia’s men managed to clear the danger.\n\nThe first half concluded with both teams displaying contrasting styles. Roma’s structure and discipline were evident, whereas Palermo’s erratic bursts of energy highlighted their struggle for consistency.\n\nThe second half commenced with more vigor from Palermo. Diego Lopez introduced Alessandro Diamanti (#23), seeking more creativity in the attack. Early on, Roma had a scare when Diamanti combined well with Embalo, leading to a net-shaking effort that was disappointingly wide off the target.\n\nRoma, however, remained unfazed. A calculated approach saw them dominate possession and create better chances. In the 58th minute, El Shaarawy, in a brilliant solo run, earned Roma a corner. The subsequent set-piece taken by Paredes saw Nainggolan almost doubling the lead with a thunderous header, which was just over the bar.\n\nBy the hour mark, Spalletti made a significant substitution, bringing on Edin Dzeko (#9) for a more direct attacking presence. This tactical masterclass clicked immediately. Roma gained a firm grip on the game’s tempo, with Dzeko providing a focal point.\n\nIn the 68th minute, Roma showcased their well-drilled set-piece routines. Nainggolan, with clever positioning and anticipation, placed a deft through ball towards Dzeko. The Bosnian, with impeccable chest control and finesse, nudged the ball through the legs of Fulignati, making it 2-0. This was his 20th goal of the Serie A season, underlining his status as one of the league’s top marksmen.\n\nPalermo’s attempts to claw back were spirited but ineffective. Efforts from Chochev and Aleesami were brilliantly neutralized by the Roman defense marshaled by Fazio and Rüdiger. With frustration mounting, Palermo's forays forward lacked the cutting edge needed to penetrate Roma’s resolute backline.\n\nIn the 83rd minute, Roma delivered the final blow. Kevin Strootman (#6), who had come on as a substitute, orchestrated a swift counter-attack. Spotting the lung-busting run of Bruno Peres, Strootman’s incisive pass split the Palermo defense. Peres, showing tremendous pace and composure, finished clinically past a hapless Fulignati. This goal encapsulated Roma’s superiority and tactical discipline.\n\nThe closing minutes saw little respite for Palermo. The Sicilians, visibly dejected, continued to push but failed to make any significant impact. The final whistle confirmed a convincing 3-0 victory for Roma.\n\nThis victory not only highlighted the tactical brilliance of Spalletti but also underscored the technical superiority and experience of the Roma squad. For Palermo, it was a stark reminder of the gulf in quality and the challenges that lie ahead. Despite showing glimpses of promise and resilience, the issues within the squad were glaring, from defensive frailties to an over-reliance on Nestorovski.\n\nIn summary, Roma's clinical finishing and cohesive team performance ensured a dominant display, further solidifying their position in the upper echelons of Serie A. Palermo, on the other hand, was left to regroup and address the critical areas needing improvement if they are to avoid relegation battles in the future. The fixture was a testament to Roma’s aspirations for European qualification, while Palermo’s struggles reflected their ongoing quest for stability and consistency in Italy’s top flight."
