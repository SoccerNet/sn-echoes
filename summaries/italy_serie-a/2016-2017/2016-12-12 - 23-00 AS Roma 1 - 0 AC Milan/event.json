    "summary": "In a closely contested Serie A encounter, AS Roma edged out AC Milan with a narrow 1-0 victory. The match took place on a cool evening at Stadio Olimpico, with both teams eager to secure crucial points in their bids for top-four finishes. Let's delve into the events of the match, which was filled with drama, intensity, and tactical maneuvers.\n\nThe match kicked off promptly at 00:00 as AS Roma took the initiative, starting the game with possession. Within the first few seconds, AC Milan committed a foul, setting the tone for what would be a highly physical battle. The resulting indirect free-kick at 00:30 saw AS Roma attempting to move the ball forward, but the early stages were marked by some scrappy play, including a ball going out of play at 01:06. AC Milan took a throw-in at 01:17, attempting to regain their composure.\n\nAS Roma quickly seized the initiative, however. By 01:33, they registered their first shots on target, putting AC Milan's defense under immediate pressure. The ball went out of play at 01:34, but the subsequent corner kick by AS Roma at 01:59 once again threatened the AC Milan goal. Another shot on target at 02:06 was skilfully blocked.\n\nThe game then fell into a pattern of intermittent play with the ball frequently going out of bounds. AC Milan had a throw-in at 02:55 but struggled to retain possession. By 04:45, AS Roma won another corner, only to see AC Milan clear the pressure moments later. AC Milan’s defensive resilience was on display, notably with a clearance at 04:59.\n\nThe match was certainly physical, with AC Milan committing another foul at 05:27, giving AS Roma another set-piece opportunity with an indirect free-kick at 06:00. The game continued to have a stop-start rhythm with both teams struggling to find their footing. AS Roma themselves were penalized for a foul at 06:02, allowing AC Milan to take a breather with an indirect free-kick at 06:43.\n\nThe 07:06 offside call against AC Milan summarized their early frustrations as they couldn't effectively break down AS Roma's defensive lines. This allowed AS Roma to regain possession and attempt to push forward, but they too were caught offside at 08:13. The game struggled to find a rhythm with both teams seeing the ball go out of play and subsequent throw-ins, but neither side could carve out clear opportunities.\n\nBy 11:08, AC Milan committed another foul, resulting in an indirect free-kick for AS Roma at 11:21. The home side continued to attack, but their end product was lacking, with the ball going out of play several times. AC Milan attempted to assert some control with throw-ins at 12:55 and 13:45 but couldn't penetrate AS Roma’s defense efficiently.\n\nThe fouls continued to flow, with AS Roma committing another at 14:01, providing AC Milan with another set-piece at 14:17. However, AC Milan couldn't capitalize on their opportunities. By 16:03, AC Milan committed yet another foul, and AS Roma had an indirect free-kick at 16:38, followed by a dangerous shot on target by AC Milan at 16:55, which tested the Roma goalkeeper.\n\nThe first yellow card of the game was shown to an AC Milan player at 17:39 following a foul at 17:34, indicating the referee's intent to clamp down on the physicality. AS Roma, buoyed by the enthusiastic crowd, continued their aggressive approach with another corner at 19:11, but their shots went off target at 19:15.\n\nThe constant interruptions characterized the first half as the ball frequently went out of play, illustrating a disjointed phase of the game. AS Roma tried to mount attacks through corners and set-pieces but couldn't find the breakthrough. AC Milan’s persistent fouling led to numerous free-kick opportunities for the home side. A substitution by AS Roma at 41:41 freshened their ranks, as the first half ended goalless but not without its share of intensity.\n\nThe second half began with AC Milan kicking off at 00:00, showing intent right from the start. However, the same theme of scrappy play continued, with the ball going out of play at 00:11. AS Roma took a throw-in soon after, at 00:21, as both teams continued to battle for control. AC Milan had an early shot on target by 03:14, testing the alertness of AS Roma’s defense once more.\n\nA corner for AS Roma at 04:36 offered another chance to break the deadlock, but the move ended with a foul by AS Roma at 04:40. AC Milan seized this opportunity to clear their lines with an indirect free-kick at 05:07. The game continued with the same vigorous intensity as in the first half, with frequent throw-ins and fouls disrupting the flow.\n\nBy 06:02, the ball went out of play again, followed by AS Roma’s throw-in. An offensive drive by AC Milan saw another shot off target by 06:57, which AS Roma cleared effectively. The combative nature of the game persisted, marked by another foul by AC Milan at 07:07 and the subsequent indirect free-kick by AS Roma at 07:23.\n\nAS Roma dominated stretches of the second half, with multiple throw-ins and attacking forays, although AC Milan stood firm defensively. By 10:23, AS Roma had another shot off target, and AC Milan resumed play with a clearance. More fouls followed, with AC Milan guilty of repeated infringement, offering AS Roma several free-kick attempts but without much success in converting these into goal-scoring opportunities.\n\nAs the match approached the hour mark, both teams seemed determined to find a breakthrough. At 13:05, AS Roma were flagged offside, and AC Milan had an indirect free-kick at 13:40, which didn’t yield much. AS Roma’s persistent efforts finally bore fruit at 16:50 when a shot on target found the back of the net, sparking jubilant celebrations among the home fans. This crucial goal came after relentless pressure and was a reward for AS Roma’s perseverance.\n\nAC Milan resumed the game at 17:48, trying to recover from the setback, but they were soon committing another foul at 18:26, highlighting their increasing desperation. As the game progressed, AS Roma had several more shots, some off target and others testing AC Milan’s defense.\n\nAC Milan attempted to juggle their tactics with a substitution at 20:59, introducing fresh legs in an effort to muster an equalizer. But their efforts were thwarted by AS Roma’s resolute defense, particularly through timely clearances. Another substitution by AC Milan at 26:01 indicated their urgency to change the outcome.\n\nDespite their attempts to force an equalizer, AC Milan were plagued by fouls, earning their players a yellow card at 33:00. They tried to push forward but lacked the required sharpness. AS Roma continued to play with composure, withstood AC Milan’s advances, and looked to counter whenever an opportunity arose.\n\nDefensively, AS Roma remained solid, dealing with AC Milan’s corners and clearances effectively. Even as the clock ticked towards the end, the game didn’t lose its spark with AS Roma committing cautious fouls to break the momentum of AC Milan. The visitors, despite their substitutions and change in tactics, couldn’t breach AS Roma’s defenses, and their final efforts in the last minutes, including corners and shots, failed to yield an equalizer.\n\nIn the concluding moments, a yellow card for AS Roma at 38:31 reflected the home side’s determination to hold onto their slender lead. AC Milan’s fervent attempts kept the crowd on the edge of their seats. However, AS Roma held their nerve, effectively managing the game till the final whistle.\n\nTo summarize, AS Roma’s resilience, coupled with tactical discipline and a crucial goal, saw them emerge victorious in a hard-fought 1-0 win over AC Milan. The match was marked by robust defensive displays, critical fouls, and a game-deciding moment that highlighted AS Roma’s persistence and AC Milan’s inability to capitalize on their opportunities. The win not only boosted AS Roma’s campaign but also underscored their ability to grind out results under pressure."
