youth.\n1:40 Comment: No. 13 Alexio Romagnoli and No. 15 Gustavo Gones.\n1:45 Comment: This is what the center of Milan's defense looks like today, which\n1:50 Comment: caused, frankly, quite a lot of problems\n1:55 Comment: to the same Vincenzo Monteno.\n1:57 Comment: Because here we had to experiment.\n2:1 Comment: In Empole's attack, Maccarone's shot misses.\n2:5 Comment: The gate there, in my opinion, there was a slight ricochet.\n2:8 Comment: So much for the defense of Italian Milan.\n2:13 Comment: Well, of course, Italian.\n2:15 Comment: Italian Grande, I wanted to say.\n2:18 Comment: And this is Romagnoli.\n2:20 Comment: It was Romagnoli who made such an imprudent pass\n2:24 Comment:  back.\n2:25 Comment: And please, the first dangerous moment.\n2:30 Comment: It was just when I started talking about defense.\n2:32 Comment: Gustavo Gones plays as a pair with Romagnoli.\n2:35 Comment: Gabriel Paletto remained on the bench today.\n2:41 Comment: This is the central defender.\n2:42 Comment: The 20th Ignacia Abbot and the 2nd Matia Deshili play on the flanks.\n2:48 Comment: Well, by the way, on the left flank, on the flank of Matija Deshili\n2:51 Comment: This

Comment:  A fall.\n3:35 Comment: Ricardo Saponara needs a warning.\n3:42 Comment: Not Romagnoli again.\n3:46 Comment: Super!\n3:54 Comment: Dropped the yellow card and then showed it\n3:59 Comment: The referee for today's match is Gian Paulo Calvaresa.\n4:6 Comment: At 40 years old, Terrana has never worked as a harvester\n4:9 Comment: in international matches.\n4:10 Comment: And it’s not a fact that this gap will ever be corrected.\n4:12 Comment: I already talked about the judge.\n4:13 Comment: For Calvarez's debut at a higher level after all\n4:16 Comment: It's not the right age anymore.\n4:19 Comment: But in the field, he is no longer new.\n4:22 Comment: And in recent years he cannot boast, but complain\n4:27 Comment: more precisely due to the lack of judicial practice.\n4:31 Comment: Well, we’ll talk about Calvarez’s statistics later.\n4:34 Comment: For now, let's look at the execution of the penalty box\n4:37 Comment: home team.\n4:38 Comment: Because this free kick can be very, very bad\n4:41 Comment: dangerous.\n4:43 Comment: Everything there is not as it should have been done by the Empol players\n4:49 Comment: Let it be in the yard.\n4:54 Comment: They're trying to get the ball into the offensive line.\n5:0 Comment: So, regarding the judge.\n5:5 Comment: The season before last he was on the service list\n5:9 Comment: 18 matches.\n5:10 Comment: In the past they were 16, but they are 7.\n5:13 Comment: What's interesting is that two years ago Jampal already had a chance\n5:16 Comment: work for matches with a similar sign to Empaul in Milan.\n5:21 Comment: And then not afraid to make an unpopular decision,\n5:25 Comment: Let's be honest with the referee, let's note this too, before the break\n5:29 Comment: the exalted head coach was removed to the podium,\n5:32 Comment: The owners of Mauritso Sari.\n5:34 Comment: 2-2.\n5:36 Comment: Then Empoli played Milan.\n5:39 Comment: But today the coach is not so exalted, of course,\n5:44 Comment: Empoli Martushyev's mentor.\n5:50 Comment: But I think that in the end the team must break through,\n5:53 Comment: because that's not the point.\n5:55 Comment: Empoli isn't scoring much in the current championship.\n5:59 Comment: Another strike attack here from Bonaruma.\n6:2 Comment: Bonaruma reliably covered the right corner.\n6:5 Comment: Sapanara did it on goal.\n6:7 Comment: So Empoli only touched in the current championship\n6:14 Comment: six balls.\n6:16 Comment: And, as I already said, four of them are Piskar gates.\n6:20 Comment: As for Piscara, Polermo, Cratona,\n6:23 Comment: These teams are probably not even at the level of Empoli.\n6:26 Comment: Exactly according to the budgets of Piscara and Kratona.\n6:28 Comment: Polermo and Haradid more than once recently\n6:31 Comment: we heard from the owner of Polermo,\n6:34 Comment: that he is ready to sell the club to Chinese investors.\n6:38 Comment: Okay, now we have another potential purchase\n6:43 Comment: Chinese investors on the field have almost taken place.\n6:47 Comment: This is a deal, yes, let me remind you again, it will end on December 13.\n6:50 Comment: And Milan, well, it’s not like it’s going to become Chinese.\n6:56 Comment:  Of course not.\n6:58 Comment:  But nonetheless.\n7:0 Comment: By the way, Silva Berliskoni has already spoken about this.\n7:5 Comment: He told me under what conditions he would agree to stay at the club\n7:9 Comment: as honorary president.\n7:12 Comment: He is offered to become, let me remind you, an honorary president.\n7:17 Comment: And Berlisconi himself is on the air of one of the Italian radio stations\n7:23 Comment: stated that the Chinese will invest money,\n7:26 Comment: bring Milan back to its previous world level,\n7:29 Comment: to new places.\n7:30 Comment: And he is ready to share his experience.\n7:32 Comment: But it all depends on whether he gets the chance to be honorary president.\n7:35 Comment: If such a proposal comes, there will be at least two.\n7:39 Comment: The requirement is to say yes or no when buying or selling football players,\n7:44 Comment: and also influence the team's tactics.\n7:46 Comment:  Like this.\n7:47 Comment: That is, Berlisconi does not want to leave Milan completely.\n7:52 Comment: Well, probably, Inter’s example spurred me on to some extent, yes.\n7:58 Comment: Perhaps it will spur Chinese investors in Milan in turn,\n8:2 Comment: So that after all, people who have had a relationship for many years,\n8:10 Comment: direct relation to this club, after all, somehow at first\n8:15 Comment: helped to plunge into this difficult world of the Italian series.\n8:20 Comment: Milan still have the ball. We can make a pass to the right.\n8:23 Comment: That's where the ball goes.\n8:29 Comment: Not for long, for a very long time Pashevich Abnoventura uses the candle.\n8:36 Comment: Already in the penalty area, he puts the ball under the left.\n8:39 Comment: Feed to the far post, discount.\n8:41 Comment: Will this attack end in a twist kick?\n8:44 Comment: No. Empele takes the ball and tries to quickly get out of defense,\n8:49 Comment: Which, by the way, works out.\n8:51 Comment: By the way, the hosts have a 4v4 attack.\n8:55 Comment: There was a run from the right, but the ball went to the left.\n8:58 Comment: And feed again in the direction of the Macaroni massif.\n9:2 Comment: I tried to send the ball to the near corner.\n9:6 Comment: But for now, I think you will agree, Empele looks more interesting,\n9:10 Comment: than their opponents.\n9:15 Comment: So, well, a replacement is already being prepared.\n9:19 Comment: It looks like Mathies and Fernandez are going to be replaced.\n9:31 Comment: Curious, very curious.\n9:38 Comment: He might be injured.\n9:40 Comment: Perhaps he has an injury and Chilic will end up leaving the field.\n9:48 Comment: Matties and Fernandez leave the field.\n9:51 Comment: Start appears on 33 numbers.\n10:5 Comment: Yes, Mathies and Fernandez were once called the Chilean Aradon.\n10:9 Comment: It was a long time ago.\n10:11 Comment: Now we haven't even had time to see him in action.\n10:15 Comment: Chilitz will be properly damaged.\n10:24 Comment: It's a shame, of course, I only played 10 minutes.\n10:29 Comment: Well, here we are shown the moment of breaking the rules.\n10:32 Comment: There was an overlap from Lokotel.\n10:34 Comment: Milan Lokotel, who has been talked about a lot lately.\n10:38 Comment: One of Milan's future stars, perhaps.\n10:43 Comment: Milan has serious problems with the squad.\n10:47 Comment: Now there's also Mathies and Fernandez.\n10:50 Comment: It is unknown how serious Chilica's injury is.\n10:55 Comment: And Drachan may be flying past everyone.\n11:1 Comment: But then somehow it felt like Kosta fell asleep a little.\n11:5 Comment: But then I decided to put my back on.\n11:9 Comment: And in the end, the out in favor of Entei.\n11:13 Comment: Recely will throw the ball in from the sideline.\n11:22 Comment: Exactly with Vitelli's ball.\n11:24 Comment: Cross into the penalty area. Makaronov fought.\n11:27 Comment: He's not the tallest, but he's the type of player who can get into the air.\n11:33 Comment: Well, then Pascual is on the selection.\n11:36 Comment: And a wrong turn.\n11:40 Comment: The hosts will not be helped in today's meeting in any way.\n11:44 Comment: Marco Zambellin is a defender and another defensive player is Vincent Laurie.\n11:50 Comment: And also Georgian forward Levan Chiglidze.\n11:55 Comment: All three are in the infirmary.\n11:57 Comment: But the loss of guests, of course, is noticeable.\n12:0 Comment: More serious, frankly speaking, both in quantitative and qualitative terms.\n12:6 Comment: In addition to the young David Calabri, the Argentine Lionel Van Joni is still not making his debut at the Minnistein Club.\n12:15 Comment: Van Gioni, as they call him, but Van Gioni is in the Italian style.\n12:20 Comment: Van Gyoni in Spanish.\n12:21 Comment: But still, I repeat once again, very often in Argentina Italian surnames are pronounced in Italian.\n12:28 Comment: So let it be Van John.\n12:31 Comment: For Milan, Carlo Kostelani, naturally, cannot play in any way after Ricardo Montalva, who was seriously injured in the match with the Spanish national team.\n12:41 Comment: Carlos Buck, who has problems with his hip today.\n12:45 Comment: That's why Gian Luca Lopatulo appeared in the starting line-up of the Milan team.\n12:52 Comment: But to Montello’s joy, Andreo Gartalachi and Olesya Romagnoli returned to duty,\n13:0 Comment: who entered the field in the center of defense from the first minutes without any buildup.\n13:7 Comment: The moisture magazine Etelosport also wrote about this.\n13:12 Comment: But as we see, Olesya Romagnoli doesn’t quite feel at ease.\n13:19 Comment: At least in the first minutes of Milan's attack.\n13:24 Comment: Sumso, probably one of the brightest players in Milan this season, a Spaniard, earned a corner.\n13:33 Comment: And also good press. The second scorer, by the way, after Bucky, who is not on today.\n13:42 Comment: Extremely inaccurate cross. And here the ball will be over the Raven's line.\n13:47 Comment: The goal kick will be taken by Luks Skorubski, who, in particular, in the match against Roma,\n13:54 Comment: against the club from which he is on loan, he was simply the savior of Empoli.\n14:0 Comment: And it was precisely the brilliant play of Skorubsky, a pupil of Gurnik Zadzhi, that brought Empoli one point.\n14:10 Comment: And now there's a loss. Milan's attack. Shot. Goal. Gian Luca burst out.\n14:16 Comment: Gian Luca made a noise. Scores the first goal.\n14:23 Comment: Milan takes the lead in this meeting. Lopotnula scored the second goal this season.\n14:29 Comment: In the 15th minute he sends the ball into the net of the Milan striker.\n14:34 Comment: And he justifies his appearance in the starting lineup and the fact that Vencienza Mantella chose him over Luis Adrian.\n14:44 Comment: An effective pass from Suso. Let's note it again. Yes, and here's a one-touch shot from almost the 11-meter mark.\n14:54 Comment: I made the right decision in this episode. I burst out. Empoli's player didn't have time to cover him.\n15:0 Comment: To prevent this blow from being delivered. And now there is a loss in our own half of the field. Suso ended up with the ball.\n15:8 Comment: Pass into the penalty area. This combination was played very simply. And Milan took the lead. 1-0.\n15:18 Comment: Although it seemed that Empoli looked more interesting in the first 15 minutes.\n15:30 Comment: The lineups of both are almost identical. I think I played Empoli at home against Ferentin on November 20.\n15:41 Comment: What Milan has against Inter. The Milan Derby, which is still being discussed.\n15:49 Comment: It is clear that Baku is in the starting lineup. But Nyanko also remained in reserve today.\n15:56 Comment: Yes, before the number one he moved up a little higher. And Matias Fernandez, accordingly, took the position in midfield.\n16:6 Comment: Now Matias Fernandez has received the path. Here at the exit he must play. And Don Ruma plays.\n16:13 Comment: But the ball is thrown directly at the opponent. 1-1. This is how events are developing with us. This is Ricardo Saponara.\n16:24 Comment: The second goal of the Empoli top ten of the season. Ricardo Saponara equalizes the score.\n16:35 Comment: Yes, but this is a mistake. A mistake by Januigi Donna Rume. I failed to hit the ball to the side.\n16:54 Comment: On the other hand, the players were insured by the defense team. So I think all levels should share the blame for this missed goal.\n17:7 Comment: So, 1-1. Ricardo Saponara equalizes. Milan did not win for long. About two minutes. Because Lopadula scored in the 15th minute. Even less than two minutes.\n17:26 Comment: As for personal meetings, the statistics are as follows. In 22 personal meetings within the framework of the Au Milan series, as one would expect, there is a significant advantage. 13 wins from goals and 2 defeats. A very typical difference in goals scored. 36 to 14.\n17:51 Comment: But it’s interesting that Hampel has still not known the joy of victories in home matches. 6 goals and 5 defeats. And before that, he beat the Rossoneria exclusively at San Siro. In 2003-2007, when, by the way, he was at the helm of Milan Carlo Anchelotti.\n18:15 Comment: Bonventure. The ball. It will be the one who takes this free kick.\n18:23 Comment: But a good high-altitude performer. The ball flew. And here he is forced to go out of the gate. The best Skorubsky. It went to Kutska.\n18:37 Comment: It was also missing that Kutska, who had just appeared on the field. Place of Mathies, Fernandez, Chiltra. But I think that everything will be fine here. Skorubsky just unintentionally touched him with his elbow, of course.\n18:54 Comment: But nevertheless. Goal kick. That's how they decided not to send the ball into the opponent's half of the field. Skorubchiki played to the neighbor. And again Empel lost the ball in his own half of the field.\n19:9 Comment: The Milanese try to combine with the ball in the area of ​​the central circle. Which, by the way, is typical of today's Milan. The team tries to play interestingly. And quite often it succeeds.\n19:30 Comment: Far way out of Donnaruma's penalty area. Roman Yolen. And here's a diagonal to the right. Masha Lich.\n19:54 Comment: Makatelem. Dashilem. Muratura. Masha Lich. And Abbate is further loaded closer to the penalty area. Goal kick.\n20:24 Comment: As for Giovanni Martuschiella. If we take the figure of head coach Empel. Quite unfamiliar, I think, to those who closely follow the Italian Serie A.\n20:51 Comment: Especially for a team from the bottom of the tournament. Tables. It’s probably worth telling a little about him. Well, it’s clear that he didn’t push the limits nicely.\n21:3 Comment: He spent almost his entire long career in the lower divisions. As a player. But looking into the A. Nadres Season series. From 1997 to 1999.\n21:15 Comment: It’s interesting that he spoke for Empel, who was fought by a young Russian fighter, still unknown to him, Luciano Spolets.\n21:27 Comment: Well, hanging up Bucin. In 2006, 4 years later, Martusciella already joined Empel’s coaching staff as an assistant. And thus never left the team.\n21:41 Comment: Now let's look at this corner. The delivery to the near post is quite unpleasant. But it copes defensively. Moreover, it was Macarona who came from his own penalty area.\n21:55 Comment: Badamin Turan. And a mistake. This time Romagnoli is making a mistake again. Yes, it was him. And such an attempt to throw Donna Rumi over the collar.\n22:19 Comment: But it didn't work out. Didn't hit Macaron's goal.\n22:23 Comment: No, not Romagnoli. Naturally, this is Locotel. Romagnoli was in the penalty area behind the central defense when taking a corner. This is Lokotel.\n22:39 Comment: And just like that, that’s it. And Macarona was in central midfield. And Romagnoli was racing back at full speed.\n22:49 Comment: There's a Sapper in the penalty area.\n22:57 Comment: Scratches the ball from Yusa. Returns control of the ball to Empoli.\n23:5 Comment: It is worth noting that, in general, among the numerous, so to speak, promotional Italian teams with modest resources, Empoli has long stood out for its desire to demonstrate technical and eye-catching football.\n23:21 Comment: And the main attribute is ball control. And based on this, the club, by the way, selects chat coaches. Moreover, some of them made a name for themselves by working for Carlo Kostelani.\n23:39 Comment: And in addition to the already mentioned flight to the 90s of the last century, which returned from Zyuri, this is the nickname of Empol, the highest movement, which started with the Chi series, a similar path was recently taken, by the way, by Mauri Tsyussai.\n23:58 Comment: This is also worth noting. We accept that in 2012 he found the club, well, frankly speaking, with the status of a hopeless outsider who barely held on to its second icon.\n24:12 Comment: But after a season, a lot has changed. At first, Sari’s team turned into one of the leaders of the division, but then in 2014 they stepped up and, to the surprise of the fans, easily retained their registration in Serie A.\n24:28 Comment: Having lost, say, a dozen times during the long championship, now the exclusive militia, which appeared, one cannot say, literally out of nowhere, pleasantly amazed the public with its taste, elegant combination football, has been working very well in Naples for the second year.\n24:51 Comment: But frankly speaking, Dashi Yong takes the ball away from the opponent. Praven Turan. Tokam and to the right. Abate is here.\n25:14 Comment: Here is Abate, here is Sumso, one of the main threats of Milan so far in this match for the opponent Bonaventura. Again he will swing under his left foot. No, he decided to shoot from the right. Yes, at first he shook the defender, but he was punched so unexpectedly.\n25:37 Comment: Bonaventure played very well in this episode. And there could have been any rebound here. And a dangerous situation. At the goal of the home team, who will now dribble the ball outside. This will be done by a man with a funny last name, Veselyev.\n25:57 Comment: If he were French, he would be Veselev. But still Veselev. Dashi Yong.\n26:19 Comment: Abate M.\n26:24 Comment: Amanya on the right.\n26:28 Comment: Gustavo Gomez.\n26:31 Comment: Gustavo Gomez played with Paleta.\n26:34 Comment: At first in pairs, then Milan's two central defenders acted strangely several times.\n26:42 Comment: As for Gustavo Gomez, let me remind you that he is a Proglaian.\n26:46 Comment: So let’s say, he’s a fairly young center back. He’s 23 years old. For a center back, that’s not old yet. Especially for a defender in Italy.\n27:6 Comment: Remembering the legends of Milan.\n27:16 Comment: Violation of the rules. Fall in the center of the field.\n27:21 Comment: Kempfel.\n27:30 Comment: Kempfel is generally a team that, so to speak, even after the departure of Muritze Sari did not stop, so to speak, moving forward.\n27:45 Comment: And with the next head coach Marco Giampalo continued Sari's work. But she was already on tap Vincenzo Montello. Milana's coach.\n27:56 Comment: And last spring Giampalo led Antoli to 10th place in the table. After which he also responded to the offer of the more ambitious Sammodori club.\n28:11 Comment: Sammodori is currently in 10th place.\n28:15 Comment: But in this way, Dzhampalo has already passed the baton to Martushyev.\n28:19 Comment: All this time he acted as an assistant.\n28:24 Comment: Well, as we can see from the current championship under the leadership of Martushyev, a 45-year-old specialist, the Tuscan team still plays in the manner set by his predecessors.\n28:45 Comment: Well, that's the real result. We've started to decline. 17th place.\n28:53 Comment: But it must be said that, after all, the main reasons that caused such a regression for Empol lie on the surface.\n29:7 Comment: Because last off-season, Empoli simply lost several leading players at once, including Leandro Paredes, Trazelinsky, Lorenzo Tonnelli in Naples.\n29:26 Comment: In return, he acquired either 100% veterans, like the same Munoel Pasquale or Albert Gilardi.\n29:43 Comment: Either he’s not in a hurry to show his youth yet, and besides, he’s stopped scoring massive crowns to the same extent.\n29:55 Comment: Such an exciting forward, if you show him in a round shot.\n30:5 Comment: Not a bad translation to Suso.

predecessors\n25:34 Comment: No need for Dilit-Tyre.\n25:38 Comment: Yes, because we have\n25:41 Comment: Susa is in this championship, by the way, until today's game\n25:44 Comment: scored 8 points

gain a foothold from Iskariev in Serie A.\n28:9 Comment: Well, unlike its competitors, Tuscan football, at least,\n28:15 Comment: There are, to some extent, serious disgraces.\n28:19 Comment: The main thing is the game, the manner of play, the pace.\n28:23 Comment: Truth, here, let's say, confidently controlling the ball,\n28:30 Comment: On average, it turns out to be 50.5%, and this is simply atypical\n28:37 Comment: high for an outsider.\n28:40 Comment: Of course, they score very few goals.\n28:46 Comment: Gilardino appears on the field instead of Marie Lungo.\n28:54 Comment: Well, let's see.\n28:58 Comment: Alberto Gilardino entered the field for Empuli.\n29:23 Comment: Empuli, who has lost two goals so far.\n29:38 Comment: Let me remind you that Gilardino played for Milan and played well\n29:44 Comment: with pretty decent results.\n29:49 Comment: Makaronen, Makaron's near gate has come out.\n29:58 Comment: Well, he played more than 50 matches for the Italian national team\n30:4 Comment: Alberto Gilardino.\n30:7 Comment: Gilardino, 76 minutes, the last 15 minutes went to the boiler match.\n30:17 Comment: Dashillo, again with the ball from Dashillo.\n30:24 Comment: Dashillo, as a result, finally accepted 勝 bunları.\n30:41 Comment: Elbow combinations.\n30:48 Comment: Mat, Gomez.\n30:58 Comment: Gathered players in the abbot's blue uniform around him.\n31:0 Comment: Look how Susa gets out of such a difficult situation.\n31:4 Comment: Pass to Lokotel.\n31:6 Comment: Lokotel transfer to the left flank.\n31:10 Comment: Again, such a geometrically cool, perfect attack.\n31:15 Comment: Here Susa spread his arms to the side, waited for the pass, waited, and turned the shot.\n31:20 Comment: And as a result, the offside position was recorded here.\n31:26 Comment: Unfortunately, again for Milan fans.\n31:33 Comment: Pasha Licha.\n31:36 Comment: Suso.\n31:38 Comment: Good Suso, probably the best player of the match.\n31:43 Comment: And here it is, please.\n31:45 Comment: As soon as I said this, Gianluca Lopodula decided to object to me.\n31:51 Comment: As if to say why I'm worse.\n31:53 Comment: And a double, a double of Lopodula.\n31:57 Comment: And here he is, as soon as I said this, Gianluca Lopodula decided to object to me.\n32:2 Comment: And a double, a double of Lopodula.\n32:5 Comment: 4-1.\n32:10 Comment: Just the defeat of Empoli.\n32:13 Comment: Just a disaster.\n32:25 Comment: They show us Adrien Galiani all the time.\n32:29 Comment: This is probably also a hint that the team, this team, it...\n32:37 Comment: I was planning, it turns out, with the future owners of Milan.\n32:46 Comment: Lopodul doesn't want to leave.\n32:51 Comment: But they probably won't change him, I think.\n32:55 Comment: Maybe, by the way...\n32:56 Comment: Yes, Pashevich.\n32:59 Comment: Nyang appears on the field instead of Pashevich.\n33:8 Comment: Oh, Nyang took...\n33:16 Comment: I probably took a place on the flank in the attack.\n33:20 Comment: No, I see, now they showed us in midfield.\n33:26 Comment: Pussy Honda.\n33:47 Comment: Makaru Gen.\n33:49 Comment: What a desperate blow.\n33:52 Comment:  Pasta.\n33:56 Comment: In general, as I already said, the percentage of possession of nothing is on average more than 50.\n34:2 Comment: This is not a typically high figure.\n34:5 Comment: But, of course, the Empoli players score terrible goals.\n34:12 Comment: They give birth to these goals.\n34:14 Comment: That makes 7 goals.\n34:17 Comment: Worst record in the league.\n34:21 Comment: For the time being, yes, again we could talk about the strength of Empoli's rear.\n34:29 Comment: But look, for the second game in a row the team concedes 4 goals.\n34:36 Comment: Although it would seem that this was exactly the game that the team demonstrated,\n34:44 Comment: It helps to avoid these devastating shields.\n34:50 Comment: Because introducing the game is remarkable in the center of the field,\n34:54 Comment: Empoli dramatically reduces the pressure on their defense in this way\n34:58 Comment: And, of course, it's not very convenient.\n35:0 Comment: Empoli dramatically reduces the pressure on their defense in this way\n35:4 Comment: and in general rarely allows himself to be taken by surprise.\n35:9 Comment: It’s not working out yet with teams like Milan.\n35:17 Comment: And then, again, we remember, a loss in our own half of the field is also not typical.\n35:24 Comment: In general, for the current Empoli.\n35:27 Comment: Because all attacks of this team develop, as a rule, smoothly and logically.\n35:34 Comment: Without any ridiculous passes that cut off half the team.\n35:39 Comment: This means that it’s not often that clubs have to defend differently than positionally.\n35:56 Comment: Well, probably, again, here we can to some extent talk about a resource, right?\n36:9 Comment: That is, about the material that you have to work with in flashier.\n36:13 Comment: This material is not the highest quality, right?\n36:16 Comment: That is, it is torn in places, on the shadows, and the seam has gone.\n36:22 Comment: Which is what Milan did today.\n36:27 Comment: Empoli had very good statistics, right?\n36:39 Comment: It was a little more during the match, and they missed.\n36:43 Comment: But again, today the statistics have deteriorated.\n36:48 Comment: Now for the Tuscan team.\n36:52 Comment: Second defeat in a row with a big score.\n36:58 Comment: 0-4 is Fiorentina at home, 1-4 again at home for Milan so far.\n37:6 Comment: Well, maybe the score won’t be big, maybe one will win back, and maybe one will miss again.\n37:10 Comment: But here Niang is offside.\n37:12 Comment: I didn’t name all the pairs for you, right?\n37:20 Comment: She said, speak up.\n37:22 Comment: And so Ballon plays with talent.\n37:24 Comment: Calli-orizer receives from Dineso Cratone.\n37:28 Comment: And Dory himself is dating.\n37:31 Comment: One of Empoli's competitors in the fight for survival.\n37:34 Comment: Genoa Juventus.\n37:36 Comment: It will be an interesting game.\n37:40 Comment: 17-0 Moscow time.\n37:45 Comment: Eugene will play.\n37:49 Comment: Genoa has looked very weak in recent matches.\n37:53 Comment: They looked good with Latsi back and forth.\n37:58 Comment: But let me remind you that they also lost due to talent.\n38:2 Comment: The Latsi gave in in one click.\n38:4 Comment: At times, but a pro, let's say so.\n38:7 Comment: And Roma takes Piscara from an outsider.\n38:10 Comment: And Monday on the Solo strip.\n38:13 Comment: And a very interesting meeting will be Inter-Feorentino.\n38:19 Comment: Inter-Feorentino. How's Inter doing, huh?\n38:24 Comment: With a new coach, with Yoli.\n38:29 Comment: Inter, which again lost to this same Israeli team.\n38:34 Comment: Benshella flew out of the Europa River.\n38:39 Comment: But, by the way, he looked decent in the Milan derby.\n38:43 Comment: And I liked it even more than Milan.\n38:46 Comment: Although, on the other hand, Milan was closer to victory.\n38:50 Comment: Replacement for Milan.\n38:53 Comment: Lopodula leaves the field.\n38:56 Comment: The field appears at number 16 instead.\n39:1 Comment: Lopodula is one of the heroes of today's meeting.\n39:8 Comment: The author of two heads.\n39:11 Comment: Half Peruvian, by the way, reminded me of my mother.\n39:14 Comment: Peruvian.\n39:17 Comment: Well, a 26-year-old comes out instead of Lopodula.\n39:26 Comment: He goes into the field instead of Lopodula.\n39:32 Comment: 26-year-old central midfielder.\n39:37 Comment: The replacement is quite logical.\n39:49 Comment: Milan Peruvian.\n39:57 Comment: Perulen.

    "summary": "**Empoli 1 - 4 AC Milan: A Detailed Match Report**\n\nIn a thrilling encounter at the Stadio Carlo Castellani, AC Milan secured a convincing 4-1 victory over Empoli, a match that showcased the resilience and attacking prowess of the Rossoneri. Here is a comprehensive description of the match with all the important moments meticulously chronicled.\n\n**First Half:**\n\n**Early Stages:**\n\nThe match began with a lively tempo, with both teams trying to impose their game plans early on. Empoli's lineup featured Łukasz Skorupski in goal, with a backline consisting of Giuseppe Bellusci, Andrea Costa, Manuel Pasqual, and Federico Veseli. The midfield was marshaled by Rade Krunić, Assane Diousse, and Daniel Croce, while the attack was led by Riccardo Saponara, Guido Marilungo, and Massimo Maccarone. Milan, on the other hand, lined up with Gianluigi Donnarumma between the sticks, Alessio Romagnoli and Gustavo Gomez as center-backs, and Ignazio Abate and Matteo De Sciglio as full-backs. The midfield comprised of Manuel Locatelli, Mario Pašalić, Matías Fernández, with Giacomo Bonaventura, Suso, and Gianluca Lapadula spearheading the attack.\n\n**Minute-by-Minute Breakdown:**\n\nIn the sixth minute, Empoli's attack was thwarted as Maccarone's shot narrowly missed the target. Romagnoli’s errant pass back almost gifted Empoli an early goal, underlining Milan's defensive uncertainties. Despite the shaky start from Milan's defense, Donnarumma remained composed, covering his right corner reliably.\n\nEmpoli continued to threaten, dominating possession and creating several chances. Their fluid passing and quick transitions through Maccarone and Saponara kept Milan's defense alert. By the twelfth minute, Empoli had already registered six goal attempts, highlighting their offensive intent.\n\n**Mid-First Half:**\n\nMilan responded with an attack in the fifteenth minute which saw their efforts rewarded when Lapadula latched onto a Suso pass, finishing clinically to give Milan the lead (0-1). Empoli, however, was quick to respond. Just two minutes later, Riccardo Saponara capitalized on a Donnarumma error, leveling the score at 1-1 with a composed finish.\n\nDespite conceding, Empoli continued to play with confidence. They maintained a higher possession rate and frequently tested Milan's restructured defense. Their midfield trio of Krunić, Diousse, and Croce orchestrated play, while Maccarone and Saponara remained constant threats.\n\n**Later Stages of the First Half:**\n\nMilan managed to regain their composure, and their persistence paid off in the 30th minute. After a well-orchestrated attack, Suso sent a precise pass into the box which Lapadula converted, regaining Milan's lead. This period saw a more assertive Milan, driven by Bonaventura’s creativity and Suso’s trickery.\n\nIn the 35th minute, Federico Veseli’s aggressive play was evident as he tried to contain Bonaventura and Suso. Empoli's tactical fouling and cohesive defensive play disrupted Milan's rhythm temporarily, but the Rossoneri seemed unfazed.\n\nEmpoli’s attacking flair, particularly through Saponara, and their determination kept the game open, but Milan’s defensive marshals, particularly Romagnoli and Gomez, held firm. By halftime, Milan had showcased more clinical finishing despite Empoli's superior possession stats.\n\n**Half-Time:**\n\nThe first half ended with Milan leading 1-2. Both teams headed to the dressing rooms knowing the match was finely balanced, with Empoli having shown they could create opportunities against Milan's defense.\n\n**Second Half:**\n\n**Second Half Opening:**\n\nThe second half resumed with the same intensity, with Empoli aiming to overturn the deficit. They immediately pushed forward, with Maccarone looking particularly menacing. However, Milan’s defense stood firm. Empoli's pressure was relentless, and they saw several attempts go narrowly wide or get saved by Donnarumma.\n\nIn the 50th minute, another Empoli attack was stifled, reflecting Milan’s defensive adjustments. Empoli continued to produce chances, with Maccarone displaying his adeptness despite his advancing years.\n\n**Mid-Second Half:**\n\nMilan strategically utilized their flanks to launch counter-attacks, with Suso and Bonaventura prominent in pushing back Empoli’s defenders. Abate and De Sciglio’s overlapping runs caused problems for Empoli, leading to a corner in the 56th minute. \n\nIn the 64th minute, Milan extended their lead. A well-placed cross from Bonaventura caught the Empoli defense off guard, leading to an unfortunate own goal by Andrea Costa, making it 1-3.\n\n**Later Stages of the Second Half:**\n\nEmpoli continued to fight, bringing on Alberto Gilardino in the 75th minute to bolster their attack. Gilardino, a former Milan player, tried to rejuvenate Empoli’s forward line, but Milan's defense proved impenetrable.\n\nMilan, showing their attacking depth, introduced Mbaye Niang in place of Pasalic. Niang’s pace and direct play added another dimension to Milan’s attack. Empoli struggled to cope with the fresh legs of Milan’s substitutes.\n\nIn the 83rd minute, Milan further extended their lead. Lopadula, capitalizing on a quick transition, found himself at the end of a Suso pass, slotting in his second goal of the night (1-4). This effectively sealed the game for Milan, dampening any hopes of an Empoli comeback.\n\n**Closing Stages:**\n\nTowards the end of the match, Milan controlled possession, limiting Empoli's chances. Their midfield, led by Locatelli and Kucka, dictated play efficiently. Empoli, despite their best efforts, could not find a way past a well-organized Milan defense.\n\nIn the final minutes, Empoli’s frustration was evident. A yellow card for Veseli compounded their woes, as they failed to break the resolve of the Milan defense. Gilardino had a final chance in the dying moments, but Donnarumma's safe hands ensured that Milan preserved their three-goal cushion.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe match concluded with a decisive 4-1 victory for AC Milan. Despite Empoli's spirited and technically sound play, Milan’s clinical finishing and defensive organization made the difference. Suso’s ingenuity and Lopadula’s sharpness were standout elements in Milan’s play, while Donnarumma, despite a few early wobbles, remained a reassuring presence at the back.\n\nEmpoli, although showing flashes of brilliance and a commendable work rate, lacked the finishing touch to threaten Milan consistently. Their strategic ball control and quick passing were notable, but it was not enough against a more experienced and effective Milan side.\n\nUltimately, Milan’s superior tactical execution and the effective use of their bench played pivotal roles in this comprehensive away victory. The Rossoneri’s resilience and adaptability showcased why they are strong contenders in the Serie A race, whereas Empoli will need to regroup and strategize better to convert their promising gameplay into points as the season progresses."
