    "summary": "The Serie A clash between Inter Milan and AS Roma unfolded as a thrilling contest at the San Siro, marked by intense action, decisive moments, and stellar performances. AS Roma emerged victorious, securing a 3-1 win over Inter Milan, thanks to decisive strikes by Radja Nainggolan and Diego Perotti.\n\n**First Half Breakdown:**\n\nThe game kicked off at a brisk pace with AS Roma initiating proceedings immediately. The initial moments saw both teams battling vigorously to establish control. Only 28 seconds into the game, the ball was out of play, leading to a series of throw-ins by AS Roma. An early foul by AS Roma at the 1:02 mark disrupted the flow, but Inter Milan couldn't capitalize, and any imminent threat was cleared soon after by Inter's defense at 1:39.\n\nInter's aggression led to the first yellow card of the match in the fifth minute, with one of their players booked for a foul. AS Roma had their first scoring opportunity shortly after, with a shots on target event at 06:48. The attack was persistent, as another effort on goal was recorded at 7:46, showcasing their offensive intent.\n\nThe breakthrough for AS Roma came in the 11th minute. Radja Nainggolan found space on the edge of the penalty box and unleashed a stunning strike into the top right corner, leaving Inter's goalkeeper with no chance. The goal, a display of sheer quality, gave AS Roma a 1-0 lead and set the tone for what was to come.\n\nInter Milan responded promptly, trying to find an equalizer. Joao Mario tested AS Roma's goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny with a long-range strike, which was saved, resulting in a corner at the 12:31 mark. However, their effort was cleared by AS Roma’s defense. Inter continued to press forward but couldn't find a clear path to goal, with various attempts being thwarted by AS Roma’s resilient defense and occasional misplays. \n\nAS Roma's defense stood firm against multiple invasions, clearing danger effectively. A notable instance was De Rossi’s free kick at 17:23, which aimed to capitalize on Inter's defensive lapse but got cleared. The first half saw a series of fouls from both sides, reflecting the heavy nature of the contest. One such incident led to Daniele De Rossi getting booked with a yellow card in the 39:58 minute for a particularly rough challenge.\n\nInter Milan had a promising opportunity towards the end of the first half. Marcelo Brozovic unleashed a goal-bound effort from the edge of the box at 44:54, but Szczesny's sharp goalkeeping maintained AS Roma's lead. Inter's Mauro Icardi also came close, but his header went wide, summing up a challenging first half for Inter. The scoreline remained 1-0 in favor of AS Roma as the teams went into the break.\n\n**Second Half Breakdown:**\n\nThe second half began with Inter Milan showing clear intent to overturn the deficit. AS Roma committed a foul within the first minute, leading to a free-kick for Inter. However, they couldn't convert the opportunity. Inter's Antonio Candreva tested Szczesny again at 2:49 with a well-placed effort, but the goalkeeper rose to the challenge, pulling off a great save.\n\nAS Roma continued their attacking form. Radja Nainggolan capped off a fluid play with another sensational strike from medium range in the 10th minute, this time curling the ball into the top left corner. This goal, Nainggolan's second of the match, firmly placed AS Roma in command at 2-0.\n\nDespite the setback, Inter Milan did not relent. They made a substitution in the 9th minute, bringing on Eder for Marcelo Brozovic to inject fresh energy into the attack. Eder made an immediate impact, narrowly missing the target with a powerful shot in the 13th minute.\n\nInter's persistence paid off in the 35th minute when Ivan Perisic carved out an opportunity for Mauro Icardi, who tapped the ball into an empty net, reducing the deficit to 2-1. It sparked a renewed sense of optimism for the home side and their supporters.\n\nThe game intensified further, and in the 37th minute, a foul by Inter resulted in a confrontation that saw yellow cards brandished to Inter’s Jeison Murillo and Roma’s Federico Fazio. Both teams continued to battle, with AS Roma introducing Leandro Paredes as a substitute for Daniele De Rossi, in the hopes of stabilizing the midfield.\n\nInter’s Gary Medel, driven by the urgency to level the match, committed a rough challenge in the 39th minute, leading to a penalty for AS Roma. Diego Perotti stepped up confidently and converted the penalty with a precise shot into the bottom right corner, extending AS Roma’s lead to 3-1.\n\nAs the match approached its conclusion, Inter Milan fought valiantly to pull back the goals. Opportunities were created, but the execution left much to be desired. Mauro Icardi’s header from a corner at the 42:31 mark went just over the crossbar, epitomizing Inter's night of near misses.\n\nWith the clock ticking down, AS Roma opted for a defensive change, bringing on Thomas Vermaelen to replace Bruno Peres, reinforcing their backline to fend off Inter’s onslaught. Despite Inter's continuous pressing, AS Roma's defense held firm, denying any further scoring chances.\n\nIn the closing minutes, AS Roma effectively managed the game, frustrating Inter’s attackers and reducing their opportunities to mere speculative attempts. With the final whistle, the scoreboard read Inter 1 - 3 AS Roma, reflecting a match characterized by disciplined defending, clinical finishing, and some stunning individual talent, particularly from Radja Nainggolan, whose brace proved decisive.\n\nThrough meticulous planning, spirited performances, and strategic handling, AS Roma secured three valuable points on the road. For Inter Milan, it was an evening of what-ifs and missed chances, pointing towards a need for introspection and tactical reassessment. The contest was a vibrant blend of Serie A football at its competitive best, underlining the high stakes and intensity inherent in Italian top-tier matches."
