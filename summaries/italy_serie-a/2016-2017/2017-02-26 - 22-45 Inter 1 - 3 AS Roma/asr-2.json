    "input": "\n    Inter 1 - 3 AS\n\nFirst Half:\n\n0:1 Comment: Having been restored to the main lineup, let's move on to them.\n0:3 Comment: So, Kondanovic defends the Inter goal.\n0:6 Comment: In the absence of Miranda, the three central defenders, namely today, decided on three central defenders.\n0:12 Comment: We'll see though. In fact, this is what the Deosport newspaper decided.\n0:16 Comment: But we still need to let the teams get into the game.\n0:19 Comment: And then we will more accurately determine how Inter players are positioned in defense.\n0:24 Comment: Let's just go with last names and numbers for now.\n0:26 Comment: 24 Muriglio, 33 Dambrosio, 17 Medel, 77 Brozovic, 7 Kondakbia, 6 Jaomario, 5 Gallierdini, 44 Peresic, 87 Condreva, 9 Iccardi and Stefano Pioli, head coach of the Home Team.\n0:45 Comment: Roma. Roma, which significantly changed the composition in the match against Villarial, which had absolutely no meaning or meaning for Roma.\n0:55 Comment: How big she won in the first match 4-0. There, in general, it was clear that they would burn it down and not change the composition.\n1:2 Comment: And it will give most players the opportunity to relax.\n1:4 Comment: Now it's breaking the rules. One of the best players this season and the best scorer at the moment.\n1:10 Comment: Serie Dzeko broke the rules by pushing Medel, Inter's centre-back.\n1:16 Comment: Violation of the rules and Inter will take a free kick.\n1:19 Comment: So, Roma, honest in goal. Today I decided to play 4 in a line.\n1:27 Comment: Lucianu Spalete, Facio, number 20, Manova, 44.\n1:30 Comment: Probably the strongest combination of Roma central defenders in these positions at the moment.\n1:36 Comment: The player on the left has changed. Emerson, a Brazilian, sat in the reserve. Instead, another Brazilian, Joao Jesus. He has number three.\n1:44 Comment: Ruedeger, a German defender, wears number 2 on the right.\n1:47 Comment: Support zone, two brilliant players. Here it is, Barbarosa, Daniile Deirosi, number 16.\n1:53 Comment: Returned to the field. He doesn’t always make it into the starting lineup, but in such an important match, Spalete decided to find him a place on the field after all.\n2:1 Comment: Next to him is Kevin Stropman, number 6. He suffered severe injuries, recovered and, roughly speaking, is very important for Roma.\n2:9 Comment: Well, this is the attack group. Number 13 Bruno Perez, 4th Rajan Naingulan, 11th Mohamed Salah and ahead of Dzeko, number 9.\n2:21 Comment: Roma has a very powerful attack group. Now Dzeko is in the central circle, Peresic, who has returned to defense, grabs him by the T-shirt.\n2:29 Comment: Roma on the right flank, cross ball into the penalty area. Immediately, both teams set a very high pace of play.\n2:35 Comment: Dorosi passes to Naingulan. Naingulan Roma plays as if it is on its own field, and not inter on Sansiro.\n2:41 Comment: Pass Handanovic intercepts the ball. Luciano Spalete, head coach of Roma.\n2:48 Comment: Well, all that remains for me is to introduce the chief referee of today's match.\n2:58 Comment: This is Talya Ventu. As always before big Italian matches, a lot was said about refereeing in the run-up to the game.\n3:8 Comment: And in particular, Pioli recalled at a press conference that the penalty score this season is 12-2 in favor of Roma.\n3:16 Comment: Roma beat 12 times and only 2 times inter. To which Luciano Spalete already recalled at his pre-match press conference,\n3:23 Comment: that last year Roma did not take a penalty for 19 matches in a row and only in the 19th they were given the opportunity to shoot through Icardi.\n3:30 Comment: A dangerous moment, he manages to return to defense, precisely to his position. It's great to play Fazio in the selection.\n3:36 Comment: Well done, powerful, powerful defender of Roma. Now it seemed that he had lost his position a little, but Icardi did not play quickly.\n3:45 Comment: Still, the first minutes of the match, perhaps the captain had not yet really entered the game.\n3:50 Comment: This is how two Argentines now came together in single combat and the Argentinean Roma turned out to be more successful in the fight.\n3:59 Comment: Pallas's cat with the ball, back pass. Let's jump right into the game as the teams started without pause.\n4:5 Comment: Both of them play very effectively. Great series, cross it out, forget the Roma match against Villarial Home,\n4:11 Comment: because he has nothing to do with the matter at all. Roma has a great series of winning matches.\n4:17 Comment: The only result that stands out from the general series is a defeat from Sandori with a count of 2-3.\n4:23 Comment: Basically, Roma plays brightly, Roma plays effectively, scoring 4 goals to their opponents.\n4:28 Comment: Well, Inter is very, very good, especially in Inter’s home matches, taking into account the defeat in the cup match to Atlats on their own field with a score of 1-2.\n4:39 Comment: In Serie A, Inter plays great and Inter's streak of victories already totals 7 matches.\n4:48 Comment: So everything is in order in this sense and from the point of view of chances, both teams probably have approximately equal chances,\n4:55 Comment: but considering how important points are for both teams in this meeting, I think that both clubs will be focused exclusively on winning.\n5:2 Comment: Losing the ball, Derosi makes a pass to the right flank, Peresic manages to return to the crow.\n5:9 Comment: Peresic is an attacking player, but today this is how you can please the audience.\n5:15 Comment: But it seems to me that Subya is now awarding a free kick.\n5:20 Comment: Interesting, let's figure it out, a very interesting story.\n5:23 Comment: Peresic juggled and then passed the ball to the goalkeeper.\n5:27 Comment: And what happened here, because the players also didn’t really understand what happened.\n5:32 Comment: Let's watch. Peresic juggled, headed the ball to the goalkeeper, but what happened?\n5:44 Comment: He suggested something. Do you know what happened, I think?\n5:47 Comment: It seems to me that the referee, who is behind the goal, discovered that he had left the field, left the boundaries.\n5:55 Comment: This is the only way I can explain it. Inter goalkeeper Handanovic left the field and returned without the referee's permission.\n6:3 Comment: Peresic clearly didn’t break the rules for him. It seems to me that this is the only explanation that can be found.\n6:9 Comment: Inter players also did not understand what happened.\n6:11 Comment: But one way or another, a free kick was awarded, the referee raised his hand.\n6:17 Comment: And therefore, a free kick will now be awarded from outside the penalty area.\n6:22 Comment: It’s clear to everyone that it’s impossible to shoot from here.\n6:33 Comment: Derosi at the ball. Roma won by penetrating about a meter into the penalty area.\n6:40 Comment: But in fact, it is a more or less ordinary free kick, no more dangerous than if the ball were outside the penalty area.\n6:47 Comment: However, there may be a moment. Derosi serve Salah. Returns the ball to the penalty area.\n6:51 Comment: Another strike from Salah. The ball gets stuck in the crowd of players. Roma is good at rebounding on Endulan.\n6:57 Comment: Looks to whom he can pass the ball. The transfer fails. Salah in one touch.\n7:1 Comment: Still, Roma still has the ball. Very active fight for the ball. Kandagbiya wins.\n7:7 Comment: Jack immediately starts this fight. And both teams act in such a very aggressive manner.\n7:14 Comment: At the beginning of the match, without conceding, trying at least not to concede any part of the field.\n7:19 Comment: Inter decided to defuse the situation a little with a long pass, sending the ball forward.\n7:23 Comment: Immediately Roma sends this ball in turn to the other half of the field.\n7:27 Comment: And pressure. Notice how Roma immediately put the pressure on, denying one of the most talented Italian players in Serie A.\n7:35 Comment: Gallierdini. We, everyone who loves Italian football, already miss Italian talent.\n7:42 Comment: But Gallierdini is one of them. Loses the filling. Jack's great. Salah, left foot. Dangerous moment.\n7:48 Comment: Handanovic helps his team out. Salah immediately shot into touch. Roma Derosi's attack continues.\n7:53 Comment: Pass to Jack. Jack has a big advantage from Roma.\n7:57 Comment: Isn't it a little unexpected that in the first 7-8 minutes Roma took possession of the ball and gained territory.\n8:3 Comment: Well, the fact that the territorial advantage, maybe Roma’s team likes to play ball control, is probably not so unexpected.\n8:10 Comment: But the fact that Inter still cannot move to the other half of the field within a few minutes, playing at home with such support from the fans, is somewhat strange.\n8:21 Comment: Another long pass forward. The Roma player made a mistake. I didn’t see that none of my people were there.\n8:27 Comment: And Medel, one of the leaders of Inter, is a player of below average height, less than 170 centimeters tall.\n8:36 Comment: And yet he plays as a central defender.\n8:39 Comment: But we remember how magnificently and brilliantly he played in the Chilean national team, including at the World Cup as a central defender.\n8:47 Comment: Because the main central defenders of the current Sevilla coach Sao Pauli were injured.\n8:53 Comment: And he played Medel at centre-back, to the surprise of many.\n8:57 Comment: And Medel played great, coping with his excellent reading of the game.\n9:2 Comment: Therefore, do not be surprised that we will have such a funny martial arts over and over again today.\n9:9 Comment: Medel Dzeko practically presses his head into his stomach.\n9:13 Comment: But, it seems to me, this does not bother him at all and did not bother Pieli when he lined up the players in the center of defense without Miranda.\n9:21 Comment: It was still necessary to make a decision on how he would place the players in the center of defense.\n9:25 Comment: Unfortunately, when you watch a match on TV, you don’t always see everything that happens on the field.\n9:32 Comment: And I still can’t tell you whether Inter plays with three central players or two central players.\n9:39 Comment: Medel is next to him, Dambrosi. No, I think they play at three.\n9:42 Comment: Peresic is covering the left flank, as is now becoming more obvious.\n9:48 Comment: Kandreva on the right, yes, there are three players in the center.\n9:52 Comment: Dambrosi 33, Medel 17 and Murillo 24 are located to the right of it.\n9:57 Comment: So, given the performance of Roma, the fact that the Roman team is playing absolutely superbly this season.\n10:3 Comment: Dzeko has 19 goals and has only two strikers in Serie A over the last 50 years.\n10:10 Comment: Luca Toni and Goncalo Higuain managed to score more than 30 goals in the championship last year.\n10:16 Comment: Jack already has 19, so we decided to play more carefully and more compactly in defense.\n10:25 Comment: Milanese in this match. Candreva, who knows what Roma is, how to tune in to Roma, is a former Lazio player.\n10:32 Comment: But the same goes for Stefano Pioli, who knows what the Roman derby is.\n10:37 Comment: And, of course, he didn’t specifically need any additional motivation today.\n10:42 Comment: Everything is clear about Pioli’s motivation. A variety of names are named around the position of Inter's head coach.\n10:50 Comment: But so far, in fact, there are no concrete conversations.\n10:53 Comment: I think that if Pioli gives a good finish and takes Inter to the Champions League, he has every chance.\n10:59 Comment: Despite the fact that the club’s budget and current funding allows Inter, I think, to get almost any coach, from the point of view of salary.\n11:11 Comment: But Pioli has a chance, so he has something to fight for and something to prove.\n11:15 Comment: Nayangullan with the ball can shoot. Nayangullan! Brilliant goal from Raja! Raja Nayangullan! 1-0!\n11:23 Comment: 1-0! The brilliant Nayangullan opens the scoring in this match!\n11:27 Comment: How can Inter act so inattentively? You and I know very well how Nayangullan can hit.\n11:34 Comment: He has a superbly executed shot, both direct and dribbling, but now no one has really met Nayangullan.\n11:41 Comment: The Milanese played the combination very easily now. Notice how huge the distance is between the Inter player who met and very easily beat Gallierdini, the youngest player in the Nayangullane rivals.\n11:57 Comment: Inter threw the ball to the right, no one ran up to back up Gallierdini, and as a result, this was a stunning start to the match. One goal has already been scored, the answer is right there!\n12:9 Comment: Inter were on the attack and the ball goes into the top goal of Joe Mario. Starting from the center of the field, Inter immediately threw the ball to the flank. Here Roma was still happy and celebrating, but did not have time to properly get involved in the game.\n12:21 Comment: I made a serious mistake and failed to handle the ball properly. In my opinion, it was Bruno Perez who made a mistake, and Inter is already attacking and taking a corner. An amazing start to this match, and I think the rest will be no less interesting and no less intense.\n12:51 Comment: And only 13 minutes have been played, we already have a goal, and even what Rajan Nayangullan, who has become a real star of Italian football at least, but I think that outside of Italy they have become very familiar with this player. I never tire of being amazed at his progress, this is certainly a merit; of course, Luciano Spalletti discovered him, because when Naiangullan moved from Callieri 4 years ago, in general, he was hired as a replacement player.\n13:20 Comment: No one could imagine that Nayangullan would at some point turn out to be almost the leader of the team, but in fact this was the case for some time. Stratman makes a forward pass.\n13:30 Comment: Bruno Perez returns the ball back, Salah, a shock for Inter, this is the start of the match, getting a goal in the 12th minute, but it seems to me that the Milanese are to blame, they very easily allowed Roma to get closer to their goal and an absolutely stunning shot, but not a surprise , that’s the whole point, if Salah had ended up with the ball, I don’t know, he shot with his right foot like that, and the Inter player specifically seemed to emphasize his position.\n14:0 Comment: In his defensive game, Salah could have played on his left kicking leg, and he would have charged on the right like this, as you remember, sometimes Hulk scored as part of Zenit when he played, and all the wonders were given, he has a kicking left leg, and How can he charge like that on the right, and several times he punished his opponents like that.\n14:16 Comment: But it was Nayengulan, right-handed, Nayengulan, who, if he shoots and the ball flies, it’s usually a beautiful goal, but Alfie Nayengulan with the ball, but this time Jack broke the rules against Murillo.\n14:30 Comment: What should Inter do now? Inter needs to move the game away from their goal to the opponent's half of the field, because so far they have not been able to catch the ball in the opponent's half. 37% to 63% advantage for Roma at the moment, and a wonderful indicator that my colleagues and I draw your attention to, which is given by the Dow-Sport newspaper.\n14:48 Comment: Territorial advantage, that is, how much of this percentage of ball possession Roma spent in the opposing half of the field. Roma has 43% of the ball possession out of these 63% in Inter's half. Inter has only 14% of 37%.\n15:4 Comment: Therefore, even if you watch this match in fits and starts, although in vain, because at first the game is simply truly impressive and exciting, it is already clear from these numbers that Inter cannot manage to establish a game in the opponent’s half of the field, and at least once something try to play in a positional attack.\n15:23 Comment: Kondrevo, transmission, and for some reason Kondrevo did not open. A very strong pass flew towards him, this pass was passed by Gallierdini, who will now try especially hard to correct his mistake.\n15:40 Comment: But when such a blow is achieved, as Naingulan is doing now, I think that it is impossible to make any claims against Honda either. The player with the fourth number, Raja Naingulan, played so magnificently.\n15:56 Comment: He had a very difficult fate, despite everything, he really overcame great difficulties in his life, but he grew up without a father, he lost his mother several years ago. He has a huge tattoo on his back, just in memory of his mother, who did everything for him to become a professional athlete, and not end up somewhere in not so distant places.\n16:23 Comment: The sweetest thing in the history of the Naingulan family is that he has a sister who also plays football and some time ago played for the Roma women's team. Naingulan has grown up very well. As far as I remember, several years ago one of the Russian clubs was interested in Naingulan. It seems to me that they made a huge mistake, that maybe it didn’t work out there, because then Naingulan, when he played in Cali, was worth some money quite affordable.\n16:53 Comment: They are crazy as they are now. Only 28 years old. In modern football this is not age at all. He started out as a defensive midfielder, Rajan Naingulan, and now in flight he came up with a more attacking position for him. And Rajan Naingulan has a very decent performance. The eighth ball of the season works just great.\n17:17 Comment: Roma earns a free kick. 17 minutes flew by. Daniil Derose with the ball. It seems to me that Inter can’t improve the game so far. The presentation is soft, good presentation. Guilherdini sends the ball for a corner.\n17:31 Comment: I was looking for the optimal combination of players. The play of today's match was based on this choice of players in the center of midfield. Guilherdini is not supplying balls yet. The attack group falls out a little to Zhao Mario.\n17:53 Comment: There are some questions. Brozovic's position and why he was brought straight into the starting lineup after being injured for some time. Roma Derose takes the corner. The ball did not reach the 11 meter mark. Naingulan plays well on the rebound and sends the ball to Bruno Perez, who eventually disappeared back.\n18:17 Comment: Transfers are also important for Roma, because there were questions about the main goalkeeper. Roma still couldn’t decide who the main goalkeeper was for him. But in the person of this Polish goalkeeper they finally found the belts, I mean stability.\n18:29 Comment: Again we lost the ball and Roma tried to attack. Inter now had a gap between the lines, but a long pass went towards Salah and now Brozov has dealt with this pass there. Peresic, who is forced to move back quite deeply, so that when building 3-5, 2, it doesn’t matter 3-5-1-1, these are already nuances. But the fact that Peresic is responsible for the entire left side of Inter is obvious. And while he doesn't have time to run forward, he has a lot of work to do defensively.\n18:57 Comment: Guilherdini, a 22-year-old Inter midfielder, turns out to be almost a key figure in his team, an all too obvious transfer. He saw Joa Mario, who was opening up deep in the penalty area, but Derosi also knew what was happening on the field and easily intercepted the pass.\n19:13 Comment: The delivery is very calm, Fazio knocks the ball out of the penalty area, Derosi takes one touch to Engolaan and then passes forward. It may be a little not exactly what they say in the direction, but it’s fast.\n19:27 Comment: Roma tries not to hold the ball in the middle of the field and sends it with lightning speed as quickly as possible, and not just with blind shots, but with a directed, targeted pass.\n19:38 Comment: Joan Jesus throws the ball behind the sideline. Major news for Roma fans and for the city of Rome. But a little later, after Engolaan loses the ball, just during this pause, I will tell you about the most important news.\n19:52 Comment: Yesterday this news thundered not only throughout Italy, but throughout the whole world. Roma finally agreed with the city administration on the construction of a new stadium.\n20:6 Comment: And this construction, that’s where the leaders of Roma were, in so many people, and in one second I won’t have time to list all the names for you, the leaders of Inter, especially since there are a lot of them left now.\n20:19 Comment: With the ball from Roma, Dzeko passed forward, Salah throws the ball away in one touch, and Dzeko, too, but Inter intercepted the pass.\n20:27 Comment: The mayor of Rome, this lady, by the way, said that after 36 hours of negotiations, they lasted practically a day and a half, in general, the parties came to a certain agreement.\n20:41 Comment: Dzeko, with the ball, tried to handle the ball for himself, but the Roma center forward failed to handle the ball properly.\n20:49 Comment: Pereshich plays more or less on the break and Cardi hasn’t received the ball for a long, long time, 20 minutes played, 1-0, Roma is ahead, continues to have the ball, and Manolas took the advantage of the game, dragging the penalty area.\n21:0 Comment: This is a central defender, like that of Roma, great now, Manolas played very bravely, and he was just a little short of making an accurate pass forward.\n21:11 Comment: For Stefan Piel, perhaps, well, I would say, one of, and maybe even the most important match so far in his career, because quite by chance he found himself at the head of a big club with a brilliant history, with traditions, a two-time winner of the Inter Champions Cup .\n21:30 Comment: New owners, new serious ambitions, very serious money, and he needs to prove that he is capable of working with expensive players, capable of managing a team that is under pressure, from which it demands victory in every match, which is attended by 80 thousand fans.\n21:49 Comment: Today San Siro is almost filled to capacity.\n21:51 Comment: What will Roma's stadium be like? There are still questions.\n21:55 Comment: The final point, as I read the Italian press today, has not yet been reached, but 99 percent of the issue has been resolved.\n22:3 Comment: Moreover, James Polotto, the president of Roma, said that by 2020, Roma might already have their new stadium.\n22:11 Comment: It will be located, of course, far from the center, in the very, very south-eastern part of the city, closer to the Rome ring road, but still for the club, of course, it will be an absolutely fantastic event.\n22:25 Comment: Few people in Italy, which is going through very difficult economic times, have the opportunity to invest in the construction of a stadium.\n22:33 Comment: So Juvenus built and, perhaps, will become the champion for the sixth time in a row, and largely thanks to its stadium.\n22:40 Comment: Medal with the ball is pressed by Nine Gulan, then passes to Kondreva.\n22:44 Comment: He immediately grabbed onto Kondreva, without violating the rules, Joao Jesus took it away, and how he reads the game now, and maybe, to some extent, Murile was lucky that he intercepted the ball.\n22:53 Comment: But there is quite a lot of fuss at Inter at the exit from their penalty area, and Kondreva decided to just play for the break, while Inter is absolutely unable to organize the game,\n23:3 Comment: and take the ball at least for a certain number of seconds, make at least a few accurate passes in order to somehow feel a little bit more confident in your abilities.\n23:11 Comment: So far, little has been achieved for the Piel team.\n23:16 Comment: Brozovic with the ball, pass to the left, Juamario, Peresic opens on the left.\n23:21 Comment: Peresic performed the maneuver, but Bruno Perez very carefully followed Horvat’s movements, covered him, and the pass was made forward.\n23:30 Comment: It makes no sense, the ball would have been lost to Inter.\n23:35 Comment: Roma Strotman will throw out and returns the ball to Perez.\n23:42 Comment: All the time, some interesting Brazilians appear in Roma's full-back positions.\n23:48 Comment: Quite a large number of people went through this position, but ultimately Luciano Spalletti seemed to settle on the combination of players that suited him.\n23:59 Comment: Spalletti was naturally asked at a press conference yesterday what he thought about his future at Roma, given that the club is building a new stadium.\n24:8 Comment: And doesn’t Spalletti immediately think about resolving the issues of extending the contract with the club in order to usher in a new era in the life of the club with a new stadium, to which Spalletti joked so sarcastically, saying, well, how do I know if I’ll be alive in five years? what kind of contract can we talk about now?\n24:29 Comment: But you and I know Luciano very well; he worked in Russia for many years, and we also know his sense of humor well.\n24:37 Comment: The teams took a break, and by the 25th minute the first minutes of the match were very active, during which the handsome man scored several more fairly quick attacks from both sides.\n24:52 Comment: But for now, we mostly celebrate Roma’s performance.\n24:56 Comment: Inter slightly equalizes the percentage of ball possession at 42 to 58, but Roma still has a huge advantage in the territory that Roma owns.\n25:7 Comment: Roma spends 50% of their possession with him in the Inter half.\n25:13 Comment: Pass to Naldulan, no luck today, it probably happened that way, but very often Billierdini ends up next to Naldulan, although according to the formations he seems to be responsible for the right zone.\n25:26 Comment: But Naldulana plays virtually out of position, moves across the entire width of the field, and Billierdini runs after him all the time, and it seems to me that by this minute the Belgian is inferior.\n25:39 Comment: Again Inter loses the ball, Manolas returns to his regular area, honest Icardi claims the Roma goalkeeper, long pass to the right, Ruedeger stops the ball very skillfully, but he has nowhere to play forward, so under the pressure of Jao Mario Ruedeger makes a mistake.\n25:56 Comment: Peresic asks his team to open up forward; this is Inter's Ever striker, who by and large did not live up to expectations.\n26:4 Comment: Mancini was still counting on him as the main striking force, Mancini, by the way, is called one of the possible successors in Raniere, in Leicester, Raniere, and his resignation is of course a separate story, but let's talk about that another time, because Italy simply reared up from exhaustion , standing up on various social networks and newspapers for the coach that Saint-Sigvana made Leicester champions last year.\n26:32 Comment: Stropman lost the ball, fell in the owls, looks at the referee, the referee doesn’t blow the whistle to Jack, so Medelya tries to go to the right, Medel grabbed onto Jack like pincers, and so Medel’s grant burns.\n26:43 Comment: An absolutely brilliant football player, a classic defensive midfielder, in football jargon the style of play, such a football player is called a dog that literally grabs your ankle and won’t let go, now Medel showed how, by pressing without touching the opponent’s ball at all, you can force him to make a mistake on the owl, there is no position out of play, an owl on his right, which of course is more convenient for him to walk than to play football, now he made it, well, most likely it was a pass, probably forward it seems so to me.\n27:13 Comment: And it was Dambrosio who held the ball and once again we watch how Medel pushes Jack away with his hands, tenaciously marks out, and what is here, and here the carder was going to someone else’s goal, Manolas, also a very successful acquisition of Roma, a push in the back.\n27:28 Comment: And today, by the way, very interesting information appeared that the sports director of Valencia Ramon Rodriguez Verdeco, simply Monchi as they call him, in Italian lato, I don’t know how to read it in Spanish, may come to the Roma club, but that’s not the point, but the point is that...\n27:54 Comment: Yes, from Sevili Monchi, I was absolutely right, so they say that he has a reputation as one of the best specialists, within a small budget, to form a good team, find interesting players, it is quite possible that this same Monchi, although having arrived in Italy will immediately become Monchi, according to the reading rules, he will quite possibly end up in Roma and will be responsible for transfers.\n28:22 Comment: And Italian observers believe that this will be a very strong move for the club if they manage to lure sports director Sevili.\n28:31 Comment: 29 minutes, meanwhile, our game withered a little, because Roma scored their goal, Roma does not refuse the chosen game plan, and Ildar still cannot offer anything in return, because it was clear that the calculation would be to make the home match, first of all for some emotions, for the support of the stands, but it seems to me that Roma was brilliantly prepared, and was not at all ashamed of this in this crowded stadium.\n29:2 Comment: And she herself managed to cut her opponent into her hand at the beginning of the match. Derosi quite possibly received it from Pereshchit, by accident, but there was a single combat, and Pereshchit immediately went to apologize.\n29:15 Comment: There was a lot of contact play, but it simply couldn’t have been any other way in a match like this.\n29:21 Comment: All is well with Derosi and the game resumes.\n29:24 Comment: Inter with the ball resumed, and immediately Lucian from the air was shown with gestures: press, press, cover all the players who are with the ball and who could potentially receive a pass.\n29:39 Comment: Of the inter players who are close to the player in possession of the ball.\n29:44 Comment: So far nothing is working out for Maura Icardi.\n29:48 Comment: He played effectively at the beginning of the season and also scored very well.\n29:54 Comment: Now Roma lost the ball, passed to Pereshchit.\n29:57 Comment: Well, no, here oh-oh-oh, you can’t play like that, because this way you can injure the goalkeeper, even if he didn’t fix the ball.\n30:3 Comment: The Portuguese's desire to play until the end is understandable.\n30:7 Comment: Dalia Ventova shows that doctors can go onto the field and provide assistance.\n30:13 Comment: The goalkeeper, by the way, brought this attack to Derosi, and Facio made the allowance.\n30:18 Comment: Well, yes, he recorded the ball fairly, and I think that Joamariu should be punished with a yellow card.\n30:23 Comment: Although from this repetition and twist it seems that it was...\n30:26 Comment: Well, yes, most likely Joamario did not play the ball, but honestly flew into Joamari’s knee with the ball.\n30:33 Comment: Let's take a look at this replay.\n30:35 Comment: He stretches his leg... No, no, no, that’s it, everything is clear.\n30:38 Comment: This is an accidental collision, Joamariu is not to blame, he tried to avoid the collision, and, thank God, he didn’t even get hit on the head.\n30:44 Comment: Honestly, honestly, in this case it was lucky that it all ended like this.\n30:50 Comment: I think that he escaped with a slight scare and will calmly continue this match.\n30:54 Comment: There should be no complaints against Joamariu, and I wonder what Dalia Vent thinks about this.\n30:58 Comment: He has an assistant behind the gate who should tell him what is there...\n31:5 Comment: Well, this is Francesco Totti, who played the match against Villarial.\n31:12 Comment: His relationship with Ispolite is a separate book.\n31:15 Comment: We'll write it another time so as not to be distracted from...\n31:19 Comment: ...very important for the tournament fight at the top of the Italian matches table.\n31:27 Comment: Derosi passes to the right.\n31:35 Comment: Bruno Perez is even deeper on the flank.\n31:39 Comment: Salah accelerates down the right flank, made...\n31:41 Comment: ...pause, because it’s more convenient for him to make such a pass from the left.\n31:45 Comment: Perez seemed to play along with his hand.\n31:47 Comment: No, but Dmitry is still interesting.\n31:49 Comment: He played with his hands and hands.\n31:51 Comment: What happened?\n31:53 Comment: Now then, if Medel played with his hand before the whistle, the penalty will be towards Inter.\n31:58 Comment: No, Aliya Vent did not punish.\n32:0 Comment: Interesting story.\n32:2 Comment: That's a fall, right?\n32:4 Comment: But there is no whistle, and look what Medel does.\n32:6 Comment: He plays with a straight leg, and then he grabbed the ball with his hands.\n32:8 Comment: Therefore, it will squeeze the audience out a little about what is happening.\n32:10 Comment: But Aliya Vent did not punish the Chilean and gave a free kick, as he should have given for handball against the Roma footballer at first.\n32:19 Comment: But before the whistle, Medel began to prepare himself for the penalty kick.\n32:28 Comment: Hurry up.\n32:31 Comment: Now some other referee could have given a penalty to Inter.\n32:35 Comment: 33 minutes, still 0-1, and so far nothing is going ahead for Inter at this point.\n32:51 Comment: Inter have zero shots on target this minute.\n32:56 Comment: But, at least, Inter’s play from its own goal is improving a little bit.\n32:59 Comment: Roma, remember, I said a few minutes ago, Roma has 50% of the ball in the opposing half of the field.\n33:8 Comment: Now it’s already 36, but this doesn’t make it any easier for Inter, because Inter can’t increase its number in any way.\n33:15 Comment: It remains in the region of 20%.\n33:19 Comment: That is, less than 1.5 playing time, when Inter has the ball, it is not in the opponent’s half of the field.\n33:25 Comment: Therefore, there are no sharp approaches to the goal, no honest and no dangerous moments.\n33:30 Comment: Jack with the ball is placed on the body, two opponents are fighting against him.\n33:44 Comment: Out throws and takes his time Vadim The ball is in play for Juan Jesus.\n33:50 Comment: He threw it in the direction, but not to the side.\n33:53 Comment: Threw in the direction of Stropman, Stropman was not very ready for this pass.\n33:58 Comment: Hondanovic returns the ball to Andreev and fights with Juan Jesus.\n34:3 Comment: Juan Jesus jumped out dangerously at Stropman.\n34:6 Comment: And here Jesus trampled his opponent.\n34:10 Comment: A little over 10 minutes before the break.\n34:18 Comment: We didn't see what happened.\n34:20 Comment: Now let's see what happened.\n34:23 Comment: Andreeva hit Jesus, who was standing in front of the ball.\n34:27 Comment: And he got kicked out by the judge.\n34:32 Comment: Medal. A long pass, as they say, in the direction.\n34:37 Comment: So far, Inter's flank play is not working at all.\n34:41 Comment: Peresic, who can play well on the wing.\n34:44 Comment: And Andreev is also a good flank player.\n34:46 Comment: Neither one nor the other can show themselves yet.\n34:48 Comment: Naimdulan is immediately next to him again.\n34:51 Comment: As if glued to him, Galliardini runs after him all over the field.\n34:56 Comment: But so far without much result.\n34:58 Comment: But Galliardini himself is not bad.\n35:0 Comment: Now Naimdulan made a tackle with a foul.\n35:3 Comment: But the referee doesn’t show his ass card.\n35:5 Comment: Galliardini quickly on Juana Kendekbian.\n35:10 Comment: Kendekbian did not take risks.\n35:13 Comment: Unlike their comrades, who simply kicked the ball forward somewhere into the free zone.\n35:18 Comment: Theoretically free.\n35:20 Comment: If she had been free, then something of her own would probably have started there.\n35:24 Comment: Played back to save the ball.\n35:27 Comment: And gesture is also a Galliardini concept.\n35:30 Comment: He asked Icardi to make a movement towards the ball.\n35:34 Comment: But Icardi started to move after the ball was lost.\n35:38 Comment: Strotman. Pass to Dzeko.\n35:40 Comment: Jacko. The ball is under the left kick.\n35:42 Comment: Handanovic helps his team out.\n35:45 Comment: Roma enters the penalty position very easily.\n35:48 Comment: Into the Inter penalty area.\n35:50 Comment: And it hits with a turn.\n35:52 Comment: Now it's Jacko.\n35:55 Comment: Murillo is against him.\n35:57 Comment: And from the left to the far one. Great shot from Dzeko.\n36:0 Comment: Handanovic played brilliantly.\n36:3 Comment: Okay Roma.\n36:7 Comment: 37th minute. The corner is taken by the Ruciano-Spalletti team.\n36:12 Comment: Savah. Ball.\n36:14 Comment: Innings.\n36:15 Comment: Yes, Rüdeger's ball missed the target.\n36:17 Comment: Icardi worked in defense.\n36:19 Comment: Who's first here?\n36:21 Comment: Peresterone.\n36:23 Comment: What's going on in Inter's defense?\n36:25 Comment: They came out after the ball was cleared from their own penalty area.\n36:28 Comment: All but two people and four Roma players found themselves against two.\n36:32 Comment: If only the ball's indentation had been a little better now,\n36:35 Comment: then it would be a scoring situation.\n36:37 Comment: But Inter is attacking. Joamario.\n36:39 Comment: No, he’s taking a break because he hasn’t found an interesting continuation ahead.\n36:42 Comment: Passed over. Fazio failed to throw the ball over the almost two-meter height.\n36:46 Comment: Konagbia.\n36:48 Comment: Manolas. Shorter than Facio.\n36:50 Comment: But this Greek jumps out very cool.\n36:52 Comment: He is generally a very high-quality defender.\n36:55 Comment: English clubs were interested in Manolas in the off-season.\n36:59 Comment: And in the summer they wrote about Manolas’ transfer to one of the English clubs as a fait accompli.\n37:6 Comment: But no, Roma kept the player.\n37:8 Comment: And this is also an achievement.\n37:10 Comment: We are working.\n37:12 Comment: Club.\n37:14 Comment: Because the trend is now completely obvious.\n37:17 Comment: The best players go to England, where they offer better conditions.\n37:20 Comment: But Manolas did not leave, he remained in Roma.\n37:22 Comment: And, of course, this is a football player at a very serious level.\n37:25 Comment: Quite young by Italian standards.\n37:27 Comment: For a defender, 25 years old in Italy, where they play until they are 40.\n37:31 Comment: Well, at least the defenders used to play.\n37:34 Comment: There's the same Costocurto, Boresi, Maldini.\n37:37 Comment: This is all this generation.\n37:42 Comment: Very good Manolas, good Fazio.\n37:45 Comment: Kondreva failed to make a pass through them towards Icardi.\n37:49 Comment: Naenguang did a great job with the ball.\n37:52 Comment: Here, for my taste, is the ideal midfielder Naenguang.\n37:55 Comment: He simply has no weak points.\n37:57 Comment: He can take away, he can put pressure on.\n38:0 Comment: The amount of work is crazy, the impact is crazy.\n38:2 Comment: He can play a pass and also beat him.\n38:5 Comment: And it was Hendekbiar who entered the penalty area.\n38:8 Comment: Icardi didn’t find anything more interesting than a pass to Kondrev.\n38:12 Comment: Judge!\n38:15 Comment: The stadium screamed, apparently much louder.\n38:19 Comment: And not in one, but in 80 thousand sips.\n38:21 Comment: But we need a replay.\n38:23 Comment: While Salag is with the ball.\n38:25 Comment: The situation was very difficult.\n38:27 Comment: The ball was kind of neutral.\n38:29 Comment: Four legs rushed there at once.\n38:32 Comment: Two Icardi and two defenders who was with them.\n38:36 Comment: But in such situations we always pay attention to the fact that\n38:39 Comment: whether the player attacking the team who was allegedly fouled is arguing.\n38:42 Comment: Please note, no protests.\n38:44 Comment: Nobody flies to the judge.\n38:46 Comment: The stadium is naturally indignant, because they mostly support the home team.\n38:50 Comment: Although there are Roma fans in the right stand who came for this trip.\n38:56 Comment: But let's still wait for the replay in order to figure out what happened in this episode.\n39:0 Comment: Strotman with the ball, pass to the right.\n39:3 Comment: Bruno Perez.\n39:5 Comment: Strotman gestured where he could make the pass.\n39:8 Comment: But he also took the player away from the central zone.\n39:10 Comment: Due to this transmission through the center.\n39:12 Comment: And who will meet Perez?\n39:14 Comment: Maybe he will beat someone else?\n39:16 Comment: No, Perez beat everyone except Medel, and the Brazilian did not dare to shoot.\n39:20 Comment: Although the ball seemed to be rolling well and was under my foot.\n39:23 Comment: But Perez decided to go even further.\n39:25 Comment: Kondreva, soft, long transmission.\n39:27 Comment: But no, what is he counting on?\n39:29 Comment: The fact that between Facio and Manolus he will bring Cardi one on one?\n39:32 Comment: It is unlikely.\n39:34 Comment: And again Nayangulan.\n39:36 Comment: We just saw about 50 meters ago he was practicing defense.\n39:38 Comment: Now I’m practically in the position of almost a central striker.\n39:45 Comment: Strotno.\n39:48 Comment: Salah, Murilho easily knocked the ball out from under Salah's feet.\n39:52 Comment: And then Dorosi met the young Italian Gallierdini.\n39:56 Comment: Recalling what Serie A is.\n39:58 Comment: This is basically a fall on a yellow card.\n40:1 Comment: And Dorosya gets a completely fair mustard plaster.\n40:4 Comment: It seems to me that there was no point in such aggression on the part of Daniel Dorosi.\n40:8 Comment: In this episode at the 40th minute of the first half.\n40:13 Comment: Well, it turns out that this is how Inter’s game is structured today,\n40:16 Comment: that Gallierdini turns out to be almost a key player in the middle.\n40:20 Comment: It seems to me that he is still too young to play in such an important match.\n40:25 Comment: be a key figure for your team.\n40:30 Comment: Brozovic was completely lost.\n40:32 Comment: Fazio never received the ball from the folk.\n40:35 Comment: I found out what I was doing.\n40:36 Comment: He deliberately put his head under the ball like that,\n40:39 Comment: so that he doesn't fly somewhere far away,\n40:42 Comment: and so that Manolo could do something further in the free space with this ball.\n40:47 Comment: But in the end this ball ended up with Inter.\n40:49 Comment: Kondreva looks to see where Icardi is.\n40:51 Comment: Prepares Kondrev for weight.\n40:53 Comment: Serve, good serve.\n40:55 Comment: And Rüdeger receives gratitude from Honest for\n40:59 Comment: which played great in this game situation.\n41:2 Comment: This, brothers, is not to look at the ball, this is how the fight went.\n41:3 Comment: How Icardi was noticed at the moment of the pass.\n41:6 Comment: He dove behind Rüdeger.\n41:8 Comment: But Rüdeger is not a failure, he managed to emerge in a very difficult situation\n41:11 Comment: and knock the ball onto your head.\n41:13 Comment: Icardi serve.\n41:15 Comment: Kick towards the goal.\n41:17 Comment: The ball didn't hit the target.\n41:19 Comment: Inter still cannot manage to organize a goal on target.\n41:22 Comment: But finally they show us what happened here.\n41:25 Comment: Well, yes, here it was just Fazio who was first on the ball.\n41:28 Comment: And if anyone broke the rules, it was probably Icardi,\n41:30 Comment: who hit his compatriot on the heel.\n41:37 Comment: There was not even close to any violation of the rules on the part of the Roma defender.\n41:42 Comment: So the judges sorted it out in this case.\n41:45 Comment: No questions. The game moves on.\n41:47 Comment: 42nd minute. Gandagbyat.\n41:49 Comment: Long pass. Peresic runs as fast as he can.\n41:52 Comment: Peresic gets the ball in time.\n41:54 Comment: But Rüdeger also runs very briskly next to Horvath.\n41:57 Comment: The game with Horvat is still not going well for both the Inter team as a whole and individual players.\n42:6 Comment: Whatever happened in the last minutes of this half,\n42:9 Comment: Let's agree with you that, overall, this is a half for Roma.\n42:14 Comment: Luciano Spalletti's team showed very high quality football.\n42:18 Comment: They are 10 points behind Juventus.\n42:21 Comment: which is heading for a record sixth straight championship.\n42:25 Comment: Not a single team in the entire history of the Ani series has won six championships in a row.\n42:29 Comment: Salah received a pass from Naingulan.\n42:31 Comment: It’s great for Dzeko how quickly Roma comes out of defense.\n42:34 Comment: How reasonable all the transfers are in the right direction.\n42:37 Comment: But if they were still accurate, then they would not be people, but robots.\n42:41 Comment: Therefore, naturally, some errors occur.\n42:44 Comment: At such a speed of impeccable passing, and such long passes.\n42:48 Comment: As it has been done now, it is simply impossible to agree to do it.\n42:55 Comment: Something needs to be invented in the piela.\n42:57 Comment: There is a good reserve at the break.\n43:0 Comment: First, there is Bonega.\n43:2 Comment: A very smart midfielder.\n43:5 Comment: And this, of course, is the question of why Bonega remained in reserve today.\n43:9 Comment: A player who is capable of leading the team's game\n43:14 Comment: who are able to drink and play.\n43:16 Comment: The game of a team that is able to pass, shoot, and come up with something.\n43:22 Comment: But today I chose players in the piel who are good at tackling,\n43:26 Comment: who work great on the field.\n43:29 Comment: Same Brozovic, first of all.\n43:31 Comment: But with the organization of attacking actions,\n43:34 Comment: It seems to me that it is a little worse than Bonega’s.\n43:37 Comment: And this is Stropman.\n43:39 Comment: Next to him is Dzeko.\n43:41 Comment: And he picks up speed and gets the ball.\n43:43 Comment: But Stropman made a not very good pass on the changeover.\n43:46 Comment: Mini-pass with this one.\n43:48 Comment: Murilho made a mistake Dzeko.\n43:50 Comment: Salah shoots the rebound for the engulant.\n43:53 Comment: But there was already a ball going out from under itself.\n43:56 Comment: He hit the engulant, and it was difficult for him to shoot more accurately.\n43:59 Comment: But an accident with Muril.\n44:2 Comment: He did not calculate the rebound from the lawn.\n44:4 Comment: And Inter is just lucky now,\n44:6 Comment: that this attack did not end in big trouble,\n44:11 Comment: than just a kick-turn.\n44:13 Comment: Second ball.\n44:15 Comment: I think that's why Salah reacts desperately to\n44:20 Comment: that the attack did not end, the goal was scored.\n44:22 Comment: I think the second goal would have given Inter another 2-0,\n44:26 Comment: especially with the performance that Inter is showing today,\n44:28 Comment: at an extreme disadvantage.\n44:34 Comment: Well, who besides Bonega?\n44:36 Comment: Byabiani, Palacio.\n44:38 Comment: There are people who can bring something new.\n44:42 Comment: Well, Gabi Gol, Gabriel.\n44:44 Comment: Although he has scored one goal so far, but still.\n44:46 Comment: Gabi Gol.\n44:48 Comment: In Italy this is the name of the 19-year-old European Championship-Brazil.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: and for this a free kick was awarded from outside the penalty area,\n0:5 Comment: Peresic received a yellow card.\n0:7 Comment: With this episode, I think we have finally figured it out.\n0:10 Comment: Well, there are situations that you don't see often,\n0:13 Comment: and therefore it is difficult to respond to them immediately and thoroughly analyze everything.\n0:19 Comment: But that’s why there’s a break, including for you and me, to figure everything out.\n0:25 Comment: Let's see how the free kick is executed.\n0:27 Comment: Then I’ll remind you of the team lineups, because the first minutes of the half are, naturally, very, very important.\n0:32 Comment: What a mood the home team came out in, which had little success before the break.\n0:40 Comment: So far, Joa Mario has taken the first free kick in the second half unsuccessfully.\n0:44 Comment: Roma is trying to go from defense to attack.\n0:46 Comment: The violation of the rules was accidentally caught by Perez Murillo.\n0:49 Comment: And the ball is already in play.\n0:51 Comment: Peresic, who was rarely in the game,\n0:54 Comment: I came across Ruedeger in the first half.\n0:57 Comment: And Ruedeger leaves Kondobia very well.\n1:0 Comment: Four Roma players on the opposing side of the field.\n1:3 Comment: Rüdeger makes good passes.\n1:5 Comment: Again at MGOLAN-1.\n1:7 Comment: True, Jack didn’t immediately pass the ball to him, so Inter managed to play in the selection.\n1:11 Comment: Brozovic on the side and on the map.\n1:13 Comment: And here the combination of central defenders is still working flawlessly.\n1:17 Comment: Manolas, Faceo.\n1:19 Comment: Well, honestly, it’s clear that in this match,\n1:22 Comment: Sudar Brozovic played great at the end of the half,\n1:26 Comment: learned his command on the spot.\n1:28 Comment: Strockman with the ball in the opponent's half of the field.\n1:31 Comment: Jack makes fish in the center forward's place.\n1:35 Comment: Strockman is in short with MGOLAN-1.\n1:37 Comment: Dar Rossi and Roma calmly roll the ball without much forward movement.\n1:40 Comment: Handanovic in goal for Inter.\n1:42 Comment: Murillo 24th, number 33.\n1:44 Comment: Brozovic is there.\n1:46 Comment: 17th Brozovic, 77th Kondobia.\n1:48 Comment: 7th Joamario.\n1:49 Comment: 6th Galliardini.\n1:50 Comment: 5th Peresic.\n1:51 Comment: 44th Condreo.\n1:52 Comment: 8th and 7th.\n1:53 Comment: And the 9th cards.\n1:54 Comment: Pioli, Silva Pioli, in charge.\n1:56 Comment: Stefano Pioli, Inter head coach, none yet\n2:1 Comment: I didn't make any substitutions.\n2:3 Comment: Although there is a choice.\n2:4 Comment: And we are players who, in principle, could take the field,\n2:7 Comment: to try to somehow pick up the ball and start something\n2:10 Comment: What has already been organized has already been carried out in the attack, everyone is still sitting\n2:13 Comment:  in reserve.\n2:14 Comment: First of all, this concerns Banega.\n2:16 Comment: Roma.\n2:17 Comment: Honest at the gate.\n2:19 Comment: Facio 20th, 44th.\n2:21 Comment: Manolo with Grund Perez.\n2:22 Comment: 13th Joan Jesus.\n2:23 Comment: 3rd.\n2:24 Comment: 2nd Rüdiger.\n2:25 Comment: This is defense.\n2:26 Comment: Middle of the field and attack.\n2:27 Comment: And Derosi's attack is the 16th.\n2:28 Comment: Inter Havana 4th.\n2:29 Comment: 6th Strotman.\n2:30 Comment: 11th Salad.\n2:31 Comment: 9th Jack.\n2:32 Comment: Spalletti, head coach of Roma.\n2:33 Comment: Dalieu Ventok, Chief Arbiter.\n2:34 Comment: Matchok.\n2:35 Comment: Condreo with the ball.\n2:36 Comment: Melee strike.\n2:37 Comment: Honest on the spot.\n2:38 Comment: We played it quickly.\n2:39 Comment: Roma was not ready to retreat.\n2:40 Comment: And it was uncomfortable.\n2:42 Comment: It's hard to say what exactly Brozovic is up to.\n2:43 Comment: It’s either a cross like this, or just a ball.\n2:44 Comment: My legs fell off.\n2:45 Comment: And Condreo came in beautifully.\n2:46 Comment: Through the pass together with my comrades.\n2:47 Comment: On command, into the penalty area.\n2:48 Comment: Melee strike.\n2:49 Comment: Goalkeeper.\n2:50 Comment: And it was uncomfortable.\n7:49 Comment: Why only one?\n7:52 Comment: Absolutely alone.\n7:53 Comment: Just now Juamario approached him.\n7:56 Comment: Where is the eternal companion of Rojin Endulan Galiardini?\n8:2 Comment: Judging by the whistle on the sansir, it definitely sings\n8:5 Comment: Roman departure.\n8:19 Comment: Out.\n8:21 Comment: Includes isthmus.\n8:25 Comment: Well, what does Piele need to do with substitutions?\n8:30 Comment: For now, he decided to start the second half the same way he ended the first.\n8:34 Comment: And he didn’t make any changes to tactics or formation changes with replacements.\n8:41 Comment: Rodrico Palacio, it seems to me, ran to actively warm up and prepare for sports.\n8:45 Comment: Not on the field.\n8:46 Comment: Eden will come out first.\n8:50 Comment:  Attack.\n8:55 Comment: Italian Brazilian who recently received an Italian passport.\n8:59 Comment: It was purchased under Manchin.\n9:1 Comment: And for some reason, roughly speaking, it’s more clear why.\n9:5 Comment: Because he scored 12 goals in the 19th match in Suntory.\n9:8 Comment: And for some reason the Internet decided that this was the same person,\n9:11 Comment: who will improve the game in attack.\n9:14 Comment: Not everything worked out for Ikarto then.\n9:16 Comment: Here in the striped shirt is the new owner of the club.\n9:22 Comment: Well, let's put it this way, the main shareholder.\n9:24 Comment: Tahir, sitting next to him, continues to remain the president of the club.\n9:29 Comment: But all affairs, this is clear, are led not by the president, but by the owner.\n9:42 Comment: The referee's whistle has sounded.\n9:51 Comment: Yes, well, I have to tell you right now, Palush, this is what we were talking about.\n9:56 Comment: About the latest news from...\n10:2 Comment: ...from Thane.\n10:5 Comment: Inter.\n10:7 Comment: Now Perez is still taking the ball out of the trophy area.\n10:12 Comment: Counterattack at Roma.\n10:13 Comment: 3 in 3.\n10:14 Comment: Very large gap between the lines.\n10:16 Comment: Salah liberates the Naymdulan zone.\n10:18 Comment:  Hit!\n10:21 Comment: And the score becomes 2-0.\n10:23 Comment: Fantastic take.\n10:25 Comment: Rajin Naimdulana.\n10:28 Comment: Everyone knows how he hits with his right hand.\n10:30 Comment: If you didn't know, then Inter found out today.\n10:32 Comment: But of course he doesn't know what it is.\n10:34 Comment: If you didn't know, then Inter found out today.\n10:36 Comment: But for some reason I forgot about it in this game episode.\n10:39 Comment: And again they allowed Naimdulan to rush towards someone else's gate.\n10:45 Comment: And there's a ball under my right foot.\n10:47 Comment: Shot. 2-0.\n10:54 Comment: Tori Averto shakes her head.\n10:56 Comment: There was no violation of the rules.\n10:58 Comment: And it’s unlikely that Naimdulan broke the rules here.\n11:0 Comment:  Here he is.\n11:2 Comment: By the way, I got it again.\n11:4 Comment: And this is a question for the coach.\n11:6 Comment: The way he handled the game today against one of the best players, of course.\n11:10 Comment: The opposing team.\n11:12 Comment: Why does Galierdini participate in the vast majority of martial arts with Naymdulan and lose these combats?\n11:20 Comment: So how does Naimdulan play?\n11:22 Comment: I practically dragged him from my own penalty bone to someone else’s.\n11:25 Comment: Here there was a slight touch on Gallierdini's back.\n11:28 Comment: There was nothing special.\n11:30 Comment: Obvious game with an elbow to the body.\n11:32 Comment: There are many judges.\n11:34 Comment: In addition to Tagliavento, he also has an assistant on the line, who also saw this episode very well.\n11:38 Comment: And he didn’t give any signal to the referee on the field.\n11:42 Comment: And after that, Naimdulan took over the game and moved along the trajectory from which a right-footed shot flowed.\n11:49 Comment: Which is what happened.\n11:52 Comment: Two amazing goals from Rojin Naimdulan.\n11:54 Comment: The ninth goal of the season for the former central midfielder, who was more defensively oriented.\n12:0 Comment: Sawah, now Inter should get together and not get more.\n12:5 Comment: Somehow Inter is clearly not in the right mood right now.\n12:9 Comment: The game is not over yet. There is more than half an hour ahead.\n12:17 Comment: For which you can try to fix something.\n12:19 Comment: Roma has recently learned to play for zero.\n12:23 Comment: But in general, in principle, the team is fun.\n12:26 Comment: She loves to score, but at the beginning of the season she missed goals quite regularly and almost didn’t keep a clean sheet.\n12:34 Comment: Now, of course, Roma has improved team play in defense as well.\n12:38 Comment: That's why it's difficult to score against her.\n12:40 Comment: But if Roma started to score, then go stop the team that is in the last three matches,\n12:47 Comment: including Villarial, let's say, in the last three victorious matches she scored 4 goals each.\n12:57 Comment: What teams? Torino, Ferentino, Villarial in the Europa League.\n13:4 Comment: The team is very decent and everyone got 4 from Roma.\n13:7 Comment: 2-0 in favor of Roma.\n13:9 Comment: Of course, it would be much more interesting to follow the fight in the Italian championship,\n13:14 Comment: If Roma really forced Juventus to fight for the championship.\n13:20 Comment: The 10 points, of course, are won back, but the question is that Roma must score 100%,\n13:26 Comment: And Juventus must lose 9, at least.\n13:33 Comment: Although the loss is a little less. Hit with a turn.\n13:35 Comment: And this is a big question, not for Roma, but for Juventus, whether they will lose those points,\n13:39 Comment: which will allow Roma, with an almost 100% indicator, to get closer to the leader.\n13:46 Comment: Gander shot, hit Andreeva's heel, so the ball went out of bounds.\n13:50 Comment: And Lucianos Paletti does not allow his team to switch off from the fight for even a second\n13:54 Comment: and constantly keeps his players on their toes, prompted and strengthened.\n14:0 Comment: Rydegerr, long pass forward.\n14:8 Comment: Lainggulland.\n14:11 Comment: This player plays almost flawlessly.\n14:15 Comment: There's still a whole half hour left before the end of the match.\n14:18 Comment: I don’t think it’s worth giving up to Inter on your own field.\n14:21 Comment: Well, what about Olya, why doesn’t the Inter coach make any substitutions?\n14:26 Comment: Jack was very skilled at throwing the ball at the football.\n14:29 Comment: But, as we see, he didn't have time.\n14:31 Comment: And, of course, he didn't have time.\n14:33 Comment: But, of course, he didn't have time.\n14:35 Comment: And, of course, he didn't have time.\n14:39 Comment: The Inter coach does not make any substitutions.\n14:42 Comment: Jack very skillfully dumped the ball into Salak's move.\n14:45 Comment: Roma plays very compactly in the middle of the field.\n14:47 Comment: Now, I think you noticed how much distance there was between Jack and Salak.\n14:51 Comment: Players to the middle of the field.\n14:53 Comment: They were ready to immediately meet Inter's attack when they lost the ball.\n14:57 Comment: And not allow the home team to create anything in Roma's half.\n15:6 Comment: And to indicate, to create some kind of intrigue in this match.\n15:11 Comment: Irudi Gemm meant.\n15:13 Comment: There are far fewer fans than opposing players.\n15:36 Comment: As for the future of Inter, no matter how this season ends,\n15:50 Comment: Anyway, work for the future with very ambitious plans is already in full swing.\n15:54 Comment: And the new main shareholder of Inter, the owner of the Chinese company Insulin Holdings.\n16:6 Comment: Went to Madrid this week to meet with Flantine Perris, President of Real Madrid.\n16:13 Comment: And negotiations were going on about the transition...\n16:18 Comment: I’m intentionally giving a short pause so that you can discuss who we’re talking about.\n16:23 Comment: No, not about Cristiano Ronaldo.\n16:25 Comment: The answer is wrong, but the correct answer is Hames.\n16:29 Comment: James Rodriguez. Inter's top summer transfer target.\n16:34 Comment: And the first round of negotiations between the owner of Inter and Perris has passed.\n16:40 Comment: Here's a shot wide of the goal, Kondreva missed the gun.\n16:45 Comment: Disappointed fans who expected a better performance.\n16:48 Comment: Now Kondreva, since it was asking for a shot, probably also.\n16:53 Comment: Although Fasi has already created an almost impenetrable barrier from his huge body.\n16:59 Comment: But Eder also decided that crossing would probably be a more interesting solution in this game situation.\n17:8 Comment: Dzeko, Perris, Strotman, Salah.\n17:16 Comment: Jacko.\n17:19 Comment: It's almost impossible to get close to Jack when he opens the ball with his body like that.\n17:22 Comment: Strothman to the right.\n17:24 Comment: In terms of shots, both teams' performance was equal.\n17:29 Comment: But the important thing is that on the scoreboard two shots from Roma, and even some from Rodin Erduan, turned out to be accurate.\n17:46 Comment: Roma wins with a good lead.\n17:51 Comment: But also considering that Inter today still doesn’t do much.\n17:55 Comment: First of all, due to the fact that Roma does not allow anything to be done.\n17:58 Comment: Eduan stands and picks up the ball.\n18:1 Comment: Moves to someone else's half of the field.\n18:3 Comment: And the diagonal.\n18:4 Comment: Dzheko, Dzheko.\n18:5 Comment: It’s unlikely that he’ll volley or shoot, because there was already an outgoing ball.\n18:10 Comment: Nevertheless, he enters the penalty area.\n18:12 Comment: Oh, what a handsome Blizzard.\n18:14 Comment: But the good Pepper, which just happened to be discovered here, is no less cooked.\n18:21 Comment: Team play is certainly lacking today.\n18:23 Comment: One by one, Inter is still achieving something.\n18:26 Comment: But there is no interaction between the players, and in all lines.\n18:32 Comment: Teams to Stefan Pierre.\n18:34 Comment: Joe Marius with the ball.\n18:38 Comment: Peresic, Rydegerr.\n18:40 Comment: Here lies the Icardi kick.\n18:43 Comment: Manolas seemed to be a little late.\n18:46 Comment: And no, criminal.\n18:47 Comment: Icardi was first on the ball.\n18:49 Comment: But, since all this happened very quickly and ran out under Manolas,\n18:54 Comment: Of course, it was very, very difficult for him to hit Icardi more accurately.\n19:6 Comment: Roma also has the most varied stock.\n19:9 Comment: There are various options.\n19:13 Comment: Roma has put together a good team.\n19:17 Comment: I think that of the remaining teams, Roma is one of the big favorites for the Europa League.\n19:23 Comment: Another thing is that the Italians, of course, find it very difficult to overcome themselves and force them to take the Europa League seriously.\n19:29 Comment: But I think Roma's American owner James Palotto is Italian, naturally,\n19:36 Comment: but the American sports manager, he gives some new introductions to the club,\n19:44 Comment: that any title is good, any cube is good.\n19:47 Comment: We need to replenish the club museum and not disdain victories in the tournament,\n19:52 Comment: Which, relative to the Champions League, may not be as prestigious.\n19:57 Comment: All victories are good.\n19:59 Comment: That's probably what James Palotto thinks.\n20:3 Comment: Rüdegerr, meanwhile, is making, in general, a very good diagonal.\n20:7 Comment: What a difficult ball Salah managed to handle and almost continue the attack.\n20:12 Comment: Well, something incredible.\n20:14 Comment: Salah still managed to slow down the most difficult ball on one leg,\n20:17 Comment: change the direction of your movement.\n20:19 Comment: And Gallierdini was already flying in a tackle and knocking the ball out from under Salah’s feet.\n20:26 Comment: But Juan Jesus throws Roma.\n20:29 Comment: Not in a hurry. I think it was too early for Inter to decide that it was all over in this match.\n20:35 Comment: Especially in front of your new leadership.\n20:39 Comment: We could have fought.\n20:41 Comment: But in fact, we really cannot know what processes are happening there.\n20:46 Comment: You yourself understand perfectly well how many people want to lead\n20:53 Comment: and participate in the formation of the transfer budget.\n20:57 Comment: And in general, in this whole process of negotiating the acquisition of those players\n21:3 Comment: A lot of money appeared in the club.\n21:6 Comment: Therefore, there can be any kind of undercurrents,\n21:8 Comment: Which, let alone from Russia, you wouldn’t guess about when you’re in Italy.\n21:13 Comment: Dengberg with the ball. Pass to the left.\n21:15 Comment: Joa Mario throws the ball towards Icardi.\n21:18 Comment: Icardi is clearly losing the fight to Fazio today.\n21:22 Comment: Good Argentinean.\n21:32 Comment: Well, here you go, one of the examples of Civili's transfer policy.\n21:36 Comment: They dug up a player like this somewhere\n21:41 Comment: from a club whose name you don't know at all.\n21:46 Comment: Nothing. Ferrok Karin. O.E.S.T.\n21:50 Comment: It sounds beautiful and, apparently, it is connected with the railway, most likely Argentine.\n21:56 Comment: I came from such a club, and it’s not even the highest division,\n22:1 Comment: And the first divisional championship of Argentina.\n22:4 Comment: From there he came to the second team of Sivili.\n22:8 Comment: And, of course, to the first team of Civilly.\n22:12 Comment: Then I played in Tottenham and moved to Roma.\n22:19 Comment: And here he became, despite the fact that the choice of defenders of Italy is always good,\n22:23 Comment: in the Italian room, and in Roma he himself became a player in the first team.\n22:31 Comment: Rudy Gerpi.\n22:33 Comment: And, of course, to the first team of Civilly.\n22:36 Comment: Rudy Gerpi.\n22:38 Comment: Joa Mario.\n22:41 Comment: Joa Mario received the ball from Candebea.\n22:44 Comment: An Inter goal can change a lot on the field.\n22:48 Comment: It seems to me that Inter needs to fight, try to cling to every ball,\n22:51 Comment: for each attacking combination.\n22:53 Comment: Pieli.\n22:55 Comment: Peresic.\n22:56 Comment: Joa Mario.\n22:57 Comment: Peresic.\n22:58 Comment: Joa Mario.\n22:59 Comment: He beat me once, he beat me twice in the penalty area.\n23:1 Comment: He shouldn't come in.\n23:2 Comment: Perez knocked the ball out.\n23:3 Comment: I didn't want to, but corner Perez knocked the ball out.\n23:5 Comment: It so happened that he rolled out of bounds, just behind the goal line.\n23:8 Comment: But the corner is a chance for Inter.\n23:11 Comment: Joa Mario is here at the ball.\n23:13 Comment: Well, with Eder’s transition we just started remembering him,\n23:18 Comment: When Mendoine ran to score the second goal.\n23:20 Comment: It's really strange that there were so many expectations about Eder.\n23:25 Comment: Since he moved to Inter, he has only scored five goals.\n23:27 Comment: The serve takes the ball.\n23:28 Comment: Honest, there is no one to throw forward very calmly, because Roma decided to pull all their players into their own penalty area,\n23:36 Comment: in order to stop the slightest attempts by Inter to start a fight at the end of this match.\n23:47 Comment: Inter have a trip to their career in the next round, then a game with Antalanta, a trip to Torino.\n23:52 Comment: Game with Sambori.\n23:53 Comment: Well, in general, such a calm, even calendar.\n23:55 Comment: There are no such super matches.\n23:57 Comment: And Roma has the Italian Cup and a derby with Lazzo.\n24:2 Comment: Then the game with Napoleon and then with Leon away in the Europa League.\n24:6 Comment: And then a trip to Sicily from Palermo.\n24:8 Comment: It's a game, so Roma's schedule is very difficult.\n24:11 Comment: Multiple matches over 11 days, 4 games.\n24:16 Comment: But it looks like the team is fine.\n24:18 Comment: Go over the ball. Serve!\n24:22 Comment: Great. Rüdiger jumped out. Violation or not?\n24:25 Comment: Struatman. Everyone is looking at the judge and so are we.\n24:28 Comment: Tollivento shows that the violation has manifested itself.\n24:30 Comment: And, of course, Roma too.\n24:32 Comment: But, of course, Inter too.\n24:34 Comment: And, of course, Roma too.\n24:36 Comment: And, of course, Inter too.\n24:42 Comment: Struatman. Everyone is looking at the judge and so are we.\n24:44 Comment: Tollivento shows that violations have manifested themselves.\n24:46 Comment: Galir Denis is once again on the lawn.\n24:48 Comment: Then he fell from a collision with Naimdulan.\n24:51 Comment: Now fell due to contact with another Roma player.\n24:55 Comment: But the referee was nearby and saw the episode.\n24:57 Comment: He’s already definitely better than us, Van.\n24:59 Comment: 70th minute. Candebia is on the lawn.\n25:3 Comment: Let's look again.\n25:7 Comment: The episode first shows us the trauma.\n25:9 Comment: What's here?\n25:11 Comment: Here, in my opinion, there is an ordinary fight for the ball, which Galir Denis strictly loses.\n25:18 Comment: On this side.\n25:20 Comment:  Let's see.\n25:22 Comment: Oh, it's simple. They fight among themselves.\n25:27 Comment: And the stands, naturally, react differently to each episode.\n25:30 Comment: So, Empirotti.\n25:33 Comment: Takes the field instead of Salah.\n25:36 Comment: Then the gentleman led Jack to the main team.\n25:39 Comment: And it was probably surprising to many that he uses Empirotti as his main striking force.\n25:45 Comment: In principle, the player is not particularly scoring.\n25:47 Comment: And it was not very clear what functions Empirotti performs in this team in his first solo season after moving from Jenn.\n25:55 Comment: And why is it used on the flank.\n26:0 Comment: Excuse me, I'm in the center forward position.\n26:2 Comment: By the way, this Argentinean also arrived from Seville in Italy.\n26:9 Comment: Continuing the topic of why there is such interest in the sports director of this Spanish club.\n26:20 Comment: Well, now the jack is playing out, so Empirotti often remains in reserve.\n26:23 Comment: The corner earns Inter.\n26:25 Comment: There is still more than enough time to still try to sharpen the ending of this game.\n26:31 Comment: But Inter really need a goal.\n26:34 Comment: Kondreva serves.\n26:37 Comment: And you have to score the card reset! Well, how can that be, huh?\n26:43 Comment: And the Inter players raise their hands to the sky in the hope that the referee will give a penalty if they cannot manage to send the ball into the goal themselves.\n26:52 Comment: But there was hardly any reason to appoint an 11-meter penalty.\n26:57 Comment: Well, as four Inter players failed to send the ball into the goal, the serve was very good.\n27:2 Comment: Suango, Nidel.\n27:5 Comment: This was a very serious chance for Inter to reduce the score gap in the match.\n27:12 Comment: We almost managed to beat Kondrev.\n27:16 Comment: Jeanne Jesus.\n27:19 Comment: Spent several seasons at Inter, and played for two seasons as a main part of the team.\n27:24 Comment: So Pirotti, with fresh strength, immediately beat him so easily.\n27:28 Comment: Medela rolled the ball towards Zhek.\n27:31 Comment: Goalkeeper Kondanovic pushed Pirotti out of the goal.\n27:35 Comment: Pass to Zheku, kick.\n27:37 Comment: And Roma misses the chance to do something completely large and indecent.\n27:41 Comment: Inter did not have time to return to the attack.\n27:44 Comment: Of course, stereotypes change.\n27:47 Comment: What many are accustomed to consider Italian football,\n27:52 Comment: such a concrete game of defense, when no one opens up,\n27:57 Comment: Leaves no free zones.\n27:59 Comment: All this is a thing of the past.\n28:0 Comment: A number of teams play completely openly in Italy.\n28:3 Comment: And, of course, on defense.\n28:9 Comment: A number of teams play completely openly in Italy.\n28:13 Comment: And they make enough mistakes in defense.\n28:16 Comment: And the performance is high in the Italian championship.\n28:19 Comment: In general, in one way or another, but in the impersonality of Italian football,\n28:24 Comment: I think it’s high time to stop blaming.\n28:28 Comment: Corner is another possibility.\n28:30 Comment: Andreu serves great.\n28:32 Comment: Manoles played confidently at the Vratarskaya corner.\n28:36 Comment: And Dambrosius went into this single combat with a fall.\n28:44 Comment: Please watch another episode when...\n28:46 Comment: That's it, that's it.\n28:47 Comment: But no luck.\n28:48 Comment: With a bounce.\n28:57 Comment: They believe Strotman broke the rules.\n29:3 Comment: But there are too many judges\n29:4 Comment: which are much closer to the episode.\n29:7 Comment: Three pairs of eyes watched this moment from different points.\n29:11 Comment: And not one of the referees, not the referee, not the one behind the goal.\n29:16 Comment: Neither Toli Evento himself.\n29:17 Comment: We saw no reason to appoint an 11-meter one.\n29:20 Comment: And Inter was really unlucky, because both Kudybia and Eder\n29:26 Comment: We could have sent the ball into the goal, but the rebound was too inconvenient for both.\n29:32 Comment: 75th minute. 2-0.\n29:34 Comment: Two fantastically executed and beautiful goals by Rojin Endulan\n29:42 Comment: We decorated this match.\n29:44 Comment: Gabi is a goal with a curious story.\n29:48 Comment: His agent went to complain to the club president Eric Thohir\n29:52 Comment: and ask for playing time for your ward.\n29:54 Comment: Here I repeat once again, the problem is that it is not very clear,\n29:57 Comment: What are the powers of the former main shareholder who\n30:1 Comment: He only stayed there for a few months, not even years.\n30:5 Comment: Indonesian investor Erik Thohir who bought the club\n30:9 Comment: Massimo Marati, so it is unlikely that Thohir could have helped the agent\n30:16 Comment: this Brazilian and guarantee him playing time.\n30:20 Comment: Conventionally a very talented football player, former Santos player\n30:25 Comment: Gabriel Porbosa Almeida.\n30:28 Comment: But so far he has only played 66 minutes in his squad\n30:32 Comment: The new team, of course, neither he nor the agent are happy with this.\n30:35 Comment: But he's only 19 on the other hand, so\n30:38 Comment: Everything is probably ahead of him.\n30:40 Comment: Here you go, it's time to prove yourself.\n30:42 Comment: The 75th minute, that means another quarter of an hour and the cardi passes.\n30:45 Comment: Facio broke the rules.\n30:47 Comment: Roma does not allow Inter to quickly put the ball into play.\n30:49 Comment: The fans see this and are indignant about this very reason,\n30:52 Comment: because while they were kicking away from this ball, they already had time\n30:56 Comment: Team Roma to return to the attack.\n30:58 Comment: Now you see, here you go, Gabi Gol blocked him\n31:1 Comment:  judge.\n31:4 Comment: Not even an opponent, but a referee.\n31:7 Comment: Derosi passed back.\n31:9 Comment: By the way, Derosi was noticed after he stood up that\n31:11 Comment: disappeared in any single combat.\n31:12 Comment: He doesn't go for fear of letting his team down.\n31:15 Comment: Strothman.\n31:17 Comment: Nain Golan.\n31:18 Comment: Nain Golan, you're a cunning fellow, help a man do it.\n31:22 Comment: Eh, Strotman, Strotman, well, he sees the field perfectly\n31:25 Comment: highest class football players.\n31:27 Comment: Give the ball to Nain Golan there to the left.\n31:29 Comment: But Strotman decided to make a different decision.\n31:32 Comment: Play on Jacko.\n31:35 Comment: On Jacko.\n31:36 Comment: Another decision to make is to play on Dzeko.\n31:41 Comment: I guess that's understandable.\n31:42 Comment: Maybe Strotman forgot that Nain Golan is today\n31:44 Comment: I scored two and decided to give the ball to a professional after all\n31:46 Comment: the striker, who is lying there on the lawn, somewhere behind\n31:49 Comment: In my opinion, the frame continues to squeal.\n31:51 Comment: We don't see what's going on there, but the game goes on.\n31:54 Comment: No, everything is fine, Jacko is back.\n31:56 Comment: Inter attacking Joa Mario.\n31:59 Comment: Good pass to pass.\n32:0 Comment: If he catches the ball, he must be in time.\n32:2 Comment: Shot.\n32:3 Comment:  Honest.\n32:4 Comment: Calmly takes this ball.\n32:5 Comment: But from Icardi's head.\n32:6 Comment: Apparently, this disqualification unsettled me.\n32:9 Comment: It's one thing when you're absent due to injury and\n32:11 Comment: You can’t really train, somehow you perceive things differently\n32:14 Comment: return to the field.\n32:15 Comment: And when you are in good shape, in game, and, in principle, you have something\n32:18 Comment: It turns out, and the goals are coming, and suddenly you fall out on\n32:21 Comment: two matches due to, in general, one's own, one might say, stupidity,\n32:25 Comment: yes, because I got Icardi for undisciplined behavior\n32:31 Comment: disqualification, then, of course, this, it seems to me, is more\n32:34 Comment: It takes a footballer out of a rut rather than absence\n32:37 Comment: due to injuries.\n32:39 Comment: Icardi is not doing anything at all today.\n32:42 Comment: 78th minute.\n32:43 Comment: Roma with the ball in the opponent's half of the field.\n32:48 Comment: John Jesus, De Rossi, Manolas, Trotman.\n32:53 Comment: The current resistance is already weak\n32:56 Comment: Inter are not very active in pressing.\n32:59 Comment: Rüdigen.\n33:6 Comment: Pirotti is on Mgulaan and Roma are in very good control of the ball.\n33:14 Comment: But Inter does not actively select, acting as an observer.\n33:22 Comment: Inter, of course, doesn't want to play.\n33:27 Comment: By this minute of the match Inter had completely leveled the game\n33:31 Comment: by ball possession.\n33:32 Comment: Exactly 50% of the teams owned the ball.\n33:36 Comment: But this indicator, of course, is remarkable,\n33:39 Comment: especially considering the events of the second half and how\n33:42 Comment: The game is shaping up.\n33:43 Comment: Of that 50% of possession, 83%, as it turns out now,\n33:48 Comment: Inter played in the opponent's half of the field, which was missing\n33:51 Comment: in the first half.\n33:54 Comment: And Roma spends only 31% of the game time in the half\n33:58 Comment: Inter fields.\n33:59 Comment: Nevertheless, he leads the score quite confidently.\n34:2 Comment: 2-0 and until the end of the game with added ones, I think, no more,\n34:5 Comment: less than 15 minutes left.\n34:9 Comment: Deiroshi serve!\n34:11 Comment: Manolas or was

we saw 80 minutes\n34:54 Comment: This football, to say yes, Pieli, of course, did not guess\n34:57 Comment:  compound.\n34:58 Comment: We should have put the fifth one, the tenth one.\n34:59 Comment: Well, that's after the fact.\n35:2 Comment: And the coach determined the lineup before the game.\n35:4 Comment: He considered that against a super-attacking team, Roma, which\n35:8 Comment: plays attack both at home and away, wherever necessary\n35:12 Comment: saturate the middle line of the field.\n35:14 Comment: And, of course, this could still be to some detriment\n35:16 Comment: creative play.\n35:18 Comment: The players were efficient and played well\n35:21 Comment: in selection.\n35:23 Comment: And left Banega Pjoli in reserve.\n35:26 Comment: Probably be guided by these considerations.\n35:33 Comment: Another thing is that the question is, why not earlier?\n35:37 Comment: Peresic and Cardi still scored!\n35:39 Comment: We will have a real ending!\n35:42 Comment: Vladya on Ikarda is still wearing detachable lapels.\n35:47 Comment: Of course, he didn’t give the scoring to Banega, but he\n35:50 Comment: Took part in holding the ball.\n35:52 Comment: At least I have some control over the ball.\n35:55 Comment: And Banega was the one who took part in this ball control\n35:58 Comment: directly.\n35:59 Comment: Of course not him.\n36:0 Comment: He didn't even make the penultimate pass.\n36:2 Comment: But at least there was no turnover.\n36:4 Comment: And this transfer that went, including this one\n36:7 Comment: and his former husband Ikard, whom he

The football players' nerves are already raw here, of course.\n37:24 Comment: Both teams.\n37:25 Comment: And Taglia Vento must show...\n37:27 Comment: Well, in general, he is such a strong-willed judge.\n37:29 Comment: It seems to me that it’s very, very possible to take him out of balance.\n37:31 Comment:  difficult.\n37:32 Comment: And, of course, I'm as tall as Fazio, which probably adds\n37:35 Comment: He has confidence.\n37:36 Comment: Yellow one and yellow second.\n37:48 Comment: There will be a stadium.\n37:52 Comment: We hope that Inter will be able to correct the situation.\n37:55 Comment: Something is not working out with the Roman teams in this 17th\n37:59 Comment: year.\n38:0 Comment: Inter are 1-2 with Lazio in the cup.\n38:2 Comment: Today with another Roman team Roma again 1-2.\n38:9 Comment: And almost the same thing happened.\n38:11 Comment: Lazio made it 2-0 in the 54th minute, in the 56th.\n38:14 Comment: And Brozovic reduced the gap in the score on the 84th.\n38:18 Comment: This happened a little earlier in today’s match.\n38:21 Comment: But in Deros the relationships are appropriate.\n38:23 Comment: They remember him playing rough in the first half.\n38:25 Comment: Yellow card with whist.\n38:27 Comment: Seeing off Derose.\n38:29 Comment: Inter fans.\n38:30 Comment: But Derose saw and heard everything.\n38:33 Comment: I think he has absolutely no time for that right now.\n38:35 Comment: And the main thing is what the final result will be\n38:38 Comment: today's match.\n38:40 Comment: So far Roma is winning.\n38:41 Comment: And a fresh player in the middle of the field.\n38:43 Comment: The first-team player is coming out.\n38:45 Comment: Jacko!\n38:46 Comment:  A fall!\n38:48 Comment: Medel!\n38:49 Comment: What's the judge?\n38:50 Comment: Is it a penalty or what?\n38:52 Comment: Show us carefully so we can figure it out.\n38:55 Comment: He shows calmly and how simply an Olympian Tagliavento is.\n39:0 Comment: Did he give a penalty or not?\n39:2 Comment: Judging by these close-ups, it looks like Tagliavento is giving the penalty.\n39:9 Comment: Everyone ran to sort things out with the judges who are outside the gates.\n39:14 Comment: Medel apparently cut off his assistant Dzeko, in Tagliavento's opinion.\n39:19 Comment: Well, let's see who's first on the ball Dzeko.\n39:22 Comment: And yes, already here after the fall.\n39:26 Comment: Here there seems to be no contact, I didn’t get in.\n39:29 Comment: And here a very controversial situation stumbles.\n39:36 Comment: In the first tackle there was no contact with Dzeko.\n39:39 Comment: And Dzeko tripped over Medel after he lost the ball.\n39:42 Comment: A most curious episode for what in Italy is called moviola.\n39:46 Comment: The slow-motion replay that happens on television and in newspapers with photographs.\n39:51 Comment: But this is after the match. A penalty was awarded.\n39:54 Comment: And Roma can solve all the questions.\n39:57 Comment: These are the cheeky guys who play in Roma.\n40:0 Comment: What a leg! I thought he went to rearrange the ball somehow more conveniently.\n40:4 Comment: Perut, who came on as a substitute, was absolutely calm.\n40:9 Comment: The walker, smoking, comes up to this ball and rolls it on a false swing to the other corner under the supporting leg.\n40:18 Comment: Let's look again. A very interesting situation.\n40:20 Comment: Was it a penalty or not? I don't dare say for sure.\n40:31 Comment: The most difficult moment, but the referee awarded a penalty.\n40:34 Comment: And Roma wins 3-1.\n40:37 Comment: By the way, remember, this was discussed with us.\n40:42 Comment: 13-2 to Roma on penalties this season.\n40:46 Comment: Piele was apparently expecting something like this.\n40:51 Comment: Roma is an attacking team.\n40:53 Comment: Here we need to consider not just taking these numbers out of context and discussing them on emotions.\n40:59 Comment: Besides these statistics, 12-2 or now 13-2 in favor of Roma.\n41:3 Comment: Probably, we need to also calculate the penetration, for example, of Inter Roma players with the ball into someone else’s line area at speed,\n41:11 Comment: when contact is more likely with an opponent.\n41:16 Comment: Between when you have the ball in the center circle or near the line area.\n41:21 Comment: But the game of crossing is not over yet.\n41:23 Comment: Inter still have a chance.\n41:25 Comment:  Why not?\n41:26 Comment: 87th minute with added time.\n41:29 Comment: Now, I think, the referee will add 4 minutes there, or even 5.\n41:32 Comment: This means that Inter still has around 7-8 minutes.\n41:37 Comment: Gabi Gabriel serve.\n41:39 Comment: It's a good hit.\n41:41 Comment: This blow was executed almost flawlessly technically.\n41:46 Comment: Mario Icardi.\n41:49 Comment: Look how Fazio outplayed the case with the body deflection.\n41:56 Comment: Pirotti, of course, is performing.\n42:0 Comment: Just making fun of me as I walked.\n42:1 Comment: I honestly had the feeling that Pirotti had gone to move the ball.\n42:5 Comment: The expression was absolutely indifferent.\n42:8 Comment: And the gait is kind of walking towards the ball.\n42:10 Comment: It's like he's not ready to strike yet.\n42:14 Comment: Cross over.\n42:20 Comment: Push in the back.\n42:25 Comment: 88th minute. Cross over.\n42:32 Comment: Ghigliardini.\n42:35 Comment: No, Eder won't catch the ball.\n42:37 Comment: And today again.\n42:39 Comment: So far, by this minute he is on the field.\n42:46 Comment: And the time spent can be assessed as wasted.\n42:49 Comment: The Italian Brazilian can't do anything at all.\n42:53 Comment: And here is an honest one, who played superbly in two very important moments, especially at the end of the first half, and helped out his team.\n43:2 Comment: Substitution. Another one for Roma.\n43:6 Comment: Can she afford to keep a player from the Belgian national team, a very good footballer from Fermalin, in reserve.\n43:13 Comment: But maybe the Fermalin player that Roma needs is a little different.\n43:21 Comment: Don't be surprised if Roma send him on loan somewhere.\n43:25 Comment: Because, in principle, he is a starting player for any good team.\n43:36 Comment: Fight for the ball.\n43:43 Comment: There is no Roma leadership, James Polote is not here.\n43:45 Comment: The old teams are also sitting there on the top row.\n43:51 Comment: One of the new ones is a hairy man, and on the left of him is actually a Mastodon.\n43:55 Comment: He's in Roma, I don't know how old he is.\n43:58 Comment: Maybe more than Francesca Totti.\n44:1 Comment: Well, Francesca doesn't have any emotions written on his face.\n44:3 Comment: I think he’s already so tired of all this.\n44:7 Comment: Conversations and these butting heads with Spoletti about the amount of playing time.\n44:13 Comment: But as long as Totti is in the team, as long as Totti is an integral part.\n44:21 Comment: But he has completely stopped getting into such important matches.\n44:25 Comment: Don’t even let him out to replace Spoletti.\n44:30 Comment: They show us the Palacio with a hint that what about the Palacio.\n44:33 Comment: I probably could have played.\n44:35 Comment: But again, with the choice of players that Pieli has.\n44:38 Comment: It's very important to guess the composition here.\n44:41 Comment: Now we understand that yes, I probably guessed wrong.\n44:43 Comment: But he didn't play roulette, really.\n44:45 Comment: It was probably based on the players' performance during the week's training.\n44:52 Comment: The medical service probably also brought some numbers and so on.\n44:56 Comment: Therefore, it’s not easy to meet this train from Bukhta-Barakta.\n    \n\n    #######TASK \n    Provide a factually correct and detailed textual description of the game compiled from the information presented above from different sources, in more than 1000 words.\n            \"E:\" represents events recorded exactly after the event happened.\n            \"Comment.\": represents the real-time noisy commentary from the commentator as the game progresses.\n    Don't mention sources of information like commentators or captions, write as if you saw them live.\n    \n    ",
    "summary": "In a highly anticipated clash at San Siro, Inter faced off against AS Roma in a contest that saw the visiting team secure a commanding 3-1 victory. The match commenced with both teams introducing their lineups, filled with strength and expectations. Inter's lineup included Handanovic as the goalkeeper, protected by a formation that suggested a shift with the absence of their regular defender, Miranda. The trio of central defenders deployed were Muriglio donning the number 24 jersey, Dambrosio at 33, and Medel at 17. The midfield was robust with Brozovic (77), Kondogbia (7), and the youthful Gagliardini (5). Ahead in attack were Joao Mario (6), Ivan Perisic (44), Antonio Candreva (87), and captain Mauro Icardi (9). Coaching duties were helmed by Stefano Pioli.\n\nRoma, coached by Luciano Spalletti, countered with a four-man defensive line featuring the notable inclusion of Brazilian defender Joao Jesus (3) and the German Ruediger (2) who occupied the right flank. The heart of defense saw the pairing of Facio (20) and Manolas (44). Midfield prowess came in the form of an experienced Daniele De Rossi (16) and the rejuvenated Kevin Strootman (6), who had overcome severe injuries. The attacking trio consisted of Bruno Peres (13) and the dynamic duo of Rajan Nainggolan (4) and Mohamed Salah (11), spearheaded by Edin Dzeko (9).\n\nFrom the onset, Roma asserted their control, maintaining high pressure and possession. Inter struggled to cope with the pace, as shown by possession stats early on. Nearly 63% of the possession went Roma's way, controlling significant territory. Inter initially appeared cautions, attempting to neutralize the potent Roma attack that saw them scoring multiple goals in previous matches.\n\nNainggolan's brilliancy came to fore in the 12th minute when he capitalized on a defensive lapse to fire a stunning goal past Handanovic, giving Roma an early lead. It was a testament to his skill with a brilliantly executed strike, signaling the start of what would be an influential performance. Inter attempted to rally immediately after the goal but were met with steadfast defensive work by Facio and the others. Roma's defensive setup, and periodic quick counterattacks were imposing.\n\nDuring the following minutes, Inter struggled to make significant inroads into Roma's defensive half, succumbing repeatedly to turnovers. Gallierdini, while actively involved in chasing the ball, seemed overawed by the ingenuity of Nainggolan who maneuvered across the pitch with relative ease. Handanovic was called into action multiple times, one notable chance coming from Salah whose shot was saved.\n\nAs the first half proceeded, Roma's dominance was apparent with additional possession stats indicating their control. They maintained 50% ball possession in Inter's half, a clear indication of their pressing advantage. The hosts offered little in terms of creativity or threat, aside from a few speculative crosses by Candreva that Manolas handled expertly.\n\nRoma’s tactical discipline continued to shine post the water break with De Rossi anchoring the midfield effectively. His passes often linked up the play to the attacking quartet. Salah’s pace on the right and Nainggolan's versatile runs were particularly challenging for the Inter defense, spreading them thin and inviting errors.\n\nBy the second half, Inter was desperate for a change. However, it was Roma again who drew first blood. In the 56th minute, amidst a counter-attack led by Salah, Nainggolan found himself in driving space. Exploiting his freedom, he unleashed another rocket, making it 2-0, much to the despair of Inter fans who saw their team increasingly look out of sorts. Nainggolan's sharpness and command in midfield were unquestionable, and Gallierdini once more found himself chasing shadows.\n\nThe goal sparked interim activity on the Inter bench, and yet Pioli seemed reluctant to turn to his substitutes early enough to alter the dynamic. Inter’s attempts at gaining ground were mostly thwarted by Roma’s organized defense and lethargic pressing shifts by the home side. Eder was introduced but made little impact, his efforts often stifled by Facio's towering presence. \n\nInter mounted a more precise attack around the 70th-minute mark, with chances from Perisic and Icardi, but both lacked the final touch. Roma's composure under pressure was commendable, De Rossi and Facio consistently clearing danger. Inter finally found some respite in the 81st minute, when a well-placed cross saw Icardi flick the ball into the net, reducing the deficit and re-igniting hopes of a late comeback at 2-1.\n\nBut Roma showed resilience and tactical acumen immediately after conceding. They regained control of the ball and resumed their calculated play. Controlling tempo and utilizing substitutions to maintain dominance, they ensured Inter wouldn’t find another chance that easily. Inter poured forward wherever possible, but this ultimately left space at the back. In one of such attacking frenzies, Roma struck a decisive blow. \n\nIn the 87th minute, Dzeko, ever-present in the attack, drew a foul in the penalty area. Although contentious, the referee pointed to the spot, a decision backed by his assistant. Perrotti, stepping up, dispatched the penalty with icy calmness, wrong-footing Handanovic to settle the game conclusively at 3-1. \n\nRoma’s general control of the game was attributed to a structured and well-drilled side, executing Spalletti’s strategies effectively. Their ability to transition smoothly from defense to attack, remain compact when out of possession, and striking clinically were the key differentiators. Inter’s woes could be largely seen in their inability to dominate the central areas or effectively pressurize Roma’s defensive setups, making it difficult to craft clear-cut opportunities.\n\nThe numbers concluded what was a comprehensive Roma performance. Possession was more evenly split by the end, but the crucial aspect was efficiency and quality in phases from the Giallorossi. Raja Nainggolan’s brace highlighted why he is one of the most feared midfielders, while Dzeko's presence continuously caused trouble for Inter’s defense.\n\nInter's performance, stark in contrast to their previous home runs, showed a side still in need of tactical maturity and cohesion – elements that Pioli undoubtedly needs to address if they are to challenge consistently at the top. \n\nThe match wrapped up amid an atmosphere charged with mixed feelings, Inter shell-shocked by their tactical and physical shortcomings, while Roma demonstrated why they still remain viable challengers just behind Juventus. Inter now faces the challenge of regrouping quickly for their next fixtures while hoping the tactical lessons from this encounter can foster improvement. For Roma, it was a statement win, solidifying their attacking prowess and defensive solidity under the tutelage of Luciano Spalletti."
