    "summary": "In an engrossing encounter at San Siro, Udinese stunned AC Milan with a narrow but spirited 1-0 victory. The game was a tale of strategic plays, defensive rigidity, and the occasional flair but was ultimately decided by a solitary goal in the second half.\n\nThe match began with AC Milan taking the kick-off, setting the pace early on, and soon the game saw a series of throw-ins primarily for AC Milan. Within the first nineteen seconds, the ball was out of play and this was a recurring theme in the early minutes, showcasing a lack of control from both sides. By the first minute and a half, Udinese's efforts resulted in throw-ins for both sides as they struggled to find their footing.\n\nThe first significant moment came at 2:52 minutes when an Udinese player committed a foul, providing AC Milan with an indirect free-kick. Milan’s corner kick at 4:01 saw the ball inevitably cleared by Udinese. Moments later at 5:00, a shot off target from Udinese indicated their first attacking intent. Subsequent efforts from either side led to numerous ball out of play situations.\n\nBy the sixth minute, Udinese, having settled into the game, earned a corner and managed their first shot on target of the match. AC Milan responded with throw-ins of their own but were unable to capitalize on these early game moments to create a significant threat. Udinese’s defensive setup proved sturdy as AC Milan’s evolving attacks were continually checked.\n\nThe game saw a pattern of stoppages with throw-ins and fouls marking the play areas. At 12:19, Udinese executed a corner where Emil Hallfredsson produced a threat and Rodrigo De Paul followed up with a shot, although it was blocked effectively by the AC Milan defence. Another attempt at 13:06 saw Sven Kums sending in a cross that was comfortably intercepted.\n\nBy the fifteenth minute, the frequency of set-pieces and stoppages contributed to the game’s stop-start rhythm. Carlos Bacca of AC Milan received a yellow card by the 28th minute for a foul indicating that physical play was becoming a factor. Udinese’s Rodrigo De Paul continued to press with a dangerous free-kick at 31:54, only for it to be blocked effectively.\n\nBoth teams exchanged corners with chances either side of the half-hour mark, but it was Udinese sustaining spells of pressure. Duvan Zapata (33:08) earned himself a yellow card after harsh tackling. Tactical exchanges saw AC Milan attempting to chip balls into the box with Jose Sosa striking an off-target effort.\n\nAs the first half drew to a close, AC Milan’s Suso and Gabriel Paletta showcased their efforts with long-range shots and attempts on target which were dealt with by the Udinese goalkeeping and defensive units. By the 46th minute, the play had settled into a midfield battle with neither team making definitive strides towards clinching a goal.\n\nThe second half kicked off with Udinese trying to sharpen their attacking game. A defined moment came as Emil Hallfredsson met a corner with a header that just went wide of the post. Mila were forced to make an early substitution due to Luca Antonelli’s injury, resulting in Mattia De Sciglio entering the field.\n\nGame play intensified with stops for medical attention, strategic substitutions, and tactical fouls. A crucial substitution for Udinese came around the 15th minute of the second half with Stipe Perica replacing Cyril Thereau, injecting fresh energy into the Udinese front. By minute 17, Badu of Udinese was booked for a tough tackle.\n\nAs the match progressed, the tension heightened with both teams intermittently holding possession and trying to penetrate defensive lines. AC Milan sought to capitalize on set-pieces with crosses into the box that failed to find their intended targets. At 19:22, Emil Hallfredsson narrowly missed a golden opportunity, shooting wide after latching onto a rebound.\n\nAt the 27th mark in the second half, the game saw another moment of intensity with Stipe Perica receiving a yellow card for a foul. Rodrigo De Paul's cross from a free-kick around this period was cleared by the Milan defense showcasing solid defending under pressure.\n\nAmid the tactical plays and defensive clearances, Udinese’s swift counter-attacks began creating critical moments. A vital substitution involving Duvan Zapata set the stage for more pressing attacks. The game reached its climax when at around the 42:32 mark, Stipe Perica, latching onto a precise lofted cross by Badu, finished coolly inside the right post bypassing the Milan goalkeeper. This spectacular strike changed the score to 0-1, sending the Udinese supporters into jubilation.\n\nPost the goal, AC Milan scrambled to find an equalizing response. They introduced fresh legs through substitutions with Gianluca Lapadula and Keisuke Honda among others, trying to rejuvenate attacking options. They continued to drive forward with cross attempts and shots at goal but Udinese's defensive lines led by Orestis Karnezis collected efforts efficiently.\n\nThe closing minutes saw AC Milan attempting a series of aggressive plays but caught their attackers offside, indicative of a strained effort to equalize under pressing circumstances. Despite showing resilience and tactical modification through substitutions and fresh formations, Milan couldn't break through Udinese’s structured defense and goalkeeping excellence.\n\nBy minute 52, as Gianpaolo Calvarese blew the final whistle, AC Milan's efforts culminated in disappointment with Udinese walking off as victors. Reflecting on the game, possession statistics pointed towards Milan’s higher ball control, yet it was Udinese’s tactical counter-attacks that dictated the final result. Highlighted moments included disciplined defensive blocks, tactical fouls leading to multiple yellow cards for both sides, and significant goalkeeping saves.\n\nThe match was a compilation of tactical exchanges and interruptions, with both sides showing prowess in phases. Udinese's effective counter-attacks and their disciplined defense underlined their strategic planning. AC Milan, while showing spells of creative play and possession, lacked a finishing touch in the attacking third.\n\nThis tie at San Siro provided a condensed spectacle of discipline, tactical gameplay, and decisive attacking that ultimately favored Udinese. AC Milan would certainly reflect on missed opportunities and strategic areas for improvement as they aim to bounce back in upcoming fixtures. The game demonstrated the beauty and unpredictability of football, ensuring that every minute on the pitch counted towards the eventual thrilling outcome."
