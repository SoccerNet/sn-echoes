    "summary": "In what turned out to be a spectacularly one-sided affair, Napoli completely overwhelmed Bologna with an emphatic 7-1 victory. The match unfolded under dramatic and high-octane circumstances, with both teams displaying moments of brilliance, grit, and even moments of rash decisions leading to card infractions. Here's a comprehensive breakdown of the events as they happened.\n\n**First Half:**\n\nBologna kicked off the match promptly at 00:00, but the game's first action was less than ideal, with Bologna getting caught offside just 14 seconds into the match. This early slip-up resulted in an indirect free-kick for Napoli. The ball exited play at 01:07, followed by a throw-in by Bologna nine seconds later.\n\nAt 01:39, Bologna committed a foul, and Napoli capitalized on the resulting indirect free-kick. The quick exchanges and nimbleness of Napoli soon paid dividends. In the third minute, after a series of tactical throw-ins by Napoli, they managed their first shot on target, and it found the back of the net. It was a prompt and clinical finish that gave Napoli an early 1-0 lead at 03:48.\n\nBologna quickly regrouped and kicked off again, but the momentum was clearly with Napoli. At 05:20, Bologna managed a corner and subsequently got a shot on target. The effort was met with a swift reply from Napoli, whose counter-attack culminated in a second goal at 05:36, doubling their lead to 2-0.\n\nA series of play interruptions followed, including a noticeable offside by Napoli at 08:13 and another indirect free-kick by Bologna. Bologna's efforts to reduce the deficit continued, but they found themselves frequently thwarted by a well-organized Napoli defense. Bologna was also maintaining pressure, seen when Erick Pulgar of Bologna booked a yellow card at 10:04 for a hard tackle.\n\nNapoli wasn’t without their share of cards, either. Amadou Diawara received a yellow card at 19:38 for a tackle, setting the pace for stringent officiating by referee Davide Massa. The game saw a dramatic turn when Bologna was awarded a penalty at 23:40 following a handball by Napoli's Jose Callejon. However, Mattia Destro's penalty at 25:04 was spectacularly saved by Pepe Reina, Napoli's stalwart goalkeeper.\n\nAs the match intensified, tempers flared. Jose Callejon's subsequent foul at 25:34 earned him a red card, reducing Napoli to ten men. Nevertheless, this numerical advantage was short-lived for Bologna as Adam Masina was shown a red card at 31:02 for a reckless challenge, balancing the teams at ten players each.\n\nNapoli's tactical prowess was further highlighted when Dries Mertens scored a magnificent free-kick at 32:43, extending Napoli's lead to 3-0. Mertens' shot from the set-piece was a masterclass in precision and power, leaving the Bologna goalkeeper helpless.\n\nBologna, determined to claw back, seized an opportunity at 35:23 when Ladislav Krejci’s shot was initially saved, but Vassilios Torosidis capitalized on the rebound, scoring a header to make it 3-1. Napoli restored their three-goal cushion quickly with another goal from Dries Mertens at 42:34 after a fantastic through ball set him up for a close-range finish, putting Napoli ahead 4-1 just before halftime.\n\n**Second Half:**\n\nThe second half kicked off with a substitution by Bologna, bringing on Simone Verdi for Luca Rizzo in an attempt to rejuvenate their attack. However, Napoli continued their dominant display. At 10:31, Marek Hamsik’s effort just missed the left post, signaling Napoli's unrelenting pressure.\n\nNapoli’s persistence bore fruit as Marek Hamsik scored a magnificent goal at 24:40, with an assist from Dries Mertens. Hamsik’s effort from the edge of the box found its way to the top right corner, extending Napoli’s lead to 5-1.\n\nNapoli made substitutions to refresh their lineup, bringing on Allan for Amadou Diawara and later, Emanuele Giaccherini came into the fray. Marek Hamsik’s relentless effort saw him scoring another beautiful goal at 28:15 from a long distance, taking Napoli to a commanding 6-1 lead.\n\nThough Bologna tried to regroup by introducing Bruno Petkovic in place of Mattia Destro and Antonio Mirante replacing Angelo da Costa, they failed to close the gap. Simone Verdi tried to create opportunities, sending crosses into the box, but the Napoli defense remained unyielding.\n\nLate into the second half, Dries Mertens sealed the deal with yet another goal at 44:10, drilling the ball into the bottom left corner after receiving a precise pass from Allan. This goal brought the score to an astonishing 7-1, capping off an exceptional Napoli performance.\n\nAs the final whistle blew, Napoli's dominance had been more than established. Key players included Dries Mertens, whose hat-trick performance was scenic and clinical, Marek Hamsik’s deft play-making and scoring, and Pepe Reina’s crucial penalty save that kept Bologna’s hopes well and truly dashed. Napoli’s tactical discipline and attacking flair outshone Bologna’s efforts, leading to a resounding victory."
