    "summary": "In what proved to be a captivating encounter at the Stadio San Paolo, Napoli clinched a convincing 3-1 victory over Cagliari, showcasing their prowess and determination throughout the match.\n\nThe game commenced with a kick-off by Napoli at 00:00. Almost immediately, the ball went out of play at 00:17, setting the tone for a match that saw a fair share of stoppages and turnovers. Cagliari cleared the ball at 00:42, but it was evident that Napoli intended to put early pressure on their visitors. The ball was out of play again by 00:53. Cagliari managed a throw-in at 01:06, but their struggle to maintain possession was apparent early on.\n\nNapoli’s intentions were clear when they scored the opener at just 01:54, thanks to a well-executed attempt on goal. The crowd erupted as the home side celebrated their early breakthrough. Cagliari responded by kicking off at 02:46, but Napoli's momentum was palpable. Another promising attempt from Napoli came at 03:17. Cagliari tried to respond quickly with a shot on target at 03:42, but the ball soon went out of play at 03:54, leading to a Napoli throw-in at 03:58.\n\nNapoli kept pressing and won another throw-in at 04:31 after the ball went out at 04:19. However, an offside call against Napoli at 07:04 relieved some pressure for Cagliari, who took an indirect free-kick at 07:32. Napoli continued their relentless pursuit with shots on target at 08:12, but they couldn't convert it into a goal. A misstep led to a shot off target at 08:47, and the ball went out of play at 09:36.\n\nCagliari managed to clear the ball at 09:51, but Napoli quickly regained control. The game then saw a period of interruptions with the ball repeatedly going out of play at 11:40 and 12:22. Napoli earned a corner at 12:18, but Faouzi Ghoulam’s delivery went astray. Persistent efforts and fouls marked this phase as Cagliari committed fouls at 12:54 and 13:26, resulting in indirect free-kicks for Napoli.\n\nNapoli’s Jose Callejon was particularly active, trying to connect with teammates and creating opportunities, as seen when he nearly set up a teammate inside the box at 15:34. Cagliari, meanwhile, struggled to string together meaningful plays. Insigne’s blocked shot at 18:32 and another close attempt that soared over the crossbar at 21:50 highlighted Napoli's dominance. Marco Borriello led a spirited response from Cagliari, forcing Pepe Reina into a save at 24:41.\n\nThe first half continued with Napoli relentlessly pressing, yet squandering chances. Insigne missed a goal-kick for Cagliari at 28:21, and Mertens, Hamsik, and Zielinski had near misses between 29:26 and 34:26. Even a corner at 35:43 for Cagliari failed to produce a goal after Barella’s cross was cleared. Napoli's Lorenzo Insigne squandered another chance at 36:33, sending the ball high.\n\nEventually, the match reached a crucial juncture as the first half wound down. Dries Mertens showcased his dribbling ability with a mazy run only to be thwarted by Rafael at 44:15. Then, in the dying embers of the first half, Marco Borriello's free-kick from 24 meters was blocked by the wall perfectly aligned by Reina, bringing the first half to a close at 46:11.\n\nAs the second half began, Cagliari kicked off, and again the ball was out at 00:36. Napoli’s defense was on alert, clearing the ball at 01:45. But the real drama kicked in at 03:57 when Dries Mertens struck a brilliant goal to double Napoli’s lead at 04:00, the stadium erupting in cheers as Napoli seemed to solidify their command over the match.\n\nCagliari quickly kicked off again at 04:40 but faced an uphill battle. Within the next quarter-hour, Cagliari managed a few possessions, including a corner at 05:36, but could not break through Napoli's defense. Napoli, too, had another moment to capitalize when Mertens missed a good chance at 06:46, but they continued to bombard Cagliari’s goal. A great save by Rafael from Albiol’s header on a corner at 19:07 stood out, but the subsequent goal came soon after.\n\nAt 21:48, Lorenzo Insigne latched onto a pass from Mertens, placing the ball into the top right corner, making it 3:0 and seeming to seal the match. Artur Ionita was subbed out for Joao Pedro at 22:43, and Napoli introduced fresh legs with Marko Rog replacing Marek Hamsik at 23:34. Despite Cagliari’s efforts, including Paolo Farago replacing Murru at 25:20, they struggled to make feet against Napoli’s defense. A commendable effort from Lorenzo Insigne’s free-kick was nicely saved by the goalkeeper at 28:01.\n\nIn the closing stages, as Cagliari made multiple substitutions with Diego Farias coming on for Marco Sau at 32:25, they found a late consolation. A notable effort from Diego Farias resulted in a goal at 46:24, slotting past Reina. This affected the mood, but Napoli’s commanding lead meant the outcome was all but decided.\n\nThroughout the second half, Napoli's persistent attacks and Cagliari’s spirited yet futile responses underscored Napoli’s superior tactics and execution. The yellow card shown to Zielinski for a harsh tackle illustrated the game’s intensity. The referee signaled an indirect free-kick for Cagliari, as Piotr Zielinski’s harsh tackle at 09:42 deservedly earned him a yellow card. The match’s dynamic remained action-packed with Cagliari earning occasional reprieves as offside at 15:07 gave Napoli an indirect free-kick to relieve pressure.\n\nNapoli’s substitutions at strategic times by coach Maurizio Sarri, such as introducing Arkadiusz Milik in place of Mertens at 31:40, kept fresh energy flowing into the team while maintaining their upper hand. Cagliari’s attempts, including a notable effort by Diego Farias at 43:25, epitomized their determination but fell short against the well-organized Napoli defense. The match drew to a close with another failed attempt by Cagliari's Diego Farias going awry.\n\nUltimately, Napoli's victory was well-earned, reflecting their tactical superiority, stamina, and the ability to capitalize on key opportunities - their 3-0 lead late in the game showcasing their offensive prowess. Their defense, marshaled efficiently by Reina, ensured that Cagliari’s desperate efforts in the final minutes, including their lone goal, didn’t upset their triumph. With this win, Napoli not only delighted their fans but also underscored their standing as a formidable team in the league."
