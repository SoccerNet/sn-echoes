    "summary": "The stage was set at the Ezio Scida Stadium, where Crotone hosted AS Roma in an engaging encounter. With both teams eager to secure a vital victory, the match commenced under clear skies, promising an enthralling 90 minutes of football.\n\nRight from the first whistle, it was evident that both teams were up for a clash. Crotone kicked off at 00:00 and immediately looked to push forward. However, a misjudged run saw them flagged for offside just 14 seconds into the game. AS Roma were awarded an indirect free-kick, and it became clear that the game would be tightly contested. \"Offside by Crotone\" was not going to be an unusual occurrence early on.\n\nIn a somewhat scrappy start, fouls were aplenty. At 00:45, AS committed their first foul, leading to an indirect free-kick for Crotone at 01:02. However, Crotone's eagerness yet again got the better of them, and they were caught offside for the second time by 01:05. This trend seemed persistent as Crotone seemed to struggle with their timing on runs against a high-pressing Roma defense.\n\nAs AS Roma took control, they also committed several fouls. Another fouled by AS was recorded at 02:00, leading to another indirect free-kick for Crotone, showcasing the intense physical nature early on. As time ticked on, the scrappy exchanges persisted. Ball possession frequently changed hands, with the ball going out of play several times within the first 10 minutes. Crotone had a run of four throw-ins between 02:33 and 04:28, trying to build momentum which was persistently interrupted by AS Roma's defense.\n\nAt 07:19, another foul by AS saw the referee award an indirect free-kick to Crotone. They attempted to breach Roma's defense but were met with stern opposition. AS Roma's physical play was evident as they committed another foul at 08:57, giving Crotone another chance to capitalize on an indirect free-kick.\n\nHowever, Crotone's frustrations showed on the pitch. Leonardo Capezzi's rough tackle was met with a decisive whistle, highlighting the referee's intolerance for any form of ill-discipline on the field. Despite their struggles, Crotone managed to get a shot on target at 10:35 as Aleksandar Tonev received a low pass just outside the box, only to see his fine strike towards the right post saved by the alert goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny, who indeed showcased commendable goalkeeping skills.\n\nThe game flowed back and forth, with both teams struggling to maintain consistent control. AS Roma's defense had to be alert on multiple occasions, launching clearances and dealing with Crotone's pressure effectively. At 14:50, Diego Falcinelli's attempt to beat the offside trap was futile as the linesman promptly raised his flag.\n\nThe game took a significant turn in the 16th minute when Gianmarco Ferrari fouled an AS Roma player inside the box, leading to AS Roma being awarded a penalty. Edin Dzeko stepped up to take the spot kick but missed narrowly, sending the ball wide of the left post - a missed opportunity that could have given his side an early lead.\n\nFrom there, the match continued in a similar fashion. Crotone's attacks were often met with resistance from AS Roma's backline, while AS Roma's forwards struggled to convert their chances. Mohamed Salah had a glorious opportunity at 19:40 with a bullet header that narrowly missed the target.\n\nBoth teams continued to ping the ball around, with the persistent back and forth making for an intense and entertaining first half. Fouls continued on both ends, showing the gritty combat as each team sought control. AS Roma finally broke the deadlock at the 39:07 mark. Radja Nainggolan showcased his trademark skill by taking a great first touch to control a killer pass, and drilled a shot into the bottom left corner, giving AS Roma a 1-0 lead.\n\nCrotone attempted to respond immediately, exerting pressure and earning a corner at 42:18. Djamel Mesbah's pass into the box was blocked, and the subsequent corner taken by Lorenzo Crisetig did not pose a significant threat as it was cleared by the defenders.\n\nAs the first half neared its conclusion, Crotone had another chance from a shooting position outside the box, but by 45:06, the referee called an end to the half with AS Roma leading 1-0.\n\nThe second half began with AS Roma kicking off and quickly committing a foul, indicating they were eager to maintain their lead through aggressive play. The ensuing indirect free-kicks and throw-ins illustrated the similar competitive tussle from the first half. Notably, Federico Fazio's header at 11:48 forced a brilliant save from Alex Cordaz, keeping Crotone in the game.\n\nA controversial moment came at 12:52 when Aleksandar Tonev's goal was disallowed due to offside. This naturally led to frustration for Crotone, who were struggling to find the net despite their efforts.\n\nAS Roma continued to assert their dominance, and another crucial moment came at 31:23. Mohamed Salah, who had been lively throughout the match, turned provider and assisted Edin Dzeko, who calmly slotted the ball home from close range to double the lead for AS Roma at 31:45. It was 2-0, a comfortable cushion for the visitors, reiterating their sharpness in front of goal.\n\nCrotone sought to rally by making several substitutions, with Mario Sampirisi coming on for Djamel Mesbah at 09:32, followed by Marcello Trotta replacing Noe Dussenne at 30:24, and finally, Andrea Nalini taking the field for Aleksandar Tonev at 35:23. Despite these changes, Crotone struggled to find a breakthrough as their attempts were consistently thwarted by AS Roma's solid defense.\n\nAs the clock wound down, Crotone made a spirited effort, with Marcello Trotta and Leonardo Capezzi both trying their luck from long-range efforts. However, their shots either sailed wide of the target or were saved, leaving Crotone frustrated as they searched in vain for a goal to pull themselves back into the game.\n\nTime ticked fast, and AS Roma sought to manage the game with tactical substitutions of their own. At 34:43, Daniele De Rossi replaced Mohamed Salah, adding fresh legs to maintain their midfield stronghold. The final substitution saw Diego Perotti coming on for Radja Nainggolan at 45:12 to bolster their attacking options in the dying moments.\n\nDespite Crotone's late attempts to change the scoreboard, the match ended with solid defensive play by AS Roma, who kept their cool under pressure. The final whistle at 48:59 confirmed AS Roma's 2-0 victory—a well-fought win marked by their ability to capitalize on key chances and maintain defensive solidity.\n\nIn summary, the game was a classic example of a clash between determination and strategic execution. While Crotone displayed glimpses of threatening play and creativity, they fell short of breaching a resilient AS Roma defense. On the other hand, AS Roma executed their gameplay effectively, capitalizing on critical moments and sustaining pressure while showcasing stellar defensive performance. Their ability to weather Crotone's physical play and convert their scoring opportunities proved vital in securing a crucial away win.\n"
