Fiorentino is looking for a new coach.\n13:42 Comment: But almost everyone in Italy is confident that Stefano Pioli will be Fiorentino's new coach.\n13:51 Comment: A former coach of Inter, who has

leave the team in the summer.\n16:35 Comment: At least, there are quite a lot of contenders both in Italy and abroad for Federico Bernardeschi.\n16:45 Comment: Incini.\n16:48 Comment: He played with his head.\n16:49 Comment: Although we know that this is not his strongest feature.\n16:52 Comment: At least because of his height.\n16:53 Comment: But in the end he lost the ball.\n16:56 Comment:

in the end, he just couldn’t hit it.\n17:26 Comment: At the gate.\n17:30 Comment: Belgian striker.\n17:34 Comment: Already a striker, as you understand.\n17:36 Comment: Because Dries Mertens has finally changed his role on the field.\n17:39 Comment: Previously he played on the wing.\n17:40 Comment: And he could also be considered an attacking midfielder.\n17:44 Comment: And now he is already a center forward.\n17:46 Comment: And by the way, his statistics are amazing.\n17:49 Comment: Actually, Dries Mertens is in the race to become the top scorer of the season.\n17:54 Comment: Dries Mertens on 25 goals.\n17:56 Comment: True, after today's performance by Edin Dzeko, who scored.\n18:4 Comment: It will be difficult to catch up with Dzeko.\n18:6 Comment: Dzeko has 28 goals.\n18:7

goals.\n18:20 Comment: I think that this is, let's say, a circle of applicants.\n18:24 Comment: Circle of applicants.\n18:25 Comment: Although, I will repeat.\n18:26 Comment: Higuain and Icardi probably don’t have much of a chance.\n18:29 Comment: Win the sniper race.\n18:31 Comment: But Dzeko, Mertens, Bellotti may well be.\n18:34 Comment: And now score against Mertens.\n18:36 Comment: He would have made a move to move closer to the Bosnian striker.\n18:43 Comment: Dzeko has been in amazing shape all season.\n18:46 Comment: 28 goals in the championship.\n18:47 Comment: This is a really cool result for Dzeko.\n18:55 Comment: Coulibaly.\n18:56 Comment: Let's keep it.\n19:1 Comment: Olivera.\n19:3 Comment: Losing the ball again.\n19:11 Comment: Hamshik is wrong in a simple

quite...\n20:26 Comment: Brave decision by Mertens.\n20:29 Comment: Ilyichich.\n20:30 Comment: Coulibaly.\n20:31 Comment: Kicks the ball out of bounds.\n20:38 Comment: This is the moment.\n20:40 Comment: With Mertens, he avoided being offside very cleverly.\n20:43 Comment: And here...\n20:45 Comment: I really just missed the corner of the goal.\n20:56 Comment: Well, guys, ter Tucker, just grab a million for a flower.\n21:6 Comment: Bravo to Oleg selemonovsky involved and the head of Prem具delicately touching.\n21:10 Comment: In reality, it was just a carro somewhere inside.\n21:17

Comment: The Spaniard is not too noticeable yet, but we know Calijon's strengths.\n22:12 Comment: This is truly the most important footballer for Anapoli.\n22:26 Comment: Kalinich.\n22:38 Comment: A Fiorentina player took the ball.\n22:41 Comment: But still, how zealously, the Anapoli players returned behind the ball line.\n22:46 Comment: And almost the entire squad is defending.\n22:50 Comment: Anapoli.\n22:52 Comment: Kalinich.\n22:55 Comment: Ilyichich.\n22:56 Comment: Kept the ball.\n22:56 Comment: Bernardeschi.\n22:57 Comment: Innings.\n22:59 Comment: There was no rebound.\n23:1 Comment:

Laurentiis.\n23:20 Comment: There were many stories related to him during the season.\n23:22 Comment: Naturally, his favorite topic is Gonzalo Higuain.\n23:25 Comment: He talked about him a lot.\n23:27 Comment: Practically, well, naturally, the peak occurred in August and September,\n23:33 Comment: when Anapoli started the championship without Higuain.\n23:35 Comment: Then there was a certain calm.\n23:39 Comment: But lately Higuain has been remembering de Laurentiis again.\n23:43 Comment: Naturally, calling him a traitor.\n23:47 Comment: Well, we remember how De Laurentiis clashed

hoped he wouldn't fly into the corner.\n25:27 Comment: But perhaps, indeed, the power of thought played a role.\n25:31 Comment: Because the ball hit the post after Mertens' shot.\n25:34 Comment: Hamshek.\n25:35 Comment: Another attack could happen right away.\n25:37 Comment: Hamshek failed to beat Badel.\n25:39 Comment: Badelj today, as always, has been playing quite confidently

everyone is close and dear to Insini.\n35:39 Comment: He is a native of this city.\n35:41 Comment: Born here and, of course, for the tournament.\n35:44 Comment: Local audiences.\n35:45 Comment: Let's look again at how Zarit Gol happened.\n35:47 Comment: Interception of the ball.\n35:49 Comment: Again, Napoli's pressure.\n35:50 Comment: And then transfer to one.\n35:51 Comment: Touch from Mertens.\n35:53 Comment: There was no offside.\n35:54 Comment: Lorenzo Incini handled this situation as it should.\n36:0 Comment: He glanced at the far corners.\n36:3 Comment: Shot it close.\n36:6 Comment: 2-0.\n36:8 Comment: Napoli are ahead.\n36:9 Comment: The joy of Lorenzo Incini.\n36:12 Comment: Naturally.\n36:17 Comment: Kiss emblem.\n36:19 Comment: Napoli.\n36:21 Comment: The Neapolitans have a great half.\n36:28 Comment: Everything, in fact, works out perfectly for the team.\n36:33 Comment: Coulibaly.\n36:41 Comment: Albual.\n36:46 Comment: Damshik.\n36:51 Comment: Bernard Askey.\n36:52 Comment: Pass to the right flank.\n36:53 Comment: Tomovich.\n36:54 Comment: What about Fiorentino?\n36:55 Comment: Unfortunately, things are pretty sad today in the first half.\n36:58 Comment: Moments are few.\n36:59 Comment: But, in fact, the game, to be honest, doesn’t go well for violets.\n37:6 Comment: I got it here.\n37:7 Comment: Here.\n37:22 Comment: Ilichi Cho.\n37:23 Comment: Nikola Ritsyulya.\n37:24 Comment: Doesn't seem like he's going to show a yellow card,\n37:26 Comment: although, apparently, it’s quite painful for Ilyichich, and unpleasant\n37:30 Comment: there was a foul.\n37:31 Comment: And the replay of the goal scored by I.\n37:32 Comment: Zmilyaken chalked up an assist.\n37:33 Comment: You talked about the sniper race.\n37:34 Comment: AND.\n37:35 Comment: Zm adapter.\n37:36 Comment: But here is Jacquy, experience.\n37:37 Comment: Oost.\n37:38 Comment: Yes, they just had pancakes.\n37:39 Comment: What all the rappers here have stopped doing.\n37:44 Comment: Even crometric Steve Winkler did some work.\n37:49 Comment: Fail auf!\n37:51 Comment: But if we take the best assistants, it is Mohamed Salah.\n37:59 Comment: 11 assists.\n38:0 Comment: Calihon shares as much.\n38:3 Comment: Shares first place with Salah.\n38:5 Comment: Third is Alejandro Gomez from Atalanta.\n38:7 Comment: Well, by the way, in the nomination, or rather, according to the goal plus pass system, the competition is again with Jacko Mertens.\n38:24 Comment: Dzeko has 35 points in this component.\n38:29 Comment: Mertens has 33, but is now 34.\n38:31 Comment: Therefore, maybe Mertens has a chance to overtake the Bosnian here.\n38:37 Comment: This is Terusciano.\n38:46 Comment: Pass to Olivero to the left.\n38:52 Comment: Fiorentina don't have many options left.\n38:55 Comment: At least those who are ready to really strengthen the game.\n38:57 Comment: Yes, there is, of course, Federico Chiese, a young talent.\n39:0 Comment: The son of Enrico Chiese, who, in fact, has already shown himself quite well.\n39:4 Comment: There is Ricardo Saponara, who has not yet settled down.\n39:7 Comment: In Florence.\n39:9 Comment: There is Babacar, there is Tello.\n39:12 Comment: These are all players from the Attack group.\n39:14 Comment: But perhaps Paula Souza will replace him.\n39:17 Comment: He needs to do this because the team is losing 0-2.\n39:21 Comment: And so far there is not much chance of escape.\n39:24 Comment: Fiorentina have their final round against Piscara, who has already been eliminated.\n39:27 Comment: Therefore, Fiorentina will probably have 3 points, hopefully, in the final round.\n39:31 Comment: But in order to have a chance to retain 6th place,\n39:36 Comment: Today...\n39:37 Comment: We need to win Fiorentina.\n39:39 Comment: Or at least not lose.\n39:40 Comment: Turn Kick!\n39:42 Comment: Angular.\n39:43 Comment: Will happen.\n39:44 Comment: Milan, let me remind you, is playing against Bologna at home tomorrow.\n39:46 Comment: And in the final round against Kaleri.\n39:51 Comment: Corner kick.\n39:55 Comment: Ball draw.\n39:56 Comment: And Ličić.\n39:58 Comment: Innings.\n40:3 Comment: The ball flies out of bounds.\n40:7 Comment: Bernardeschi.\n40:7 Comment: AND...\n40:8 Comment: Again.\n40:12 Comment: Rodriguez.\n40:21 Comment: And a very, very bad translation.\n40:23 Comment: To the right flank, to Josip Ilicic.\n40:26 Comment: Possibly Fiorentina's best player in the first half.\n40:28 Comment: At least he's very active.\n40:31 Comment: He's useful.\n40:34 Comment: What Bernardeschi, for example, won’t say.\n40:37 Comment: Which...\n40:37 Comment: Yes.\n40:38 Comment: Moves a lot, but essentially...\n40:42 Comment: So far he can’t take on the role of leader.\n40:45 Comment: But, it’s true, Bernardeschi has now earned money.\n40:47 Comment: Samyach took it away.\n40:52 Comment: It's coming!\n41:2 Comment: Gamshik!\n41:7 Comment: , Coulibaly.\n41:10 Comment: AND...\n41:11 Comment: Mari Gamshik again.\n41:13 Comment: Captain.\n41:14 Comment: Napoli.\n41:15 Comment: The leader of this club.\n41:17 Comment: In blue.\n41:20 Comment: Gamshik.\n41:22 Comment: Ghoulam.\n41:24 Comment: Cast in the direction, rather, of Insignia.\n41:32 Comment: But here, by the way, is Rushanov.\n41:33 Comment: No problem.\n41:35 Comment: Reads the situation.\n41:36 Comment: De Mayor.\n41:37 Comment: It's coming.\n41:38 Comment: Again, again, Fiorentina simply cannot attack.\n41:42 Comment: If at the beginning of the match we, in fact, it seems to me, logically attributed this to the excellent pressing of Napoli,\n41:48 Comment: then now we can probably say that Fiorentina is simply not that good in terms of movement.\n41:57 Comment: And that's why it's just like this...\n42:3 Comment: It turns out to play.\n42:5 Comment: And even then it was unsuccessful.\n42:6 Comment: The ball didn't reach Bernardeschi.\n42:8 Comment: Out.\n42:9 Comment: Gamshik.\n42:12 Comment: In blue.\n42:17 Comment: Plays at Albiola.\n42:19 Comment: Calihon.\n42:21 Comment: Again, I lost my desire to play a fast ball.\n42:24 Comment: And this could be a chance for Fiorentina.\n42:26 Comment: Lessino.\n42:28 Comment: Badel.\n42:30 Comment: Left.\n42:32 Comment: Pass in the direction of Ilyichic.\n42:34 Comment: Unsuccessful.\n42:35 Comment: Olivera.\n42:37 Comment: This is a yellow card.\n42:38 Comment: This is a yellow card for Albiola for a foul on the Uruguayan.\n42:43 Comment: The foul was forced because Olivera could have escaped, essentially, along the free left flank.\n42:49 Comment: I had to fail, but Hysai became the victim.\n42:54 Comment: No, Albiol failed.\n42:56 Comment: Falil Albiol should have received a yellow card, not Hysaj.\n43:1 Comment: Ah, Hysaj is unhappy that a foul was not called on him.\n43:5 Comment: Well, the standard position.\n43:7 Comment: This is an opportunity for Fiala, for sure.\n43:10 Comment: At the end of the half.\n43:11 Comment: Innings.\n43:12 Comment: No, it doesn't even work.\n43:14 Comment: Aim for the center of the penalty area.\n43:16 Comment: Tomovich.\n43:29 Comment: Donsello Rodriguez.\n43:31 Comment: The final.\n43:33 Comment: Well, that's it.\n43:34 Comment: What is in the context before the secretary.\n43:36 Comment: Tomovic emphasized that the result was Peter Dietz.\n43:37 Comment: Badel\n43:39 Comment: Ilyichich\n44:5 Comment: Again with the ball\n44:6 Comment: De Maio\n44:7 Comment: Vecino\n44:9 Comment: Olivera\n44:13 Comment: Our first half is ending, slowly ending\n44:16 Comment: 45th minute\n44:17 Comment: To summarize the first part of the match\n44:22 Comment: At Napoli\n44:25 Comment: Total advantage, fair result\n44:30 Comment: Napoli could have scored more\n44:32 Comment: Remember Dries Mertens' one-on-one\n44:34 Comment: We remember his hit to the post\n44:35 Comment: And outside the penalty area\n44:37 Comment: But Napoli actually scored two\n44:40 Comment: And I think I'm happy with it\n44:42 Comment: By and large\n44:43 Comment: Another thing is that you should never relax\n44:46 Comment: There were examples of Napoli having a good first half\n44:48 Comment: And even scoring, taking the lead in the second half\n44:51 Comment: Conducted poorly and lost his advantage\n44:53 Comment: Without winning a match\n44:54 Comment: So of course\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: This is Nikolai Rizzoli, the main referee of the game. He blows the whistle at the beginning of the second half.\n0:5 Comment: And make up the Orientinas. Here is number 12 Ciprian Teterusanu.\n0:8 Comment: Next are three defenders. Number four is De Maio.\n0:11 Comment: Fortieth Tomovic. Second captain of the team, Gonzalo Rodriguez.\n0:15 Comment: Flanks. Olivera plays on the left wing. Number 15.\n0:19 Comment: Well, if we talk about the right flank, then Federico Bernardeschi is number 10.\n0:28 Comment: From the center of the Vessino field. Eighth, fifth padel.\n0:32 Comment: Attack group. Nineteenth Cristoforo.\n0:36 Comment: Seven second Ilyich. And a strike to forward Nikola Kalinic.\n0:39 Comment: Number nine. Cristoforo nineteen. Kalinich seven second.\n0:47 Comment: A kick or serve, rather, from Bernardeschi, Pepper Reinen, the left-hander, takes the ball.\n0:53 Comment: Fiorentina Pavlovsou. Here, if we're talking about Italians,\n0:56 Comment: That, too, by the way, is just one Italian, Federico Bernardeschi.\n1:2 Comment: Fiorentina, yes, still have De Maio, I apologize.\n1:5 Comment: De Maio has dual citizenship, Italian and French.\n1:8 Comment: Second half. Instinio with the ball. He scored the second goal in the first half.\n1:13 Comment: Now pass to Daris Mertens. I think in the second half, if there are no special problems,\n1:19 Comment: Napoli, in terms of results, the Neapolitans will try to play on Mertens,\n1:23 Comment: on his performance. He is chasing Dzeko. However, he fell behind because today,\n1:29 Comment: As I already said, one match of the Italian series happened.\n1:32 Comment: Roma scored five goals against Chievu, won 5-3, and Edin Dzeko scored one goal,\n1:39 Comment: but, nevertheless, increased the lead over Mertens by three goals.\n1:45 Comment: So, of course, today it is desirable, if Mertens sets a goal, to overtake.\n1:50 Comment: Dzeko needs to score, in any case. Although, it is clear that overtaking Dzeko will be problematic.\n1:57 Comment: There are very few games left. Actually, this is the last round.\n2:1 Comment: Next weekend the series ends. The Cup has been played. Let me remind you that on the week of May 17,\n2:8 Comment: On Wednesday, Juventov played with Lazzo. Juventov won 2-0 and, accordingly, won the Italian Cup\n2:16 Comment: For the third year in a row. Well, after the next round the season will end.\n2:22 Comment: But Italy will have another important match. The Italian club Juventus plays in the final of the champions line\n2:28 Comment: against the Real Wadrid team. I think that all of Italy is, of course, looking forward to this match.\n2:34 Comment: Inciniem lost the ball. Lorenzo Inciniem and Lecic.\n2:46 Comment: There will be a shot on goal. No, Lechich will not dare to shoot. Visina.\n2:57 Comment: Somewhere there was a pass to nowhere from Tomovic. Ferentina had a lot of such passes to nowhere in the first half.\n3:4 Comment: Ferentina had a bad half. Almost nothing worked for this team.\n3:12 Comment: But, while it’s fair, I repeat, in some circumstances Napoleon could have scored more against them.\n3:19 Comment: The Mertens barbell. This is a 1 on 1 Belgian. We all remember this very well.\n3:25 Comment: Badelya. Violation of the rules. And there will be another yellow card.\n3:29 Comment: The Napoleon players have the second one. Kulebali receives a warning that the second central defender is coming along.\n3:36 Comment: Napole gets a card.\n3:39 Comment: Perhaps Napoleon is the most expensive player in the current squad.\n3:45 Comment: We are used to Napoleon always selling its leaders at a high price.\n3:50 Comment: And Kovanya at one time, and Lavesi, and Guain, of course, last year.\n3:54 Comment: But now it’s clear that Mare Gapshiko is not for sale at any price.\n4:1 Comment: He is already, in fact, a symbol of the club that will be sold in this situation.\n4:5 Comment: But it's okay. I think it can be forgiven.\n4:8 Comment: Ilyich still has time to attack. Bernardeschi free kick.\n4:13 Comment: And the angle guide. The angle guide works.\n4:16 Comment: Ilyk Bernardeschi.\n4:18 Comment: Bernardeschi himself will play the set piece.\n4:31 Comment: Ilyichich the shepherd.\n4:33 Comment: Husai plays his head well.\n4:43 Comment: Let's stop.\n4:49 Comment: And the ball went out of bounds.\n4:54 Comment: Well, back to Ulibole.\n4:56 Comment: There are many contenders for him.\n4:58 Comment: And above all, an English Premier League club.\n5:0 Comment: Both Chelsea and Manchester City want this player.\n5:3 Comment: But we'll see.\n5:4 Comment: For Napoleon, of course, a lot depends on the Champions League.\n5:7 Comment: Napole is already in it.\n5:8 Comment: But, as I said, the significant difference for the Italians, unfortunately, is between second and third place.\n5:14 Comment: In recent seasons, it has been extremely rare for Italians to qualify.\n5:18 Comment: Well, it just happened that way.\n5:20 Comment: I mean, it’s Napoleon, I once lost to Bilbao on aggregate.\n5:25 Comment: Kalinich, shot on goal.\n5:27 Comment: Best, best space.\n5:29 Comment: Nikola Kalinic, well, actually, the forward needs to hit.\n5:32 Comment: Even from this distance.\n5:34 Comment: Diawara is warming up.\n5:35 Comment: You can appear on the field.\n5:41 Comment: That’s the kind of blow Kalinich got.\n5:43 Comment: And they even get applause from Torre.\n5:45 Comment: He deserved it, Kalinich.\n5:47 Comment: Well, I'm exaggerating.\n5:48 Comment: It is clear that in the regional scene there is no one to applaud.\n5:51 Comment: So, yes, Napoleon needs to somehow get into second place.\n5:55 Comment: Dream that Roma will lose points in the last round.\n6:0 Comment: In the match against Genoa.\n6:3 Comment: To the home at the Olympics.\n6:6 Comment: Well, anything can happen.\n6:7 Comment: I think Napoleon's goal now is to win their matches.\n6:11 Comment: Well, if Napoleon wins, then at least until tomorrow, until the match of the Skorotone Event,\n6:16 Comment: Napole will be among the contenders for the Scudetto.\n6:25 Comment: Breaking the rules.\n6:26 Comment: Dangerous game.\n6:28 Comment: And Paula Souza is preparing a double substitution.\n6:30 Comment: This is Babacar and Tello.\n6:33 Comment: They got the better of them in the first half.\n6:35 Comment: Replacements.\n6:38 Comment: Perhaps replacements.\n6:42 Comment: Well, we’ll see who the two players will replace.\n6:45 Comment: There is probably an option for a replacement.\n6:50 Comment: Cristoforo, who disappeared.\n6:53 Comment: Completely disappeared from view.\n6:57 Comment: Well, Babacar rarely plays.\n6:59 Comment: Rarely does Fiorentina play with two big strikers.\n7:3 Comment: That is, most likely, Kalinic will replace Souza.\n7:5 Comment:  Let's see.\n7:6 Comment: For now we see how Fiorentina combines.\n7:11 Comment: Demaio.\n7:13 Comment: One more pass back.\n7:14 Comment: Teterushanov.\n7:23 Comment: Bernardeschi boldly went forward and transferred to Oliviero.\n7:34 Comment: Badel.\n7:36 Comment:  Bernardesque.\n7:38 Comment: Kept it, although the handling was not better, as he put pressure.\n7:43 Comment: Active Incinia.\n7:44 Comment: It was not easy for Bernardeschi, but Bernardeschi managed.\n7:47 Comment: Kalikhan.\n7:52 Comment: And a pass to the left flank.\n7:54 Comment:  To Gulyama.\n7:58 Comment: Incinia.\n8:1 Comment: Moving towards the center of Lorenzo.\n8:2 Comment: Incinia can break through.\n8:3 Comment: Incinia.\n8:4 Comment: Kick-turn.\n8:5 Comment:  Гуляма.\n8:6 Comment: And, you know, I was very calm around Teterushan, but on\n8:8 Comment: it actually seemed like the ball could have dived into the bottom\n8:12 Comment: his gate.\n8:13 Comment: Once again, let's see how Incinia accelerated.\n8:17 Comment:  Удар.\n8:18 Comment: Yes, you know, everything was not so safe.\n8:21 Comment: Oliviero is changing.\n8:22 Comment: First substitution from Souza.\n8:24 Comment: Babacar is coming out.\n8:25 Comment: And yes, indeed, the forward will play two from the center\n8:29 Comment: Sousa for the rest of the time.\n8:31 Comment: Well, the second replacement for Cristoforo.\n8:34 Comment: Tellieo comes out instead.\n8:38 Comment: But Paula Souza is throwing all her best energy right now, right\n8:41 Comment: like, well, I have no doubt it's to the right.\n8:44 Comment: So, Telleo will go instead of Bernardeschi.\n8:50 Comment: On the left, most likely, Oliviero will be positioned\n8:59 Comment: I'm Bernardesque.\n9:0 Comment: Not yet though.\n9:1 Comment: Okay, we'll figure it out later.\n9:3 Comment: While Bernardeschi attacks.\n9:4 Comment: And Incinia works off the crow.\n9:6 Comment: True, the ball didn't happen.\n9:9 Comment: They will wake up further.\n9:10 Comment: Corner kick.\n9:17 Comment: Earned by Bernardeschi.\n9:27 Comment: Feed.\n9:28 Comment: Babacar entered the fight.\n9:34 Comment: And there will be no corner here.\n9:36 Comment: It's just a ricochet.\n9:40 Comment: This is Cristoforo, who probably failed overall\n9:44 Comment: the match from the point of view of his team, which is losing,\n9:51 Comment:  но...\n9:53 Comment: In any case, now Pavel Souzer is essentially in a hopeless situation\n9:57 Comment: situations.\n9:58 Comment: We need to change the game somehow.\n10:4 Comment: And, of course, increase the attack.\n10:7 Comment: Kalininch.\n10:9 Comment: Kalininch near Katya.\n10:10 Comment: Here Zelinsky plays technically.\n10:12 Comment: And Zelinsky is already rushing forward.\n10:14 Comment: Rismertens opens.\n10:16 Comment: Zelinsky, of course, doesn't want to.\n10:18 Comment: Zelinsky is already rushing forward.\n10:20 Comment: Rismertens opens on the left.\n10:22 Comment: Incinis on the right.\n10:23 Comment: There is Kaliho.\n10:24 Comment: Attack the field at full speed.\n10:26 Comment: One more serve.\n10:27 Comment: But De Maio is here.\n10:28 Comment: And here is De Mayo.\n10:32 Comment: Which plays pretty reliably.\n10:37 Comment: Gamshik.\n10:43 Comment: One more serve.\n10:44 Comment: And De Maio again.\n10:45 Comment: Operates on the second floor.\n10:49 Comment: Incinia.\n10:50 Comment: Gamshik.\n10:52 Comment: Maybe Gamshik can punch it.\n10:54 Comment: Arikashet.\n10:55 Comment: And a corner kick.\n10:57 Comment: Marek Hamsik earned a corner kick.\n11:8 Comment: We remember that Napoleon scored the first goal after a set piece in today's match.\n11:16 Comment: And so, two football players.\n11:18 Comment: Kaliho serves at a dangerous moment.\n11:21 Comment: Why is Teterusenu not on the ball here?\n11:23 Comment: And Rismertens.\n11:24 Comment: Rismertens scores.\n11:27 Comment: This is how the mistake was discovered by goalkeeper Teterusanu.\n11:32 Comment: Rismertens and scores.\n11:34 Comment: And that would be very good.\n11:36 Comment: But, as we see, this would not be very good.\n11:39 Comment: And, of course, that would be very bad.\n11:41 Comment: Goal by keeper Teterusanu Rismertens.\n11:44 Comment: And de Laurentiis scores, essentially, into an empty goal.\n11:48 Comment: He takes the goal with restraint.\n11:50 Comment: Well, this is the 26th goal for Mertens.\n11:53 Comment: And, accordingly, we are already two goals behind Edin Dzeko.\n11:59 Comment: In the sniper race.\n12:2 Comment: Yes, the mistake is obvious.\n12:3 Comment: But, nevertheless, the second goal after the corners is scored by Napoleon.\n12:7 Comment:  Здесь...\n12:9 Comment: Well, it's kind of off-site.\n12:10 Comment: But at this moment, of course, the defensive players didn’t figure it out.\n12:17 Comment: And the goalkeeper.\n12:18 Comment: Fiorentin wanted to knock the ball away from Teterusenu's fists.\n12:21 Comment: It didn't work out. The ball went to Dries Mertens.\n12:24 Comment: And the Belgian scores.\n12:27 Comment: The Belgian scores. 3-0.\n12:29 Comment: 3-0 Napoleon. Fiorentina crushes Sao Paulo.\n12:32 Comment: But I think that now all questions have been resolved.\n12:34 Comment: Although we know that anything can happen in this game.\n12:41 Comment: Another yellow card.\n12:49 Comment: Melombady will get it.\n12:53 Comment: Yes, that's how I strengthened the game.\n12:55 Comment: At least from the players' point of view, Powell Souza's attacking plan.\n13:1 Comment: But then the team missed the third goal.\n13:3 Comment: And now Napoleon earns a dangerous free kick.\n13:18 Comment: Ghoulam. He will hit. Turning kick.\n13:21 Comment: The ball flies above the goal.\n13:25 Comment: Pauses Gulyam pierced.\n13:27 Comment: Over the wall. But failed to hit the target.\n13:33 Comment: 3-0 dear friends.\n13:35 Comment: Napole plays so wonderfully in his final match of the season in his native Sao Paulo.\n13:41 Comment: At my home stadium.\n13:45 Comment: Well, Fiorentina is on the verge of big changes.\n13:48 Comment: As we all know very well.\n13:50 Comment: Sousa is leaving. And there is a new coach ahead, as I said.\n13:54 Comment: Perhaps there will be Yoli. Well, Souza.\n13:59 Comment: In this mood.\n14:1 Comment: Yes, I think that everything is clear from this view.\n14:3 Comment: That he is, of course, very disappointed with what is happening.\n14:6 Comment:  Но.\n14:10 Comment: We must survive this evening.\n14:12 Comment:  Телье.\n14:16 Comment: Tellier throws the ball.\n14:18 Comment: Dangerous moment. Impact. Gooooooooooool.\n14:24 Comment: This evening may just be beginning for Paul Souza and his team.\n14:29 Comment: 3-1. 3-1 scores.\n14:34 Comment: Fiorentina. Tellier, who remained on the left flank.\n14:37 Comment: I thought he would play on the right. He's right-handed.\n14:39 Comment: But you see what a decision from Souza.\n14:41 Comment: Tellier beat his opponent. He shot.\n14:43 Comment: And here Ilyichich.\n14:46 Comment: It was Ilyichic who broke through. Not Bernardeschi, but Slovene.\n14:50 Comment: And he scores with his first touch.\n14:51 Comment: Probyl Ilyichich.\n14:53 Comment: I didn't process anything.\n14:54 Comment: And play for another half hour. 3-1.\n14:56 Comment: And you know, anything can happen in football.\n14:58 Comment: Including in Fiorentina matches.\n15:0 Comment: If you remember what Fiorentina's results were this season, then...\n15:3 Comment: Well, it’s that simple. In the last round, Fiorentina beat Iglazzo. 3-2.\n15:7 Comment: Before this, on April 22, there was a match against Inter at Violets.\n15:12 Comment: Fiorentina beat Inter 5-4.\n15:15 Comment: For example, there was a 3-3 result with Genua in this championship.\n15:19 Comment: 3-3 with Napoli, as I said, in the first round.\n15:22 Comment: These teams played.\n15:23 Comment: Fiorentina lost 2-4 to Inter in the first round.\n15:27 Comment: Well, in general, Fiorentina won 3-5 away from Caleri.\n15:32 Comment: This was at the beginning of the championship.\n15:34 Comment: So, by and large, Fiorentina are a team that is specialist in such results.\n15:39 Comment: My hockey.\n15:42 Comment: Meanwhile, Golihon is with the ball.\n15:44 Comment: Pass to Insigne. Insigne in the opponent's penalty area.\n15:47 Comment: Gamshik. Strike Teterushanu.\n15:51 Comment: Teterusanu takes the ball.\n15:57 Comment: Telem.\n15:59 Comment: No, Telyu didn't touch the ball.\n16:1 Comment: Hysaj on the right flank. Another Napoli attack.\n16:4 Comment:  Хюсай.\n16:7 Comment: Mertens, Mertens. Turning kick.\n16:10 Comment: No, there was more likely a shot here.\n16:12 Comment: Telem.\n16:14 Comment: Visino.\n16:18 Comment: Kalinic enters into a fight with Hamsik.\n16:22 Comment: Gamshik is first on the ball.\n16:29 Comment: Kulebaliim.\n16:38 Comment: Tomowicz.\n16:47 Comment: Bernardeschi twist kick.\n16:53 Comment: Well, yes, many exhaled.\n16:55 Comment: But only Bernardeschi.\n17:1

    "summary": "Napoli triumphed over Fiorentina in commanding fashion with a final scoreline of 4-1 at their home ground, the Stadio San Paolo. From the first whistle, Napoli demonstrated their dominance, pressing relentlessly and controlling the game, showing why they are one of the top teams in Italian football.\n\nThe match started with Napoli setting the tempo immediately, which was evident from the opening minutes. Koulibaly's presence was felt early on as he passed the ball to Albiol, who in turn connected with Mertens. The Belgian forward held onto the ball momentarily before orchestrating an attack down the left flank. As the Algerian defender, Faouzi Ghoulam, surged forward, his crossing attempt was deflected for a corner.\n\nIn the 7th minute, the Neapolitan fans roared in approval as Ghoulam prepared to swing in a corner. The delivery was precise, leading to confusion in Fiorentina's defense. Koulibaly rose highest in the crowd and delivered a powerful header past Tatarusanu, the Fiorentina goalkeeper. Napoli drew first blood, taking an early 1-0 lead, setting the tone for the rest of the game.\n\nNapoli's pressing game remained relentless. Throughout the first half, they didn't allow Fiorentina to settle, constantly forcing turnovers and launching quick counter-attacks. A particularly promising attack came through Marek Hamsik around the 10th minute. Hamsik found space and delivered a delightful ball into the penalty area, but the Fiorentina defense managed to scramble the ball away, preventing the clinical finish that Insigne and Mertens were positioning themselves for.\n\nBernardeschi became an increasingly isolated figure for Fiorentina as he struggled to assert his influence amidst Napoli's pressing. Fiorentina tried to build from the midfield with passes from Badelj and Vecino, but Napoli blocked them with aggressive press from Mertens and Zielinski.\n\nAs the game approached the 30-minute mark, Napoli's attacks intensified. Insigne came close with a strike after weaving past a couple of defenders, only for his strike to be saved. Mertens then had a golden chance when he found himself one-on-one with Tatarusanu. His shot, however, hit the post and rebounded to safety, a significant let-off for Fiorentina.\n\nDespite Napoli’s continued dominance, Fiorentina had occasional moments of promise, largely orchestrated by the industrious Ilicic. Yet these glimmers weren't enough to trouble Pepe Reina significantly. Their few efforts were either off target or comfortably saved.\n\nIn the 36th minute, Napoli doubled their lead via a sensational effort from Lorenzo Insigne. Mertens, adding another assist to his tally, put Insigne through with an impeccably timed pass. Insigne kept his composure and slotted the ball firmly into the far corner, making it 2-0 and providing a significant cushion going into half-time.\n\nThe half concluded with Napoli comfortably ahead and maintaining the lion’s share of possession, adopting both defensive solidity and attacking flair. Fiorentina looked to Paolo Sousa for inspiration at the break, knowing serious tactical adjustments were required to get back into the game.\n\nThe second half began, and it was evident that Fiorentina aimed to respond with more aggression. However, the pattern continued with Napoli asserting their stronghold early. Tatarusanu had to pull off a few saves to prevent further damage, but he couldn't do much when Mertens, seizing upon a defensive error, netted Napoli’s third goal. A poorly handled corner saw the ball drop to Mertens, who took full advantage, making it 3-0 around the 58th minute. His goal brought his tally to 26 for the Serie A season.\n\nFiorentina, however, managed to pull one back shortly after. Sousa’s substitutes, including Babacar and Tello, brought more dynamism. Tello's cross found Ilicic unmarked in the box, who converted nicely, rekindling a flicker of hope for Fiorentina at 3-1 in the 61st minute.\n\nDespite this, Napoli remained undeterred. Their relentless attack led to another brilliant moment from Mertens. With a fantastic run and some skillful dribbling, Mertens maneuvered past Fiorentina’s backline before slotting the ball home, marking his 27th goal of the season. This powerful strike in the 65th minute brought the score to 4-1.\n\nAs the minutes ticked on, Napoli managed the game efficiently. They brought on substitutes like Amadou Diawara and Marco Rog to maintain control and see the match through. Fiorentina did press for another goal, trying to capitalize on some zonal weaknesses in Napoli’s defense, but Reina remained vigilant, making several saves to keep the scoreline in favor of Napoli.\n\nBabacar had a golden opportunity to score his second when he found himself one-on-one with Reina. However, Reina stood tall and denied the Fiorentina forward, further cementing his position as one of the game’s standout performers.\n\nThe match ended with Napoli’s fans in full voice, celebrating a dominating performance. With this victory, Napoli showcased their exceptional blend of skill, speed, and tactical prowess. Fiorentina, on the other hand, faced a reality check and acknowledged the need for significant changes, especially with the impending departure of their coach, Paulo Sousa.\n\nIn summary, this encounter not only highlighted Napoli’s attacking brilliance and Mertens’ deadly finishing but also underscored their defensive resilience led by Reina and Koulibaly. Fiorentina's sporadic resilience was not enough to match Napoli’s consistent pressure and tactical execution. A thoroughly enjoyable game for the Napoli faithful, and a stark reminder for Fiorentina of the gap they need to bridge to challenge the Italian elite."
