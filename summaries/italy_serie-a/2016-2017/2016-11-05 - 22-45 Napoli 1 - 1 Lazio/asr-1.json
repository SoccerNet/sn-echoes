    "input": "\n    Napoli 1 - 1 Lazio\n\nFirst Half:\n\n0:0 Comment: We spent a lot of time seeing off our team on their way out.\n0:3 Comment: It was at Rome's Termina station, where several hundred fans gathered.\n0:8 Comment: It looked as if the team was being escorted to the Champions League final.\n0:12 Comment: Torches, fireworks, chanting, a wild crowd of roaring people.\n0:17 Comment: The police laid a special corridor from the bus to the station building.\n0:22 Comment: And just like that, the fans, inspired by how the team was playing in the championship, saw it off.\n0:27 Comment: Because these fuziers still don’t go to a home match.\n0:29 Comment: And they continue to conflict with the president of the club, Lotit.\n0:34 Comment: Latso Chiroy Mobili is in attack. Shot on goal straight into the hands of Pepe Rein.\n0:38 Comment: You said the right thing about, naturally, the enthusiasm that Lazo fans have.\n0:43 Comment: They are very happy with the way the team is playing.\n0:46 Comment: Dissatisfied with the management, but at the same time happy with the work of Simone Inzaghi.\n0:50 Comment: On the field, in attack, a dangerous moment. Strike and...\n0:53 Comment: But Merton could now get into the corner and open the scoring.\n0:55 Comment: Center forward or not center forward, that’s a different matter.\n0:58 Comment: Yes, that’s for sure that he is an excellent striker.\n1:2 Comment: I couldn't be happier with Dries Mertons, who has finally been given a place in the starting line-up.\n1:6 Comment: Because I've said this many times in previous seasons.\n1:10 Comment: When Merton sat with other coaches even before Sari in the reserve.\n1:13 Comment: And then he came out, then he didn’t come out.\n1:15 Comment: I have always repeated that, in my opinion, this is a player in the main team of almost any high-quality team.\n1:21 Comment: And if he doesn’t make it into the lineup here, let him play.\n1:23 Comment: Rent it, sell it.\n1:25 Comment: But not good for football, not even for Naples.\n1:28 Comment: Good for football.\n1:29 Comment: Such a talented player who really brightens up the game with his unconventional actions.\n1:35 Comment: Marinate in reserve.\n1:36 Comment: But now he is playing and shot brilliantly from under the defender.\n1:39 Comment: Marchetti would not have helped his team if the ball had gone into the corner.\n1:43 Comment: What a pass from Insinin Gulyam.\n1:45 Comment: He picks up speed.\n1:46 Comment: Good shot.\n1:47 Comment: And here it was striker Dries Mertons who lacked the skills.\n1:51 Comment: Although he showed where the pass should be made.\n1:54 Comment: But pierce the center of the forward with a bayonet, as expected.\n1:57 Comment: Now he failed to hit the goal.\n1:59 Comment: A good start.\n2:0 Comment: Cigar for 2 minutes, and already 2 shots on goal.\n2:3 Comment: And a very dangerous attack from Napoli with a cross into the penalty area by Federico Marchetti.\n2:7 Comment: Hysai.\n2:8 Comment: The Albanian defender plays for Koulibaly.\n2:12 Comment: Horsemen, in bookmaker's terms, are playing teams today.\n2:15 Comment: It is rare when matches end with Lazio and Napoli not playing against each other, but against other opponents.\n2:21 Comment: It's rare that they end up under 2 and a half.\n2:25 Comment: Therefore, we have the right to expect a productive match today.\n2:28 Comment: AND...\n2:28 Comment: From the first minutes we see that Lazio is not at all going to play as number two.\n2:32 Comment: Napoli, of course, as the home team and after a series of not entirely successful matches.\n2:36 Comment: And in fact, we played with Besiktas in the middle of the week.\n2:39 Comment: But the last result in Serie A was a defeat from Juventus.\n2:42 Comment: If we continue this line, then today Juventus and Napoli must do everything to win.\n2:48 Comment: And don’t continue the streak with the loss of points.\n2:51 Comment: That’s why we see such an aggressive start from the hosts.\n2:55 Comment: But Lazio is also higher in the table.\n2:56 Comment: Therefore, Lazio, in fact, why should it?\n2:58 Comment: Be afraid of your opponent, be shy and play only defensively.\n3:2 Comment: Corner kick. Set piece in favor of Napoli.\n3:5 Comment: Jose Maria Calijon will perform.\n3:8 Comment: Apparently, a serve into the penalty area.\n3:10 Comment: Coulibaly is here, naturally, and Maria Hamsik, and the short Lorenzo Insigni.\n3:15 Comment: Calihon's serve and serve are extremely poor.\n3:19 Comment: The ball went over everyone.\n3:23 Comment: Here he is Kalikhon.\n3:24 Comment: By the way, he scores a lot in this championship.\n3:27 Comment: And now, in the absence of Guain, it is...\n3:28 Comment: Calikhon became, in fact, the main striker in the team.\n3:33 Comment: Happy at the market.\n3:37 Comment: Oles.\n3:39 Comment: Lazio tries to control the ball, but it’s not the most convenient pass.\n3:43 Comment: Anderson tried to save the ball, but in the end it was out in favor of Napoli.\n3:48 Comment: Ghoulam.\n3:50 Comment: How Ghulyam threw out.\n3:54 Comment: Napoli are playing the ball quite well.\n3:57 Comment: But Calihon is here...\n3:58 Comment: I overestimated the situation a little.\n4:4 Comment: Beagles.\n4:5 Comment: Across the fields to Bastu.\n4:8 Comment: Indeed, Lazio have a very good series.\n4:9 Comment: And, as I already said, few people expected such a game from Simon Inzaghi’s team.\n4:15 Comment: After all the events that happened in the summer.\n4:17 Comment: There was a lot of trouble in the summer.\n4:18 Comment: Lazio continues to have problems between fans and the club's management, owner Claudio Latitto.\n4:25 Comment: But Simone Inzaghi is still an iconic figure.\n4:28 Comment: For Lazio he would not be...\n4:28 Comment: Maybe a great football player.\n4:30 Comment: But he played for Lazio.\n4:31 Comment: He was, in fact, on the team that won the Scudetto.\n4:34 Comment: The last one for Lazio in 2000.\n4:36 Comment: So, of course...\n4:37 Comment: He was always a brother.\n4:38 Comment: He was always a brother. You are right.\n4:39 Comment: But now, as a coach, Simone Inzaghi, of course, has somewhat more advantages in her career than Filippo.\n4:49 Comment: Who failed his job in Milan.\n4:50 Comment: Yes. That's why he's ahead of him here.\n4:52 Comment: And now they will say about Philip that he is a brother.\n4:55 Comment: Well, let's see.\n4:56 Comment: May be.\n4:56 Comment: Let's see again.\n4:58 Comment: Simon Inzaghi is just beginning as a coach.\n5:0 Comment: Husay will show on the right flank.\n5:1 Comment: Picks up speed.\n5:2 Comment: Lucas Bigley appears in front of him.\n5:4 Comment: Husay will serve.\n5:5 Comment: Crosses to Mertens.\n5:7 Comment: Here he gracefully leaves the ball with his heel to Insini’s partner.\n5:10 Comment: Let's go!\n5:11 Comment: Lorenzo Insini fired a volley.\n5:14 Comment: But he shot above the goal.\n5:15 Comment: Naples have a very low attack.\n5:18 Comment: Very fast, technical.\n5:19 Comment: But very low.\n5:20 Comment: Incini, Mertens and Calijon are all below average height.\n5:24 Comment: Therefore, of course, there is no point in playing on horseback.\n5:26 Comment: And the fight on the second floor.\n5:28 Comment: They will lose one hundred percent in Lazio's defense.\n5:31 Comment: But below they may well be more agile and interesting than their rivals.\n5:36 Comment: It is not by chance that they show us immobiles.\n5:37 Comment: Nine balls.\n5:38 Comment: So far he is behind only two Roman players.\n5:41 Comment: Two players from Roman clubs are leading scorers.\n5:44 Comment: This hasn't happened in a while.\n5:46 Comment: Dzeko, who finally remembered how goals are scored.\n5:48 Comment: Here and in balls he is in the lead.\n5:51 Comment: Well, Imobili has nine goals.\n5:54 Comment: Hamshek!\n5:56 Comment: Napoli captain with the ball.\n5:57 Comment: Pass to...\n5:58 Comment: Zelinsky.\n5:59 Comment: Hysai.\n6:0 Comment: Calihon.\n6:1 Comment: Napoli control the ball.\n6:2 Comment: This is the Neapolitans' strong point.\n6:5 Comment: Ability to play pass.\n6:8 Comment: Actually, Mauricio Sarri stages such a game.\n6:11 Comment: The body was set for death.\n6:13 Comment: Not bad.\n6:14 Comment: Trying to beat Wallace.\n6:15 Comment: But it didn’t work out to throw the ball between the Brazilian’s legs.\n6:19 Comment: Lazio exchanged Mauricio for Wallace very successfully.\n6:25 Comment: They got a younger Brazilian.\n6:27 Comment: Well, about the same class.\n6:28 Comment: Well, let's see.\n6:29 Comment: Still, Mauricio had big problems in Rome.\n6:33 Comment: And they didn’t count on him.\n6:34 Comment: Therefore, in fact, he was released.\n6:36 Comment: Moscow Spartak.\n6:37 Comment: Wallace is still a starter.\n6:39 Comment: And when the team wins, you also have some advantages.\n6:42 Comment: You may not be the most qualified defender.\n6:45 Comment: Coulibaly.\n6:47 Comment: Flogged and didn't handle the ball.\n6:50 Comment: Incinia plays technically.\n6:51 Comment: Lorenzo Incinia.\n6:52 Comment: Hamshek!\n6:53 Comment: Diavaran did not understand this plan.\n6:55 Comment: He puts Diavaran's leg down hard.\n6:56 Comment: You can, you can continue to play.\n6:57 Comment: Porolo.\n6:58 Comment: The immobile on the right flank opens.\n7:0 Comment: Anderson.\n7:1 Comment: Thin pass into the penalty area to Sergei Milinkovic\n7:10 Comment: Savich.\n7:11 Comment: But the Serb did not have time.\n7:12 Comment: Kirikish.\n7:13 Comment: Zelensky.\n7:14 Comment: Napoli players try to turn around all the time.\n7:15 Comment: Have taken.\n7:16 Comment: And so.\n7:30 Comment: It's funny for Napoli players to aggravate things.\n7:31 Comment: Literally cut through the defense.\n7:32 Comment: With your broadcasts.\n7:33 Comment: Doesn't always work.\n7:34 Comment: Immobile was already on the left flank.\n7:35 Comment: Vs Kirikisha Ciro Immobile.\n7:36 Comment: Beats.\n7:37 Comment: Almost beat.\n7:38 Comment: Rival Ciro Immobile.\n7:39 Comment: The ball is in play.\n7:40 Comment: You can play.\n7:41 Comment: Another one from the penalty area.\n7:42 Comment: To Keitan.\n7:43 Comment: But this time.\n7:48 Comment: Guli Bali played reliably.\n7:50 Comment: Hamshek.\n7:51 Comment: Mertens.\n7:52 Comment: Calihon.\n7:53 Comment: According to Hamshek too.\n7:54 Comment: Well, he's playing.\n7:55 Comment: We've also walked around the hamshik here quite a bit lately several times.\n8:0 Comment: Insinni is playing brilliantly now, he saw the free zone.\n8:5 Comment: But before he came across Wallace, Insinny's performance was incredible.\n8:12 Comment: With one touch he threw the ball to himself, beat his opponent on the move, but then he simply ran into big Wallace and was unable to beat him.\n8:20 Comment: Savich. Another pass behind the defenders, but Reina doesn’t come out here either.\n8:25 Comment: And Koulibaly makes a tackle against Philip Anderson.\n8:30 Comment: Live football, good speed here in Sao Paulo.\n8:34 Comment: I think few people expected this kind of start to the meeting.\n8:38 Comment: In such cases, teams play with virtually no intelligence, as they say.\n8:44 Comment: Basta. Another pass back.\n8:47 Comment: Wallace. Radu.\n8:52 Comment: Savich.\n8:54 Comment: Right.\n8:55 Comment: The wing throws the ball to Keitan.\n9:3 Comment: And another inaccurate pass into the Napoli penalty area.\n9:7 Comment: 0-0.\n9:8 Comment: No goals yet.\n9:10 Comment: But at the same time, there are quite a lot of dangerous approaches to the gate, both to the Reina gate and to the Marchetti gate.\n9:24 Comment: 10.\n9:25 Comment: Napoli plays out the match with a big territorial advantage.\n9:29 Comment: Merton could already open an account.\n9:31 Comment: Latso did not approach anyone else's goal.\n9:34 Comment: But Latso, in principle, is a team that knows how to play in attack.\n9:38 Comment: But this is still a trip where few people take points at home.\n9:42 Comment: Napoli are playing very well.\n9:43 Comment: With the exception of the defeat from Roma.\n9:46 Comment: Napoli didn't lose...\n9:49 Comment: George, this was the only defeat of Muritso Sari.\n9:53 Comment: From January.\n9:53 Comment: But the last time we lost in the cup...\n9:54 Comment: In the championship, I was talking about the championship.\n9:56 Comment: Yes, we didn’t lose in the championship.\n9:57 Comment: Therefore, playing open football here is quite risky.\n10:2 Comment: Although Besiktas won.\n10:4 Comment: I don't see how Besiktas is stronger than Latso.\n10:7 Comment: Or why Latso is worse than Besiktas.\n10:9 Comment: Hissai.\n10:12 Comment: Dangerous Gamshika.\n10:14 Comment: Mare Hamsik throws the ball into the penalty area.\n10:16 Comment: Unsuccessful.\n10:17 Comment: Not bad Kalijo.\n10:18 Comment: There will be a cross in the direction of Dries Mertens.\n10:20 Comment: But the players lacked mutual understanding a little.\n10:24 Comment: Philippe Anderso on the right flank.\n10:28 Comment: Napoleon responds with an attack.\n10:30 Comment: Already yours.\n10:32 Comment: Keita Balde vs Coulibaly.\n10:37 Comment: Beat Keith.\n10:39 Comment: But no.\n10:40 Comment: It’s not for nothing that Coulibaly is now considered almost the best.\n10:42 Comment: One of the best central instigators of Serie A.\n10:45 Comment: How confidently he plays.\n10:47 Comment: He had an exemplary match against Juventus.\n10:50 Comment: From the Italian shifts he received the highest rating as part of Napoleon.\n10:53 Comment: And this is Dries Merten.\n10:54 Comment: Mertens.\n10:55 Comment: 1-2-1 against Wallace.\n10:57 Comment: Will try to beat him.\n10:58 Comment: Shot on goal.\n11:0 Comment: Mertens hit the target.\n11:1 Comment: But in Marchetti's place.\n11:3 Comment: This is his favorite approach to strike.\n11:6 Comment: A sharp shift to the side.\n11:8 Comment: To the right.\n11:8 Comment: And immediately a sharp blow.\n11:10 Comment: Typically encircling.\n11:11 Comment: But now Mertens’s dribbling shot didn’t work out.\n11:14 Comment: There was a blow.\n11:15 Comment: Nice tight.\n11:16 Comment: But as a rule, he still manages to cut the ball.\n11:18 Comment: So that he goes to the far corner.\n11:20 Comment: And as a rule, these shots are not taken by the goalkeeper.\n11:23 Comment: Immobiles.\n11:24 Comment: No offside.\n11:25 Comment: Ciro Imobili is opening well again.\n11:28 Comment: Good pass from Keith.\n11:30 Comment: Shot on goal.\n11:32 Comment: Well, here is Latso's answer.\n11:33 Comment: What wonderful football we have in Sao Paulo.\n11:38 Comment: It's just one attack after another.\n11:41 Comment: Let's note Imobili.\n11:43 Comment: There was no offside here.\n11:44 Comment: This is clearly visible in this replay.\n11:46 Comment: The immobile opened.\n11:47 Comment: Managed to get unstuck from Kirikish.\n11:49 Comment: And then he passed to Keith Balde.\n11:52 Comment: Who shot above the goal.\n11:53 Comment: And it was a football player.\n11:55 Comment: Radu.\n11:56 Comment: Lulic.\n11:59 Comment: Another pass forward.\n12:2 Comment: And Pepperaina comes out of the gate here.\n12:6 Comment: Diavaran.\n12:8 Comment: He has essentially now forced Jorginho out of the lineup.\n12:12 Comment: Well, this was probably expected.\n12:15 Comment: The truth is probably in the longer term.\n12:16 Comment: Driesmerten became unstuck from Wallace again.\n12:18 Comment: But Belgium didn't do very well with the transfer.\n12:23 Comment: And here is Lorenzo Incinia.\n12:25 Comment: Leaving.\n12:26 Comment: Lulech.\n12:27 Comment: Merton with his head.\n12:28 Comment: Insinia played at his height.\n12:29 Comment: Against.\n12:30 Comment: No.\n12:31 Comment: Lorenzo Incinia shoots directly at goal.\n12:32 Comment: Leaving.\n12:33 Comment: It turned out to be a blow.\n12:34 Comment: And Marchetti did not take risks.\n12:35 Comment: He hit the ball in front of him.\n12:36 Comment: Another speed attack.\n12:37 Comment: This time it's Lanso Aberson.\n12:38 Comment: Transfer to Ciro Imobili.\n12:39 Comment: The immobiles are in front of him.\n12:40 Comment: In front of him is his friend Lorenzo Incinia.\n12:41 Comment: It appears.\n12:42 Comment: And really first of all.\n12:43 Comment: Was up.\n12:44 Comment: And so.\n12:45 Comment: Here.\n12:47 Comment: The attacking wing forward played quite competently\n12:59 Comment: Napoli.\n13:0 Comment: Ghoulam.\n13:1 Comment: Another shot.\n13:2 Comment: The game without a center field works perfectly for us.\n13:5 Comment: Teams do not delay in controlling the ball.\n13:11 Comment: And there is essentially no fight in the center of the field.\n13:14 Comment: Beagles.\n13:15 Comment: And this is Balde.\n13:16 Comment: Beagles.\n13:17 Comment: Well, now pass.\n13:18 Comment: Will follow back.\n13:19 Comment: Lullich.\n13:20 Comment: And a little break.\n13:21 Comment: Beagles.\n13:22 Comment: Radu.\n13:23 Comment: Captain again.\n13:24 Comment: Beagles.\n13:25 Comment: Pass to Wallace.\n13:26 Comment: Napoli took a short break at the 14th minute.\n13:37 Comment: Because the hosts were very active at these moments\n13:41 Comment: fields.\n13:42 Comment: Well, you need to take a break to catch your breath.\n13:46 Comment: It's quite normal.\n13:47 Comment: Story.\n13:48 Comment: Well, Napoli is taking a breath while Lazio is taking a breath.\n13:49 Comment: Maybe I'll turn on a little more energetically.\n13:50 Comment: But it was also not possible to do something more interesting now.\n13:51 Comment: Kirikish.\n13:52 Comment: Hisai.\n13:53 Comment: Albioli is missing from Napoli.\n13:54 Comment: That's why Kirikish is in the main lineup.\n13:55 Comment: But Albioli should be back presumably by the 14th\n14:10 Comment: tour.\n14:11 Comment: Therefore, for now Kirikish is in the main lineup.\n14:14 Comment: Well, in the absence of Albioli, about the function of a leader.\n14:15 Comment: I took on Coulibal, whom I already talked about.\n14:18 Comment: He really has very good abs in recent years\n14:19 Comment: matches.\n14:20 Comment: It plays just great.\n14:21 Comment: Albanian defender.\n14:22 Comment: Yes, I talked about what the press writes about Hamsik.\n14:23 Comment: And in general there are certain complaints about Mark.\n14:24 Comment: They believe that he should play more actively and his leadership\n14:25 Comment: show qualities more often.\n14:26 Comment: We're having a good time.\n14:27 Comment: Sumer turned around in the penalty area.\n14:28 Comment: Algerian.\n14:29 Comment: And he didn't hold the ball.\n14:30 Comment: There are 2 options.\n14:31 Comment: Plays for 2.\n14:36 Comment: It's disgusting little one here.\n14:37 Comment: Most created treffen.\n14:38 Comment: Gamshik.\n14:39 Comment: Insinia again.\n14:40 Comment: Pass back to Koulibaly.\n14:41 Comment: Well, it seems to me that it’s more difficult with a positional attack\n14:43 Comment: something will do for Lazio.\n14:49 Comment: The ghouls had to quickly try to redirect\n14:57 Comment: the ball into the penalty area after passing along the flank.\n15:0 Comment: Gamshik.\n15:1 Comment: Pass to Lorenzo Incinia.\n15:4 Comment: The center of Incinia will shift.\n15:5 Comment: A free kick, but Dries Mertens started to open up a little in the wrong direction.\n15:13 Comment: Let's watch the blow again.\n15:16 Comment: Incini got a very dangerous blow from Lorenzo.\n15:19 Comment: By the way, there was also a small conflict after, or more precisely, during the last match against Juentus, Insini and Sari.\n15:27 Comment: The thing is that Incini played wonderfully throughout the second half.\n15:30 Comment: Now there is a pause.\n15:32 Comment: We have a small team in the match.\n15:34 Comment: But at the same time, Sari replaced him.\n15:36 Comment: Sari replaced him, and no one understood the replacement.\n15:39 Comment: And Incini behaved much like the Bulgarian football player Spartak Popov.\n15:44 Comment: Approximately.\n15:45 Comment: But the funny thing is how Sari himself explained this replacement.\n15:49 Comment: He was asked at a press conference why he replaced the team's best player.\n15:52 Comment: But he said he thought three times that Incini had a muscle problem.\n15:58 Comment: And Incini told reporters in the mixed zone that he was fine, that he was healthy and had no problems.\n16:3 Comment: Certainly.\n16:4 Comment: And Sari again told him through the press that it would be better for Incini to keep quiet and not talk about topics that he doesn’t need to talk about.\n16:14 Comment: But the funny thing is that some Italian experts began to be indignant at how Sari, according to his feelings, began to make a replacement, but simply did not ask Incini through...\n16:27 Comment: Translator.\n16:28 Comment: In this case, a translator is not needed.\n16:30 Comment: Well, it’s just that Incini played on the far flank.\n16:34 Comment: On the bench.\n16:34 Comment: On the field.\n16:35 Comment: Through a partner.\n16:36 Comment: On Incini, how he feels.\n16:38 Comment: And this surprised everyone.\n16:39 Comment: And they began to write and assume that they already had some kind of conflict between Insini and Sari.\n16:45 Comment: Although, the situation seems to have calmed down more or less.\n16:48 Comment: Lazio's attack can be quite dangerous.\n16:51 Comment: Sergei Milinkovic-Saric.\n16:53 Comment: They catch him by both his shorts and his T-shirt.\n16:55 Comment: Saric kept the ball, but did not make the pass accurately.\n17:0 Comment: And Incini has zero goals.\n17:1 Comment: Therefore the problem.\n17:3 Comment: And the newspaper...\n17:4 Comment: It was a sport.\n17:5 Comment: A list of good football players was recently published.\n17:8 Comment: High quality and expensive.\n17:9 Comment: Who haven't scored a single goal so far this season.\n17:12 Comment: Georgiy, but in any case, the match against Yuvi was very easy for Insini.\n17:15 Comment: He actually played great in that game.\n17:18 Comment: And for some reason he was replaced.\n17:20 Comment: It was a question.\n17:21 Comment: Back to Incini after the corner.\n17:22 Comment: Because a chance for Lazio.\n17:23 Comment: Lazio is a little higher.\n17:25 Comment: Defenders, at least, for sure.\n17:27 Comment: More powerful than the forwards on the field that we could play against them.\n17:32 Comment: Therefore, maybe Naples will have...\n17:33 Comment: There just can't be...\n17:35 Comment: There will be a shortage of players to position each opponent correctly.\n17:41 Comment: Ball draw.\n17:42 Comment: It’s funny that with all this, as I said, Lazio decided not to serve, but played it out.\n17:46 Comment: Dushenbast.\n17:48 Comment: Serbian kick on goal.\n17:50 Comment: But the blow...\n17:52 Comment: It was something from rugby.\n17:53 Comment: Moreover, poorly executed.\n17:56 Comment: And the probability was minimal that the ball would even get into the sport.\n17:58 Comment: And this is a quick introduction of the ball into play.\n18:0 Comment: Dries Mertens!\n18:1 Comment: He's being pushed, it seems to me.\n18:3 Comment: But the referee is silent.\n18:5 Comment: But this is very strange, because Merten put his back.\n18:9 Comment: And it seemed like there was a push.\n18:11 Comment: But it appeared on TV.\n18:12 Comment: The referee was much closer to the episode.\n18:14 Comment: Plus he has an assistant who could...\n18:16 Comment: Two assistants at once.\n18:17 Comment: ...transmit information via speakerphone.\n18:23 Comment: Well, yes, too much of a picture.\n18:24 Comment: Of course, he touched Kirikish’s shoulder.\n18:28 Comment: From here it looks like he hit him.\n18:29 Comment: But it only seems so, in fact.\n18:32 Comment: As referees always teach us.\n18:33 Comment: When they talk to us they always say...\n18:36 Comment: Always remember and tell your viewers that\n18:39 Comment: that the referee sees the episode from a different angle from which you were shown the fifth replay,\n18:43 Comment: but only from one single point of view, from its own perspective in the dynamics of the episode.\n18:47 Comment: He doesn't see anything else.\n18:48 Comment: And he makes a decision only from that position, from the angle that he saw.\n18:55 Comment: Kirikish.\n18:56 Comment: Pass to Kulebali.\n18:58 Comment: Further to the left flank, to Gulyama.\n19:2 Comment: Gabzhik.\n19:2 Comment: Ghulyam again.\n19:3 Comment: Let's go back.\n19:6 Comment: Kirikish.\n19:8 Comment: Diawara.\n19:10 Comment: A very young Diawara, whom Napoleon acquired this summer from Bolonia.\n19:15 Comment: Well, Diawara simply stunned everyone with his performance in the last championship.\n19:20 Comment: How confidently he played his 18 years.\n19:23 Comment: Daris Merton is the one breaking the rules this time.\n19:27 Comment: But it's a push.\n19:30 Comment: This is a push.\n19:33 Comment: Kulebali.\n19:36 Comment: Insinium.\n19:43 Comment: Good play of the ball.\n19:45 Comment: Calihon.\n19:47 Comment: But this is offsite.\n19:49 Comment: This is offsite, of course.\n19:51 Comment: Larenz Insinium was offside.\n19:53 Comment: An undeniable episode.\n19:57 Comment: Although the potential of this attack was remarkable.\n19:59 Comment: Here Kalikhon could probably handle the ball himself.\n20:1 Comment: Although on repeat it’s all so obvious.\n20:3 Comment: But something like this is picking up at Napoleon.\n20:8 Comment: But it doesn't get to the heads.\n20:10 Comment: Before scoring chances, such chances may not happen 100%.\n20:13 Comment: But Mertons' chance was very close to a goal at the very beginning of the match.\n20:18 Comment: And Latso is not particularly worried about pepera yet.\n20:21 Comment: Well, Latso also had such dangerous approaches, in my opinion.\n20:25 Comment: And remember Keith Balde's shot.\n20:27 Comment: We remember the activity of Ciro Imobile.\n20:29 Comment: I think Latso will show more active football in the second half.\n20:33 Comment: Hysai.\n20:35 Comment: Long pass forward to Zelensky.\n20:38 Comment: But here Federico Marchetti plays reliably.\n20:43 Comment: Marchetti did not call up the Italian national team.\n20:45 Comment: It looks like he is saying goodbye to his status as number two in the Azuri squad.\n20:50 Comment: Firstly, Perin has completely recovered.\n20:53 Comment: Well, and probably the main one is even Donna Ruma.\n20:56 Comment: Already a national team player.\n21:3 Comment: Italy is playing against Liechtenstein, and we are showing this match.\n21:8 Comment: Well, definitely with Liechtenstein. I don’t remember who else she plays with.\n21:11 Comment: The Italians have a future friendly match against the German team.\n21:14 Comment: But this is a friendly game.\n21:16 Comment: By the way, young Danilo Catalti, who is in reserve today, has been called up from Latso.\n21:20 Comment: Central midfielder. He is only 22 years old.\n21:23 Comment: And in general, the Italians are pleased that Giampiro Ventura is gradually renewing the team.\n21:29 Comment: Italy has a very difficult group in qualifying for the World Cup.\n21:32 Comment: But Ventura still wants to not only ride on Conto’s luggage, but also create his own team.\n21:37 Comment: And try to get through to the World Championships in Russia with her.\n21:40 Comment: By the way, it’s interesting that today, since in the context of Italian football and, in fact, the national team,\n21:44 Comment: Today Türkiye started matches between Torino and Kaleri.\n21:47 Comment: Torino won 5-1. Bravo to Sinisa Mihajlovic's team.\n21:51 Comment: And the three young Italians scored again.\n21:53 Comment: Firstly, Pelotti scored two. Probably the Italians have the main hope of attack in the coming years.\n21:59 Comment: And Habeke, Pazelli and Penalty also scored.\n22:2 Comment: Dangerous moment. Tamara Hamsik leaves the ball to Mertens.\n22:7 Comment: But Lanzo's defenders read the situation.\n22:10 Comment: And ending with the topic of the Italian national team.\n22:12 Comment: The former head coach of the Italian national team today came out on top in the English Championship.\n22:16 Comment: 5-0.\n22:18 Comment: Yes, well, the fifth clean sheet was in the English Championship.\n22:23 Comment: Arkady Shmelik in the stands of the San Powello stadium.\n22:30 Comment: You were right at the beginning of the report.\n22:32 Comment: But, of course, the loss of Milek is significant for Napoli.\n22:39 Comment: Still, whatever one may say, he was the only such a pronounced central striker after the departure of Goncal Higuain.\n22:47 Comment: The speech of Aurelio de Laurentiis on November 2 was significant, I would even say programmatic.\n22:54 Comment: He performed on local Neapolitan radio.\n22:57 Comment: Well, as Italian colleagues joke, he acted as president in several capacities.\n23:2 Comment: Firstly, the head coach.\n23:4 Comment: Secondly, the sports director thirdly.\n23:6 Comment: That is, Aurelio de Laurentiis spoke for everyone.\n23:9 Comment: He chided Sari for using, in De Laurentiis's opinion, the wrong tactics, in which the hamshik cannot be revealed.\n23:16 Comment: And that gamshika should be used much closer to the attack.\n23:19 Comment: The Napoli patron advised his head coach on the radio.\n23:23 Comment: Well, in addition, transfer Aurelio de Laurentiis revealed an interesting secret.\n23:27 Comment: Although Nobel knows very well that the words “yes and that’s all” are not needed.\n23:32 Comment: Although Italy also knows that the words “yes and that’s all” must be divided by 10 at a minimum.\n23:38 Comment: Now a penalty and a yellow card.\n23:40 Comment: And he said, just discussing the problems in the attack,\n23:45 Comment: said that they wanted to take Abumiyang, they had been watching him for three years.\n23:53 Comment: But then there’s an interesting explanation.\n23:55 Comment: He doesn't fit Sari's game model.\n23:58 Comment: Yes, they say, Sari abandoned Abumiyang, although it is clear that this is an even bigger thing.\n24:2 Comment: But these are not your questions.\n24:3 Comment: Vasily himself, Pierre Eric, would not have begged to move.\n24:6 Comment: No, this was also explained by the fact that he had very high salary demands.\n24:10 Comment: But the wording that he does not fit into Sari’s scheme, of course, sounds at least ridiculous.\n24:15 Comment: And only with a sense of humor, in my opinion, can one approach such a statement.\n24:21 Comment: But De Laurentiis is a creative person.\n24:23 Comment: He is a famous film producer, so maybe he played for the audience.\n24:27 Comment: We have a free kick.\n24:28 Comment: Dries Mertens on the ball. Good distance.\n24:30 Comment: I think he will spin the ball over the wall.\n24:33 Comment: Belgian midfielder. That is how it is. Hit!\n24:36 Comment: He showed that the ball had gone through the hole in the net. And the score is 1-0.\n24:40 Comment: But no, these are Marketi’s evil eyes. They explain everything.\n24:44 Comment: He is unhappy with how the wall played. She basically fell apart.\n24:47 Comment: We need a repeat, probably from a different point. Here with this one.\n24:50 Comment: Yes, the ball flew between the players into the middle of the wall.\n24:53 Comment: Just like that, he flew straight into the middle of this wall.\n24:56 Comment: And moreover, because of this it is angular.\n24:58 Comment: The recorder was there.\n25:0 Comment: Standard position. Ghulyam and Kalyahon are on the ball.\n25:3 Comment: One of them will serve. I think it is unlikely that there will be a prank in this situation.\n25:10 Comment: Yes, Ghulyam. Alzhiris Ghulam serves.\n25:13 Comment: But there's no one here. There is no number nine here for all intents and purposes.\n25:18 Comment: A big, stately striker. Dries Mertens is hardly an assistant in such a game.\n25:23 Comment: It’s strange that Yeseni didn’t react to this pass.\n25:26 Comment: In principle, you could try it and make it in time.\n25:29 Comment: If only he had moved a little earlier.\n25:31 Comment: Yes, the absence of a large grandson. Higuain was also not oversized.\n25:36 Comment: But the team played differently. Higuain is a true finisher.\n25:39 Comment: And it was clear how to organize the attack in order to bring Higuain to the finishing blow.\n25:47 Comment: It cannot be said that he plays very well with his body.\n25:49 Comment: But it cannot be said that he was too good on the second floor.\n25:53 Comment: Bastan. Parolo. Parolo easily beat Gumshoe.\n25:59 Comment: Paro, who is in the middle.\n26:1 Comment: Killed Mobili, Kakhmashik, in essence, mockingly.\n26:4 Comment: Ciro Amobili and DiAvara.\n26:6 Comment: In all his brilliance, he played very competently.\n26:8 Comment: He took the ball cleanly.\n26:10 Comment: And this is a violation of the rules. Handball by Lucas Bigley.\n26:13 Comment: Yes, so that's the problem in general.\n26:15 Comment: The problem is that there is no player who could catch the ball for Naples in attack.\n26:21 Comment: Mertens, Kalijon and Yeseni, they are very good at speed.\n26:24 Comment: But when they are in a positional attack, it is quite easy to take the ball away from them when they get it to the side.\n26:29 Comment: it is forbidden. This is true.\n26:31 Comment: Put your back and go without breaking\n26:33 Comment: You can’t take it away from him, you can’t take it away. You won't get close\n26:35 Comment: just to the ball. Zelinsky on Gamshik.\n26:37 Comment: One touch is a good idea\n26:39 Comment: this story of Hamshik and Lichon.\n26:41 Comment: But the Latso players read the episode.\n26:43 Comment: Next is Kelta Balde.\n26:47 Comment: First season\n26:47 Comment: for real, yes, he plays mainly in the lineup\n26:49 Comment: regularly. Winzaghi had just started playing.\n26:52 Comment: Well, essentially, yes. Although already in the past\n26:53 Comment: year it was clear that this was one of the main\n26:55 Comment: hopes Latso\n26:57 Comment: for the coming years.\n26:59 Comment: This is a violation of the rules. Hysai on the lawn.\n27:2 Comment: It was necessary to show yellow and correctly\n27:4 Comment: do referee because already\n27:5 Comment: the ball was out of play\n27:7 Comment: and Parola rolled up for unknown reasons\n27:9 Comment: behind\n27:10 Comment: under the opponent\n27:13 Comment: and could have caused him injury.\n27:15 Comment: Marco Parola played rather rudely. Also, by the way,\n27:17 Comment: called up to the Italian national team\n27:18 Comment: at the next match with Cuadro Azura.\n27:22 Comment: But he's one of the veterans\n27:23 Comment: and one of the oldest\n27:25 Comment: Latso players. Latso has enough lineup\n27:28 Comment: young.\n27:29 Comment: And Parola here is considered one of\n27:32 Comment: leaders, although the captain's\n27:33 Comment: Argentinean Bigley has a headband.\n27:36 Comment: But Parola\n27:38 Comment: along with him\n27:39 Comment: one of those people who solve problems\n27:42 Comment: in the locker room. 31 year. In Italian\n27:44 Comment: by standards this is nothing. But by the standards\n27:46 Comment: Latso is already a player, one might say\n27:47 Comment: at the age of the current Latso.\n27:52 Comment: Miren Kricsovic on Biglio.\n27:54 Comment: He is perfumed on Basta.\n27:56 Comment: Changed Basti's position\n27:57 Comment: Simone Inzaghi. If\n27:59 Comment: Previously, Basta played all over the edge,\n28:2 Comment: then now he’s more likely\n28:3 Comment: plays\n28:5 Comment: right central defender Dushin Basta.\n28:8 Comment: Or plays from the edge, but especially forward\n28:9 Comment: does not go. Glaren Signy receives the ball.\n28:12 Comment: It seems to me that Basta has not yet gotten used to it\n28:14 Comment: with this position. Now this is the corridor\n28:16 Comment: Insigny almost burst in.\n28:18 Comment: Boris is ahead of the curve\n28:20 Comment: plays and gets... Well, you have to wait it out now\n28:21 Comment: Latso. 3 in 3. Finally they succeed\n28:23 Comment: speed attack. Philip Anderson with the ball.\n28:26 Comment: But you also need to play the ball. Very\n28:27 Comment: Brazil is waiting for a long time until everything...\n28:29 Comment: will return to defense. And then he stuck the ball\n28:31 Comment: into the whale's penalty area.\n28:34 Comment: I accepted it, but you see, already\n28:35 Comment: eight on the field. Behind the ball line here\n28:37 Comment: Nothing will definitely work out right away.\n28:40 Comment: However, Latso's attack continues.\n28:42 Comment: Ciro Imobili. They whistle at him. Although\n28:43 Comment: I don't understand why he always\n28:45 Comment: confesses his love\n28:47 Comment: local public. Immobile again.\n28:50 Comment: Although they probably whistle at the entire Latso team.\n28:51 Comment: And not specifically Ciro.\n28:55 Comment: Ghoulam.\n28:56 Comment: Pepperine.\n28:58 Comment: Yes, whistle\n28:59 Comment: stopped. Kirkish.\n29:2 Comment: Here. Kirkish with the ball.\n29:4 Comment: Diawara.\n29:7 Comment: To Gamshik. Hamshik has a chance\n29:9 Comment: accelerate. Although options\n29:11 Comment: there's not much ahead. Lorenzo Incini\n29:13 Comment: receives the ball. Peter Zelinsky.\n29:20 Comment: In one touch I wanted to play Incini.\n29:23 Comment: Exacerbate the situation. It didn't work out.\n29:25 Comment: Lorenzo Incini again.\n29:29 Comment: And pass back to Coulibaly.\n29:32 Comment: Half an hour is behind us in Naples.\n29:35 Comment: No goals yet.\n29:36 Comment: 0-0. Kirkish.\n29:38 Comment: Left.\n29:41 Comment: Gamshik.\n29:42 Comment: Again with the night Marin Hamsik.\n29:44 Comment: Diawara.\n29:47 Comment: And that is all.\n29:48 Comment: Indeed, positionally\n29:50 Comment: Napoleon's attack fails.\n29:52 Comment: It is explainable. Actually, Georgy already talked about this\n29:54 Comment: reasoned.\n29:59 Comment: Marketing.\n30:6 Comment: Yes, somehow the pace of the game dropped.\n30:7 Comment: 30 minutes. First 15 minutes\n30:9 Comment: looked much more interesting than\n30:11 Comment: the next 15. So we tried\n30:12 Comment: Neapolitans impudently\n30:14 Comment: take your opponent\n30:16 Comment: for the gills. But it didn't work out.\n30:19 Comment: Latso is really a very decent team.\n30:21 Comment: He is playing well this season.\n30:23 Comment: And now Mobile. First chance in the penalty area.\n30:25 Comment: By the way, he handled the ball well.\n30:27 Comment: And he even struck. But the gate came out.\n30:29 Comment: What didn't work out?\n30:29 Comment: They don't whistle incomprehensibly.\n30:31 Comment: Ciro and Mobile have a chance\n30:33 Comment: beat your own today\n30:34 Comment: record. He\n30:37 Comment: plays for Turin, scored in five matches\n30:39 Comment: contract.\n30:41 Comment: Now he has the same one\n30:43 Comment: statistics. In five games in a row\n30:45 Comment: Ciro and Mobile scored in the series.\n30:47 Comment: Will score today. He really\n30:50 Comment: a new bar for yourself\n30:51 Comment: will personally ask.\n30:54 Comment: Let's see. I think the chances are\n30:55 Comment: Ciro will certainly have them.\n30:59 Comment: This is Reina.\n31:2 Comment: Said after the match in Istanbul\n31:6 Comment: Reina about that\n31:8 Comment: There was only one team playing on the field.\n31:11 Comment: This is not Besiktas.\n31:13 Comment: I am hinting that Besiktas was only fighting back.\n31:15 Comment: But, in any case, Napoli lost during the match and\n31:18 Comment: with great difficulty, in the end, I equalized something\n31:21 Comment: in the Champions League Game.\n31:23 Comment: It is very important for Napoli to qualify for the playoffs\n31:26 Comment: both in image, and in status, and, of course, in money.\n31:29 Comment: Because this is a very important time so that he doesn't score.\n31:29 Comment: that these are millions that will be needed for Laurentiis.\n31:33 Comment: His body will be rearranged.\n31:35 Comment: Bite here pushed him, it seemed to me.\n31:38 Comment: But Arbiter Damata is silent.\n31:39 Comment: Somehow he lost the ball very easily in front of him.\n31:43 Comment: And another violation of the rules.\n31:48 Comment: On Zelinsky.\n31:49 Comment: Kirikesh.\n31:50 Comment: Gamshik walked away.\n31:52 Comment: Back Marik Hamshik.\n31:53 Comment: And again he passed to Laurents Insini.\n31:55 Comment: Incini plays technically, handling the ball.\n31:57 Comment: Literally in the air again Insini.\n32:0 Comment: He can get through.\n32:1 Comment: No, Insini let the ball go far away from him.\n32:3 Comment: Gamshik.\n32:4 Comment: Turning kick.\n32:6 Comment: Defenders block.\n32:7 Comment: Bustle.\n32:9 Comment: Penalty lactation.\n32:11 Comment: Kirikesh.\n32:11 Comment: And breaking the rules.\n32:13 Comment: Who fouled?\n32:14 Comment: Because both players are on the lawn.\n32:15 Comment: And a question.\n32:19 Comment: Imobili and Qusai are still relevant.\n32:24 Comment: Rather, Qusay pushed Ciro Imobili.\n32:27 Comment: Well, then there was a collision.\n32:28 Comment: Very unpleasant.\n32:30 Comment: For two football players.\n32:34 Comment: Here he is.\n32:36 Comment: Aurelio Deloretis.\n32:37 Comment: And, by the way, to his right is Arkady Ushmilik.\n32:41 Comment: Polish striker on the field.\n32:44 Comment: Only in the spring will we see him on the field.\n32:46 Comment: Well, there are those who assume that it will be earlier.\n32:49 Comment: In February.\n32:50 Comment: But this is still hard to believe.\n32:51 Comment: I'm sitting very seriously.\n32:52 Comment: Arkady Ushmilik is injured.\n32:57 Comment: Lots of struggle.\n33:11 Comment: In today's match.\n33:13 Comment: But we also see how Uli Bali acts qualitatively in moments.\n33:19 Comment: Well, not in vain.\n33:20 Comment: No wonder Chelsea offered 60 million euros for him in the summer.\n33:24 Comment: For this football player of the central member of Napoli.\n33:27 Comment: But that's not true.\n33:34 Comment: Radu.\n33:35 Comment: Another pass back.\n33:37 Comment: Both Hysaj and the Immobiles return to the field.\n33:39 Comment: No problem.\n33:41 Comment: Both are healthy.\n33:46 Comment: Lulic.\n33:47 Comment: This is Radu.\n33:48 Comment: I'm sorry.\n33:49 Comment: Radu plays back.\n33:51 Comment: On Federico Marchetti.\n33:52 Comment: And he is already trying to do...\n33:55 Comment: And makes an accurate pass.\n33:56 Comment: Excellent pass.\n33:57 Comment: went to the market on Anderson just casually\n34:1 Comment: and the ghouls gave orders in this episode\n34:6 Comment: Coulibaly\n34:11 Comment: kaleidou coulibaly here is kirikesh\n34:16 Comment: website\n34:20 Comment: devil\n34:23 Comment: Hirsai and there are no options, I have to play backwards\n34:28 Comment: Koulibaly with the ball again\n34:34 Comment: attacked now has an obvious advantage in ball control\n34:37 Comment: inteni substitute did not catch\n34:43 Comment: transfer direction Lanqin blue of course from him\n34:46 Comment: the main threat comes from dressmeier gums turning one more\n34:50 Comment: remove the snider from the goal\n34:52 Comment: A\n34:53 Comment: ,\n34:53 Comment: but they were already covered here and the hair would become quite mortal yet\n34:57 Comment: cope although it is not an easy task to play against such an opponent\n35:0 Comment: proficient and a great hitter, but so far he manages more or less in the majority\n35:7 Comment: the situation is that gulama got it in the previous episode but it’s okay\n35:11 Comment: 10 minutes before the break at zero as so far disappointing performance\n35:15 Comment: we promised goals and where are they Nobel Kal is where there are no goals yet but come on goals\n35:20 Comment: but personally, the tension keeps me playing\n35:23 Comment: however where are you\n35:24 Comment: let me hope soon\n35:25 Comment: there will be but\n35:27 Comment: not always the most important thing in football, but why did you call me where are the goals?\n35:30 Comment: We are waiting for them in San Paulo, while they were running with the ball, the groove behind the back of the Napoli defender turned left to the flag, but there was no one there\n35:41 Comment: there is one paw of the river sh Arina there is a funny inscription people's sector on the left on the podium on\n35:49 Comment: the floor in general is especially\n35:53 Comment: Especially the fans, especially the city.\n35:55 Comment: The city in particular, today the newspaper “Delosport” was partially translated about it by a Polish team of journalists.\n36:4 Comment: There was one Polish edition in Naples.\n36:7 Comment: Well, naturally, the material was dedicated to Milik and Zelensk, and the city in which they live.\n36:13 Comment: And the Poles simply bombed the city to smithereens.\n36:19 Comment: This is very impartial, they spoke about him, they described him very ugly.\n36:24 Comment: In particular, he wrote that it is simply impossible to imagine or find a dirtier city in Europe.\n36:32 Comment: It is explainable. It's all about the mafia, as you understand.\n36:36 Comment: But about this, probably, in another broadcast, but not at the time.\n36:39 Comment: We, unlike you, Nobel, don’t understand anything about the mafia, so tell us what you meant.\n36:43 Comment: George, this is a well-known story in the Neapolitan and Sicilian mafia.\n36:47 Comment: And how can you force the authorities to work with the mafia?\n36:52 Comment: Only with the help of companies that introduce waste.\n36:54 Comment: If you don't introduce garbage, the city begins to die.\n36:58 Comment: Therefore, the mafia almost always takes advantage of this.\n37:1 Comment: But everyone knows that this is the Neapolitan and Sicilian mafia.\n37:5 Comment: Therefore, this is probably where the garbage comes from.\n37:11 Comment: But Napoleon was praised.\n37:13 Comment: Even the meaning of the material in this search was that\n37:16 Comment: that how in such hell can someone like this appear...\n37:21 Comment: such heavenly places in which Naples lives and flourishes.\n37:26 Comment: Naples is a wonderful city.\n37:28 Comment: I don't know how you feel about him.\n37:30 Comment: I was there once.\n37:31 Comment: It is clear that he is very peculiar.\n37:33 Comment: Yes, it is not the cleanest, to put it mildly.\n37:35 Comment: But there is the most delicious pizza, friends, in Naples.\n37:39 Comment: This is nonsense, this is Nobel.\n37:40 Comment: Just nonsense.\n37:41 Comment: It's not the tastiest there.\n37:42 Comment: Good good.\n37:43 Comment: This stereotype.\n37:45 Comment: Fine.\n37:45 Comment: In the meantime, Maria Gavsh is playing.\n37:46 Comment: Yes.\n37:48 Comment: Left flag.\n37:49 Comment: Nepol has many advantages.\n37:51 Comment: It seems to me.\n37:52 Comment: Dries Mertens with the ball.\n37:55 Comment: Ghulyama connects.\n37:57 Comment: Mertens again.\n37:57 Comment: Inaccurate transmission.\n37:59 Comment: And here is the ball selection.\n38:1 Comment: Diawara.\n38:2 Comment: Passed again to the left flank.\n38:7 Comment: Dries Mertens simply went straight, trying to beat the three.\n38:12 Comment: It didn't work out.\n38:13 Comment: Although such a trick.\n38:15 Comment: I hit Burlin.\n38:16 Comment: Costs.\n38:17 Comment: Today is the match Ufa-Rubin.\n38:19 Comment: He scored a very beautiful goal.\n38:22 Comment: Literally five opponents will pass.\n38:25 Comment: Well, it's almost time for a break.\n38:27 Comment: It's approaching halftime.\n38:29 Comment: And the score is still 0-0, which quite suits Lazio to strategically play the first half like Lazio played to zero.\n38:36 Comment: And in the second, maybe try to do something offensively.\n38:42 Comment: Gavshik.\n38:44 Comment: Pass to Hysaj.\n38:46 Comment: Again, throw the ball behind your back.\n38:50 Comment: Zelinsky shot.\n38:51 Comment: Dangerous moment.\n38:53 Comment: No, it didn't work out.\n38:54 Comment: Neither Mertens nor Isinia.\n38:55 Comment: But Basta carefully guarded this zone, where the ball bounced and where Isiny ran.\n39:0 Comment: And he was first on the ball.\n39:1 Comment: But it was very dangerous.\n39:2 Comment: It was very dangerous in this situation.\n39:4 Comment: They fled to the right flank.\n39:5 Comment: Here Marco Parrow is picking up speed.\n39:8 Comment: There's Anderson on the right.\n39:9 Comment: But the whole team had already attacked.\n39:11 Comment: Returned to defense.\n39:12 Comment: That's why Lazio hasn't been able to achieve anything at speed yet.\n39:15 Comment: Although this is due to individual actions.\n39:17 Comment: Philip Anderson can try to do something.\n39:19 Comment: But just a corner.\n39:21 Comment: Ghulyam played under Katya.\n39:23 Comment: There are about five minutes left in the half.\n39:25 Comment: A little more, probably.\n39:27 Comment: Plus the referee will add.\n39:28 Comment: Another minute or two.\n39:30 Comment: And this is a pass.\n39:31 Comment: Zelinsky's direction.\n39:33 Comment: And a shot.\n39:33 Comment: I wanted to bend my head.\n39:35 Comment: Initially this cross, half serve.\n39:39 Comment: Mertens's address, but it didn't work out.\n39:42 Comment: The corner is a very important point.\n39:43 Comment: 40th minute.\n39:44 Comment: It will be interesting for Lazio to serve now.\n39:46 Comment: Or again.\n39:47 Comment: They'll play a prank.\n39:50 Comment: Submission, submission.\n39:51 Comment: Run!\n39:53 Comment: Almost for the first time, Reyna entered the game for real.\n39:59 Comment: And there, forward.\n40:1 Comment: Reina knocks the ball out.\n40:2 Comment: But here the buster is stuffy.\n40:12 Comment: Zelinsky.\n40:13 Comment: I placed a treasure.\n40:14 Comment: Peter Zelinsky.\n40:15 Comment: AND...\n40:16 Comment: Negotiation.\n40:17 Comment: Milinkovic, I could not even stomp the yellow one.\n40:19 Comment: By the way, with great difficulty, Napolei Zelinsky was persuaded to join his team.\n40:25 Comment: Almost President Deloretti did this.\n40:27 Comment: The fact is that, having excellent press following the results of these two and a half years in Italy.\n40:33 Comment: Zelinsky played for Aimpol and Udinese.\n40:35 Comment: A very talented Pole.\n40:37 Comment: Zelinsky really wanted to move to Liverpool.\n40:39 Comment: Because there was interest from the British.\n40:41 Comment: But there were long negotiations.\n40:43 Comment: Zelinsky didn't want to.\n40:44 Comment: I was moving on.\n40:45 Comment: Got to Liverpool.\n40:46 Comment: But Delo Vorentis managed to convince Zelinsky to choose something other than Apol.\n40:51 Comment: And now Zelinsky is starting more and more often.\n40:57 Comment: Damato ran to Inzaghi.\n41:1 Comment: Explains something about the episode that raised questions from Inzaghi.\n41:6 Comment: But so, in a very correct form.\n41:7 Comment: Inzaghi is, surprisingly, not Italian at all.\n41:12 Comment: Not like a brother.\n41:13 Comment: My brother was completely different.\n41:14 Comment: Quite the opposite.\n41:15 Comment: On the Milan bench.\n41:16 Comment: Emotionally.\n41:17 Comment: He always appealed to the players, to the opponent, to the referees.\n41:20 Comment: But Simone is a little phlegmatic.\n41:23 Comment: Coulibaly.\n41:27 Comment: Kirikesh.\n41:29 Comment: Coulibaly.\n41:30 Comment: Continue the attack.\n41:32 Comment: Pass to Garmshik.\n41:36 Comment: Through Gulam.\n41:37 Comment: They played the ball.\n41:38 Comment: Lorenzo Insine is already here.\n41:41 Comment: We have to play backwards again.\n41:45 Comment: And already in the loss of the ball.\n41:47 Comment: Botsurg defends very competently with almost the entire team.\n41:51 Comment: Diawara.\n41:57 Comment: Pass back.\n41:58 Comment: To Coulibaly.\n41:59 Comment: Kirikesh.\n42:4 Comment: Hysai.\n42:5 Comment: I waited.\n42:7 Comment: Transfer by Hysai.\n42:8 Comment: Calihon in one touch.\n42:10 Comment: And you throw out.\n42:11 Comment: The Spaniard earned it.\n42:12 Comment: Kalikhon seemed lost in the first half.\n42:14 Comment: Merton and Insigne were much more active in the first half of the match.\n42:20 Comment: Kirikesh.\n42:21 Comment: Plays left.\n42:23 Comment: Kuliam is here.\n42:25 Comment: 65 to 35 in possession.\n42:29 Comment: In favor of Naples, of course.\n42:32 Comment: Incine.\n42:33 Comment: Garmshik.\n42:34 Comment: It's difficult to crack Lazio's defense here.\n42:37 Comment: And Parolo takes the ball.\n42:39 Comment: And Mobiles.\n42:41 Comment: Easily escaped Diawar.\n42:42 Comment: But Diawara.\n42:44 Comment: Perhaps Mobile had the extra touch.\n42:46 Comment: Workshops.\n42:48 Comment: Football player, yes.\n42:49 Comment: I made an extra movement.\n42:50 Comment: Mobile also made an extra move.\n42:51 Comment: As a result, he was robbed.\n42:52 Comment: This was already a risk for the Lazio players.\n42:53 Comment: We almost brought ourselves a moment now.\n42:54 Comment: At the 43rd minute, Lazioli only had 2 minutes left to wait until the break.\n42:55 Comment: But here's Keitan.\n42:56 Comment: Prompt.\n42:57 Comment: However, Kirikesh is first on the ball.\n42:58 Comment: And now Lazio has a chance.\n42:59 Comment: And it's yellow.\n43:0 Comment: Kuliam is wrong.\n43:1 Comment: And now Lazio has a chance.\n43:2 Comment: And it's yellow.\n43:3 Comment: Kuliam is wrong.\n43:4 Comment: And now Lazio has a chance.\n43:5 Comment: This rarely happens to him, but there is a mistake here.\n43:13 Comment: Actually a yellow card.\n43:16 Comment: I will be very surprised if the referee doesn't show it.\n43:20 Comment: It’s not like Damato is going to warn, although this\n43:27 Comment: failure of the attack.\n43:28 Comment: And very dangerous.\n43:29 Comment: OK.\n43:30 Comment: At Damato's discretion.\n43:32 Comment: Referee for today's match.\n43:34 Comment: And the last ball.\n43:35 Comment: Let's see how Latso plays this free kick.\n43:50 Comment: 33 meters, a little more.\n43:53 Comment: To the gate.\n43:54 Comment: And Lucas Bigley, captain of Latso, Argentinean.\n43:59 Comment: With a very good shot and a good serve.\n44:4 Comment: Headbutt.\n44:5 Comment: Sergei Milinkovic Sarich.\n44:9 Comment: Another young football player.\n44:11 Comment: Serb.\n44:12 Comment: He struck with his head, but higher.\n44:18 Comment: Tatareina.\n44:19 Comment: Sarik.\n44:21 Comment: What options do you have...\n44:23 Comment: Gabiadini.\n44:24 Comment: Sarik.\n44:25 Comment: Gabiadini.\n44:26 Comment: He served his suspension.\n44:27 Comment: This is Ghulyam picking up speed.\n44:28 Comment: It could be a dangerous attack.\n44:30 Comment: But Ghulyam runs into Biglia.\n44:32 Comment: He didn’t collapse himself, so there won’t be a penalty.\n44:35 Comment: And Gabiadini.\n44:36 Comment: The whole question is how much he will come out for the half.\n44:38 Comment: And instead of whom.\n44:39 Comment: Or during the second half.\n44:41 Comment: But for now, here are Mobiles with the ball.\n44:43 Comment: Badly.\n44:45 Comment: There is also Omar El Kadoury.\n44:48 Comment: But he is more of a player in the attack group.\n44:50 Comment: He can certainly freshen up the game on the field.\n44:54 Comment: Although, in principle, Zelensky, Sinaya, and Kalikhon are quite active.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Sari and the representative Slovak football player is completely lost in this arrangement.\n0:4 Comment: And here you can really make fun of the statements of Aurelio de Laurentiis as much as you like,\n0:10 Comment: blame him for some kind of eccentricity and emotionality, but in fact he is absolutely right in this sense.\n0:18 Comment: With previous mentors, Hamshik, although Benitez raised him, put him in the reserve,\n0:25 Comment: I tried to prove something to the team captain there and somehow change his game,\n0:32 Comment: even for the better, I don’t know what Benitez wanted to do with Hamshik,\n0:37 Comment: but Hamsik played much brighter in previous NAPO schemes.\n0:55 Comment: Basta, Basta got confused, Insini robbed him, Aurels Insini, but here Basta himself is already correcting himself,\n1:3 Comment: plays well, plays cleanly in tackling, Aderson, Basta, shoots forward,\n1:9 Comment: Keito, as he put it, Keith Balde's body and broke the rules,\n1:15 Comment: in previous revolutions, the central defender, who, I repeat, is really in great shape,\n1:24 Comment: and the match against Yuen.\n1:25 Comment: This was the very confirmation in the last round.\n1:27 Comment: NAPO played very well in Turin and actually lost only one episode,\n1:32 Comment: due to the quality play of Hansal Higuain, who scored the decisive goal.\n1:40 Comment: The ghouls get the ball.\n1:44 Comment: Latso, Aderson, Lukas Migla, one touch, immobil direction, but here Hysaj is in place.\n1:50 Comment: Lurech, the immobile was passed into the penalty area before the turn,\n1:55 Comment: searched, and he didn't win.\n1:55 Comment: And so, as you can see, he didn't win, but he didn't win.\n1:55 Comment: Again!\n1:56 Comment: Derekesh had difficulty dealing with the immobil, but Chiros was already striking.\n2:4 Comment: The shot was in the first case, and it hit the goal in this case.\n2:8 Comment: Well, instead of Napoli’s moment, we saw Lazo’s moment, and the scoring moment,\n2:13 Comment: and the team's best scorer was in a position from which it would have been possible to score, I believe\n2:19 Comment: only after Rein's mistake.\n2:22 Comment: Reina is not the class goalkeeper to allow.\n2:25 Comment: He couldn't just score from the corner, so it's not that great of a save.\n2:28 Comment: The goalkeeper played simply professionally, as he should play.\n2:31 Comment: But could he have given the pass to the immobile?\n2:33 Comment: It seems to me that he had the opportunity to shoot along the goal, and now he is doing the same,\n2:38 Comment: and Reina again covers, in general, the goal gate.\n2:42 Comment: Immobile now tried to shoot into the far corner, but he made it correctly.\n2:46 Comment: Watch this replay of Keith's claims.\n2:49 Comment: It’s quite possible that there was a hit there, but it doesn’t matter because the referee didn’t blow the whistle.\n2:53 Comment: But you can’t lag behind like that.\n2:54 Comment: Why is Keita walking?\n2:56 Comment: Keita should already be in the area of ​​the last defender.\n2:59 Comment: How so?\n3:0 Comment: And immobili made a remark to him.\n3:2 Comment: But we must keep up with the attack.\n3:4 Comment: How so?\n3:4 Comment: Yes, he could open up.\n3:6 Comment: Meanwhile, Gulyan serves.\n3:8 Comment: Drismertus tried to head the short striker, but noticed he didn’t get there.\n3:14 Comment: Well, the Lants are starting to become more active, more aggressive.\n3:18 Comment: On the field.\n3:19 Comment: In the second half, and already Ciro Immobile had two episodes.\n3:23 Comment: He attacks.\n3:24 Comment: And one more.\n3:25 Comment: On the Lanza.\n3:28 Comment: Radu.\n3:30 Comment: Which way forward?\n3:31 Comment: And the ball goes out of bounds.\n3:33 Comment: 49th for meetings.\n3:35 Comment: No goals yet, but quite meaningful football.\n3:42 Comment: Diawara.\n3:44 Comment: California\n3:47 Comment: Bass back to Vlad Kirikish.\n3:51 Comment: And already Kirikish plays Mara Kagamshika.\n3:53 Comment: Kulebali.\n3:54 Comment: Gulyan.\n3:55 Comment: Incinia.\n3:56 Comment: And Anderson is blocking space for Lorenzo Incinia here.\n4:11 Comment: Hysai.\n4:12 Comment: Almost all the players remained behind the ball line.\n4:16 Comment: Kulebali and Hysai are playing very closely in the center of the field now.\n4:20 Comment: He loses the ball.\n4:22 Comment: Lullich got into the pressure well.\n4:23 Comment: And now Lullich has an opportunity.\n4:25 Comment: But he beats Hysai once again.\n4:27 Comment: And just...\n4:28 Comment: No, Lullich won't even earn a corner.\n4:31 Comment: Although it was a very good idea to join this attack.\n4:36 Comment: California\n4:37 Comment: Napoli have free space.\n4:39 Comment: We need to do the bass on Lorenzo Incinia.\n4:41 Comment: Incinia receives the ball.\n4:42 Comment: In front of him, one is strangling the bass.\n4:43 Comment: But Lorenzo Incinia kicks the opponent's penalty.\n4:45 Comment: Hit.\n4:47 Comment: But now Incinia played brilliantly.\n4:49 Comment: Because I made a very unexpected decision.\n4:51 Comment: Instead of pausing.\n4:52 Comment: And here is the same maneuver that we have already seen.\n4:55 Comment: And they drew the attention of TV viewers to this in the first half.\n4:58 Comment: When he sharply puts the ball under his right foot.\n5:0 Comment: It shifts and the same sharp blow follows.\n5:2 Comment: And now it seems to be the same.\n5:4 Comment: But he saw with his peripheral vision that it was already covering his right leg.\n5:7 Comment: Now a player will appear in the frame.\n5:9 Comment: And turn there.\n5:10 Comment: It was simply to set the ball up for the opponent.\n5:12 Comment: And he shot with his near foot.\n5:13 Comment: And he shot into the far corner.\n5:15 Comment: Incinia played brilliantly now.\n5:17 Comment: But no luck.\n5:18 Comment: Magnificent Marchetti.\n5:19 Comment: And again, zero goals scored this season.\n5:21 Comment: Still at Incinia's.\n5:25 Comment: Corner kick.\n5:30 Comment: Minor controversy.\n5:31 Comment: Players from Napoleon and Lazio.\n5:34 Comment: Right now.\n5:37 Comment: The ghouls will be served.\n5:38 Comment: However, no. Yellow card.\n5:39 Comment: Yellow card for apparently doing something wrong.\n5:46 Comment: But the joy here in Korea is not even that\n5:48 Comment: some words addressed to Dumbler.\n5:51 Comment: Kirikish was simply held incorrectly.\n5:53 Comment: You can see it on this replay.\n5:55 Comment: He picked his opponent against the rules.\n5:57 Comment: That's why the Lazio player received a yellow card.\n6:1 Comment: Innings.\n6:2 Comment: And this is a blow.\n6:3 Comment: Kulebali.\n6:4 Comment: The attack continues.\n6:5 Comment: On the field. Diawara.\n6:6 Comment: Now you can break through Hysaya.\n6:8 Comment: But Hysaj is not a great master of such attacks.\n6:11 Comment: The ball, as you can see, flies out of bounds.\n6:16 Comment: Stefan Rado is cautioned.\n6:18 Comment: He was recorded.\n6:19 Comment: On this...\n6:21 Comment: Kulebali.\n6:22 Comment: Again with the ball.\n6:26 Comment: Kulebali.\n6:28 Comment: Batkirikish.\n6:29 Comment: Hysai.\n6:31 Comment: In about ten minutes we should expect Gabiedini on the field.\n6:35 Comment: Because there is no one else to let on the tart.\n6:38 Comment: I think that out of the three ahead, Kalijon is out.\n6:43 Comment: This will make it possible to move the players a little.\n6:45 Comment: Place Gabiedini in the center.\n6:47 Comment: Well, look, Gamshik.\n6:48 Comment: Where Hamshik should play.\n6:50 Comment: Please.\n6:51 Comment: And a goal!\n6:52 Comment: Marek Hamsik!\n6:53 Comment: Marek Hamsik scores in super words.\n6:54 Comment: What a proper connection.\n6:55 Comment: And then Gamshik figured out this situation.\n6:56 Comment: He has a wonderful shot with both legs and struck with his left\n6:57 Comment: to the far corner.\n6:58 Comment: 1-0.\n6:59 Comment: But more is ahead.\n7:0 Comment: Here is such a master who plays for some reason\n7:1 Comment: the coach is very far from the goal.\n7:2 Comment: Gamshik performed his only chance in the match.\n7:3 Comment: Just like he did at the beginning of the match.\n7:4 Comment: And so, as you see, Gamshik, not only does he not play,\n7:5 Comment: but also plays.\n7:6 Comment: And so, as you see, Gamshik, he plays.\n7:7 Comment: Hamshik nehadow, what a time.\n7:8 Comment: S�도 rover legs.\n7:10 Comment: Maxim is a goal for himself.\n7:12 Comment: But give an angle.\n7:13 Comment: Lets out.\n7:14 Comment: With what happened odds.\n7:15 Comment: Takes off.\n7:16 Comment: Andoohhh!\n7:17 Comment: Tease.\n7:18 Comment: Everything concerns this.\n7:19 Comment: Harry Gram.\n7:20 Comment: Needles at the back.\n7:21 Comment: D finally!\n7:22 Comment: There's one out ahead.\n7:23 Comment: Well, that's it.\n7:24 Comment: Vdeltat.\n7:25 Comment: 4 dzyynysh 50.\n7:26 Comment: Upathand.\n7:27 Comment: the left one is like a Namon hose.\n7:28 Comment: Who flew higher?\n7:29 Comment: This is the story.\n7:30 Comment: What kind of judges were they from Kazakhstan?\n7:31 Comment: Rener K Shorta kicking.\n7:32 Comment: Buzzing lay.\n7:33 Comment: As the saying goes.\n7:34 Comment: what do you need that gamshik will run forward so he left his zone threw the zone correctly\n7:40 Comment: it opened from the hit, of course it was a gamshik, it certainly opened very competently\n7:45 Comment: first of all, and then it’s a matter of his wonderful technique, here’s a great master\n7:50 Comment: chose two opponents and shot into the far corner 1 0 Napoli Napoli ahead in\n7:56 Comment: match against flange\n7:59 Comment: the dirty hamshik captain host opens the score for the match\n8:5 Comment: Let's see the reaction Scene of a decision boss\n8:22 Comment: cabele droneما that your husband can do it there\n8:27 Comment: comment\n8:28 Comment: your\n8:28 Comment: straight\n8:29 Comment: your\n8:29 Comment: The game is on, it's on.\n8:31 Comment: Great, but how did Parova play here?\n8:33 Comment: Again, note the pass initially, which was in Keith's direction.\n8:38 Comment: Of course, Keita already figured it out technically.\n8:40 Comment: Look at the pass Parova made into the penalty area to Keith.\n8:42 Comment: And then Keita took out Kirikish and shot into the near corner.\n8:46 Comment: And here, George, it’s probably Reina’s fault.\n8:49 Comment: Well, that's for sure.\n8:50 Comment: It seems to me that he himself did not expect that Keith would get such a sharp blow.\n8:53 Comment: Because, pay attention, now it will be visible.\n8:55 Comment: He beat and immediately shot at that very second.\n8:57 Comment: Almost no pause.\n8:59 Comment: And Reina did not have time to adjust to this blow.\n9:2 Comment: And, of course, the brilliant Spanish goalkeeper reproaches himself.\n9:6 Comment: Because this is his goal, of course.\n9:8 Comment: But he gives us further very interesting development of the plot.\n9:12 Comment: Because both teams feel that they can take three points from this match.\n9:17 Comment: What a different reaction there was just now.\n9:20 Comment: Literally several within two minutes.\n9:23 Comment: Muritso Sari.\n9:24 Comment: That is how it is.\n9:25 Comment: You're leading the score.\n9:26 Comment: It's like you're in complete control of the game.\n9:28 Comment: But literally in the return attack you miss the ball.\n9:31 Comment: Yes, it's calcio.\n9:32 Comment: This is Italian football.\n9:33 Comment: Everything is very unpredictable here.\n9:35 Comment: Coulibaly.\n9:36 Comment: The transmission did not reach Gulyam.\n9:45 Comment: Incinia.\n9:46 Comment: Diawara.\n9:46 Comment: Diawar had a good idea.\n9:48 Comment: Incinia scratches the ball.\n9:50 Comment: The first player failed to pass the second one.\n9:52 Comment: Bastain interrupted Lorenzo Incinia's pass.\n9:55 Comment: Keita.\n9:55 Comment: He turned around quickly.\n9:57 Comment: Left.\n9:57 Comment: Savich opens.\n9:59 Comment: Now Savich opens on the left.\n10:0 Comment: But Keita Abalde does not see him.\n10:3 Comment: I'm gaping now.\n10:4 Comment: And he is dissatisfied with the opening of Imobili.\n10:6 Comment: Probably Keita now, because he was waiting for Imobili to rush and open.\n10:10 Comment: Why didn’t you give it to the left?\n10:12 Comment: Well, it's hard to say.\n10:12 Comment: Again, all game situations look completely different from the field than on TV.\n10:18 Comment: Coulibaly.\n10:19 Comment: Gabzhik.\n10:20 Comment: Groin touch on Coulibaly.\n10:23 Comment: Diawara.\n10:25 Comment: Peter Zelinsky.\n10:27 Comment: Van Kirikish.\n10:30 Comment: Again on Zelinsky.\n10:35 Comment: And just like that, Latso stops in the opponent’s half of the field.\n10:40 Comment: On the field of Coulibaly.\n10:44 Comment: Right.\n10:45 Comment: The field has done a good job of controlling the ball in such emergency situations when there is press.\n10:49 Comment: Latso works very well tactically.\n10:51 Comment: And it feels like there is a really good microclimate in the team.\n10:54 Comment: Yes, it’s true that such a gang has gathered.\n10:57 Comment: Latso.\n10:57 Comment: Although, also reasoning, after all, all this might not have happened.\n11:1 Comment: But in terms of Simon Nzaghi.\n11:2 Comment: Because Latso already signed a contract in July.\n11:5 Comment: Gabzhik's kick.\n11:7 Comment: Well, this goalkeeper had to react.\n11:9 Comment: Gabzhik's execution is superb.\n11:11 Comment: Despite how he put it right away, it was already more interesting at Naples when Gabzhik began to act 20 meters closer.\n11:17 Comment: Compared to the position he played.\n11:20 Comment: The ball flew past the goal.\n11:21 Comment: But Marketingin still reached out to him on all occasions.\n11:23 Comment: But what kind of ball handling and what kind of technique does Gabzhik have when executing a shot?\n11:27 Comment: Yes, crazy technology.\n11:30 Comment: Marik Gabzhik is absolutely fine.\n11:32 Comment: Great football player.\n11:33 Comment: And he is very loyal to Naples, unlike other players.\n11:39 Comment: On the right with Latso.\n11:40 Comment: Something needs to be said about Marcela Bielsa.\n11:42 Comment: Yes, about Bielsa.\n11:43 Comment: After all, he already signed a contract with Latso.\n11:46 Comment: These are the emotions.\n11:46 Comment: Murizio Sario almost began to destroy the bench now.\n11:50 Comment: Moreover, it is made of iron.\n11:53 Comment: Fine.\n11:55 Comment: Bielsa signed the contract.\n11:57 Comment: Had to get to work.\n11:59 Comment: The training camp near Latso has already begun.\n12:1 Comment: But Biels did not stay for a couple.\n12:3 Comment: And ultimately then through the Argentine press.\n12:5 Comment: And it turned out that he was not leaving.\n12:7 Comment: More precisely, he will not go to Rome for the training camp.\n12:9 Comment: He changed his mind.\n12:10 Comment: Because, they say, they behaved badly in terms of the transfer company of the head of Latso.\n12:15 Comment: Latitto threatened to sue.\n12:18 Comment: And he will win 50 million euros from Bielsa.\n12:21 Comment: Because he essentially deceived him.\n12:22 Comment: Having signed a contract and not arriving.\n12:24 Comment: But in the end, look what Latitto did.\n12:27 Comment: He realized that he was in a hopeless situation.\n12:28 Comment: No time.\n12:30 Comment: The training camp has begun.\n12:30 Comment: He simply took Simon Inzei, who worked in the youth sector.\n12:34 Comment: Latso.\n12:35 Comment: And he began to work.\n12:36 Comment: It was a very funny story.\n12:37 Comment: And, by the way, you see somewhere that this happens often in football.\n12:42 Comment: When non-obvious decisions about a coach turn into a very good continuation for the team.\n12:49 Comment: Well, yes, because right away this option suggests itself.\n12:52 Comment: Why not immediately entrust the team to the coach of the youth team?\n12:56 Comment: who has everything like that.\n12:57 Comment: Everything works out well there.\n12:58 Comment: I am now running it in parallel with Spartak.\n13:0 Comment: With Carrera, whom no one expected either.\n13:2 Comment: Head coach.\n13:3 Comment: He himself spoke today about two matches.\n13:5 Comment: In the end, how well everything turns out for Carrera in Spartak,\n13:8 Comment: and at Simon Inzei's here in Latso.\n13:10 Comment: Yes, that's why...\n13:11 Comment: Decisions are not always obvious in football.\n13:13 Comment: It is not always easy to trust those who work with the youth team.\n13:19 Comment: I believe that there is still a lack of experience or lack of experience in Gabidin.\n13:27 Comment: For some reason he doesn’t undress, doesn’t get ready to go on the field.\n13:30 Comment: Although things are already approaching the 60th minute.\n13:33 Comment: But circumstances played in Philip Inzaghi’s favor.\n13:35 Comment: It's not Philippa here, it's Simone.\n13:37 Comment: Here it is very important to take advantage of the chance that happens to you just like that.\n13:41 Comment: Well, Inzaghi already worked last season with Lazo, with Osnovy, when Pioli was fired.\n13:46 Comment: But nothing worked out.\n13:46 Comment: Only as the leadership of Latso calculated.\n13:49 Comment: And he was returned to the youth sector.\n13:50 Comment: And then, accordingly, after the story with Bielsa, absolutely disastrous for Lazo,\n13:57 Comment: and for image purposes, they again used the services of Simon Inzaghi.\n14:1 Comment: And many believed that the year was lost for Latso.\n14:3 Comment: But no, we see that Latso’s season is already in full swing, already in its third month.\n14:7 Comment: And Latso is in perfect order.\n14:8 Comment: Anderson opens immobile on the far flank.\n14:13 Comment: But Kirkish...\n14:14 Comment: Now the diagonal is very difficult.\n14:16 Comment: Philip Anderson was moving at high speed.\n14:18 Comment: And it was almost impossible to make an exact diagonal over such a distance.\n14:24 Comment: Ghouls on the left flank.\n14:25 Comment: We still have half an hour of play.\n14:26 Comment: To Sao Paulo.\n14:29 Comment: On the shadows.\n14:31 Comment: And Mertens...\n14:33 Comment: Mertens eliminated his opponent.\n14:35 Comment: He tries to resist another one, but it’s difficult.\n14:37 Comment: Now he thought that he was on the flank, and not in the center of the field.\n14:40 Comment: Mertens, damn, how did it come about.\n14:41 Comment: Now it's absolutely...\n14:43 Comment: Dribbling was performed by the flank by Mertens,\n14:46 Comment: and a center forward wouldn’t play like that.\n14:49 Comment: Professional center forward.\n14:51 Comment: Skills, skills are different.\n14:53 Comment: As they say in such cases.\n14:56 Comment: Lulic from the sideline.\n15:3 Comment: Bosnian midfielder.\n15:5 Comment: Milen Krichanovich on Wallace.\n15:10 Comment: Lost the ball.\n15:12 Comment: Dries Mertens.\n15:13 Comment: To Gamshik.\n15:14 Comment: What a pass from Dries Mertens.\n15:17 Comment: The attack continues.\n15:18 Comment: Another shot.\n15:20 Comment: How did Dries Mertens play, eh, Georgiy?\n15:22 Comment: And how Hamshik supported the attack, how he opened up.\n15:25 Comment: This is the leader.\n15:26 Comment: Again.\n15:28 Comment: We love you.\n15:30 Comment: This is how Mertens literally threw the ball to Hamsik.\n15:33 Comment: But I was a little unlucky.\n15:34 Comment: Now everything was done correctly.\n15:35 Comment: It just caught me a little.\n15:37 Comment: On the wrong side, let's say\n15:40 Comment: foot, caught the wrong side of the ball.\n15:42 Comment: But Gamshik moves at very high speed.\n15:45 Comment: And he was unable to throw it further into his turn.\n15:48 Comment: 5-2 on corners.\n15:50 Comment: Ghoulam.\n15:51 Comment: Innings.\n15:52 Comment: Incinia's kick.\n15:53 Comment: Insignia.\n15:56 Comment: Probably a short player from the Italian series.\n15:58 Comment: I just tried to head it in.\n16:4 Comment: And he did.\n16:6 Comment: And even the ball hit his hand.\n16:8 Comment: Porola, and I wouldn’t say that he hit, but Porola made a movement towards the ball.\n16:14 Comment: Zelinsky.\n16:15 Comment: Keeps the ball in the field.\n16:16 Comment: Will catch up.\n16:17 Comment: But he will process it technically.\n16:18 Comment: Under attack.\n16:19 Comment: Hysai is here.\n16:20 Comment: Hysai.\n16:21 Comment: Now it hits with a turn.\n16:22 Comment: And Margenti.\n16:24 Comment: Another rescue.\n16:26 Comment: Now such an action was suggested by Hysai.\n16:30 Comment: And everything seemed obvious.\n16:31 Comment: A TV moment, a beautiful, but very pleasant ball for the goalkeeper.\n16:35 Comment: He saw the moment of impact and simply delighted us with a classic rescue, stretching out into a string.\n16:41 Comment: But it was a convenient ball for the goalkeeper.\n16:43 Comment: Angular.\n16:47 Comment: Yes, I'll be back.\n16:48 Comment: The heart was traveling in the market.\n16:50 Comment: When the ball had already flown over him, it seemed that it could turn into the corner of the goal.\n16:54 Comment: Let's look again.\n16:56 Comment: Hysai's kick.\n16:59 Comment: And the jump of Federico Margenti.\n17:5 Comment: Beautiful moment.\n17:6 Comment: Margenti is fine and helps her team out.\n17:9 Comment: We have 1-1.\n17:10 Comment: And the teams still have 30 minutes to determine the winner.\n17:14 Comment: I think that the matter should not end in a draw.\n17:18 Comment: Well, or at least no goals in the future.\n17:26 Comment: Margenti.\n17:28 Comment: Okay, go ahead.\n17:29 Comment: Whistles.\n17:32 Comment: Sampalova.\n17:33 Comment: This is Hysai.\n17:34 Comment: Immobiles.\n17:36 Comment: The ball was not lifted into the field.\n17:37 Comment: Imobili vs Kirikish.\n17:38 Comment: And out.\n17:39 Comment: You throw out.\n17:40 Comment: Chiro earns.\n17:41 Comment: Immobiles.\n17:42 Comment: Here he is.\n17:43 Comment: Forward of the Italian national team.\n17:44 Comment: Scored two very important goals for the Macedonian national team.\n17:45 Comment: Three gates.\n17:46 Comment: And here he is.\n17:47 Comment: There's only one left.\n17:48 Comment: Three gates.\n17:49 Comment: And here he is.\n17:56 Comment: Last time.\n17:57 Comment: In the recent and last World Cup match in Russia\n17:59 Comment: Ciro Imobili.\n18:0 Comment: Essentially saved.\n18:1 Comment: Squad Adzyura.\n18:2 Comment: Dries Mer.\n18:3 Comment: In the market.\n18:4 Comment: In the best traditions of Manuel Neuer he came out.\n18:5 Comment: True, he didn’t play like Neuer.\n18:6 Comment: Neuer is alive in this situation.\n18:7 Comment: Usually he tries to save the ball for his team.\n18:8 Comment: Although the moment was difficult.\n18:9 Comment: Gulya.\n18:10 Comment: Incine.\n18:11 Comment: Insigne's action was not too obvious.\n18:12 Comment: Parolo.\n18:13 Comment: He plays correctly.\n18:14 Comment: But it’s a little different from Lulech.\n18:15 Comment: And it's not very good.\n18:16 Comment: Moreover.\n18:17 Comment: It's not very good.\n18:18 Comment: But not really.\n18:20 Comment: Beautiful.\n18:28 Comment: Keitas and Lulech played well.\n18:42 Comment: Cullibali.\n18:45 Comment: It’s so easy to overtake in such a gear.\n18:49 Comment: Cullibali again.\n18:49 Comment: Glatkili introducing Ans 馬aba?.\n18:50 Comment: Equip additional gear.\n18:50 Comment: How does Zelensky play the ball on the field in such difficult situations?\n18:54 Comment: He plays very nicely on the field.\n18:55 Comment: Kirikish held the ball.\n18:58 Comment: It was luck that he was pushed, so it wasn't a free kick.\n19:3 Comment: Lutz rises very high from pressure, but now the pressure was somehow sluggish.\n19:9 Comment: Before Beagle came into contact with his opponent,\n19:12 Comment: It seems to me that the other Lutz players could have been more active in the selection.\n19:15 Comment: Latz, Gulibali, Gamzhek, Diawara.\n19:21 Comment: Kept the ball. Ghoulam.\n19:23 Comment: Tini, Ghulyam again.\n19:25 Comment: And here the ball already leaves the field.\n19:28 Comment: 65th minute of the match.\n19:30 Comment: We're in the midst of it. 1-1 on the Lutz field.\n19:37 Comment: Anderson for pasta.\n19:40 Comment: Wallace.\n19:44 Comment: Marchetti.\n19:45 Comment: And this is very useful for Latz today.\n19:52 Comment: And he scored a goal. And he always tries to keep the ball and cling to it.\n19:57 Comment: At this point, however, it was not possible to do this.\n19:59 Comment: Hysaj easily left Savic.\n20:2 Comment: I think that Sergei Milikovich Savic is probably the main candidate to replace Latz, in my opinion.\n20:8 Comment: Because he got lost on the field.\n20:10 Comment: Catald, I think they will gladly replace him.\n20:13 Comment: Very likely.\n20:15 Comment: But the coaches are not making any substitutions yet.\n20:18 Comment: Although it’s already the 66th minute.\n20:20 Comment: But no, just a replacement appears.\n20:21 Comment: And Gabiedini, as we expected.\n20:23 Comment: We thought he would leave about 5 minutes earlier.\n20:25 Comment: But this is such an obvious thing.\n20:28 Comment: But what's here?\n20:30 Comment: This is a violation of the rules on Lutz's part.\n20:33 Comment: It was Milikovich who did not break the rules.\n20:35 Comment: So, Gabiedini.\n20:36 Comment: The most interesting question.\n20:37 Comment: Instead of whom?\n20:37 Comment: I would bet on Calihon.\n20:39 Comment: Or there is another option.\n20:40 Comment: Only as a 1-1 score.\n20:41 Comment: If Napoleon had lost, Divara could have been removed from the game.\n20:46 Comment: But hardly Divar.\n20:46 Comment: More like Zelinsky.\n20:48 Comment: Well, one of these two.\n20:50 Comment: But it’s difficult to play with four strikers.\n20:53 Comment: Oh, what a pass!\n20:54 Comment: What a heel pass that was just from Calihon.\n20:57 Comment: But when it was easier, the ball didn’t land on Insini’s foot,\n21:1 Comment: to shoot into the far corner, as he did in the previous episode.\n21:7 Comment: So, who is changing?\n21:8 Comment: Well, in general, Saria often takes...\n21:10 Comment: This is, in fact, the decision that was made in Georgia’s last match.\n21:14 Comment: I would like to tell you.\n21:15 Comment: Originators.\n21:15 Comment: And Saria makes a profitable decision.\n21:17 Comment: Zero.\n21:18 Comment: In the match against Juventus, it was Incini Moritzo Sariya who took off.\n21:22 Comment: Zero goals.\n21:24 Comment: Incini.\n21:25 Comment: Not today, but this season.\n21:26 Comment: Zero.\n21:28 Comment: Manola Gabidini replaces Lorenzo Insini.\n21:30 Comment: Substitution from Morizo ​​Sariya.\n21:31 Comment: Maybe a certain Sayevery works too.\n21:33 Comment: But I played 66, no luck.\n21:36 Comment: What are the chances of being lucky in the remaining time?\n21:39 Comment: So can the coach reason?\n21:40 Comment: Maybe.\n21:41 Comment: Well, in general, Faith moves mountains, as they say.\n21:44 Comment: So maybe.\n21:45 Comment: Now the main hope is on the field.\n21:47 Comment: This is the player.\n21:48 Comment: Gamshik.\n21:49 Comment: Brilliant.\n21:49 Comment: Oh no no no.\n21:50 Comment: Didn't put the ball in.\n21:51 Comment: Lots of Gabidini.\n21:52 Comment: Of course, Hamshik is the head here.\n21:55 Comment: The main football player in this club.\n21:57 Comment: And in the second half we saw the true class and true strength of Hamsik.\n22:4 Comment: Gabidini.\n22:6 Comment: We take Gabidini's ball.\n22:8 Comment: What is referee Damantov doing here?\n22:11 Comment: Silence.\n22:11 Comment: There is no shlisk.\n22:13 Comment: It was such a good, close combat.\n22:15 Comment: But now...\n22:15 Comment: Here three judges watched this episode.\n22:19 Comment: And no one gave a signal to prompt the referee and take responsibility for this episode.\n22:27 Comment: There are pros and cons to a five-arbiter system.\n22:31 Comment: I was talking with our judges about why we don’t use such a system.\n22:38 Comment: Cons in particular.\n22:39 Comment: The downside is that it’s not me, I’m not expressing my point of view.\n22:44 Comment: I am retelling what seems to me.\n22:45 Comment: Our Russian referees told me.\n22:47 Comment: And Rosetti spoke in particular when he headed the refereeing and inspection department at the Russian Football Union.\n22:58 Comment: The chief referee, when he knows that he has two assistants and one is standing behind the goal, is more relaxed.\n23:4 Comment: That is, he is not fully concentrated, and he does not take responsibility, thinking that someone else will do it.\n23:9 Comment: Now he’s playing in the market, but the ball didn’t fly much, so in the market he just did his job again.\n23:15 Comment: And this is very important.\n23:15 Comment: This is a very important point, because when you know that he is closer, the one behind the gate, and he is silent and does not tell you, you do not take responsibility.\n23:24 Comment: If something seemed to you in the episode, and you seem to be sure that a penalty should be awarded, for example, but the one that is closer does not tell you, this moment is always very difficult.\n23:34 Comment: And it is believed that such a system with five arbitrators relaxes the main thing a little.\n23:39 Comment: And one more point to finish the topic about why it is impossible to imagine this system in Russia.\n23:44 Comment: First.\n23:44 Comment: We simply do not have enough judges to form a normal team of five referees.\n23:50 Comment: And the second, again, is the opinion of the judges.\n23:52 Comment: In order to work with five, you need teamwork, no less mutual understanding than in a team that plays football.\n23:58 Comment: That is, the interaction should be so well established.\n24:2 Comment: They intuitively need to understand each other, the arbitrators, when it is necessary to give advice, when it is not necessary, when in court the field is more visible than his assistant.\n24:11 Comment: That is, it is a very subtle matter.\n24:12 Comment: So let's trust.\n24:14 Comment: These three judges and, most importantly, the referee on the field, Damat, who did not dare to give a penalty.\n24:21 Comment: He was absent.\n24:22 Comment: They showed us a replay.\n24:23 Comment: I don't think it was there.\n24:24 Comment: But they showed it to us.\n24:25 Comment: They weren't shown it.\n24:26 Comment: Yes, they weren’t shown it.\n24:28 Comment: So, another inaccurate transfer from Radu.\n24:34 Comment: Hamshek.\n24:35 Comment: Under instructions.\n24:36 Comment: What gear?\n24:37 Comment: Kobiedini.\n24:38 Comment: I also decided to shoot Manul Kobiedini right away, but the blow didn’t turn out to be strong.\n24:42 Comment: What amazing programs.\n24:44 Comment: From Hamshek.\n24:45 Comment: It's a pleasure to look at it.\n24:47 Comment: And Hamshek is much closer to the attack.\n24:49 Comment: Now I have the feeling that he and Zelinsky have changed places.\n24:52 Comment: And in general, Sarius changed the game scheme a little.\n24:55 Comment: If it's by episode.\n24:57 Comment: There were 4 in the first half.\n24:58 Comment: I have 3-3.\n24:59 Comment: Now maybe 4-2-3-1.\n25:0 Comment: Attack of Lanzo and Mobile.\n25:1 Comment: No, Hamshek.\n25:2 Comment: Just then Marek pops up everywhere.\n25:4 Comment: So here's 4-2-3-1.\n25:5 Comment: And De Laurentiis asked, speaking on the radio.\n25:7 Comment: He believes that he should play according to this scheme on the field.\n25:9 Comment: And it is more convenient for Hamshek to express himself in this scheme.\n25:11 Comment: Kalikhon on Hamshek.\n25:14 Comment: And everything went through him, because his comrades felt that the captain was playing.\n25:19 Comment: Basta.\n25:20 Comment: The ball just kills from inside the penalty area.\n25:23 Comment: Radu.\n25:25 Comment: So it’s just time to hang up.\n25:27 Comment: Although what a pass Radu made.\n25:29 Comment: More precisely, on Chiro and Mobile.\n25:30 Comment: There is one Anderson on the right.\n25:32 Comment: But Lulic is not taking any chances.\n25:34 Comment: And in the end the ball is lost.\n25:35 Comment: An easier choice to continue Lulic's attack.\n25:38 Comment: In the end, Hamshek was wrong.\n25:41 Comment: And, by the way, the impression that Lazio played such a special game,\n25:45 Comment: when you see Lazio against another good team,\n25:49 Comment: which claims a lot in the championship.\n25:51 Comment: Lazio lacks a little, of course, in the quality of players.\n25:54 Comment: And to be honest, I don’t understand the complaints of Lazio fans towards Latit.\n25:58 Comment: Because, given the severe economic crisis,\n26:2 Comment: in which Italy resides, specifically Italy,\n26:5 Comment: because you and I see this from year to year,\n26:9 Comment: coming to this country, and I am in a much, so to speak, larger one,\n26:11 Comment: historical perspective,\n26:14 Comment: The country is indeed going through difficult times.\n26:17 Comment: And Latitu, whose main business is construction,\n26:20 Comment: the construction business always suffers very hard from any crises,\n26:25 Comment: because there is no investment in this business.\n26:27 Comment: And the fact that Latitu keeps the team competitive in these conditions,\n26:33 Comment: which does not cost a flight, which costs minimal expenses\n26:37 Comment: and with minimum wages still not only exists,\n26:41 Comment: but achieves certain results, tries to play good football,\n26:46 Comment: I don’t understand what questions there are for him.\n26:48 Comment: Sell ​​the club to others... Where are they, these investors? They are?\n26:52 Comment: Questions exist even in relationships.\n26:54 Comment: Sell ​​to the Chinese? Please, have already sold Inter. Is this a good story?\n26:59 Comment: Well, it’s still unclear. Still unclear.\n27:1 Comment: Inter is now at a crossroads.\n27:3 Comment: The fact is that Inter is looking for an active coach,\n27:6 Comment: these days, literally, the main negotiations are held,\n27:8 Comment: but Inter's lineup is not the worst.\n27:10 Comment: The Chinese invested in Inter in the summer.\n27:11 Comment: They receive 100 million euros and are not going to stop there.\n27:15 Comment: Well, we're talking about Lazio, so to be honest, it's not very clear to me\n27:18 Comment: exactly what the problem is.\n27:20 Comment: The club exists, the club works.\n27:22 Comment: The Bielsa story is not Latita's story.\n27:25 Comment: In my opinion, the Argentine coach behaved like a city madman.\n27:29 Comment: To some extent, yes.\n27:32 Comment: Diawara right flank, Hysaj... Napoli is trying...\n27:35 Comment: How come he didn't come? They promised him... Who did they promise him?\n27:38 Comment: Did they promise to buy him Messi Suarez and Neymar?\n27:41 Comment: Well, you could say different.\n27:43 Comment: Well, it doesn't happen that way, Nobel. It's not the first day you and I either...\n27:46 Comment: Agree.\n27:47 Comment: But now the scoring attack is in the wrong direction! Take Keith to the left.\n27:50 Comment: Yes, Makaparov opened up. Very good.\n27:53 Comment: To the left, but for some reason Keita didn't see it.\n27:55 Comment: Hysaj on Peter Zelinsky.\n27:57 Comment: How can you not come to the first training camp? What is it?\n28:3 Comment: The head... If you can't fill it up.\n28:6 Comment: Well, what are your complaints about Latit?\n28:8 Comment: Didn't he show up for work? He came.\n28:11 Comment: But then he didn’t come.\n28:13 Comment: Mertens on the left flank. Beat! Beat Tris Mertens!\n28:16 Comment: Near.\n28:17 Comment: He let go of the ball, so they intercepted it.\n28:19 Comment: Well, 74 minutes, another 20 minutes. We have a right to expect something interesting.\n28:25 Comment: But football is good, Georgiy.\n28:26 Comment: Yes, good game.\n28:27 Comment: Football is good. Diawara is back with the ball. Bass by Marko Hamsik.\n28:32 Comment: Zelinsky to the right no. Peter Zelinsky decided to launch the attack.\n28:36 Comment: Kobyadire Gamshik! And again literally touching! Marco Jones gets a touch!\n28:41 Comment: And also for impact.\n28:42 Comment: But he still has time to demonstrate his strike.\n28:49 Comment: It seems that Lazio is starting to wane a little. It's strange though. Lazio had a full week to prepare for this match.\n28:56 Comment: And Napoleon played a difficult away match in the Champions League with almost this lineup. Minimal changes.\n29:3 Comment: And it’s not felt at all.\n29:6 Comment: Kaliho!\n29:7 Comment: Poor serve from Calihon.\n29:11 Comment: Fusai.\n29:13 Comment: Turn left onto Gulyama.\n29:15 Comment: The central Zhirets is shifting. Gamshik! Marek Hamsik may turn around. Turns around and hits with a turn!\n29:21 Comment: Hamshik gets a solid shot, but not exactly.\n29:24 Comment: Gamshik began to take over the game. I understand what he is doing today. And once one blow has passed, the second may also pass. But now I missed the target.\n29:34 Comment: Quarter of an hour.\n29:36 Comment: And how will Inzaghi respond?\n29:42 Comment: There are no replacements for Simone Inzaghi, although, again, options exist on the bench saved by Lazio. Well, this is a decision from the team coach.\n29:52 Comment: Kirikesh.\n29:55 Comment: Savich.\n30:0 Comment: Now is the most interesting thing, because it seems that Napoleon is pressing.\n30:5 Comment: On the field.\n30:7 Comment: He generally tries to score the winning goal, but Lazio’s chances of scoring a counterattack increase with each passing minute.\n30:14 Comment: Because Napoleon will go forward like this until the very end. Basta. He played very tenaciously now against the same Marek Hamsik, who, in my opinion, finally went on the attack.\n30:23 Comment: The sound was avoided. Anderson. Here he is missing. Class in the second half. Kulebali, what a tackle. How did Kulebali play here? Very competent.\n30:35 Comment: And rightly so. Gyulyam.\n30:38 Comment: And that's it, there are no options. Algerians. Mertens address.\n30:43 Comment: Yes, Gyulyam was tired, so he didn’t run with the ball, didn’t rush into this zone.\n30:48 Comment: Password.\n30:53 Comment: Milinkovic. Savich.\n30:59 Comment: Ciro Imobili.\n31:2 Comment: Station.\n31:5 Comment: And now almost to the penalty area.\n31:7 Comment: And even here the transfer is to Imobli. Immobiles.\n31:10 Comment: I handled the ball poorly, so in the end I couldn’t shoot.\n31:18 Comment: Bite.\n31:21 Comment: And another pass across the field to Diawara.\n31:26 Comment: Gamshik.\n31:29 Comment: Please note that all passes, all attacks go through Gamshik. There isn't a single attack where Hamsik doesn't touch the ball, one way or another.\n31:35 Comment: And even here Gabiede did not give it to Gamshikov, but Gamshikov was facing the other goal, so it was necessary to play through him.\n31:46 Comment: And immediately Hamshik made a forward pass to aggravate the situation.\n31:49 Comment: And the ball goes after Mertens.\n32:4 Comment: And the ball goes out of bounds. Lazio's replacement will happen now.\n32:9 Comment: Yes, we need a pause for replacement.\n32:13 Comment: The defender comes out for Lazio. Well, approximately according to the position of replacement.\n32:26 Comment: Yes, Patrici, instead of Lulic.\n32:33 Comment: In fact, Inzaghi understands that in this situation, probably, the main thing is not to lose, but to maintain such a result,\n32:43 Comment: which, in principle, as you have already said, is positive for Lazio. An away draw in Naples is always good.\n32:50 Comment: Tris Mertens vs Basta. In the penalty area.\n32:54 Comment: It was too obvious, but he was still great for intercepting that pass.\n32:58 Comment: Parallel. Non-mobiles.\n33:2 Comment: He gathered the three around him. Chiroy Nemobili. The transmission has passed. But.\n33:8 Comment: Parallel did not touch the ball. Waited for his team to go out. Begle.\n33:14 Comment: Another pass back. Oles. Basta.\n33:31 Comment: Donyshev. He plays with his head. Begle. Here is Kirikish.\n33:35 Comment: Zelitsky. Kobiedini. Bad pass from Kobiedini. Kulebali.\n33:47 Comment: And a violation of the rules, but on the part of Tris Mertens.\n33:53 Comment: Kobiedini has not entered the game in the best way so far. At the very least, maybe he lacks game tone.\n33:59 Comment: Because of the red card, which he very stupidly received in the game with Cratona.\n34:4 Comment: But in any case, there were a couple of episodes where Kobiedini was in a striking position.\n34:14 Comment: They killed Kadoorie. What we talked about in the first half. He should appear on the field.\n34:19 Comment: I think that instead of Zelinsky it is quite possible, perhaps Murizo Sarri also has other options.\n34:26 Comment: Kulebali.\n34:31 Comment: Kirikish.\n34:37 Comment: Another pass. On Zelinsky. Zelinsky with Kobiedini. But Kobiedini played poorly.\n34:49 Comment: But he has a stroke again. Manola Kobiedini. Corner kick. Earned Manola.\n34:55 Comment: Now any standard can be decisive. Because if any team scores, there will simply be no time left to win back.\n35:2 Comment: Although Latso played his missed goal right away. But this is most likely a coincidence and Papira’s mistake.\n35:9 Comment: So. Kulebali. Innings. The header didn't come out.\n35:21 Comment: But this is not a blow. It's a ball to the head. For reasons.\n35:24 Comment: Hairstyles.\n35:26 Comment: Yes, this is Kirikish. I tried to break through, but it didn’t work.\n35:29 Comment: Lehrkens doesn't seem to be.\n35:36 Comment: Gorikhona. Gorijona and Omar El Kadoury. Instead, a Moroccan midfielder who knows how to make the final pass.\n35:48 Comment: But essentially the scheme does not change.\n35:53 Comment: At Napoli. El Kadoury will most likely play in Gorijon's position.\n35:58 Comment: Anderson.\n36:0 Comment: Sari's key decision was to move Gavshka closer to the attack in the second half.\n36:5 Comment: Runaway. Left. Here Mobili will impose a fight on Hysai. No.\n36:12 Comment: Hysayu played very competently. He immediately got even with Reina.\n36:16 Comment: Radu. And pass to Federico Marginti.\n36:23 Comment: Napoli, as we have already noted, has an important match ahead of Dynamo Kyiv in the Champions League.\n36:33 Comment: But this will all happen after the international break. There is a national team match ahead.\n36:37 Comment: Two weeks again. Club football is fading into the background.\n36:42 Comment: Then, yes, then you're absolutely right. In Latvia, I think that the main issue for November-December is solving the problem in the Champions League.\n36:53 Comment: Because then nothing can be changed.\n36:58 Comment: It will be necessary to solve the problem in two matches with Dynamo Kyiv and Benfica in the playoffs of the Champions League. The situation has changed.\n37:9 Comment: Well, according to the calendar, Napoli’s next match is in Udine against Udinese. And Lazio Donless Genuas plays on November 20th.\n37:17 Comment: Lazio have a replacement in the meantime. Luka Djordjevic appears on the field.\n37:22 Comment: Instead of Keith Walde. Keita whistles. He played very well. Scored the ball.\n37:27 Comment: So important for Lazio. Well, in fact, the live shot at the goal was very dangerous.\n37:32 Comment: Djordjevic is number 9. He is a quality forward. True, one of his main problems is almost always with damage.\n37:42 Comment: And it’s rare to be 100% ready. Djordjevic.\n37:52 Comment: Mertens. Mertens with the ball.\n37:57 Comment: Djordjevic again. You can, you can play. Kadoorie. Gamshik.\n38:5 Comment: Again Oumar Alkaduri with the ball. Serve, but in the wrong direction. Oumar Alkaduri served in the wrong direction. Diawara.\n38:12 Comment: Now, it turns out, he got rid of the ball. Yes, that is right. Diawara turned around. Good pass to Kadoorie.\n38:21 Comment: Gabiedini. Gabiedini is not waiting for the ball. It’s somehow strange, of course, how he behaves on the field today.\n38:28 Comment: Andersak. Cuts through the field. He really wants to beat Napoli in today's match. And the game, apparently, is by hand.\n38:37 Comment: Well, what if you yourself, when starting the report, said that Napoli is Juventus’s main competitor.\n38:44 Comment: Well, not the main one, but one of the main ones. One of the main ones. Several seasons in a row after De Luens revived the team.\n38:51 Comment: Brought it back from series B to series A. Well, that was quite a long time ago. Since then, Napoli has been gradually improving.\n38:56 Comment: Little by little I began to get comfortable in Europe in the Champions League. But here is the real competition for Juventus in the table, yes, as you can see.\n39:6 Comment: Napoli second, third, second. You consider the gap from Juventus. But Juventus is the champion for five years in a row.\n39:11 Comment: Today we look at the table again and see Juventus in first place, ahead of Napoli. In terms of lost points, maybe there will be even more points.\n39:20 Comment: If Napoli is not there, then this is no longer the case.\n39:21 Comment: Napoli will win this match.\n39:25 Comment: Andersov.\n39:30 Comment: Kulebali. We have to hurry. Kulebali. Gabshikh with the ball. There was a pass from Mark to Manul Gabidini.\n39:37 Comment: He played very gracefully now. Threw the ball over the opponent's leg. Gabidini is upset that no one opened up for him.\n39:44 Comment: But Gabidini has no right to switch out of the fight, because these are the decisive minutes of the match. Well, just think, no one opened up.\n39:50 Comment: Keep looking for chances in attack.\n39:54 Comment: Ghoulam. Across the field. Diawara. Zelensky. Gabshikh. No, the transmission went to Gulyam.\n40:4 Comment: Latso does not hesitate to defend with the whole team together with Immobile in these minutes.

    "summary": "The match between Napoli and Lazio ended in a 1-1 draw after an intense battle that demonstrated the best qualities of both teams. Throughout the game, both teams exhibited moments of brilliance and sheer determination, making for an exciting showdown at the San Paolo stadium. \n\nIn the first half, the excitement already started even before the match as the fans were highly animated, showing their support with fervor. When the game kicked off, it was clear that both teams were not holding back. Lazio's Ciro Immobile orchestrated an early attack, shooting directly into the hands of Napoli's goalkeeper Pepe Reina. Shortly thereafter, Napoli had a noteworthy chance with a sleek interplay between Insigne and Ghoulam, who created an opportunity for Dries Mertens to fire at Lazio's goal. Unfortunately for the home side, Mertens couldn’t find the back of the net as his shot went wide. \n\nLazio, known for their strategic precision, also showed early signs of their attacking intent with notable attempts from Felipe Anderson and Milinković-Savić. These early exchanges set an energetic tone for the match, with both teams recognizing the significance of securing points in their respective campaigns.\n\nNapoli, spearheaded by the quick-footed trio of Insigne, Mertens, and Callejón, consistently applied pressure on Lazio’s defense. The pace and technical ability of these forwards posed a significant threat, though the lack of height meant aerial duels were often lost to the towering Lazio defenders. Koulibaly and Hysaj’s defensive contributions were crucial in thwarting Lazio’s calculated offenses. Lazio's defensive solidity was reflected by their disciplined structure and their captain, Lucas Biglia, who was a commanding presence in the midfield. \n\nAs the first half progressed, Napoli's relentless pressing seemed to boost their territorial advantage. Marek Hamšík, the Napoli captain, was pivotal in midfield, combining well with Diawara and setting up attacks. Napoli's strategy of retaining possession and playing quick passes to destabilize Lazio’s defensive lines was evident, but a breakthrough remained elusive.\n\nDespite their dominance in possession, Napoli struggled to convert it into goals. Their best chances came through intricate plays involving Hamšík and Insigne, whose chemistry on the pitch was evident. However, Lazio’s defense, under the watchful eyes of Wallace and Stefan Radu, stood resolute. \n\nThe first significant opportunity for Lazio came through a swift counter-attack led by Ciro Immobile. Immobile's speed and positioning allowed him to exploit gaps in Napoli's defense, but Pepe Reina’s experience and composure ensured the scores remained level. Another close call occurred when Immobile delivered a pinpoint cross aiming for Keita Baldé, whose attempt was well-intercepted by Koulibaly, showcasing his defensive prowess. \n\nTowards the end of the first half, a notable incident was Hamšík’s effort from distance that narrowly missed the target. His shot, with power and precision, had keeper Federico Marchetti stretching to ensure it flew over the crossbar. This episode highlighted Hamšík’s ability to create chances from almost nothing, underscoring his importance to Napoli’s attacking play.\n\nThe second half saw both teams raising their intensity levels. Lazio started on the front foot with Ciro Immobile once again leading the charge. His persistence to breach Napoli’s defense was apparent as he managed to create significant goal-scoring opportunities, but once again, Reina was alert and steadfast between the posts.\n\nAround the 52nd minute, Napoli finally broke the deadlock. A wonderful piece of play saw Hamšík displayed his typical determination and skill. Receiving the ball from Ghoulam, he maneuvered expertly past Lazio’s defenders before firing a low-driven shot into the far corner. This goal was a testament to Hamšík’s quality and his ability to influence the game positively from midfield. \n\nHowever, Lazio’s response was swift. Within minutes, they equalized with a remarkable goal from Keita Baldé. After a quick exchange of passes, Felipe Anderson’s insightful ball found Keita, who made no mistake from close range, beating Reina with a precise shot into the corner. This equalizer sparked a frenzied period where both teams sought to capitalize on the momentum.\n\nPost-equalizer, the match became an end-to-end affair, with Napoli pushing hard to regain their lead and Lazio making the most of counter-attack opportunities. Hamšík remained a focal point for Napoli, creating chance after chance with his immaculate vision and precise passing. His leadership on the pitch was crucial, orchestrating plays and pushing his team forward.\n\nNapoli's coaching staff made tactical changes, including bringing on Manolo Gabbiadini for Lorenzo Insigne, emphasizing their intent to go for the win. Gabbiadini, despite being fresh on the field, showcased moments of brilliance but struggled with his finishing, most notably when his shot was comfortably saved by Marchetti. \n\nSimilarly, Lazio reinforced their defense with sensible substitutions, aiming to hold on to the draw while setting up for occasional counter-attacks. The midfields were a hotly contested area, with Lucas Biglia and Sergej Milinković-Savić battling it out against Napoli’s Marko Rog and Allan, who had replaced the tiring duo of Hamšík and Zieliński.\n\nIn the dying minutes of the match, both teams had their golden opportunities to snatch the winner. Napoli almost clinched it when a driven free-kick from Hamšík narrowly missed the target, leaving the home fans in a collective gasp. Lazio had a chance themselves when Immobile found a pocket of space inside the box, only to be denied by an excellent save from Reina.\n\nReferee Damato's decisions, especially surrounding potential fouls and penalty claims, were scrutinized by both sides. The introductions of players like Omar El Kaddouri from Napoli and Lazio’s young forward Lombardi added fresh legs and different dynamics to their respective teams’ strategies.\n\nWhen the final whistle blew, both teams had to settle for a point each. The 1-1 scoreline reflected a match full of tactical depth, individual brilliance, and moments of high tension. For Napoli, Hamšík’s performance stood out, while for Lazio, the contributions of Immobile and Keita ensured they came away with a respectable draw. \n\nThe match provided a clear indication of the strengths and weaknesses of both squads. Napoli demonstrated their attacking prowess but also showed lapses in their finishing. Lazio, on the other hand, showcased their defensive resilience and ability to strike effectively on the counter. Both teams would need to reflect on their performances and make necessary adjustments as they continue their respective campaigns in Serie A. \n\nIn conclusion, the 1-1 draw between Napoli and Lazio was a fair result in a fiercely contested match, providing football fans with a thrilling exhibition of skill, strategy, and sportsmanship."
