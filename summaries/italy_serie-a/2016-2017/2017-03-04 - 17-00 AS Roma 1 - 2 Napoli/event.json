The game was characterized by last-ditch defending and Roma’s desperation to breach the Napoli rearguard. However, despite their valiant efforts, they couldn’t find the back of the net again before the final whistle.\n\nIn the end, Napoli's clinical finishing and defensive solidity earned them a hard-fought 2-1 victory over AS Roma. The game's physical nature, demonstrated by multiple fouls and yellow cards, reflected the high stakes and the fierce competition between these two Serie A giants.
