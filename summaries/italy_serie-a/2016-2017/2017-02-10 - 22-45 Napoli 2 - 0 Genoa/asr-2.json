be fine with him.\n4:43 Comment: He can continue to play.\n4:45 Comment: But for now Michata is in the Genoa half of the field and is not at the feet of the Naples players.\n4:50 Comment: And the Genoese still own it themselves.\n4:52 Comment: And the defender of the visiting team was now telling his players the attack line\n4:56 Comment: get closer to try to receive the pass.\n4:59 Comment: Otherwise, you will have to continue playing as a goalkeeper.\n5:4 Comment: Back again.\n5:6 Comment: Centiletti plays.\n5:8 Comment: Lohmann.\n5:10 Comment: And a little to the right.\n5:11 Comment: Well, it’s difficult to start an attack from here.\n5:12 Comment: You need to hit hard into the opposing half of the field.\n5:14 Comment: There to cling to the ball.\n5:16 Comment: Towards the central zone.\n5:17 Comment: Let's go back, if you like.\n5:19 Comment: Well, Žorzinek.\n5:20 Comment: In my opinion, the main players are already slowly leaving.\n5:23 Comment: So somehow he dissolves in it.\n5:25 Comment: Alan is probably very good as a supporting player.\n5:28 Comment: But they take turns playing.\n5:30 Comment: Either Maksimovich, or Zelinsky, who constantly began to appear as a substitute in almost every match.\n5:35 Comment: And he also has the right to fight.\n5:36 Comment: That's Diawara.\n5:37 Comment: And in different combinations.\n5:38 Comment: So there are elections here, rotation.\n5:39 Comment: I'll still see who will play against Real.\n5:42 Comment: And I wouldn’t be surprised if Zhorzhinek isn’t there.\n5:44 Comment: Alan, I think so.\n5:46 Comment: Alan will be back.\n5:50 Comment: Napoleon tries to launch his attack.\n5:53 Comment: So far nothing is working out in the other half of the field.\n5:56 Comment: But you have to understand the mood Jenu was in for this match.\n6:0 Comment: Let him be a guest.\n6:1 Comment: The team really needs to try to take points.\n6:4 Comment: Because the club president has problems.\n6:6 Comment: He was so seriously abused by fans at his last home match.\n6:12 Comment: Moreover, the president of the club then noted that he was ready to accept any criticism.\n6:20 Comment: He cannot legislate towards himself.\n6:22 Comment: But when it comes to his family, these are things that he cannot stand.\n6:26 Comment: The situation at the club is difficult.\n6:28 Comment: The fans are demanding that Precio sell the club and find investors.\n6:33 Comment: And Preziose said yesterday that if there is a buyer, I will give him a huge discount.\n6:38 Comment: Come buy it.\n6:39 Comment: And he addressed the fans.\n6:41 Comment: If you know someone better than me who would be a better manager, call me.\n6:45 Comment: I'll give you the club, please.\n6:47 Comment: Therefore, the situation is very difficult.\n6:48 Comment: And there is not much motivation for this.\n6:49 Comment: Team, Italy's oldest team, Genuel Football and Cricket Club.\n6:54 Comment: It is still called that.\n6:55 Comment: First champion.\n6:56 Comment: The first champion, the first club in Italy, created, naturally, by English sailors who were based in Portugenuela.\n7:2 Comment: This is a team, of course, with a glorious history, with interesting pages in this very history.\n7:8 Comment: Now, you see, he is in such a difficult situation.\n7:10 Comment: But he plays well in the first minutes.\n7:12 Comment: Again Loshald, again the left flank is open to attack.\n7:16 Comment: Urguyt plays the wall.\n7:18 Comment: They tightened it up a little.\n7:19 Comment: There will be a feed.\n7:20 Comment: And, in my opinion, even the out is in favor...\n7:22 Comment: In favor of the attack.\n7:25 Comment: Rafael Paladin helped there.\n7:31 Comment: Flord, who came to the left flank.\n7:34 Comment: We don't see much of Giovanni Simeone yet.\n7:36 Comment: Attacks are attacks.\n7:39 Comment: Several of them were carried out.\n7:40 Comment: We approached the penalty area.\n7:42 Comment: But until the moment, until some kind of accentuated transfer or for a shock position, that’s not the point.\n7:49 Comment: But, apparently, everything that happened happened.\n7:50 Comment: And, in the end, Torrio Honey Walker.\n7:51 Comment: Diabarat discount.\n7:52 Comment: Well, pass forward.\n7:53 Comment: Christian Maggio is the starter today.\n7:54 Comment: One of the mastodons.\n7:56 Comment: The man who also played at home Tsar, and Bridvinites, and...\n7:59 Comment: I think the Tsar was at home, right?\n8:0 Comment: Well, the most important thing is that Maggio is on the field for the first time since October.\n8:1 Comment: Paladin, he entered the fight.\n8:2 Comment: Well, Jocherini, whom we see rarely today.\n8:3 Comment: And you see, he’s not very tired anymore.\n8:4 Comment: But this is, of course, very important.\n8:5 Comment: Well, the most important thing is that Maggio is on the field for the first time since October.\n8:14 Comment: Paladin, he entered the fight.\n8:17 Comment: Well, Jokerina, whom we also see infrequently.\n8:19 Comment: Today he replaces Calijon, who was sent off in the last match.\n8:22 Comment: Jocherina is still one of the creators of the unexpected Italian breakthrough at the Euro.\n8:27 Comment: Despite the fact that he doesn’t seem to be a very noticeable football player.\n8:30 Comment: Yes, but as for Calichon, of course, you need to manage to retire at 7-1 in your favor.\n8:35 Comment: There was still something in the first half.\n8:40 Comment: Gennady Scepp tries to send the ball into the opponent's half of the field.\n8:43 Comment: Football is still a bit chaotic.\n8:45 Comment: But it’s still clear that, as usual, we say, and the coach, and Sarii, and, of course, everyone said,\n8:51 Comment: we only think about Jenu, we only think about the upcoming match.\n8:54 Comment: But this is such a broken record among all coaches and players.\n8:58 Comment: Of course, no one will say, but we have nothing to do with Jena.\n9:1 Comment: Our thoughts are with Madrid.\n9:2 Comment: But psychologically, we understand what?\n9:5 Comment: What is now and what is it now, who is every Napoli player thinking about now.\n9:10 Comment: Head coach Sarii and club president Reule Laurentiis,\n9:13 Comment: who, in fact, with his own hands and his absolutely amazing energy\n9:19 Comment: raised this team from Serie B, from the long vegetation of the famous Italian club,\n9:24 Comment: famous all over the world, thanks to Diego Maradona,\n9:27 Comment: who came to Napoli in January, and again it was a complete sensation.\n9:32 Comment: He is still greeted as...\n9:35 Comment: just a person, but as some kind of deity.\n9:38 Comment: Of course, without this club in Serie A it was very boring.\n9:42 Comment: Zelinsky, Jokerrini, Feint played beautifully now.\n9:45 Comment: And it looks like there was a violation of the rules.\n9:47 Comment: But the first chance nevertheless arose at the gate for Evgeniy Lomanna.\n9:51 Comment: In the center of the field, beautifully, let me emphasize again, he handled the ball, turned around, and got away from two opponents.\n9:57 Comment: Polish midfielder Piotr Zielinski.\n10:0 Comment: But pay attention, the very first penetration of Napoli into someone else's penalty area was for the goal.\n10:4 Comment: It seems like we haven't seen them.\n10:5 Comment: Or rather, we didn't see them.\n10:5 Comment: At someone else's gate.\n10:7 Comment: But the very first combination ends with almost a scoring chance.\n10:11 Comment: The ball moves very well.\n10:13 Comment: And in any combination.\n10:15 Comment: Here we are talking about some minimal rotational touches plus two disqualifications.\n10:18 Comment: The composition has changed slightly.\n10:20 Comment: But Napol remains himself.\n10:22 Comment: And everything here is determined by the technique, passion, energy of Dries Mertons.\n10:28 Comment: And, of course, dispatch data from Mark Hamszyk.\n10:32 Comment: They are the leaders now.\n10:35 Comment: And this is where almost every threat comes into play now.\n10:38 Comment: But here they managed without Gamshik.\n10:40 Comment: Rebound.\n10:41 Comment: Jocherini picks up the ball.\n10:42 Comment: And Santiago Gentiletti gives him a very powerful body.\n10:46 Comment: Well, perhaps a game collision.\n10:48 Comment: Well, gaming.\n10:49 Comment: He managed to get closer to the ball, so to speak.\n10:52 Comment: There was probably no reason to call a penalty here.\n10:56 Comment: 0-0.\n10:57 Comment: The teams have already played for 10 minutes.\n10:59 Comment: Well, Napoli finally cleans up the territory in that very match.\n11:3 Comment: Well, he takes it into his own hands.\n11:4 Comment: I mean.\n11:5 Comment: Now they had already missed Palermo by this minute.\n11:8 Comment: We then suffered for a long time and won back.\n11:10 Comment: They could still score.\n11:11 Comment: But the match ended 1-1.\n11:13 Comment: And Palermo is even lower than Genu.\n11:15 Comment: By the way, it’s in the table.\n11:20 Comment: Like Fauzi Gulyam, he traveled to Kulebari for the African Cup.\n11:25 Comment: There were probably problems too.\n11:27 Comment: But you were right about the depth of the bench, about the choice.\n11:32 Comment: And in defense as well.\n11:34 Comment: There are dangerous ones.\n11:35 Comment: Although stability is precisely what distinguished Napoli last season, let’s say.\n11:40 Comment: In general, in recent years the team has played with the same lineup.\n11:45 Comment: We even talked once during, in my opinion, the previous championship or the year before,\n11:49 Comment: that Napoli in all of Europe is the most stable in terms of the number of matches played in the first 11 on this list.\n11:57 Comment: Yes, the team is very good.\n11:59 Comment: And Napoli is literally just a little bit short of taking another step forward.\n12:2 Comment: So that not on paper, but to truly qualify for the Scudetto.\n12:7 Comment: To go into matches against Real Madrid with even more confidence.\n12:13 Comment: Sari, a trainer who is famous for his love of all sorts of obscenities and obscene words.\n12:23 Comment: But we won't repeat what he said to Mancini last year.\n12:26 Comment: Yes, of course, we cannot say this at the match.\n12:28 Comment: But he explained what his team was missing publicly.\n12:30 Comment: In order to play.\n12:31 Comment: To play more confidently.\n12:34 Comment: And, of course, the team is very nice.\n12:36 Comment: And, in particular, Juric, the former Genoa midfielder and now the team's head coach, said so.\n12:42 Comment: When I see Napoli, I see a team playing football.\n12:45 Comment: However, after talking with Massimo Carrera, the head coach of Spartak, the Italians, you and I realized that the idea of ​​the game of football is very different.\n12:54 Comment: Very different, even within Italy.\n12:56 Comment: Well, Italy only seems united, yes, on paper in general.\n13:0 Comment: These are a lot of different characters, different provinces, even different types of thinking.\n13:5 Comment: Genoa with the ball.\n13:9 Comment: Like without a gate.\n13:10 Comment: No gate.\n13:11 Comment: Pepperena didn’t really come into the game, and the ball almost never reached the goalkeeper of the visiting team, Laman.\n13:17 Comment: But now, perhaps, there will be a counterattack.\n13:19 Comment: Hamshek tried to make a pass.\n13:22 Comment: And now he is making claims against Insina Marek Hamšek regarding the fact that he opened up incorrectly and did not offer himself better.\n13:29 Comment: Just Ivan Yurievich, who played for Genoa for several years, then the previous coach took him on as an assistant.\n13:39 Comment: Then Gasperini was invited to Inter, and he went there with Yuryevich.\n13:43 Comment: They were fired and they both went to Palermo.\n13:46 Comment: They were also fired from there, and that’s where their paths diverged.\n13:49 Comment: Yes, but then Yuryevich still had a croton, which he brought to Seryue.\n13:53 Comment: We see what this croton is and laugh a little.\n13:57 Comment: Here's a match with Santo on copper.\n13:58 Comment: Yes.\n13:59 Comment: I was with Juventus.\n14:0 Comment: Well, in general, it’s not so shameful.\n14:2 Comment: And yet, the team that ends up in Seryue always represents another coach.\n14:10 Comment: It often happens that it is thanks to such lifts that a coach becomes famous.\n14:18 Comment: Gradually Napoli takes the ball for themselves.\n14:20 Comment: Now we will look at some interesting statistics, which, it seems to me, will not tell us anything new.\n14:28 Comment: Additional, in addition to what we see ourselves.\n14:30 Comment: But it’s always interesting to analyze numbers.\n14:35 Comment: Well, 15 minutes behind, maybe a little early.\n14:38 Comment: The most important thing is that it is outwardly clear.\n14:40 Comment: Napoli is in no hurry.\n14:42 Comment: Napoli understands how strong and powerful the reserves are.\n14:46 Comment: But still.\n14:47 Comment: Who loves numbers, please be curious.\n14:49 Comment: The visiting team has 57% of the ball, only 43% for the hosts.\n14:54 Comment: Well, as a rule, I pay attention to accuracy.\n14:57 Comment: Pass accuracy percentage.\n14:59 Comment: So far it is low for both teams and very low for Napoli.\n15:1 Comment: Only 74%.\n15:3 Comment: If you remember, the previous match that we commentated on with Palermo, Napoli’s unsuccessful result, was 88%.\n15:10 Comment: 87%, yes, yes, yes, somewhere towards the end of the match.\n15:12 Comment: That's why they don't have the ball yet.\n15:15 Comment: Well, there are always interesting Italians, in particular, the newspaper “Delosport” on its online website,\n15:20 Comment: such, in addition to ball possession, also determines a very ephemeral weighted average,\n15:26 Comment: so-called territorial advantage.\n15:28 Comment: Now it’s four times more powerful than Jenu’s.\n15:33 Comment: Bye.\n15:34 Comment: Well, what a moment.\n15:35 Comment: The corners are performed by the Genoa team.\n15:37 Comment: It was not possible to serve the ball higher or make a sharper pass.\n15:42 Comment: But still, if we return to this ephemeral concept of territorial advantage,\n15:47 Comment: the ball is more at the left goal.\n15:49 Comment: Although, Caperlino is still without a game in these first quarter of an hour.\n15:52 Comment: Two shawls.\n15:54 Comment: Another one.\n15:56 Comment: The headman can earn money by swearing.\n15:57 Comment: This is true.\n15:58 Comment: Christian Maggio put his foot down.\n16:1 Comment: Well, as long as it’s clear that Napoleon isn’t straining himself, yes.\n16:4 Comment: That is, it does not include third, much less fourth, and higher gears.\n16:9 Comment: Still, whatever one may say, the Champions League is ahead.\n16:11 Comment: And no one wants it here.\n16:12 Comment: Moreover, having seen Mertons, who almost tore a muscle, yes, in the very first minute of the match,\n16:17 Comment: I think it scared his comrades.\n16:19 Comment: And once again you’ll think about it.\n16:21 Comment: Get into combat, speed up.\n16:23 Comment: There is this effect, yes.\n16:25 Comment: When you are under the Champions League.\n16:27 Comment: Well, you won't convince Mertons with these words.\n16:30 Comment: He will speed up.\n16:31 Comment: He lives for it.\n16:32 Comment: And the Belgian gets the ball.\n16:33 Comment: Goes to the center.\n16:34 Comment: Beats.\n16:35 Comment: But having beaten one, he loses position in relation to the other rebound defender.\n16:41 Comment: Marko Gavsika conceived a high serve across the entire penalty area.\n16:45 Comment: Well, there’s a corner rebound here too.\n16:47 Comment: Well, the corner is already an achievement for Napoleon in this match.\n16:51 Comment: Burdisu explains why he did not inquire about anything.\n16:55 Comment: Think immediately.\n16:56 Comment: I picked the ball on the corners.\n16:58 Comment: One of the most experienced players in his team, Nicolas Burdisu,\n17:1 Comment: who played for both Inter and Roma for many years.\n17:5 Comment: As far as I know, I was planning to go to Russia, but didn’t make it.\n17:8 Comment: Finishes his career in Jena.\n17:10 Comment: In great shape.\n17:11 Comment: Now he played great twice.\n17:13 Comment: At first he didn’t allow himself to beat Mertons.\n17:15 Comment: Then he intercepted the ball.\n17:16 Comment: Innings.\n17:17 Comment: Another corner.\n17:18 Comment: No, it's offsite.\n17:19 Comment: Watched.\n17:20 Comment: Judges.\n17:22 Comment: Well, and Santiago Gentility, what do you call him?\n17:24 Comment: Yes.\n17:25 Comment: What do the Italians call it?\n17:27 Comment: He has also been playing for a very long time.\n17:29 Comment: In general, a serious, powerful unit of Argentine defenders.\n17:35 Comment: The three of them lined up.\n17:37 Comment: Well, it’s interesting to see Nadar Kalazovich too.\n17:41 Comment: In general, the figures are not bad, interesting.\n17:44 Comment: The same Semyon has already scored 10 goals in a team that is closer to offside.\n17:47 Comment: I did three takes.\n17:49 Comment: But very unstable.\n17:50 Comment: You said that in recent matches the fans have already started to lead the way.\n17:54 Comment: And the fans began to swear at the president.\n17:56 Comment: They miss a lot all the time.\n17:58 Comment: Well, that's how it went...\n18:0 Comment: Here, a rather risky decision was to entrust the team to the inexperienced coach Jurich.\n18:9 Comment: But, on the other hand, the preciosity was probably bribed by the fact that this is his own person who went through the club system.\n18:16 Comment: He worked in the youth team.\n18:18 Comment: He knows the specifics, knows the players.\n18:21 Comment: And now the forced replacement Orban comes out.\n18:23 Comment: Number 21 for Genoa.\n18:26 Comment: But I repeat once again, this is a unique situation for Italy.\n18:29 Comment: As well as a very rare example of patience.\n18:32 Comment: You and I were joking, just, again, returning to the previous match.\n18:36 Comment: And they told TV viewers about the coach, President Palermo Zamparini.\n18:41 Comment: Which set a world record for the number of coaching resignations.\n18:45 Comment: During the season, 8 people were changed last year.\n18:48 Comment: Gasperini, as it were, in contrast to this, shows an amazing result.\n18:51 Comment: Patience.\n18:53 Comment: And Jurich is still at the head of the team, despite 8 matches without victories.\n18:57 Comment: And only 2 of them are draws.\n18:59 Comment: Therefore, the fans, on the one hand, can be understood.\n19:1 Comment: On the other hand, a club with a very modest budget.\n19:3 Comment: Who lives, unfortunately, in a rather poor city.\n19:5 Comment: But there is no money in Genoa for a number of reasons.\n19:7 Comment: And besides, 2 teams.\n19:9 Comment: And yet, Genua recently played in the Eurocups.\n19:11 Comment: Genua is not relegated.\n19:13 Comment: Genua finished last season in the middle of the coach.\n19:15 Comment: And, of course, in recent years, in recent years,\n19:17 Comment: Genoa is not relegated in Eurocups.\n19:19 Comment: Genoa finished last season in the middle of the table.\n19:21 Comment: But let us remind you again.\n19:23 Comment: Genoa beat Juventus 3-1 just recently.\n19:25 Comment: The victory over Milan was 3-0 and so on.\n19:27 Comment: This team is playing.\n19:29 Comment: And, in general, with excellent potential.\n19:31 Comment: But uneven.\n19:33 Comment: But by the time of the Genoese.\n19:35 Comment: Shot on goal.\n19:37 Comment: The ball is flying.\n19:39 Comment: Paladin caught the ball.\n19:41 Comment: Literally chewed it out from the defender.\n19:43 Comment: Well, there's a ricochet.\n19:45 Comment: Semyon or Paladin?\n19:47 Comment: Oh yes. The paladin plays to the left.\n19:49 Comment: And Semyon is a little to the right. Yes, that's him.\n19:51 Comment: Outwardly they are similar. Bill Singh.\n19:53 Comment: His mother is Italian.\n19:55 Comment: Because dad played in Italy for a long time.\n19:57 Comment: And that's why the name is Italian.\n19:59 Comment: And the surname, naturally, is my father’s Argentine-Spanish one.\n20:1 Comment: Yes, ricochet.\n20:3 Comment: Yes, rebound and corner.\n20:5 Comment: They play with a double center.\n20:7 Comment: Indeed, on an equal footing.\n20:9 Comment: Approximately.\n20:11 Comment: A little to the right is Giovanni Semyon and to the left is Rafael Paladin.\n20:13 Comment: For the corner, that means the central defenders.\n20:15 Comment: So chances are.\n20:17 Comment: Naples has enough strength of its own.\n20:19 Comment: And as a result, the ball flew to the center circle.\n20:21 Comment: Lukas Orban, who came on as a substitute.\n20:23 Comment: The same as everyone else.\n20:25 Comment: Half-Argentine now.\n20:27 Comment: Because he, like others,\n20:29 Comment: I have a European passport, a Spanish one.\n20:31 Comment: He is also Argentinean.\n20:33 Comment: Yes, like five other players in the application.\n20:35 Comment: But there were originally four of them today.\n20:37 Comment: The fifth one came out.\n20:39 Comment: But instead of another Argentine.\n20:41 Comment: Dzhenuan Leonidov continues.\n20:43 Comment: And so, like everyone else.\n20:47 Comment: He feels quite confident.\n20:48 Comment: Not a single memorable moment.\n20:49 Comment: Except for the collision situation.\n20:52 Comment: There was no time for the visitors' goal in the penalty area.\n20:55 Comment: And the goalkeeper’s team, que, arrived for this next trip.\n20:59 Comment: So far we haven’t really had to retreat from this game.\n21:3 Comment: This is a very interesting player.\n21:5 Comment: Of course number 42, Amadou Divara.\n21:9 Comment: Ziliński was still king.\n21:11 Comment: And here is a good move by Christiano Maggio.\n21:15 Comment: Loshald closed this zone Idiotyatio.\n21:17 Comment: And in the end he knocked the ball out for the corners.\n21:19 Comment: Let's go, let's go corners.\n21:21 Comment: And what really becomes interesting is how Napoleon is going to get three points.\n21:28 Comment: Because you said, Champions League.\n21:30 Comment: Well, firstly, the second and third places in Italy are fundamentally different.\n21:33 Comment: Fundamentally.\n21:34 Comment: And secondly, Lazo, Inter are nearby below.\n21:38 Comment: So you can't lose points.\n21:41 Comment: Angular.\n21:43 Comment: Showed that there would be a serve.\n21:47 Comment: And Dagulyamsu is served everywhere.\n21:50 Comment: Well, he has a left leg, yes, that's why he.\n21:54 Comment: Good cross and clears the ball.\n21:57 Comment: Well, the goalkeeper finally entered the game, because the serve was actually a shot on goal.\n22:1 Comment: But the goalkeeper coped with it and the attack continues.\n22:4 Comment: Jackerin returns the ball into the penalty area.\n22:6 Comment: Some such fuss.\n22:7 Comment: Here's a push in the back.\n22:8 Comment: Kulebali fell.\n22:9 Comment: The referee does not blow the whistle.\n22:10 Comment: And let's see if Jenova can counterattack.\n22:12 Comment: Not a bad pass, but a little out of step with the player’s running pace.\n22:17 Comment: Not with the rotation that was needed.\n22:20 Comment: I had to slow down.\n22:22 Comment: But this is no longer an attack, this is just possession of the ball.\n22:25 Comment: Jenova does it with pleasure.\n22:27 Comment: Holds the ball in his own half.\n22:29 Comment: Just to prevent Napolya from running away.\n22:32 Comment: Another game, of course, from the opponent.\n22:34 Comment: Constant presence in the opposing half of the field.\n22:37 Comment: This is such a part of the defense for Jenova today.\n22:39 Comment: Foul.\n22:42 Comment: Luca Rigoni.\n22:45 Comment: Well, he played a bit harshly from behind.\n22:47 Comment: Against Jocherini.\n22:49 Comment: Mertens moves a little deeper back.\n22:52 Comment: To help with the ball draw.\n22:54 Comment: Napoleon drops a little bit of Incini.\n22:56 Comment: 23 minutes have already been played.\n22:58 Comment: And so far Lorenzo is somehow not noticeable at all.\n23:1 Comment: The fans love him very much.\n23:4 Comment: In principle, in my opinion, Incini is not a player of Napoleon’s level.\n23:7 Comment: Not at the level of the ambitions that exist.\n23:10 Comment: But without such a figure it’s difficult.\n23:13 Comment: Moreover, sometimes it shoots straight.\n23:17 Comment: In a figurative sense.\n23:18 Comment: It can strike.\n23:20 Comment: Hit the top nine.\n23:21 Comment: Give out some kind of match.\n23:23 Comment: Bright.\n23:27 Comment: Devara has now participated in the re-pass twice.\n23:30 Comment: It is used by partners.\n23:32 Comment: They always join in their attacks.\n23:34 Comment: A good example of how European scouts work.\n23:38 Comment: Because this young man is Guinean.\n23:41 Comment: He started playing football in his homeland.\n23:43 Comment: That is, this is not an imported person.\n23:45 Comment: Not the son of an immigrant.\n23:47 Comment: He started playing football at home.\n23:50 Comment: Played until I was 14 years old.\n23:52 Comment: And an Italian scout found him at a tournament in Africa.\n23:55 Comment: Saw.\n23:56 Comment: And he brought it to Italy.\n23:58 Comment: Already more or less since I passed the basics of football.\n24:2 Comment: Young man.\n24:3 Comment: By the way, he does not have any European passport.\n24:6 Comment: Just Guinean for now.\n24:8 Comment: Must play for the Gwin national team.\n24:10 Comment: If he is invited.\n24:12 Comment: Shakirin, not a U-turn.\n24:14 Comment: It's just crazy.\n24:15 Comment: Can't this go smoothly?\n24:16 Comment: Calmly.\n24:17 Comment: Rugwaitz held his position.\n24:19 Comment: And the supply went nowhere.\n24:20 Comment: Towards Vratarskaya.\n24:22 Comment: But Napoleon, I believe, if after 5 minutes you look at the statistics on the percentage of possession and on territorial advantage, of course, they are already taking away.\n24:31 Comment: Taking away territory.\n24:33 Comment: Minute by minute Diavaran.\n24:38 Comment: Mertens goes deep very often.\n24:40 Comment: But now Nsinye has the ball.\n24:42 Comment: And Mertens opened up on the flank.\n24:45 Comment: He almost got ahead of Munoz.\n24:52 Comment: It's still a paradoxical game.\n24:53 Comment: Two teams that demonstrate effective football in almost every match.\n24:58 Comment: But if this match is successful for Napole, it is unsuccessful for Genua.\n25:1 Comment: However, in almost every game both of them concede and score.\n25:5 Comment: Today the game is going on completely without chances.\n25:7 Comment: I attribute this to Genua’s very serious attitude after a long unsuccessful streak.\n25:15 Comment: But it’s still a draw, even if no one is talking about victory.\n25:19 Comment: A draw on such an away trip, of course, will be an incentive for fans to still support their team properly in the next home match.\n25:28 Comment: And don't boo or insult the team owner.\n25:32 Comment: Well, Napoleon is still not at all turning on the speed at which it is necessary to play against a team that is so well set up and is still performing very well.\n25:43 Comment: Not very good defensively.\n25:44 Comment: In defense, not allowing in the force-appetizing English goal.\n25:47 Comment: Neapolitans need speed, speed.\n25:51 Comment: Well, we practically don’t see the same Mertons, the same Hamshik playing with each other.\n25:55 Comment: Conventional football is characteristic of today's Naples, but for now these are isolated outbreaks, nothing more.\n26:4 Comment: Well, the ball went into Reina’s half of the field.\n26:8 Comment: And Regoni already turned on the speed along the flank.\n26:12 Comment: Connection.\n26:14 Comment: But he didn’t have time to make the pass to Dark Lazarevich.\n26:18 Comment: It seems to me that another thing is that Naples is one of the few teams in Italy that still plays by controlling the ball.\n26:24 Comment: And when you do have, well, a few, as we eventually found out, changes in the lineup compared to the usual combination of players,\n26:33 Comment: then at the level of instincts some things simply disappear.\n26:36 Comment: And Devara is not yet very actively playing forward, yes, more often somewhere back.\n26:40 Comment: And the second central midfielder Zelensky, to be honest, I don’t really understand what he’s doing now.\n26:42 Comment: Zelensky, to be honest, I don’t really understand where he stands now.\n26:43 Comment: The same, probably, I don’t really understand what his role is.\n26:45 Comment: Well, he's the only one who has created momentum in your account so far.\n26:49 Comment: But the role is really strange, considering that Incini was just moving back, Mertas was moving back,\n26:55 Comment: he may not be trusted as much as the game designer.\n26:59 Comment: But I also have a question for Hamshik. That's what I have personally for now. He is not visible.\n27:4 Comment: Golba Genua opened up the game and made it more interesting,\n27:7 Comment: therefore, from this point of view, you have to root for Gol Genua,\n27:10 Comment: because if Napoleon scores, it will, on the contrary, kill the game completely,\n27:13 Comment: the floor will play calmly but withholding from my wife I think to climb at 1\n27:16 Comment: There won’t be much forward, on the contrary, he will try to dig in and not repeat\n27:21 Comment: the collapse of the balloon that occurred with the previous opponent on the floor\n27:26 Comment: missed tea but on the other hand from something on the field then stop playing\n27:30 Comment: if they score one there is no one I can stop but really time\n27:34 Comment: ghost of a match in the Champions League, after all, today is the 10th, play on the 15th so that\n27:41 Comment: this reality is very close, I agree with you, there may be a lack of ruts\n27:48 Comment: does not give a real explosion to one of the flanks and it turns out\n27:55 Comment: equal bright game on both sides triphonic\n28:0 Comment: if you like, positionally they attacked, a rare case when the team finally\n28:4 Comment: managed to place a number of good\n28:9 Comment: transfers until I made a mistake insin, who is in\n28:11 Comment: direction\n28:11 Comment: made a transmission in what is called the direction of ghulam, but it was not at all\n28:15 Comment: It’s as if Gena Iz could have played more accurately themselves, but they gave the sword to their opponent Insina\n28:20 Comment: accelerated but sometimes he succeeds as you say but the truth is he succeeds\n28:25 Comment: much less often than Mertons and now he even hit the corner flank\n28:30 Comment: replay of the brightest episode at the gate, the only episode we saw\n28:36 Comment: in the genius of the broken man in the action of the gate Jenu corner and\n28:41 Comment: sits us will receive specificationnos 15 numa\n29:8 Comment: Jocherini, although he is not a striker\n29:11 Comment: What is metroskept called?\n29:13 Comment: So they have to fight for the top ball\n29:15 Comment: Absolutely no need\n29:15 Comment: Oh, how beautifully Diawara played\n29:17 Comment: And on touch, pass to the right\n29:20 Comment: Well, now they can play Jocherini from below\n29:22 Comment: Diawar's cross, no, he doesn't have time\n29:24 Comment: And pay attention to the transfer of Jocherini\n29:26 Comment: Which everyone remembers the Italian national team\n29:28 Comment: What crosses did he do on horseback?\n29:30 Comment: Because there were players who could be pinned on\n29:32 Comment: Now I made a low pass\n29:34 Comment: Counting on the fact that Diawara is ahead\n29:36 Comment: Can play with a bayonet and get ahead of the defender\n29:38 Comment: What he hangs on horseback is completely meaningless\n29:40 Comment: This fight will be 100% lost\n29:42 Comment: What's surprising is that so far\n29:44 Comment: They didn’t try their only corner\n29:47 Comment: Play with an accent\n29:49 Comment: On the high ones, on the defenders\n29:50 Comment: And to the near corner of the goalkeeper\n29:52 Comment: There's a canopy, there are few of them on the corner\n29:53 Comment: And what’s more, Nicoli Boleini and Albertl didn’t run there\n29:56 Comment: If someone high up ran there\n29:58 Comment: It would be logical, I agree\n29:59 Comment: The team played 30 minutes to zero\n30:2 Comment: Napoli Genu, and the first match of the 24th round\n30:5 Comment: Napoli\n30:5 Comment: The Federation allowed to play earlier\n30:7 Comment: Interests of Eurocups\n30:9 Comment: And Italy in Eurocups\n30:12 Comment: Becoming more and more relevant\n30:14 Comment: We remember very well with Alexander\n30:16 Comment:

Italians treated it like this\n30:26 Comment: In general, it’s like a minor tournament\n30:28 Comment: Always considering it a priority\n30:30 Comment: Scudetto and Serie A\n30:32 Comment: But times have changed, Italy has lost\n30:33 Comment: Fourth team in the Champions League\n30:35 Comment: Lack of normal funding\n30:38 Comment: Most clubs force\n30:39 Comment: Truly appreciate\n30:42 Comment: Participation in Eurocups\n30:44 Comment: Corner taken by Napoli\n30:45 Comment: High serve this time, but didn't reach it\n30:50 Comment: Nobody before the ball\n30:52 Comment: It looks like Mertens is offside here.\n30:55 Comment: But the most important thing is that he didn’t get the ball\n30:58 Comment: Diawara, again he is where he needs to be\n31:1 Comment: Good, very efficient, very tenacious\n31:3 Comment: Did a huge amount of work\n31:5 Comment: It works tirelessly\n31:7 Comment: On the football field, it's a midfielder\n31:9 Comment: I think he has a very bright future\n31:11 Comment: Zelinsky with the ball\n31:13 Comment: The transmission is excellent Maggio, there is a choice\n31:15 Comment: High serve, well, probably too far\n31:19 Comment: The ball flew from the epicenter\n31:21 Comment: But this could be a defense error\n31:23 Comment: But only an out in favor of Napoli\n31:27 Comment: Jokerini asks to hurry up\n31:29 Comment: Maggio, it seems to me that you know what's on the machine\n31:31 Comment: I remember Edin St. Cavani was there a couple of seasons ago\n31:33 Comment: Brilliant header\n31:35 Comment: And therefore with my eyes closed\n31:37 Comment: Maggio then played mainly in the lineup\n31:39 Comment: When was Cavani\n31:41 Comment: And he doesn't look there, he thinks he's Uruguayan\n31:43 Comment: The brilliant one is there, but he's been gone for a long time\n31:45 Comment: By the way, 29 goals this season\n31:47 Comment: Cavani finished off 29 matches\n31:49 Comment: Well, Ibrahimovic left, he began to open up\n31:51 Comment: Completely different\n31:53 Comment: After all, the corner judge considered that the ball had left the field\n31:55 Comment: Here they scattered to the various broadcasts of the

Canopy\n32:5 Comment: Excellent cross, corner kick\n32:7 Comment: Finally got the chance, but can't score\n32:9 Comment: Let's watch it on repeat\n32:11 Comment: Like Coulibaley, he was unlikely to hit the turn\n32:13 Comment: He was falling, and while falling he accidentally caught the ball\n32:15 Comment: Well, you can score\n32:17 Comment: Well, where did he hit?\n32:19 Comment: He hit with a turn, tried to punch\n32:21 Comment: It just turned out a little ridiculous\n32:23 Comment: Final\n32:25 Comment: The final beat of it\n32:27 Comment: Jump and its compositions\n32:29 Comment: Gymnastic, but well done anyway\n32:31 Comment: It was a good try\n32:33 Comment: But Sari got excited\n32:35 Comment: Came forward\n32:37 Comment: But it already feels like he’s rubbing his hands\n32:39 Comment: Let's go, let's go the game ahead\n32:41 Comment: Zelensky\n32:43 Comment: I asked for two attacks please\n32:45 Comment: With his help\n32:47 Comment: And it opened just in

Comment: And here you go\n33:7 Comment: Let's go, let's go corners\n33:9 Comment: But if you look at the numbers\n33:11 Comment: Nothing fundamentally changes\n33:13 Comment: Still\n33:15 Comment: All numbers are in favor of ball possession\n33:17 Comment: By territorial advantage\n33:19 Comment: In favor of John\n33:21 Comment: I think it's still lagging behind\n33:23 Comment: Because nothing has changed at all\n33:25 Comment: I need to update it somehow\n33:27 Comment: No, 33 minutes online\n33:29 Comment: A little strange\n33:31 Comment: Goalkeeper's corner\n33:33 Comment: So what, Hamshik struck\n33:37 Comment: Changed\n33:39 Comment: After all, Napoli already has a territorial advantage\n33:41 Comment: Possession 52-48\n33:43 Comment: Well, approximately equal\n33:45 Comment: It has changed, it has changed\n33:47 Comment: And look how the percentage of accurate passes is growing\n33:49 Comment: 83 already at Napoli\n33:51 Comment: Despite the fact that the number of gears is already 200\n33:53 Comment: That is, the further the team plays\n33:55 Comment: The more accurately she plays the pass\n33:57 Comment: Well, we found it, we found our moves\n33:59 Comment: Because you have three, relatively speaking\n34:1 Comment: Player of the nearest reserve\n34:3 Comment: On the field\n34:5 Comment: Hoolibali\n34:7 Comment: I realized that it was not worth the risk\n34:9 Comment: They throw it to the goalkeeper\n34:11 Comment: Well, Gamshik throws forward\n34:13 Comment: And there's no offside\n34:15 Comment: At Jackie Reaney's\n34:17 Comment: Hard to say\n34:19 Comment: Was on the siter or not?\n34:21 Comment: I think the referee raised the flag\n34:23 Comment: In any case, the ball flew to the goalkeeper\n34:25 Comment: But what different players open up\n34:27 Comment: Yes, apparently Emmanuel got in\n34:29 Comment: Behind the defender\n34:31 Comment: But there are options\n34:33 Comment: All sorts of options\n34:35 Comment: Remember, we discussed how in the match with Polermo\n34:37 Comment: They regularly used the diagonal\n34:39 Comment: Bringing Kalihon\n34:41 Comment: To the same point\n34:43 Comment: In general, different players gave him a turn there\n34:45 Comment: There is no Kalikhon today\n34:47 Comment: And everything is known by comparison\n34:49 Comment: Importance of a player to a team\n34:51 Comment: You can really appreciate it when the player is not there\n34:53 Comment: Kalihon is the one that pulls\n34:55 Comment: This sheet of attack\n34:57 Comment: All the way to the flank\n34:59 Comment: To the very edge\n35:1 Comment: And today there is no such person\n35:3 Comment: Beautiful\n35:5 Comment: Kick with a slightly higher turn\n35:7 Comment: But here's Lorenzo Incini\n35:9 Comment: Got it now\n35:11 Comment: Looks like it's even angular\n35:13 Comment: Yes, yes, the goalkeeper dragged\n35:15 Comment: Beautiful moment\n35:17 Comment: Beautifully struck by Incini\n35:19 Comment: It was well played from the wing here\n35:21 Comment: And not a pass to the weight, but a pass to the blow\n35:23 Comment: To the top nine\n35:25 Comment: By the way, Zelinsky\n35:27 Comment: And beat the defender between the legs\n35:29 Comment: Forwarded and made the transfer\n35:31 Comment: Well, a corner, a sixth corner\n35:33 Comment: In the first half like this\n35:35 Comment: A game\n35:37 Comment: With many standards\n35:39 Comment: Unless there were no dangerous free kicks\n35:43 Comment: Here's the pitch\n35:45 Comment: Selection on the fly\n35:47 Comment: And I immediately wanted to punch Lorenzo Insini\n35:49 Comment: But sometimes his balls fly away completely somewhere\n35:51 Comment: To the ocean\n35:53 Comment: But Ghulyama does the same thing all the time\n35:55 Comment: And shoots right into the goalkeeper's box\n35:57 Comment: Apparently, there is an expectation that\n35:59 Comment: Into a pile of mali ball somehow\n36:1 Comment: Will fly there\n36:3 Comment: But it doesn’t fly in yet, as long as Genua holds on\n36:5 Comment: Score 0-0\n36:7 Comment: 37th minute of the first half\n36:9 Comment: On the field\n36:11 Comment: So far experiencing the same problems as with Palermo\n36:15 Comment: And this is a team that scored 7 goals in midweek\n36:17 Comment: At the gates of Bologna\n36:19 Comment: But they played 10 on 10\n36:21 Comment: Most of the match\n36:23 Comment: And then Bologna played 11 vs 9\n36:25 Comment: Bologna, yes\n36:27 Comment: It was better not to play at all\n36:29 Comment: In the last week\n36:31 Comment: Two technical defeats would have been nicer\n36:33 Comment: Because 11 vs 9 lose the match\n36:35 Comment: It's an incredible shame\n36:37 Comment: Not that you ever missed\n36:39 Comment: When you had equal lineups\n36:41 Comment: At the same time, the team is good and the coach is good\n36:43 Comment: Namely, miss for a long time\n36:45 Comment: Playing for a very long time with two players\n36:47 Comment: Personal\n36:49 Comment: And before that get 1-7\n36:51 Comment: Good pass from the right flank\n36:53 Comment: And shot Maggio\n36:55 Comment: But now there was a scoring situation\n36:57 Comment: Because goalkeeper Jenu\n36:59 Comment: It seems to me that I didn’t come out of the gate very confidently\n37:1 Comment: He was just lucky\n37:3 Comment: That the most experienced Burdist insured him\n37:5 Comment: And another corner\n37:7 Comment: Yes, corner, seventh\n37:9 Comment: At Napoli, well, that's a lot\n37:11 Comment: Really a lot\n37:15 Comment: No results yet\n37:17 Comment: No real scoring chance\n37:19 Comment: It was after the corner kick\n37:21 Comment: Well maybe\n37:23 Comment: To someone on the right\n37:25 Comment: For a change\n37:27 Comment: Spinning away from rivals\n37:29 Comment: From the goalkeeper, from the defenders\n37:31 Comment: But a little later\n37:33 Comment: Since they are currently providing assistance to the player Jen\n37:35 Comment: Napoli have a very decent reserve\n37:37 Comment: How can you celebrate\n37:39 Comment: Jenu also has a good selection of players\n37:41 Comment: Therefore, taking into account the matches in the Champions League\n37:43 Comment: Perhaps Sari will make some replacements\n37:45 Comment: Well there is\n37:47 Comment: Certain choice\n37:49 Comment: Probably Milik will appear\n37:51 Comment: Since he's in stock\n37:53 Comment: And he will slowly get in shape\n37:55 Comment: How do you think?\n37:57 Comment: Well, sooner or later Milik must appear\n37:59 Comment: Well, the choice in midfield\n38:1 Comment: We already talked\n38:3 Comment: And Alana, and Jorgini, and Maksimovich are there\n38:5 Comment: Husai will return\n38:7 Comment: It is clear that Pavaletti\n38:9 Comment: Would like to get his own chance\n38:11 Comment: Big hitter\n38:13 Comment: Second substitution\n38:15 Comment: Meanwhile\n38:17 Comment: U\n38:19 Comment: Guests\n38:21 Comment: Cataldi comes out\n38:23 Comment: And Miguelo Viloso\n38:25 Comment: Got damaged\n38:27 Comment: But they really played under some other type of canopy\n38:29 Comment: Nothing happened on the right\n38:31 Comment: Cataldi\n38:33 Comment: Shined for Lazio\n38:35 Comment: They even called him\n38:37 Comment: Rising star\n38:39 Comment: But for now here\n38:41 Comment: Set off\n38:43 Comment: Play more often\n38:45 Comment: Maybe join an easier team\n38:47 Comment: But of course it’s an unpleasant situation for the guests\n38:49 Comment: Because two forced substitutions\n38:51 Comment: At such a difficult time\n38:53 Comment: On such a difficult road\n38:55 Comment: When, of course, you need strength in the second half\n38:57 Comment: And accordingly it is possible for the coach\n38:59 Comment: Somehow to work with replacements\n39:1 Comment: Makes it difficult for the coaching staff to act\n39:3 Comment: Will make it difficult\n39:5 Comment: Future membrane\n39:7 Comment: After the break\n39:9 Comment: Because two of the three replacements have already been used\n39:11 Comment: But Jenu still holds all the lines\n39:13 Comment: Holds zones\n39:15 Comment: And especially there is nowhere for the players to run\n39:17 Comment: On the field\n39:19 Comment: And Incini\n39:21 Comment: How far does he have to run?\n39:23 Comment: From the attack line to receive the ball\n39:25 Comment: And Mertens is not visible at all\n39:27 Comment: With his signature maneuvers\n39:29 Comment: Shift from flank to center\n39:31 Comment: And with these sharp shots on goal\n39:33 Comment: Jenu's right flank attack\n39:35 Comment: But it's very neat here\n39:37 Comment: Lorenzo Insini played in defense\n39:39 Comment: Helped partners\n39:41 Comment: Retreating along your flank\n39:43 Comment: A little back\n39:45 Comment: Lazovic ran forward\n39:47 Comment: And here\n39:49 Comment: But so far it’s not possible\n39:51 Comment: Lazovich to run\n39:53 Comment: Until that position\n39:55 Comment: With

ball\n44:27 Comment: Managed to break through\n44:29 Comment: But what did you ask from Zelinsk\n44:31 Comment: Yes, but now he doesn’t have long legs at all\n44:33 Comment: A little short moves quickly\n44:35 Comment: And you see, to reach the ball properly\n44:37 Comment: And it was literally almost enough\n44:39 Comment: One more step and punch with the other foot\n44:41 Comment: Maybe it would be more comfortable\n44:43 Comment: After all, with this poke, as they say,\n44:45 Comment: In the yard it doesn’t matter which foot you use\n44:47 Comment: But it's a rare case when it passed\n44:49 Comment: The transmission is so sharp\n44:51 Comment: Penetrating at Napolis\n44:53 Comment: Own half of the field\n44:55 Comment: So in general Jenuel\n44:57 Comment: Was very strong\n\nSecond Half:\n0:1 Comment: In the first half, Cataldi appeared, Rigoni plays Lazovic, Hilimark, Loshal, Paladin and Semyon.\n0:10 Comment: Giovanni Semena, son of Diego Semena. Head coach Ivan Yurievich.\n0:14 Comment: Alexander, I think I’ll have to repeat it. Still, Jenu is not the most famous or popular team.\n0:19 Comment: Do you want numbers? Yes, give me the numbers. Well, why do you need numbers? Well, let's figure it out.\n0:23 Comment: I have no TV viewers. Moreover, they are completely invisible on the field.\n0:25 Comment: Especially. We need to repeat it. They are bright and big. Let Napoleon name the lineup, and when we get to Jenu, then we...\n0:32 Comment: Pepper Eira in the Naples goal. Field players. 33rd Albiol, 11th Maju, 26th Kulebali, 31st Gulam, 17th Hamshik, 4th Dzhekerini, 20th Zelinsky, 42nd Devora, 14th Mertens, 24th Insine, Sarri, head coach of Napoleon.\n0:47 Comment: And with numbers, it’s still the visiting team. Goalkeeper Lomano, everything is clear with him. 8th Burdisu, 3rd Gentiletti.\n0:53 Comment: No, wait. There is no 3rd. These are those who played in the starting lineup. 21st Orban, 24th Munoz, 44th Munio, Veloso left and came in instead...\n1:5 Comment: 94th Cataldi. 94th Cataldi. Lazovic, 22nd, Eregonid, 30th. Hilymark, 15th. Hilimark, 15th, Horse, 93rd, Paladin, 11th and Semyon, junior. Number 9 has shown absolutely nothing yet.\n1:21 Comment: Georgy Shardantsev found something to occupy the first minute and a half of the second half. Well, now let’s watch carefully, because Napoleon, of course, won’t just want to give up points.\n1:32 Comment: Now it’s a free kick, a turn, a kick. I feel a little sorry for Mertonians. He stood there for the entire first half because they didn’t notice him and somehow the balls didn’t reach him.\n1:43 Comment: But even here he took it and immediately rushed to score. Or you could have played a pass. But let's watch the bastards too. 25 minutes and he was completely in the shadows.\n1:53 Comment: You know, I have a feeling that Jenu tried his best. This is not just an accident, not just Napoleon’s unwillingness to play his football. He played very tightly.\n2:3 Comment: No, we talked about this, that for Ivan Yuryevich, Dzhenu’s head coach, this may be a decisive match.\n2:9 Comment: Because, given the negative reaction from the fans that was addressed to the club president in the previous match, he simply cannot work until Jenu’s next match at home.\n2:23 Comment: And all they have on tour is playing Gena. They are also playing away in the next match. Therefore, for the coach, today’s match against Genu is almost the most important of the season.\n2:34 Comment: Because if there is a defeat now and a defeat in the next round.\n2:39 Comment: But in the next round it’s unlikely. Still, Pescara must be beaten.\n2:43 Comment: So that's the whole point. We need to take points in this match and try to win against Pescara.\n2:49 Comment: That’s where Jackerin has now lost his shoes and is giving a penalty in court.\n2:53 Comment: Therefore, yes, of course, we said from the very beginning that Jenu has the maximum attitude and Napol has the minimum.\n3:0 Comment: One is multiplied by the other, so we get what we have.\n3:3 Comment: But judging by these shoes, Italy is generally a country of shoes; after all, the mood is now good.\n3:9 Comment: And the joints, and the desire of Napoleon, no joke, to really play his football, to find his rhythm.\n3:16 Comment: Apparently, Sarri probably worked in this regard during the break. He's such a good motivator.\n3:22 Comment: Lamana asks three players to hit the wall.\n3:28 Comment: And Devara, despite her young age, enjoys the trust of her much older comrades.\n3:34 Comment: And the young Guinean allows him to take the penalty kick.\n3:38 Comment: Smooth casting, but everything is very calm here.\n3:42 Comment: Incini did not understand what Devara wanted, throwing up his hands in surprise at the attacking Napoleon.\n3:46 Comment: Devar really had a strange idea about who he was going to address this program to.\n3:52 Comment: If Incini sits on the shoulders of the Jokerina, then they can beat someone.\n3:56 Comment: It's strange that this element is rarely used, especially in such undersized teams.\n4:0 Comment: Now it could be dangerous.\n4:4 Comment: Jokerina is high.\n4:6 Comment: Here, here, here.\n4:8 Comment: Well, by the way, in rugby they do this according to the rules.\n4:10 Comment: They pull their player higher and he catches the ball.\n4:14 Comment: In our own football, this would probably be according to the rules.\n4:16 Comment: Mertens, Mertens, what's going on?\n4:22 Comment: No pass, no goal, but finishing, kick, goal!\n4:28 Comment: Piotr Zielinski and Dries Mertens finally do something in this match.\n4:33 Comment: Well, by the way, we saw Zelinsky in the second half of the half as a very important figure.\n4:38 Comment: Well, Mertens always seemed like that to us, and that’s what he is.\n4:42 Comment: He got involved immediately from the beginning of the second half and beat three.\n4:45 Comment: He didn’t shoot himself, they shot on the pass, the rebound.\n4:48 Comment: And Zelinsky really sticks it in, a very healthy ball.\n4:51 Comment: In the far corner of the goal, 1-0, Napoleon takes the lead.\n4:53 Comment: Let's watch it again, enjoy watching how Napoleon plays this attack.\n4:57 Comment: Well, Healy defenseman Mark Shved was wrong.\n5:0 Comment: I had to come up with something more interesting than taking it out through the center.\n5:4 Comment: Of course, you’re lying in a curtain, it’s difficult to do anything.\n5:8 Comment: But this convulsive movement of the Swedish defender decided the episode in favor of Napoleon, in favor of Peter Zelinsky.\n5:15 Comment: But well done, it's a great shot.\n5:17 Comment: Now we will find out whether my predictions in the first half are true, that the game can stop there.\n5:23 Comment: Whether Napolei plays to hold the score or vice versa, the game could open up.\n5:27 Comment: And we will see those same numerous goals in both directions.\n5:31 Comment: Because the game may now go on a collision course.\n5:34 Comment: And it seems to be opening up. Jackerini with the ball.\n5:37 Comment: Napolei, it seems, judging by the first seconds after the game began to accelerate, is not going to stop.\n5:42 Comment: Mertons immediately follows from a very decent distance.\n5:46 Comment: And that means Dries is fine.\n5:48 Comment: Because if there was even the slightest suspicion of injury.\n5:52 Comment: We remember how he lay on the lawn in the first minutes of the match.\n5:55 Comment: I think they won’t let him out for the second half.\n5:57 Comment: Yes, Dries Mertons came out and immediately scored a goal.\n6:0 Comment: Let's qualify it this way.\n6:2 Comment: And I myself had two more moments.\n6:5 Comment: He also opened up for a shot in the penalty area.\n6:7 Comment: And now after the score is 1-0.\n6:10 Comment: Well, Jeno is not hopeless.\n6:11 Comment: I am absolutely sure that both Napolei and the opponent will open up.\n6:15 Comment: And we will see football like Bologna.\n6:18 Comment: But then it was 4-1 at halftime.\n6:19 Comment: Now it's 0-0.\n6:20 Comment: Maybe they will score 3-4 in a half anyway.\n6:24 Comment: And now the moment.\n6:25 Comment: Well, what does Mertons do, of course, beats anyone, whenever.\n6:30 Comment: Now Napoli has begun to play as befits a team that plays in the Champions League.\n6:35 Comment: Which is leading in Serie A.\n6:36 Comment: The speeds are turned on and the game starts.\n6:38 Comment: Well, Mertons, of course, is handsome.\n6:40 Comment: He played brilliantly now.\n6:42 Comment: Then his partners make claims against him.\n6:44 Comment: Gabshik, first of all, why didn’t you pass after the play?\n6:47 Comment: But nevertheless, the moment looked very beautiful, dynamic.\n6:50 Comment: And note, for the second time in a row.\n6:51 Comment: The selection is in the line, as Renat Belyadinov so beautifully put it, remember?\n6:56 Comment: Batting zone.\n6:58 Comment: Chop.\n6:59 Comment: That's where Zelinsky shot and scored.\n7:2 Comment: Now from there I almost got into the other corner of Devara’s goal.\n7:6 Comment: Demand Daliev after the settled part.\n7:10 Comment: Well, we demand Napoleon, we demand goals.\n7:13 Comment: No, the game will start now.\n7:14 Comment: Everyone will wake up, I think, if anyone dozed off, and there will be football.\n7:18 Comment: Now a lot depends on Genua too, because I hope the team will not sit on the defensive\n7:22 Comment: and will not think about how not to lose big ones.\n7:25 Comment: Although, of course, there is such a temptation.\n7:27 Comment: I remember that Napoleon scored seven against his previous opponent.\n7:31 Comment: Then Yurich will definitely not reach Genoa as head coach.\n7:35 Comment: Well, special cars can, on the contrary, win, take three points, and score three or four goals themselves.\n7:39 Comment: I think he will still get to Genoa.\n7:42 Comment: No matter how they played today.\n7:43 Comment: Go try and play two halves flawlessly against this Napoleon.\n7:47 Comment: They are great, they did what they could in the first half.\n7:50 Comment: But now they just don’t see the ball.\n7:52 Comment: Hamshik free throw, rebound.\n7:54 Comment: No, the Genoese, Diawara, Diawara and Zelinsky are kicking the ball out here.\n7:59 Comment: Pay attention to who fired from these points.\n8:1 Comment: This is correct, it is logical, structural.\n8:4 Comment: So they got used to it and fit into the team game.\n8:7 Comment: And it turned out very well for them.\n8:10 Comment: Both have central midfield.\n8:12 Comment: There is still a big question about how much stronger Alan and Jorginho are at the moment.\n8:17 Comment: And Maksimovich is still there.\n8:19 Comment: There really is a huge selection in the central zone.\n8:21 Comment: Remember, they played with the same lineup all their lives, including last year.\n8:25 Comment: And now the rotation, Mertenz.\n8:27 Comment: My God, this is incredible.\n8:29 Comment: He's already gone overboard on this.\n8:31 Comment: And yet Napoleon gets the corner.\n8:34 Comment: Why? He pleases the public, he pleases us, Dries Mertenz.\n8:37 Comment: Now he performed the pass very gracefully, a foppish one, of course.\n8:41 Comment: But he felt the game, he felt his dribbling.\n8:44 Comment: And the game went well for Naples.\n8:45 Comment: It all looks very exciting.\n8:51 Comment: Yes, this is a completely new type of football, which Naples has begun to achieve.\n8:56 Comment: And not today and not with Sarah.\n8:59 Comment: And also with Matzarey, and with Benitos.\n9:1 Comment: Very different coaches.\n9:2 Comment: Beautiful serve, beautiful canopy, empty goal.\n9:7 Comment: Mertenz did not get into the fight now, he lost the single combat.\n9:11 Comment: And Kulebali, of course, could, it seems to me, with his ability to play with his head, really play with his head.\n9:16 Comment: Be careful, yes.\n9:17 Comment: He held on, by the way, he was not offside here.\n9:20 Comment: It seems to me that he did not calculate, yes, the point at which he would come into contact with the ball.\n9:25 Comment: To the strength of the pass, maybe.\n9:27 Comment: I didn’t have time to jump out properly.\n9:29 Comment: Huge advantage for Napoli at the start of the second half.\n9:31 Comment: One goal has already been scored.\n9:32 Comment: Napoli continues to attack Ghoulam.\n9:34 Comment: The Algerian failed to raise the cross now.\n9:36 Comment: The ball is higher.\n9:38 Comment: Well, he will throw, apparently, from behind the sideline.\n9:40 Comment: It's not his.\n9:44 Comment: Oh, no, him, his flank.\n9:46 Comment: Everything is correct.\n9:48 Comment: And Zigoulyam is the coach-defender of the Algerian national team.\n9:52 Comment: She performed unsuccessfully at the African Cup of Nations.\n9:56 Comment: But suffice it to say that everything is absolutely bad there defensively.\n9:59 Comment: And Ghulyam played in the center.\n10:1 Comment: Because there are no worthy defenders in this position.\n10:5 Comment: He's quite tall, but still a bit sad.\n10:9 Comment: Understand that a team where, for example, Riat Morres, the best player of last season in the English Championship, is playing is not going anywhere.\n10:17 Comment: Another moment for Napoli.\n10:20 Comment: It turned out to be an accurate pass in front of the penalty area.\n10:22 Comment: Well, we will definitely see Genua in attack.\n10:24 Comment: Both Simeons and Paladina.\n10:32 Comment: The steamer is on the right flank.\n10:34 Comment: Now the downside for Genua is that the team has already made two forced substitutions.\n10:39 Comment: And here there is only one option left to release someone forward, and not three, as would be the case if there were replacements with their name.\n10:45 Comment: There is Goran Pancho, who, of course, does not play very well.\n10:48 Comment: And Murissio Pinili, who played in Palermo, by the way.\n10:51 Comment: They can enter the field.\n10:53 Comment: In the same Palermo that we have already remembered more than once today.\n10:57 Comment: But Lazovic earned a corner and there will be a serve.\n11:0 Comment: Feed is high.\n11:2 Comment: The blow, no, did not reach this ball.\n11:4 Comment: And he jumped out well.\n11:8 Comment: This 1-0 score doesn't guarantee it will happen yet.\n11:11 Comment: But, of course, that doesn't mean it will happen.\n11:13 Comment: Not bad.\n11:15 Comment: This 1-0 score does not yet guarantee three points on the field.\n11:19 Comment: And we have, I think, an interesting 30 minutes ahead of us.\n11:23 Comment: And it’s not the one or the other who is warming up, but the curious, by the way, football player Tarapt,\n11:29 Comment: who played in Milan for some time.\n11:32 Comment: Moreover, at one time he was generally a player in the main team.\n11:35 Comment: Marakaltsev.\n11:37 Comment: And this is an attacking midfielder.\n11:40 Comment: Isn’t it too early, Alexander, to make the last change?\n11:44 Comment: In my opinion, it's too early.\n11:46 Comment: But the score is 0-1 and somehow we need to shake up the game.\n11:48 Comment: Now at these moments Semyon could not be noticed.\n11:52 Comment: It's the wrong fold that's clinging.\n11:55 Comment: Oh, great, Insigne, and it's beautiful here.\n11:57 Comment: The pass is wonderful.\n11:59 Comment: But we should have done the penultimate pass more carefully now.\n12:3 Comment: Your beloved Zelinsky was wrong.\n12:5 Comment: In that situation, when it was necessary to play perfectly, and no one interfered,\n12:8 Comment: he made a mistake and ruined a simply amazingly developing attack.\n12:12 Comment: But in touch after a very quick and sharp pass to him,\n12:16 Comment: I will stand up for the Pole,\n12:18 Comment: it wasn’t easy, he played Mertonets’ move,\n12:20 Comment: but even his speed was not enough,\n12:23 Comment: and there, it seems, if he was reliable, Tarapt enters the field even before the 60th minute.\n12:29 Comment: Despite the fact that the replacement is the last place for Rafael Paladin.\n12:35 Comment: Well, there, in that position, Tarapt is a player who prefers to open from the flank.\n12:45 Comment: So Diego Semyon remains at the forefront of Genu.\n12:49 Comment: And, of course, they don’t have such hammers now.\n12:51 Comment: They always had some good scoring striker.\n12:54 Comment: Like Palacio, the previous Argentine, who is interested in Melita, Diego Melita.\n13:0 Comment: Jena always had a good center forward,\n13:2 Comment: scoring a lot of goals.\n13:3 Comment: But there is something missing in this composition, in this combination and in this particular team.\n13:10 Comment: For some reason they didn’t keep Destra, although he showed his worth.\n13:16 Comment: It’s hard to play in a team that doesn’t attack much, without the so-called scoring form.\n13:22 Comment: Well, Semyon's 10 goals doesn't suit you.\n13:24 Comment: I just can't see him today.\n13:25 Comment: In general, the game was like this in the first half.\n13:27 Comment: Not real at all.\n13:28 Comment: Some kind of veil, as if it had not accelerated in the fog.\n13:35 Comment: Well, now we see football.\n13:37 Comment: Yes, Napoli may be quite reserved in the second half.\n13:41 Comment: But it will run and run for Jen.\n13:43 Comment: And Lazarevich is already ready to make the third pass.\n13:47 Comment: But it is not for him to make the pass to Hiri Mark in the center.\n13:52 Comment: Loshald.\n13:53 Comment: Tarap tried the ball on the flank while we didn’t see it, but only in the center.\n13:58 Comment: And an inaccurate pass from Diego Loshalda.\n14:9 Comment: Well, everything's fine. Encourages your partner.\n14:11 Comment: They say, thanks to them for helping me move.\n14:15 Comment: Inaccurate transmission.\n14:16 Comment: This is what we noted in the first half.\n14:18 Comment: A bit too much.\n14:19 Comment: 25 for Napoli, 30 for Losald.\n14:22 Comment: 35 for Napoli, 32 for Genu.\n14:25 Comment: But the percentage is about 80, I think.\n14:32 Comment: A series of mutual mistakes.\n14:34 Comment: First the hosts made a mistake, then the guests.\n14:36 Comment: Well, now Napoli took the ball.\n14:38 Comment: And Albiol slowly begins the attack.\n14:41 Comment: It seems to me that Napoli missed the moment when they could have tried to score a second goal.\n14:45 Comment: Now the emotions have cooled down a little after the goal was scored.\n14:48 Comment: And Napoli continues to make too many mistakes.\n14:51 Comment: Jenu walks forward.\n14:52 Comment: If Jena scores soon, it will certainly make the ending of the match much more interesting.\n14:58 Comment: The ball is underfoot, kick, and hit the corner.\n15:1 Comment: Half an hour more to play.\n15:3 Comment: 1-0.\n15:4 Comment: Napoli wins.\n15:5 Comment: Oscar Hilyamark.\n15:6 Comment: Shot at mid-range.\n15:8 Comment: The ball, by the way, fell very well on my foot, but did not fly into the corner.\n15:12 Comment: And Pepperane, of course, took it easily.\n15:14 Comment: So off I went.\n15:15 Comment: We had to try to send it there.\n15:16 Comment: He just punched through.\n15:18 Comment: Kulebai Gamshik.\n15:20 Comment: Devoran.\n15:21 Comment: No errors yet.\n15:22 Comment: It's a pity that I just caught him.\n15:24 Comment: In words, it’s a pity that the newspaper does not provide players’ personal statistics online.\n15:28 Comment: The update here is old.\n15:30 Comment: I have already learned to press buttons, Alexander Ivanovich.\n15:33 Comment: Not that difficult.\n15:35 Comment: I see you have some again that I remembered from the 40th minute.\n15:39 Comment: The ball is much more difficult to hit.\n15:42 Comment: Yes, as for Devor, visually it feels like he has no mistakes at all.\n15:47 Comment: Just no errors.\n15:48 Comment: Kulebai, where did you go?\n15:51 Comment: Mertens into the far corner.\n15:53 Comment: This is his point.\n15:54 Comment: Insinny.\n15:55 Comment: Insinny?\n15:56 Comment: Yes.\n15:57 Comment: Portrayed by Mertens.\n15:59 Comment: Well yes, I agree.\n16:0 Comment: In general, in fact, it feels like he took a lot from him.\n16:6 Comment: Although exactly a year ago Insinni could be considered even a slightly bigger player from his squad than Mertens.\n16:14 Comment: Here is another attack, another wave rolling towards the gate.\n16:17 Comment: Somehow they don’t roll very well, but squeak heavily.\n16:20 Comment: Gamshin approached someone else's penalty area and the moment was lost.\n16:25 Comment: Mertens was nearby and immediately apologized to the goalkeeper.\n16:31 Comment: Already owns 60/40.\n16:33 Comment: Well, no, no, everything has already gone into one bowl according to the numbers.\n16:37 Comment: We moved into Napolitan and, by all indicators, attacked our opponent, outplaying them.\n16:45 Comment: But at the same time, Jenova does not leave any kind of deplorable impression for the team,\n16:50 Comment: which can only score points for 8 matches in a row.\n16:55 Comment: Well in Ferentin, 3-3 visiting Ferentin.\n16:58 Comment: Remember, before these 8 matches there was a victory over Juve 3-1.\n17:2 Comment: Juve, that is, very few people beat like that in modern football.\n17:5 Comment: Well, yes, yes.\n17:6 Comment: But the team knows how to play football.\n17:8 Comment: We don’t know what’s inside, but somehow they start losing out of the blue.\n17:13 Comment: Including the last round, it was absolutely sensational.\n17:17 Comment: I understand, they lost 24 times, and 0-1 is not their style.\n17:21 Comment: They managed to lose at home and it was after this that the conversations between the wrestlers and the president began.\n17:29 Comment: We're at 53 minutes.\n17:31 Comment: Napoleon continues to win with a score of 1-0.\n17:34 Comment: And so far there has not been a single replacement, despite the upcoming game in the Champions League.\n17:38 Comment: Let it not be the day after tomorrow, not in 2 days a third, but in 4 days.\n17:43 Comment: But nevertheless, it’s already the 60th minute, at which time almost all coaches begin to make some kind of substitutions.\n17:49 Comment: And the choice is very diverse.\n17:52 Comment: We are waiting for Arkady Milik, who started his career in Naples brightly, very brightly, to come on as a substitute.\n17:59 Comment: I’m sure they won’t give me 30 minutes, 30 means less.\n18:5 Comment: But within 10 minutes, do you think he will come out or not?\n18:8 Comment: I guess I should try it today.\n18:11 Comment: Especially if Napoleon scores another goal.\n18:13 Comment: Getting back on track is difficult.\n18:15 Comment: But Amilik made 2 doubles in the first 4 rounds.\n18:18 Comment: The presentation was really bright.\n18:22 Comment: And he started scoring not only in the championship.\n18:27 Comment: Not an accurate transfer.\n18:30 Comment: As for the scorer, he won’t come off the floor on the 11th either.\n18:33 Comment: It will come out, it will come out, don't worry.\n18:35 Comment: He has already left the field.\n18:37 Comment: Oh, the towel was replaced.\n18:39 Comment: I thought everything, at half past 11 20 minutes.\n18:42 Comment: Yes, it's sad.\n18:44 Comment: And the main thing is that none of the famous cities came out.\n18:47 Comment: Well, Tharapt, Penilla, Pandev came out.\n18:51 Comment: They're still so serious.\n18:52 Comment: Yes, it's strange.\n18:54 Comment: Again, not being inside the team,\n18:56 Comment: very difficult thousands of kilometers away\n18:58 Comment: without going around, talk about why.\n19:0 Comment: We don't know in what form.\n19:2 Comment: Maybe Pandev is completely out of shape.\n19:4 Comment: Maybe Penilla didn't practice well on camera.\n19:6 Comment: Who knows.\n19:8 Comment: Therefore, Semenov remained as a central striker.\n19:10 Comment: But he is completely invisible.\n19:12 Comment: And the Moroccan footballer, who came on as a substitute,\n19:16 Comment: a player who can play with speed.\n19:19 Comment: But in order to demonstrate speed\n19:22 Comment: he needs free space,\n19:24 Comment: which to run into, present to the player.\n19:27 Comment: So far the Neapolitans are not leaving any corridors for their rivals.\n19:31 Comment: Easy interception, shit, pass back.\n19:34 Comment: Gamshirko in two touches and not exactly.\n19:36 Comment: Gamshirko’s personal statistics today are probably much worse,\n19:39 Comment: than that of the same Divar.\n19:41 Comment: Than his, actually, I think, is average.\n19:43 Comment: Not like Hamshir, he really plays like that,\n19:46 Comment: but the ball didn't reach here.\n19:48 Comment: To no one in the attack line, Pepereida calms down.\n19:52 Comment: You know, it feels like you're really\n19:55 Comment: Initially, he was right with his message about the score 1-0.\n19:59 Comment: Napoleon in the Wave.\n20:1 Comment: This is a pleasant atmosphere that has turned out\n20:4 Comment: at the beginning of the second half, still attacked,\n20:6 Comment: and now they hold the ball so restrainedly and calmly.\n20:10 Comment: I wouldn't be surprised if they score another one\n20:12 Comment: somewhere near the end in a counterattack.\n20:14 Comment: But we will never see the real rhythmic Neapolitan play.\n20:19 Comment: But only in 5 minutes.\n20:20 Comment: 5 minutes and that's it.\n20:22 Comment: Well, what about Djenov?\n20:24 Comment: Dzhenov ahead will show us some kind of attempt now\n20:27 Comment: catch on to the ball.\n20:29 Comment: Not Diego, but Giovanni.\n20:31 Comment: Semyon lost the ball.\n20:33 Comment: Here Tarapt, you were right in defining his role,\n20:38 Comment: He still plays on the wing with great pleasure.\n20:41 Comment: And Palatine was not the second striker.\n20:45 Comment: They played evenly, in a line, one to the right, the other to the left.\n20:47 Comment: Now there is only one left.\n20:49 Comment: Semyony, and somewhere behind, in the depths,\n20:52 Comment: Tarapt walks leisurely along the flank.\n20:55 Comment: Hilimark is more noticeable now.\n20:57 Comment: Well, Lazovich got involved.\n20:59 Comment: It seems to me that Semyony made an extra touch.\n21:1 Comment: I should have turned right immediately, I wasted time.\n21:3 Comment: Well, now Lazovic throws over the sideline,\n21:5 Comment: it was revealed that he was healthy.\n21:7 Comment: Agree.\n21:9 Comment: Semeny would have made a pass, and there could have been a return pass.\n21:12 Comment: In general, there are a lot of options.\n21:14 Comment: Burdiso, long pass to the far flank.\n21:20 Comment: Tharapt played well.\n21:22 Comment: Loshal, soft casting.\n21:24 Comment: But it doesn't work.\n21:26 Comment: Lazovic misses the ball.\n21:28 Comment: And Naples has a way out of the defense.\n21:30 Comment: Again the ganshik does not make an accurate transfer.\n21:32 Comment: Already in a row.\n21:34 Comment: So what about now?\n21:36 Comment: Now I played with my neighbor.\n21:38 Comment: And violation of the rules on the card.\n21:41 Comment: Everything is lying.\n21:43 Comment: Logical.\n21:45 Comment: Overall this is Lukas Orbán.\n21:47 Comment: Orban was now deliberately fouling.\n21:49 Comment: Because I understood perfectly well\n21:51 Comment: if you give Mertenz the opportunity to take the ball,\n21:53 Comment: it will be almost a scoring attack.\n21:55 Comment: From the center of the field at Naples.\n22:3 Comment: Still didn't get an accurate pass.\n22:5 Comment: It didn’t turn out to be effective for the gunsmith.\n22:7 Comment: But he gave it to the fight.\n22:9 Comment: How Mertenz runs!\n22:11 Comment: Fantastic!\n22:13 Comment: Jackerini scores.\n22:15 Comment: Well, Mertenz with his explosive jerk\n22:17 Comment: literally tore apart Jena's defenses.\n22:20 Comment: 2-0.\n22:22 Comment: Dries Mertenz in this match too,\n22:24 Comment: in which the thoughts of the team\n22:26 Comment: clearly focused on the upcoming Champions League,\n22:29 Comment: after all, it sometimes explodes here too\n22:31 Comment: and shows his extraordinary skill.\n22:33 Comment: One of the best players of the season.\n22:35 Comment: Finally!\n22:37 Comment: Finally Dries Mertenz,\n22:39 Comment: for whom I personally have been rooting for several seasons\n22:41 Comment: and always talked about\n22:43 Comment: Why doesn't Napoleon rent it out?\n22:45 Comment: If the coach counts both Matsari and the next Sari\n22:49 Comment: they didn’t consider him a main team player,\n22:51 Comment: but give this talent to another team on loan,\n22:54 Comment: to where he will play at the base,\n22:56 Comment: this person should play in the main lineup,\n22:58 Comment: because his football pleases the fans\n23:0 Comment: It's nice to watch this Belgian play.\n23:2 Comment: Brilliantly!\n23:4 Comment: Jackerini makes it 2-0.\n23:6 Comment: And according to the system, goal plus pass\n23:8 Comment: this is the 20th point scored by the Mertenians\n23:10 Comment: and he is second only to Ikarda.\n23:13 Comment: In my opinion.\n23:17 Comment: In Italy, too, they are happy to consider\n23:19 Comment: game broadcasts.\n23:24 Comment: Well, as for...\n23:27 Comment: Yes, Icardi is in first place in the goal plus pass system.\n23:30 Comment: Mertenz is here too.\n23:32 Comment: Yes, he is third and has 20 points.\n23:37 Comment: He became the second, the second.\n23:39 Comment: Second only to Icardi, he has 23.\n23:43 Comment: Well, now the only question is\n23:45 Comment: will Napoli win big?\n23:47 Comment: Because it’s clear that such a game cannot be saved in Naples.\n23:50 Comment: Naples will not allow two goals to be scored on their own goal\n23:52 Comment: under no circumstances.\n23:54 Comment: But Genua is unlikely to stop playing now.\n23:57 Comment: Still, there are still more than 20 minutes left until the end of the match.\n24:0 Comment: Genua whether he wants or not, he will go forward.\n24:3 Comment: And he will certainly receive a counterattack.\n24:5 Comment: Well, the Gennady club itself can score.\n24:8 Comment: Why not try it?\n24:10 Comment: Still, Napoli’s defense is not ideal.\n24:11 Comment: Serve, here's the moment, for example.\n24:13 Comment: The shot on goal is quite tight.\n24:15 Comment: Nikolai Sobourdis's answer to Pepe Reina.\n24:19 Comment: He'll finish it off, he'll finish it off.\n24:21 Comment: And here is Incinia, right?\n24:24 Comment: Here we must applaud Incinia\n24:26 Comment: for attempting to shoot with a second touch.\n24:28 Comment: This brightened up an absolute episode.\n24:30 Comment: Although perhaps someone will say that it was necessary to slow down.\n24:33 Comment: It is somehow more accurate to complete this attack.\n24:37 Comment: But pay attention to the reception of the ball.\n24:39 Comment: And you saw him when receiving the ball\n24:41 Comment: raised his head and assessed the goalkeeper's position.\n24:43 Comment: In principle, he did everything intelligently.\n24:45 Comment: That's why the episode is beautiful.\n24:47 Comment: But the final blow just didn’t work.\n24:49 Comment: But it was too complicated.\n24:51 Comment: And the probability that the blow will not work,\n24:53 Comment: it was still higher than the probability that\n24:55 Comment: that this will be a blow to the main line.\n24:57 Comment: Back to the same year.\n24:59 Comment: But he is from a more comfortable position in the first half\n25:1 Comment: he launched the ball into the sky twice.\n25:3 Comment: So there's really nothing to complain about here.\n25:5 Comment: Stopped the ball really nicely.\n25:7 Comment: I gained excellent speed.\n25:9 Comment: In general, Incinia, like all of Napoli,\n25:11 Comment: Orban catches the ball here.\n25:13 Comment: 2-0, 2-0 still.\n25:16 Comment: But, of course, Napoli would be happy to\n25:19 Comment: if the opponent allows it,\n25:21 Comment: the ending will be bright.\n25:23 Comment: There is absolutely neither to the village nor to the city\n25:25 Comment: phrase about the fact that 2-0\n25:27 Comment: Fabio Capello's least favorite score.\n25:29 Comment: This is absolutely not about today's game.\n25:31 Comment: No, Napoli is not Italian at all\n25:33 Comment: in this sense a team.\n25:35 Comment: The construction along the lines is excellent\n25:37 Comment: and quite symphonic in itself.\n25:38 Comment: But anyway...\n25:40 Comment: Worry, here in this game\n25:42 Comment: worry about\n25:44 Comment: that the team leading 2-0\n25:46 Comment: and this one was a pass from Fabio Capello,\n25:48 Comment: relax, allow the opponent\n25:50 Comment: score yourself 1-2-1, nerves,\n25:52 Comment: difficult ending and team\n25:54 Comment: adds pressure, compares scores\n25:56 Comment: and you lose points.\n25:58 Comment: This, it seems to me, is a completely different story.\n26:0 Comment: Well, also because Napoli\n26:2 Comment: would rather score a third when the score is 2-1,\n26:4 Comment: if suddenly this happens, yes,\n26:6 Comment: than to allow yourself to fall behind.\n26:8 Comment: How come you don't know\n26:10 Comment: that if necessary I will kill something,\n26:12 Comment: then pay as needed.\n26:14 Comment: Well...\n26:17 Comment: So, anyway.\n26:19 Comment: At accomplishedmountise.pro\n26:21 Comment: We start with penguin mortality\n26:23 Comment: and see what Fabio Capello\n26:25 Comment: disassembled in advance on this Region R5.\n26:27 Comment: Well, she...\n26:29 Comment: She is there, empty it with the camera,\n26:31 Comment: donde la transporte dahuy\n26:33 Comment: transfigured it\n26:35 Comment: from stadium 28\n26:38 Comment: Diawar, of course, has a high-pressure Skeoland.\n26:41 Comment: If Zelinsky is instead of someone, then instead of Zhorzheniy or Maksimovich.\n26:44 Comment: So I say, there is a choice of five people.\n26:46 Comment: The visiting team has now put on very high pressure.\n26:50 Comment: And Napolis failed to escape this pressure.\n26:53 Comment: Hamshek, it’s a tough match for him today.\n26:56 Comment: He needs to somehow, I don’t know, the coach needs to cheer him up and bring him to his senses before the Champions League.\n27:2 Comment: Because Marek and the matches of the Slovak national team at the European Championship, first of all,\n27:7 Comment: showed how great the class of this football player is and what he means for the team he plays for.\n27:12 Comment: Therefore, of course, Napoleon needs the best hamshek in the match against Real Madrid.\n27:17 Comment: Than today, yes.\n27:18 Comment: It was a funny episode; Munoz hit himself in the foot.\n27:21 Comment: Pass into the penalty area, rebound, Loshal throws it back a little.\n27:25 Comment: Well, Diawara is very active here.\n27:28 Comment: Mertens helps him.\n27:30 Comment: And it’s not so easy for Genoese to play the ball in front of someone else’s penalty area.\n27:33 Comment: Loshal lets the ball go and Napoleon can start attacking again.\n27:39 Comment: Orban kicked it out of the sideline.\n27:45 Comment: That's how. It turns out there is still one player.\n27:48 Comment: But this is rather an attacking midfielder than Horvat Markerok.\n27:54 Comment: Also a choice.\n27:56 Comment: And also a very fresh option.\n28:2 Comment: This is a rather unexpected decision by Jaquirina instead of Rowe.\n28:5 Comment: Someone else is not a regular player.\n28:9 Comment: But try to see what condition the footballer is in.\n28:12 Comment: Is he ready at all?\n28:14 Comment: You can count on him in the Champions League.\n28:18 Comment: He plays very little.\n28:20 Comment: Yes, but he came on as a substitute already, and in particular in the previous match.\n28:24 Comment: He appeared with Bolonia in the match with Milan.\n28:28 Comment: Went out.\n28:30 Comment: Slowly, little by little, new talent also needs to be introduced into the team.\n28:41 Comment: We once again enjoyed watching Naples' goal.\n28:44 Comment: With brilliant performances from Mertens and a pass to the empty net to Jaquirina.\n28:52 Comment: With about 20 minutes added until the final whistle.\n28:56 Comment: 2-0 ahead. Fight for the ball in the Naples half of the field.\n28:59 Comment: Kulebali returns the ball to Poperenni.\n29:6 Comment: I wouldn't be surprised if Napoleon ends up keeping a clean sheet today.\n29:9 Comment: Still, in defense, including due to the absence of leading players,\n29:13 Comment: going to the African Cup, there were problems.\n29:17 Comment: That’s how Kulebali returned and began to become more and more active.\n29:25 Comment: The main thing is to interact more and more clearly with Albiol again.\n29:32 Comment: But still, the spirit of Fabio Capellovich will decide.\n29:37 Comment: According to the judges.\n29:40 Comment: This first substitution is more of an equal one than a defensive one.\n29:44 Comment: Now it’s obvious to hold the score, so as not to give any slack in the center of the field.\n29:50 Comment: And don’t leave any chance to your opponent.\n29:52 Comment: Somehow, at least heighten the intrigue at the end, if Jen suddenly manages to score in the next 10 minutes.\n29:58 Comment: In Naples they believe that this is not Italy at all.\n30:1 Comment: In a football sense, there’s still no escape.\n30:4 Comment: Italian education, Italian football philosophy lives on.\n30:9 Comment: And in general he feels good.\n30:11 Comment: Rock receives the ball on the right flank.\n30:13 Comment: First attack.\n30:15 Comment: And it would be necessary to make the transmission stepwise.\n30:17 Comment: How timely.\n30:18 Comment: Alan, Rock. Here are two who came on as replacement players.\n30:21 Comment: What are they doing?\n30:22 Comment: Oh-ho-ho.\n30:23 Comment: No, they didn't score.\n30:25 Comment: Well, it was fun in the penalty area for Jenu.\n30:29 Comment: And now the visiting team is trying to launch an attack.\n30:32 Comment: Giovanni Semyon has a lot of losses.\n30:34 Comment: This time the ball was taken away from him.\n30:36 Comment: Devara makes another accurate pass.\n30:38 Comment: Continues to play there with virtually no errors.\n30:41 Comment: Well, here Zelensky demonstrates dribbling.\n30:43 Comment: Napoli have good ball control.\n30:49 Comment: We took a short break because there was nowhere to go further.\n30:52 Comment: Jena managed to return to her seats.\n30:55 Comment: Napoli is preparing another replacement.\n30:58 Comment: And finally, it looks like Milik number 99 is undressing.\n31:1 Comment: Napoli, Mertens.\n31:3 Comment: He is ready to beat anyone.\n31:5 Comment: And not one at a time, but three, four people at a time.\n31:9 Comment: Clean ball, Rock.\n31:11 Comment: The danger is bad.\n31:13 Comment: Diagolosha with the left flank attack.\n31:15 Comment: This is where the tarant came out.\n31:17 Comment: It is not needed there; it is not in the center.\n31:19 Comment: Strange replacement.\n31:21 Comment: The replacement of the player did not strengthen the team.\n31:23 Comment: The player was completely lost on the field.\n31:25 Comment: And even from his movements it’s clear that he doesn’t really understand\n31:29 Comment: what the coach wanted from him.\n31:31 Comment: What tasks does he have to perform?\n31:33 Comment: How to help your team.\n31:35 Comment: Despite the fact that he is quite technical.\n31:37 Comment: Actually, he doesn't want his coach\n31:40 Comment: Despite the fact that he is quite technical.\n31:42 Comment: Actually, why did they talk so much about him then?\n31:44 Comment: when he appeared in Milan.\n31:46 Comment: Good dribbling, clear head.\n31:48 Comment: But all this manifests itself if you play constantly.\n31:50 Comment: By the way, talking about Mertens.\n31:52 Comment: Mertens could not win the competition.\n31:54 Comment: He was not given the right.\n31:56 Comment: He wasn't given a chance.\n31:58 Comment: A player like Mertens needs 10 matches in a row,\n32:0 Comment: so that he finally understands\n32:2 Comment: he has the right to fine art here.\n32:4 Comment: And now,\n32:6 Comment: he can't win.\n32:8 Comment: And now he has the right to do so.\n32:10 Comment: And he's better.\n32:12 Comment: Now he is receiving applause from the stands.\n32:14 Comment: Great match from Dries Mertens.\n32:16 Comment: It turns out that this is not Milik, but someone else.\n32:18 Comment: Leonardo Pavaletti.\n32:20 Comment: Center forward.\n32:22 Comment: Well, the kind of person who can\n32:24 Comment: and play a little deeper, but today\n32:26 Comment: he appears instead of Mertens, which means he will go forward.\n32:28 Comment: Well, with Erhi Ranosso and company\n32:30 Comment: provides great entertainment.\n32:34 Comment: In a game against this\n32:37 Comment: football player individually.\n32:41 Comment: And of course his passing assist\n32:43 Comment: could be repeated, but since we just\n32:45 Comment: they changed Jokerini, they already showed us,\n32:47 Comment: that's how we remember.\n32:49 Comment: Dries Mertens left 2-0.\n32:53 Comment: Arkady Ushmilik is not ready yet,\n32:55 Comment: judging by the decision\n32:57 Comment: Maurizio Sarri, but let us remind you once again\n32:59 Comment: the Pole has recovered\n33:1 Comment: and in two consecutive matches he is on the bench\n33:3 Comment: stock\n33:5 Comment: Well, Jenova is still counting on something,\n33:7 Comment: but not with such blows.\n33:9 Comment: Tarabt.\n33:11 Comment: This is apparently a reaction to what he himself understands\n33:13 Comment: that I didn’t get into the game even now\n33:15 Comment: completely unjustified and unprepared\n33:17 Comment: strike from a very long distance.\n33:26 Comment: Yes, interesting. Italy is so\n33:28 Comment: diverse in everything. Here today\n33:30 Comment: Georgy and I, for example, visited\n33:32 Comment: exhibition, which takes place in the Yakovskaya Gallery.\n33:35 Comment: It happened.\n33:37 Comment: We saw the masterpieces of the Vatican and\n33:39 Comment: remembered the Renaissance\n33:41 Comment: together with\n33:43 Comment: Moskovsavod.\n33:45 Comment: There is Florence, there is Rome,\n33:47 Comment: there is Venice, three Renaissance periods.\n33:49 Comment: There are today's capitals, these are Milan, Turin.\n33:51 Comment: There is Bolonia, one of the main\n33:53 Comment: European university cities.\n33:55 Comment: Everyone has their own face.\n33:57 Comment: Naples and Genoa are the two main ports\n33:59 Comment: and two completely different cities.\n34:1 Comment: All these cities, absolutely,\n34:3 Comment: everyone has something completely unique\n34:5 Comment: face.

    "summary": "On a blustery evening at the Stadio Diego Armando Maradona, Napoli welcomed Genoa in a Serie A clash full of underlying tension and high stakes. Napoli, under the stewardship of Maurizio Sarri, was eager to secure three points and continue their quest for the Scudetto. Genoa, led by Ivan Juric, were desperate to reverse their fortunes and claw their way up the table after an extended series of winless matches. The game promised drama, suspense, and tactical intrigue.\n\n### **First Half**\n\nAs the match commenced, the Neapolitan faithful roared in anticipation, hoping to see their heroes perform with the finesse and flair that has characterized their season so far. Genoa, on the other hand, faced a tougher challenge, coming into the match eight games without a win. Early observations from the stand indicated that Genoa was not here just to make up the numbers; they were determined and came out with intent.\n\nFrom the first whistle, Genoa demonstrated aggression, attacking from the get-go. Within the opening minute, they almost created a dangerous opportunity, mirroring their vigor from previous matches when they pushed top teams to their limits. The dynamism of Giovanni Simeone, the son of the famed Diego Simeone, was evident as he worked tirelessly to spearhead Genoa's attack.\n\nNapoli’s attempts to seize control were met with resistance. The home side tried exploiting the flanks where their pace and dribbling could pull Genoa’s defensive setup apart. However, Genoa’s defense, marshaled by experienced campaigners like Nicolas Burdisso and Santiago Gentiletti, remained resolute. Midway through the half, Napoli’s invisible man, Dries Mertens, who had been nursing an early knock, began to find his feet, showing glimpses of his lethal precision with a few deft touches and darting runs.\n\nThe Neapolitans carved out their first significant chance when Piotr Zielinski danced past his markers in the middle of the park, producing a sumptuous through ball, only to see the final effort thwarted by Genoa's deep-lying defenders. Zielinski, who had started the match somewhat tentatively, gradually grew into his role, dictating the tempo and orchestrating attacks alongside the experienced Marek Hamšík.\n\nDespite exerting pressure, Napoli's attempts to breach Genoa’s defense were often thwarted by hurried finishes or the visitors’ organized retreat. Genoa, in turn, had their moments – interplay between Simone and Paladino offered flickers of danger, though they struggled to convert possession into tangible chances.\n\nA considerable portion of the first half observed Genoa’s admirable press, limiting Napoli’s passage through the center. Naples found themselves attempting long balls and frequent switches of play, a testament to Genoa’s successful containment strategy. The dynamic shifts of Alan and Diwara in the midfield further highlighted Sarri’s tactical flexibility yet frustrated his intentions of consistent fluidity.\n\nAs time waned in the first half, the murmurs grew with every passing minute, questioning when Napoli's celebrated offensive line would strike. With a smattering of passionate dialogue in the stands and the shifting tension on the pitch, the halftime whistle blew, leaving Napoli and Genoa locked in a goalless stalemate – a 0-0 that belied the underlying tactical chess match played in the opening 45 minutes.\n\n### **Second Half**\n\nResuming after the break, Maurizio Sarri’s charges seemed more resolved. The break had infused a sense of purpose. Genoa, introducing the energetic Danilo Cataldi as a replacement for the injured Miguel Veloso, found themselves immediately on the back foot. Napoli’s newfound aggression was palpable.\n\nWithin minutes of the restart, Napoli’s relentless offensive drive bore fruit. Dries Mertens, finally synchronized with the rhythm of the game, became the catalyst. His dazzling run past several Genoese defenders was a testament to his explosive genius. Mertens' initial effort ricocheted off a forest of legs, but it was Piotr Zielinski who pounced on the loose ball, striking it sweetly into the bottom corner to give Napoli a deserved 1-0 lead.\n\nSeizing the initiative, Napoli kept up the tempo, determined to build on their advantage. Mertens, buoyed by his earlier contribution, became a constant thorn in Genoa’s side. His tireless running and skillful dribbles continuously troubled the Genoa defense. A few minutes later, Mertens produced another mesmerising solo run, dancing around Genoa’s defenders but his final shot narrowly missed the target.\n\nThe urgency of the game escalated as Genoa, now trailing, desperately sought an equalizer. However, Napoli’s defense, having reinforced with the return of Kalidou Koulibaly from the African Cup of Nations, was a tight unit, effectively stifling Genoa’s attempts to counter-attack. Pepe Reina's goal remained unthreatened as Genoa’s offense struggled to break through.\n\nAs the clock ticked down, Sarri made tactical adjustments. His substitutions provided fresh legs and added impetus to Napoli’s attacking endeavors. The introduction of Leonardo Pavoletti offered a new dimension to Napoli's offense. Reflecting the coach's intentions not just to defend the slender lead but to push for more, Napoli flexed their offensive muscles time and again.\n\nBy the 70th minute, Genoa’s defense showed signs of weariness. The constant pressure from Napoli’s frontline proved too much. Dries Mertens, highlighting his impeccable form, executed a blistering pace run on the wing, leaving Genoa’s backline in his wake. His perfectly measured cross found Emanuele Giaccherini, who slotted home emphatically, doubling Napoli’s advantage to 2-0.\n\nThe second goal effectively shattered Genoa's resolve. Napoli, sensing the opportunity, maintained control of the ball with meticulous passing sequences orchestrated by Hamšík and Alan. The control and patience epitomized their game management, ensuring Genoa was consistently kept at arm’s length.\n\nDespite their valiant efforts, Genoa, constrained by earlier forced substitutions, had exhausted their tactical options. The desperation was evident as they resorted to long passes and hurried attacks, often losing possession cheaply. Giovanni Simeone, who had been a beacon of hope in the first half, found himself isolated and ineffective against a well-drilled Napoli defense.\n\nAs the game drew to its inevitable conclusion, the 2-0 scoreline remained steadfast. Napoli’s victory was not just a testament to their attacking prowess but a reflection of their disciplined and strategic approach, hallmark traits of a side aiming for championship glory.\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nIn the end, Napoli triumphed comprehensively, earning a crucial 2-0 victory over Genoa. The win propelled them closer to the summit of Serie A while reaffirming their status as genuine title contenders. Dries Mertens’ performance, along with Zielinski’s and Jaquirini’s contributions, underscored Napoli’s depth and versatility.\n\nFor Genoa, the result added another chapter to their ongoing struggles. Yet, there were moments of promise and determined resolve that hinted at potential rebounds in future fixtures. Their coach, Ivan Juric, despite the mounting pressure, exhibited tactical acumen bolstered by a squad willing to fight until the end.\n\nAs the Neapolitans sang their heroes' praise, their eyes began to look towards an even larger stage – a date with Real Madrid in the Champions League loomed on the horizon, a fixture that would demand the very best of Sarri’s squad. The victory against Genoa was more than just three points; it was a reaffirmation of their potential and a precursor to the battles that lay ahead."
