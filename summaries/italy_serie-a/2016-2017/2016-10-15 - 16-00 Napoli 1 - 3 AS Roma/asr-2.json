    "input": "\n    Napoli 1 - 3 AS\n\nFirst Half:\n\n0:0 Comment: 13th year. And he ranks 4th in Serie B, then 2nd in Serie D. From 4th he played\n0:8 Comment: transitional matches, did not qualify for the series, but got in from 2nd place and most importantly, Empoli is a team,\n0:15 Comment: you know, coaching. Everyone felt this by chance, they even wanted to invite him to Milan,\n0:21 Comment: and to Roma. He was listed, but he was called to Naples. And silver medals right away. That's why\n0:29 Comment: the coach is so fashionable and quite successful. And he started this season well, although Guai also left. All\n0:39 Comment: They were afraid that the start would be unsuccessful. But since there are many in the team, there are simply many in the composition\n0:45 Comment: attacking football players. Well, closer to the game. That’s it, I said this about the coach, now it’s closer to the game.\n0:53 Comment: Azure form. Azzuri is the name of the team. Well, here it is, closer to the fight.\n0:59 Comment: Rdova is Roma. The Azuri are the masters. Who should I give the ball to?\n1:16 Comment: So, Roma. Pass back.\n1:25 Comment: Pirotti.\n1:29 Comment: Alan is Brazilian. Alan is number five. These are midfielders. Jorginho, Hamsik and Alan. These are just midfielders. Three. And three strikers. Calvijon, Gabiadini and Incini. This is the system in attack. Six forwards. Yes, well, four defenders. And the first penalty. Well, attention. It's always dangerous.\n1:58 Comment: Yes, it's dangerous. Lots of homemade stuff. And let's see what happens.\n2:6 Comment: Low pass unsuccessful. And Pirotti sends the ball to the right flank. On Ingalan it picks up speed.\n2:15 Comment: Inaccurate pass. The ball hits the leg. But the second attack pace is underway.\n2:20 Comment: Derosi. Daniel Desrosy. 33 year old.\n2:23 Comment: Derosi.\n2:26 Comment: The last two.\n2:28 Comment: The last two emperors. Yes, these are two great football players.\n2:32 Comment: Roma. The second one is in stock. This is Francesco Totti.\n2:37 Comment: Here is Derosi. They dropped him. 33 years.\n2:47 Comment: Jorginho broke the rules. Well, the show, as always, will be very reliable and accurate.\n2:53 Comment: I mean the work of the emergency team.\n2:58 Comment: So, attack on the left flank.\n3:6 Comment: Hamsik returned the ball.\n3:10 Comment: Allan. It is located in the center. You see, such a central midfielder.\n3:17 Comment: Wall game. Actually, it looks like a free kick. Yes, that is right. We played the game now.\n3:25 Comment: Gabiadin did not play the ball with his left foot.\n3:28 Comment: He also fell. But the other player was in violation.\n3:33 Comment: Well, now attention. Attention. Szczesny.\n3:37 Comment: Szczesny. He's on loan from Arsenal. Polish national team player.\n3:43 Comment: Here, too, it looks like, yes, it happened. But here there was a more serious violation.\n3:47 Comment: Just. I played hockey in the corps now.\n3:54 Comment: Paredes. Number five.\n3:58 Comment: Insigne is on the ball.\n4:7 Comment: And pay attention. Three players at once. Yes, the ball in the wall is also together.\n4:12 Comment: Players on the field to disorient the goals.\n4:16 Comment: You can't see the moment of impact. The goalkeeper might miss. He might miss it.\n4:21 Comment: Now we need to throw the near corner. This is true. Shot from long range.\n4:26 Comment: Usually they hit the neighbor. And this one is the opposite.\n4:28 Comment: Shot from long range. But the distant goalkeeper, in general, is responsible for him.\n4:36 Comment: But still. You see it here. He rushed. We have now seen the goalkeeper.\n4:41 Comment: I went to the right. That is, he did not see the moment of impact.\n4:45 Comment: Hit the ball into the goal. It could have ended in a goal.\n4:49 Comment: Derosi. Pass to the left flank.\n4:52 Comment: Pirotti. Pushes the ball forward. Goes even further.\n4:56 Comment: Innings. And a blow.\n4:58 Comment: By the turn of the day, Jack had managed to get ahead of the game.\n5:2 Comment: It seemed that the defender was two or three meters closer to the ball.\n5:6 Comment: But no. Jumped out. This is a great instinct for a forward to show.\n5:13 Comment: Well, let's give it the epithet cool, right?\n5:18 Comment: Because scoring instinct is a gift from God.\n5:23 Comment: You have to be born with this, footballers.\n5:28 Comment: And it was very interesting.\n5:31 Comment: The defenders play back.\n5:35 Comment: Still, there is such tension.\n5:37 Comment: Well, then, look, the football players split into pairs all over the field.\n5:41 Comment: Moreover, they also attack on the field near someone else’s penalty area.\n5:47 Comment: On the right, Salak was well open.\n5:49 Comment: But the ball didn’t reach him. So now what?\n5:54 Comment: Gamshik. Pass to the right.\n5:56 Comment: Yes, that's the pass.\n5:58 Comment: And the left flank is a bit far away.\n6:0 Comment: Of course, it was a pass for Insigna to head the ball.\n6:3 Comment: But it didn't work out.\n6:5 Comment: Callejon apologizes.\n6:6 Comment: But the attack deserves applause.\n6:8 Comment: Rapid attack development.\n6:10 Comment: Quick transition from defense.\n6:13 Comment: Here Spalletti showed that now only one was free, it seems to me.\n6:17 Comment: Yes, this is his gesture.\n6:21 Comment: Pirotti.\n6:24 Comment: On Ingolan.\n6:28 Comment: Stropman played in the last rounds. He played well for Roma.\n6:33 Comment: And he played well for the Dutch national team.\n6:35 Comment: But his back injury is not even reported today.\n6:38 Comment: That is, the Roma players still have injuries after the national team.\n6:43 Comment: Of course, not the same as the players on the field.\n6:48 Comment: I have already said that Milik, a Pole, a center forward, received a very serious injury in a match for the national team.\n6:54 Comment: Time.\n7:0 Comment: Everyone is still in their own half of the field.\n7:3 Comment: Time.\n7:6 Comment: Pressing.\n7:7 Comment: Very powerful pressure.\n7:9 Comment: Such thorough pressure all over the field.\n7:11 Comment: And a one-touch pass.\n7:13 Comment: Yes, a little softer.\n7:14 Comment: And Jack ran away.\n7:15 Comment: There was no offside.\n7:18 Comment: Reina is there.\n7:22 Comment: Pepe Reina.\n7:24 Comment: Hispanic.\n7:24 Comment: 34 years.\n7:26 Comment: Famous football player.\n7:28 Comment: In the football world, a man.\n7:32 Comment: Many titles in his football career.\n7:35 Comment: But he defends the goal very confidently.\n7:38 Comment: Good pass from Gamshchik.\n7:42 Comment: Insigne passed.\n7:45 Comment: Now the defender didn’t know what to do.\n7:48 Comment: He had two solutions.\n7:50 Comment: Either hit the ball or miss it.\n7:52 Comment: He missed it.\n7:52 Comment: And think about this decision of the defender, Kalyahon.\n7:56 Comment: He could have put his foot down.\n8:0 Comment: Not expected.\n8:6 Comment: Jesus.\n8:9 Comment: Number three.\n8:19 Comment: Yes, Salah is still modest.\n8:23 Comment: Now he has entered the fight.\n8:24 Comment: But he didn’t reach the ball.\n8:26 Comment: Insigne. Hammer.\n8:29 Comment: To the left flank.\n8:33 Comment: Gabiadini.\n8:34 Comment: The transfer was made with him in mind.\n8:36 Comment: Gabiadini scored 15 goals the season before last.\n8:40 Comment: In the past 5.\n8:53 Comment: Gulyan begins attacks on the left flank.\n8:56 Comment: Salah.\n8:56 Comment: Inaccurate pass.\n8:58 Comment: And again, again a wave rolls in, attacking Napoli.\n9:3 Comment: We need to go to the flank somewhere.\n9:6 Comment: And in the end...\n9:9 Comment: But the referee blew the whistle a little earlier.\n9:12 Comment: It was as if Hysai expected the rules to be broken on him.\n9:17 Comment: Okay, it's good now.\n9:18 Comment: Applause.\n9:32 Comment: Only breaking the rules can stop the attack.\n9:36 Comment: Paredas!\n9:37 Comment: Seen for the second time, remember he was shot down by Insigne after\n9:41 Comment: drawing the wall and now...\n9:43 Comment: I think the third such violation will already be a card.\n9:46 Comment: Sonora Force conform biology, license-instzhutuardedyenka,\n9:51 Comment: Valdiceh Atole.\n9:52 Comment: Here he is Francesco Totti on the right on your screens.\n9:54 Comment: Senzny recherche

up.\n10:28 Comment: And here is Hamsik's blow.\n10:32 Comment: Well, it’s no coincidence that they deliberately ran into it a couple of times.\n10:35 Comment: Showing.\n10:36 Comment: But in fact, Gamshik received the ball under attack.\n10:39 Comment: But the blow did not take place.\n10:41 Comment: This is homemade.\n10:53 Comment: What is the density, right?\n10:55 Comment: And here the one-touch game didn’t work out.\n10:58 Comment: But in principle, this kind of pressite can only be hacked with a one-touch game.\n11:2 Comment: That's the right decision.\n11:6 Comment: Two touches will cover everything.\n11:8 Comment: Will close you.\n11:9 Comment: Will block.\n11:15 Comment: Bottom left flank.\n11:16 Comment: Ghulyam again.\n11:17 Comment: Ghoulam.\n11:18 Comment: Goes

Passed this penalty corner.\n27:5 Comment: And the serve is under attack.\n27:7 Comment: Passed to Jack.\n27:9 Comment: The ball didn't go away.\n27:11 Comment: Manages to cover the zone, because both one and the other team.\n27:15 Comment: Notice how compact it is.\n27:18 Comment: Central defenders and midfielders in front of them.\n27:25 Comment: Strongly. Slow down a little.\n27:28 Comment: The horses are a little slower.\n27:30 Comment: It was necessary to hit him in the leg.\n27:35 Comment: I was a little upset.\n27:37 Comment: Mauritso.\n27:38 Comment: Sari. And there was a moment.\n27:39 Comment: And he is waiting for a goal.\n27:40 Comment: He is waiting for a goal because there is an advantage.\n27:42 Comment: Both in ball possession and in initiative in general.\n27:45 Comment: Look how many approaches there were to the opponent's penalty area.\n27:48 Comment: It’s already showing us.\n27:51 Comment: And on target. There are two strikes there.\n27:55 Comment: Roma.\n27:59 Comment: True, I’m not sure whether it was on target or at all.\n28:1 Comment: But we'll see. There will be a lot of statistics.\n28:7 Comment: No, it's a dangerous game.\n28:9 Comment: On inhalan. Played dangerously.\n28:25 Comment: It seems to me that Naples’ flanks can work better.\n28:31 Comment: Preferably for Naples.\n28:34 Comment: Somewhat boring in the center of the field.\n28:37 Comment: By the way, regarding positional attacks and goals scored after them\n28:45 Comment: Naples lead Serie A.\n28:47 Comment: Offside.\n28:53 Comment: And after 13 positional attacks, there were 14 goals scored.\n28:57 Comment: Yes, the offside position in the entrenchment clearly indicated an offside position.\n29:7 Comment: Not contextualized with ak saja, even now.\n29:12 Comment: This one is scored by Aivost.\n29:15 Comment: Notak aural is piled in jars.\n29:17 Comment: In fact, Miril has the present.\n29:19 Comment: Gas Jericho to ktoś cinnamon in the first league,\n29:21 Comment: If Bahrain is with him,'vernoce department square' 가는ku.\n29:24 Comment: Denduほど in the test series n city ringtone to subsidiy.\n29:27 Comment: Budranich.\n29:30 Comment: Yes, probably.\n29:31 Comment: mortal trend星ur of power in the groupios.\n29:33 Comment: Something worth 450 kopecks jarate,\n29:35 Comment: He can create numerical superiority through individual habit.\n29:39 Comment: And here is Gamshik. And again he is free.\n29:42 Comment: Insignia. Pass to Hamshik. Hamshik in the penalty area.\n29:46 Comment: Turned around.\n29:48 Comment: The combination is similar to the one that was at the European Championships in France,\n29:53 Comment: when Hamshik scored for the Russian national team.\n29:57 Comment: Remember. Here, at this place, he received the ball and launched it into the far field.\n30:2 Comment: He's doing the same thing now.\n30:4 Comment: We have a defender here in time. And again this compactness.\n30:8 Comment: Safety net, right? What was the safety net?\n30:12 Comment: The defender blocked this shot.\n30:16 Comment: Angular. Gabiadini in the spotlight.\n30:22 Comment: And a long-range strike.

Yes, now there is space. You can counterattack.\n31:3 Comment: Herself.\n31:4 Comment: Allah walks in the center. Looks where Dzeko is.\n31:6 Comment: Under Jacko. Output 1 on 1.\n31:8 Comment: Bravo!\n31:10 Comment: Bravo, Pepe Reina!\n31:14 Comment: Tightly. He jumped head first, without fear.\n31:18 Comment: Look. There is no offside.\n31:20 Comment: And what an accurate pass. Yes, but still there is a goalkeeper here.\n31:24 Comment: Outplayed.\n31:26 Comment: The goalkeeper beat him.\n31:28 Comment: And Jacko, of course.\n31:34 Comment: He probably hit me with his left foot.\n31:36 Comment: You can't see him here.\n31:40 Comment: But he winces in pain.\n31:42 Comment: But Dzeko is great.\n31:44 Comment: He removed his feet. He removed his right leg so as not to hit the goalkeeper.\n31:46 Comment: He removed his right leg so as not to hit the goalkeeper.\n31:50 Comment: Well, you've already heard about the green card.\n31:54 Comment: That's how the journalists titled it.\n31:56 Comment: In fact, this is an entry in the protocol.\n31:58 Comment: In series B.\n32:0 Comment: This is the second episode.\n32:2 Comment: In series B.\n32:4 Comment: After the match, when the footballer admitted that the ball did not touch him and that there should not be a corner kick, but a goal kick.\n32:14 Comment: And the judge made this entry.\n32:18 Comment: Like an experiment.\n32:20 Comment: This is fair play.\n32:22 Comment: And then encourage.\n32:24 Comment: I just don’t understand why some, even my colleagues, think that these conversations are not necessary at all.\n32:32 Comment: And fire analice.\n32:34 Comment: No, they are needed.\n32:36 Comment: Because after all, we need to collect these examples of noble itsub Poсаterial errığını.\n32:38 Comment: Because after all, we need to collect these examples of noble Bengals\n32:58 Comment: Callejon did not strike. Hamshik picked up the ball. There is no offside, of course.\n33:4 Comment: Here there was already a shot along the goal.\n33:10 Comment: But he has time, Paredas has time now.\n33:15 Comment: Hit the ball 5-0.\n33:18 Comment: Callejon will serve.\n33:20 Comment: 34th minute.\n33:30 Comment: First time. 0-0.\n33:38 Comment: Spins the ball. This is the keeper in place.\n33:42 Comment: Puppy. With a height of 196 centimeters.\n33:47 Comment: It was a good idea, but...\n33:50 Comment: Salah fled. The ball didn't reach him.\n33:56 Comment: Allan.\n33:58 Comment: Zabetin Allan, right? As a defensive central midfielder.\n34:3 Comment: Shot on goal. Near corner. The ball was flying into the goal.\n34:7 Comment: Shchensvenny managed to react. Applause.\n34:10 Comment: First of all, for the blow. Well, the jackkeeper also has a portion.\n34:14 Comment: Again.

No, he doesn't have time.\n34:47 Comment: But there was an attempt.\n34:50 Comment: The Egyptian footballer is very fast.\n34:52 Comment: Works especially well with the ball.\n34:54 Comment: And it works quickly. And he can run away.\n34:56 Comment: He needs to use it.\n35:4 Comment: 36th minute.\n35:6 Comment: But, as the players themselves admit,\n35:9 Comment: when there is such an audience, when the stands are full,\n35:12 Comment: This is a great opportunity to express yourself.\n35:15 Comment: That is a pleasure to play.\n35:17 Comment: Both teams.\n35:20 Comment: And this is very important.\n35:26 Comment: Kulebali played with his chest.\n35:34 Comment: Offsite.\n35:42 Comment: Yes.\n35:43 Comment: Usually the heroes show episodes.\n35:46 Comment: And all the time we are intrusively shown Gabiadini.\n35:50 Comment: The director seems to force him to act more actively with this show.\n35:56 Comment: Do something like that in the gate area.\n36:1 Comment: Salah played along so well. Now I played sideways.\n36:5 Comment: This is a transfer. There was even a shot on goal.\n36:9 Comment: But it was an unsuccessful transfer.\n36:13 Comment: Florence, of course, made the pass with Dzeko in mind.\n36:18 Comment: And again Gamshin.\n36:20 Comment: He's with the ball again.\n36:25 Comment: Insigne. Gamshin.\n36:30 Comment: Insigne.\n36:34 Comment: Well, there, yes, half a meter was not enough for Insigna to pick up the ball.\n36:43 Comment: Roma as a fighter.\n36:45 Comment: And he loses in the tournament by only 1 point.\n36:50 Comment: Something so amazing, Roma's overwhelming advantage in midfield.\n36:57 Comment: And even on the approaches to the opponent’s penalty area.\n37:2 Comment: Gamshin. Insigne. Gamshin.\n37:6 Comment: And how to crack Roma's defense.\n37:8 Comment: What an accurate pass. Insigne.\n37:12 Comment: Gabiadini.\n37:14 Comment: Allan.\n37:16 Comment: No, I passed behind my back, but it was too far.\n37:20 Comment: Scope of work.\n37:21 Comment: Please note, this is the first half.\n37:24 Comment: 38 minutes. Will you have enough strength for the second one?\n37:27 Comment: Also run.\n37:39 Comment: Chenshny.\n37:44 Comment: Perotti. The ball is in the field.\n37:47 Comment: Okay, with the angle now.\n37:49 Comment: Like this.\n37:50 Comment: Some kind of defensive midfielder.\n37:53 Comment: Tenacious and tough.\n37:54 Comment: And everything is within the rules.\n37:59 Comment: Insigne.\n38:1 Comment: Gabiadini. That is if he gets a pass.\n38:4 Comment: Well, thanked the center forward now.\n38:8 Comment: He already moves around a lot.\n38:10 Comment: Short jerks left and right.\n38:11 Comment: But the ball hasn't reached him yet.\n38:14 Comment: But still waiting.\n38:16 Comment: To Ingalan.\n38:18 Comment: Slowed down.\n38:20 Comment: All the players had already run behind the ball line.\n38:24 Comment: On the field.\n38:26 Comment: To Ingalan.\n38:27 Comment: But like a one-touch pass, something sharp is immediately created.\n38:31 Comment: Like Perotti.\n38:33 Comment: He couldn't stand on his feet and broke the rule.\n38:36 Comment: But he broke it. Certainly.\n38:45 Comment: 39 minutes.\n38:50 Comment: Doesn't let me near the gate.\n38:52 Comment: El Sharawi.\n38:54 Comment: He is one of the attacking players in the middle reserve diamonds.\n39:1 Comment: You see, the director makes it clear to us that...\n39:5 Comment: Who is Robin counting on, right?\n39:9 Comment: To get away from this game.\n39:12 Comment: He just fights back.\n39:15 Comment: Release a striker, a creative player.\n39:20 Comment: Maksimovich.\n39:28 Comment: Try to die, build a threshold.\n39:31 Comment: He also worked in the first run, when Roma was the bronze medalist.\n39:36 Comment: When the team was also different.\n39:38 Comment: And just good defense.\n39:43 Comment: Penalty.\n39:48 Comment: Look, unlike...\n39:50 Comment: There are well-known football players whom we often see on television.\n39:55 Comment: Salah did not try to prove to the judge that he was guilty.\n39:59 Comment: That the judge is wrong.\n40:1 Comment: And he just smiled.\n40:3 Comment: He showed it, oh, so smoothly.\n40:6 Comment: Therefore there is no appeal.\n40:12 Comment: Alan.\n40:16 Comment: Him again.\n40:20 Comment: Killed.\n40:24 Comment: The

with Chelsea in the late 90s\n46:24 Comment: and kroll is the second person to receive a personalized t-shirt today\n46:29 Comment: these are Naples veterans\n46:34 Comment: in the meantime, whistle\n46:36 Comment: well what's the result\n46:37 Comment: well, we can say that some are unlucky, others are lucky\n46:42 Comment: it's actually a skill\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Second number El-Seif Hysai, 31 Fauzi Gulyan, 19 Nikola Maksimovic, 26 Kalidou Kulebaly, 5 Marques Alla, 8 Jorginho with the ball to Engala.\n0:16 Comment: Attempt to shoot with a turn. 17 Marik Hamsik, 23 Manolo Gabiadini, 7 Jose Calijon, 24 Lorenzo Isigne. And head coach Maurizo Sarri.\n0:34 Comment: It was on Engal, it was Dzeko's pass. Konchovki kept the ball on Engal instantly with one touch to the left flank. Here is Perotti, Perotti back.\n0:46 Comment: Manolo Gabiadini, Fazio, Manolo.\n1:26 Comment: Roma in the squad. Wojciech Szczesny in goal. 3 Joan Jesus, 44 Kostas Manolos, 20 Federico Fazio, 24 Alexandro Florenzo, 16 Daniele de Rossi, 11 Mohamed Sallah, 5 Leandro Paredes, 4 Rajan Aengalan, 8 Diego Perotti, 9 Edin Jacko.\n1:50 Comment: Here is Dzeko with the ball. Kulebali is now lying under the ball. And head coach Luciano Spalletti. There is no offside on Engalan. Long, what a clever girl. How accurately he made the pass. There were 4 defenders on the field and he still made an accurate pass. \n2:18 Comment: Rossi. De Rossi. Sallah. They were scratching the ball now, one after another.\n2:45 Comment: A pass to the right flank. To Engalan. Look, all his actions, what we see, are all with a plus sign. That is, if he goes to the ball, then he wins it. Hamshik.\n3:1 Comment: Massinha ran behind the defender. De Rossi was slightly ahead. And Hamsik couldn’t have come up with a better idea. He made a pass, and it turned out to be a defender, an opponent.\n3:16 Comment: Spalletti, right? It seems to me that he is even pale. He is so worried. Sallah is mistaken. Ensigna. Collejon is open. No, he does not give it to Collejon. Ensigna. There is nothing, no to Jack. And here is a quick counter-play.\n3:44 Comment: To the right flank. To Sallah. Yes, an accurate pass. Well, we must try to win. Leave. Of course, leave. Well, there was an attempt. I lost this fight now, but Coulibaly figured it all out. But in order to leave, you still have to some kind of deceptive movement. He just pushed the ball forward and ran.\n4:6 Comment: But you have to take risks. One on one. There is no one further behind this defender. Only the goal. Peper. To whom? Pretty accurate. Collejon. Yellow card. Number three. Jesus. Paredes. Yellow card and Jesus.\n4:34 Comment: The Romans got two yellow cards. The body was still set up. Yes, you see, the movement of the leg took it back. The hip was set up. But what if, by inertia, a football player runs towards a defender? Don’t move. Stand like a pillar. Here It's like you have to stand there and not move.\n4:58 Comment: Collejon missed the ball. Didn't reach it. Pirotti. Maksimovich. Allan. No play. No. Pass along the goal. I don't understand now where to position Gabiadze.\n5:28 Comment: The leg plays back. Florence returns the ball to the goalkeeper. Facio. Derosi. Florence. You see, he gave the goalkeepers, the ball came to him. He again passes back to Derosi. But here it is clearly on hold.\n5:58 Comment: Both the score and the tempo. Beat up the pace of the hosts. Disturb them with such passes. Well, it’s possible away from home. But, of course, such a game is not very interesting. It’s not very entertaining.\n6:28 Comment: Kolubali. The gambler. Well, as the gambler receives the ball right away, the picture is revealed. The field. He can give it exactly to his own. That’s right. Bensigni.\n6:53 Comment: There was a pass in the middle. Allan took the ball very carefully. You see, you can hit it. It was a strong shot.\n7:16 Comment: Gulyan shot. Jack played well right away. It’s very important to get away right away. There was a free kick. There was contact. It was a big shot.\n7:32 Comment: Kolubali. Broke the rules.\n7:42 Comment: I even hit my leg here.\n7:54 Comment: Here he is Mertens. He's warming up. It's time, it seems to me, to go out. And they wrote something on Mertens' yellow card. Somehow I missed the moment. Well, we'll figure it out now.\n8:18 Comment: Well, in the meantime, Roma has a chance. Free kick. Serve. Shot and goal. To Jack. You know, now, probably, this is a played combination after all. Fazio jumped high in front of Jack. And 2-0. 2-0 leads Roma.\n8:43 Comment: 2-0. Yes. Seventh goal. No play. Here's the first one. That's why I say fake. The first one jumps up. This is Fazio, number 20. And, as it were, he covers everything behind him with him. And there the ball is waiting Jack.\n9:13 Comment: Well, Dzheku plays impeccably. Vasilyevets is great. He scored two goals. Wow. Well, at this moment, that means Roma has 16 points, and Naples have 14 left. And Roma will take second place. But Milan has 13, Kiev has 13, Latsev has 13. Interesting.\n9:44 Comment: Won't it work out or not? Gabiani has now grabbed his head. Didn't he grab it, but grabbed it. The fact that the ball touched his foot, but he couldn't shoot through. Salah doesn't have time. Yes, Roma will be difficult to stop with such a defensive game. Tsepka We need to break through this defense. Who?\n10:6 Comment: Here is the absence of Milik, who is injured. Everything affects. But by chance, yes, in response to phrases, the coaches say, as Maurinin says, I have Rooney, he says, healthy. And as for the national team, these are not my problems. Of course, there are involuntary competitions between clubs and the national team . And there's no escape.\n10:33 Comment: If you leave with the national team, you get injured. For the club, this is a blow to everything and, most importantly, to the economy. But such is life. Not an Italian phrase, but it fits in this story.\n10:49 Comment: And so the Belgian Dries Mertens comes out. Who does he replace? So he earned this free kick. Oh, yes, Mertens, shouted something to the referee. That's why he got it.\n11:8 Comment: You can’t teach a referee at all. This is not allowed by any rules. And the referee is right. The beef is gone. Gone. But now here’s an interesting formation. Who will be in the center? Bensigne or Mertens? It didn’t work out.\n11:29 Comment: But a lot was needed today. We expected from beef. But what can you do. This is football of the highest level. 57th minute. Naples loses 0-2. And that’s the tradition.\n11:47 Comment: Remember the last six matches? Whoever scores first in the first half wins. In the games between Naples and Roma. Once it was 0-0 in December last year. Maksimovic. Hysaj. Corner.\n12:13 Comment: Attempt by the defender. Mert did not pass it back. But he earns a corner. He could have taken it. Who will be there? Collejon went? Naengalan after an injury. I wonder if he will be enough for the whole match?\n12:28 Comment: Maurizo Sarli prepared Empoli so well, as well as, by the way, Napoleon now. It was in the end. The team is fresher than the rest. Let's see if it works today. Serve! And an own goal.\n12:50 Comment: Own goal. Tradition is broken. Mertens just came out and the ball goes into the goal. That's fortuitous, then. So, lucky. Let's see. It seemed to me that it was an own goal from a defender. No, no. A brilliant goal.\n13:6 Comment: And you know, the one who was guilty scored it. Number 26. What a beautiful shot. Kulebali. Remember, he brought that first ball into his own goal. He started up. And Dzeko jumped out from behind. And he definitely called the ball where it hit.\n13:29 Comment: Beautiful goal. 1-2. Oh, now it's the second half. So, Napoleon loses 1-2. You hear this crowd of 40 thousand now. Here they are, Italian typhoid fever. You will hear them, feel them.\n13:52 Comment: In general, the fans in Naples are always very passionate. I happened to be at a match in Naples when Maradonna played for Naples. It was the heyday of Naples. Now there is an attack, passing along the goal. But no one played ahead of Rotaru.\n14:11 Comment: But it was something. It was such a celebration of football. And Maradona was amazing. Amazing. Under him, Naples won the championship, won the UEFA cup. How he played. The heyday of Maradona. This is after 1986. After they became champions.

    "summary": "On an exciting matchday for Italian Serie A, Napoli hosted AS Roma in a game filled with high expectations and palpable tension. The match took place under clear skies, where both teams entered the field with their respective objectives. Napoli was determined to assert dominance at their home ground, while Roma aimed to climb higher up the league table. The game witnessed a flurry of strategic plays, dynamic attacks, and moments of brilliance, ultimately resulting in a 3-1 victory for the visiting Roma side.\n\nFrom the first whistle, Napoli, clad in their traditional azure uniforms, seemed poised to take control. However, it was Roma that began with more composure. As the clock ticked, the first significant detail noted was the strategic positioning and formations adopted by both teams. Napoli deployed a robust 4-3-3 formation highlighting their attacking potential, with players like Jorginho, Hamsik, and Allan in the midfield and a forward line comprising Callejon, Gabiadini, and Insigne.\n\nThe opening ten minutes were marked by cautious play. Napoli's midfield trio of Allan, Jorginho, and Hamsik showed great synergy, retaining possession and attempting to break down Roma’s defenses. Roma, however, quickly gained footing as Daniel De Rossi orchestrated from the midfield, and the combined efforts of players like Edin Dzeko and Mohamed Salah posed continual threats on Napoli’s defensive line.\n\nOne of the first critical moments came from a beautifully orchestrated counter-attack by Mohamed Salah, supported adeptly by Radja Nainggolan. Salah's move down the right flank marked the beginning of Roma’s tactical sharpness that would feature prominently throughout the match. Despite an impressive back-and-forth, the Napoli defenders, including Kalidou Koulibaly and Nikola Maksimovic, managed to neutralize early threats.\n\nBy the 13th minute, Napoli's coach Maurizio Sarri’s strategies began to materialize as Napoli shifted into a more aggressive gear. Insigne, ever the playmaker, made several attempts down the left flank, often combining with Hamsik to dismantle Roma’s flank defenses. Nevertheless, Roma goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny remained unfazed, showcasing his agility and command by positioning himself ideally to thwart any incoming threats.\n\nAs the half progressed, Napoli’s dominance in terms of ball possession became more evident. Their continuous pressing and intricate passing - a hallmark of Sarri’s philosophy - forced Roma into a more defensive posture. Yet, despite the home team’s impressive control and attacking intent, Roma capitalized on a critical opportunity in the 43rd minute. Radja Nainggolan’s brilliant play, characterized by his clever positioning and sharp passing, allowed him to find Edin Dzeko, who showcased his clinical finishing skills. He outmaneuvered Napoli’s defenders and slotted the ball past Pepe Reina, resulting in the first goal of the match, thereby giving Roma a significant psychological advantage right before halftime.\n\nThe second half resumed with Napoli's determination evident as they strove to overturn the deficit. Sarri's tactical adjustments saw Dries Mertens being introduced, further enhancing Napoli’s attacking prowess. However, Roma's defense, bolstered by players like Kostas Manolos and Federico Fazio, stood resolute. Early minutes in the second half saw attempts by both sides to assert dominance, but it was Roma who once again found the net in the 57th minute. A well-timed header from Dzeko off a corner doubled the scoreline, displaying a textbook example of set-piece execution.\n\nNapoli’s response was immediate and fierce. Not long after conceding the second goal, Napoli launched a series of attacks that culminated in a successful strike. Koulibaly redeemed himself by scoring what appeared initially to be an own goal but upon review, was credited rightly as his. The goal brought life to the stands, and the crowd roared back into support, chanting fervently for an equalizer.\n\nThe momentum shifted as Napoli intensified their efforts, with relentless pressure applied on Roma’s half. Allan, particularly, showed resilience and skill, contributing both offensively and defensively. Napoli’s fluidity in transition was commendable, yet they struggled to convert multiple chances into goals due to Roma’s disciplined backline and Szczesny’s vigilance.\n\nAs tensions rose and the clock ticked down, the game witnessed several physical confrontations and substitutions. Roma’s tactical substitutions maintained their defensive edge while adding fresh legs crucial for maintaining their lead. By the 85th minute, Roma’s Mohammed Salah capitalized on another counter-attack, darting through Napoli's defense before coolly finishing past Reina. The third goal essentially sealed Roma’s victory, showcasing their efficiency on the break and clinical finishing.\n\nThe final segments of the match saw Napoli throwing everything into their attempts to salvage the game. Mertens, Insigne, and Hamsik displayed commendable skill and determination, orchestrating numerous attacks and testing Roma’s defenses yet again. Notwithstanding their effort, Roma's defensive unit remained impervious. The resilience demonstrated by Roma, coupled with their strategic execution of counter-attacks, enabled them to hold onto their lead till the final whistle.\n\nRoma’s victory was a testament to their tactical discipline, individual brilliance, particularly from key players like Dzeko and Salah, and their ability to capitalize on counter-attacks effectively. Napoli, despite their superior possession and multiple goal-scoring opportunities, fell short due to resilience and tactical mastery by Roma.\n\nConclusively, the match served as a powerful reminder of the unpredictable nature of football and the strategic depth that the Italian Serie A brings to the fore. While Napoli’s challenge was commendable and filled with moments of high-quality football, it was Roma’s day, nudging them closer to their objectives in the league. The game encapsulated the essence of Italian football - tactical astuteness, defensive robustness, and flashes of individual brilliance, resonating well with the spectators who witnessed a thrilling encounter."
