right idea\n2:37 Comment: Fernandes back into the starting line up alongside Aquilani in the middle\n2:40 Comment: Aquilani has been frozen out basically for the second half of the season but\n2:48

back on Salah for a moment Mike Hall is going to get the ball back to the line up\n3:54 Comment: all the way round into the box Salah yeah Lega Serie A giving Piero one goal\n4:0 Comment: less than

metres inside their own half.\n6:54 Comment: And it was Fiorentina who went to ground.\n6:58 Comment: Just recently, Allegri also saying that\n7:1 Comment: they need to find more goals from their strikers.\n7:4 Comment: Not many goals have been scored\n7:6 Comment: from the men up front for the Bianconeri.\n7:10 Comment: Just one goal in five games.\n7:15 Comment: You certainly can't put Tevez into that category.\n7:19 Comment: Over 42% of Juventus' goals\n7:21 Comment: either were scored or set up by Tevez.\n7:24 Comment: They're also having a dig at the secondary strikers.\n7:27 Comment: Yeah, absolutely.\n7:29 Comment: Fiorentina on the 5th of February\n7:30 Comment: was his last against Atalanta.\n7:33 Comment: Morata, who's on the bench,\n7:34 Comment: 14th of March,\n7:36 Comment:

Alonso\n10:10 Comment: Alonso who has found his way back into the starting lineup after spending a few\n10:17 Comment: months on the bench started strongly then once Montella moved to a 4-3-3\n10:24 Comment: found himself out of the side tends to play when they revert to that five-man\n10:29 Comment: midfield\n10:34 Comment: here's Evra\n10:39 Comment: 10 minutes on the clock it's a\n10:40

in\n11:39 Comment: wordt a ...\n11:39 Comment: and we'll keep you updated on what's happening\n11:42 Comment: in Rome with Lazio and Palmer at half-time.\n11:50 Comment: Marchisio.\n11:52 Comment: And it didn't find Sturano, who was making the run.\n11:56 Comment: Neto easily enough now throws it out to Alonso.\n12:1 Comment: Now, certainly Fiorentina are taking the game to Juventus.\n12:4 Comment: Looking at their position in the league table,\n12:6 Comment: they need to because they need to rack up some points.\n12:8 Comment: They can't rely on winning the Europa League\n12:11 Comment: to be sure to qualify for Europe,\n12:14 Comment: which would mean the Champions League next season.\n12:17 Comment: Yeah, the winners, of course, go through.\n12:19 Comment: Automatically, anyway, get a place in either the qualifiers\n12:22 Comment: or the actual competition itself as of this season.\n12:28 Comment: And Pirlo, having a few too many risks inside the box,\n12:32 Comment: is eventually dispossessed and wins a free kick.\n12:36 Comment: There was a plaintive look at the referee.\n12:38 Comment: Hope.\n12:38 Comment: Hopeful that he would be awarded something here.\n12:48 Comment: That's a free kick just outside the deep.\n12:52 Comment: But yes, Fiorentina currently holding that sixth place in the table,\n12:56 Comment: which is the last European slot.\n12:59 Comment: So it's very tight down there.\n13:1 Comment: And played forward, Llorente doesn't have the pace, though,\n13:3 Comment: to get on the end of that.\n13:4 Comment: Neto's short ball, though.\n13:6 Comment: And Llorente can't take it.\n13:8 Comment: He can't take it beyond Alonso.\n13:10 Comment: Neto getting a bit confused as to who are his teammates.\n13:13 Comment: Apparently he's already decided, opted for Juventus for next season.\n13:21 Comment: Well, early reports certainly had him on his way to Juve.\n13:24 Comment: We haven't heard too much of late, though.\n13:27 Comment: He hasn't signed a new contract with Fiorentina.\n13:29 Comment: That's the one thing we know for sure.\n13:32 Comment: Now, Storaro trying to play it through to Marquise,\n13:35 Comment: but it was too tight an angle.\n13:37 Comment: Now Barzagli opens it up to Licksteiner.\n13:41 Comment: So combating Neto, the Italian press,\n13:43 Comment: taking for granted that he will be joining Juventus.\n13:47 Comment: Then, however, how is it going to work out?\n13:49 Comment: Because Buffon has been saying it loud and clear\n13:52 Comment: that he's playing until he's 40 and over as number one choice.\n13:57 Comment: And Neto obviously won't be too pleased with that.\n14:0 Comment: Well, you can't really see Buffon sitting on the bench\n14:3 Comment: if he's fit and available.\n14:6 Comment: Well, I think...\n14:7 Comment: Buffon will almost certainly be number one choice next season.\n14:12 Comment: I think Juve will allow him to be\n14:14 Comment: as long as Buffon decides he wants to play.\n14:18 Comment: And so will Neto accept a move to Juventus\n14:20 Comment: only to be shifted on to another team\n14:22 Comment: and a weaker team than Fiorentina?\n14:25 Comment: Seems unlikely.\n14:27 Comment: It does.\n14:29 Comment: Marquise's ball into space, but no-one making the run.\n14:33 Comment: It's a bit of a lethargic start by Juve.\n14:36 Comment: Right now, Marquise.\n14:37 Comment: Marquise.\n14:37 Comment: Winning it back.\n14:39 Comment: Squares it to Sturaro.\n14:41 Comment: Well, it had sat up beautifully for him.\n14:44 Comment: I think that's gone out of play.\n14:47 Comment: It has indeed for a corner kick.\n14:50 Comment: So, the match official over in this touchline\n14:52 Comment: hadn't reached the byline in time to check,\n14:55 Comment: so it must have been the goalkeeping referee\n14:58 Comment: who noticed that the ball had gone over.\n15:0 Comment: Well, I think from our position,\n15:2 Comment: it seemed as if it had gone over the line.\n15:5 Comment: Pirlo from the corner flag.\n15:7 Comment: Once again, then, the big men from the back coming up.\n15:9 Comment: Chiellini in particular.\n15:12 Comment: And though it's squared to Marquise,\n15:14 Comment: lines up the shot.\n15:15 Comment: Might have struck one of the Juve players.\n15:17 Comment: The flag's up anyway.\n15:18 Comment: We're offside.\n15:20 Comment: Yeah, we're all a little bit offside, I think.\n15:22 Comment: Clustered in the middle of the box.\n15:25 Comment: Referee Banti whistling.\n15:33 Comment: Juve, who have found the back of the net\n15:35 Comment: in each of their last 28 home runs.\n15:37 Comment: Four meetings against Fiorentina in the league.\n15:42 Comment: They're looking for win number 50 this evening.\n15:48 Comment: Overall in Turin.\n15:51 Comment: Nick Steiner.\n15:54 Comment: Marchisio.\n15:55 Comment: Working hard, as always, in the middle of the park.\n16:0 Comment: Pirlo now across to Chiellini.\n16:2 Comment: He has space to come forward.\n16:5 Comment: Flipped on by Pereira.\n16:6 Comment: Now, these are the kind of players\n16:7 Comment: balls that Llorente needs to bring down and hold on to.\n16:12 Comment: Yeah, but the Spaniard was already looking up.\n16:13 Comment: He could have flicked the ball on.\n16:15 Comment: He thought Lee Steiner or Marquise should have been driving over the overlap.\n16:18 Comment: But he saw there was nobody coming, but he still flipped the ball on.\n16:22 Comment: There's a player who, under Max Allegri, has found they're going very tough indeed.\n16:26 Comment: His first season last year under Conte went well.\n16:31 Comment: Now Pereira talks about him being sold on, in fact.\n16:39 Comment: Llorente at the end of the season, as he would bring in some cash,\n16:46 Comment: considering he also came on a free transfer.\n16:49 Comment: Now Salah setting off on one of his Maisie runs.\n16:52 Comment: Now opens it up nicely to Joaquin.\n16:55 Comment: It was just too far, though.\n16:56 Comment: And some mistakes creeping in at both ends of the pitch.\n17:1 Comment: And now it's a free transfer.\n17:5 Comment: Well, I can tell you, Valencia already have a 3-0 lead against Parma.\n17:13 Comment: So at this stage, it seems unlikely that the title will be won here this evening.\n17:23 Comment: For those of you who may not know, of course, Juve have a 14-point lead,\n17:27 Comment: or did have anyway coming into this round of fixtures at the top of the table.\n17:34 Comment: And the way Lazio are playing, Max Allegri, the post-match press conference after the derby defeat,\n17:39 Comment: said we've actually gained two points on Lazio.\n17:42 Comment: And they didn't get their full points, they only got a point.\n17:45 Comment: And he was quite right, because they're already three goals up against Parma.\n17:51 Comment: Well, you've got to think, with such a lead, it's a matter of time, really,\n17:55 Comment: considering that six games left coming into this round 33.\n18:0 Comment: And as you already mentioned, it's a matter of time, really, considering that six games left coming into this round 33.\n18:2 Comment: And he wants to wrap up the title so his team can concentrate purely on the Champions League.\n18:6 Comment: They've gone one round better than what the club's demands were.\n18:11 Comment: That was the quarter-finals.\n18:13 Comment: If they can reach the final, it would be an amazing opening season for Allegri.\n18:18 Comment: Would be sensational.\n18:22 Comment: Now, Pirlo, that's a right idea, but Licksteiner had to stay onside.\n18:31 Comment: Marquezio with the throw.\n18:33 Comment: He's going to leave it for Licksteiner.\n18:35 Comment: Comes back into position.\n18:41 Comment: Barzali.\n18:47 Comment: Evra.\n18:48 Comment: Back inside to Chiellini.\n18:51 Comment: Comes back round to Barzali whose control isn't great but he goes past Maty Fernandes.\n18:56 Comment: Now Llorente inside the box doing what he does best.\n18:59 Comment: And then's Gios sleep.\n19:0 Comment: Great assist by Berzali.\n19:0 Comment: And then's Gios sleep.\n19:1 Comment: Great assist by Berzali.\n19:1 Comment: And then's Gios sleep.\n19:1 Comment: And then's Lio call.\n19:1 Comment: get a decent shot away it's the first real chance though coming on 20 minutes of play\n19:8 Comment: we are into using his body great strength by your end was he being held or gonzalo rodriguez\n19:15 Comment: was complaining he was being held by the spaniard still tested nato and the ball was spilled and was\n19:22 Comment: free inside the box for a couple of seconds you've enters they're not playing with the pace they've\n19:27 Comment: come to become

when he came running in for this chance difficult to say here\n20:33 Comment: well i don't think there was too much in that\n20:38 Comment: now allegory is talking to his number two so i think tevez\n20:42 Comment: they're still testing that knee he jarred his knees somehow\n20:46 Comment: davis is not looking too happy in the center circle still looking over at his coach\n20:51 Comment: certainly that is a player you do not want to lose especially\n20:57 Comment: as the team sort of talked about there's no good call\n21:0 Comment: yet and this is a player that gives you the opportunity to\n21:2 Comment: still back to you you won't be found in the second half\n21:3 Comment: and it's not until he plays a few good years of delivering\n21:5 Comment: that he'll beلي out the third point\n21:7 Comment: if evan has an investigations so far\n21:11 Comment: butttes lord i can't remember of course but\n21:14 Comment: song so far\n21:18 Comment: but it is um\n21:19 Comment: so

Comment: pass forward too hard either\n21:36 Comment: at the moment.\n21:41 Comment: Here's Chiellini.\n21:43 Comment: Looking for\n21:44 Comment: Llorente.

Comment: distance for that matter.\n23:52 Comment: It was close.\n23:53 Comment: But even Buffon was off his mind.\n23:55 Comment: He had it covered.\n23:57 Comment: In a neuer kind of way.\n24:3

well.\n25:18 Comment: It has, but the referee had his back turned\n25:21 Comment: as he was having a chat with Gigi Buffon in goal.\n25:25 Comment: It's going to be retaken.\n25:37 Comment: Antti Fernandes from the corner flag\n25:39 Comment: whips one in to the box.\n25:41 Comment: Headed out by Llorente on the edge\n25:44 Comment: and well, way, way, way over the top from Mare.\n25:52 Comment: It was the earlier incident.\n25:54 Comment: The free kick was taken.\n25:55 Comment: Taken by Lichsteiner, Marc Alonso wasn't back the full distance\n25:58 Comment: and that's what Juventus were complaining about.\n26:4 Comment: Referee Antti and Gigi Buffon finish in the chat now.\n26:8 Comment: Obviously, he had to clear something up.\n26:11 Comment: Buffon plays the ball short to Pirlo.\n26:15 Comment: Paredes got acres of space here.\n26:17 Comment: Goes between two to Tevez.\n26:20 Comment: Here is Tevez.\n26:20 Comment: Tevez.\n26:24 Comment: No free kick.\n26:25 Comment: He kicks as the ref.\n26:26 Comment: Juve had the ball back.\n26:29 Comment: Paredes back on his feet as well.\n26:32 Comment: Here's Tevez.\n26:33 Comment: He needs to get more involved, Tevez.\n26:36 Comment: Whenever he's on the ball, Juve look more dangerous now.\n26:39 Comment: Lichsteiner's cross far too short.\n26:42 Comment: Tevez has gone to ground inside the box\n26:44 Comment: and cleared by Alonso.\n26:50 Comment: Artagli, lovely play.\n26:52 Comment: Lovely little touch just to take it away.\n26:55 Comment: From Gomez.\n26:57 Comment: Yes, a class act, Andrea Barzali.\n26:59 Comment: Just to think his first match of the year.\n27:2 Comment: Not that long ago back in Palermo.\n27:7 Comment: Paredes.\n27:8 Comment: Couldn't get the cross away,\n27:10 Comment: but again, it's another corner kick for Juve.\n27:14 Comment: Paredes just taking a knock as well.\n27:16 Comment: Taking five just to run it off.\n27:22 Comment: A round of applause for Pirlo every time he goes to take a corner kick.\n27:25 Comment: Whichever side.\n27:28 Comment: Absolutely.\n27:28 Comment: Always has been here at the Juventus Stadium.\n27:31 Comment: A fan favourite, certainly.\n27:33 Comment: Here he goes into the middle.\n27:35 Comment: It's a header from Sturaro, but there's a free kick.\n27:38 Comment: Well, it was easily saved anyway by Neto.\n27:41 Comment: Good movement though by Sturaro.\n27:45 Comment: Looking for his first goal at the Bianconeri.\n27:49 Comment: Here's indeed after his move over the January transfer window.\n27:55 Comment: From Genoa.\n27:58 Comment: He's played...\n28:0 Comment: It says fifth start, Sturaro.\n28:3 Comment: In Serie A.\n28:12 Comment: So the cheers going round the stadium are connected to the fate of Turin's city cousins.\n28:17 Comment: Aquilani in the box.\n28:20 Comment: Easy save for Gigi Buffon indeed.\n28:22 Comment: Yes, nothing to do with the Lazio match, but...\n28:25 Comment: Torino currently behind.\n28:29 Comment: Which is why the cheers went up.\n28:34 Comment: Aquilani in a decent position there with the cross cut in right in front of Buffon.\n28:40 Comment: Those half chances have really got to be converted against a side like Juventus.\n28:45 Comment: There's more buzz about Fiorentina than there is about the home side at the moment.\n28:49 Comment: Yeah, absolutely.\n28:50 Comment: A very strange performance.\n28:53 Comment: A strange first half.\n28:54 Comment: In general, I'd say...\n28:57 Comment: They're setting up a muted affair.\n29:1 Comment: Between two sides that normally sparks fly.\n29:12 Comment: There's Joaquin.\n29:14 Comment: I don't see much of him down that right-hand side.\n29:17 Comment: Salah inside to Gomez.\n29:20 Comment: Just trying to feed it onto one of his midfielders.\n29:23 Comment: Midfielders.\n29:24 Comment: Evra's header out.\n29:26 Comment: Now the Juve fans making themselves heard.\n29:30 Comment: There's a good pressure, though, from Fiorentina.\n29:33 Comment: There is indeed.\n29:34 Comment: As Joaquin almost went beyond Storaro.\n29:37 Comment: He'd gone past him and then got the ball stuck between his feet.\n29:41 Comment: Now it's Evra coming away with possession.\n29:43 Comment: But Juve coming out from their own half rather slowly.\n29:46 Comment: And Evra's ball just played into no man's land.\n29:51 Comment: It should have been Lichsteiner land.\n29:52 Comment: But the Switzerland international was.\n29:54 Comment: Holding back with only Tevez on your end up front.\n29:59 Comment: Tevez asking for the ball.\n30:1 Comment: But he got it lighter than he would have liked.\n30:5 Comment: Pierlo.\n30:6 Comment: Putting Storaro under a bit of pressure.\n30:9 Comment: Storaro with a foul on Salah.\n30:14 Comment: And it's Salah.\n30:17 Comment: Just rubbing his knee.\n30:20 Comment: Just got a knock.\n30:21 Comment: It was the trailing foot.\n30:22 Comment: It wasn't the foot that won the ball.\n30:24 Comment: But it's Salah.\n30:26 Comment: It's an unintentional from Storaro.\n30:29 Comment: Yeah, absolutely.\n30:30 Comment: It didn't hurt.\n30:37 Comment: Three kicks being given.\n30:39 Comment: And we're inside the centre circle.\n30:42 Comment: One, two.\n30:43 Comment: Rodriguez.\n30:46 Comment: And Quilani.\n30:47 Comment: Salah.\n30:47 Comment: It's a nice turn.\n30:48 Comment: Goes past Pierlo.\n30:50 Comment: Sweeps past Pierlo.\n30:51 Comment: Then brings Alonso into play.\n30:53 Comment: Alonso with a shot.\n30:54 Comment: Reflection.\n30:54 Comment: Going well wide of goal.\n30:58 Comment: Great acceleration from Salah.\n31:1 Comment: Wonderful spin away from Pierlo.\n31:3 Comment: There's no way the midfielder is going to chase him down.\n31:10 Comment: It's Mati Fernandes.\n31:12 Comment: Joaquin.\n31:16 Comment: There's the Spaniard.\n31:17 Comment: Taking on Pierlo.\n31:19 Comment: It's a penalty.\n31:21 Comment: A trip by Pierlo.\n31:22 Comment: Pierlo says it's outside the box.\n31:23 Comment: The referee, however,\n31:24 Comment: has no doubt he's pointing to the penalty spot.\n31:31 Comment: We'll see it again.\n31:32 Comment: I have a feeling Pierlo was inside the box.\n31:34 Comment: He was indeed.\n31:37 Comment: From the replays.\n31:40 Comment: It's a silly penalty to give away, isn't it?\n31:46 Comment: At that point there, you let the player go past you.\n31:48 Comment: Keep your feet down.\n31:50 Comment: Absolutely.\n31:50 Comment: Any contact.\n31:52 Comment: And the referee has to award the...\n31:54 Comment: the spot kick.\n31:55 Comment: Now, Banti's coming running across to the Juventus technical area.\n32:0 Comment: The referee is calling somebody over.\n32:2 Comment: Is it Max Allegri?\n32:3 Comment: It is indeed.\n32:5 Comment: And it's a penalty.\n32:6 Comment: Gonzalo Rodriguez is holding the ball already.\n32:10 Comment: Five goals to his name.\n32:11 Comment: Just two behind.\n32:14 Comment: Kamil Glik has a top goal-scoring defender of Serie A.\n32:17 Comment: As Max Allegri gets his...\n32:19 Comment: talking to.\n32:21 Comment: Well, he's left Allegri.\n32:23 Comment: Inside his technical area.\n32:25 Comment: So he hasn't sent him off.\n32:27 Comment: But it's a penalty definitely which the captain,\n32:30 Comment: the Fiorentina captain, is ready to take.\n32:32 Comment: Now, Fiorentina miss four penalties out of four.\n32:35 Comment: Well, not this one.\n32:37 Comment: It is 1-0 to Fiorentina.\n32:40 Comment: 33 minutes gone here at the Juventus stadium.\n32:42 Comment: And once again, it's Fiorentina who lead.\n32:48 Comment: Well, maybe that will shake Juventus.\n32:50 Comment: Wake them up a little bit.\n32:52 Comment: But it is.\n32:52 Comment: It's been...\n32:53 Comment: It's a low-par performance from the home side.\n32:57 Comment: You can't really argue about the penalty appeal.\n33:0 Comment: They're still arguing, though, Juventus players.\n33:2 Comment: Well, despite the protests.\n33:5 Comment: I'm sure Joaquin could have stayed on his feet, absolutely.\n33:8 Comment: But no wonder we ever see a player not call for a penalty when tripped up.\n33:12 Comment: And that, considering your team had missed four penalties out of four,\n33:17 Comment: is a quality finish rattled into the side of net.\n33:21 Comment: And there's the trip again.\n33:22 Comment: Clear contact between Juventus.\n33:24 Comment: Here appear Luton and Joaquin.\n33:28 Comment: And Fiorentina once again lead at the Juventus stadium in 2015.\n33:34 Comment: Juventus' last home win.\n33:36 Comment: Sorry, home defeat was back in January.\n33:43 Comment: Now we're going to see a reaction in these last ten minutes or so\n33:47 Comment: from Juve.\n33:48 Comment: Pereira trying to bundle his way through.\n33:51 Comment: Sturaro.\n33:52 Comment: Neto's come running way out.\n33:53 Comment: He's in this area.\n33:55 Comment: Ooh, what are we going to see here?\n33:57 Comment: Yellow card for Neto.\n33:58 Comment: Again, it's a silly foul to give away.\n34:2 Comment: Well, I'm not sure.\n34:3 Comment: I'll wait to see the replay, but I have to say I have some doubts\n34:6 Comment: as to whether it was a foul.\n34:11 Comment: Yeah, maybe he did just get contact.\n34:14 Comment: Again, Sturaro probably could have stayed on his feet.\n34:18 Comment: Well, certainly Neto pulled his legs back to try and pull out of the challenge.\n34:23 Comment: Luckily for the Fiorentina goal, it's just a yellow.\n34:27 Comment: And the ball had gone out of play.\n34:29 Comment: At least the game's come to life a little bit.\n34:32 Comment: The penalty from Fiorentina.\n34:34 Comment: This appear.\n34:36 Comment: Which,\n34:38 Comment: of course, the home fans here, the Juve fans would have loved to have seen Neto sent off.\n34:44 Comment: Going back to the last league defeat for Juventus was January 2013 against Sampdoria.\n34:50 Comment: Now, Pirlo, this is a decent position, but it's quite a tight end.\n34:54 Comment: It's going to take something very special indeed to beat Neto from that kind of angle.\n34:59 Comment: Just going to whip it into the middle.\n35:2 Comment: It's Llorente!\n35:4 Comment: 1-1.\n35:6 Comment: Excellent move by the four players grouped in the middle there for Juventus.\n35:11 Comment: They made the run, leaving Llorente the real target for the free kick from Pirlo.\n35:16 Comment: If he doesn't score, he'll set them up and Juventus back on level terms.\n35:20 Comment: They were behind for all of three minutes.\n35:24 Comment: And not long at all.\n35:26 Comment: Two and a half minutes actually, I make it.\n35:30 Comment: Llorente, 36 minutes gone.\n35:33 Comment: Levels the score.\n35:35 Comment: Let's see it again from the replay.\n35:37 Comment: Well, that's what he does so well.\n35:39 Comment: He just seemed to leap up between two players.\n35:43 Comment: Just directed his header into that corner.\n35:46 Comment: A ball though, played into the heart of the six yard box.\n35:50 Comment: And your keeper is rooted on his goal line.\n35:52 Comment: I bet there's no question.\n35:54 Comment: He's got a lot of marks over Nato.\n35:55 Comment: One, they give away the free kick, which was unnecessary.\n35:58 Comment: And two, he should have come off his line and dominated\n36:3 Comment: his six yard area.\n36:8 Comment: Stadium suddenly comes to life here, the J Stadium as they call it.\n36:17 Comment: Licksteiner will want to take the throw instead of Alonso.\n36:24 Comment: He said, I mentioned earlier,\n36:27 Comment: that Allegri wanted more goals from the strikers and Llorente has responded.\n36:38 Comment: Llorente's sixth of the season.\n36:43 Comment: Here he is again.\n36:46 Comment: It's certainly going to be a boost of confidence and it's a corner kick.\n36:52 Comment: And Gonzalo Rodriguez,\n36:53 Comment: he's saying, how can you make such a decision?\n36:56 Comment: The ball had not gone out.\n36:57 Comment: And I've got to say, I've got to agree with the current captain.\n37:0 Comment: The entire ball had not seemed to have crossed the line,\n37:3 Comment: but it makes no difference.\n37:4 Comment: The referees have decided.\n37:6 Comment: And there's a yellow card now for\n37:9 Comment: Burgess back from suspension, Gonzalo Rodriguez.\n37:13 Comment: I don't think we're going to get a replay of it.\n37:22 Comment: Pirlo.\n37:22 Comment: Towards.\n37:24 Comment: Oh, that's a miracle save.\n37:25 Comment: It was Evra.\n37:27 Comment: Fabulous save by Neto.\n37:30 Comment: Outstanding reflexes.\n37:32 Comment: Was it Tevez there in the middle?\n37:34 Comment: And it was a counterattack now for Fiorentina.\n37:42 Comment: You can hear a round of applause for Barzagli.\n37:48 Comment: I thought it was Evra running in, but it might have been Pereira.\n37:52 Comment: But it was not.\n37:53 Comment: It was Evra.\n37:54 Comment: Certainly Evra is very accomplished in the air.\n38:0 Comment: What a fabulous reflex save.\n38:5 Comment: It was a bullet header.\n38:7 Comment: We're seeing the foul, but we'd rather see the gold mouth incident.\n38:12 Comment: Here we go.\n38:13 Comment: It was Evra.\n38:14 Comment: Fantastic save.\n38:16 Comment: It came at him at real speed.\n38:22 Comment: Barzagli onto Pirlo.\n38:30 Comment: It's a shame there's only six minutes left of the half.\n38:34 Comment: Yeah, they've finally woken up.\n38:36 Comment: It was the wake up call.\n38:37 Comment: We needed the penalty kick on 32 minutes.\n38:42 Comment: Chiellini over to Barzagli.\n38:44 Comment: But also the Juventus fans have got to play their part in the end of season.\n38:48 Comment: Got to get behind the team, give them a lift.\n38:50 Comment: Barzagli.\n38:53 Comment: And nobody on the playing side or on the sporting side can take anything for granted.\n38:58 Comment: Salah on the edge of the box.\n39:1 Comment: Well, he let one fly.\n39:2 Comment: It was well wide in the end, but he did have the space to shoot.\n39:6 Comment: And from our angle up here on the press box, it seemed closer than it was.\n39:11 Comment: Yeah, just caught it with the outside of the foot, didn't he?\n39:13 Comment: Rather than curling it towards goal.\n39:17 Comment: This is offside, I think.\n39:20 Comment: Or is it tangling between?\n39:23 Comment: Llorente and Basanta.\n39:26 Comment: Leaning in by the forward.\n39:35 Comment: Taken by Basanta towards Mario Gomez,\n39:38 Comment: who was told to get back onto his feet by the referee.\n39:44 Comment: Evra now.\n39:47 Comment: Sturaro goes back to Chiellini.\n39:50 Comment: Pressure from Aquilani.\n39:51 Comment: He was asking for Salah to go forward as well.\n39:54 Comment: Some pressure on Pirlo.\n39:56 Comment: Certainly Salah.\n39:58 Comment: The move by Montella has worked.\n40:1 Comment: Hasn't made it easy for Pirlo to find space just outside his own box.\n40:7 Comment: Here's Pereira.\n40:9 Comment: He's got Licksteiner wide.\n40:11 Comment: Finally finds him.\n40:12 Comment: Licksteiner down the line.\n40:14 Comment: And Marcuse is going to be offside here.\n40:16 Comment: It's Airsoft controversy for Inter again.\n40:26 Comment: Juventus are quite flat this evening.\n40:29 Comment: They've got The lift after being behind.\n40:31 Comment: They don't like trailing to anybody.\n40:35 Comment: Should also this Fiorentina side we mentioned,\n40:39 Comment: There's more buzz about them.\n40:41 Comment: Without Banja Valhalla and Pezz Cesaro.\n40:45 Comment: the second half.\n40:49 Comment: The ball is going to go straight out of play.\n40:53 Comment: Both Cavalero and Pizarro both on the bench this evening.\n40:59 Comment: We'll see them later on in the second half.\n41:9 Comment: It's given away to Joaquin.\n41:13 Comment: A little Catena side but the second one of Fiora's\n41:43 Comment: Joaquin who's taken on Pereira this time\n41:45 Comment: not Pirlo\n41:46 Comment: Salah\n41:49 Comment: that's a nice move, Mati Fernandes\n41:53 Comment: is there but well covered by Lichsteiner\n41:55 Comment: who came in with a sliding\n41:57 Comment: challenge\n41:58 Comment: lovely play at the edge of the box by Viviola\n42:0 Comment: very well work moved\n42:4 Comment: once again Joaquin\n42:6 Comment: to switch into this left side for corners\n42:10 Comment: seems to be finding his feet again\n42:13 Comment: dribbling past Pirlo\n42:15 Comment: and Pereira\n42:16 Comment: comes out to mask him\n42:18 Comment: today with the\n42:20 Comment: square ball across to Salah\n42:23 Comment: taking on Sturaro\n42:25 Comment: back to the number 5, the midfielder\n42:28 Comment: plays the cross in towards Gomez\n42:31 Comment: headed out by Chiellini\n42:32 Comment: but it's still Fiorentina in possession\n42:34 Comment: and the event is defense slow to come out\n42:36 Comment: over the top\n42:39 Comment: Mati Fernandes plays it down\n42:42 Comment: and Marquise you're happy to just clear it\n42:45 Comment: as far away as possible\n42:46 Comment: and Gonzalo Rodriguez taking no chances\n42:51 Comment: against Tevez\n42:52 Comment: that long clearance\n42:53 Comment: Montello would be happy with this side\n42:56 Comment: they've pinned Juventus back\n42:57 Comment: for some periods in this first half\n43:0 Comment: Lichsteiner down the line\n43:4 Comment: Llorente\n43:5 Comment: keeping it in play\n43:8 Comment: running another\n43:9 Comment: throw for his side\n43:11 Comment: Marquise coming in\n43:16 Comment: and it's only Pereira\n43:18 Comment: there's Marquise\n43:20 Comment: Lichsteiner with the cross\n43:24 Comment: it's a decent effort towards Llorente\n43:26 Comment: it's Ali going down\n43:30 Comment: and Marquise\n43:32 Comment: getting the better of Salah this time\n43:34 Comment: that was close though\n43:36 Comment: Salah's pace\n43:39 Comment: Juve players know all about it\n43:41 Comment: and you can tell that they're wary of\n43:44 Comment: him running away with the ball\n43:46 Comment: even once he's inside his own half\n43:48 Comment: Tevez\n43:50 Comment: to Lichsteiner\n43:52 Comment: Lichsteiner\n43:53 Comment: out to Pereira\n43:55 Comment: poor pass from Lichsteiner\n44:0 Comment: it was an easy ball\n44:1 Comment: to play out to Pereira\n44:3 Comment: it's a good mark\n44:7 Comment: Mario Gomez going down\n44:9 Comment: he's still holding his face as he comes across to the touchline\n44:11 Comment: but Lichsteiner hasn't been at the races at all this evening\n44:15 Comment: now Llor has Tevez I have to say\n44:20 Comment: I think it's one of the quietest performances I've seen from Tevez so far\n44:23 Comment: Pereira with the cross to the far post\n44:28 Comment: Toraro's there\n44:29 Comment: nods it down but so is Savic\n44:31 Comment: it's Toraro\n44:34 Comment: comes it back for his side\n44:36 Comment: Evra to Pirlo\n44:37 Comment: Toraro\n44:40 Comment: finds Tevez\n44:43 Comment: he went for the shot\n44:46 Comment: from some distance again\n44:48 Comment: certainly not full of the usual running is he\n44:52 Comment: Carlitos Tevez\n44:54 Comment: not the kind of running we'd expect from him anyway\n44:57 Comment: Evra drills in\n45:1 Comment: well we were saying\n45:3 Comment: Carlitos Tevez\n45:5 Comment: the shortest man on the pitch probably\n45:7 Comment: but he's got a good shot\n45:7 Comment: well just to prove me wrong\n45:12 Comment: Tevez makes it 2-1 for Juve\n45:14 Comment: I was watching his run there from deep in midfield\n45:17 Comment: Mati Fernandes pointed to his defenders\n45:19 Comment: to follow the run of the number 10\n45:21 Comment: Mati Fernandes don't understand why he didn't follow the run\n45:24 Comment: as the half-time whistle goes\n45:26 Comment: and Juventus go into the break\n45:27 Comment: 2-1 advantage\n45:29 Comment: after being a goal behind Tevez\n45:31 Comment: the man who's never been in the game\n45:33 Comment: pops up\n45:34 Comment: and puts his side in front\n45:35 Comment: at the interval\n45:36 Comment: be sure to join us\n45:37 Comment: and we'll see you next time\n45:37 Comment: after the break for the second half\n45:39 Comment: now we'll be right back\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Fiorentina get the second half underway then.\n0:4 Comment: And I believe they have managed to turn it around.\n0:8 Comment: There's still a long way to go.\n0:10 Comment: We saw they were leading against Torino,\n0:12 Comment: looking very comfortable in the derby.\n0:15 Comment: And we know how that ended.\n0:17 Comment: So Fiorentina still with plenty of chances.\n0:21 Comment: You've got to feel that last minute goal\n0:24 Comment: may have taken the wind out of them ever so slightly.\n0:28 Comment: As Chiellini comes in with his usual rugged challenge.\n0:32 Comment: On the ball.\n0:33 Comment: And it had to be.\n0:34 Comment: Joaquin racing into the heart of the event.\n0:37 Comment: His penalty box.\n0:38 Comment: There was a moment there in the first half\n0:40 Comment: with Lazio winning at the Olimpico.\n0:43 Comment: That this Serie A season could have gone even beyond this weekend.\n0:51 Comment: Fernandez then with the corner kick.\n0:53 Comment: And it's a good one as well.\n0:55 Comment: The overhead kick didn't get too far from Basanta.\n0:59 Comment: Marcus Alonso is the last player.\n1:1 Comment: Goes back to Neto.\n1:3 Comment: Goes for a fraction of time.\n1:5 Comment: The lead was cut down to 11 points.\n1:7 Comment: Which meant that Juventus couldn't have won the Scudetto.\n1:11 Comment: Of course it needs a victory here from the league leaders.\n1:16 Comment: And Lazio to either draw or lose against Parma.\n1:21 Comment: Which seems difficult considering they were 3-0 up.\n1:24 Comment: But even for the weekend match against Sampdoria,\n1:27 Comment: the Marassi, even then the Scudetto would have been on hold.\n1:30 Comment: If Juventus don't win this evening.\n1:32 Comment: Yeah, sure.\n1:34 Comment: If they do win here, then all they need is a point at the weekend.\n1:39 Comment: To make the title.\n1:41 Comment: Mathematically theirs.\n1:47 Comment: Here's Fernandez on the ball.\n1:55 Comment: And Morata warming up for Juventus.\n1:59 Comment: Fiorentina have Valero, Vargas and Ilicic.\n2:3 Comment: Going through their paces.\n2:5 Comment: Vargas who was warming up as well towards the end of the first half.\n2:9 Comment: I'd say so far, strangely, even though they are a goal down,\n2:14 Comment: it was Fiorentina who looked the more positive side for much of that first half.\n2:19 Comment: Is that because Juventus were allowing them to?\n2:23 Comment: Because when Juventus put their foot down on the accelerator,\n2:26 Comment: and then hit Fiorentina hard.\n2:32 Comment: Sturaro.\n2:34 Comment: Challenged by two players, but it's fair play.\n2:37 Comment: Play on, says the ref.\n2:42 Comment: Alonso taking on Licksteiner, looking for a possible cross.\n2:47 Comment: Badet.\n2:49 Comment: Back to Alonso.\n2:53 Comment: Taking on the Swiss international.\n2:55 Comment: And that's going to be...\n2:57 Comment: Goal kick indeed, came off Alonso.\n3:1 Comment: Alonso.\n3:12 Comment: Tevez has now equaled his goal tally from last season.\n3:17 Comment: Nice play from Llorente and Tevez into the path of Pereira.\n3:22 Comment: Here's Tevez.\n3:24 Comment: Just laying the ball off to Evra Sturaro.\n3:28 Comment: Tevez.\n3:30 Comment: Tevez in the box.\n3:32 Comment: Tevez again, still in possession.\n3:34 Comment: Unbelievable, Marchisio with a follow-up shot.\n3:37 Comment: Now the counter-attack for Fiorentina.\n3:39 Comment: Indeed it is.\n3:41 Comment: And Evra will get a yellow card for this.\n3:43 Comment: I'm not sure he meant it, but...\n3:45 Comment: Mati Fernandes was away.\n3:48 Comment: It was a tight... Aquilani, Aquilani.\n3:52 Comment: That's a big cross.\n4:1 Comment: Here's the run from Tevez.\n4:3 Comment: Evra will miss the next match.\n4:5 Comment: He will be suspended.\n4:7 Comment: There's the trip from Evra.\n4:9 Comment: Cutting across the path of Aquilani.\n4:11 Comment: Just about to release the pass for Mati Fernandes.\n4:14 Comment: Savage goes back to Rodriguez.\n4:18 Comment: Evra, not sure he would have played anyway next weekend against Sampdoria,\n4:24 Comment: with the two matches against Real Madrid in between.\n4:31 Comment: And also with a cross, cuts it back to Gomez Salah!\n4:35 Comment: Well he had to take it quickly.\n4:38 Comment: It was bubbling away from him, couldn't keep it down.\n4:42 Comment: At least we have some entertainment now from the half hour mark,\n4:45 Comment: the game has burst into life.\n4:47 Comment: And chances at both ends.\n4:50 Comment: The quality of Salah, expecting to get that on target.\n4:56 Comment: Nick Steiner, play on says the ref.\n5:0 Comment: Llorente's ball, slightly short, Asante intercepting,\n5:3 Comment: Pirlo, don't often see Pirlo just hacking it away.\n5:7 Comment: Picked up by Sturaro though.\n5:10 Comment: Sturaro, busting through the middle.\n5:12 Comment: That's great defending by Joaquin.\n5:21 Comment: Now the Juventus stadium at least is making itself heard.\n5:25 Comment: Very quiet in the first half, possibly on purpose.\n5:34 Comment: Here's Pereira.\n5:38 Comment: Just waits for Nick Steiner to come forward.\n5:43 Comment: Back to Pereira.\n5:46 Comment: Raritali now.\n5:50 Comment: Marquezio.\n5:53 Comment: Malduve just happy to hold on to possession.\n5:56 Comment: Goes back to Chiellini.\n5:59 Comment: All the way back to Buffon.\n6:2 Comment: He hasn't had too much to do in fairness.\n6:6 Comment: Raritali maybe just took his eye off the ball,\n6:9 Comment: playing it straight out of play.\n6:14 Comment: One back by Juve. Here's Pereira.\n6:17 Comment: Marquezio.\n6:20 Comment: Raritali is free once again on that right-hand side.\n6:28 Comment: Here's Llorente. That was nicely down on the chest,\n6:30 Comment: but the flag was up.\n6:32 Comment: Yeah, it came back from an offside position.\n6:34 Comment: Llorente doing what he does well there.\n6:37 Comment: Holding off the defender.\n6:38 Comment: Right-hand side.\n6:41 Comment: That's a good ball.\n6:43 Comment: That's an offside position.\n6:45 Comment: Llorente doing what he does well there.\n6:48 Comment: Holding off the defender.\n6:49 Comment: Laying the ball back with his chest.\n6:52 Comment: That goal will do him good.\n6:54 Comment: It was being grappled by the defender with a free kick.\n6:56 Comment: Floated in by Pierlot.\n6:58 Comment: Still held off the challenge.\n7:0 Comment: Powered the header past Neto.\n7:3 Comment: Storado winning it back here.\n7:6 Comment: Savic's attempt almost crept in.\n7:9 Comment: Buffon had it covered,\n7:11 Comment: but probably would have snuck it underneath the crossbar.\n7:18 Comment: It is the best I've seen Storado in the black and white shirt\n7:23 Comment: so far since he arrived.\n7:25 Comment: I remember his debut against Palermo.\n7:27 Comment: He really was feeling the weight of the history of that shirt.\n7:31 Comment: But he's now getting used to it,\n7:33 Comment: training with more illustrious teammates than at Genoa.\n7:39 Comment: He's now showing his powerful midfield running.\n7:42 Comment: That's why Allegri wanted him here.\n7:49 Comment: Lichsteiner battling with Alonso.\n7:52 Comment: Here's Pereira being forced back towards goal as well.\n7:56 Comment: He's done well.\n7:57 Comment: Pereira in forward towards Carlitos Tenez.\n8:2 Comment: Stuck by Rodriguez this time.\n8:9 Comment: Tenez clears it long and it's over the head of Pierlot\n8:13 Comment: into the path of Salah.\n8:16 Comment: Leaves it for Joaquin this time to come forward.\n8:21 Comment: Back for Aquilani who went for the shot.\n8:24 Comment: That was Storado who raced back, sprinted back from inside.\n8:27 Comment: If you're going to have to get himself in the way of that shot.\n8:31 Comment: He teed it up for himself,\n8:33 Comment: but it looked like it was going wide anyway.\n8:37 Comment: We'll see the replay of that savage clearance.\n8:40 Comment: He's tested Buffon.\n8:44 Comment: An early one and a good delivery as well.\n8:47 Comment: Gomez not happy about the handling inside the box.\n8:50 Comment: The free kick goes again.\n8:52 Comment: It's a good delivery.\n8:54 Comment: Gomez is now in the box.\n8:56 Comment: Gomez to get his head up.\n8:58 Comment: He did and if he didn't go for it,\n9:0 Comment: would it be Aquilani or Mati Fernandez behind?\n9:3 Comment: They were all marked as well.\n9:5 Comment: Good marking by Juventus.\n9:7 Comment: Perhaps a free kick was given for the foul by Mati Fernandez on Storado.\n9:17 Comment: The free kick is a bit of a problem.\n9:19 Comment: It's a bit of a problem for the goalkeeper.\n9:21 Comment: He's got to be careful.\n9:23 Comment: It's a bit of a problem for the goalkeeper.\n9:25 Comment: He's got to be careful.\n9:27 Comment: It's a bit of a problem for the goalkeeper.\n11:16 Comment: Savic goes back.\n11:30 Comment: Juventus made their first change.\n11:34 Comment: Some of them are still going through their paces.\n11:38 Comment: They will pass Kwales also.\n11:42 Comment: No one stripped down as of yet.\n11:49 Comment: Juventus are in the lead.\n12:17 Comment: Mailowski and Sendporal.\n12:30 Comment: Juventus defended their advantage.\n12:37 Comment: Right across the board.\n12:43 Comment: Storaro.\n12:52 Comment: Michelinie going back to his keeper once again.\n13:1 Comment: Here's Evra.\n13:4 Comment: Inside to Marchisio.\n13:7 Comment: That's a good pull forward to Llorente if it stays in play.\n13:10 Comment: It has to stay in play, Patrick.\n13:14 Comment: Llorente needs support.\n13:16 Comment: Into Pereira.\n13:17 Comment: Pereira.\n13:18 Comment: And he couldn't get past his first man.\n13:22 Comment: Defending.\n13:25 Comment: Coma Basanta.\n13:29 Comment: Now cross field pass from Akimelani.\n13:32 Comment: He was looking for a more mobile striker than Mario Gomez.\n13:37 Comment: There's Chiellini.\n13:46 Comment: Picked up by Marchisio.\n13:48 Comment: Now Pereira. Forward.\n13:50 Comment: Well, it was a ball intended for Tevez.\n13:54 Comment: Tevez made the run across rather than going deep.\n14:7 Comment: Reto once again.\n14:14 Comment: This time going long.\n14:16 Comment: And Vidal, he will get underneath this.\n14:18 Comment: Indeed, he does.\n14:21 Comment: Marchisio has got movement ahead of him.\n14:25 Comment: Here's Storaro on the chest for Tevez.\n14:28 Comment: Opens it up for Vidal.\n14:29 Comment: Vidal's cross is a wonderful one for Pereira.\n14:33 Comment: Can Storaro go on his way?\n14:35 Comment: Yeah, I think he did.\n14:36 Comment: Tevez couldn't stay on his feet and now Salah's away.\n14:39 Comment: But he's very isolated.\n14:41 Comment: Salah's going to have to go all the way on his own.\n14:43 Comment: He's done it before, Patrick.\n14:44 Comment: He certainly has.\n14:47 Comment: And he shouldn't have passed the Gomez.\n14:48 Comment: He should have gone all the way on his own.\n14:51 Comment: The space had opened up for him.\n14:55 Comment: Joaquin.\n14:56 Comment: Not a bad effort, but by then, the Juve players had got back\n15:0 Comment: into position.\n15:2 Comment: Certainly, Salah's pace doesn't seem that fast at times,\n15:6 Comment: but he just seems to fly past players.\n15:15 Comment: Great work by Tevez, coming back inside his own penalty area\n15:17 Comment: to put in the tackle on Salah.\n15:20 Comment: No Fiorentina teammate gave the Egyptian a warning.\n15:28 Comment: Goes back to Rodriguez.\n15:32 Comment: And they open it up for Joaquin, but Evra's there first.\n15:43 Comment: And second.\n15:44 Comment: Second experience of the Frenchman has become a major\n15:48 Comment: factor as the season has progressed.\n15:50 Comment: It took him a little bit of time to settle into Italian football.\n15:54 Comment: Aided by his French colleague, a certain Paul Pogba.\n15:57 Comment: They have linked up beautifully at times on the left-hand side.\n16:1 Comment: Remember, Juventus have been playing the last month and a half\n16:5 Comment: without Pogba.\n16:7 Comment: Yeah, and word is, the young Frenchman could possibly be\n16:13 Comment: available to play in the return Champions League match.\n16:17 Comment: That is in a couple of weeks time.\n16:18 Comment: So he's not far away from full fitness, apparently.\n16:20 Comment: No one wants to bring him back too soon.\n16:27 Comment: Here's Pereira.\n16:31 Comment: Nice play.\n16:37 Comment: And he's put the ball out as there is a player down.\n16:47 Comment: On the far side of the field, it is Marquise Oc who stayed down.\n16:55 Comment: I think we all know what happened there.\n17:0 Comment: A delicate question.\n17:3 Comment: It looks very painful for Marquise Oc.\n17:7 Comment: Montella speaks to Joaquin on the touchline.\n17:15 Comment: There is still a flurry of activity on the touchline with the Fiorentina substitutes.\n17:21 Comment: Also those of Juventus, Padoen.\n17:25 Comment: Padoen in command and Pepe now.\n17:28 Comment: So they've replaced the previous three.\n17:31 Comment: Vidal is on, Morata is back on the bench.\n17:34 Comment: Although he's back on his feet.\n17:36 Comment: I'm just looking over on the bench, coming down to talk to...\n17:42 Comment: He's been told to get back out and warm up again.\n17:46 Comment: As has Ogbonna.\n17:49 Comment: So I guess they've taken it in turns.\n17:51 Comment: Now it's back their turn.\n17:55 Comment: No sign of a substitution yet from Vincenzo Montella.\n17:59 Comment: And Marquise Oc is good to go.\n18:1 Comment: Actually made his Serie A debut against Fiorentina back in August 2007 while playing for Empoli.\n18:7 Comment: On the same Empoli side as Sebastian Jovinko.\n18:13 Comment: Since left Juventus in January.\n18:17 Comment: Here is Marquise Oc.\n18:22 Comment: Vidal back to Lichtsteiner.\n18:24 Comment: Now Pereira.\n18:25 Comment: Pereira nicely done.\n18:27 Comment: One, two and then three.\n18:29 Comment: Didn't pick up the free kick maybe he was looking for on the edge of the box.\n18:38 Comment: Tevez and Evra exchanging passes very nicely indeed.\n18:47 Comment: It's opened up for Lichtsteiner now.\n18:49 Comment: Lichtsteiner's got space here to pick a pass.\n18:51 Comment: Across towards Storaro.\n18:54 Comment: Maybe it would have been better to aim it towards Llorente who's coming in at the near post.\n19:0 Comment: Again Neto appeared determined to come off his line then backpedaled.\n19:6 Comment: Putting the pressure on the defender.\n19:11 Comment: And we get a close up of the substitutes.\n19:13 Comment: It's been a strange season for Neto.\n19:17 Comment: Because he was a very good player.\n19:21 Comment: He was number one choice at the start of the season.\n19:24 Comment: And in fact playing brilliantly.\n19:26 Comment: And then lost his place after he decided not to renew his contract.\n19:32 Comment: Only for his replacement Tatar Rashan to pick up an injury.\n19:35 Comment: And so back in he came and did a fine job on the whole.\n19:42 Comment: There's no doubting that he would be first choice keeper at Fiorentina.\n19:45 Comment: If he were to sign on that dotted line.\n19:51 Comment: Pereira under pressure from Aquilani.\n19:54 Comment: Held him off nicely.\n19:57 Comment: Evra though losing out to Savic is Gomez.\n20:2 Comment: Forward just playing it behind Salah.\n20:4 Comment: Joaquin.\n20:6 Comment: He's been brought down.\n20:7 Comment: The referee looks at it and it's another penalty.\n20:10 Comment: This seems to be more of a clear cut penalty than the one in the first half.\n20:14 Comment: I didn't want to say anything until the referee had made up his mind.\n20:18 Comment: Two penalties at the Juventus Stadium against the home side, Patrick.\n20:23 Comment: And two penalties won by Joaquin.\n20:25 Comment: With that slight shimmy of the leg.\n20:29 Comment: And again Chiellini catching his man.\n20:32 Comment: Can't really complain.\n20:34 Comment: No, it is a trip.\n20:36 Comment: And I think the referee on this occasion just waited for the man on the touchline.\n20:43 Comment: On the goal line, should I say.\n20:45 Comment: To confirm that it was in fact a penalty.\n20:47 Comment: Because it took him a little while Bante to decide.\n20:53 Comment: He's in the stick on.\n20:55 Comment: And Gonzalo Rodriguez with a chance for a double from the penalty spot.\n20:59 Comment: Yeah.\n21:0 Comment: Well, we mentioned missed four.\n21:2 Comment: Now, can he score two in a row?\n21:4 Comment: Up against Buffon again.\n21:6 Comment: He's missed!\n21:9 Comment: Oh, he has missed and he missed the target.\n21:14 Comment: Buffon had guessed right.\n21:16 Comment: He closed down the angle.\n21:18 Comment: But there's a poor return.\n21:20 Comment: One goal out of five.\n21:22 Comment: Or one goal out of six.\n21:24 Comment: Blasted it wide.\n21:26 Comment: Oh, hit it with power too much.\n21:30 Comment: Uwe maintained that lead.\n21:34 Comment: 22 minutes gone in the second half.\n21:37 Comment: You can see Allegri's reaction as well.\n21:44 Comment: It's almost as if Uwe had scored a goal themselves.\n21:52 Comment: How crucial have these penalty misses been for Fiorentina this season?\n21:56 Comment: Very crucial.\n21:58 Comment: And Bantena might have to start thinking about finding a different penalty taker.\n22:2 Comment: Well, he's tried different penalty kick takers as Gonzalo Rodriguez had only missed one before today.\n22:10 Comment: It's just one of those seasons, I guess.\n22:15 Comment: We go back to the fact that their main striker has been out the entire campaign.\n22:20 Comment: Giuseppe Rossi last season didn't miss one.\n22:23 Comment: No, certainly would be the number one penalty taker if he were playing.\n22:32 Comment: Played forward by Marchisio.\n22:34 Comment: Too long for Tevez.\n22:38 Comment: It's taken a touch of Savic, though.\n22:43 Comment: A bit of a cruel blow for Fiorentina, it has to be said.\n22:49 Comment: Hands on hips by Vincenzo Montella.\n22:53 Comment: There's not much he can do when the players miss from the penalty spot.\n23:1 Comment: Pereira on to Vidal.\n23:3 Comment: Vidal thought about a shot for a second.\n23:8 Comment: Opens it up for Lichtsteiner.\n23:10 Comment: He's just looked a little bit more isolated out on that flank this evening.\n23:14 Comment: Not as well supported as maybe in the past.\n23:27 Comment: And Federer giving the free kick away.\n23:33 Comment: Certainly Joaquin has improved as the game has gone on.\n23:40 Comment: Every time he gets the ball now inside that box.\n23:44 Comment: That's got to be the main tactic now, isn't it?\n23:46 Comment: Get the ball to the feet of Joaquin inside the penalty area and let him jing and dance his way.\n23:51 Comment: Absolutely. Joaquin or Salah.\n23:54 Comment: I think the Juve defenders might have learnt their lesson by now.\n23:59 Comment: Montella's decided it's time for a change.\n24:1 Comment: He's called on his assistant to come down and see if he agrees with him.\n24:8 Comment: Pereira.\n24:9 Comment: Now Marquezio and Tevez is onside here.\n24:13 Comment: Tevez!\n24:15 Comment: What can you say? Carlitos Tevez.\n24:18 Comment: He very rarely misses.\n24:20 Comment: He makes the most difficult look so easy.\n24:24 Comment: That was a difficult goal to score.\n24:26 Comment: The angle was tight and he drilled it underneath Neto.\n24:31 Comment: Absolutely. 25 minutes gone. Juve 3, Fiorentina 1.\n24:36 Comment: It could have been 2-2 just a few minutes ago.\n24:40 Comment: Fiorentina missed the penalty.\n24:42 Comment: Tevez was absolutely onside.\n24:46 Comment: Look at that finish. That is some finish.\n24:50 Comment: Angled his body and right into that bottom corner.\n24:54 Comment: Enough power behind it to beat Neto.\n24:56 Comment: It was hit with some venom.\n24:59 Comment: Tevez.\n25:0 Comment: Two goals for a player who's hardly been in the match.\n25:8 Comment: That is exactly why he's rated as one of the top strikers in the world.\n25:16 Comment: We are going to see another change. It's Pereira to go off.\n25:19 Comment: Now Allegri shows up his back line.\n25:22 Comment: They're going to move to a five-man midfield.\n25:26 Comment: Pereira going off and Ogbonna coming on.\n25:29 Comment: So three at the back.\n25:31 Comment: Evra and Lichtsteiner will move up into the midfield area.\n25:37 Comment: There's the finish once again from Tevez.\n25:43 Comment: Fabulous finish. It really was.\n25:46 Comment: Allegri wanted more goals from his strikers.\n25:49 Comment: How about three or a three this evening?\n25:51 Comment: He certainly got them, absolutely.\n25:54 Comment: Tevez scoring his 20th of the season.\n25:57 Comment: Takes him clear at the top of the scoring charts.\n26:5 Comment: Gunning, of course, to become a capital camaraderie of Serie A.\n26:9 Comment: Top scorer of Serie A.\n26:10 Comment: We're going to see a change from Fiorentina as well.\n26:13 Comment: Mario Gomez going off.\n26:16 Comment: The German has been in and out of the game.\n26:20 Comment: Links up well on the edge of the box, but no real chances on goal.\n26:24 Comment: And now it's Gilardino, Alberto Gilardino, who's come on.\n26:30 Comment: The veteran.\n26:31 Comment: Buffon.\n26:34 Comment: Giving Gilardino a quick hug.\n26:36 Comment: The two, of course, old Italy teammates.\n26:41 Comment: World Cup winners together in 2006.\n26:44 Comment: Gilardino scored his first goal since his return at Calgary last weekend.\n26:49 Comment: He also scored his first goal for Fiorentina against Juventus back in August 2008.\n26:55 Comment: And then he's putting pressure on Buffon.\n26:58 Comment: Having some...\n27:2 Comment: pace up front which Mario Gomez doesn't have.\n27:7 Comment: You've got to wonder whether it's also time for Fiorentina to rethink their attack.\n27:11 Comment: Whether the German is worth sticking to next season.\n27:15 Comment: As I said, I think he links up well bringing players like Salah and Joachim into play.\n27:22 Comment: But it's not really enough if you always feel that your striker should be creating chances on goal for himself.\n27:30 Comment: That's where Mario Gomez hasn't really been able to do that all season.\n27:34 Comment: Just four goals all season for Gomez.\n27:38 Comment: It's not a great haul.\n27:39 Comment: You think Salah just arrived in January and scored more?\n27:42 Comment: Exactly.\n27:45 Comment: Handed out by Barzagli.\n27:52 Comment: Basanta drilled the ball across.\n27:55 Comment: It's more of a cross than a shot.\n27:57 Comment: And Fiorentina midfielder is claiming he took a deflection.\n28:0 Comment: Looks like a wicked spin on it.\n28:3 Comment: Maybe it did.\n28:4 Comment: But referee, I don't know.\n28:7 Comment: Cellini on the ball.\n28:12 Comment: And Bonner leaving this one for Buffon.\n28:18 Comment: And it's a goal.\n28:49 Comment: Poor ball this time for Ebra as he was spinning.\n29:2 Comment: penalty kick over the match for Fiorentina.\n29:5 Comment: Well, it's often the way, isn't it?\n29:6 Comment: You miss at one end and get punished at the other.\n29:11 Comment: That's exactly what happened to Fiorentina.\n29:13 Comment: It could have been so different.\n29:15 Comment: And now, it's a real run of poor results for Fiorentina.\n29:20 Comment: If they don't turn this around, that will be four on the trot.\n29:25 Comment: With Inter breathing down their necks.\n29:27 Comment: And Genoa and Sampdoria stepping away from them.\n29:31 Comment: Yeah, absolutely.\n29:33 Comment: What would have been an absolutely positive season\n29:38 Comment: could get away from them right at the end here.\n29:50 Comment: Matip Fernandes out to Joaquin.\n29:55 Comment: And again, skipping past Evra but not past Llorado this time.\n30:1 Comment: A yellow card there for Aquilani.\n30:5 Comment: Just came in a little bit late, didn't really catch Evra badly.\n30:20 Comment: Now we're going to see Morata coming on.\n30:24 Comment: And also Borja Valero.\n30:27 Comment: And Borja Valero, indeed.\n30:29 Comment: So, Teres, we'll get the standing ovation.\n30:31 Comment: You think Aquilani to come off.\n30:33 Comment: It's actually Matip Fernandes.\n30:39 Comment: Borja Valero on.\n30:53 Comment: And you saw Morata was ready to come on,\n30:54 Comment: but now it seems like Padouin.\n30:56 Comment: Indeed, sent Morata back.\n30:59 Comment: It's a strange decision, but maybe someone picking up a knock\n31:3 Comment: at the back is Llorado.\n31:5 Comment: Got a bit of a knee in the back.\n31:10 Comment: Tevez has simply stated that he wants to stay on as Gorodatric.\n31:13 Comment: Stretch away from those chasers in the Capocanninieri ranking.\n31:20 Comment: And it is Llorado who is going for the win.\n31:26 Comment: Coming off maybe just a little bit tired as well.\n31:29 Comment: So, Llorado being replaced by Padouin.\n31:35 Comment: A round of applause though for Llorado.\n31:50 Comment: That was a player down.\n31:52 Comment: It's Llorente.\n31:56 Comment: Llorado takes his seat.\n32:3 Comment: High fives all round.\n32:4 Comment: I'm very impressed by the young midfielder this evening.\n32:13 Comment: It's Borja Valero.\n32:14 Comment: Nice touch.\n32:27 Comment: Crossfield ball.\n32:29 Comment: He's fallen into the path of Vidal.\n32:32 Comment: Didn't get there though, ahead of Ballet.\n32:40 Comment: Alonso trying to get to the byline.\n32:43 Comment: This time stopped in his tracks by Linksteiner.\n32:47 Comment: Well, just over ten minutes left to play.\n32:50 Comment: It seems as if that third goal from Carlitos Tevez\n32:55 Comment: for Juve has wrapped it up really.\n32:58 Comment: Yeah, it's taken a lot of the belief out of Fiorentina.\n33:5 Comment: Vidal playing in Padouin.\n33:8 Comment: Finding himself well forward, Padouin.\n33:10 Comment: Slightly short from Vidal.\n33:20 Comment: I think Padouin will go back into the midfield position\n33:24 Comment: as he was occupying earlier in Llorado's place.\n33:27 Comment: That's easily Gigi Buffon's ball.\n33:32 Comment: So Juve set to bounce back from that derby defeat\n33:37 Comment: at the weekend with another victory here at the Juventus Stadium.\n33:41 Comment: It'll take a massive step towards the fourth consecutive Scudetto.\n33:47 Comment: As we mentioned, they travel to Sampdoria in the next match.\n34:2 Comment: Fiorentina will be at home against Cesena.\n34:7 Comment: Certainly a match for Montella's men to get back on track.\n34:12 Comment: Yeah, but Cesena fighting for their lives.\n34:14 Comment: Sampdoria, not so much a breather against Juventus\n34:17 Comment: but if they pick up three points this evening\n34:19 Comment: they'll go four points ahead of Fiorentina.\n34:21 Comment: They know they're in a different category\n34:23 Comment: from Napoli, Lazio and Roma.\n34:27 Comment: So they've got another three points on their direct rivals.\n34:44 Comment: Inside to Benaheim now as we approach the last ten minutes.\n34:48 Comment: Borja Valera bringing the ball forward up against Vidal.\n34:53 Comment: It's a decent cross. Everyone left it.\n34:56 Comment: Evra did well in fact not to touch it.\n34:58 Comment: They could have just brushed it with his chest.\n35:2 Comment: Had he controlled it, Kinn would have been wide on him.\n35:7 Comment: Another change for Fiorentina.\n35:9 Comment: 37,000 supporters here at the Juventus Stadium\n35:14 Comment: and they end up enjoying this match against our rivals Fiorentina.\n35:23 Comment: It took a while to get a go at it.\n35:25 Comment: It's not a good game for Fiorentina.\n35:27 Comment: It's not a good game for Sampdoria.\n35:29 Comment: It's not a good game for them.\n35:31 Comment: It's not a good game for the fans.\n35:37 Comment: It took a while to get it going in the first half.\n35:39 Comment: First 30 minutes or so were pretty dull.\n35:43 Comment: I have to say nothing really happened.\n35:48 Comment: Milicic is going to come off.\n35:50 Comment: Salah who's going off.\n35:56 Comment: The goals at this point for Montella.\n36:0 Comment: Salah a bit of a breather.\n36:3 Comment: With ten minutes to go.\n36:5 Comment: Milicic can pluck something out of mid-air.\n36:10 Comment: It's been used rather sparingly.\n36:12 Comment: Milicic not too often in the league.\n36:16 Comment: A little more so in the Italian Cup\n36:19 Comment: and in the early stages of the European rounds.\n36:23 Comment: There's a player who flat

    "summary": "The match between Juventus and Fiorentina at the Juventus Stadium promised to be an enthralling encounter, and it did not disappoint. Juventus managed to edge a tightly contested game with a 3-2 victory, which was characterized by some exquisite play and critical moments that turned the tide in favor of the home side.\n\nThe game kicked off with Sol Llorente deputizing for Alvaro Morata in the Juventus lineup, pairing up front with Carlos Tevez. Tevez had just recovered from a stomach bug that had kept him out of training for a week. At the back, Andrea Barzagli stepped in for the suspended Leonardo Bonucci, lining up alongside Giorgio Chiellini, forming a defensive partnership that also included the experienced Stephan Lichtsteiner and Patrice Evra on the flanks. In midfield, Claudio Marchisio, Andrea Pirlo, and Stefano Sturaro took charge of the proceedings.\n\nFiorentina, on the other hand, adopted a 3-5-2 lineup featuring Neto in goal, with a defensive trio comprised of Gonzalo Rodriguez, Stefan Savic, and José Basanta. Joaquin and Marcos Alonso operated as wide players, supporting initial attacks down the flanks. Up front, Mario Gomez was accompanied by the ever-dangerous Mohamed Salah, whose speed and skill had given Juventus trouble in the past.\n\nRight from the outset, it was clear that Fiorentina were determined to make their presence felt. Salah, recollecting his fond memories of scoring a remarkable goal at this stadium, looked proactive. The early exchanges saw both sides trying to assert control, with pressing play and quick transitions. A promising attack came in the first few minutes as Salah showed his pace, almost finding Mati Fernandez with a clever pass that was just too quick to be read.\n\nJuventus, however, were calculated in their responses, often absorbing pressure before launching swift counter-attacks. The home side, with their usual confidence, looked to their midfield maestros Pirlo and Marchisio to orchestrate moves, although finding clear chances proved difficult against a well-organized Fiorentina defense. Fiorentina had come into the match off the back of three consecutive losses, leading them to be highly motivated and focused.\n\nSeveral interceptions and tactical battles in the midfield showcased both teams' tactical discipline. The first significant breakthrough came from Fiorentina in the 33rd minute. A moment of carelessness from Pirlo resulted in Joaquin being tripped inside the penalty area, earning Fiorentina a penalty. Gonzalo Rodriguez stepped up to take the spot-kick and confidently dispatched it past Buffon, giving Fiorentina a 1-0 lead.\n\nThe lead awakened Juventus, who immediately sought to respond. Just minutes later, a foul on Sturaro presented Pirlo with an opportunity to deliver a trademark free-kick into the box. He delivered a precise ball that found Llorente, who expertly headed it past Neto to equalize in the 36th minute. Juventus had restored parity just two and a half minutes after conceding, underscoring the resilience and fighting spirit of the reigning Serie A champions.\n\nThe game then opened up more as both teams engaged in a fast-paced encounter. Fiorentina nearly retook the lead when Alonso and Salah orchestrated a neat one-two, which led to a sharp cross that narrowly missed its mark. Juventus, however, had other ideas. Moments before the half-time whistle, Carlos Tevez, who had been relatively quiet up till then, displayed his striking prowess. Tevez managed to stay onside and drilled a low shot underneath Neto to give Juventus a 2-1 lead heading into the break. It was a clinical finish from Tevez, showing why he is regarded as one of the best forwards in world football.\n\nThe second half began with Fiorentina needing to claw their way back into the match. They almost did just that when Salah once again terrorized the Juventus defense with his pace and movement, but his efforts couldn't find the back of the net. The game continued its back-and-forth nature. Juventus missed another chance to extend their lead when Neto pulled off a fantastic save to deny Evra's header.\n\nFiorentina then gained another golden opportunity to level the score. Joaquin again was the man causing problems for the Juventus defense. His jinking run led to another penalty as he was again tripped inside the box. Gonzalo Rodriguez, who had confidently slotted away Fiorentina's first penalty, stepped up once more. However, this time, his effort lacked the same composure and he blasted the ball wide, much to the relief of the Juventus faithful and the dismay of the Fiorentina bench.\n\nThis missed opportunity seemed to deflate Fiorentina somewhat, and Juventus capitalized. Just a few minutes later, in the spirit of punishing mistakes, they extended their lead. A well-weighted pass from Marchisio found Tevez, who made no mistake, tucking the ball low past Neto for his second of the night. With his goal tally now at 20 for the season, Tevez further demonstrated his importance to the Juventus side.\n\nWith the scoreline at 3-1, Fiorentina attempted to rally, but their efforts were increasingly disjointed. Montella made several substitutions, bringing on players like Alberto Gilardino and Borja Valero to inject some fresh energy into the side, but Juventus' defense stood firm. A late flurry saw Fiorentina pull one back in the 90th minute through Josip Ilicic, who struck a beautiful free kick past Buffon. Despite this, they were unable to muster another, leaving the final score at Juventus 3, Fiorentina 2.\n\nThe standout moments of the match included two crucial penalties awarded to Fiorentina, which resulted in contrasting outcomes that dictated the flow of the game. Rodriguez's initial successful penalty temporarily gave Fiorentina the lead, but his miss for the second was costly. In sharp contrast, Tevez capitalized on his opportunities, scoring twice with ice-cool precision.\n\nOverall, the game showcased the quality and resilience of Juventus. Amid tactical battles and moments of individual brilliance, they managed to secure a vital win that edges them closer to yet another Serie A title. Meanwhile, Fiorentina's inability to convert key chances and their continued penalty woes exposed an area that they will need to address moving forward. The match provided a thrilling spectacle for fans, filled with drama, skill, and crucial turning points."
