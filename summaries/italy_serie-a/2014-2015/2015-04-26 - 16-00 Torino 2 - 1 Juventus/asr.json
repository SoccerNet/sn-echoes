Comment: Darmian couldn't take it in his stride!\n44:11 Comment: But he scored! Nobody came in on Darmian.\n44:15 Comment: Well, I thought that Buffon would come out,\n44:17 Comment: and they found an equaliser, Torino.\n44:21 Comment: Darmian's first touch was way too heavy,\n44:23 Comment: expected somebody to come in,\n44:25 Comment: but he was all clear in front of Buffon.\n44:27 Comment: He's prodded it home.\n44:29 Comment: Torino right back in it here.\n44:31 Comment: 45 minutes gone.\n44:36 Comment: A strange goal.\n44:42 Comment: Let's see it again.\n44:44 Comment: Fogliarella did it.\n44:46 Comment: He did the right thing, but nobody came out.\n44:48 Comment: And Darmian, look, the heaviest of touches,\n44:50 Comment: but Bellucci was on the line instead of coming out to mark the ball.\n44:58 Comment: So, Samp just allowing Torino back in.\n45:2 Comment: He knew he'd overplayed it,\n45:4 Comment: but then all of a sudden he just found himself in front of goal.\n45:6 Comment: Fogliarella, Fogliarella, Fogliarella!\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Darmian. Now no changes have been made by either\n0:4 Comment: Ciampiero Ventura or Massimiliano Allegri, but we saw a couple of players warming up\n0:10 Comment: especially from Juve. Tevez was running about, he's on the bench of course and\n0:15 Comment: could well be used in the last half an hour of the match. He wasn't at his best\n0:21 Comment: in midweek.\n0:30 Comment: The final of the match is that promises to be. But back to the Turin derby, Torino\n0:37 Comment: bringing it back. They looked a little bit beaten after that goal went in.\n0:44 Comment: Darmian's effort from nowhere really restoring confidence.\n0:51 Comment: Morata penalized once again for a foul. Pulling Maksimovic back, here by the arm you can see.\n1:0 Comment: What a frustrating afternoon Morata hasn't really impressed.\n1:4 Comment: Pagliarella on the other hand has played extremely well. Opening up for Darmian once again trying\n1:9 Comment: to go inside Licksteiner.\n1:11 Comment: Pagliarella tries to take the throw.\n1:18 Comment: It's not an e-gloose for Darmian.\n1:22 Comment: It's Pagliarella.\n1:25 Comment: The X of the match.\n1:30 Comment: Straight into the hands for J.J. Bouffant.\n1:33 Comment: Spent a few seasons at Juventus before moving to Torino.\n1:37 Comment: Was largely out of favour in the third and final season of Antonio Quinte as Andrea Pirlo\n1:46 Comment: brings this ball forward.\n1:47 Comment: Pereira was in great control from Pereira.\n1:51 Comment: Bonucci wins the challenge with Pagliarella.\n1:56 Comment: Inside to Pirlo.\n1:59 Comment: Quickly forward to Matri.\n2:2 Comment: Finds Morata.\n2:3 Comment: Again Maksimovic.\n2:5 Comment: Very good marking on Morata.\n2:8 Comment: Here's Pereira.\n2:10 Comment: Gets the ball in the middle.\n2:11 Comment: It's come to Vidal.\n2:14 Comment: He prefers to square it to Padouin.\n2:17 Comment: Padouin's cross.\n2:18 Comment: Towards Vidal who was making the run into the box.\n2:24 Comment: Not too many runs being made by the midfielders so far in the last two games.\n2:29 Comment: Nice match of Vidal.\n2:30 Comment: Spuraro keeping things pretty tidy in midfield without bursting forward too much.\n2:36 Comment: Morata once again.\n2:41 Comment: Unable to really bring that ball under control.\n2:43 Comment: Here's Pirlo.\n2:48 Comment: Pagliarella.\n2:53 Comment: The other X moved from Torino to Juve for 15 minutes.\n2:58 Comment: For 50 million euros now as Lichsteiner wants the throw himself.\n3:4 Comment: I think he will get it.\n3:5 Comment: Or Pagliarella possibly just tipping the ball out of play.\n3:12 Comment: Not much movement for Lichsteiner.\n3:15 Comment: Now Spuraro coming forward.\n3:17 Comment: There you can see Cavalitos-Terres warming up.\n3:22 Comment: Pirlo.\n3:24 Comment: Forward to Matri.\n3:26 Comment: Cuts it back.\n3:27 Comment: Morata was at the far post, not the near post.\n3:30 Comment: Bonucci.\n3:31 Comment: Vidal.\n3:36 Comment: Leaves it for Pirlo.\n3:38 Comment: Just rolls the ball.\n3:40 Comment: Here's Matri once again.\n3:42 Comment: And he's committed the foul.\n3:45 Comment: Alessandro Matri.\n3:48 Comment: In his second spell at Juve.\n3:51 Comment: Controllable hand with his arm.\n3:55 Comment: And he's committed the foul on the click.\n4:6 Comment: The referee Tagliavento did well in the first half I think.\n4:10 Comment: Just let it flow.\n4:12 Comment: Didn't whistle too often.\n4:15 Comment: Despite the protest of the players.\n4:18 Comment: Kept the match running.\n4:20 Comment: Didn't get interrupted too much.\n4:23 Comment: Lol.\n4:28 Comment: Wissured freekick.\n4:30 Comment: Entry football player, Lich прокum.\n4:32 Comment: But it may be more for San riotano though he's not coming in for the poster.\n4:34 Comment: Small mistake there.\n4:36 Comment: No changeup now.\n4:37 Comment: Here's Lughdal.\n4:40 Comment: Now look how Martri wants to

Comment: he's over hit the cross and he's over hit the cross and he's over hit the cross\n5:44 Comment: a little bit but comes back to Matri Matri with a great delivery headed out\n5:49 Comment: by Moretti and then El Caduri Licksteiner onto Pierlo and that's another free kick from Gazzi on Pierlo\n5:59 Comment: fabulous first touch from Andrea Pierlo once again\n6:3 Comment: he just does that well\n6:10 Comment: this is another opportunity because we saw Pierlo strike the\n6:14 Comment: and now another opportunity and there's Abel on the right hand and\n6:17 Comment: Abel as longer as this was paintball to Asằler\n6:21 Comment: therefore Abel on the left hand\n6:24 Comment: decision and the hand is close to drawing off the upright from this kind of\n6:27 Comment: it is laughable with hope for such a\n6:31 Comment: range against Monaco in midweek and hit\n6:35 Comment: the Corneur of the crossbar and the\n6:38 Comment: upright\n6:43 Comment: Here he goes.\n6:49 Comment: He's gone for the power.\n6:50 Comment: He struck the upright.\n6:52 Comment: Incredible free kick again from Pirlo.\n6:56 Comment: But this time denied by the woodwork.\n6:59 Comment: Padelli completely frozen.\n7:4 Comment: Look at that.\n7:5 Comment: Just the outside.\n7:7 Comment: Padelli says, well, nothing I can do about that.\n7:10 Comment: He was rooted to the spot, the goalkeeper.\n7:13 Comment: And Pirlo, piece of magic this time.\n7:18 Comment: He hit through the ball and it takes that weird, awkward swerve\n7:24 Comment: that the goalkeepers cannot really read.\n7:29 Comment: He almost found goal number two.\n7:32 Comment: Don't give away any more free kicks on the edge of the box.\n7:35 Comment: That's the rule for Torino.\n7:36 Comment: Torino.\n7:40 Comment: It's Pereira who stayed down.\n7:43 Comment: And Pereira over.\n7:43 Comment: Vidal.\n7:45 Comment: It's difficult to see from up here.\n7:49 Comment: And it's Vidal who got caught by El Cadury.\n7:55 Comment: And he's running around in some agony as you get to see the wonders of\n8:2 Comment: Pereira's free kick ability once again.\n8:6 Comment: But as you certainly went for power, struck it so well.\n8:9 Comment: That would have been another beauty had it gone in.\n8:13 Comment: Just inches away.\n8:16 Comment: Vidal's back on his feet.\n8:18 Comment: Touched on by Morata here.\n8:22 Comment: Piero with a header.\n8:29 Comment: Brought out by Dick.\n8:31 Comment: And a free kick.\n8:33 Comment: But it seems as if Scudaro got the ball on this occasion.\n8:42 Comment: Free kick.\n8:44 Comment:

free kick for Juve.\n9:4 Comment: But Pellucci once again a little bit slow in coming out on Darmian's run.\n9:9 Comment: There's a bouffant.\n9:11 Comment: Goes over jokingly.\n9:12 Comment: Pellucci.\n9:15 Comment: Darmian, of course.\n9:19 Comment: But it looks to be in a little bit of pain here.\n9:22 Comment: Darmian.\n9:23 Comment: Not getting up.\n9:27 Comment: And the touch, Pellucci.\n9:29 Comment: Almost came.\n9:30 Comment: Richsteiner left it.\n9:35 Comment: Managed to get his body in the way this time there.\n9:38 Comment: Richsteiner.\n9:39 Comment: It's the second

Agostino\n10:47 Comment: Lichkana out to Padoin\n10:49 Comment: we don't see much of Padoin out on the left hand side\n10:53 Comment: doesn't tend to get forward very much\n10:55 Comment: prefers just to hold his position\n10:59 Comment: Ogbonna this time giving the ball away\n11:2 Comment: could be owned by Maxi Lopez\n11:4 Comment: but Pinochi just putting up an out-of-play\n11:7 Comment: has to get quickly back though for the quick throw\n11:9 Comment: Torino do not take.\n11:17 Comment: Nice now.\n11:19 Comment: Looks to switch play.\n11:21 Comment: And Caduri is there.\n11:23 Comment: Play

This victory held immense significance, not just for its impact on the Serie A standings but for the historical context, as this win marked Torino's first in the Turin derby against Juventus since 1995.\n\nThe match kicked off with Juventus gaining early possession, their lineup featuring an unusual pairing of Alvaro Morata and Alessandro Matri. This decision by coach Massimiliano Allegri was prompted by significant changes to squad tactics, utilizing Matri's experience and Morata's pace. Early on, an offensive spark flickered for Juventus with key player Andrea Pirlo orchestrating play, guiding Morata and Matri towards the goal.\n\nThe initial minutes showcased Juventus’ intent to wrap up the Scudetto. If they won and Lazio lost later, Juventus would secure the league title. However, Torino, driven by their passionate fans in a packed stadium, was not an easy opponent. Their five-man midfield, led by the experienced Gazzi and Benassi, worked diligently to disrupt Juventus' attacking flow.\n\nTorino’s defensive organization was impeccable, spearheaded by captain Kamil Glik and the adept Maksimovic. Juve’s initial attempts to breach the defense failed, with Morata and Matri often finding themselves muscled off the ball or thwarted by well-timed interceptions. A critical early opportunity for Juventus fell to Morata, who found himself unable to convert Pirlo's exquisite pass, his effort going over the bar.\n\nDespite Juventus dominating possession, Torino reminded them of their prowess in set-piece situations. El Kaddouri’s corner in the early stages created a surge of adrenaline in the stands, even though the effort ultimately did not find the back of the net due to Bonucci's solid clearance.\n\nTorino applied intermittent bursts of pressure, one notable opportunity seeing Fabio Quagliarella force a fine save from Gigi Buffon. Juve's legendary goalkeeper had to stretch fully to deny Quagliarella’s low strike following a clever assist from Maxi Lopez. This scare seemed to embolden Torino, who continued to probe Juventus' defense, particularly through Darmian and Peres, whose pace and crossing ability kept the defensive line on alert.\n\nJuventus didn't relent and soon were on the offensive again. A sublime ball over the top from Andrea Pirlo found Matri, whose control and subsequent shot, however, soared over the crossbar. Matri's frustration was evident as this clear chance to open the scoring slipped away. Juventus' persistent attempts to find the opener showcased the intricate link-up play between Pirlo, Sturaro, and Vidal, although a finish eluded them.\n\nAs the half wore on, Juventus eventually broke the deadlock. In the 35th minute, Pirlo converted a free-kick from just outside the box in spectacular fashion. His delicately placed shot, curling over the wall and dipping under the crossbar, left Padelli rooted to the spot. The goal was a testimony to Pirlo's exceptional talent and highlighted why he’s revered in world football. For a moment, Juventus was ascendant, seeking to capitalize on their lead by maintaining possession and frustrating Torino.\n\nHowever, Torino displayed resilience and tactical nous. Right before halftime, they leveled the score, thanks to Darmian's effort. In the 45th minute, Quagliarella’s vision and accurate pass found an unmarked Darmian, whose initial heavy touch seemed to squander the chance. Nevertheless, an unanticipated defensive lapse from Bonucci allowed Darmian to recover and prod the ball past Buffon. The equalizer right before the break injected a fresh lease of life into Torino's already vibrant performance.\n\nThe second half commenced with both teams making no immediate changes, though Juventus had several high-profile players warming up, including Carlos Tevez. Torino maintained their form, driven by the equalizing goal at the end of the first half.\n\nThe half began with a determined Juventus trying to reestablish their lead. Pirlo was, once again, central to Juve's play, directing traffic and facilitating forward movements. Yet, Torino remained steadfast, epitomized by Maksimovic's robust marking of Morata and Peres' quick recoveries in defense.\n\nIt was only a matter of time before Torino fully turned the tide. In the 57th minute, a well-coordinated attack culminated in a cross from Darmian, finding Quagliarella in an opportune position. Quagliarella, showing the finesse of a seasoned striker, calmly placed the ball past Buffon. He displayed respect by not celebrating against his former club, but Torino fans erupted in jubilation as their team seized the lead.\n\nThe Torino defense, buoyed by the goal, displayed increased vigilance. Any Juventus advance was promptly addressed, especially through Glik’s commanding presence at the back. Juventus introduced Carlos Tevez for Morata, hoping the talismanic forward could inject the much-needed spark.\n\nThe game's intensity remained high as Juventus relentlessly sought an equalizer. A Pirlo free-kick, once again, nearly found the back of the net, the ball grazing the upright and highlighting Torino’s thin margin for error. Allegri's side saw a barrage of efforts, including shots from Arturo Vidal and headers following some precise crosses from Tevez.\n\nDespite Juventus' pressure, Torino remained composed under Padelli's careful guardianship. Periodic breaks by Torino threatened to extend their lead, especially through the energetic Martinez, who replaced Maxi Lopez, and Bruno Peres. The introduction of Pepe and Llorente from the Juventus bench introduced further layers to their attack strategy, but also transformed the game into a fascinating chess match of tactics and endurance.\n\nAs the clock ticked down, anxiety grew among the home fans, matched by the urgency in Juventus’ play. Key moments included a point-blank save by Padelli from Sturaro’s header, a dramatic strike by Lichsteiner hitting the post, and constant incursions into Torino's box.\n\nIn the dying minutes, Juventus’ frustration seemed to reach a tipping point. Bonucci picked up a yellow card for dissent, signaling a broader disquiet within the team. Torino, on their part, smartly managed the clock, with substitute Molinaro playing a key role in running down time and drawing fouls.\n\nThe final whistle prompted an explosion of emotions from the Torino faithful, as their team secured a historic 2-1 victory. This win was not just a triumph over a formidable opponent but a celebration of resurgent pride and belief within the team and its supporters. For Juventus, the defeat served as a reminder that amidst their domestic dominance, every opponent remains a challenge capable of denting their aspirations, even if only for a day."
