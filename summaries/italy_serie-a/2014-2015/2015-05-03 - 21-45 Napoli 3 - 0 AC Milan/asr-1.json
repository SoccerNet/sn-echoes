Surely that's a penalty.\n0:42 Comment: Yes, indeed. Disastrous start for AC Milan.\n0:45 Comment: 43 seconds on the clock.\n0:48 Comment: Di Siglio bringing down Hamsik, and it's ascending off.\n0:53 Comment: A red card for Di Siglio.\n0:59 Comment: Well, it goes from bad to worse for AC Milan.\n1:2 Comment: It really does.\n1:3 Comment: It's been a terrible season.\n1:5 Comment: And Mattia Di Siglio, after 43 seconds...\n1:10 Comment: ...has been sent off for a challenge as the last man.\n1:14 Comment: Well, I've got to say, I feel a bit for Di Siglio.\n1:16 Comment: I feel the penalty is probably enough punishment.\n1:20 Comment: Hamsik was clearly through on goal.\n1:23 Comment: But a penalty...\n1:27 Comment: ...is almost a goal in itself now in Zaghi.\n1:31 Comment: I must be thinking...\n1:33 Comment: ...even luck is against his side.\n1:38 Comment: Di Siglio in just his fourth game of 2015.\n1:41 Comment: He's been injured so often.\n1:44 Comment: And again...\n1:46 Comment: ...proving that...\n1:49 Comment: ...that his level of maturity...\n1:51 Comment: ...hasn't really reached the heights that they were expecting at the club.\n1:56 Comment: It's a little bit harsh, but it was a rash challenge.\n2:0 Comment: Di Siglio has been sent off after 43 seconds.\n2:4 Comment: Higuain has the chance to give Napoli the lead.\n2:7 Comment: It's as if Napoli started with a one-goal lead.\n2:11 Comment: Milan started with a one-goal handicap, if you like.\n2:14 Comment: And a ten-man handicap.\n2:19 Comment: Higuain, then, from the penalty spot.\n2:21 Comment: Drama early, early on here.\n2:24 Comment: Diego Lopez...\n2:26 Comment: ...who produced some miracle saves in the...\n2:30 Comment: ...reverse fixture in the first half of the season.\n2:35 Comment: Can he do the same here?\n2:38 Comment: But Milan are going to have to play the entire game.\n2:41 Comment: And it's a very close game.\n2:46 Comment: But Milan are going to have to play the entire match...\n2:49 Comment: ...with one man less.\n2:51 Comment: Higuain, then, from the penalty spot...\n2:54 Comment: ...to make it 15... 16, excuse me...\n2:57 Comment: ...in Serie A.

It was a good height...\n3:35 Comment: ...but it still had some power behind it.\n3:38 Comment: Higuain, then...\n3:40 Comment: ...missing the opportunity...\n3:44 Comment: ...to take his tally to 16 for the season.\n3:47 Comment: It's Napoli, though, on the attack. It's not going to be an easy match at all...\n3:51 Comment: ...for Milan, considering their defensive frailties anyway.\n3:55 Comment: It's a corner kick and Napoli on the attack.\n4:3 Comment: A side that has let in 46 goals all season.\n4:6 Comment: 42, excuse me.\n4:13 Comment: Cajon, lofting this one high and long.\n4:16 Comment: It's going to be picked up by David Lopez.\n4:23 Comment: Made forward by Goulam to Hamsik.\n4:28 Comment: Well, early chance squandered.\n4:32 Comment: But it's going to be 90 minutes of...\n4:35 Comment: ...pure suffering, I feel, for Milan.\n4:39 Comment: And Zagid really must be thinking...\n4:41 Comment: ...what does he have to do...\n4:43 Comment: ...to go his way a little bit anyway...\n4:46 Comment: ...and for things to go his side's way...\n4:50 Comment: ...being called into question so often...\n4:54 Comment: ...over the course of the season.\n5:0 Comment: Alex.\n5:5 Comment: Milan instantly losing possession.\n5:12 Comment: Here's Insigne. Alex sliding in.\n5:15 Comment: And then Van Dinkel.\n5:20 Comment: But just a destro. So isolated already up front.\n5:25 Comment: Milan on the back foot. The only way I can see Milan...\n5:28 Comment: ...really coming into this match...\n5:31 Comment: ...is if Napoli just take their eye off the ball...\n5:34 Comment: ...and let complacency come into play.\n5:37 Comment: Being a man up, Hamsik's shot is more of a...\n5:41 Comment: ...pass to Insigne, who's taken on Pagli.\n5:45 Comment: And Higuain, not quite sure what he was attempting on that occasion.\n5:55 Comment: Napoli had such a good opportunity...\n5:58 Comment: ...against Empoli to really close the gap on...\n6:2 Comment: ...third place to Roma it was at the time.\n6:5 Comment: Now Roma have leapt above Lazio to really close the gap.\n6:11 Comment: To that third place and really put those two Roman clubs...\n6:15 Comment: ...under some serious pressure.\n6:18 Comment: But they fell quite comprehensively as well to Empoli.\n6:23 Comment: It was a bit of an onslaught at one stage.\n6:29 Comment: And now I guess the aim is really just to consolidate...\n6:32 Comment: ...that fourth place.\n6:35 Comment: There's always an outside chance of a top three finish.\n6:38 Comment: And it's a foul for Rafa Benitez's men...\n6:41 Comment: ...just as it was for...\n6:45 Comment: ...oh, here we're seeing the save again.\n6:48 Comment: Struck with some power.\n6:51 Comment: That is a fine, fine save even though it was the right height.\n6:54 Comment: But it certainly wasn't down the middle.\n6:57 Comment: And this was the penalty appeal.\n7:1 Comment: Well, I can't really see how you can complain about the foul...\n7:4 Comment: ...but you've got to feel for someone who gets sent off...\n7:7 Comment: ...after 40 seconds of play.\n7:14 Comment: It's not the first time he's been sent off this season, Vasilio.\n7:22 Comment: Benitez trying to hold on to possession a little bit.\n7:25 Comment: It's nicely played by Honda.\n7:33 Comment: Now forward Honda towards Destro.\n7:36 Comment: And Uhar...\n7:39 Comment: ...had to get down quickly.\n7:45 Comment: Honda was sent off in the match against Torino on the...\n7:49 Comment: ...10th of January.\n7:52 Comment: Just the second match of the new year.\n7:55 Comment: Joins Bonera on a two-sending off.\n7:59 Comment: But this one really takes the biscuit, I think.\n8:2 Comment: I'm not sure the last time a player was sent off...\n8:5 Comment: ...within the first minute of play.\n8:14 Comment: Insigne.\n8:26 Comment: I can say that Insigne is now...\n8:29 Comment: ...back to full fitness.\n8:35 Comment: I was talking about Napoli's position in the table...\n8:38 Comment: ...but saying, of course, that Napoli also in the...\n8:41 Comment: ...Europa League semi-finals may have a chance...\n8:44 Comment: ...if they win it, to go into next season's Champions League.\n8:50 Comment: Just as Fiorentina do, of course, who are also in the semi-finals.\n8:53 Comment: The winner of this year's Europa League will have the chance...\n8:56 Comment: ...of going through to the Champions League.\n9:0 Comment: They either go through to the preliminary rounds...\n9:3 Comment: ...or directly through to the group stages, depending on who...\n9:6 Comment: ...and where they finish.\n9:9 Comment: This was the save again from Diego Lopez.\n9:12 Comment: David Lopez, of course, on the midfielder for Napoli.\n9:16 Comment: Not to be confused.\n9:19 Comment: Here's Honda.\n9:22 Comment: They've really got to find their fighting spirit to AC Milan...\n9:25 Comment: ...which is what has been lacking in recent matches.\n9:28 Comment: That's a terrible ball inside by Bocchetti.\n9:32 Comment: Just his fourth start.\n9:40 Comment: And his first since the 2018 World Cup.\n9:43 Comment: And he's got a good start.\n9:47 Comment: And his first since the 28th of February.\n9:50 Comment: Bocchetti has been used very, very despairingly...\n9:53 Comment: ...by Pipo Inzaghi.\n9:59 Comment: A bit of turmoil, of course, going on at AC Milan...\n10:2 Comment: ...with all the talk about Perlusconi selling up.\n10:5 Comment: Recent reports say that he wants to keep the majority share...\n10:8 Comment: ...and he wants to sell a part of it...\n10:11 Comment: ...just to get an influx of cash...\n10:15 Comment: ...to be able to spend on the side, shall we say.\n10:22 Comment: Get back to the glory days of AC Milan.\n10:28 Comment: The second successive season.\n10:31 Comment: The club are facing the prospect of no European football next year.\n10:38 Comment: Hamsek.\n10:41 Comment: Challenged by Van Ginkel.\n10:45 Comment: And Destro just couldn't quite take the ball away from Hamsek.\n10:49 Comment: Good battling by Van Ginkel.\n10:54 Comment: Here's David Lopez.\n10:57 Comment: And again, Jorginho.\n11:9 Comment: Forward to Higuaín, who nods it down nicely.\n11:12 Comment: And again, it's a bit of a struggle for the centre.\n11:16 Comment: Bocchetti with the header away.\n11:21 Comment: Free kick goes AC Milan's way.\n11:25 Comment: A bit of a breather.\n11:28 Comment: They're going to have to take them when they can, these breathers.\n11:31 Comment: It's going to be fairly relentless, I imagine, from Napoli.\n11:42 Comment: Now to Bocchetti.\n11:45 Comment: Now Paletta.\n12:0 Comment: Milan, the last five meetings played in Naples.\n12:4 Comment: Both sides have scored goals.\n12:7 Comment: It's an average of 3.8 in these games.\n12:10 Comment: Napoli are unbeaten in their last seven league fixtures here at the San Paolo.\n12:13 Comment: It's a bit of play, though.\n12:16 Comment: And a shot straight at the hands of Andaljara,\n12:20 Comment: who made it look easy.\n12:23 Comment: But it was a powerful shot.\n12:26 Comment: And a rare opportunity for Milan,\n12:29 Comment: who, despite being a man down,\n12:32 Comment: is showing some spirited performance at the moment.\n12:36 Comment: That came in from Bonaventura.\n12:40 Comment: Here's Pogli.\n12:43 Comment: Giving it away to Insigne.\n12:46 Comment: One back, though, by Honda.\n12:49 Comment: Honda with the cross.\n12:52 Comment: Well, unfortunately, there was nobody covering the back post for Milan.\n13:3 Comment: For Napoli, I'm not sure if it's such a good thing\n13:7 Comment: that they do have a man up for the entire match.\n13:10 Comment: Because they could just relax a little bit too much,\n13:13 Comment: thinking they can take it easy.\n13:16 Comment: Higuain trying to go around Paletta.\n13:19 Comment: Still in possession.\n13:23 Comment: Higuain away by Pogli.\n13:26 Comment: De Jong on to Honda.\n13:29 Comment: Especially having missed the penalty.\n13:32 Comment: Had they been one nil up,\n13:35 Comment: they would have been in the final.\n13:38 Comment: Here's David Lopez.\n13:42 Comment: Jorginho goes back to Bulan.\n13:45 Comment: And again, Jorginho.\n13:48 Comment: Over the top towards Insigne, but far too long.\n13:51 Comment: That's going to be the goal kick.\n13:54 Comment: 14 minutes on the clock.\n13:58 Comment: If you miss the first 10,\n14:1 Comment: well, it all happened in the first minute of play.\n14:5 Comment: Hamsik burst through, was clear on goal.\n14:8 Comment: Taken out by de Silliot.\n14:11 Comment: Penalty given by the referee.\n14:14 Comment: De Silliot shown a red card after 40 seconds of play.\n14:17 Comment: 43, according to my stopwatch anyway.\n14:21 Comment: Milan down to 10 men.\n14:24 Comment: But then Higuain saw his penalty saved\n14:27 Comment: by Diego Lopez.\n14:30 Comment: Hamsik from distance over the top.\n14:34 Comment: And is this further bad news for Milan?\n14:37 Comment: There's a player down.\n14:40 Comment: It looks to be Bonaventura who fell awkwardly on his back.\n14:57 Comment: Can't afford any injuries.\n15:1 Comment: Pippo Inzaghi.\n15:5 Comment: Oh, Milan. Bonaventura stayed down.\n15:8 Comment: Took a bit of a hit, has to be said.\n15:15 Comment: Milan, who have won only one of their last 12 away games.\n15:18 Comment: They've drawn six and lost five.\n15:21 Comment: Unbowed world coming into this game here.\n15:25 Comment: What is quite a warm evening in Naples.\n15:28 Comment: Bonaventura is going to have to shoulder on.\n15:31 Comment: Inzaghi is going to tell him to do everything he can\n15:35 Comment: to keep playing.\n15:38 Comment: I'm sure he'll be straight back on though.\n15:55 Comment: Diego Lopez.\n15:59 Comment: With the kick then.\n16:2 Comment: Momentarily down to nine men.\n16:5 Comment: Milan, well Bonaventura trots back on to the pitch.\n16:8 Comment: Here's Maggio.\n16:11 Comment: Jorginho.\n16:15 Comment: Forward to Hamsik, gets it back.\n16:18 Comment: Swears it to David Lopez.\n16:22 Comment: Now Goulam.\n16:25 Comment: Most of the match going to be played inside AC Milan's half.\n16:28 Comment: Most of the possession is going to be controlled\n16:31 Comment: by the team in the sky blue shirt.\n16:35 Comment: At the moment.\n16:38 Comment: The away side are holding up fairly well.\n16:41 Comment: Maggio.\n16:44 Comment: Forward to Brown.\n16:48 Comment: Maggio.\n16:51 Comment: That's a silly foul to commit by the Dutchman.\n16:55 Comment: Insignia now.\n16:58 Comment: There's Honda in front of him.\n17:1 Comment: Jorginho.\n17:4 Comment: Square to Albiol.\n17:7 Comment: Everybody forward for Napoli.\n17:11 Comment: That's a short ball from Maggio.\n17:14 Comment: Surely that is obstruction as well.\n17:18 Comment: Now, there's Puketti running down the flank.\n17:21 Comment: Fair play.\n17:24 Comment: Puketti at the pace.\n17:27 Comment: I'm not quite sure what Alex was\n17:30 Comment: signaling over there.\n17:34 Comment: Hopefully not to the bench for a change.\n17:37 Comment: That's the last thing Insigne needs.\n18:14 Comment: That wasn't controlled by Pauly.\n18:20 Comment: Puketti just hoisting it up.\n18:23 Comment: That will go out of play no doubt.\n18:27 Comment: Destron unable to keep it on.\n18:44 Comment: Jorginho goes back to Raul Albiol.\n18:53 Comment: That's David Lopez.\n18:56 Comment: Brings Albiol forward.\n19:14 Comment: Maggio.\n19:16 Comment: Just trying to play it forward to Hamsek.\n19:19 Comment: A little bit too predictable though from the home side.\n19:22 Comment: Paletta just clears it.\n19:37 Comment: Albiol forward.\n19:40 Comment: Hamsek, that's a lovely ball.\n19:43 Comment: Into the cross.\n19:46 Comment: Insigne missed the volley.\n19:49 Comment: He waited and waited.\n19:53 Comment: But then picked out his man.\n19:56 Comment: The eventual shot coming from Goulam.\n19:59 Comment: Diego Lopez just calling for his players to calm down.\n20:2 Comment: Here it was.\n20:5 Comment: It was a great cross though.\n20:9 Comment: Insigne possibly just took his eye off the ball\n20:12 Comment: Harder for him.\n20:28 Comment: A flick from Destron.\n20:31 Comment: That's a lovely touch.\n20:34 Comment: Hamsek, then forward to Insigne.\n20:38 Comment: He's beyond his man Pauly.\n20:41 Comment: He's right back.\n20:49 Comment: The referee has given a free kick in a very dangerous position here.\n20:56 Comment: It's a position where Insigne can attempt a shot on goal.\n21:11 Comment: Right foot of his.\n21:14 Comment: Two-man wall for AC Milan.\n21:17 Comment: Everybody out there defending.\n21:21 Comment: As I said, Pauly basically has moved back into the position.\n21:24 Comment: Vacated by Desiglia after the sending off.\n21:27 Comment: Now opportunity to swing this ball in dangerously towards goal by Insigne.\n21:30 Comment: Is he going to go for goal?\n21:33 Comment: No. He cuts the ball across for Keahon.\n21:37 Comment: But it's not a great pass.\n21:40 Comment: Keahon was really expecting it either.\n21:43 Comment: And Pauly has won the throw in as well.\n21:46 Comment: Good battling by Pauly.\n21:50 Comment: Britos.\n21:53 Comment: Across to Bulan.\n21:57 Comment: Now Albiol.\n22:0 Comment: Jorginho.\n22:3 Comment: Clemens.\n22:6 Comment: And now it's a free kick.\n22:9 Comment: It's a free kick.\n22:17 Comment: Jorginho.\n22:20 Comment: Plenty of space for him to look up and move into.\n22:23 Comment: But his pass, a dreadful one again.\n22:26 Comment: Jorginho easily cut out now.\n22:29 Comment: Destro unable to really hold on to possession.\n22:33 Comment: Needs to do a bit better than that.\n22:36 Comment: Destro to help out his side.\n22:39 Comment: Really needs to produce a fabulous performance this evening.\n22:42 Comment: Milan are going to get something from this match.\n22:45 Comment: Flicked on.\n22:49 Comment: Buonaventura is chasing this one down.\n22:52 Comment: But it goes all the way back to Andujar.\n22:56 Comment: Albiol out wide to Bulan.\n22:59 Comment: He leaves it for Jorginho.\n23:2 Comment: And the Milan players just waiting.\n23:5 Comment: Oh, and Napoli at the moment it's a tackle.\n23:8 Comment: And it's a tackle.\n23:34 Comment: A bit too slow.\n23:37 Comment: And a bit too predictable as well.\n23:43 Comment: Nether back from Honda.\n23:50 Comment: Boxed in, Boli, Aleta.\n23:53 Comment: bit of breathing space for Milan.\n23:55 Comment: Chieti can bring the ball forward.\n23:58 Comment: Finds Bonaventura.\n24:2 Comment: Surrounded by players, Bonaventura\n24:5 Comment: needs Destro to really show himself,\n24:8 Comment: to really want that ball.\n24:10 Comment: The movement from Destro has to be\n24:13 Comment: spot on.\n24:15 Comment: It wasn't on that occasion.\n24:20 Comment: Free kick goes Milan's way.\n24:23 Comment: A foul committed by David Lopez.\n24:41 Comment: He made the early run and\n24:43 Comment: would have received the ball now.\n24:45 Comment: Bonaventura is just going to swing this one in and hope\n24:48 Comment: in an attempt to get something from these\n24:51 Comment: situations.\n24:52 Comment: Well, it's a corner kick.\n24:56 Comment: Another Deadpool situation then.\n24:58 Comment: Swinging at some pace.\n25:0 Comment: Handed out by Maggio.\n25:5 Comment: 25 minutes played.\n25:7 Comment: 0-0 between Napoli and Milan.\n25:9 Comment: But I remind you, Napoli have missed the penalty.\n25:13 Comment: Higuain.\n25:15 Comment: Penalty actually was taken on three minutes of play.\n25:22 Comment: All lining up in a row, the Milan players.\n25:26 Comment: A new tactic.\n25:28 Comment: Towards Alex, it was close.\n25:31 Comment: Oli picks up the loose ball.\n25:34 Comment: Taking on Jorginho.\n25:38 Comment: Payamont unable to keep it in play.\n25:52 Comment: A foul committed.\n25:54 Comment: Another free kick.\n25:56 Comment: All the visitors.\n25:58 Comment: Bonaventura going to ground.\n26:0 Comment: This time it's Rafa Benitez.\n26:2 Comment: Just looking at the situation.\n26:4 Comment: It's a free kick.\n26:20 Comment: Just looking for these free kicks.\n26:22 Comment: Which of course they are.\n26:24 Comment: That's the aim now for Milan.\n26:26 Comment: To win free kicks high up the field.\n26:29 Comment: Get these dead ball situations working for them.\n26:41 Comment: A moment.\n26:42 Comment: All offside.\n26:45 Comment: Higuain a little bit too low.\n26:47 Comment: Hamzik with the header out.\n26:51 Comment: And the ball goes straight out of play.\n26:54 Comment: Needs a slightly better delivery from Bonaventura next time.\n26:58 Comment: Floated in a bit further on.\n27:0 Comment: Mantua goes back to Albiol.\n27:10 Comment: Milan back to Maritos.\n27:12 Comment: Forward to Albiol.\n27:14 Comment: David Lopez out.\n27:16 Comment: To Goulam.\n27:18 Comment: To Gritos.\n27:20 Comment: Albiol.\n27:22 Comment: Here's Mantua.\n27:24 Comment: Too much movement ahead of him.\n27:26 Comment: As the forwards just wait for the ball.\n27:28 Comment: For Napoli.\n27:44 Comment: Callejon.\n27:47 Comment: Jorginho.\n27:56 Comment: Cross is a good one.\n27:58 Comment: Towards Higuain.\n28:0 Comment: Paleta with the header out.\n28:2 Comment: It's going to be a corner kick now for Napoli.\n28:5 Comment: Higuain.\n28:11 Comment: And Sini goes over to the corner flag to take.\n28:25 Comment: He's taking it short to Cajon.\n28:27 Comment: Who squares it.\n28:29 Comment: Over the top.\n28:31 Comment: Higuain didn't quite work from Napoli.\n28:35 Comment: Albiol spreads it wide to Cajon.\n28:38 Comment: Cajon inside the box.\n28:40 Comment: Here's Gritos.\n28:42 Comment: They're all still up there from the corner kick.\n28:44 Comment: But no cross has come in.\n28:46 Comment: And the one that does eventually from Insigne.\n28:48 Comment: Way, way too over hit.\n28:51 Comment: Went straight out of play.\n28:55 Comment: Not quite sure what the whole corner kick was about there.\n29:6 Comment: Goal kick then from Diego Lopez.\n29:12 Comment: Won by David Lopez.\n29:14 Comment: Given back by Van Ginkle who lost possession.\n29:19 Comment: De Jong doing well.\n29:22 Comment: Here's Bonaventura.\n29:24 Comment: It's not a good ball but Alex is there.\n29:27 Comment: Goes back to the back.\n29:29 Comment: Under pressure.\n29:31 Comment: So is Pauly.\n29:33 Comment: Has to go down the line.\n29:37 Comment: Van Ginkle.\n29:39 Comment: That's going to be a throw to Napoli.\n29:47 Comment: David Lopez.\n29:51 Comment: In the corner.\n29:53 Comment: And it's a goal.\n29:55 Comment: David Lopez.\n29:58 Comment: In Maggio.\n30:0 Comment: A touch by Maggio.\n30:2 Comment: Allows Puchetti to get the challenge in.\n30:5 Comment: Bonaventura to clear.\n30:7 Comment: Still not away though.\n30:9 Comment: As Destro is fouled.\n30:14 Comment: Jorginho.\n30:16 Comment: That's what Destro needs to do really.\n30:18 Comment: Win as many of these fouls as possible.\n30:25 Comment: In Signe now.\n30:27 Comment: He's come on this side of the pitch.\n30:29 Comment: On the right hand side for a moment.\n30:31 Comment: Swapping with Callejon.\n30:33 Comment: Here's Goulam.\n30:35 Comment: Here's Callejon at the other end.\n30:37 Comment: And he's got a chance.\n30:39 Comment: He's got a chance.\n30:53 Comment: Callejon at the other end.\n30:55 Comment: Just to try and mix things up for Napoli.\n30:58 Comment: Hamsik checks back.\n31:0 Comment: Callejon.\n31:2 Comment: Gets the 1-2.\n31:4 Comment: So it's over hit by Jorginho.\n31:7 Comment: And Napoli struggling to break down this\n31:10 Comment: organised Milan defence.\n31:12 Comment: At least for now after half an hour gone.\n31:14 Comment: Initially seemed as if it was going to be\n31:17 Comment: an onslaught from the home side.\n31:19 Comment: But hasn't really materialised so far.\n31:21 Comment: Certainly possession very much in favour of the home team.\n31:25 Comment: But as for chances on goal,\n31:28 Comment: we haven't seen Diego Lopez tested too often.\n31:33 Comment: Penalty kick aside of course.\n31:40 Comment: Insigne checks back as well.\n31:42 Comment: Looking for support which he finds with David Lopez.\n31:45 Comment: Out to Callejon.\n31:51 Comment: Once again intercepted.\n31:53 Comment: The ball played forward by Jorginho.\n31:56 Comment: Milan can't keep hold of the ball though.\n32:0 Comment: Very difficult indeed.\n32:11 Comment: Made wide.\n32:13

control the ball.\n32:57 Comment: Paleta read it.\n32:59 Comment: Sliding challenge was a good one.\n33:1 Comment: Over the top.\n33:2 Comment: Paleta!\n33:3 Comment: And he missed out as Higuaín got fooled by the fact that Paleta\n33:7 Comment: had stretched out his leg.\n33:11 Comment: Probably thought the defender was going to get the ball.\n33:14 Comment: And I saw it just squirmed away from

Lopez.\n34:9 Comment: Mancho.\n34:15 Comment: Senior back to David Lopez.\n34:17 Comment: An early ball forward but Bonaventura with some fine work at the back.\n34:23 Comment: Defending really well.\n34:25 Comment: Very vigilant at the moment AC Milan.\n34:27 Comment: Very spirited display so far.\n34:30 Comment: Much better than we've seen in recent matches from them.\n34:38 Comment: Goulam's cross.\n34:40 Comment: Cleared by Pocchetti who's under no pressure.\n34:45 Comment: Jorginho.\n34:46 Comment: It's all Napoli of course in terms of possession.\n34:49 Comment: It's just a

He knew that Destro had the last touch.\n36:15 Comment: Just a person speaking.\n36:17 Comment: Destro does not look particularly fit to me.\n36:21 Comment: He looks sharper than he does at the moment.\n36:28 Comment: He's carrying a kilo or two too many.\n36:30 Comment: That's a nice ball forward.\n36:31 Comment: Hamsik steps away from one challenge.\n36:34 Comment: Couldn't find Higuain

moves from the San Paolo Stadium.\n37:51 Comment: And that's a good ball to Destro.\n37:57 Comment: All played in.\n37:58 Comment: The header!\n37:59 Comment: Oh, it struck the upright from Bonaventura.\n38:2 Comment: How close was that?\n38:4 Comment: Milan coming so close to making it 1-0.\n38:10 Comment: And silencing the San Paolo off the upright.\n38:15 Comment: Fabulous header.\n38:17 Comment: Well, that's unlucky.\n38:18 Comment: Really unlucky.\n38:36 Comment: That one's too long for Maggio.\n38:48 Comment: Diego Lopez then with the goal kick.\n38:52 Comment: We're approaching the last five minutes of the half.\n38:55 Comment: It's been a tense first half here.\n38:57 Comment: Hasn't been great football by any means.\n39:0 Comment: But Milan have shown plenty of heart in senior league.\n39:3 Comment: They've been very good.\n39:6 Comment: And they're going to be very good in the second half.\n39:14 Comment: But Milan have shown plenty of heart in senior.\n39:17 Comment: It could be through here.\n39:18 Comment: Oh, he's dragged the shot woefully wide.\n39:24 Comment: Napoli have really struggled to break down the defence.\n39:29 Comment: In a way, it's worked against the home side,\n39:32 Comment: this one-man advantage.\n39:35 Comment: And although Milan have really found it difficult\n39:39 Comment: to get out of their own half,\n39:41 Comment: they have come closest, other than the penalty, of course,\n39:44 Comment: to scoring with Bonaventura.\n39:51 Comment: And Dinkl down to Pali.\n39:54 Comment: Pali can get it beyond Keihaan, and that's a free kick.\n40:8 Comment: Maggio.\n40:11 Comment: David Lopez to Jorginho.\n40:23 Comment: He's got a bit of room here, Jorginho.\n40:25 Comment: Gets it back from Insigne.\n40:28 Comment: Higuain asking for the ball.\n40:32 Comment: Instantly found a little bit quicker Higuain.\n40:35 Comment: The cross comes in.\n40:37 Comment: It's cut out by Alex.\n40:41 Comment: It's quite a handball from Pali.\n40:45 Comment: It did look as if he touched it with his arm.\n40:48 Comment: Ulam taking on Pali once again.\n40:52 Comment: Insigne couldn't find the one-two.\n40:55 Comment: And Dinkl on the edge of the box gets a lucky touch,\n40:59 Comment: but Napoli have it back here.\n41:1 Comment: And Dinkl working hard.\n41:2 Comment: Here's Insigne.\n41:3 Comment: Insigne gets a poor pass.\n41:6 Comment: Bonaventura has been the best player on the field\n41:10 Comment: on both sides, I think.\n41:12 Comment: Doing really well.\n41:14 Comment: Kitty taking a bit too much of a risk there.\n41:16 Comment: Making up for it with this line-in challenge on Jorginho.\n41:21 Comment: Can't afford to give it away in that kind of position.\n41:27 Comment: Higuain, spreading play out to Ulam.\n41:31 Comment: Keihaan now.\n41:38 Comment: Keihaan again.\n41:41 Comment: Jorginho just tapping it back to Alpiol.\n41:45 Comment: That's a poor pass again by David Lopez.\n41:49 Comment: Fortunately for him, it wasn't intercepted by Honda.\n41:52 Comment: Now, Hamsik.\n41:53 Comment: Poor control from Hamsik, but he gets it back as De Jong\n41:56 Comment: didn't really read the fly to the ball.\n41:59 Comment: And the shot going just wide from Hamsik.\n42:6 Comment: Went through De Jong's legs and he blasted it, Hamsik,\n42:9 Comment: but well wide.\n42:16 Comment: Napoleon needs to learn to keep his arms down.\n42:19 Comment: Not naturally, of course, a right back.\n42:23 Comment: Used to playing in that position, but...\n42:30 Comment: Licked on by De Jong.\n42:31 Comment: Goes back to Andujar.\n42:36 Comment: Alpiol.\n42:42 Comment: Hamsik.\n42:44 Comment: Forward to Higuain.\n42:48 Comment: And Kimpo can get the challenge in on that.\n42:51 Comment: Higuain has found

Comment: Bocchetti, should I say.\n43:18 Comment: Insigne, he's lost out.\n43:20 Comment: Insigne could be through here.\n43:22 Comment: Higuain, Higuain goes for the turn up with the left,\n43:25 Comment: but he's hit it high.\n43:31 Comment: Bocchetti, that's the second time he's lost possession\n43:34 Comment: in that position.\n43:36 Comment: It's a very dangerous position to lose the ball.\n43:39 Comment: As we saw, Insigne scurried away.\n43:44 Comment: And luckily, Higuain, luckily for Milan, Higuain\n43:48 Comment: Skyder shot.\n43:54 Comment: Insigne, heading it down.\n43:56 Comment: Hamsik brings Madrou into play.\n43:59 Comment: Madrou keeping this ball in.\n44:0 Comment: He's got some space actually.\n44:1 Comment: Plays a good ball in, which I think Alex managed to header out\n44:6 Comment: following Higuain all the way.\n44:12 Comment: Yes, it was.\n44:13 Comment: A bit of a clutch ahead, I think, as well, between the two.\n44:18 Comment: Good defending, though, by Alex.\n44:23 Comment: Corner kick, which Lorenzo Insigne is ready to take.\n44:32 Comment: Cajon, swings one in, out by Paletta.\n44:37 Comment: Ulam.\n44:41 Comment: Higuain with the

    "summary": "On a warm evening at the San Paolo Stadium, Napoli delivered a commanding performance, thrashing AC Milan 3-0 in a match that will be remembered for its early drama and critical moments throughout. Both teams entered the clash eager to bounce back from disappointing midweek fixtures, making the encounter crucial for their respective campaigns.\n\nThe game kicked off with Napoli immediately going on the offensive, a trait characteristic of Rafael Benitez’s preferred 4-2-3-1 formation. Milan, led by Pippo Inzaghi, also employed an attacking 4-3-3 formation with Giacomo Bonaventura and Keisuke Honda supporting Mattia Destro up front.\n\nJust moments into the game, Napoli was awarded a penalty when Marek Hamsik was brought down inside the box by AC Milan’s Mattia De Sciglio after only 43 seconds. The referee had no hesitation in pointing to the spot and subsequently showed De Sciglio a red card, reducing Milan to ten men in what was a disastrous start for the visitors. Gonzalo Higuain stepped up to take the penalty, but Milan’s goalkeeper, Diego Lopez, pulled off a remarkable save to deny the Argentine, keeping the score level at 0-0 despite the early setback.\n\nDespite the numerical advantage, Napoli struggled initially to break down Milan’s defense. Milan, on the other hand, faced an uphill battle to hold off the relentless pressure from the home side. Hamsik featured prominently, combining well with Lorenzo Insigne and Jose Callejon, but opportunities to score were few and far between. \n\nNapoli dominated possession, using their extra man effectively to stretch the Milan defense, with David Lopez and Jorginho pulling the strings in midfield. However, Ivan Strinic, along with the Milan defenders Alex and Gabriel Paletta, showed incredible resilience and made crucial interceptions to prevent Napoli from capitalizing on their dominance.\n\nMilan managed sporadic counterattacks, with Destro often isolated upfront but working hard to provide a target for long balls and flick-ons. One of their best opportunities came when Bonaventura’s powerful header struck the upright, a moment that almost tilted the game momentarily in Milan’s favor. This rare chance spurred Milan on but also served as a warning for Napoli who needed to capitalize on their man advantage.\n\nNapoli began the second half with intent, determined to break the deadlock. Despite the numerical disparity, Milan continued to defend robustly with De Jong and Van Ginkel battling hard in midfield to disrupt Napoli’s rhythm. The introduction of Dries Mertens added more dynamism to Napoli’s attacks, and the Belgian immediately made an impact, probing down the flanks and linking up well with Higuain and Hamsik.\n\nFinally, Napoli’s persistence paid off in the 70th minute when Marek Hamsik unleashed a precise and powerful low drive from the edge of the box. The ball zipped past Diego Lopez who was screened by his own defenders, giving Napoli the deserved lead. The goal ignited the San Paolo Stadium, and the Napoli players sensed blood.\n\nMilan’s resilience started to crumble, and Napoli wasted no time in exploiting the cracks. Just four minutes later, Hamsik turned provider, delivering a delightful pass to Mertens. The Belgian forward showcased his skill by cutting inside Milan’s defense and threading a perfectly weighted ball to Higuain. The striker, who missed the penalty earlier, fired home from close range to make it 2-0 and finally notch his 16th league goal of the season.\n\nNapoli’s second goal broke Milan’s spirit, and the floodgates opened. In the 76th minute, Gabbiadini, who had been a consistent threat since coming on, added a third. Following a slick move involving Insigne and Mertens, Gabbiadini displayed his poaching instincts by latching onto a loose ball inside the box, smashing it into the net to put the game beyond any doubt.\n\nThe closing stages of the match saw Napoli comfortably control the game, knowing victory was assured. In contrast, Milan's earlier resolve started to wane as fatigue and frustration took their toll. Benitez took the opportunity to give some of his younger players a run-out, including Sebastiano Luperto, who made his Serie A debut. Meanwhile, for Milan, it was a dismal end to a match that originally held fleeting promise.\n\nThe 3-0 defeat leaves Milan languishing in mediocrity, with the prospect of European football next season growing increasingly unlikely. Questions about the future of the club, ownership issues, and Inzaghi’s tenure as manager continue to loom large. For Napoli, the win solidifies their position in the league and boosts their morale as they continue their fight for a Champions League spot.\n\nThe comprehensive victory serves as a testament to Napoli’s attacking prowess and resilience, emphasizing the tactical discipline enforced by Benitez. Despite a rocky start, the team’s ability to remain patient and clinically execute their game plan ultimately secured them the much-needed three points.\n\nAs the final whistle blew, the fans at San Paolo were left celebrating a crucial win off the back of a compelling performance. The match, marked by its early drama and decisive second half, will go down as a memorable night for the home fans and a challenging day for AC Milan's faithful supporters."
