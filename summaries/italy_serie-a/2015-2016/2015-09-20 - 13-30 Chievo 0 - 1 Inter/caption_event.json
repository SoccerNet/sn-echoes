    "summary": "The match between Chievo and Inter was a spectacular display of football, marked by excitement and intensity from the first whistle to the last. The game, held at Stadio Marc'Antonio Bentegodi, saw Inter clinch a narrow 1-0 victory over Chievo in a closely contested encounter.\n\n### First Half\n\nThe action commenced with Chievo taking the kick-off. Almost immediately, the ball was played out of bounds leading to a throw-in by Chievo. In response to this early possession, Chievo delivered the first shots on target. The early minutes saw a mix of play styles with both teams struggling to gain a toehold.\n\nAs the game progressed, Inter started to find their rhythm. A significant moment came at 10:07 when Valter Birsa took a free kick from 27 meters out, only for it to be blocked by Inter's well-positioned defensive wall. The blocked kick fell to Chievo's attackers who forced a shot on target. The first few minutes truly showcased Chievo's intent to press high and capitalize on set-pieces.\n\nInter retaliated soon with a few palpitating sequences. They earned a free-kick post a foul by Chievo and took an indirect free kick which did not lead to anything significant. However, Inter's strategy seemed clear — possess and control the game through orchestrated teamwork. Yet, for all their possession, Inter saw several attempts result in shots off target or being comfortably dealt with by the Chievo defense.\n\nAround 14:55, Inter's passing display was impressive as they sought to break down the opposition with quick, incisive movements. Their control over the ball was growing as they attempted to stretch Chievo's defense. Not too long after, Inter earned a free kick through a foul by Lucas Castro, indicating their steady commandeering of the gameplay.\n\nThe minutes ticked by with both sides struggling to dominate the game outright. Chievo attempted to creat their chances through counter-attacks and brave shots. A series of corner kicks followed without any decisive conclusion. Inter handled most of these set-pieces reasonably well. \n\nBy the 20th-minute mark, the contest swung back and forth with neither side able to convert their half-chances. The action was riveting as both teams recorded shots, although many went off target. Inter showed a flair for long-range efforts but often lacked the precision to beat the Chievo goalkeeper.\n\nAn electric moment arrived at 26:45 when Fredy Guarin of Inter was shown a yellow card for a hard tackle. As the game veered towards the close of the first half, tensions were palpable. Chievo too collected a couple of yellow cards, highlighting the aggressively competitive nature of the match.\n\nThe decisive breakthrough came just before halftime at 41:04. An impressive team move led by Inter culminated with Mauro Icardi pouncing on a loose ball inside the box. He struck a well-placed shot into the right post, eluding the Chievo goalkeeper. This gave Inter a crucial 1-0 lead. Inter sealed the first half with a combination of solid defensive work and moments of attacking brilliance.\n\n### Second Half\n\nThe second half began with Inter taking the kick-off. Chievo sought immediate retribution but faced a disciplined Inter defense that stifled their advances effectively. The tempo of the game was relentless with both sides trading possession and testing each other’s defences continuously.\n\nInter had their tactical setup on display, especially across set-pieces. They earned several corners and attempted to capitalize on them but couldn't find the net past Chievo’s vigilant defense. Chievo, on their part, were no slackers either, answering with their corner kicks, albeit met with strong resistance from Inter’s defenders.\n\nAround the 22-minute mark of the second half, a critical moment came when Jeison Murillo from Inter picked up a knock and was unable to continue. Inter made a substitution, bringing on Andrea Ranocchia for Murillo, and also Rodrigo Palacio for Stevan Jovetic. Chievo seemed to have sensed an opportunity but struggled to fully exploit the change.\n\nRoberto Inglese replaced Alberto Paloschi for Chievo around the same time, signaling a strategic shift aimed at breaking Inter’s defense. Both managers were quick to adapt and make changes to reinvigorate their teams.\n\nThe match was marked by frenetic running, pressing, and numerous fouls, with each tackle and interception laden with intensity. Chievo continued to press for an equalizer, and at times came tantalizingly close. Inter, on the other hand, were resolute in defending their slender lead, even as they pursued additional goals to seal the game.\n\nSimone Pepe was substituted onto the pitch for Chievo, another attempt to add fresh legs and attacking prowess. They created opportunities but found it difficult to penetrate Inter's compact lines. Likewise, Inter's substitution strategy was evidenced as Marcelo Brozovic came on for Geoffrey Kondogbia, signaling their intent to maintain control in the midfield.\n\nDespite valiant efforts from Chievo, their shots were either off target or stymied by resolute defending and quick reflexes from Inter's goalkeeper. Massimo Gobbi of Chievo earned himself a yellow card towards the end, reflecting Chievo's increasing frustration and desperation.\n\nAs the clock wound down, the game entered a nail-biting phase with Chievo's all-or-nothing pushes met by Inter’s contained play. The Inter defense held firm, cutting out key passes and clearing the ball effectively.
