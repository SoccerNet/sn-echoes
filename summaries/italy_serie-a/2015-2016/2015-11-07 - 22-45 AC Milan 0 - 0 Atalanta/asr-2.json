they are\n6:2 Comment: trying to make the interception\n6:3 Comment: and just doesn't time it to\n6:4 Comment: perfection and.\n6:6 Comment: It allows this chance here.\n6:8 Comment: You see Roman Yoli thinks he has\n6:9 Comment: the step but he just misjudges.\n6:11 Comment: The flight of that pass.\n6:13 Comment: Into Pena then he cuts inside\n6:14 Comment: he's got an option there.\n6:16

Comment: Good stuff.\n6:45 Comment: To Chertchik again isolated.\n6:49 Comment: But on a switch to the inside to\n6:50 Comment: cover.\n6:51 Comment: Boots got towards the goal line\n6:53 Comment: whips it all the way across and.\n6:56 Comment: Just a little too much\n6:57 Comment: adrenaline on that one.\n7:2 Comment: Always a.\n7:3 Comment: Derisive cheer when someone\n7:5 Comment: slips and stumbles.\n7:7 Comment: And finale.\n7:8 Comment: The victim this time.\n7:11 Comment: That's exactly what Mihajlovic\n7:12 Comment: wants to see.\n7:14 Comment: That's what Sunni says all about.\n7:16 Comment: Work right from every single one\n7:18 Comment: of these players he wants his\n7:19 Comment: winners to come back and help\n7:20 Comment: out.\n7:21 Comment: On the defensive end it has to\n7:23 Comment: be a team effort.\n7:24 Comment: In terms of.\n7:25 Comment: Tracking back and closing down\n7:27 Comment: the opposition limiting.\n7:28 Comment: Their time on the ball.\n7:35 Comment: Taken away.\n7:36 Comment: Grassi a little bit more of an\n7:37 Comment: interior role today off to\n7:39 Comment: Morales.\n7:41 Comment: And to Gomez.\n7:42 Comment: She got E.\n7:43 Comment: With Maxi on the flank.\n7:45 Comment: Back to Gomez he's got a cannon\n7:46 Comment: but.\n7:47 Comment: The aim just a bit of ride\n7:49 Comment: tried to curl it in instead it\n7:51 Comment: went wide.\n7:51 Comment: It was a poor ball from coach\n7:53 Comment: got that set up this play on the\n7:54 Comment: short field from Atlanta just\n7:56 Comment: essentially giving it away\n7:58 Comment: inexcusable from you and I\n7:59 Comment: coach got.\n8:1 Comment: And Papu Gomez sees all of his\n8:2 Comment: options Pena wanting the ball\n8:4 Comment: placed inside the box a bit\n8:6 Comment: selfish that time for Papu\n8:7 Comment: Gomez from a standstill\n8:9 Comment: position.\n8:10 Comment: Very difficult to beat on the\n8:12 Comment: room.\n8:13 Comment: Curling attempt from there.\n8:14 Comment: Bursting forward from his\n8:16 Comment: center back spot.\n8:17 Comment: Taken away by new line but given\n8:19 Comment: right back.\n8:20 Comment: On a.\n8:21 Comment: His pass goes away and now a\n8:22 Comment: burst of speed from Baca.\n8:25 Comment: Cuts away from Paleta.\n8:27 Comment: Grassi on his heels tries to\n8:28 Comment: drive in.\n8:30 Comment: Until all way back in time.\n8:34 Comment: Or the veteran.\n8:36 Comment: Spent some time at Roma.\n8:39 Comment: So follow player.\n8:40 Comment: Just on the outskirts of the\n8:41 Comment: national team but.\n8:44 Comment: Very solid in setting up.\n8:53 Comment: How they're doing it.\n8:54 Comment: This is not a lot to team\n8:55 Comment: material that's only scored 13\n8:56 Comment: goals in 11 games it's defense.\n8:59 Comment: That's been giving them points.\n9:2 Comment: Almost sneaking it through the\n9:3 Comment: play.\n9:4 Comment: Nexus.\n9:7 Comment: To leave or draws the foul.\n9:11 Comment: You know I wonder about this\n9:12 Comment: current Milan unit without one\n9:13 Comment: of them and put in a bit of the\n9:14 Comment: last few.\n9:15 Comment: Really stepped up his form who's\n9:16 Comment: going to play those good balls.\n9:18 Comment: To the forward men.\n9:19 Comment: So far we're seeing in Baca\n9:21 Comment: trying to track back get\n9:22 Comment: involved.\n9:23 Comment: In the build up play but.\n9:25 Comment: Other than Montolivo don't\n9:26 Comment: really have a natural passer of\n9:28 Comment: the ball.\n9:28 Comment: In the midfield Paulie a lot\n9:30 Comment: more.\n9:30 Comment: Of a workhorse along with\n9:32 Comment: Kuchka.\n9:35 Comment: And that was the problem last\n9:36 Comment: season under inside is the.\n9:38 Comment: Relative lack of service that\n9:40 Comment: the Milan got.\n9:41 Comment: Oftentimes they have to be\n9:42 Comment: Jeremy Mena's just creating\n9:44 Comment: opportunities for himself.\n9:49 Comment: To the area laid off nicely\n9:51 Comment: Chigurhini thought he had more\n9:52 Comment: time.\n9:53 Comment: Bundled over.\n9:55 Comment: Looking for a foul but not\n9:56 Comment: going to get it.\n9:58 Comment: Let's go all the way back now\n10:0 Comment: bursting forward.\n10:1 Comment: Stripped away by Cherchey.\n10:3 Comment: Or from Cherchey.\n10:5 Comment: Made off for Gomez.\n10:7 Comment: With defense by the home.\n10:9 Comment: Down goes Morales.\n10:11 Comment: Grassi gets the pass away.\n10:13 Comment: And.\n10:14 Comment: The.\n10:17 Comment: Flat footed against the.\n10:19 Comment: Hinson in the corner.\n10:20 Comment: It will be a throw in but it's\n10:22 Comment: deep.\n10:23 Comment: Don't be surprised if Atlanta\n10:24 Comment: presses.\n10:25 Comment: Opening 10 minutes and not\n10:26 Comment: Atlanta's look the better side\n10:27 Comment: sending men forward.\n10:29 Comment: Holding on to a majority of the\n10:30 Comment: possession and not giving me on\n10:32 Comment: any time to.\n10:33 Comment: Really build up any semblance.\n10:35 Comment: Of fluid play so far.\n10:38 Comment: He can take others forward as\n10:40 Comment: long as he's not at the plate.\n10:46 Comment: Make.\n10:46 Comment: Back.\n10:47 Comment: Baca.\n10:49 Comment: To leave他們歪點\n10:50 Comment: popped up on him.\n10:54 Comment: Putting on push cut.\n10:55 Comment: To the playmaker.\n10:57 Comment: Not quite the pure loan rule but.\n10:59 Comment: The Hailuva is just like Steve\n11:0 Comment: Hall.\n11:1 Comment: As a touch player in the center.\n11:4 Comment: Supported by Pushka and Pauly\n11:6 Comment: today as you mentioned.\n11:8 Comment: a little bit more push up front\n11:10 Comment: and keep out a lot to honest.\n11:20 Comment: Back up.\n11:22 Comment: Did not hang on.\n11:23 Comment: Hopefully Paleto.\n11:25 Comment: To get in.\n11:26 Comment: Gomez with a nice touch for Grame.\n11:29 Comment: Got away from him.\n11:31 Comment: And it's tackled up by Mexes.\n11:33 Comment: Off with him in a clash.\n11:36 Comment: And out it goes.\n11:36 Comment: That's a second quality tackle from Philip Mexes.\n11:40 Comment: Maybe a bit worried if you're a Milan fan,\n11:42 Comment: how will his game form be?\n11:43 Comment: As he's only played a few minutes this entire season.\n11:47 Comment: But so far it looks very sharp.\n11:50 Comment: Problem with Mexes is sometimes he'll just lose his head\n11:52 Comment: and allow players to instigate\n11:56 Comment: and he'll get caught up in it.\n11:57 Comment: But when he stays away from all that Phil,\n12:0 Comment: he really can be a fine defender on his day.\n12:7 Comment: Trying to get that,\n12:8 Comment: Ce was.\n12:9 Comment: Looking for it now.\n12:18 Comment: And seeing the plow still no goals.\n12:23 Comment: Me having to.\n12:25 Comment: Grab one ball.\n12:26 Comment: The yellow.\n12:28 Comment: Hasn't bothered that much.\n12:31 Comment: Slaps it away and out for the Me campaign.\n12:36 Comment: But they're actually going to jump into fourth place.\n12:40 Comment: They need a swing of 14 goals to do it at the early part.\n12:43 Comment: But we were talking about in the pregame, Matteo,\n12:47 Comment: it's amazing the turnaround from Mihailovic.\n12:51 Comment: I think the one thing he's drilling into this team as well\n12:53 Comment: is the trip down can be even faster\n12:56 Comment: if they don't stay focused.\n12:57 Comment: Absolutely, still think it has to do\n12:59 Comment: with the tactical switch from Mihailovic.\n13:1 Comment: He only really had a few months to work with the squad\n13:4 Comment: and he was insistent, Phil, on this 4-3-1-2\n13:7 Comment: that used the tre cuartista.\n13:8 Comment: And I think he realized about a month into the season\n13:11 Comment: that he didn't really have that playmaker\n13:13 Comment: to link the midfield with the attack that's\n13:15 Comment: needed in a narrow formation like that.\n13:18 Comment: So he scrapped it.\n13:18 Comment: He stopped using Suso and Kishke Honda.\n13:21 Comment: And he brought in Cherchi to add a 4-3-3\n13:23 Comment: and move Ponaventura back to the left, a position\n13:26 Comment: that he played with Atalanta, actually.\n13:30 Comment: Ponaventura unavailable today against his old side,\n13:32 Comment: and suspended.\n13:34 Comment: Vasi putting it out for the Milan throw.\n13:37 Comment: Menez, Balotelli, Abate, Bertolacci all injured,\n13:41 Comment: as is Diego Lopez.\n13:43 Comment: But it's a good man that already lost his spot\n13:46 Comment: to the 16-year-old.\n13:48 Comment: A little touch ice from Milan.\n13:50 Comment: Pope free as Pauly tries to track it down.\n13:55 Comment: Now, Lopez was not spectacular as the ball stays\n13:59 Comment: in play for Antonelli.\n14:3 Comment: Was he that bad that they decided\n14:6 Comment: to look for a 16-year-old?\n14:7 Comment: Or was that perhaps the best way for Mihailovic\n14:10 Comment: to wake everyone up?\n14:11 Comment: Cherchi sneaks it across the 6, cleared away Paleta.\n14:15 Comment: Never looks too comfortable on his weaker foot.\n14:17 Comment: Cherchi always likes to cut inside with that left foot.\n14:20 Comment: And that time stays to the outside.\n14:23 Comment: He has Baca, but he's well-covered.\n14:24 Comment: Baca inside the box.\n14:25 Comment: And he didn't have that much zip behind the pass either,\n14:29 Comment: Cherchi.\n14:30 Comment: Going back to your point, Phil, Diego Lopez\n14:32 Comment: has beaten at his near post one too many times\n14:34 Comment: for Mihailovic's liking.\n14:37 Comment: Still a very bold decision.\n14:39 Comment: Chance for Cherchi again set high.\n14:42 Comment: Settled inside the box by Grassi.\n14:44 Comment: And he has time to clear it away.\n14:47 Comment: Speaking of getting beat at their near post,\n14:49 Comment: Donnarumma actually has on two occasions\n14:52 Comment: so far since coming in.\n14:53 Comment: Remember the free kick from Berardi.\n14:57 Comment: Down by Baca.\n14:58 Comment: And also from the last week.\n15:5 Comment: However, at 16 and 6 for 5, he's learning and learning quickly.\n15:9 Comment: In fact, already called up to the under 21 Italian national\n15:14 Comment: team.\n15:15 Comment: Phil, there's always going to be\n15:16 Comment: crawling pains, a 16-year-old goalkeeper,\n15:18 Comment: a 20-year-old center back at Romagnoli.\n15:22 Comment: And then De Sillo feels like he's been around forever,\n15:24 Comment: but he's still only 23.\n15:25 Comment: So when you put in Donnarumma, you\n15:28 Comment: have to ride it with him in the consequences.\n15:31 Comment: That will come.\n15:31 Comment: And he will make the mistakes.\n15:34 Comment: It would be foolish to expect him\n15:35 Comment: to play at a consistently high level at his age\n15:40 Comment: with only three games of top flight experience.\n15:42 Comment: However, his grandfather, a goalkeeper,\n15:45 Comment: who trained him as a youngster since he was four,\n15:49 Comment: his older brother actually a professional as well at Genoa.\n15:52 Comment: Christian Pieres told us here, Phil,\n15:54 Comment: and even said it on air at BeInSports,\n15:56 Comment: that all talks coming out of Milan\n15:58 Comment: are saying that this kid, Donnarumma,\n16:0 Comment: is absolutely the real deal and that he's fantastic.\n16:5 Comment: Ball blasted by Antonelli.\n16:6 Comment: It's going to hold.\n16:7 Comment: Grassi pinning him down.\n16:8 Comment: Back to the youngster.\n16:10 Comment: Calm and cool.\n16:14 Comment: Headed straight back to Montevivo.\n16:18 Comment: Now Pauly sending it wide.\n16:20 Comment: And Liang is pinching to the inside as Baca went wide.\n16:25 Comment: Well-covered Duhon, 24-year-old,\n16:29 Comment: freshman from Heron fame.\n16:30 Comment: Solidifying factor in that Adelanto midfield.\n16:33 Comment: Cherchi surrounded by three.\n16:35 Comment: Drives on Drame, and it's out for the corner.\n16:39 Comment: Always so direct, Cherchi, looking\n16:40 Comment: to take on multiple defenders.\n16:42 Comment: And we've seen it a few times already,\n16:44 Comment: Baca and Liang interchanging positions with Liang,\n16:47 Comment: taking a more central role.\n16:51 Comment: That's the quality of Baca is that he can play with the ball\n16:53 Comment: at his feet, and he's definitely comfortable attacking\n16:56 Comment: the defense from a wide position.\n16:58 Comment: Swing and a low to the near post.\n17:0 Comment: Almost met perfectly, but Kuczka sees his try denied.\n17:6 Comment: It was a lot harder than it looked.\n17:12 Comment: And in the 18th minute, they'll try it again.\n17:14 Comment: This one more to the center.\n17:15 Comment: Cleared away.\n17:18 Comment: On the volley by Montolivo.\n17:20 Comment: Still in danger, though.\n17:22 Comment: Tugherini trying to get it out.\n17:24 Comment: Now Paletta, but only as far as Meksis.\n17:27 Comment: Bit surprised the goalkeeper, Sportello,\n17:28 Comment: didn't come out for that one.\n17:30 Comment: That stopped attempt.\n17:32 Comment: Against Meksis, who's trapped upfield,\n17:35 Comment: trying to take advantage, but only one man down.\n17:37 Comment: It's Morales.\n17:39 Comment: Back comes Pauly.\n17:41 Comment: Good one, Grassi.\n17:42 Comment: Clears some space.\n17:44 Comment: Back heel from Pena.\n17:46 Comment: And just too much on it.\n17:48 Comment: Milan dodging a bit of a bullet.\n17:49 Comment: Milan cuts through two.\n17:52 Comment: Now out wide.\n17:53 Comment: Baca again heading to the left.\n17:55 Comment: Tries to get around Toloi, but can't.\n17:58 Comment: End-to-end stop for Milan and Adelanto.\n18:0 Comment: Absolutely, just bypassing the midfield entirely,\n18:3 Comment: both these sides.\n18:5 Comment: It's fine work from Milan,\n18:6 Comment: always looking to take on the defender.\n18:8 Comment: He beats him with pace,\n18:9 Comment: and Baca's had the same success,\n18:12 Comment: trying to do the same thing.\n18:15 Comment: Player down behind the play.\n18:17 Comment: It's Bukhari-Drame.\n18:20 Comment: Take a look.\n18:21 Comment: Aye.\n18:22 Comment: Was in contact just as he lunged\n18:24 Comment: to try and get that ball away.\n18:27 Comment: At the last moment, something gave.\n18:29 Comment: I heard him saying,\n18:30 Comment: Cambio as well wants a change.\n18:34 Comment: Ex-PSG youth player, along with Charlie Davis,\n18:38 Comment: spent some time at Sochaux before moving to Chievo.\n18:42 Comment: Bit surprised Chievo let him go,\n18:43 Comment: but Adelanto glad to have him.\n18:45 Comment: But this is gonna be a bit of a blow,\n18:48 Comment: at least on the offensive side.\n18:50 Comment: Bellini is gonna check in.\n18:52 Comment: The veteran left back.\n18:56 Comment: Now 35 years of age, Adelanto through and through.\n19:1 Comment: But they're giving up some pace on the flank here, Mateo.\n19:3 Comment: Yeah, like for like,\n19:4 Comment: but you're losing a little bit going forward.\n19:8 Comment: Not the same defensively, but it's a pretty big loss.\n19:11 Comment: Drame always looking to push forward\n19:12 Comment: and add that width and combine with the forward men\n19:16 Comment: in Gomez and Maxi Morales.\n19:23 Comment: Alexis quickly going at Bellini,\n19:26 Comment: almost heads it by surprise.\n19:31 Comment: Got a start with Adelanto back in the mid 90s\n19:35 Comment: as a youth player, and he's been there ever since.\n19:42 Comment: Let's give you an idea.\n19:50 Comment: 14 coaches since Bellini first stepped in at Adelanto.\n19:59 Comment: Might be a cauldron that produces a ton of talent in Italy,\n20:2 Comment: but they like a different chef every so often.\n20:5 Comment: Yeah, and it's a tough one.\n20:7 Comment: It's a tough task for Raimondi every single time.\n20:10 Comment: He's just holding on to Nyang's shirt,\n20:13 Comment: knows that the second Nyang spins away, he's off.\n20:27 Comment: And he's got it.\n20:29 Comment: He's got it.\n20:36 Comment: Nyang sneaks it in.\n20:38 Comment: Vaka held his place on side,\n20:41 Comment: tries to cut back to his favoured right,\n20:43 Comment: drives it in, a slide to deny.\n20:46 Comment: It was Chigurhini stopping what would appear to be a certain goal.\n20:50 Comment: Wide for Cherchi.\n20:52 Comment: Now on his left, flipping it up, Nyang.\n20:55 Comment: And just wide of Vaka.\n20:57 Comment: Oh, what a pass.\n20:59 Comment: What a pass that would have been from Nyang.\n21:1 Comment: Excellent technique, but go back to that.\n21:4 Comment: That's a wonderful delivery from Nyang.\n21:7 Comment: Perfect through ball, releases Vaka.\n21:10 Comment: He knows it's a wide angle, so he cuts inside,\n21:13 Comment: although he did have two options inside the box.\n21:15 Comment: And how about that from Nyang looking for Vaka once again.\n21:20 Comment: So confident with the ball at his feet is the Colombian Carlos Vaka.\n21:24 Comment: He wasn't going to rush it in.\n21:26 Comment: He didn't like his options, so he cuts inside.\n21:29 Comment: And that one probably goal-bound\n21:32 Comment: had it not taken that deflection.\n21:34 Comment: Good ball from Cherchi on the follow-up,\n21:36 Comment: but it was also that little check back,\n21:38 Comment: putting his hip on the defender, staying on side by Vaka.\n21:42 Comment: And as you pointed out,\n21:44 Comment: there have not been a lot of players this season for Milan\n21:47 Comment: that would make that pass or could make that pass.\n21:50 Comment: Nyang proves he can.\n21:54 Comment: Cherchi with Bellini flying in.\n21:57 Comment: Strong challenge for the 35-year-old.\n22:1 Comment: There's one thing in the tale for Nyang.\n22:7 Comment: Mihailovic has already proved he's willing to stick with kids.\n22:14 Comment: Launched forward, but too far.\n22:16 Comment: Maleta must have hit a corner.\n22:20 Comment: Game over for Panama.\n22:22 Comment: Looking so good, even got some time on the national team.\n22:25 Comment: That's pretty well defended against Vaka.\n22:28 Comment: But when it got to Milan,\n22:30 Comment: there were more blunders than bright spots.\n22:35 Comment: Now sent away to Adelante.\n22:40 Comment: Swept free by Mungu.\n22:44 Comment: And now, there's a chance for Vaka.\n22:47 Comment: Swept free by Mungu.\n22:50 Comment: Grassi went down and a foul against Nyang.\n23:4 Comment: Young talent. Grassi also on the\n23:7 Comment: under-20 side for Italy.\n23:11 Comment: Maybe not quite the accolades that some of his counterparts have,\n23:15 Comment: but a good solid midfielder.\n23:21 Comment: Settled by the young 20-year-old.\n23:24 Comment: Maxey's dropped into the middle.\n23:26 Comment: They'll flip it back wide, but too far for Gomez.\n23:29 Comment: Five foot, what you'd say, generously five.\n23:33 Comment: Give him about 5'1\", 5'2\".\n23:35 Comment: Maxey and Alejo.\n23:38 Comment: Gomez, I think if you put them on each other's shoulders,\n23:41 Comment: they might be able to see Battletelli eye to eye.\n23:47 Comment: Vaka.\n23:48 Comment: Jeltshia.\n23:49 Comment: Cuts to his left, nice tackle.\n23:51 Comment: Bellini.\n23:52 Comment: They're going at the substitute, but he's responded.\n23:55 Comment: And now a foul from the CEO.\n23:58 Comment: And it looks like he's going in the book.\n24:0 Comment: It's a physical match. Players flying into the challenge.\n24:4 Comment: Only about 45 minutes in between these two cities.\n24:7 Comment: And every time they play together,\n24:9 Comment: it's always difficult against Atalanta.\n24:11 Comment: These players working so hard, physical defending,\n24:15 Comment: clattering into each other.\n24:19 Comment: There you see from the CEO going in.\n24:26 Comment: Starts up as well.\n24:29 Comment: Antelivo with a long switch.\n24:32 Comment: You can hear Sportiello out near the penalty spot\n24:35 Comment: screaming at his defense.\n24:37 Comment: Now up the line, no problem for Antonelli.\n24:43 Comment: Nice touch, Antelivo.\n24:47 Comment: Down the line, Leon.\n24:51 Comment: And now, the ball is in the hands of the ref.\n24:55 Comment: Down the line, Leon.\n24:58 Comment: A little stutter step creates some space.\n25:0 Comment: Lifting it in for Kuczka.\n25:2 Comment: But just missing the train at the station.\n25:4 Comment: Have to love the way Leon's playing so far.\n25:6 Comment: 25 minutes, he's been the player of the match for Milan.\n25:9 Comment: Every time he's on the ball, he's going by the defenders.\n25:12 Comment: He's looking to create, as well as have a go on target himself.\n25:18 Comment: Quite incredible when you think of\n25:20 Comment: him not even playing so far this season.\n25:23 Comment: Having a few injuries and looks right on form so far.\n25:32 Comment: Nice.\n25:33 Comment: Small frame, but he's got a can and lays it off here.\n25:36 Comment: Bellini rides the challenge of Cerci,\n25:39 Comment: swinging it across and smallest man on the park\n25:42 Comment: looks at the referee and says,\n25:43 Comment: Fouls on me?\n25:46 Comment: He's getting tangled.\n25:48 Comment: That's just a little nudge to\n25:51 Comment: San Antonelli tumbling.\n25:58 Comment: It's a big part of the success for Atalanta up front.\n26:1 Comment: The fact that he can play make and set up the main striker,\n26:5 Comment: either German, Danis or Pinilla.\n26:21 Comment: Grassi.\n26:23 Comment: Morales back.\n26:24 Comment: Heels on that right leg.\n26:28 Comment: Raimondi.\n26:29 Comment: Morales.\n26:31 Comment: Go back from Grassi.\n26:32 Comment: Looking comfortable.\n26:39 Comment: And also Matteo is,\n26:41 Comment: you take a look\n26:42 Comment: at the coefficients and\n26:44 Comment: the fact that Italy may be closing in on\n26:47 Comment: getting that fourth Champions League spot back.\n26:50 Comment: Driven down the line nicely for Bellini.\n26:54 Comment: Sneaks it past to Sio.\n26:56 Comment: Slashing run.\n26:57 Comment: Gomez.\n26:58 Comment: He's knocked down by Kuczka.\n27:1 Comment: And maybe thought a bit of a dive.\n27:3 Comment: Scooped by Montelino and\n27:5 Comment:

of Cherchi.\n27:28 Comment: Seems like he hasn't even lost the ball so far.\n27:30 Comment: Leon, every single thing he touches is turning into gold.\n27:34 Comment: Close to a foul here.\n27:36 Comment: Little bit of a barge.\n27:38 Comment: Just physical play from Montelino.\n27:41 Comment: Back to\n27:42 Comment: what he was going to say.\n27:43 Comment: Because of some of the economic issues.\n27:46 Comment: Semi unable to go out and buy the superstars.\n27:49 Comment: They had to\n27:50 Comment: start to grow their own again.\n27:53 Comment: Take a look here.\n27:54 Comment: For

the forward runs from those midfield players like Cigarini, like Martin Derun.\n31:21 Comment: Who can get forward and are comfortable taking a shot from in and around the box.\n31:27 Comment: They are sending plenty of players forward Atalanta when they're in possession.\n31:30 Comment: They're not just going to sit back and defend here at the San Siro.\n31:37 Comment: It's a rather offensive approach so far from Eddie Reya.\n31:40 Comment: He's seen this Milan defense and not totally convinced he knows they can be broken down.\n31:47 Comment: First match of the day saw Bologna with a 2-0 road win against Verona.\n31:56 Comment: Still looking for our first goal here just over Pania.\n31:59 Comment: Touched Bellini with a cannon that just goes wide.\n32:3 Comment: Donald Romas saw it

and goes right into the shit of Pania.\n33:15 Comment: Full force.\n33:17 Comment: There's nothing.\n33:18 Comment: Nothing malicious in it from the Sheehy.\n33:20 Comment: Just absolutely whips the

looked like he was in a good position either behind.\n33:37 Comment: I don't think he saw.\n33:39 Comment: The full contact there.\n33:42 Comment: It's nothing serious though on Pania.\n33:43 Comment: He's up and walking again.\n33:46 Comment: There's that rule of thumb.\n33:48 Comment: That the more a player rolls around the less injured they actually are.\n33:54 Comment: And I'm sure it's stung.\n33:56 Comment: Decent in the air.\n33:57 Comment: Toloi at 6'1\".\n33:58 Comment: Paletta at 6'3\".\n34:1 Comment: The two.\n34:2 Comment: Diminutive playmakers.\n34:3 Comment: Gomez and Morales.\n34:6 Comment: Ready to serve.\n34:9 Comment: Will be Gomez.\n34:10 Comment: Sending it across.\n34:12 Comment: Well handled Donnarumma.\n34:15 Comment: Access to flex it away.\n34:17 Comment: And Alonso player down after the collision with the big 6'5\".\n34:20 Comment: Youngster.\n34:22 Comment: Chance for Gomez to the goal line.\n34:24 Comment: And Donnarumma down quickly.\n34:26 Comment: That's very confident there from Donnarumma.\n34:28 Comment: And I think he also took out Toloi on that initial ball.\n34:31 Comment: That was sent in.\n34:32 Comment: Let's take a look here.\n34:33 Comment: It's a fine delivery from Papu Gomez.\n34:36 Comment: I know it's actually.\n34:37 Comment: Get Sambo.\n34:38 Comment: Sandwiched in between Roman Jolly.\n34:40 Comment: And the Yangon.\n34:42 Comment: I think it's just a hard landing on Toloi.\n34:44 Comment: Yeah.\n34:45 Comment: Lands right on the back from.\n34:47 Comment: Nearly being catapulted in the air.\n34:50 Comment: And might need an oxygen tank but he won't need a chiropractor for a while.\n34:54 Comment: It's good confident play though Phil from the 16 year old.\n34:56 Comment: He comes out.\n34:57 Comment: He knows that.\n34:59 Comment: If you dedicate yourself as a goalkeeper coming up for the ball.\n35:1 Comment: You better get a convincing fist.\n35:3 Comment: On to that one and get it away from the danger zone.\n35:5 Comment: That's exactly what he's doing.\n35:6 Comment: Donnarumma was able to do.\n35:8 Comment: And then he gets down low six foot six and.\n35:10 Comment: Probably still growing.\n35:13 Comment: But he gets down very quickly on the second attempt.\n35:24 Comment: It's good goes down after the collision with.\n35:26 Comment: The.\n35:28 Comment: Holy wide from the.\n35:30 Comment: To Nelly on the overlap if they can find it.\n35:32 Comment: They'll retreat.\n35:34 Comment: This.\n35:36 Comment: Roman Yoli.\n35:38 Comment: But he appears to be OK.\n35:41 Comment: I'm the test to Laura Palletta with the touch.\n35:44 Comment: At the pass away by Baca off target.\n35:47 Comment: Is.\n35:48 Comment: 10 minutes.\n35:50 Comment: To nine and change left.\n35:52 Comment: Ice tackle Gomez drags it inside.\n35:55 Comment: Taken down.\n35:57 Comment: And screaming Montolivo at that.\n35:59 Comment: Play by Gomez the Argentine.\n36:2 Comment: So tricky to dispossess Gomez great work right getting back\n36:5 Comment: and when he's in possession that low center of gravity.\n36:8 Comment: Those shifty movements.\n36:10 Comment: There's no contact initially there for Montolivo but he just\n36:13 Comment: backs himself into.\n36:15 Comment: Gomez.\n36:17 Comment: A bit too physical for the referees liking.\n36:23 Comment: The center

Comment: Don't think Pena really knew\n8:41 Comment: where the goal was he didn't\n8:42 Comment: really look upfield at all just.\n8:44 Comment: Had one intention following the\n8:46 Comment: ball and striking at first time\n8:48 Comment: and instead of looking at a\n8:49 Comment: better option it's very\n8:50 Comment: difficult to beat the goalkeeper\n8:52 Comment: from that position.\n8:53 Comment: Meanwhile the high limit.\n8:55 Comment: Barking at me on.\n8:58 Comment: Find some trickery at midfield\n9:0 Comment: and almost.\n9:1 Comment: Leading to a goal against.\n9:3 Comment: Him

have gotten to it.\n9:23 Comment: Morales week.\n9:25 Comment: And low.\n9:26 Comment: And wide.\n9:27 Comment: That's a few times now that\n9:28 Comment: we've seen Donnarumma even if\n9:30 Comment: the ball is clearly wide he just\n9:31 Comment: dives anyway doesn't he a lot of\n9:33 Comment: times with the experienced\n9:34 Comment: goalkeepers they'll just watch\n9:36 Comment: that one flash by but.\n9:38 Comment: Donnarumma not taking any risks.\n9:40 Comment: Wants to make sure that post is\n9:42 Comment: completely covered with that six\n9:43 Comment: foot six frame.\n9:44 Comment: I

goes Gomez.\n10:32 Comment: The foul.\n10:33 Comment: Or a dive.\n10:34 Comment: And it looks like the Argentine\n10:36 Comment: going to be booked for\n10:37 Comment: simulation.\n10:38 Comment: That's going to be worth another\n10:39 Comment: look.\n10:40 Comment: Calabria.\n10:41 Comment: Lunged in and might have gotten\n10:43 Comment: a little lucky here.\n10:45 Comment: To take a look at this.\n10:46 Comment: First glance I thought that was\n10:47 Comment: a foul.\n10:48 Comment: First glance I thought that was\n10:49 Comment: a penalty.\n10:50 Comment: Let's take a look at it and\n10:51 Comment: replay his Calabria.\n10:53 Comment: Gives away possession and.\n10:54 Comment: Oh he did get a touch onto the\n10:56 Comment: ball then he let's take a look\n10:57 Comment: here at that foot.\n10:59 Comment: But at the same point.\n11:3 Comment: That's a.\n11:4 Comment: This is going to be the best\n11:6 Comment: thing going down.\n11:7 Comment: It looks like he did get a touch\n11:9 Comment: onto the ball before going.\n11:11 Comment: Through the legs of the player\n11:13 Comment: Papu Gomez.\n11:14 Comment: My point is there was contact\n11:16 Comment: between the two players.\n11:17 Comment: And that's what you see in the\n11:18 Comment: book.\n11:19 Comment: Gomez but credit I think.\n11:21 Comment: The Jack O'Malley is.\n11:23 Comment: Gomez had already started to\n11:24 Comment: play for the contact.\n11:26 Comment: Normally a referee would let\n11:28 Comment: that go but now.\n11:29 Comment: Gomez in the book.\n11:30 Comment: You saw the second that the dive\n11:32 Comment: was made.\n11:34 Comment: From Calabria the player.\n11:36 Comment: Almost anticipating the contact\n11:37 Comment: that started.\n11:39 Comment: Going to ground but.\n11:40 Comment: That call Phil we've seen that\n11:42 Comment: go both ways.\n11:43 Comment: Very bold challenge coming in\n11:45 Comment: from the youngster Calabria.\n11:47 Comment: So only 18

Comment: So how about the work that\n12:50 Comment: Paleta has done on Baca he's\n12:52 Comment: beat him every single time in\n12:53 Comment: the year when Milan had booted\n12:55 Comment: the balls up to the Colombian.\n12:56 Comment: And he's had his back to go he's\n12:58 Comment: barely been able to get on the\n12:59 Comment: ball and part has been very\n13:1 Comment: aggressive.\n13:2 Comment: Every single time one of these\n13:3 Comment: balls is trying to find Baca\n13:5 Comment: he's been intercepting them and.\n13:6 Comment: Great anticipation.\n13:8 Comment: Against still Milan man on loan\n13:10 Comment: at Atlanta and maybe.\n13:13 Comment: Putting up a shingle say.\n13:15 Comment: Spoke to suit bripped the\n13:16 Comment: shingle down.\n13:18 Comment: Now against Baca.\n13:20 Comment: Baca drives inside.\n13:22 Comment: The needy.\n13:23 Comment: Getting enough of a touch\n13:25 Comment: quick work from she got Amy and\n13:26 Comment: here's Gomez with some help 3\n13:28 Comment: V 3.\n13:30 Comment: Maybe 4.\n13:31 Comment: YearI.\n13:32 Comment: sey pushing up.\n13:33 Comment: Drives on Max caress Gomez\n13:34 Comment: across.\n13:34 Comment: Pasi pushing up, drives on Meksis, Gomez across the shot,\n13:38 Comment: and oversteps Romagnoli.\n13:40 Comment: Always looking to cut to the inside\n13:42 Comment: on his favored right foot, Papu Gomez.\n13:45 Comment: So tricky on the counterattack.\n13:48 Comment: Those quick little movements side to side\n13:50 Comment: and going for the inside.\n13:52 Comment: Magic word, be it French or Italian, Meksis in the book.\n13:56 Comment: And this is where he needs to calm down, Meksis.\n13:58 Comment: How many times throughout his career\n14:0 Comment: has he let his emotions get the better of him?\n14:3 Comment: He says something silly to the referee or to another player,\n14:6 Comment: or as we saw last season with Mauri,\n14:10 Comment: just grabs their throat and starts choking them.\n14:13 Comment: And he was saying that was going to be his final match.\n14:15 Comment: Hasn't quite worked out that way.\n14:17 Comment: Ice from Gomez, the cross,\n14:19 Comment: Paletta already starting to come down.\n14:22 Comment: Antonelli sees it poked away.\n14:25 Comment: Already better than the last three road trips for Atalanta.\n14:30 Comment: Pounded by Fiorentina, 3-0.\n14:33 Comment: Beaten and taught him by Juventus, 2-0.\n14:35 Comment: And then at that point, cellar-dwelling Bologna\n14:39 Comment: knocking them for a loop, 3-0 as well.\n14:41 Comment: So scoreless with a half hour to go at Milan, an improvement.\n14:51 Comment: You could argue at least around the goal\n14:56 Comment: have been the more dangerous.\n14:59 Comment: Although both offenses have been a bit toothless.\n15:6 Comment: Morales, Raimondi, little air underneath,\n15:10 Comment: but balls for Chiarini.\n15:13 Comment: Morales draws two,\n15:16 Comment: swoops it to the middle,\n15:18 Comment: settles, shoot, but de Vroon well off target.\n15:22 Comment: Really a bizarre performance from Milan.\n15:24 Comment: It's Atalanta playing the way you'd expect them to play.\n15:29 Comment: You'd expect Rossoneri to play at home,\n15:31 Comment: holding on to a majority of the possession it seems,\n15:33 Comment: and really dictating the play of the game\n15:36 Comment: and taking it to Milan.\n15:40 Comment: Especially the way Milan performed last week against Lazio\n15:42 Comment: where they had their best performance of the season,\n15:45 Comment: but clearly see the kind of impact\n15:48 Comment: even a player like Giacomo Bonaventura has had on the side.\n15:51 Comment: Adding that creativity to length the midfield with the attack.\n15:55 Comment: Now a chance, Baca pushing it wide,\n15:57 Comment: but he's too busy watching.\n15:59 Comment: That will allow Raimondi time to get over.\n16:2 Comment: Did he carry it over the goal line though?\n16:4 Comment: Nope, blasted up the line, intercepted Montelivo\n16:7 Comment: into the area, Paletta waves the cape.\n16:11 Comment: Looked like there could have been contact,\n16:12 Comment: instead it will carry for the eventual goal kick.\n16:15 Comment: It's a surprise with Nyanga,\n16:17 Comment: almost like he wasn't expecting that ball\n16:18 Comment: to be played through from Baca.\n16:20 Comment: Once Baca went at the defenders,\n16:22 Comment: you saw Nyanga not really sprinting anymore\n16:24 Comment: up that left-hand side,\n16:27 Comment: and he kept his run going.\n16:28 Comment: He would have gone to that ball\n16:29 Comment: and it would have been a very good opportunity\n16:32 Comment: inside the final third and inside the box.\n16:37 Comment: Can't quite tell if it was Nyanga or Antonelli,\n16:41 Comment: but Mihailovic asking a few questions out there.\n16:45 Comment: Maybe Nyanga if he's tiring a bit.\n16:49 Comment: Because I think in the first half\n16:50 Comment: that would have been a pass\n16:52 Comment: he would have been on the end of.\n16:55 Comment: Too far for the 5'2 Morales.\n16:58 Comment: Throw in for Milan in their own end.\n17:12 Comment: Lutska sandwiched.\n17:15 Comment: Although DeVoe got the worst of it.\n17:17 Comment: Gets a little gift in return,\n17:19 Comment: down the line nicely, Morales,\n17:21 Comment: Pena on his inside.\n17:23 Comment: Mek says checking the rear view mirror.\n17:25 Comment: Sandwiched the Chilean.\n17:28 Comment: Nice from Chigurhini, back for Morales.\n17:31 Comment: Three in the box for Adelanta.\n17:33 Comment: Mek denying Dora Roma.\n17:34 Comment: What a stop by Dora Roma from point-blank range,\n17:38 Comment: and Chigurhini can't keep the rebound down.\n17:40 Comment: That's world-class from Dora Roma,\n17:42 Comment: the 16-year-old.\n17:43 Comment: Look at that cross playing in.\n17:44 Comment: It's a wonderful header from the Chilean.\n17:47 Comment: Pena pushes it down and...\n17:50 Comment: Excuse me, look at Chigurhini with the header\n17:53 Comment: and gets right in front of Pauly,\n17:55 Comment: but look at the way that Dora Roma reacts.\n17:57 Comment: He gets down so quickly to push that one away.\n18:0 Comment: That should have gone in.\n18:2 Comment: Quality reflexes from the 16-year-old.\n18:4 Comment: A goal-saving save.\n18:8 Comment: And this is a move that we expected from some time.\n18:11 Comment: Taking on a midfielder, Kuczka,\n18:13 Comment: couldn't get into this match.\n18:15 Comment: A rusty touch on the ball,\n18:16 Comment: and Mihailovic throwing in another striker,\n18:18 Comment: so it's gonna be a bit of a change in the look,\n18:21 Comment: as it's two strikers now with Baca and Adriano\n18:24 Comment: probably gonna be playing side-by-side.\n18:27 Comment: Here's Adriano, a little bit more speed,\n18:29 Comment: maybe to go alongside Miyang.\n18:32 Comment: Quickly pushing forward, Graci for Morales,\n18:35 Comment: back to Graci, the kid skipping it back.\n18:38 Comment: Morales, Morales near post and I,\n18:41 Comment: Dora Roma again with the stop.\n18:42 Comment: That time a bit easier for Dora Roma,\n18:44 Comment: and look at him, he's barking out orders at the defenders.\n18:48 Comment: The 16-year-old's not happy with the way\n18:50 Comment: this defense is getting split apart,\n18:52 Comment: and that's Maxi Morales making the run in behind Romagnoli,\n18:55 Comment: who was late to react.\n18:57 Comment: Wonderful ball into stride for the Argentine,\n18:59 Comment: but it's at the near post.\n19:1 Comment: Gomez from Morales, they'll head to the corner\n19:3 Comment: and do it again.\n19:4 Comment: Something we were talking about in the pregame,\n19:6 Comment: how both Dora Roma and his predecessor Lopez\n19:10 Comment: have been beaten to the near post a bit too much.\n19:12 Comment: That time he was leaning back post, but got over in time.\n19:17 Comment: It's been relatively quiet,\n19:19 Comment: but it's Atalanta that's starting to shout.\n19:24 Comment: Drop back, Ramon, actually Chigurhini,\n19:27 Comment: sending it back, Morales drives it low\n19:30 Comment: and blasted at that near post.\n19:33 Comment: Chance goes off target from Dehoon.\n19:37 Comment: You can hear Mihailovic screaming from the microphones.\n19:40 Comment: He's absolutely livid at this last spell possession\n19:44 Comment: from Atalanta, three golden chances.\n19:46 Comment: This one rifled in.\n19:48 Comment: It's a rather tight angle for Morales,\n19:50 Comment: but he has a go at Donnarumma.\n19:53 Comment: It was a save earlier though that was world class\n19:56 Comment: from the 16-year-old.\n19:59 Comment: Give credit to Chigurhini.\n20:0 Comment: Normally when you're playing against a big keeper,\n20:3 Comment: Baca charging in easy for the 23-year-old Sportiello.\n20:7 Comment: Playing against a big keeper,\n20:9 Comment: you try and go just outside his cleats\n20:11 Comment: because it's hard for them to get down so quickly.\n20:14 Comment: Well Buffon made a habit of it for generations\n20:18 Comment: and now maybe the next generation\n20:20 Comment: showing he can do it too.\n20:25 Comment: I was gonna earlier say credit to Sportiello.\n20:28 Comment: He seems to be buried in the wealth of young goalkeepers\n20:34 Comment: that are bursting onto the scene for the Azzurri,\n20:36 Comment: but I think we've seen the difference here\n20:39 Comment: of what's making Donnarumma so special.\n20:41 Comment: But it is all going to be in a wasted cause.\n20:50 Comment: Sandro Deano lurking, waiting for a miscue.\n20:53 Comment: Neon flying back Morales.\n21:0 Comment: By the way, that's the second time I can count\n21:2 Comment: that Mexas has kept an Adelante attack onside.\n21:8 Comment: I can understand a bit of rust,\n21:9 Comment: but Mihailovic is probably gonna go crazy with the clicker.\n21:14 Comment: Our side, Cherchey, haven't called his name much this half\n21:17 Comment: and that might be why.\n21:18 Comment: That's a new formation now for Mihailovic.\n21:20 Comment: It looks more like a 4-2-2-2 with Baca and Adriano.\n21:26 Comment: Two wingers right alongside them\n21:27 Comment: and then the two holding midfielders\n21:29 Comment: right in front of that inexperienced back line.\n21:40 Comment: Let's just say it's been a relatively quiet arrival\n21:45 Comment: for this man, Luis Adriano.\n21:47 Comment: And he can play even behind Baca.\n21:49 Comment: As you see, he's comfortable drifting onto the midfield.\n21:52 Comment: Decent vision, Luis Adriano.\n21:54 Comment: We saw him set up a few Baca goals.\n21:56 Comment: Nice, Mbelene.\n22:0 Comment: Luis Adriano still just 28.\n22:4 Comment: He's scored a goal almost every other game for Shakhtar,\n22:6 Comment: but only a couple of goals for Milan.\n22:14 Comment: Maybe a chance to prove he deserves to be back\n22:17 Comment: in the starting lineup.\n22:19 Comment: And both his goals have come from headers.\n22:23 Comment: Late game headers, actually, from the corner kick.\n22:27 Comment: Maybe time for a third.\n22:30 Comment: And he, grabbing Calabria,\n22:33 Comment: who just shakes off the challenge\n22:35 Comment: and rifles it to Pauly for Montelivo.\n22:38 Comment: Nice spin and turn.\n22:40 Comment: Opens the door for Luis Adriano.\n22:42 Comment: Baca to his favored right.\n22:44 Comment: Forces it through.\n22:46 Comment: Credit again, Cigarini, for poking it free.\n22:48 Comment: And Baca just a little predictable today.\n22:59 Comment: Talked about four shots to three from Milan\n23:3 Comment: in the first half.\n23:4 Comment: It's four shots to just one for Adelanta here in the second.\n23:8 Comment: And they're not done past the midway point.\n23:12 Comment: Nice from Gomez.\n23:14 Comment: Grassi kicks save, Donnarumma.\n23:17 Comment: Three brilliant stops in the second half alone.\n23:21 Comment: Grassi and Milan collide.\n23:25 Comment: But that one almost destined for the back of the net.\n23:28 Comment: Talk about a coming out party for Donnarumma.\n23:31 Comment: It's another save.\n23:34 Comment: It's this time a kick save.\n23:36 Comment: Gomez has been so influential in starting up the play\n23:39 Comment: and getting by two defenders.\n23:41 Comment: It's the youngster Grassi, first time side-footed effort.\n23:45 Comment: It is rather central.\n23:46 Comment: And Donnarumma getting down quickly once again.\n23:48 Comment: That time, a kick save from the 16-year-old.\n23:53 Comment: What a game he's had here today.\n24:4 Comment: Murales holding off Antonelli.\n24:6 Comment: A little bit of a push.\n24:7 Comment: Tries to get to the goal line.\n24:9 Comment: Nice tackle from the veteran.\n24:11 Comment: And Murales looking over in disbelief.\n24:14 Comment: Phil, this could easily be 2-0 up for Atalanta.\n24:17 Comment: Almost get the sense they deserve a goal here\n24:20 Comment: in the second half.\n24:21 Comment: They've been the better side.\n24:23 Comment: And this is the kind of game that Mihailovic\n24:25 Comment: really wants to play.\n24:27 Comment: And he's got to be able to do that.\n24:29 Comment: He's got to be able to get the ball to the other side.\n24:31 Comment: And this is the kind of game that Mihailovic\n24:33 Comment: will want to see the response.\n24:35 Comment: Last season, so many times, Zaghi and Milan\n24:38 Comment: would just lay down in a match like this\n24:40 Comment: and really question their performance, their willingness.\n24:44 Comment: And this is what Mihailovic was brought in to do.\n24:47 Comment: Get results from some of these ugly games.\n24:49 Comment: Have the players working for a full 90 minutes.\n25:2 Comment: Over Pena.\n25:3 Comment: Nexus handling it well.\n25:14 Comment: You have the Argentine, Germán Denis,\n25:16 Comment: available on the bench.\n25:19 Comment: But when Pena gets tired.\n25:24 Comment: So Yasmin Cortes, a good box-to-box man.\n25:29 Comment: Laid back.\n25:30 Comment: Gomez, just off stride for Grassi.\n25:35 Comment: Is that a lot to getting a little too adventurous?\n25:39 Comment: Milan, didn't hear the footsteps and fouls\n25:41 Comment: Raimondi as he tries to win it back.\n25:48 Comment: Looks like Mejia is going to the bench.\n25:53 Comment: And it is going to be the midfield.\n25:54 Comment: But it's the Chilean, Carmona, coming in for Grassi.\n25:57 Comment: Good game for the youngster.\n26:2 Comment: And now sticking in the Copa America champion.\n26:8 Comment: Like for like in the midfield, Grassi\n26:10 Comment: had that good opportunity, that side-footed attempt\n26:12 Comment: that was saved by Donnarumma.\n26:15 Comment: Now Carmona, very hard worker in the midfield,\n26:19 Comment: can play out wide or in the center.\n26:28 Comment: Chance on his first touch, wide for Morales.\n26:31 Comment: Gomez is near the spot, sending it long, soaring in Pena,\n26:35 Comment: but well-defended Calabria again.\n26:39 Comment: And now it's going to be Mihailovic looking to the bench.\n26:44 Comment: Neon is going to exit.\n26:47 Comment: And it's Honda who will check in.\n26:49 Comment: Fine performance for Neon.\n26:52 Comment: And the fans appreciate it.\n26:53 Comment: It's his first start of the season.\n26:55 Comment: And it's looked like he's played every single match so far.\n26:59 Comment: By far the most dangerous option for Mihailovic\n27:2 Comment: in the attacking third.\n27:3 Comment: And now Kishke Honda, a player who lost his starting place\n27:7 Comment: earlier this season.\n27:9 Comment: What does he have to offer here?\n27:11 Comment: I was thinking maybe it would be Suso, another player who\n27:15 Comment: lost his starting spot.\n27:16 Comment: But similar with Baca and Luis Adriano up front.\n27:19 Comment: Now a player behind them to hopefully unlock the door\n27:23 Comment: and allow them to run through.\n27:26 Comment: Morales scooping it over.\n27:28 Comment: Excess with a touch.\n27:29 Comment: Gomez, but too close to Donnarumma.\n27:32 Comment: Again, the calmest man in the stadium.\n27:36 Comment: Calmest boy, should I say.\n27:38 Comment: Just can't keep possession right now, Milot.\n27:40 Comment: It's all Atalanta.\n27:42 Comment: Grini.\n27:44 Comment: Morales on the far flank.\n27:46 Comment: Walks the tightrope.\n27:48 Comment: Right now the visitor is finding it way too easy\n27:51 Comment: to get into the final third and really test Donnarumma.\n27:54 Comment: That's four saves that he's made in the last 15 minutes.\n27:58 Comment: This is about as offensive a lineup\n28:0 Comment: as Milan can put out there.\n28:3 Comment: But they can't even maintain possession, Mateo.\n28:7 Comment: Wide for Pena.\n28:10 Comment: Approaching the final quarter hour.\n28:13 Comment: Pena.\n28:14 Comment: Against Antonelli.\n28:15 Comment: In for Gomez.\n28:17 Comment: Actually, Carmona playing on that inside role.\n28:20 Comment: Chilean to Chilean.\n28:22 Comment: Go, Chilean!\n28:24 Comment: Dan Cremona.\n28:26 Comment: Chilean!\n28:28 Comment: Pena tries to spin.\n28:31 Comment: Nice from Carmona.\n28:33 Comment: Maxi thought the run would go wide.\n28:35 Comment: Honda's going to play on the left-hand side of the trident.\n28:39 Comment: Earlier season, we had seen him on the right under Izaghi\n28:42 Comment: where he'd cut in, but he's naturally a player that likes\n28:45 Comment: to operate right behind the striker in a more central\n28:48 Comment: attacking midfield position.\n28:51 Comment: They're going to stick with a 4-2-2-2.\n28:54 Comment: That's what it looks like.\n28:55 Comment: Cherchey on that far flank.\n28:57 Comment: Actually leaning even higher than Honda.\n29:1 Comment: Screaming at the high heavens and those things a bit lower.\n29:5 Comment: Mihailovic as Adelante gets it back again.\n29:9 Comment: Morales, good run.\n29:10 Comment: Carmona, if he can find him.\n29:12 Comment: Back post is Gomez.\n29:13 Comment: Lifting it up over for Pena, but just too far.\n29:20 Comment: He is sending it back into the mix, but punched away\n29:24 Comment: by the 6'5 man-child.\n29:27 Comment: Honda, but again, straight back to the white shirts.\n29:32 Comment: It's going to be frustrating at the San Siro.\n29:34 Comment: You don't hear the whistles, though.\n29:36 Comment: At least not many.\n29:38 Comment: I think they appreciate the last three wins in a row\n29:41 Comment: and they realize it is a process, but it would be a bit of a black eye\n29:47 Comment: to fall at home against Adelante.\n29:58 Comment: Dribbling in, going to Roma, maybe one of his first mistakes.\n30:1 Comment: Carmona intercepts.\n30:3 Comment: Gomez flicks to his right.\n30:5 Comment: Tries to use Morales as a screen.\n30:7 Comment: Back across for Pena.\n30:10 Comment: Excess intrudes enough.\n30:13 Comment: Back heel against Calabria.\n30:17 Comment: Says thank you very much.\n30:21 Comment: He's been through a workout.\n30:24 Comment: Just one substitute left.\n30:26 Comment: Figured Dennis might be the man to come in for Pena.\n30:33 Comment: Off a give and go, Calabria again.\n30:37 Comment: Trying to prevent the goal kick, but not in time.\n30:42 Comment: Doesn't look shy about going to a challenge, does he, Calabria?\n30:46 Comment: First inside the box, then there on Penilla.\n30:50 Comment: Good defender for a full back, and we saw this earlier in the season\n30:53 Comment: with David Calabria.\n30:56 Comment: Well, it's been a frustrating few years for Milan fans,\n30:59 Comment: but as you mentioned earlier, in some ways you can already see them\n31:4 Comment: building a defense around the likes of Gona Roma and Roman Ioli.\n31:11 Comment: Puts Calabria into the mix, and if they can ever get the CEO back on track,\n31:15 Comment: and then with Milan hoping to lead the attack, promising signs for the future.\n31:25 Comment: But Milan has never really been known as a patient team.\n31:31 Comment: 3-3, Jeroen, collision on the far flank.\n31:35 Comment: Calabria asking for help as he and Gomez collide.\n31:44 Comment: That's aggressive play here from Calabria,\n31:46 Comment: trying to intercept that pass headed for Pampu Gomez.\n31:50 Comment: Looks to be all right though, getting to his feet, good to see.\n31:53 Comment: With a knock on the ankle and a little yellow card to make him feel better.\n31:58 Comment: Inable right now, unable to hold on to possession, Milan.\n32:2 Comment: That midfield can't shrink together more than two passes in a row.\n32:6 Comment: And Marriott just twists that right ankle as he's falling down.\n32:11 Comment: It bends under his leg.\n32:14 Comment: See if Atalanta tries to take advantage over Antonelli.\n32:18 Comment: He and Pena tangle, all's fair.\n32:25 Comment: Well, if this score holds, Milan would pick up a point,\n32:29 Comment: move above Sassuolo on points, but Sassuolo could leap back above them tomorrow.\n32:38 Comment: Atalanta, meanwhile, would also pick up a point and move into a tie with Lazio,\n32:42 Comment: who have their big showdown, 9 o'clock Eastern, 6 Pacific against Roma.\n32:50 Comment: That should be fun.\n32:52 Comment: Good way to wake up.\n32:55 Comment: Gomez, low and wide and again,\n32:59 Comment: dirtying up the elbows, Gianluigi from Roma.\n33:4 Comment: Too high for Luis Adriano.\n33:6 Comment: Nexus tries the ground floor.\n33:9 Comment: Baca off to the Brazilian, poke free.\n33:13 Comment: Good hustle by the groom, but straight for Cherchi.\n33:17 Comment: A couple of years ago for Torino, that might have found a way to get him.\n33:21 Comment: But he's got a good shot.\n33:24 Comment: To the Brazilian, poke free.\n33:26 Comment: Good hustle by the groom, but straight for Cherchi.\n33:31 Comment: A couple of years ago for Torino, that might have found the corner.\n33:34 Comment: Instead, it bangs off Paletta.\n33:36 Comment: I think that's the first time in the last 10 or 15 minutes that Milan have even been able to get\n33:41 Comment: into Atalanta's half and hold possession for longer than a few seconds, Phil.\n33:48 Comment: This will swing in towards Portiello.\n33:50 Comment: Edge of the six, glance down.\n33:52 Comment: Adriano Luis almost with another late header, but cleared away Chigurhini.\n33:56 Comment: Appeals for a handball, but none coming.\n34:0 Comment: Screaming Romagnoli and he might have a point.\n34:3 Comment: Gomez scoops it through.\n34:5 Comment: Carmona launches it.\n34:8 Comment: Morales has to wait.\n34:13 Comment: Remember, Nexus and Calabria both with yellows on that far flank.\n34:18 Comment: Atalanta can take advantage.\n34:22 Comment: Instead, down the near side, they'll retreat.\n34:31 Comment: Outside of the boot, into space.\n34:33 Comment: Will it hold?\n34:35 Comment: Bellini churning those 35-year-old legs.\n34:40 Comment: Gomez.\n34:42 Comment: And there might be a share of the points.\n34:46 Comment: While there have been a few individual bright spots for Milan,\n34:51 Comment: the better team has probably been Atalanta on the day.\n34:53 Comment: Without a shadow of a doubt, Phil.\n34:57 Comment: Worth looking at those two plays from earlier.\n34:59 Comment: Luis Adriano's header.\n35:1 Comment: Looking to once again get a goal from a corner kick coming in.\n35:5 Comment: That's the first or second shot of the half, Matteo.\n35:8 Comment: Incredible. 12 for Atalanta this half alone.\n35:11 Comment: That tells you everything you need to know.\n35:16 Comment: There it is once again.\n35:17 Comment: The header flying in and Chigurhini.\n35:21 Comment: Now there's a look at Martin.\n35:23 Comment: De Room just swiping across at the ball with that left hand.\n35:28 Comment: It was right in front of the body.\n35:31 Comment: We've seen those called before.\n35:35 Comment: Almost as though Mihalyvic is out there as a 12th man himself.\n35:40 Comment: On his tiptoes at the edge of the area.\n35:44 Comment: Final 10 minutes already underway.\n35:46 Comment: Nexus.\n35:48 Comment: Towards the spot. Bacca with a touch but a weak one wide.\n35:51 Comment: And at this point I think Atalanta\n35:54 Comment: content to let the clock tick away.\n35:57 Comment: There is a good look at Hermann Dennis.\n36:0 Comment: There are a few fans who have made the trek.\n36:12 Comment: 45 miles away.\n36:15 Comment: Is it down the A4?\n36:18 Comment: And it will be a joyous ride back.\n36:21 Comment: For a goal for Milan late.\n36:25 Comment: If they do stumble here and drop two points or\n36:29 Comment: forbid three.\n36:31 Comment: Does the seat automatically go back up to nuclear under Mihalyvic?\n36:35 Comment: I think with Milan that's what you're always going to get from the media Phil.\n36:38 Comment: But need to give Mihalyvic some time with this team.\n36:41 Comment: We saw what they can do with a little bit of consistency in terms of\n36:44 Comment: the starting 11 but a bit unfortunate to lose Ponaventura.\n36:47 Comment: The suspension. Bertolacci the injury.\n36:50 Comment: Those two.\n36:51 Comment: Especially Ponaventura.\n36:53 Comment: One of the best performers for Milan and Bertolacci finally\n36:56 Comment: picking it up after a few poor performances after\n36:59 Comment: joining from Genoa.\n37:1 Comment: Starting to live up to that price tag.\n37:4 Comment: 60-40. Atalanta\n37:6 Comment: with the possession lead.\n37:8 Comment: Burst of speed by Gomez.\n37:10 Comment: Threads it through and a backheel.\n37:13 Comment: Antonelli might have just saved the game.\n37:16 Comment: Raimondi gets it back though.\n37:18 Comment: Off to Morales.\n37:20 Comment: Seven and a half minutes remain.\n37:23 Comment: Cahoon.\n37:26 Comment: Chigurhi.\n37:29 Comment: Gomez draws Meksas.\n37:33 Comment: And now it's a one-two.\n37:35 Comment: Meksas.\n37:38 Comment: Beniga.\n37:39 Comment: Chigurhini.\n37:41 Comment: Good step up.\n37:43 Comment: Antonelli again with his second defensive performance.\n37:49 Comment: Burst of speed Cherchi but he forgot something on the way.\n37:54 Comment: Big difference. Phil Atalanta have four natural playmakers.\n37:57 Comment: So many comfortable at holding the ball at their feet.\n38:0 Comment: Milan perhaps two in the starting 11.\n38:3 Comment: And that's what we need to see more from Cherchi.\n38:5 Comment: Going by one defender.\n38:7 Comment: Now trying to go by De Roon and\n38:9 Comment: just a little bit nervous there.\n38:11 Comment: It's a clear foul on Cherchi.\n38:14 Comment: As he wraps his arm around De Roon's neck.\n38:16 Comment: I think he thought it should have been whistled the other way earlier\n38:20 Comment: but he did burst through that challenge.\n38:23 Comment: Rea.\n38:24 Comment: Alberto Molini as assistant off the bench.\n38:28 Comment: This would be quite an accomplishment for Atalanta.\n38:32 Comment: Look at the way Papu Gomez, Maxi Morales,\n38:34 Comment: they always drift back to the midfield from that wide position.\n38:37 Comment: Phil they're so good with the ball at their feet.\n38:41 Comment: Never give away possession cheaply like Milan have.\n38:45 Comment: It's been one of the real reasons for Atalanta's success here today.\n38:50 Comment: A 50-minute approach is maybe a chance for Cherchi to rewrite the script.\n38:54 Comment: Outside of the boot flip but straight to Sportiello.\n38:57 Comment: Nowhere near Baca.\n38:58 Comment: And there was Pauli that was screaming for the ball making the run inside the box.\n39:2 Comment: And three targets.\n39:4 Comment: Cherchi has to do better from that position.\n39:7 Comment: Well they're on the expressway.\n39:9 Comment: Just sprinting through the midfield.\n39:11 Comment: Carmona.\n39:13 Comment: Pushed into the curb by Luis Adriano.\n39:17 Comment: That should be quite an accomplishment but\n39:19 Comment: Atalanta has had some success.\n39:22 Comment: In fact they won this tie last year.\n39:25 Comment: They've split the last six with Milan after going five in a row without a victory.\n39:36 Comment: In fact Atalanta have won two of the last three at the San Siro.\n39:41 Comment: And they make it three out of four.\n39:45 Comment: Excess keeping an eye on Pena.\n39:47 Comment: Over him.\n39:49 Comment: And Luis Adriano.\n39:50 Comment: Hides Paleta away from danger.\n39:53 Comment: Five minutes remain of regulation.\n39:58 Comment: By the way that is a bit of a concern on those balls.\n40:1 Comment: Into the area.\n40:2 Comment: Nero Giacomelli.\n40:4 Comment: Has only pointed to the spot one time this year but he did it seven times last year.\n40:10 Comment: And a penalty would be an awful way to lose.\n40:15 Comment: Unbelievable.\n40:16 Comment: Ice from Bellini who's done well since coming off the bench.\n40:20 Comment: Gomez.\n40:22 Comment: Draws two.\n40:24 Comment: Against Calabria.\n40:26 Comment: No signs of a weak ankle there.\n40:28 Comment: Out for another corner.\n40:38 Comment: Milan's youth program has a good reputation.\n40:43 Comment: It's been a while since they've had a good reputation.\n40:46 Comment: Since I think they've borne any.\n40:48 Comment: World class fruit.\n40:50 Comment: We've seen two that might be ready.\n40:52 Comment: Here

    "summary": "The match between AC Milan and Atalanta at the San Siro ended in a 0-0 draw, but the lack of goals did not equate to a lack of drama or action. Both teams had their moments, with stirring performances, especially from the younger players, making the game a captivating, if frustrating, spectacle.\n\nFrom the very early moments of the match, it was clear that both sets of players were feeling the pressure. AC Milan started with their traditional red and black kits, while visitors Atalanta wore their white and black attire. The setup seemed aggressive and filled with intent, with Milan looking to leverage their home advantage against a side that has shown stellar form in Bergamo.\n\nEarly exchanges were understandably cautious, both teams trying to establish control in the midfield. Bacca and Niang carved some early opportunities, using their skill to challenge Atalanta's defense led by the veteran Raimondi. Atalanta's counter-attacks were swift and sharp, keeping Milan's defenders on their toes. The strategy from both sides appeared to be about soaking up pressure and launching precise attacks, making every advancement fraught with significance.\n\nIn terms of formation and player roles, Milan set up with a defensive-minded midfield trio of Paulie, Kucka, and Montolivo which gave them solidity but at times limited their attacking creativity. Atalanta, with the likes of Moralez, Gomez, and Pinilla, opted for a mix of experience and youthful exuberance, troubling Milan's backline with their fluid movement and passing.\n\nThe first significant action came around the 10-minute mark with a cunning free-kick opportunity for Milan. The ball was beautifully delivered but was met with a solid Atalanta defense, deflecting danger away from Sportiello’s goal. Moralez's influence was noteworthy, always seeming available to link play, and verging on orchestrating several Atalanta counterattacks that required the alertness of Milan's defenders.\n\nNiang, trying to make a statement to coach Mihajlovic about his place in the starting lineup, exhibited remarkable skill and pace. His career trajectory had been turbulent, but this game offered him another chance to impress. Around the 18-minute mark, Niang managed to get past multiple defenders and set up Bacca for a shot, which Sportiello saved—a clear offside, but a demonstration of Niang's potential.\n\nAs the first half progressed, the young goalkeeper Gianluigi Donnarumma drew attention with some critical saves. At 16, his composure and commanding presence were remarkable. His quick reflexes were on display when he parried away a long-range effort from Gomez and later made an assertive save from a close header by Pinilla.\n\nOne tactical element of note was Milan's usage of Cerci on the wings, looking to exploit his pace and dribbling abilities down the flanks. However, it was Niang on the opposite side who was having more joy against Atalanta’s 34-year-old Raimondi. The young Frenchman repeatedly outpaced Raimondi, cutting inside and delivering threatening crosses and shots.\n\nBy the half-hour mark, Milan were beginning to impose themselves, winning a series of corners that continually tested the resilience of the Atalanta defense. Kucka had a powerful attempt barely deflected wide, underlining Milan’s growing confidence.\n\nDespite Milan’s offensive forays, Atalanta held firm. Their defensive display was robust, and whenever possible, they tried to hit Milan on the counter with precise, quick transitions. Interceptions and timely tackles from Montolivo and Mexes were crucial in breaking up these dangerous counters.\n\nThe first half ended with an evident injury blow to Atalanta as left-back Drame had to be replaced by Bellini. Milan’s De Sciglio was also substituted due to a yellow card earned and potential danger of picking a second one. Calabria came in to fill the right-back position.\n\nThe second half saw a similar pattern of tightly contested midfield battles but with a higher tempo. Both sides were now committed to pushing for the opener. Milan continued to rely on Niang’s individual brilliance and Bacca’s poaching instincts, while Atalanta leveraged their quick passing and movement.\n\nNiang came close in the 50th minute with a powerful shot, but Sportiello was equal to the task, making an impressive save. Milan’s Montolivo continued to anchor the midfield, releasing timely through balls to the forwards. Conversely, Moralez and Gomez kept probing Milan's defenses, combining well with Pinilla to test the resilience of young Donnarumma regularly.\n\nAtalanta's best chances came around the 65th minute with a series of corners and dangerous crosses into Milan's box. Pinilla had a sure goal denied by a spectacular save from Donnarumma, who demonstrated cat-like reflexes to keep his team in the game. It was a moment of sheer brilliance that showcased the young keeper’s potential.\n\nIn response, Mihajlovic brought on Luiz Adriano, aiming to add fresh legs and a new attacking dimension to the team. Adriano and Bacca, the two Brazilians, began to form a promising partnership upfront, but Atalanta’s defense, solidified by Paletta and Toloi, stood strong.\n\nAs the match entered its final stages, Atalanta seemed to grow more confident and took control of the possession, especially through the efforts of Grassi and De Roon in the midfield. They orchestrated play, making Milan chase the ball and creating a few dangerous opportunities that Milan managed to snuff out with last-ditch defending.\n\nCerci and Cherchi hassled Atalanta’s defense but couldn’t find a breakthrough. Cherchi had one golden chance in the dying minutes when his lofted cross almost found Bacca, but the ever-alert Sportiello claimed the ball.\n\nIn the 80th minute, there was a flash of the old-fashioned Milan resilience. Despite being under constant pressure, the defense held firm. Mexes, Romagnoli, and Antonelli put their bodies on the line to block shots and clear dangerous balls from the box.\n\nInjury time saw Atalanta introduce German Denis, aiming to capitalize on his physical presence and scoring prowess in the last few minutes. However, Milan's defense, coupled with the assured hands of Donnarumma, kept the Argentine striker at bay.\n\nUltimately, both teams had to settle for a point in a match that was high on intensity but low on goals. Atalanta could be pleased with their disciplined defensive display and the attacking threats they posed, while Milan could take heart from the promising performances of their young stars, especially Donnarumma’s heroics between the posts.\n\nThe 0-0 draw, however, left Milan fans yearning for the attacking magic of yesteryears, but also offered a glimpse into a future that might yet bear fruit under Mihajlovic's guidance. The balance of youth and experience, if nurtured well, could see the Rossoneri rise to challenge once again."
