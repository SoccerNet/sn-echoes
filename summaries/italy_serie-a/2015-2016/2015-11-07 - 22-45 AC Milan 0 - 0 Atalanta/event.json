    "summary": "The match between AC Milan and Atalanta at San Siro, ending in a 0-0 draw, unfolded with a cascade of events throughout both halves, compelling the fans with its intensity and suspense, despite the absence of goals. Below is an extensive recount of the game’s moments, encapsulating the full breadth of the action witnessed on the pitch.\n\n### First Half:\n\nThe game kicked off sharply at 00:01, with AC Milan initiating proceedings. Mere seconds into the game, the ball veered out of play, introducing an early throw-in for Atalanta at 00:32. Milan was immediately put to the test, conceding a foul at 01:09, promptly reacted to by Atalanta, which resulted in a direct free-kick by Milan at 02:16. Shortly after, Milan committed another foul at 02:23, gifting Atalanta an indirect free-kick by 02:46. Atalanta struggled to maintain possession, leading to a series of ball-out-of-play incidents and subsequent throw-ins, evidenced at 03:04, 03:18, 03:23, 03:37, 04:19, 04:25, 04:27, 04:36, and 04:48.\n\nA foul by Milan at 04:48 saw Atalanta taking an indirect free-kick at 05:16 which culminated in AC Milan retrieving the ball. The frantic energy on both sides resulted in numerous interruptions, with the ball continuing to breach the sidelines at 05:31, 05:55, 06:56, and resulted in Atalanta taking most throw-ins. A notable moment occurred at 07:45 when Atalanta had their first shot off-target, underscoring the initial offensive threat from the visitors.\n\nDespite the frequent halts, moments of active play were characterized by fierce tussles for the ball leading to fouls, such as the foul by Atalanta at 09:05, and the offside by AC Milan at 09:17. As the game pressed into the 10th minute, Milan attempted a consolidated offensive but frequently lost control, highlighted during the regular ball-out-of-play instances at 11:11, 11:31, 11:41, and 12:17.\n\nA notable interruption occurred at 13:29, leading to a throw-in by AC Milan, who appeared determined to break the deadlock. Much of the first half saw Milan engaging in a continuous push-forward strategy, continuously gaining possession through throw-ins but being quickly rebuffed by Atalanta via robust clearances (e.g., 13:08, 13:35, 14:15, 14:22). A critical moment unfolded at 16:57 with a corner by AC Milan, shortly followed by another ensuing corner at 17:13, which unfortunately led to a shot off target at 17:16.\n\nAtalanta made a tactical substitution at 19:07, looking to refresh their lineup and gain a competitive edge. The tension heightened with every foul committed; one by Atalanta at 20:13 was particularly an eyebrow-raiser leading to an indirect free-kick by Milan at 20:36. This created an opportunity for Milan, registering a shot on target by 20:44, although it didn’t result in a goal.\n\nFrom 21:56 onwards, the intensity remained unabated as Milan persisted in winning back possession through numerous throw-ins (e.g., 22:00, 22:29, 23:34, 23:46). Another key moment transpired at 24:00, with Milan receiving a yellow card after a foul, thus breaching the peace and inducing an indirect free-kick (24:29) for Atalanta. The flurry of activities continued as Milan resolutely pushed forward, creating sporadic chances to turn the tide, albeit falling short each time.\n\nThe patterns of interruptions stretched into the first half’s final minutes, interspersed with relentless attacks and defensive maneuvers that saw neither team conceding any substantial advantage. The efforts were manifest in countless indirect free-kicks aided by fouls from both sides (30:32, 33:53, and 43:04), yet each attempt bore no fruit.\n\n### Second Half:\n\nAC Milan began the second half with a substitution, signaling a tactical shift in their approach. Atalanta took charge of the kick-off at 00:00, only to see Milan caught offside shortly at 00:42, leading to an indirect free-kick for Atalanta. The second half heralded intense pace, captained by defensive vigilance and occasional interruptions, hinting at potential openings such as the shots on target by AC Milan at 05:26.\n\nDespite the unyielding pace, fouls continued to pepper the game's rhythm, prominently one by Milan at 06:10, followed by another slew of activities including Atalanta’s shots off target and fouls at 07:06 and 07:08, respectively. The half was rife with offside traps, indirect free-kicks (as at 07:53), defensive clearances (by 08:45), and persistent shots off target by Atalanta (09:23).\n\nYellow cards were dished out judiciously to maintain decorum, following fouls by Atalanta at 10:37. By 11:34, Milan countered with throw-ins, aiming to launch an offensive, though Atalanta’s defense stood resilient. Atalanta responded with shots on target at 13:37, highlighting their attacking intent. This was silenced momentarily by AC Milan's harsh clearances, contributing to the defensive spectacle witnessed.\n\nFrequent throw-ins at 14:41, 14:43, and 14:54 underscored Milan’s involvement as they maneuvered towards Atalanta’s defensive line but were thwarted by the latter’s solid back-line. The pattern of shots off target continued with Atalanta’s endeavors at 29:29 underscored by unyielding defensive discipline from Milan.\n\nFurther into the half, the episodic yellow cards (notably at 33:32 and 35:50) and substitutions (e.g., at 26:13) introduced fresh legs and maintained the tactical intrigue. The dynamic remained equally engaged with sporadic shots on target (33:50) and fouls inducing indirect free-kicks, maintaining the nerve-wracking suspense.\n\nIn the final segment of the second half, the pace continued to oscillate with Milan’s offside at 43:22 signaling strategic missteps. The ensuing minutes were punctuated by quick fouls (as at 43:26), concluding with a final indirect free-kick by Milan (45:31) only to crest upon shots going off-target.\n\nIn conclusion, despite a scoreless draw, the game between AC Milan and Atalanta was emblazoned with moments of tactical brilliance, rigorous defenses, persistent shots, and disciplinary interruptions that captivated the audience with its relentless pace and competitive spirit. Each team displayed tenacity, with both engagements highlighting football's tactical depth, leaving spectators awaiting future clashes with bated breath."
