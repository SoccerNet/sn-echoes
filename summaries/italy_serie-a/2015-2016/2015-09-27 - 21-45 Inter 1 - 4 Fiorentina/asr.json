This is how I played.\n30:14 Comment: But, of course, feeling guilty\n30:15 Comment: in three goals conceded.\n30:19 Comment: Serve from Pirisic.\n30:20 Comment: The medal is in attack.\n30:21 Comment: Discount for the goalkeeper.

Failure after failure.\n31:26 Comment: And now in the minority\n31:28 Comment: remain\n31:28 Comment: the owners are already\n31:31 Comment: at the end of half an hour of play.\n31:54 Comment: 況.\n31:56 Comment: I assumed this\n31:57 Comment: in a team match,\n31:59 Comment: haven't missed it yet\n32:1 Comment: in the first half, not a single goal.\n32:3 Comment: But Ferentina still doesn’t let him through.\n32:5 Comment: But Inter is in trouble.\n32:18 Comment: 22 meters\n32:20 Comment: to the gate\n32:21 Comment: Ferentin has plenty.\n32:23 Comment: Players who are capable of scoring against Handanovic from such a distance.\n32:27 Comment: Moreover, the further from the goal, the more difficult it is for Handanovich.\n32:34 Comment: And in this match, he unsuccessfully parried Ilyichich’s shot when the score became 2-0.\n32:45 Comment: So Marcus Alonso hits the wall.\n32:49 Comment: Everything worked out for the owners.\n32:51 Comment: Well, now we’ll figure out how Inter is going to play, which doesn’t have a single central defender left on its roster.\n32:59 Comment: At the moment, we have in mind Philippe Mall and Medel, probably, will act in the center of defense.\n33:8 Comment: The efficient Palacio will certainly be drawn to midfield.\n33:12 Comment: This is already happening.\n33:14 Comment: That's where Palacio takes a position in the center and tells Peresic where Peresic should play now.\n33:21 Comment: Well, Peresic...\n33:24 Comment: Like an accordion.\n33:31 Comment: In this match the bellows were stretched out and Peresic was being driven back and forth across the field.\n33:37 Comment: Either in the sweat, then in the braces, or all over the edge.\n33:51 Comment: Like on GBE.\n33:54 Comment: Having moved the penalty area, Peresic was already running in as the center forward, but he did not get to the ball.\n34:8 Comment: Valero.\n34:14 Comment: Waszczykowski.\n34:19 Comment: Barjavalero again.\n34:21 Comment: Waszczykowski is free on the flank.\n34:26 Comment: He should be handed over.\n34:28 Comment: What happened to Kalinich?\n34:29 Comment: He falls onto the lawn.\n34:30 Comment: Partners don't notice this.\n34:32 Comment: And Waszczykowski and Barjavalero tried to create a scoring chance through a re-pass.\n34:39 Comment: But the defenders do not allow the opponent to approach the goal.\n34:45 Comment: It’s not for nothing that they show us Andrei Ranokya.\n34:48 Comment: Ranokja lost his place in the squad.\n34:49 Comment: But regularly.\n34:51 Comment: In the first matches, Ranokya came on as a substitute.\n34:54 Comment: But, of course, it was not under such circumstances that Ranokya came out.\n34:59 Comment: When Roberto Mancini released him, it was due to the need to maintain a minimal lead in the score in the last minutes.\n35:11 Comment: 4 wins 1-0.\n35:13 Comment: 1 win 2-1 at Inter.\n35:16 Comment: But now champion Teterusenu decided to help the hosts.\n35:21 Comment: When attacking, he doesn't hit the ball.\n35:24 Comment: Almost cuts off his own goal.\n35:26 Comment: Everything turned out to be a corner.\n35:32 Comment: But did it work out?\n35:35 Comment: I came across Philip Mall.\n35:37 Comment: In the last episode.\n35:40 Comment: But what is the question?\n35:41 Comment: When a team is in the minority during a set piece, of course, this numerical minority is not felt.\n35:47 Comment: This is a chance.\n35:48 Comment: Always a chance.\n35:48 Comment: Here Kandygbiya shoots at goal.\n35:51 Comment: But very much.\n35:51 Comment: Very unfortunate.\n35:59 Comment: Of course, Inter is shocked by what is happening.\n36:6 Comment: But still, this is what Mancini’s team remembered in the first matches.\n36:14 Comment: Because, after all, her character is in complete order this season.\n36:19 Comment: It looks a lot like that.\n36:21 Comment: But.\n36:27 Comment: It’s even difficult to imagine a situation where one could say that the team is holding, skillfully holding the blow.\n36:35 Comment: If the score is already 0-3.\n36:38 Comment: Opponent expelled advantage to make mistakes.\n36:41 Comment: Kandygbia.\n36:42 Comment: Ilyichich.\n36:43 Comment: I wasn't ready for this pass.\n36:45 Comment: Kalinich.\n36:51 Comment: But Badal clearly acts on his position.\n36:57 Comment: Badal makes a very good impression in this match.\n37:0 Comment: Last season there were many doubts about whether Badal was up to Ferentina's level of play.\n37:7 Comment: But in the Pao Solze team, Badal often plays as a central midfielder.\n37:17 Comment: Today is the fourth match on the right.\n37:18 Comment: Failed offline forehand pass.\n37:21 Comment: Eight minutes.\n37:22 Comment: Brings the ball out of the Rainbow defense.\n37:23 Comment: Bulashchenkovsky.\n37:26 Comment: Accurate pass to the center.\n37:50 Comment: Ilyichich.\n37:51 Comment: Kalinich.\n38:1 Comment: Loschikovsky misses the ball.\n38:4 Comment: Wowto.\n38:15 Comment: It's very difficult.\n38:17 Comment: Aminter's midfielder is in this episode.\n38:19 Comment: It was worth paying attention to Kandygbia.\n38:23 Comment: After he freed himself from the ball.\n38:26 Comment: With what relief Kandygbiya breathed a sigh of relief.\n38:29 Comment: Badal was hanging on it.\n38:32 Comment: The intro players have already made mistakes.\n38:34 Comment: So.\n38:35 Comment: A few steps ahead in this first half.\n38:37 Comment: Another mistake.\n38:46 Comment: Who needs this?\n38:48 Comment: Polazik.\n38:49 Comment: Where.\n38:53 Comment: Breaks the rules.\n38:54 Comment: Kandygbia.\n38:54 Comment: Atiyah.\n39:19 Comment: Talis serves\n39:23 Comment: Ferentina footballer fights again\n39:25 Comment: Four shots on target\n39:26 Comment: The guest suffered in this fight\n39:29 Comment: Scored three goals\n39:30 Comment: But in that situation when the score became 2-0\n39:32 Comment: There was essentially a goal scored\n39:34 Comment: After two shots on target\n39:36 Comment: So everything that Ferentina created\n39:39 Comment: In this fight\n39:40 Comment: Everything turned into goals\n39:42 Comment: And if anyone in particular\n39:44 Comment: Stick to the theory\n39:47 Comment: About the fact that the Emperor is just lucky\n39:49 Comment: At the start of the season\n39:50 Comment: Now, of course\n39:52 Comment: He thinks that now\n39:54 Comment: The emperor is given away for those\n39:56 Comment: Goals in the last seconds\n39:58 Comment: Behind the crossbars\n40:0 Comment: After being hit by an opponent\n40:1 Comment: For a little goals\n40:4 Comment: Who helped the Emperor\n40:6 Comment: Win\n40:7 Comment: In the 40th minute, Kandygbia earns\n40:10 Comment: Yellow card\n40:11 Comment: First warning as part of Imperu\n40:14 Comment: But there was already a red card\n40:16 Comment: Team Robert\n40:19 Comment: Umancini\n40:20 Comment: And it’s unlikely that they caught\n40:22 Comment: Even though his team is winning\n40:25 Comment: 3-0\n40:27 Comment: But he worries as if\n40:29 Comment: It's the other way around\n40:49 Comment: Piccolo\n40:52 Comment: Killed\n40:57 Comment: Euros PARK\n40:58 Comment: So it will be an exception\n41:0 Comment: Yesterday but Anyam\n41:2 Comment: I was switching\n41:3 Comment: Well\n41:5 Comment: For registered\n41:7 Comment: Is reading\n41:10 Comment: Okay, blow\n41:11 Comment: ッ\n41:13 Comment: He plays.\n41:15 Comment: Alexander Elisov moves to the center and hits with a turn.\n41:17 Comment: But the blow doesn't work.\n41:20 Comment: Valera and Filippo Mello immediately reprimand the Elis,\n41:23 Comment: who so freely lets Valera into the center.\n41:27 Comment: You can't do this, of course.\n41:31 Comment: One of the first commandments for a flank defender.\n41:36 Comment: Not letting your counterpart into the center, forcing him to go to the main flag.\n41:41 Comment: And then everything must be done to prevent him from being able to complete the transfer.\n41:49 Comment: There are a lot of simple mistakes like this in Baron's intro in this first half.\n41:56 Comment: It is, in fact, from these mistakes that the score is 3-0 for Ferentina.\n42:11 Comment: When Roberto Mancini worked with Manchester City in the FA Cup match at home in the derby with Manchester United.\n42:28 Comment: Mancini's team lost 0-3 in the first half.\n42:33 Comment: Then Emil scored three goals.\n42:35 Comment: We also have one yellow jock from Borka Valeru.\n42:38 Comment: Stays on the legs.\n42:39 Comment: In general, Manchiti also stayed in that match.\n42:41 Comment: There were ten left.\n42:43 Comment: But after the break, Manchester City managed to turn the tide of the game.\n42:48 Comment: And Mancini’s team scored two goals.\n42:52 Comment: All the same, here, of course, we are talking more than rudely, she played.\n42:56 Comment: Candid jump with two legs.\n42:58 Comment: 43rd minute.\n42:59 Comment: Yellow card again.\n43:3 Comment: But, in general, when the team played two goals back and still lost, they were knocked out of the FA Cup.\n43:10 Comment: Then here are your famous ones.\n43:11 Comment: The words about moral champions were spoken by Roberto Mancini.\n43:18 Comment: And the words turned out to be prophetic.\n43:21 Comment: In the end, Manchester City then won the championship based on moral and volitional strength.\n43:25 Comment: Remember Guer's goal in the last seconds of the game with Queens Park Rangers.\n43:31 Comment: But now it’s too early to talk about the outcome of the championship race in Italy.\n43:36 Comment: Well, the parallels simply suggest themselves.\n43:41 Comment: And how did Manchester City turn the tide of the match?\n43:47 Comment: Due to the fact that the team restructured into three defenders.\n43:50 Comment: Well, Manchester City really had defenders there.\n43:53 Comment: And there was someone to play in defense.\n43:55 Comment: And Manchester United, which had already slowed down, failed to react to this restructuring in the second half.\n44:3 Comment: Everything was hanging on a thin thing at the end.\n44:8 Comment: And Manchester City was close...\n44:11 Comment: to win back the derby with Manchester United.\n44:16 Comment: Ferentino has the ball 59% of the time.\n44:21 Comment: The guests, of course, have the overwhelming advantage.\n44:24 Comment: But even before the removal, the numbers were certainly in Ferentino's favor.\n44:27 Comment: Maybe not that significant.\n44:29 Comment: Another mistake.\n44:30 Comment: An error that just speaks of a state of shock.\n44:34 Comment: It will become international.\n44:35 Comment: The player who has moved throws the ball out of bounds.\n44:41 Comment: And so, as you see, Manchester United.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: Borisan scored, but Ferentino scored less quickly\n0:9 Comment: as in this match, within 19 minutes from 4 to 23 there were three holes in Barone International\n0:21 Comment: Borisan scored, but Ferentino scored less quickly\n18:51 Comment: Valera holds back her team's desire to move forward.\n18:58 Comment: The Spanish midfielder now leads the pace of Ferentina's game.\n19:4 Comment: Well, and, accordingly, affects the pace of Inter’s game.\n19:7 Comment: Inter, after Icardi Baladin played, would probably most of all want to score the second goal right there.\n19:13 Comment: And there would have already been a game of nerves and, who knows, maybe Inter would have been able to do what Roberto Manci’s Manchester City team failed to do.\n19:34 Comment: But for this you need to score a second goal.\n19:37 Comment: In the meantime, Inter is playing without the ball.\n19:39 Comment: Ferentina controls the ball very confidently.\n19:43 Comment: And it seems that the Inter players have come to terms with the fact that they will get the ball only after one of Ferentina’s players makes a mistake.\n19:54 Comment: Or one of the Ferentina players will try to escalate the game.\n19:58 Comment: And with aggravating transmissions, of course, the level of error is always higher.\n20:4 Comment: The risk of losing the ball is much higher.\n20:13 Comment: Bodel translation to the right font on Plug تع mondo.\n20:21 Comment: Well, that’s the mistake, the Ferentina players lose the ball.\n20:26 Comment: San Siro immediately bursts into applause, to which Inter will show Usajović.\n20:32 Comment: Nothing, Davide Santov immediately releases the ball.\n20:35 Comment: You sutostona, asset avertu, restoration from Mechiko under tease.\n20:37 Comment: That's it, keep locating.\n20:39 Comment: PHOENIX TOLL L gerne received PSG.\n20:41 Comment: bukan L lista.\n20:43 Comment: Yes.\n20:43 Comment: Ilyichich.\n20:48 Comment: Ilyicic failed to push the ball through.\n20:51 Comment: Kalinich.\n20:57 Comment: Yabyani.\n21:0 Comment: Anton's danger.\n21:5 Comment: Ranokia.\n21:6 Comment: Ranokia is pinched.\n21:8 Comment: Kalinich.\n21:10 Comment: Transfer to the frill Valera.\n21:11 Comment: And he failed to beat.\n21:13 Comment: Medel.\n21:14 Comment: Medelya makes an accurate pass to Yabyani.\n21:17 Comment: He throws the ball to Marcos Alonso.\n21:20 Comment: But Badali seemed to be on the safe side.\n21:24 Comment: And Ferentino’s players regain the ball.\n21:29 Comment: Wound.\n21:30 Comment: Plaschikovsky.\n21:43 Comment: It hits.\n21:48 Comment: Looking for.\n21:49 Comment: It's coming.\n21:49 Comment: Pass from Valera along the flank to Marcos Alonso.\n21:51 Comment: Here he leaves Yabyani.\n21:54 Comment: But at the same time, the football players fought so closely there,\n21:57 Comment: that I lost my balance.\n21:59 Comment: Marcos Alonso missed the ball.\n22:1 Comment: Well, the goal scored by Icardi is repeated to us once again.\n22:4 Comment: But in fact, there Badley chose to fight on the second floor of Icardi.\n22:8 Comment: Rancaria tried to stop Icardi from hitting the ball into the net.\n22:12 Comment: And he made it impossible.\n22:43 Comment: Badel\n22:46 Comment: Lesino\n22:49 Comment: Parasov tries to make his opponent make a mistake\n22:54 Comment: But this is how the Ferentina football player works with the ball so clearly\n22:57 Comment: And in the end, no, Meder did not break the rules\n23:1 Comment: He played the ball to Filippo Mello\n23:4 Comment: And here Kalinich played along with his hand\n23:10 Comment: And it looks like Nikola Kalinic gets a yellow card\n23:14 Comment: At the 69th minute the first warning for the guests\n23:19 Comment: Kalinić is the first yellow card in Italian football\n23:27 Comment: Kalinich played along, played along with himself\n23:34 Comment: And he did it deliberately\n23:36 Comment: He immediately earned a yellow card\n23:39 Comment: First card\n23:40 Comment: Ferentina substitution in the 69th minute\n23:43 Comment: Kuba Blocekowski is leaving the field.\n23:45 Comment: Instead, defender Nenatomovich\n23:52 Comment: Enters the game at number four\n23:55 Comment: The fifth match today is played by Tomovic\n23:58 Comment: The defender is capable of playing as a right central defender in a three-back formation.\n24:5 Comment: So just a right back\n24:7 Comment: Well, apparently just a right-back\n24:10 Comment: It will be now\n24:12 Comment: Tomovich, although who knows and throughout Brovka\n24:19 Comment: Venchan Simonte tricked Tomovic so\n24:22 Comment: It won't seem enough\n24:24 Comment: Well, except that Tomovic, of course, is a more defensively oriented player\n24:37 Comment: Better player who can take the ball\n24:40 Comment: But this is bad\n24:45 Comment: And offenses\n24:46 Comment: Yes\n24:47 Comment: He has it there too\n24:48 Comment: B\n25:8 Comment: And Sparrow\n25:10 Comment: Tomovich.\n25:14 Comment: Snowran Calla.\n25:30 Comment: Oh, how he played.\n25:33 Comment: Lomilan Badal.\n25:38 Comment: Ilyichich.\n25:40 Comment: Lomilan Badal.\n26:10 Comment: Who is in Italian football.\n26:21 Comment: Badal.\n26:22 Comment: Ilyichic works his body well.\n26:24 Comment: Missing the ball. Turning around.\n26:26 Comment: Valera again.\n26:28 Comment: Slows down the team's attack.\n26:30 Comment: Marko Solonza loads the ball onto Tomovic.\n26:34 Comment: And it hits with a turn.\n26:36 Comment: The best seems to be to defend.\n26:38 Comment: But Tomovic hits with aim.\n26:40 Comment: And it flies into Handanovich’s hands.\n26:43 Comment: In the 72nd minute.\n26:48 Comment: Tomovic struck with the match.\n26:52 Comment: Turning international.\n26:54 Comment: Let me remind you that last season.\n26:56 Comment: In a home match.\n26:57 Comment: When Ferentina won 3-0.\n26:59 Comment: Precisely Tomovich.\n27:0 Comment: One of the goals is a gate.\n27:2 Comment: Samir Handanovic scored.\n27:7 Comment: And last season.\n27:9 Comment: He is no one else.\n27:9 Comment: Didn't score.\n27:11 Comment: Only Inter.\n27:27 Comment: Early.\n27:29 Comment: Has time.\n27:30 Comment: Broadcast.\n27:32 Comment: Back.\n27:33 Comment: Santon attracts his rivals.\n27:36 Comment: Handanovic kicks the ball to Polasevskiy.\n27:39 Comment: Kanayka.\n27:39 Comment: Cardi and Astoric.\n27:41 Comment: They act in the same blood.\n27:44 Comment: Cardi tried to throw the ball.\n27:47 Comment: Tried to run to the gate.\n27:48 Comment: Barhovalero.\n27:49 Comment: Mikhalinchev is under siege.\n27:50 Comment: Barjovalero holds the ball.\n27:52 Comment: Now this is justified.\n27:53 Comment: Transfer to Vesina.\n27:55 Comment: Vesinu failed to get through to the opponent's goal.\n28:7 Comment: Removes the ball.\n28:8 Comment: Cardi is right there.\n28:9 Comment: He will

Footballer from Butafog, who transferred this summer.\n30:2 Comment: A football player operating on the right sideline.\n30:4 Comment: Well, everything is predictable in defense.\n30:8 Comment: Managed by Tomovic.\n30:9 Comment: Zhabata Geneor will also play on the right.\n30:12 Comment: But Rankali is already walking to the locker room with his own feet.\n30:20 Comment: Zhabata third

    "summary": "The stage was set at San Siro for what promised to be an exhilarating encounter between two renowned Italian clubs: Inter Milan and Fiorentina. As the season progressed, both teams had already demonstrated their capabilities, but anticipation was high to see how they would fare against each other in this crucial fixture.\n\nAs soon as the whistle blew, Fiorentina took control of the match right from the outset. Within the opening minutes, the visitors exhibited their ambitious intent. A noticeable change in Fiorentina's lineup included the appearances of Babacar and Rebic on the bench, with Nikola Kalinic making the starting eleven.\n\nIt didn't take long for the first consequential event to unfold. In the third minute, Fiorentina's pressure paid off when Kalinic earned a penalty after a tussle with Inter's goalkeeper, Samir Handanovic. Josip Ilicic stepped up to take the spot kick. Despite Handanovic being a renowned specialist in saving penalties, the ball found its way into the net under the crossbar, marking the Slovenian international’s first goal of the encounter. Thus, even though Handanovic had guessed the direction of the shot, Ilicic's powerful strike made it 1-0 to Fiorentina.\n\nInter's response following the initial setback was tepid. The team seemed rattled, unbalanced in their attempts to regain composure. Felipe Melo, usually pivotal in midfield, struggled against a well-organized Fiorentina side. Inter's woes compounded further when Melo earned criticism for his aggressive style of play. Efforts to stabilize the gameplay through meticulous ball control and precise passes from Melo went in vain as Fiorentina outperformed the hosts at almost every instance.\n\nThe situation worsened for Inter in the 18th minute. A sharp central run from Ilicic caused confusion in Inter’s defense. The rebound fell to Kalinic, who, in a calm and composed manner, nudged the ball into the goal, doubling Fiorentina's lead to 2-0. The quick succession of goals left Inter groggy and in dire straits much earlier than many anticipated.\n\nWith momentum heavily favoring Fiorentina, they continued to capitalize on Inter’s disarray. By the 23rd minute, Fiorentina had shocked the San Siro faithful with a third goal. A brilliant piece of play saw Marcos Alonso make an unchallenged run down the flank, linking up with Kalinic to deliver a killer pass. Kalinic, already in fine form, did not disappoint as he registered his second goal, making it 3-0. This remarkable start underscored Fiorentina's dominance and precision in dismantling Inter's defense.\n\nDespite being three goals down, Inter tried to muster a fightback. But their efforts were sporadic and lacked the necessary coordination. On the contrary, Fiorentina's combination play and tactical organization were evident as they controlled the tempo and flow of the game efficiently.\n\nAs the first half neared its end, Inter’s troubles continued to mount when Miranda received a red card in the 31st minute, reducing the Nerazzurri to ten men. This dismissal was for a foul on Kalinic, who had proved to be a constant menace. The Croatian striker’s sharp movements and intelligent positioning continuously exposed Inter’s defensive frailties.\n\nFielding one man fewer exacerbated Inter's plight as it became increasingly challenging to counter Fiorentina’s unrelenting pressure. Even with numerical superiority, the visitors maintained their discipline, ensuring minimal errors.\n\nAfter the interval, Inter returned to the pitch with a renewed sense of urgency. However, Fiorentina strategically slowed the game, emphasizing possession-based play and ensuring Inter had limited opportunities to regain momentum. Borja Valero, in particular, played a vital role in orchestrating plays from the middle, guiding the tempo in favor of the visitors.\n\nInter’s brief glimmers of hope came in fleeting moments, such as Mauro Icardi’s goal—one that showed his clinical finishing ability. But even this did not shake Fiorentina’s confidence. The visitors managed their lead with maturity and maintained control over the proceedings.\n\nIn the 69th minute, Inter’s frustration and desperation were palpable. Various attempts to bridge the deficit were met with stout resistance from Fiorentina’s backline. It was also during this period that Nikola Kalinic earned a yellow card—a minor blemish in his otherwise stellar performance.\n\nThe tactical adjustments by Fiorentina’s coach, Pablo Sousa, came into effect with substitutions such as the inclusion of Nenad Tomovic, transitioning from a forward setup to a more defensive configuration. Tomovic played competently upon his introduction, adding further assurance to the backline.\n\nAs Inter appeared to inch closer through sporadic moments of creativity, Fiorentina delivered the final blow in the 76th minute. Execution of an intelligent counter-attack saw Ilicic laying the ball to Kalinic, who completed his hat-trick with aplomb. This made the scoreline 4-1 and further underscored Fiorentina’s superiority. Kalinic’s hat-trick was a testament to his finishing prowess and relentless work rate throughout the match.\n\nAs the clock wound down, both teams made more substitutions, predominantly tactical maneuvers to manage the game’s remaining minutes. However, the match's outcome was no longer in doubt. Fiorentina’s steadfast defense and composure in attack had decided the game much earlier in the half. Late-game scenarios saw few significant chances as Fiorentina focused on retaining their lead and Inter struggled in vain to find any consolation.\n\nThe comprehensive victory was illustrative of Fiorentina's capabilities and tactical acumen. Souza had out-thought Mancini tactically, and Kalinic was a constant thorn in Inter's side. This result was not just demoralizing for Inter but also a statement of intent from Fiorentina, elevating their ambitions in the Serie A standings.\n\nAs the final whistle blew, Fiorentina's celebrations were well-deserved. They played with vigor, coherence, and tactical precision, all of which contributed to a resounding 4-1 triumph at San Siro. On the other hand, Inter, the league leaders till this point, had to introspect and recalibrate their strategies moving forward. Such comprehensive defeats expose weaknesses that require immediate redress.\n\nThus, the match may well be remembered for Kalinic’s hat-trick and Fiorentina’s tactical masterclass. The victory gave Fiorentina not just three points but significant moral and psychological boosts, while for Inter, it was a harsh yet perhaps necessary reality check amidst an otherwise promising season. Such encounters often shape the forthcoming narrative of the league, leaving fans and pundits alike to ponder the eventual title race and Champions League qualifications."
