There has been more to see on the pitch than in most of the other games. Inter were dominant and more threatening of the two sides. It was a fairly one-sided match. It was obvious that the hosts tried to outplay their opponents with some passing football, while the visitors focused on counter-attacking play.\n    \n\n    #######TASK \n    Provide a factually correct and detailed textual description of the game compiled from the information presented above from different sources, in more than 1000 words.\n            \"Cap:\": represents the captions published in the online portal usually within 30 seconds of the event.\n            \"E:\" represents events recorded exactly after the event happened.\n    Don't mention sources of information like commentators or captions, write as if you saw them live.\n    \n    ",
    "summary": "Inter Milan secured an emphatic 4-0 victory over Frosinone in a match that showcased their dominance from the first whistle to the last. The fixture, held at their home ground, saw Inter display a superior performance both in terms of ball possession and chances created, leaving their opponents with little room to impose themselves.\n\nAs the game commenced with the kick-off by Inter, it was immediately evident that the hosts were keen to assert their dominance. Within the first few seconds, the ball briefly went out of play, but Inter quickly regained control and launched their first attack. A shot off target in the very first minute hinted at Inter's attacking intentions. \n\nThe game saw frequent interruptions in the initial minutes with several throw-ins, mainly by Inter, illustrating consistent pressure from the home side. A corner for Inter in the second minute marked the team's first real opportunity to cash in on their attacking play, but a shot off target directly resulted from it. The early exchanges saw Frosinone struggling to get a foothold; their attempts at countering Inter's fluid play were thwarted either by going out of play or being intercepted.\n\nIn the sixth minute, Frosinone had their first notable action when they registered two shots on target in quick succession, the latter necessitating a clearance by Inter's defense. Yet, it did not take long for Inter to regain control and continue their dominance. A subsequent series of throw-ins and another shot off target for Inter kept the pressure alive.\n\nInter's breakthrough came in a flurry of activity. By the 15th minute, a poignant moment occurred when Stevan Jovetic's weaving run concluded with a powerful shot, which was brilliantly saved by Frosinone's Nicola Leali. This epitomized the frustrations for Inter, who were being kept at bay by some resolute defending and goalkeeping.\n\nHowever, it wasn't long until Inter translated their superiority into goals. Alex Nicolao Telles crafted an opportunity from the edge of the penalty area, but it was Jonathan Biabiany who capitalized on a rebound inside the box to rifle the ball home in the 29th minute, putting Inter 1-0 up. This goal crystallized Inter's assertive play and Biabiany's perfect positioning.\n\nThe remainder of the first half saw several more opportunities for both teams, but it was Inter who remained predominantly in control. Another notable chance for Inter came when Adem Ljajic unleashed a terrific long-range shot that went close to the crossbar, symbolizing the constant threat posed by the home side. Despite Frosinone's efforts, including a few attempts at goal, they were unable to breach Inter's defense.\n\nThe second half began with Frosinone kicking off, but it quickly became apparent that Inter's dominance would continue. Within the first minute, Inter once again took control, and Jonathan Biabiany narrowly missed the target with a strike from inside the box that sailed over the crossbar. The early moments mirrored the first half with consistent pressure from Inter, reflected in several more shots and blocked efforts.\n\nIn the 8th minute of the second half, Mauro Icardi capitalized on an assist from Adem Ljajic, tapping the ball into an open net to extend Inter's lead to 2-0. This goal exemplified Inter's precision and ability to exploit spaces within Frosinone’s defense.\n\nSubsequent minutes highlighted the relentless pressure applied by Inter, as Frosinone were forced to defend wave after wave of attacks. The visitors, while opting for a more defensive approach, found themselves cornered and unable to effectuate significant counter-attacks. Inter's defense, led by players such as Miranda and Alex Telles, ensured Frosinone's offensive forays were comfortably dealt with.\n\nBy the hour mark, further substitutions were made. Andrea Ranocchia replaced Yuto Nagatomo for Inter, demonstrating Roberto Mancini's strategy to provide fresh legs and sustain defensive solidity. Frosinone also made several changes to try and invigorate their side, although it failed to shift the momentum in their favor.\n\nAnother major highlight came in the 42nd minute of the second half when Jeison Murillo, benefitting from a precise pass by Stevan Jovetic, coolly slotted the ball into the net, making it 3-0. The ease with which Inter dissected Frosinone’s defense was a testament to their tactical superiority.\n\nLate into the match, an impactful moment occurred when Marcelo Brozovic, coming on as a substitute for Mauro Icardi, showed exceptional composure inside the box. Assisted by Adem Ljajic, he fired into the left side of the net in injury time, capping off a dominant performance with a fourth goal.\n\nThroughout the match, Inter's tactical approach was clear—they sought to maintain high possession with a focus on attacking football while preventing Frosinone from developing any sustainable play. The home team’s cohesive passing, dynamic wing play, and solid midfield coordination played crucial roles in their victory.\n\nThe statistics from the match underscored Inter's dominance with a significant possession advantage of 64% to 36% and a remarkable number of shots. Despite several efforts by Frosinone, totaling 12 attempts, none posed a significant threat to Inter’s resolute defense.\n\nFrosinone's approach, focused on counter-attacking, was stymied by Inter's well-organized defense and quick transitions. The visitors' inability to convert their limited opportunities into goals further illustrated the gap in quality between the two sides.\n\nThe 4-0 victory not only highlighted Inter's attacking prowess but also their defensive capabilities, ensuring a clean sheet. Jonathan Biabiany, Mauro Icardi, Jeison Murillo, and Marcelo Brozovic all found the net, reflecting the team’s collective effort and clinical finishing.
