maybe a little strict guide\n10:0 Comment: Yes, I also had the impression that it wasn't such a foul\n10:3 Comment: so harsh as to deserve ammunition\n10:6 Comment: perhaps the vehemence, the violence of the blow was punished\n10:11 Comment: he went looking for the ball\n10:13 Comment: there was Icardi's leg and foot in front\n10:15 Comment: probably just revised the driving provision\n10:19 Comment: Stellone's indication\n10:21 Comment: who was an excellent striker as a footballer\n10:26 Comment: someone who with his means perhaps could have done something more\n10:29 Comment: good

Ilaic\n10:38 Comment: relaunch of Diachite broken down\n10:40 Comment: throws ball into side ball\n10:42 Comment: it was a good opportunity for Jovetic\n10:43 Comment: It's strange that he didn't control a relatively easy ball well\n10:47 Comment: because the Frosinone defender anyway\n10:48 Comment: it wasn't really attached\n10:50 Comment: he had given him the space to do so\n10:52 Comment: Jovetic, ball vertically looking for Icardi\n10:54 Comment: Diachite closed\n10:55 Comment: Inter insists with Ilaic\n10:58 Comment: with Dobia\n11:0 Comment: Telles\n11:2 Comment: he has two in front\n11:3 Comment: look for the flicker, turn on the double step\n11:4 Comment: it's the cross that passes\n11:6 Comment: ball blocked\n11:7 Comment: then Murillo's pressure\n11:10 Comment: disordered torment, foul by Murillo\n11:12 Comment: good at earning a free kick Castilla\n11:14 Comment: let's go to Andrea Paventi on the sidelines\n11:16 Comment: for Mancini the team must remain very goalscoring\n11:18 Comment: with this arrangement the team can often lose its superiority in midfield\n11:22 Comment: then the attackers must be good at falling back\n11:24 Comment: to lend a hand\n11:25 Comment: Biabiani is doing it well\n11:26 Comment: a little less Icardi who was recalled a couple of times\n11:29 Comment: the player needs to shake himself for a moment\n11:30 Comment: because he serves for the conclusion of the action\n11:33 Comment: but he must lend a hand in the non-possession phase\n11:35 Comment: Sodimus\n11:38 Comment: clash with Dobia\n11:40 Comment: Sodimus committed the foul\n11:41 Comment: free kick in favor of Inter\n11:43 Comment: I don't think there is a tactical problem for Inter's midfielders\n11:48 Comment: Frosinone probably after a fearful start\n11:53 Comment: instead he surprised Inter with this attacking attitude\n11:56 Comment: why Sodimo and Paganini when their teammates are in possession of the ball\n12:0 Comment: they go to deal with the Inter full-backs\n12:2 Comment: they create this numerical parity\n12:4 Comment: which force Mancini's defense to lower\n12:6 Comment: for this reason the team does not remain short enough\n12:10 Comment: with Nangatomo hands\n12:12 Comment: Biabiani\n12:14 Comment: they control the player\n12:16 Comment: I control the player\n12:21 Comment: control and the shot goes off with his left foot\n12:24 Comment: distant ball to Leali's goal\n12:26 Comment: However, Inter managed to create potentially dangerous situations with great ease\n12:31 Comment: here too with Dobia he had time to check it twice\n12:34 Comment: look at the first check it's not perfect\n12:36 Comment: and it widens slightly slightly too much\n12:40 Comment: and then not\n12:42 Comment: he doesn't kick as well as he could have but it was a good opportunity\n12:44 Comment: from that distance\n12:48 Comment: Leali's ariancio\n12:50 Comment: After surgery\n12:57 Comment: About Jovetic\n13:0 Comment: Then he goes to get the ball back with Dobbia\n13:2 Comment: Nagatomo\n13:3 Comment: With Dobbia\n13:3 Comment: Philip Emelo\n13:4 Comment: He was looking for verticalization for Icardi\n13:7 Comment: Ball that doesn't pass by Frosinone\n13:8 Comment: Paganini\n13:9 Comment: Intervention on Filippo Emelo's ball\n13:11 Comment: It was very close driving\n13:12 Comment: Telles\n13:15 Comment: Jaic\n13:15 Comment: Try starting at the Iaic\n13:18 Comment: He suffers opposition from Rosi\n13:21 Comment: Who earns the throw-in with his hands\n13:23 Comment: Castillo\n13:25 Comment: Rose\n13:25 Comment: Diachite\n13:27 Comment: The ball returns to Leali's area\n13:32 Comment: Telles on Paganini\n13:39 Comment: In Castillo's control\n13:42 Comment: He attacks him with Dobbia\n13:44 Comment: On Bentragogli\n13:45 Comment: Paganini\n13:46 Comment: Because Paganini can't arrive\n13:47 Comment: Paganini clearly does not have the same physical structure as Daniel Ciofani\n13:52 Comment: But he is very good in the air\n13:54 Comment: In fact, very often both Leali and the defenders look for him on that side\n13:58 Comment: Because compared to Telles he can get the better of high balls\n14:3 Comment: We are in the fifteenth minute of the first half\n14:5 Comment: Andanovic's Ariancione\n14:7 Comment: Arrives in the Paganini area\n14:9 Comment: Paganini\n14:10 Comment: It's a very fair game\n14:12 Comment: Paganini\n14:13 Comment: It's a very fair game\n14:14 Comment: Paganini\n14:14 Comment: It arrives in the Biabiani area\n14:16 Comment: The test at the Blanchard socket\n14:18 Comment: Soddimo stopped\n14:19 Comment: Biabiani\n14:20 Comment: Filippo Emelo in the fall manages to turn the ball over for Jovetic\n14:23 Comment: The Montenegrin defends the ball with elegance\n14:26 Comment: Then turn towards Condobbia\n14:27 Comment: He can stretch out on the left at Inter\n14:28 Comment: Where Telles is climbing\n14:30 Comment: Paganini immediately goes to cover\n14:32 Comment: Condobbia\n14:33 Comment: Telles shot\n14:33 Comment: He wants the ball back\n14:36 Comment: Rosi has the advantage\n14:37 Comment: The ball then stays there\n14:40 Comment:

by Inter\n14:49 Comment: Jovetic\n14:50 Comment: One on one with Gori\n14:54 Comment: Jovetic again\n14:56 Comment: Try the shot\n14:58 Comment: It stretches and has no problem blocking its wings\n15:0 Comment: When Inter attacks Frosinone's defense\n15:2 Comment: It crushes a lot\n15:3 Comment: Even with the midfielders\n15:5 Comment: Almost on the edge of the penalty area\n15:6 Comment: There is room to shoot from medium range\n15:9 Comment: Especially for the two midfielders\n15:11 Comment: Here Jovetic tried\n15:12 Comment: But Condobbia and Filippo Emelo\n15:13 Comment: They always have a lot of time\n15:14 Comment: And plenty of space to shoot from 20 metres\n15:44 Comment: In position on the field\n15:45 Comment: They even seem made to play together\n15:47 Comment: Let's say Palacio like movements\n15:51 Comment: He also does them according to his department partner\n15:55 Comment: Jovetic does them mostly to receive the ball himself\n15:57 Comment: But Jovetic is also a player who moves a lot\n16:0 Comment: I tell you the truth about this incompatibility\n16:2 Comment: I do not see her\n16:6 Comment: It overlooks Frosinone\n16:8 Comment: Rosi tries to leave by force\n16:10 Comment: Rosi's cross was good\n16:11 Comment: Ball in the middle\n16:11 Comment: The Ciofani bank\n16:13 Comment: Then the attempt\n16:13 Comment: In acrobatics\n16:14 Comment: From Soddimo\n16:15 Comment: It's a good Frosinone though when he attacks\n16:17 Comment: Here Soddimo perhaps took the ball away from Paganini\n16:21 Comment: here you see\n16:22 Comment: There is the companion who would arrive\n16:24 Comment: The way of hitting the ball was certainly more comfortable\n16:28 Comment: Then Soddimo's first volley\n16:30 Comment: He showed us qualities in coordination\n16:33 Comment: Even in acrobatics\n16:34 Comment: Really important\n16:37 Comment: But perhaps Paganini was more comfortable here\n16:39 Comment: Nenzo Niandanovic\n16:44 Comment:

Comment: Towards Cardi\n17:7 Comment: Then pay attention because there was an intervention by Blanchard\n17:10 Comment: Let's put it this way\n17:12 Comment: A little naughty\n17:13 Comment: Which should also be revised\n17:15 Comment: Telles\n17:16 Comment: A block on the attacker that goes to the goalkeeper\n17:18 Comment: He also did it previously\n17:20 Comment: Farther from the ball out of frame\n17:22 Comment: But it is precisely his way of preventing the attacker\n17:25 Comment: To get to the goalkeeper quickly when there is a back pass\n17:28 Comment: Naga Tomo\n17:29 Comment: He doesn't pass the ball\n17:31 Comment: It is also used for coverage in Soddimo obviously\n17:33 Comment: Stallone wants a lot of his offensive wingers\n17:36 Comment: Even in the non-possession

back\n18:17 Comment: The Frenchman again, but here he sensationally misses the control\n18:24 Comment: Yes, a technical error here\n18:25 Comment: He was probably already watching the action develop\n18:28 Comment: Not giving the necessary attention to control\n18:33 Comment: But less involved than Biabiani\n18:36 Comment: Compared to what happens on the other side\n18:39 Comment: He's a player who has never had the chance to play a game around\n18:41 Comment: Here he fit in well but there was excellent coverage from Blanchard\n18:46 Comment: Throw-in in the attacking zone for Inter\n18:48 Comment: We are in the nineteenth minute of the first half\n18:50 Comment: 0-0 San Siro\n18:51 Comment: With the hands Naga Tomo\n18:53 Comment: He came closer by moving the Aic from the

well\n19:15 Comment: In this case he attempted a right-footed shot\n19:18 Comment: With the ball in front almost more moved for a left-footed kick\n19:22 Comment: Rather than right-handed\n19:24 Comment: Inter could have exploited it better\n19:26 Comment: Which has many potential opportunities\n19:28 Comment: Even if he hasn't created any real scoring opportunities yet\n19:32 Comment: But he

Half:\n0:0 Comment: Fiscal Guida starts again. Blanchard, ball for Soddimo.\n0:8 Comment: Crivella immediately went into an overlap, Soddimo ignored it, vertically for Ciofani.\n0:14 Comment: Miranda, Blanchard's advance, understood everything.\n0:20 Comment: Miranda again, South American duel with Castillo, Fosinone ball.\n0:25 Comment: Soddimo invokes the suggestion inside the penalty area Ciofani, Soddimo ignores it\n0:29 Comment: and look for an unprovable personal solution. Stopped, Inter can start on the counterattack\n0:33 Comment: with the speed of Biabiani, followed by Gori. Biabiani insists, the route, great acceleration\n0:37 Comment: of the French. Biabiani again, Icardi, Biabiani!\n0:42 Comment: The stadium at the feet of the Frenchman, who made a great, great acceleration here.\n0:48 Comment: He arrived tired, then Icardi was very good, going to help him.\n0:52 Comment: Gone to make this ball playable again after the second dribble.\n0:56 Comment: Here he is, he moves the ball for him to kick, he tries with the ball, with first intention.\n1:1 Comment: We're already on the other side Tellers, good clearance on Andanovic.\n1:9 Comment: Murillo, Andanovic, Murillo.\n1:19 Comment: As I know, Castillo does it, miming what in his opinion was a dive from his opponent.\n1:25 Comment: Miranda.\n1:30 Comment: Nagatomo, Filippo Emelo, Nagatomo.\n1:39 Comment: Castillo anticipated by Nagatomo's good coverage.\n1:42 Comment: Paganini, San Marco.\n1:45 Comment: By Achiti.\n1:50 Comment: There's that shot by Paganini, closing Tellers.\n1:56 Comment: The Brazilian's throw in Icardi's area takes Blanchard away.\n2:0 Comment: Filippo Emelo heads it, he turns it for Jovetic, Icardi takes a position, Jovetic looks for him.\n2:4 Comment: The ball too much on the goal and the wings makes it slip away.\n2:10 Comment: Not good, in fact I would say bad, this attempted assist by Jovetic who had plenty of time to think about it and execute it.\n2:17 Comment: He hit the ball really badly for a player with his technical characteristics.\n2:21 Comment: This is a fairly trivial mistake, in my opinion.\n2:25 Comment: Return of driving for him.\n2:28 Comment: Miranda sits down irregularly, smiles, no protests from the Brazilian, accepts the referee's decision.\n2:36 Comment: Miranda is playing a game of great concentration, he doesn't want to allow even a meter of tension.\n2:43 Comment: He tries to break through Crivello, Filippo Emelo is invaluable in coverage and takes refuge in a corner kick.\n2:49 Comment: He moves ahead in the corners count, 4 against 3 beaten by Inter.\n2:52 Comment: Third a minute after the restart, Inter have a 1-0 lead.\n2:55 Comment: Filippo Emelo grew as the match went on, in my opinion he started a little subdued.\n2:59 Comment: Then he made himself useful above all in this role as a holding midfielder.\n3:9 Comment: He interrupted several Frosinone actions, especially on the centre-right.\n3:13 Comment: He's ready to play another game, it's not another one.\n3:15 Comment: Subtitles and review by QTSS\n3:45 Comment: Crivello, with another match, had another choice.\n3:48 Comment: Inter was at risk in the previous situation.\n3:51 Comment: Remember Morissi, even in the first half, Icardi posted at the near post.\n3:54 Comment: Here we review the contact with Dogbia.\n4:1 Comment: Here he is, he posted at the near post, instead of going with the inside foot, he wants to kick hard with his neck and doesn't hit the ball well.\n4:8 Comment: And here he even risked ending up in his own door.\n4:15 Comment: It is risked, especially by Idan Danovic.\n4:20 Comment: Castillo's sprint, speed duel with Murillo.\n4:24 Comment: The pressure from the Colombian defender leads to an error in the control phase of Castillo.\n4:28 Comment: Inter gains and throws in with their hands.\n4:31 Comment: Castillo is very generous, still a little immature, at least from what we saw in these first 50 minutes.\n4:37 Comment: Contact with Dogbia.\n4:40 Comment: Pre-recover the San Marco ball.\n4:44 Comment: He looks for the inclusion of Paganini, Murillo closes.\n4:47 Comment: Paganini is about to steal the ball from Murillo in some way.\n4:50 Comment: Then San Marco also arrives, series of rebounds, Paganini.\n4:54 Comment: He can't break through to the right.\n4:57 Comment: Then the Ljajic defensive rebound.\n5:0 Comment: Ball on Rosi.\n5:2 Comment: Contact with Dogbia, everything normal.\n5:4 Comment: Let the referee play.\n5:5 Comment: Murillo's rebirth, finds Jovetic ready.\n5:8 Comment: Less ready at the meeting time Ljajic.\n5:11 Comment: It could be a good opportunity on the counterattack for Inter.\n5:14 Comment: With his hands Gori looking for Paganini.\n5:17 Comment: Telles closes again.\n5:20 Comment: Foul by the Brazilian.\n5:22 Comment: Paganini down, free kick.\n5:25 Comment: Frosinone is putting everything it has into it.\n5:28 Comment: More intensity than that of the first half, the desire to change the game in this respect.\n5:32 Comment: In terms of rhythm.\n5:35 Comment: Inter need a midfielder who can handle the ball.\n5:38 Comment: At the moment he is suffering too much from this offensive attempt by Frosinone.\n5:44 Comment: He doesn't handle the ball when he comes into possession and this can be a problem.\n5:48 Comment: Soddimo always takes the free kick.\n5:50 Comment: Frosinone with five players to miss.\n5:53 Comment: Part Soddimo.\n5:55 Comment: He put out Felipe Melo.\n5:57 Comment: Gori, ball on the left.\n5:59 Comment: Try the bed.\n6:0 Comment: Double detour.\n6:2 Comment: Ciofani's second could create some problems for Andanovic.\n6:6 Comment: Inter now space out on the counterattack.\n6:8 Comment: Frosinone's defense is very good.\n6:10 Comment: Launches Iovatic to look for Icardi and Gajic.\n6:12 Comment: Look for Icardi control.\n6:14 Comment: He only partially succeeds in supporting Gajic.\n6:17 Comment: Icardi's attack was good.\n6:19 Comment: Send vote Soddimo.\n6:21 Comment: Icardi can enter the area.\n6:23 Comment: Ball for Gajic.\n6:25 Comment: Gajic reaches for the ball.\n6:27 Comment: And then he can't find it anymore.\n6:28 Comment: The player had to make sure he could control the ball first.\n6:32 Comment: There was no space.\n6:34 Comment: Frosinone always has many players protecting its penalty area.\n6:37 Comment: Telles.\n6:39 Comment: Ball in the middle.\n6:41 Comment: Icardi anticipates that he didn't believe in it enough.\n6:43 Comment: We start again with the throw-in in favor of Inter.\n6:45 Comment: 6 minutes 45 seconds into

distance.\n7:25 Comment: The advantage to the referee.\n7:27 Comment: Stopped with double.\n7:29 Comment: Iovetich.\n7:31 Comment: Gajic.\n7:33 Comment: Look for the 1-2.\n7:35 Comment: Gajic.\n7:37 Comment: Icardi.\n7:39 Comment: Inter's attacks!\n7:41 Comment: Goal of technique and speed.\n7:43 Comment: Putting what they have in their hands into play.\n7:46 Comment: In their characteristics.\n7:48 Comment: Two Inter forwards.\n7:50 Comment: A nice double exchange.\n7:51 Comment: The ball passed from one to the other's feet with a speed that prevented any kind of\n7:57 Comment: counter-move by the defense\n8:0 Comment: I repeat, taken at speed a little static perhaps in this circumstance but the difference in class on the pitch was visible\n8:9 Comment: It's Icardi who scores the first 1-2 then goes to resume\n8:14 Comment: Ljajic's assistance, Blanchard remains in the middle, Di Achite is unable to intervene\n8:18 Comment: and the closure of Crivello cannot arrive in time\n8:24 Comment: For the first time in this championship, the seventh match at San Siro, Inter scores more than one goal at home\n8:29 Comment: Icardi's doubling 2-0\n8:33 Comment: To play\n8:36 Comment: 37 minutes plus injury time, we go to protocampo Paventi\n8:39 Comment: Roberto Mancini's compliments to Ljajic when he passed because for Inter to judge the best on the pitch\n8:46 Comment: He appreciated many things about his team in the first half too, this is Ljajic's second assist for Icardi, the first was in Bologna\n8:55 Comment: Miranda\n8:58 Comment: Gori, San Marco\n9:3 Comment: very advanced Crivello, Soddimo\n9:6 Comment: Crivello leads them with an opponent who overlapped, Soddimo tries to centralize, Gori\n9:11 Comment: San Marco, invokes Paganini in the ball, Acciofani in the area, vertical ball for Acciofani\n9:16 Comment: more concerned with freeing himself from Murillo's marking than going to the ball in the end\n9:21 Comment: recovers with Faccio Di Tandanovic\n9:23 Comment: it was Murillo's movement, it seemed like a\n9:26 Comment: scorer of my time, who doesn't worry about getting to the ball but only that the attacker isn't able to get there\n9:34 Comment: The Colombian is really good at these defensive readings\n9:38 Comment: Icardi's pressure is effective, the throw-in for Inter, tenth minute of the second half, Inter leading 2-0 at San Siro over Frosinone\n9:54 Comment: Filippo Emelo, Nagatomo, Miranda\n10:1 Comment: Murillo, Telles\n10:3 Comment: Paganini, Paganini can sink, Telles proposes himself inside the penalty area, suggests the pass, Jovetic ignores it, looks centrally, the shot goes\n10:15 Comment: great action but hacci hits badly\n10:19 Comment: Yes, he hit it badly, this play had no other defects because he freed himself with the right time, he controlled it well because the ball\n10:27 Comment: Even though it wasn't low to the ground, it still had just enough bounce to hit it with more force\n10:32 Comment: he probably had the pass for Bébé Ni but from that position Maurizio was also trying to shoot on goal\n10:42 Comment: Di Testai di Achite, Filippo Emelo, Bébé Ni, Miranda\n10:52 Comment: At times there has been discussion about the level of entertainment provided by Inter, if we look at this evening's line-up when you have people in front of you with the creativity of Gli Haicci and Jovetic, the same Cario and also Bébé Ni, it is clear that this evening, in short, some we saw some great action\n11:12 Comment: Perhaps the excessive criticism of Inter also depends on this because we know the technical ability of its players\n11:42 Comment: I'm doing a good job covering Teles who was a bit resentful when he was presented as a player who was very good at pushing but decidedly vulnerable in the defensive phase\n11:56 Comment: Teles almost got angry when he remembered that at Galatasaray he wasn't bad at all in the defensive phase, after all he had also sometimes played as a central defender in Brazil\n12:6 Comment: Also because it has the liveliest player of Frosinone's four attackers, Paganini\n12:36 Comment: Acciofani stopped, Soddimo arrives, chest control by Soddimo, he accompanies Acciofani on the left, Castillo centrally, Paganini is also arriving, Soddimo does everything alone surrounded by opponents, doesn't get rid of the ball and in the end suffers the crowding of Felipe Melo\n12:50 Comment: Free kick for Frosinone with Soddimo waiting for the jumpers to arrive on the edge of Inter's penalty area\n13:10 Comment: Paganini, Diakite and Blanchard\n13:16 Comment: Icardi again\n13:26 Comment: Andanovic failed to avoid the corner kick, sixth corner for Frosinone who has the merit of still believing in it and not giving up\n13:31 Comment: Let's see, yes, the ball was completely out\n13:37 Comment: The small area in front of Andanovic was very crowded\n13:43 Comment: Always Satisfied by the flag\n13:47 Comment: Dirty intervention, this time by Miranda\n13:51 Comment: Crested ball inside the penalty area, turned in the middle, watch out Castillo, Murillo sacrificed himself\n13:53 Comment: And this is a great opportunity because the possibility for an attacker to receive the ball on the penalty puck with space, mind you\n13:59 Comment: Already taken the corner, Rosi, charges the right Rosi, looks for the conclusion with a spin\n14:5 Comment: The ball ends up far from Andanovic's goal\n14:9 Comment: Rosi's wasn't turned enough, Castillo's probably kicked it with the arrival of Andanovic\n14:15 Comment: It's quite a spin, the ball is far away\n14:23 Comment: Rosi's shot didn't turn enough, Castillo's shot was probably kicked as he pleased\n14:29 Comment: Trying to kick hard into the face of goal, Murillo performed a miracle because he actually blocked a shot without fail\n14:39 Comment: Fusiliana's reaction worries Mancini a bit and he reinforces his ties\n14:41 Comment: The full-back is out, the full-back is out, a full-back who pushes like Nagatomo\n14:45 Comment: Inside a central defender like Ranocchia\n14:49 Comment: And Murillo goes to play right back\n14:53 Comment: Unless Inter intend to defend with three, this could be a solution\n14:59 Comment: If Teles advances its position, it could be let's see\n15:3 Comment: Or 4-3-3 with Murillo as full-back\n15:5 Comment: Or 3-5-2 with Teles taller\n15:7 Comment: The whole is around, the whole is around\n15:9 Comment: Iovetich\n15:11 Comment: Filippo Emelo loses the ball\n15:13 Comment: San Marco, Ciofani, Castillo\n15:15 Comment: Vertical looking for Soddimo\n15:17 Comment: Closing header\n15:19 Comment: A great choice of time\n15:23 Comment: Liaic on the left\n15:25 Comment: Teles\n15:27 Comment: Ball for Liaic\n15:31 Comment: San Marco directly into a lateral foul\n15:37 Comment: Luca Romagnolo\n15:49 Comment: Romagnolo Teles, sixteenth of the second half\n15:55 Comment: Icardi defends the ball\n15:57 Comment: From Diakite's advance attack\n15:59 Comment: He attacks him\n16:1 Comment: Liaic\n16:3 Comment: Icardi\n16:7 Comment: Liaic\n16:9 Comment: Icardi\n16:11 Comment: Foul by Paganini\n16:13 Comment: On Teles\n16:19 Comment: Warned\n16:21 Comment: The Frosinone hairpin\n16:23 Comment: But still a ball played\n16:25 Comment: With little\n16:27 Comment: In other words, little attention\n16:29 Comment: From Condogbia\n16:31 Comment: That he can do better than what he did today\n16:33 Comment: In my opinion\n16:35 Comment: Between Paganin and Murillo are talking\n16:37 Comment: But it remains a 4-man defense\n16:39 Comment: Teles plays fullback on the left\n16:41 Comment: And Murillo plays fullback on the right\n16:43 Comment: Liaic\n16:45 Comment: Teles\n16:47 Comment: Jovetic\n16:49 Comment: Liaic\n16:53 Comment: They look for each other and find each other\n16:55 Comment: Jovetic and Liaic with great ease\n16:57 Comment: Partly because they speak the same technical language\n16:59 Comment: Maybe because the times of Fiorentina are known very well\n17:1 Comment: Biabiani\n17:5 Comment: His attempted cross was deflected and the fourth corner kick arrived for Inter, with 7 of them beating Frosinone.\n17:10 Comment: For Bebianì it is essential to receive the ball like this, now here he has attempted the cross but can also opt to aim at the opponent\n17:17 Comment: because it has the space to pick up speed, right? When Crivello is far away from him as in this case.\n17:26 Comment: From the flag to the Aic.\n17:36 Comment: Ball for Jovetic who looked for acrobatics.\n17:43 Comment: A foul was called, probably a block.\n17:46 Comment: And that one here, yes, yes, yes.\n17:47 Comment: Ricardi, a lob.\n17:48 Comment: Very right.\n17:51 Comment: And here instead Mancini...\n17:53 Comment: He made the wrong cleats.\n17:54 Comment: Well yes.\n17:56 Comment: And he rightly laughs at it.\n17:58 Comment: Nice recovery from Bebianì.\n18:5 Comment: Frog.\n18:9 Comment: Head towards San Marco.\n18:10 Comment: Castillo.\n18:15 Comment: He widens for Rosi.\n18:16 Comment: It forces coverage on the AICs.\n18:20 Comment: Rosi coordinates for lacrosse, puts her in the middle.\n18:22 Comment: Cioffani empty.\n18:24 Comment: Ball controlled with some excitement by Murillo.\n18:26 Comment: Ball at the limit again for Gori who can go into percussion.\n18:29 Comment: Stopped.\n18:30 Comment: Inter

Jovetic, back heel for Murillo\n41:17 Comment: Great action, great football, 3-0\n41:19 Comment: After three or four fairly banal errors here Jovetic puts his teammate down with a heel strike\n41:26 Comment: in the condition of kicking from 5 meters only in front of the wings, Inter's third goal was in the air\n41:32 Comment: He had several opportunities for Mancini's team even before, with a lot of space given by Frosinone\n41:37 Comment: in a generous attempt to reopen the game but is really leaving Stellone's team with too many spaces for Inter\n41:49 Comment: We will see Jovetic's backheel which puts Murillo in a position to kick with the inside foot from 6-7 meters\n41:57 Comment: Here it is, Jovetic's cut who then backheels gives Murillo the chance to score an easy goal\n42:5 Comment: Maybe the comparison would be irreverent but as a development of the action it reminds a little, I repeat I don't want the comparison to be too irreverent\n42:14 Comment: Inter's opening goal against Barcelona was never scored with the development of the action being identical, a full-back also scored there\n42:20 Comment: Here Murillo is playing full back, but it was a great action, maybe the comparison is exaggerated but it was a great action\n42:26 Comment: You have to give me the four players\n42:27 Comment: Yes, unfortunately I decided on them first, I didn't put Murillo there\n42:31

    "summary": "On a brisk evening at San Siro, Inter Milan presented a display of dominance as they triumphed over Frosinone with an emphatic 4-0 victory. The match showcased a blend of tactical superiority, individual brilliance, and collective determination from Roberto Mancini's side.\n\nThe game began with a keenly observed detail that club captain Mauro Icardi seemed to be struggling at the start of the season compared to his scintillating form from the previous year. Regardless of the teammate Mancini paired him with, Icardi just hadn't yet regained his previous season's prowess. Nevertheless, Inter appeared unperturbed as they looked assertive right from the opening whistle.\n\nWithin the first few minutes, Inter's defense and midfield units were quick to snuff out any threats posed by Frosinone. An early sign of Inter's aggressive intent emerged when Telles attacked Paganini, set up by Jovetic's incisive movement on the left. Jovetic's effort resulted in the Frosinone defense being caught off guard numerous times. Inter's attacking trident consisting of Jovetic, Icardi, and Ljajic seemed fluid and dynamic, frequently interchanging positions, making it difficult for the Frosinone backline to latch onto any one player.\n\nDespite Stefano Stellone's squad struggling to hold onto possession and facing mounting pressure, they fashioned a few notable moments. In a particular episode, Biabiani's determination disrupted Frosinone's counterattack, which could have developed into a threatening situation. Felipe Melo and Miranda were always present to mop up any loose balls and initiate fresh attacking waves.\n\nFrosinone had their moments too, especially with players like Soddimo attempting ambitious volleys that forced Andanovic into some breathtaking saves. The delicate interplay between Castillo and Ciofani gave Inter's central defenders, Miranda and Murillo, moments to ponder. Although creating a few half-chances, Frosinone's inability to string together consistent plays meant they remained on the back foot for large parts of the match.\n\nLeading up to the 29th minute, Inter's persistent probing finally yielded the first reward. Biabiani, who was a menace on the right flank, found the back of the net after a chaotic sequence in the Frosinone penalty box. Jovetic's initial shot was well saved by Leali, but the resulting clearance fell kindly to Biabiani, who controlled excellently and finished with aplomb. This goal had a poignant back story, considering that Biabiani had faced a career-threatening cardiac arrhythmia merely a year prior. His goal was not only a celebration of technical proficiency but also a testament to his resilience and determination.\n\nBuoyed by the lead, Inter continued their stranglehold. Felipe Melo's presence in midfield became more influential as the game progressed. He was instrumental in breaking up play and recycling possession swiftly up the pitch. Despite their lead, Inter's defensive line did offer Frosinone glimpses of opportunity, usually quashed by the reliable antics of Andanovic.\n\nAs the game transitioned into the second half, Frosinone, sensing the urgency, tried to turn the tide and increase the tempo with a higher press. Castillo and the industrious Paganini frequently found themselves in forward positions, trying to carve spaces through Inter's resolute defense. However, the seasoned Miranda, alongside his equally tenacious partner Murillo, stood tall, blocking and intercepting crucial balls.\n\nEarly in the second half, a counterattack led by the indefatigable Biabiani spelled trouble for Frosinone. Biabiani's blistering pace unbalanced the Frosinone defense, leading to another incisive moment where Icardi, stationed cleverly, doubled Inter's lead with a clinical finish. This goal was a product of quick interchanges and swift movements between Jovetic and Ljajic, highlighting the cohesive play that had been fostered between Inter's forwards.\n\nThe introduction of Ranocchia for Nagatomo by Mancini gave an indication of his tactical adaptability, transitioning between defensive formations to stymie Frosinone's forward ventures. This substitution not only fortified the backline but also allowed Telles further latitude to bomb forward on the overlap.\n\nDespite Frosinone's continuous efforts to find a foothold in the game, their ventures forward were met with staunch defensive work from Inter's midfield and backline. A key defensive moment came when Murillo heroically blocked a goal-bound shot from Castillo, showcasing his uncompromising defensive work.\n\nAs the match approached the latter stages, Inter's fluid counter-attacking setup produced another moment to savor. Jovetic, combining brilliantly with the newcomers from the substitutes’ bench, exhibited his technical flair with an audacious backheel to find an overlapping Murillo, who coolly slotted the ball into the net, making it 3-0. The sheer simplicity and elegance of the execution drew applause from every corner of the stadium, underlining Inter's dominance and the gulf in class on display.\n\nNot wanting to rest on their laurels, Inter pushed forward with relentless energy. Another flowing move surfaced, this time orchestrated by the inspired Ljajic. He skillfully navigated through Frosinone's tiring defense to tee up Brozovic, who applied the finishing touch to round off a comprehensive 4-0 scoreline. It was a manifestation of Inter’s intensity and relentless pursuit of goals until the very end.\n\nThis resounding win not only bolstered Inter's position atop the Serie A standings but also amplified the confidence within the squad ahead of a flighty fixture against Napoli. Mancini’s tactical acumen, coupled with his players’ dedication, translated into a commanding performance that kept the San Siro faithful buoyant.\n\nIn reflection, the 4-0 demolition of Frosinone was a blend of strategic depth, individual skill, and cohesive teamwork. The sharp interchanges between Ljajic, Jovetic, and Icardi, the solidity of Felipe Melo in midfield, and the defensive resilience of Miranda and Murillo encapsulated a complete performance. Additionally, Biabiani’s heartwarming comeback added a narrative of triumph amid adversity. This match marked a pivotal chapter in Inter's quest for glory, showcasing their credentials as serious title contenders."
