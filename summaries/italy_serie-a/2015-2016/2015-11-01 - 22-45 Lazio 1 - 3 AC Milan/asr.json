The center of Cantreva. It's short. He dived to cut off that Bertolacci ball.\n22:21 Comment: There are many difficulties for Bonaventura. They ended up knocking him down and Bonaventura himself.\n22:27 Comment: Quickly the game for Desilio.\n22:28 Comment: How Bonaventura stepped on and hid the ball.

And he was stepping on the ball. Waiting for the foul now.\n22:44 Comment: Call the foul now. And he blew it. It was not easy. There she is. Look like Blinglia.\n22:48 Comment: Hanging above.

He turned the tables on Mauricio.\n23:22 Comment: If it comes out. If Toni comes out.\n23:25 Comment: Very good intervention in any case.\n23:27 Comment: From the Sporting Club of Portugal League.\n23:30 Comment: It was imperial there. He didn't let it happen.\n23:33 Comment: But it is another recovery in that Milan creation zone.\n23:36 Comment: And then, of course, they have to run vertically.\n23:39 Comment: And it's as if he entrusts the offensive luck of his team a little bit to Mihailovic's creation.\n23:45 Comment: To the improvisation capacity of the footballers above.\n23:48 Comment: Look how Cherchi got two.\n23:50 Comment: Now this one falls to Bertolacci.\n23:51 Comment: Carlos Baca has not yet lost any in speed.\n23:55 Comment: That can change the script of the series.\n23:56 Comment: But it's one of the things.\n23:58 Comment: If it happens.\n24:0 Comment: Ball for Milan.\n24:2 Comment: Take Mihailovic's team out.\n24:4 Comment: Whom we briefly saw there the image behind his Antonelli player.\n24:8

Bonaventura.\n24:20 Comment: Which is who moves and who offers himself.\n24:22 Comment: Antonelli's shipment.\n24:24 Comment: It seems that it is finally going to be for Bonaventura.\n24:25 Comment:

Comment: Goal.\n24:40 Comment: Milan goal.\n24:45 Comment: Bonaventura's perfect game changer for Cherchi.\n24:50 Comment: Cherchi hit him.\n24:51 Comment: It escaped Marchetti.\n24:53 Comment: And there Bertolacci appeared to push the ball.\n24:55 Comment: If Milan go ahead at the Olympic Stadium in Rome.\n24:57 Comment: Bertolacci brand.\n24:59 Comment: Lazio zero.\n25:0 Comment: Milan one.\n25:1 Comment: It's fair.\n25:2 Comment: Milan deserved to score.\n25:3 Comment: If one of the two had to do it.\n25:5 Comment: I was warning.\n25:6 Comment: And there is Cherchi.\n25:7 Comment: Face well.\n25:8 Comment: He projects himself to the center with his left foot.\n25:9 Comment: It is a center.\n25:11 Comment: I didn't want to shoot there.\n25:12 Comment: I wanted to connect with Baca.\n25:13 Comment: Clear.\n25:14 Comment: The play throws Marchetti off his feet a little.\n25:15 Comment: Because the former Sevilla player is really about to finish.\n25:16 Comment: And he leaves the ball where a goalkeeper can't leave it.\n25:17 Comment: It is true that it has a bit of difficulty.\n25:18 Comment: But, well, the game that was played at the end of the season.\n25:19 Comment: It

At Genoa.\n26:19 Comment: And finally Milan caught him there.\n26:20 Comment: It's curious.\n26:21 Comment: Because this season there was so much talk about the offensive duo formed by Luis Adriano\n26:22 Comment: and Carlos Baca.\n26:23 Comment: And it seems that Milan is starting to work.\n26:24 Comment: When they don't play together.\n26:25 Comment: Be careful because Alex.\n26:26

balls\n13:6 Comment: The problem is almost more of creation\n13:8 Comment: That you are not managing to create much\n13:10 Comment: And from there, yes,\n13:12 Comment: It seems a bit complicated to me\n13:14 Comment: Because Ricardo Kirchner is not causing an impact like the one you can imagine\n13:19 Comment: Today it is not causing an impact like you can imagine\n13:20 Comment: Keita Valdé is not here today\n13:21 Comment: The Catalan footballer\n13:24 Comment: What happened to Barça and Barça\n13:26 Comment: He is a footballer who always contributes a lot\n13:28 Comment: And his absence is noticeable\n13:30 Comment: Therefore\n13:32 Comment: He has two forwards on the bench at a pure level\n13:34 Comment: But I get the feeling that the problem is not a forward issue.\n13:37 Comment: Because he has that close, which is the great goal hunter\n13:39 Comment: The problem is that in the center of the field\n13:41 Comment: Milan is taking a bath\n13:44 Comment: There goes Buenaventura\n13:46 Comment: Paired with pasta\n13:48 Comment: What we were saying, look, there are six footballers in Lazio\n13:50 Comment: And Milan's goal\n13:51 Comment: There goes Buenaventura\n13:52 Comment: Basta knocks him down because he got into the area\n13:54 Comment: And now the referee is going to show the Serbian a yellow card.\n13:58 Comment: What a match Toni Padilla of Giacomo Buenaventura\n14:2 Comment: Sensational\n14:3 Comment: It was very difficult\n14:4 Comment: There were two lines of three of Lazio players\n14:6 Comment: That they had already recovered their position\n14:8 Comment: Only Baca was inside the area\n14:10 Comment: And Buenaventura just invents that\n14:13 Comment: Stop it or stop it\n14:15 Comment: Or it was almost, maybe 0-3\n14:17 Comment: Look, look, look\n14:18 Comment: How elastic Ronald Inesca by Giacomo Buenaventura\n14:22 Comment: Look, look, look\n14:23 Comment: How elastic Ronald Inesca by Giacomo Buenaventura\n14:25 Comment: Diosan Basta knocked him down\n14:27 Comment: Foul in favor of Milan\n14:29 Comment: Good set piece option for Mihailovic's team\n14:32 Comment: That already in a lateral

Alessio Cerchi can do it too\n14:46 Comment: And they are stuck inside the girl\n14:49 Comment: Mexés, Carlos Baca and Antonelli\n14:53 Comment: Buenaventura is going to hit him, Cerchi is alone\n14:56 Comment: Buenaventura puts it\n14:58 Comment: He tried something frivolous\n15:0 Comment: We are from the fan club, but not that much\n15:3 Comment: Well, the elastic band you pulled earlier also had a touch of frivolity, right?\n15:7 Comment: In the end, if you want to achieve great things, you must have the audacity\n15:13 Comment: Another loss of the ball by Galazio\n15:16 Comment: Buenaventura recovers, he hit it from there\n15:19 Comment: The deflected shot, a goal kick for a Galazio absolutely blurred in this match\n15:26 Comment: The last time Milan won in this stadium playing against Galazio\n15:32 Comment: Because obviously they have also played against Roma\n15:35 Comment: And he won in 2009\n15:37 Comment: Yeah\n15:38 Comment: They won 1-2 and watch the

play\n16:18 Comment: I think it's Kicina\n16:19 Comment: Placing the number 88\n16:22 Comment: Now I'm going to tell you\n16:25 Comment: Yes, it's Kicina\n16:28 Comment: Lazio launched the run\n16:30 Comment: Lucas Villa\n16:31 Comment: Again the ball for the Argentine\n16:33 Comment: He can try the shot, the former Anderlecht player hit him from there\n16:36 Comment: Recovery of Milan that can

Comment: They want to surpass Bacca\n16:46 Comment: Still Bacca who steps into the area\n16:48 Comment: It's going to be a corner for Milan\n16:50 Comment: Dusan Bacca is very supportive in the recovery\n16:54 Comment: But it's always time to dance with the ugliest\n16:57 Comment: The Balkan is suffering a lot\n17:0 Comment: And against Milan, they were almost more dangerous than Lazio.\n17:3 Comment: Let's see how the team is drawn with this change\n17:6 Comment: And Candreva leaves\n17:8 Comment: That went to the other side of the field\n17:9 Comment: To not waste time\n17:11 Comment: And enter your place\n17:12 Comment: You were referring to him a moment ago, Kicna\n17:14 Comment: Maybe a little more was expected from Ricardo Kicna\n17:17 Comment: A footballer who points ways\n17:19 Comment: But it's failing to make an impact.\n17:21 Comment: And well, it's a more vertical style of play\n17:24 Comment: Theoretically more of a wide player than a Candreva\n17:27 Comment: Which is more versatile\n17:28 Comment: Trying to change perhaps more in the midfield\n17:30 Comment: But hey, it was a game that suffered a lot\n17:33 Comment: Candreva, who is a footballer who, when he has the opportunity,\n17:35 Comment: Shoot, arm the leg\n17:37 Comment: It's a game, it's coming\n17:38 Comment: And it has been an amazement\n17:40 Comment: It has also fallen into a black hole\n17:42 Comment: Because Milan has managed to isolate\n17:44 Comment: And leave Lazio's most important men without gunpowder\n17:49 Comment: This young Dutchman has entered the

bit\n18:49 Comment: Holiday cheater\n18:51 Comment: But it had lasted five months\n18:54 Comment: In that in all the league games\n18:57 Comment: Conceded at least one goal\n18:58 Comment: This statistic was broken in the game\n19:0 Comment: Against Kiev from the last day\n19:2 Comment: Therefore in the previous days\n19:3 Comment: In each one they conceded a goal\n19:5 Comment: We'll see if

goals\n19:23 Comment: A goal in 270 minutes\n19:25 Comment: And that would give him a lot of confidence\n19:27 Comment: To this footballer who is only 16 years old\n19:30 Comment: Try making Lala Tzimba\n19:32 Comment: Lucas Villa vertically\n19:34 Comment: Felipe Anderson tried to touch and stop first\n19:36 Comment: He has recovered Alexio Cherch\n19:38 Comment: And the Brazilian appears to try to remove\n19:40 Comment: to try to steal\n19:42 Comment: Carlos Baca opens\n19:43 Comment: Kutschka tries to appear on that side\n19:45 Comment: Watch out for Kutschka's recovery\n19:47 Comment: Can center crops\n19:49 Comment: Feel your marker\n19:50 Comment: The center is good\n19:51 Comment: Mauricio sent it to the corner\n19:53 Comment: What a cut from Kuko\n19:54 Comment: As it says on his shirt inside the area\n19:56 Comment: He was so good that he knocked down his marker\n19:58 Comment: This match is very difficult\n20:0 Comment: But it's a game that can't be lost.\n20:1 Comment: This first quality detail is wonderful\n20:4 Comment: And here, as Gentile leaves, he has the mold\n20:6 Comment: How good the Slovak\n20:8 Comment: How he aspired to the incorporation of his colleagues\n20:10 Comment: Baca and Poli joining\n20:12 Comment: Wonderful move by Milan\n20:14 Comment: That initially ran out of Cherchi\n20:16 Comment: who received a foul\n20:17 Comment: Leide gives advantage\n20:18 Comment: The Slovak joined in well\n20:19 Comment: Milan is for the third goal\n20:21 Comment: Will launch from the ski\n20:23 Comment: Mihailovic's team\n20:24 Comment: In the 65th already in the game\n20:26 Comment: Bonaventura could not finish off Metses\n20:28 Comment: that ran over\n20:29 Comment: Yeah\n20:30 Comment: And to the Lazio footballer\n20:32 Comment: He came in with such force that\n20:34 Comment: that took away\n20:36 Comment: Your rival\n20:40 Comment: To Cataldi\n20:41 Comment: And yellow now for\n20:43 Comment: For Romagnoli, why?\n20:45 Comment: I think he tried to waste time\n20:48 Comment: With the ball\n20:50 Comment: Interpreted like this\n20:51 Comment: And the lack of an Alessio Romagnoli\n20:53 Comment: Let's remember the young central defender who cost more than 20 million\n20:56 Comment: There was much speculation about whether this price\n20:58 Comment: It would put pressure on a footballer\n21:0 Comment: Who had relatively few games\n21:2 Comment: In Series A\n21:3 Comment: Accompanied by an experienced center back\n21:5 Comment: There is\n21:6 Comment: That's why\n21:7 Comment: For that deviation of the ball\n21:9 Comment: He gave the yellow to Alessio Romagnoli\n21:11 Comment: What is another footballer?\n21:14 Comment: Roman trained in Rome\n21:17 Comment: He has played many derbies\n21:19 Comment: In lower category\n21:20 Comment: I think he's going to be captain even of the\n21:22 Comment: From Rome spring\n21:24 Comment: The youth team\n21:25 Comment: Milan has caught a lot of fish in\n21:27 Comment: In the lower categories of Roma\n21:28 Comment: And he has played a lot for Roma\n21:29 Comment: Let us remember that he has one\n21:31 Comment: One of the best football player deformation systems\n21:34 Comment: With Daniele Rossi's father\n21:36 Comment: Always playing an important role\n21:38 Comment: Montolivo takes the free kick\n21:40 Comment: Alessio's fans became desperate\n21:42 Comment: Seeing that it took so long to put it into play\n21:44 Comment: The midfielder of Mihailovic's team\n21:47 Comment: Montolivo playing first\n21:49 Comment: For whom, for no one\n21:51 Comment: Ball for Alessio\n21:52 Comment: Goalkeeper kick for the Roman team\n21:54 Comment: Which is 23 minutes away\n21:57 Comment: To accept the first setback of the season\n22:0 Comment: At home\n22:1 Comment: Because to date\n22:2 Comment: As we have been commenting\n22:3 Comment: Since starting this broadcast\n22:5 Comment: Alessio tidied up at home\n22:7 Comment: All the destruction that was done far from Rome\n22:10 Comment: Yes, it is a team with two faces\n22:13 Comment: It is true that outside the home\n22:14 Comment: He has achieved a victory in Verona\n22:16 Comment: But he has taken some painful defeats\n22:19 Comment: Some frustrating matches\n22:21 Comment: Let us remember that the first\n22:23 Comment: I think it's the first move\n22:26 Comment: Loses\n22:28 Comment: Today the error Donnarumma\n22:30 Comment: Donnarumma avoiding Senna Lulic's goal\n22:33 Comment: After the mistake in the Milan defense\n22:35 Comment: It was from Siglio that he falls asleep\n22:37 Comment: Senna Lulic joins very vertically\n22:40 Comment: And then Donnarumma imposes his silhouette\n22:42 Comment: my mother\n22:43 Comment: He falls asleep\n22:44 Comment: And well, put your hand there, the mitten\n22:47 Comment: Above all I like about Donnarumma\n22:50 Comment: Regardless of whether I find it there or not\n22:52 Comment: It's that body language\n22:54 Comment: It usually conveys a lot of tranquility\n22:56 Comment: The facial expression gives the sensation\n23:0 Comment: Who carries it quite calmly\n23:3 Comment: It is true that there are people who die of nerves\n23:6 Comment: And they have the ability to hide them\n23:8 Comment: But Donnarumma there\n23:10 Comment: It always feels very calm.\n23:12 Comment: Despite, I insist, he is a kid\n23:15 Comment: That I should be playing youth games\n23:18 Comment: The opening of Carlos Baca\n23:20 Comment: Alessio Cerchi\n23:21 Comment: Cerchi takes his time playing backwards\n23:23 Comment: It seems like Kuczka's first hit\n23:25 Comment: Put your head in Diosan Basta\n23:27 Comment: Poli tries to get the ball and gets it\n23:29 Comment: He tried the combination with Carlos Baca\n23:31 Comment: Alassio recovered\n23:33 Comment: Felipe Anderson\n23:34 Comment: He crashed the ball into Antonelli's legs\n23:37 Comment: Lateral service for the Roman ensemble\n23:40 Comment: We commented before\n23:42 Comment: The first trips of the Alassio\n23:44 Comment: They were especially horrible\n23:46 Comment: In Marco Antonio Ventego against Kibo\n23:48 Comment: lost 4-0\n23:49 Comment: It was that match in which Mejorini, Paleoski and company\n23:51 Comment: They destroyed Alassio\n23:53 Comment: That also came from falling against Alassio\n23:54 Comment: And then San Paolo 5-0 against Naples\n24:0 Comment: Well, hitting them is a hassle.\n24:2 Comment: And incriminate them for their poor performance\n24:4 Comment: What is football\n24:6 Comment: At the end of May the Alassio players were received\n24:8 Comment: Like heroes after eliminating Napoli\n24:10 Comment: In the Italian Cup\n24:12 Comment: After his good performances\n24:14 Comment: And because the first two games away from home in the League\n24:16 Comment: They were already bad\n24:18 Comment: They already put the pressure on them\n24:20 Comment: He managed to react little by little to Alassio\n24:22 Comment: But this match\n24:24 Comment: It is true that outside the home it does not work\n24:26 Comment: And this Wednesday we saw each other again\n24:28 Comment: In Lombard lands\n24:30 Comment: Against Atalanta in the second half\n24:32 Comment: How was that goal wasted?\n24:34 Comment: Great goal from Wigley's free kick in the first half\n24:38 Comment: Felipe Anderson is playing Miroslav Klose's first touch\n24:42 Comment: Yes, friends, he is playing\n24:44 Comment: Athough it does not seems\n24:46 Comment: And he is going to make the third change\n24:48 Comment: The Roman ensemble\n24:50 Comment: Let's see who leaves\n24:52 Comment: What is clear is that who is going to enter the field\n24:54 Comment: The one who is going to enter the field is Matri\n24:56 Comment: A former Milan player\n24:58 Comment: Milinkovic Savic leaves\n25:2 Comment: Start playing with two reference forwards\n25:4 Comment: I was indicating it to Matri with my fingers\n25:6 Comment: Surely\n25:8 Comment: It will become a 4-4-2\n25:10 Comment: With Klose and Matri up\n25:12 Comment: An area animal to Matri\n25:14 Comment: A footballer who has also shown very good manners\n25:16 Comment: And he is also playing this game\n25:18 Comment: Because Milan does not apply a fear clause\n25:20 Comment: He is still owned by Milan\n25:22 Comment: He is on loan, therefore, if he scores\n25:24 Comment: It would mark the club to which it technically still belongs\n25:26 Comment: Marks the club to which he technically still belongs\n25:28 Comment: Lulic brought out\n25:30 Comment: Opening again for Lulic\n25:32 Comment: To recover Milan's leather\n25:34 Comment: Lateral service for Mihailovic's team\n25:36 Comment: Sacchi demands that he will effect Silio\n25:42 Comment: With less than 20 left before the game ends\n25:44 Comment: And the director stays with Pioli\n25:46 Comment: Montolivo hit him\n25:48 Comment: He hit the ball at the newly incorporated Matri\n25:50 Comment: Once again Sacchi demands for Milan\n26:2 Comment: It's Matri\n26:4 Comment: Recovery of the 17th\n26:6 Comment: There is no offside\n26:8 Comment: The German player has to heel\n26:10 Comment: After poor ball control\n26:12 Comment: Silio's rooster throws him\n26:14 Comment: Goal kick for Milan\n26:18 Comment: That individual play did not come to fruition\n26:22 Comment: Demiroslav Klose, who was not offside, got the Inier right there.\n26:31 Comment: There they saw the action repeated, some fans claimed that perhaps it was a corner kick, but Klose didn't say anything at all either.\n26:41 Comment: It's Ricardo Kirchner, moving down the wing, trying to overtake two, he knocked him down, making him miss Sigrio.\n26:48 Comment: That is what Ricardo Kirchner can contribute, a bit of imbalance on the wing, and there at least he has managed to take the foul in a play in which two Milan players are in superiority.\n26:58 Comment: It is costing Lazio a lot to put, give a little bit, put duties to that boy, to Donnarumma.\n27:5 Comment: Lucas Villa takes the free kick, there are one, two, three, four, five from Lazio inside the area, two more, and he waits for the ball from the front.\n27:14 Comment: The Argentine goes the ball, Villa puts it, the center.\n27:18 Comment: Fists out of Donnarumma, the rebound for that hit by Basta, which goes very wide.\n27:26 Comment: And some whistles, huh.\n27:27 Comment: Yes, Lazio is not liking it.\n27:33 Comment: I interject that they are also calling for Milan's waste of time, I suppose, on this occasion.\n27:38 Comment: But after those two defeats Lazio will have the derby against Roma.\n27:44 Comment: Derbies are obviously matches that have their own story.\n27:48 Comment: Rudi García's team is obviously better, weighing yesterday's defeat against Inter.\n27:53 Comment: But obviously anything can happen.\n27:56 Comment: In the case of Milan, the next day they play a Lombard derby against Atalanta.\n28:2 Comment: Atalanta goes down from Bergamo to Milan, a short trip for the DEA.\n28:6 Comment: Of course, if Milan are very favorites, they could achieve their fourth victory and then visit Juve.\n28:13 Comment: Of course, and if Milan has grown, visit Juve, that match could be...\n28:18 Comment: Incredible, Milan is still far ahead of Juve in the standings.\n28:22 Comment: Lazio tries to attack.\n28:24 Comment: Inside ball for that Cataldi distribution.\n28:27 Comment: Receiving the heart in band for that blow.\n28:29 Comment: Goal, goal, goal, goal, goal, goal, goal, goal, goal.\n28:32 Comment: No, offside.\n28:34 Comment: Ricardo Kirchner offside.\n28:38 Comment: Lazio scored, the action was invalidated due to an illegal position.\n28:42 Comment: We'll see if yes, well yes, both of them, Klose and Kirchner.\n28:48 Comment: It is true that Kirchner's support foot is in line, but his entire body seems very advanced.\n28:54 Comment: It is a creditable save by Donnarumma under Felipe Anderson's shot,\n28:59 Comment: which is the first time that he has appeared in the game to do what is expected of him.\n29:3 Comment: Yes, there he is, as he stretches well, he is an agile footballer, logically, at his age.\n29:10 Comment: But, again, that detail, the coldness, the tranquility that Donnarumma transmits,\n29:16 Comment: Felipe Anderson is getting desperate.\n29:18 Comment: He reaches out, sticks his hand out and then there are two Lazio players offside.\n29:23 Comment: Due to its epic nature and accumulation of talented players at the top, Lazio is generating a little danger.\n29:31 Comment: But hey, it still offers an image of total tranquility.\n29:33 Comment: Look, of course, if Lazio manages to score a goal, everything can change there.\n29:36 Comment: You are going to change the emotional register of the game, you are going to delay the pressure,\n29:39 Comment: Milan's remaining time could be very long and Lazio has no other choice.\n29:43 Comment: Milan would do well, now that they accumulate troops above Lazio,\n29:46 Comment: to enhance the cons.\n29:48 Comment: He is going to sentence.\n29:49 Comment: There goes Kirchner, centered.\n29:52 Comment: Ricardo Montolivo blocked the ball well, corner kick for the Roman team.\n29:58 Comment: The one who seems willing to kick Ricardo Kirchner himself runs.\n30:1 Comment: And what happens?\n30:2 Comment: Oh, okay, the referee has given the referee a piece of his mind or whatever.\n30:10 Comment: Pioli biting his nails, right?\n30:13 Comment: Now that you see that your team is managing to have continuity in the game a little bit\n30:16 Comment: and this unforeseen stop.\n30:18 Comment: Because of the referee's hash.\n30:22 Comment: They are surely Lazio's best five minutes so far in the game.\n30:27 Comment: Perhaps the brilliance of the Roman team comes a little late, taking into account the 0-2.\n30:32 Comment: And there is still the fourth referee.\n30:41 Comment: Trying to correct the problem that the main referee has had.\n30:46 Comment: Kirchner plays mark.\n30:48 Comment: Kirchner puts it.\n30:49 Comment: Frank auction.\n30:51 Comment: Very, very, very outspoken Mauritian.\n30:53 Comment: The Brazilian got him out, eh?\n30:54 Comment: Because he finished with absolute comfort, Toni.\n30:57 Comment: He started well, winning the position.\n31:0 Comment: There is perhaps a little push from Siglio that one.\n31:3 Comment: Yes, pushover exists.\n31:4 Comment: And it is embedded between Antonelli and de Siglio.\n31:8 Comment: And it ends with everything.\n31:9 Comment: The lack is interpretable.\n31:11 Comment: And I liked that Donnarumma quickly looks at the footballers who are...\n31:16 Comment: That they take some fingers off.\n31:17 Comment: 20 years.\n31:18 Comment: And he tells you, guys, intensity.\n31:20 Comment: Let's be aggressive.\n31:22 Comment: He wants to go out to Lazio.\n31:23 Comment: He can get Alessio Cerchi back.\n31:25 Comment: He left the first Cerchi.\n31:27 Comment: Lulich ends up taking the ball.\n31:28 Comment: Lulich's error.\n31:29 Comment: Poli's touch.\n31:30 Comment: There goes Carlos Baca.\n31:31 Comment: Lucas Villa intervenes.\n31:33 Comment: Of course, I was able to finish almost one of these in Milan at the Olympic Stadium in Rome.\n31:38 Comment: You're playing all or nothing, right?\n31:40 Comment: Pioli is playing all the cards to score a goal that will generate a wonderful atmosphere at the Olympic Stadium.\n31:46 Comment: That allows you to do...\n31:48 Comment: Believe everyone that a tie can be achieved.\n31:50 Comment: But of course, this is a coin toss.\n31:52 Comment: If it comes out heads and you manage to score first, the game will be open.\n31:55 Comment: But if Milan hunts one of these, you will end up beaten at home.\n31:59 Comment: The loose ball.\n32:0 Comment: The shot went wide.\n32:1 Comment: The goal kick for Milan was attempted by Cataldi.\n32:5 Comment: The player who entered the playing field at half-time, replacing the Nigerian Nasi.\n32:10 Comment: He hit him very badly.\n32:11 Comment: Cataldi is in a very centered position trying to provide a little bit of output.\n32:15 Comment: But the youth squad, the truth is, is not achieving it.\n32:18 Comment: It's not going to have an impact.\n32:19 Comment: Cataldi has played many derbies in youth categories against Roma, against Romagnoli.\n32:23 Comment: They are two of the footballers.\n32:25 Comment: I mentioned before that Roma has one of the best football player training systems.\n32:28 Comment: Lazio also has it.\n32:29 Comment: They are teams that historically have always produced footballers.\n32:32 Comment: And there are entire generations of great players who have grown up playing very hot Roman derbies.\n32:37 Comment: Since they are 14 or 15 years old.\n32:40 Comment: Lazio loiteta again.\n32:41 Comment: The opening of Cataldi.\n32:43 Comment: And seeing the incorporation of one more Diosan Basta.\n32:46 Comment: Giacomo Buenaventura comes to close it.\n32:48 Comment: The Serbian player stopped with difficulties.\n32:51 Comment: He ended up losing the ball.\n32:52 Comment: Lateral service for Mihailovic's team.\n32:55 Comment: That in the last minutes, Toni has completely lost control of the game.\n33:2 Comment: Yes, I suppose that fatigue or the fact of knowing that you are close to victory has an influence.\n33:8 Comment: But I agree with you, Miguel Ángel, who is more backed down.\n33:11 Comment: It is allowing them to play in an area where Lazio, due to the accumulation of talent, has more options to generate danger.\n33:18 Comment: What happens is that in the end the rival plays.\n33:20 Comment: The rival has talent.\n33:22 Comment: And the changes that Pioli has made have allowed Lazio to finally play continuously in the half of the field of play that Milan defends.\n33:32 Comment: Milan, obviously, the effort of running, blocking spaces, is being noted.\n33:36 Comment: There's a little bit of air missing.\n33:38 Comment: Oops, what a mistake. Sorry, Toni. Get Milan back.\n33:40 Comment: The sending between centers for Carlos Baca. The Colombian is going to face.\n33:43 Comment: Wow, great Baca. Goal, goal, goal, goal, goal, goal, goal.\n33:48 Comment: Goal.\n33:54 Comment: Carlos Arturo. Smoked roof rack. Mark the third for Milan.\n33:59 Comment: Precise and precious sending between centers.\n34:2 Comment: How well Baca Marchetti overflowed.\n34:5 Comment: The Milan attacker scored into an empty goal.\n34:8 Comment: New goal from Baca. New goal from the former Sevilla player.\n34:11 Comment: Colorin Colorado. This is over Toni Padilla.\n34:15 Comment: How are you, Giacomo? Good adventure celebrating the goal.\n34:17 Comment: The body language of the Milan players celebrating the goal is that of a team that was looking forward to a game like this.\n34:24 Comment: Well, this detail here. This detail.\n34:27 Comment: Baca's change of pace, incredible. Marchetti can never arrive. He stays seated.\n34:32 Comment: He scores the goal he deserved for the work the Colombian was doing.\n34:36 Comment: And we are seeing Milan's first outstanding performance from Sinisa Mihajlovic.\n34:43 Comment: It was a stadium where no one had won.\n34:45 Comment: Where only one team had scored a goal.\n34:47 Comment: Score three goals. He defends perfectly.\n34:50 Comment: He can chain the second game without conceding.\n34:53 Comment: 9 out of 9 the last few days.\n34:55 Comment: And ten days are changing the story of Mihajlovic's team.\n34:59 Comment: Ten days ago this team was questioned.\n35:2 Comment: With a weekday. 9 out of 9.\n35:6 Comment: Milan moving up the table. Liking. Getting better.\n35:11 Comment: And we discussed it with Pioli. He modified the equipment.\n35:14 Comment: He threw the coin into the air. Cruz came out.\n35:16 Comment: And that is the face that remains for Claudio Lotito, the president of Arancio.\n35:19 Comment: With today's three goals, Milan have scored 15 goals throughout the season.\n35:23 Comment: Of the 15 goals, six have been scored by Carlos Baca.\n35:27 Comment: And Keishuke Honda is going to enter. That ocherchi is worth it.\n35:30 Comment: The Japanese who is, Toni, in all the pools to leave Milan in the winter market.\n35:37 Comment: Yes. Some offensive footballer has to leave.\n35:39 Comment: And Honda is the one that is coming out with the fewest options.\n35:42 Comment: Together.\n35:44 Comment: The logic would be for it to go.\n35:46 Comment: And we heard, obviously, the Lazio fans booing Cherchi.\n35:49 Comment: But the Milan fans present are applauding Cherchi.\n35:52 Comment: Mihailovic has gotten away with the chair, for now.\n35:54 Comment: And Cherchi, booed, was applauded by the Milan fans.\n35:58 Comment: That optimism is recovering.\n36:1 Comment: How important is it to achieve an impact victory?\n36:5 Comment: Because, I insist, Milan was coming from two home games.\n36:8 Comment: Winning by the minimum, without liking it too much.\n36:10 Comment: This is different.\n36:12 Comment: It's going to the Lazio field.\n36:14 Comment: A team that finished third last year.\n36:16 Comment: That he didn't lose at home.\n36:18 Comment: Win, score, show character.\n36:21 Comment: I insist, the way to celebrate the third goal is that of a team that wanted to feel like a protagonist.\n36:28 Comment: That is, finally.\n36:30 Comment: Finally something is going well for us.\n36:32 Comment: That celebration has been very interesting.\n36:35 Comment: Will Mihailovic be able to turn this Milan into a team capable of being a protagonist for positive things?\n36:42 Comment: Maybe.\n36:44 Comment: Which seemed really crazy.\n36:47 Comment: Montoligo has a puncture.\n36:49 Comment: Oh.\n36:50 Comment: There.\n36:52 Comment: Well, Milan already lost Bertolacci in the first half.\n36:58 Comment: For a similar reason.\n37:1 Comment: From a puncture in the back of the leg.\n37:4 Comment: And then, obviously, Alex's injury.\n37:8 Comment: That very hard blow that he has received.\n37:10 Comment: The two injuries to the...\n37:11 Comment: What Milan has suffered in this match.\n37:15 Comment: The Milan that has exhausted the changes.\n37:17 Comment: Therefore, if Montoligo cannot continue, he will have to play these last seven and a half minutes, plus whatever the referee wants to add, with one less player.\n37:26 Comment: There goes Klose.\n37:28 Comment: Alex, who by the way has been transferred to a hospital in Rome to undergo tests while conscious.\n37:37 Comment: He will obviously sleep tonight in the hospital.\n37:41 Comment: It's usually the protocol, right?\n37:43 Comment: Spend 24 hours under observation before you can go home again.\n37:49 Comment: Kicna's game changer.\n37:51 Comment: Antonelli gave me a hard time there.\n37:53 Comment: Felipe Anderson has not arrived.\n37:55 Comment: And again the whistles of Alainzio's fans to theirs.\n37:58 Comment: And well, we warned about it at the beginning of this broadcast.\n38:1 Comment: That Milan, despite all the criticism, despite all the noise that has been generated around the team due to its irregular start to the season.\n38:9 Comment: It's going to go to the last minutes.\n38:10 Comment: He is going to go to 19 points.\n38:12 Comment: They are going to tie with Sassuolo.\n38:14 Comment: This means that if the season ended right now, it would be tied with the last team that would compete in European competition.\n38:24 Comment: Sassuolo is going to be fifth and Milan sixth.\n38:27 Comment: Because by goal difference, Sassuolo has a better difference than Mihailovic's Milan.\n38:33 Comment: But hey, being fifth means, with 19 points, it means being five behind the leader.\n38:40 Comment: It means being four away from the Champions League.\n38:43 Comment: It means being very close to fourth position.\n38:47 Comment: There goes Kyshnaol.\n38:49 Comment: Alainzio's goal.\n38:55 Comment: Not even the Dutch celebrate it.\n38:57 Comment: Unattainable bomb for Donnarumma.\n39:0 Comment: Alainzio reduces differences.\n39:2 Comment: 1-3, although it seems that no one believes.\n39:5 Comment: Pioli, Pioli indicated it.\n39:8 Comment: There, Sicily is...\n39:9 Comment: Really weak in defense.\n39:12 Comment: It is poorly located.\n39:14 Comment: And there he allows the shot to Kyshnaol.\n39:16 Comment: Enter Donnarumma through the short post.\n39:19 Comment: Of course, he trusted his side.\n39:21 Comment: Well, I don't think Milan's young goalkeeper has any responsibility there.\n39:25 Comment: Kyshnaol has provided details since he entered the field of play.\n39:28 Comment: And he has managed to get a home from Sicilio out of Kicio.\n39:32 Comment: That he lacked forcefulness in many phases of the game.\n39:36 Comment: Milan will continue conceding one goal per game.\n39:38 Comment: Only Kibo was unable to score against him.\n39:40 Comment: Second goal of the season for Ricardo Kyshna.\n39:43 Comment: With that blow inside the area.\n39:46 Comment: Virtually no reaction time Donnarumma.\n39:49 Comment: And there Ricardo Montolivo returns to the field of play.\n39:52 Comment: Who appears to have had the back of his thigh bandaged.\n39:56 Comment: And it seems that now he is going to position himself as... well, as a forward, right?\n40:1 Comment: There to jump, try...\n40:3 Comment: It's not clear to me exactly what happened there.\n40:6 Comment: We'll see if we can see a repeat of it later.\n40:9 Comment: Because it seemed that Montolivo had left the field of play.\n40:12 Comment: I don't know if exactly at the moment of the goal Milan was with 10.\n40:15 Comment: And I don't know if they were applying a bandage.\n40:18 Comment: Or is it that to avoid scares, Milan was choosing to end the game with 10.\n40:22 Comment: And when Lazio scored they said, well, come in just in case.\n40:25 Comment: No, because Montolivo was on the bench.\n40:27 Comment: And there we missed it apart from the conversation between Ricardo Montolivo and Sinisei Mihailovic.\n40:33 Comment: It has become very clear.\n40:34 Comment: Well, it has become very clear.\n40:35 Comment: Milan is going to take the sideline.\n40:37 Comment: There you see Kicina.\n40:38 Comment: There you see Keisuke Honda.\n40:43 Comment: He is going to put it into circulation in Siclio.\n40:49 Comment: Keisuke Honda drops.\n40:50 Comment: The Japanese can take it.\n40:52 Comment: Lucas came in...\n40:53 Comment: Well, here Gentiletti is very, very, very, very, very on the limit, eh?\n40:59 Comment: Yes, a slightly unbalanced Honda arrives because it comes from behind.\n41:3 Comment: But the movement is very good.\n41:5 Comment: Displacement exists.\n41:6 Comment: It seems to me that this action does not happen on the line of the area and a foul is called.\n41:9 Comment: There the referee became a little afraid because the foul seemed clear on the former CSKA Moscow footballer.\n41:16 Comment: And this match will leave Lazio already played against two games, against two important rivals, Naples and Milan.\n41:23 Comment: And overall there are eight goals against, one for and two defeats.\n41:27 Comment: Just before the derby, which obviously is an important rival.\n41:30 Comment: Milan had just lost all the important games.\n41:33 Comment: Fiorentina defeated Milan on the first day with ease.\n41:38 Comment: Inter won the derby with Fede Cuarín's goal.\n41:42 Comment: And then Napoli directly humiliated Milan.\n41:46 Comment: Let's remember this Milan was coming off a 0-4 defeat with Milan, which is the worst defeat in the history of matches between Milan and Naples.\n41:55 Comment: Not even Maradona's Naples had beaten Milan 0-4.\n41:58 Comment: And that was when he hit the low point, right?\n42:1 Comment: Yes Yes.\n42:2 Comment: From Mihaljevic.\n42:3 Comment: From then on he has managed to react.\n42:6 Comment: And this 1-3 reverses the trend, right?\n42:8 Comment: It's finally beating an important team.\n42:12 Comment: It is finally offering a more or less constant performance throughout the game.\n42:16 Comment: And that's what Mihaljevic needed.\n42:18 Comment: Rosenborg, Lazio in the Europa League.\n42:20 Comment: Rome, Lazio.\n42:21 Comment: Lazio, Palermo.\n42:22 Comment: Lazio, Dnipro, Dnipropetrovsk.\n42:24 Comment: That is the immediate schedule of Pioli's team.\n42:27 Comment: For its part, Milan.\n42:28 Comment: Milan, Atalanta.\n42:30 Comment: Juve, Milan.\n42:31 Comment: Milan, Sampdoria.\n42:32 Comment: Milan, Crotone of the Italian Cup, of course.\n42:35 Comment: Let's remember that Milan does not play in Europe.\n42:38 Comment: And that leaves your legs cooler.\n42:43 Comment: That game against Crotone.\n42:45 Comment: Crotone is a Calabrian team.\n42:47 Comment: That he is doing very well in Serie B.\n42:49 Comment: Who always has his interesting players following.\n42:52 Comment: Last year Cataldi del Alarcio was followed, for example, in Crotone.\n42:56 Comment: And that he is fighting for what would be, or dreams of, the first promotion in the history of this modest Calabrian club.\n43:1 Comment: Let's remember that Calabria, the tip of the boot.\n43:4 Comment: He hasn't had a team in Serie A for a long time.\n43:6 Comment: The last one I think was Reggina, the Reggio de Calabria team.\n43:9 Comment: In the 80s, Catanzaro also had a lot of fame.\n43:12 Comment: Cosenza was one point away from promotion.\n43:14 Comment: It is a region that has always produced more footballers than clubs.\n43:17 Comment: The native region, for example, of Gennaro Gattuso.\n43:20 Comment: From Reggio Calabria is our dearest Marco Tripepi.\n43:23 Comment: Commentator here at BIN Sports.\n43:26 Comment: We send greetings to him in case he is watching the game.\n43:29 Comment: I do not know.\n43:30 Comment: Or maybe he is watching it but with his colleagues from Sky Italia.\n43:35 Comment: I don't know, it doesn't matter.\n43:37 Comment: That's where Marco is from.\n43:39 Comment: Here comes Montolivo.\n43:40 Comment: Vigle left Montolivo a monotazo.\n43:43 Comment: Always leaving envelopes with messages, Vigle.\n43:48 Comment: Milan owned it.\n43:50 Comment: We reached the last minute of regulation time.\n43:54 Comment: Mihailovic's team is going to serve from the wing again.\n43:58 Comment: From Siglio.\n44:0 Comment: For Keisuke Honda.\n44:1 Comment: Lulic's anticipation.\n44:3 Comment: And the throw-in again for the visiting team.\n44:6 Comment: There Viña invited De Siglio to go a little faster.\n44:11 Comment: Yes, the warning that Bonaventura has seen will leave him without playing the next day.\n44:18 Comment: Well go.\n44:19 Comment: Against whom?\n44:20 Comment: Against Atalanta.\n44:21 Comment: His previous club.\n44:22 Comment: Against his previous club, yes.\n44:23 Comment: You will not have moral dilemmas.\n44:24 Comment: Marchetti is going to put it into play.\n44:29 Comment: There goes the ball from the Lazio goalkeeper.\n44:31 Comment: Shipping is quite short.\n44:33 Comment: Lulic put his head in.\n44:35 Comment: Ball to Gentiletti.\n44:37 Comment: Direct shipping from Gentiletti.\n44:39 Comment: There you see Filip Mekses.\n44:40 Comment: How life doesn't get complicated.\n44:42 Comment: Kizhna for Lazio.\n44:43 Comment: Bertolacci, Mekses, Baca.\n44:45 Comment: For Milan.\n44:51 Comment: And six minutes.\n44:52 Comment: Add the referee.\n44:53 Comment: It must be remembered that the game was stopped for quite some time due to the battle issue.\n44:57 Comment: Toni Padilla has already told us that he is in a hospital in Rome, although he has recovered.\n45:6 Comment: awareness.\n45:7 Comment: We will see if the negative part of Milan's victory is, obviously, how Alex is, but\n45:14 Comment: Bertolacci's injury, Montolive's physical problems, a one-match suspension\n45:19 Comment: that Bonaventura will have, which is assured, yes, that he will be able to play against Lazio from here\n45:24 Comment: two days.\n45:25 Comment: But, obviously, it is true that we are close to a national team break.\n45:28 Comment: He will have more time without that Mihailovic.\n45:30 Comment: But the effort made to be the first team to win in this stadium.\n45:35 Comment: This is the image we were commenting on.\n45:38 Comment: It seemed as if Montolivo had made an agreement with Mihailovic, if you have discomfort, leave the\n45:43 Comment: field of the game, we were 0-3.\n45:44 Comment: And he scored and said, go ahead.\n45:46 Comment: And Mihailovic, then, well, ten and a half is better than ten.\n45:51 Comment: It's ball for Milan.\n45:54 Comment: There we could understand a little what had happened.\n45:57 Comment: Montolivo was going to rest on the bench after that puncture he noticed in his leg\n46:2 Comment: and Mihailovic told him, come on, go inside, I don't want to suffer too much.\n46:8 Comment: Really bad luck in this case, because let's remember that Montolivo has suffered the puncture\n46:14 Comment: 15 seconds after the last change he made without that Mihailovic when he came on\n46:19 Comment: Keisuke Honda.\n46:20 Comment: Carlos Vaca is running.\n46:23 Comment: Faster than Gentiletti.\n46:25 Comment: Wow, what a mistake by Gentiletti.\n46:26 Comment: Cow takes the ball.\n46:27 Comment: The Colombian goes to the corner.\n46:29 Comment: He tried to force the corner kick.\n46:30 Comment: He ends up enabling Keisuke Honda in this way.\n46:32 Comment: The former CSKA Moscow player puts it.\n46:34 Comment: Ball in the front.\n46:35 Comment: You can hit Kutska.\n46:36 Comment: There has been a fall.\n46:37 Comment: That's a penalty, right?\n46:38 Comment: It's in...\n46:40 Comment: He whistles outside.\n46:41 Comment: He hasn't whistled outside.\n46:43 Comment: Well...\n46:44 Comment: Yes, Gentiletti is absolutely desperate.\n46:48 Comment: He's slow, he's tired.\n46:50 Comment: And in the previous play...\n46:51 Comment: All this is born, let us remember.\n46:52 Comment: Let's see.\n46:53 Comment: Oh, well I would say it's inside, eh?\n46:54 Comment: I'd say it's on the line, huh?\n46:55 Comment: I see her more inside than outside.\n46:56 Comment: But well, there...\n46:57 Comment: You can't see it from there.\n46:58 Comment: And the lack is clear, eh?\n46:59 Comment: Because in addition to the leg, it leaves the leg.\n47:0 Comment: This is born from that ball that Gentiletti is incapable of defending and that it seemed that Gentiletti\n47:7 Comment: It was going in slow motion and then it went through...\n47:10 Comment: As if it were a high-speed train and it takes the ball away.\n47:16 Comment: Gentiletti looked like a McLaren and Carlos Vaca like a Mercedes, right?\n47:20 Comment: I am not very expert on these topics.\n47:22 Comment: Well, but you know that McLaren is not doing very well, right?\n47:26 Comment: Something rings a bell.\n47:27 Comment: I don't even have a driving license.\n47:29 Comment: I don't have the engine.\n47:30 Comment: No?\n47:31 Comment: No.\n47:32 Comment: Milan will take the free kick.\n47:33 Comment: It looks like Keishu

    "summary": "The Olympic Stadium in Rome bore witness to a captivating encounter between Lazio and AC Milan with the visitors securing a commanding 3-1 victory. The match began with fervor as Lazio displayed early determination to recover the ball. Yet, it was AC Milan's gradual assertion of tactical superiority and composure that painted the evening red and black.\n\nWithin seconds of the start, engaging narratives floated around Lazio’s impeccable home record. They had amassed 13 goals at home with only one conceded, that solitary breach coming from Bologna. Lazio's dominance at the Stadio Olimpico was a comfort to their fans, having celebrated each home game with a victory. Despite their glistening home run, doubts lingered due to their recent humbling away loss to Atalanta.\n\nAs early as the first minute, it became clear that if Milan emerged victorious, they would leapfrog Lazio in the standings and draw level with Sassuolo for fifth place. The tension thickened when Milan's coach faced skepticism about his job security, especially after closely contested wins against Sassuolo and Chievo. The coach's tactical shift towards more defensive robustness aimed at cementing Milan's standings proved crucial.\n\nBoth teams struggled initially to break the deadlock. Federico Marchetti showcased his goalkeeping prowess by foiling one attempt after another. Gianluigi Donnarumma, the young Milan goalkeeper, also exhibited remarkable composure, making critical saves and demonstrating potential beyond his years.\n\nThe match featured moments of tactical brilliance and individual flair. Alessio Cerci’s interplay with teammates like Carlos Bacca and Bonaventura was particularly noteworthy. Milan's early persistence bore fruit from intricate teamwork, including Cerci’s effective contributions despite early criticisms from fans.\n\nAt the 24-minute mark, Milan's labor bore results. Following a spell of calculated build-ups, Bonaventura executed an impeccable game-changer for Cerci who propelled the ball into the area. Marchetti mishandled Cerci’s precise delivery, leaving Bertolacci positioned perfectly to tap home the opening goal. The timing of Bertolacci’s strike could not have been more poetic, given his Roman origins and past allegiance to Roma, Lazio's city rivals.\n\nLazio, undeterred, endeavored to wrest control back but continually faltered against Milan’s structured defense. Kucska and Montolivo’s midfield work ensured Milan dictated the game’s tempo, frustrating Lazio’s bursts forward. Miroslav Klose, once a formidable goal-seeker, struggled amidst Milan’s disciplined marking led by veteran defender Alex.\n\nTragedy struck in quick succession with injuries to Alex and initially heroic Bertolacci, the latter forced off due to a suspected hamstring issue. Substitutions followed with players like Andrea Poli stepping in to sustain Milan’s momentum amidst physical adversity.\n\nLazio's attempts to equalize ran repeatedly into the buffer of Donnarumma’s secure hands and Milan’s defensive organization. The pace fluctuated as Lazio’s creative individuals like Felipe Anderson and Sergei Milinkovic tried injecting life but met stalwart resistance. Anderson's solo efforts to breach Donnarumma’s goal faced acknowledgment for flair but lacked collaborative execution necessary to shift the game’s dynamics.\n\nMilan capitalized on set-piece advantage through an unlikely hero, Philippe Mexès. Shortly after substituting for the injured Alex, Mexès scored from a Bonaventura delivery early into the second half, doubling Milan’s lead. Mexès' goal exemplified the visitor’s clinical conversion of opportunities.\n\nLazio’s countermeasures involved tactical adjustments and fresh legs, like Ricardo Kishna’s entry, yet failed to yield substantial results. Lazio’s Carlos Baca, relentless in his forward press, forced defensive errors and orchestrated Milan’s offensive transitions smoothly. Baca’s culminating brilliance emerged towards the match’s closure when he beautifully maneuvered around Gentiletti to net Milan’s third.\n\nKishna’s late strike to reduce the deficit did little to alter the night's outcome. Milan’s tactical maturity and relentless offensive ensured the team's first standout performance of the season. The victory was lauded by gestures from Mihailovic and his squad, signifying a breakthrough from criticism-laden weeks.\n\nPost-match analysis highlighted key elements:\n1. **Milan's organized structure outplayed Lazio’s fragmented offensive**.\n2. **Donnarumma’s goalkeeping composure underlined Milan’s defensive resilience**.\n3. **Effective utilization of set-pieces and counterattacks showcased Milan’s strategic edge**.\n4. **Injuries tested Milan's depth, with substitutes stepping up spectacularly**.\n5. **Carlos Baca's persistent pressing and exemplary finishing were pivotal**.\n\nThe high-stakes matchup concluded with Milan showing glimpses of its historical charisma, juxtaposed against a Lazio team poised to reassess strategies before upcoming critical fixtures. From a tactical viewpoint, Milan’s ability to suppress Lazio's attacks, combined with exploiting defensive lapses through astute pressing and swift counterplay, marked a significant progression. The victory mirrored the tactical acumen of Mihailovic and an evolving AC Milan side eager to reclaim their status in Serie A.\n\nIn the grand narrative of the 2015-2016 Serie A season, Milan's triumph at the Olimpico remains a testament to resilience amidst tumultuous phases and ongoing rebuilding. This match serves as an illuminating chapter of strategic redemption and evolving dynamics for Milan as they navigated crucial fixtures, aiming for sustained momentum in the league. The encounter encapsulated classic elements of Italian football, underscoring disciplined defense, nuanced midfield orchestration, and sharp offensive execution under the limelight of a storied venue."
