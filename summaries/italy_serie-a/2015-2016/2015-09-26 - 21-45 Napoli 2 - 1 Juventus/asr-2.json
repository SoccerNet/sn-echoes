Napoli, team captain Marik Hamsik, number 17.\n0:11 Comment: And finally, the attack group, number 24 left inside Lorenzo Insigna, plays on the right, in place of the right inside, number 7 Jose Maria Califon and striker, the main star of Napoli Gonzalo Pepita Higuain.\n0:25 Comment: Here he is with the ball, taking the ball away from Hernanez, let's go, friends, the central game of the Italian tour on NTV+, Higuain kept it with the ball, a great start, Higuain personally scored 4 goals in the Italian Serie A in 5 rounds, and I think that he naturally wants to develop his success.\n0:43 Comment: Hysaj on the right flank, passes to Alan, and then the ball goes out of bounds.\n0:49 Comment: It is clear that if we compare these teams with last season, both Juve and Naples have a lot of newcomers.\n0:55 Comment: Because we often talk about the fact that a large number of football players came to Juventus, as many as 10 people, then Napoli, oh, how wrong, no, Kirill apparently miscalculated this transfer to Simon Padayin.\n1:9 Comment: Napoli also has a new coach, Maurizo Sari, and, accordingly, a large number of players.\n1:15 Comment: But more on that later, while Paul Pogba is on the left flank, Hysaj is against him, Pogba, naturally, can beat any opponent 1 on 1, pass to Dzadzu, what a terrible ball handling Simon Dzadzu has.\n1:25 Comment: And Alan receives the ball, picks up speed, the Brazilian, pass to Higuain, then a wonderful pass to Hamsik, Insigni on the left flank, a free kick over Lorenzo Insigni, a twisting shot, where, where is the shot from Lorenzo Insigni.\n1:40 Comment: Hamshik, the attack continues, Napoli, there was no offside situation, as the Juventus players hinted at.\n1:46 Comment: Ghulyam, back pass, Georginho, pass to the left, Ghulyam again.\n1:53 Comment: Gamshik.\n1:55 Comment: Ghoulam.\n1:58 Comment: Maria Gamshik hits with a turn and the shot is inaccurate.\n2:3 Comment: There are only 2 minutes left, but there is so much passion in these 2 minutes, so many attacks, so much desire to win.\n2:9 Comment: In fact, this match is a little special for everyone, because, probably, when such teams meet in the 6th round, the most predicted result is a draw.\n2:20 Comment: Because, probably, you don’t want to take risks at the start of the season.\n2:24 Comment: And calm.\n2:25 Comment: And play a draw and earn at least one point.\n2:28 Comment: But this is a completely different story, dear friends.\n2:31 Comment: Here both teams started poorly.\n2:34 Comment: The feeling of fighting for the Scudetto is at stake here.\n2:37 Comment: If Juventus continues to lose points at the same pace, then, of course, they will have to forget about the Scudetto.\n2:42 Comment: About the fight for the Scudetto.\n2:44 Comment: The same goes for Napoli.\n2:45 Comment: Plus pressure.\n2:46 Comment: Still, Italy is a special country.\n2:48 Comment: The pressure here is crazy on absolutely all teams.\n2:52 Comment: And it is clear that if there are losses of points again, it will be the fans and journalists.\n2:55 Comment: They won't forgive Pereira.\n2:56 Comment: Georginho takes the ball away.\n2:58 Comment: Pereira falls.\n3:0 Comment: But Orsato did not see a violation of the rules here.\n3:3 Comment: He asks the Argentine to get up.\n3:6 Comment: Banuche.\n3:7 Comment: Intercepts the ball.\n3:9 Comment: For this reason, I assure you that today will be a game to win.\n3:13 Comment: Both from Napoli and from Juventus.\n3:15 Comment: Simone Dzadze scores.\n3:17 Comment: But he was offside.\n3:19 Comment: Juve forward, who scored his first goal for Juventus in the last round.\n3:23 Comment: And in the season...\n3:25 Comment: There was, but...\n3:27 Comment: Yes, for a thin one.\n3:28 Comment: He scored his first goal for Juve in the last round.\n3:31 Comment: In the match against Frosinone.\n3:32 Comment: By the way, this was a major sensation.\n3:35 Comment: And the main failure, so-called, is just for the Italian season.\n3:38 Comment: Frosinona their first point in Serie A history.\n3:41 Comment: I made money at Juventus Stadium.\n3:44 Comment: Which, of course, no one ever expected.\n3:48 Comment: Another mistake by Hysai.\n3:50 Comment: However, Georginho corrects this error.\n3:53 Comment: And now Hysaj is with the ball again.\n3:55 Comment: Again he is not playing too confidently.\n3:59 Comment: Here he is.\n4:1 Comment: Right back for the Neapolitans.\n4:5 Comment: Throws from behind the side.\n4:6 Comment: Eguain.\n4:8 Comment: Kilin was ahead of him.\n4:9 Comment: Kulebali.\n4:11 Comment: Powerful Kulebali.\n4:13 Comment: The ball is intercepted.\n4:15 Comment: Lemina.\n4:17 Comment: And the ball goes out of bounds.\n4:20 Comment: Lemina is playing her third match in the starting lineup for Juventus.\n4:23 Comment: Third match in a row.\n4:25 Comment: You can treat it differently.\n4:27 Comment: One of the reasons is that Hidiro and Marchisio are still injured.\n4:31 Comment: Juventus' two leading players.\n4:33 Comment: But, nevertheless, despite the fact that the composition rotates very much,\n4:37 Comment: Olegria Lemina again plays in the starting lineup in the third match.\n4:42 Comment: This is also probably a very, very interesting moment.\n4:45 Comment: Moreover, today there is Kuadu Asamue in reserve.\n4:47 Comment: Moreover, today Stefano Sturaro is in reserve,\n4:51 Comment: who played the first match from bell to bell at Juve.\n4:54 Comment: And today there remains...\n4:55 Comment: Juan Quadrado.\n4:56 Comment: Which, of course, is a little surprising, to be honest.\n5:0 Comment: Meanwhile, Napoleo is on the attack.\n5:3 Comment: Gamshik.\n5:7 Comment: Pass to Insigne.\n5:8 Comment: Lorenzo with the ball.\n5:10 Comment: Higuain takes the penalty kick.\n5:12 Comment: Well, the fact that Higuain is a big striker, one of the best players in the entire series,\n5:17 Comment: this is obvious, in my opinion.\n5:19 Comment: And therefore, probably only Higuain could have delivered such a masterful roundhouse kick.\n5:23 Comment: Yes, of course, above the gate.\n5:24 Comment: But nonetheless,\n5:25 Comment: what is the decision that Pepita Higuain made.\n5:28 Comment: As for Napoleo, there are also several interesting decisions by Murizo Sarri.\n5:34 Comment: Firstly, Dries Mertens remained in reserve.\n5:36 Comment: Also in reserve is Manola Gabieddini,\n5:39 Comment: David Lopez and Omar El Kadoury.\n5:42 Comment: Footballers who, in principle, have the right to count on a place in the starting lineup.\n5:45 Comment: Well, plus, of course, Christian Maggio.\n5:48 Comment: Another mistake by Juve players in midfield.\n5:51 Comment: Gamshik picks up the ball and hits it with a turn.\n5:53 Comment: Buffoon!\n5:55 Comment: But here Buffon was rather closer to a mistake, but, nevertheless, there was no one in front of him.\n6:4 Comment: Buffon played an absolutely outstanding game in Manchester in the Champions League against Man City.\n6:12 Comment: And, of course, they started talking about him again as the best goalkeeper of the last 30 years.\n6:18 Comment: Simona Dzadze is offside.\n6:20 Comment: Even two days after the game in Manchester\n6:23 Comment: There was a huge interview with Jean Luigi Busheng.\n6:25 Comment: He wore a Buffon hat.\n6:26 Comment: And in general, almost the entire newspaper was dedicated, well, the football part, specifically to Buffon.\n6:30 Comment: There was a hat with Buffon and so on.\n6:32 Comment: Of course, in Italy, Gin Luigi and his contribution to the success of all Italian football are highly valued.\n6:38 Comment: And they hope that Buffon will definitely come to the World Cup in Russia.\n6:42 Comment: And Italy itself should, of course, do this too.\n6:51 Comment: Hysai!\n6:53 Comment: Bam-bam!\n6:55 Comment: Jorginho pushes.\n6:59 Comment: Pereira.\n7:1 Comment: Jorginho.\n7:3 Comment: However, the referee did not see a violation of the rules in this situation.\n7:8 Comment: In my opinion, football.\n7:13 Comment: Hernanes. Today he plays a central midfielder, not an attacker, because this is an important moment.\n7:18 Comment: He was acquired as a track player, that is, a playmaker.\n7:21 Comment: But today, and in general, in recent matches, he is playing a little deeper in football.\n7:23 Comment: Basically, Andrea Firlo.\n7:25 Comment: Come on!\n7:26 Comment: Penalty area.\n7:27 Comment: Pogba!\n7:28 Comment: Dzadze!\n7:29 Comment: Hit through yourself.\n7:30 Comment: He almost knocked off Kulebali’s hand.\n7:31 Comment: But it's okay.\n7:32 Comment: Kulebali itself is big.\n7:33 Comment: It seems to me that he is not afraid of anything.\n7:34 Comment: Even such a blow to Simone Dzadze.\n7:35 Comment: Yes, Dzadze as a center-forward.\n7:36 Comment: Majukic equalized.\n7:37 Comment: Murata has just been restored.\n7:38 Comment: But, of course, that's not all.\n7:39 Comment: Took him.\n7:40 Comment: And so, as you can see, he didn't win.\n7:41 Comment: He didn't win.\n7:42 Comment: And so, as you can see, he didn't win.\n7:43 Comment: But, of course, that's not all.\n7:44 Comment: And so, as you can see, he didn't win.\n7:45 Comment: He didn't win.\n7:46 Comment: And so, as you can see, he didn't win.\n7:47 Comment: He didn't win.\n7:48 Comment: But, of course, that's not all.\n7:49 Comment: Hit through yourself.\n7:50 Comment: Kulebali itself is big.\n7:51 Comment: Hit through yourself.\n7:52 Comment: Majukic equalized.\n7:53 Comment: Murata has just been restored.\n7:54 Comment: And that’s why Simone Dzadze is playing in attack today\n7:58 Comment: at Juventus.\n7:59 Comment: Reinam.\n8:0 Comment: Spanish goalkeeper of Napoli.\n8:1 Comment: Which is very popular in Naples.\n8:2 Comment: Some kind of completely carefree passionate love of fans\n8:5 Comment: to him.\n8:6 Comment: Hamshek.\n8:7 Comment: Guangzhou.\n8:8 Comment: Perfectly Higuain turned around.\n8:9 Comment: But I slowed down a little with my decision.\n8:10 Comment: Alan.\n8:11 Comment: Dangerous moment.\n8:12 Comment: Buffon comes out of the gate.\n8:13 Comment: But even at the same time he does not forget to greet Gonsal\n8:16 Comment: Higuaina separately.\n8:17 Comment: Good game.\n8:18 Comment: Quite funny.\n8:19 Comment: In the first minutes.\n8:20 Comment: Patrice Evra.\n8:21 Comment: Bad pass.\n8:22 Comment: And so, as you can see, he didn't win.\n8:23 Comment: And that's why Simone Dzadze is playing today\n8:24 Comment: Juventus attack.\n8:25 Comment: Which is very popular in Naples.\n8:27 Comment: And that's why Simone Dzadze is playing today\n8:28 Comment: New York.\n8:29 Comment: And that's why Simone Dzadze is playing today\n8:30 Comment: New York.\n8:31 Comment: And that's why Simone Dzadze is playing today\n8:32 Comment: New York.\n8:33 Comment: Which he loves very much in New York.\n8:35 Comment: Patrice Evra.\n8:36 Comment: Bad pass.\n8:37 Comment: Evra did not play in the last meeting.\n8:42 Comment: Rotates them with Alex Sandro.\n8:45 Comment: Allegri.\n8:46 Comment: Sandro was purchased for a lot of money\n8:47 Comment: near Porto.\n8:48 Comment: Left back.\n8:49 Comment: Naturally, Juventus is betting on him.\n8:50 Comment: But the question is when will he play consistently?\n8:52 Comment: and when will he finally adapt to Juventus?\n8:59 Comment: and to Italy.\n9:0 Comment: Breaking the rules.\n9:1 Comment: Collejon praises Patrice Evra.\n9:2 Comment: Well, this is Massimiliano Allegri.\n9:3 Comment: Which is already criticized mercilessly by both journalists and\n9:4 Comment: fans.\n9:5 Comment: Still the whistle that was at the end of the match with Frazenon.\n9:6 Comment: This is something unforgettable.\n9:7 Comment: But, as you can see, he is no longer very fond of New York.\n9:8 Comment: And that’s why Sandro is not playing in New York today.\n9:9 Comment: Rotates them with Alex Sandro.\n9:10 Comment: Naturally, Juventus is betting on him.\n9:11 Comment: But the question is when will he play consistently?\n9:22 Comment: and, of course, will not play in New York.\n9:23 Comment: And of course this will be something that will be in his career\n9:24 Comment: in Juventus.\n9:25 Comment: But, as you can see, this is not very convenient for Massimiliano\n9:26 Comment: Allegri.\n9:27 Comment: This has never happened before in his Juventus career.\n9:28 Comment: But Allegri himself is still holding his own, in fact.\n9:29 Comment: And yesterday's press conference is proof of this.\n9:33 Comment: Let me remind you that before each match it is not the Italian series,\n9:36 Comment: and sometimes the teams have a press conference.\n9:38 Comment: So.\n9:39 Comment: As for Allegri, he stated that these\n9:42 Comment: results.\n9:43 Comment: This is a growing problem.\n9:44 Comment: And now Juventus has a crisis with results.\n9:47 Comment: And with the game, according to Max Allegri.\n9:50 Comment: And definitely, definitely more victories will come to Juventus,\n9:54 Comment: if the team plays the same way it played in\n9:59 Comment: some recent matches.\n10:1 Comment: Well, if we take a specific game with Frosenone, then here,\n10:5 Comment: Of course, the main problem is the minutes that Juventus\n10:9 Comment: spent at the end.\n10:10 Comment: Absolutely spineless and missed the victory already in\n10:13 Comment: compensated time.\n10:14 Comment: Petton, without bearing the turn of Frosenone, 36 pleasures.\n10:17 Comment: And he got hit three times, which is a record for\n10:18 Comment: the last 10 years.\n10:19 Comment: The same applies to Napoli, in fact.\n10:23 Comment: Juventus attack.\n10:24 Comment: Debava.\n10:25 Comment: Pavel Debava with the ball.\n10:26 Comment: Keeps the ball.\n10:27 Comment: Pass right, left to Patrice Ivre.\n10:28

Comment: He leaves Hernanez in brilliant fashion.\n10:36 Comment: Then pass to Lorenzo.\n10:37 Comment: There's only one left.\n10:38 Comment: Frenchman, and then.\n10:39 Comment: And so, as you see, he was immediately killed.\n10:40 Comment: The Neapolitan is picking up speed.\n10:41 Comment: And here is the action of Giorgio Chierines.\n10:42 Comment: Insinny again.\n10:43 Comment: Trip number two.\n10:44 Comment: Paduin.\n10:45 Comment: Lemina.\n10:46 Comment: Hamshek.\n10:47 Comment: Hamshek again enters from his opponent quite easily.\n10:48 Comment: Pass into the penalty area.\n10:49

ball.\n10:56 Comment: And so, as you see, he leaves Hernanez brilliant\n10:57 Comment: way.\n10:58 Comment: Then pass to Lorenzo.\n10:59 Comment: There's only one left.\n11:0 Comment: But there was simply no instability here.\n11:2 Comment: And he enters again from his opponent.\n11:3 Comment: Pass into the penalty area.\n11:4 Comment: Juventus is fighting back with great difficulty.\n11:6 Comment: Dzazan.\n11:7 Comment: Hernanes.\n11:8 Comment: Debava.\n11:9 Comment: Right to Roberto Pereira.\n11:11 Comment: And again there is no violation of the rules.\n11:15 Comment: Again Orsato does not see the foul on the players.\n11:21 Comment: And so it is.\n11:22 Comment: It separates them evenly, in principle.\n11:24 Comment: That is, I didn’t notice here, I didn’t notice there.\n11:30 Comment: And basically everyone is watching.\n11:30 Comment: satisfied.\n11:35 Comment: Nzine.\n11:36 Comment: Higuain.\n11:37 Comment: Waiting for a partner.\n11:39 Comment: And Fusai is waiting on

But\n14:45 Comment: As we see, it's a draw with Carpi. If we laugh like this\n14:48 Comment: over Juventus and its draw\n14:50 Comment: with Forsenone, then a draw with Carpi approximately\n14:52 Comment: the same. Because he's also a debutant\n14:54 Comment: series A.

Comment: First of all, in the first five matches of Serie A\n31:26 Comment: Just a misunderstanding\n31:29 Comment: Juve players' actions to each other\n31:31 Comment: And this is the main point\n31:33 Comment: Juventus problem\n31:33 Comment: The problem, in my opinion, is the old lady's at the moment.\n31:42 Comment: With the automaticity that last year's team had, it was absolutely outstanding, in my opinion.\n31:49 Comment: Then everyone understood each other literally from half a word, from half a glance.\n31:54 Comment: Now there is no such thing.\n31:56 Comment: And this, again, is understandable from the point of view of the large number of new players.\n32:1 Comment: And, accordingly, the absence of last year’s backbone, I mean Pirlo, Vidal and Tevez.\n32:7 Comment: Pereiro picks up speed.\n32:9 Comment: Debava gets the ball.\n32:12 Comment: Pass to Pogba with the ball from the Frenchman.\n32:15 Comment: Well, again, you see, again a rather simple situation.\n32:19 Comment: Pereiro did not understand Pogba's plan.\n32:21 Comment: And this is Encini on the left flank.\n32:23 Comment: He rushes forward towards the other goal.\n32:27 Comment: Pass to Higuain.\n32:28 Comment: Kirin is good here.\n32:30 Comment: Well, the rest is simple.\n32:31 Comment: Killini is asking for a foot, which, in fact, is what the defender of the Italian national team earns.\n32:39 Comment: Hernanes.\n32:40 Comment: Evraan.\n32:45 Comment: Not the most accurate pass from Hernanes to Pogba.\n32:50 Comment: But Juve still has the ball.\n32:53 Comment: Killini.\n32:57 Comment: Debava.\n32:59 Comment: Easily.\n33:0 Comment: Jorginho Pavlo Debava took the ball away.\n33:4 Comment: Gamcheik.\n33:6 Comment: Pass forward.\n33:7 Comment: Killini.\n33:7 Comment: Okay ball.\n33:9 Comment: Stopped it.\n33:10 Comment: But what the partners did next is not entirely clear.\n33:12 Comment: It is obvious that Paduin still looks somewhat clumsy on the right flank.\n33:19 Comment: Defense, but essentially there is no alternative to Paduin now.\n33:21 Comment: There is another alternative.\n33:22 Comment: Play according to the 3-5-2 scheme.\n33:24 Comment: And release Juan Quadrata in the place of the right waterman.\n33:29 Comment: It's probable.\n33:30 Comment: I think I was considering this option.\n33:36 Comment: Olegre.\n33:37 Comment: This is still a very, very likely scenario for the second half.\n33:42 Comment: Dangerous moment.\n33:43 Comment: Kuze Kavihon in this situation dropped the ball to the center.\n33:46 Comment: If the ball had gone there, into that zone, there would, of course, have been absolutely alone Gonzalo Higuain.\n33:50 Comment: But Killini is here...\n33:56 Comment: Played reliably.\n34:0 Comment: Into the corner kick.\n34:2 Comment: By the way, colleagues from Sky Sports suggested to the Italian that this is exactly how Juve will play 3-5-2 today.\n34:8 Comment: But he surprised, surprised Olegre with his formation in the starting lineup.\n34:17 Comment: Jorginho.\n34:20 Comment: Innings.\n34:21 Comment: Hernanovs plays well with his head.\n34:23 Comment: And breaking the rules.\n34:25 Comment: Push.\n34:28 Comment: From the outside.\n34:30 Comment: Coulibaly.\n34:33 Comment: Yes, it was Coulibaly who pushed.\n34:38 Comment: Brazilians.\n34:46 Comment: Killini began to bleed.\n34:47 Comment: Quite a traditional sight.\n34:49 Comment: I think few people are surprised by this.\n34:55 Comment: You might be surprised.\n34:57 Comment: Because, actually, Killini, it seems to me, is 50%.\n35:0 Comment: The match is played by the one who is screwed, bandaged, and so on.\n35:3 Comment: Dzadze.\n35:5 Comment: But Dzadze, apart from that blow, is actually not as useful as Max Olegre would probably like.\n35:14 Comment: But Alvaro Muratko is in reserve.\n35:16 Comment: Let's not forget about him.\n35:17 Comment: He's on the bench.\n35:19 Comment: And he, of course, hopes to take the field in the second half.\n35:25 Comment: The attacker is an old gentleman.\n35:26 Comment: Let's look at the goal again.\n35:31 Comment: And Insigne's excellent action in this situation.\n35:36 Comment: But Insigne.\n35:41 Comment: Even, even, even, even Delaureidis began to jump up and down, hinting that he was not a fan after all.\n35:50 Comment: And not Juventini, let's say.\n35:56 Comment: Yes, Albiol also has blood.\n35:58 Comment: He needs help too.\n35:59 Comment: There is such a pause in our match now.\n36:3 Comment: As for Lorenzo Insigne, this is his third goal of the season.\n36:11 Comment: And indeed, for now he is the leader of the team along with Gonzala Guaino.\n36:17 Comment: Provides assistance to Albiola.\n36:18 Comment: But Eventus puts the ball into play.\n36:20 Comment: Naturally, he returns to the field.\n36:22 Comment: I have no doubt about it.\n36:23 Comment: Yes, Simon Edzadze passes the ball to Koulibaly.\n36:26 Comment: 1-0.\n36:27 Comment: On the field ahead in the match against Yue.\n36:39 Comment: Take your time.\n36:43 Comment: Petereina.\n36:45 Comment: Where? Go ahead now.\n36:48 Comment: On Guaino.\n36:50 Comment: You can play.\n36:51 Comment: Orsato shows again.\n36:55 Comment: Gamzhik.\n36:56 Comment: Coulibaly.\n37:0 Comment: Fine.\n37:1 Comment: On Gamzhik, to further come up with Marik.\n37:5 Comment: Turned around.\n37:6 Comment: Marik Gamzhik turns around again.\n37:9 Comment: Plays back to Koulibaly.\n37:11 Comment: Alan.\n37:13 Comment: Higuain.\n37:13 Comment: Napoli still have the ball.\n37:15 Comment: Pass to the right.\n37:16 Comment: Hysai.\n37:17 Comment: Picks up speed.\n37:18 Comment: Hysai.\n37:19 Comment: Higuain.\n37:20 Comment: Playing along again.\n37:21 Comment: Good.\n37:24 Comment: Gonzalo.\n37:26 Comment: Ghoulam.\n37:28 Comment: Gamzhik.\n37:31 Comment: Continier.\n37:32 Comment: It’s very easy for Napoli to control the ball now.\n37:39 Comment: And of course we need pressure from Yue.\n37:41 Comment: Petereira.\n37:42 Comment: Trying.\n37:43 Comment: Well, of course, it’s difficult to put pressure on oneself.\n37:48 Comment: Reinan.\n37:49 Comment: These are the options.\n37:50 Comment: Long kick forward.\n37:51 Comment: There will be a struggle here.\n37:52 Comment: Evacuation.\n37:53 Comment:

anyone.\n38:39 Comment: So this is the most unpleasant moment.\n38:42 Comment: Although you see, Higuain is asking for a replacement for Insigne.\n38:45 Comment: And Insigny himself seems to reject it.\n38:49 Comment: Although the replacement happened one way or another.\n38:51 Comment: Yes.\n38:52 Comment: Driesmertens.\n38:53 Comment: Probably worse for Juventus because Driesmertens\n38:56

By the way, in the last days of the transfer window,\n42:11 Comment: even more likely in the first three years,\n42:13 Comment: they were in the first part.\n42:15 Comment: And this was very important.\n42:16 Comment: Even more likely in the first days of September,\n42:18 Comment: after the transfer window closes,\n42:20 Comment: the curtain opened.\n42:23 Comment: The curtain on some of the nuances of the transfer market.\n42:28 Comment: And so, accordingly, as stated in Juve,\n42:32 Comment: Juventus made an offer to Napola to buy Hamsik's stamps.\n42:36 Comment: And it seems, as some sources say,\n42:38 Comment: Hamshik himself was not against moving to Turin,\n42:41 Comment: but De Laurentiis categorically refused to sell it.\n42:45 Comment: To Juventus even for 30 million euros.\n42:55 Comment: In fact, Hamshik is very popular in Naples.\n42:59 Comment: He is, in fact, an idol, an idol for the Neapolitan diffusion.\n43:7 Comment: The end of the first half is in Sao

of course, the referee was offside, by the way.\n43:39 Comment: And the referee recorded it, of course, so, in fact,\n43:41 Comment: the whole issue of handling the ball on Dzadze’s part is no longer relevant.\n43:51 Comment: What options do trainers have?\n43:59 Comment: Sari, who I think is happy with the first half, has his team winning 1-0.\n44:3 Comment: Sari certainly has supplies.\n44:5 Comment: Transition to the ball.\n44:9 Comment: Addresses to the right.\n44:12 Comment: Perhaps Napoli's attack is dangerous.\n44:15 Comment: No ball.\n44:16 Comment: The Neapolitans already control the center of the field.\n44:19 Comment: So, Ivan Strinich is in reserve, but he is a left back.\n44:22 Comment: I think this ball is not relevant.\n44:24 Comment: There is Kirikish, a central defender.\n44:27 Comment: There is Christian Maggio, there is Mirko Valdifiori.\n44:29 Comment: From the attack group, of course, Gabiadini, of course, El Kadoury.\n44:33 Comment: But Napoli has already made one substitution.\n44:36 Comment: Dries Mertens replaces Insigne.\n44:38 Comment: Well, it's not his fault.\n44:39 Comment: Lorenzo's injury.\n44:40 Comment: Left the field.\n44:42 Comment: Juventus is much more interesting.\n44:44 Comment: There is a Quadrado in stock here.\n44:47 Comment: There's Muranto in stock here.\n44:49 Comment: These are two obvious candidates to take

Comment: At the same time, madly in love with football.\n14:9 Comment: And for many years he kept this passion within himself.\n14:14 Comment: At the same time, he loved football not as a fan, but as a keen connoisseur of football.\n14:19 Comment: Because he studied football tactics very deeply.\n14:22 Comment: He analyzed every football match very deeply.\n14:25 Comment: And then at some point I realized that I shouldn’t keep it all to myself, but...\n14:32 Comment: Respectively...\n14:34 Comment: Try something new for yourself in your profession.\n14:37 Comment: Dries Mertens.\n14:38

to work.\n14:51 Comment: Started from the very bottom.\n14:53 Comment: And eventually he reached coach Empoli.\n14:56 Comment: Moreover, curiously, Muri Sosari made his debut in Serie A at the age of 56.\n15:2 Comment: Which, of course, is a very serious age for a coach.\n15:4 Comment: But this is precisely because he began to engage in this profession late.\n15:12 Comment: He is held in very high esteem by Oregusaki.\n15:16 Comment: But Oregusaki doesn't need any introduction.\n15:18 Comment: He is, in fact, a master not only of the Italian, but of the entire European coaching workshop.\n15:27 Comment: A man who, in fact, did a lot for the game to develop and Italian football to develop.\n15:37 Comment: Half an hour before the end of the match.\n15:39 Comment: It seems to me that Juventus needs replacements.\n15:43 Comment: So that Juventus can at least somehow count on...\n15:48 Comment: At least there's already a goal.\n15:53 Comment: But he doesn’t make them yet.\n15:56 Comment: Massimiliano Allegri.\n15:59 Comment: And that's a little surprising.\n16:1 Comment: Both Murata and Cuadrado are in reserve.\n16:3 Comment: That Rismertens falls here.\n16:5 Comment: He asks Orsatu to get up.\n16:7 Comment: There was no foul, as he believes.\n16:8 Comment: But since there was no foul, he shows a yellow card to Mertus for simulation.\n16:13 Comment: Therefore, Mertus can be understood here.\n16:17 Comment: But one cannot understand Hernanus.\n16:18 Comment: Another mistake from the Brazilian.\n16:20 Comment: Higuain.\n16:20 Comment: He's already in the penalty area.\n16:21 Comment: Gonzalo hits.\n16:22 Comment: Bufon.\n16:23 Comment: And 2-0.\n16:24 Comment: Pepita Higuain.\n16:29 Comment: Gonzalo Higuain.\n16:30 Comment: A brilliant goal.\n16:31 Comment: A brilliant goal by Gonzalo Higuain.\n16:33 Comment: And, of course, the absolutely terrible game of the Brazilian Hernanus.\n16:39 Comment: But it caught my eye.\n16:41 Comment: It caught my eye.\n16:42 Comment: And the first half.\n16:43 Comment: And the second half.\n16:44 Comment: I'm just surprised Allegri didn't replace him.\n16:48 Comment: And it wasn't.\n16:49 Comment: The game in the midfield of Viventus is absolutely not going well.\n16:51 Comment: Precisely because of the Brazilian’s not the most competent actions.\n16:55 Comment: This is such an ugly show.\n16:57 Comment: Higuain intercepts the ball.\n17:0 Comment: Beats Banucci.\n17:1 Comment: But this is Higuain.\n17:2 Comment: This is one of the best forwards in Europe.\n17:7 Comment: A wonderful blow.\n17:8 Comment: Well, you can probably blame Bufon because he should have parried the blow.\n17:13 Comment: Because the blow was, yes, strong.\n17:16 Comment: But at the same time Bufon hit the ball.\n17:18 Comment: But...\n17:19 Comment: In any case, this was initially a mistake by another Viventus football player.\n17:27 Comment: Brazilian Hernanus.\n17:30 Comment: Now we are already at the edge of the square field.\n17:32 Comment: But was Allegri too late?\n17:35 Comment: That is the question.\n17:37 Comment: Ebra.\n17:40 Comment: Dibalo.\n17:41 Comment: Dangerous moment.\n17:42 Comment: No, Dibalo releases the ball far.\n17:45 Comment: Dibalo serves.\n17:46 Comment: Dibalo.\n17:47 Comment: Tribes.\n17:48 Comment: And a goal!\n17:48 Comment: Goal!\n17:52 Comment: First goal.\n17:53 Comment: Mario Lemina in a Juventus jersey.\n17:56 Comment: That's it literally.\n17:57 Comment: Shootout.\n17:58 Comment: It just happened.\n17:59 Comment: Gonzal Eguain scored.\n18:1 Comment: And then Juventus responded.\n18:4 Comment: Padriz Ebra threw the ball towards Tsadze.\n18:8 Comment: Dibalo picked up the ball.\n18:9 Comment: Poorly processed.\n18:10 Comment: But then Dibalo did everything correctly.\n18:12 Comment: Coulibaly and Ghoulam missed at the far post here.\n18:16 Comment: And then he finished the ball.\n18:17 Comment: Naturally.\n18:18 Comment: And Mario Lemina.\n18:19 Comment: The score is 2-1.\n18:20 Comment: The replacement we've been waiting for.\n18:22 Comment: Hernanes, who played poorly today, leaves the field.\n18:26 Comment: And instead of it, the Colombian Quadrado.\n18:28 Comment: 2-1.\n18:30 Comment: And our match really turns out to be the brightest\n18:32 Comment: so far in the Italian Championship in less than six rounds.\n18:37 Comment: Match Napoleo-Juventus.\n18:38 Comment: Crazy scenario.\n18:40 Comment: And this is not the end yet.\n18:41 Comment: There is still a good half hour of this performance ahead.\n18:46 Comment: on Sao Paolo.\n18:47 Comment: 2-1.\n18:48 Comment: Napoleo.\n18:49 Comment: Guainstowe is ahead with the ball.\n18:53 Comment: Goncalo was greedy.\n18:55 Comment: Meanwhile, a shot.\n18:57 Comment: Alan.\n18:58 Comment: Transfer back.\n19:0 Comment: Georginho.\n19:2 Comment: Yes, that’s how Mario Lemina still played football fairly.\n19:6 Comment: You know, Lemina of all three central midfielders\n19:9 Comment: Juventus stood out.\n19:11 Comment: In the match he played much better than Hernanes, much better than Pogba.\n19:16 Comment: Although Pogba, of course, was not.\n19:17 Comment: Pogba, of course, takes on a slightly different functionality.\n19:20 Comment: Paul takes over the leadership functions.\n19:23 Comment: Well, Lemina was useful.\n19:25 Comment: He, in fact, played very competently.\n19:27 Comment: He held the ball for Juventus.\n19:29 Comment: But, in fact, Lemina scored.\n19:31 Comment: Which, it seems to me, is fair if we take Juve’s performance in this match as a whole.\n19:40 Comment: Devra.\n19:44 Comment: Pass to Zazo.\n19:47 Comment: Square and violation of the rules on the part of Simona Dzadze.\n19:51 Comment: The referee shows.\n19:59 Comment: What was there? We will analyze the moments on repeat.\n20:2 Comment: Well, it’s interesting that Dzadze fouled.\n20:5 Comment: It turns out that if you take the fall in a tackle against Kvadrat to a greater extent.\n20:9 Comment: But it seems to me that I had a fall there before.\n20:11 Comment: It wasn't a tackle, but something else. Breaking the rules.\n20:15 Comment: I just haven't figured out what exactly.\n20:17 Comment: Maybe somewhere he pushed Napoli player Simon Dzadze.\n20:25 Comment: Alan.\n20:28 Comment: Gulebali.\n20:31 Comment: Albiol.\n20:32 Comment: Alan.\n20:34 Comment: Pass to the right. Calihon.\n20:38 Comment: Pogba.\n20:40 Comment: Didn't enter the game again. Kelina. Gamshik. Aguain.\n20:43 Comment: Turn left to Mertens.\n20:48 Comment: Belgian with the ball. He is certainly not as fierce as Insigne in the first half.\n20:53 Comment: And now we understand why Sari, in fact, chose Insigny and not Mertens.\n20:58 Comment: Belgian with the ball again. Poduain.\n21:0 Comment: These poduain with...\n21:3 Comment: They cope with Mertens. But he didn’t do very well with Insigny.\n21:8 Comment: Ghoulam. Beat Kvadrata. Ghoulam. Turning kick.\n21:11 Comment: A difficult blow for Buffon, but John Luigi saved his team.\n21:18 Comment: Pogba. Georginho presses him again.\n21:21 Comment: Kelina.\n21:24 Comment: Pavlo Dibava. Yes, the Argentine also fails to play clearly.\n21:30 Comment: If we talk about the replacement that happened, it is clear that Kvadrata does not play the central halfback.\n21:36 Comment: Mario Lemina landed there.\n21:38 Comment: But Kvadrat is still played by a closer group.\n21:40 Comment: He plays as a right winger.\n21:47 Comment: Actually, he took his traditional position on the football field.\n21:50 Comment: Juan Quadratu. Colombian midfielder.\n21:59 Comment: Alan.\n22:6 Comment: Euro.\n22:7 Comment: Soft.\n22:9 Comment: The ball is knocked out of bounds by a bullet.\n22:16 Comment: Albiol.\n22:20 Comment: Again with the ball.\n22:21 Comment: Albiol. Pass to the right.\n22:26 Comment: Debrah.\n22:31 Comment: You can play.\n22:32 Comment: Gamshik.\n22:34 Comment: Lemina put up the body.\n22:39 Comment: Mertens.\n22:40 Comment: He took the ball to Kvadrat. According to the referee, clean.\n22:44 Comment: And in front of him the entire flank is free. Coulibaly appears in front of him. What will Kvadrat come up with?\n22:50 Comment: Pass to Pogba. There's Pereira on the left.\n22:52 Comment: Pogba shoots himself and hits the target.\n22:56 Comment: Pepperini.\n22:57 Comment: Well, Pogba took the lead.\n23:0 Comment: He has a good shot. True, it’s still a strike from the right foot, and not from the left. I struck from the left here.\n23:5 Comment: Paul Pogba.\n23:6 Comment: Far away\n23:7 Comment: In this case, Dries Mertens earns a corner.\n23:14 Comment: He failed to beat his opponent.\n23:18 Comment: Let's look at the goal again.\n23:21 Comment: Which was scored by Mario Lemina.\n23:24 Comment: Let me remind you that the football player is from Marseille. Central midfielder. And now many compare him with Arturo Vidal.\n23:30 Comment: Well, it’s clear that nostalgia is such a stubborn thing.\n23:34 Comment: And it is clear that many are looking for the former.\n23:36 Comment: Former heroes in new faces.\n23:39 Comment: In Juventus. But from Mario Lemina the style of play is similar to Pogba.\n23:43 Comment: Well, of course, Pogba is a footballer of a different scale. But he became one at Juventus.\n23:47 Comment: Maybe the same thing awaits Lemina.\n23:50 Comment: Which, let me remind you, is leased.\n23:52 Comment: He came from Marseilles. The buyout at the end of the season is 12 million euros.\n24:1 Comment: Georgignon.\n24:2 Comment: The first standard failed poorly.\n24:11 Comment: Higuain, who promises to return the Champions League to Naples.\n24:15 Comment: This is his main motivation for the season.\n24:17 Comment: As he himself stated recently in an interview with Italian media.\n24:20 Comment: Naples football players played the ball.\n24:23 Comment: Georgignon.\n24:26 Comment: No offside.\n24:28 Comment: Mertens. Good pass from Gumshy. Compass point.\n24:32 Comment: But this is Callajo's mistake. But he had to close the far post.\n24:36 Comment: Or at least rush there. As a result, he remained in this half position.\n24:40 Comment: Juventus has one more substitution, of course.\n24:44 Comment: But this is not the second, this is number 21. Of course I was wrong.\n24:47 Comment: The reserve referee from Pavel Dybala made a mistake. There's just the wrong number on there.\n24:52 Comment: Juve simply doesn’t have a second number, by the way.\n24:55 Comment: Yes, Pavel Dybala is leaving the field.\n24:58 Comment: Well, the word failed is too harsh.\n25:1 Comment: It's probably just a bad match for Dybala.\n25:5 Comment: Dybala is going to rest. And instead of him Alvaro Moratto.\n25:17 Comment: Who was injured in Genoa last weekend.\n25:22 Comment: But within a week he came to his senses and was ready for at least 20 minutes of this exciting meeting in the square.\n25:31 Comment: Pass forward and Moratto!\n25:33 Comment: No, Moratto, of course, won’t be in time for this ball.\n25:35 Comment: Now Juve is back in a 4-3-3 formation.\n25:38 Comment: If Juve played in the first half according to the 4-3-1-2 scheme, now this is exactly the scheme with two insiders.\n25:52 Comment: Although maybe I'm wrong. Although it's possible...\n25:55 Comment: But, in general, Max Olegre remains the first choice.\n26:4 Comment: We'll figure it out in the minutes remaining before the end of the match.\n26:8 Comment: Coulibaly!\n26:9 Comment: Higuain!\n26:13 Comment: Buffon comes out of the gate.\n26:16 Comment: Pogba!\n26:17 Comment: Fusai!\n26:19 Comment: Today the Albanian Pogba completely outplayed.\n26:21 Comment: Pogba!\n26:24 Comment: He is, of course, not a majo in terms of connecting forward, but...\n26:28 Comment: He blocked everything on his flank. Lemina is good at tackling again.\n26:31 Comment: Quadrado!\n26:34 Comment: Quadrado technique!\n26:36 Comment: Gamshik enters the selection and breaks the rules.\n26:46 Comment: Certainly...\n26:48 Comment: The sharpness of a crazy Quadrado.\n26:50 Comment: It seems to me that he can literally beat any football player in the world from a standing start.\n26:54 Comment: Evran!\n26:55 Comment: Lemina!\n26:56 Comment: Paduin!\n26:57 Comment: Paduin left the ball in the game!\n26:58 Comment: Pereira!\n26:59 Comment: Is it dangerous!\n27:0 Comment: Murata!\n27:1 Comment: Murata's kick!\n27:2 Comment: Next to the barbell!\n27:3 Comment: Yes, I think now, of course, many people remembered the goal in Manchester City that Murata scored.\n27:6 Comment: Alvaro then had a crazy left-footed kick.\n27:8 Comment: Here was an even more convenient position.\n27:9 Comment: Football game.\n27:16 Comment: Well, about central support.\n27:17 Comment: Now the movement will be different.\n27:18

last Champions League.\n27:49 Comment: We remember Galli Murat, the gate of Barusi Dortmund.\n27:54 Comment: As many as three.\n27:55 Comment: We remember two goals against Real Madrid.\n27:59 Comment: Especially the decisive goal in Madrid.\n28:3 Comment: And of course there was the final Champions League, which then returned Juventus to the game at the Olympics.\n28:10 Comment: In the stadium in Berlin.\n28:13 Comment: Well, this year Murata scored.\n28:17 Comment: I repeat, a very cool goal against Manchester City.\n28:19 Comment: A very important goal against Manchester City.\n28:21 Comment: Hamshik, it’s time for Napoli to get into the game too.\n28:27 Comment: Mertens.\n28:30 Comment: Top 2.\n28:33 Comment: Murata, Murata.\n28:35 Comment: I beat Hysai, but it was a violation of the rules.\n28:43 Comment: The players are tired, you can see it in them.\n28:46 Comment: The pace is crazy.\n28:48 Comment: In this meeting, Italy is often criticized for not having the highest speed.\n28:55 Comment: But today is not the case.\n28:56 Comment: Today is a completely different example when, in principle, the match looks good.\n29:0 Comment: The whole game looks good.\n29:1 Comment: Not excerpts, but the whole game in one go.\n29:5 Comment: Banucci.\n29:7 Comment: Murata.\n29:11 Comment: There is no violation of the rules.\n29:13 Comment: Counts.\n29:15

moment.\n29:33 Comment: Albiol literally crashed into Pogba.\n29:35 Comment: It was clear that Albiol was flying with only one purpose.\n29:38 Comment: And foul against Pogba.\n29:41 Comment: But Pogba, of course,\n29:43 Comment: strong guy.\n29:44 Comment: You can't just break it.\n29:50 Comment: Free kick.\n29:56 Comment: Square ball.\n29:57 Comment: Apparently there will be a supply.\n30:2 Comment: Simona Dzadze.\n30:5 Comment: On the cutting edge.\n30:7 Comment: Naturally, attention is paid to him.\n30:10 Comment: And breaking the rules.\n30:11 Comment: And two football players attacked on the lawn.\n30:14 Comment: Because they fell simultaneously.\n30:16 Comment: And, in fact, they helped each other.\n30:17 Comment: Rise Hysaj and Albiol.\n30:20 Comment: Yes, Hysaj

Hamsik.\n34:29 Comment: Obviously, this is a strengthening of the center of the field from a defensive point of view.\n34:36 Comment: Because Hamsik, of course, is an attacking footballer.\n34:38 Comment: Well, as for Lopez, he is, of course, a player in the supporting zone.\n34:42 Comment: Now, in fact, Napoleon still has both Alan and Jorginho.\n34:47 Comment: And Lopez also enters the field.\n34:49 Comment: Three players who are more inclined to defend in the center of the field rather than attack.\n34:54 Comment: This is the solution from Mauritso Sarim.\n35:5 Comment: Lemina.\n35:7 Comment: French with the ball.\n35:8 Comment: Pass to Paduina.\n35:10 Comment: Yes, without Lichsteiner, without Casseras.\n35:12 Comment: Of course, Eventus’ right flank sags

hit the target.\n37:27 Comment: There was just a significant moment when Lopez,\n37:32 Comment: Alan and Georginio were in the lineup.\n37:33 Comment: And so, as you can see, he didn't win.\n37:34 Comment: He didn't win.\n37:36 Comment: And so, as you can see, he didn't win.\n37:37 Comment: So, Mzątsky is like that.\n37:39 Comment: He predicted the feeling.\n37:40 Comment: He did it virtually.\n37:41 Comment: 2-2.\n37:42 Comment: Not Pro, by pineapple.\n37:43 Comment: Yes, not for some reason.\n37:44 Comment: And so it was.\n37:45 Comment: Well, we'll see how it isね-yes.\n37:48

    "summary": "In an electrifying showdown at the Stadio San Paolo, Napoli emerged victorious over Juventus with a 2-1 scoreline. This match was a tale of two halves, characterized by tactical battles, moments of individual brilliance, and consequent strategic plays that kept fans on the edge of their seats.\n\n**First Half Summary:**\n\nThe game kicked off with Napoli displaying an aggressive intent right from the start. Both teams had to adapt to new line-ups compared to the previous season, with several newcomers on display. An early exchange highlighted the importance of the Brazilian midfielder Allan and the undeniable leadership of Napoli’s captain Marek Hamsik. Juve's Paul Pogba also showcased his flair, attempting to set a rhythm by passing the ball to Simone Zaza, who struggled with his first touch.\n\nNapoli's initial offensive push saw Hamsik and Lorenzo Insigne combining brilliantly, creating a promising attack that was eventually contained by Juventus’ defense. The energy exuded in the early minutes was palpable, with Napoli dominating possession and pushing forward continuously. Gonzalo Higuain, Napoli's star striker, demonstrated why he is regarded as one of Serie A’s top performers, frequently testing Juventus’ defense with his movements and attempts.\n\nAround the 20th minute mark, the game seemed to shift slightly as Juventus started gaining control. Despite their efforts, they couldn't convert possession into goals. A noteworthy moment came when Paul Pogba, amidst Juventus' build-up play, hit a powerful yet unsuccessful attempt towards Napoli’s goal. On the other side, Napoli remained focused, with Allan stealing the ball elegantly from Roberto Pereyra, further igniting their forward momentum.\n\nThe breakthrough arrived in the 26th minute for Napoli when a beautifully executed move saw Higuain assisting Insigne, who finished deftly past Buffon, thus breaking the deadlock with a precise shot to give Napoli a 1-0 lead. This goal ignited a roar from the home crowd, underscoring the significance of taking the lead against a formidable rival like Juventus.\n\nJuventus, railing from the goal conceded, attempted to bounce back immediately. Higuain took command again, nearly scoring himself but being thwarted by a resolute Juventus defense led by Giorgio Chiellini. However, as Juventus pressed for an equalizer, it became evident that they missed the creative genius of Andrea Pirlo, who had moved to Major League Soccer. Hernanes, who had been given the pivot role, struggled to fill these large shoes effectively. \n\nAs the first half progressed, Napoli continued to push hard. Several coordinated efforts between Insigne, Hamsik, and Allan penned Juventus deep into their own half. Several crosses and long-range attempts from both sides punctuated the closing minutes of the first half. Despite their best efforts, no more goals were scored, and the referee blew the whistle with Napoli maintaining their 1-0 lead at halftime.\n\n**Second Half Summary:**\n\nAs the second half commenced, quite a few tactical adjustments were anticipated. Both teams emerged from the tunnel with renewed vigor. Juventus in particular, needed a different strategy to try and wrestle control back from Napoli and stage a comeback.\n\nJust minutes into the second half, Simone Padoin, performing on the right for Juventus, linked various plays attempting to find breaches in Napoli’s lines. Yet, they were still finding it challenging to break through Napoli's robust defense. Yet another chance came when Patrice Evra, positioned on the left wing, launched a cross aiming towards Zaza but was intercepted by Raul Albiol.\n\nNapoli, relying heavily on the solid performances of Hysaj and Koulibaly, were resilient in their defensive duties. Giorgio Chiellini in the 54th minute attempted a header directed at goal from a corner taken by Paulo Dybala, but it sailed over Buffon's goal, marking another missed opportunity. \n\nIn the 62nd minute, Higuain truly showcased his footballing intelligence and prowess. Juventus’ Hernanes, who had been underperforming, made a crucial error leading to Higuain getting the ball, eluding Banucci and firing a powerful strike, extending Napoli's lead to 2-0. Buffon managed to get a touch, but it was insufficient to prevent the goal. This moment marked the culmination of consistent pressure by Napoli, capitalizing on a mistake from their opposition.\n\nMinutes later, Juventus displayed resilience by closing the gap. Pogba made an assertive effort pushing forward, passing to Paulo Dybala who sent in an incisive cross to Mario Lemina. Lemina, positioned well, calmly poked the ball into the net past Napoli’s keeper Reina, bringing the score to 2-1 in the 64th minute. This gave Juventus a glimmer of hope triggering a surge in their offensive efforts.\n\nJuventus' coach Massimiliano Allegri, sensing the need for further impact, made alternate tactical substitutions. He brought on Juan Cuadrado to replace the struggling Hernanes, reinforcing the attack down the wings with a more dynamic approach. Cuadrado's vibrancy added a new dimension to Juventus’s subsequent attacks.\n\nAn interesting shift saw Juventus transitioning into a 4-3-3 formation, featuring Alvaro Morata alongside Dybala. However, challenges continued as Pogba was consistently marked tightly by Napoli’s midfield trio. Juventus kept pressing, with notable efforts from Morata, who attempted a long-distance shot that narrowly missed the post.\n\nThe endgame was characterized by a frenetic pace as both sides sought to add to their goal tally. Higuain, who had been impactful throughout, gave way to Manolo Gabbiadini, reinforcing defensive stability with fresh legs. Juventus’ continued attempts saw them earning multiple corners, but emphatic defensive clearances by Koulibaly denied them repeatedly.\n\nUnfortunately for Juventus, the disciplined defensive setup by Maurizio Sarri's men maintained their lead. Despite their tireless efforts and an additional three-minute stoppage time, Juventus were unable to break through Napoli’s resolute defense again.\n\nIn closing, the game conclusively demonstrated Napoli’s attacking flair coupled with defensive solidity, earning them a hard-fought 2-1 victory over Juventus. The performance of key players like Higuain and Insigne highlighted Napoli’s ambitious Scudetto aspirations, while Juventus had to reassess their start to the season and aim to regain momentum swiftly. The ramifications of this match would extend further, as Juventus faced the uphill task of closing the gap in Serie A standing while Lightning struck in Naples, etching another historic and exhilarating fixture in the annals of Italian Football."
