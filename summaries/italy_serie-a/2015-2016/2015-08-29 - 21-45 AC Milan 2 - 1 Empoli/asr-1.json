In the background Gianpaolo, here Mianovic is as curious as the two coaches\n3:40 Comment: have the same games, the same benches in a series of 158. Antonelli\n3:46 Comment: does not pass and the ball in the former Cagliano of Genoa. Try to leave Puccerelli,\n3:49 Comment: Saponara, Diussé pressured by De Jong. He risks Diussé also because in the picture\n3:54 Comment: there's the cow, at the end the ball in black for Barba and then Skorupski. Diussé.\n4:4 Comment: Mario Rui, Diussé, vertical for Maccarone, Zapata attacks him, defends the ball\n4:9 Comment: Maccarone, he needs support, there is no foul, he was very close to Giacomelli,\n4:13 Comment: do it vertically, closes well, berry on Luisa Adriano. Mario Rui, look for the\n4:18 Comment: number, loses the ball on Bertolacci's double. Suso.\n4:25 Comment: Adriano approaches, the ball again for Bertolacci. Suso, De Jong, Suso, go\n4:34 Comment: inside, bacca, Suso looks for him, he has understood everything, Barba closing, then Mario Rui in\n4:38 Comment: advance, put the ball, but directly corner kick, arrives in the first corner\n4:42 Comment: of the match away from Milan.

Between the Sabonara lines, it has expanded to\n5:17 Comment: Macchiarone Sabonara, tries to surprise Diego Lopez, he saw him do some\n5:20 Comment: poles. An attempt that was far too unrealistic, a ball that ended up far away\n5:24 Comment: from the AC Milan goal. Unrealistic seems like the right adjective to me, also because\n5:28 Comment: Diego Lopez was practically on the goal line, he was not advanced at all,\n5:32 Comment: the ball went out 5 or 6 metres, but it's difficult to play, Empoli a lot\n5:36 Comment: compact, very aggressive, even Milan is unable to put the ball on the ground,\n5:39 Comment: to make quality plays. Giussè, a boy, is highlighting himself\n5:45 Comment: he looks much older than his age, he's not 18 yet, really\n5:48 Comment: great personality. Antonelli loses the ball under pressure from Zelischi,\n5:55 Comment: Nocerino, in the vertical for Bacca, sets the Colombian, the opening was\n5:59 Comment: completely out of proportion. He applauds the play of his teammate Bertolacci,\n6:3 Comment: the initiative more than anything else, because the passage was completely out of proportion.\n6:7 Comment: However, this is a mistake that Milan should try not to make,\n6:12 Comment: because there aren't many opportunities to get out, at least at the beginning of the game\n6:17 Comment: from pressing. In this case there was the easy passage, the discharge to the outside\n6:20 Comment: easy, Bacca got it wrong. Bertolacci's initiative knocks Giussè down,\n6:24 Comment: without committing a blunder though. Alexia, a Genoa player, complains\n6:27 Comment: then D'Astuzia, Macchiarone, steals the ball, Empoli's counterattack starts with\n6:30 Comment: Sabonara attacking centrally. Ball for Puccarelli, Antonelli is in front,\n6:33 Comment: tries to get into the shooting area, Puccarelli widens to the right, where Zambelli arrives in support.\n6:37 Comment: Alexia Prisciano orders himself for the cross, but it is blocked by Antonelli.\n6:40 Comment: Facol Sinistro puts it in the middle, looks for Puccarelli's number who goes to shoot,\n6:45 Comment: he doesn't give him space to Romagnoli, the ball goes out, he reaches the corner in favor of Empoli.\n6:50 Comment: A terrible exit from the defensive line by Desiglio who attempted an advance\n6:53 Comment: on Macchiarone. A movement of the Empoli attacker's body was enough to\n6:57 Comment: throw Desiglio out of time and create this interesting assumption on the right.\n7:3 Comment: Cross. Diosses. Misunderstanding with Zelinski who didn't expect the pass,\n7:16 Comment: the throw-in was given to Milan. Diossè will turn 18 in September.\n7:24 Comment: She arrived in Italy in 2010 from Dakar to join her father, who had moved\n7:32 Comment: in Italy for work. It is clear that we cannot expect from him what Valdifiori did\n7:36 Comment: last year, a player of vastly superior experience, even in my opinion with\n7:41 Comment: different characteristics. But the fact that Gian Paolo gave him the responsibility of a\n7:46 Comment: such an important role on his board shows that he is a boy with great prospects.\n7:53 Comment: Antonelli, pass by Luis Adriano, good ball for Asuso, who can attack centrally\n7:58 Comment: with the race. Asuso starts with the left. This is how Milan finds space. When\n8:4 Comment: Lempoli attempts this pressing and doesn't do it in an organized manner, here he was good at coming out.\n8:10 Comment: Asuso, who then opted for the shot towards goal, could also download on the right wing,\n8:16 Comment: where space had been created. He is in no hurry to go to Arianzo Skorupsky.\n8:23 Comment: Sinisa Mijalovic's understandably tense look.\n8:33 Comment: Yesterday Mijalovic appeared a bit annoyed in the press conference due to too many questions about him\n8:37 Comment: Balotelli, but it was also inevitable. In short, let our colleagues grease the attention\n8:42 Comment: yesterday on Balotelli's return to Milan. Diego Lopez, ball in Antonelli's zone.\n8:48 Comment: The oversized clothes cover. The ball recovered to De Jong on Sabonara.\n8:55 Comment: De Jong was criticized a lot for his performance in Florence. Not so much for a modest contribution in\n9:2 Comment: setup phase, but due to the excessive fragility that the Milan had in the coverage phase\n9:6 Comment: in front of the defense. Nice opening in the area of ​​Luisa Adriano and Antonelli. He catches the ball\n9:11 Comment: the Brazilian. Another opening on the right where Decilio is. But Maccarone in coverage.\n9:18 Comment: Decilio vertically, good ball for Bacca's shot. Luisa Adriano cuts the hatchet.\n9:22 Comment: The cross starts. Well placed Barba puts out. Then tails, pressed against Decilio.\n9:26 Comment: It touches Milan's tarsino last. Goal throw. It's a Milan in any case on the level of performance\n9:32 Comment: decidedly more aggressive pressure than in Florence. Milan tries to take advantage of the changes\n9:36 Comment: game. We saw him do two in this last action alone. It's a bit in the features\n9:41 Comment: of Mikhailovic's game. The Milan coach likes to move the offensive action from one\n9:45 Comment: band to the other quickly. Especially suitable against a team like Empoli who\n9:49 Comment: defends very tight with the four defenders. Therefore it creates space on the outside.\n9:53 Comment: Very calmly, even too calmly, at the Ariancio Sturups that the San Siro crowd caught him.\n9:58 Comment: Bertolacci's control is good. Romagnoli. He widens for Antonelli.\n10:10 Comment: Foul by Zambelli and damage by Nocerino. Free kick for Milan.\n10:15 Comment: Nocerino. He widens for Antonelli. Cross position. Antonelli puts it in the middle. Ball\n10:24 Comment: tiso at the far post where Bacca chases the ball. Pallo leaves to spit for Bertolacci.\n10:29 Comment: Berry. Pay attention to the moment Desilio enters. Desilio strikes. It's getting larger.\n10:33 Comment: It's closed now. Berry again. Try percussion. He asks for 1-2. Suso's ball\n10:40 Comment: back. Ball that doesn't pass. Good idea. Suso berry. The triangle has not closed. They have\n10:45 Comment: held the Empoli defenders well. I understood Totonelli who went right on\n10:49 Comment: trajectory of Suso's pass. Another cross. Beard cover. Then Mario Rui. Flash of the\n10:58 Comment: Portuguese. Player with certainly interesting technical means for a fullback. It is also addressed\n11:4 Comment: regularly. There is a free kick for Empoli. A very quick player who often\n11:8 Comment: With these accelerations he manages to create interesting situations even in phase\n11:13 Comment: offensive. Here we review the 1-2. Asked by Bacca. Awarded by Suso again with the outside of the foot\n11:19 Comment: left. He doesn't trust playing with his right foot very much. He prefers his best foot.\n11:24 Comment: Foul by Desilio. Portogampo with Stefano's beak. He wants total aggression from the team\n11:33 Comment: Milan at Empoli already on the attacking midfielder. He starts to meow, especially asking Suso to\n11:38 Comment: fit well between the lines. He almost wants three attackers, not an attacking midfielder and two points.\n11:44 Comment: Zambelli the initiative. It's not in the studio. With the inside, with the outside he puts it in the area of\n11:50 Comment: rigor. It was a good idea and the ball was recovered by Deulo Lopez. Menanguato was there\n11:54 Comment: Pucciarelli. Romagnoli was good at cutting off Pucciarelli's movement. Taking\n12:0 Comment: position before the opponent. Diego Lopez combines with Romagnoli. This is very risky\n12:7 Comment: ride. Antonelli. He cuts Zielinski off and steals the ball. Then Zambelli\n12:16 Comment: pressed on Antonelli. He does well playing the drop ball. Diusseh. Suso goes away.\n12:21 Comment: Pressed Cross. Diusseh. Pucciarelli. Zielinski. Diusseh. The Empoli player is doing well\n12:29 Comment: in narrow spaces. Zambelli. In a flash by Pucciarelli. Maccarone must exit the offer game. Goes on\n12:35 Comment: the Sabonara action. Empoli's number 5. Attack Sabonara. Maccarone is there on the left though.\n12:39 Comment: The ball for him. Croce is in the area. Maccarone. Return to the right. And it attracts them. Deviated. Ball in\n12:42 Comment: corner. This is a team that is used to playing even under pressure. Not\n12:46 Comment: they are afraid of keeping the ball in tight spaces and misfiring Milan's pressing if\n12:51 Comment: it is not carried in an organized manner. Here they got close to their opponents but always left\n12:55 Comment: space to make the play. Empoli came out very well, also taking advantage of Croce's cut\n13:1 Comment: allow Maccarone to receive the ball within 16 metres. The flag Piotr Zielinski,\n13:7 Comment: 21 year old Polish midfielder, arrived in Italy at a very young age from Udinese and on loan\n13:11 Comment: at Empoli. He already has 9 caps for the Polish national team. Sabonara is at the near post. Pucciarelli\n13:18 Comment: and Maccarone in the heart of the penalty area start from within. Barba and Tonelli. Attention above all\n13:21 Comment: in Tonelli. Traversion part. He tries to look for Tonelli who however is blocked by an opponent\n13:25 Comment: and fails to derive on the transversion. Moreover, she has a long streak. Who cares\n13:30 Comment: Zielinski for corner kicks? What Fiori did last year was not with the same precision\n13:35 Comment: until now. The block was very hard by Zapata. The rebirth of Di Golopez. Here it is in the\n13:47 Comment: grandstand. The most awaited man tonight, Mario Balotelli. Mario Rui. A favorable dear moment\n13:54 Comment: at Empoli. Mario Rui goes to the launch, looks for Pucciarelli. He completely wakes up the measure\n13:57 Comment: of the passage. Antonelli. Nocerino expands. Montanelli goes deep to look for the shot\n14:3 Comment: Berry. Zambelli closed well. Antonelli again. Pressured by Pucciarelli. The throw-in is\n14:9 Comment: red and black. We passed the 14th minute at the instructions of Marco and Gianpaolo I of him.\n14:12 Comment: I was a midfielder at Serie C level. As a footballer at football level. Surely\n14:18 Comment: his brother Federico was more talented. In particular in the time of Pescara he did\n14:23 Comment: big things. At a certain point he also entered the sights of important English clubs.\n14:27 Comment: Antonelli. Giussè. Antonelli. Double exchange with Giussè. Pucciarelli is free. Ball vertically\n14:36 Comment: for him. Pucciarelli. He tries to cut, to pass Romagnoli who was asking for a handball.\n14:41 Comment: Nocerino's pressure. Zianischi keeps the ball on the pitch very well. Then Giussè. Fake\n14:51 Comment: he passes it to the goalkeeper and then gets rid of Suso with a feint. However, the ball was recovered by\n14:55 Comment: Romagnoli who plays it well for Bacca. Lissadriano proposes to take the lead. It arrived that also arrives\n14:59 Comment: Suso. Bacca doesn't support it. You have to do everything yourself. She ball to the limit for Suso. She proposes again\n15:4 Comment: Bacca but the Spaniard ignores him. DeJong. The public doesn't like it. Salt Desiglio. To support\n15:10 Comment: Bertolacci is there. Now, however, he has regrouped behind Lempoli. Bertolacci. Great ball in\n15:15 Comment: vertical for Nocerino and Suso. Nocerino plays it. The arrival in the middle. Ball deflected at the end.\n15:19 Comment: Remove Zianischi. Great idea by Bertolacci. Cut off Zapata. Ball controlled by Croce.\n15:25 Comment: Empoli counterattack. The match is getting livelier. Macchiarone widened to the left.\n15:30 Comment: Pucciarelli is central. Saponara. Croce remained wide to the left. Saponara. Giussi. Mario\n15:42 Comment: Rui arriving in support. He coordinates for the cross. Ball passes to look for Macchiarone.\n15:45 Comment: Desiglio removed. Nice control from Lissadiano. Be careful, Bacca took the shot. Great ball\n15:50 Comment: from him. Berry in open field. Berry. She tacked on. In front of the goalkeeper. Berry. Storuschi's exit.\n15:54 Comment: Berry. Berry. Milan has the flask. Perfect counterattack by Milan.\n16:3 Comment: Who Bacca? Or sanctioned by the fans but all the teammates went to\n16:8 Comment: hug Lissadriano who truly made a perfect play. Going towards the ball.\n16:13 Comment: Stop. Oriented. Oriented control. He ran out of time. The intervention attempt. A\n16:18 Comment: Empoli player. Then with a left. Perfect verticalization for Bacca who is at speed.\n16:22 Comment: He went towards the door. Maurizio seemed to have lost the ability to dribble past the goalkeeper\n16:31 Comment: after this first check. See from behind and behind you. Then it's actually very fast. He throws himself\n16:37 Comment: in a slide to avoid the risk of being tackled by the goalkeeper's hand.\n16:42 Comment: Here it's all Luca because there's obviously the technique, control of the ball wasn't easy\n16:47 Comment: the speed but I would also say the physical strength because they tried to throw him down and he almost didn't\n16:51 Comment: it is moved. He is very good in these situations. Take advantage of the speed of his own desire\n16:59 Comment: get to the point of scoring a goal. He averaged almost a goal every two games at Sevilla\n17:7 Comment: 49 goals in 108 games. At Milan he started with the same goal average already on the second matchday\n17:14 Comment: of championship. Empoli's reaction. Zelischi asks for the 1-2, Romagnoli's clean advance.\n17:22 Comment: Then Nocerino had gone to Romagnoli's sole position and Nocerino ignores him for the office of\n17:27 Comment: starting from Antonelli. Here he is Romagnoli. Nocerino. He has the edge of his head Peppe Di Stefano. Exultation\n17:37 Comment: with lots of smiles also for Mario Balotelli. Angry celebration for Silvina Sammiarovi.\n17:41 Comment: How curious a minute and a half earlier he had told the pair of forwards you were too wide\n17:45 Comment: you have to stay tighter. And it was precisely from a movement that actually brought the two together that the action was born\n17:51 Comment: Milan's first goal then came about. Antonelli heads to look for Bacca. Tournament twice\n17:58 Comment: by Tonelli. Let's say that Empoli's defense was surprised in an unusual way\n18:4 Comment: here's to this team. Cross. Giussi. Zielinski. Attached to Nocerino. Zielinski\n18:15 Comment: from distance. Try it and leave it. It's not that great. More difficult to score from that position\n18:20 Comment: it almost seemed like a conclusion to get rid of the ball without too much conviction.\n18:26 Comment: Zelinski, who almost always came on with Sarri last year, wasn't a starter, but only came on in matches\n18:36 Comment: in progress in often but almost always a three-quarter position this year instead it does exactly that\n18:42 Comment: midfielder in all respects. He took the place that lasted the season she had occupied\n18:47 Comment: excellent Vecino performance. Yes. This time it is Diego Lopez who is in no hurry. Headed by Di Sciglio\n18:55 Comment: he makes a mistake giving the ball to Giussi. Immediately before. Good vertically for Maccarone. Great shot of\n18:59 Comment: time for the insertion of Sabonara. Torre Minario. Step and shoot at the net. Sabonara. Great goal. Empoli's equal.\n19:4 Comment: What a reaction from Empoli. This too was born from a ball that seemed to be in Milan's management.\n19:9 Comment: A wrong referral. Empoli exploited it perfectly quickly with this insertion\n19:14 Comment: from Sabonara who then passed the ball with his left foot, it seems to me between Lopez's legs.\n19:18 Comment: Great goal from Sabonara. He scored 7 in 17 games last season when he moved on\n19:26 Comment: at Empoli in January. Empoli bought him from Milan for 4 million. He had many\n19:30 Comment: requested in the summer by Naples in particular. Sarri would have gladly wanted him with him. This\n19:35 Comment: it was a great play by Maccarone. She continued with another great play from Sabonara. Great goal\n19:39 Comment: of Empoli. 1 against 1. The risk of playing 1 against 1. Two central defenders Romagnoli and Zapata\n19:44 Comment: against Maccarone and Puccerelli. The insertion of Sabonara which De Jong failed to absorb.\n19:49 Comment: Then the 1-2 was played perfectly. Great coup with the Maccarone indeed.\n19:54 Comment: The stability of parity lasted very little. Milan's lead was just 4 minutes.\n20:0 Comment: This exclusive Sky room. De Jong's delay in covering Sabonara who defends\n20:9 Comment: the ball was fine. Then left-footed Bartle and Diego Lopez. In this case, however, action born from\n20:17 Comment: a lost ball. It's true that Milan were practically deployed in an attacking action, but the players\n20:21 Comment: very tall out of position this 1 on 1 was created. The two central defenders against the two\n20:26 Comment: Empoli's attackers and from a wrong clearance this opportunity was born that Sabonara is\n20:31 Comment: he was really good at knowing how to exploit it.\n21:1 Comment: Suso empty ball, sets Zieliński. There is space on the left, the ball for Croce.\n21:5 Comment: Punta Decilio, only Cusciarelli is in the penalty area. Croce picks up speed, then touches it backwards.\n21:10 Comment: The ball could become good for Sabonara. Drive Decilius away. Mario Rui.\n21:17 Comment: Giussi. Croce leaves the Sabonara game. Maccarone that is proposed. He takes a good header off Zafata.\n21:26 Comment: Mario Rui. Silence broke at San Siro after the Empoli draw. But Mila comes back. Bertolacci.\n21:33 Comment: Good idea for Pucciarelli. Attention, Maccarone turns around. Maccarone almost in the shooting range. Ball for Pucciarelli.\n21:39 Comment: The shot goes off. Ball out. Great Empoli. Bertolacci's idea was terrible Maurizio. In that area of ​​the field\n21:44 Comment: a pass from underground, you risk being intercepted and having a shot on goal like at the moment\n21:50 Comment: as happened in Pucciarelli's conclusion. Here we review the goal action. The conclusion of\n21:57 Comment: Sabonara, strong, straight. Diego Lopez was unable to go to ground but Pucciarelli also had a great chance.\n22:6 Comment: Relaunch of Diego Lopez. Tonelli heads. We are in the 23rd minute of the first half at San Siro.\n22:14 Comment: 1-1 between Milan and Empoli. With hands to Antonelli.\n22:26 Comment: Suso control. Antonelli enters. Ball deflected by Zielinski. The red-black remittance.\n22:32 Comment: Antonelli himself is ready with his hands. DeJong. Romagnoli.\n22:45 Comment: Pressured by Sabonara, he freed the ball and gave it to Desciglio. He doesn't even find outlets for Desciglio.\n22:52 Comment: In the end the ball almost inevitably returns to Diego Lopez. The first whistles begin to arrive from the stands.\n22:57 Comment: DeJong. I believe that Milan must have patience because in any case it is not easy to face a well-organised team, well placed on the pitch like Empoli.\n23:7 Comment: Bertolacci combines with Bacca. Wide on the right awaits Desciglio to close Mario Rui.\n23:12 Comment: Desciglio points it. Valcroos fouled Mario Rui. Paying is hard. Luiz Adriano. Great break from Luiz Adriano.\n23:17 Comment: When pressed it really fails to provide the necessary power. But here he shows that he knows how to do it and former striker Rusak Tardonez is his top ball.\n23:26 Comment: I was saying, a well-organised team, well-disposed on the pitch but which occasionally commits some negligence. We saw it in this first part of the match.\n23:36 Comment: Skorupski. Romagnoli breaks away. It's Giussi's turn to favor Mario Rui's advance. Vertical ball for Sabonara's shot.\n23:48 Comment: And here Desciglio's intervention was determined. If that ball had passed, Sabonara would have had a highway towards Diego Lopez.\n23:56 Comment: Cross. Try to go via Desciglio. There is no foul by Milan's Tarzino who finishes well and earns the throw-in with his hands.\n24:5 Comment: The precedent at San Siro between the two teams is 10. 7 victories for Milan, 1 draw. 2 victories for Empoli. Curiously, Empoli have beaten Milan in a total of 20 matches at San Siro alone.\n24:49 Comment: Spain-Desciglio. Paccaroni lurking. In the end Zapata solves it.\n24:54 Comment: Great confusion, in my opinion, in the management of the ball by Milan who want to start from their own half of the pitch, I repeat, keeping the two full-backs very high and playing with Romagnoli, Zapata and De Jong.\n25:6 Comment: Empoli's pressing doesn't allow them to do so. Above all, Giampaolo's men position themselves well on passing trajectories. Milan loses certainties.\n25:18 Comment: The third range is the exclusive and Bacca's goal. Impressive, I repeat, especially Bacca's ability to stay balanced despite the pressure of his opponents who tried to move him, even knock him down.\n25:29 Comment: Attack Milan. Bertolacci. DeJong. Puccarelli attacks him. Bertolacci again. Abre to the right, no one leaves. The ball is lost at the bottom.\n25:39 Comment: Bertolacci was also too static in this first half. He still has to adapt to this position, a little different than the one he occupied in Genoa.\n25:55 Comment: Bertolacci and Desiglio, which news reaches our Alessandro Lalciato, have been called up by Conte for the national team.\n26:4 Comment: Romagnoli. Nocerino is looking for Luiz Adriano. Ball that doesn't pass. Nocerino must be decisive on the ball. A little too decisive, but according to Giacomelli, Tonelli. Fuck position for Milan and warned Tonelli.\n26:20 Comment: The surgery was very hard. He looked for the ball, in my opinion he didn't want to catch the opponent, but Tonelli actually got there with great impetus.\n26:34 Comment: Here is the intervention of the defender, he too, like Saunara, was the center of many negotiations, of many requests after the great year of last season.\n26:45 Comment: At least on the twists and turns, tomorrow, the last day of the transfer window, Tonelli will stay at Empoli.\n26:51 Comment: Suso, we run in Spanish, tense and big, Maccarone puts out, Puccerelli, tries to get rid of Nocerino, and attacks him.\n26:58 Comment: Recovering the ball Nocerino, as he does so much, opens it up to damage Puccerelli. Fuck free kick, Nocerino gets a little angry.\n27:3 Comment: A movement by Suso to widen, to try to create numerical superiority on the outside, in this case on the left wing, should do it more.\n27:12 Comment: The central attacking midfield position receives few playable balls, especially in limited space, and it doesn't even seem particularly suited to speeding up the pass for the attackers.\n27:23 Comment: Better if you look for space on the side bands.\n27:29 Comment: Zelinski, on for Sabonara, looks for Maccarone, a release from Maccarone, out of play. Diego Lopez had taken it.\n27:38 Comment: The separation had been anticipated too much, in addition to the defensive line, very little, it seemed to me more, I have to tell the truth, very little.\n27:48 Comment: The ball was touched by Zapata, but it was a touch, not a played ball, so it is not enough to put the Empoli striker back into play.\n27:56 Comment: Antonelli, Romagnoli, header, closes Antonelli, Luiz Adriano, widens De Sciglio, Romagnoli well.\n28:12 Comment: The moment of the match in which Milan seems to have very few ideas.\n28:19 Comment: De Sciglio, breaks through, recovers the ball Giussè, cross, looks for Sabonara, pressured by De Jong, recovers De Sciglio, Sun Tso, attacks him with a cross.\n28:37 Comment: However, Milan gains the meters, raises the Jewish center, De Jong misses the control, puts Romagnoli behind him, De Jong again.\n28:47 Comment: Insistent action by Milan, Suso, good touch, initiative by De Sciglio, to the cross, ball for berry, breaks it, Bertolacci, on the left, looks for the verticalization.\n28:56 Comment: Antonelli's offensive imitation is not over, now Milan attacks with good danger, Nocerino, goes to the cross, ball to the far post, Skorupski in two halves.\n29:4 Comment: This cross from Nocerino was a little too deep, but Milan's action was good, Suso again moving to the flank, in this case the right wing,\n29:10 Comment: it creates numerical superiority and gives Bertolacci the opportunity to develop the game, then the discharge for Nocerino from this other side was not precise.\n29:20 Comment: Barba, Zambelli, Tonelli, Lempoli ball possession, now there is the initiative on the left by Mario Rui, vertical for Saponara, attacked by De Jong,\n29:43 Comment: Romagnoli arrives to close, for Maccarone's shot, Lempoli again, ball that splashes, touched by Saponara towards Pucciarelli,\n29:48 Comment: Romagnoli backwards for Diego Lopez.\n29:52 Comment: Beard head.\n30:5 Comment: The mananta, really involuntary, but it happened on Barba's part.\n30:8 Comment: Zapata, widens Antonelli's advantage.\n30:13 Comment: He looks for Adriano's shot, Tonelli takes the lead, then Zambelli, under pressure from Nocerino, gets away with Lempoli's tarsina.\n30:20 Comment: Nice advance from Romagnoli, but Pucciarelli cleverly recovers the ball, Antonelli's touch, Pucciarelli overwhelms Antonelli, he does it, chases him away with a free kick for Mimmo.\n30:29 Comment: Water, water, water, water.\n30:33 Comment: Water, water, water.\n30:41 Comment: Bertolacci, stopped. Well done Saponara in interdiction, Maccarone left, accompanies Croce, on the left center there is Pucciarelli,\n30:48 Comment: Maccarone insists, reaches the limit, the opening for Croce, when he will now be stopped.\n30:52 Comment: Maccarone should therefore go first, after a good initiative.\n30:55 Comment: Maccarone was too bent on getting going, it's clear that carrying the ball wasn't wrong at all,\n31:1 Comment: However, Zapata should be forced to make a choice, go for him and widen on Croce.\n31:6 Comment: But he was too slow, he let Bertolacci catch up.\n31:13 Comment: Antonelli, Luiz Adriano's opening, in space for de Sciglio, arrives in support, he must immediately go to shorten Mario Rui.\n31:23 Comment: Bertolacci, ball at the limit for Luiz Adriano who was anticipated.\n31:28 Comment: Giussi, Saponara, Saponara is playing a great first half.\n31:34 Comment: Cross, Maccarone attacks Zapata, Maccarone goes down, foul by Zapata.\n31:41 Comment: Epole is playing well because it never gives up on restarting, above all it never throws the ball away,\n31:49 Comment: he always tries to manage it and this is creating problems for Milan's midfield which doesn't always arrive at the right time to shorten it.\n31:56 Comment: Mario Rui, Giussi, frees Saponara who, however, was moving backwards so as not to end up in foul play,\n32:4 Comment: an unfortunate ball arrives in the arms of Diego Lopez.\n32:8 Comment: Antonelli, Romagnoli, Bertolacci look for the lepello and the ball doesn't pass.\n32:19 Comment: Romagnoli, Zapata, always disturbing Maccarone and Puccerelli who are Empoli's main defenders.\n32:28 Comment: Desciglio, slightly complicated dribble, closes beard, the touch of Mario Rui, Giussi, Mario Rui, Giussi, Saponara, Mario Rui.\n32:39 Comment: Croce, Mario Rui, Saponara everything from before, Giussi, Empoli stretching out a bit, the opening on the right for Zambelli,\n32:48 Comment: Giussi's throw isn't perfect but Zambelli gets there.\n32:52 Comment: Then Zambelli takes center stage, great run by the former Brescia defender, but he lacks clarity but it is an approach that has great run and berry\n33:0 Comment: who can go into the open field if he manages to overcome Antonelli, is doubled by Zelinski, changes berry,\n33:6 Comment: he also suffered a beating from Zelinski, Zelinski who could risk being punished,\n33:12 Comment: Desciglio, Suso, can kick from there, but immediately shortens to close Giustiello, surpasses Suso, conclusion outside.\n33:21 Comment: Only verbal warning for Zelinski.\n33:25 Comment: Maybe there was a warning because he arrived very late on Bacca, so let's see Suso's initiative,\n33:31 Comment: then in the end he managed to beat the man and kick on goal but it should have been the first idea, instead it was the first idea of ​​the young Spaniard\n33:37 Comment: it was to wait for someone to support us, that's where Milan is missing, a bit of courage, a bit of personal initiative.\n33:45 Comment: Zambelli's throw was a good measure, we go to the sidelines to Peppe Di Stefano.\n33:48 Comment: Miajlovic really doesn't like this Milan who often compares himself with Emilio Deleu who is one of his team's tacticians, meanwhile you.\n33:58 Comment: Antonelli, the cross is deflected, Skorupski, let's see if he keeps it, yes, the corner isn't taken, then the referee's assistant, De Pinto, says it's a corner, shut down Peppe.\n34:9 Comment: He is one of the tacticians Emilio Deleu of his staff, he consults every 10 minutes more or less, the problem is that lately he is in this tactician's station every 2-3 minutes\n34:20 Comment: because they don't like this Milan, we need to find a solution, especially in midfield, Bertolacci doesn't seem to be very convincing at the moment.\n34:28 Comment: It's true, it's true, little quality, Bertolacci isn't playing well, but no one supports him even in the construction work, he's the only one trying to make some complicated plays, by the way the ball didn't come out Maurizio.\n34:40 Comment: No, it hadn't come out entirely, it wasn't a key to be made by Perte and De Pinto, it was on the other side, the images said that the ball hadn't come out completely.\n34:48 Comment: Once the corner is taken there is a deflection, Bertolacci, on Youssef De Jong's attack, back for De Cilio who is Milan's deepest player.\n34:58 Comment: De Cilio loaned out wide for Zapata who can't get there.\n35:2 Comment: 10 minutes until the end of the first half, many many perplexed in the San Siro stands, Maccarone vertically looking for Pucciarelli, an uncatchable ball for the number 20.\n35:13 Comment: Milan's difficulties are what we said, difficulty in building, but you see Nocerino doesn't have his best characteristics in building the game, De Jong doesn't have that, now he receives the ball but goes back there.\n35:27 Comment: Because in any case the technical baggage of giving playing times to the team and of looking for the ball in difficult passes is not in the technical baggage.\n35:38 Comment: Suso has little impact for the moment, technical tests by Tridente and Peppe Di Stefano.\n35:43 Comment: It's exactly like this because in the 34th after 34 minutes of little Milan, Mijalovic looked at Balotelli and Mario starts warming up and then his second career at Milan will probably begin shortly, four minutes into the second half.\n35:59 Comment: Having said Tridente's technical tests, because in short it is difficult for me to believe that one of Luiz Adriano or Bacca could come out, could Mijalovic play with Tridente instead of Suso?\n36:8 Comment: Yes, one of the two could slip away, no not one of the two attackers, Bacca on the centre-left, perhaps Balotelli on the centre-right, I don't think Balotelli in the position that Suso is occupying because that is also a tactical role in Mijalovic's idea , it's not just offensive.\n36:38 Comment: They also keep close on Saponara, Mario Rui, Giuse, not Luqui Launch in the hope of finding an attacker, he was very far away Pucciarelli, Romagnoli, Di Testa Antonelli, looks for Nocerino, passed by the ball, Zambelli stops him, Zielinski, Giuse, between the lines cross , immediately pressed, Bertolacci closes well, Nocerino, vertically for Luiz Adriano,\n37:8 Comment: Saponara attacks Lempoli, Maccaroni wide, Mario Rui's position arrives, Maccaroni inside to have Pucciarelli, edge, Saponara, good action by Lempoli, Diego Lopez's save.\n37:21 Comment: Lempoli does the simple things but does them well, with the right speed and with the right timing, what Milan is not managing, the combinations of the three in front are almost always effective, Saponara very good, you have already underlined it Maurizio, but he's having a very high level first half.\n37:35 Comment: He said he had no feeling of revolt against Milan, he said it was an experience despite playing little that made him grow, actually the Saponara who returned to generate at Empoli, already the first Saponara of Lempoli was an excellent player, but the one who returned to Empoli is definitely stronger.\n37:51 Comment: De Sciglio, or rather Bertolacci, Zapata, Antonelli, Zelinski pushes him.\n38:22 Comment: The opponent made the previous contact with Barba who used his elbow a little but more to free himself from the opponent than to hurt, to keep the opponent at a distance.\n38:36 Comment: There is Suso on the ball, we are 38 meters away obviously an important conclusion is unthinkable here, putting Suso in the middle or he could widen for Bertolacci who is positioned on the left completely alone.\n38:47 Comment: A bit of disposition, Suso starts, Maccarone takes it, lets De Jong slide, as always in these situations Milan's most backward player and De Sciglio.\n39:1 Comment: Suso again, he doesn't know the Spaniard from Cadiz, controls Antonelli badly, Bertolacci takes over Zambelli, Bertolacci reaches for the ball, stops him a little too much with a cross, then Zambelli.\n39:13 Comment: Soap it up.\n39:21 Comment: Zambelli, high pressing by Milan, Zambelli caged, Antonelli doesn't give him space, attacks him, goes down, Antonelli recovers the ball, then foul contact, positional kick for Milan.\n39:31 Comment: Good work under pressure from Antonelli who was then finding an interesting art to project himself inside the penalty area.\n39:38 Comment: Then Ciano Zambelli who lost the ball in a banal way, probably betting on the referee's whistle, let himself fall on the ball.\n39:50 Comment: 40th of the first half, 5 minutes more or less from injury time at the end of the first part of the match in which Milan struggled a lot after a good start.\n40:8 Comment: Clearly Romagnoli and Zapata also arrived inside the penalty area.\n40:14 Comment: Antonelli is positioned at the near post.\n40:17 Comment: Three out of four AC Milan defenders are in Empoli's penalty area.\n40:25 Comment: Suso starts, the ball is put out, the first to arrive is De Jong, he can repeat the cross, but he hits it badly but De Jong gives the ball to Giussè, the Empoli courier takes off.\n40:34 Comment: De Jong goes to interdiction, then Saponara, attacked by Bertolacci, Giussè, tails, near the end of Antonelli's goal.\n40:45 Comment: Bertolacci arrives on the loose ball, but in front there is only the berry.\n40:48 Comment: Defeated by Bertolacci, Giussè attacks him foully, there is a free kick for Milan.\n40:55 Comment: In this case Bertolacci didn't have the clarity, in the meantime there is ammunition for Maccarone for protests.\n41:4 Comment: Second player with ammunition in Empoli, Macchiarone after Tonelli.\n41:9 Comment: Again Bertolacci as the first choice, you see, to return towards his goal on the pitch to wait for support from his teammates, then he saw the opportunity to attack and got this free kick.\n41:25 Comment: 41 and a half minutes, free kick for Milan.\n41:28 Comment: Usual group of jumpers on the edge of the Empoli penalty area.\n41:34 Comment: DeJong.\n41:42 Comment: Ignored De Sciglio who was completely free.\n41:46 Comment: Nocerino.\n41:48 Comment: All Empoli in their own threequarters, Nocerino soft inside the penalty area, too easy for Barba.\n41:56 Comment: There is Folle De Jong, free kick for Empoli.\n41:59 Comment: Giacomelli was not attentive enough and could have let it go.\n42:4 Comment: There was a chance to start again for Giampaolo's team.\n42:9 Comment: There is a foul, but you see, Mario Rui plays vertically and there was the possibility of making a counterattack.\n42:16 Comment: Giampaolo is encouraged, this is a great opportunity for the Giulianova coach, born in Switzerland, but from Giulianova in Abruzzo.\n42:22 Comment: He hasn't lived the last few seasons with particular brilliance.\n42:27 Comment: Cesena, Brescia, Cremonese, yet a few years ago they were the most popular coaches, so it's not an open secret.\n42:34 Comment: Before Ferrara he now seemed to be the Juventus coach.\n42:37 Comment: Watch out for Maccarone, in the penalty area, in front of Zapata, Maccarone tries to free the right laio, inside for Puccinelli, Puccinelli, Puccinelli!\n42:43 Comment: On Romagnoli's attack, ball out.\n42:45 Comment: Empoli still dangerous.\n42:47 Comment: Empoli are dangerous, they completely deserve the equal result, in fact, perhaps they are doing better.\n42:52 Comment: In the second part of the first half, compared to what Milan is able to put together.\n42:57 Comment: Mikhailovic's team was very tense, probably also a little worried about this reaction from Diego del Porchiere.\n43:5 Comment: Tonnelli closes on Isadriano, protects the defense ball well.\n43:9 Comment: Minutes to the 45th.\n43:11 Comment: 1-1.\n43:13 Comment: Empoli is playing with a great personality at San Siro.\n43:22 Comment: The Ariancio Skorupski.\n43:29 Comment: And he made it clear that once the experience in Tuscany was over, his goal was to return from Rome as a protagonist.\n43:38 Comment: Foul by Ascilio on Maccarone, free kick for Empoli.\n43:42 Comment: The two players butted heads, probably, or rather certainly involuntarily.\n43:47 Comment: Yes, absolutely.\n43:52 Comment: Head edge to Peppe Di Stefano.\n43:54 Comment: Look because yet another mistake in Bertolacci's midfield, he turned around, Mihajlovic looked at Cucca and Buonaventura, he said Cucca and Jack, you too should start warming up.\n44:4 Comment: And therefore it is probable that in the second half, the beginning of the second half, the adventure in the black beak for Cucca who arrived in Rome could also begin.\n44:14 Comment: We saw me in camera.\n44:17 Comment: Bertolacci is certainly not playing well, just as he didn't play well in Florence.\n44:21 Comment: But it seems a bit abandoned to itself, doesn't it? In this difficult situation.\n44:27 Comment: He has no clear references to rely on when he is not given the risk.\n44:33 Comment: It's a bit like it's not an activity, a bit like it's not an activity.\n44:37 Comment: Then we also add that a position on the pitch, a different use compared to that of Genoa.\n44:43 Comment: Pay attention to Sabonara, Di Jong closes the entire match perfectly even if Di Jong risked a lot.\n44:49 Comment: And here's a great ending.\n44:51 Comment: It's a bit like it's not an activity, a bit like it's not an activity.\n44:55 Comment: It's a bit like it's not an activity.\n\nSecond Half:\n0:0 Comment: time with Puccarelli's wake ended just outside.\n0:6 Comment: First ball played vertically by Kuzka for Bacca who has to delay the shot\n0:9 Comment: started but was still offside at the time he took part in the action. Yes\n0:14 Comment: raise the flag to assistant referee Di Fiore, free kick\n0:16 Comment: for Lempoli. There is little to add, he had anticipated the gap in depth\n0:21 Comment: defensive of Lempoli who was good at waiting to leave the moment of\n0:27 Comment: Kuzka's passage.\n0:35 Comment: The mini boo you heard for Mario Balotelli has risen again for\n0:41 Comment: start the warm-up phase again. Luis Adriano, Bento Lasci, Luis Adriano.\n0:47 Comment: It's up to portrait Isuzu, De Jong, Kuzka. Novamente the superposition of\n0:53 Comment:  Antonelli, two of them know each other well and have been Genua teammates for a long time.\n0:57 Comment: De Jong, Desciglio, Zapata,\n1:7 Comment:  Antonelli, Kuzka. Ball at the limit, ends cross.\n1:14 Comment:  Zieliski lets Tonnelli pass the ball to Skorupski. He cuts Romagnoli well.\n1:23 Comment: Luis Adriano anticipated, Antonelli headed. Luis Adriano gets there, then Romagnoli but\n1:28 Comment: How do I know how to foul Luis Adriano? Here he is, Mario Balotelli.\n1:37 Comment: Foul by Luis Adriano who hit the cross. Even at the limits of\n1:42 Comment: Yellow card in my opinion because it hits him with the elbow. In fact, look, he got it\n1:45 Comment:  clearly showed cross. It wasn't a real elbow though\n1:48 Comment: In any case, an operation with the elbow at face height.\n1:54 Comment: Zambelli.\n1:57 Comment: No need to look for Puccerelli for Romagnoli's clean advance. Leave\n2:0 Comment: Giussè remove. Ball for Antonelli. Maccarone. Bank for Croce. Shooting area.\n2:6 Comment: Tails, tails, the shot starts. Diego Lopez punches us. It's not over. Zieliski. Turn for\n2:12 Comment: Giussè.\n2:16 Comment: Sabonara. Sets Antonelli. Cross. Between two opponents looks for the number, stops it\n2:23 Comment:  Bertolacci very well. And there was a foul.\n2:27 Comment:  Lucresca a moment late to Giacomelli. Free kick for Empoli.\n2:31 Comment:  Bertolacci definitely took the ball away.\n2:34 Comment: Let's see again. No.\n2:39 Comment: Giacomelli is not always convincing in his speeches this evening. Convincing\n2:45 Comment:  in this Diego Lopez. The very violent central cross conclusion. Again\n2:49 Comment: freed by Maccarone who is very good at receiving the ball at his feet and then making it\n2:53 Comment: bank for the teammates who enter. Zambelli. Sabonara. Zieliski has widened\n2:59 Comment:  and now it goes in. Ball for the Pole. Attacked inside the penalty area.\n3:2 Comment: It goes down. Giacomelli sees the initial foul. Free kick for Empoli.\n3:10 Comment: These are held together.\n3:18 Comment: Cusca was the perpetrator of the foul.\n3:23 Comment: 3.25 from the start of the second half. 1 to 1 at San Siro.\n3:32 Comment:  Empoli brings four players inside Milan's penalty area.\n3:36 Comment: Zielinski with the right. Mario Rui can also with the left... Strangely, Tonelli isn't there\n3:41 Comment: which however is arriving now. In fact he said something about the punishment of waiting.\n3:45 Comment: Tonelli is also arriving and he is certainly the most dangerous player in these\n3:48 Comment:  situations of Giampaolo's team. Zapata takes it.\n3:52 Comment:  Mario Rui attempted a shot on goal. Another cross. Good advance from Desiglio.\n4:5 Comment: Go get the cross ball. Diussé.\n4:12 Comment: Maccarone expands. Pidinated by Zapata.\n4:20 Comment:  Maccarone's defense of the ball. There are now two opponents. But Bertolacci stops him.\n4:24 Comment: Maccarone tries to recover by committing a foul. Free kick for Milan.\n4:28 Comment: Bertolacci scored many assists in the Genoa shirt last season.\n4:33 Comment: He found a slightly different position than the one he is occupying at Milan.\n4:37 Comment:  Especially in a different game system. Romagnoli. Vertical for Bacca.\n4:43 Comment: Tonelli takes a position and closes. But the ball becomes good for Luiz Adriano.\n4:46 Comment:  Suso. Kuzka. Suso again. De Jong. Empoli ends well. Desiglio.\n4:56 Comment: On Mario Rui's attack. Desiglio rushes the pass. He loses the ball.\n5:2 Comment: Cross. Good on Bertolacci. Also favored by a rebound.\n5:6 Comment:  Yussi. Saponara. Zeliski. Good work from Polacco. She widens well for Zambelli.\n5:12 Comment: Kuzka goes to get it. Zambelli points it. The invasion is a penalty. The cross.\n5:15 Comment: Headed involuntarily by Kuzka. Then Suso. Square split in two. Luiz Adriano.\n5:20 Comment:  Suso. Bacca went forward and tried offside. Kuzka. Suso wide to the left.\n5:30 Comment: Sale Antonelli. Kuzka. Suso. He was looking for Bacca. He's very bad for the ball.\n5:37 Comment: And Empoli loses. Maccarone. He kills Mario Rui on the left. He crosses Pucciarelli.\n5:45 Comment: Mario Rui is no use in a moment. Then he tries and limits Maccarone. Maccarone. Try the shot.\n5:48 Comment:  Rejected by Antonelli. But it's not over. Saponara. Also try Saponara around.\n5:52 Comment: And the ball rises too much. It probably also bounced a little badly in front of him.\n5:55 Comment: It even ends up in a curve. That was certainly the reason why Saponara\n5:59 Comment: He wasn't able to make a better impact on the ball. But Empoli's opportunities are good.\n6:4 Comment: that circulates the ball with reasonable freedom. Milan is trying. You spoke Norizio\n6:9 Comment: before Bertolacci. The Milan shirt weighs heavily. It's not even that easy to become a player\n6:16 Comment:  of Milan and being at 100% straight away. This boy also deserves to be given some difficulties.\n6:23 Comment: They were used to seeing him play in a different way. But he needs to be given time.\n6:30 Comment:  Peppe Di Stefano on the sidelines. Giampaolo is satisfied. It couldn't be otherwise.\n6:37 Comment: He's asking for something even more from Saponara. He's still asking for additions. The team wants him\n6:41 Comment: the team in 30-35 meters maximum precisely to exploit the insertions. Practically\n6:46 Comment: Go one-on-one with shadows. Empoli have managed to do it so far.\n6:53 Comment: However, that of remaining short, compact, a very organized team. It is by culture,\n6:57 Comment: it is also the case for the work of Giampaolo who has always stood out for this\n7:2 Comment: His ability to make teams play together, departments together. Cross throw, header throw\n7:12 Comment:  cusca. Zambelli, Giussi. Zambelli. Zambelli, great player, takes the horizzanza\n7:22 Comment:  race. He fails to break through Antonelli's opposition but Empoli persists. Giussi.\n7:29 Comment: With strength and the ball could even become good for Maccarone, but ahead of Golopez.\n7:35 Comment:  De Sciglio. He widens for Antonelli. He finds Cusca on his vertical. Pacqua sprints. Lo\n7:46 Comment: look for Cusca. The ball arrives and the Colombian. Pacqua turns. Cusca also arrives and the ball\n7:51 Comment: For him it's Sadriano. He pushes Mario Rui away. Then Zelischi puts control but there's a misunderstanding\n7:58 Comment:  with Saponara. He insists on Milan. Antonelli. He puts it in the middle. There's a rebound. Cross at the limit,\n8:4 Comment: He puts it out. De Jonghe. Milan insists. Now the crowd turns on. Milan are\n8:9 Comment: Attacking with good intensity. Bertolacci. Circles thoroughly. Croce attacks him. The ball\n8:16 Comment:  slips out. Caccia corner says to the assistant and the referee. Horn number two for Milan.\n8:20 Comment: Empoli were downed four times. More strength, nerves than technique, but Milan are trying\n8:26 Comment:  to close Empoli in their half of the field. An error by Bacca beyond the goal. The Colombian\n8:31 Comment: He's covered. He didn't do much this evening.\n8:41 Comment: I don't have a minute. Corner for Milan. Suso beats him and he's about to leave. Zapata takes care of him.\n8:45 Comment:  Skorupski. Then Zelischi. Giussè closes. At a certain point we had developed the idea\n8:55 Comment: of the trident with the entry of Balotelli but entry of Bonaventura in place of Suso for\n9:0 Comment: the moment will keep Milan with the 4-3-1-2. However, it is very likely that Tazio Campi will be\n9:8 Comment: precisely what will allow Balotelli to make his second debut with the Milan shirt.\n9:12 Comment: You don't know, throwing in a player who has just arrived also depends a lot on the\n9:20 Comment: athletic condition in which the coach found him. It is true that Balotelli in\n9:25 Comment: Liverpool began preparing for some time but was a bit on the fringes of the team.\n9:30 Comment: Inside Bonaventura, outside Joaquin Fernandez, on the sides of the Suso tower. He didn't do well\n9:37 Comment:  the Spaniard from Cadiz who could return to the market after this performance. I decide. Luisa\n9:43 Comment: Adriano. He tries at speed but Barba has understood everything and stops him with a certain ease.\n9:48 Comment: Then Skorupski. When he gets worse on the back pass he hits badly. To close on Suso in my opinion\n9:55 Comment: Maurizio is not even his ideal position as an attacking midfielder. He had performed discrepantly\n10:1 Comment: With Inzaghi last season as an outside attacker on the right. He plays with one foot.\n10:7 Comment: That position can become a limitation to use only the left. Whistle for this throw to be made\n10:15 Comment: measure by Zapata who gave the opponents the throw-in. Montolivo too who was a little\n10:19 Comment: complained about Miano's poor use this season and is warming up\n10:23 Comment: with the balotelli. Saponara fails. He learns De Jong on the cross. However, he commits a foul in judgment\n10:33 Comment: By Giacomelli. Free kick for Empoli. Ten minutes and thirty-eight seconds to go\n10:38 Comment:  of the second half. This is De Jong's deed. One to one again. Draw at San Siro between Milan and \n10:42 Comment:  Empoli. Mario Rui advances. Maccarone is wide on the left. Cross.\n10:54 Comment: Mario Rui's attack was nice. Maccarone's feint was also nice. In for Apusciarelli.\n10:58 Comment: Romagnoli had the advantage as he also went up well with his right foot. But this was Empoli\n11:2 Comment: with what tranquility and with what quality he manages to get out of situations that seem intricate.\n11:8 Comment: Clearly there is a huge difference in self-confidence among the 22 players on the pitch\n11:15 Comment: those of Empoli and those of Milan. This time De Jong fouled her. She suffered it. Free kick.\n11:20 Comment: Perhaps Giacomelli could have applied the advantage to this gate too.\n11:32 Comment:  Kuzka. Vertical for Luiz Adriano. Excellent diagonal by Mario Rui who closes. Zambelli.\n11:38 Comment: So-so control from Zelinski. In the end Kuzka puts it into a lateral foul.\n11:50 Comment:  Tonelli advances. Luiz Adriano follows him and attacks him.\n11:59 Comment: In the end the ball shoots out. The last touch of the former international championship centre\n12:6 Comment: Porto Alegre. Above all Shakhtar Donetsk. Luiz Adriano arrived in Europe at a very young age\n12:13 Comment:  in 2007. Shakhtar is one of the most attentive clubs on the Brazilian market.\n12:23 Comment: There's this guy from Antonelli who goes to the torsa to look for a berry.\n12:31 Comment: Barba's intervention was a little off but still effective in the end as he kicked it into the corner.\n12:34 Comment: Third corner for Milan. Thirteenth of the second half. Romagnoli and Zabarda arrive to jump\n12:43 Comment:  inside the penalty area. Obviously there is also Antonelli and then the two attackers Luiz Adriano\n12:49 Comment:  and Barba. Once around the corner the ball goes towards Romagnoli who is anticipated. Biased\n12:57 Comment:  In Lempoli there is room for Mario Rui on the left. Indeed Zielinski who has changed position.\n13:3 Comment: Excellent central ball with no attempt at interdiction by Kuzka. Puccarelli is there\n13:8 Comment: Maccarone free on the other side. Puccarelli controls them. Even the pions don't enter on them\n13:12 Comment: of the young people. The ball is on top of them. Puccarelli missed a great opportunity here. If he had it\n13:17 Comment: controlled well he could develop the action on the other side where he was free again\n13:22 Comment: Maccarone. Decillo. Betolacci. Bacca. De Young. Bonaventura starts from the left. In the penalty area\n13:39 Comment: There is only Luiz Adriano. Bonaventura's ball doesn't pass and I try to fuel the action\n13:42 Comment: offensive. Zambelli on him. Cross from Bonaventura. Ball looking for Luiz Adriano.\n13:47 Comment: On the respite. The ball again for Adrianelli. He puts it in the middle. It was fine. He saves himself in\n13:51 Comment: I take a corner with my beard, Empoli's defence. Luiz Adriano di Bonaventura is enough\n13:55 Comment: He takes the ball. He moves it to the right. Be careful. The corner is taken but Maccarone\n13:59 Comment: actually Kuzka who recovered the ball committed a foul due to damage by Maccarone who was gone\n14:4 Comment: early. The conditional football has already been beaten. Watch out for Empoli who starts on the counter\n14:7 Comment:  with the cross. Romagnoli is late at the start. He is doubled crosses.\n14:11 Comment: The end loses the ball. Excellent work by Romagnoli but on the rebound. The players again\n14:15 Comment: Empoli recovering. Mario Rui. Barba. Zielinski advances. Zielinski for a few minutes\n14:28 Comment: he plays on the centre-left. He changed his position with a cross. He said. Zambelli. He makes a mistake\n14:37 Comment: very much Maccarone. Now to the right. Cross. Diusse. Raise your baricette at Empoli. Zielinski.\n14:46 Comment:  Mario Rui goes up on the left. Zielinski looks for a one-on-one. Then he widens for Mario Rui.\n14:51 Comment: The Portuguese starts centrally. He puts her in the middle. Control isn't great. Difficult\n14:56 Comment:  by Puccarelli. Desciglio. On his relaunch. Diusse. Tegale by Luiz Adriano. The throw-in\n15:2 Comment: for Empoli. Puccarelli runs a lot. He really moves a lot. He always gives an opportunity\n15:9 Comment: play to the teammate in possession of the ball. Sometimes he isn't perfect in his control but\n15:14 Comment: on the other hand he is absolutely not fresh when he gets possession of the ball. Reversal\n15:23 Comment: Croce and Zielinski's position had been temporary. They are back. Everyone has their own\n15:30 Comment: competence range. Opening of Zappata. Antonelli. Tegale of Sabonara. Intermente\n15:39 Comment: Foul free kick for Mima. If Milan wants to win this match they have\n15:45 Comment: need to raise the pace. Try hard too. Not necessarily with organization\n15:53 Comment: but he definitely needs to accelerate his second half. Kuzka. De Jong.\n16:0 Comment:  Zappata. Deciglio. Back for Zappata. Completely forward throw for Luiz Adriano.\n16:22 Comment: The other difficult moment of this complicated AC Milan match. Substitution. In Empoli\n16:26 Comment: Out with Maccarone who spent a lot, in his place Micelize. Player who never is\n16:30 Comment: He exploded, he stood out at a very young age. Remarkable potential, great physique and also\n16:35 Comment: Good feet. But he never managed to make the leap in quality. Yes, great physical strength.\n16:39 Comment: Sometimes a little confusing in his way of playing but great physical strength in this\n16:43 Comment: this moment of the match can certainly be useful because of Empoli who are defending\n16:49 Comment: good. Maybe it just lacks a bit of freshness in front to lean on more easily\n16:53 Comment: and come out more effectively when Milan attack. Great assist from Maccarone\n16:59 Comment: on the occasion of Saponara's draw. Two eggs because Maccarone played from 1993 to 1998\n17:3 Comment: with the Rossoneri youth teams. We start again with the throw-in for Empoli. He's ready\n17:9 Comment:  Mario Rui. We entered the eighteenth minute of the second half. Still tied San\n17:13 Comment:  Siro. One by one between Milan and Empoli. Mario Rui. Zilischi. Cuzca offers it. Saponara.\n17:30 Comment: Zambelli. Antonelli will go and get it. Saponara. The material for Puccinelli. Puccinelli! Yes\n17:40 Comment: The ball made it 2-1. This is truly a great opportunity because it could have\n17:44 Comment: wait to let her bounce one more time. She probably thought Diego was going out\n17:49 Comment: Lopez. He wanted to kick on an uncomfortable ball. He was too high. I repeat, he's tired\n17:54 Comment:  Puccinelli. You can also see it from how he arrived on this ball. Have a good adventure. He's off again\n18:2 Comment: Milan after risking going under. Merchele balls for Luis Adriano. The gap\n18:5 Comment:  of Brazil. Skorupski's exit. Luis Adriano. Watch out for the wheel door. Not\n18:10 Comment: He can kick. Good adventure. Milan still insists. He starts through a search\n18:13 Comment:  berry. Skorupski. What a risk Skorupski because it wasn't an optimal read.\n18:19 Comment: Luis Adriano risked anticipating him. There were two Empoli players who could\n18:24 Comment: close. It wasn't necessary for the goalkeeper to come out. Here on the other side is the exit\n18:29 Comment:  by Diego Lopez on Saponara. It's a pragmatic header to put the ball in a lateral affair.\n18:36 Comment: He takes the ball. Nothing to say about the intervention. Here is Puccinelli's perfect cut.\n18:41 Comment: Regular position. Milan's defensive line is surprising. Then there, perhaps Zapata was there\n18:46 Comment: He could have recovered. That's why Puccinelli accelerated the time of the conclusion.\n18:51 Comment: Barba. The school song Roma redeemed by Empoli in the summer even if Roma did\n19:0 Comment:  the right of counter-redemption is reserved. Zambelli. Exchanged with Puccinelli. Again\n19:10 Comment: Zambelli who goes to the crossbar to look for Michelizze. Ballone put out. De Jong. Salunga in creases\n19:15 Comment:  in Giussensi's ball. Empoli is on. Puccinelli in for Saponara. Saponara limit. In the area\n19:20 Comment: Puccinelli is here. He unloads on Croce. He attacks almost as soon as Empoli is staffed. Croce. He goes to\n19:24 Comment: shot. He extends the goal. Opez. The ball probably would have gone out. He takes it anyway\n19:27 Comment:  the Spaniard. Yes, Croce wasn't able to give strength to the conclusion but Empoli did very well.\n19:32 Comment: Many players in the ball area. Gianpaolo's team is much better positioned on the pitch\n19:40 Comment:  compared to Milan. Watch out for Bacca. Look for the gray. Bacca in the penalty area. The shot\n19:44 Comment: cross deflected. Ball on the outside of the net. Corner kick. The few applause this evening\n19:48 Comment: They could be given to all the San Siro players. Reserves, red and black players. They are\n19:50 Comment:  for Carlo Sbacca. He scored the goal and in my opinion Maurizio made little else but the impression\n19:57 Comment: It's the one you always try to go and build something, right? From the point of view\n20:2 Comment: Nothing can really be said about the will. Bonaventura's corner bypassed\n20:7 Comment:  Antonelli and the good ball for Cuzca. Another cross from Bonaventura. We passed the goal\n20:16 Comment:  Fifth. The result is not broken. Clearly the minutes are ticking away. The pressure is increasing for\n20:20 Comment: the red and black players. Balotelli continues to warm up. Bonaventura. N2 on him. Search\n20:32 Comment: the number. Great play by Bonaventura. Ball for Bertolacci. Now trapped\n20:36 Comment:  Bertolacci. Look for a flash from the back. They are good at closing down even the lucky players\n20:40 Comment: Lempoli to keep the ball on the pitch. Counterattack from Giampaolo's school. Advance\n20:46 Comment:  Saponara. Zambelli. Zelischi. Saponara. Mario Rui. Puccarelli. Croce. Mario Rui. Micelizze.\n21:4 Comment: Mario Rui. Watch out for Zelischi's cut. Direct the ball here. Followed the action well\n21:10 Comment:  Antonelli moving away. He loses the melee. Bacca and the ball recovered by Bonaventura.\n21:16 Comment: Cuzca widens on the left. Desciglio has started on the right. He brings the ball to Bonaventura. He must\n21:20 Comment: Luiz Adriano comes out of offside. Desciglio. Bonaventura. In fact, he entered the number well\n21:32 Comment: 28 for Milan. So two on top of each other. Look for the 1-2 with Desciglio. Ball that chooses the\n21:37 Comment: Forera. Rossanera is put back in the attack zone. Desciglio will take care of it. Bonaventura. He's there\n21:47 Comment: foul. Entirely regular on Croce's part. More at ease, right? It's true that every moment\n21:56 Comment: The match is a story in itself. But Bonaventura was more at ease than Suso in that one\n22:1 Comment:  position. At the very least it creates the opponent the alternative of dribbling him on the right or on the\n22:7 Comment: left-footed. In this case he got a free kick. Milan with five players\n22:15 Comment: to jump inside Eppoli's Drigoria area. Bonaventura on the ball. Vengeance\n22:19 Comment: two in the Skorupski barrier. He doesn't go to jump De Jong. He's a bit of a header in\n22:29 Comment: this occasion. All of Empoli inside the opera in Drigoria. Give it a try. Football\n22:39 Comment: Free kick for Milan. A little with the ball, especially Zapata and Romagnoli. Ball\n22:44 Comment: subject to the dirty but still effective intervention of Tonelli who became captain of Empoli.\n22:48 Comment: Another corner kick for Milan. There are six. Difficult here for Tonelli because not\n22:52 Comment: He knew who was behind him. In reality they were all his companions. He could have even left her\n22:57 Comment: flow but had to intervene by running towards the door. It wasn't easy. Always Bonaventura\n23:3 Comment:  from the flag. Always the usual five of Milan to jump. Bonaventura starts. Luisa\n23:8 Comment: Adriano. Luisa Adriano. Milan in action. Extraordinary header by Luisa Adriano\n23:16 Comment: who exploited an uncertainty in Empoli's defence. Probably Skorupski too\n23:20 Comment:  coming out he called for the ball and distracted his teammate who was in position to\n23:25 Comment: to be able to intervene. Luisa Adriano's head arose in a difficult moment\n23:30 Comment: For Milan it brought the team back into the lead.\n23:36 Comment: What is emerging from this championship match is that Milan, we are still\n23:42 Comment: at the beginning of the season, he has obvious playing problems but compared to a year ago he has two attackers\n23:47 Comment:  not bad.\n23:49 Comment: And here the exit of the Empoli goalkeeper who tried to intercept was completely wrong\n23:57 Comment: the ball half a meter behind where Luisa Adriano managed to hit it. He evaluated\n24:1 Comment: The trajectory was bad, but this really was a pure centre-forward goal from Adriano.\n24:9 Comment: Let's say that the two attackers played a sublime game but they confirm that the goal\n24:13 Comment: They don't see it and how.\n24:15 Comment: Yes yes it's true but on the other hand it is their prerogative to know even if they are\n24:21 Comment: two very different players because Luisa Adriano is stationed in the center of the penalty area\n24:26 Comment: waiting for these balls while Bacca moves more, attacks deeper\n24:32 Comment: He's less of a reference player than the Brazilian.\n24:37 Comment: Mario Rui, Empoli's reaction turns to Buccerelli 1-2 with Michelizze.\n24:41 Comment: Buccerelli is closed, he is responsible for dragging the ball out of the penalty area\n24:45 Comment:  and Antonelli takes the ball to the left of his foot and then Bonaventura lent it\n24:49 Comment: to Giusse.\n24:51 Comment: Giusse also resists the foul attempt, first by Bonaventura, made by Luisa Adriano\n24:54 Comment: in the strait, very good Mario Rui.\n24:57 Comment: Michelizze, Empoli reacts immediately, Sabonara is free, Zambelli sees it on the right\n25:1 Comment: He has to go and close Kuzka who is late, Zambelli orders himself for the cross, puts it in\n25:4 Comment: In the middle, Michelizze was anticipated by a whisker from a great defensive entry from Zapata.\n25:10 Comment: Zapata was very good here, because despite being behind his opponent he succeeded with his head\n25:15 Comment: to anticipate it, in the meantime let's review Luisa Adriano's header and the wrong exit\n25:20 Comment: by Skorupski, from this image you can see it really well, but nice reaction from him\n25:25 Comment: from Empoli who are trying.\n25:28 Comment: 25 and a half minutes into the second half, corner for Empoli, the fifth of this match,\n25:31 Comment: I invite you to jump inside the Milan penalty area, Zapata on Antonelli again,\n25:36 Comment: Romagnoli goes to Barba, beaten in the corner, the ball frees Barba who takes it\n25:40 Comment:  with a right hand volley, he puts it out.\n25:44 Comment: Empoli's problem is this Maurizio, he was the problem last year, he is the problem this year too,\n25:48 Comment: He must create many scoring opportunities to score, here in the meantime we see the great again\n25:54 Comment: Saving Zapata.\n26:2 Comment: With calm the Ariancio Diego Lopez.\n26:7 Comment: Cut to Kuzka, good luck.\n26:13 Comment: In the vertical for Bacca, Luiz Adriano must get out of the game, Bacca picks up speed, tries\n26:17 Comment: one on one, can't jump Barba, Kuzka.\n26:22 Comment: Let Bertolacci slide, the ball could be good for De Sciglio who doesn't get there.\n26:27 Comment: Edge of field for Peristepono.\n26:29 Comment: No one knows better than mia aerobics how important these points are, also in view of\n26:34 Comment: track and then in view of the derby, then Sinisa Mialovic is more nervous than before and asks\n26:39 Comment: The team not to concede goals, as happened in the first half, requires reactivity\n26:43 Comment: especially in the middle of the field, because then the defense is put to the greatest stress\n26:48 Comment:  because of this.\n26:49 Comment: Good luck, De Sciglio, Zapata.\n26:54 Comment: Good also in terms of the Colombian's disengagement.\n26:57 Comment: De Sciglio.\n26:59 Comment: In the vertical for Bacca, who starts beyond the line of the opposing defenders.\n27:4 Comment: I should see this because Bacca's move had been such a good move,\n27:9 Comment: I don't know if with the right time, see he takes this last step.\n27:12 Comment:  Di Bocco, Mario Foregioco, excellent call from Riccardo Di Fiore.\n27:16 Comment: Zambelli.\n27:19 Comment: Pursed by Luis Adriano.\n27:22 Comment: Micelizze, but he will go away by force, Romagnoli doesn't have him, Micelizze insists, the opening\n27:26 Comment:  for Saponara, Gaspazio, Saponara, on the left and the ball rejected, Micelizze at the limit,\n27:31 Comment: He's slow to get rid of the ball, Cuccicalo attacks, but the clearance isn't great.\n27:36 Comment:  Zielinski insists Empoli.\n27:38 Comment: He said.\n27:40 Comment: Zambelli.\n27:45 Comment: Zielinski.\n27:48 Comment: Good finish on Bertolacci.\n27:51 Comment: Cuccirelli, Micelizze, Romagnoli's advance, but Micelizze gets the ball back, Romagnoli\n27:55 Comment: then De Jong.\n27:56 Comment: Antonelli.\n27:58 Comment: It's not easy for Milan to defend, they're in a bit of trouble because Empoli have anyway\n28:3 Comment: energy again.\n28:7 Comment: The performance of this second half also makes the collapse quite surprising\n28:12 Comment: He was there in the second half against Chievo and Empoli played a new first half\n28:15 Comment:  closing with a 1-0 lead only to concede three goals in eight minutes in the second half.\n28:21 Comment: Bacca, space to gain speed, he extends the ball, just carries it forward, tries to break through\n28:25 Comment:  the past forward, Antonelli closes it with the collaboration of Barba, bacca also like\n28:29 Comment: I cover Tonelli's damage, free kick in favor of Empoli.\n28:42 Comment: Mario Rui.\n28:44 Comment: Soapara.\n28:46 Comment:  Beard.\n28:48 Comment: Mario Rui.\n28:50 Comment:  Shuts down De Jong somehow.\n28:52 Comment: Yousse.\n28:56 Comment: Bertolacci.\n28:58 Comment: Foul by Luis Adriano, Mario Rui who was looking for the advance missed, free kick shot\n29:3 Comment:  for Empoli, already beaten.\n29:4 Comment: Yousse.\n29:7 Comment: Zapata on Michelizze.\n29:8 Comment: Desciglio.\n29:10 Comment: Antonelli.\n29:20 Comment: Bacca's shot.\n29:23 Comment: In charge and the ball, Antonelli closes it, berry with years, throw-in and the applause\n29:28 Comment:  of a San Siro that seems particularly generous towards the Colombian.\n29:32 Comment: But because he always makes himself available to his partner, even in this case, he is tired\n29:35 Comment: Him too, but he went to make this movement to widen up to the sideline.\n29:42 Comment: Then it is clear that Milan also needs a more effective player, no, when\n29:47 Comment: he gets possession of the ball, but tonight he scored.\n29:53 Comment: In the 2 on Kuzka, he's doing well in that situation, put back in the attacking zone.\n30:10 Comment: Good luck.\n30:12 Comment: Youssé closes it, De Jong.\n30:18 Comment: Zapata.\n30:23 Comment: Out of play, the flag is raised to assist the referee.\n30:27 Comment: Signal of Antonelli's irregular position.\n30:35 Comment: And it's on the line.\n30:39 Comment: Change in Empoli, the match of the 17 year old Youssé ends here.\n30:43 Comment:  From his place, between the number 13 shirt, comes Raffaele Mariello, who is a midfielder from the Napoli school.\n30:49 Comment: Experience for him in Serie B, in Terni, but above all in Crotone, where he did very well last season.\n30:54 Comment: And also three goals last season, five in his previous experience at Crotone.\n31:1 Comment: But Youssé played well, maybe he missed some passes, but the boy played a game of substance, with an incredible personality, in my opinion.\n31:10 Comment: Hussadrian out of action.\n31:13 Comment: So, I'm taking advantage of this interruption, Luca, to ask you for four players nominated for the new Sky match, two from Milan and two from Empoli.\n31:20 Comment: So, beyond the performance for Milan, I say the authors of the two goals, Bacca and Luisa Adriano.\n31:26 Comment: As for Empoli, I really liked Saponara, even if he dropped off a bit in that second half, and Maccarone, despite being out, in my opinion was the author of a high-quality performance.\n31:36 Comment: At this moment it is possible to vote with the green button on your remote control on Luca Marchegiani's nominations.\n31:41 Comment: Soapara.\n31:47 Comment: Advance Mario Rui.\n31:51 Comment: Saponara defends the ball well from De Jong's pressure.\n31:54 Comment: Pucciarelli.\n31:57 Comment:  Cross. Inside for Saponara. De Jong closes.\n32:0 Comment: Zapata.\n32:1 Comment: I wish.\n32:4 Comment:  Search Luisa Adriano in depth. Close it, beard.\n32:7 Comment: Without committing a foul. No, there is a foul.\n32:10 Comment: The medical game whistles him, he has the free kicks in favor of Milan.\n32:13 Comment: Lots of players with cramps.\n32:15 Comment: It's actually incredibly humid this evening.\n32:18 Comment: We can hear it in the stands.\n32:20 Comment: I imagine the players who have been running for almost 90 minutes.\n32:31 Comment: 32 and a half minutes into the second half.\n32:33 Comment: 12 and a half and more recovery at the end.\n32:36 Comment: It's an advantage to have two goals to one in the first half.\n32:39 Comment: 16th Pacca. 20th Saponara.\n32:41 Comment: In the second half 24th Luisa Adriano.\n32:46 Comment: Now it's Montolio and the player is warming up with particular intensity.\n32:50 Comment: On the left Marco Giampaolo.\n32:52 Comment: On the right, left Mijanovic.\n32:56 Comment:  Mijanovic who among other things has never beaten Giampaolo in his career.\n33:0 Comment: In the previous four a victory for the coach in Puzziese and for Enfile, Treparezzi.\n33:7 Comment: Barba had a muscular problem and he's coming out quite disconsolate.\n33:22 Comment:  Forced to replace Giampaolo.\n33:30 Comment: Costa is about to enter.\n33:34 Comment: Good luck.\n33:37 Comment:  Pizzeria!\n34:6 Comment:  Acc BENDI!\n34:30 Comment: It costs you can attack.\n34:31 Comment: from the sampa d'aria with the sampa that won 1 to 0 in milan we have a goal\n34:34 Comment: It's really expensive. Lots of space here for Zelinski who also tried\n34:40 Comment: very tired on the other hand now demanding precision in technical gestures\n34:44 Comment: It's difficult for the players on the pitch Maurizio\n34:48 Comment: a lot of heart, a lot of soul and the little remaining energy thrown into the\n34:54 Comment:  field\n34:57 Comment: Now I'll tell him I thought about looking for him. Sadriano takes it in his head instead\n35:3 Comment: it still costs cross the closure of hoe bertolacci\n35:10 Comment: cuzca antonelli\n35:19 Comment: portafallantonelli then download on cuzca\n35:23 Comment: Inside for Macca they try in Cuzca there's Sadriano in the center looking for Macca\n35:29 Comment: because the bad thing about the ball is intercepted and the poles start again\n35:40

San Siro crowd closes zapped and limits them again for the cross poles\n36:25 Comment: go around Zambelli must go to close Cuzca to double Antonelli's mark\n36:31 Comment: zambelli with my left I decide to close, it's not over, there's a limit\n36:36 Comment: Saporara, what a volley does the out-of-portocampo stephano pepper not here\n36:42 Comment:  Do\n36:44 Comment: the poly\n36:49 Comment:

wasn't easy, it wasn't clear whether he was looking for a shot on goal or a\n38:10 Comment: cross towards the inside of the penalty direction was that of the cross\n38:14 Comment: power probably that

    "summary": "In an enthralling Serie A encounter at the iconic San Siro, AC Milan narrowly edged out Empoli with a 2-1 victory. The match was not only laden with tactical ingenuity but also a showcase of individual brilliance and team resilience from both sides.\n\nThe game began with AC Milan quickly taking control of the ball as Susse De Jong initiated the first play. Right at the 8th minute, Milan’s Luis Adriano posed an early threat, signaling his intent to capitalize on his attacking prowess. Additionally, Zapata filled in the defensive void left by the suspended Rodriguelli, showing his versatility in Milan’s defending lineup.\n\nRomagnoli’s progressive passes to Antonelli, who linked up efficiently with Suso, saw Milan create early connections in their buildup play. However, Empoli, well aware of the threats posed by Milan, managed to deploy their own attacking schemes. Giuseppe, who was instrumental in Empoli’s impressive display at San Siro the previous season, starred again, pressing Milan's defense and even coming close to scoring in the early stages.\n\nThe match evolved into a back-and-forth affair with Empoli's high press increasing the pressure on Milan’s defense, as reflected in the early minutes' gameplay. Both teams were not shy of physical challenges; for instance, Zapata and De Jong were crucial in neutralizing Empoli’s offensive maneuvers. Bertolacci and Suso made concerted efforts to penetrate Empoli’s defense but often found their endeavors thwarted either by misplaced passes or stern defensive actions from Empoli.\n\nEmpoli's well-organized defense paired with their aggressive midfield presence, especially from Diussé and Mario Rui, created difficulties for Milan in retaining possession. Yet, AC Milan’s strategy to frequently switch play from one flank to another tested Empoli's compact defensive unit. Notably, Diego Lopez's occasional inaccuracy in his long-range passes provided Empoli with opportunities to counter-attack, although they couldn't capitalize effectively in these initial moments.\n\nDespite moments of disjointed play from both sides, Milan's persistence bore fruit eventually. Around the 15th minute, De Jong's interception and subsequent pass to Suso allowed the Spaniard to make a probing run. Moments of Adriano’s precision passing and Romagnoli’s stability at the back established a direct yet calculated style of play for Milan.\n\nEmpoli matched Milan's intensity with neat passing sequences driven by Saponara’s creative playmaking and Zambelli’s relentless pressing on the right wing. Empoli’s tactical discipline and coordinated movements highlighted their intent to challenge Milan equally. The game remained tightly contested, evident from the multiple fifty-fifty duels and tactical fouls indicating both teams' refusals to cede control.\n\nIn the 23rd minute, AC Milan’s Carlso Bacca broke the deadlock. Bacca showcased his striking prowess by efficiently countering Empoli’s defensive strategies, making a crucial run that resulted in a goal. The assist, a perfectly weighted pass from Luiz Adriano, exemplified Milan's strategic long balls aiming to exploit the defensive gaps in Empoli's lineup. Bacca’s clinical finish validated his goal-scoring efficacy and invigorated Milan’s confidence.\n\nHowever, Empoli displayed remarkable resilience. They didn’t lapse into defensive caution but instead surged forward determinedly. This approach paid off handsomely just a few minutes later. Saponara capitalized on a communication breakdown in Milan’s defense, seizing the opportunity to slot the ball past Diego Lopez and equalize the score. The goal underscored Saponara’s awareness and composure under pressure. Empoli’s swift response hinted at their tenacity and tactical adaptability, unsettling Milan’s earlier momentum.\n\nThe first half concluded with both teams exchanging attacking attempts, yet Milan visibly struggled to impose their rhythm consistently. Despite the initial setback, Empoli's continuous threat, primarily orchestrated through intricate plays by Croce, Maccarone, and Pucciarelli, ensured they went into the break with renewed vigor.\n\nThe second half kicked off with an echo of the first period’s intensity. Milan showed strategic intent with vertical passes aiming to penetrate deep into Empoli's territory. Yet again, Empoli's compact defense, especially the performances of Tonelli and Rui, frustrated Milan’s attacking initiatives.\n\nMilan sought to harness new dynamics in the second period by introducing tactical modifications. Notably, Balotelli’s warm-up signaled a possible attacking reinforcement. Amid the attacking attempts by Milan, Empoli continued to stymie any efforts with a disciplined defensive play. A key moment arrived when De Jong's forceful shot was diligently parried by Skorupski, maintaining the scoreline equilibrium.\n\nEmpoli’s tactical discipline remained a hallmark. Their counterattacks displayed strategic depth, with therein-field connectivity, especially Saponara and Pucciarelli, continuously orchestrated potential goal-scoring moves. A notable attempt came when Bertolacci, slightly off-kilter, knocked the ball back, enabling a speculative long-range effort from Zielinski. Although it ultimately posed no threat, it reflected Empoli’s strategy to unsettle Milan’s rhythm.\n\nLuiz Adriano remained pivotal for Milan’s orchestrations upfront, frequently attempting combinations with his midfield runners and positioning himself advantageously within Empoli's half. Empoli's defense continued to repel Milan's attempts with tactical acumen, although Milan showed undeniable persistence. Eventually, it was Milan's relentless push that culminated in a match-deciding moment.\n\nAround the 68th minute, persistent attacking pressure allowed Milan to secure a corner kick. Jack Bonaventura’s precision delivery found Luiz Adriano, whose exemplary header, amidst defensive chaos, steered the ball into the net, putting Milan ahead once more.\n\nThe closing stages saw Milan emphasize defensive solidity to counter the risk of conceding another equalizer. Empoli, relentless in their pursuit of leveling the score, demonstrated commendable possession retention the key performers including Maccarone and Saponara. Miajlovic’s incessant urging from the sidelines indicated his desire for intensified field management and maintaining a defensive line.\n\nDespite the animated efforts and strategic high pressing by Empoli towards the game's end, Milan's defensive resilience anchored by Zapata and Romagnoli ensured that any threatening advances were effectively nullified. Antonelli's timely interventions and long clearances into Empoli's half further curtailed their attacking impetus.\n\nIn a final bid, Empoli pushed forward despite visible fatigue, with intensifying attempts to find the back of the net. However, they found Milan's defense unyielding, particularly highlighted by Zapata's composed defending and tactical awareness.\n\nThe full-time whistle brought respite and triumph for AC Milan, encapsulating a hard-fought victory where strategic maneuvers on the pitch, individual tenacity, and team coherence were vividly displayed. Milan emerged victorious with a sense of relief and accomplishment while Empoli, though leaving San Siro with no points, earned admiration for their competitive spirit and tactical prowess throughout the duel. \n\nIn summary, it was a match where twists, tactical masterstrokes, and resilient performances from both sides ensured a memorable clash for the Serie A spectators. Milan’s ability to utilize their key attacking players effectively, coupled with moments of brilliance from young talents, scripted this crucial win, fortifying their early season endeavors."
