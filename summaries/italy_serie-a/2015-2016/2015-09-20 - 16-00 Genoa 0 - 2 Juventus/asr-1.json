Sturaro.\n31:28 Comment: Sturaro has a very bad serve.\n31:31 Comment: By the way, for Sturaro the match is fundamental.\n31:34 Comment: Let me remind you that I played for two years in Genoa.\n31:37 Comment: I played quite successfully.\n31:39 Comment: And Leventus, when they picked him up from his loan,\n31:43 Comment: even somewhere in Sturaro\n31:45 Comment: I was somewhat upset about this,\n31:47 Comment: because he was going\n31:49 Comment: Finish last year's season for Genoa.\n31:51 Comment: But in the end Leventus made a decision\n31:52 Comment: pick up Sturaro mid-season.\n31:55 Comment: And this, of course,\n31:56 Comment: it was such a small shock\n31:58 Comment: for Sturaro.\n31:59 Comment: And, probably, judging by the interview,\n32:2 Comment: which he gave\n32:3 Comment: he's probably even a little\n32:4 Comment: I was upset about this.\n32:6 Comment: This is how it is stored\n32:7 Comment: and G Ferraris, and the fans, and the club.\n32:12

played the semi-final under Frialo, home.\n32:32 Comment: Which was quite important.\n32:34 Comment: And there Sturaro was one of the best.\n32:36 Comment: Well, actually\n32:38 Comment: has become real\n32:40 Comment: outstanding Serie A player\n32:46 Comment: among Italians.\n32:50 Comment: Much is expected of Stefan Sturaro.\n32:52 Comment: But now, of course, he\n32:54 Comment: it's a bit complicated too, because\n32:56 Comment: last year he went out to play together\n32:58 Comment: with Firlo, Ledal,\n33:0 Comment: Martizio and Pogba.\n33:2 Comment: Now three...\n33:4 Comment: No, that is, fours.\n33:6 Comment: But Martizio\n33:8 Comment: among these same\n33:10 Comment: will play very successfully and for a long time.\n33:12 Comment: Quadrado.\n33:14 Comment: The Quadrado starts up with the ball.\n33:16 Comment: He will keep them.\n33:18 Comment: Pogba.\n33:20 Comment: Pogba won't beat everyone.\n33:22 Comment: Pogba played a strong match against City.\n33:24 Comment: Everyone admitted this.\n33:26 Comment: He was one of the best.\n33:28 Comment: And Nemandukic's pass pours it out.\n33:30 Comment: Naturally, this was also noted.\n33:32 Comment: But in the Italian Championship\n33:34 Comment: Pogba is not that good yet.\n33:36 Comment: As I would like.\n33:38 Comment: To him and everyone else, I think.\n33:40 Comment: Vientuse.\n33:42 Comment: Corincon.\n33:44 Comment: Limina.\n33:46 Comment: And again a violation of the rules from the outside.\n33:48 Comment: And so,\n33:50 Comment: Here,\n33:54 Comment: from the outside\n33:56 Comment: Mario Limina.\n34:4 Comment: Well, this is, to put it mildly, a controversial point.\n34:6 Comment: Limina was playing ball.\n34:8 Comment: Maybe there was a push from behind?\n34:14 Comment: Free kick.\n34:16 Comment: Ejimiili at the ball.\n34:18 Comment: Now is an important moment, of course.\n34:20 Comment: A standard is always a chance.\n34:22 Comment: Score.\n34:38 Comment: Mario shouts to Bufo. I wonder which Mario.\n34:42 Comment: And two are now part of Ventus.\n34:45 Comment: Lemina and Mandzhutic.\n34:52 Comment: Jamayli's kick.\n34:56 Comment: And the ball flies near the bar.\n35:6 Comment: Jamaila had a very good shot.\n35:9 Comment: And, probably, the disappointment of the fans with Jan Abdulli is understandable.\n35:18 Comment: Although, in addition to this standard, there may be a couple of approaches.\n35:22 Comment: Marvelous.\n35:22 Comment: Ventus has nothing super dangerous in this match at all.\n35:26 Comment: There's a lot of fighting and fouls.\n35:36 Comment: Ecksteiner.\n35:39 Comment: Another pass to Barzalia's der.\n35:43 Comment: Quadrado.\n35:45 Comment: Handles the ball.\n35:47 Comment: Quadrado. Bukba.\n35:50 Comment: Ecksteiner.\n35:52 Comment: Lemina.\n35:57 Comment: Pereira.\n36:0 Comment: He free-kicks Pereira.\n36:2 Comment: Turning kick.\n36:3 Comment: And Juventus scores.\n36:5 Comment: Juventus scores.\n36:6 Comment: Paul Pagba became the author of this most curious moment.\n36:13 Comment: Because there was a wonderful pass from Pereira.\n36:16 Comment: Let us note his sharp actions on the flank of the penalty area.\n36:22 Comment: Here. Fine.\n36:24 Comment: Pereira left abruptly.\n36:26 Comment: Next came the serve.\n36:27 Comment: Was Pagba offside?\n36:30 Comment: That is the question.\n36:32 Comment: Moreover, the question is important.\n36:33 Comment: Then Pagba struck.\n36:34 Comment: But he hit the crossbar.\n36:35 Comment: The ball bounced into the knee of the Genoa goalkeeper.\n36:40 Comment: Evgeniy Lamanna.\n36:42 Comment: And then it flew into the goal from his knee.\n36:49 Comment: Grifonov.\n36:51 Comment: 1-0 Juventus.\n36:52 Comment: The question of Pagba's offside remains ahead.\n36:54 Comment: I think they will definitely show us a replay.\n36:59 Comment: Well, I have a question personally.\n37:1 Comment: Another one.\n37:2 Comment: To whose account will the ball be registered?\n37:4 Comment: What about Pagba?\n37:6 Comment: No, of course not.\n37:8 Comment: On account of Lamanna goalkeeper.\n37:11 Comment: Genua is in tight.\n37:15 Comment: Although Pagba, of course, can also consider himself soft, say, involved in this goal scored.\n37:21 Comment: But let's note, of course, the actions.\n37:22 Comment: Roberto Pereira's actions on the right flank.\n37:31 Comment: Lemina.\n37:34 Comment: Lemina takes the ball.\n37:36 Comment: He also shoots on goal.\n37:37 Comment: And the ball flies higher.\n37:41 Comment: Mario Lemina plays Desire, but now...\n37:47 Comment: Here we are looking.\n37:50 Comment: Well, by the way, it’s not very good here.\n37:52 Comment: Here, of course, this is not...\n37:53 Comment: Yes, it’s the Italians who are now naturally showing off their new device.\n38:0 Comment: Automatic goal in England since last year.\n38:4 Comment: It is running in Italy this season.\n38:7 Comment: Well, it’s clear that there are no questions here.\n38:9 Comment: The ball did not cross the line from the crossbar.\n38:11 Comment: The question is more about offside.\n38:13 Comment: Personally, it torments me.\n38:14 Comment: This is a more interesting point.\n38:16 Comment: But everything was controversial there.\n38:18 Comment: You have to watch several replays there.\n38:19 Comment: And, accordingly, with a camera, which we still lack.\n38:22 Comment: The ball draws a line on the floor.\n38:23 Comment: Lemina in the selection.\n38:25 Comment: Again quite successful.\n38:28 Comment: Manzhou is flowing headlong.\n38:30 Comment: The ball is thrown onto the button.\n38:32 Comment: Wingkong.\n38:45 Comment: Leitsteiner.\n38:46 Comment: To Lemina.\n38:48 Comment: Again misunderstanding between the two.\n38:51 Comment: not the first matches\n38:57 Comment: exactly Mandzukic and now 3 or 4\n39:1 Comment: Alimin in the match is probably the referee and right here\n39:5 Comment: Mr. Arbiter already has the right to think about the yellow arshikis of the French\n39:10 Comment: midfielder because this is not the first time he fouls than fouls\n39:13 Comment: well, it’s close to the goal but at least to the Perotti post on the

He plays on the right, 93rd Diego Laxald plays on the left. He plays left lateral.\n0:22 Comment: Three defenders in the center were, let's say, the fifth. Isa had it removed. Now there are two of them left. This is number 4 Demaio, number 8 Burguiso. A group of midfielders. Number 31 Bleriem Jamaili, number 88 Thomas Rincón. Perotti played instead of Minopolio. Figueiras has just arrived.\n0:44 Comment: Also in the midfield line is Jules Matshan, number 18.\n0:51 Comment: And drums.\n0:52 Comment: Florward Diego Capelin, number 16.

    "summary": "In a highly anticipated clash between Genoa and Juventus, the glamour and grit of Serie A football were on full display. The match unfolded at Stadio Luigi Ferraris, bringing together two teams with contrasting fortunes. Genoa looked to overcome their early-season struggles, while Juventus aimed to build on their momentum following a convincing victory against Manchester City in the Champions League.\n\nThe game commenced with Juventus appearing sharp right from the outset. Genoa’s defensive line, consisting of Eugenio Lamanna in goal, Issa, Demai, and Burdisso, faced immediate pressure. Patric Evra, who often positioned himself towards the midfield, quickly asserted dominance on the left flank, aligning well with the rest of the defense. On the right, experienced campaigner Stephan Lichtsteiner was partnered by Andrea Barzagli and Giorgio Chiellini, setting up a solid backline.\n\nIn midfield, Juventus showcased a blend of youth and experience with Mario Lemina, making his debut after his loan move from Marseille, Paul Pogba, and Stefano Sturaro, providing creative prowess and physical presence. Meanwhile, Genoa formed a compact midfield with Tomas Rincon and Blerim Dzemaili leading their efforts to stymie Juventus' advances.\n\nJuventus' attack was spearheaded by Alvaro Morata and Mario Mandzukic, supported by Juan Cuadrado, promising a lethal combination of speed and finishing prowess. The early exchanges saw Juventus monopolizing the midfield, with Pogba and Lemina dictating the rhythm and spreading the play wide to utilize the wings. Genoa, meanwhile, were forced to play a cautious game, defending deep and waiting for counter-attack opportunities.\n\nThe breakthrough came in the 18th minute when Juventus capitalized on their sustained pressure. Alvaro Morata navigated through Genoa’s defense with remarkable efficiency, delivering a perfect pass that allowed Mario Mandzukic to slot home with composure. The Croatian’s instinctive positioning and clinical finish were a testament to his predatory skills in front of goal.\n\nGenoa’s attempts to retaliate were met with staunch defense from Juventus. Evra, Chiellini, and Barzagli showed no signs of vulnerability, effectively neutralizing any threat posed by Genoa's forward line. Diego Capel and Jules Ntcham tried to weave past the Juventus fortress but found themselves constantly repelled.\n\nThroughout the first half, the tempo of the match was relentless. Andrea Barzagli orchestrated the Juve defense with the calmness and poise expected of a veteran, while Gianluigi Buffon remained largely untested in goal. Genoa's struggle to break down Juventus' defense was evident as their attackers failed to find any clear openings.\n\nAs the match approached the half-hour mark, Juventus continued to dominate the proceedings. Mandzukic, Cuadrado, and Morata combined fluidly, creating chances and keeping Genoa's defense on high alert. Genoa's woes were compounded when Issa was sent off for a second bookable offense after bringing down a marauding Cuadrado. The numerical disadvantage made Genoa’s task all the more daunting.\n\nDespite playing with ten men, Genoa exhibited moments of resilience, particularly through Tomas Rincon, who tirelessly patrolled the midfield and attempted to drive his team forward. Yet, the incessant pressure from Juventus was difficult to withstand. Cuadrado’s darting runs and Pogba’s masterful control ensured that Genoa remained on the back foot for much of the contest.\n\nIn the second half, Juventus continued right where they left off. Patrice Evra remained influential, often joining the attack and linking up well with Pogba and Lemina. An early effort saw Evra cross the ball into the box, only for it to be cleared by Burdisso. However, Juventus did not relent and kept probing the Genoa defense.\n\nRoberto Pereyra, who had a splendid game on the flank, was instrumental in Juventus' attacking plays. His creativity and agility caused numerous problems for Genoa defenders. Pereyra's effort was rewarded when he assisted Paul Pogba for the second goal of the match. Pogba’s strike, which came off the crossbar before hitting the Genoa goalkeeper Lamanna and bouncing into the net, was a cumulative result of relentless Juventus pressure.\n\nGenoa, now trailing 2-0 and a man down, tried to summon a response. Goran Pandev was brought on to add more firepower, but Juventus' defense held firm. Juventus manager Massimiliano Allegri made strategic substitutions, bringing on fresh legs and ensuring his team's dominance remained unchallenged.\n\nMidway through the second half, the physicality of the game was at its peak with several robust tackles and midfield battles. Evra and Lichtsteiner continued to be assertive in their respective roles, while Mandzukic and Morata pursued more scoring opportunities. Sturaro too had a couple of decent chances but was unable to extend Juventus' lead.\n\nAs the match progressed, tensions flared. Players from both teams clashed multiple times, requiring the referee to intervene and hand out a series of yellow cards to maintain control. The heavy involvement of defenders like Chiellini and Lichtsteiner showcased Juventus' defensive resilience, while Buffon's assured presence between the sticks ensured that Genoa could not find a way back into the game.\n\nDespite Genoa’s spirited attempts, particularly through De Maio and Rai, their forward momentum was repeatedly stymied. Juventus' midfield trio of Lemina, Pogba, and Sturaro kept the ball under control, slowing down the tempo and maintaining possession to frustrate Genoa's efforts.\n\nIn the final quarter of the match, Simone Zaza was introduced in place of Mandzukic, bringing fresh energy to Juventus' attacks. Zaza's physicality and determination were evident even as he contested fiercely for every ball. \n\nA notable moment occurred when Zaza found the back of the net, but the goal was ruled out for offside. Even though the decision was correct, it highlighted Juventus’ relentless pursuit for more goals. As the final whistle approached, Juventus comfortably controlled proceedings, ensuring Genoa remained thwarted.\n\nThe 2-0 victory for Juventus was a testament to their tactical superiority, disciplined defending, and clinical finishing. Paul Pogba and Mario Mandzukic, along with Cuadrado and Evra, played pivotal roles in this important win. For Genoa, despite their best efforts, the match illustrated the challenges they face and the improvements needed, especially in coping with high-pressure situations and maintaining discipline. \n\nThis encounter at Stadio Luigi Ferraris was a reminder of Juventus' dominance in Serie A and their unwavering pursuit of success both domestically and in Europe. For Genoa, it was a day of hard lessons as they prepare to regroup and look ahead to their next challenge."
