playing in the Italian Championship for a long time.\n1:23 Comment: Eddie Neilson, number 21, Fernandes 8th, Badu 7th and Iturre number 16.\n1:33 Comment: This is the center of the field, two forwards, 10th Dinataly, number 7, 7th Terro.\n1:39 Comment: Dynataliy most likely plays in a 3-5-2 formation.\n1:43 Comment: Apparently, Pires, he can play on the wing,\n1:47 Comment: Can also play in defense.\n1:48 Comment: Today he plays in the position of left central defender.\n1:51 Comment: In the center of Domica, number 11.\n1:53 Comment: Yes, according to one version, the replacement

action.\n2:18 Comment: Milan at Lopez's gate, number 1.\n2:20 Comment: Next, pay attention, a very young 18-year-old Calabria guy, number 96, is playing on the right.\n2:28 Comment: Deshilia, number 2, plays on the left.\n2:30 Comment: Here is Calabria with the ball, passing to Montalivo.\n2:32 Comment: In the center of defense are the 17th Sapado, the 13th Normannoli.\n2:36 Comment: Milan played almost the entire match with this lineup against Palermo.\n2:41 Comment: Center field, 28th Montalivo, 18th Dayong and 34th Montalivo.\n2:49 Comment: This is what Milan's line of halfbacks looks like.\n2:52 Comment: Hondo, number 10 under attacker Mi.\n2:57 Comment: And the forwards of the 45th were Hotels and the 70th Carlos Baca.\n3:2 Comment: Calanto, he is Udinese's mentor.\n3:5 Comment: Well, as for Milan’s coach, it’s Sinisa Mihajlovic.\n3:10 Comment: Here it is on your screens.\n3:15 Comment: Match referee Daniel Doveri.\n3:18 Comment: Tero receives the ball.\n3:21 Comment: Plays for Edinilson.\n3:32 Comment: Milan is on the attack.\n3:35 Comment: There were Hotels.\n3:37 Comment: And earns a free kick.\n3:39 Comment: Mario was Hotels.\n3:41 Comment: In this situation, Super

diminished somewhat.\n6:4 Comment: At least in terms of their voice support.\n6:8 Comment: Somehow they became quiet.\n6:10 Comment: If we take the start from Dineza, then it is close to disaster.\n6:14 Comment: Because in four rounds there are only three points and only one victory.\n6:21 Comment: And then she was won in the first round.\n6:23 Comment: This is a bit of an unexpected and perhaps even sensational victory.\n6:28 Comment: And even somewhere the victory is unfair.\n6:32 Comment: Because they beat Juventus, the Udina players, on the road.\n6:36 Comment: But they made only one shot on goal during the entire match.\n6:39 Comment: Which ended up being the goal.\n6:41 Comment: And, in fact, Dineza played more defense than attack almost the entire game.\n6:44 Comment:

Shiny.\n10:1 Comment: Combination.\n10:4 Comment: Performance of Montolivo and Bonamentura.\n10:6 Comment: It's an Italian goal.\n10:8 Comment: Although Bolotelli is Italian.\n10:10 Comment: So for now all the goals are Italian.\n10:14 Comment: At Milan. Let's see.\n10:16 Comment: There was no pass.\n10:18 Comment: Bonamentura started at the right time.\n10:20 Comment: Well, the most important thing.\n10:22 Comment: Montolivo saw him.\n10:24 Comment: And he made an almost perfect pass.\n10:26 Comment: Like on a silver platter.\n10:28 Comment: And then Bonamentura’s performing skills.\n10:30 Comment: One touch.

Comment: Fernandes.\n30:58 Comment: And it is very important now that Bolotelli himself gets the second\n31:0 Comment: yellow.\n31:1 Comment: He already has one.\n31:2 Comment: Therefore, the arbitrator can react here.\n31:4 Comment: For fouls.\n31:10 Comment: Of course, this is Bolotelli's big problem, that\n31:14 Comment: he is a completely uncontrollable person.\n31:16 Comment: And it’s impossible to imagine what to expect from him in the next second.\n31:21 Comment: absolutely.\n31:22 Comment: Galiana.\n31:23 Comment: The name gives some people away.\n31:43 Comment: Perhaps even

match.\n32:53 Comment: Then Bolotelli received a yellow card in the first half.\n32:57 Comment: And during the break, as Bolotelli later said, he was all\n32:59 Comment: I dedicated the break to myself.\n33:1 Comment: He asked, begged, convinced Bolotelli not to fail.\n33:6 Comment: Moreover, there was a problem, as again, according to Murin,\n33:10 Comment: that he explained for a long time to Bolotelli that I only have one striker,\n33:14 Comment: it's you.\n33:15 Comment: There are no strikers in reserve.\n33:16 Comment: I can't remove you.\n33:18 Comment: There is no one to put on the

Comment: Bolotelli asked me to play carefully and not interfere\n33:31 Comment: in martial arts, so as not to get a yellow card, because\n33:34 Comment: that Inter had no more strikers in that match.\n33:39 Comment: What did Bolotelli do?\n33:40 Comment: In the 46th minute I received a second yellow.\n33:43 Comment: Removed from the field.\n33:44 Comment: This is the most famous story,

situation, of course, is different.\n34:13 Comment: There is Todriano in reserve.\n34:14 Comment: But he will still convince, persuade, ask not\n34:18 Comment: fall and so on.\n34:19 Comment: And Bolotelli can take it in the first second\n34:22 Comment: red card.\n34:23 Comment: This is him, Mario Bolotelli.\n34:52 Comment: No, there was no foul, there was a lie, as far as I understand.\n35:6 Comment: But the corner flag did not fare well.\n35:9 Comment: Bolotelli handled the ball.\n35:11 Comment: By the way, it wasn’t here.\n35:16 Comment: Here, in principle, everything is correct.\n35:17

it.\n36:17 Comment: Dynatalia, the blow falls under the ball.\n36:19 Comment: Montali him.\n36:20 Comment: Peris.\n36:21 Comment: And I didn’t understand him.\n36:22 Comment: Dynatalia also expresses claims against Toto\n36:34 Comment: Dynatalia.\n36:35 Comment: Not Dynatalia, but, of course, Perisa.\n36:36 Comment: He, in fact, is Dinatalia himself.\n37:36 Comment: One.\n37:37 Comment: We see.\n37:38 Comment: We, dialogue between Dynatalia and Peris.\n37:39 Comment: Bolotelli.\n37:40 Comment: Well, Bolotelli could have saved the ball.\n37:41 Comment: Why did you have to wait for the referee's whistle?\n37:42 Comment: It seems to me that the attack will be very difficult.\n37:43 Comment: And, of course, it will be very difficult.\n37:44 Comment: But, of course, it will be very difficult.\n37:45 Comment: And, of course, it will be very difficult.\n37:57 Comment: Yellow card for Aiturra.\n38:23 Comment: And this is the moment when Bolotelli broke the corner flag.\n38:33

just don’t work.\n16:36 Comment: Couldn't get it right.\n16:37 Comment: He was already, in fact, on the lawn.\n16:38 Comment: And he hit from not the most comfortable position, to put it mildly.\n16:43 Comment: Well, the ball just flew into the air.\n16:46 Comment: And he fought with Alex.\n16:47 Comment: I also have nothing against Alex.\n16:50 Comment: He is, of course, a great defender.\n16:52 Comment: But by releasing Alex instead of Calabrio, of course, he made the center of defense somewhat heavier.\n16:58 Comment: And the whole defense in general.\n16:58 Comment: Because Zapat is not the fastest footballer.\n17:0 Comment: Calabrio, of course, was distinguished by speed.\n17:3 Comment: And this was his undoubted advantage.\n17:4 Comment: But of course, maybe it can't.\n17:6 Comment: Of course, a less experienced footballer.\n17:8 Comment: But nonetheless.\n17:9 Comment: Tero.\n17:10 Comment: Leaves the ball in Tero's play.\n17:11 Comment: Montalivo.\n17:12 Comment: Tero.\n17:13 Comment: And a corner kick.\n17:14 Comment: Udinese is making money now.\n17:16 Comment: Another one.\n17:18 Comment: Meanwhile, Milan is preparing a replacement, Andrea Poli.\n17:22 Comment: Central midfielder instead of Cavo.\n17:26 Comment: There will also be a very interesting solution now.\n17:28 Comment: I'm betting on De Jong.\n17:29 Comment: Or Honda.\n17:29 Comment: Although Honda can now be replaced by Mikhailovich.\n17:32 Comment: Dynatalia serves.\n17:33 Comment: Dangerous.\n17:34 Comment: Maybe Baka.\n17:35 Comment: Helps his own people.\n17:36 Comment: Another blow for the defenders.\n17:38 Comment: Above the gate.\n17:40 Comment: Alan Adnan.\n17:42 Comment: Ali Adnan shot on goal.\n17:44 Comment: Yes, Honda is being replaced by Andrea Poli.\n17:46 Comment: I changed my mind in time.\n17:49 Comment: Surprised.\n17:49 Comment: Yes, even the eyes.\n17:51 Comment: Honda changed its shape a little.\n17:55 Comment: And Andrea Poli comes out instead.\n17:59 Comment: Well, it’s clear that now Mikhailovich wants to take not even by quality,\n18:2 Comment: but by the number of its players who know how to defend.\n18:6 Comment: I think I’m even a little surprised at Adrian Goliana’s replacement.\n18:9 Comment: Although Bonaventura, in principle, will play the track quartista.\n18:13 Comment: In any case, he will play in the position behind the Mi striker.\n18:16 Comment: And Poly, of course, will add such movement to the center of the field.\n18:24 Comment: The hammer plays dangerously.\n18:25 Comment: He has a yellow card.\n18:26 Comment: We remember this.\n18:29 Comment: Also yellow in Vagio.\n18:31 Comment: Dinese, Pires and Calabri also had warnings.\n18:35 Comment: But their coach was on time.\n18:36 Comment: Apparently they replaced it in time.\n18:37 Comment: Although I have big doubts about Calabri.\n18:41 Comment: Alex!\n18:42 Comment: Yes, again, in fact, Milan are operating without a right back.\n18:48 Comment: Now Alex was there.\n18:50 Comment: At first I played to match.\n18:52 Comment: Now Alex began to play right back.\n18:54 Comment: But, I repeat, this is, in my opinion, a very dubious decision.\n18:57 Comment: Alex clears the ball from outside his own penalty area.\n19:6 Comment: And here he folds against Mario Moloteli.\n19:17 Comment: There was no offside at this point.\n19:22 Comment: But, in any case, the episode was already from the game.\n19:25 Comment: Vagio.\n19:36 Comment: Descillo.\n19:40 Comment: Pass back.\n19:43 Comment: Diego Lopez.\n19:52 Comment: The ball is intercepted by Dinezi Molotelli.\n19:55 Comment: Enters the fight.\n19:55 Comment: Diego.\n20:6 Comment: And Tura.\n20:11 Comment: Pass back.\n20:14 Comment: Karnezis.\n20:15 Comment: Long

Comment: Bonaventura twist kick.\n20:35 Comment: Ball.\n20:36 Comment: Near.\n20:37 Comment: Flew close to the barbell.\n20:50 Comment: Hit.\n20:52 Comment: Bonaventura turned out good, but...\n20:57 Comment: To me...\n21:0 Comment: It’s almost impossible to score like that with a non-natural foot.\n21:6 Comment: Zapata.\n21:7 Comment: Zapata went ahead.\n21:8 Comment: Right back is taking on a new position on the field.\n21:13 Comment: Bonaventure.\n21:14 Comment: They swamped.\n21:15 Comment: Yes, of course, Bolotelli will now turn on the speed.\n21:18 Comment: But why keep the ball on the flank now?\n21:20 Comment: Still play 25 minutes in this game.\n21:22 Comment: But is he going to...\n21:26 Comment: Stand on the flank for 25 minutes, or what?\n21:30 Comment: Bonaventure.\n21:34 Comment: John Suleiman.\n21:35 Comment: Dmitry Mullin.\n21:36 Comment: Maybe I got it mixed up?\n21:38 Comment: The time that is now on the stopwatch was swamped, on\n21:41 Comment: scoreboard\n21:42 Comment: 66th, not 86th minute of the match.\n21:52 Comment: Once again, it is not as noticeable today as it was 3 days ago\n21:57 Comment: back in the game with Palerma.\n22:1 Comment: In the

Comment: Zapata.\n22:11 Comment: Bonaventure.\n22:12 Comment: A pass opens up on Boloter.\n22:14 Comment: It should.\n22:15 Comment: Next up is Bonaventure again.\n22:22 Comment: Another pass back.\n22:24 Comment: Milan again.\n22:27 Comment: This segment is advantageous in terms of ball control and overall control of the situation.\n22:32 Comment: But another thing is that Denis doesn’t need much to score a goal.\n22:36 Comment: For example, now Badu receives the ball.\n22:39 Comment: Next pass to Fernandes.\n22:44 Comment: Denisan.\n22:47 Comment: Between the lines is Zapata.\n22:49 Comment: But, however, he didn’t make any movement towards the ball.\n22:50 Comment: That's why I didn't receive the pass.\n22:53 Comment: Ali Ednan.\n22:55 Comment: Badu.\n22:57 Comment: Tero.\n22:59 Comment: Coming.\n23:0 Comment: Will play back.\n23:1 Comment: Vageo.\n23:2 Comment: Damio.\n23:2 Comment: Mitzi.\n23:9 Comment: Fernandes.\n23:12 Comment: Denisan.\n23:13 Comment: It was difficult to handle such a ball.\n23:14 Comment: Especially with this kind of movement.\n23:15 Comment: Descillo.\n23:17 Comment: In field.\n23:18 Comment: Enters the game on the field.\n23:21 Comment: And a free kick.\n23:33 Comment: There is security.\n23:38 Comment: There's no need to do anything.\n23:42 Comment: Fernandez.\n23:43 Comment: More about aerospace.\n23:51 Comment: Our players will not be shown

right is Duan Zapata, I mean.\n24:5 Comment: And this is a dangerous moment!\n24:8 Comment: Well, literally...\n24:10 Comment: A second was not enough for Tero.\n24:18 Comment: Literally seconds.\n24:19 Comment: Look, if Tero had started a little earlier, just a little,\n24:23 Comment: then he could easily catch this ball.\n24:24 Comment: There again such a hole appeared in Milan's defense.\n24:27 Comment: Just a disaster.\n24:32 Comment: Badu.\n24:38 Comment: Stick him in.\n24:41 Comment: And breaking the rules.\n24:50 Comment: Yellow card.\n24:55 Comment: Now a Milan football player.\n24:58 Comment: Christian Zapata gets it.\n25:2 Comment: For a rather flagrant foul against a Udinese player.\n25:8 Comment: Here Montali shows him.\n25:10 Comment: Home, home, we return to our gates.\n25:12 Comment: Yes, Christian Zapata got it high.\n25:16 Comment: Not a free kick.\n25:17 Comment: Free kick, friends.\n25:18 Comment: Friends.\n25:30 Comment: Nervous ending for

will catch the ball and return it.\n25:43 Comment: Oh, what a moment.\n25:45 Comment: Well, here comes the skill of Diego Lopez.\n25:48 Comment: Here is the skill of Diego Lopez.\n25:50 Comment: Definitely.\n25:58 Comment: Another serve by Dinils.\n26:0 Comment: Badu.\n26:1 Comment: The ball is in the penalty area.\n26:2 Comment: Still remains Dinatali.\n26:4 Comment: And another corner kick.\n26:6 Comment: Yes, Montali was already in a hopeless situation.\n26:8 Comment: It was necessary to kill the ball somehow.\n26:9 Comment: He, in fact, knocked him out.\n26:10 Comment: Just for the corner.\n26:18 Comment: Innings.\n26:19 Comment: Hit.\n26:22 Comment: Above the gate.\n26:28 Comment: Houses.\n26:30 Comment: Won the fight against Deyong.\n26:31 Comment: And he hit it with his

Let's see the delivery for now.\n34:54 Comment: Breaking the rules.\n34:56 Comment: Adriano Galliani supported the comparison\n34:58 Comment: Bucky with Shevchenko. Galliani even said,\n35:0 Comment: that Andrey himself\n35:1 Comment: same opinion.

Of course he\n36:41 Comment: was an important football player\n36:43 Comment: in Udinese. Now Tura, of course,\n36:46 Comment: doesn't seem right\n36:47 Comment: useful for Udinese,\n36:51 Comment: like Alana.\n36:53 Comment: Romagnole.\n36:54 Comment: All Milan\n36:55 Comment: on your field plan.\n36:58 Comment: Everyone is defending, everyone is trying\n36:59 Comment: keep the advantage\n37:2 Comment: which was obtained in the first half.\n37:5 Comment: But so far it's working\n37:7 Comment: do.\n37:16 Comment: Karnezis.\n37:26 Comment: In the second half we hardly see him.\n37:29 Comment: He doesn't really participate in the game.\n37:36 Comment: Hold it!\n37:52 Comment: Today I passed to the left flank.\n37:54 Comment: Zapata!\n38:0 Comment: In the penalty area.\n38:2 Comment: Badu!\n38:4 Comment: Over there, to the left.\n38:6 Comment: The first one is on selection.\n38:8 Comment: Wall with De Jong. Next, pass to Adriana.\n38:10 Comment: What will Adriana come up with?\n38:12 Comment: Adamidze, of course, held him.\n38:14 Comment: And fouled him.\n38:16 Comment: Adamidze, the referee, naturally, is a little hard to see.\n38:24 Comment: He just put his hand on his shoulder and started pushing him away.\n38:28 Comment: Adrian.\n38:30 Comment: Marquinho.\n38:32 Comment: Another substitution for Iturra.\n38:34 Comment: Iturra leaves the field.\n38:36 Comment: And Marquinho.\n38:38 Comment: Who once played for Roma.\n38:40 Comment: And in general he was quite...\n38:42 Comment: In Kyiv.\n38:44 Comment: Famous football player one year in Serie A.\n38:46 Comment: He scored a lot, gave a lot of assists.\n38:48 Comment: Woodinese is playing now.\n38:50 Comment: Badu!\n38:52 Comment: I literally ran across the field.\n38:54 Comment: From Bonaventure I apologize.\n38:56 Comment: But Bonaventure eventually broke the rules.\n38:58 Comment: To Badu.\n39:0 Comment: Another free kick.\n39:2 Comment: Iturra.\n39:4 Comment: Badu!\n39:28 Comment: So.\n39:30 Comment: Dinatali at the ball.\n39:32 Comment: Free kick.\n39:34 Comment: Next...\n39:36 Comment: The problem, according to Doverev, is the penalty kick.\n39:38 Comment: Between the players they fight incorrectly.\n39:40 Comment: But now...\n39:42 Comment: He did the work.

    "summary": "The Serie A encounter between Udinese and AC Milan at Stadio Friuli turned out to be a thrilling and dramatic affair, where Milan eventually edged out Udinese with a 3-2 victory. \n\nThe match began with an electric atmosphere as both teams looked eager to make their mark early. Udinese, positioning themselves in a 3-5-2 formation, seemed to place some dependence on their flank players. Ali Adnan from Iraq and Eddirson, hailing from Brazil, were integral players on the wings with Antonio Di Natale spearheading their attack.\n\nMilan’s approach under their coach, Sinisa Mihajlovic, appeared strategic and youthful. The enthusiastic 18-year-old Davide Calabria occupied the right-back position while De Sciglio played on the left. Central defense duties were handled by Christian Zapata and Alessio Romagnoli. The rossoneri midfield was helmed by Montolivo, De Jong, and Honda, who was deployed slightly ahead in a more attacking role behind Balotelli and Carlos Bacca.\n\nMilan started the match impressively strong. Early into the game, Balotelli showcased his individual brilliance by earning and converting a free-kick with precision and power, putting Milan in the lead at the fifth minute. This goal was met with jubilation from Milan fans. Balotelli, often a figure of controversy, reminded everyone of his undeniable skill. This goal sent a wave of energy through Milan’s ranks, and they soon doubled their lead. Montolivo spotted Bonaventura’s run, threading a pass that the latter controlled masterfully before finishing past the Udinese goalkeeper, Carnesecchi, making it 2-0.\n\nUdinese’s fans, who had started the match with high hopes, slowly quieted as the realisation of Milan’s dominance sank in. However, their team tried to muster some resilience. Cyril Théréau managed to get a shot off for Udinese, but it went wide. This was one of their rare moments of attack in the first half, which highlighted Udinese’s struggles and Milan’s defensive solidity. On the attack, Milan didn’t relent. Calabria, showing an admirable sense of offensive engagement for a full-back, dribbled down the right and crossed for Balotelli, whose assist led to a well-taken effort by Bonaventura.\n\nAs the first half winded down, Milan solidified their lead further. From a corner, Zapata rose highest and headed the ball strongly into the net to make it 3-0. This goal from Zapata signalled a seemingly decisive blow to Udinese’s hopes. The crowds were stunned into silence, and even Milan’s coach, Mihajlovic, while pleased, maintained his focus on ensuring the game’s control.\n\nEntering the first half with such an advantageous lead, it was Milan’s match to lose. But in football, no lead is ever completely safe, and the second half demonstrated just that.\n\nThe second half started with Udinese making some critical adjustments, showing more intent and fervor. They restructured their formation to a more aggressive stance and Stefan Colugiono’s tactical changes bore fruit almost immediately. Emmanuel Agmeyanko Badu pulled one back for Udinese, guiding the ball under Lopez, Milan’s goalkeeper, and into the net. This goal at the 54th minute gave Udinese a glimmer of hope. With the score now at 3-1, Milan’s previously unshakeable control seemed more precarious.\n\nUdinese’s newfound vigor saw them pressing Milan tirelessly. Dinatale, although not the quickest anymore, used his vast experience to pin back Milan’s defense, creating spaces and drawing fouls. Udinese capitalized on this resurgence as Duvan Zapata, who had been brought on, made an instant impact. With Milan’s defensive organization faltering under sustained pressure, Zapata slotted home from close range after a mêlée in the box, making it 3-2. Suddenly, the seemingly unassailable lead Milan had built was under direct threat.\n\nThe tension was palpable throughout the stadium. Dinatale’s presence and Fernandes’ industry kept Milan’s defense alert. There was a moment of severe scare for Milan when indeed, Udinese could have drawn level, but Lopez’s agility and command in goal ensured Milan stayed ahead. He made crucial saves, particularly a reflex stop from Fernandes that prevented the equalizer.\n\nAs the match neared its conclusion, the tempo remained high. Milan sought to exert control and waste as much time as possible without letting Udinese sniff an equalizer. The physicality ramped up, with tackles flying and tempers flaring. Fernandes, already booked, fouled Balotelli and saw a second yellow, reducing Udinese to ten men in the dying moments. This made their already uphill battle even more steep.\n\nThe final whistle eventually blew, and Milan held on to clinch a narrow 3-2 victory. The relief on Mihajlovic’s face was evident. This match wasn’t just a testament to Milan’s attacking prowess but also their capacity to withstand pressure. \n\nBalotelli, who had opened the scoring, demonstrated both the genius and the volatility he is known for—a crucial goal, some moments of brilliance coupled with unnecessary fouls. Bonaventura remained instrumental with his balanced game of defense and attack, supplementing his excellent free-kick execution with tireless running.\n\nUdinese, although defeated, showed a commendable spirit in the second half. Their tactical change, the introduction of Zapata, and the midfield dynamism of Badu and Fernandes, albeit short-lived due to the latter's expulsion, were highlights that gave their fans something to cheer about despite the loss.\n\nIn summary, AC Milan’s 3-2 win over Udinese was an enthralling game that had moments of exquisite skill, tactical shifts, and high drama. Milan can draw confidence from their initial impressive displays and the fortitude they showed in the face of Udinese's spirited comeback. For Udinese, despite the loss, the resilience shown in the second half against a top side like Milan could be a cornerstone upon which they build their season."
